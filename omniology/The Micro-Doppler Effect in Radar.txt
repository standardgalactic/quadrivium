Preface
The micro-Doppler effect was originally introduced in a coherent laser system 
to measure the kinematic properties of an object, such as the vibration rate 
and the displacement of the vibration. Micro-Doppler frequency shifts can be 
characterized by the distinctive signature that represents the intricate features 
generated from structural components of the object. In laser radar systems, even 
with a very low vibration rate, a micro displacement of the object’s vibration 
can easily cause a large Doppler shift. In contrast with the laser radar, in the 
microwave radar systems in which we are interested, it is difficult to observe 
micro-Doppler modulations induced by micro vibrations due to much longer 
wavelengths. However, if the oscillation rate times the displacement of the os-
cillation and the product is high enough, the micro-Doppler modulation of an 
oscillation may be observed. For example, micro-Doppler shifts generated by 
rotations of rotor blades may be detectable because of their longer rotation arms 
and, thus, higher tip speeds. Although the Doppler frequency shifts induced by 
rotating rotor blades have been observed for a long time, not enough attention 
was paid to the time-varying characteristic of the Doppler frequency shifts until 
the joint time-frequency analysis was introduced in radar signal analysis. 
In 1998, when I was working on applications of the joint time-frequency 
analysis to radar imaging and signal analysis, I was given an experimental radar 
data of a walking human where the radar is stationary and the human is mov-
ing. The radar data collected by the stationary radar is actually inverse synthetic 
aperture radar (ISAR) data, and a sequence of range-Doppler ISAR images of 
the walking human can be generated. 
There are a variety of algorithms available for generating focused ISAR 
images. However, any uncompensated motion will cause smearing along the 
range domain in the image, and, if the duration of the coherent processing 

xii 
The Micro-Doppler Effect in Radar  
interval is long, uncompensated motion may generate time-varying Doppler 
frequency shifts that make ISAR images smeared in the Doppler domain. From 
the sequence of range-Doppler images of the walking human, we can clearly see 
a focused hot spot of the human moving along the range at a stable Doppler 
frequency shift related to the walking speed. However, in the range-Doppler 
images, there is smearing along the Doppler domain caused by the uncompen-
sated swinging arms and legs of the walking human. To exploit the details of 
the swinging arms and legs, I applied the joint time-frequency analysis to the 
radar range profiles around the smeared portion. As an immediate result, the 
time-frequency representation clearly showed Doppler oscillations of the arms 
and legs around the Doppler frequency shift of the human body’s translational 
motion. That was the first micro-Doppler signature of a walking human that 
I analyzed and represented in the joint time-frequency domain. The signature 
clearly shows the time-varying frequency distribution caused by the periodic 
motions of the structural components of the human body, such as feet, hands, 
arms, and legs.
The exploitation of micro-Doppler signatures does not necessarily require 
range resolutions. Any continuous wave (CW) radar is good enough to produce 
the micro-Doppler signature of a target, but ISAR range-Doppler images hav-
ing both range and Doppler resolutions are useful in revealing locations of the 
target or its structural components in the range-Doppler domain. That is why 
in this book we prefer to generate micro-Doppler signatures of targets using 
two-dimensional range profiles instead of using a one-dimensional time series. 
From two-dimensional range profiles, after applying motion compensation and 
autofocusing algorithms, a range-Doppler image of the target can be recon-
structed. On the other hand, from uncompensated rotations of the structural 
components in the target, we can also extract micro-Doppler features of the 
target.
In the last decade, numerous articles related to the micro-Doppler ef-
fect in radar have been published. The purpose of this book is to introduce 
principles and theories of the micro-Doppler effect in radar, exploit potential 
applications of micro-Doppler signatures, and provide a simple and easy tool 
for generating micro-Doppler signatures of targets of interest. Apart from the 
analysis of real-world radar data, simulation is an important method for study-
ing the micro-Doppler effect in radar. Based on simulation examples provided 
in this book, readers are encouraged to make modifications and extend the 
simulations to other applications of interest.
In this book, Chapter 1 is an introduction to the micro-Doppler effect in 
radar. The basic concept and mathematics of the micro-Doppler effect in radar 
are given in Chapter 2. In Chapters 3 and 4, some available RCS prediction 
models are introduced for calculating micro-Doppler signatures of rigid and 
nonrigid motions of objects. Several typical examples along with MATLAB

source codes are provided in the chapters. Chapter 5 is devoted to biological 
motion perception and the relationship between biological motion information 
and micro-Doppler signatures. This helps identify a target with kinematic mo-
tion based on its micro-Doppler signature. Chapter 6 summarizes the micro-
Doppler effect in radar and lists some challenges and perspectives in micro-
Doppler research.

Introduction
Radar transmits an electromagnetic (EM) signal to an object and receives a 
returned signal from the object. Based on the time delay of the received sig-
nal, radar can measure the range of the object. If the object is moving, the 
frequency of the received signal will be shifted from the frequency of the trans-
mitted signal, known as the Doppler effect [1, 2]. The Doppler frequency shift 
is determined by the radial velocity of the moving object, that is, the velocity 
component in the direction of the line of sight (LOS). Based on the Doppler 
frequency shift of the received signal, radar can measure the radial velocity of 
the moving object. If the object or any structural component of the object has 
an oscillatory motion in addition to the bulk motion of the object, the oscilla-
tion will induce additional frequency modulation on the returned signal and 
generates side bands about the Doppler shifted frequency of the transmitted 
signal due to the bulk motion. The additional Doppler modulation is called the 
micro-Doppler effect [3–5]. 
The Doppler frequency shift is usually measured in the frequency domain 
by taking the Fourier transform of the received signal. In the Fourier spec-
trum, the peak component indicates the Doppler frequency shift induced by 
the radial velocity of the object’s motion. The width of Doppler frequency shifts 
gives an estimate of the velocity dispersion due to the micro-Doppler effect. To 
accurately track the phase information in the radar received signals, the radar 
transmitter must be driven by a highly stable frequency source to maintain a 
full phase coherency.

The Micro-Doppler Effect in Radar  
The micro-Doppler effect can be used to determine kinematic properties 
of an object. For example, the vibration generated by a vehicle engine can be 
detected from the surface vibration of the vehicle body. By measuring the mi-
cro-Doppler characteristics of the surface vibration, the speed of the engine can 
be measured and used to identify a specific type of vehicle, such as a tank with 
a gas turbine engine or a bus with a diesel engine. The micro-Doppler effect 
observed in an object can be characterized by its signature (i.e., the distinctive 
characteristics of the object that represents the intricate frequency modulation 
generated from the structural components of the object and represented in the 
joint time and Doppler frequency domain). 
1.1 Doppler Effect
In 1842, Austrian mathematician and physicist Christian Doppler stated a phe-
nomenon on the colored light effect of stars [1]. The apparent color of the light 
source is changed by its motion. For a light source moving toward an observer, 
the color of the light would appear bluer, while moving away from an observer, 
the light would appear redder. For the first time, the phenomenon, known as 
the Doppler effect, was discovered. The effect claims that the observed frequen-
cy (or wavelength) of a light source depends on the velocity of the source rela-
tive to the observer. The motion of the source causes the waves in front of the 
source to be compressed and behind the source to be stretched (see Figure 1.1). 
In 1843, the Doppler effect was experimentally proved by sound waves of 
a trumpeter of a train moving at different speeds. The wavelength of the sound 
source is defined by λ = csound /f, where csound is the propagation speed of the sound 
wave in a given medium and f  is the frequency of the sound source. If only the 
source is moving at a velocity vs relative to the medium, the frequency perceived 
by the observer is

If vs  /csound << 1, the Doppler shifted frequency perceived by the observer 
is approximately

The Micro-Doppler Effect in Radar  
1.2 Relativistic Doppler Effect and Time Dilation
Compared to sound waves, there is no medium involved in light or EM wave 
propagation. The propagation speed of light or EM waves, c, viewed from both 
the source and the observer, is the same constant. 
For light or EM waves, changes in the frequency or wavelength caused by 
the relative motion between the source and the observer should count the effect 
of the theory of special relativity [6]. Thus, the Doppler frequency shift must 
be modified to be consistent with the Lorentz transformation. The relativistic 
Doppler effect is different from the classical Doppler effect because it includes 
the time dilation effect of the special relativity and does not involve the medium 
of the wave propagation as a reference point. 
When a light or EM source at a frequency, f, is moving with a velocity vs 
at an angle θs relative to the direction from the source S to the observer O as 
shown in Figure 1.2, the time interval between two successive crests of the wave 
emitted at t1 and t2 is determined by

 is a factor that represents the relativistic time dilation 
and c is the propagation speed of the light or EM waves. Then the time interval 
between the arrivals of the two successive wave crests at the observer is

Thus, the corresponding observed frequency by the observer becomes
 
 
(1.7)
If the angle, 
sθ′ , between the moving direction of the source and the di-
rection from the source to the observer is measured at the time when the wave 
arrives at the observer, the observed frequency by the observer becomes
 
 
(1.8)
Thus, the two angles θs and 
sθ′  are related by
 
 
(1.9)
or
 
 
(1.10)
If both the source and the observer move as illustrated in Figure 1.3 in 
the two-dimensional case, the observed frequency at the time when the wave is 
emitted is similar to (1.4) as
 
 
(1.11)
where θs and θo, as illustrated in Figure 1.3, are the angle of the source moving 
and the angle of the observer moving at the time when the wave is emitted, 
respectively.

v, when the source and the observer move toward each other, the observed

Introduction

This is the same as the classical Doppler frequency shift. Thus, the Dop-
pler frequency shift between the emitted frequency of the source and the per-
ceived frequency by the observer is
 
 
(1.16)
The Doppler frequency shift is proportional to the emitted frequency f  of 
the wave source and the relative velocity v between the source and the observer. 
1.3 Doppler Effect Observed in Radar
In radar, the velocity of a target, v, is usually much slower than the propagation 
speed of the EM wave propagation c, that is, v << c or β = v/c ≈ 0. In monos-
tatic radar systems, where the wave source (radar transmitter) and the receiver 
are at the same location, the round-trip distance traveled by the EM wave is 
twice the distance between the transmitter and the target. In this case, the wave 
movement consists of two segments: traveling from the transmitter to the target 
that produces a Doppler shift (−f v/c), and traveling from the target back to the 
receiver that produces another Doppler shift (−f v/c), where f  is the transmitted 
frequency. Thus, the total Doppler shift becomes
 
 
(1.17)
If the radar is stationary, v will be the radial velocity of the target along the 
LOS of the radar. Velocity is defined to be positive when the object is moving 
away from the radar. As a consequence, the Doppler shift becomes negative.
In a bistatic radar system as shown in the two-dimensional case in Figure 
1.4, the transmitter and receiver are separated by a baseline distance L, which 
is comparable with the maximum range of targets with respect to the transmit-
ter and the receiver. The range from the transmitter to the target is given by 
a vector, rT, and the range from the receiver to the target is given by a vector, 
rR, where a boldface letter is used to denote the vector. The bistatic angle ϕ is 
defined by the angle between the transmitter-to-target line and the receiver-to-
target line. The transmitter look angle is αT and the receiver look angle is αR 
as illustrated in Figure 1.4. The look angle is defined by the angle from a cor-
responding reference vector perpendicular to the transmitter-receiver baseline 
to the target’s LOS vector. The positive angle is defined in a counterclockwise 
direction. Thus, the bistatic angle ϕ = αR − α T .

Then, due to the target’s motion, the range from the transmitter to the 
target is a function of time
 
 
(1.22)
and the range from the receiver to the target is also a function of time
 
 
(1.23)
The phase change between the transmitted signal and the received signal is 
a function of the radar wavelength λ = c /f, the distance from the transmitter to 
the target rT(t), and the distance from the target to the receiver rR(t):
 
 
(1.24)
Then the Doppler frequency shift is measured by the phase change rate. 
By taking the time derivative of the phase change, the bistatic Doppler fre-
quency shift becomes
 
 
(1.25)
In order to track the phase changing with time, the phase of the transmit-
ted signal must be exactly known. Thus, a fully coherent system is required to 
preserve and track the phase change in the received signal. 
In a bistatic radar system, the Doppler shift depends on three factors [7]. 
The first factor is the maximum Doppler shift. If a target is moving with a ve-
locity V, the maximum Doppler shift is
 
 
(1.26)
The second factor is related to the bistatic triangulation factor:

The third factor is related to the angle δ between the direction in which 
the target is moving and the direction of the bisector: C = cosδ. 
Thus, the Doppler shift of a bistatic radar system can be represented by
 
 
(1.28)
If two targets are separated in range and velocity, these targets can be re-
solved by the range resolution and the Doppler resolution of the radar system. 
If in a monostatic radar system the range resolution is known as ΔrMono and the 
Doppler resolution is known as Δ
Mono
D
f
, then the range resolution and the Dop-
pler resolution of a bistatic radar system can be determined by the correspond-
ing monostatic range resolution and Doppler resolution scaled by a function of 
the bistatic angle ϕ. Thus, the bistatic range resolution is 
 
 
(1.29)
and the bistatic Doppler resolution is
 
 
(1.30)
However, in an extreme case where the bistatic angle is near 180°, the 
radar becomes a forward scattering radar [8]. The EM field scattered in the 
forward direction is 180° out of phase with the incident field. Thus, it removes 
power from the incident field and forms a shadow area behind the target. Based 
on (1.28), in the forward scattering case, the bistatic Doppler frequency shift 
becomes zero regardless the actual target velocities. 
1.4 Estimation and Analysis of Doppler Frequency Shifts
Doppler radars utilize the Doppler effect to measure the radial velocity of a tar-
get. The Doppler frequency shift can be extracted by a quadrature detector that 
produces an in-phase (I) component and a quadrature phase (Q) component 
from the input signal as shown in Figure 1.5.

In the quadrature detector, the received signal is split into two mixers 
called synchronous detectors. In the synchronous detector I, the received signal 
is mixed with a reference signal, the transmitted signal; in the other channel it 
is mixed with a 90° shift of the transmitted signal.
If the received signal is expressed as 
 
 
(1.31)
where a is the amplitude of the received signal, f0 is the carrier frequency of the 
transmitter, and ϕ(t) = 2πfDt is the phase shift on the received signal due to the 
target’s motion. By mixing with the transmitted signal

(1.35)
the output of the synchronous detector ΙΙ is
 
 
(1.36)
After lowpass filtering, the Q-channel output is
 
 
(1.37)
Combining the I and Q outputs, a complex Doppler signal can be formed 
by
 
 
(1.38)
Thus, the Doppler frequency shift fD can be estimated from the complex 
Doppler signal sD(t) by using a frequency measurement tool. To estimate the 
Doppler frequency shift of a single sinusoidal signal, the periodogram can be 
used to calculate the spectral density of the signal. Then the maximum likeli-
hood estimation can be applied to locate the maximum of the periodogram [9, 
10]. 
 
 
(1.39)
When the number of samples in the analyzed signal is limited, to estimate 
the signal spectral, the simplest method is to use the fast Fourier transform 
(FFT), which is computationally efficient and easy to implement. However, 
its frequency resolution is limited to the reciprocal of the time interval of the 
signal and suffers from spectrum leakage associated with the time windowing.

Manually increasing the time window with zero padding corresponds to a high-
er interpolation density in the frequency domain, but not a higher frequency 
resolution. The usual way to increase frequency resolution is to take FFT with 
a longer time duration of the analyzed signal without zero padding. However, 
the computation time of the FFT is in the order of O(N ×logN), where N is the 
number of samples in the analyzed signal. For a large number of samples N, the 
FFT is not computationally efficient.
To alleviate the limitations of the FFT, alternative spectral estimation 
methods were proposed [10, 11]. Autoregressive (AR) modeling and eigen-
vector-based methods, such as the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) and 
other super-resolution methods for spectral analysis, can be used in the fre-
quency estimation. However, they either require intensive matrix computations 
or iterative optimization techniques. 
Because the frequency is determined by the time derivative of the phase 
function, the phase difference ϕ(t) between the received and the transmitted 
signal can be used to calculate the Doppler frequency shift fD of the received 
signal
 
 
(1.40)
However, this frequency is an instantaneous frequency, which is only suit-
able for monocomponent or single-tone signals, but not for those containing 
multiple components. To deal with a signal having multiple components, an 
approach that decomposes a multicomponent signal into multiple monocom-
ponent signals may be used. Then the complete time-frequency distribution of 
the multicomponent signal can be derived by computing the instantaneous fre-
quency for each of the monocomponent signals and adding these instantaneous 
frequencies of monocomponent signals together. 
For a single-tone signal in additive Gaussian noise, if the phase differ-
ence Δϕ(k), (k = 1, …, N − 1), from one sample to the next can be tracked, a 
weighted linear combination of these phase differences may be used to estimate 
the sinusoidal frequency tone [12]

This estimation shows that at high SNR, the frequency estimation attains 
the Cramer-Rao lower bound as described in Section 1.5. 
To preserve and track the phase of the received signals, the frequency 
source in the transmitter must keep a very high phase stability. Therefore, the 
radar must be fully coherent to keep an accurate phase coherency. 
From the estimated Doppler frequency, the radial velocity of the target is 
determined by 
 
 
(1.43)
The I and Q outputs of the quadrature detector can also be used to deter-
mine whether the target is approaching to or away from the radar. As illustrated 
in Figure 1.6, by comparing the relative phase between the I-channel and the 
90°-shifted Q-channel, two flow channels—one is “approaching” to the radar 
and the other is “away” from the radar, can be produced.
Doppler radars include pure continuous wave (CW) radar without mod-
ulations, frequency modulated continuous wave (FM-CW) radar, and coherent 
pulsed Doppler radar. Pure CW radars can only measure the velocity. FM-CW 
and coherent pulsed Doppler radars can have wide frequency bandwidth to

gain a high-range resolution and measure both the range and Doppler infor-
mation. Coherent Doppler radars retain the phase of the transmitted signals 
and track the phase changes in the received signals. Doppler frequency shift is 
proportional to the phase change rate. If the phase change is more than ±π, the 
estimated Doppler frequency becomes ambiguous and is called Doppler alias-
ing. This is caused by discrete time sampling of a continuous time signal. Sam-
pling process can be represented by the multiplication of the continuous time 
signal s(t) with a sequence of delta functions δ(t). Taking the Fourier transform 
of the time sampled signal, the discrete time sampled signal is transformed to 
the frequency domain represented by a discrete form of the Fourier transform:
 
 
(1.44)
where Δt is the time-sampling interval, the convolution operator ⊗ in the fre-
quency domain makes the signal spectrum S(f  ) to be replicated at a period 
of 1/Δt. If the frequency bandwidth of the signal spectrum is greater than the 
Nyquist frequency 1/(2Δt), or the sampling rate is lower than the half band-
width of the signal, this replication will cause the signal spectrum to overlap and 
produce ambiguity, called aliasing. 
Figure 1.7 illustrates the aliasing phenomenon. The frequency modulat-
ed signal is sampled with sampling rate lower than the Nyquist rate ± Δ
1
2 t . 
Spectrum aliasing can be seen clearly in Figure 1.7(a). Time-varying frequency 
spectrum of the signal is shown in Figure 1.7(c), where modulated frequency 
values in excess of the Nyquist rate ± Δ
1
2 t  are aliasing. The aliasing causes the 
true frequency values to be offset by multiples of (1/Δt) until they fall into 
the Nyquist cointerval. For example, if the Nyquist frequency is ±1,000 Hz, a 
frequency value of +1,500 Hz is aliased to +1,500 Hz − 2 × 1,000 Hz = −500 
Hz and −1,500 Hz is aliased to −1,500 Hz + 2 × 1,000 Hz = +500 Hz. In this 
case, the true frequency values are offset by one multiple of (1/Δt) to fall into 
the Nyquist interval as illustrated in Figure 1.7(c).
To resolve the aliasing ambiguity, increasing the sampling rate or tech-
niques that interpolate missing data points may be applied. Figure 1.7(b) is 
the spectrum of the same signal sampled with the twice sampling rate. The 
time-varying spectrum with twice the sampling rates is shown in Figure 1.7(d), 
where the full time-varying spectrum is restored.
Generally, the required unambiguous radial velocity must be at least the 
radial velocity with which the target moves. Thus, the unambiguous velocity 
that a radar can be measured depends on the transmitted frequency f or wave-
length λ = c/f and the time interval Δt between two sampling points

For the coherent pulsed radar, which measures both the velocity and

(1.47)
Ranges greater than the rmax are folded into the first range region. Without 
additional information, the correct range information cannot be determined. 
The PRF is proportional to the maximum unambiguous velocity, but in-
versely proportional to the maximum range being measured. A compromise 
between the maximum range and maximum velocity is always desirable. The 
maximum velocity can be extended by using two alternating PRFs. Since the 
maximum velocity is related to the wavelength, a longer wavelength or a lower 
frequency can increase the limit of the maximum velocity. 
However, the product of the maximum unambiguous velocity and the 
unambiguous range
 
 
(1.48)
is not directly related by the PRF. It is only determined by the frequency f or 
the wavelength λ. Given a frequency band, the product of the maximum un-
ambiguous velocity and the unambiguous range is a constant. Increasing the 
maximum unambiguous velocity will decreasing the maximum unambiguous 
range and vice versa. The trade-off between the unambiguous velocity and un-
ambiguous range is often referred to as the Doppler dilemma.
In pulsed radars, to avoid aliasing, very high PRF should be selected; to 
avoid ambiguous range, very low PRF is required. However, the low PRF also 
limits the extracted Doppler information. To have a suitable range ambiguity 
and aliasing, multiple PRFs are often used.
1.5 Cramer-Rao Bound of the Doppler Frequency Estimation
In practice, the Doppler frequency estimation is considered in the presence of 
noise. From the estimation theory, to estimate the value of an unknown param-
eter θ from N noisy measurements, if the expected value of the estimate equals 
the true value of the parameter

, where ε 
is an arbitrary small positive number), this is a consistent estimator. 
The benchmark that evaluates the variance of a particular unbiased esti-
mator can be described by the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) that provides 
a lower bound on the variance of a linear or nonlinear unbiased estimator and 
gives an insight into the performance of the estimator [13, 14]. It states that the 
variance of an unbiased estimator is at least as high as the inverse of the Fisher 
information. 
If an unknown deterministic parameter θ is estimated from the N statisti-
cal measurements xk (k = 1, .., N) with the probability density function of p(xk; 
θ), the variance of the unbiased estimation 
θˆ
var{ } is bounded by the inverse of 
the Fisher information I(θ), that is,
 
 
(1.49)
The Fisher information is defined by
 
 
(1.50)
where E{•} means the expectation value that is taken with respect to p(xk; θ) and 
results in a function of θ. 
To estimate a single sinusoidal Doppler frequency in white Gaussian 
noise, the Fisher information can be inverted easily. The CRLB of the Doppler 
frequency estimation can be derived as
 
 
(1.51)
where SNR is the signal-to-noise ratio and N is the number of samples of the 
signal [14].
1.6 The Micro-Doppler Effect
The micro-Doppler effect was originally introduced in coherent laser (light am-
plification by stimulated emission of radiation) radar systems [5]. Laser detec-
tion and ranging (LADAR) system transmits EM wave at optical frequencies to 
an object and receives the reflected or backscattered light wave to measure the

object’s range, velocity, and other properties through modulations of its laser 
beam by amplitude, frequency, phase, and even polarization. 
Coherent LADAR, which preserves the phase information of the scat-
tered light wave with respect to a reference laser wave generated in the local 
oscillator, has greater sensitivity to phase changing and is capable of measuring 
object velocity from the phase change rate. 
In a coherent system, because the phase of a returned signal from an ob-
ject is sensitive to the variation in range, a half-wavelength change in range 
can cause 360° phase change. For LADAR with a wavelength of 2 μm, a 1-μm 
range variation can cause a 360° phase change. In the case of vibration, if the 
vibration frequency is fv and the amplitude of the vibration is Dv, the maximum 
Doppler frequency variation is determined by
 
 
(1.52)
As a consequence, in a high-frequency system, even with a very low vibra-
tion rate fv, a very small vibration amplitude Dv can cause a large phase change, 
and thus, Doppler frequency shifts can be easily detected. 
In many cases, an object or any structural component of the object may 
have oscillatory motion, which can be called the micro motion. The term “micro 
motion” defined here includes a broader usage of the “micro,” such that in ad-
dition to the bulk motion of the object, any oscillatory motion of the object or 
any structural component of the object can be called the micro motion. The 
source of micro motion may be a rotating propeller of a fixed-wing aircraft, the 
rotating rotor blades of a helicopter, a rotating antenna, the flapping wings of 
birds, a walking person with swinging arms and legs, or other causes. 
Human motion is an important topic in micro-Doppler study. Human 
articulated motion is accomplished by a series of motion of human body parts. 
It is a complex micro motion due to high articulation and flexibility. Walking is 
a typical example of human articulated motion. 
Micro motion induces frequency modulations on the carrier frequency 
of radar transmitted signals. For a pure periodic vibration or rotation, micro 
motion generates side-band Doppler frequency shifts about the center of the 
Doppler shifted carrier frequency. The modulation contains harmonic frequen-
cies determined by the carrier frequency, the vibration or rotation rate, and the 
angle between the direction of vibration and the direction of the incident wave. 
The frequency modulation enables us to determine the kinematic properties of 
the object of interest. Although the use of a propeller or rotor blade modulation 
and jet-engine modulation for target identification has been proposed for a long 
time, the methods of how to represent the time-varying frequency modulation

The Micro-Doppler Effect in Radar  
target from the signature, and how to use the signature for target identification 
are still new research tasks.
1.7 Micro-Doppler Effect Observed in Radar
The micro-Doppler effect is sensitive to the frequency band of the signal. For a 
radar system operating at the microwave frequency bands, the micro-Doppler 
effect may be observable if the product of the target’s oscillation rate and the 
displacement of the oscillation is high enough. For a radar operating at the X-
band with a 3-cm wavelength, a vibration rate of 15 Hz with a displacement 
of 0.3 cm can induce a detectable maximum micro-Doppler frequency shift 
of 18.8 Hz. If the radar is operated at the L-band with a 10-cm wavelength, 
to achieve the same maximum micro-Doppler shift of 18.8 Hz, for the same 
vibration rate of 15 Hz, the required displacement must be 1 cm, which may 
be too large to be achieved in practice. Therefore, in radar systems operating at 
lower-frequency bands, micro-Doppler shifts generated by vibration may not 
be detectable. However, micro-Doppler shifts generated by rotations, such as 
rotating rotor blades, may be detectable because of their longer rotation arms 
and higher tip speeds.
The UHF-band radar operating at a frequency band of 300–1,000 MHz 
is widely used for foliage penetration (FOPEN) to detect targets under trees. In 
FOPEN radars, the micro-Doppler shift induced by target’s vibrations is usual-
ly too small to be detected. However, it is still possible to detect micro-Doppler 
shifts generated by rotating rotor blades or propellers. For a radar operating at 
the UHF-band with a 0.6-m wavelength, if a helicopter’s rotor blade rotates 
with a tip speed of 200 m/s, its maximum micro-Doppler shift can reach 666 
Hz and it is certainly detectable.
1.8 Estimation and Analysis of Micro-Doppler Frequency Shifts
The micro-Doppler shift is a time-varying frequency shift that can be extracted 
from the complex output signal of a quadrature detector used in the conven-
tional Doppler processing. For analyzing time-varying frequency features, the 
Fourier transform is not suitable because it cannot provide time-dependent fre-
quency information. The commonly used analysis methods to describe a signal 
simultaneously in the time and frequency domains are the instantaneous fre-
quency analysis and the joint time-frequency analysis. 
The terminology of the instantaneous frequency defined by the time de-
rivative of the phase function in a time-varying signal has been argued decades 
ago because the amplitude and phase functions are not unique. A well-accepted

instantaneous frequency definition uses a pair of Hilbert transform to form the 
real part and the imaginary part of an analytic signal [15]. Thus, the instanta-
neous term means in the sense of the present time instant, and its measurement 
requires only the knowledge of the analyzed signal over the past and not from 
the future. 
The instantaneous frequency derived by the time-derivative operation 
yields only one value of frequency at a given time instant. This means it is only 
suitable for monocomponent signals but not for multicomponent signals. A 
monocomponent signal is narrowband at any time and has energy in a contigu-
ous portion in the joint time-frequency domain. Conversely, a multicomponent 
signal has energy in multiple isolated frequency bands at the same time instant. 
To deal with multicomponent signals, an obvious approach is to decompose the 
multicomponent signal into multiple addable monocomponent signal compo-
nents [16]. The complete time-frequency distribution of the signal is obtained 
by computing the instantaneous frequencies for each component signal and 
adding these individual instantaneous frequencies together. 
The joint time-frequency analysis has been used for decades for analyzing 
the time-varying frequency spectrum. It is designed to localize the energy distri-
bution of a given signal in the two-dimensional time and frequency domains. It 
is quite suitable for not only monocomponent signals but also multicomponent 
signals. 
1.8.1 
Instantaneous Frequency Analysis
For a real valued signal s(t), its associated complex valued signal z(t) is defined 
by
 
 
(1.53)
where H{•} is the Hilbert transform of the signal given by
 
 
(1.54)
z(t) is called the analytic signal associated with s(t), a(t) is the amplitude func-
tion, and ϕ(t) is the phase function of the analytic signal. In the frequency do-
main, the Fourier transform of the analytic signal, Z(f  ), is single-sided with zero 
values in the negative frequencies and double values in the positive frequencies. 
Thus, the instantaneous frequency of the signal z(t) is the time derivative of the 
uniquely defined phase function ϕ(t) of the analytic signal

The Micro-Doppler Effect in Radar  
 
 
(1.55)
In practice, a discrete real-valued signal s(n) and samples at time instants 
t = nΔt, n = 1, 2, …, N may be used. Then the discrete analytic signal z(n) 
becomes
 
 
(1.56)
For a discrete signal, the instantaneous frequency is similar to (1.55), but 
with discrete derivatives of the phase, which can be estimated by using the cen-
tral finite difference equation of the phase function [17]:
 
 
(1.57)
where Δt is the sampling interval, [ • ]2π represents the reduction modulo 2π, 
and n is the discrete number of time samples.
Instantaneous frequency only gives one value at a time and is only good for 
describing signals comprised of a single oscillating frequency component at one 
time. It is not suitable for signals having several different oscillating frequency 
components at one time. To distinguish frequency contributions of a multi-
component signal, it is necessary to preprocess the multicomponent signal into 
its monocomponent elements. Huang et al. [16] introduced the concept of 
empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to separate a multicomponent signal 
into monocomponent constituents by a progressive sifting process to yield the 
bases called the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Later, Olhede and Walden 
[18] introduced a wavelet packet-based decomposition as a replacement of the 
EMD in preprocessing the multicomponent signal. 
The EMD adaptively decomposes a signal into a limited number of zero-
mean, narrowband IMFs. Then the instantaneous frequency of each IMF is 
calculated by using the normalized Hilbert transform, called the Hilbert-Huang 
transform (HHT) [16]. The combination of the Hilbert spectrum is the com-
plete time-varying frequency spectrum. 
The original formulation of the EMD can only be applied to real-valued 
signals. However, in radar applications, signals are always complex with I and 
Q parts. The extension of the EMD to handle complex values signals has been 
proposed in [19, 20]. The detailed procedure of calculating complex EMD and 
HHT with MATLAB codes can be obtained from [21].

1.8.2 
Joint Time-Frequency Analysis
When the spectral composition of a signal varies as a function of time, the 
conventional Fourier transform cannot provide a time-dependent spectral de-
scription. Thus, a joint time-frequency analysis provides more insight into the 
time-varying behavior of the signal. 
Motivated by defining the information content in a signal, in 1948, Den-
nis Gabor, a Hungarian Nobel laureate, proposed the first algorithm on time-
frequency analysis of an arbitrary signal [22]. Gabor suggested that the time 
and frequency characteristics of a signal s(t) can be simultaneously observed by 
using the expansion
 
 
(1.58)
where G(g, n, m), called the Gabor function, is expressed in terms of a Gaussian 
window g(t) by
 
 
(1.59)
ΔT and ΔF are the time and frequency lattice intervals, respectively, and 
the Gaussian window is defined by
 
 
(1.60)
Gabor claimed that the basis functions G(•) used in this time-frequency 
decomposition have the minimum area in the joint time-frequency plane.
Spectrogram is a widely used method to display time-varying spectral 
density of a time-varying signal. It is a spectro-temporal representation and 
provides the actual change of frequency contents of a signal over time. The 
spectrogram is calculated by using the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) 
and represented by the squared magnitude of the STFT without keeping phase 
information of the signal
 
 
(1.61)
STFT performs the Fourier transform on a short-time window basis rath-
er than taking the Fourier transform to the entire signal using one long-time 
window.

The Micro-Doppler Effect in Radar  
With the time-limited window function, the resolution of the STFT is 
determined by the window size. There is a trade-off between the time resolution 
and the frequency resolution. A larger window has a higher-frequency resolu-
tion but a poorer time resolution. The Gabor transform is a typical short-time 
Fourier transform using Gaussian windowing and has the minimal product of 
the time resolution and the frequency resolution. 
To better analyze the time-varying micro-Doppler frequency characteris-
tics and visualize the localized joint time and frequency information, the sig-
nal must be analyzed by using a high-resolution time-frequency transform to 
characterize the spectral and temporal behavior of the signal. Bilinear trans-
forms, such as the Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD), are high-resolution time-
frequency transforms. The WVD of a signal s(t) is defined by the Fourier trans-
form of the time-dependent autocorrelation function

 can be interpreted as a time-dependent autocorre-
lation function. The bilinear WVD has a better joint time-frequency resolu-
tion than any linear transform, such as the STFT. However, it suffers from the 
problem of cross-term interference (i.e., the WVD of the sum of two signals 
is not the sum of their individual WVDs). If a signal contains more than one 
component in the joint time-frequency domain, its WVD will contain cross-
terms that occur halfway between each pair of autoterms. The magnitude of 
these oscillatory cross-terms can be twice as large as the autoterms. To reduce 
the cross-term interference, filtered WVDs have been used to preserve the use-
ful properties of the time-frequency transform with a slightly reduced time-
frequency resolution and a largely reduced cross-term interference. The WVD 
with a linear lowpass filter belongs to the Cohen class [23].
The general form of the Cohen class is defined by
 
 
(1.63)
The Fourier transform of the lowpass filter ψ(t, τ), denoted as Ψ(θ, τ), 
is called the kernel function. If Ψ(θ, τ) = 1, then ψ(t, τ) = δ(t) and the Cohen 
class reduces to the WVD. The Cohen class with different kernel functions, 
such as the pseudo-Wigner, the smoothed pseudo-Wigner-Ville (SPWV), the

Choi-Williams distribution, and the cone kernel distribution, can be used to 
largely reduce the cross-term interference in the WVD.
Other useful high-resolution time-frequency transforms are the adaptive 
Gabor representation and the time-frequency distribution series [24]. They de-
compose a signal into a family of basis functions, such as the Gabor function, 
which is well localized in both the time and the frequency domains and adap-
tive to match the local behavior of the analyzed signal. 
In contrast with the EMD method, the adaptive Gabor representation is a 
signal-adaptive decomposition. It decomposes a signal s(t) into the Gabor basis 
functions hp(t) with an adjustable standard deviation σp and a time-frequency 
center (tp, fp):
 
 
(1.64)
where 
 
 
(1.65)
The coefficients Bp are found by an iterative procedure beginning with 
the stage p = 1 and choosing the parameters σp, tp, and fp such that hp(t) is most 
similar to s(t):
 
 
(1.66)
where s0(t) = s(t), that is, the analyzed signal is taken as the initial signal for p = 
1. For p >1, sp(t) is the residual after the orthogonal projection of sp−1(t) onto hp 
(t) has been removed from the signal:
 
 
(1.67)
This procedure is iterated to generate as many coefficients as needed to 
accurately represent the original signal. Finally, the time-dependent spectrum 
is obtained by

The Micro-Doppler Effect in Radar  
The well-known MATLAB time-frequency toolbox developed at the 
CNRS (Centre National de la Recherche Scientique) of France is a collection 
of time-frequency analysis tools [25]. It includes many commonly used linear 
and bilinear time-frequency distributions and can be used to compute micro-
Doppler signatures represented in the joint time-frequency domain. However, 
this time-frequency toolbox was designed for analytic signals. Thus, rescaling 
the frequency scale in the output time-frequency representations is needed if 
the input signal is a complex I and Q signal.
1.9 The Micro-Doppler Signature of Objects
The term “signature” is commonly used to refer to the characteristic expres-
sion of an object or a process. For example, the characteristic mode in different 
ocean basins is called a signature of climate phenomenon, such as ENSO and 
El Nino. In Doppler weather radars, a special pattern of strong outbound and 
inbound winds is called the signature of a tornado.
When examining the Doppler phenomenon in an object, distinctive mi-
cro-Doppler characteristics provide evidence of the identity of the movement of 
the object. The micro-Doppler signature is the distinctive characteristics of the 
object’s movement. It is an intricate frequency modulation represented in the 
joint time and Doppler frequency domain, and it is the distinctive characteris-
tics that give an object its identity. 
Figure 1.8 shows the micro-Doppler signature of a rotating air-launched 
cruise missile (ALCM) provided in the simulation software in [26, 27]. The 
length of the cruise missile is 6.4m and its wingspan is about 3.4m. A burst of a 
1-μs chirp pulse radar operating in the X-band is assumed to simulate the EM 
backscattering field. The radar transmits 8,192 pulses with the pulse repetition 
interval of 67 μs during a period of 0.55 second to cover the total target’s rota-
tion angle of 360°. The simulated radar I and Q data from the rotating ALCM 
is provided in the companion MATLAB micro-Doppler signature analysis tools  
on the DVD with this book.
The micro-Doppler features of the rotating ALCM can be observed in 
the frequency domain and with a much more clear view in the joint time-
frequency domain [28]. Figure 1.8(b) shows the joint time-frequency micro-
Doppler signature of the rotating ALCM. For comparison, the conventional 
Fourier spectrum is shown in Figure 1.8(a). Recall that the missile rotating rate 
is about 1.8 cycle/second because it takes 0.55 second to complete a rotation of 
360°. For the ALCM model, (1) the missile head tip, (2) head joint, (3) wing 
joint, (4) turbine engine intake, (5) tail fin and tail plane, and (6) tail tip and 
engine exhaust are located at about −2.5m, −1.8m, 0.2m, 2.5m, 3.5m, and 
4.2m, respectively, off the pivot point at 0. If these parts are considered to be the 

 
Introduction 
27
dominant scatterers, the maximum Doppler shifts induced by rotations of these 
parts would appear at those positions when their angular velocities are nearly 
in parallel with the radar LOS, when the missile is at a 90° or 270° aspect to 
the radar, or at the elapsed time of 0.14 second or 0.41 second, respectively, as 
shown in Figure 1.8(b). When the missile is at a 90° aspect, the induced Dop-
pler shifts are −1,917 Hz, −1,380 Hz, 153 Hz, 1,917 Hz, 2,684 Hz, and 3,217 
Hz, respectively. For these dominant scatterers, the traces of induced Doppler 
shifts by rotations are clearly shown in Figure 1.8(b). At the aspects from 180° 
to 90° and from 180° to 270°, the induced Doppler shifts of the ALCM model 
have the same magnitudes but with opposite signs. The same motion kinemat-
ics is also seen at the missile aspects from 0° to 90° and from 360° to 270°. 
These Doppler shifts gradually reduce to zero when their moving directions 
are perpendicular to the radar LOS (i.e., when the missiles are approximately 
at 180° and 360° aspects). Notice that the induced Doppler shifts are further 
dispersed for two scatterers near the missile tail where two turbines are located. 
Thus, the missile kinematic motion can be well characterized by its micro-
Doppler signature, which can be used to identify distinctive target features. The

The Micro-Doppler Effect in Radar  
MATLAB source code for calculating the micro-Doppler signature of a rotating 
ALCM is listed in Appendix 1A and can be used as a micro-Doppler signature 
analysis tool.
In recent years, micro-Doppler signatures have been applied to various 
targets to extract features and detect and identify targets of interest. Among the 
numerous references on the micro-Doppler effect in radar, a few of them con-
tributed to theoretical properties of the micro-Doppler effect in radar [5, 29–
31] and some of them contributed to the extension from monostatic to bistatic 
and multistatic micro-Doppler features [32, 33]. Many other references con-
tributed to processing and analyzing micro-Doppler signatures of rigid bodies 
with oscillatory motion and nonrigid bodies with articulated motion [34–54]. 
Target classification, recognition, and identification based on micro-Doppler 
signatures are also important topics and have been investigated [55–63].
The basic concept of the micro-Doppler effect in radar, the basic math-
ematics of the micro-Doppler effect, and the mathematic representations of 
micro-Doppler shifts induced by the target’s vibration, rotation, and coning 
motion are introduced in Chapter 2.
In simulation study of the micro-Doppler effect in radar, the first step 
is to generate micro-Doppler signatures of a target of interest. To do this, a 
suitable motion model of the target must first be defined. The next step is to 
model the radar scattering from the target. Thus, a suitable radar cross section 
(RCS) model of the target should be determined. In Chapters 3 and 4, the 
simplest point-scatterer model and a more accurate RCS prediction model are 
introduced to calculate the micro-Doppler signatures of targets, and examples 
of MATLAB source codes for calculating radar scattering are provided.
Chapter 5 introduces the biological motion perception and the relation-
ship between biological motion information and micro-Doppler signatures, 
which leads to the possible identification of targets’ movements with their mi-
cro-Doppler signatures.
Chapter 6 summarizes the micro-Doppler effect in radar introduced in 
this book and lists some challenges and perspectives in micro-Doppler research.

Basics of the Micro-Doppler Effect in 
Radar
The micro-Doppler effect induced by the micro motion of an object or struc-
tures on the object can be formulated from physics and mathematics points 
of view. The physics of the micro-Doppler effect is derived directly from the 
theory of the EM scattering field. The mathematics of the micro-Doppler effect 
is derived by introducing micro motion to the conventional Doppler analysis.
Before analyzing radar scattering from an object with micro motion, the 
basic principle of rigid body and nonrigid body motions and radar scattering 
from an object with motion will be introduced.
2.1 Rigid Body Motion
An object can be a rigid body or a nonrigid body. A rigid body is a solid body 
with a finite size, but without deformation (i.e., the distance between any two 
particles of the body does not vary during any motion). This is an idealization, 
but it efficiently simplifies simulation and analysis.
The mass of a rigid body, M, is the sum of its particle masses, 
= ∑
,
k
k
M
m  
where mk is the mass of the k-particle. The general motion of a rigid body is 
a combination of translations (i.e., the parallel motion of all particles in the 
body) and rotations (i.e., the circular motion of all particles in the body about 
an axis) [1–3]. 
To describe the motion of a rigid body, two coordinate systems are com-
monly used, as shown in Figure 2.1: the global or space-fixed system (X, Y, Z ) 
and the local or body-fixed system (x, y, z), which is rigidly fixed in the body. 
The range vector R is from the origin of the spaced-fixed system to the origin 

36 
The Micro-Doppler Effect in Radar  
of the body-fixed system. Let the origin of the body-fixed system be the center 
of mass (CM) of the body. Then, the orientation of the axes of the body-fixed 
system relative to the axes of the space-fixed system is given by three indepen-
dent angles. Therefore, the rigid body becomes a mechanical system with six 
degrees of freedom. Let r denote the position of an arbitrary particle P in the 
body-fixed system. Then its position in the space-fixed system is given by r + 
R, and its velocity is
 
 
(2.1)
where V is the translation velocity of the CM of the rigid body and  is the 
angular velocity of the body rotation. The direction of  is along the axis of 
rotation. Thus, a rigid body motion consists of a bulk translational motion and 
the rotation and/or vibration of the body. As defined in Chapter 1, the rotation 
and vibration of a body can also be called the micro motion of the body. 
To represent the orientation of an object, Euler angles, rotation matrices, 
and quaternions are the commonly used representations. 
2.1.1 
Euler Angles
In a rigid body, the rotation about an axis can be described by the rotation axis 
and the rotation angle using a vector of angular velocity  . The direction of 
the vector is along the rotation axis. The rotation about an axis can also be de-
scribed by three rotations about coordinate axes. Euler’s rotation theorem states

that any two independent orthonormal coordinates are related by a sequence of 
rotations about coordinate axes [1–4]. There are 12 different sequences avail-
able to represent an orientation with Euler angles. They are x-y-z, x-z-y, x-y-x, 
x-z-x, y-x-z, y-z-x, y-x-y, y-z-y, z-x-y, z-y-x, z-x-z, and z-y-z. The sequence may 
use the same axis twice but not successively. The order in a rotation sequence is 
important because the matrix multiplication is not commutative. 
The rotation angles (ϕ, θ, ψ) are called the Euler angles, where ϕ is de-
fined as the counterclockwise rotation about the z-axis, θ is defined as the coun-
terclockwise rotation about the y-axis, and ψ is defined as the counterclockwise 
rotation about the x-axis. Euler angles are commonly used to represent three 
successive rotations in a given rotation sequence. The first step of the rotation 
sequence rotates the coordinates (x, y, z) to the new coordinates (x1, y1, z1). 
The second step changes the new coordinates to (x2, y2, z2), and the third step 
transforms this coordinates to the final coordinates (x3, y3, z3), as illustrated in 
Figure 2.2.
Some conventions regarding successive rotation sequence are most com-
monly used. In aerospace engineering, to describe a flying aircraft heading in 
the x-axis, with its left side toward the y-axis and the upper side to the z-axis, 
three angles rotating about the x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis, called the roll-pitch-yaw 
convention, are commonly used as illustrated in Figure 2.3. Pitch or attitude is 
defined by the rotation of θ between −π/2 and π/2 about the y-axis from the 
pilot’s right side toward the left side, and, thus, the nose of the aircraft pitches 
up or down. Roll or bank is defined by the rotation of ψ between –π and π 
about the longitudinal x-axis of the aircraft from the aircraft tail to its nose. Yaw 
or heading is defined by the rotation of ϕ between –π and π about the vertical 
z-axis of the aircraft from the bottom toward the top of the aircraft and perpen-
dicular to the other two axes.
Another commonly used rotation sequence is called the x-convention in 
classical mechanics. It follows the z-x-z sequence that takes the first rotation by 
an angle about the z-axis, the second rotation by an angle about the x-axis, and 
the third rotation by an angle about the z-axis again. 
Figure 2.2 Euler angles commonly used to represent three successive rotations.

38 
The Micro-Doppler Effect in Radar  
Given a specific rotation sequence, the rotation matrix is a useful tool for 
calculating rigid body rotations. Any rigid body specified by its orientation and 
rotation can be described by its rotation matrix, which can be represented by a 
product of three elemental rotations defined by the three rotation angles.
For the roll-pitch-yaw or x-y-z sequence, the rotation is in the roll-pitch-
yaw (ψ-θ-ϕ) sequence. The first step is rotating about the x-axis x = [1 0 0]T by 
an angle ψ defined by the elemental rotation matrix:
 
 
(2.2)
The second step is rotating about the new y-axis: y1 = [0 cosψ sinψ]T by an 
angle θ defined by the elemental rotation matrix:
 
 
(2.3)
The third step is rotating about the new z-axis: z2 = [−sinθ cosθsinψ 
cosθcosψ]T by an angle ϕ defined by the elemental rotation matrix:

The Micro-Doppler Effect in Radar  
For the x-convention with the z-x-z sequence, the first step is rotating 
about the z-axis z = [0 0 1]T by an angle ϕ defined by the elemental rotation 
matrix Z. The second step is rotating about the new x-axis: x1 = [cosϕ −sinϕ 
0]T by an angle   defined by the elemental rotation matrix X. The third step is 
rotating about the new z-axis: z2 = [cosϕcosθ sinϕcosθ −sinϕ]T by an angle ψ 
defined by the elemental rotation matrix Z again. Then the rotation matrix of

This means that the three-column vector of the rotation matrix must be 
orthonormal. 
Although the Euler angle rotation matrices are mathematically simpler 
to handle and easier to understand, they have a problem called the gimbal lock 
[4, 7]. The gimbal lock happens when two of the coordinate axes align to each 
other. It results in a temporary loss of one degree of freedom. This phenomenon 
happens on Earth when an object is at the North Pole or at the South Pole. 
For example, in the x-y-z sequence, when the rotation angle about the y-axis 
(pitch angle) θ = π/2, the y-axis, the x-axis and the z-axis will collapse onto one 
another, and therefore, one degree of freedom will be lost. Recall (2.5) through 
(2.8), when the rotation angle about the y-axis (pitch angle) θ = π/2, the rota-
tion matrix becomes

If ψ = 0, the rotation matrix is

lost. In this case, there are only two degrees of freedom. Thus, the gimbal lock 
makes an unexpected and limited movement. 
However, an alternative that uses quaternion algebra instead of the Euler 
angle rotation matrices can eliminate the gimbal lock. Quaternions are com-
monly used in computer graphics for representing orientation in 3-D space. 
Instead of using three rotation angles, the quaternion represents an arbitrary 
orientation by a rotation about a unit axis through a certain angle. 
2.1.2 
Quaternion
The problem associated with the Euler rotation matrices comes from the trigo-
nometric function operation. When the Euler angle reaches ±π/2, the numeri-
cal singularity may occur. Quaternion algebra alleviates the singularity by using 
rotation around an axis instead of using the yaw, pitch, and roll angular rotation 
[4, 7]. By using the quaternion, there is only a single axis of rotation and it does 
not require predefined Euler angle sequences. Thus, no degree of freedom can 
be lost. 
A quaternion uses a four-component vector to represent 3-D orientation. 
The real part is a scalar rotation angle α, and the imaginary part is a vector with 
x, y, z coordinates. If a point at (x1, y1, z1) in a 3-D space P1 = x1· i + y1 · j + z1· 
k rotates through an angle α about a unit axis e = q1 · i + q2 · j + q3 · k = (q1, 
q2, q3), the resulting point can be represented by the following transformation 
formula [6]:
 
 
(2.18)
where q(α, e) = [cos(α/2), e ⋅ sin(α/2)] is the quaternion representing the rota-
tion about the unit vector e by an angle α. A translation can be represented by 
P2 = q + P1.
The quaternion can also be represented by four components as
 
 
(2.19)
where q0 = cos(α/2), q1 = xsin(α/2), q2 = ysin(α/2), and q3 = zsin(α/2) with the

The conjugate of a quaternion, conj(q), is a quaternion that has the same 
magnitudes, but the signs of the imaginary parts are changed:
 
 
(2.20)
Multiplying a quaternion by its conjugate makes a real number: q · conj(q) 
= real number. The norm of a quaternion is defined by

It should be noticed that quaternions are not commutative under the

(2.25)
In some applications, if the Euler angles are already given, they can be 
used along with quaternions to take the advantage of the quaternion. Euler 
angles can be easily converted to quaternions. Any of the Euler angle conven-
tions can be performed with quaternions. Using quaternion components, each 
roll, pitch, and yaw rotation is described by qroll = [cos(ψ/2), sin(ψ/2), 0, 0], qpitch 
= [cos(θ/2), 0, sin(θ/2), 0] and qroll = [cos(ϕ/2), 0, 0, sin(ϕ/2)].
With the x-y-z sequence, given the roll, pitch, and yaw angles (ψ, θ, ϕ), 
the quaternion is [6]:
 
 
(2.26)
where
 
 
(2.27)
The quaternion can also be converted to Euler angles by first converting 
the quaternion to a matrix and then converting the matrix to Euler angles. 
However, if the quaternion combined with Euler angles is not used prop-
erly, the gimbal lock can still occur because of the use of three rotations.

Equations of Motion
A rigid body in motion is described by its kinematics and dynamics [1, 3]. 
The kinematics of the rigid body motion describes the relation between the 
position, speed, and acceleration of the body motion without considering what 
forces cause the motion. The dynamics or kinetics of the rigid body motion de-

scribes motion of the body and the forces that affect the motion. The dynamic 
energy of a body is given by [1–3]

where mk, vk, and rk denote the mass, velocity, and the position of a point k in 
the body-fixed system where

of the translation velocity of the rigid body, and Ω = ||Ω|| is the norm of the

Thus, the dynamic energy of a rigid body is the sum of the dynamic energy of 
the translational motion of the CM, the ECM, and the dynamic energy of the 
rigid body rotation about the CM, ERot. 
In the rigid body motion, the rotation plays a critical role. Given the an-
gular momentum about the CM of a rigid body defined by
 
 
(2.29)
the dynamic energy of the rotating body can be expressed as
 
 
(2.30)
where Ωj is the component of  along the j-axis of the body-fixed system, rk is 
expressed by [(rk)1, (rk)2, (rk)3], and Ii,j is the inertia tensor defined by

By an appropriate choice of the orientation of the body-fixed coordinate 
system, the moment inertia tensor can be reduced to a diagonal form. In this 
case, the directions of the axes are called the principal axes of the moment in-
ertia tensor, and the diagonal components of the tensor are called the principal 
moments of inertia. Then the kinetic energy of the rotating body becomes
 
 
(2.33)
and the angular momentum vector L becomes
 
 
(2.34)
where [e1, e2, e3] is the unit vector in the directions of the principal axes, [Ω1, 
Ω2, Ω3] and [L1, L2, L3] are the angular velocity vector and the angular momen-
tum vector along the principal axes, respectively.
The Euler equation of motion is derived by taking the time derivative of 
the angular momentum. In the rotating body-fixed coordinates, the time de-
rivative of the angular momentum is replaced by
 
 
(2.35)
In the space-fixed coordinates, the time derivative of the angular momen-
tum equals the applied external force F:

2.2 Nonrigid Body Motion
The nonrigid body is a deformable body, that is, a force acts on the body that 
will lead to the body changing its shape, called deformation. For a free-form de-
formation, each particle in the body moves from an initial position P to a new 
position Pt = f  (t, P) at time t, which is a function of t and P. Stress and strain 
may occur everywhere in the body. To compute the deformation of a complex 
body, more complicated methods such as the finite difference method (FDM), 
the finite element method (FEM), and the boundary element method may be 
used [8]. 
In this book, any nonrigid body motion is modeled by jointly connected 
rigid body segments or parts [2, 8–10]. In robotics, the robot arm is considered 
to be the flexible part of a mechanical system. The joint connection of two rigid 
segments of the arm is defined by the kinematical constraint on the joint that 
restricts the relative motions of the two individual rigid segments. When study-
ing radar scattering from a nonrigid body motion, the nonrigid body (such as 
a walking human or a flying bird) is modeled as several jointly connected rigid 
body segments. The motion of each segment is treated as a rigid body mo-
tion. In mechanics, this type of nonrigid body system is defined as a multibody 
system. 
The multibody system is widely used to model, simulate, analyze, and 
optimize motion kinematics and dynamic behavior of interconnected bodies in 
robotics and vehicle dynamics [8–10]. An example of the simplest multibody 
system is called the slider-crank mechanism. The mechanism is used to trans-
form the circular rotation of the crank into a linear translation of the piston; 
alternately, when the piston is forced to move, the linear translation is converted 
into circular rotation. The slider is not allowed to rotate and three revolute 
joints are used to connect these interconnected bodies. 
The crank, connecting-rod, and piston mechanism is shown in Figure 
2.4. The kinematic analysis of the slider-crank mechanism gives the displace-
ment (or position), velocity, and acceleration of the piston or the connecting

rod. From the geometry, the piston displacement x is determined by the length 
of the connecting rod L, the length of the crank R, the crank angle θ, and the 
connecting-rod angle ϕ

and
 
 
(2.48)
respectively.
Given R = 1.0m, L = 3.0m, and Ω = 2π (rad/sec), Figure 2.5 shows the 
variations in displacement, velocity, and acceleration of the piston as a function 
of time, and the variations in the connecting-rod angle, angular velocity, and 
angular acceleration as a function of time. 
Based on the kinematic analysis, a robot may be modeled by a multibody 
system to simulate motion kinematics and dynamic behavior of the intercon-
nected body segments. Similarly, a human body can also be modeled by a multi-
body system, and each interconnected body segment is considered a rigid body.
2.3 Electromagnetic Scattering from a Body with Motion
Before introducing the physics of the micro-Doppler effect in radar and calcu-
lating radar EM scattering from targets, the basics of EM scattering should be 
briefly introduced. 
The simplest model of EM scattering mechanism of a target is the point 
scatterer model. The target is defined in terms of a three-dimensional reflectiv-
ity density function characterized by point scatterers. The occlusion effect can 
also be implemented in the point scatterer model. Compared with other EM 
scattering models, the point scatterer model can easily incorporate the target’s 
motion in EM scattering and isolate the EM scattering from each individual 
motion component. 
2.3.1 
Radar Cross Section of a Target
EM scattering occurs when a target is illustrated by radar-transmitted EM 
waves. The incident EM waves induce electric and magnetic currents on the 
surface and/or within the volume of the target that will generate a scattered 
EM field. The scattered EM waves are transmitted to all possible directions. 
If the target is at a distance far enough from the radar, the incident wavefront 
can be treated as a plane wave. The power of scattered EM waves is measured 
by a bistatic scattering cross section of the target. If the direction is back to the 
radar, the bistatic scattering becomes backscattering and the cross section is a 
backscattering cross section, called the radar cross section (RCS). 
According to [11], “the IEEE Dictionary of Electrical and Electronics Terms 
defines RCS as a measure of reflective strength of a target defined as 4π times

The Micro-Doppler Effect in Radar  
the ratio of the power per unit solid angle scattered in a specified direction to 
the power per unit area in a plane wave incident on the scatterer from a speci-

 where Es is the 
intensity of the far-field scattered electric field, Ei is the intensity of the far-field 
incident electric field, and r is the distance from the radar to the target.
The RCS is defined to characterize the target characteristics. It is normal-
ized to the power density of the incident wave at the target in that it does not 
depend on the distance of the target from the radar. The RCS is dependent on 
the size, geometry, and material of the target, the frequency of the transmitter, 
the polarization of the transmitter and the receiver, and the aspect angles of the 
target relative to the radar transmit ter and the receiver, respectively [11–13].
The maximum detectable range of a target is proportional to the fourth 
root of its RCS. The RCS is usually described by the unit of square meters (m2). 
Typical RCS ranges are from 0.0005 m2 in insects, 0.01 m2 in small birds, 0.5 
m2 in humans, and up to 100,000 m2 in a large ship.
Any complicated target can be decomposed into the basic geometric 
building blocks of simple shapes such as spheres, cylinders, and plates. Figure 
2.6 illustrates an example of a human modeled by simple triangle-shaped sur-
face geometric building blocks.
When a target is illuminated by EM waves, each building block produces 
a voltage. The vector sum of the building block voltages determines the total 
RCS of the target. It is defined by the square root of the magnitude of the vector

sum. The accuracy of the RCS calculation depends on the accuracy of modeling 
these building blocks and the interactions between them. If the modeling is not 
accurate, the calculated RCS may not agree with the measured RCS. 
The mechanism of the EM scattering from a target is a complicated pro-
cess that includes reflections, diffractions, surface waves, ducting, and interac-
tions between them. Reflection is from surfaces and has the highest RCS peak 
among other scattering mechanisms. Diffraction is from discontinuities (such 
as edges, corners, or vertices) and is less intense than the reflection. The surface 
wave is the current traveling along the surface of the target body. A flat surface 
produces leaky waves and curved surfaces produce creeping waves. Ducting oc-
curs when a wave enters into a waveguide-like structure (such as the inlet cavity 
of an aircraft). Spiky features and lobes in the RCS may also associate with 
multiple reflections, diffraction, and other scattering mechanisms.
2.3.2 
RCS Prediction Methods
The RCS prediction method is an analytical method of calculating the RCS. 
The incident wave induces a current on the target and, thus, radiates an EM 
field. If the distribution of current is known, it can be used in the radiation inte-
grals to calculate the scattered field and the RCS. The commonly used methods 
for RCS prediction are the physical optics (PO), ray tracing, method of mo-
ments, and finite-difference methods [13]. The PO method is a high-frequency 
approximation to estimate the surface current induced on a body. It is accurate 
in the specular direction, but inaccurate when computing at angles far from the 
specular directions or in the shadow regions. However, surface waves are not in-
cluded in the PO method. To improve the accuracy for the current distribution 
near edges, the physical theory of diffraction (PTD) may be used.
The ray-tracing method is used to analyze large objects with arbitrary 
shape. Geometric optics (GO) is the classical theory of ray tracing and provides 
a formula for computing the reflected and refracted fields. It can also be supple-
mented by the geometric theory of diffraction (GTD). Computer codes based 
on GTD, PTD, and their hybridizations have been developed for the predic-
tion of high-frequency scattering from complex perfectly conducting objects. 
The XPATCH code, based on the shooting-and-bouncing ray technique 
and PTD, has been widely used to generate a target’s RCS signatures for non-
cooperative target recognition [14]. It allows the calculation of backscattering 
from complex geometries. Other computer codes for RCS prediction include 
the RAPPORT code developed by the Netherlands: numerical electromagnetic 
code (NEC), (electric field integral equation (EFIE), and finite-difference time 
domain (FDTD) [13, 15].
In this book, for some applications of the PO method will be used to es-
timate scattered fields. A simple RCS prediction code based on the PO method 

54 
The Micro-Doppler Effect in Radar  
called the POFacet is available [16, 17]; this can calculate the monostatic RCS 
and the bistatic RCS of a static object. The bistatic RCS determines the EM 
power flux density scattered by an object in an arbitrary direction. In using the 
PO facet of the RCS prediction method, an object is usually approximated by 
a large number of subdivision surfaces (triangular meshes) called facets that 
produce a continuous surface of the object. The total RCS of the object is the 
superposition of the square root of the magnitude of each individual facet’s 
RCS. The scattered field of each triangle is computed by assuming that the 
triangle is isolated and other triangles are not present. Besides multiple reflec-
tions, edge diffraction, and surface waves are not considered. Shadowing is only 
approximately included by considering a facet to be completely illuminated or 
completely shadowed by the incident wave. A standard spherical coordinate 
system is used in the PO facet RCS prediction to specify incident and scattering 
directions as shown in Figure 2.7, and the RCS is calculated at specific angles 
θ and ϕ.
2.3.3 
EM Scattering from a Body with Motion
The characteristics of the EM scattering field from an object have been studied 
for decades. The characteristic of the scattering field and the RCS of objects are 
usually calculated under an assumption that the object is stationary. However, 
in most practical situations, an object or structures on the object are rarely sta-
tionary and may have movements such as translation, rotation, or oscillation.
The EM field scattered from a moving object or an oscillating object has 
been studied in both theory and experiment [18–20]. Theoretical analysis indi-
cates that the motion of an object modulates the phase function of the scattered 
EM waves. If the object oscillates linearly and periodically, the modulation

generates sideband frequencies about the Doppler frequency induced by its 
translation. 
For a translational object, the far electric field of the object can be derived 
as [19] 
 
 
(2.49)
where k = 2π/λ is the wave number, uk is the unit vector of the incidence wave, 
ur is the unit vector of the direction of observation, E(r) is the far electric field of 
the object before moving, r = (X0, Y0, Z0) are the initial coordinates of the object 
in the space-fixed coordinates (X, Y, Z), r ′ = (X1, Y1, Z1) are the coordinates of 
the object in the space-fixed coordinates after translation, and r ′= r + r0, where 
r0 is the translation vector, as illustrated in Figure 2.8.
The only difference in the electric field before and after the translation is 
the phase term, exp{jkr0 ⋅ (uk − ur)}. If the translation is a function of time, r0 
= r0(t) = r0(t)uT , where uT is the unit vector of the translation, the phase factor 
then becomes
 
 
(2.50)
For backscattering, the direction of observation is opposite to the direc-
tion of the incidence wave. Thus, uk = −ur and

The Micro-Doppler Effect in Radar  
If the translation direction is perpendicular to the direction of the inci-
dence wave, that is, uT ⋅ uk, then exp{Φ(t)} = 1.
For a vibrating object, assuming r0(t) = AcosΩt, the phase factor becomes 
a periodic function of the time with an angular frequency Ω
 
 
(2.52)
In general, when radar transmits an EM wave at a carrier frequency of f0, 
the radar received signal can be expressed as
 
 
(2.53)
where the phase factor, exp{jkr0(t)(uk − ur)}, defines the modulation of the mi-
cro-Doppler effect caused by the time-varying motion r0(t).
2.4 Basic Mathematics for Calculating the Micro-Doppler Effect
The mathematics of the micro-Doppler can be derived from introducing the 
micro motion to the conventional Doppler analysis [21]. For simplicity, a radar 
target is represented by a set of point scatterers that are primary reflecting points 
on the target. The point scattering model simplifies the analysis while preserv-
ing micro-Doppler features. In the simplified model, scatterers are assumed to 
be perfect reflectors, reflecting all the energy intercepted.
As shown in Figure 2.9, the radar is stationary and located at the origin Q 
of the radar-fixed coordinate system (X, Y, Z). The target is described in a local 
coordinate system (x, y, z) that is attached to the target and has translation and 
rotation with respect to the radar coordinates. To observe the target’s rotations, 
a reference coordinate system (X ′, Y ′, Z ′) is introduced, which shares the same 
origin with the target local coordinates and, thus, has the same translation as 
the target but no rotation with respect to the radar coordinates. The origin O 
of the reference coordinates is assumed to be at a distance R0 from the radar.
2.4.1 
Micro-Doppler Induced by a Target with Micro Motion
Suppose the target has a translation velocity v with respect to the radar and an 
angular rotation velocity , which can be either represented in the target local 
coordinate system as  = (ωx, ωy, ωz)T, or represented in the reference coordi-
nate system as  = (ωX, ωY, ωZ)T. Thus, a point scatterer P at time t = 0 will 
move to P  ′ at time t. The movement consists of two steps: (1) translation from 
P to P ″, as shown in Figure 2.9, with a velocity v, that is, OOt = vt, and (2) 
rotation from P ″ to P ′ with an angular velocity . If we observe the movement

in the reference coordinate system, the point scatterer P is located at r0 = (X0, 
Y0, Z0)T, and the rotation from P ″ to P ′ is described by a rotation matrix ℜt. 
Then, at time t the location of P ′ will be at
 
 
(2.54)
The range vector from the radar at Q to the scatterer at P ′ can be derived 
as
 
 
(2.55)
and the scalar range becomes

where ||•|| represents the Euclidean norm.

baseband of the signal returned from the point scatterer P is a function of r(t):

2.4.2 
Vibration-Induced Micro-Doppler Shift
As shown in Figure 2.10, the radar is located at the origin of the radar coordi-
nate system (X, Y, Z) and a point scatterer P is vibrating about a center point 
O. This center point is also the origin of the reference coordinate system (X ′, 
Y ′, Z ′), which is translated from (X, Y, Z) to be situated at a distance R0 from 
the radar. We also assume that the center point O is stationary with respect to 
the radar. If the azimuth and elevation angle of the point O with respect to the 
radar are α and β, respectively, the point O is located at
 
 
(2.69)
in the radar coordinates (X, Y, Z). Then the unit vector of the radar LOS

If one assumes that the scatterer P is vibrating at a frequency fv with an 
amplitude Dv and that the azimuth and elevation angle of the vibration direc-
tion in the reference coordinates (X ′, Y ′, Z ′) are αP and βP, respectively. Thus, 
as shown in Figure 2.10, the vector from the radar to the scatterer P becomes 
Rt = R0 + Dt and the range from the radar to the scatterer P can be expressed as
 
 
(2.71)
If R0 >> Dt, the range is approximately
 
 
(2.72)
If the azimuth angle α of the center point O and the elevation angle βP of 
the scatterer P are all zero, and if R0 >> Dt, then we have
 
 
(2.73)
Because the angular frequency of the vibration rate is ωv and the ampli-
tude of the vibration is Dv, then Dt = Dvsinωvt and the range of the scatterer 
becomes
 
 
(2.74)
The radar received signal then becomes
 
 
(2.75)
where ρ is the reflectivity of the point scatterer, f0 is the carrier frequency of 
the transmitted signal, λ is the wavelength, and Φ(t) = 4πR(t)/λ is the phase 
function.
Substituting (2.74) into (2.75) and denoting B = (4π/λ)Dv cosβ cosαP , 
the received signal can be rewritten as

Equation (2.76) can be further expressed by the Bessel function of the

and, thus,
 
 
(2.78)
Therefore, the micro-Doppler frequency spectrum consists of pairs of 
spectral lines around the center frequency f0 and with a spacing ωv /(2π) be-
tween adjacent lines.
Because of the vibration, the point scatterer P, which is initially, at time t 
= 0, located at [X0, Y0, Z0]T in (X ′, Y ′, Z ′), will, at time t, move to
 
 
(2.79)
The velocity of the scatterer P due to the vibration becomes

2.4.3 
Rotation-Induced Micro-Doppler Shift
The geometry of the radar and a target with three-dimensional rotations is illus-
trated in Figure 2.11. The radar coordinate system is (X, Y, Z), the target local 
coordinate system is (x, y, z), and the reference coordinate system (X ′, Y ′, Z ′) is 
parallel to the radar coordinates (X, Y, Z) and located at the origin of the target 
local coordinates. Assume that the azimuth and elevation angle of the target in 
the radar coordinates (X, Y, Z) are α and β, respectively, and the unit vector of 
the radar LOS is the same as (2.70).
Due to the target’s rotation, any point on the target described in the local 
coordinate system (x, y, z) will move to a new position in the reference coor-
dinate system (X ′, Y ′, Z ′). The new position can be calculated from its initial 
position vector multiplied by an initial rotation matrix of the x-convention (z-
x-z sequence) determined by the angles (ϕ0, θ0, ψ0), where the angle ϕ0 rotates 
about the z-axis, the angle θ0 rotates about the x-axis, and the angle ψ0 rotates 
about the z-axis again. 
The corresponding initial rotation matrix is defined by

Basics of the Micro-Doppler Effect in Radar 
65
Viewed in the target local coordinate system, when a target rotates about 
its axes x, y, and z with an angular velocity  = (ωx, ωy, ωz)T, a point scatterer P 
at rP = (xP, yP, zP)T represented in the target local coordinates (x, y, z) will move 
to a new location in the reference coordinate system described by ℜInit ⋅ rP and 
the unit vector of the rotation becomes
 
 
(2.87)
with the scalar angular velocity Ω = ||||. Thus, according to the Rodrigues 
formula [2], at time t the rotation matrix becomes
 
 
(2.88)
where ω′
ˆ  is the skew symmetric matrix 
 
 
(2.89)
Therefore, viewed in the reference coordinate system (X ′, Y ′, Z ′), at time 
t, the scatterer P will move from its initial location to a new location r = ℜt ⋅ 
ℜInit ⋅ rP. According to the discussion in Section 2.4.1, the micro-Doppler fre-
quency shift induced by the rotation is approximately

the initial Euler angles (ϕ = 30°, θ = 20°, ψ = 20°) and angular velocity  = [π, 
2π, π]T rad/sec. Suppose that the target has three strong scatterer centers: scat-
terer P0 (the center of the rotation) is located at (x = 0m, y = 0m, z = 0m); scat-
terer P1 is located at (x = 1.0m, y = 0.6m, z = 0.8m); and scatterer P2 is located 
at (x = −1.0m, y = −0.6m, z = −0.8m). The theoretical micro-Doppler modu-
lation calculated by (2.91) is shown in Figure 2.11(b). The micro-Doppler of 
the center point P0 is the line at the zero frequency, and the micro-Doppler 
modulations from the points P1 and P2 are the two sinusoidal curves about the 
zero frequency. The rotation period can be obtained from the rotation angular 
velocity as T0 = 2π/|||| = 0.8165 seconds. 
2.4.4 
Coning Motion-Induced Micro-Doppler Shift
The coning motion is a rotation about an axis that intersects with an axis of the 
local coordinates. A whipping top usually undergoes a coning motion while its 
body is spinning around its axis of symmetry with a fixed tip point and the axis 
of symmetry is rotating about another axis that intersects with the axis. If the 
axis of symmetry does not remain at a constant angle with the axis of coning, it 
will oscillate up and down between two limits, called nutation. In this case, the 
Euler angle ϕ is known as the spin angle, ψ is known as the precession angle, 
and θ is known as the nutation angle. 
Without considering spinning and nutation, assume a target with pure 
coning motion along the axis SN, which intersects with the z-axis at the point S 
(x = 0, y = 0, z = z0) of the local coordinates, as shown in Figure 2.12. The refer-
ence coordinate system (X ′, Y ′, Z ′) is parallel to the radar coordinates (X, Y, Z) 
and its origin is located at the point S. Assume that the azimuth and elevation 
angle of the target center O with respect to the radar are α and β, respectively, 
and the azimuth and elevation angle of the coning axis SN with respect to the 
reference coordinates (X ′, Y ′, Z ′) are αN and βN, respectively. Then the unit 
vector of the radar LOS is
 
 
and the unit vector of the rotation axis in the reference coordinates (X ′, Y ′, Z ′) 
is
 
 
Assume that the initial position of a scatterer P is r = [x, y, z]T represented 
in the target local coordinates. Then the location of the point scatterer P in the 
reference coordinates (X ′, Y ′, Z ′) can be calculated through its local coordi-
nates by subtracting the coordinates of the point S and multiplying the rotation

matrix ℜInit defined by the initial Euler angles (ϕ, θ, ψ). Viewed from the refer-
ence coordinates (X ′, Y ′, Z ′), the location of the scatterer P is at ℜInit⋅ [x, y, z 
− z0]T. Suppose that the target has a coning motion with an angular velocity of 
ω rad/sec. According to the Rodrigues formula, at time t the rotation matrix in 
the reference coordinates (X ′, Y ′, Z ′) becomes

Therefore, at time t the scatterer P will move to 
 
 
(2.94)
If the point S is not too far from the target center of mass, the radar LOS 
can be approximated as the radial direction of the point S with respect to the 
radar. According to the mathematical formula described in Section 2.4.1, the 
micro-Doppler modulation induced by the coning motion is approximately
 
 
(2.95)
Assume that the radar operates at 10 GHz and a target is initially located 
at (X = 1,000m, Y = 5,000m, Z = 5,000m). Suppose that the initial Euler angles 
are ϕ = 10°, θ = 10°, and ψ = −20°, the target is coning with 2 Hz during T 
= 2.048 seconds, or with an angular velocity ω = (2 × 2π/T  ) rad/sec, and the 
azimuth and elevation angle of the rotation axis are αN = 160° and βP = 50°, 
respectively. Thus, given the initial location of the point scatterer P0 at (x = 0m, 
y = 0m, z = 0m), the scatterer P1 at (x = 0.3m, y = 0m, z = 0.6m), and the scat-
terer P2 at (x = −0.3m, y = 0m, z = 0.6m), the theoretical micro-Doppler modu-
lation calculated by (2.95) is shown in Figure 2.12(b). The micro-Doppler of 
the point P0 is zero frequency, and the micro-Doppler modulations from the 
points P1 and P2 are the two sinusoidal curves about the zero frequency with 
their amplitudes determined by their radial directions.
When a coning body is also spinning around its axis of symmetry, the 
motion becomes precession. The precession matrix ℜprec is the product of the 
coning matrix ℜconing and the spinning matrix ℜspinning:

The Micro-Doppler Effect in Radar  
Assume that the radar operates at 10 GHz and a target is initially located 
at (X = 1,000m, Y = 5,000m, Z = 5,000m). Suppose that the initial Euler angles 
are ϕ = 30°, θ = 30°, and ψ = 20°, and the target is spinning with 8 Hz during 
T = 2.048 seconds, or with an angular velocity Ωspinning = (8 × 2π/T) rad/sec. 
Then, given the initial location of the point scatterer P0 at (x = 0m, y = 0m, z 
= 0 m), the scatterer P1 at (x = 0.3m, y = 0m, z = 0.6m), and the scatterer P2 at 
(x = −0.3m, y = 0m, z = 0.6m), the theoretical micro-Doppler signature of the 
spinning target is shown in Figure 2.13.
Figure 2.13 (a) A target with spinning motion, and (b) the micro-Doppler signature of the 
spinning target.

 
Basics of the Micro-Doppler Effect in Radar 
71
Based on (2.101), the theoretical micro-Doppler signature of a precession 
target can be seen in Figure 2.14, where the target has the same initial condition 
as the coning and the spinning target as discussed above. However, the target is 
spinning with an angular velocity Ωspinning = 3.906 rad/sec or spinning 8 cycles 
during T = 2.048 seconds. The target is also coning with an angular velocity 
Ωconing = 0.977 rad/sec or coning 2 cycles during T = 2.048 seconds. The preces-
sion micro-Doppler signature shows 8 cycles spinning modulated by 2 cycles 
coning.
2.5 Bistatic Micro-Doppler Effect
The micro-Doppler effect is dependent on the target aspect angle. For a target 
moving at angles 0° (head-on) and 180° (tail-on) to the radar LOS, micro-Dop-
pler frequencies reach the maximum shift; and at angles ±90° to the radar LOS, 
micro-Doppler frequencies become zero. Besides, due to occlusions at certain 
aspect angles, some corresponding parts of the target may not be seen by radar.
A separated transmitter and receiver bistatic configuration offers more 
freedom of acquiring a complementary target’s information, avoiding blind 
Figure 2.14 The micro-Doppler signature of a precession target.

velocities, and preventing monostatic RCS from the null or low monostatic 
positions. 
In bistatic radar systems, to determine the target location, the azimuth 
and elevation of the target viewed at the transmitter and the timing of the trans-
mitted signal must be known exactly. Synchronization between the receiver and 
transmitter must be maintained. The range resolution and Doppler resolution 
are both dependent on the bistatic angle. Rotational motions of targets can also 
induce a bistatic micro-Doppler effect depending on the triangulation geom-
etry of the transmitter, the target, and the receiver. 
In a bistatic radar, the transmitter and receiver are separated by a baseline 
distance that is comparable with the maximum range of targets with respect to 
the transmitter and the receiver. The separation brings an issue of synchroniza-
tion between the two sites and requires phase synchronization between the local 
oscillator in the transmitter and the one in the receiver in order to accurately 
measure the target location and to perform range and Doppler processing.
The coordinate systems include global space-fixed coordinates, reference 
coordinates, and target local body-fixed coordinates, as shown in Figure 2.15 in 
a three-dimensional case. The bistatic plane is the one on which the transmit-
ter, the receiver, and the target lie. The baseline (L) is the distance between the 
transmitter and receiver. The range from the transmitter to the target is a vector 
rT and the range from the receiver to the target is a vector rR. The bistatic angle 
ϕ is the angle between the transmitter-to-target line and the receiver-to-target 
line. Assume that the transmitter look angles (azimuth and elevation) are (αT, 
βT), the receiver look angles (αR, βR) can be obtained from the baseline distance, 
the target range, and look angles relative to the transmitter. The positive angle

is defined in a counterclockwise direction. Thus, the distance from the receiver 
to the target becomes
 
 
(2.102)
and the receiver look angles are
 
 
(2.103)
 
 
(2.104)
The received signal from a point target P can be modeled as
 
 
(2.105)
where c is the propagation velocity. Then the received signal from a volume 
target is a volume integration of the point return over the whole target: 
 
 
(2.106)
The phase term in the received signal is

The Micro-Doppler Effect in Radar  
is the phase term induced by translational motions and
 
 
(2.109)
is the phase term induced by rotational motions of the scatterer P.
While the target has translational motion with a velocity V and rotation 
with an initial Euler angle (ϕ0, θ0, ψ0) and an angular velocity vector  = (ωx, 
ωy, ωz)T rotating about the target local-fixed axes x, y, and z, then the Doppler 
frequency shift induced by the translation and rotation can be obtained by the 
time derivative of the phase function.
The Doppler shift consists of two parts: one is induced by the translation 
and the other is induced by the rotation,
 
 
(2.110)
where 
 
 
(2.111)
is the translational Doppler shift and
 
 
(2.112)
is the rotation induced micro-Doppler, which is usually a periodic frequency 
function of time and distributed around the translational Doppler frequency.
If the target moves with a velocity V and an acceleration a, their compo-
nents along the direction from the transmitter to the target are
 
 
(2.113)
and the components along the direction from the receiver to the target are
 
 
(2.114)

Then the range from the transmitter to the moving target becomes
 
 
(2.115)
and the range from the receiver to the target is
 
 
(2.116)
While the target has rotational motion, its rotation angles are determined 
by its initial angles 0 and rotation rate :
 
 
(2.117)
where 
 
 
(2.118)
Therefore, the Doppler shift induced by the translational motion is
 
 
(2.119)
and that induced by the rotation becomes
 
 
(2.120)
Thus, the translational Doppler shift of the bistatic radar depends on 
three factors [22, 23]. The first factor is the maximum Doppler shift when a 
target moving with a velocity V:
 
 
(2.121)
The second factor is related to the bistatic triangulation factor

The Micro-Doppler Effect in Radar  
where ϕ = αR − αTis the bistatic angle.
The third factor is related to the angle δ between the moving direction of 
the target and the direction of the bisector:
 
 
(2.123)
Thus, the bistatic Doppler shift becomes
 
 
(2.124)
Similar to the Doppler shift induced by the radial velocity in the mo-
nostatic radar case, for the bistatic radar case the Doppler shift is induced by 
the target’s bisector velocity. The bistatic Doppler shift is always smaller than 
the maximum monostatic Doppler because the term, cos(ϕ/2), is always less 
than 1. 
If the radial velocity of the target with respect to the transmitter is very 
small or zero, the monostatic radar cannot produce an image of the target. 
However, according to (2.124), the target velocity with respect to the receiver 
must not be zero and the bistatic radar is able to produce a good image of the 
moving target.
As defined in the monostatic radar, in the bistatic case two targets may be 
separated in range, Doppler shift, and angle. The range resolution in the mo-
nostatic radar is ΔrMono and the Doppler resolution is Δ
Mono
D
f
. For bistatic radar, 
the range resolution and Doppler resolution are both dependent on the bistatic 
angle ϕ. The range resolution becomes
 
 
(2.125)
and Doppler resolution is
 
 
(2.126)
If the bistatic angle is near 180°, this is the case of forward scattering 
radar. Cherniakov discussed the advantages and disadvantages of the forward-
scattering radar [24]. For bistatic angles over 150°–160°, the bistatic RCS in-
creases sharply. However, for bistatic angles near 180°, cos(φ/2) → 0. Thus, the 
bistatic range resolution is losing and there is no Doppler frequency resolution.

Similar to the bistatic Doppler shift generated by the bisector velocity, for 
a point scatterer P in the target, its bistatic micro-Doppler induced by the rota-
tional motion of the target is also determined by its bisector component [22]:
 
 
(2.127)
The initial Euler angle (ϕ0, θ0, ψ0), the angular velocity vector Ω = (ωx, 
ωy, ωz)T, and the point scatterer’s location determine the total micro-Doppler 
shifts. 
According to (2.127), the bistatic micro-Doppler shift of a rotating target 
can be expressed by
 
 
(2.128)
where
 
 
(2.129)
is the maximum micro-Doppler captured by monostatic radar. 
2.6 Multistatic Micro-Doppler Effect
The multistatic radar configuration has multiple transmitters and receivers dis-
tributed over several locations called nodes. It combines multiple measurements 
of a target viewed at different aspects to extract information about the target. 
Any individual node of the multistatic system may have both a transmitter and 
a receiver [24]. 
In a multistatic radar system, the range of a target is determined by a pair 
of a transmitter and a receiver and is measured from the time delay Δt between 
the transmitted and the received signals rbistatic = rT + rR = c ⋅ Δt. However, the lo-
cation of the target measured by the bistatic radar is ambiguous and constrained 
to an ellipse with foci at the transmitter and the receiver. 
The multistatic system can be treated as combinations of several bistatic 
systems. Figure 2.16 illustrates a multistatic system with four transmitters and 
four receivers. There is a total of NChannel = NTrans × NReceiv = 16 possible chan-
nels to form the multistatic system: four monostatic systems and twelve bistatic

The Micro-Doppler Effect in Radar  
systems. Because each bistatic system provides a different aspect view of the 
target, the multistatic system will provide a simultaneous multiple view of the 
micro-Doppler effect [25]. 
The processing in the multistatic system is to coherently combine the sig-
nals received from each of these bistatic systems, model the change of the target 
position with time, and calculate the phase change Φn(t) in each bistatic system. 
Then the received baseband signal can be expressed by
  
(2.130)
where An is the amplitude and Φn(t) is the phase function of the signal in the nth 
channel, rT,n(t) = ||rT,n(t)|| is the distance from the nth transmitter to the target, 
and rR,n(t) = ||rR,n(t)|| is the distance from the target to the nth receiver. 
If a point P on the target has rotation, the micro-Doppler induced by the 
rotation is given by

as derived in (2.128). 
Thus, the multistatic micro-Doppler is derived by taking the time deriva-
tive of the combined baseband signals 
 
 
(2.132)
In the multistatic configuration, each node has its own aspect view of 
the target. The multistatic topology determines the multistatic micro-Doppler 
features. The combination of the number of nodes and the angular separation 
between these nodes determine the micro-Doppler signature of the target. 
2.7 Cramer-Rao Bound of the Micro-Doppler Estimation
In a coherent radar system, the micro-Doppler modulation is embedded in the 
radar returns. The range profile can be expressed by
 
 
(2.133)
where R0 is the distance of the target, d is the displacement or the amplitude 
of the micro-Doppler modulation, and ωmD is the micro-Doppler modulation 
frequency. To estimate micro-Doppler frequency shifts, the signal-to-noise ratio 
(SNR), the total number of time samples (N ), the frequency of micro-Doppler 
modulation (ωmD), the displacement of the micro-Doppler modulation (d  ), 
and the wavelength of the carrier frequency (λ) determine the lower bound on 
the micro-Doppler estimation precession. The Cramer-Rao lower bound of the 
micro-Doppler estimation can be found in [26, 27].

The Micro-Doppler Effect of the Rigid 
Body Motion
The rigid body is an idealization of a solid body without deformation (i.e., the 
distance between any two particles of the body remains constant while in mo-
tion). Usually, the geometry of a body is described by its location and orienta-
tion. The location is defined by the position of a reference point in the body, 
such as the center of mass or the centroid. The orientation is determined by its 
angular position. Thus, the motion of a rigid body is described by its kinematic 
and dynamic quantities, such as linear and angular velocity, linear and angular 
acceleration, linear and angular momentum, and the kinetic energy of the body. 
As described in Chapter 2, the orientation of a rigid body can be represented 
by a set of Euler angles in a three-dimensional Euclidean space, by a rotation 
matrix (called the direction cosine matrix), or by a quaternion.
When a rigid body moves, both its position and its orientation vary with 
time. The translation and rotation of the body are measured with respect to 
a reference coordinates system. In a rigid body, all particles of the body move 
with the same translational velocity. However, when rotating, all particles of the 
body (except those lying on the axis of rotation) change their position. Thus, 
the linear velocity of any two particles of the body may not be the same. How-
ever, angular velocities of all particles are the same.
When an object has translational and/or rotational motion, the radar scat-
tering from the target is subject to modulation in its amplitude and phase. 
Theoretical analysis indicates that the motion of an object can modulate the 
phase function of the scattered EM waves. If the object oscillates periodically, 
the modulation generates sideband frequencies about the frequency of the in-
cident wave.

94 
The Micro-Doppler Effect in Radar  
To incorporate any object’s motion in EM simulation, first, the trajectory 
and orientation of the object must be determined by using motion differen-
tial equations and a rotation matrix of the object. Then, using the quasi-static 
method, the motion of the object is considered a sequence of snapshots taken 
at each time instant. Finally, using a suitable RCS prediction method, the scat-
tering EM field is estimated. 
The simplest model of the EM scattering mechanism is the point scat-
terer model. With this model, an object is defined in terms of a three-dimen-
sional reflectivity density function characterized by point scatterers. It is rather 
straightforward to incorporate an object’s motion in the point scatterer model 
simulation.
Another simple method of RCS modeling is to decompose an object into 
canonical geometric components, such as a sphere, an ellipsoid, or a cylinder. 
The RCS of each canonical component can be expressed by a mathematical 
formula. 
A more accurate RCS modeling method is the physical optics (PO) model. 
It is a simple and convenient RCS prediction method for any three-dimensional 
object. 
In this chapter, typical examples of an oscillating pendulum, rotating ro-
tor blades, a spinning symmetric top, and wind turbines of windmills are in-
troduced. Pendulum oscillation is a commonly used example to understand 
the basic principle of the nonlinear motion dynamic. Rotating helicopter rotor 
blades are one of the most popular subjects in radar target signature analy-
sis. The spinning symmetric top has more complex nonlinear motion and has 
shown more interesting signatures than other rigid body motion. Wind tur-
bines now become challenges to current radar systems. Large numbers of wind 
farms and large RCS of turbine blades have a significant impact on radar perfor-
mance. In this chapter, details on the modeling of a nonlinear motion dynamic, 
the modeling of the RCS of a rigid body, the mathematical model of radar scat-
tering from a rotating rigid body, and the micro-Doppler signature of a typical 
rigid body will be described, and the simulation of nonlinear motion and radar 
backscattering using MATLAB will be provided.
3.1 Pendulum Oscillation
Pendulum oscillation is a commonly used example to understand the basic 
principle of nonlinear motion dynamic. A simple pendulum is modeled by a 
weighted small bob, attached to one end of a weightless string, and the other 
end of the string is fixed to a pivot point as shown in Figure 3.1. Under the 
influence of the gravity g = 9.80665 m/s2, the small bob swings back and forth 
periodically about a fixed horizontal axis along the y-axis and at (x = 0, z = 0). 

 
The Micro-Doppler Effect of the Rigid Body Motion 
95
In a stable equilibrium condition, the center of mass of the pendulum is right 
below the axis of rotation at (x = 0, y = 0, z = L), where L is the length of the 
string.
3.1.1 
Modeling Nonlinear Motion Dynamic of a Pendulum
Newton’s law states that the total force acting on the pendulum is equal to the 
product of the mass of the pendulum and its acceleration. If the pendulum is 
initially deviated from its stable position by a swinging angle θ, there are two 
forces acting on the mass of the pendulum: the downward gravitational force, 
mg, , where m is the mass of the pendulum, and the tension, T, in the string. 
However, the tension has no contribution to the torque because its line of action 
passes through the pivot point. From simple trigonometry, the line of action of 
the gravitational force passes a distance Lsinθ from the pivot point. Hence, the 
magnitude of the gravitational torque is mgLsinθ. The gravitational torque is a 
restoring torque (i.e., if the mass of the pendulum is displaced slightly from its 
equilibrium state at θ = 0, then the gravitational force acts to pull the pendulum 
back toward that state). 
According to Newton’s second law of motion, the net torque is I(d 2θ/d 2t), 
where I is the moment of inertia, and (d 2θ/d 2t) is the angular acceleration. If 
the torque acting on the system is τ, then τ = I(d 2θ/d 2t) is the angular equation

the moment of inertia about the pivot is
 
 
(3.1)
The vector torque  is the cross-product of the position vector L and the 
gravitational force vector mg (i.e.,  = L × mg). The magnitude of the torque is 
τ = Lmg sinθ, and the net torque on the pendulum is
 
 
(3.2)
and, finally, the equation of pendulum becomes
 
 
(3.3)
This equation defines the relationship between the swinging angle θ and 
its second time derivatives d 2 θ/dt 2. 
By denoting the angular velocity Ω = dθ/dt, the equation of pendulum can 
be rewritten as a set of two first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs):
 
 
(3.4)
Figure 3.2 shows the oscillating angle and angular velocity of a simple 
pendulum with the mass m = 20g and the length L = 1.5m.
For a small angle θ, sinθ can be substituted by θ and the pendulum be-
comes a linear oscillator. Thus, the differential equation of the pendulum mo-
tion becomes

where ω0 = (g/L)1/2 is the angular frequency of the oscillating pendulum. Equa-

The simple pendulum assumes that the string is weightless and the bob is 
small such that its angular momentum is negligible. However, a physical pen-
dulum may have a large size and mass. Thus, it may have a significant moment 
of inertia I. 
From (3.2), the equation of a physical pendulum can be written as
 
 
(3.11)
where Leffect is the effective length of a physical pendulum, and the right-hand 
side of the equation is the net torque of the gravity. The physical pendulum

3.1.2 
Modeling RCS of a Pendulum
The RCS measures the strength of an object’s reflectivity and is a function of 
the object’s orientation and the radar transmitted frequency. The small bob of 
a pendulum has a simple geometric shape, such as a sphere, an ellipsoid, or a 
cylinder, and the RCS of a simple geometric shape can be expressed by a math-
ematical formula. 
High-frequency RCS prediction methods and exact RCS prediction for-
mulas can be found in [1] by Knott, Shaeffer, and Tuley. The computer simula-
tion of radar backscattering used in this book is not an exact RCS prediction. 
Instead, the simulation is based on approximate and simplified complex scatter-
ing solutions [2]. With the simplest component method, an object consists of 
a limited number of the simplest components, such as spheres, ellipsoids, and 
cylinders. The formulas of the simplest components are available, but are not 
exact solutions.
The RCS of a perfectly conducting sphere has three regions. In the optical 
region, which corresponds to a large sphere compared with the wavelength, the 
RCS is a constant and can be simply expressed by RCSsphere = πr2, where r is the 
radius of the sphere and is much greater than the wavelength λ. In the Rayleigh 
region for a small sphere, the RCS is RCSsphere = 9πr2(kr)4, where k = 2π/λ. The 
region between the Rayleigh and optical regions is a resonance region called the 
Mie region [3].
An approximation for the RCS of an ellipsoid backscattering is given by 
[3]

where a, b, and c represent the length of the three semi-axes of the ellipsoid 
in the x, y, and z directions, respectively. The incident aspect angle θ and the 
azimuth angle ϕ represent the orientation of the ellipsoid relative to the radar 
and are defined by 
 
 
(3.22)
and
 
 
(3.23)
where the incident angle counts from the z-axis and the azimuth angle counts 
from the x-axis. If the ellipsoid is symmetric (i.e., a = b), the RCS will be inde-
pendent of the azimuth angle ϕ. 
The nonnormal incidence backscattered RCS for a symmetric cylinder 
due to a linear polarized incident wave is approximated by [3]
 
 
(3.24)
where r is the radius, θ is the incident aspect angle, and the RCS is independent 
of the azimuth angle ϕ.
These RCS formulas can be used to simulate radar backscattering from an 
oscillating pendulum.
3.1.3 
Radar Backscattering from an Oscillating Pendulum
To calculate radar backscattering from an oscillating pendulum, ordinary dif-
ferential equations are used for solving the swinging angle and the angular ve-
locity. Therefore, at each time instant during a radar observation time interval, 
the location of the pendulum can be determined. Based on the location and 
orientation of the pendulum, the RCS of the pendulum and the radar received 
signal can be calculated. 
If the radar transmits a sequence of narrow rectangular pulses with a trans-
mitted frequency fc, a pulse width Δ, and a pulse repetition interval ΔT, the 
radar received baseband signal is

Given the location of the radar at (x = 10m, y = 0m, z = 0m), the pivot 
point of the pendulum is assumed at (x = 0m, y = 0m, z = 2m). The string 
length L = 1.5m and the mass of the small bob is 20g. In cases of damping and 
driving, let the damping constant be γ = 0.07 and the driving amplitude be ADr 
= 15, and the normalized driving frequency fDr = 0.2. The geometric configura-
tion of the radar and the pendulum is illustrated in Figure 3.4.
Equations (3.4) and (3.15) are used to calculate the oscillating angle and 
angular velocity of the simple, the damping, and the damping and driving pen-
dulums, respectively. In the rotation matrix of the pendulum, only the pitch 
angle varies and the roll and yaw angles are always zero. The RCS of the small 
bob is simulated by the point-scatterer model because the small bob can be seen 
as a point scatterer. After arranging the np range profiles, the 2-D pulse-range 
profiles can be obtained. Figure 3.5(a) shows the 2-D range profiles of the sim-
ple oscillating pendulum, where the radar wavelength is 0.03m at the X-band. 
The oscillating small bob can be seen around a distance of 10m from the radar.

3.1.4 
Micro-Doppler Signatures Generated by an Oscillating Pendulum
The micro-Doppler signature of the oscillating simple pendulum, shown in 
Figure 3.5(b), is obtained from the summation of those range profiles that are 
within a range gate around 10m, where the small bob is located within the radar 
observation interval. The joint time-frequency transform used to generate the 
signature is a simple STFT. Other higher-resolution time-frequency transforms, 
such as the smoothed pseudo-Wigner-Ville distribution, may also be used.
Compared with the micro-Doppler signature a simple pendulum, Figure 
3.6 shows the micro-Doppler signatures of a damping pendulum and a damp-
ing and driving pendulum with L = 1.5m, m = 20g, γ = 0.07, ADr = 15, and fDr 
= 0.2.
From the micro-Doppler signature in Figure 3.6(a), an oscillating fre-
quency of 0.4 Hz can be measured and the damping constant γ is measured 
from the change of the amplitude of the Doppler modulation during the ob-
servation time duration of 10 seconds. Due to the measured change of the am-
plitude of the Doppler modulation being 101 Hz/202 Hz during a 10-second 
time interval, the damping constant is estimated as
 
 
which is consistent with the damping constant of 0.07 used in the simulation. 
The MATLAB code for calculating radar backscattering from an oscillating 
pendulum is listed in Appendix 3A.
3.2 Helicopter Rotor Blades
An airfoil of a helicopter rotor blade and its cross-section profile is shown in 
Figure 3.7 [4]. Different types of airfoils have various shapes and dimensions. 
A rotating aerofoil always has bending, flexing, and twisting. However, in the 
simulation study of a helicopter’s rotor blades, no bending, flexing, and twisting 
are considered.
Blades of helicopters are usually metallic or a composite material that 
produces strong radar reflectivity. EM scattering from an airfoil mainly includes 
specular reflections from its surfaces and leading edge, diffraction from its trail-
ing edge, creeping waves around the leading edge, and traveling waves from 
the trailing edge. Radar returns from a helicopter have its unique spectral sig-
nature [5, 6]. Figure 3.8 illustrates a general spectral signature of helicopters 
with rotating rotor blades. The spectral signature has spectral components from 
the fuselage, from the rotor hub, from the main rotor’s receding blades, and 
from approaching blades. The strongest spectral amplitude comes from the fu-
selage. The spectral amplitude of the receding blade is different from that of

approaching blades are especially interesting. 
3.2.1 
Mathematic Model of Rotating Rotor Blades
The geometry of the radar and rotating rotor blades is shown in Figure 3.9. The 
radar is located at the origin of the space-fixed coordinates (X, Y, Z ) and the ro-
tor blades are centered at the origin of the body-fixed coordinates on the plane 
(x, y, z = 0) rotating about the z-axis with an angular rotation rate Ω. The refer-
ence coordinates (X ′, Y ′, Z ′) is parallel to and translated from the space-fixed 
coordinates located at the same origin as the body-fixed coordinates. The dis-

tance from the radar to the origin of the reference coordinates is R0. The radar 
observed azimuth and elevation angles of the origin of the reference coordinates 
are α and β, respectively.
From the EM scattering point of view, each blade of the rotor consists 
of scatterer centers. Each scatterer center is considered a point with a certain 
reflectivity. For simplicity, the same reflectivity is assigned to all of the scatterer 
centers. Let α = β = 0; if a point scatterer P at (x0, y0, z0 = 0) rotates about the 
z-axis in the body-fixed coordinates with a constant angular rotation rate Ω, the 
distance from the origin of the body-fixed coordinates to the point scatterer P

scatterer P becomes

angle β = 45°. According to the length of the blade tip and its rotation rate, the 
velocity of the blade tip is Vtip = 2πLΩ = 163.4 m/s and, thus, the maximum 
Doppler shift is {fD}max = (2Vtip/λ)cosβ = 3.85 kHz. Thus, the Nyquist rate is 
2 × 3.85 kHz = 7.7 kHz. With a 10-kHz sampling rate, which is higher than 
the Nyquist rate, the time-domain signature of the rotor blades is shown in 
Figure 3.10(a) and the frequency spectrum of the same signal is shown in Figure 
3.10(b). There is no frequency aliasing.
The rotor blades’ return has short flashes when a blade has a specular 
reflection at the approaching or advancing points and the receding points [9]. 
The interval between flashes is related to the rotation rate of the rotor. The 
duration of the flash is determined by the blade length L, the wavelength λ, the 
elevation angle β, and the rotation rate Ω as described by the sinc function in 
(3.33). For a longer blade length and at a shorter wavelength, the duration of 
the flash is shorter. Because the number of blades is 2 and the rotation rate is 
4 r/s, there are 8 flashes in 1.0 second for each of the blades, and the interval 
between flashes is TC = 1/8 = 0.125 (second) as shown in Figure 3.10(a).

quency spectrum of the two-blade rotating rotor derived from (3.33).

The Micro-Doppler Effect in Radar  
Because rotating rotor blades impart periodic modulations on the radar 
returned signal, the rotation-induced Doppler shifts occupy unique locations 
in the frequency domain relative to the Doppler shift of the fuselage. Figure 
3.10(b) shows the spectral components of the rotating rotor blades without 
fuselage and rotor hub. The Doppler shift of the fuselage and the hub should be 
around zero Doppler if the helicopter has no translational motion. 
Because the time derivative of the phase function of a signal is the in-
stantaneous frequency of the signal, by taking the time derivative of the phase 
function Φk(t) in (3.34), the instantaneous Doppler frequency shift induced by 
the kth rotor blade becomes
 
(3.36)
The Doppler frequency is modulated by the rotation rate Ω through two 
sinusoidal functions. 
The rotation feature of rotor blades is considered an important feature for 
identifying helicopters of interest [9, 10]. The Doppler modulation induced 
by rotating rotor blades is regarded as such a unique signature of helicopters. 
Representing the Doppler modulation in the joint time-frequency domain, the 
micro-Doppler signature of the rotor blades can be seen. Figure 3.11 is the 
micro-Doppler signature of a rotating two-blade rotor, where 8 flashes from the 
blade no. 1 and 8 flashes from the blade no. 2 can be seen clearly. 
For comparison, Figure 3.12 shows the micro-Doppler signature of a ro-
tating three-blade rotor, where each blade has 8 flashes and the total number of 
flashes is 24.
3.2.2 
RCS Model of Rotating Rotor Blades
To calculate EM scattering from rotating rotor blades, for simplicity, the blade 
in Figure 3.7 is simplified as a rigid, homogeneous, linear rectangular flat plate 
rotating about a fixed axis with a constant rotation rate and without consider-
ing the leading edge and the trailing edge. No flapping, lagging, and feathering 
are considered in the rectangular flat. The geometry of the rotor blade and the 
radar is illustrated in Figure 3.13. For a perfectly-conducting rectangular flat 
plate, the mathematical formula of the RCS can be found in [3, 11]. An ap-
proximation for the RCS of a rectangular flat plate is given by [3]. In the RCS 
formula, there are two terms: the peak RCS σPeak and the aspect factor σAspect:

PO Facet Prediction Model
Physical optics (PO) is a convenient method for predicting the RCS of any 
three-dimensional object. It is a high-frequency region (or optical region) pre-
diction and provides the best results for objects with a dimension much larger 
than the wavelength. The PO method applies to the illuminated surfaces, but 
does not apply edge diffractions, multiple reflections, or surface waves.
Any complex larger surface can be divided into many small surfaces, called 
facets. The facet used in the PO facet model is a triangular flat plate. The scat-
tered field from each facet can be calculated as if it were isolated without con-
sidering the effect of other facets. Thus, for a facet illuminated by the incident 
field, its surface current and scattered field can be calculated. For a shadowed 
surface, its surface current is set to zero. 
Based on the incident and scattered fields, the RCS of a surface is deter-
mined by

and |Es| and |Ei| are the amplitudes of the scattered and the incident electric 
fields, respectively. 
As shown in Figure 3.14, an incident wave is described by the spheri-
cal coordinate angles θ and ϕ. The polarization of an incident wave can be 
decomposed into two orthogonal components in terms of the angles θ and ϕ 
to represent the incident field in the spherical system. Thus, the incident field 
is represented by Ei = Eθnθ + Eϕnϕ, where nθ and nϕ are the unit vectors in the 
spherical system.
For calculating EM scattering from a facet defined by three vertices given 
by points P1, P2, and P3 with an arbitrary orientation, the body-fixed coordinate 
system is selected such that the triangular facet lies on the (x, y)-plane and the 
direction of its unit normal vector n is identical to the z-axis, as shown in Figure 
3.15. 
Because the radar is in the far zone and the size of the object is much 
smaller than the distance R0 from the radar to the object, the range vector R 
from the radar to the origin of the body-fixed coordinate (x, y, z) can be con-
sidered to be parallel to the vector R0. In the space-fixed coordinates, the unit 
vector of the radar LOS is nXYZ = [u, v, w], where u = sinθcosϕ, v = sin θsinϕ, 
and w = cosθ. In the body-fixed coordinates, any point P located at (xP, yP, zP) 
on the facet is represented by its position vector rP = [xP, yP, zP]. Thus, the scat-
tered field from the facet is given by [12]
Figure 3.14 The spherical coordinate system used in PO facet computation.

where Js is the surface current, A is the area of the facet, ℜimp is the impedance 
of free space, R is the range from the radar to the origin of the body-fixed coor-
dinates, and k = 2π/λ. Thus, the scattered field from the facet can be calculated 
by integrating the surface current over the area of the facet. Therefore, the RCS 
of the facet as a function of R, θ, and ϕ is obtained. References [12–14] provide 
MATLAB codes for calculating the RCS of a triangular facet.
The same procedure can be applied to a collection of facets of an object. 
Thus, the total RCS of the object is a superposition of the RCSs of all of the 
facets.
3.2.4 
Radar Backscattering from Rotor Blades
The rotation of a rotor blade can be easily obtained without using ordinary 
differential equations. The time-varying location and orientation is calculated 
using a rotation matrix with zero roll and pitch angles. The variation of its yaw 
angle is determined by the rotation rate and a given initial angle. Based on 
the location and orientation of a blade, the RCS and the reflected radar signal

from the blade can be calculated. Radar reflected signals from all blades can 
be obtained by the coherent superposition of the reflected signals from each 
individual blade. 
If a coherent radar system transmits a sequence of narrow rectangular 
pulses with the pulse width Δ and the pulse repetition interval ΔT, the base-
band signal in the receiver is
 
 
(3.39)
where NB is the total number of blades, np is the total number of pulses received 
during the observation interval, fc is the radar transmitted frequency, Rn(t) is the 
distance between the radar and the nth blade at time t, σn(t) is the RCS of the 
nth rotor blade at time t, and rect is the rectangular function defined by rect(t) 
= 1 (0 < t ≤ Δ).
In (3.39), two variables, σn(t) and Rn(t), must be calculated. The RCS of 
a perfectly-conducting rectangular flat plate, given by (3.37), can be used for 
the calculation of σn(t). Equation (3.37) is simple, but only accurate for aspect 
angles θ ≤ 20°. The distance variable Rn(t) is from the radar to a scatterer center, 
such as the centroid, of the rectangular plate. For a relatively large rectangular 
plate, the centroid can be far from the tip of the blade. Therefore, if the as-
signed scattering center is the centroid, by using the approximate rectangular 
RCS formulas, the calculated radar received signal does not include Doppler 
components generated by the tips of blades. Therefore, the scatterer center may 
be assigned to the tip of blade. 
The geometry of the radar and rotor blades is shown in Figure 3.16, where 
the radar is located at (X1 = 500m, Y1 = 0m, Z1 = 500m) with a wavelength 
of 0.0m at the C-band, the rotor center is located at (X0 = 0m, Y0 = 0m, Z0 = 
0m), the length of the blade is L = 6m with its root L1 = 0.5m and its tip L2 = 
6.5m, the width of the blade is W = 1m, and the rotation rate is Ω = 4 r/s. The 
azimuth angle ϕ and aspect angle θ can be calculated from the radar location, 
the rotor location, and the blade geometry. By assigning the scatterer center of 
each blade to the tip of the blade, the baseband signal in the radar receiver is ob-
tained from (3.39) and the RCS is calculated by (3.37) just for simplicity, even 
if it is not accurate. The accuracy of the RCS calculation only determines the 
magnitude’s distribution in the micro-Doppler signature; it does not affect the 
shape of the signature. After rearranging the np range profiles, 2-D pulse-range 
profiles are shown in Figure 3.17(a) for a two-blade rotor, and its micro-Dop-
pler signature is shown in Figure 3.17(b). The MATLAB code for calculating 
radar backscattering from rotor blades is listed in Appendix 3A.

The Micro-Doppler Effect in Radar  
From the range profiles, the rotating blades can be seen around range cell 
no. 1412 or about a 700-m distance from the radar. However, flashes cannot 
be seen because of the RCS is only assigned to one scatterer center. To see the 
flashes in the simulation, a more accurate RCS model is needed.
A simple but more accurate model for calculating radar backscattering 
from rotating rotor blades is the PO facet model. A rectangular blade is repre-
sented by the arrays of triangular facets as shown in Figure 3.18. The scatterer 
center of each triangle is assumed to be the geometric centroid of its triangle 
vertices. With the PO facet model, the baseband signal in the radar receiver is 
modified as

Based on the geometry of a rotating three-blade rotor illustrated in Figure 
3.18 and the same parameters used in the rotating two-blade rotor, the PO facet 
model-based radar range profiles and the micro-Doppler signature of the three-
blade rotor are shown in Figure 3.19, where the flashes of the rotating blades 
are seen clearly.
3.2.5 
Micro-Doppler Signatures of Rotor Blades
The micro-Doppler signature of the rotating three-blade’s rotor, shown in Fig-
ure 3.19(b), is obtained from a summation of the range profiles within a range 
gate where the blades are located and shown in Figure 3.19(a). The joint time-
frequency transform used to generate the signature is the STFT. Similarly, the 
range profiles and the micro-Doppler signature of a rotating two-blade rotor 
are shown in Figure 3.20, where, compared to the signature of the odd number 
of blades, different features for an even number of blades can be seen. With the 
PO facet model of rotor blades, the flashes appear in the micro-Doppler signa-
tures. For the two-blade rotor shown in Figure 3.20 with a 4 r/s rotation rate, 
each blade has 8 flashes in 1.0 second, and the interval between flashes is 0.125

second. For the three-blade rotor in Figure 3.19, there are total of 24 flashes in 
1.0 second, and the interval between two successive flashes is 0.0417 second.
Compared to the PO facet model prediction, Figure 3.21 shows the mi-
cro-Doppler signature of a two-blade rotor on a scale model helicopter mea-
sured by an X-band FMCW radar with the wavelength λ = 0.03m. Rotation 
rate of the rotor is about Ω = 2.33 r/s and the blade length is L = 0.2m. Thus, 
the tip velocity is Vtip = 2πLΩ = 2.93 m/s and the maximum Doppler shift is 
{fD}max = 195 Hz as shown in Figure 3.21. The signature is similar to that of the 
PO facet model prediction with flashes. From the micro-Doppler signature, the 
number of blades, the length of the blade, and the rotation rate of the rotor can 
be estimated.
3.2.6 
Required Minimum PRF 
For a pulsed Doppler radar, its PRF determines the sampling rate. The required 
minimum sampling rate must satisfy the Nyquist rate to avoid frequency alias-
ing. For actual helicopters, the range of their blade tip speed is around 200–
230 m/s. With an X-band radar, a blade tip speed of Vtip = 230 m/s can generate 
{fD}max = 15 kHz Doppler shift. Therefore, the required minimum sampling 
rate is 2 × {fD}max = 30 kHz for a hovering helicopter. If the helicopter has a 
translational motion with a radial velocity of 100 m/s, the maximum Doppler 
shift of the helicopter is 22 kHz, and the required minimum sampling rate can 
be 44 kHz [8].
Figure 3.22 demonstrates the impact of the sampling rate on the micro-
Doppler signatures of rotor blades. In the demonstration, the parameters of a 
two-blade rotor are the same as described before but with a lower rotation rate, 
Ω = 1 r/s. In this case, the tip velocity of the blade will be Vtip = 40.84 m/s or the 
Doppler shift of the tip is {fD}max = 1.36 kHz. Figure 3.22(a) is the micro-Dop-
pler signature of the rotor blades under a sampling rate of 512 samples/second, 
where the periodic motion of blades cannot be seen. Figure 3.22(b) shows the 
micro-Doppler signature of the same rotor blades with two times higher sam-
pling rate than 512 samples/second, and the periodic motion of blades begins 
to show up, but is incomplete. Figure 3.22(c) is the micro-Doppler signature 
of the rotor blades with 4 times the 512 sampling rate, and the periodic mo-
tion of blades can be seen clearly and is almost completed. In this example, the 
required minimum sampling rate should be 2 × {fD}max = 2.72 kHz. Therefore, 
to show the complete micro-Doppler signature, the sampling rate should be 
higher than 2.72 kHz.

Analysis and Interpretation of the Micro-Doppler Signature of Rotor Blades

the joint time-frequency domain to better explore the time-varying Doppler 
features. The micro-Doppler features of rotating rotor blades with two blades 
and three blades are depicted in Figures 3.23(a, b), respectively. It is obviously 
that the Doppler patterns of the even number of blades and the odd number 
of blades are different. Even-number blades generate a symmetric Doppler pat-
tern around the mean Doppler frequency, but odd-number blades generate an 
asymmetric pattern around it. From the micro-Doppler signature of the rotor 
blades represented in the joint time-frequency domain, the number of blades, 
the length of the blades, the rotation rate of the blades, and the speed of the 
tip can be estimated. These features are important for the classification of an 
unknown helicopter.

three blades.

Figure 3.24 is the micro-Doppler signature from the scale model-helicop-
ter with an X-band radar. From its symmetric Doppler pattern, the helicopter 
has two blades. Based on the estimated blade rotation period of TC = 0.43 
second and the peak Doppler of {fD}max = 195 Hz, the rotation rate Ω, blade 
diameter 2 × L, and tip velocity Vtip can be estimated. 
Table 3.1 lists a few features of different helicopters. These estimated fea-
ture parameters are important for classifying the type of an unknown helicopter.
3.3 Spinning Symmetric Top
A top stands steadily on a fixed tip point on its symmetric axis and quickly spins 
about the axis. If the spin axis is inclined, it will rotate sweeping out a vertical 
cone in a 3-D space as illustrated in Figure 3.25. This type of motion of is called 
the torque-induced precession. The angle between the symmetric axis and the 
vertical axis, called the precession axis angle, usually varies with time, and the 
symmetric axis is bobbing up and down, known as nutation. In mechanics, 
nutation refers to irregularities in the precession caused by the torque applied 
to the top.

radar.

Force-Free Rotation of a Symmetric Top
For a symmetric top, the principal moment I1 is equal to I2. If there is no exter-
nal torque on the top, the symmetric top will be rotating about an arbitrary axis 
with an angular velocity vector  = [Ω1, Ω2, Ω3]T, where Ω1, Ω2, and Ω3 are the 
instantaneous components of its angular velocity with respect to the principal 
axes. Then the Euler equations become

Torque-Induced Rotation of a Symmetric Top
Figure 3.26 illustrates a system model of a spinning symmetric top standing 
steadily on a fixed tip point of the top. The mass of the top is m and the princi-
pal moments of inertia with respect to the fixed-body coordinates are I1, I2, and 
I3. If the distance from the center of mass to the fixed tip point is L, then, under 
gravitational force, the Euler differential equations become [15]: 
 
 
(3.53)
where ϕ is the spinning angle and θ is the nutation angle. The angle ψ in Figure 
3.27 is the precession angle.
In order to incorporate the top’s motion into the EM simulation, the set 
of Euler’s equations (3.53) must be solved. Thus, the nonlinear dynamics of the 
top motion can be obtained. Under the gravity force, the spinning top with a 
fixed standing point should have a precession motion about an axis. Given the

velocities and the dynamic Euler angles. Figure 3.28 shows the position of the 
CM and the trajectory of the CM of the top motion. 
3.3.3 
RCS Model of a Symmetric Top
A symmetric top can be any symmetric geometric shape, such as a cone, a 
truncated cone (frustum), a cylinder, a sphere, or an ellipsoid. The mathemati-
cal formulas for calculating the RCS of these simple geometric shapes can be 
found in [3]. 
For a truncated cone as illustrated in Figure 3.29, the half cone angle α 
is determined by

Radar Backscattering from a Symmetric Top
The location and orientation of any point in a rotating symmetric top can be 
calculated by a rotation matrix and are time-varying. Based on the calculated 
location and orientation at each time instant, the RCS of the top can be cal-
culated in terms of a RCS model. Then, giving radar parameters and a signal 
waveform, the returned signal from the spinning top can be calculated. If a 
coherent radar system transmits a sequence of narrow rectangular pulses with 
a transmitted frequency fc, a pulse width Δ, and a pulse repetition interval ΔT, 
the baseband signal in the radar receiver is

where σ(t) is the RCS of the top, np is the total number of pulses received dur-

at time t.
The RCS formula (3.54) of a truncated cone is used for calculating σ(t), 
and the distance R(t) is calculated from the radar to the center of mass of the 
top. 
3.3.5 
Micro-Doppler Signatures Generated by a Precession Top
Given a radar location at (X = 20m, Y = 0m, Z = 0m) and the tip of the top at 
(X = 0m, Y = 0m, Z = 0m), the geometric configuration of the radar and the 
top is illustrated in Figure 3.30.
After rearranging the np range profiles, the range profiles of the spinning 
precession top are shown in Figure 3.31(a), and the micro-Doppler signature of 
the top is shown in Figure 3.31(b). In the range profiles, the rotating top can 
be seen around the range cell no. 667 or about 20m of the distance from the 
radar. The micro-Doppler signature of the spinning top is obtained from the 
summation of those range profiles that are within the range gate around 20m 
of range, where the top is located. The joint time-frequency transform used to 
generate the signature is the simple STFT. The MATLAB code for calculating 
radar backscattering from a spinning top is listed in Appendix 3A. 
3.3.6 
Analysis and Interpretation of the Micro-Doppler Signature of a Precession 
Top
During the radar observation time interval, the simulated spinning and pre-
cession top completed one cycle of precession and 27 cycles of nutation. The

Doppler modulation by precession and nutations is shown clearly in the micro-
Doppler signature in Figure 3.32. The RCS produced by the upper circular 
plate is not significant. However, the reflection from the edge of the upper 
circular plate, which is an interesting feature, is not considered in the simple 
RCS model. 
A more accurate simulation that shows the edge reflection of the upper 
circular plate can be found in [17, 18], where the mass of the top is m = 25 kg, 
the distance between the center of mass and the fixed tip point is L = 0.563m, 
the moments of inertia I1 = I2 = 0.117 kg m2 and I3 = 8.5 kg m2, and the initial

nature of the top.

nutation angle θ0 = 20°. The radar is an X-band radar at a 10-GHz transmitted 
frequency and a 500-MHz bandwidth, located at a 12-m distance from the tip 
of the top. The more accurate RCS prediction model utilizes a multitude of dif-
ferent backscattering algorithms, including geometrical optics, physical optics, 
the physical theory of diffraction, and the method of moments solutions.
The micro-Doppler signature of the above spinning top is shown in Fig-
ure 3.33. From the signature, about one Doppler modulation cycle of the pre-
cession during the observation time of 5.3 seconds can be seen clearly. There 
are also 12.5 Doppler modulation cycles of nutations as shown in Figure 3.33, 
and the Doppler modulation produced by the top upper circular plate disk is 
marked in Figure 3.33. 
It should be emphasized that, in a precession top, the inertia ratio I1/I3 is 
an important characteristic. It can be estimated from the measured precession 
angular velocity, the spinning angular velocity, and the precession angle.

3.4 Wind Turbines
Since the use of wind energy has been dramatically increasing, the large num-
bers of wind turbines and the large RCS of the wind turbine blade become 
challenges to current radar systems as illustrated in Figure 3.34. A typical tur-
bine could have a RCS in the order of 60 dBms (or 106 m2) at the X-band [19]. 
Impacts of wind turbines on radar performance, including air traffic control 
systems, navigation systems, weather radar systems, and other primary or sec-
ondary radar systems, have been investigated and reported [19–28]. 
A wind turbine consists of a tower, a power-generating nacelle, and tur-
bine blades. The power-generating nacelle slowly rotates its direction to enable 
turbine blades to face to the wind. Even if it is slow rotating, the nacelle can 
still be considered a virtually stationary object. The actually moving parts of 
the wind turbine are the turbine blades. The blade is a large, aerodynamically 
shaped structure that operates like a rotor blade of a helicopter. Its motion ki-
nematic and dynamic properties are similar to those of helicopter rotor blades. 
Thus, the mathematical model, motion dynamics, and EM scattering model of 
helicopter rotor blades are also suitable to the wind turbines.
Figure 3.33 The micro-Doppler signature produced by a spinning, precession, and nutation 
top with an upper circular plate disk. (After: [17].)

140 
The Micro-Doppler Effect in Radar  
The Doppler frequency shift produced by the rotating blades of wind 
turbines has an impact on the ability of radars to discriminate the wind turbine 
from a flying aircraft. Even if the rotor rotation rate is low, however, a large 
blade diameter makes its tip velocity falling in the range of 50 to 150 m/s, 
which is within a speed range of an aircraft. The large physical size of the blade 
produces a substantial RCS and a broader spectrum. Consequently, the wind 
turbine blades viewing from radars appear as a moving aircraft.
3.4.1 
Micro-Doppler Signatures of Wind Turbines
The wind turbine has a unique EM signature even that varies with environmen-
tal conditions [21, 27, 28]. Using the PO facet method, the micro-Doppler sig-
nature of a rotating three-blade turbine rotor is shown in Figure 3.35, where the 
length of the blade is 30m and the width of the blade is 1m, and the rotation 
rate is 0.25 r/s or rotating one cycle in 4 seconds. In the micro-Doppler signa-
ture of the wind turbine blades, flashes at the receding and approaching points 
can be seen. There are a total of six flashes from three blades in 4 seconds. The 
interval between two flashes produced by two successive blades is 1.33 seconds. 
Compared with a single turbine, the micro-Doppler signatures from 
multiple wind turbines are much more complicated. All turbines in a wind 
farm may not be aligned to the same direction and turbine directions may vary 
widely. The effects of multiple turbines on the RCS are beyond the purpose of 
this book. 
3.4.2 
Analysis and Interpretation of the Micro-Doppler Signature of Wind 
Turbines
Similar to the micro-Doppler signatures of helicopter rotors in Section 3.2.5, 
the micro-Doppler signature of wind turbines has strong components near zero 
Figure 3.34 Wind turbines observed by radar systems.

 
The Micro-Doppler Effect of the Rigid Body Motion 
141
Doppler due to strong the stationary reflections from the tower, nacelle, and 
other ground clutter. Its RCS is much higher than the RCS of the helicopter’s 
rotor blades. However, the oscillation rate is much lower than the helicopter 
rotors. It is easy to distinguish the micro-Doppler signatures of wind turbines 
from that of helicopters, especially when a helicopter is moving and the center 
line of its micro-Doppler signature is shifted from zero Doppler.
In addition, the micro-Doppler signatures of wind turbines can also have 
Doppler components of multiple bounces. The multibounce effect may occur 
if radar waves are reflected off two different surfaces before returning to the ra-
dar receiver. In wind turbines, the multibounce occurs while radar-transmitted 
waves are reflected from large turbine blades to the turbine tower and then 
again to the blades before returning to the radar receiver.

The Micro-Doppler Effect of the Nonrigid 
Body Motion
The nonrigid body is a deformable body, that is, the distance between two 
points in the body could vary during body motion and thus the shape of the 
body could be changed. However, as mentioned in Chapter 2, when studying 
radar scattering from a nonrigid body motion, the body can be modeled as 
jointly connected rigid links or segments, and a nonrigid body motion can be 
treated as multiple rigid bodies’ motion.
The human gait has been studied in biomedical engineering, sports medi-
cine, physiotherapy, medical diagnosis, and rehabilitation [1]. Motivated by 
athletic performance analysis, visual surveillance, and biometrics, the methods 
of how to extract and analyze various human body movements have attracted 
much attention. The most commonly used method for human movement anal-
ysis uses visual image sequences [2]. However, visual perception of the human 
body motion can be affected by distance, variations in lighting, deformations 
of clothing, and occlusions on the appearance of human body segments. Radar, 
as an EM sensor, has been widely used for detecting, tracking, and imaging 
targets of interest because of its long-range capability, excellent day and night 
performance, and ability to penetrate wall and ground. Thus, radar has become 
a tool for detecting and tracking humans and animals.
Beside human body motion, animal motion is also an important nonrigid 
body motion. Compared to human bipedal motion, the four-legged animal’s 
motion has more choices for its feet striking the ground. In 1887, E. Muybridge 
documented animal locomotion using photography and published a book on 
animal locomotion that showed how lions, donkeys, dogs, deer, and elephants 
strode and ran [3]. Later, based on the understanding of animal locomotion, 

158 
The Micro-Doppler Effect in Radar  
legged machines appeared [4]. Due to the fixed motion pattern, the perfor-
mance of such legged machines was very limited. Realizing the insufficiency 
of fixed motion patterns, a better walking machine using controlled legs was 
constructed [5].
With the understanding of the locomotion, the dynamic/kinematic char-
acteristics and movement patterns of human and animal motions became hot 
topics in computer vision and computer graphics [2]. Point-light displays were 
used to demonstrate animated patterns of human and animal movements. Ob-
servers can certainly identify human and animal motions through a limited 
number of animated point-light displays [6]. 
Radar has proven its ability to detect targets with small RCSs, such as 
humans and animals. However, the methods of how to analyze human or ani-
mal dynamic/kinematic characteristics and extract motion patterns from radar 
returns are a challenge. 
As a matter of fact, in most radar range-Doppler imagery, the Doppler 
modulation induced by the target’s rotation, vibration, or human body loco-
motion has been observed; these show up as characteristic Doppler frequency 
distributions at those range cells that correspond to locations of these micro 
motion sources. Examples of such sources include the rotating antennas on a 
ship, the rotor blades of a helicopter, the swinging arms and legs of a human, 
or another oscillatory motion characteristic in a target. To generate a clear ra-
dar imagery of a moving target, motion compensation and image autofocusing 
algorithms must be used to remove target translational motion and oscillatory 
motion components for reducing the induced Doppler distributions in the ra-
dar imagery. 
However, in order to extract vibration, rotation, or locomotion charac-
teristics in radar returns, the induced Doppler distributions should not be re-
moved. Instead, they should be further exploited. During the past decade, the 
radar micro-Doppler signatures of targets have been studied from experimental 
observations to theoretical analysis [7–14]. As discussed in Chapter 1, micro-
Doppler signatures are represented in a joint time-frequency domain that pro-
vides an additional time dimension to exploit time-varying micro-Doppler 
characteristics of the rotating or vibrating components in targets. The micro-
Doppler characteristics reflect the motion kinematics of a target and provide a 
unique identification of the target’s movement. By carefully analyzing various 
attributes in the characteristic signature, information about the kinematics of 
the target can be extracted; this is the basis for discriminating the movement 
and characterizing the activity of the target. In Chapter 5, the methods of how 
to analyze micro-Doppler signatures and how to extract component signatures 
associated with the target’s structural component parts will be introduced and 
discussed. 

 
The Micro-Doppler Effect of the Nonrigid Body Motion 
       159                 
The radar micro-Doppler signatures of human gaiting have been investi-
gated since the late 1990s [7, 8]. However, very few works on radar micro-Dop-
pler signatures of quadrupedal animals have been published so far. Most of the 
animal signatures simply illustrate the complicated micro-Doppler signatures 
of animal motion from collected real radar data. No animal locomotion models 
are available. Further studies on the theoretical basis and the simulations of 
animals’ motion are needed.
In this chapter, the biomechanical analysis methods and kinematics of 
typical nonrigid bodies’ motion are introduced. The kinematic model used for 
describing human motion is given. Based on the kinematic model, a simulation 
study and the micro-Doppler signature analysis for humans can be easily per-
formed, simulated, and analyzed. Radar micro-Doppler signatures of human 
movements are extracted and analyzed. The micro-Doppler signatures of flap-
ping birds are modeled, simulated, and analyzed in Section 4.2, and quadrupe-
dal animals are introduced in Section 4.3. 
4.1 Human Body Articulated Motion
The motion of human bodies is an articulated locomotion. The motion of limbs 
in a human body can be characterized by a repeated periodic movement. The 
human gait is a highly coordinated periodic movement with brain, muscles, 
nerves, joints, and bones.
Walking is a typical human articulated motion and can be decomposed 
into a periodic motion in the gait cycle. The human walking cycle consists of 
two phases: the stance phase and the swing phase. During the stance phase, 
the foot is on the ground with a heel strike and a toe off. In the swing phase, 
the foot is lifted from the ground with acceleration or deceleration. Methods 
used for human gait analysis can be a visual analysis, sensor measurements, and 
a kinematic system that measures displacements, velocities, accelerations, ori-
entations of body segments, and angles of joints. Various human movements, 
such as walking, running, or jumping, have different body movement patterns. 
Radar micro-Doppler signatures are not sensitive to distance, light conditions, 
and background complexity, which are suffered by visual image sequences, and 
can be used to estimate periodicities of gaiting, the period of stance phase, and 
the period of the swing phase. 
4.1.1 
Human Walking
The human walk is a periodic motion with each foot from one position of 
support to the next position of support, periodically swinging arms and legs 
and periodically moving the body’s center of gravity up and down. Even if the 

160 
The Micro-Doppler Effect in Radar  
human walk has the same general manner, the individual human gait is still car-
rying personalized characteristics. This is why people can recognize a friend at a 
distance from his or her walking style [14]. Therefore, human gait analysis may 
be also useful for personal identification through the way a person walks. In ad-
dition, the emotional aspects of human gait are often observed in practice. For 
example, the gait of a cheerful person is quite different from that of a depressed 
person. Therefore, catching any emotion-like gaiting can help in detecting the 
anomalous behavior of the person. Another important aspect of human gait 
analysis is in medical applications, such as the medical diagnosis, sports medi-
cine, physiotherapy, and rehabilitation.
Both the dynamic method and the kinematic method can be used to gen-
erate human motion. If the motion is created without considering the forces 
involved, the kinematic method can be easily used to calculate positions of 
articulated body segments from joint angles as forward kinematics. Then in-
verse kinematics can be used for determining joint angles from the segments’ 
positions. 
Kinematic parameters are the essential parameters of human motion. 
These parameters are linear position (or displacement), linear velocity, linear 
acceleration, angular position, angular velocity, and angular acceleration. To 
completely describe any human motion in a 3-D Cartesian coordinate system, 
the linear kinematic parameters of position, velocity, and acceleration define 
the manner in which the position of any point in the human body changes over 
time. Velocity is the rate of the position change with respect to time. Accelera-
tion defines the rate of velocity change with respect to time. These three kine-
matic parameters can be used to understand the motion characteristics of any 
movement. The acceleration can be measured directly with an accelerometer. 
The corresponding velocity can be estimated by integrating the acceleration, 
and the corresponding position can be estimated by integrating the velocity.
Angular kinematic parameters include angular positions (or orientations) 
of body segments, called segment angles. Because the human body is consid-
ered by a number of segments linked by joints, the joint angles are very useful 
parameters. Angular velocity is the rate of angle change with respect to time, 
and angular acceleration is the rate of angular velocity change with respect to 
time. These three angular kinematic parameters are used to describe the angular 
motion of human body segments. 
When a rigid body segment undergoes an angular rotation, the linear 
velocity and acceleration of the rigid body can be calculated from the angular 
velocity and acceleration. In the global coordinate system, the angular motion 
of a rigid body is described by its angular velocity and acceleration. Thus, the 
linear velocity of a point in the rigid body can be determined by its tangential 
velocity and normal velocity. The tangential velocity of the point of interest can 
be derived from the angular velocity and its distance from the rotation center. 

 
The Micro-Doppler Effect of the Nonrigid Body Motion 
       161                 
Then the tangential acceleration of the point is determined by the angular ac-
celeration and the distance from the rotation center. Remember that the tan-
gential and normal velocities and accelerations are given in the body-fixed local 
coordinate system. By using the body segment’s angular orientation with simple 
trigonometric identities, tangential and normal velocities and accelerations can 
be easily converted to the global coordinate system. 
4.1.2 
Description of the Periodic Motion of Human Walking
The nature of human walking is its periodicity. Figure 4.1 illustrates the move-
ment of human walking in one cycle [1]. The stance phase occupies about 60% 
of the cycle, and the swing phase occupies the rest of the cycle. In the stance 
phase, one foot is in contact with the ground. In the swing phase, the foot is 
lifted from the ground and the leg is swinging and preparing next stride. This 
cyclic movement is repeated over and over again.
The stance phase consists of three periods: (1) first double support, where 
both feet are contacting with the ground; (2) single limb stance, where only one 
foot is in contact with the ground and the other foot is swinging; and (3) second 
double support, where both feet are in contact with the ground again. 
During the stance phase, there are five events: heel strike, foot-flat, mid-
stance, heel-off, and toe-off. The heel strike initiates the gait cycle, and the toe-
off terminates the stance phase because the foot lifts from the ground.
During the swing phase, there are no double support periods and only 
single limb swinging. Three events are associated with the swing phase: forward 
acceleration of the leg, mid-swing when the foot passes directly beneath the 
body, and deceleration of the leg to stabilize the foot for preparing for the next 
heel strike.

4.1.3 
Simulation of Human Movements
To simulate human movements, a movement model that describes the move-
ment of interest and a body model that describes the human body are needed. 
The modeling of human movement can be a mathematical model or an empiri-
cal model. Mathematical modeling is constructing a set of equations and simu-
lating the human movement using a computer. An empirical model is based on 
large amounts of human motion data to formulate empirical human motion 
equations and construct a computer model of the human movement. Then 
human body model used in biomechanical engineering simplifies the human 
body and has only as many rigid body segments as needed that are controlled 
in their movements by joint moments. In the simulation of human movement, 
the simplified human body model will be used.
Even if the best way to collect human movement data is from human 
subjects, however, generating human movement data through computer simu-
lation is still desirable. Simulation allows researchers to study a single parameter 
isolated from other parameters in the model or to study in conditions where 
human subjects cannot be tested. Therefore, simulations are important in hu-
man movement studies.
4.1.4 
Human Body Segment Parameters
The Denavit-Hartenberg convention (D-H convention) [15, 16] is a widely 
used kinematic representation that describes the positions of human body links 
and joints. The D-H convention states that each link has its own coordinate 
system with its z-axis in the direction of the joint axis, the x-axis aligned with 
the outgoing link, and the y-axis orthogonal to the x- and z-axes using a right-
handed coordinate system as shown in Figure 4.2.
Once the coordinate systems are determined, the interlink transforma-
tions are uniquely described by four parameters: θ is the joint angle about the 
previous z or z1 from the old x or x1 to the new x or x2; d is the link offset along 
the previous z to the common normal; a is the length of the common normal; 
and α is the angle about the common normal, from the old z-axis or z1 to the 
new z-axis or z2 as marked in Figure 4.2. Thus, every link-joint pair is described 
as a coordinate transform from the previous coordinate system to the next co-
ordinate system.
Any segment in a human body is assumed to be a rigid link, such that the 
segment size, shape, mass, center of gravity location, and moments of inertia 
do not change during movements. Under this assumption, a human body is 
modeled as joints and interconnected rigid links. The movement of such a rigid 
segment has six degrees of freedom (DOF): three positions in 3-D Cartesian 
coordinates and three Euler angles of rotation.

 
The Micro-Doppler Effect of the Nonrigid Body Motion 
       163                 
The kinematic model of the human body is a hierarchical model of the 
body links’ connectivity, where a family of parent-child spatial relationships are 
defined and joints become the nodes of the tree structured human body model. 
In this kinematic tree, all body coordinates are local coordinate systems relative 
to their parents. Any transformation of a node only affects its children nodes, 
but a transformation of the base (root) node will affect all children nodes in the 
body tree.
To estimate the kinematic parameters of body segments, Boulic, Thal-
man, and Thalman [17] proposed a global human walking model based on 
an empirical mathematical parameterization using biomechanical experimental 
data. This global walking model averages out the personification of walking. 
This global human walking model will be introduced and used for human gait 
analysis and study of the micro-Doppler signatures of the human gait.
Motion capture methods use sensors to capture human movements. Sen-
sors can be active sensors, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, 
or passive sensors (e.g., video cameras). The Graphics Laboratory at the Carn-
egie Mellon University uses 12 infrared cameras to capture motions with 41 
markers placed on human body segments [18]. The markers’ positions and ori-
entations in 3-D space are tracked with a 120-Hz frame rate and stored in a 
database. In this book, the simulation of radar returns from human walking is 
based on the empirical mathematical parameterization model [17], and more 
complex human movements, such as running, jumping, and other movements, 
are based on captured motion data provided in the Carnegie Mellon database 
[18].

4.1.5 
Human Walking Model Derived from Empirical Mathematical 
Parameterizations
Boulic, Thalmann, and Thalmman proposed a global human walk model based 
on empirical mathematical parameterizations derived from biomechanical ex-
perimental data [17]. Because this model is based on averaging parameters from 
experimental measurements, it is an averaging human walking model without 
information about personalized motion features. Although the method is for 
modeling human walking, its principle is also applicable to other human move-
ments if experimental data is available. In this section, the computer algorithm 
and the source codes for implementation of this human walking model will 
be described in detail and will be used to study the micro-Doppler signatures 
of human walking. To more easily follow Boulic, Thalmann, and Thalmman’s 
paper [17], the symbols used in this section are the same as those used in the 
paper. The MATLAB source code for the global human walking model in this 
chapter is based on [17]. A more detailed description of the empirical equations 
used in [17] may help to understand the MATLAB simulation of the global 
human walking model. The source code on the global human walking model 
is very long because of too many human body segments used. However, it may 
help readers to understand the whole procedure of the simulation.
This global walking model is derived based on a large number of experi-
mental data but not from solving motion equations. It is intended to provide 
3-D spatial positions and orientations of any segment of a walking human body 
as function of time. Specifically, the motion is described by 12 trajectories, 3 
translations, and 14 rotations, five of which are duplicated for both sides of the 
body, as listed in Table 4.1. These translations and rotations describe one cycle 
of walking motion (i.e., from right heel strike to right heel strike). They are all 
dependent on the walking velocity. 
According to [17], trajectories are described in three methods. Six trajec-
tories are given by sinusoidal expressions (one of them by a piecewise function), 
and six trajectories are represented by cubic spline functions passing through 
control points located at the extremities of these trajectories. 
Given a relative walking velocity VR in m/s (which is normalized by the 
height of the leg, i.e., rescaled by a dimensionless value of Ht), the relative 
length of one walking cycle is empirically expressed by 
1.346
C
R
R
V
=

 in 
meters. Then the time duration of a cycle is defined by TC = RC/VR in seconds, 
and the relative time is normalized by a dimensionless value of TC is tR = t/TC in 
seconds. The time duration of support is TS = 0.752TC − 0.143, and the time 
duration of double support is TDS = 0.252TC − 0.143. The body-fixed local 
coordinate system is centered at the origin of the spine. The height of the origin 
of the spine is about 58% of the human height H in meters.
Thus, the translational trajectories are:

Because these single equations and piecewise functions are differentiable 
through a multiple cycle of a time span, the method used to calculate the final 
result is to form a spline function by placing two additional sets of control 
points in that there is one cycle before and one cycle after the time span that 
represents the current cycle. Only the data from the middle cycle is used to 
guarantee continuity and differentiability when repeated periodically. 
Having correctly calculated the necessary movement trajectories, a work-
able walking model can be developed using these trajectories to calculate the

location of a series of 17 reference points on the human body in 3-D space: 
head, neck, base of spine, left and right shoulders, elbows, hands, hips, knees, 
ankles, and toes. The (x,y,z)-coordinates are defined as the positive x direction 
is forward, the positive y direction is right, the positive z direction is up, and the 
base of the spine is situated at the origin (see Figure 4.15).
The 3-D orientation of a body segment is determined by locating the 17 
joint points based on the body reference coordinates centered at the origin of 
the spine as illustrated in Figure 4.16. From the flexing angle functions and the 
translations of the joint points described by the model of biomechanical experi-
mental data, the Euler angle rotation matrix is used to calculate the positions 
of the 17 joint points at each frame time. By carefully handling the flexing and 
translation, the 3-D trajectories of these joint points are obtained. These linear 
and angular kinematic parameters of a walking human are used to simulate 
radar returns from the human. 
In [19] a list of the length of each human body segment normalized by 
the height of the human is given. The human model used in this book has 17 
reference joint points and segment lengths, as shown in Figure 4.17. 
To calculate the location of each reference point based on the trajectories, 
the Euler rotation matrix is applied based on the XYZ convention, where the 
roll angle is ψ, the pitch angle is θ, and the yaw angle is ϕ. After the rotation 
transformations, the location of the reference points can be obtained. To allow 
for the accurate calculation of body reference points based on multiple angles,

the outermost angles must be account for first (see Figure 4.18). Translations 
are then handled after contributions from angles have been accounted for.
Given a series of reference points over a period of time, animating a model 
using this data has confirmed the validity of the model. Animating this model 
shows that the model is able to produce a proper walking human model (see 
Figure 4.19). Appendix 4A lists the MATLAB source code to implement the 
human walking model proposed in [17] and to visualize an animated walking 
human.
The trajectories of individual body parts of the walking person in part are 
shown in Figure 4.20, and the corresponding radial velocities are calculated and 
shown in Figure 4.21. The radial velocity pattern of the person in Figure 4.22 is 
identical to the micro-Doppler signature of radar backscattering from a walking 
person shown in Section 4.1.9.

Capturing Human Motion Kinematic Parameters
To capture human motion, the sensors used can be active or passive. Active sen-
sors transmit signals to a human object and receive the reflected signals from the 
object. Passive sensors do not transmit any signal and only receive reflected sig-
nals from objects illuminated by other sources. Markers used in motion capture 
systems can be passive or active [20, 21]. Light-point displays are useful active 
markers that appeared in the 1970s [22] and clearly demonstrated various mo-
tion signatures of different animals.
For sensing 3-D motion, commonly used active sensors include acceler-
ometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, acoustic sensors, and even radar sensors. 
An accelerometer is a small sensor attached to an object for measuring its ac-
celeration. It measures deflection caused by the movements of the sensor and

The Micro-Doppler Effect in Radar  
converts the deflection into an electrical signal. An electromagnetic sensor is 
attached to joints of any two connected segments and measures the orientation 
and position of the joint points with respect to the Earth’s magnetic field. These 
active sensors are now widely used to track the positions of joints or segments 
in a 3-D space. 
However, accurate estimates of the corresponding displacement and ve-
locity from the measured acceleration are critical. The velocity is determined 
by the integral of the acceleration with respect to time, and the displacement 
is the integral of the velocity with respect to time. For correctly performing the 
integration process, the measured acceleration histories must be integrated by 
iteratively adding successive changes in the velocity. Thus, the velocity history 
and displacement history are computed by

samples, ai is the measured acceleration at the sampling time i, vi is the esti-

mated velocity at the sampling time i, xi is the estimated displacement at the 
sampling time i, and i = 1, 2, …, N, where N is the total number of samples 
of measured acceleration. The first initial velocity and displacement must be 
known. For a movement activity starting statically, the first initial velocity and 
displacement can be set to zeros. Otherwise, they have to be measured by using 
other methods.
For sensing rotational motion, gyroscopes may be used. By combining a 
gyroscope with an accelerometer, full 6 DOF data are captured. Human body 
motion in 3-D space can be completely described by the 6 DOF: linear ac-
celeration along each axis and angular rotation about each axis. Therefore, the 
combination of the accelerometer and the gyroscope may be used as a complete 
motion-sensing device for capturing human movement information.
A commonly used passive sensing for capturing human motion kinemat-
ics is optical motion-caption system equipped with multiple cameras to record 
motions of optical markers attached to the moving parts of the human body to 
be measured. The orientation and arrangement of multiple cameras are illus-
trated in Figure 4.23. Each camera captures data in 2-D coordinates and each 
optical sensor (marker) can be seen by at least two cameras. From these sets of 
2-D coordinates, the motion data in 3-D coordinates can be calculated. Then 
the direct linear transform [23, 24] may be used to represent markers from 2-D 
camera coordinates to 3-D space.

Three-Dimensional Kinematic Data Collection
The motion capture database collected by the Graphics Laboratory at the 
Carnegie Mellon University is available in the public domain and is very use-
ful for studying human movements [18]. Twelve infrared cameras a with 120-
Hz frame rate are placed around a rectangular area to capture human motion 
data. Humans wear a jumpsuit with 41 markers on it. The cameras can see the 
markers in infrared. The images from the 12 cameras are processed to gener-
ate data of a 3-D human skeleton movement. The skeleton movement data is 
then stored in a pair of data files. The ASF (skeleton) file in the pair describes 
information about the skeleton and joints, and the AMC (motion capture) file 
of the pair contains the movement data. 
In the ASF file, the lengths and directions of 30 bone segments are given. 
There are a total of 30 body segments read out from the AFS file. They are left 
and right hip joints, left and right femurs, left and right tibias, left and right 
feet, left and right toes, lower back, upper back, thorax, lower neck, upper neck, 
head, left and right clavicles, left and right humerus, left and right radius, left 
and right wrists, left and right hands, left and right fingers, and left and right 
thumbs. For studying human walking, running, leaping, or jumping, finger 
and thumb data may not be necessary. 
In the motion capture database, the motion of a human object is in the 
x-z plane with the forwarding direction along the positive z-axis, which is dif-
ferent from the coordinates defined in the human walking model derived in 
[17] where the human object moves in the x-y plane with the forwarding direc-
tion along the positive x direction. 
The root of the skeleton hierarchy is a special segment that does not have 
the direction and length. In the AMC file, the root only contains the starting 
position and rotation order information. The rotations and directions of other 
bone segments in the hierarchy are calculated in the AMC file. The rotation of a 
segment is defined by its axis. The direction of the segment defines the direction 
from the parent segment to the child segments.
To calculate the global transform for each segment, start by calculating 
the local transform matrix using the translation offset matrix from its parent 
segment and the rotation axis matrix. Using the motion data contained in the 
AMC file and the skeleton defined in the ASF file, the linear and angular ki-
nematic parameters are available for the animation of human movement and 
calculating radar returns from human with movements. 
From the captured kinematic database, 3-D motion trajectories of human 
body segments can be constructed. Figure 4.24 shows a human 2-D position 
trajectory extracted from the kinematic data of the human root point (i.e., the 
base of the spine), beginning with walking forward, then sideway stepping, 
then walking backward, and finally walking diagonally. Figure 4.25 shows the

       183                 
reconstructed animated human model walking sideway stepping and walking 
backward. 
However, the human movement trajectory in Figure 4.24 does not indi-
cate if the human is walking or running, walking forward or walking backward,

and walking upstairs or walking downstairs. Besides the reconstructed animated 
human movement as shown in Figure 4.25, the use of angle-cyclogram patterns 
is an additional method to identify detailed human movement. The angle cy-
clogram is a phase-space representation of two joint angles.
4.1.8 
Characteristics of Angular Kinematics Using the Angle-Cyclogram Pattern
A dynamic system, such as human locomotion, can be described by a set of state 
variables. The joint angles or joint velocities are these state variables and can 
be used to represent the human locomotion. Measurable locomotion descrip-
tors, such as the step size, step frequency, and time durations of swing, stance, 
or double support, are important for the locomotion. To describe any repeti-
tive movement activity, the cyclogram is a useful method [25]. Instead of de-
scribing one individual joint kinematics, the cyclogram describes a coordinated 
movement of two joints linked by two or more segments. The perimeter of the 
cyclogram is a zero-order moment. The position of the center of mass of the 
cyclogram is a combination of the zero-order and the first-order moments [25]. 
The angle-angle cyclogram of human locomotion describes the posture of 
the leg and the coordination of the hip joint and the knee joint. It is a function 
of the slope and the speed of human locomotion. However, the angle-angle 
cyclogram does not describe the velocities involved in the leg (including the 
femur and the tibia). The angle-velocity phase diagram is a trajectory in the 
phase space and represents the dynamics of a joint. However, the angle-velocity 
phase gram has no information about the coordination between two joints. 
Therefore, the combination of the angle-angle cyclogram with the angle-veloci-
ty phase diagram provides informative signatures of human locomotion. 
Figure 4.26 depicts the joint angles defined in the human lower body. The 
hip joint angle can have positive and negative values. However, the knee joint 
angle can have only a single signed value, for which either a negative sign or a 
positive sign depends on how the angle is defined. 
Figure 4.27 shows an example of joint trajectories (i.e., variations of joint 
angle with time) of a walking human. The hip and knee joint angles of the 
walking human are from the motion capture database.
In the cyclogram shown in Figure 4.28, the knee joint angle is plotted 
against the hip joint angle for a complete walking cycle with arrows that in-
dicate time increases. The backward walking shows the revised time arrows as 
shown in Figure 4.29(b). Figures 4.29(c, d) demonstrate different cyclograms 
of a forward running and a jumping person, respectively.
4.1.9 
Radar Backscattering from a Walking Human
Having animated a human movement model, it is easy to calculate radar back-
scattering from the human. PO facet models can be used to calculate the RCSs 

 
The Micro-Doppler Effect of the Nonrigid Body Motion 
       185                 
of human body segments. In this case, human body models should be more ac-
curate computer-aided design (CAD) or 3-D graphics models that allow users 
to build more accurate human bodies. 
For simplicity, in this book, human body segments are modeled by el-
lipsoids. The RCS of an ellipsoid, RCSellip is given in (3.23), where a, b, and 
c represent the length of the three semiaxes of the ellipsoid in the x, y, and z 
directions, respectively. The incident aspect angle θ and the azimuth angle ϕ 
represent the orientation of the ellipsoid relative to the radar and are illustrated 
in Figure 4.30. These RCS formulas are used to simulate radar backscattering 
from a human with movements. It should be mentioned that if human body 
segments are modeled by 3-D ellipsoids, the use of PO facet to calculate the 
RCSs of ellipsoids is not necessary.
Figure 4.31(a) illustrates the geometry of a radar and a walking human, 
where the radar is located at (X1 = 10m, Y1 = 0m, Z1 = 2m) with a wavelength 
of 0.02m and the starting point of the human base is located at (X0 = 0m, Y0 = 
0m, Z0 = 0m). The wavelength of the radar is 0.02m. Using the human walking 
model derived in [11], assume that the relative velocity of the walking person is 
VR = 1.0 sec−1, the height of the person is H = 1.8m, and the mean value of the 
torso velocity of the person is 1.33 m/s. The corresponding Doppler frequency 
shift at a given wavelength of 0.02m is 2 × 1.33/0.02 = 133 Hz. 
With the human modeled by ellipsoidal body segments, the radar back-
scattering from the walking human can be calculated and the 2-D pulse-range 
profiles are shown in Figure 4.31(b). The micro-Doppler signature derived

components of the torso, foot, tibia, and clavicle are indicated through the 
simulation of separated human body segments. 
4.1.10 Human Movement Data Processing
In measured radar data, due to background objects and unwanted moving ob-
jects, range profiles show strong clutter. To extract the useful data in range 
profiles, the clutter must be suppressed. Fortunately, most background objects 
are stationary and the background clutter can be easily suppressed by a notch 
filter. Radar backscattering from unwanted moving objects may also be filtered 
as long as they can be distinguished by their ranges and speeds. 
4.1.10.1 Clutter Suppression
Clutter suppression techniques utilize statistical properties of radar returns 
from stationary objects, which are usually near zero mean Doppler frequency

The Micro-Doppler Effect in Radar  
and have a smaller bandwidth of the spectrum. The returns from a moving 
human are offset from the zero Doppler shifts because of its radial velocity. As 
illustrated in Figure 4.32, a band-reject filter with a notch around zero velocity 
can reject most of the clutter without affecting the human motion signal as long 
as the mean velocity of the human motion is larger than the notch width. Figure 
4.32(a) illustrates the Doppler spectrum of clutter and the Doppler spectrum of 
the human motion. Figure 4.32(b) shows the frequency response of the notch 
filter and Figure 4.32(d) shows the spectrum of the radar range profiles before 
notch filtering and after notch filtering. Figure 4.32(c) illustrates the Doppler 
spectrum after clutter suppression and the clutter cleaned range profiles are 
shown. The efficiency of the clutter suppression method depends on the notch 
depth and the relative width of the notch as well as the clutter properties. How-
ever, the residue from a strong clutter may still produce a significant bias in 
Figure 4.29 The hip-knee cyclogram patter of: (a) forward walking, (b) backward walking, (c) 
forward running, and (d) jumping.

estimating Doppler frequency of a human motion. The desired average clutter 
suppression should be more than 40 dB. 
4.1.10.2 Time-Frequency Analysis of the Clutter Suppressed Data
The clutter suppressed data, as shown in Figure 4.32(c), should be used to 
calculate the time-frequency micro-Doppler signature of the walking human 
as shown in Figure 4.33. The micro-Doppler signatures represented in the 
joint time-frequency domain help to build a more comprehensive signature 
knowledge database for various micro-motion dynamics. The classification and 
identification of human motion behavior will be based on the micro-Doppler 
signature knowledge database. 
4.1.11 Human Movement–Induced Radar Micro-Doppler Signatures
As shown in Figure 4.33, the radar micro-Doppler signature of a walking hu-
man is derived by taking the time-frequency transform to the radar range pro-
files. In the micro-Doppler signature, each forward leg swing appears as large 
peaks, and the left- and right-leg swings complete one gait cycle. The body 
torso motion that is the stronger component underneath the leg swings tends 
to have a slightly saw-tooth shape because the body speeds up and slows down 
during the swing as shown.

ing the orientation of the ellipsoidal human body segment relative to the radar.

The micro-Doppler signature is actually an integrated Doppler history of 
individual body segments during a given observation time. Unlike the captured 
kinematic data by motion sensing, the radar Doppler history data only carry 
radial velocity information. Therefore, from the micro-Doppler signatures, the 
animated body movement model cannot be reconstructed. However, the radar 
micro-Doppler signatures carry distinctive features of the body movements. It is

micro-Doppler signatures. 
Figure 4.34 shows examples of the radar micro-Doppler signatures of hu-
man walking, running, and crawling generated from the collected X-band radar 
data. Compared to the micro-Doppler signature of a walking person in Figure 
4.34(a), the micro-Doppler signature of a running person in Figure 4.34(b) has 
a generally higher Doppler frequency shift and a short gait cycle. The crawling 
person’s Doppler frequency shift is much lower and the amplitude of the maxi-
mum Doppler shift is also lower, as shown in Figure 4.34(c).

Figure 4.35 shows a person with arm and leg movements captured by the 
3-D human motion database [18]. For simplicity, only 15 body parts were used 
in this model. Fingers and thumb are simply modeled as hands, toes are mod-
eled as feet, the lower back, upper back, thorax, lower neck, and clavicles are 
simply modeled as the torso. The person is standing and performing nine ac-
tions using arms and legs during a 9-second observation time period. The first 
five actions are simultaneously leg and arm motions. The last four actions are 
the arms’ swimming-like motion. The micro-Doppler signature of the person’s 
movement is shown in Figure 4.35. 
The micro-Doppler signature clearly shows the nine actions. The first five 
actions show large peaks of Doppler shifts caused by the relatively large motion 
of the toes and hands. The last four actions show moderate peaks with similar 
shape caused by a swimming-like arm motion only. The forward and backward 
motions generate positive and negative Doppler shifts as shown in Figure 4.35. 
The relatively strong Doppler frequency around zero Doppler means that the 
person is standing and has no translational motion. 
4.2 Bird Wing Flapping
Bird locomotion is a typical animal locomotion and has extracted much atten-
tion for studying avian wings [26, 27]. A bird wing is shown in Figure 4.36, 
where the wing is defined by the wing span, chord, upper arm (humerus), fore-
arm (ulna and radius), and hand (wrist, hand, and fingers) if using the terms of 
Figure 4.35 The micro-Doppler signature of a person with arm and leg movements. (After: 
[12].)

 
The Micro-Doppler Effect of the Nonrigid Body Motion 
       195                 
human arms. Wing flapping is the elevation and depression of the upper arm or 
forearm around joints with certain flapping angles. Wing twisting is a rotation 
of the wing about its principal axis, which results in the elevation of the trailing 
edge and the depression of the leading edge. Sweeping is the forward protrac-
tion or backward retraction of the shoulder. Flapping, twisting, and sweeping 
consist of the basic bird locomotion. 
Wings can have vertical translation, flapping, sweeping, and twisting mo-
tions. To study bird wing locomotion, a suitable kinematic model is needed 
[28–32]. Having a kinematic model, the bird flight movement can be analyzed. 
Ramakrishnananda and Wong proposed a model of the forward flapping flight 
of birds using sophisticated bird geometry with multijointed wings and used 
defined flapping wing parameters to achieve degrees of freedom [30]. 
4.2.1 
Bird Wing Flapping Kinematics
To calculate bird locomotion, the D-H notation [15] is used to represent joint 
coordinates for a kinematic chain of revolute and translational joints. When 
analyzing articulated locomotion, harmonic oscillations are often assumed to 
describe the style of sinusoidal motion [32]. However, harmonic oscillations 
are the basis of analyzing complicated motion because any motion can be de-
composed into a summation of a series of harmonic components with different 
amplitudes and frequencies by using the Fourier series.
By defining the flapping angle ψ, the twisting angle θ, and sweeping angle 
ϕ, the rotation matrices required for coordinate transformations are

The Micro-Doppler Effect in Radar  
where Aψ and fflap are the amplitude of the flap angle and the flapping frequency, 
respectively, and Aϕ and fsweep are the amplitude of the sweep angle and the 
sweeping frequency, respectively. The angular velocities are defined by
 
 
(4.25)
and
 
 
(4.26)
Thus, the linear velocities at the wing tip are
 
 
(4.27)
and
 
 
(4.28)
where r is the half wing span.
A more complicated wing structure may have two segments in the wing. 
Segment 1 is the upper arm (i.e., the link from the shoulder joint to the elbow 
joint), and Segment 2 is the forearm (i.e., the link from the elbow to the wrist). 
For flapping, the elbow joint has only one degree of freedom. 
4.2.2 
Doppler Observations of the Bird Wing Flapping
Radar returns from flying birds carry Doppler modulation caused by flapping 
wings. The Doppler spread of bird wing flapping has been observed and re-
ported [33–36]. Vaughn [33] cited a report [34] on the investigation of bird 
classification by using an X-band Doppler radar and showed an 11-second ra-
dial velocity history profile of a snowy egret with a 0.97-m wingspan. It showed 
that the wing flapping rate estimated from the Doppler spectrogram is 4 Hz. 
From the Doppler spectrogram, the maximum radial velocity expected from an 
element of the wing can be calculated by

The Micro-Doppler Effect of the Nonrigid Body Motion 
       199                 
where A is the amplitude of the wing flapping during the down stroke, fwing is 
the wing flapping rate, and d is the distance from the bird body center to the 
tip of the arm. While the bird is taking off, the amplitude A is relatively high 
(90°–135°). For a snowy egret, the distance d is 0.48m, and the maximum ra-
dial velocity should be between 2.1 m/s and 3.7 m/s.
In 1974, Green and Balsley [35] first proposed a method for the identifi-
cation of flying birds using the time-varying Doppler spectrum (i.e., the micro-
Doppler signature). The time-varying Doppler spectrum of a Canadian goose 
shows the power of the radar returned signal from the flying goose at various 
Doppler frequencies when flying over time. The power spectrum shows that the 
Doppler shifts from the wings are more than 180 Hz higher than that from the 
body itself. The bandwidth of the time-varying Doppler spectrum varies with 
the size of the bird. Thus, the bandwidth may be used to discriminate birds.
Various types of birds, such as passerine-like flapping style or swift-like 
flapping style, have different patterns of the time-varying Doppler spectrum. The 
passerine-like flapping style shows repeated clusters of larger fluctuations [36]. 
4.2.3 
Simulation of the Bird Wing Flapping
To study the radar returns from a wing-flapping bird, a simple kinematic model 
with two jointed wing segments is assumed as illustrated in Figure 4.37. In this 
Figure 4.37 A simple kinematic model of a bird wing with two jointed wing segments.

200 
The Micro-Doppler Effect in Radar  
simulation, the user-defined parameters are the flapping frequency fflap = 1.0 
Hz, the length of upper arm L1 = 0.5m, the amplitude of the flapping angle 
of the upper arm A1 = 40°, the lag of the flapping angle in the upper arm ψ10 
= 15°, the length of forearm L2 = 0.5m, the amplitude of flapping angle in the 
forearm A2 = 30°, the lag of the flapping angle in the forearm ψ20 = 40°, and the 
amplitude of sweeping angle in the forearm C2 = 20°.
With these user-defined parameters, the flapping angle of the upper arm 
is a harmonic time-varying function given by
 
 
(4.30)
the flapping angle of the forearm is a harmonic time-varying function
 
 
(4.31)
and the twisting angle of the forearm is also a harmonic time-varying function 
 
 
(4.32)
Therefore, the elbow joint position is P1 = [x1, y1, z1], where 
 
 
(4.33)
and the wrist joint position is P2 = [x2, y2, z2], where

The Micro-Doppler Effect in Radar  
radar is located at X = 20m, Y = 0m, and Z = −10m and the bird is flying with 
a velocity 1.0 m/s. Figure 4.39 is the geometry of the radar and the flying bird. 
The radar range profiles are shown in Figure 4.40(a), and the micro-Doppler 
signature of the flying bird with flapping wings is shown in Figure 4.40(b). 
From the micro-Doppler signature, both the flapping upper arms and forearms 
with the flapping frequency 1.0 Hz can be seen. Appendix 4B lists the MAT-
LAB source codes for the flying bird simulation.
4.3 Quadrupedal Animal Motion
Quadrupedal animals use four-legged motion and, thus, have more choices on 
their feet striking the ground than humans. They could strike ground with each 
foot separately (four-beat gaits), with two feet separately and other two feet 
together (three-beat gaits), with three feet together and the other one separately 
(two-beat gaits), they could strike in pairs (two-beat gaits), or they could strike 
with all four feet together (one-beat gait). The normal four-legged animals’ 
walking sequence is four evenly spaced beats with left hind, left fore, right hind, 
and right fore and without a suspension phase. 
Muybridge found that all mammals followed the footfall sequence of the 
horse when walking on four legs. Figure 4.41 shows walking horses. For a half 
sequence of horse walking, beginning with an end of a three-legged support 
phase and the right front leg taking off the ground with the left rear leg pushing 
back, walking becomes alternately a two-legged support phase, a three-legged 
support phase, and a two-legged support phase. The other half of the walking 
sequence is exactly the same as the first half, but with the right and left legs 
reversed [3].

The Micro-Doppler Effect in Radar  
To study fast animal movements, a high-speed video recorder should be 
used for recording 3-D motion information, just like the recording of human 
movements. At least two synchronized video recorders set at an angle to each 
other are needed for capturing 3-D motion information. More video recorders 
arranged separately around the animal movement area can avoid occlusions 
between animal body parts. 
The point-light displays for human movement study were also used in 
studying animal movements [3]. It has been demonstrated that naive observers 
can identify animals through animated point-light displays [6].
4.3.1 
Modeling of Quadrupedal Locomotion
As described the hierarchical human kinematic model in Section 4.1, a hierar-
chical quadrupedal model of animal body links’ connectivity can also be used, 
where a family of parent-child spatial relationships between joints are defined. 
Figure 4.42 is a quadrupedal model of a dog, where 25 joints are selected. How-
ever, a mathematical parameterization modeling of dog or other four-legged 
animal body segments is not available, and the motion-captured database for 
quadrupedal animals has not yet been compiled. Nevertheless, if the kinematic 
parameters of a quadrupedal animal are given, with the hierarchical quadrupe-
dal model of animal body links, it is easy to reconstruct an animated quadrupe-
dal animal movement. 
From the flexing angle functions and the translations of the joint points 
described by the model, the positions of the 25 joint points can be calculated at 
Figure 4.41 Walking horses.

each frame time. These linear and angular kinematic parameters of a quadru-
pedal animal are used to simulate radar returns from the animal locomotion. 
4.3.2 
Micro-Doppler Signatures of Quadrupedal Locomotion
Quadrupedal animal motion can be easily distinguished from bipedal human 
motion by visualization. The radar micro-Doppler signatures of quadrupedal 
animals are quite different from the micro-Doppler signatures of bipedal hu-
mans because four-legged animal locomotion can have four-beat gaits, three-
beat gaits, two-beat gaits, or a one-beat gait. Therefore, the micro-Doppler 
components from four-legged motion are much more complicated than the 
micro-Doppler components of human bipedal motion. Figure 4.43 shows the 
micro-Doppler signature of a horse carrying a rider walking away from the ra-
dar [37]. From the micro-Doppler signature, the estimated horse walking radial 
speed is about 1.5 m/s, and one walking gait cycle is about 1.3 seconds.
Figure 4.44 shows the micro-Doppler signature of a trotting horse carry-
ing a rider [37]. From the micro-Doppler signature, the estimated horse radial 
speed is about 3 m/s, and one trotting cycle is about 0.8 second. The micro-
Doppler signature of a dog approaching the X-band multiple frequency con-
tinuous wave radar was also reported in [38].
4.3.3 
Summary
Compared to human bipedal motion, the four-legged animals’ quadrupedal 
motion has more choices on feet striking. Thus, motion patterns of animal 
are more complicated. Unlike the global human walking model derived from 
a large number of experimental data, there is no similar model available for 
modeling a four-legged animal walking. Most of the radar micro-Doppler sig-

natures of horses and dogs were generated from collected radar data. To further 
investigate radar scattering from animals with quadrupedal motion, a model 
of the quadrupedal locomotion is needed. This model can be either derived 
from experimental data or formulated using collected data by motion capture 
sensors. High-speed cinematographic technique is one of the best methods of 
recording an animal’s gait patterns. To completely describe the quadrupedal 
locomotion in a 3-D Cartesian coordinate system, kinematic parameters are 
needed to provide the position of any point in the animal body changes over 
time. These kinematic parameters can be used to understand locomotion char-
acteristics of the quadrupedal movement.
After defining a suitable motion model for modeling quadrupedal lo-
comotion, extracting the motion features of body component parts from the 
micro-Doppler signatures and identifying quadrupedal gaiting become feasible.

Analysis and Interpretation of Micro-
Doppler Signatures
Micro-Doppler signatures are generated by the motion of objects. Human and 
animal motion (called the biological motion) contains a rich source of informa-
tion on body movements, actions, and intentions. Human visual systems can 
easily retrieve information from biological motion and identify a body from 
its motion pattern. Why the human visual system can easily identify an object 
through its motion is not quite understood yet. How exactly the biologically 
and psychologically relevant information is encoded in the motion pattern is 
also not known. 
Human motion is a major biological motion, and therefore, numerous 
studies on human motion perception have been ongoing for a long time. Many 
experiments have demonstrated how human observers recognize human figures 
through their motion and identify types of motion patterns. Tremendous ex-
periments in human motion perception certainly help for selecting meaningful 
features from micro-Doppler signatures to identify types of motion patterns 
and recognize a person through its motion. 
Because the micro-Doppler signature is a signature of object’s motion and 
the Doppler directly relates to the motion velocity, the method of extracting 
motion kinematic features from micro-Doppler signatures becomes an impor-
tant task. If the kinematic features of an object can be extracted, the results of 
studies in human motion perception can be applied directly and micro-Dop-
pler signatures can immediately be used to reconstruct the object’s movement. 
In this chapter, the useful results on visual perception of biological motion 
and identification through visual motion patterns will be briefly introduced. 
Then, based on the knowledge of biological motion perception, the methods

The Micro-Doppler Effect in Radar  
of how to analyze and interpret micro-Doppler signatures, how to decompose 
a micro-Doppler signature into such components that are associated with body 
structural parts, and how to select features from micro-Doppler components 
will be described. 
5.1 Biological Motion Perception
The pioneering experimental work on biological motion perception by Johans-
son in 1973 and 1976 proved that visual motion perception of point-light dis-
plays (PLD) attached to a limited number of major joints in a walking person 
can help observers to immediately recognize the structure of the human body 
[1, 2]. They showed that 0.2 second of a time interval was sufficient for an ob-
server to recognize the figure of the walkers, and 0.4 second of a time interval 
was sufficient to identify the types of human motion patterns.
Following Johansson’s work, many researchers studied how the structural 
movements of a walker and the kinematic information of the movement help 
for identifying types of the movement, recognizing the person, and even iden-
tifying the gender of the person [3–8]. 
It is well known that people can recognize a friend based on familiarity 
cues, such as face, hairstyle, or even gaiting. Face recognition is the most com-
mon method for recognizing a person. However, whether and how a person can 
be recognized by his or her motion pattern is questionable. Many researchers 
have investigated this topic for many years [4, 9, 10]. Cutting and Kozlowski 
conducted the first experiment on person recognition from biological motion 
through the PLDs [4]. They recorded the gait patterns of a number of persons 
who were familiar to each other, but not familiar with their figures of PLDs. In 
this experiment, these persons repeatedly watched the PLDs from individual 
persons. This experiment showed that the PLDs not only are sufficient to in-
dicate the presence of a human structure such as Johansson’s demonstration [1, 
2], but also contain sufficient information for identifying individual person 
through motion patterns. This experiment demonstrated that, from learning 
PLDs, people can differentiate previously unknown persons by the way they 
walk. However, the experiment was still unclear whether there were specific fac-
tors or parameters that were intrinsic to the walkers used for the identification. 
Researchers have also studied, from the visual motion perception point of view, 
which parts of structural information and kinematic information were relevant 
for identifying the types of movement and the identity of a person. 
Troje et al. have made significant contributions to many research topics 
on biological motion perception and motion decomposition [7, 8, 11]. They 
showed that the perception of biological motion depends on the links between 

 
Analysis and Interpretation of Micro-Doppler Signatures 
       249                 
joints (i.e., the point-light pairs), the trajectories of the individual PLDs (called 
the local motion information), and the information on the entire figure of the 
PLDs across a larger spatiotemporal interval (called the global motion informa-
tion). It was found that recognizing biological motion is not solely based on the 
local motion information, but it is also based on the perception of the global 
figure. Figure 5.1 illustrates a running person represented by a limited number 
of point displays.
Troje et al. also proposed methods based on the principal component 
analysis (PCA) [7] and the Fourier analysis [8] to decompose human walking 
data into structural and kinematic information. The human walking pattern is 
an averaged posture represented by the local motion of the PLDs along with 
the period of gaiting. From the kinematic data, after extracting the averaged 
posture of a walking person in PLDs and then subtracting the posture from 
the kinematic data, the residual kinematic data was decomposed by the PCA 
algorithm [7]. It was found that the first four principal components are the 
major components representing the walker’s posture. It was also found that the 
observers are more dependent on the kinematic information for recognizing 
individual walkers. Troje et al. also applied the Fourier decomposition method, 
which can be used to separately manipulate various attributes (such as size, 
shape, and gaiting frequency) and to examine the differential influence of these 
parameters on the identification of individuals.
Researchers found that the visual kinematics of PLDs can carry informa-
tion on actions [2, 3, 12, 13], emotions [14–18], and even the gender of the 
walker [6–8, 19–21]. From the movements of the PLDs (such as knocking, 
Figure 5.1 A running person represented by a limited number of point displays.

The Micro-Doppler Effect in Radar  
lifting, and waving), human observers can discriminate between the neutral 
affect and the angry affect. Experiments also showed that the ability of distin-
guishing between different emotions from the PLDs was based on the informa-
tion of motion kinematics (such as velocity, acceleration, and jerk). 
Knowing biological motion perception from the PLDs, the next step is 
how to extract these necessary kinematic and structural features from micro-
Doppler signatures. The micro-Doppler signature is a characteristic of the intri-
cate frequency modulations generated from each component part of an object 
and represented in the joint time and Doppler frequency domain. Based on 
the results of human motion perception from the PLDs of body component 
parts, it can be inferred that motion kinematics of human body components 
in the micro-Doppler signatures are also carry information on human actions 
and emotions. 
However, the micro-Doppler signature of a human movement is a su-
perposition of micro-Doppler components from individual body component 
parts. Thus, it is necessary to decompose a micro-Doppler signature into com-
ponents that correspond to the motion from human body component parts. 
The decomposition of human micro-Doppler signatures therefore becomes a 
challenging problem that may lead to the identification of human actions and 
emotions through micro-Doppler signatures.
5.2 Decomposition of Biological Motion
The decomposition of biological motion is the decomposition of motion data 
into structural information components and kinematic information compo-
nents. The method is based on a transformation that can transfer the biologi-
cal motion data into a representation that allows the analysis using statistics 
and pattern recognition techniques. The transformation can be a Fourier-based 
transform or the PCA. In the Fourier-based method, the direct current (DC) 
component of the transform encodes the structural information of the moving 
body’s geometry, and the dynamic alternating current (AC) components of the 
transform encode the kinematic motion information. In the PCA method, the 
residual kinematic data, after subtracting the averaged posture, is used for the 
decomposition. The PCA is a commonly used tool in the statistic data analy-
sis [22], which calculates the eigenvalue decomposition of the data covariance 
matrix. It can reduce the dimensionality of the data and reveal the internal 
structure of the data through the data variance. For biological locomotion data, 
the PCA method actually results in a discrete Fourier decomposition, which 
is optimal in the sense of maximizing variance with a minimum number of 
components [8].

 
Analysis and Interpretation of Micro-Doppler Signatures 
       251                 
However, decomposing biological motion is not decomposing micro-
Doppler signatures. The method of how to decompose a complex micro-Dop-
pler signature into components corresponding to the motion of human body 
components is still a challenging task.
5.2.1 
Statistics-Based Decomposition
The statistically independent decomposition includes PCA or singular value 
decomposition (SVD) and independent component analysis (ICA) [22–25]. 
The PCA is a tool in statistical data analysis and uses eigenvectors with the larg-
est eigenvalues to obtain a set of function bases so that the original function can 
be represented by a linear combination of these bases. The function bases found 
by the PCA are uncorrelated (i.e., they cannot be linearly predicted from each 
other). However, higher-order dependencies still exist in the PCA and these 
bases are not optimally separated. The SVD is a generalization of the PCA and 
can decompose a nonsquared matrix, which is possible to directly decompose 
the time-frequency distribution without using a covariance matrix. 
The ICA was originally used for separating mixed signals into indepen-
dent components, called the blind source separation (BSS). The ICA minimizes 
the statistical dependence between basis feature vectors and searches for a linear 
transformation to express a set of features as a linear combination of statistically 
independent function bases. As is well known, independent events must be 
uncorrelated, but uncorrelated events may not be independent. The PCA only 
requires the components to be uncorrelated. The ICA is independent and ac-
counts for higher-order statistics. Thus, it is a more powerful feature representa-
tion than the PCA. In fact, the PCA, just like the Fourier analysis, is basically a 
global component analysis, whereas the ICA, like the time-frequency analysis, 
is basically a localized component analysis. 
Certainly, the statistically decomposed components are not these mono-
components that correspond to micro-Doppler signatures generated from indi-
vidual body parts. The desired decomposition method for micro-Doppler sig-
natures should be the one that is based on the physical structural components 
of human body parts.
5.2.2 
Decomposition of Micro-Doppler Signatures in the Joint Time-Frequency 
Domain
The micro-Doppler signature is represented in the joint time and Doppler fre-
quency domain, and is a superposition of monocomponent signatures of indi-
vidual body parts. There are many methods based on selecting basis (kernel) 
functions to decompose a time-frequency distribution into independently con-
trollable components that are used to reconstruct the original time-frequency 

252 
The Micro-Doppler Effect in Radar  
distribution. However, these kernel functions are elementary basis functions 
localized in the joint time and frequency domain, but are not associated with 
monocomponent signatures of individual body parts. 
Another type of decomposition is the statistically independent decompo-
sition using PCA or SVD and ICA. These decomposed components are uncor-
related or independent, but not necessarily associated with monocomponent 
micro-Doppler signatures of individual body parts because these monocompo-
nent signatures are often correlated or dependent due to synchronized locomo-
tion of the human body parts. 
The EMD introduced in Chapter 1 is a signal decomposition method that 
decomposes an original signal into component waveforms, called the intrinsic 
mode functions (IMF), that are modulated in their amplitude and frequency 
by searching all of the oscillatory modes in the signal [26]. One property of the 
IMFs is that different IMFs do not have the same instantaneous frequency at 
the same time instant. The EMD has been applied to micro-Doppler signatures 
for extracting radar signal components generated by rotating or vibrating body 
structures [27]. Although the EMD can extract informative harmonic compo-
nents from human motion data, there is no connection to structures of human 
body parts. Therefore, the most useful but difficult decomposition method for 
micro-Doppler signatures should be the one that is based on the physical struc-
tural components of human body parts.
5.2.3 
Physical Component–Based Decomposition
Although the micro-Doppler signature of a human motion is not a visual per-
ception of the motion, it is directly related to the kinematic information about 
the moving structures of the human body. Human observers can easily track 
the component signatures from the micro-Doppler signature. The question is 
what algorithm can be used to track these component signatures. In general, it 
is not simple to track and isolate any individual component in the entire micro-
Doppler signature. An effective algorithm of the physical component–based 
decomposition is still an open issue.
In [28, 29], a framework was proposed for decomposing a micro-Doppler 
signature into components that are associated with the physical parts of a hu-
man body. A micro-Doppler signature of a walking person and the decomposed 
signatures, called motion curves, that correspond to the different physical parts 
of the human body are shown in Figure 5.2. The decomposition algorithm used 
is described in the follows. First, the class of the motion must be predetermined 
from the given micro-Doppler signature by examining the structure of varia-
tions of the upper and lower envelopes in the micro-Doppler signature being 
analyzed. This was accomplished by means of a Markov chain–based inference 
algorithm [28]. The advantage of focusing on the upper and lower envelopes

motion curves from the micro-Doppler signature in (a); and (d) the model of the walking person.

254 
The Micro-Doppler Effect in Radar  
is that their micro-Doppler structure remains relatively invariant to the distor-
tions inherent in the acquisition process. Inferring the motion class yields valu-
able prior knowledge about the internal time-frequency structure of the signal 
to be analyzed; such knowledge is obtained by prior simulation studies in [30]. 
Conditioned on this knowledge, the motion class of the remaining body parts 
is determined by the following process.
The micro-Doppler signature being analyzed is segmented into consecu-
tive different half-cycles such that each half-cycle corresponds to roughly half 
the period of motion, as shown in Figure 5.2(b). This segmentation is accom-
plished by means of a nonlinear optimization program that is solved via dynam-
ic programming. Thus, the motion curves extracted for each half-cycle can then 
be concatenated to form the overall motion sequence of the human. In order 
to extract the motion curves for each half-cycle, the significant local maxima 
correspond to the maximal time cell of the half-cycle. The maximal time cell is 
at the time coordinate where the upper/lower envelope attains global maxima. 
These significant local maxima are determined by means of the same nonlinear 
optimization algorithm described in [28]. Given this, the local corresponding 
maxima at the remaining time cells are determined by means of a partial track-
ing algorithm described in [28, 29]. The concatenation of the corresponding 
local maxima at different time cells yields the motion curves for each of the 
body parts. The number of local maxima to be computed (i.e., the number of 
body parts for determining the motion curves) is known by prior knowledge 
obtained by simulation studies and associated with the inferred motion class. 
Then the initial set of motion curve estimates obtained are refined by means 
of a Gaussian g-Snakes–based quality measure as described in [28, 29], where 
Gaussian g-Snakes is a model of the micro-Doppler structure of the human 
gait motion that enables a blind assessment of the quality of the motion curves 
estimates in Figure 5.2(c) [28, 29]. 
Figure 5.3(a) shows the micro-Doppler signature of a running person. 
Figure 5.3(b) shows the corresponding decomposed motion curves extracted 
for this running motion.
This proposed framework was applied to the decomposition of micro-
Doppler signatures of human walking and running, and demonstrated motion 
curves extracted from several human body parts. However, a more generalized 
algorithm that decomposes a more general micro-Doppler signature into mo-
tion curves of physical body parts is expected for future work. To achieve this 
goal, it is necessary to understand in quantitative detail the nonlinear interac-
tions between the various motion curves that comprise the motion, together 
with the need to understand, at a more basic level, the dynamics of the human 
gait motion including the efficient representation of complex motion dynamics 
and their effect on the micro-Doppler signature.

5.3 Extraction of Features from Micro-Doppler Signatures
Because the most often performed human motion is walking, extracting motion 
features from micro-Doppler signatures of a walking human is a basic method 
for extracting motion features from micro-Doppler signatures.
In this section, the global human walking model [30] is used to create a 
human walking model and generate the micro-Doppler signature of a walking 
human. Because of the given human walking model, each human body part 
can be isolated from other parts and the micro-Doppler component of each 
body part can be generated and extracted. Thus, structural information and 
kinematic information of each human body part may be extracted.
Using the global human walking model in [30], a radar with a wavelength 
of 0.02m is assumed at (X1 = 10m, Y1 = 0m, Z1 = 2m), a walking human is 
started from the human base point located at (X0 = 0m, Y0 = 0m, Z0 = 0m), the 
relative velocity of the walking person is VR = 1.0 m/s, and the height of the 
person is assumed to be H = 1.8m, as illustrated in Figure 5.4. 
As mentioned in Chapter 4, because the global human walking model is 
based on averaging parameters from experimental measurements, it is just an 
averaging human walking model without information about personalized mo-
tion features.
Figure 5.5 shows the micro-Doppler signature of the walking person. The 
micro-Doppler components of the feet, tibias, clavicles, and torso are marked in 
Figure 5.4 Geometry of a walking person and the radar at (X1 = 10m, Y1 = 0m, Z1 = 2m).

Figure 5.5. The average of the torso Doppler frequency shift is about 133 Hz. 
Figure 5.6 shows the corresponding micro-Doppler components of the feet, 
tibias, radius, and torso, respectively. 
Running is the next most characteristic movement of humans. Using the 
human running model derived from the captured human movement database 
[31], assume that the radar is located at (X1 = 10m, Y1 = 0m, Z1 = 2m) with a 
wavelength of 0.02m and that the starting point of the running person is from 
(X0 = 0m, Y0 = 0m, Z0 = 0m). Figure 5.6 shows the micro-Doppler signature 
of the running person. The micro-Doppler components of the right foot, right 
tibia, and torso are marked in Figure 5.7. The average of the Doppler frequency 
shift of the torso is about 350 Hz. 
Figure 5.8 shows the corresponding micro-Doppler components of the 
feet, tibias, and torso. Figures 5.8(b–d) are extracted micro-Doppler compo-
nents of the feet, tibias, and torso, respectively, from the micro-Doppler signa-
ture of a running person [Figure 5.8(a)]. 
5.4 Estimation of Kinematic Parameters from Micro-Doppler 
Signatures
The micro-Doppler signature of human movement shows strong reflections 
from human torso due to its larger RCS. From the micro-Doppler component 
of the torso, the average torso velocity, the cycle of torso oscillation, and the 
amplitude of the torso Doppler oscillation can be measured. From the simula-
tion result using the global human walking model, for a Ku-band radar operat-
ing at 15 GHz, the torso motion velocity is oscillating from 1.0 m/s and going

up to 1.67 m/s, as shown in Figure 5.9. The mean value of the torso velocity is 
vtorso = fDλ/2 = 133 × 0.02/2 = 1.33 m/s. The oscillating period of the torso is 
0.5 second, or the cycle of the torso oscillation is 2 Hz. 
The corresponding lower leg (tibia) motion parameters are shown in Fig-
ure 5.10. The average tibia velocity is vtibia = 129 × 0.02/2 = 1.29 m/s, the cycle 
of the tibia oscillation is 1 Hz, and the maximum amplitude of the tibia oscil-
lation velocity is about 3.2 m/s. 
The corresponding foot motion parameters are shown in Figure 5.11. The 
average foot velocity is vfoot = 127 × 0.02/2 = 1.27 m/s, the cycle of the foot 
oscillation is 1 Hz, and the maximum amplitude of the foot oscillation velocity 
is about 5.9 m/s. Half the foot oscillation cycle is the foot forward motion, and 
the other half of the cycle is the foot in contact with the ground, which makes 
the average velocity lower. The foot motion has the highest velocity, which 
is approximately four to five times the average foot velocity. The oscillation 
frequency of the torso is two times the tibia or the foot oscillation frequency 
because the torso accelerates while either foot swings.

From the simulation of a running person in the captured human move-
ment database, when the radar operates at 15 GHz, the torso motion velocity 
is oscillating from 3.0 m/s and going up to 3.39 m/s, as shown in Figure 5.12. 
The mean value of the torso velocity is vtorso = fDλ /2 = 320 × 0.02/2 = 3.20 m/s. 
The oscillating period of the torso is 0.43 to 0.50 second, or the cycle of the 
torso oscillation is 2.0–2.3 Hz. 
The corresponding lower leg (tibia) motion parameters are shown in Fig-
ure 5.13. The average tibia velocity is vtibia = 380 × 0.02/2 = 3.80 m/s, the cycle 
of the tibia oscillation is 1.2 Hz, and the maximum amplitude of the tibia oscil-
lation velocity is about 5.85 m/s. 
The corresponding foot motion parameters are shown in Figure 5.14. The 
average foot velocity is vfoot = 415 × 0.02/2 = 4.15 m/s, the cycle of the foot 
oscillation is about 1.2 Hz, and the maximum amplitude of the foot oscillation 
velocity is about 7.66 m/s. The foot motion has the highest velocity.

5.5 Identifying Human Movements
The purpose of the human movement identification is to identify the type or 
model of the movement, such as walking, running, or jumping, after classifying 
the movements as being made by humans, animals, or vehicles. Existing ap-
proaches to identify human movements in computer vision may be divided into 
two different types: the exploitation of structural information, and the use of 
motion information [33, 34]. These motion-based algorithms use human body 
part moments, eigenvectors, and hidden Markov models (HMMs) [35, 36]. 
Although these motion-based algorithms have been successful in many scenar-
ios, because of the lack of structural information, in some other scenarios they 
could be worse than the methods that mainly use structural information [37].
A human motion pattern is a characteristic of an observation from human 
movements. Different types of movements generate different types of motion 
patterns. The micro-Doppler signature can be seen as a type of motion pattern. 
From a motion pattern, the extracted structural characteristic is a feature of the 
movement. It can be a distinctive measurement, a transformation, or a struc-
Figure 5.10 The tibia velocity of a walking person.

 
Analysis and Interpretation of Micro-Doppler Signatures 
       263                 
tural component. The features extracted from a motion pattern are the key to 
the identification of a human movement.
5.5.1 
Features Used for Identifying Human Movements
It has been demonstrated that human movement could be identified through 
the point-light displays [1]. The experiment showed that by placing point lights 
on the joints of human body segments and filming human movements in a dark 
room, the point-light displays of the human movement can still provide a vivid 
impression of human movements. This means that the hierarchical structure of 
body segments and motion constraints of the segments and joints are charac-
teristic features of human movements. These characteristic features are the key 
features for the identification of human movements. 
To identify a complete human movement, the first task is to determine 
the class of the human movement, such as walking, running, jumping, or crawl-
ing; the second task is to identify the phase of the motion, such as stance phase 
or swing phase when walking; and the third task is to predict possible motion 
continuation. With available decomposed human motion components, such as 
Figure 5.11 The foot velocity of a walking person.

264 
The Micro-Doppler Effect in Radar  
components that correspond to the motion of individual human body parts, it 
is possible to completely identify the human movement and the motion phase 
and to even predict the possible intention. 
5.5.2 
Anomalous Human Behavior
Anomaly detection technology is to identify abnormalities and learn what nor-
mal behavior looks like by defining aberrant behavior and unusual occurrences. 
Knowing how normal behavior functions and what it usually looks like is key 
to detecting possible threats. As the number of threats grows and diversifies, an 
anomaly detection system becomes a required element of system security. 
Detection of anomalous behavior is a difficult problem. Although visual 
observation of human actions has opened a window to understanding human 
mental activities, it is still difficult to understand how human movement is 
decoded into intentions, what properties of human movement make it special, 
and how these properties are organized to make cognitive representations.
Anomaly detection is an alarm for strange behavior. An activity profile 
of normal behavior over an interval of time is necessary for the anomaly detec-
tion. This activity profile is used to compare with current events. Anything that

Analysis and Interpretation of Micro-Doppler Signatures 
       265                 
deviates from normal behavior is classified as anomalous. The methods of how 
to interpret human movements, track these movements, select appropriate fea-
tures, and detect events of interest are still open issues.
A human activity is accomplished by a sequence of a  complicated motion 
of human body parts. Any complicated motion can be described by a rotation 
about an axis through the center of mass and a translation of the center of mass. 
Thus, the kinematic information of a body part is the sum of kinematics of 
rotation and the translation of the body part. This kinematic information is 
the discriminative features that may have higher discriminatory power for rec-
ognizing human activities. The kinematic information may be obtained from 
decomposed micro-Doppler signatures of human body components. 
To detect human anomalous behavior, it is necessary to model human be-
havior. An anomalous behavior may be detected if the human behavior pattern 
deviates from the typical learned prototypes. HMM is popular in computer 
vision as an activity recognition algorithm. HMMs have been successfully used 
to recognize hand gestures in sign language and facial expressions and to clas-
sify activities in visual surveillance systems. An approach to automated visual 
surveillance is to classify the normal activities using a set of discrete HMMs,

266 
The Micro-Doppler Effect in Radar  
each trained to recognize one activity, and label the unrecognized activities as 
unusual.
The Markov model is a probabilistic technique for learning and match-
ing activity patterns. Each type of activity for people or vehicle events may be 
characterized by a family of event trajectories passing through the image. Each 
family can be represented as an HMM in which states represent regions in the 
image, the prior probabilities measure the likelihood of an event starting in a 
particular region, and the transitional probabilities capture the likelihood of 
progression from one state to another across the image. 
5.5.3 
Summary
In this chapter, based on biological motion perception, the methods of de-
composing micro-Doppler signatures into component signatures of body struc-
tural parts have been discussed. The physical component–based decomposi-
tion method opened a window for seeing the feasibility of extracting kinematic 
features from the micro-Doppler signatures. More effective algorithms for the 
signature decomposition are needed.

       267                 
Using motion kinematic features to predict possible human actions and 
using them to identify anomalous human behaviors are still difficult tasks in 
computer vision. However, if kinematic parameters of each human body part 
can be extracted from the micro-Doppler signatures, just like those animated 
human models in computer graphics using sensor motion captured data, ani-
mated human body parts may be generated from the captured micro-Doppler 
signatures. From here, it is possible to identify human actions and even anoma-
lous behaviors from micro-Doppler signatures.

Summary, Challenges, and Perspectives
Micro-Doppler effect was originally introduced in coherent LADAR systems. 
Because the micro-Doppler effect is sensitive to the transmitted frequency band 
of the system, for radar systems operating at microwave frequency bands, the 
micro-Doppler effect is not as strong as in the LADAR systems, but it is still 
observable in many cases. 
The micro-Doppler signature of an object is the characteristics of the in-
tricate frequency modulations made by the structural components of the object 
and it is represented in the joint time and Doppler frequency domain. An ob-
ject or a structure on the object may have oscillatory motion, such as an oscil-
lating pendulum, the rotating rotor blades of a helicopter, a spinning top, wind 
turbines, a walking person with swinging arms and legs, flying birds with flap-
ping wings, and quadrupedal animal motion as studied in Chapters 3 and 4. 
The primary purpose of this book is to introduce the principle of the 
micro-Doppler effect in radar and provide a simple and easy tool for generat-
ing micro-Doppler signatures of received radar signals from targets of interest. 
The simulation of radar returns from a target with movements is an important 
method for studying micro-Doppler effect in radar. Instead of using collected 
real radar data, this book is an introduction to the simulation of the micro-
Doppler effect in radar. Based on examples provided in this book, readers may 
modify and extend these examples to applications of their interest.
6.1 Summary
In the simulation of the micro-Doppler effect in radar, a suitable target model 
and a more accurate model of the target’s motion description are necessary. Ex-
amples given in Chapters 3 and 4 provided commonly used models for targets, 

272 
The Micro-Doppler Effect in Radar  
methods for modeling the target’s motion equation, and simple RCS modeling 
for the simulation of radar returns. Micro-Doppler signatures of some typical 
rigid body and nonrigid body motions were introduced in Chapters 3 and 4. 
To generate the micro-Doppler signature of a target, the first thing is to select a 
model suitable for describing the target and a motion model for describing the 
nonlinear motion of the target. Several examples of modeling different types of 
rigid body and nonrigid body motions were given and corresponding MAT-
LAB source codes were provided. Then, to simulate radar returned signals from 
targets, suitable RCS prediction models are needed. The simple point-scatterer 
model and a more accurate physical optics model were used in these examples. 
The POFacet is a simple RCS prediction software package using MATLAB 
code; it is based on the PO model [1, 2]. It can be downloaded and used for 
the calculation of monostatic and bistatic RCS of a static object and it is not 
included the source codes provided in this book. 
Many researchers have studied the micro-Doppler effect in radar and ap-
plied micro-Doppler signatures for target feature extraction and identification. 
However, not many of them tried to extract target features that are associated 
with the motion of individual parts of the target of interest. Any action of a 
target always comes from the movement of the target’s body parts. Thus, the 
extraction of target movement features that closely associate with the motions 
of structural parts of the target is extremely useful. 
In Chapter 5, some useful results from biological motion perception re-
search were introduced, which may help radar engineers to consider how to use 
these results in radar micro-Doppler signature analysis and in the identification 
of targets of interest from their micro-Doppler signatures. Similar to human 
motion perception through the PLDs, the kinematic information about targets 
motion is also encoded in the components of micro-Doppler signatures. This 
information should be appropriately extracted from the signatures in order to 
detect and identify targets of interest.
6.2 Challenges
Micro-Doppler signature analysis has been applied with certain success to ex-
tracting target kinematic features and identifying targets of interest. However, 
how to effectively interpret these extracted features and associate them with 
structural parts of a target of interest is challenging. The success of solving the 
meaningful features of a target’s structural parts may lead to improving the 
performance of the identification and to further identify the intention and be-
havior of a biological motion.

 
Summary, Challenges, and Perspectives 
273
6.2.1 
Decomposing Micro-Doppler Signatures
The micro-Doppler signature is directly related to the kinematic information 
of the structural parts of a target and is the superposition of monocomponent 
signatures associated with individual structural parts of a target and represented 
in the joint time-frequency domain. 
Several time-frequency decomposition methods are available. Some de-
composition methods, such as matching pursuit method and adaptive Gabor 
method [3, 4], can only decompose a time-frequency distribution into inde-
pendently controllable localized components that can reconstruct the original 
time-frequency distribution. However, these decomposition methods do not 
consider the physical phenomenon that created the monocomponent signa-
tures in the joint time-frequency representation. Thus, they are not the kind of 
decompositions that can associate with monocomponent signatures of individ-
ual structural parts of a physical target. As discussed in Section 5.2.1, although 
the EMD can decompose micro-Doppler signatures into monocomponents, 
they have no connection to target body parts. The most useful decomposition 
is the one that is based on the physical components of a target.
The challenge is to find an effective automatic method that tracks mono-
component signatures in micro-Doppler signatures and thus decomposes into 
those monocomponents associated with the physical structural parts of a target 
of interest. Human observers can easily track monocomponent signatures from 
the superposed micro-Doppler signature. How to effectively decompose micro-
Doppler signatures into monocomponents that relate to the physical structural 
parts of a target and how to measure the embedded kinematic/structural infor-
mation from monocomponent signatures are still open issues. 
6.2.2 
Feature Extraction and Target Identification Based on Micro-Doppler 
Signatures
The possible features and kinematic parameters that can be extracted from 
micro-Doppler signatures are the time information, the frequency or period 
of micro motion, the magnitude and the sign of Doppler frequency shifts, the 
position and moving direction, the linear velocity and acceleration, and the 
angular velocity and acceleration.
Because the micro-Doppler signature is generated from the motion of 
a target, and in the monostatic radar case, the measured Doppler frequency 
is directly related to the radial (LOS) velocity of a target, or in the bistatic ra-
dar case, the measured Doppler frequency is related to the component of the 
velocity projected onto the line of bisector. Therefore, to accurately locate the 
position and measure the true moving direction and the velocity of the target, 
at least two monostatic radars or one monostatic radar and one bistatic radar 
are needed.

The Micro-Doppler Effect in Radar  
Figure 6.1 depicts how to measure the true velocity of a moving target 
using two radars. In a two-dimensional case, the moving target is located at 
(X0, Y0), and the two radars are located at (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2), respectively. 
The cross-point of line 1 and line 2 determines the true velocity of the moving 
target, where line 1 is the line that is perpendicular to the radial velocity VR1 
and line 2 is the line that is perpendicular to the radial velocity VR2. If the initial 
position of a physical part of a target can be measured and the micro-Doppler 
signature of the target can be decomposed into monocomponents associated 
with physical parts of the target, then the basic kinematic parameters (positions 
and true velocities) of each physical part of the target can be estimated by two 
monostatic radars.
To completely describe a target motion in a 3-D Cartesian coordinate 
system, linear kinematic parameters (linear position, linear velocity, and linear 
acceleration) are the most important motion kinematic parameters, which de-
fine the manner in which the position of any point in the human body changes 
over time. Linear velocity describes the rate of the position change with respect 
to time, and linear acceleration describes the rate of velocity change with time. 
These three kinematic parameters will be used to determine the characteristics 
of a target movement. Other three kinematic parameters are the angular kine-
matics, which include the angular position (orientation) of a target body part, 
angular velocity, and angular acceleration of the body part. Because a target 
may consist of a number of parts, the measurement of joint angles between two 
parts are useful for describing target movement. These three angular kinematic

ties VR1 and VR2.

parameters will be used jointly with three linear kinematic parameters to com-
pletely describe the motion of the parts of the target. By carefully handling 
rotation and translation, the 3-D trajectories of these joint points between body 
parts can be obtained. These linear and angular kinematic parameters of the 
target movement can be used for classification, recognition, and identification 
of targets of interest. 
6.3 Perspectives
Chapter 2 introduced the theoretical basis of micro-Doppler effect in radar. 
Micro-Doppler signatures have been investigated in a certain level for the ex-
traction of target features and classification of targets of interest. Since the his-
tory of the research on micro-Doppler effect in radar is relatively short, many 
aspects of research topics are still opened and need to be exploited. These top-
ics include bistatic and multistatic micro-Doppler analysis, target classification 
with micro-Doppler features, through-the-wall micro-Doppler analysis, and 
polarimetric micro-Doppler analysis. 
6.3.1 
Multistatic Micro-Doppler Analysis
Multistatic radar has multiple transmitter/receiver nodes over distributed loca-
tions [5]. Each node in the multistatic system can have only one transmitter 
or receiver. Multistatic radar is considered a combination of multiple bistatic 
radars that observes targets from different aspects. Thus, the informative data 
acquired from targets is increased because of the multiple aspects viewing. Mul-
tistatic radar overcomes the target’s self-occlusion and the LOS dependency 
in monostatic radars. Thus, it is able to observe more complete Doppler and 
micro-Doppler frequency shifts. Multistatic radar fuses the received data in the 
receivers, and the performance of the fusion depends on the degree of spatial 
coherency between channels, the topology of the system, the number of targets 
and their spatial locations, and the complexity of the targets. 
Multistatic micro-Doppler signature depends on the topology of the sys-
tem and the location and motion of the target. The information encoded in 
the micro-Doppler signature may not be linearly increased with the number 
of channels used in the system because of the possible correlations between 
channels. Reference [6] analyzed the data collected in multistatic field trials on 
human and vehicles. If the cross-correlation between channels is 1 with no time 
delay, this indicates that the received signals in the two channels are the same 
and, thus, the second channel contains no additional information. If the two 
channels are not correlated, the second channel contains different information 
and is an informative channel. The value of Doppler shifts detected in each 
channel depends on the topology of the system, the target location, and its

moving direction. By fusing information captured from multiple channels, the 
location, moving direction, and velocity of the target can be measured. With 
the increased information, the radar performance on target recognition is ex-
pected to be improved.
6.3.2 
Micro-Doppler Signature-Based Classification
Automatic classification based on micro-Doppler signatures is still challenging. 
Stove and Sykes reported an operational radar system that uses Doppler spec-
trum for target classification [7, 8]. Humans, vehicles, helicopters, and ships 
were successfully classified with multiple Fisher linear discriminators on their 
Doppler spectra. The target classification based on Doppler spectrum in this 
operational radar system indicated the possibility of using micro-Doppler sig-
natures for target classification. Micro-Doppler signature–based methods for 
target classification have been investigated [6, 9, 10]. Smith discussed micro-
Doppler signature–based classification using an experimental multistatic system 
[6]. Anderson described the classification using the support vector machine and 
the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) classifiers from micro-Doppler data [9]. 
Bilik et al. also reported a GMM-based classifier using features of spectral peri-
odicity extracted by the cepstrum coefficients of micro-Doppler data [10]. For 
classifying human activities, because different movements have various micro-
Doppler signatures, by exploiting these differences, a human activity classifier 
can be developed. Features used in the human activity classifier may include the 
torso signature curve, the maximal Doppler shift of the signature, the offset of 
the signature, the maximum Doppler variation of the torso curve, the oscilla-
tion frequency or period of the human locomotion, the kinematic parameters of 
limbs, and other available features. However, despite the successful tracking and 
interpretation of human movements reported in computer vision literature, the 
selection of suitable descriptive features for prediction of human actions and in-
tention is still a challenge. Most classifiers are not based on the micro-Doppler 
features that are associated with human body parts and limbs. According to a 
biological motion perception study, if a kinematic information-based classifier 
is used based on the features of human body parts and limbs extracted from 
micro-Doppler signatures, this will lead to a more impressive performance for 
identifying human actions, emotions, and even gender information. 
6.3.3 
Aural Methods for Micro-Doppler–Based Discrimination
An audio sound of a micro-Doppler embedded signal, called an aural signal, 
may help a human listener to distinguish between different movements of a 
target of interest (human walking, running, or jumping) or distinguish between 
different targets (human and animal). 

 
Summary, Challenges, and Perspectives 
277
The function of the human auditory classification is based on speech pho-
nemics. A phoneme is a specific sound pattern that can be recognizable by hu-
man brains. It is reasonable to generalize this ability of human auditory system 
for listening to micro-Doppler signals of different movements and to classify 
target movements using movement phonemes. The human brain neural struc-
tures and learned behaviors used on a daily basis are ready to perform micro-
Doppler signal processing aurally. 
One advantage of the auditory classification systems is that the human 
auditory classification process is particularly robust in the presence of noise. 
Thus, the human auditory system could be an effective alternative in a signal 
classification system based on movement phonemes. However, the aural micro-
Doppler signal is not a conventional speech signal. The human auditory clas-
sification system has been optimized for speech signals, but not optimized for 
aural micro-Doppler signals. 
Aural signal classification already used in sonar signal classification [11, 
12]. The potential application of the aural classification to micro-Doppler sig-
natures is also possible to classify a target’s different movements by directly 
converting the baseband micro-Doppler signal into an audio signal for training 
listeners [13]. However, aural classifiers may not easily classify human actions, 
emotions, and intentions. They can only serve as a supplementary classifier. 
6.3.4 
Through-the-Wall Micro-Doppler Signatures
The ability of radar to detect human beings and their movements offers 
through-the-wall radar applications, including locating living humans after 
an earthquake or in explosion scenarios, monitoring human activities behind 
walls, and many other uses. Like micro-Doppler signatures of target captures in 
an open, free space, micro-Doppler signatures of targets behind walls can also 
be used to detect and identify the targets behind walls [14]. The effect of targets 
behind a wall undergoing a micro motion has been studied, and the impact of 
the wall on the micro-Doppler effect has been formulated [15]. It was found 
that the micro-Doppler effect in the presence of a wall has a similar form as 
that in free space. However, the measured aspect angle of a target behind a wall 
is different to that observed in free space. The measured angle depends on the 
thickness and dielectric constant of the wall. The change of the instantaneous 
aspect angle due to the wall will affect the radar imaging of the target. However, 
the presence of a wall does not change the pattern of the micro-Doppler signa-
ture of the target; the wall only changes the absolute value of the micro-Doppler 
signature, depending on the wall properties. Therefore, radar micro-Doppler 
signatures can be used to detect the presence of human beings and their move-
ments behind the wall.

278 
The Micro-Doppler Effect in Radar  
Radar returns modulated by biometrical signals may be used for detecting 
living objects. Specific modulations in reflected radar signals from a human in-
clude heartbeats, thorax motion by breathing, and even vibration in the larynx. 
The heartbeat is a periodic process in the frequency range from 0.8 to 2.5 Hz. 
The breathing process is in a lower frequency range from 0.2 to 0.5 Hz for slow 
breathing [16–19].
Because the micro-Doppler frequency shift is sensitive to the radar operat-
ing frequency, for a relatively lower frequency used in through-the-wall radars, 
the micro-Doppler shifts can be very low. Even so, radar signals returned from 
a human behind a wall can sense human body motion, heartbeat, and even 
breathing to detect individuals and monitor human movements. Radar detec-
tion of human objects is usually performed in a complex background clutter. 
The intensity of the radar signal reflected from the clutter may exceed the in-
tensity of the radar signal components returned from a human object. To reject 
the radar signal components reflected from the clutter, the different time and 
Doppler frequency characteristics between the radar returns from the human 
object and that from the clutter must be utilized. By applying a suitable range 
gating and a notched frequency filtering, the signal components reflected by the 
human object may be largely enhanced.
Other perspectives of micro-Doppler research also include the simulation 
of micro-Doppler signatures of quadrupedal animals and polarimetric micro-
Doppler signatures.
