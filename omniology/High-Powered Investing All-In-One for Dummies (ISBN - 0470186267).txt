Introduction
M
any investors are perfectly satisfied with the more traditional invest-
ing opportunities: They build solid portfolios containing individual
stocks and bonds, mutual and exchange-traded funds, and so forth, and are
generally content to let investment counselors manage their accounts. Other
investors, however, prefer to take a more active role: Perhaps they want to
manage their accounts themselves or broaden their investment horizons
(and increase their potential returns) by delving into more volatile markets.
As an investor, you can be as aggressive as your personality and bank
account allow. To be successful, however, you need more than the right atti-
tude or a boatload of cash. You need information, and that’s what we’ve tried
to give you in this book. High-Powered Investing All-in-One For Dummies is a
book written specifically for experienced investors who want to pursue and
manage more aggressive investment vehicles.
About This Book
The key to successfully expanding your investment opportunities is, of course,
information. This book introduces you to high-powered investing techniques
and options you can pursue as you expand your portfolio — all in plain English.
Whether you’re just beginning to explore more advanced investing or have
been dabbling in it for a while but need strategies to increase your success,
this book can give you the information you want. For example, you can find
 What your high-powered investing or trading options are: There are a
whole series of investment opportunities beyond the traditional stocks
and bonds. You can trade commodities, foreign currencies, and futures
and options, all of which require a more hands-on approach. If you’re
well-heeled, you may decide that hedge funds — private investment
partnerships — are the way to go. You can find information on all these
vehicles in the books that follow.
 Keys to being a successful trader: There’s a big difference between invest-
ing and trading. With the former, you buy and hold with the expectation
your returns will increase over time as the value of the security goes up.
With the latter, your success depends on how accurately you’re able to
read the market and how quickly you can react to fluctuations. Nearly all
the higher-end investment options covered in this book — currencies,
commodities, futures and options — rely to a greater or lesser extent on
these trading skills.

 How to value a business or spot pricing trends: One key to being a 
successful investor is knowing how to get the information you need to
make good — and timely — decisions. When the value of the underlying
security is important, you need to know how to evaluate it. When being
able to recognize market trends is the key to success, you have to know
how to forecast them.
High-Powered Investing All-in-One For Dummies gives you the information and
answers you need to incorporate these investing strategies and options into
your own personal investing style. And even if you don’t adopt most of the
principles and techniques described in this book, your awareness of them
will make you a better investor.
Conventions Used in This Book
To help you navigate the text as easily as possible, this book uses the follow-
ing conventions:
 Whenever a new term is introduced, such as, say, callability or discount
rate, it appears in italics. Rest assured that a definition or explanation is
right around the corner.
 All Web addresses appear in monofont so they’re easy to pick out if you
need to go back and find them.
What You’re Not to Read
Unless you’re going to become a professional trader (rather than simply an
empowered personal investor), you probably don’t need to know everything
in this book. To help, we’ve made it easy for you to identify what is and isn’t
vital information:
 Technical Stuff icon: Some people love the details: the esoteric ratios
and percentages or the background info that only an economics profes-
sor would appreciate. We’ve included such information precisely for
those who get off on this stuff. For those of you who prefer the straight
scoop, we highlight this information with a Technical Stuff icon.
 Sidebars: If a dizzingly technical explanation goes on for more than a
paragraph (and don’t they usually?), we’ve put it in a shaded box. These
boxes also contain non-technical information that’s related to the topic
at hand but not vital to your understanding.

Foolish Assumptions
Aggressive or high-end investing options aren’t an ideal fit (or a good option)
for everyone, and High-Powered Investing All-in-One For Dummies was written
with a particular reader in mind. Here’s what we assume about you:
 You’re fairly familiar with basic investments and have some experience
in the world of investing. You know what the markets are, for example,
and have already bought and sold some securities.

How This Book Is Organized
Like all For Dummies books, High-Powered Investing All-in-One For Dummies is
a reference, and as such, each topic is relegated to its own book. Within that
book are individual chapters relating specifically to that topic.
Book I: Investment Basics
As an investor, you need to know certain things — about investment vehicles,
about risk, about exchanges and indexes, and so forth — that pertain to
investing in general. The topics in this part comprise this knowledge. All are
applicable, to a greater or lesser extent, to the advanced investing topics cov-
ered elsewhere in the book. If you’re already an experienced investor, you
can consider this part primarily review of information you no doubt already
know. If you’re relatively new to investing or are just thinking about expand-
ing your portfolio, this is a good place to begin.

Introduction

Book II: Basic Investments: Stocks, 
Bonds, Mutual Funds, and More
Most investors are familiar with the vehicles in this part. Considered tradi-
tional investments because they rely on investing principles rather than
speculation strategies, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and the relatively new
exchange-traded funds are vehicles that beginners and casual investors can
participate in with minimum involvement. That doesn’t mean, however, that
they don’t play an integral role in advanced portfolios. The chapters in this
book give you the details.
Book III: Futures and Options
Futures and options markets are resurging and are likely to be hot for several
decades, given the political landscape. Changing world demographics and
the emergence of China and India as economic powers and consumers, cou-
pled with changing politics in the Middle East, are likely to fuel the continued
prominence of these markets. As a futures and options trader, you have to be
a stock trader, a geopolitical analyst, a money manager, and an expert in the
relevant markets. Book III gets you started on that path.
Book IV: Commodities
Commodities, as an asset class, are going through a transformational period,
moving from the fringes to the mainstream. Why? Good performance. This
book offers you a comprehensive guide to the commodities markets and
shows you a number of investment strategies to help you profit. In addition,
because commodities markets are global, so are the investment opportuni-
ties. This book also helps you uncover these global opportunities.
Book V: Foreign Currency Trading
If you’re an active trader looking for alternatives to trading stocks or futures,
the forex market is hard to beat. Online trading innovations over the past
decade have made it accessible, both technologically and financially. But as
an individual trader, gaining access to the forex market is only the beginning.
You need to know how the market works and how to use a few key tactics
and strategies. This book gives you the no-nonsense information you need,
with the perspective, experience, and insight of forex market veterans.

Book VI: Hedge Funds
Hedge funds, private investment partnerships, are the crème-de-la-crème 
of high-end investing. They’re so high-end, in fact, that only the wealthiest
investors need (or can) participate. This book offers straightforward explana-
tions of how hedge funds are structured, the different investment styles that
hedge fund managers use, how you can check out a fund before you invest,
and what to expect after you’ve joined a fund.
Book VII: Value Investing
Value investing is a strategy that focuses on determining a company’s real
worth in order to identify companies that are undervalued and, hence, under-
priced. Why? Because the greatest potential for significant returns involves
buying for relatively little an asset that is worth much more. To be a value
investor, you need to know what data to focus on to get a true picture of a
business’s worth and how to apply that knowledge in making sound investing
decisions. This book has the details.
Book VIII: Technical Analysis
Whether you aspire to become a self-supporting trader, need to sharpen 
your trading skills, or just want to get out ahead of another crash, you may
decide that technical analysis is the tool to help you. As this book explains,
technical analysis is a way of studying how securities prices move so that
you can use the information to maximize your returns and minimize your
losses. Essentially, it’s a way of identifying pricing trends. Get good enough 
at identifying these market fluctuations — up, down, or sideways — and you
can improve the timing of your investment decisions.
Icons Used in This Book
You’ll see four icons scattered around the margins of the text. Here’s the func-
tion of each:
This icon notes something you should keep in mind about the topic at hand.

Introduction

Tip information tells you how to invest a little better, a little smarter, a little
more efficiently. The information can help you ask better questions or make
smarter moves with your money.
Plenty of things in the world of investing can cause you to make expensive
mistakes. These points help you avoid big problems.
Here’s where you’ll find interesting but non-essential information. Whether
this icon highlights background info, investment theories, or trivia, it’s all
skippable. Read it or pass it up as you like.
Where to Go from Here
Where you go from here depends entirely on you. If you’re a start-at-the-
beginning-and-read-through-to-the-end type of person, by all means, feel 
free. But you may find that picking and choosing a topic of interest is more
suited to your style. Fortunately, there are a number of ways to find what
you’re looking for. You can use the Table of Contents to find general discus-
sions or the index to find specific topics. Or if you prefer, you can simply
thumb through the pages and alight on whatever topic catches your eye. 
The bottom line? Use this book however you need to. If you’re just beginning
your foray into more advanced investing, however, you may want to begin
with Books I and II, which contain basic information.

Book I
Investment Basics

In this book . . .
M
ost topics run the gamut from very basic information
to very advanced information, and most people
need to start at one end (usually the ﬁrst) and work their
way to the other (usually the last). Books III through VIII
are devoted to the advanced investing information. Book II
shares info on traditional investment options that even
high-end investors can (and often do) take advantage of.
This part? It covers the very basic information: the funda-
mental principles of investing and investing options, and
basic information about the role of indexes and
exchanges.
If you’re a high-end investor, you probably already know
quite a bit of this stuff. But if you’re a beginner or still
trying to get a handle on how to approach your portfolio
or what the difference is between an index and an
exchange, this is a great place to start.

Chapter 1
What Every Investor Should Know
In This Chapter
 Listing your investment options
 Identifying investment strategies
 Understanding the purpose of the SEC
 Recognizing the key role of investment brokers
F
or anyone who’s inclined to invest in the markets or engage in trading,
there are a few fundamental things to know, like the different types of
investments and investment strategies, what the SEC does (and why you should
care), and who brokers are and what they do. (The next chapter outlines the
indexes and exchanges, another basic but important bit of information.)
If you’re an experienced investor already, these things will be familiar. But 
if you’re just beginning to branch out from more traditional investments to
more aggressive ones, spend some time with this chapter to get up to speed.
Seeing Your Investment 
Options at a Glance
As an investor, you have a variety of options to choose from. Which you
choose depends on your financial goals, your investment preferences, and
your tolerance for risk. Some are suitable for all investors; others are geared
more toward the experienced investor.
Traditional investment vehicles
The investment vehicles mentioned in this section are those that, by and
large, any investor — big or small, novice or experienced — can take advan-
tage of. You may have some of these in your portfolio already. 

These options represent traditional investments: You put your money down
and hold on. Although you want to make changes as necessary to protect
your investment, these types of investments can add ballast to more aggres-
sive investment strategies (like trading and hedging).
Stocks
When you buy stock, you’re buying ownership in a corporation (or company).
The benefit of owning stock in a corporation is that whenever the corporation
profits, you profit as well. Typically, investors buy stocks and hold them for 
a long time, making decisions along the way about reallocating investment
capital as financial needs change, selling underperformers, and so on.
As an investor, you want to make sure that your stock portfolio is carefully
balanced among the different types of stocks (growth, value, domestic, inter-
national, and so on) and your other investments. A well-balanced traditional
portfolio (which includes stocks and long-, short-, and intermediate-term
bonds) generally offers a steady return of between 5 and 12 percent, depend-
ing on the specific investments and the amount of risk you’re willing to
assume. For more on investing in stocks, see the first chapter in Book II.
Bonds
To raise money, governments, government agencies, municipalities, and cor-
porations can sell bonds. When you buy a bond, you’re essentially lending
money to this entity for the promise of repayment in addition to a specified
annual return. In that sense, a bond is really nothing more than an IOU with 
a serial number. People in suits, to sound impressive, sometimes call bonds
debt securities or fixed-income securities.
Although some entities are more reliable than others (the federal government
isn’t as likely as a company that’s facing hard financial times to go bankrupt
and renege on its obligations), bonds generally offer stability and predictabil-
ity well beyond that of most other investments. Because you are, in most
cases, receiving a steady stream of income (the annual returns, for example),
and because you expect to get your principal back in one piece (at the end 
of the bond’s life), bonds tend to be more conservative investments than
stocks, commodities, or collectibles. To find out more about bonds, go to
Book II, Chapter 2.
Mutual funds
Simply put, a mutual fund is an investment company. Investors put money
into that company, and an investment manager buy securities on behalf of all
the investors. Those securities may include various types of stocks, various
types of bonds, or both. If you invest in mutual funds, you have thousands of
options to choose from, each representing a different mixture of securities.
10
Book I: Investment Basics 

Because so many shareholders pool their money into each mutual fund, an
investment manager can buy a diverse portfolio of securities — much more
diverse than most individuals can manage to buy on their own.
Mutual funds are extremely popular investment vehicles. More than 23 per-
cent of household financial assets were invested in mutual funds as of the
end of 2006. For all the details on mutual funds, see Chapter 3 of Book II.
Exchange-traded funds
Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are something of a cross between an index
mutual fund and a stock. Although relatively new, they’ve grown exponen-
tially in the past few years — nearly 50 percent in 2005 — and they will surely
continue to grow and gain influence.
Among the characteristics that make ETFs so compelling is the fact that
they’re cheap. Many ETFs carry total management expenses under 0.20 per-
cent a year. Some of the larger ETFs carry management fees as low as 0.07
percent a year. The average mutual fund, in contrast, charges 1.67 percent a
year. ETFs are also tax-smart. Because of the way they’re structured, the
taxes you pay on any growth are minimal. Chapter 4 of Book II gives an
overview of ETFs.
Annuities
Annuities are investments with money-back guarantees: You invest a certain
amount of money for a promise that you’ll get your money back, with inter-
est, after (or over) a certain time period. That’s all that annuities really 
are — along with enough exceptions, disclaimers, and contingencies to fill a
medium-sized law library. Bottom line? The exact nature of the guarantee
varies with the type of annuity. In fixed annuity contracts, for instance, your
rate of return is guaranteed for a certain number of years. In the latest vari-
able annuity contracts, you can lock in a guaranteed rate of return. With an
immediate annuity, you get guaranteed income.
Although guarantees always sound good, annuities aren’t for everyone. To
find out more about them and decide whether your investment portfolio
should include one, read Chapter 5 from Book II.
High-end investment or speculation vehicles
In some ways, higher-end investments aren’t much different than traditional
investments: You invest your money in stocks or bonds or mutual funds or
ETFs and make all the same decisions that an average investor does. The dif-
ference is the amount of capital in play (typically a lot) or the risk exposure
(typically high).
11
Chapter 1: What Every Investor Should Know
Book I
Investment
Basics

In other ways, high-end investing is an almost completely different beast. It’s
not so much investing (buying and holding on) as it is trading or speculating —
assuming a business risk with the hope of profiting from market fluctuations.
Successful speculating requires analyzing situations, predicting outcomes,
and putting your money on one side of a trade based on those predictions.
Speculating also involves an appreciation of the fact that you can be wrong
70 percent of the time and still be successful if you apply the correct tech-
niques for analyzing trades, managing your money, and protecting your
account. Basically, high-end investing means you have to chuck all your pre-
conceptions about buy-and-hold investing and asset allocation, and essen-
tially all the strategies that stock brokerages put out for public consumption.
The following sections outline the high-end investment vehicles you can find
out about in this book.
Futures and options
Futures and options, by their very nature, are complex financial instruments.
It’s not like investing in a mutual fund, where you mail your check and wait
for quarterly statements and dividends. If you invest in futures and options
contracts, you need to monitor your positions on a daily basis, often even on
an hourly basis. You have to keep track of the expiration date, the premium
paid, the strike price, margin requirements, and a number of other shifting
variables.
That said, understanding futures and options can be very beneficial because
they are powerful tools. They provide you with leverage and risk manage-
ment opportunities that your average financial instruments don’t offer. If you
can harness the power of these instruments, you can dramatically increase
your leverage — and performance — in the markets. Book III explains invest-
ing in futures and options.
Commodities
Commodities are the raw materials humans use to create a livable world: the
agricultural products, mineral ore, and energy that are the essential building
blocks of the global economy. The commodities markets are broad and deep,
presenting both challenges and opportunities. For example, how do you
decide whether to trade crude oil or gold, sugar or palladium, natural gas or
frozen concentrated orange juice, soybeans or aluminum? What about corn,
feeder cattle, and silver — should you trade these commodities as well? And
if you do, what is the best way to invest in them? Should you go through the
futures markets, through the equity markets, or buy the physical stuff (such
as silver coins or gold bullion)? And do all commodities move in tandem, or
do they perform independently of each other? To start your search for
answers, turn to Book IV.
12
Book I: Investment Basics 

A lot of folks equate (incorrectly) commodities exclusively with the futures
markets. There is no doubt that the two are inextricably linked: The futures
markets offer a way for commercial users to hedge against commodity price
risks and a means for investors and traders to profit from this price risk. But
equity markets are also deeply involved in commodities, as are a number of
investment vehicles, such as master limited partnerships (MLPs), exchange-
traded funds (ETFs), and commodity mutual funds.
Foreign currency trading
When you get involved in foreign currency trading (sometimes called forex
trading), you’re essentially speculating on the value of one currency versus
another. You “buy” a currency just as you’d buy an individual stock, or any
other financial security, in the hope that it will make a profitable return. But
the value of your security is particularly volatile because of the many factors
that can affect a currency’s value and the amazingly quick timeframe in which
these values can change. Nevertheless, if you’re an active trader looking for
alternatives to trading stocks or futures, the forex market is hard to beat.
Online trading innovations over the past decade have made it accessible,
both technologically and financially. Find out more in Book V.
Trading foreign currencies is a challenging and potentially profitable opportu-
nity for educated and experienced investors. Before deciding to participate in
the forex market, carefully consider your investment objectives, level of expe-
rience, and risk appetite. Most important, don’t invest money you can’t afford
to lose. The leveraged nature of forex trading means that any market move-
ment will have an equally proportional effect on your deposited funds; this
may work against you as well as for you.
Hedge funds
In a nutshell, hedge funds are lightly regulated private partnerships that
pursue high returns through multiple strategies. A hedge fund manager may
invest in almost any opportunity in the market where he or she foresees
favorable risk to reward. Through hedge funds, you can net some high
returns for your portfolio — if you don’t mind the risk and have a lot of
money to invest.
Because of the risk and the investment criteria, hedge funds aren’t open to
most investors. In fact, to participate, you have to meet strict limits put in
place by the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding your worth (a
net worth of at least $1 million and/or an annual income exceeding $200,000
in each of the two most recent years).
A hedge fund differs from so-called “real money” — traditional investment
accounts like mutual funds, pensions, and endowments — because it has
more freedom (read: little to no regulatory oversight) to pursue aggressive
investment strategies, which can lead to huge gains or huge losses. To find
out more about hedge funds, head to Book VI.

Studying Investment Strategies
No matter how much money an investor has to invest, how tolerant she is 
of high-risk investments, or how willing she is to absorb some losses for a
higher gain, no investor likes losing money. Regardless of what investment
vehicle you choose — whether traditional, high-end, or a combination — you
want to invest smart. And that means making good decisions about where to
put your money and when to make a trade.
The strategy you use depends on the particular investment vehicle.
Sometimes, the dividing line between success and failure is knowing the
value of the business or company you’re putting your money in. Other times,
the key component is recognizing a trend — what the market is doing or get-
ting ready to do — so you can beat the crowd. The following sections explain.
Value investing: It’s fundamental!
What is something really worth? Regardless of what you buy — or invest in —
this nagging question ruins sleep for value types. You pay six figures for a
house and know that its value is a whole lot greater than the sum of the parts.
Not only does it include the nails or two-by-fours or roof shingles and the
work required to put everything together, but also what the house returns 
to you as a living space now, in the future, and compared to alternatives.
Investments can be looked at in much the same way. You can round up all the
buildings, trucks, pallet jacks, and PCs that a company owns, assign a value to
each, and add it all up, but that still doesn’t tell what’s really important about
the business. What you want is a way to evaluate a business’s intrinsic value.
Finding intrinsic valuation is the art and science of placing a fair value on cur-
rent and future investment returns. When assets are deployed productively,
you don’t care about the value of pallet jacks. The return is the main thing!
Value investing is about figuring out the intrinsic value of a business so that
you can recognize when a business is undervalued: That’s where the poten-
tial is. Book VII has the details.
Technical analysis
Technical analysis (sometimes called charting, market timing, and trend-
following) is a set of forecasting methods that can help you make better trad-
ing decisions and manage market risk. Technical analysis is the study of how
securities prices behave and how to exploit that information to make money
14
Book I: Investment Basics 

while avoiding losses. With technical analysis, your goal is to identify price
trends for a certain time period and/or forecast the price of a security in
order to buy and sell that security to make a cash profit. Technical analysis is
ideal for traders (those who make profits from trading), not investors (those
who view securities as savings vehicles).
As a technical trader, you devise rules for dealing with price developments as
they occur. But how you analyze prices can take many different forms — from
drawing lines on a chart by hand to using high-powered computer software
to calculate the most likely path of a price out of a zillion randomly generated
paths. You can find the details in Book VIII.
Recognizing and Managing 
Investment Risks
As an investor, you face many risks. The most obvious is financial risk.
Companies go bankrupt, trading decisions go south, the best laid investment
plans go awry, and you can end up losing your money — all or some of it,
whether the economy is strong or weak. What puts your finances at risk?
Here are some types of risk:
 Interest rate risk: Interest rates, set by banks and influenced by the
Federal Reserve, change on a regular basis. When the Fed raises or
lowers interest rates, banks raise or lower interest rates accordingly.
Interest rate changes affect consumers, businesses, and, of course,
investors. Whether rising or falling interest rates are good or bad
depends on the type of investment.
 Market risk: No matter how modern our society and economic system,
you can’t escape the laws of supply and demand. When masses of
people want to buy a particular stock, it becomes in demand, and its
value rises. That value rises higher if the supply is limited. Conversely, if
no one’s interested in buying a stock, its value falls. This is the nature of
market risk. The value of your stock can rise and fall on the fickle whim
of market demand. For that reason, what the market does (goes up or
goes down) and its mood (bullish or bearish) impact your investments.
 Inflation risk: Inflation is the growth of the money supply without a com-
mensurate increase in the supply of goods and services. To consumers,
inflation shows up in the form of higher prices for goods and services.
Inflation risk frequently is also referred to as purchasing power risk
because your money doesn’t buy as much as it used to.
15
Chapter 1: What Every Investor Should Know
Book I
Investment
Basics

 Tax risk: Taxes don’t affect your investments directly, but they do affect
how much of your money you get to keep. To minimize tax risk, be aware
of the tax implications and obligations associated with the different
types of investments. Because the tax rules are complex, differ for differ-
ent investment vehicles and scenarios, and change regularly, talk to your
accountant, tax advisor, or tax attorney for guidance.
 Political and governmental risks: If investment vehicles were fish, 
politics and government policies (such as taxes, laws, and regulations)
would be the pond. In the same way that fish die in a toxic or polluted
pond, politics and government policies greatly influence the financial
stability of companies and commodities, the value of currencies — you
name it.
 Emotional risk: Emotions are important risk considerations because 
the main decision-makers are human beings. Logic and discipline are
critical factors in investment success, but even the best investor can let
emotions take over the reins of money management and create loss. For
any kind of investing, the main emotions that can sidetrack you are fear
and greed.
Despite this rather lengthy list of all the ways your investments can be at
risk, the good news is there are steps you can take to minimize risk.
Diversify, diversify, diversify
One of the best ways to manage risk is through diversification, a strategy for
reducing risk by spreading your money across different investments. It’s a
fancy way of saying, “Don’t have all your eggs in one basket.” But how do you
go about divvying up your money and distributing it among different invest-
ments? The easiest way to understand proper diversification may be to look
at what you should not do:
 Don’t put all your money in just one investment vehicle. One of the
benefits of using commodities to minimize your overall portfolio risk, for
example, is that commodities tend to behave differently than stocks and
bonds.
 Don’t tie up all your money in one type of asset class. In order for
diversification to have the desired effect on your portfolio (to minimize
risk), you want to spread the wealth among different asset classes: large
cap and small cap, for example.
 Don’t put all your money in one industry. If a problem hits an entire
industry, you’ll get hurt.
16
Book I: Investment Basics 

Research your investment
One way to minimize risk is to research all aspects of the investment you’re
about to undertake — before you undertake it. Too often, investors won’t
start doing research until after they invest.
A large number of investors jump in on hype; they hear a certain thing men-
tioned in the press, and they leap in just because everyone else is. Acting on
impulse is one of the most detrimental habits you can develop as an investor
or a trader. Before you put your money in anything, find out as much as pos-
sible about this potential investment.
Of course, simply knowing about the investment — its pros and cons and so
forth — isn’t enough. You have to stay up to speed on all the things that can
affect your industry of choice in general and your specific investments or
trades in particular.
Practice before you jump in
Before you actually put money in any type of new investment or make your
first trade, make a few dry runs. For example, pick a few stocks that you think
will increase in value and then track them for a while to see how they per-
form. Watch a few trades online and see how the process works. Create a few
technical charts and see how accurately you’re able to identify trends.
Noting the Role of the SEC
Long before you invest your first dollar, get to know the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC). It’s there primarily to protect investors from
fraud and other unlawful activity designed to fleece them. The SEC was 
created during the early 1930s by the federal government to crack down 
on abuses that continued to linger from the speculative and questionable
trading practices that were in high gear during the 1920s. It continues to 
this day to be the most important watchdog of the investment industry.
The SEC has an excellent Web site at www.sec.gov. The site offers plenty of
great articles and resources for both novice and experienced investors to
help you watch out for fraud and better understand the financial markets and
how they work. Look up the telephone numbers for regional offices, and feel
free to call with your questions about dubious investments and broker/deal-
ers. The SEC carries on a number of activities designed to help you invest
with confidence. It maintains a database on file about complaints lodged
17
Chapter 1: What Every Investor Should Know
Book I
Investment
Basics

against brokers and companies that have committed fraud or other abuses
against the investing public. Your tax dollars pay for this important agency.
Find out about its free publications, services, and resources before you
invest. If you’ve already been victimized by unscrupulous operators, call 
the SEC for assistance.
Other than stipulations regarding who can invest in a hedge fund, the SEC
provides little or no oversight for this very high-end investment vehicle. The
presumption is that folks who can actually qualify to participate in hedge
funds are also fairly experienced investors and knowledgeable about the
risks associated with these funds. If you invest in hedge funds, you’re pretty
much on your own.
Going for Brokers
Many investment options require that you negotiate your trades or buy and
sell through a broker. A broker is essentially an intermediary between you and
the investing world. Brokers can be organizations (Charles Schwab, Merrill
Lynch, E*TRADE, and so on) and individuals. Although the primary task of
brokers is to act as the intermediary, they can perform other tasks as well:
 Providing advisory services: Investors pay brokers a fee for investment
advice.
 Offering limited banking services: Brokers can offer features such as
interest-bearing accounts and check writing.
Brokers make their money through various fees, including the following:
 Brokerage commissions: This is a fee for buying and/or selling stocks
and other securities.
 Margin interest charges: This is interest charged to investors for bor-
rowing against their brokerage account for investment purposes.
 Service charges: These are charges for performing administrative tasks
and other functions. For example, brokers charge fees to investors for
individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and for mailing stocks in certifi-
cate form.
Any broker you deal with should be registered with the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC). In addition, to protect your money after you’ve deposited it into a 
brokerage account, that broker should be a member of Securities Investor
Protection Corporation (SIPC). SIPC doesn’t protect you from market losses;
it protects your money in case the brokerage firm goes out of business. To
find out whether the broker is registered with these organizations, contact
FINRA, the SEC, and SIPC.

Book I: Investment Basics 

Full-service or discount?
There are two basic categories of brokers: full-service and discount. The type
you choose really depends on what type of investor you are. In a nutshell,
full-service brokers are suitable for investors who need some guidance, while
discount brokers are better for those who are sufficiently confident and
knowledgeable about investing to manage with minimal help.
Full-service brokers
Full-service brokers are just what the name indicates. They try to provide as
many services as possible for investors who open accounts with them. When
you open an account at a brokerage firm, a representative is assigned to your
account. This representative is usually called an account executive, a regis-
tered rep, or a financial consultant by the brokerage firm. This person usually
has a securities license and is knowledgeable about stocks in particular and
investing in general.
Your account executive is responsible for assisting you, answering questions
about your account and the securities in your portfolio, and transacting 
your buy and sell orders. Here are some things that full-service brokers can
do for you:
 Offer guidance and advice: The greatest distinction between full-service
brokers and discount brokers is the personal attention you receive from
your account rep. You get to be on a first-name basis, and you disclose
much information about your finances and financial goals. The rep is
there to make recommendations about stocks and funds that are suitable
for you.
Brokers and account reps are salespeople. No matter how well they treat
you, they’re still compensated based on their ability to produce revenue
for the brokerage firm. They generate commissions and fees from you on
behalf of the company. (In other words, they’re paid to sell you things.)
 Provide access to research: Full-service brokers can give you access 
to their investment research department, which can give you in-depth
information and analysis on a particular company.
 Help you achieve your investment objectives: Beyond advice on spe-
cific investments, a good rep gets to know you and your investment
goals and then offers advice and answers your questions about how 
specific investments and strategies can help you accomplish your
wealth-building goals.
 Make investment decisions on your behalf: Many investors don’t want
to be bothered when it comes to investment decisions. Full-service bro-
kers can actually make decisions for your account with your authoriza-
tion. This service may be fine, but be sure to require the broker to
explain his or her choices to you.
19
Chapter 1: What Every Investor Should Know
Book I
Investment
Basics

Handing over decision-making authority to your rep can be a possible
negative because letting others make financial decisions for you is
always dicey — especially when they’re using your money. If they make
poor investment choices that lose you money, you may not have any
recourse because you authorized them to act on your behalf. More egre-
gious is a practice called churning: buying and selling securities for the
sole purpose of generating commissions.
Before you deal with any broker, full-service or otherwise, get a free report 
on the broker from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority by calling
800-289-9999 or visiting its Web site at www.finra.org (click on “FINRA
BrokerCheck”). The report can indicate whether any complaints or penalties
have been filed against that brokerage firm or the individual rep.
Discount brokers
Perhaps you don’t need any hand-holding from a broker. You know what you
want, and you can make your own investment decisions. All you want is
someone to transact your buy/sell orders. In that case, go with a discount
broker. Discount brokers, as the name implies, are cheaper to engage than
full-service brokers. They don’t offer advice or premium services, though —
just the basics required to perform your transactions.
If you choose to work with a discount broker, you must know as much as pos-
sible about your personal goals and needs. You have a greater responsibility
for conducting adequate research to make good stock selections, and you
must be prepared to accept the outcome, whatever that may be. Because
you’re advising yourself, you can save on costs that you would have incurred
had you paid for a full-service broker.
There are two types of discount brokers: conventional discount brokers and
Internet discount brokers. Conventional discount brokers (such as Charles
Schwab) have national offices where you walk in and speak to the customer
service staff face-to-face. You can transact in person, over the phone, or
through the Internet. Internet discount brokerage firms (such as E*TRADE)
have essentially the same services except for the walk-in offices and face-to-
face communication.
Both conventional and Internet-based discount brokers share many of the
same primary advantages over full-service brokers, including the following:
 Lower cost: This lower cost is usually the result of lower commissions.
 Unbiased service: Because discount brokers offer you the ability to
transact your buys and sells only without advice, they have no vested
interest in trying to sell you any particular security.
 Access to information: Established discount brokers offer extensive
educational materials at their offices or on their Web sites.

Choosing a broker
Before you choose a broker, you need to analyze your personal investing style.
After you know yourself and the way you invest, you can proceed to finding
the kind of broker that fits your needs. Keep the following points in mind:
 Match your investment style with a brokerage firm that charges the least
amount of money for the services you’re likely to use most frequently.
 Compare all the costs of buying, selling, and holding stocks and other
securities through a broker. Don’t compare only commissions. Compare
other costs, too, such as margin interest and other service charges.
 Use broker comparison services such as Gomez Advisors at www.gomez.
com and read articles that compare brokers in publications such as
SmartMoney and Barron’s.
Picking among types of 
brokerage accounts
Most brokerage firms offer investors several different types of accounts, each
serving a different purpose. The three most common are presented in the fol-
lowing sections. The basic difference boils down to how particular brokers
view your “creditworthiness” when it comes to buying and selling securities.
If your credit isn’t great, your only choice is a cash account. If your credit is
good, you can open either a cash account or a margin account.
Cash accounts
A cash account (also referred to as a Type 1 account) is just what you think it
is: You deposit a sum of money with the new account application to begin
trading. The amount of your initial deposit varies from broker to broker.
Some brokers have a minimum of $10,000, while others let you open an
account for as little as $500.
With a cash account, your money has to be deposited in the account before
the closing (or settlement) date for any trade you make. The closing occurs
three business days after the date you make the trade (the date of execution).
If you have cash in a brokerage account (remember, all accounts are broker-
age accounts, and “cash” and “margin” are simply types of brokerage
accounts), see whether the broker will pay you interest on it and how much.
Some offer a service in which uninvested money earns money-market rates.

Chapter 1: What Every Investor Should Know
Book I
Investment
Basics

Margin accounts
A margin account (also called a Type 2 account) gives you the ability to
borrow money against the securities in the account to buy more stock. 
After you’re approved, your brokerage firm gives you credit. A margin
account has all the benefits of a cash account plus this ability of buying on
margin. A margin account is also necessary if you plan on doing short-selling.
The interest rate that you pay varies depending on the broker, but most 
brokers generally charge a rate that is several points higher than their 
own borrowing rate.
Option accounts
An option account (also referred to as a Type 3 account) gives you all the
capabilities of a margin account (which in turn also gives you the capabilities
of a cash account) plus the ability to trade stock and index options. To open
an options account, the broker usually asks you to sign a statement that you
are knowledgeable about options and are familiar with the risks associated
with them.

Indexes and Exchanges
In This Chapter
 Defining indexes and exchanges
 Exploring the Dow, the S&P 500, and other key indexes
 Looking at important market exchanges
“H
ow’s the market doing today?” is probably the most common question
that investors ask about the stock market. “What did the Dow do?”
“How about NASDAQ?” Invariably, people asking those questions are expecting
the performance number of an index. “Well, the Dow fell 57 points to 13,100,
while NASDAQ was unchanged at 2,375.” Indexes can be useful, general gauges
of stock market activity. They give investors a basic idea of how well (or how
poorly) the overall market is doing. Exchanges — the places (physical or 
electronic) where the buying and selling actually take place — are important
too. This chapter gives you the lowdown on both.
Indexes: Tracking the Market
Indexes, which measure and report changes in the value of a selected group
of securities, give investors an instant snapshot of how well the market is
doing. Through them, you can quickly compare the performance of your
portfolio with the rest of the market. If the Dow goes up 10 percent in a year
and your portfolio shows a cumulative gain of 12 percent, you know that
you’re doing well.
Indexes are weighted; that is, their calculations take into account the relative
importance of the items being evaluated. There are several kinds of indexes:
 Price-weighted index: This index tracks changes based on the change in
the individual stock’s price per share. Suppose that you own two stocks:
Stock A worth $20 per share and Stock B worth $40 per share. In a price-
weighted index, the stock at $40 is allocated a greater proportion of the
index than the one at $20.

 Market value–weighted index: This index tracks the proportion of a
stock based on its market capitalization (or market value). Say that in
your portfolio the $20 stock (Stock A) has 10 million shares and the $40
stock (Stock B) has only 1 million shares. Stock A’s market cap is $200
million, while Stock B’s market cap is $40 million. In a market value–
weighted index, Stock A represents 83 percent of the index’s value
because of its much larger market cap.
This sample portfolio shows only two stocks — obviously not a good
representative index. Most investing professionals (especially money
managers and mutual fund firms) use a broad-based index as a benchmark
to compare their progress. A broad-based index is an index that represents
the performance of the entire market, such as the S&P 500.
 Composite index: This type of index is a combination of several indexes.
An example is the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Composite, which
tracks the entire exchange by combining all the stocks and indexes that
are included in it.
Dow Jones Industrial Average
The oldest and most famous stock market index is the Dow Jones Industrial
Average (DJIA or, more commonly, the Dow). It is most frequently the index
quoted when someone asks how the market is doing. The Dow is price-
weighted and tracks a basket of 30 of the largest and most influential public
companies in the stock market.
The Dow has survived as a popular gauge of stock market activity for over a
century. Although it is an important indicator of the market’s progress, it
does have one major drawback: It tracks only 30 companies. Regardless of
their status in the market, the companies in the Dow represent a limited number,
so they don’t communicate the true pulse of the market. Nor is the Dow a
pure gauge of industrial activity because it also includes a hodgepodge of
nonindustrial issues such as JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup (banks), Home
Depot (retailing), and Microsoft (software).
Serious investors are better served by looking at broad-based indexes, such
as the S&P 500 and the Wilshire 5000, and industry or sector indexes, which
better gauge the growth (or lack thereof) of specific industries and sectors.

Book I: Investment Basics 

Standard & Poor’s 500
The Standard & Poor’s 500 (S&P 500) is an index that tracks the 500 largest
(measured by market value) publicly traded companies. Because it contains
500 companies, the S&P is more representative of the overall market’s perfor-
mance than the Dow. Money managers and financial advisors watch the S&P
500 more closely than the Dow. Mutual funds especially like to measure their
performance against the S&P 500 rather than against any other index.
The S&P 500 includes companies that are widely held and widely followed. The
companies are also leaders in a variety of industries, including energy,
technology, healthcare, and finance. It is a market value–weighted index.
Although it is a reliable indicator of the market’s overall status, the S&P 500
also has some limitations. Despite the fact that it tracks 500 companies, the top
50 companies encompass 50 percent of the index’s market value. This situation
can be a drawback because those 50 companies have a greater influence on
the S&P 500 index’s price movement than any other segment of companies. In
other words, 10 percent of the companies have an equal impact to 90 percent of
the companies on the same index. Therefore, the index may not offer an
accurate representation of the general market.
The 500 companies in the S&P are not set in stone. They can be added or
removed as market conditions change. A company can be removed if it is not
doing well or goes bankrupt. A company in the index can be replaced by
another company that is doing better. For more information, visit www.
standardandpoors.com.
QQQ
QQQ (or Qubes) is the index that tracks NASDAQ-100: the top 100 stocks
traded on the NASDAQ, an exchange that’s discussed later in this chapter.
This index is for investors who want to concentrate on the largest companies,
which tend to be especially weighted in technology issues. QQQ is a favorite
index among day-traders — much more so than the S&P 500 or the Dow —
because it tends to be much more volatile.
Russell 1000, 2000, and 3000
The Russell 3000 index includes the 3,000 largest publicly traded companies
(nearly 98 percent of publicly traded stocks). The Russell 3000 is important
because it includes many mid cap and small cap stocks. Most companies
covered in the Russell 3000 have an average market value of a billion dollars
or less.
25
Chapter 2: Indexes and Exchanges
Book I
Investment
Basics

The Russell 3000 index was created by the Frank Russell Company, which
computes a series of indexes including the Russell 1000 and the Russell 2000.
The Russell 2000 contains the smallest 2,000 companies from the Russell 
3000, while the Russell 1000 contains the largest 1,000 companies. The
Russell indexes do not cover microcap stocks (companies with a market
capitalization under $250 million).
Even though the largest 1,000 U.S. stocks are in the Russell 1000, this index
remains relatively obscure because the Dow and the S&P 500 hog the spot-
light when it comes to measuring large cap performance. For more informa-
tion, visit www.russell.com.
Dow Jones Wilshire 5000
The Wilshire 5000, which is often referred to as the Wilshire Total Market
Index, is probably the largest stock index in the world. Created in 1974 by
Wilshire Associates, it started out tracking 5,000 stocks and has ballooned to
cover more than 7,500 stocks. The advantage of the Wilshire 5000 is that it’s
very comprehensive, covering nearly the entire market. (At the very least,
the stocks tracked are the largest publicly traded stocks.) It includes all the
stocks that are on the major stock exchanges (NYSE, AMEX, and the largest
issues on NASDAQ), which by default also include all the stocks covered by
the S&P 500. The Wilshire 5000 is a market value–weighted index. For more
information, visit www.wilshire.com.
Morgan Stanley Capital International
With indexes of all kinds — stocks, bonds, hedge funds, U.S. and international
securities — Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI), although not quite
a household name, has been gaining ground as the indexer of choice for many
exchange-traded fund (ETF) providers. MSCI indexes are the backbone of
domestic and international Vanguard ETFs, as well as Barclays iShares
individual country ETFs. For more information, visit www.msci.com.
International indexes
The whole world is a vast marketplace that interacts with and exerts tremen-
dous influence on individual national economies and markets. Whether you
have one stock or a mutual fund or multiple investment vehicles, keep tabs
on how your portfolio is affected by world markets. The best way to get a
snapshot of international markets is, of course, with indexes. Here are some
of the more widely followed international indexes:
26
Book I: Investment Basics 

 Nikkei (Japan): This is considered Japan’s version of the Dow. If you’re
invested in Japanese stocks or in stocks that do business with Japan,
you can bet that you want to know what’s up with the Nikkei.
 FTSE 100 (Great Britain): Usually referred to as the footsie, this is a
market value–weighted index of the top 100 public companies in the
United Kingdom.
 CAC 40 (France): This index tracks the 40 public stocks that trade on
the Paris Stock Exchange.
 DAX (Germany): This index tracks the 30 largest and most active stocks
that trade on the Frankfurt Exchange.
You can track these international indexes (among others) at major financial
Web sites, such as www.bloomberg.com and www.marketwatch.com.
Lehman Brothers
Yeah, I know it sounds like a clothing shop in Brooklyn, but Lehman Brothers
is actually the world’s leading provider of fixed income benchmarks. Barclays
iShares uses Lehman Brothers indexes for five of its six fixed-income ETFs.

Exchanges: Securities Marketplaces
Stock exchanges are organized marketplaces for the buying and selling of
stocks and other securities. The main exchanges for most stock investors are
these three:
 New York Stock Exchange: www.nyse.com
 American Stock Exchange: www.amex.com
 NASDAQ: www.nasdaq.com
New York Stock Exchange
Tracing its origins to 1792, the New York Stock Exchange today lists nearly
2,700 securities and trades about 1.5 billion shares a day. Many of the member
companies are among the largest in the United States. All together, New York
Stock Exchange companies represent over three-quarters of the total market
capitalization in the nation. Trading occurs on the floor of the exchange with
specialists and floor traders running the show. The Web site for the New York
Stock Exchange is www.nyse.com.

Chapter 2: Indexes and Exchanges
Book I
Investment
Basics

The specialist
Specialists are the workers who are responsible for matching buyers to sell-
ers. The specialists’ role is to be certain that the stocks for which they’re
responsible are traded in a fair, competitive, orderly, and efficient market,
ensuring that all customers have an equal opportunity to buy shares while
receiving the best prices. The specialist seeks to avoid large or unreasonable
price fluctuations between consecutive sales and usually is fairly successful.
The four critical roles that specialists serve on the floor of the exchange are
 Auctioneer: The specialist serving in the capacity of an auctioneer shows
the best bids and offers throughout the trading day. This information is
disseminated electronically through the NYSE systems and reaches a
worldwide audience almost instantaneously. The specialist maintains
order and interacts with agents whose customers want to buy the stock.
 Agent: The specialist is the agent for SuperDOT (electronically routed)
orders. Floor brokers also may leave an order with a specialist with
instructions for the specialist to execute the order at a later time when
the stock is available at a specified price. When specialists take on this
role, they have the same fiduciary responsibilities as a broker.
Fiduciary responsibility in this situation means that someone has volun-
tarily agreed to act as a caretaker of another person’s assets and must
carry out those responsibilities in good faith with honesty and integrity,
and in a way that benefits the asset owner for which the agent has taken
the responsibility.
 Catalyst: Specialists serving as catalysts actually become conduits for
the flow of orders, keeping track of all known interest in the stock,
because not all buyers and sellers are always represented on the floor of
the exchange.
 Principal: Specialists must place and execute all orders ahead of their
own. Three out of four transactions at the NYSE actually take place
between customers without the capital participation of the specialist. In
the small minority of trades in which specialists do participate, their
role is to provide capital and add liquidity to the market. This capital
bridges temporary gaps in supply or demand, which in turn helps
reduce price volatility.
The floor trader
The guys you see on the floor of the stock exchange waving their hands
wildly to make trades are the floor traders. They’re actually members of the
NYSE who trade exclusively for their own accounts. Floor traders also can act
as floor brokers for others and sell their services.
28
Book I: Investment Basics 

The NYSE is the last big stock exchange to use the open outcry system, in
which stocks are sold like a public auction with verbal bids and offers
shouted in trading pits. This system may soon become history because the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is pushing for changes after
bowing to pressure exerted by investor groups. Major players such as
Fidelity and AIG have joined the voices of individual investors who want to
see a change in this antiquated system to a more modern system similar to
that used by NASDAQ. If the SEC succeeds, this change would be the biggest
shake-up in the more than 200-year history of the NYSE.
The SuperDOT (Designated Order Turnaround) system
Orders from brokers not on the floor of the exchange reach specialists
through the SuperDOT system. SuperDOT is a stock order entering system
that can handle daily trading volume that exceeds 2 billion shares. The
system sends brokers messages through a common message switch to the
proper specialist’s trading-floor workstation. Specialists handle these trades
as buyers or sellers as particular stocks and orders become available, and
they send acknowledgements to the originating brokerage firms, using the
same switching system.
American Stock Exchange
The Amex lists roughly 1,350 securities and has a daily trading volume of about
83 million shares. Amex lists stocks that are smaller in size than those on the
NYSE yet still have a national following. Many firms that first list on Amex work
to meet the listing requirements of the NYSE and then switch over.
Trades on the Amex are executed using an automated or manual order pro-
cessing system. In the automated system, orders are routed electronically to
specialists, virtually eliminating the use of paper on the trading floor. Using a
system called the Booth Automated Routing System (BARS), transactions are
electronically captured, and reports to member firms are generated. Rather
than the specialist’s order books, Amex uses a New Equity Trading System
(NETS) to collect information about the trades and automate the process of
updating and matching orders, quoting and reporting trades, and regulating
and researching order details.
Orders also can be placed manually by calling the floor broker by phone.
Manual order processes usually are initiated for large or complex orders.
Specialists in a stock help to assemble the buyers or sellers for these orders.
See www.amex.com for more details.

NASDAQ
No bricks and mortar here. The NASDAQ, which lists over 3,200 securities
and trades about 2 billion shares a day, is a uniquely electronic exchange and
the fastest growing stock market today. (The acronym NASDAQ stands for
National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation system.)
The market was formed after an SEC study in the early 1960s concluded that
the sale of over-the-counter securities (those that aren’t traded on the exist-
ing stock exchanges) was fragmented and obscure. The report called for the
automation of the OTC market and gave the responsibility for implementing
that system to the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD). NASD
began construction of the NASDAQ system in 1968, and its first trades were
made beginning February 8, 1971, when NASDAQ became the world’s first
electronic stock market.
Market makers
Unlike the specialist structure of the NYSE, in which one specialist represents
a particular stock, NASDAQ market makers compete with each other to buy
and sell the stocks they choose to represent. More than 500 member firms
act as market makers for NASDAQ. Each uses its own capital, research, and
system resources to represent a stock and compete with other market makers.
Market makers compete for customers’ orders by displaying buy and sell
quotations on an electronic exchange for a guaranteed number of shares at a
specific price. After market makers receive orders, they immediately pur-
chase or sell stock from their own inventories or seek out the other side of
the trades so they can be executed, usually in a matter of seconds. The four
types of market makers are
 Retail market makers: They serve institutional and individual investors
through brokerage networks that provide a continuous flow of orders
and sales opportunities.
 Wholesale market makers: They serve primarily institutional clients and
other brokers or dealers who aren’t registered market makers in a par-
ticular company’s stock but need to execute orders for their customers.
 Institutional market makers: They execute large block orders for insti-
tutional investors, such as pension funds, mutual funds, insurance com-
panies, and asset management companies.
 Regional market makers: They serve companies and individuals of a
particular region. By focusing regionally, these market makers offer their
customers more extensive coverage of the stocks and investors in a
particular area of the country.
30
Book I: Investment Basics 

NASDAQ listing requirements
To be listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange, a company must meet certain
financial and liquidity standards. The financial requirements relate to pre-tax
earnings, cash flows, market capitalization, revenue, bid price, the number of
market makers, and corporate governance standards. The liquidity require-
ments involve the number of beneficial shareholders, the average monthly
trading volume over the past 12 months, and the market value of publicly
held shares and shareholder equity.
Over-the-counter and bulletin-board stocks
Stocks that do not meet the minimum requirements to be listed on NASDAQ
are traded as over-the-counter or bulletin-board stocks (OTCBB). The OTCBB
is a regulated quotation service that displays real-time quotes, last-sale
prices, and volume information for the stocks traded OTCBB. These stocks
generally don’t meet the listing qualifications for NASDAQ or other national
securities exchanges, and fewer than two (and sometimes even no) market
makers trade in these stocks, making buying and selling them more difficult.
The SOES system
NASDAQ’s Small Order Execution (market) System (SOES) was introduced in
1985 and became mandatory for all market makers after the 1987 stock
market crash. Small traders using this system can execute trades directly
without worry or fear of market-maker misconduct. Available stocks are
posted on an electronic bulletin board and trades are executed electronically.
All market makers list the stocks they have available for sale with their bid
price (the current price at which the market maker will buy) and ask price
(the current price at which the market maker will sell). Traders pick the
bid/ask price that looks best and execute their trades in a matter of seconds
using the SOES system.
Regional exchanges
Stock exchanges that focus on listing stocks of corporations from specific
geographic regions of the country are called regional exchanges. In the United
States, the major regional exchanges include Boston, Chicago, Pacific, and
Philadelphia stock exchanges. These regional markets are smaller than the
NYSE, NASDAQ, and Amex. Although they list mostly regional stocks not on
the national exchanges, regional exchanges sometimes list stocks of companies
located in their regions even if they’re listed on one of the national exchanges.
Each regional exchange offers its own unique blend of services. Boston
serves a financial community where trillions of dollars that are invested in
mutual funds are managed, so that exchange focuses on serving those
31
Chapter 2: Indexes and Exchanges
Book I
Investment
Basics

clients. Chicago trades stocks listed regionally but also trades stocks from
other exchanges, including the NYSE, Amex, and NASDAQ, so it also serves
the needs of its regional financial institutions.
The Pacific Exchange focuses on buying and selling options, and thus is
known as one of the world’s leading derivatives markets. The Philadelphia
Stock Exchange focuses on trading options of various sectors including oil
service, precious metals (gold and silver), semiconductors, banks, and utilities.
The exchange also manages a market structure for trading currency options.
Electronic communications 
networks (ECNs)
A new system of electronic trading that is developing is called the electronic
communications network (ECN). The SEC reports that about 30 percent of the
total share volume in NASDAQ-listed securities and 40 percent of the dollar
volume is traded using ECNs. Likewise, about 96 percent of the trades on
ECNs are shares of NASDAQ-listed stocks.
ECNs enable buyers and sellers to meet electronically to execute trades. The
trades are entered into the ECN systems by market makers at one of the
exchanges or by an OTC market maker. Transactions are completed without a
broker-dealer, saving users the cost of commissions normally charged for
more traditional forms of trading.
Subscribers to ECNs include retail investors, institutional investors, market
makers, and broker-dealers. ECNs are accessed through a custom terminal or
by direct Internet dial-up. Orders are posted by the ECN for subscribers to
view. The ECN then matches orders for execution. In most cases, buyers and
sellers maintain their anonymity and do not list identifiable information in
their buy or sell orders.
More than a dozen ECNs operate in the U.S. securities markets, including
Archipelago Exchange, Brut, Instinet, Island, and SelectNet.

E
very month, it seems, Wall Street comes up with some
newfangled investment idea. The array of ﬁnancial
products (replete with 164-page prospectuses) is now so
dizzying that the old lumpy mattress is starting to look
like a more comfortable place to stash the cash. As a high-
end investor, you’re more capable than most of weeding
through all the promises and potential and ﬁguring out
what’s real (and what isn’t) and what belongs in your
portfolio (and what doesn’t).
But sometimes you need to take a step back to realize that
you don’t always need newfangled investment ideas to
create a smart portfolio –– one that’s diversiﬁed enough
to offer some protection from risk. That’s where tradi-
tional investment vehicles, like stocks and bonds, can
come into play.

Chapter 1
Playing the Market: Stocks
In This Chapter
 Getting some stock basics
 Making sense of stock tables
 Investing in stocks for growth or income
T
he stock market is a centerpiece of the U.S. financial scene. Stocks are
one of the most traditional investment vehicles — one that many
Americans are familiar with. But just because stocks are familiar doesn’t
mean you don’t have to make an effort to understand them. Successfully
investing in stocks requires a realistic approach and quite a bit of know-how.
This chapter gives you an overview.
Starting with the Basics
Stocks represent ownership in companies, and stock markets are the places
where stocks are bought and sold. Those places may be made of bricks and
mortar, like the New York Stock Exchange, or they may be computer networks,
like the NASDAQ. In years past, when someone bought stock in a company, he
would receive a physical certificate that proved how many shares he owned.
These days, if you buy stock in a company, you don’t get a pretty piece of
paper to prove it; you generally get electronic confirmation of the trade.
Connecting economics to the stock market
While no one is asking you to understand “the inelasticity of demand aggre-
gates” or “marginal utility,” having a working knowledge of basic economics
is crucial (and I mean crucial) to your success as a stock investor. The stock
market and the economy are joined at the hip. The good or bad things that
happen to one have a direct effect on the other.

Understanding basic economics can help you filter financial news to separate
relevant information from the irrelevant in order to make better investment
decisions. Here are a few important economic concepts to be aware of:
 Supply and demand: Supply and demand can be simply stated as the
relationship between what’s available (the supply) and what people
want and are willing to pay for (the demand). This equation is the main
engine of economic activity and is extremely important for your stock
investing analysis and decision-making process.
 Cause and effect: Considering cause and effect is an exercise in logical
thinking. If you were to pick up a prominent news report and read,
“Companies in the table industry are expecting plummeting sales,”
would you rush out and invest in companies that sell chairs or manufac-
ture tablecloths? When you read business news, play it out in your mind.
What good (or bad) can logically be expected given a certain event or
situation?
 Economic effects from government actions: Nothing has a greater
effect — good or bad — on investing and economics than government,
which controls the money supply, credit, and all public securities markets.
Government actions usually manifest themselves as taxes, laws, or regu-
lations. They also can take on a more ominous appearance, such as war
or the threat of war. A single government action can have a far-reaching
effect that can have a direct or indirect economic impact on your stock
investments.
Reading stock tables
The stock tables in major business publications, such as The Wall Street Journal
and Investor’s Business Daily, are loaded with information that can help you
become a savvy investor. You use this information not only to select promising
investment opportunities but also to monitor your stocks’ performance.
Table 1-1 shows a sample stock table for you to refer to as you read the sec-
tions that follow. Each item gives you some clues about the current state of
affairs for a particular company.

Here’s what each column means:
 52-week high: This column gives you the highest price that particular
stock has reached in the most recent 52-week period. This is important
info if you want to gauge where the stock is now versus where it has
been recently.
 52-week low: This column gives you the lowest price that particular
stock has reached in the most recent 52-week period. Again, this infor-
mation is crucial to your ability to analyze stocks over a period of time.
The high and low prices just give you a range for how far that particular
stock’s price has moved, up or down, within the past 52 weeks.
Interesting information, but to understand what it means or how (or
whether) you should act on it, you need to get more information.
 Name and symbol: This column tells you the company name (usually
abbreviated) and the stock symbol assigned to it. When you have your
eye on a stock for potential purchase, get familiar with its symbol.
Financial tables list stocks in alphabetical order by symbol, and you
need to use them in all stock communications, from getting a stock
quote at your broker’s office to buying stock over the Internet.
 Dividend: A value in this column indicates that payments have been
made to stockholders. The amount you see is the annual dividend
quoted as if you owned one share of that stock. If you look at LowDownInc
(LDI) in Table 1-1, you can see that you would get $2.35 as an annual
dividend for each share of stock that you own.

 Volume: This column tells you how many shares of that particular stock
were traded that day. If only 100 shares are traded in a day, the trading
volume is 100.
You can’t necessarily compare one stock’s volume against that of any
other company. The large cap stocks like IBM or Microsoft typically have
trading volumes in the millions of shares almost every day, while less
active, smaller stocks may have average trading volumes in far, far smaller
numbers. The key thing to remember is that trading volume that’s far in
excess (either positively or negatively) of the stock’s normal range is a
sign that something is going on with that stock. Be sure to check out what’s
happening when you hear about heavier than usual volume (especially if
you already own the stock).
 Yield: This column refers to what percentage that particular dividend is
to the stock price. Yield, which is most important to income investors, is
calculated by dividing the annual dividend by the current stock price.
Yield reported in the financial pages changes daily as the stock price
changes and is always reported as if you’re buying the stock that day.
 P/E: This column indicates the ratio between the price of the stock and
the company’s earnings. This ratio (also called the earnings multiple or
just multiple) is frequently used to determine whether a stock is a good
value. Value investors (see Book VII) find P/E ratios to be essential to
analyzing a stock as a potential investment.
In the P/E ratios reported in stock tables, price refers to the cost of a
single share of stock. Earnings refers to the company’s reported earnings
as of the most recent four quarters.
 Day last: This column tells you how trading ended for a particular stock
on the day represented by the table. Some newspapers report the high
and low for that day in addition to the stock’s ending price.
 Net change: This column answers the question “How did the stock price
end today compared with its trading price at the end of the prior 
trading day?”
Investing for Growth
Obviously, not all stocks perform the same way. If they did, investing in the
stock market would be pretty dull. Instead, certain types of stocks tend to be
more risky than others. And, as a rule, those that carry more risk also tend to
carry more potential for growth. In this section, I focus on those stocks that
fall into the higher risk/return category. In the next section, I turn the focus to
those stocks that tend to involve lower risk, lower return, and a different set
of pros and cons than growth stocks.

Choosing growth stocks
A stock is considered a growth stock when it’s growing faster and higher than
stocks of other companies with similar sales and earnings figures. I say higher
than stocks of other companies because you have to measure growth against
something. Usually, you compare the growth of a company with growth from
other companies in the same industry or compare it with the stock market in
general. In practical terms, when you measure the growth of a stock against
the stock market, you’re actually comparing it against a generally accepted
benchmark, such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) or the Standard
& Poor’s 500 (S&P 500). For more on the DJIA or S&P 500, see Book I.

A lesson from the late ’90s
Because most investors ignored some basic
observations about economics in the late 1990s,
they lost trillions in their stock portfolios. In the
late 1990s, the United States experienced the
greatest expansion of debt in history, coupled
with a record expansion of the money supply.
(Both are controlled by the Federal Reserve, the
U.S. government central bank referred to as the
Fed.) This growth of debt and money supply
resulted in more consumer (and corporate) bor-
rowing, spending, and investing. This activity
hyperstimulated the stock market and caused
stocks to rise 25 percent per year for five
straight years. Sounds great, but such a return
can’t be sustained and encourages speculation.
This artificial stimulation by the Fed resulted in
more and more people depleting their savings,
buying on credit (it’s cheap — why not?), and
borrowing against their homes. All this spending
(on big ticket discretionary items, vacations, and
so on) prompted businesses to expand (by bor-
rowing money, of course, or by going public). But
such high-level spending can’t go on forever.
When the inevitable slowdown came, compa-
nies were caught in a financial bind. Too much
debt and too many expenses in a slowing econ-
omy mean one thing: Profits shrink or disappear.
To stay in business, companies cut expenses,
and the biggest expense in a company is pay-
roll. So companies started laying off employees.
And when you don’t have a job — or are afraid
of losing one — and you have little in the way of
savings and too much in the way of debt, you
start selling your stock to pay the bills. This was
a major reason that stocks started to fall in 2000.
Earnings started to drop because of shrinking
sales from a sputtering economy. As earnings
fell, stock prices also fell.
The lessons from the 1990s are important ones
for investors today:
 Stocks aren’t a replacement for savings
accounts. Always have some money in the
bank.
 Stocks should never occupy 100 percent of
your investment funds.
 When anyone (including an “expert”) tells
you that the economy will keep growing
indefinitely, be skeptical and read diverse
sources of information.
 If stocks do well in your portfolio, consider
protecting your stocks (both your original
investment and any gains) with stop-loss
orders.
 Keep debt and expenses to a minimum.
 Remember that if the economy is booming, a
decline is sure to follow as the ebb and flow
of the economy’s business cycle continues.

If a company has earnings growth of 15 percent per year over three years or
more and the industry’s average growth rate over the same time frame is 10
percent, then this stock qualifies as a growth stock. A growth stock is called
that not only because the company is growing but also because the company
is performing well with some consistency. Just because your earnings did
great versus the S&P 500’s average in a single year doesn’t cut it. Growth
must be consistently accomplished.
Although comparison is a valuable tool for evaluating a stock’s potential, you
don’t want to pick growth stocks on the basis of comparison alone. You
should also scrutinize the stock to make sure that it has other things going
for it to improve your chance of success, as the following sections explain.
When choosing growth stocks, invest in a company only if it makes a profit
and only if you understand how it makes that profit. You need to know such
information so that you can monitor the industry and more accurately predict
whether the company you choose to invest in will continue to make money
based on the likelihood that its customers, in turn, will be making money.
Checking out a company’s fundamentals
When you hear the word fundamentals in the world of stock investing, it
refers to the company’s financial condition and related data. When investors
do fundamental analysis, they look at the company’s fundamentals: its bal-
ance sheet, income statement, cash flow, and other operational data, along
with external factors such as the company’s market position, industry, and
economic prospects. Essentially, the fundamentals should indicate to you
that the company is in strong financial condition: It has consistently solid
earnings, low debt, and a commanding position in the marketplace.
Deciding whether a company is a good value
You already know that a growth stock is the stock of a company that is per-
forming better than its peers in categories such as sales and earnings. Value
stocks are stocks that are priced lower than the value of the company and its
assets. You can identify a value stock by analyzing the company’s fundamentals
and looking at some key financial ratios, such as the price-to-earnings ratio. If
the stock’s price is lower than the company’s fundamentals indicate it should
be (in other words, it’s undervalued), then it’s a good buy — a bargain — and
the stock is considered a great value. For more on value investing, see Book VII.
Looking for leaders and megatrends
What’s the current megatrend, and how does the company you’re investigat-
ing fit into it? A megatrend is a major development that has huge implications
for most (if not all) of society and for a long time to come. A good example of
a megatrend is the aging of America. Federal government studies tell us that
senior citizens will be the fastest-growing segment of our population during
40
Book II: Basic Investments: Stocks, Bonds, Mutual Funds, and More 

the next 20 years. How does the stock investor take advantage of a mega-
trend? By identifying a company that’s poised to address the opportunities
that such trends reveal. A strong company in a growing industry is a common
recipe for success.
Considering a company with a strong niche
Companies that have established a strong niche are consistently profitable.
Look for a company with one or more of the following characteristics:
 A strong brand: Companies that have a positive, familiar identity —
such as Coca-Cola and Microsoft — occupy a niche that keeps customers
loyal. Other companies have to struggle to overcome that loyalty if they
want a share of the market.
 High barriers to entry: United Parcel Service and Federal Express have
set up tremendous distribution and delivery networks that competitors
can’t easily duplicate. High barriers to entry offer an important edge to
companies that are already established.
 Research & development (R&D): Companies such as Pfizer and Merck
spend a lot of money researching and developing new pharmaceutical
products. This investment becomes a new product with millions of con-
sumers who become loyal purchasers, so the company’s going to grow.
Noticing who’s buying and/or recommending the stock
You can invest in a great company and still see its stock go nowhere. Why?
Because what makes the stock go up is demand — there need to be more
buyers than sellers of the stock. If you pick a stock for all the right reasons
and the market notices the stock as well, that attention will cause the stock
price to climb. The things to watch for include the following:
 Institutional buying: Are mutual funds and pension plans buying up the
stock you’re looking at? If so, this type of buying power will exert
tremendous upward pressure on the stock’s price.
 Analysts’ attention: Are analysts talking about the stock on the financial
shows? As much as you should be skeptical about an analyst’s recom-
mendation, it offers some positive reinforcement for your stock. A single
recommendation by an influential analyst can be enough to send a stock
skyward.
 Newsletter recommendations: Newsletters are usually published by
independent researchers (or so we hope). If influential newsletters are
touting your choice, that praise is also good for your stock.
 Consumer publications: Publications such as Consumer Reports regularly
look at products and services and rate them for consumer satisfaction. If
a company’s offerings are well received by consumers, that’s a strong
positive for the company. This kind of attention will ultimately have 
a positive effect on that company’s stock.

Exploring small caps
Everyone wants to get in early on a hot new stock. Who wouldn’t want to buy
a stock that could become the next IBM or Microsoft? This is why investors
are attracted to small cap stocks.
Small cap (or small capitalization) is a reference to the company’s market
size. Small cap stocks are stocks from companies that have market capitaliza-
tion (the number of shares outstanding multiplied by the price per share) of
under $1 billion. Investors may face more risk with small caps, but they also
have the chance for greater gains.
Out of all the types of stocks, small cap stocks continue to exhibit the great-
est amount of growth. In the same way that a tree planted last year will have
more opportunity for growth than a mature 100-year-old redwood, small caps
have greater growth potential than established large cap stocks. Of course, a
small cap will not exhibit spectacular growth just because it’s small. It will
grow when it does the right things, such as increasing sales and earnings by
producing goods and services that customers want. As you consider small
caps, keep these things in mind:
 An IPO is not a sure thing. An initial public offerings (IPO) is the first
offering to the public of a company’s stock. The IPO is also referred to as
“going public.” Because a company that is going public is frequently an
unproven enterprise, investing in an IPO can be risky.
 If it’s a small cap stock, make sure it’s making money. When you evalu-
ate a company for stock investing, make sure that the company is estab-
lished (being in business for at least three years is a good minimum) and
that it’s profitable. These rules are especially important for investors in
small stocks. Plenty of start-up ventures lose money but hope to make a
fortune down the road. A good example is a company in the biotechnology
industry. Biotech is an exciting area, but it’s esoteric, and at this early
stage, companies are finding it difficult to use the technology in prof-
itable ways. You may say, “But shouldn’t I jump in now in anticipation of
future profits?” You may get lucky, but understand that when you invest
in small cap stocks, you’re speculating.
 Investing in small cap stocks requires analysis. You need to do more
research on small cap stocks than on large caps. Plenty of information is
available on large cap stocks because they’re widely followed. Small cap
stocks don’t get as much press, and fewer analysts issue reports on them.

Investing for Income
Investing for income means investing in stocks that will provide you with reg-
ular money payments (dividends). Income stocks may not offer stellar
growth, but they’re good for a steady infusion of money. What type of person
is best suited to income stocks? Income stocks can be appropriate for many
investors, but they are especially well suited for the following individuals:
 Conservative and novice investors: These investors like to see a slow-
but-steady approach to growing their money while getting regular divi-
dend checks. Novice investors who want to start slowly also benefit
from income stocks.
 Retirees: Growth investing is best suited for long-term needs, while
income investing is best suited to current needs. Retirees may want
some growth in their portfolios, but they’re more concerned with regular
income that can keep pace with inflation.
 Dividend reinvestment plan (DRP) investors: A DRP is a program that a
company may offer to allow investors to accumulate more shares of its
stock without paying commissions. For those who like to compound
their money with DRPs, income stocks are perfect.
If you have a low tolerance for risk or if your investment goal is anything less
than long term, income stocks are your best bet.
Analyzing income stocks
When we talk about gaining income from stocks, we’re usually talking about
dividends. A dividend is nothing more than money paid out to the owner of a
stock. A good income stock is a stock that has a higher-than-average dividend
(typically 4 percent or higher) and is purchased primarily for income — not
for spectacular growth potential.
A dividend is quoted as an annual number but is usually paid on a quarterly,
pro-rata basis. In other words, if the stock is paying a dividend of $4, you
would probably be paid $1 every quarter. If, in this example, you had 200
shares, you would be paid $800 every year (if the dividend isn’t changed
during that period), or $200 per quarter. Getting that regular dividend check
every three months for as long as you hold the stock can be a nice perk.
Dividend rates are not guaranteed; they can go up or down or, in some extreme
cases, the dividend can be discontinued. Fortunately, most companies that
issue dividends continue them indefinitely and actually increase dividend
payments from time to time. Historically, dividend increases have equaled or
exceeded the rate of inflation.

Look at income stocks in the same way that you do growth stocks when
assessing the financial strength of a company. Getting a nice dividend can
come to a screeching halt if the company can’t afford to pay them. If your
budget depends on dividend income, then monitoring the company’s finan-
cial strength is that much more important.
Considering yield
The main thing to look for in choosing income stocks is yield: the percentage
rate of return paid on a stock in the form of dividends. Looking at a stock’s
dividend yield is the quickest way to find out how much money you’ll earn
from a particular income stock versus other dividend-paying stocks (or even
other investments, such as a bank account). Dividend yield is calculated in
the following way:
Dividend yield = dividend income ÷ stock investment
When you see a stock listed in the financial pages, the dividend yield is pro-
vided along with the stock’s price and annual dividend. The dividend yield in
the financial pages is always calculated as if you bought the stock on that
given day.
Based on supply and demand, stock prices change every day (almost every
minute!) that the market’s open. If the stock price changes every day, the
yield changes as well. Take a look at Table 1-2. If you bought stock in Smith
Co. a month ago at $20 per share with an annual dividend of $1, your yield is
5 percent. But if Smith Co. is selling for $40 per share today, the yield quoted
would be 2.5 percent. Did the dividend get cut in half?! Not really. You’re still
getting 5 percent because you bought the stock at $20 instead of the current
$40; the quoted yield is for investors who purchase Smith Co. today. Investors
who buy Smith Co. stock today would pay $40 and get the $1 dividend; the
yield has changed to 2.5 percent, which is the yield that they lock into. So,
while Smith Co. may have been a good income investment for you a month
ago, it’s not such a hot pick today because the price of the stock doubled,
cutting the yield in half. Even though the dividend hasn’t changed, the yield
has changed dramatically because of the stock price change.

You can’t stop scrutinizing income stocks after you acquire them. You may
have made a great choice that gives you a great dividend, but that doesn’t
mean it will be that way indefinitely. Monitor the company’s progress for as
long as it is in your portfolio. Use resources such as www.bloomberg.com and
www.marketwatch.com to track your stock and to monitor how well that par-
ticular company is continuing to perform.
Checking the payout ratio
The payout ratio is simply a way to figure out what percentage of the com-
pany’s earnings are being paid out in the form of dividends. People con-
cerned about the safety of their dividend income should regularly watch the
payout ratio. Generally, a dividend payout ratio of 60 percent or less is safe.
Obviously, the lower the percentage is, the safer the dividend.
Say that the company Urn More Corp. (UMC) has annual earnings of $1 mil-
lion dollars. Total dividends of $500,000 are to be paid out, and the company
has 1 million outstanding shares. Using those numbers, you know that UMC
has earnings per share (EPS) of $1.00 ($1 million in earnings divided by 1 mil-
lion shares) and that it pays an annual dividend of 50 cents per share
($500,000 divided by 1 million shares). The dividend payout ratio is 50 per-
cent (the 50 cents dividend is 50 percent of the $1.00 EPS). This is a healthy
dividend payout ratio because even if the company’s earnings were to fall by
10 percent or 20 percent, it would still have plenty of room to pay dividends.
Keep in mind that a company’s earnings aren’t necessarily cash. Looking at
cash flow from operations versus earnings is another way to measure divi-
dend safety.

Examining a company’s bond rating
A company’s bond rating is very important to income stock investors. The
bond rating offers insight into the company’s financial strength. Bonds get
rated for quality for the same reasons that consumer agencies rate products
such as cars or toasters. Standard & Poor’s (S&P) is the major independent
rating agency that looks into bond issuers. It looks at the issuer of a bond and
asks the question “Does the bond issuer have the financial strength to pay
back the bond and the interest as stipulated in the bond indenture?”
If the bond rating is good, the company is strong enough to pay its obliga-
tions, which include expenses, payments on debts, and dividends. If a bond
rating agency gives the company a high rating (or if it raises the rating),
that’s a great sign for anyone holding the company’s debt or receiving divi-
dends. Conversely, a lowered rating indicates the company’s financial health
is deteriorating, while a bad bond rating means the company is having diffi-
culty paying its obligations.
The highest rating issued by S&P is AAA. The grades AAA, AA, and A are con-
sidered “investment grade” or of high quality. Bs and Cs indicate a poor
grade, while anything lower than that is considered very risky (the bonds are
referred to as junk bonds).
Looking at typical income stocks
Income stocks tend to be in established industries with established cash
flows and less emphasis on financing or creating new products and services.
When you’re ready to start your search for a great income stock, start look-
ing at utilities and real estate trusts — two established industries with
proven track records — for high-dividend stocks.
You won’t find too many dividend-paying income stocks in the computer or
biotech industry; odds are you won’t even find one! The reason is that these
types of companies need a lot of money to finance expensive research and
development (R&D) projects to create new products. Without R&D, the
company can’t create new products to fuel sales, growth, and future earnings.
Computer, biotech, and other innovative industries are better for growth
investors.
Utilities
Utilities generate a large cash flow, which includes money from income (sales
of products and/or services) and other items (such as the selling of equipment,
for example). This cash flow is needed to cover things such as expenses,
including dividends. Utilities are considered the most common type of
46
Book II: Basic Investments: Stocks, Bonds, Mutual Funds, and More 

income stocks, and many investors have at least one in their portfolios.
Investing in your own local utility isn’t a bad idea. At least you know that
when you pay your energy bill, you’re helping out at least one investor.
Real estate investment trusts (REITs)
Real estate investment trusts (REITs) are a special breed of stock. A REIT is
an investment that has the elements of both a stock and a mutual fund (a pool
of money received from investors that is managed by an investment company).
It’s like a stock in that it’s a company whose stock is publicly traded on the major
stock exchanges, and it has the usual features that you expect from a stock — it
can be bought and sold easily through a broker, income is given to investors
as dividends, and so on. A REIT resembles a mutual fund in that it doesn’t make
its money selling goods and services; it makes its money by buying, selling, and
managing an investment portfolio — in the case of a REIT, the portfolio is full
of real estate investments. It generates revenue from rents and property leases
as any landlord would. In addition, some REITs own mortgages, and they gain
income from the interest.
REITs are called trusts only because they meet the requirements of the Real
Estate Investment Trust Act of 1960. This act exempts REITs from corporate
income tax and capital gains taxes as long as they meet certain criteria, such
as dispensing 95 percent of their net income to shareholders. There are other
criteria, but this is the one that interests income investors. This provision is
the reason REITs generally issue generous dividends. Beyond this status,
REITs are, in a practical sense, like any other publicly traded company.

onds are investments for people who prefer predictability to volatility
and income to capital gains. They’re the sweethearts that may have
saved your grandparents from selling apples on the street during the hungry
1930s. They are the babies that may have saved your 401(k) from devastation
during the three growly bear-market years on Wall Street that started this
century. Bonds belong in nearly every portfolio. Whether they belong in your
portfolio is something this chapter helps you decide.
Getting Your Bond Basics
Just what are bonds? The word bond basically means an IOU. When you buy 
a bond, you’re lending your money to Uncle Sam, to General Electric, to
Procter & Gamble, to the city in which you live — to whatever entity issues
the bonds — and that entity promises to pay you a certain rate of interest in
exchange for borrowing your money. Bond investing is very different from
stock investing, where you purchase shares in a company, become an alleged
partial owner of that company, and then pray that the company churns a
profit and the CEO doesn’t pocket it all.
By and large, bonds’ most salient characteristic — and the one thing that
most, but not all bonds share — is a certain stability and steadiness well
above and beyond that of most other investments. Because you are, in most
cases, receiving a steady stream of income, and because you expect to get
your principal back in one piece, bonds tend to be more conservative invest-
ments than, say, stocks, commodities, or collectibles.

Some key things to know about bonds:
 A bond is always issued with a certain face amount (also called the
principal or the par value of the bond). Most often, bonds are issued
with face amounts of $1,000. So in order to raise $50 million, the entity
issuing the bonds would have to issue 50,000 of them, each selling at
$1,000 par.
 After a bond is issued, it may sell on the secondary market for more or
less than its face amount. If it sells for more than its face amount, the
bond is said to sell at a premium. If it sells for less than its face amount,
the bond is said to sell at a discount. Many factors determine the price of
a bond in the secondary market.
 Every bond pays a certain rate of interest, and typically (but not always)
that rate is fixed over the life of the bond (that’s why some people call
bonds fixed-income securities). The life of the bond is known as the
bond’s maturity. The rate of interest is a percentage of the face amount
and is typically paid out twice a year. For example, if a corporation or
government issues a $1,000 bond paying 6 percent, that corporation or
government promises to fork over to the bondholder $60 a year — or, in
most cases, $30 twice a year. Then, when the bond matures, the corpora-
tion or government gives the bondholder the original $1,000 back.
 In some cases, you can buy a bond directly from the issuer and sell it
back directly to the issuer, but in most cases, bonds are bought and sold
through a brokerage house or a bank. Oh, yes, these brokerage houses
take a piece of the pie, sometimes a quite sizeable piece. For information
on choosing brokers, refer to Book I.
 The issuance of bonds is regulated by the Securities and Exchange
Commission (and other regulatory authorities). Again, you can find
information on the SEC and other regulatory agencies in Book I.
Maturity choices
Almost all bonds these days are issued with life spans (maturities) of up to 30
years. Any bond with a maturity of less than five years is called a short bond.
Bonds with maturities of 5 to 12 years are called intermediate bonds. Bonds
with maturities of 12 years or more are called long bonds.
In general, the longer the maturity, the greater the interest rate paid. That’s
because bond buyers generally demand more compensation the longer they
agree to tie up their money. At the same time, bond issuers are willing to fork
over more interest in return for the privilege of holding onto your money longer.
The difference between the rates you can get on short bonds versus interme-
diate bonds versus long bonds is known as the yield curve. Yield simply refers
to the annual interest rate.
50
Book II: Basic Investments: Stocks, Bonds, Mutual Funds, and More 

Investment-grade or junk-grade bonds
When choosing a bond, you may think that the bonds that offer the best
interest rates are the best investments. But that’s not necessarily the case.
When it comes to bonds, a higher rate of interest isn’t always the best deal.
Why? Because when you fork your money over to buy a bond, your principal
is guaranteed only by the issuer of the bond, which means that it’s only as
solid as the issuer itself.
Bond issuers with the shakiest reputations pay higher interest rates. If you
had to decide between U.S. Treasury bonds (guaranteed by the U.S. govern-
ment), General Electric bonds, and General Motors bonds, you’d expect that
you’d get the highest rate of interest from General Motors because it’s cur-
rently on shaky footing. Lending your money to GM involves more risk than
lending it to either of the other two. If GM were to go bankrupt, you might
lose a good chunk of your principal. That risk requires GM to pay a higher
rate of interest. Without paying some kind of risk premium, the manufacturer
of gas-guzzling cars simply would not be able to attract any people to lend it
money to make more gas-guzzling cars. Conversely, the U.S. government,
which has the power to levy taxes and print money, is not going bankrupt any
time soon. Therefore, U.S. Treasury bonds, which are said to carry no risk of
default, tend to pay relatively modest interest rates.
Bonds that carry a relatively high risk of default are commonly called high-yield
or junk bonds. Bonds issued by solid companies and governments that carry
very little risk of default are commonly referred to as investment-grade bonds.
The major creators of bonds
Every year, millions — yes, literally millions — of bonds are issued by thou-
sands of different governments, government agencies, municipalities, finan-
cial institutions, and corporations. The following list gives an overview of
things to consider about each major kind of bond.
 U.S. Treasury: Politicians like raising money by selling bonds, as
opposed to raising taxes, because voters hate taxes. Of course, when the
government issues bonds, it promises to repay the bond buyers over
time. The more bonds the government issues, the greater its debt.
Voters don’t seem to care much about debt. In the later section “‘Risk-
free’ Investing: U.S Treasury Bonds,” you can read about the many kinds
of Treasury bonds.
 Agencies: Federal agencies such as Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corporation (Freddie Mac) and Federal National Mortgage Association
(Fannie Mae) issue a good chunk of the bonds on the market. Such agencies
aren’t quite government and aren’t quite private concerns. They are
government “sponsored” and, in theory, Congress and the Treasury

would serve as protective big brothers if one of these agencies were to
take a financial beating and couldn’t pay off its debt obligations. You can
find out about these types of bonds in the later section “Lots of
Protection: Agency Bonds.”
 Corporate bonds: Bonds issued by for-profit companies are riskier than
government bonds but tend to compensate for that added risk by paying
higher rates of interest. In recent history, corporate bonds in the aggre-
gate have tended to pay about a percentage point higher than Treasuries
of similar maturity. Find out about the corporate bond world in the sec-
tion “Industrial Returns: Corporate Bonds.”
 Municipalities: Municipal bonds (munis) issued by cities, states, and
counties are used to raise money either for general day-to-day needs of
the citizenry (schools, roads, sewer systems) or for specific projects (a
new bridge, a sports stadium). The section “(Almost) Tax-free Havens:
Municipal Bonds” offers basic information on municipal bonds.
Individual bonds vs. bond funds
One of the big questions about bond investing is whether to invest in individ-
ual bonds or bond funds. I’m a big advocate of bond funds — both bond
mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. Mutual funds and exchange-traded
funds both represent baskets of securities (usually stocks or bonds, or both)
and allow for instant and easy portfolio diversification.
Here’s a very broad overview of the pros and cons of owning individual
bonds versus bond funds.
Individual bonds
Individual bonds offer you the opportunity to really fine-tune a fixed-income
portfolio. With individual bonds, you can choose exactly what you want in terms
of bond quality, maturity, and taxability. For larger investors — especially those
doing their homework — investing in individual bonds may also be more
economical than investing in a bond fund. That’s especially true for those
investors up on the latest advances in bond buying and selling.
Bond funds
Investors now have a choice of more than 5,000 bond mutual funds or
exchange-traded funds. All have the same basic drawback: management
expenses. But even so, some make for very good potential investments, par-
ticularly for people with modest portfolios.
52
Book II: Basic Investments: Stocks, Bonds, Mutual Funds, and More 

I’m a strong proponent of buying index funds — mutual funds or exchange-
traded funds that seek to provide exposure to an entire asset class (such as
bonds or stocks) with very little trading and very low expenses. I believe that
such funds are the way to go for most investors to get the bond exposure
they need.
Various types of yield
Yield is what you want in a bond. Yield is income. Yield contributes to return.
Yield is confusion! People (and that includes overly eager bond salespeople)
often misuse the term or use it inappropriately to gain an advantage in the
bond market. Don’t be a yield sucker! Understand what kind of yield is being
promised on a bond or bond fund, and know what it really means.
Coupon yield
The coupon yield, or the coupon rate, is part of the bond offering. A $1,000
bond with a coupon yield of 5 percent is going to pay $50 a year. A $1,000
bond with a coupon yield of 7 percent is going to pay $70 a year. Usually, the
$50 or $70 or whatever will be paid out twice a year on an individual bond.
Bond funds don’t really have coupon yields, although they have an average
coupon yield for all the bonds in the pool. That average tells you something,
for sure, but you need to remember that a bond fund may start the year and
end the year with a completely different set of bonds — and a completely dif-
ferent average coupon yield.
Current yield
Current yield is derived by taking the bond’s coupon yield and dividing it by
the bond’s price. Suppose you had a $1,000 face value bond with a coupon
rate of 5 percent, which would equate to $50 a year in your pocket. If the
bond sells today for 98 (meaning that it is selling at a discount for $980), the
current yield is $50 divided by $980 = 5.10 percent. If that same bond rises in
price to a premium of 103 (meaning it’s selling for $1,030), the current yield is
$50 divided by $1,030 = 4.85 percent.
The current yield is a sort of snapshot that gives you a very rough (and possibly
entirely inaccurate) estimate of the return you can expect on that bond over
the coming months. If you take today’s current yield (translated into nickels
and dimes) and multiply that amount by 30, you’d think that would give you a
good estimate of how much income your bond will generate in the next month,
but that’s not the case. The current yield changes too quickly for that kind of
prediction to hold true. The equivalent would be taking a measure of today’s
rainfall, multiplying it by 30, and using that number to estimate rainfall for the
month. (Well, the current yield would be a bit more accurate, but you get 
the point.)

Yield-to-maturity
A much more accurate measure of return, although still far from perfect, is
the yield-to-maturity. Yield-to-maturity factors in not only the coupon rate and
the price you paid for the bond, but also how far you have to go to get your
principal back, and how much that principal will be.
Yield-to-maturity calculations make a big assumption that may or may not
prove true: They assume that as you collect your interest payments every six
months, you reinvest them at the same interest rate you’re getting on the
bond. To calculate the yield-to-maturity, you’d either need to use a terribly
long formula with all kinds of horrible Greek symbols and lots of multiplica-
tion and division, or (thank goodness) you can use a financial calculator. (I
like the calculator on MoneyChimp.com, a great financial Web site that fea-
tures all sorts of cool calculators.) You put in the par (face) value of the bond
(almost always $1,000), the price you are considering paying for the bond,
the number of years to maturity, and the coupon rate, and press “calculate.”
Unscrupulous bond brokers have been known to tout current yield, and only
current yield, when selling especially premium-priced bonds. The current
yield may look great, but you’ll take a hit when the bond matures by collect-
ing less in principal than you paid for the bond. Your yield-to-maturity, which
matters more than current yield, may, in fact, stink.
Yield-to-call
If you buy a callable bond, the company or municipality that issues your
bond can ask for it back, at a specific price, long before the bond matures.
Premium bonds, because they carry higher-than-average coupon yields, are
often called. What that means is that your yield-to-maturity is pretty much a
moot point. What you’re likely to see in the way of yield is yield-to-call. It’s fig-
ured out the same way that you figure out yield-to-maturity (use MoneyChimp.
com if you don’t have a financial calculator), but the end result — your actual
return — may be considerably lower.
Keep in mind that bonds are generally called when market interest rates have
fallen. In that case, not only is your yield on the bond you’re holding dimin-
ished, but your opportunity to invest your money in anything paying as high
an interest rate has passed. From a bondholder’s perspective, calls are not
pretty, which is why callable bonds must pay higher rates of interest to find
any buyers. (From the issuing company’s or municipality’s perspective,
callable bonds are just peachy; after the call, the company or municipality
can, if it wishes, issue a new bond that pays a lower interest rate.)
Certain hungry bond brokers may “forget” to mention yield-to-call and
instead quote you only current yield or yield-to-maturity numbers. In such
cases, you may pay the broker a big cut to get the bond, hold it for a short
period, and then have to render it to the bond issuer, actually earning your-
self a negative total return. Ouch.
54
Book II: Basic Investments: Stocks, Bonds, Mutual Funds, and More 

Usually a callable bond will not have one possible call date, but several.
Worst-case basis yield (or yield-to-worst-call) looks at all possible yields and tells
you what your yield would be if the company or municipality decides to call
your bond at the worst possible time.
The 30-day SEC yield
Because there are so many ways of measuring yield, and because bond
mutual funds were once notorious for manipulating yield figures, the Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires that all bond funds report yield in
the same manner. The 30-day SEC yield, which attempts to consolidate the
yield-to-maturity of all the bonds in the portfolio, exists so the mutual-fund
bond shopper can have some measure with which to comparison shop. It isn’t
a perfect measure, in large part because the bonds in your bond fund today
may not be the same bonds in your bond fund three weeks from now. None-
theless, the 30-day SEC yield can be helpful in choosing the right funds.
Total Return: THIS is what matters most!
Total return is the entire pot of money you wind up with after the investment
period has come and gone. In the case of bonds or bond funds, that involves not
only your interest, but also any changes in the value of your original principal.
Ignoring for the moment the risk of default (and losing all your principal), here
are other ways in which your principal can shrink or grow.
Figuring in capital gains and losses
In the case of a bond fund, your principal is represented by a certain number
of shares in the fund multiplied by the share price of the fund. As bond prices
go up and down (usually in response to prevailing interest rates), so too will
the share price of the bond fund go up and down. Because of bond volatility, the
share price of a bond fund may go up and down quite a bit, especially if the bond
fund is holding long-term bonds, and doubly-especially if those long-term
bonds are of questionable quality (junk bonds).
In the case of individual bonds, your principal will come back to you whole —
but only if you hold the bond to maturity or if the bond is called. If, on the
other hand, you choose to sell the bond before maturity, you’ll wind up with
whatever market price you can get for the bond at that point. If the market
price has appreciated (the bond sells at a premium), you can count your cap-
ital gains as part of your total return. If the market price has fallen (the bond
sells at a discount), the capital losses will offset any interest you’ve made on
the bond.

Factoring in reinvestment rates of return
Total return of a bond can come from three sources:
 Interest on the bond
 Any possible capital gains (or losses)
 Whatever rate of return you get, if you get any, when you reinvest the
money coming to you every six months
Believe it or not, on a very long-term bond, the last factor — your so-called
reinvestment rate — will probably be the most important of the three! That’s
because of the amazing power of compound interest.
The only kind of bond where the reinvestment rate is not a factor is a zero-
coupon bond, or a bond where your only interest payment comes at the very
end when the bond matures. In the case of zero-coupon bonds, there is no
compounding. The coupon rate of the bond is your actual rate of return, not
accounting for inflation or taxes.
Allowing for inflation adjustments
Your truest total rate of return needs to account for inflation. To account for
inflation when determining the real rate of return on an investment, you can
simply take the nominal rate of return (perhaps 5 or 6 percent) and subtract
the annual rate of inflation (which has been about 3 percent in recent years).
That will give you a very rough estimate of your total real return.
Weighing pre-tax versus post-tax
Taxes almost always eat into your bond returns. For most bonds, the interest
payments are taxed as regular income, and any rise in the value of the princi-
pal, if the bond is sold (and sometimes even if the bond is not sold), is taxed
as capital gain. For most people these days, long-term capital gains (more
than one year) on bond principal are taxed at 15 percent. Any appreciated
fixed-income asset bought and sold within a year is taxed at your normal
income-tax rate, whatever that is. (Most middle-income Americans today are
paying somewhere around 30 percent in income tax.)
Here are two exceptions:
 Tax-free municipal bonds where there is neither a capital gain nor a capital
loss, nor is the bondholder subject to any alternative minimum tax.
 Bonds held in a tax-advantaged account, such as an IRA or a 529 college
savings plan.

“Risk-free” Investing: U.S Treasury Bonds
There are umpteen different kinds of debt securities issued by the U.S.
Treasury. Savings bonds, which can be purchased for small amounts and come
in certificate form (making for nice bar mitzvah and birthday gifts), are but one
kind. In fact, when investment people speak of Treasuries, they usually are not
talking about savings bonds. Rather, they’re talking about larger-denomination
bonds known formerly as Treasury bills, Treasury notes, and Treasury bonds
that are issued only in electronic (sometimes called book-entry) form.
All U.S. Treasury debt securities, whether a $50 savings bond or a $1,000
Treasury note, share four things in common:
 Every bond, an IOU of sorts from Uncle Sam, is backed by the “full faith
and credit” of the United States government and, therefore, is considered
by most investors to be the safest bet around.
 Because it is assumed that any principal you invest is absolutely safe,
Treasury bonds, of whatever kind, tend to pay relatively modest rates of
interest — lower than other comparable bonds, such as corporate
bonds, that may put your principal at some risk.
 True, the United States government is very unlikely to go bankrupt any-
time soon, but Treasury bonds are nonetheless still subject to other
risks inherent in the bond market. Prices on Treasury bonds, especially
those with long-term maturities, can swoop up and down like hungry
hawks in response to such things as prevailing interest rates and
investor confidence in the economy.
 All interest on U.S. government bonds is off-limits to state and local tax
authorities (just as the interest on most municipal bonds is off-limits to
the Internal Revenue Service). But you do pay federal tax.
Beyond these four similarities, the differences among U.S. government debt
securities are many and, in some cases, like night and day.
Savings bonds for beginning investors
U.S. savings bonds make for popular gifts, in part because they are, unlike
other Treasury debt securities, available in pretty certificate form. You can
buy them from just about any bank or directly from the Treasury at www.
treasurydirect.gov. You don’t have to buy them in certificate form; from
the Web site, you can also buy an electronic savings bond, which is regis-
tered online (no paper involved).

Savings bonds are a natural for small investors because you can get started
with as little as $25. With that money, you can buy a bond that has $50
printed on it but won’t actually be worth $50 for some time to come. At the
current interest rate that savings bonds are paying (3.60 percent), you would
have to wait 20 years until the true value caught up with the face amount.
Aside from the (optional) certificates and the ability to invest a small amount,
a third thing that makes savings bonds unique among Treasury debt securi-
ties is that they are strictly non-marketable. When you buy a U.S. savings
bond, either direct from the government or from a bank, you either put your
own name and Social Security number on the bond or the name and Social
Security number of someone you’re gifting it to. You or that person is then
entitled to receive interest from that bond. The bond itself cannot be sold to
another buyer. This is in stark contrast to Treasury bills and bonds that can,
and often do, pass hands more often than poker chips.
Among savings bonds, there are two kinds sold today: EE (or Patriot) bonds
and I bonds.
EE (Patriot) bonds
EEs and Patriot bonds are one and the same. The word Patriot was added to
some, but not all, EE bonds in 2001. Whatever you want to call them, EE
bonds are the most traditional kind of savings bond. Series EE bonds carry a
face value of twice what you purchase them for. They are accrual bonds,
which means that they accrue interest as the years roll on even though you
aren’t seeing any cash. You can pay taxes on that interest as it accrues, but in
most cases it makes more sense to defer paying the taxes until you decide to
redeem the bond. Uncle Sam allows you to do that.
EE bonds are nonredeemable for the first year you own them, and if you hold
them fewer than five years, you surrender three months of interest. EEs are
available in eight different denominations, from $50 up to $10,000. Any indi-
vidual can buy up to $30,000 in EE savings bonds a year (or a face amount of
$60,000).
If you use your savings bonds to fund an education, the interest may be tax-
free.
I bonds
These babies are built to buttress inflation. Issued in the very same denomi-
nations as EE bonds, the I Series bonds offer a fixed rate of return plus an
adjustment for rising prices. Every May 1 and November 1, the Treasury
announces both the fixed rate for all new I bonds and the inflation adjust-
ment for all new and existing I bonds. After you buy an I bond, the fixed rate
is yours for the life of the bond. The inflation rate adjusts every six months.
You collect all your interest only after cashing in the bond. (That is called
accrual interest.)
58
Book II: Basic Investments: Stocks, Bonds, Mutual Funds, and More 

The rules and parameters for I bonds are pretty much the same as they are
for EEs: You have to hold them a year, and if you sell within five years, you
pay a penalty. There’s a limit to how many I bonds you can invest in —
$30,000 a year, per person. And in certain circumstances, the proceeds may
become tax-free if used for education expenses.
If you plan to hold I bonds as a long-term investment (longer than a year or
two), you should be more concerned with the fixed rate, which will be in
effect throughout the life of the bond, than the inflation adjustment, which
will vary. You can purchase I Bonds at your bank or by visiting www.treasury
direct.gov.
Treasury bills, notes, and bonds for more
serious investing
About 98 percent of the approximately $5 trillion in outstanding Treasury debt
is made up not of savings bonds but of marketable (tradable) securities known
as bills, notes, and bonds. This “bills, notes, and bonds” stuff can be a little
confusing because technically they are all bonds. They are all backed by the
full faith and credit of the U.S. government. They are all issued electronically
(you don’t get a fancy piece of paper as you do with savings bonds). They can
all be purchased either directly from the Treasury or through a broker. They

The dinosaurs: Old bonds
Other kinds of savings bonds pre-date today’s
EE and I bonds. Each series of the past has its
own peculiarities, but since you won’t be buying
any of them, there’s no need to get into detail.
Suffice to say that some of the older bonds are
still paying interest, and others are not. If you
have any questions on the status of a savings
bond you have tucked away in the back of your
sock drawer, you can simply type the serial
numbers into the Savings Bond Calculator at
www.treasurydirect.gov, or jot down the
serial number and write a letter to
Bureau of the Public Debt
P.O. Box 7012
Parkersburg, WV 26106-7012
The Bureau of the Public Debt needs a written
and signed request from the owner of the bond,
at which point it will tell you whether the bond is

interest, and how much you could redeem it for
today.

can all trade like hotcakes. The major difference among them is the time you
need to wait to collect your principal:
 Treasury bills have maturities of a year or less.
 Treasury notes are issued with maturities from two to ten years.
 Treasury bonds are long-term investments that have maturities of 10 to
30 years from their issue date.
The bills, like savings bonds, are sold at a discount from their face value. You
get the full amount when the bill matures. The notes and bonds, on the other
hand, are sold at their face value, have a fixed interest rate, and kick off inter-
est payments once every six months. The minimum denomination for all
three is $1,000, and you can buy them all in any increment of $1,000.
Keep in mind that you don’t have to hold any of these securities (bills, notes,
or bonds) till maturity. You can, in fact, cash out at any point. The longer
until the maturity of the bond, however, the more its price can fluctuate and,
therefore, the more you risk losing money.
Treasury Inflation-Protected 
Securities (TIPS)
Like the I bonds, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) receive both
interest and a twice-yearly kick up of principal for inflation. As with interest
on other Treasury securities, interest on TIPS is free from state and local
income taxes. Federal income tax, however, must be coughed up each year
on both the interest payments and the growth in principal.
TIPS, unlike I bonds, are transferable. You can buy TIPS directly from the
Treasury or through a broker. They are currently being issued with terms of 5
and 10 years, although there are plenty of 20-year term TIPS in circulation.
The minimum investment is $1,000.
One of the sweet things about TIPS is that if inflation goes on a rampage, your
principal moves north right along with it. If deflation, a lowering of prices,
occurs (which it hasn’t since the 1930s), you won’t get any inflation adjust-
ment, but you won’t get a deflation adjustment, either. You’ll get back at least
the face value of the bond.
TIPS sound great, and in many ways they are. But be aware that the coupon
rate on TIPS varies with market conditions and tends to be minimal — per-
haps a couple of percentage points. If inflation is calmer than expected
moving into the future, you will almost certainly do better with traditional
Treasuries. If inflation turns out to be higher than expected, your TIPS will be
the stars of your fixed-income portfolio.

Industrial Returns: Corporate Bonds
When it comes to adding stability to a portfolio — the number one reason
that bonds belong in your portfolio — Treasuries and investment-grade (high
quality) corporate bonds are your two best choices. If you look at some of
the worst economic times in our nation’s history, corporate investment-grade
(high quality) bonds have held up remarkably well. By including both
Treasuries and corporate bonds in your portfolio you get the best of both
worlds. Of course, the key is knowing which corporate bonds to consider and
which to steer clear of.
Keep in mind that corporate bonds are not without their challenges. To put it
bluntly, corporate bonds can be something of a pain in the pants, especially
when compared to Treasury bonds. The following sections outline the issues
you need to think about when investing in corporate bonds.
Giving credit ratings their due
If the company goes down, you may lose some or all of your money. Even if
the company doesn’t go down but merely limps, you can lose some or all of
your money. For that reason, you need to pay attention to some crucial credit
ratings.
Appropriately weighing potential risk and return is what good investing is all
about. As for the risk and return on corporate bonds, the potential return
(always something of a guessing game) is quoted in terms of yield, and there
are many kinds of yield. The most oft-quoted kind of yield, used for example
by The Wall Street Journal and most other business papers, is the yield-to-
maturity (refer to the earlier section “Various types of yield”).
The largest determinant of the risk and return you take on a bond is the fiscal
muscle of the company behind the bond. That fiscal muscle is measured by a
company’s credit ratings.
Revisiting your ABCs
There’s an entire industry devoted to rating companies by their financial
strength. The most common ratings come from Moody’s and Standard &
Poor’s, but there are other rating services, such as Fitch Ratings, Dominion,
and A.M. Best. Your broker, I assure you, subscribes to at least two of these
services and will be happy to share the ratings with you.
The highest ratings — Moody’s Aaa and Standard & Poor’s AAA — are the
safest of the safe among corporate bonds, and those ratings are given to few
corporations. If you lend money to one of these stellar companies, you should
expect in return a rate of interest only modestly higher than Treasuries. As
61

you progress from these five-star companies down the ladder, you can expect
higher rates of interest to compensate you for your added risk. Table 2-1
shows how Moody’s, Standard and Poor’s, and Fitch define corporate bond
credit quality ratings.

If you are going to invest in individual bonds, diversification through owning
multiple bonds becomes more important as you go lower on the quality
ladder. There’s a much greater risk of default down there, so you’d be awfully
foolish to have all your eggs in a basket rated Caa or CCC. (Default in bond-
talk means that you bid adieu to your principal.)
One risk inherent to corporate bonds is that they may be downgraded, even
if they never default. Say a bond is rated A by Moody’s. If Moody’s gets
moody and later rates that bond a Baa, the market will respond unfavorably.
Chances are, in such a case, that the value of your bond will drop. Of course,
the opposite is true, as well. If you buy a Baa bond and it suddenly becomes
an A bond, you’ll be sitting pretty. If you wish to hold your bond to maturity,
such downgrades and upgrades are not going to much matter. But should you
decide to sell your bond, they can matter very much.
62
Book II: Basic Investments: Stocks, Bonds, Mutual Funds, and More 

It’s a very good idea to diversify your bonds not only by company but also by
industry. If there is a major upheaval in, say, the utility industry, the rate of
both downgrades and defaults is sure to rise. In such a case, you would be
better off not having all utility bonds.
Gauging the risk of default
How often do defaults occur? According to a study by the folks at Moody’s
covering the years 1970 to 2005, the odds of a corporate bond rated Aaa
defaulting were rather miniscule: 0.36 percent within 10 years and 0.64 per-
cent within 20 years. Of all corporate bonds, only about 2 percent are given
that gloriously high rating.
As you move down the ladder, as you would expect, the default numbers
jump. Bonds rated A can be expected to default at a rate of 0.87 percent over
10 years and 1.55 percent over 20 years. Among Baa bonds, 11.40 percent can
be expected to go belly up within a decade, and 13.84 percent within two
decades.
By the time you get down to Caa bonds, the rate of default is generally
expected to be about 40 times that of Aaa bonds — approximately 14 percent
within one decade and 26 percent within two decades. (Of course, these rates
can vary greatly with economic conditions.)
Going for high-yield bonds (or not)
There is no distinct line between investment-grade and high-yield bonds,
sometimes known as junk bonds. But generally, if a bond receives a rating
less than a Baa from Moody’s or a BBB from Standard & Poor’s, the market
considers it high-yield.
High-yield bonds offer greater excitement for the masses. The old adage that
risk equals return is clear as day in the world of bonds. High-yield bonds offer
greater yield than investment-grade bonds, and they are more volatile. But
they are also one other thing: much more correlated to the stock market. In
fact, Treasuries and investment-grade corporate bonds aren’t correlated to
the stock market at all. So if bonds are going to serve as ballast for your port-
folio, which is what they do best, why would anyone want high-yield bonds?
In my opinion, you wouldn’t, regardless of whether good times or bad times
are coming:
 If the economy is strong, then companies are making money, the public
is optimistic, and stocks are going to sail. So may high-yield bonds, but
stocks historically return much more than high-yield bonds. Stocks have
a century-old track record of returning about five percentage points more
than high quality bonds. And, unless you have those bonds in a retirement
account, you’re going to pay income tax on the interest. Most of the gain

in your stocks, however, won’t be taxed at all until you sell the stock.
Even then, it will most likely be taxed as capital gains — 15 percent —
which is probably lower than your income tax.
 If the economy starts to sour and companies start closing their doors,
then stocks will fall and high-yield bonds very likely will too. In 2000, for
example, when the stock market started to crumble, a basket of high-
yield bonds would have lost between 3 and 4 percent. That’s not a
tragedy, but the last thing you want is for your bonds to turn south right
along with your stocks.
If you really want junk bonds in your portfolio, take a serious look at foreign
high-yield bonds, especially the bonds of emerging-market nations, which can
make a lot of sense. That’s because they don’t have much, if any, correlation
to the ups and downs on Wall Street. And if you’re wealthy (or not-so-wealthy
but you choose to ignore my advice) and decide to invest in individual high-
yields anyway, know that the broker markups can sometimes kill you.
Calculating callability
One consideration that pertains to corporate bonds but not to Treasuries is
the nasty issue of callability. There’s a chance that the issuing company may
call in your bond and spit your money back in your face at some terribly
inopportune moment, such as when prevailing interest rates have just taken
a tumble. Treasuries aren’t called. Corporate bonds, as well as municipal
bonds and agency bonds, often are. And that can make a huge difference in
the profitability of your investment.
If you own a callable bond, chances are that it will be called at the worst
moment — just as interest rates are falling and the value of your bond is on
the rise. At that moment, the company that issued the bond, if it has the right
to issue a call, no doubt will. And why not? Interest rates have fallen. The firm
can pay you off and find someone else to borrow money from at a lower rate.
Because calls aren’t fun, callable bonds must pay higher rates of interest.
If you’re inclined to go for that extra juice that comes with a callable bond, I
say fine. But, you should always do so with the assumption that your callable
bond will be called. With that in mind, ask the broker to tell you how much
(after taking his markup into consideration) your yield will be between today
and the call date. Consider that a worst-case-yield. (It is often referred to as
yield-to-worst-call, sometimes abbreviated YTW.) Consider it the yield you’ll
get. And compare that to the yield you’ll be getting on other comparable bonds.
If you choose the callable bond and it winds up not being called, hey, that’s
gravy.
64
Book II: Basic Investments: Stocks, Bonds, Mutual Funds, and More 

Some squirrelly bond brokers, to encourage you to place your order to buy,
will assure you that a certain callable bond is unlikely to be called. They may
be right in some cases, but you should never bank on such promises.
Coveting convertibility
The flip side of a callable bond is a convertible bond. Some corporate bond
issuers sell bonds that can be converted into a fixed number of shares of
common stock. With a convertible bond, a lender (bondholder) can become
a part owner (stockholder) of the company by converting the bond into com-
pany stock. Having this option is a desirable thing (options are always desir-
able, no?), and so convertible bonds generally pay lower interest rates than
do similar bonds that are not convertible.
If the stock performs poorly, there is no conversion. You are stuck with your
bond’s lower return (lower than what a nonconvertible corporate bond would
get). If the stock performs well, there is a conversion. So you win, so to speak.
Convertible bonds, which are fairly common among corporate bonds, intro-
duce a certain measure of unpredictability into a portfolio. Perhaps the most
important investment decision you can make is how to divide your portfolio
between stocks and bonds. With convertibles, whatever careful allotment
you come up with can be changed overnight. Your bonds suddenly become
stocks. You are rewarded for making a good investment. But just as soon as
you receive that reward, your portfolio becomes riskier. It’s the old trade-off
in action.
Lots of Protection: Agency Bonds
You’ve no doubt heard the story of the three blind, er, sight-impaired men
and the elephant . . . how the first man touches the tail and assumes the ele-
phant is like a snake; the second touches the tusk and assumes the elephant
is like a spear; and the third touches the side of the animal and assumes the
elephant is like a wall. Welcome to the touch-me, feel-me, open-to-wide-
interpretation world of agency bonds! Don’t get me wrong. There are some
good investments to be had here. All you have to do is figure out the tusk
from the tail. The following sections give you an overview.

Slurping up your alphabet soup
Who or what issues agency bonds? Governmental agencies or quasi-
governmental agencies, like the Federal Farm Credit Banks (FFCB), the
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC), the General Services
Administration (GSA), the Small Business Administration (SBA), the
Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), and the U.S. Agency for International
Development (USAID).
The first thing to know about these (and the many other) government agen-
cies is that they fit under two large umbrellas. Some of them really are U.S.
federal agencies; they are an actual part of the government just as are
Congress, the jet engines on Air Force One, and the fancy silverware at the
White House. Such official agencies include the General Services
Administration, the Government National Mortgage Association, and the
Small Business Administration. The U.S. Post Office also once issued bonds
but has not done so lately.
Most of the so-called agencies, however, aren’t quite parts of the government.
They are, technically speaking, government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs): cor-
porations created by Congress to work for the common good but then set out
more or less on their own. Many of these are publicly held, issuing stock on
the major exchanges. Such pseudo-agencies include the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corporation and the Federal National Mortgage Association.
What’s the difference between the two groups, especially with regard to their
bonds? The first group (the official-government group) issues bonds that
carry the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. The second group, well,
their bonds carry a mysterious implicit guarantee that the U.S. government
will bail them out in times of trouble. Because this second group is much
larger than the first — both in terms of the number of agencies and the value
of the bonds they issue — when investment experts speak of “agency bonds,”
they are almost always talking about the bonds of the GSEs.
Because of the very small risk of default inherent in agency bonds and the
greater risk of price volatility due to public sentiment, agency bonds tend to
pay higher rates of interest than Treasury bonds, although not a heck of a lot
more. The spread between Treasuries and the faux-agency bonds is typically
within half a percentage point, if even that much. As for the real government
agencies, such as the Small Business Administration, which issue bonds
backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, the difference in
yield between their bonds and Treasuries would be so small as to be almost
immeasurable.
66
Book II: Basic Investments: Stocks, Bonds, Mutual Funds, and More 

Introducing the agency biggies
To give you an idea of what GSEs are and what they do, this section describes
the three largest (and most popular with retail investors) issuers of agency
bonds: the Federal National Mortgage Association (known colloquially as
Fannie Mae), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac),
and the Federal Home Loan Banks.
Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae)
Fannie Mae, which dates back to 1968, raises money by selling bonds. It then
turns some of that money over to banks. The banks use the money to make
loans, mostly to homebuyers (believe it or not, 63 million homebuyers and
counting).
Most Fannie Mae bonds (generally available in increments of $1,000) are pur-
chased by institutions: insurance companies, other nation’s central banks
(especially China’s), university endowments, and so on. But individual
investors are certainly welcome to join in the fun, too. The agency issues
bonds of varying maturities; and, naturally, there’s a large secondary market
where you can find any maturity from several months to many years down
the pike. Fannie Mae sounds like a public agency, but it is really a private cor-
poration with government oversight. For more information, see www.fannie
mae.com.
If you believe that agency debt belongs in your portfolio (it certainly isn’t a
necessity, but it’s a good option for many investors), Fannie Mae bonds may
be an okay choice. It all depends on the price your broker offers you. Note
that Fannie Mae bonds may be traditional interest-bearing bonds, or they
may be mortgage-backed bonds.
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac)
This agency (which is also, technically, a private corporation tied to the gov-
ernment) was formed in 1970 and is very similar to Fannie Mae. So are its
multitude of bond issues with their many maturities, denominations of
$1,000, and choice of traditional or mortgage-backed.
Freddie Mac buys one residential mortgage every seven seconds and, by so
doing, helps to finance one in six homes in the United States. Most of the
mortgages are purchased from primary lenders (such as your neighborhood
bank). With the money those lenders get from Freddie Mac, they can go out
and make more loans. Like Fannie Maes, most Freddie Macs are bought by
institutions. For more information, see www.freddiemac.com.

Federal Home Loan Banks
This is not a single agency but a coalition of 12 regional banks formed in 1932.
Its mission is to fund low-income housing and housing projects. The money used
for the funding comes from — you guessed it — selling bonds. Lots of bonds.
This coalition is far and away the largest issuer of so-called agency bonds.
These bonds are a bit more popular with individual investors than Freddies
and Fannies — as well they should be, at least for those in higher tax brack-
ets: The interest earned is exempt from state and local taxes. For more infor-
mation, see www.fhlbanks.com.
Like Fannies and Freddies, the FHLB bonds come in many different flavors as
far as denominations and maturities.
Comparing agency bonds
All agency bonds are considered high quality with very little risk of default.
The honest-and-true federal agencies, such as the Small Business Administration
(SBA), are said to have no risk of default; therefore, their bonds pay more or
less what Treasuries do. You may get a smidgen more interest (maybe 5 basis
points, or 5/100 of 1 percent) to compensate you for the lesser liquidity of such
agency bonds (the lesser ability to sell them in a flash).
The majority of agency bonds are issued by government-sponsored enter-
prises (GSEs), and the risk of default, although real, is probably next to noth-
ing. You get a higher rate of interest on these bonds than you do with
Treasuries to compensate you for the fact that the risk of default does exist.
With all agency bonds, you pay a markup when you buy and sell, which you
don’t with Treasuries if you buy them directly from the government. If you’re
not careful, that markup could easily eat up your first several months of earn-
ings. It also could make the difference between agency bonds and Treasury
bonds a wash.
Most agency bonds pay a fixed rate of interest twice a year. About 25 percent
of them are callable, meaning that the agencies issuing the bonds have the right
to cancel the bond and give you back your principal. The other 75 percent
are non-callable bonds (sometimes referred to as bullet bonds). Callable
bonds tend to pay somewhat higher rates of interest, but your investment
takes on a certain degree of uncertainty.
Investing in individual agency bonds, or individual bonds of any kind, for that
matter, is not an activity for poor people. Although you may be able to get
into the game for as little as $1,000, bond brokers typically mark up such
small transactions to the point that they simply don’t make sense. I wouldn’t
68
Book II: Basic Investments: Stocks, Bonds, Mutual Funds, and More 

suggest even looking at individual agency bonds unless you’ve got at least
$50,000 to invest in a pop. Otherwise, you should be looking at bond funds, or
individual Treasuries that you can buy without paying any markup whatsoever.
When choosing among different agencies, you want to carefully compare
yields-to-maturity and make sure that you know full well whether you are
buying a traditional bond or a mortgage-backed security. They are totally
different animals.
The taxes you pay on agency bonds vary. Interest from bonds issued by
Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae is fully taxable. The interest on most other
agency bonds — including the king of agency bonds, the Federal Home Loan
Banks — is exempt from state and local tax.
(Almost) Tax-free Havens: 
Municipal Bonds
If not for the fact that municipal bonds are exempt from federal income tax,
they would likely be about as popular as buttermilk at a college keg party. On
the day I’m writing this chapter, for example, high quality munis with maturi-
ties of five years out are yielding an average of 3.75 percent. Five-year
Treasuries, meanwhile, are currently yielding 4.75 percent — about one-
quarter more the return. (Keep in mind that Treasuries aren’t exactly world-
famous for their high returns.) And while the munis carry some (limited) risk,
the Treasuries do not. But of course, munis are tax-exempt.
The issuers of municipal bonds include, of course, municipalities (duh), such
as cities and towns. But they also include counties, public universities, cer-
tain private universities, airports, not-for-profit hospitals, public power
plants, water and sewer administrations, various and sundry nonprofit orga-
nizations, bridge and tunnel authorities, housing authorities, and an occa-
sional research foundation.
Any government, local agency, nonprofit, or what-have-you that is deemed to
serve the public good, with a blessing from the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the IRS (and sometimes voters), may have the honor of issu-
ing a municipal bond.

Comparing and contrasting 
with other bonds
The tax-exempt status of munis is unquestionably their most notable and
easily recognizable characteristic — the equivalent of Kojak’s cue ball or
Groucho Marx’s mustache.
Like most bonds, munis come with differing maturities. Some mature in a
year or less, others in 20 or 30 years. Unlike most bonds, munis tend to be
issued in minimal denominations of $5,000 and multiples of $5,000 (not a min-
imum of $1,000 and multiples of $1,000, like corporate bonds and Treasuries).
Like many corporate bonds, but unlike Treasuries, many municipal bonds are
callable, meaning the issuer can kick back your money and sever your rela-
tionship before the bond matures. Like other bonds, the interest rate on
munis is generally fixed, but the price of the bond can go up and down;
unless you hold your bond to maturity, you may or may not get your princi-
pal returned whole. If the maturity is many years off, the price of the bond
can go up and down considerably.
The tax-exempt status of munis isn’t the only reason they may belong in your
portfolio. Municipal bonds also offer a fair degree of diversification, even
from other bonds. Because they are the only kind of bond more popular with
households than with institutions, the muni market is swayed more by public
demand than the markets for other bonds. For example, when the stock
market tanks and individual investors get butterflies in their stomachs, they
tend to sell out of their stock holdings (often a mistake) and load up on what
they see as less risky investments, such as munis. When the demand for
munis goes up, it tends to drive prices higher. Popular demand or lack of
demand for munis typically affects their prices more than it does the price of
corporate bonds and Treasuries. Those taxable bonds, in contrast, tend to be
more interest-rate sensitive than munis.
Realizing that all cities (or bridges 
or hospitals) are not created equal
Like the corporations that issue corporate bonds, the entities (cities, hospitals,
universities, and so on) that issue municipal bonds are of varying economic
strength — although the degree of variance isn’t nearly as large as it is in the
corporate world. One study looked at bond defaults between the years 1970
and 2000. Of all the muni bonds rated by credit-rating agency Moody’s during
that 30-year period (about 80 percent of the dollar volume of all municipal
offerings), only 18 defaults occurred. That compares to 819 corporate-bond
defaults during the same period.
70
Book II: Basic Investments: Stocks, Bonds, Mutual Funds, and More 

Of those 18 municipal defaults reported in the study, 10 were healthcare facili-
ties. All the defaulted bonds were revenue bonds; none were general obligation
bonds. General obligation bonds are secured by the full faith and credit of the
issuer and are typically supported by that issuer’s power to tax the hell out
of the citizenry, if necessary. Revenue bonds’ interest and principal are
secured only by the revenue derived from a specific project. If the project
goes bust, so does the bond.
Enjoying low risk
The same study from Moody’s also found a huge difference in recovery rates
of munis as compared to other bonds. The recovery rate is the amount of
money bondholders get back after the dust of a default settles. On defaulted
munis from 1970 to 2000, the recovery rate was 66 percent of the face value of
the bonds. In contrast, the poor corporate bondholders got back only 42 per-
cent of the face value on their defaulted bonds.
So by and large, municipal bonds are very safe animals — at least those rated
by the major rating agencies (such as Moody’s), which are the vast majority
of munis. If the mild nature of the beast weren’t enough to put your investing
soul at ease, know that roughly two-thirds of municipal bonds issued today
come insured; you can’t lose your principal unless the issuer and its insurance
company go under, which is very unlikely! And even if the insurance company
were to fail, the general feeling among industry insiders is that most states
would be very, very reluctant to allow one of their cities to default on a
general obligation bond.
Rating munis
Municipal bonds, like corporate bonds, are rated by the major bond-rating
agencies. But they have their very own rating system. (If municipalities were
rated using the corporate ratings, almost all would hug the very top of the
scale.) Table 2-2 shows the ratings used by three major bond-rating agencies:
Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s, and Fitch.

Choosing from a vast array of possibilities
You definitely want munis that are rated. Some municipal offerings are not
rated, and these can be risky investments or very illiquid (you may not be
able to sell them when you want, if at all). I suggest going with the top-rated
munis: Moody’s Aaa or Aa. The lower rated munis may give you a wee bit
extra yield but probably are not worth the added risk. (Keep in mind that a
lower rated bond can be more volatile than a high rated bond. Default isn’t
the only risk.)
Of course, you also want to choose a municipal bond that carries a maturity
you can live with. If the bond is callable, well, is that something you can live
with and be happy with? Callable bonds pay slightly higher coupon rates but
are less predictable than noncallable bonds.
But perhaps most importantly, because the tax-free status of the muni is
undoubtedly a prime motivation for buying a muni in the first place, you want
to consider whether you want to buy a national muni or a state muni, and if
you buy a state muni, do you want double- or triple-tax-free? Here’s the scoop:
 National munis are exempt from federal tax but are not necessarily
exempt from state income tax. (Some states tax bond coupon payments
and others do not.)
 State munis, if purchased by residents of the same state, are typically
exempt from state tax, if there is one. Some, but not all, state munis are
also exempt from all local taxes.
72
Book II: Basic Investments: Stocks, Bonds, Mutual Funds, and More 

 Munis that are exempt from both federal and state tax are called double-
tax-free bonds. Those exempt from federal, state, and local tax are often
referred to as triple-tax-free bonds.
To decide which kind of muni — national or state, double- or triple-tax-free —
consult your tax adviser before laying out any big money on munis. The tax
rules are complicated and forever changing. Some states impose taxes on you
if you invest in other states’ munis; others do not. Some states even tax you if
you invest in munis in your own state. Certain bonds issued in Puerto Rico
and other U.S. territories are free from almost all taxation regardless of where
you live. It’s a jungle out there!
Municipal bonds, like any tax-free investment, make most sense in a taxable
account. In fact, I’d say that putting a muni into any kind of tax-advantaged
account, such as an IRA or Roth IRA, makes about as much sense as putting a
kidney pie on a vegetarian buffet. If you’re looking to fill your IRA with fixed-
income investments, don’t be looking at munis. Taxable bonds provide
greater return, and if the taxes can be postponed (as in an IRA) or avoided
(as in a Roth IRA), then taxable bonds are almost always the way to go.
Taxes you may pay, even for a muni
There are instances, rare as they may be, where taxes can grab you from
behind and make you not want to wake up on the morning of April 15.
 The AMT tax: The alternative minimum tax is a federal tax that exists in
a parallel universe, which you enter unwillingly when you make a fair
chunk of change, claim too many exemptions, or take too many deductions.
Ask your tax guru if you are likely to be smacked by AMT at any point in
the near future. If so, you may want to hand-pick your munis (and muni
funds) to include only those that are exempt from the AMT.
 Capital gains taxes: If you buy a security at a certain price and then sell
it at a higher price, that’s a good thing! But you may be subject to pay
capital gains tax to the IRS . . . even if the security you sold is a tax-
exempt municipal bond. (The tax rules governing municipal zero-coupon
bonds bought at a discount and then sold at a lesser discount or a premium
can be complicated; talk to your tax advisor.) What pertains to individual
bonds also pertains to municipal bond mutual funds. Sell your shares for
more than you purchased them, and you’ll have to pay capital gains. Of
course, if you sell at a loss, whether a bond or a bond fund, you may
then declare a capital-gains tax loss, which is usually used to write off
capital gains.

 Researching your fund and its features
A
lthough most people should have exposure to the stock market, it’s
really hard for an individual investor to make money trading single stocks.
To reduce portfolio risk, you should hold about 30 different stocks, and it
takes a lot of money and time to accumulate that. You could buy individual
bonds, as well, but minimum prices start at $1,000, making it costly to build a
diversified portfolio of those. What if you don’t have a lot of money to get
started? What if you don’t have a lot of time to spend analyzing securities
and making trades? What if there were easier ways to invest?
Well, there is an easier way. It’s called the mutual fund, and in this chapter, I
cover all you need to get started making money with this popular, powerful
investment vehicle.
Defining the Mutual Fund
A mutual fund is an investment company registered with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Simple,
huh? Each individual mutual fund is a stand-alone company that contracts
with an investment manager who takes the money of all the fund investors
and buys securities on their behalf.
Because thousands of different shareholders in the fund pool their money
together, the investment manager can buy a diverse portfolio of securities.
And because managing money is her full-time job, she can do lots of research
that may help her to choose securities that collectively will beat the market.
Alternatively, she may decide to simply invest in the market, or a big slice of

it, and not pick securities. Such funds, which tend to be the least expensive,
are known as index funds, and I discuss them later in this chapter.
Mutual funds are popular investments. At the end of 2006, the Investment
Company Institute, which is the industry’s largest trade organization, reported
that Americans held $10.4 trillion in 8,726 different open-end mutual funds.
This represents 23.2 percent of household financial assets.
Each of the thousands of mutual funds falls into two main categories: open-end
and closed-end. Which type you choose affects your rights and your costs of
buying and selling, as well as your potential profit, so you’ll want to know the
difference.
Open-end funds
Most mutual funds sold in the United States are open-end mutual funds. This
means that you buy and sell shares directly from the fund, and the fund
company continually issues and redeems new shares. If you invest $1,000 in
the fund, the total fund size grows by $1,000. If you cash in $1,000 of your
shares, the fund shrinks by $1,000. This means that there is always a market
for the fund shares. If the fund doesn’t have enough cash to meet its redemp-
tions, the portfolio manager — the person who invests the money — sells
some of the securities to raise the funds.
In an open-end fund, the share value is its net asset value (NAV), which is the
total value of all the securities in the fund divided by the total number of
shares that the fund has issued. Shares never trade for more or less than the
NAV. There may be an additional sales charge, called a load, which I discuss
in more detail later in this chapter.
Closed-end funds
Closed-end funds are relatively rare, with only about 650 of them compared
to the almost 9,000 open-end funds on the market. These funds do not buy
and sell their shares continuously. Instead, the fund organizers collect money
from investors all at once and then do an initial public offering of stock (just
like a regular company would). The fund’s portfolio managers invest the
money, and investors who want to buy or sell shares in the fund do so
through the exchange, trading the closed-end fund shares just as they would
the shares of any other public company.
Now, if markets were truly efficient, a closed-end fund’s share price would be
its net asset value (NAV): the value of all the securities divided by the total
number of shares outstanding. After all, you know what the securities are
worth because the fund company has to report it every day. Why would you
76
Book II: Basic Investments: Stocks, Bonds, Mutual Funds, and More 

pay more than that, and why would someone else let you get away with paying
less? Well, it turns out that closed-end funds rarely trade at NAV. Instead, they
usually trade at a discount. (And yes, this irritates the heck out of academics
who hold a fervent belief in market efficiency.)
Some investors like to buy closed-end funds just for the bargain. They wait
until the share price is well below the NAV, then they swoop in. In some cases,
closed-end fund shareholders have forced the fund managers to either disband
the fund or convert it to an open-ended fund in order to eliminate the discount.
Knowing How Big Fund Companies Fit In
Legally, each mutual fund is its own company. So what about the big brand-
name fund companies like Fidelity, T. Rowe Price, and Vanguard? What do
they do? Well, legally, these firms are money management companies that
handle the investment, marketing, and sales of the different mutual funds that
use their name, and they are often known as fund complexes or families of
funds. They come up with new fund ideas, then form mutual fund companies
that will pay a fee to the money management company for these services.
When you buy a mutual fund, you become a shareholder in the mutual fund,
not in the fund management complex.
Although each fund has its own board of directors, the board of directors
usually goes along with the fund management company’s decisions. But 
not always. It’s rare, but boards have on occasion become fed up with the
management company’s services, dropping the arrangement and giving 
the management contract to a different firm.
Meeting Myriad Types of Mutual Funds
Mutual fund managers don’t just invest willy-nilly. Instead, they take your
money and invest it in specific types of securities to meet a specific investment
objective, which is described in the fund’s prospectus. That’s a legal document
that an open-end fund must keep on file at the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) and make available to anyone who wants to buy shares in
the fund. (Closed-end funds issue a prospectus when they are organized; after
that, they must file annual reports with the SEC.)
The investment objective gives you a sense of the fund’s expected return —
and the expected amount of risk that the fund will take. That information
helps you make decisions about whether the fund is right for you. Because
the prospectus also tells you about the fund’s investments, you’ll have a
sense of how it works with other investments you have. After all, one way to
reduce your total risk is to diversify (see Book I, Chapter 1).

Return is your reward for taking risk. The higher the expected return, the
higher the amount of risk that an investment has.

Stock funds, also called equity funds, invest in shares of stock of different
companies. These represent partial ownership in the companies, and they
should go up in price when the company does well and down in price when it
does not. Stock funds make it easy for investors to get exposure to a wide range
of companies, helping them get better long-term performance than they can
probably get on their own. Stock funds are usually designed to generate capital
gains, which mean that they try to rate profits by buying the stock at one
price and selling it at a higher one.
Stock funds fall into many different styles, because the fund managers usually
concentrate on specific market sectors or types of stocks. There are lots of
different categories of stock funds, and it seems like more emerge each year
as markets change and fund managers get great new ideas. Following are
descriptions of some that you may come across.
Growth funds
Growth funds invest in growth stocks. They look for companies that are
developing new products and new markets, that have good control over their
expenses, and that are expected to grow their profits faster than the average
company trading in the stock market. Investors choose growth funds when
they are looking to get a high return on their money, especially if they are saving
their money for a long time, as for retirement. That way, the investors can
live through the downside risk to reap gains in the great years.
Some growth fund managers specialize in small, medium, or large companies.
In general, small company stocks offer greater long-term returns (with greater
risk), while larger company stocks have lower returns and lower risk.
Value funds
Many companies and stocks do not perform well. They may have problems
with a product, the management may not be doing a good job, or maybe the
companies are great but no one seems to know it. These stocks may be great
bargains, and that’s what value fund managers look for. They want to buy
companies when they are cheap, then collect the profits when the business is
sold or when it improves. Value investors have to be patient, as it can take a
while for the rest of the market to see that these stocks are underpriced. But
when and if that happens, the value fund will be sitting pretty.

Index funds
Market returns are measured by indexes, which hold a large number of
stocks and are designed to demonstrate the performance of the market in
general. One of the best known of these is the Standard & Poor’s 500 index
(S&P 500), which aggregates the prices of 500 large U.S. companies. Others
include the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which has 30 very large companies
in it, and the Russell 3000, which is an average of the prices of the 3,000 largest
public companies in the United States. See Book I, Chapter 2 for more details
on indexes.
An index fund is designed to mimic the performance of one of the indexes,
performing no better and no worse. The fund manager buys all the securities
in the index in equal proportion, using futures (contracts designed to generate
the same return as the index) to help if it is difficult to buy the right securities
on any given day while also handling purchases and redemptions.
Most investors find that index funds are an easy, low-cost way to match market
performance. They are popular with novice investors who are uncertain about
making choices among all the funds out there, as well as with experienced
investors who appreciate the inexpensive way to get good performance.
Sector (or specialty) funds
Want a mutual fund that invests just in electric utilities, health care companies,
or real estate? If so, you want a specialty fund. These invest in specific industries,
to the exclusion of all others. The fund managers tend to know what’s happening
in their sectors inside and out. The downside is that these funds offer less
diversification; if technology stocks are out of favor, your technology fund
probably won’t be doing very well even if the rest of the stock market is going
gangbusters.
International funds
Many great investment opportunities can be found outside of the United States,
and that’s the appeal of international funds. Some of these funds specialize in a
specific region, like Europe, or in specific types of markets, like developing
economies. International funds give you exposure to returns available in
other countries, and you don’t have to learn a new language, figure out the
currency issues, or master different accounting systems — the international
fund manager does that for you.
A variant, the global fund, invests anywhere in the world, at home or abroad.

Bond funds
Want to take on less risk than the stock market in exchange for a more
predictable return? Then maybe a bond fund is right for you. Bonds are essen-
tially loans in which the issuing company, government, or agency is borrowing
money from the bond investor. In exchange, the investor receives a regular
interest payment. See Chapter 2 in this book for the details about bonds.
Bond funds pool money from many investors to buy a diversified portfolio of
bonds, often with different maturities and interest rates. But few bond man-
agers want to buy everything that comes out, so they specialize. Read on for
descriptions of some of the most common types of bond funds.
U.S. government bond funds
The U.S. government is running a huge deficit at the time I write this chapter,
and most likely, it will still have a deficit when you read it. To finance this
deficit, the government borrows money. But no matter how big the deficit
gets, these bonds are free from bankruptcy risk. The U.S. government owns
printing presses and can print off money. This means that it is almost impossible
for the government to default on its loans.
Some U.S. government bond funds invest in all sorts of securities issued by
the government and its agencies, while others specialize. Most government
issues are known as Treasuries, and Treasury is often shortened to T. T bonds
are those that mature in ten years or more. T notes mature in less than ten
years but more than one year. Those treasuries that mature in less than one
year are known as T bills.
In addition to Treasuries, the U.S. government backs bonds issued by entities
that are affiliated with the government. These are known as agency securities,
and they are often issued by such mortgage guarantee agencies as Fannie
Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae. See Chapter 2 in this book for much more
detail.
Corporate bond funds
Corporations often borrow money to build new factories, make acquisitions,
or simply finance continuing operations. They often do this by issuing bonds.
Corporate bonds have some risk because the company can go bankrupt and
refuse to pay back the money that it borrowed. Many rating services evaluate
a company’s financial performance and assign a rating that affects the interest
rate that the company pays, just as the credit bureaus evaluate an individual’s
financial performance and assign a credit score that affects the interest rate
you pay on your mortgage. Some funds invest only in higher-quality bonds,
while others look for opportunities among less credit-worthy bond offerings
(known as junk bonds or high-yield bonds), trading off the higher risk for the
higher interest rates.
80
Book II: Basic Investments: Stocks, Bonds, Mutual Funds, and More 

Municipal bond funds
Many state and local governments need to raise money, and the federal
government gives them a nice little advantage to help them do so at relatively
low interest costs: It exempts the interest income on these bonds from
federal taxes. Many states also give a tax break on income from these bonds,
known as municipal bonds (often shortened to munis), even if they are issued
by a state entity. Municipal bonds are of most interest to individual investors
in a high tax bracket looking for high current income. They are not appropriate
for retirement or college savings accounts because those accounts usually
have their own tax advantages.
Most municipal bond funds invest all over the country, but a few specialize
only in the bonds from certain states, especially New York and California. (No
surprise, these are populous states with high income tax rates.) State-specific
funds rarely make sense for people who live elsewhere.
International bond funds
Companies and governments around the world need to borrow money, and
international bond funds are happy to loan it to them. Investors may find
better returns and increased diversification benefits from international bond
funds, especially if exchange rates happen to move in favorable ways.
Many international investments offer great returns in the foreign currency
that disappear when converted back to U.S. dollars. Many fund managers use
hedging techniques to reduce this risk, but exchange rate risk can have a real
effect on your return — positive or negative.
Some international bond funds organize themselves around a currency or
region, buying both corporate and government bonds from the area. Others
invest only in corporate bonds or only in government bonds.
Total return funds
Most stock fund managers look to get capital gains, while bond fund managers
try to generate interest income. But suppose you want an investment that
offers both income and appreciation? That’s the goal of a total return fund,
also called a balanced fund. These funds invest in a mix of stocks and bonds
to get a better return than is available with most bond funds with less risk
than with most stock funds.
Many fund companies offer a type of total return fund called a target fund. It’s
designed for investors who are saving money for retirement or other long-term
goals. The fund managers adjust the investment strategy over time, generally
investing in riskier investments in the earlier years and more conservative
ones as the fund gets closer to the target date.

Money market funds
Are you looking for a safe investment that pays a higher return than you can
get from a bank CD or savings account? You may want to consider a money
market mutual fund. These funds invest in such short-term investments as one-
month jumbo bank CDs, Treasury bills, and corporate overnight securities,
which are one-day loans to companies that may have a temporary mismatch
between when their bills are due and when their customers pay them. The short
time frame means that the risk is very low, so money market funds effectively
function like cash. In fact, many mutual fund management companies allow
their money market fund customers to write checks on their accounts.
A money market mutual fund is not federally insured, so your investment is not
guaranteed. That being said, the risk is extremely low, and money market
investors have rarely lost money. The funds are managed to maintain a net asset
value of $1.00 per share; some fund management companies have added their
own money to poorly performing funds in order to avoid “breaking the buck.”
Keeping a Close Eye on Sales Charges
A load is a sales charge, and many mutual funds have them. Sometimes this
charge compensates a broker or financial planner for helping you manage your
money, and other times it’s just pure profit to the fund company for services
that they need to provide anyway. Because loads reduce the amount of money
that you invest, they affect your total investment return. I describe different
types of loads here so that you know what you are up against.
If you are getting good advice from a broker or a financial planner before you
buy the fund, it may be worth your while to pay a load. If you are making the
entire investment decision yourself, you should seek funds that do not have
loads. Why compensate someone else for the work you’ve done?
No-load funds
A no-load fund is a fund with no sales charge. These are becoming rare as
more investors use outside advisors and as more fund companies look for
ways to increase profits. With a no-load fund, you may buy and sell shares
directly from the fund company, or from a brokerage house. You make the
decisions and take the responsibility for your choices. In exchange for inves-
tigating the fund yourself, you save the sales fee.
82
Book II: Basic Investments: Stocks, Bonds, Mutual Funds, and More 

If you buy a mutual fund in your 401(k) or other employer retirement plan,
you probably won’t pay a load, no matter how the fund is sold to other types
of accounts. You may pay a 12b-1 fee, though, which is similar to a load and is
described in an upcoming section.
Front-end load funds
With a front-end load fund, the investor pays a sales charge at the time the
investment is made. In most cases, the charge is shared between the fund
management company and the broker or financial planner who recommended
the fund. If you are buying a mutual fund through one of these advisors, you
will almost definitely pay a front-end load. And that may not be the only load
you pay.
Some good funds carry high front-end loads because they are sold through
brokers and financial planners. However, the fund companies may also allow
customers of discount brokerage firms to buy these funds directly at a lower,
or even no, sales charge. One such operation is the Charles Schwab Mutual
Fund OneSource (www.schwab.com). If you like to make your own decisions,
consider buying funds that way.
Most load funds have breakpoints, which means that the percentage of the
sales charge goes down as you invest more money. For example, the load
may be 4 percent of the first $1,000 invested, 3 percent of the second $1,000,
and 1 percent on amounts over $2,000. Some unscrupulous advisors have
been known to charge the highest load on the entire investment. Check to
make sure this doesn’t happen to you.
Back-end load funds
Some funds levy a sales charge when you take money out of the fund. This
way, you get to put all of your money to work up front, so it may be cheaper
for you than a front-end load.
In some cases, the load is charged only if the money is in the fund for a short
period of time, in which case, it’s known as a contingent deferred sales charge.
This contingent load compensates the fund company for the upfront costs of
opening the account, and it discourages fund investors from trading in and
out of their accounts. (And that’s as it should be, because mutual funds aren’t
really appropriate for traders with short time horizons.) After the customer
has proven that he or she is a long-term investor, no sales charge will be
levied on redemption.

12b-1 fees
In 1980, the SEC decided to allow mutual fund companies to charge an ongo-
ing sales charge. The paragraph of the law is Rule 12b-1, and hence the fees
are known as 12b-1 fees. And doesn’t that sound nicer than “license to print
money”?
Most funds charge 12b-1 fees these days, and that’s why there are so few true
no-load funds anymore. These fees are usually small — maybe 0.25 percent
per year — but they come out of your investment performance. They com-
pensate the fund company for its ongoing marketing costs, meaning that you
pay for the fund company to clog your mailbox with ads to get you to invest
more money. If you work with a financial advisor, part of the 12b-1 fee will go
toward paying an ongoing commission for keeping you up-to-date on the fund.
To be honest, I think that 12b-1 fees are vaguely immoral. I don’t see why I
should pay for ads that I don’t want, nor do I see why customer service from
the fund company is an extra frill requiring a special charge. After all, it’s
already making plenty of money from me. Furthermore, I don’t use a financial
advisor! But here’s the thing: 12b-1 fees are hard to avoid. That’s why you
need to pay attention to a fund’s performance after all fees are paid, not the
amount charged in any one fee category.
Some funds charge very high 12b-1 fees — as much as 1.25 percent. It’s diffi-
cult to generate enough performance to offset that amount, especially in a low-
risk, low-return investment like a bond fund. There are very few cases where a
1.25 percent 12b-1 fee is worth the money.
Being a Savvy Mutual Fund Investor
Mutual fund investing is one of the easiest ways for an individual investor to
set up a cost-effective, diversified portfolio that will help generate returns to
meet long-term financial goals. While it may be easier to get started in mutual
funds than in other types of financial vehicles, you should still do some work
to make sure that the fund you invest in is right for you right now. You also
want to understand the effects of fees and the rights you may have. All the
fun stuff is in the fine print, and here, I help you navigate it.
Doing the research
Before you buy a mutual fund, you want to do some upfront research on the
fund, its investment style, and its historical performance to make sure it fits
your risk and return objectives. How are you going to do that?
84
Book II: Basic Investments: Stocks, Bonds, Mutual Funds, and More 

The fund company will give you some information, and you can find more
yourself. (If you are using a broker or financial planner, he or she should help
with the research.) Different research services, magazines, and newspapers
evaluate mutual funds and offer information on news and trends that affect
mutual fund investors. Here are a few of the many that you should check out:
 The Wall Street Journal: No newspaper covers U.S. finance as thoroughly
as The Wall Street Journal, so its mutual fund information is detailed.
Every quarter, the Journal publishes a special mutual funds section.
Almost every day, it publishes news about funds. And its Web site,
www.wsj.com, includes searchable databases and screens that can help
you make fund decisions.
 Morningstar: Morningstar is an investment research company that makes
its data available to investors at its Web site, www.morningstar.com. The
company was founded to cover mutual funds, and it continues to offer
thorough news and research, including rankings of fund performance
relative to the market and relative to the funds’ investment style.
 Lipper: Although its services are primarily for fund companies, not for
individual investors, Lipper (www.lipper.com) has news and performance
information that you may find useful.
The goal of investing is to buy low and sell high. Unfortunately, many mutual
fund investors get this all wrong: they chase return. They buy the fund that
was last year’s top-performing fund in the top-performing sector, hoping that
the performance will continue; inevitably, they buy at the very high and watch
the fund go down. When evaluating performance, look for a fund and fund
manager who offer consistent performance relative to their sector, not relative
to the market as a whole. Sometimes, the right fund to buy is one that performed
poorly last year.
Reading the prospectus
Under Federal law, anyone soliciting your money for a mutual fund must give
you a prospectus, which is a legal document describing how the fund will
invest its money, listing all the fees, and laying out any rights you may have.
Your financial advisor will give you a prospectus when making fund recom-
mendations, and fund companies that sell shares directly to investors will
put the prospectus on their Web sites.
It will look dull. You will be tempted to push it aside to read later, and of
course, “later” will never arrive. Instead, pull it out and take a look. Once you
read it, you’ll understand the mutual fund better and have a good sense of
whether or not it is a good one for your situation.
Although you should read the whole thing, pay particular attention to two
sections: the fees and the share classes.
85
Chapter 3: Getting to Know Mutual Funds
Book II
Basic
Investments:

Bonds,
Mutual
Funds, 
and More

Fees
All mutual funds charge fees, but some charge higher fees than others. You
need to know what they are to see if you are getting your money’s worth.
These fall into several categories:
 Management fees: Management fees go to the investment advisor to
cover the costs of research services and the salaries of the investment
analysts and portfolio managers who work on the fund. In general, these
fees will be higher for actively-managed equity funds and lower for bond
funds and index funds.
 Distribution charges, loads, and 12b-1 fees: These fees, described ear-
lier in the chapter, compensate the fund and brokers and financial plan-
ners who recommend it for their sales and advisory services.
 Other expenses: These include legal costs, auditing fees, and fees paid
to fund directors, and they are usually quite low.
When these costs are added together, you end up with the expense ratio,
which is the total percentage of the fund that is charged to expenses each
year. Expenses come off the top to reduce your performance, so in general,
the lower the expense ratio, the better for you. However, there are funds that
perform well enough to justify a high expense ratio, so be sure to consider
the expense ratio along with the performance.
Share classes
Many mutual fund companies divide their portfolio up into different classes
of shares. Every investor buys into the same underlying investments, but
holders of different share classes are charged different fees and may have
different rights for reinvestment and redemption. For example, investors who
buy shares directly from the fund buy one class of shares, those who work
with a financial planner buy a different class, and those who are buying
shares through a qualified retirement plan at work buy yet another class.
When you read the prospectus, make sure you check the expenses and fea-
tures for the share class that applies to you.
Making the investment
So how do you actually make an investment in a mutual fund? Well, if you are
buying shares from the fund company directly, you fill out a paper form and
mail in a check, or you fill out an online form and transfer money from your
bank account. If you buy from a broker or financial planner, the process is
similar, but you may be transferring money from your brokerage account or
writing the check to the planning firm.
86
Book II: Basic Investments: Stocks, Bonds, Mutual Funds, and More 

After you make that initial investment, you may want to consider adding
more money to the fund. You can do this by simply writing another check or
making another transfer from your bank account. Or, you can set up an auto-
matic withdrawal program where the fund company takes a set amount of
money from your bank account every month. That way, you never even con-
sider spending the money.
I think the main advantage of an automatic withdrawal program is that it
forces you to take care of your own financial needs and to spend less money
than you make now. Sure, some months you are buying shares at higher
prices than other months, but over the long run, the consistent investment
habit should pay off handsomely for you.
Handling the taxes
Mutual funds themselves are exempt from paying federal taxes. Neat, huh?
But there’s a catch: The funds push the tax obligations on to you.
Now, if your mutual fund investment is part of such qualified retirement plans
as IRAs or 401(k)s, you won’t have to pay taxes on the fund until you with-
draw the money, if you even have to then. (It depends on how your plan is set
up, and that information is beyond the scope of this chapter!) Many qualified
college savings plans that use mutual funds have similar tax benefits, so
investigate those before you open the account.
If your mutual fund investment is not part of a retirement or college account,
you’ll probably have to pay taxes on the fund’s income and capital gains. If
you do, in January the mutual fund company will send you a year-end tax
form that tells you the fund’s dividends and its capital gains distributions. If
the fund had any of these, you will need to put the amounts on your own tax
return and pay the taxes accordingly.
When you cash in shares in the fund, you’ll trigger another tax event, which
is the capital gain. In general, this is the percentage change between the net
asset value when you bought the fund and the net asset value when you sold
the fund, and your fund company will probably send you a form before your
tax return is due telling you how much of a gain you have. (You may also
have a capital loss, in which case, you’ll likely qualify for a tax write-off.)
These taxes may not be onerous; right now in the United States, the tax rate
on dividends and long-term capital gains is just 15 percent. Of course, this
could well change when you are doing your taxes, so be sure to check on the
most recent rates and regulations before April 15 of whatever year you are in.

The ABCs of ETFs
In This Chapter
 Understanding what ETFs are and how they differ from mutual funds
 Knowing the key steps in purchasing ETFs
 Considering some of your ETF choices
T
here are, no doubt, a good number of pinstriped ladies and gentlemen in
and around Wall Street who froth heavily at the mouth when they hear
the words exchange-traded fund. In a world of very pricey investment products
and very lucratively paid investment-product salespeople, ETFs are the
ultimate killjoys.
Since their arrival on the investment scene in the early 1990s, more than 600
ETFs have been created, and they have grown faster in asset accumulation
than any other investment product. And that is a good thing. ETFs have allowed
the average American investment opportunities that do not involve shelling
out fat commissions or paying layers of ongoing, unnecessary fees. And
they’ve saved investors oodles and oodles in taxes.
Hallelujah.
Defining ETFs
Just as a deed shows that you have ownership of a house, and a share of
common stock certifies ownership in a company, a share of an ETF represents
ownership (most typically) in a basket of company stocks. Originally, ETFs
were developed to mirror various indexes:
 The SPDR 500 (ticker SPY) represents stocks from the S&P 500, an index
of the 500 largest companies in the United States.
 The DIAMONDS Trust Series 1 (ticker DIA) represents the 30 underlying
stocks of the Dow Jones Industrial Average index.
 The NASDAQ-100 Trust Series 1, otherwise known as Qubes (ticker
QQQQ), represents the 100 stocks of the NASDAQ-100 Index.

Since ETFs were first introduced, many others, tracking all kinds of things,
have emerged.
Okay, so why buy a basket of stocks rather than individual stock? Quick
answer: You’ll sleep better. Compared to the world of individual stocks, the
stock market as a whole is as smooth as a morning lake. If you’re not espe-
cially keen on roller coasters, then you are advised to put your nest egg into
not one stock, not two, but many. If you have a few million sitting around,
hey, no problem diversifying. Maybe individual stocks are for you. But for
most of us commoners, the only way to effectively diversify is with ETFs or
mutual funds (which you can read about in Chapter 3 of this book).
Advantages of ETFs
Mutual funds also represent baskets of stocks or bonds, but ETFs offer quite
a few advantages that mutual funds don’t. Table 4-1 compares ETFs and
mutual funds (with stocks thrown in for good measure), and the following
sections explain the key differences — and advantages — in more detail.

Lower fees
In the world of mutual funds, the average management fee at present, according
to Morningstar, is 1.67 percent (of the account balance) annually. That may
not sound like a lot of money, but it is a very substantial sum. In the world of
ETFs, the expenses are much, much lower, averaging 0.40 percent, and many
of the more traditional domestic indexed ETFs cost no more than 0.20 percent
a year in management fees. A handful are under 0.10 percent.
Lower capital gains taxes
Unless your money is in a tax-advantaged retirement account, making money
in the markets means that you have to fork something over to Uncle Sam at
year’s end. Before there were ETFs, individual securities had a big advantage
over funds in that you were only required to pay capital gains taxes when you
actually enjoyed a capital gain. With mutual funds, that isn’t so. The fund
itself may enjoy a capital gain by selling off an appreciated stock, but you pay
the capital gains tax regardless of whether you sell and regardless of whether
the share price of the mutual fund increased or decreased since the time you
bought it.
Because ETFs are index-based, there is generally little turnover to create
capital gains. To boot, ETFs are structured in a way that insulates shareholders
from having to pay capital gains tax, as mutual fund shareholders must often
do, when other shareholders cash in their chips.
What you see is what you get
A key to building a successful portfolio, right up there with low costs and tax
efficiency, is diversification. You cannot diversify optimally unless you know
exactly what’s in your portfolio. With a mutual fund, you often have little idea
of what stocks (if any) the fund manager is holding. When you buy an ETF,
you get complete transparency. You know exactly what you are buying. No
matter what the ETF, you can see on the prospectus or on the ETF provider’s
Web site (or on any number of independent financial Web sites) a complete
picture of the ETF’s holdings.
Index advantage
Index funds, which buy and hold a fixed collection of stocks or bonds, consis-
tently outperform actively managed funds. Here are some reasons that index
funds (both mutual funds and ETFs) are hard to beat:
 They typically carry much lower management fees, sales loads, or
redemption charges.
 Hidden costs — trading costs and spread costs — are much lower when
little trading is done.
 They don’t have cash sitting around idle as the manager waits for what
he thinks is the right time to enter the market.

Other things to know about ETFs
Okay, so on the plus side of ETFs we have ultra-low management expenses,
super tax efficiency, transparency, and a lot of fancy trading opportunities,
such as shorting, if you are so inclined. What about the negatives? Here are
some other facts about ETFs that you should consider before parting with
your precious dollars.
Calculating commissions
You have to pay a commission every time you buy and sell an ETF. Here’s the
good news: Trading commissions for stocks and ETFs (it’s the same commis-
sion for either) have been dropping faster than the price of desktop computers.
What once would have cost you a bundle, now — if you trade online, which
you definitely should — is really pin money, perhaps as low as $4 a trade.
However, you can’t simply ignore trading commissions. They aren’t always
that low, and even $4 a pop can add up.
Moving money in a flash
The fact that ETFs can be traded throughout the day like stocks makes them,
unlike mutual funds, fair game for day-traders and institutional wheeler-dealers.
For the rest of us common folk, there isn’t much about the way that ETFs are
bought and sold that makes them especially valuable. Indeed, the ability to
trade throughout the day may make you more apt to do so, perhaps selling or
92
Book II: Basic Investments: Stocks, Bonds, Mutual Funds, and More 
Why the big boys prefer ETFs
When ETFs were first introduced, they were
primarily of interest to institutional traders —
insurance companies, hedge fund people,
banks — who often have investment needs
considerably more complicated than yours and
mine.
Trading in large lots: Prior to the introduction of
ETFs, there was no way for a trader to instanta-
neously buy or sell, in one fell swoop, hundreds
of stocks or bonds. Because they trade both
during market hours and, in some cases, after
market hours, ETFs made that possible.
Institutional investors also found other things to
like about ETFs. For example, ETFs are often used
to quickly put cash to productive use or to fill
gaps in a portfolio by allowing immediate expo-
sure to an industry sector or geographic region.
Savoring the versatility: ETFs, unlike mutual
funds, can also be purchased with limit, market,
or stop-loss orders, taking away the uncertainty
involved with placing a buy order for a mutual
fund and not knowing what price you’re going
to get until several hours after market close.
And because ETFs can be sold short, they pro-
vide an important means of risk management. If,
for example, the stock market takes a dive,
shorting ETFs — selling them now at a locked-
in price with an agreement to purchase them
back (cheaper) later on — may help keep a
portfolio afloat. For that reason, ETFs have
become a darling of hedge fund managers who
offer the promise of investments that won’t tank
should the stock market tank.

buying on impulse, which (although it can get your endorphins pumping) is
generally not the most profitable investing strategy.
Getting in on the Action
Buying ETFs isn’t all that difficult. You find a brokerage house (or supplier),
open an account, and place an order, either by phone or online. The following
sections have the details.
Choosing a brokerage house
You — you personally — can’t just buy a share of an ETF as you would buy,
say, a negligee. You need someone to actually buy it for you and hold it for
you. That someone is a broker, sometimes referred to as a brokerage house or
a broker-dealer.
Here are the some things you want from any broker who is going to be holding
your ETFs:
 Reasonable prices. Comparing the prices at brokerage houses is anything
but easy because each house identifies its own pricing criteria: Some
base prices on how much money you have in your account or how many
trades you make per quarter; others use that criteria but also consider
the number of shares you trade at any particular point, and so on.
 Good service (they pick up the phone without putting you through voice-
mail hell) and good advice (if you think you’re going to need advice).
 A user-friendly Web site (or, if you like doing business with real human
beings, a service center near you).
 Incentives for opening an account, which can run the gamut from a certain
number of free trades to laptop computers.
The following sections give an overview of some of the major brokerage
houses and a brief look at their pricing. Before choosing, always look at the
entire brokerage package, which includes not only the price of trades but
total account fees.
The Vanguard Group
At Vanguard, the trading commissions are middle of the road, and the service
is middle of the road. What really shines about Vanguard is its broad array of
top-rate index mutual funds. I know, I know, this is a chapter about ETFs. But
index mutual funds and ETFs are close cousins, and sometimes it makes a lot
of sense to have both in a portfolio. If you do wish to hold Vanguard index

mutual funds alongside your ETFs, Vanguard is a logical place to hold them
because you can buy and sell Vanguard funds, provided you don’t do it often,
at no charge. You can find Vanguard at www.vanguard.com or 800-992-8327.
Fidelity Investments
Fidelity has great service, and the price of trades is competitive. Fidelity also
has some excellent low-cost index funds of its own, which you may wish to
keep alongside your ETF portfolio. And the Fidelity Web site has some really
good tools — some of the best available — for analyzing your portfolio and
researching new investments. You can find Fidelity at www.fidelity.com or
800-343-3548.
T. Rowe Price
This Baltimore-based shop has several claims to fame, including its bend-
over-backward friendliness to small investors and its plethora of really fine
financial tools, especially for retirement planning, available to all customers
at no cost. The price of trading is a wee bit higher than average. The service
is excellent (reps tend to be very chummy). Go to www.troweprice.com or
call 800-225-5132.
TD AMERITRADE
The trading prices at TD are just about middle of the pack, and the service is
reputedly quite high. The Web site has a very clean and crisp feel to it. On the
down side (in my opinion, of course), the TD culture and many of the articles
on the Web site promote frequent trading, as opposed to, say, Vanguard,
where the culture is decidedly more buy-and-hold. Find TD at www.tdameri
trade.com or 800-454-9272.

What happens if your brokerage house collapses?
Brokerage houses, as part of their registration
process with the federal government, are auto-
matically insured through the Securities
Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC). Each
individual investor’s securities are protected up
to $500,000 should the brokerage house go belly
up. Larger brokerage houses generally carry
supplemental insurance that protects cus-
tomers’ account balances beyond the half-mil-
lion that SIPC covers. TD AMERITRADE, for
example, has insurance through Lloyd’s of
London that protects each customer’s account
up to $150 million.
Note: Neither SIPC coverage nor any kind of
supplemental insurance will protect the value
of your account from a market downfall! For
additional information on SIPC, you can order
the free brochure by calling 1-800-934-4448 or
checking out its Web site at www.sipc.org.

ShareBuilder
At an unheard-of $4 a trade, or even less if you’re willing to pay a monthly fee,
you can’t beat ShareBuilder for price. The catch is that you have to commit
to regular trades. You need to make trades (investing as little as $25) once a
week or once a month. Find out more at www.sharebuilder.com or 800-747-2537.
Other major brokerage houses
Here are a few more to consider:
 Charles Schwab: 866-232-9890; www.schwab.com. I’ve never liked
Schwab, because of its high trading costs, but just as I was writing this
chapter, the firm lowered its fees across the board.
 E*TRADE: 800-387-2331; www.etrade.com. Not only can you house your
ETFs with E*TRADE, but you can refinance the mortgage on your house,
as well.
 TIAA-CREF: 800-842-2776; www.tiaa-cref.org. I’ve heard pretty good
things about TIAA, but I can’t work with them directly because I’m not a
teacher. This brokerage house works only with people who have chalk
under their nails. (If you’re married to someone with chalk under the
nails, you qualify, too.)
Opening an account
When you open an account with a brokerage house. you’ll be asked a zillion
questions:
 Retirement or non-retirement account? If you want a retirement
account, you need to specify what kind (IRA? Roth IRA? SEP?).
 Margin account or cash account? A margin account is somewhat similar
to a checking account with overdraw protection. It means that you can
borrow from the account or make purchases of securities (such as ETFs,
but generally not mutual funds) without actually having any cash to pay
for them on the spot. Cool, huh?
Unless you have a gambling addiction, go with margin. You never know
when you may need a quick and potentially tax-deductible loan. But,
before you blithely begin to buy on margin, read the next paragraph for
dire warnings!
Margin buying is very dangerous business. The stock market is risky
enough. Don’t ever compound that risk by borrowing money to invest.
You may wind up losing not only your nest egg but your home. In
addition, the brokerage house can usually change the rate of interest
you’re paying without notice, and if your investments dip below a certain
percentage of your margin loan, the brokerage house can sell your stocks
and bonds from right under you. Margin only with great caution.

 Beneficiaries and titling (or registration)? Be certain that who you name
is who you want to receive your money if you die. Beneficiary designations
supercede your will.
 Your employment, your wealth, and your risk tolerance? Don’t sweat
them! Federal securities regulations require brokerage houses to know
something about their clients, but honestly, I don’t think anyone ever
looks at the personal section of the forms.
Placing an order to buy
After your account is in place, you’re ready to buy your first ETF. ETFs are
usually traded just as stocks are traded. Same commissions. Mostly the same
rules. Same hours (generally 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., Manhattan Island time).
Through your brokerage house, you can buy 1, 2, or 10,000 shares.
Most brokerage houses give you a choice: Call in your order, or do it yourself
online. Calling is typically much more expensive; place all your orders online.
If you need help, a representative of the brokerage house will walk you
through the process step-by-step — at no expense to you.
Keep in mind when trading ETFs that the cost of the trades, if substantial
enough, can nibble seriously into your holdings. To avoid such nibbling,
don’t trade often (buy and hold, buy and hold, buy and hold!) and don’t
bother with ETFs if the trade is going to cost you more than half of 1 percent.
Managing risk with ETFs
Asking how risky, or how lucrative, ETFs are is like trying to judge a soup
knowing nothing about the soup itself, only that it is served in a blue china
bowl. The bowl — or the ETF — doesn’t create the risk; what’s inside it does.
Thus stock and real estate ETFs tend to be more volatile than bond ETFs.
Short-term bond ETFs are less volatile than long-term bond ETFs. Small-stock
ETFs are more volatile than large-stock ETFs. And international ETFs often
see more volatility than U.S. ETFs.
To minimize risk and maximize return, diversify. Include both stocks and
bonds and both domestic and international holdings in your portfolio. You
also need to diversify the domestic stock part of a portfolio, and that part’s a
bit trickier since not even the experts agree on how to accomplish that. Two
competing methods predominate, and either is fine (as is a mixture of both
for those with good-sized portfolios):
96
Book II: Basic Investments: Stocks, Bonds, Mutual Funds, and More 

 Divide the portfolio into domestic and foreign, and then into different
styles: large cap, small cap, mid cap, value, and growth.
 Divide the portfolio up by industry sector: healthcare, utilities, energy,
financials, and so on.
Exploring ETF Options Galore
As of this writing, more than 600 ETFs are available. To help you wade
through the choices, the following sections introduce a few that may be
worth a look, divided according to style or type of ETF.
Today, all competent investment pros develop their portfolios with at least
some consideration given to the cap size and growth or value orientation of
their stock holdings. Capitalization or cap refers to the combined value of all
shares of a company’s stock. The following divisions are generally accepted:
 Large caps: Companies with over $5 billion in capitalization
 Mid caps: Companies with $1 billion to $5 billion in capitalization
 Small caps: Companies with $250 million to $1 billion in capitalization
Anything from $50 million to $250 million would usually be deemed a micro
cap. And your local pizza shop, if it were to go public, might be called a nano
cap (con aglio). There are no nano cap ETFs. For all the other categories,
there are ETFs to your heart’s content.
Blended options for large cap exposure
All the expense ratios, average cap sizes, price/earnings ratios, and top five

Diminutive dazzlers: Small value ETFs
Look at the list of some the top ten companies represented in the Vanguard
Small Value ETF and you probably won’t recognize them. If you wanted to
pick one of these companies to sink a wad of cash into, I would tell you that
you’re crazy. But if you wanted to sink that cash into the entire small value
index, well, that’s another matter. Assuming you can handle some risk, your
odds of making money are pretty darned good — at least if history is our guide.
Whatever your total allocation to domestic small cap stocks, I recommend
that 60 to 75 percent of that amount be allocated to small value.

Bond ETFs
For the most part, bonds are less volatile than stocks, and their returns over
time tend to be less. But they’re a key stabilizing force in a portfolio (refer to
Chapter 2 of this book to find out why).
Treasuries: Uncle Sam’s IOUs
If the creator/issuer of a bond is a national government, the issue is called a
sovereign bond. The vast majority of sovereign bonds sold in the United
States are Uncle Sam’s own Treasuries.
iShares Lehman 1–3 Year Treasury Bond Fund (SHY)
Indexed to: The Lehman Brothers 1–3 Year U.S. Treasury Index, an index
tracking the short-term sector of the United States Treasury market. The fund

iShares Lehman 7–10 Year Treasury Bond Fund (IEF)

The fund uses a representative sampling — typically around 20 individual
bond issues.
Expense ratio: 0.15 percent
Current yield: 4.40 percent
Average weighted maturity: 8.4 years
iShares Lehman 20+ Year Treasury Bond Fund (TLT)
Indexed to: The Lehman Brothers 20+ Year U.S. Treasury Index, an index

uses a representative sampling — typically around 15 individual bond issues.
Expense ratio: 0.15 percent
Current yield: 4.73 percent
Average weighted maturity: 23.1 years
Inflation-protected securities
Technically, U.S. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) are Treasuries, but
they play a distinctly different role in your portfolio than the other Treasuries
do. The gig with TIPS is this: They pay you only a nominal amount of interest
(currently about 2.5 percent), but they also kick in an adjustment for inflation.
So, for example, if inflation is running at 4 percent, all things being equal,
your TIPs will yield 6.5 percent.
iShares Lehman TIPS Bond Fund (TIP)
Indexed to: The Lehman Brothers U.S. Treasury Inflation-protected sector of
the United States Treasury market. The fund uses a representative sampling
of roughly 15 bond issues.
Expense ratio: 0.20 percent
Current yield: 6.7 percent
Average weighted maturity: 10.5 years
Corporate bond ETFs
Logically enough, corporations issue bonds called corporate bonds, and you
can buy a dizzying array of them with varying maturities, yields, and ratings.
Or you can buy a representative sampling through an ETF.

mance of the total U.S. investment grade bond market, including both govern-
ment bonds and the highest quality corporate bonds. More than 6,000 bonds
are in the index, but AGG uses a representative sampling of roughly 120 hold-
ings. The average credit quality — AAA — indicates that there is very little
chance any of the bonds in the index will default. (Even if one or two did,
with 120 holdings, it wouldn’t kill you.)
Expense ratio: 0.20 percent
Current yield: 4.6 percent
Average credit quality: AAA
Average weighted maturity: 6.9 years
Real estate investing (REITs)
In a nutshell, real estate investment trusts, popularly known as REITs (rhymes
with “Pete’s”), are companies that hold portfolios of properties, such as
shopping malls, office buildings, hotels, amusement parks, or timberland. Or
they may hold certain real estate related assets, such as commercial mort-
gages. Via a handful of ETFs, you can buy a bevy of REITs.
The tax efficiency of ETFs will help cap any capital gains you enjoy on your
REIT fund, but it can’t do anything to diminish the taxes you’ll be paying on
the dividends. For that reason, all REIT funds — ETFs or otherwise — are
best kept in tax-advantaged retirement accounts.

be 20, 25, or even 30 years of retirement.
Annuities will be the answer, the experts decided. Annuities will help Baby
Boomers (especially those without traditional pensions) protect their savings
and/or convert it into guaranteed lifelong income. If Boomers don’t buy
annuities, the wonks predict, they’ll blow their retirement money on bass
boats, golf balls, spa makeovers, and ranch land in Wyoming.
It’ll be a few years before anyone will know whether these prognosticating
scolds were right, but annuities can be a viable investment option for folks
who want to protect their income in their later years. This chapter gives you
an overview of what annuities are, what they offer (both good and bad), and
the general types of annuities you can choose from.
Introducing Annuities
You may think of annuities as the duck-billed platypuses of the financial world.
They are neither pure investments nor pure insurance. Instead, they have
one foot in the investment world and one foot in the insurance world.
 An annuity is an investment in the sense that you give a sum of money to
a financial institution with the hope that you’ll get back more than what
you put in. Your investment — or, in this case, a premium — can range in

size from $2,000 to over $2 million. The financial institution — usually an
insurance company — puts your money in its own general account (if
you bought a fixed annuity) or in what’s called a separate account (if
you bought a variable annuity).
 An annuity is insurance in the sense that a small portion of your premium
buys a guarantee. The exact nature of the guarantee varies with the type
of annuity. In fixed annuity contracts, for instance, your rate of return is
guaranteed for a certain number of years. In the latest variable annuity
contracts, you can lock in a guaranteed rate of return and get a guaran-
teed payout in retirement. With an immediate annuity, you get guaranteed
income.
In fact, guaranteeing you a pension-like income for life is what annuities do
better than any other financial product. There is no more efficient tool for
converting a specific sum of money into a monthly income that lasts as long
you live — even if you live to 105.
Annuities are all about tradeoffs between risk and return. The guarantees
reduce your risk of losing money. But the fee you pay for the guarantee
generally reduces the potential growth of your investment. (That’s not always
the case, but the principle holds true: Lower risk brings lower returns.)
Looking at how annuities work
Annuities are intended to help you save for retirement and supplement your
retirement income. Various types of annuities can make your retirement more
secure by helping you do the following:
 Save for retirement: Before you retire, fixed deferred annuities — which
include CD-type annuities, market value–adjusted fixed annuities, and
indexed annuities — allow you to earn a specific (or adjustable) rate of
interest on your money for a specific number of years, tax-deferred.
They’re also a safe place to park money during retirement.
 Invest for retirement: Before you retire, variable deferred annuities —
baskets of mutual funds, essentially — allow you to invest your savings
in stocks or bonds while deferring taxes on all the capital gains, dividends,
and interest that mutual funds usually throw off every year.
 Distribute your savings: Most Baby Boomers who retire with six-figure
balances in their employer-sponsored retirement plans won’t know how
fast or slow to spend their savings. An immediate annuity or a variable
deferred annuity with “guaranteed lifetime benefits” can provide structure
to the process.
110
Book II: Basic Investments: Stocks, Bonds, Mutual Funds, and More 

 Insure you against longevity risk: Just as life insurance insures you and
your family from the risk of dying early, an income annuity or an advanced
life deferred annuity (ALDA) can insure you against the risk of living so
long that you run out of money.
 Manage your taxes: Everybody with a big 401(k) or 403(b) plan will
retire with a massive income tax debt to the government. A life income
annuity allows you spread that tax liability evenly across your entire
retirement.
To encourage saving, Uncle Sam lets you defer taxes on the growth of your
investment in an annuity. To discourage you from spending your savings before
retirement, the IRS exacts a penalty for withdrawals taken from annuities (as
well as from other tax-deferred investments) before you reach age 591⁄2.
Getting to know the participants
Every annuity has an owner, an annuitant, beneficiaries, and an issuer.
 The owner: The owner of an annuity is the person who pays the premiums,
signs the application, and agrees to abide by the terms of the contract.
The owner decides who the other parties of the contract will be. Depending
on the type of contract owned or what stage it is in, the owner can
withdraw money or even sell the annuity. The owner is liable for any
taxes that are due.
 The annuitant: The annuitant is the person on whose life expectancy
the annuity payments will be calculated. If and when the owner decides
to start taking a guaranteed lifetime income from the annuity, the size of
the annuity payments will be based on the annuitant’s age and life
expectancy — not the owner’s! (Although, in most cases, the owner and
annuitant are the same person.)
 The beneficiaries: On the contract application, you need to name an
owner’s beneficiary and an annuitant’s beneficiary. The owner and
annuitant can be each other’s beneficiary, which can help keep things
simple, but no one can be his or her own beneficiary.
 The issuer: The insurance company that issues the contract and puts
itself on the hook for any guarantees in the contract is the issuer (also
sometimes called the carrier).
You should always look for an issuer that’s rated “excellent,” “superior,”
or “very good” by the ratings agencies, such as A.M. Best and Fitch. A
high rating suggests — but doesn’t guarantee — that the issuer will ful-
fill its promises to you and that you’ll get your money back.

Noting common elements 
of all (or most) annuities
All annuities have a free look period, a death benefit, guarantees, and annuiti-
zation options. Most have surrender periods. Deferred variable annuities
have AUVs, or accumulated unit values. The following list provides basic
information about these elements:
 Free look period: Whoever buys an annuity has between 10 and 30 days
after receiving the contract in the mail to cancel the contract. Some
immediate annuity contracts offer a rider that lets you cancel your con-
tract within the first six months. Some fixed annuity contracts let you
opt out during a brief “window” at the beginning of each contract year.
 Death benefit: In most annuities, the owner and annuitant are the same
person. If that person dies, the insurance company pays a death benefit
to his or her beneficiary. The death benefit may be more than simply the
value of the contract when the owner dies. Depending on whether the
owner bought the standard death benefit or an enhanced death benefit,
the death benefit may be equal to the original premium or equal to the
maximum value of the contract on any contract anniversary.
 Guarantees: Annuities offer one or more of the following guarantees: a
guarantee of a particular return; a guarantee against loss of principal; a
guarantee that, if the owner dies during a bear market, his or her heirs
won’t suffer financially; or a guarantee of lifetime income. This is one of the
reasons that annuities cost more than investments. You’re paying for the
guarantee.
 Annuitization option: Whether you do so or not (and more than 90 percent
of owners do not), all deferred annuities allow you to annuitize. To annuitize
is to relinquish control over your money to the issuer in return for a
guarantee that the issuer will pay you a fixed or variable income for 
a specific period, for the rest of your life, or as long as either you and
your spouse are living.
 Surrender period: Most, but not all, annuities have surrender periods
during which the issuer may levy a contingent deferred sales charge, or
CDSC, if you withdraw too much of your money from the contract too
soon. All deferred fixed annuities have CDSCs, and so do most deferred
variable annuities that are purchased from agents or brokers.
 Accumulation unit value (AUV): The most important unit of measure for
mutual fund shares is the net accumulation value, or NAV. After the financial
markets close every business day, when the traders go home and the final
prices are fixed for the evening (except for after-hours trading), a mutual
fund manager tallies up the value of all his investments and divides those
millions or billions of dollars by the number of mutual fund shares
outstanding. The result is the NAV.
112
Book II: Basic Investments: Stocks, Bonds, Mutual Funds, and More 

In the parallel universe of deferred variable annuities, mutual funds are
called subaccounts and NAVs are called accumulation unit values (AUVs).
A subaccount and a mutual fund may be managed by the same manager
and invest in the same securities, but they will have different daily values.
Certain fees are deducted every day from the subaccounts that are not
deducted from the mutual fund accounts. Also, the mutual fund makes
taxable distributions and the subaccount does not. Thus the NAV of a
mutual fund and the AUV of a variable annuity are typically different, even
when they own the same basket of securities.
Deciding If An Annuity Is Right for You
Annuities aren’t for everyone. The very poor or the ultra-rich, for example,
won’t find much use for them. Those lucky devils who can look forward to
both Social Security and a handsome company pension in retirement probably
won’t need the extra guaranteed income that annuities offer. Cockeyed optimists,
who buy every dip in the Dow and revel in volatility, won’t bother with annuities
because annuities can blunt or buffer their potential returns.
Nor is every type of annuity right for everybody. But certain annuities will
appeal to certain types of people:
 People in high tax brackets often like deferred annuities, because they
can contribute virtually any amount of money to an annuity and defer
taxes on the gains for as long as they like.
 Middle-class couples in their 50s, earning $100,000 or less, with savings
of $250,000 or more but no pension, should like income annuities.
There’s a 50 percent chance that one of the two will live to age 90, and
that’s when income annuities provide the most value.
 Pessimists — otherwise known as Cassandras, doomsayers, and bears —
who believe that the gigantic, highly leveraged house of cards (i.e., our
financial system) might collapse at any time, should like the guarantees
that annuities provide.
 Women are much more likely to need annuities than men. They live
significantly longer and are therefore at greater risk of running out of
savings. Single or widowed women are more likely to be poor in old age
than single or widowed men. The retirement financing crisis that’s looming
in all the developed countries of the world will have its greatest impact
on women.

Evaluating the pluses
Annuities offer a number of benefits, such as tax deferral, unlimited contribu-
tions, and the opportunity for guaranteed income. Some of these benefits are
a result of federal tax law. Others come from the fact that annuities are insur-
ance products as well as investments. Different types of annuities offer differ-
ent types of advantages, as the following sections explain.
Guaranteeing income after age 591⁄2
Annuities are the only financial product that can guarantee you an income for
life (or two lives) or for a specific number of years. All annuities offer you the
option to convert savings to income, and new types of annuities are making it
easier to buy future income.
Deferring taxes
When you buy a deferred annuity, you can let the money grow and not pay
taxes on the growth until years later — ordinarily after you reach age 591⁄2.
This is called tax deferral, and the IRS allows it in order to encourage you to
save for retirement. Assuming that your tax rate during retirement will be
lower than your tax rate while you’re still working, you’ll ultimately pay less
in taxes. (Note: You can’t deduct your contributions to a deferred annuity
from your taxable income, the way you can deduct contributions to a tradi-
tional IRA or employer-sponsored retirement account.)
The more you can afford to put in an annuity, the longer you can leave it
there, and the higher your tax bracket today (relative to what it will be in
retirement), the more you can benefit from tax deferral.
Allowing unlimited contributions
You can contribute as much as you want to a deferred annuity. Most insur-
ance companies reserve the right to review contributions over $1 million in
advance — to prevent large-scale money laundering, in part — but they don’t
specifically discourage large deposits.
Reducing investment risk
You’ll often hear it said that annuities are contracts, not investments. There’s
an important difference between the two. When you invest in a bond mutual
fund, for instance, you can lose money if interest rates go up and the prices
of the fund’s existing bonds fall. Investments involve risk. When you put your
savings in a fixed deferred annuity, there’s virtually no risk. Your contract
guarantees you a specific return for at least one year and maybe more, and it
promises that, no matter what, you won’t lose money and you’ll make a
certain minimum amount. Contracts involve guarantees.
114
Book II: Basic Investments: Stocks, Bonds, Mutual Funds, and More 

Paying death benefits
When you buy a deferred annuity, you pay a small annual fee for a death ben-
efit. This benefit ensures that, if you die while the annuity contract is in force,
your beneficiaries will receive a certain minimum. The more you pay for the
death benefit (you may have as many as three or four options), the richer the
benefit.
Distributing survivorship credits
The concept of mortality pooling forms the basis of a classic life annuity (also
known as an income annuity or immediate annuity). A cohort of 65-year-olds
buys life annuities, and each receives — spread more or less evenly over their
lifetimes — a payout consisting of three components: returned principal,
investment gains, and a share of the money relinquished by those who die
before them. It’s simply the insurance principle at work.
If you own an income annuity, to the extent that you’ll rely on all or part of
your savings to generate basic income in retirement (as opposed to relying
on it for splurges or reserving it for your children or other beneficiaries), and
to the extent that you’re “at risk” for living a very long life, mortality pooling
is arguably the most efficient way to maximize your retirement income and to
guarantee an income for life.
Obtaining peace of mind!
People who own income annuities say they like the security that comes from
a regular paycheck — just as they like the peace of mind that Social Security
and traditional company pensions can provide. When proposals were made
to change and possibly undermine the Social Security system a few years ago,
many middle class people protested. Most people don’t like the ongoing
disappearance of traditional pensions either, but they can’t do much about it.
Annuities can provide the safety and security that many people yearn for in
retirement.
Providing a retirement distribution method
You may be one of the millions of Americans who, after compiling a six-figure
nest egg in your employer’s retirement plan, don’t know how to begin converting
it into an income. An income annuity, which pays out a blend of principal,
earnings, and survivorship credits more or less evenly over your entire
future, is a smart way to turn your savings into income.

Recognizing the minuses
For every one of the benefits of annuities, there’s a corresponding drawback.
When you buy an annuity, you’re usually buying a guarantee, and guarantees
always cost money and usually come with restrictions written in type that’s
small enough to require bifocals or reading glasses. It’s to be expected.
You already own an income annuity
Anyone who has worked in the United States and paid payroll taxes for a
sufficient number of years owns an annuity provided by the Social Security
Administration. Although it is financed differently from individually purchased
annuities and pays proportionately more to those in the lower income tax
brackets, Social Security provides almost everyone with a true annuity.
Higher expenses than mutual funds
Although inexpensive products do exist, high fees are very common in the
world of deferred variable annuities — especially if you buy your contract
from a broker or other commission-earning intermediary. The insurance fees,
distribution costs, investment fees, and rider fees can easily amount to more
than 3 percent per year. The average annual expense ratio for variable annu-
ities is about 2.4 percent.
High fees also contribute to the cost of immediate (income-generating) annu-
ities, though the fees are not as apparent because they are built into the price
you pay for your lifelong income stream. Depending on the insurance company’s
costs and perhaps its desire to make a sale, it may charge you from $140,000
to $150,000 for a $1,000-a-month lifelong income that starts at age 65. You
won’t receive an explanation why.
Reduced liquidity and control
Annuities offer guaranteed benefits. Insurance companies can’t provide those
guarantees unless they can count on possessing your money long enough to
collect fees and earn interest on it. For that reason, annuities offer less flexibility
and access to your money (liquidity) than conventional risky investments such
as mutual funds.
Annuity earnings are taxed as ordinary income
Eventually you’ll have to pay income taxes on the gains in your deferred
annuity contract. If your taxable income is higher than about $160,000, 
the annuity profits will be taxed at the rate of 33 or 35 percent. By contrast,
your profit on that single stock or mutual fund that you bought 20 years ago
and sold last year will be taxed at the capital gains rate of only 15 percent.
116
Book II: Basic Investments: Stocks, Bonds, Mutual Funds, and More 

Lack of transparency and moving parts
Insurance is a proverbial “black box.” No one but the managers and actuaries
are privy to the many different formulas and factors that go into the pricing
of products. When an issuer of income annuities offers you, at age 65, $671
per month for life in return for a premium of $100,000, you don’t know how
the carrier arrived at that figure.
Then there are the “moving parts” in deferred annuities. When you buy a
fixed deferred annuity that guarantees a rate for only the first year, you don’t
know exactly what the rate will be during subsequent years. An issuer of
indexed annuities (also known as fixed indexed or equity-indexed annuities)
also reserves the right to change the formula for crediting gains to you.
The benefits of today’s popular deferred variable annuity contracts — which
offer guaranteed lifetime income and access to your principal if you need it —
require some very complex financial engineering and entail many different
restrictions. The rules are described in the prospectus, but they can be
extremely difficult or even impossible for the average person to understand.
Purchasing Annuities
You will probably buy your annuity from a licensed insurance agent, broker,
or financial adviser. Standing directly behind these intermediaries are broker-
age firms (for brokers and financial advisers), marketing organizations (for
independent insurance agents), or the insurance companies themselves (in
the case of career insurance agents). (Note: Insurance agents aren’t licensed
to sell variable annuities.)
The transaction begins when you meet with the agent or broker who discusses
your finances with you. After you choose a suitable product, the agent or
broker will submit the application for approval. You will eventually send the
contract issuer — the insurance company — a check for at least the minimum
amount (every carrier sets its own minimum initial premiums). Then the
carrier sends you your contract. You will have 10 to 30 days to reconsider
your decision and send the contract back for a refund.
Important participants in the annuity food chain include the following:
 Annuity issuers: Only insurance companies issue annuities. There are
hundreds of issuers, but the 25 largest firms — household names like
The Hartford, MetLife, and Prudential — account for about 90 percent of
all annuities sold each year.

Some insurers are publicly owned, and some are mutually owned.
Publicly owned firms are owned by their stockholders, and mutually
owned firms are owned by their customers. The two types may have dif-
ferent cultures and attitudes, and slightly different products. Look for a
company whose view of risk and reward matches your own. Personally, I
like mutual companies — they’re more customer-oriented and not under
pressure to impress Wall Street with ever-larger quarterly earnings.
 Annuity distributors: Distributors include big brokerages (known as
wirehouses) like Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley, as well as indepen-
dent broker-dealers like Raymond James and LPL. Banks like Bank of
America and Wachovia also distribute annuities through their branches.
Distributors serve as middlemen between the carriers and the produc-
ers. In many cases, they employ or supervise producers (see the next
bullet), making sure they comply with insurance and investment laws.
 Annuity producers: Years ago, most insurance companies employed an
army of career agents to represent and sell their products. While companies
like AXA, Ameriprise, MetLife, and others still have these agents, many
annuities are sold by independent agents, brokers, and bank officers.
“Independents” can recommend any annuity they wish. In practice, they
may steer you toward their list of preferred products or carriers. Be
aware that a producer may earn a higher commission or a free trip to
Cancun for selling certain products.
 Direct marketers. If you’re the self-reliant type and you don’t need an
agent or broker to explain annuities to you, you can buy your annuity
direct. Some but not all insurance companies will sell a no-load (that is,
no sales commission) contract directly to you. No-load mutual fund
companies like Vanguard, Fidelity, and T. Rowe Price also sell no-load
annuity contracts directly to the public over the phone or Internet or by
mail. In the case of Vanguard and T. Rowe Price, their contracts are
issued by third-party insurance companies. Relatively few people buy
annuities direct, however.
The Main Types of Annuities
If you prefer a safety net, and if you’re willing to pay for one, you may con-
sider an annuity. This section’s primary purpose is explain the basic annu-
ities options that are available.
Annuities in themselves are neither good nor bad. Like other forms of insurance,
they may or may not seem worth the price. Ultimately, the decision to buy an
annuity or not depends on the amount of financial risk you’re willing to tolerate.
118
Book II: Basic Investments: Stocks, Bonds, Mutual Funds, and More 

Fixed deferred annuities
Years ago, before credit cards and mutual funds, people saved. If they wanted
to buy something big — a house, a diamond, or a dream vacation — they put
money in a savings account, where it earned interest. The money grew, and
when the day of purchase finally arrived, voila — they paid cash. A fixed
annuity is the insurance industry’s version of a savings account. It helps you
save. Technically, fixed annuities are deferred annuities. Their owners defer
their right to convert the annuity’s value to a retirement income stream for at
least several years. In truth, few people ever convert them. Most people use
them to save or to increase the stability of their investment portfolios.
Like all investments, fixed annuities represent a mixture of trade-offs. On the
plus side, they offer the following:
 Safety: Buying a fixed annuity with a multi-year guarantee (MYG) and
holding it for the entire term is a safe, conservative way to grow your
money. It’s even safer than buying a bond or shares in a bond fund,
because a bond’s price or the share prices of a bond fund can fall in
response to rising interest rates.
 Tax deferral: Annuities, like investments that are held in IRAs and 401(k)
plans, grow tax deferred. You earn interest each year, but you don’t receive
a 1099 form in January advising you to report it and pay taxes on it. The
advantage is that your annuity grows faster than it would if taxes were
deducted from it every year.
 Stable rates: When you buy a MYG fixed annuity, you know what interest
rate return you’ll receive and you know exactly what your investment will
be worth at the end of the term. As long as you don’t make withdrawals,
you have complete peace of mind.
 Higher returns when the bond yield curve is steep: A steep bond yield
curve occurs when bonds of longer maturities (ten-year Treasury bonds,
say) pay higher rates of interest than bonds of shorter maturities (a three-
month Treasury bill, for instance). At such times, fixed annuities often pay
higher interest rates than certificates of deposit.
 No probate: It’s hard to get excited about a benefit that you can enjoy
only by dying, but annuities are famous for them. In this case, if you die
while owning a fixed annuity, your money goes straight to the beneficiaries
you named on your contract. The money doesn’t become part of your
estate and therefore doesn’t go through the legal process known as
probate, where creditors and relatives can lay claim to it.
 The option to annuitize: Like all annuity contracts, a fixed annuity can be
converted to a retirement income stream. Although this option is the
defining feature of annuities, few people know about it and even fewer
use it.
119

and More

Fixed annuities also have their fair share of negatives:
 Low liquidity: If you take more than 10 percent of your money out of
your fixed annuity during the surrender period, you’ll pay a charge. You
can avoid charges by buying a fixed annuity with a short surrender
period or by using other sources of cash for emergencies. Contracts
with longer surrender periods typically pay higher rates, but don’t be
lured into tying up your money for longer than you can afford to.
 Uncertain returns: With single-year guarantee fixed annuities, you don’t
know exactly what the interest rate will be after the first year. From what
I have seen of renewal rate histories, the rates on single-year guarantee
contracts either stay the same or decline gradually after the first year.
Rates are especially likely to fall if the annuity offers a first-year bonus.
 Lower returns when the bond yield curve is flat: When the yield curve
is flat — when long-term interest rates are the same as or lower than
short-term rates — you may be able to get a better rate from a certificate
of deposit.
 Federal penalty for early withdrawal: If you withdraw money from a fixed
annuity before you reach the age of 591⁄2, you may have to pay a penalty to
the IRS. The penalty, equal to 10 percent of the earnings withdrawn, is
Uncle Sam’s way of discouraging Americans from using annuities and
other tax-favored investments for anything but saving for retirement.
Early withdrawals from tax-deductible IRAs and employer-sponsored
retirement plans are penalized in a similar way, but in those cases the
entire withdrawal is subject to the 10 percent penalty. However, under
certain circumstances, such as illness, you can withdraw money from 
an annuity before age 591⁄2 without a penalty.
Single-year guarantee fixed annuity
In this type of annuity, the insurance company promises to pay you a certain
rate of interest for one year. Each year, for the rest of the surrender period,
the insurance company can raise or reduce the interest rate it pays you. The
rates after the first year are known as renewal rates.
Single-year guarantee fixed annuities often offer big first-year bonus rates. A
bonus rate is an interest rate that lasts only for the first year. It will be any-
where from 1 to 10 percent higher than the rate your money will earn in any
other year of the contract. After that, the rate generally falls slightly from
year to year, enabling the company to recover the cost of the bonus.
Multi-year guarantee (MYG) fixed annuity
In an MYG fixed annuity, you give a specific amount of money to an insurance
company, and the insurer guarantees that your investment will earn a specific
rate of compound interest for a specific number of years. MYG annuities are
often called CD-type annuities or tax-deferred CDs because they serve the
same purpose as a certificate of deposit.
120
Book II: Basic Investments: Stocks, Bonds, Mutual Funds, and More 

The beauty of MYGs is their transparency: What you see is what you get. You
know the interest rate your money will earn and how long it will earn it. If 
you want to buy a $30,000 boat in ten years, you can plunk down $19,500
today in a ten-year MYG annuity paying 4.5 percent. In ten years you can pay
cash for the boat and have enough left over for dinner for two at the marina.
Market value–adjusted (MVA) fixed annuities
With a market value–adjusted fixed (MVA) annuity, you, not the insurer,
assume the interest rate risk. In return, the insurance company pays you a
slightly higher interest rate than it pays on non-MVA annuities, which are
known as book value annuities.
If you withdraw too much of your money (over 10 percent, in most cases)
from your MVA annuity during the surrender period, typically two things will
happen. First, you’ll pay a surrender charge (a percentage equal to the number
of years left in the surrender period, in many cases). Second, your account
value will either be adjusted downward (if interest rates have risen since you
bought your annuity) or upward (if rates have declined).
In addition to paying higher rates, MVA fixed annuities tend to have longer
terms than other fixed annuities. So, if you want to lock in current interest
rates for a long time, an MVA fixed annuity may be right for you.
Floating rate and pass-through rate contracts
A few fixed annuity contracts offer an interest rate that floats from month to
month. If interest rates go up a bit, you earn a little more that month. If inter-
est rates go down, you earn less. Certain floating-rate fixed annuities will give
you a 30-day window once a year to take withdrawals without charging you a
penalty or a market value adjustment.
You may also come across annuities that offer pass-through rates of interest.
Instead of paying you a fixed rate and keeping the rest of what it earns on its
bonds, the insurance company pays itself a fixed spread — perhaps 2 percent —
and gives you the rest of what it earns. These annuities can be attractive because
there’s no upper limit on the amount of interest you can earn.
In these contracts, the insurance company will typically try for the highest
possible returns by investing in junk bonds. Junk bonds offer higher interest rates
because there’s a risk that the bond’s issuer — the borrower — won’t repay the
lender, which in this case is the insurance company. Typically, a borrower with
weak credit can attract investors (lenders) only by offering a higher interest rate.
Each of these two types of fixed annuities offers the potential for higher returns
than conventional fixed annuities, as well as higher risk. But why add risk to a
fixed annuity, whose principal virtue is safety? If you want more risk (and
potentially more reward), consider investing a larger percentage of your money
in stocks.

Variable annuities
Variable annuities (VAs) are mutual fund investments that have certain
insurance-related guarantees, such as living benefits and death benefits.
Guaranteed living benefits
Guaranteed living benefits (GLBs) are what draw most people to VAs these
days. GLBs can be used as investment insurance or as a retirement income
strategy. Because they can protect you from so-called sequence-of-returns
risk — the chance that a bear market early in your retirement will permanently
wreck your portfolio — they’re worth your attention.
GLBs are designed to let investors have it all: protection from catastrophic
loss, the potential for growth, and the assurance that if they die, their benefi-
ciaries won’t be left empty-handed. There are various kinds of GLBs:
 Guaranteed minimum income benefit (GMIB): This option guarantees
that you can annuitize (convert to a regular income) whichever is greater:
the market value of your investments or a guaranteed minimum amount
based on your principal plus a minimum guaranteed annual growth rate.
 Guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit (GMWB): This option protects
your principal and guarantees that you will receive it in equal installments
(for example, 7 percent of the principal amount per year for 14.3 years)
until it is exhausted.
 Guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit — for life (GMWB for life):
This option guarantees that you can withdraw a certain percentage
(typically 5 percent) of a guaranteed amount (known as the benefit base)
every year for life, even if a market crash wipes out the value of your
investments after payments begin. You can dip into your principal if you
need to, but you may reduce your future annual income by doing so.
GMWBs for life can be confusing because they involve real money and
hypothetical money. There’s your account balance, which is the market
value of your subaccount investments (a value that can move up or
down). That’s real money, which you may withdraw. Then there’s the
guaranteed minimum value or guaranteed benefit base. It is not real money,
and you can’t withdraw it. It is simply the amount on which your 5 percent
annual lifetime withdrawals will be based. Don’t fall into the trap of think-
ing that the guaranteed minimum value or benefit base is your money. 
 Guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit (GMAB): This option guar-
antees that, after a seven- to ten-year investment period, your investments
will not lose money. Some GMABs guarantee a certain amount of growth
over ten years, and a GMAB may be combined with a GMWB for life.
122
Book II: Basic Investments: Stocks, Bonds, Mutual Funds, and More 

 Guaranteed account value (GAV): This option guarantees your principal
over the course of a specific investment period and may automatically
lock in any gains at the end of each quarter or year.
 Guaranteed payout annuity floor (GPAF): This option guarantees that your
monthly income payment will never be less than a certain percentage —
from 85 to 100 percent — of the first payment. (Note: GPAF applies only
to contract owners who annuitize their contracts and opt for a variable
monthly payment for life.)
VA pros and cons
There are several pros and cons of VA ownership that you need to carefully
weigh before deciding on your investment strategy. The pros include:
 Deferred taxes on dividends and capital gains
 Lifetime income options, including annuitization and GLBs
 A death benefit that protects heirs from market losses
 Investment options that provide control over retirement savings
 No limit on the contribution of pre-tax money
The cons of VA ownership include:
 High fees relative to no-load mutual funds, especially if sold by commis-
sioned brokers or agents.
When you add up the insurance fees, fund management fees, death benefit
fees, and rider fees of today’s VAs, you’ll find yourself paying 3 percent a
year, on average. Even as these fees put a safety net below you, they can
act as a significant drag on the earnings of your investments. And you
may end up never even using the benefits you paid for.
 Earnings are taxed as income rather than as capital gains.
 Withdrawals of earnings before age 591⁄2 may be subject to a 10 percent
federal penalty, in addition to income tax.
 Investment risks are usually greater than with fixed-rate annuities.
Immediate income annuities
Income annuities enable you to convert a large sum of cash into a monthly,
quarterly, or annual paycheck. You give the lump sum to a reputable insur-
ance company, and the insurer issues a contract that promises to pay you (or
someone you choose) an income for an agreed-upon length of time. Income
annuities are attractive to many people for two basic reasons: First, they
deliver more income than a comparably safe investment in U.S. government
bonds. Second, they provide an income that you can’t outlive.
123
Chapter 5: Annuities
Book II
Basic
Investments:
Stocks,
Bonds,

Funds, 
and More

In this way, income annuities protect you from timing risk (that just before or
after you start drawing down your savings, a sharp market downturn will take a
huge bite out of your portfolio and increase the chances you’ll run out of money
too soon), investment risk (the possibility that the returns on your portfolio
won’t be enough to support you in retirement), and longevity risk (that you’ll
outlive your income). An income annuity transfers these risks to an insurance
company. In return for your purchase payment — usually $100,000 or more —
you receive an income (monthly, quarterly, or annual) that’s immune to bond
defaults, resistant to stock market crashes, and can last for as long as you live.
A “life” annuity guarantees that you will receive an income as long as you live
(or as long as either you or your spouse is living). But this guarantee
assumes that the insurance company will remain financially strong enough to
meet its obligations for the next 30 years or more. If the insurer fails, your
payments will be in jeopardy. That’s why you must buy your annuity from a
gilt-edged, A-rated company.
The simplest type of income annuity is known as a SPIA (spee-ah). Income from
a SPIA begins no later than one year after you purchase it. When brokers and
advisers talk about SPIAs — and they rarely do — they usually mean annuities
that offer a fixed payment every month. But you can also buy a SPIVA (a single
premium immediate variable annuity) whose payout rate fluctuates with the
stock market.
People tend to be wary of income annuities because they feel that “if I die the
insurance company will get my money.” That’s a healthy fear. But buying an
income annuity doesn’t necessarily mean losing control over all your money,
or even all the money in your annuity. Most issuers of income annuities offer
options that allow you to tailor your annuity to your own needs and comfort
level.
Insurance company actuaries have created a variety of sweeteners to over-
come the public’s historic reluctance to buy life annuities. For instance, you
can decide to keep some of your money in stocks, or you can provide cover-
age for two people. You can arrange to leave something for your heirs. You
can even arrange cost-of-living increases.
In short, there are dozens of possible combinations of options. And each of
them will produce a different monthly payment from the same initial premium.
Keep in mind, however, that you’ll get the highest monthly payment if you
relinquish all control over your money. The more control you retain, the
lower your income will be.
124
Book II: Basic Investments: Stocks, Bonds, Mutual Funds, and More 

Advanced life deferred annuities
This section covers the most intriguing annuity of all: the advanced life
deferred annuity (ALDA), also called pure longevity insurance. Typically
people who purchase an ALDA
 Are between the ages of 50 and 60.
 Use 10 to 30 percent of their retirement savings to fund it.
 Begin receiving guaranteed monthly income at age 80 or 85.
If that sounds like a terrible investment to you, your instincts are spot-on. In
fact, an ALDA isn’t an investment at all. It’s insurance against longevity — the
risk that you may outlive your savings. And because your chance of living
really, really long is only so-so, the insurance companies can afford to make
ALDAs fairly cheap.
The world isn’t quite ready for ALDAs. Not many people have heard of them
let alone purchased one. And as far as I know, only three insurance companies
(MetLife, Hartford Life, and New York Life) currently market them with any
enthusiasm. But, when you crunch the numbers, you see that ALDAs may be
the most cost-effective way to cure one huge retirement headache: figuring
out how much money to put in reserve just in case you happen to live a long,
long time.
If you’re married, take a serious look at ALDAs. Would you buy flood insurance
if your house had a 50 percent chance of being flooded over the next 20 years?
Probably. Well, on average, one member of a couple has a 75 percent chance
of living to age 85 and a 50 percent chance of living to age 90. In short, you or
your spouse will probably be knee-deep in longevity some day.
In a simple, no frills ALDA, your decision to take income at age 85 is unchange-
able; if you and your spouse die before payments begin, you forfeit your
initial payment. However, because insurance carriers know that most people
will balk at those terms, the carriers are likely to offer one or more of the
following features:
 Cash refund: If and your spouse both die before collecting the amount
of your initial payment, the insurance company pays your beneficiaries
the unpaid balance.
 Death benefit: If you die before you receive any income, your beneficia-
ries may receive a death benefit.
One company offers a death benefit equal to your initial payment growing
at a compound interest rate of 3 percent. If you pay $20,000 for your ALDA
at age 60 and die at age 81, your heirs will receive $37,206.

n the past, investors could afford the luxury of buying
and holding stocks or mutual funds for the long term,
but today’s world calls for a more active and even a spec-
ulative investor. The new world calls for a trader. And
futures and options markets, although high-risk, offer
some of the best opportunities to make money when trad-
ing in volatile times.
Risk and uncertainty go hand in hand with opportunities
to make money. That’s why learning how to trade futures
and options is important for investors who not only want
to diversify their portfolios but also want to ﬁnd ways to
protect and grow their money when times are hard in tra-
ditional investment venues, such as the stock market.
After you read this part, you’ll know how trading futures
and options is done and how to stay in the game as long
as you want.

In This Chapter

 Grasping the basics of futures and options trading
 Weighing volatility and risk
 Taking necessary steps before you begin
B
efore you trade in futures and options, there’s quite a bit you need to
know. For starters, you need to understand what, exactly, futures and
options trading is! Then you need to know how the futures and options markets
work and who the major players are. And because futures trading involves
speculating (more akin to gambling than investing), you absolutely need to
know about volatility and risk. This chapter gives you just that kind of infor-
mation. And because trading futures and options isn’t for everyone, I also
help you decide whether being a trader is the right move for you.
Defining Futures and Options
Futures markets are the hub of capitalism. They provide the bases for prices
at wholesale and eventually retail markets for commodities ranging from
gasoline and lumber to key items in the food chain, such as cattle, pork, corn,
and soybeans.
A futures contract is a security, similar in concept to a stock or a bond while
being significantly different. Whereas a stock gives you equity and a bond
makes you a debt holder, a futures contract is a legally binding agreement
that sets the conditions for the delivery of commodities or financial instruments
at a specific time in the future.
Futures contracts are available for more than just mainstream commodities.
You can contract stock index futures, interest rate products — bonds and
Treasury bills, and lesser known commodities like propane. Some futures
contracts are even designed to hedge against weather risk.

Futures markets emerged and developed in fits and starts several hundred
years ago as a mechanism through which merchants traded goods and ser-
vices at some point in the future, based on their expectations for crops and
harvest yields. Now virtually all financial and commodity markets are linked,
with futures and cash markets functioning as a single entity on a daily basis.
Just like stocks and futures contracts, options are securities that are subject
to binding agreements. The key difference between options and futures con-
tracts is that options give you the right to buy or sell an underlying security
or asset without being obligated to do so, as long as you follow the rules of
the options contract. In addition, options are derivatives. A derivative is a
financial instrument that gets its value not from its own intrinsic value but
rather from the value of the underlying security and time. Options on the
stock of IBM, for example, are directly influenced by the price of IBM stock.
Getting the Lowdown on Futures Trading
Futures contracts are by design meant to limit the amount of time and risk
exposure experienced by speculators and hedgers. As a result, futures con-
tracts have several key characteristics that enable traders to trade them
effectively:
 Expiration: All futures contracts are time-based; they expire, which means
that at some point in the future they will no longer exist. From a trading
standpoint, the expiration of a contract forces you to make one of the fol-
lowing decisions: sell the contract or roll it over; sell the contract (taking
your profits or losses) and just stay out of the market; or take delivery of
the commodity, equity, or product represented by the contract.
 Daily price limits: Because of their volatility and the potential for cata-
strophic losses, futures contracts include limits that freeze prices but
don’t freeze trading. Daily price limits are stated in terms of the previous
day’s closing price plus and minus so many cents or dollars per trading
unit. After a futures price has increased by its daily limit, there can be no
trading at any higher price until the next day of trading. After a futures
price has decreased by its daily limit, there can be no trading at any
lower price until the next day of trading.
Limits are meant to let markets cool down during periods of extremely
active trading. (Keep in mind that the market can trade at the limit price
but not beyond it.) Some contracts have variable limits, meaning the limits
change if the market closes at the limit. (For example, if the cattle markets
close at the limit for two straight days, the limit is raised on the third day.)
 Size of account: Most brokers require individuals to deposit a certain
amount of money in a brokerage account before they can start trading. A
fairly constant figure in the industry is $5,000.
130
Book III: Futures and Options 

Depositing only $5,000 with the brokerage firm probably is not enough
to provide you with a good trading experience. Some experienced
traders will tell you that $100,000 is a better figure to have on hand, and
$20,000 is probably the least amount you can actually work with. These
are not hard and fast rules, though.
Futures exchanges: Where 
the magic happens
Several active futures and options exchanges exist in the United States. Each
has its own niche, but some overlaps occur in the types of contracts that are
traded. Here are the names to know:
 Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE, www.cboe.com): The premier
options exchange market in the world, the CBOE specializes in 
trading options on individual stocks, stock index futures, interest rate
futures, and a broad array of specialized products such as exchange-
traded funds. The CBOE is not a futures exchange but is included here to
be complete, because futures and options can be traded simultaneously,
as part of a single strategy.
 CME Group: A CME/Chicago Board of Trade Company (www.cmegroup
.com): In 2007, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the Chicago
Board of Trade (CBOT) merged, creating this new entity.
The CBOT brings to the table trades made in futures contracts for the
agriculturals, interest rates, Dow Indexes, and metals. The CME was
already the largest futures exchange in North America, trading a wide
variety of instruments, including commodities, stock index futures, foreign
currencies, interest rates, TRAKRS, and environmental futures. (TRAKRS,
or total return asset contracts, are designed to track an index that can be
composed of stocks, bonds, currencies, or other financial instruments.
Environmental futures are principally weather contracts initially based
upon temperature.)
Futures contracts for the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index and options
on the futures contracts that the CME listed also are traded here, along
with real estate futures.
 Intercontinental Exchange (ICE, www.theice.com): This exchange was
established in 2000 and through mergers and acquisitions, most notably
that of the New York Board of Trade, has become a key electronic 24-hour
trading platform. ICE offers trading for crude oil, both Brent and West
Texas Light Sweet contracts, as well as heating oil, jet fuel, electric power,
and soft commodities such as coffee, sugar, cocoa, and frozen orange juice.
131

 Kansas City Board of Trade (KCBT, www.kcbt.com): The KCBT is a
regional exchange that specializes in wheat futures and offers trading on
stock index futures for the Value Line Index, a broad listing of 1,700 stocks.
 Minneapolis Grain Exchange (MGEX, www.mgex.com): MGEX is a
regional exchange that trades three kinds of seasonally different wheat
futures, and offers futures and options on the National Corn Index and
the National Soybeans Index.
 New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX, www.nymex.com): The NYMEX
is the hub for trading in energy futures and metals.
E-mini contracts are smaller-value versions of the larger contracts. They trade
for a fraction of the price of the full value instrument and thus are more suit-
able for small accounts. The attractive feature of e-mini contracts is that you
can participate in the market’s movements for lesser investment amounts. Be
sure to check commissions and other prerequisites before you trade, though.
Futures trading systems: How trading
actually takes place
Around the world, most futures exchanges now use electronic trading. In the
United States, we still use the open outcry system of futures trading for many
physical commodities, such as agriculturals and oil. This means that traders
on a trading floor or in a trading pit shout and use hand signals to make
transactions or trades with each other. However, most U.S. futures markets
also offer electronic trading.
In the open outcry system, here’s how a trade takes place: When you call
your broker, he relays a message to the trading floor, where a runner relays
the message to the floor broker, who then executes the trade. The runner
then relays the trade confirmation back to your broker, who tells you how it
went. Trade reporters on the floor of the exchange watch for executed
trades, record them, and transmit these transactions to the exchange, which,
in turn, transmits the price to the entire world almost simultaneously.
The order of business is similar when you trade futures online, except that
you receive a trade confirmation via an e-mail or other online communiqué.
In the futures market, your daily trading activity is marked to market, which
means that your net gain or net loss from changes in price of the outstanding
futures contracts open in your account are calculated and applied to your
account each day at the end of the trading day. Your gains are available for
use the following day for additional trading or withdrawal from your account.
132
Book III: Futures and Options 

Your net losses are removed from your account, reducing the amount you
have to trade with or that you can withdraw from your account.
One key difference between open outcry and electronic trading is the length
of the trading day. Regular market hours usually run from 8:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m.
eastern time. Globex, the major electronic data and trading system, extends
futures trading beyond the pits and into an electronic overnight session.
Globex is active 23 hours per day.
When you turn to the financial news on CNBC before the stock market opens,
you see quotes for the S&P 500 futures and others taken from Globex as
traders from around the world make electronic trades. Globex quotes are
real, meaning that if you keep a position open overnight, and you place a sell
stop (defined in the next section) under it or you place a buy order with
instructions to execute in Globex, you may wake up the next morning with a
new position, or out of a position altogether.
Globex trading overnight tends to be thinner than trading during regular market
hours. It’s also more volatile in some ways than trading during regular hours.
You can monitor Globex stock index futures, Eurodollars, and currency trades
on a delayed basis overnight free of charge at www.cme.com/trading/dta/
del/globex.html.
Futures lingo
If you’re going to trade futures, you have to know trader talk. Key terms
include the following:
 Going long: You’re bullish, or positive on the market, and you want to
buy something. When I say “I’m long oil,” in the context of futures trading,
it means that I own oil futures.
 Being short: You’re bearish, or negative on the market, and your goal is
to make money when the price of the futures contract that you choose to
short falls in price.
 Locals: The people in the trading pits. They’re usually among the first to
react to news and other events that affect the markets.
 Front month: The futures contract month nearest to expiration. This
time frame may not always feature the most widely quoted futures
contract. As one contract expires, the next contract in line becomes the
front month.
133
Chapter 1: Futures and Options Fundamentals
Book III
Futures and
Options

 Orders: Instructions that lead to the completion of a trade. They can be
placed in a variety of ways, including the following:
• A stop-loss order means that you want to limit your losses at or above
a certain price. A stop-loss order becomes a market order (see 
the next entry) to buy or sell at the prevailing market price after the
market touches the stop price, or the price at which you’ve instructed
the broker to sell. A buy stop is placed above the market. A sell stop is
placed below the market. Stop orders can also be used to initiate a
long or short position, not just to close (offset) an open position.
• A market order means that you’ll take the prevailing price the
market has to offer.
• A trailing stop is a self-adjusting stop order. When you place a trailing
stop, it changes automatically depending on the price of the under-
lying asset.
 Hedging: A trading technique used to manage risk. It may mean that
you’re setting up a trade that can go either way, and you want to be pre-
pared for whichever way the market breaks. In the context of large pro-
ducers of commodities, hedging means that they put strategies in place
in case the market does the opposite of what’s expected.
 The pit: Where all futures contracts are traded during a regular-hours
trading session in the futures markets.
 Speculators: Traders (usually small- to medium-sized) who are trying to
make money only from the fluctuation of prices without intending to
take delivery of the contract.
 Floor brokers: Agents (generally futures commission merchants) who
receive a commission to buy and sell futures contracts for their clients.
 Bid: The highest price a buyer is willing to pay.
 Offer: The lowest price a seller is willing to accept.
 Taking delivery: Taking the product on which you were speculating.
 Supply-and-demand equation: Trader talk referring to whether buyers
outnumber sellers. When there are more sellers than buyers, the equation
tilts toward supply, and vice versa.
 Expiration: The date at which a contract expires, or is no longer trading.
 Delivery: What futures contracts are all about — someone actually
delivering or handing something to someone else in exchange for money.
134
Book III: Futures and Options 

The individual players: Hedgers 
and speculators
The two major categories of traders are hedgers and speculators. The two
groups enter the futures market trying to accomplish different objectives.
Hedgers trade not only in futures contracts but also in the commodity, equity,
or product represented by the contract. They trade futures to secure the
future price of the commodity of which they will take delivery and then sell
later in the cash market. By buying or selling futures contracts, they protect
themselves against future price risks. Speculators bet on the price change
potential for one reason only — profit.
The interaction between speculators and hedgers is what makes the futures
markets efficient. This efficiency and the accuracy of the supply-and-demand
equation increase as the underlying contract gets closer to expiration and
more information about what the marketplace requires at the time of delivery
becomes available.
A hedger may try to take the speculator’s money, and vice versa. A speculator,
for example, may buy a contract from a hedger at a low price, anticipating that
it will be worth more. The hedger sells at that low price because he expects the
price to decline further. Hedgers transfer the risk of price variability to others
in exchange for the cost of the hedge. Speculators assume price variability risk,
thus making the transfer possible in exchange for the potential to gain. A hedger
and a speculator can both be very happy from the outcome of price variability
in the same market.
Futures contracts are attractive to longs (people looking to buy at the lowest
possible price and sell at the highest possible price) and shorts (people sell-
ing commodities in the hope that prices fall) because they provide price and
time certainty and reduce the risk associated with volatility, or the speed at
which prices change up or down. Hedging can help lock in an acceptable
price margin, or difference between the futures price and the cash price for
the commodity, and improve the risk between the cost of the raw material
and the retail cost of the final product by covering for any market-related
losses. Note: Hedge positions don’t always work, and in some cases, they can
make losses worse.

Getting Up to Speed on Options
The options market goes hand in hand with the futures markets. When used
properly, options give you an opportunity to diversify your holdings beyond
traditional investments and to hedge your portfolio against risk. The key is
discovering how to use options the right way.
Here’s some basic information about options:
 Option buyers are also known as holders, and option sellers are
known as writers. Call option holders have the right to buy a stipulated
quantity of the underlying asset specified in the contract. Put option
holders have the right to sell a specified amount of the underlying asset
in the contract. Call and put holders can exercise these rights at the
strike price, the predetermined price at which an option will be delivered
when it is exercised.
Call option writers have the potential obligation to sell. Put option
buyers have the potential obligation to buy.
 Options, like futures contracts, have expiration dates. All stock options
expire on the third Friday of the month. Options on futures expire on dif-
ferent days depending on the contract. Sometimes different classes of
options expire on the same day. These days are known as double-, triple-,
and quadruple-witching days:
• Double-witching days: When any two of the different classes of
options (stock, stock index options, and stock index futures options)
expire.
136
Book III: Futures and Options 
Duarte Air: A hedging example
Let’s say that Duarte Air is projecting a need for
large amounts of jet fuel for the summer season,
based on the trends in travel during the past
decade. The airline also knows that demand for
gasoline tends to rise in the summer; thus prices
for the jet fuel it needs are also likely to rise
because of refinery usage issues — refineries
switch a major portion of their summer produc-
tion to gasoline.
Wanting to hedge costs for crude oil in the
summer, Duarte Air starts buying July crude oil
and gasoline futures a few months ahead of time,
hoping that, as the prices rise, the profits from
the trades can offset the costs of the expected
rise in jet fuel. So Duarte Air buys July crude
futures at $50 per barrel in December, and by
June they are trading at $60 per barrel. As the
prices continue to rise, Duarte starts unloading
the contracts, pocketing the $10-per-barrel profit
and using it to offset the higher costs of its fuel
in the spot market (during the summer travel
season).

• Triple-witching days: When all three classes expire simultaneously,
which happens on the third Friday at the end of a quarter.
• Quadruple-witching days: When all three classes of options expire
along with single stock futures options.
 Options trade during the trading hours of the underlying asset.
 Owning an option doesn’t give the holder any share of the underlying
security. The right to buy or sell that security is what options are all about.
 Options are a (slightly less than) zero-sum game. For every dollar
someone makes, someone loses a dollar. Options, like futures, have both
a seller and a buyer. When you make a losing trade, someone else gets
an amount equal to your losses transferred to his or her account, and
you get charged commission. The exchanges also get a fee.
 If you win, you’ll probably owe taxes. The treatment of options in the
tax code is complex, and much of it deals with whether you have short-
term or long-term gains. The details are provided in the option disclosure
statement, which is required reading before you ever trade options. The
statement is part of the packet of information your broker gives you along
with the account application. Be sure to read that document carefully and
discuss the tax-related details with your accountant before trading.
Some traders trade options (and do it well) purely as a vehicle of speculation.
However, the primary function of a listed option is risk management, not
speculation, even though options (when applied properly) do offer limited
risk and unlimited reward potential and can be more compelling than straight
futures, especially for people who want to speculate with less than $30,000.
Options usually trade at a fraction of the price of the underlying asset,
making them attractive to investors with small accounts. Before you trade,
visit the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Web site Education
Center, www.cftc.gov/educationcenter/. It’s an excellent resource that
provides you with a summary of what you need to know before you open a
trading account and what to avoid after you open one.
American- and European-style options
Two major categories of options exist and are based on the way they can be
exercised:
 American-style options can be exercised, or acted upon, if your intent is to
do what the option gives you the right to do on or before the expiration
date. The person holding the option decides.
137
Chapter 1: Futures and Options Fundamentals
Book III
Futures and
Options

The advantage of American-style options is that you have more flexibility
regarding when and how to exercise them. Most individual stock options
and some index options are traded under American-style options exercise
rules.
 European-style options can be exercised only on the date of expiration.
European-style options are traded on many of the cash-based indexes.
For example, options based on the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial
indexes are European-style.
The advantage of European-style options is that you are certain about the
timeline you have until the option is exercised.
All options can be exercised only once.
Types of options: Calls and puts
Two types of options are traded. One kind lets you speculate on prices of the
underlying asset rising, and the other lets you bet on their fall.
Calls
A call option gives you the right to buy a defined amount of the underlying
asset at a certain price before a certain amount of time expires. (Think of it as
a bet that the underlying asset is going to rise in value.) If you don’t buy the
asset by the time the option expires, you lose only the money that you spent
on the call option. You can always sell your option prior to expiration to
avoid exercising it, to avoid further loss, or to profit if it has risen in value.
Call options usually rise in price when the underlying asset rises in price.
When you buy a call option, you put up the option premium for the right to
exercise an option to buy the underlying asset before the call option expires.
When you exercise a call, you’re buying the underlying stock or asset at the
strike price, the predetermined price at which an option will be delivered
when it is exercised.
The attractiveness of buying call options is that the upside potential is huge,
and the downside risk is limited to the original premium — the price you pay
for the option.
Puts
Put options are bets that the price of the underlying asset is going to fall. Puts
are excellent trading instruments when you’re trying to guard against losses
in stocks, futures contracts, or commodities that you already own. Buying a
put option gives you the right to sell a specific quantity of the underlying
asset at a predetermined price (the strike price) during a certain amount of
time. Like calls, if you don’t exercise a put option, your risk is limited to the
option premium, or the price you paid for it.
138
Book III: Futures and Options 

When you exercise a put option, you’re exercising your right to sell the under-
lying asset at the strike price. Puts are sometimes thought of as portfolio
insurance, because they give you the option of selling a falling stock at a
predetermined strike price. You can also sell puts.
Option quotes
When you trade options, you have to look at quote boards on your computer,
even if you’re using a broker. Figure 1-1 shows you a good generic example of
a quote board provided by the Chicago Board of Options Exchange
(www.cboe.com).
On this quote board, which shows the May 30 call option for XYZ, you find
information about option classes, series, and pricing. XYZ is the option class,
while May 30 is the option series, a grouping of puts or calls of the same
underlying asset with the same strike price and expiration date. If you look
above and below the May 30 series, you find other option series listed, such
as the May 25 puts and calls, listed two sections above the circled series. The
premium, or the price, on the May 30 XYZ is two points. If this was a call to
buy XYZ stock, you’d pay $200, because options for stocks give you the right
to control 100-share lots of the stock.

The all-important volatility
Volatility, a measure of how fast and how much prices of the underlying asset
move, is key to understanding why option prices fluctuate and act the way they
do. In fact, volatility is the most important concept in options trading. There
are two kinds of volatility: implied volatility (IV) and historical (or statistical)
volatility (HV). Whereas HV measures the rate of movement in the price of the
underlying asset, IV measures the price movement of the option itself:
 Implied volatility (IV): This is the estimated volatility of a security’s price
in real time, or as the option trades. Values for IV come from formulas that
measure the options market’s expectations, offering a prediction of the
volatility of the underlying asset over the life of the option. Another way of
looking at it is that IV is the volatility implied by the market price of the
option based on an option pricing model. In other words, it is the volatility
that, given a particular pricing model, yields a theoretical value for the
option equal to the current price. It usually rises when the markets are in
downtrends and falls when the markets are in uptrends.
Most of the time, IV is computed using a formula based on something
called the Black-Scholes model. The goal of the Black-Scholes model,
which is highly theoretical for actual trading, is to calculate a fair market
value of an option by incorporating multiple variables such as historical
volatility, time premium, and strike price. Here’s a little secret: Although
the number it produces, IV, is central to options trading, the Black-Scholes
formula alone isn’t very practical as a trading tool because trading
software automatically calculates the necessary measurements.
 Historical volatility (HV): Also known as statistical volatility (SV), this is a
measurement of how fast prices of the underlying asset have been changing
over time. Because HV is always changing, it has to be calculated on a daily
basis. It’s stated as a percentage and summarizes the recent movements
in price. In general, the bigger the HV, the more an option is worth.
Volatility can be difficult to grasp unless taken in small bites. Fortunately,
trading software programs provide a great deal of the information needed to
keep track of volatility. Bare-bones screening software is available for free
from The Options Industry Council (go to www.888options.com). For more
sophisticated analysis, you have to spend some money. Many good options-
trading programs are available. Among the most popular programs is Option
Vue 5 Options Analysis Software, which has just about everything you could
want to analyze options and find trades. Many traders use OptionVue and
consider it the benchmark program.
140
Book III: Futures and Options 

Using volatility to make trading decisions
Think of decreasing volatility as a coiled spring that is about to explode. As a
trader, you want to be able to predict when changes in volatility — and thus
changes in prices — are coming. One way to do that is to keep tabs on HV.
You can chart 10-, 20-, 50-, and 100-day volatility figures. Watch the trends
during each of the four periods. If the 100-day volatility was 60 percent and
the 10-day volatility was 10 percent, the volatility in price of the underlying
asset is slowing. When prices begin to congregate in narrower trading ranges,
volatility begins to decrease, and it can be a sign that a big move is coming.
That’s when you can
 Start paying closer attention to the option series and making potential
trading plans.
 Decide whether IV is cheap or expensive, no matter what you may think
the prospects of the underlying asset are.
 Play the momentum, which is also a good strategy with options, regardless
of volatility. A couple of simple but powerful algorithms are buying calls
or selling puts in stocks currently trending higher, or buying puts and
selling calls in markets currently trending lower. In other words, paying
attention to strong price trends can outweigh all volatility considerations.
141

Options mispricing
In a perfect world, HV and IV should be fairly
close together, given the fact that they are sup-
posed to be measures of two financial assets
that are intrinsically related to one another, the
underlying asset and its option. In fact, some-
times IV and HV actually are very close
together. Yet the differences in these numbers
at different stages of the market cycle can pro-
vide excellent trading opportunities. This con-
cept is called options mispricing, and if you can
understand how to use it, options mispricing
can help you make better trading decisions.
When HV and IV are far apart, the price of the
option is not reflecting the actual volatility of 
the underlying asset. For example, if IV rises dra-
matically and HV is very low, the underlying stock
may be a possible candidate for a takeover.
Under those circumstances, the stock probably
has been stuck in a trading range as the market
awaits news. At the same time, option premiums
may remain high because of the potential for
sudden changes with regard to the deal.
The bottom line is that HV and IV are useful tools
in trading options. Most software programs will
graph out these two variables. When they are
charted, big spreads become easy to spot, and
that enables you to look for trading opportunities.

When the majority of traders expects the underlying asset to be nonvolatile,
as indicated by low volatility measurements, or wide spreads between HV
and IV appear, you need to be buying volatility. That means when everyone
else is selling options, you need to analyze the situation and pick the options
with the best potential to buy, always knowing that you can be wrong and
making plans to get out of the positions before you lose a whole lot of money.
Selling expensive options and buying cheap ones
The first step to trading options based on implied volatility is to buy and sell
them correctly at the best possible price. This may sound difficult but can be
made relatively easy by option trading software. A simple method is to list a
series of options on your screen, and to look at two particular numbers, the
actual price of the option (the ask price) and the theoretical value of the
option, which is derived from the Black-Sholes formula, the benchmark equa-
tion for valuing options. Black-Sholes values are based on underlying price,
option strike price, option premium, historical volatility, expiration date,
interest rate, and dividend rate.
The difference between the ask price and the theoretical price is the key, with
the largest difference between the two numbers giving you the “largest discount”
and leading you to the least expensive option in the series. To find the most
expensive option, you would rank the series in reverse and look for the smallest
difference in the two prices, or the “smallest discount.” An excellent example of
this technique can be found at www.optionstar.com/art/art1.htm.
It is always useful to keep an eye on options trading activity, because market
makers often smell that something is up and start buying options for their
own accounts to cover their short positions. Market makers tend to be short
more often than not to protect themselves, because with access to all the
trading activity data, they have better information than the public in general.
When option volume and IV pick up, look at the underlying assets and at the
action in other option series. If the underlying asset doesn’t make a move and
the action in other options doesn’t start to pick up, what’s probably happen-
ing is that a hedge fund or other market mover is putting on a big hedge or
establishing a large position to protect its portfolio.
Rising options prices combined with the propagation of high volume and/or
implied volatility, with or without a rise in the price of the underlying asset,
are signs that the options market makers are on the move. These smart guys
usually can tell when someone is putting on a hedge or when something else
is really up. Most of the time, market makers are in risky positions against the
market trend. When the action starts to pick up, the first thing they do is try
to figure out whether the spike in activity is something major or just a hedge.
If market makers determine that something major is going on, they try to buy
all the options they can find on the other side of their current positions. If
they can’t find options, they start buying the underlying assets — stocks or
futures contracts.
142
Book III: Futures and Options 

When you see big rises in trading volume and implied volatility in an option,
it’s a fairly good sign that somebody knows something that few others know.
Staying away from such trades, or at least not selling in volatility, is a good
idea. These can be highly risky situations that can turn on a dime and can
make you lose money very quickly.
Measurements of risk: It’s Greek to me
Options require you to pick up a bit of the Greek language, but don’t panic;
you need to learn only four words: delta, gamma, theta, and vega. Each is
important. The Greeks, as they are commonly called, are measurements of
risk. They explain several variables that influence option prices:
 Amount of volatility: An increase in volatility usually is positive for put
and call options, if you’re long in the option. If you’re the writer of the
option, an increase in volatility is negative. (See the preceding section
for details about volatility.)
 Changes in the time to expiration. The closer you get to the time of
expiration, the more negative the time factor becomes for a holder of
the option and the less your potential for profit. Time value shrinks as
an option approaches expiration and is zero upon expiration of the option.
 Changes in the price of the underlying asset. An increase in the price of
the underlying asset usually is a positive influence on the price of a call
option. A decrease in the price of the underlying instrument usually is
positive for put options and vice versa.
 Interest rates: Interest rates are less important than the other factors
most of the time. Higher interest rates make call options more expensive
and put options less expensive, in general.
Delta
Delta measures the effect of a change in the price of the underlying asset on
the option’s premium. Delta is best understood as the amount of change in
the price of an option for every one-point move in the underlying asset, or
the percentage of the change in price of the underlying asset that is reflected
in the price of an option. Delta is positive for calls and negative for puts.
Values range from 0 to 100 for calls and from 0 to –100 for puts.
Puts have a negative delta number because of their inverse or negative rela-
tionship to the underlying asset. Put premiums fall when the underlying asset
rises in price, and they rise when the underlying asset falls. Call options have
a positive relationship to the underlying asset and thus a positive delta number.
As the price of the underlying asset goes up, so do call premiums, unless other
variables change, such as implied volatility, time to expiration, and interest
rates. Call premiums generally go down as the price of the underlying asset
falls, as long as no other influences are putting undue pressure on the option.
143
Chapter 1: Futures and Options Fundamentals
Book III
Futures and
Options

Here is how it works: An at-the-money call has a delta value of 0.5 or 50, which
tells you that the option’s premium will rise or fall by half a point with a one-
point move in the underlying asset. If an at-the-money call option for wheat
has a delta of 0.5 and the wheat futures contract associated with the option
goes up 10 cents, the premium on the option will rise approximately by 5 cents,
or 0.5 × 10 = 5. The actual gain will be $250 because each cent in premium is
worth $50 in the contract.
The further into the money the option premium advances, the closer the rela-
tionship between the price of the underlying asset and the price of the option
becomes. When delta approaches 1 for calls, or –1 for puts, the price of the
option and the underlying asset move the same, assuming all the other
variables remain under control.
Gamma
Gamma measures the rate of change of delta in relation to the change in the
price of the underlying asset, and it enables you to predict how much you’re
going to make or lose based on the movement of the underlying position.
The best way to understand this concept is to look at an example like the one
in Figure 1-2, which shows the changes in delta and gamma as the underlying
asset changes in price. The example features a short position in the S&P 500
September $930 call option as it rises in price from $925 on the left to $934 on
the right and is based on trader John Summa’s explanation of the Greeks.
(Summa runs a Web site called OptionsNerd.com.) The chart was prepared
using OptionVue 5 Options Analytical Software (www.optionvue.com).
The first line in Figure 1-2 is a calculation of the profit or loss for the S&P 500
Index futures 930 call option — $930 is the strike price of the S&P 500 Index
futures option that expires in September. The –200 line is the at-the-money
strike of the 930 call option, and each column represents a one-point change
in the underlying asset. The at-the-money gamma of the underlying asset for
the 930 option is –0.79, and the delta is –52.34. What this tells you is that for

every one-point move in the depicted futures contract, delta will increase by
exactly 0.79. If you move one column to the right, you see the delta changes
to –53.13, which is an increase of 0.79 from –52.34.
The position depicts a short call position that is losing money. The P/L line is
measuring Profit/Loss. The more negative the P/L numbers become, the more
in the red the position is. Note also that delta is increasingly negative as the
price of the option rises. Finally, with delta being at –52.34, the position is
expected to lose 0.5234 points in price with the next one-point rise in the
underlying futures contract.
The further out of the money that a call option declines, the smaller the delta,
because changes in the underlying asset cause only small changes in the option
premium. The delta gets larger as the call option advances closer to the money,
which is a result of an increase in the underlying asset’s price. Other important
aspects of gamma are that it
 Is smallest for deep out-of-the-money and in-the-money options.
 Is highest when the option gets near the money.
 Is positive for long options and negative for short options.
Theta
Theta measures the rate of decline of the time premium (the effect on the
option’s price of the time remaining until option expiration) with the passage
of time. Understanding premium erosion due to the passage of time is critical
to being successful at trading options. Often the effects of theta will offset the
effects of delta, resulting in the trader being right about the direction of the
move and still losing money.
It helps to remember that option premiums consist of time premium plus
intrinsic value. If the option is not in the money, all the premium is consid-
ered time premium. Time premium reflects the price for the remaining life of
the option and the volatility component.
As time passes and option expiration grows near, the value of the time premium
decreases, and the amount of decrease grows faster as option expiration nears.
Theta rises sharply during the last few weeks of trading and can do a considerable
amount of damage to a long holder’s position, which is made worse when the
option’s implied volatility is falling at the same time.
The following mini-table shows the theta values for the featured example of
the short S&P 500 Index futures 930 call option (refer to Figure 1-2).

To see how theta affects the price of an option, look in the fourth column of
the table, where the figure for T+19 measures theta six days before the
option’s expiration. The value 93.3 tells you that the option is losing $93.30
per day, a major increase in time-influenced loss of value compared with the
figure for T+0, where the option’s loss of value attributed to time alone was
only $45.40 per day.
Vega
Vega measures risk exposure to changes in implied volatility and tells traders
how much an option’s price will rise or fall as the volatility of the option
varies. Put another way, vega is an estimate of how much the theoretical
value of an option changes when volatility changes 1 percent.
Vega is expressed as a value; refer to Figure 1-2, which shows that the short
call option has a negative vega value — this tells you that the position will
gain in price if the implied volatility falls. The value of vega tells you by how
much the position will gain in this case. If the at-the-money value for vega is
–96.94, for example, you know that for each percentage-point drop in implied
volatility, a short call position will gain by $96.94.
Here are a few other vega facts to keep you out of the poorhouse:
 Vega can rise or fall without the price changes of the underlying asset.
 It can increase if the price of the underlying asset moves quickly, especially
when the stock market declines fast or a commodity makes a big move.
 It falls as expiration of the option nears.
Should Futures or Options 
Be in Your Future?
Futures traders, at least the ones who survive the initial stages of torment
and can ride out the inevitable and discouraging down periods, are by nature
risk takers. And options are an integral part of the trading game that futures
traders play, although it is worth noting that options and futures are viable
stand-alone vehicles for trading. But is trading in futures or options right for
you? The following sections help you answer that question.
How much money do you have?
Many experienced traders say that you need $100,000 to get started, but the
truth is that there are many talented traders who have made fortunes 
after starting out with significantly less than $100,000. However, it would be 
146
Book III: Futures and Options 

irresponsible for me to lead you astray by giving you the impression that the
odds are in your favor if you start trading at a very low level.
The reality is that different people fare differently depending on their trading
ability, at any level of experience. A trader with $1 million in equity can lose
large amounts just as easily as you and I with $10,000 worth of equity in our
account.
If you don’t have that much money and are not sure how to proceed, you need
to either reconsider trading altogether, develop a stout trading plan and the
discipline required to heed its tenets, or consider managed futures contracts.
How involved are you?
Futures trading is risky business and requires active participation. It can be
plied successfully only if you’re serious about it and committed to it. That
means you must be able to develop your trading craft by constantly reviewing
and modifying your plan and strategies.
Trading is not investing; it’s speculating, assuming a business risk with the
hope of profiting from market fluctuations. Successful speculating requires
analyzing situations, predicting outcomes, and putting your money on one
side of a trade based on which way you think the market is going to go, up or
down. To be a successful futures and options trader, you’re going to have to
become connected with the world through the Internet, television, and other
news sources so you can be up-to-date and intimately knowledgeable with
regard to world events. And I don’t mean just picking up on what you get
from occasionally watching the evening or headline news shows.
Before You Begin
If you decide that futures and options trading is right for you, you need to
amass a few things. In addition to a sufficient amount of money, you need a
computer, trading program, and brokerage account of some sort. This section
explains the details.
Setting up shop: Technology
When it comes to technology, you need an efficient computer system with
enough memory to enable you to look at large amounts of data and run either
multiple, fully loaded browsers or several monitors at the same time. You
also need a high-speed Internet connection. If you get serious about trading,
you also need to consider having two modes of high-speed Internet access.
147
Chapter 1: Futures and Options Fundamentals
Book III
Futures and
Options

For a home office, a full-time trader often has high-speed Internet through the
cable television service and through DSL (digital subscriber line), with one or
the other serving as a backup.
Knowing what you’re getting into
Not all options are created equal. In his book Starting Out In Futures Trading
(McGraw-Hill), author Mark Powers offers the following checklist of what you
need to know before you start trading, which I’m paraphrasing:
 Are you trading a U.S. or a foreign option? And is it an exchange-traded
or dealer-traded option? U.S. options are easily followed, and they’re
regulated by the CFTC and so are all the parties involved in issuing the
contract. Exchange-traded options are standardized contracts that are
more liquid and can be hedged better against risk. That isn’t always the
case with other, dealer-traded options.
 Who is guaranteeing the transaction? U.S. exchanges and firms are
constantly monitored for liquidity and solvency. Foreign institutions 
are not necessarily as well monitored, so their futures and options
contracts need to be checked individually, especially in the case of
foreign options or options that are not exchange-traded.
 How much of the premium that you pay is actually the value of the
option? In some cases, the fees involved when you deal with independent
options dealers can be very high and can hurt your transaction. Also
keep the following in mind: commission versus cost of the option versus
its theoretical value versus intrinsic value, all of which can be vastly
different. You pay the option premium plus a commission charge; the
commission is not imbedded in the option premium.
 What is the break-even price for your option? In other words, how
much price appreciation will be needed before you make money?
 How much in commissions are you paying, and what kind of service
are you getting for what you’re paying? Part of the answer here is to
consider where you are with regard to your trade. Prior to expiration if
long or short an option, your breakeven is the cost of your option. (If
initially long and you paid $5 and you sell it for $5, you break even. If ini-
tially short an option and you sold for $5 and you buy it back for $5, you
break even.) At expiration it gets a little more complicated. For calls, your
breakeven is the strike price plus the premium paid or received by the
writer. For puts, your breakeven is the strike price minus the premium
paid or received by the writer. 
 Will your advisor/broker check several independent sources to find
out what expectations are with respect to the future price of the
underlying asset? If there is a widespread expectation that price will
change very little in the future, the premium that you pay should be low.
148
Book III: Futures and Options 

 How will you and your advisor/broker exercise your option, and what
will you receive when you do? Always know how you and your broker will
communicate. That means that you have to read and understand the
terms of the management contract carefully before you put any money
down.
 How will your broker let you know when your options contract has
been executed and what the status of your account is? Online brokers
usually let you know this information automatically after your trade is
executed. Some traditional brokers call you sometime after the order 
is executed. You have to do what is most comfortable for you. It’s
important to keep in mind, though, that options trading can be very
short-term oriented; the more you know and the faster you know it, the
better your chances are of keeping up with your account, and the better
the set of decisions you can make.
Choosing an options broker
If you are interested in trading options but aren’t sure about your own ability
to trade them, you need to find a good options broker/advisor to help you
out. A broker can assist with strategy development, research, monitoring
open positions, and working orders. A futures broker usually can handle your
options activity as it relates to futures and may be able to handle stock
option transactions. If you want to do all that stuff yourself, then you just
want to get access to the markets through the lowest cost medium, usually
an online discount broker.
Con artists and unscrupulous advisors lurk around every corner and prey on
the unsuspecting and uninformed options trader, so do homework. When
selecting a broker/advisor, be sure to ask these important questions, which are
applicable to broker and advisor candidates for online and managed accounts:
 What kinds of services does the brokerage firm offer? If you decide to
establish a managed account, make sure early on that you’re getting your
money’s worth. Aside from getting good results, you’re paying for customer
service. Most advisors will meet with you at least on a yearly basis. Many
meet with you on a quarterly basis. If you’re an active trader and your
advisor calls you with trades frequently, make sure that he’s giving you
winning trades. Otherwise, he’s probably churning your account.
 What commissions and other costs are charged and under what
circumstances? As part of your search, compare fees and services
between the different advisor/broker candidates, and match their
results with their costs.
 How experienced in options trading is the broker who was assigned 
to me?
149
Chapter 1: Futures and Options Fundamentals
Book III
Futures and
Options

 Is my broker registered with the Commodities Futures Trading
Commission (CFTC) or National Futures Association (NFA)? This is
applicable to options on futures only. For stock options, the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and CBOE memberships are critical.
If the broker is registered with one of these organizations, contact it to
find out whether the firm or the broker is in good standing or if public
records of previous disciplinary actions exist. If disciplinary actions
have been taken, ask for audited results (and check out the auditor
because they may have had their own problems!).
 What kind of results can I expect from the broker assigned to me? Be
careful of financial advisors that advertise instant riches based on small
amounts of money and promise that they will return all of your money.
No one can make such a promise. Also get to know who’s doing the trading
and what methods they’re using before you give them any of your money.
In addition to asking questions, make sure that you tell your advisor how
much risk you are willing to take and how involved you want to be. If he or
she does things that make you uncomfortable despite your wishes regarding
the amount of risk you’re willing to take, it’s time to say goodbye to that advi-
sor. A good advisor tells you whether (or not) you’re a good customer-match
for the methods he’s accustomed to using. When I meet with clients whose
risk tolerance is different from my own, I never take on their accounts.
Avoiding discomfort before money changes hands is the best course.
Completing the necessary paperwork
You have to sign an options agreement with your options broker to be able to
trade options. An options agreement, by the way, is separate from a margin
agreement. You actually need to sign both before you can trade options, which
trade mainly from margin accounts. (A margin agreement is similar to a promis-
sory note when you get a loan from the bank. Basically, you are promising to
repay the loan, and the borrowed stock is collateral for the loan.)
Option trading agreements are pretty stout, spelling out the risks of options
trading above your signature and not only holding you liable for knowing the
stuff on the agreement but also expecting you to make good on the promises
you make in the agreement.

 Understanding the fiat system
 Eyeing the relationship between central banks and the money supply
 Studying key economic reports
S
uccessful futures and options traders can anticipate market movement.
You can also be successful by following established trends and cutting
losses. To understand what the markets are doing or anticipate where they’re
heading, you need to be familiar with the global economy, the conflicting
pressures that can impact it (money supply, interest rates, and inflation, for
example), and the role of central banks in stabilizing those forces — all topics
covered in this chapter.
Being a savvy futures and options trader also means being able to recognize
economic trends early. To that end, this chapter also explains how to read
and make sense of key economic reports.
Maneuvering Money Matters: 
The Fiat System
Throughout the world, governments use what’s called the fiat system: A
government mandates that the paper currency it prints is legal tender for
making financial transactions. Fiat money has no value in and of itself, but it
is accepted as money because a government says that it’s money, and the
public has enough confidence and faith in the money’s ability to serve as a
storage medium for purchasing power.

Fiat money is the opposite of commodity money, money based on a valuable
commodity. This method of valuation was used in the past. At times, the com-
modity itself actually was used as money. For instance, the use of gold, grain,
and even furs and other animal products as commodity money preceded the
current fiat system.
Realizing where money comes from
Central banks, such as the Federal Reserve (“the Fed”) in the United States,
create fiat money either by printing it or by buying bonds in the Treasury
market. When the economy slows down and the Fed wants to jumpstart it,
the Fed can inject money into the system by buying bonds from the banks,
which tends to lower interest rates. When the Fed wants to tighten credit and
slow down the economy, it might sell bonds to banks, thus draining money
from the system.
Instead of using gold as the basis for the monetary system — as was the
custom until 1971 — the Fed requires its member banks to keep certain spe-
cific amounts of money on reserve as a means of keeping a lid on the uncon-
trolled expansion of fiat money. These reserve requirements are the major
safeguard of the system.
To curb inflation, the Fed limits how much banks can actually lend by using a
bank reserve management system. If the current formula calls for a 10 percent
reserve ratio, for every dollar that a bank keeps in reserve, it can lend ten
dollars. Under the same scenario (a formula that calls for a 10 percent reserve
ratio), if the Fed buys $500 million in bonds in the open market, it creates $5
billion in new money that makes its way to the public via bank loans.
Putting fiat to work for you
As a futures trader, the fiat concept is the center of your universe. If you can
figure out which way interest rates are headed and where money is flowing,
most of what happens in the markets in general will fall into place, and you
can make better decisions about which way to trade. Keep these relationships
in mind:
 Futures markets often move based on the relationship between the bond
market and the Fed. When either the Fed or the bond market moves
interest rates in one direction, the other eventually will follow.
 Higher interest rates tend to eventually slow economic growth, while
lower interest rates tend to spur economies.
152
Book III: Futures and Options 

Normally, you begin to see these markets come to life at some point before or
after the Fed makes a move. So get in the habit of watching all the markets
together. When the Fed starts to ease rates, you want to look at what happens
to commodities like copper, gold, oil, and so on. The commodities markets
provide you with confirmation of what the markets in general are expecting
as the Fed makes its move.
Respecting the Role of Central Banks
Central banks are designed to make sure that their respective domestic
economies run as smoothly as possible. They buy and sell bonds and inject
or extract money from the banking system they control. In most countries,
central banks are expected at the very least to combat inflationary pressures.
To understand the role of central banks, consider the U.S. economy and the
actions of the Federal Reserve. The U.S. economy is dependent upon a series
of intertwined relationships. Consumers drive the U.S. economy, and consumers
need jobs to buy things and keep the economy going. Economic activity is
driven up or down by the ebb and flow between the degree of joblessness
and full employment, how easy or difficult it is to get credit, and how much
the supply of goods and services is in demand.
As a rule, steady job growth, easy-enough credit, and a balance between
supply and demand of goods and services are what the Fed likes to see.
When one or more of these factors teeters off balance, the Fed has to act by
raising or lowering interest rates with the intention of
 Tightening or loosening the consumer’s ability to obtain credit.
 Reining in unemployment.
 Increasing or decreasing the supply side of goods and services to bring
it in line with demand.
After a central bank starts down a certain policy route, it usually stays with it
for months, creating an intermediate-term trend on which to base the direction
of trading. After September 11, 2001, for example, the Fed lowered interest
rates 14 times and left them at 1 percent until the summer of 2004, when it
began to raise them until the summer of 2006. In September 2007, the Federal
Reserve lowered the Discount rate and the Fed Funds rate in response to the
subprime mortgage crisis, and followed with another cut in the Fed Funds
rate in October.
153
Chapter 2: Being a Savvy Futures and Options Trader

The overarching goal of central banks is to keep in check the boom and bust
cycles in the global economy. So far this goal is only an intention, because
boom and bust cycles remain in place and are now referred to as the business
cycle. Nevertheless, the actions of the Fed and other central banks have served
to lengthen the amount of time between boom and bust cycles to the extent
that they’ve smoothed out volatile trends.
Following the Money Supply
The money supply is how much money is available in an economy to buy goods,
services, and securities. The money supply is as important as the supply of
goods in determining the direction of the futures and options markets. The
four money supply figures to watch are
 M0: This figure refers to all the cash and coins in circulation.
 M1: This figure represents M0 plus the amount of money housed in all
checking and savings accounts.
 M2: This figure represents M1 plus money housed in other types of sav-
ings accounts, such as money-market funds and certificates of deposit
(CDs) of less than $100,000.
 M3: This figure represents M2 plus all other CDs, deposits held in euros,
and all repurchase agreements (repos, which are essentially secured
loans) in which one party sells securities to another party and agrees to
buy them back at a later date.
154
Book III: Futures and Options 
The multiplier effect
The wildest thing about money is how one dollar
counts as two dollars whenever it goes around
the loop enough times in an interesting little
concept known as the multiplier effect. For
example, say the Fed buys $1 worth of bonds
from Bank X, and Bank X lends it to Person 1.
Person 1 buys something from Person 2, who
deposits the dollar in Bank 1. Bank 1 lends the
money to Person 3, who deposits it in Bank 2,
where the $1, in terms of money supply, is now
$2 because it’s been counted twice. By multi-
plying this little exercise by billions of transac-
tions, you can arrive at the massive money
supply numbers in the United States.

Grasping the monetary exchange equation
The monetary exchange equation explains the relationship between money
supply and inflation:
Velocity × Money Supply = Gross Domestic Product (GDP) × GDP Deflator
Velocity is a measure of how fast money is changing hands, recording how
many times per year the money actually is exchanged. GDP is the sum of all
the goods and services produced by the economy. The GDP deflator is a mea-
sure of inflation, or a sustained rise in prices.
Here’s what’s important about the money supply as it relates to futures and
options trading: A rising money supply, usually spawned by lower interest
rates, tends to spur the economy and eventually fuels demand for commodi-
ties. Whenever the money supply rises to a key level, which differs in every
cycle, inflationary pressures eventually begin to appear, and the Fed starts
reducing the money supply. The more money that’s available, the more likely
that some of it will make its way into the futures and options markets.
Linking money supply and 
commodity tendencies
As a general rule, futures prices respond to inflation. Some, such as gold,
tend to rise; others, such as the U.S. dollar, tend to fall. Here is a quick-and-
dirty guide to general money supply/commodity tendencies:
 Metals, agricultural products, oil, and livestock contracts generally tend
to rise along with money supply.
 Generally, bond prices fall, and interest rates or bond yields rise in
response to inflation.
 Stock index futures are more variable in their relationship with the
money supply, but eventually, they tend to rise when interest rates are
falling, and they tend to fall when interest rates reach a high enough level.
 Currencies tend to fall with inflation.
In a global economy, many of these dynamics occur simultaneously or in close
proximity to each other, which is why an understanding of the global economy
is more important when trading futures than when trading individual stocks.

Putting money supply info to good use
The key to making money by using money supply information is to have a
good grip on whether the Fed actually is putting money into the system or
taking it out. What’s even more important is how fast the Fed is doing what-
ever it’s doing at the time.
I have a quick-and-dirty formula that I use to figure out how fast the money
supply is growing or shrinking. Every week I check Barron’s Web site
(www.barrons.com). From the home page, I click on Market Lab, and then I
look for a Money Supply table that can be found under the “Economy &
Money” heading. Figure 2-1 is a reproduction of one of the tables. Because I’m
not an economist, I ignore the seasonal adjustments and go straight to the
raw data in the table, calculating a ratio of the growth rate. Although it isn’t
scientific, it works.

For example, I plug the M2 numbers for the same time frame this year and
last into this simple equation:
[(This year’s M2 ÷ Last year’s M2) – 1] × 100 = percentage growth
With the numbers from Figure 2-1 plugged in, the equation looks like this:
[(6,471.4 ÷ 6,176.8) – 1] × 100 = 4.7 percent
The 4.7 percent growth rate is what I care about, because that’s how fast the
M2 money supply grew during the past year and that means that on a yearly
basis, as of the date in the figure, 4.7 percent more money was in circulation
than the year before.
The money supply growth rate, when put together with other market indicators
such as consumer prices and the Commodity Research Bureau (CRB) Index (a
measure of global commodities markets), can be a useful trading tool. So don’t
limit your observations to just what the Fed is doing.
Don’t get bogged down with the esoteric aspects of money supply. The key is
to understand the following concept: At some point in the future, it may come
to pass that global central banks have put so much money into circulation
that money supply may become as important an indicator as it was in
decades past. If and when that time comes, the inflation-sensitive markets,
such as gold, energy, and grains, are likely to become very active. When that
happens, you need to be able to trade them effectively.
Connecting money flows 
to financial markets
When central banks buy bonds from banks and dealers, they’re putting
money into circulation, making it easier for people and businesses to borrow.
When money becomes easier to borrow, the potential for commodity markets
to become explosive reaches its zenith because commodity markets thrive
on money. The commodity markets’ actions are directly related to interest
rates; underlying supply; and the perceptions and actions of the public, gov-
ernments, and traders as they react to supply (how much is available and
how fast it’s going to be used up) and, to a lesser degree, demand (how long
this period of rising demand is likely to last).
The higher the money supply, the easier it is to borrow, and the higher the
likelihood that commodity markets will rise. As more money chases fewer
goods, the chances of inflation rise, and the central banks begin to make it
more difficult to borrow money. Keep good tabs on the rate of growth of the
money supply, and you’ll probably be ahead of the curve on what future
trends in the markets are going to be.

Chapter 2: Being a Savvy Futures and Options Trader
Book III
Futures and

To make big money in all financial markets, futures and options included, you
have to find out how to spot changes in the trend of how easy or difficult it is
to borrow money. The perfect time to enter positions is as near as possible to
those inflection points in the flow of money — when they appear on the charts
as changes in the direction of a long-standing trend. These moves can come
before or after any changes in money supply or adjustments to borrowing
power appear. However, when a market trends in one direction (up or down)
for a considerable amount of time and suddenly changes direction after you
notice a blip in the money supply data, you know that something important is
happening, and you need to pay close attention to it.
Digesting Economic Reports
Each month the U.S. government and the private sector generate and release
a steady flow of economic data. These reports are a major influence on how
the futures and the financial markets move in general. They’re also a source
of the cyclicality, or repetitive nature, of market movements. These reports
provide futures and options traders with a major portion of the road map
they need to decide which way the prices in their respective markets are gen-
erally headed.
Economic reports provide you with sources of new information. As a trader,
you can best use them as
 Risk management tools: You can place your money at risk if you ignore
any of the reports. Each has the potential for providing important
information that can create key turning points in the market.
 Harbingers of more important information: Individual headlines about
economic reports are only part of the important data. The markets
explore more data beyond what’s contained in the initial release.
Sometimes data hidden deep within a report become more important
than the initial knee-jerk reaction characterized within the headlines and
cause the market to reverses its course.
 Trend-setters: Current reports may not always be what matters. The
trend of the data from reports during the last few months, quarters, or
years, in addition to expectations for the future, also can be powerful
information that moves the markets up or down.
 Planning tools: Trading solely on economic reports can be very risky
and requires experience and thorough planning on your part.
Cable news outlets, major financial Web sites, and business radio networks —
CNBC and Bloomberg are two that I follow — broadcast every major report
as it is released, and the wire services send out alerts regarding the reports
158
Book III: Futures and Options 

to all major financial publishers not already covering the releases. The gov-
ernment agencies and companies that are responsible for the reports also
post them on their respective Web sites immediately.
As a trader, your world is highly dependent on the economic calendar, the
listing of when reports will be released for the current month. You can get
access to the calendar in many places. Most futures brokers post the calendar
on their Web sites and can mail you a copy along with key information on
their margin and commission rates. The Wall Street Journal, Marketwatch.com,
and other major news outlets also publish the calendar, either posted for the
month or for a particular day or week.
The employment report
The U.S. Department of Labor’s employment report is the first piece of major
economic data. It’s released on the first Friday of every month and is formally
known as the Employment Situation Report. Bond, stock index, and currency
futures are keyed upon the release of the number at 8:30 a.m. eastern time.
The report is so important that it can set the trend for overall trading in the
entire arena of the financial markets for several weeks after its release. The
employment report is most important when the economy is shifting gears,
similar to the way it did after the events of September 11, 2001, and during
the 2004 presidential election.
When consecutive reports show that a dominant trend is in place, the trend of
the overall market tends to remain in the same direction for extended periods
of time. The reversal of such a dominant trend can often be interpreted as a
signal that bonds, stock indexes, and currencies are going to change course.
Traders use the employment report as one of several important clues to pre-
dict the future of interest rates. For trading purposes, there are two major
components of the employment report:
 The number of new jobs created: This number tends to predict which
way the strength of the economy is headed. Large numbers of new jobs
usually mean that the economy is growing. When the number of new
jobs begins to fall, it’s usually a sign that the economy is slowing.
 The unemployment rate: The rate of unemployment is more difficult to
interpret, but the trend in the rate is more important than the actual
monthly number. Full employment usually is a sign that interest rates
are going to rise, so the markets begin to factor that into the equation.
Be ready to make trades based on the reaction to the report and not neces-
sarily on the report itself. As with all economic and financial reports, the
report may not be as important as the market’s reaction in terms of a trader
making or losing money.

The Consumer Price Index (CPI)
The CPI is the main inflation report for the futures and financial markets.
Unexpected rises in this indicator usually lead to falling bond prices, rising
interest rates, and increased market volatility. Consumer prices are impor-
tant because consumer buying drives the U.S. economy. No consumer
demand at the retail level means no demand for products along the other
steps in the chain of manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers. Following are
some key factors to consider regarding the CPI:
 Prices at the consumer level are not as sensitive to supply and demand
as they are to the ability of retailers to pass their own costs on to
consumers. Clothing retailers, for example, can’t always or immediately
pass their wholesale costs for fabric components or labor to consumers,
because consumers will start buying discount clothing if premium apparel
is too expensive.
 Supply tends to be more important than demand. When enough of
something is available, prices tend to stay down. Scarcities, however,
don’t necessarily mean inflation (but they certainly can accompany it).
 Inflationary expectations and consumer prices are related. Inflationary
expectations are built into the cost of borrowing money.
The relationship between prices and interest rates is key to developing
an intuitive feeling for futures trading. The true return on an investment
is the percentage of the investment that you gain after accounting for
inflation. If your portfolio gains 20 percent for five years and inflation is
running at 10 percent during that period, you actually gain only 10
percent per year.
 By the time prices begin to rise at the consumer level, the supply-and-
demand equation, price discovery, and pressure on the system have
been ongoing at other levels of the price chain for some time.
 As a trader, you want to know what the core CPI number is — that is,
prices at the consumer level without food and energy factored in. For
example, the April 2005 CPI was a classic report. The initial line from the
Labor Department quoted consumer prices as rising 0.7 percent, a
number that, if it stood alone, would have caused a big sell-off in the
bond market. However, as the report revealed, the core number was
unchanged. As a result, bonds and stock futures had a big rally, which
spilled over into the stock market that day.
The release of the CPI usually moves the markets for interest-rate, currency,
and stock index futures, and it’s one of the best reports with which to trade
option strategies, such as straddles. (For more about options strategies, see
Chapters 3 and 4.)
160
Book III: Futures and Options 

The Producer Price Index (PPI)
The PPI is an important report, but it doesn’t usually cause market moves as
big as the CPI and the employment report create. The PPI measures prices 
at the producer level (the cost of raw materials to companies that produce
goods). The market is interested in two things contained in this report:
 How fast these prices are rising: If a rise in PPI is significantly large in
comparison to previous months, the market checks to see where it’s
coming from. For example, the May 2005 PPI report pegged prices at the
producer level as rising 0.6 percent in April, following a 0.7-percent increase
in March and a 0.4-percent hike in February. At first glance, the market
viewed the April increase (compared to the previous two months) as a
negative number. However, market makers discovered a note deeper in
the report indicating that if you didn’t measure food and energy — in
this case (especially) oil prices — producer prices at the so-called core
level rose only 0.1 percent. The market looked at the core level, and
bonds rallied.
 Whether producers are passing along any price hikes to their
consumers: If prices at the core level are tame, as they seemed to be in
the April 2005 report, traders will conduct business based on the
information they have in hand at least until the CPI is released — usually
one or two days after the PPI is released. In this case, based only on the
PPI, inflation at the core producer level was tame, so traders wagered
that producers were not passing any added costs onto the consumer.
The ISM and purchasing managers’ reports
The Institute for Supply Management’s (ISM) Report on Business, which mea-
sures the health of the manufacturing sector in the United States, is a market
mover. It’s based on the input of purchasing managers surveyed across the
country and is compiled by the ISM. The Report on Business is different from
regional purchasing managers’ reports. (The regional reports aren’t used as a
basis for the national report.) However, some regional reports, such as the
Chicago-area report, often serve as good predictors of the national data.
The report addresses 11 categories, including the widely watched headline,
the purchasing managers’ index (PMI). The data for the entire report are
included with a summary of the economy’s current state and pace near the
headline.
161
Chapter 2: Being a Savvy Futures and Options Trader
Book III
Futures and
Options

Here are a couple key questions to ask when looking at the ISM report:
 Are the main index and subsector numbers above or below 50? A
number above 50 on the PMI means that the economy is growing.
 Is the pace of growth slowing or picking up speed? You can get this
information at the ISM Web site, www.ism.ws/ISMReport/ROB052005.cfm.
Consumer confidence reports
Consumer confidence reports come from two sources: The Conference Board,
Inc., a private research group, and the University of Michigan. The Conference
Board publishes a monthly report based on survey interviews of 5,000
consumers. Here are the key components of The Conference Board survey:
 The monthly index
 Current conditions
 Consumers’ outlook for the next six months
The University of Michigan conducts its own survey of consumer confidence,
and it publishes several preliminary reports and one final report per month.
Here are the key components of the University of Michigan survey:
 The Index of Consumer Confidence
 The Index of Consumer Expectations
 The Index of Current Economic Conditions
The Beige Book
The Summary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions, otherwise
known as the Beige Book, is released eight times per year. In each tome, the
Fed produces a summary of current economic activity in each of its 12 federal
districts, based on anecdotal information from Fed bank presidents, key
businesses, economists, and market experts, among other sources. The 
Beige Book is released to the members of the Federal Open Market Committee
(FOMC) before each of its meetings on interest rates, so it’s an important
source of information for the committee members when they’re deciding in
what direction they’ll vote to take interest rates.
The 12 Federal Reserve District Banks are located in Boston, New York,
Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis,
Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco.
162
Book III: Futures and Options 

Traders look for any mention of labor shortages and wage pressures in the
Beige Book. If any such trends are mentioned, bonds may sell off, as rising
wage pressures are taken as a sign of building inflation in the pipeline.
Here’s a good habit to get into so you can capitalize on knowledge from one
area of the market as you apply it to another: After the initial headlines and
market reactions, I like to read through the report on the Internet. You can
find links to it on the Fed’s Web site, www.federalreserve.gov, or you can do
a Google or Yahoo! search for “Beige Book.” What I look for when I scan the
full text on the Web is what the Beige Book says about individual sectors of
the economy. Under manufacturing in April 2005, the Beige Book said that
although little pickup was reported in the growth for electronics, slightly
rising demand was noted for networking switches and other related products
in telecommunications. If you see something like that, you can start looking
at the action of key stocks in that sector. Interestingly, the stock of Cisco
Systems, the leader in switches and related products, made a good bottom in
the month of April, and on April 21, a day after the Beige Book was released,
it began to rally. By May 20, the stock was up 13.26 percent.
The Beige Book usually is released in the afternoon, one or two hours before
the stock market closes. The overall trend of all markets can reverse late in the
day when the data in the report surprise traders.
Housing starts
Bond and stock traders like housing starts, because housing is a central
portion of the U.S. economy, given its dependence on credit and the fact that
it uses raw materials and provides employment for a significant number of
people in related industries, such as banking, the mortgage sector, construction,
manufacturing, and real-estate brokerage. Big moves often occur in the bond
market after the numbers for housing starts are released. Released every
month, housing starts are compiled by the U.S. Commerce Department and
reported in three parts:
 Building permits
 Housing starts
 Housing completions
The markets focus on the percentage of rise or fall in the numbers from the
previous month for each component.
This data can be greatly affected by weather, so this report is also seasonally
adjusted and includes a significant amount of revised data within each of the
internal components. For example, when winter arrives, snow storms and
cold weather tend to halt or slow new and ongoing construction projects, so
housing permits and housing starts can decline. If you don’t know that, you
163
Chapter 2: Being a Savvy Futures and Options Trader
Book III
Futures and
Options

can make trading mistakes by betting that interest rates are going to fall.
Markets look at the seasonally adjusted numbers, which are smoothed out by
statistical formulas used by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Even then,
this set of numbers is tricky. The Commerce Department disclaimer notes
that it can take up to four months of data to come up with a reliable set of
indicators.
Index of Leading Economic Indicators
The Index of Leading Economic Indicators is a lukewarm indicator that some-
times moves the markets and other times doesn’t. It is more likely to move
the markets whenever it clearly diverges from data provided by other indica-
tors. In calculating its Index of Leading Economic Indicators, the Conference
Board looks at ten key indicators:
 Index of consumer expectations
 Real money supply
 Interest-rate spread
 Stock prices
 Vendor performance
 Average weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance
 Building permits
 Average weekly manufacturing hours
 Manufacturers’ new orders for nondefense capital goods
 Manufacturers’ new orders for consumer goods and materials
Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
The report on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) measures the sum of all the
goods and services produced in the United States. Although GDP can yield
confusing and mixed results on the trading floor, it sometimes is a big market
mover whenever it’s far above or below what the markets are expecting it to
be. At other times, GDP is not much of a mover. Multiple revisions of previous
GDP data accompany the monthly release of the GDP and tend to dampen the
effect of the report. Although the GDP is not a report to ignore, by any means,
it usually isn’t as important as the employment report, CPI, and PPI.
GDP has a component called the deflator, which is a measure of inflation. The
deflator can be the prime mover whenever it is above or below market
expectations.

Oil supply data
The Energy Information Administration (EIA), a part of the U.S. Department of
Energy, and the American Petroleum Institute (API) release oil supply data for
the previous week at 10:30 a.m. eastern time every Wednesday. Traders want
to know the following:
 Crude oil supply: The crude oil supply is the basis for the oil markets
and is important year-round. Every week, oil experts and commentators
guess what the number will be.
A build occurs when the stockpiles of crude oil in storage are increasing.
Such increases are considered bearish or negative for the market because
large stockpiles generally mean lower prices at the pump. A drawdown,
on the other hand, is when the supply shrinks. Traders like drawdown
situations because prices tend to rise after the news is released.
 Gasoline supply: Gasoline supplies are more important as the summer
driving season approaches.
 Distillate supply: Distillate supply figures are more important in winter
because they essentially represent a measure of the heating oil supply.
Although the experts and commentators are almost never right in their
predictions, the fact that they’re wrong sets the market up for more volatility
when the numbers come out and give you a trading opportunity if you’re set
up to take advantage of it.
Other factors affecting the volatility of this market include the following:
 Changes in the market due to problems with refinery capacity: In the
United States, we saw this factor have a big impact after hurricanes
Katrina and Rita in 2005.
 Inaccurate interpretation of the data by reporters: Although this scenario
is not frequent, I’ve seen it happen, and I’ve seen it have an effect on
trading.
A good way to set up for the oil report, or any report, is to set up an options
strategy called a straddle, which I discuss in Chapter 3.
A bevy of other reports
The hodgepodge of data that trickles out of the woodwork throughout the month
about retail sales, personal income, industrial production, and the balance of
trade sometimes causes a bit of commotion in the futures markets. However,
these individual reports mostly cause only a few daily ripples — unless, of
course, the effect of the data is dramatic.

As a futures and options trader, you need to know that these reports are
coming, but a good portion of the time, they come and go without fanfare or
trouble unless the economy is at a critical turning point and one of these
reports happens to be the missing piece to the puzzle.
Adding Technical Analysis 
to Your Toolbox
After you become better acquainted with the basic drivers and influences of
a particular market and how that information — key market-moving reports,
the major players involved, and the general fundamentals of supply and
demand — fits into the big picture of the marketplace in general, the next
logical step is to become acquainted with how the fundamentals are combined
with the data that is compiled in price charts. And that leads you to the field
of technical analysis: the use of price charts, moving averages, trend lines,
volume relationships, and indicators for identifying trends and trading
opportunities in underlying financial instruments.
Technical analysis is the key to success in the futures and options markets.
The more you know about reading charts, the better your trading results are
likely to be. Aside from its key role in decision-making, technical analysis is
also a tool that leads you toward exploring more information about why the
pattern suggests that you need to buy, sell, or sell short the underlying
instrument.
By becoming proficient at reading the charts of various security prices, you
gain quick access to significant amounts of information, such as prices, gen-
eral trends, and info about whether a market is sold out and ready to rally or
overbought, meaning few buyers are left and prices can fall. By combining your
knowledge of the markets and trading experiences with excellent charting
skills, you vastly improve your market reaction time and your ability to make
informed trades.

 Covering the basics of trading on margin
 Introducing put and call option strategies
 Tackling more advanced trading strategies: straddles and strangles
T
he four mainstream groups of options available to trade are options on
stocks, index options, options on futures, and long-term options on stocks.
Each has its own particular quirks but still is dependent on the basic rules of
volatility and the action of the underlying asset (refer to Chapter 2). This
chapter deals mainly with stock options, the most popular set of options.
This chapter covers the basic option strategies in the stock market. It isn’t
meant to cover every possible permutation of this complex style of investing;
however, it does cover the more commonly used strategies and offers plenty
of examples to get you going. The first strategy, trading on margin, is a key
concept to futures and options trading.
Paper trading — simulating or practicing trades on paper before you make 
real trades — is never a bad idea. If you’re a beginner who insists on trading real
money, trade only in small lots or small amounts of money, one contract at a
time. Finding a good options advisor/broker, one with a conscience who can
run your option strategies for you — at least until you get your feet wet — is
another worthy consideration.
Trading on Margin
To be a successful futures and options trader, you need to understand the ins
and outs of trading on margin. Margin is what makes futures trading so attrac-
tive, because it adds leverage to futures contract trades. Trading on margin
enables you to leverage your trading position — that is, control a larger amount
of assets with a smaller amount of money. Margins in the futures market generally
are low; they tend to be near the 10 percent range, so you can control, or trade,

168
Book III: Futures and Options 
$100,000 worth of commodities or financial indexes with only $10,000 or so in
your account. The downside is that if you don’t understand how trading on a
margin works, you can take on some big losses in a hurry.
You can reduce the risk of buying futures on margin by
 Trading contracts that are lower in volatility.
 Using advanced trading techniques such as spreads, or positions in which
you simultaneously buy and sell contracts in two different commodities
or the same commodity for two different months, to reduce the risk. An
example of an intramarket spread is buying March crude oil and selling
April crude. An example of an intermarket spread is buying crude oil and
selling gasoline.
Trading on margin in the stock market is a different concept than trading on
margin in the futures market:
 In the stock market, the Federal Reserve sets the allowable margin at 50
percent; to trade stocks on margin, you must put up 50 percent of the
value of the trade. Futures margins are set by the futures exchanges and
are different for each different futures contract. Margins in the futures
market can be raised or lowered by the exchanges, depending on cur-
rent market conditions and the volatility of the underlying contract.
Futures markets margins by design are lower than other margins,
because futures contracts are meant to be highly leveraged trading
instruments, and their main attraction is the potential they have for
yielding large profits with small cash requirements. The flip side, of
course, is the risk involved.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which governs the trading
of stocks and options on stocks, changed margin requirements for options
trading in 1999 and now allows brokers to lend up to 25 percent of the required
margin to options traders, which means you must keep 75 percent of the
value of your positions in your account to be able to continue trading
options on margin. That amount is important because the amount of money
that the broker is allowed to lend you to trade options is less than the amount
of money he can lend you for trading stocks. In other words, options already
have a great deal of leverage and risk built into them, and the SEC is trying
to keep traders from taking risks to levels that can lead to losing the entire
value of their account.
Also, you can’t purchase options on margin, as you can stocks, if the life
of the option is nine months or less. However, if the option has a life of
greater than nine months, the broker can lend you 25 percent.
 Generally, when you deposit a margin on a stock purchase, you buy partial
equity of the stock position and owe the balance as debt. In the futures
market, a margin acts as a security deposit that protects the exchange
from default by the customer or the brokerage house.

 When you trade futures on margin, in most cases you buy the right to
participate in the price changes of the contract. Your margin is a sign of
good faith, or a sign that you’re willing to meet your contractual obligations
with regard to the trade.
Margin requirements for different options and strategies sometimes are diffi-
cult to calculate and may vary among different brokers. Before setting up an
account, read the options and margin agreements from your broker carefully
so that you fully understand margin requirements for each individual class of
options you’re trading.
Writing Calls
When you write a call, you sell someone the right to buy an underlying stock
from you at a strike price that’s specified by the option series. As the writer,
you are now short the option. The buyer of your call is long the option. You
also are obligated to deliver the stock if the buyer decides to exercise the call
option.
As a call writer, you are hoping that
 The stock goes nowhere.
 You collect the premium.
 The option expires worthless so you don’t have to come up with a hundred
shares of the stock to settle when the holder exercises the call, which is
what can happen with naked call writing.
Choosing to be naked or covered
When you write a naked call option, you’re selling someone else a chance to
bet that the underlying stock is going to go higher in price. The catch is that
you don’t own the stock, so if the buyer exercises the option, you need to buy
the stock at the market price to meet your obligation. When you write a
covered call option, you already own the shares. If you’re exercised against,
you just sell your shares at the strike price.
Covered call writing is a perfect strategy if you’re looking to smooth out your
portfolio’s performance and collect the extra income from the call premiums.
When the call expires worthless, you get to keep the stock (which you already
own) and collect all the dividends that accrued during the time the call was
in play. When you write naked calls (in which you don’t own the stock), if the
call expires worthless, you still keep the premium.
169
Chapter 3: Basic Trading Strategies
Book III
Futures and
Options

Writing covered calls is a safer strategy than writing naked calls. If the holder
exercises a naked call option, you have to buy the stock before you can deliver
it to him. If the stock price has risen in the interim, you could sustain a serious
loss in meeting the exercise. You can get around losing a lot of money when
writing naked calls by figuring out your break-even point and unwinding the
position if the price reaches that point. Getting out of the trade at your break-
even point enables you to decide what you’re willing to lose before ever
making a trade.
Doing your homework
When you write calls, think of your stock and your option as two different parts
of one single position. Each part has its own role to play and is dependent on
the other to perform a complete job for your portfolio. Each part also has its
own cost, so you need to know the price of the stock when you bought it and
add in the price of the premium that you gain when you sell the call.
Before you write a call, figure out how much you get from the strike price and
the premium if the call option is exercised against you. Always know your
worst-case scenario before you hit the trade button. Here are some additional
tips to keep in mind about writing calls:
 A low volatility stock is perfect for call option writing.
 Writing in-the-money options generally lets you collect a better premium
than writing out-of-the-money options; however, the profit potential is
greater when you write out-of-the-money call options.
 For the covered-call strategy to work best, try to execute the trades —
buy the stock and write the call option — at the same time by establishing
a net position in which your goal is to achieve your net price, or the price
you set as your investment goal for the order. You can establish a net
position by placing a contingent order with your broker, which stipulates
how you want the order executed.
Contingent orders — also referred to as net orders — are not guaranteed
by the broker. They’re also referred to as not-held orders, because if the
broker thinks the order is too difficult to fill, you’ll receive a “nothing
done” report, and the order won’t be filled.
 If you’re unwilling to sell the stock against which you’re writing the
covered call, you shouldn’t even consider writing the option. You’ll
probably get hurt if someone exercises a call against you.
 If you change your mind after selling an option, you can buy it back in
the marketplace. The buyer can also sell his options to the marketplace.
This rule applies to both puts and calls.
170
Book III: Futures and Options 

Protecting your trade by diversification
A diversification strategy is pretty simple, and it works best when you own
more than a couple hundred shares of a stock. In this strategy, you sell more
than one covered call at different strike prices and for different time frames.
Again, the goal is to spread out your risk against volatility and your risk
against the call you sold being exercised. You accomplish this strategy by
writing in-the-money calls on some stocks and out-of-the-money calls on
other stocks in your portfolio.
Setting up this strategy is difficult because writing out-of-the-money calls
theoretically works better when you write them against stocks that do well.
In other words, you’re forced to decide which stocks you think are likely to
do better than others, which is difficult to do in a simple stock-picking strat-
egy without the option strategy. Conversely, writing in-the-money calls works
better for stocks with low volatility. One way to get around this problem is to
write half of the position against in-the-money and half against out-of-the-
money on the same stock.
171
Chapter 3: Basic Trading Strategies
Book III
Futures and
Options
Writing a covered call: An example
Here’s an example of writing a covered call,
loosely adapted from Lawrence G. McMillan’s
Options as a Strategic Investment.Buy 500 shares
of ABC stock, at $38, in January, and sell five July
$40 call options at 3, for a total of $1,500. With this
strategy, you’ve established a covered-call posi-
tion with a six-month duration. Selling the options
gives you $1,500, or 3 points per share of down-
side protection on your 500 shares of ABC. (In
options language, a point, as it pertains to this
example, is worth $100.)
You lose money on your overall position if the
price of your stock falls more than the amount
of downside protection you gained by selling
the call option. In other words, if ABC drops
below $35, you’ve lost money on the overall
position. (This is why you really need to do the
math before you ever write a call.)
Think about it. If the price of ABC falls 3 points ($3
per share) and you still own the stock, you’ve lost
$1,500 of the value of that portion of the position.
However, because you wrote call options, you
had $1,500 worth of downside protection, so at
the $35 price level, you’re essentially breaking
even. In other words, by using the call-writing
strategy, you’re essentially back where you
started on the overall position. The alternative
would have been a $1,500 loss (in the value of the
stock — at least on paper) had you not written
the call option and held the stock without the
protection of the option strategy.

Following up after writing a call
Your job as an options trader starts when you make the transaction. The
heavy lifting is what lies ahead — managing the position, which is more difficult
in some ways than opening the position. Here are two important factors in
managing the position:
 What to do if a stock falls after you’ve written a covered call
 What to do as the covered call approaches expiration
Knowing what to do when the stock rises
If your stock goes up, you can just let the buyer have it at the higher price.
You made your premium, and you sold your stock at a price that you were
comfortable with. If you want to be aggressive, you can buy back your option
and roll up, or write another call at a higher strike price. When you do, though,
you incur a debit in your trade, because you have to put up more money into
the account.
Rolling up can be risky, because you can end up with a loss. Lawrence
McMillan, author of Options as a Strategic Investment (Prentice-Hall Press),
suggests that you shouldn’t roll up whenever you can’t withstand a 10-percent
correction in the stock’s price.
When the expiration time nears: Rolling forward
Rolling forward is what you may want to do as your option’s expiration time
nears. When you roll forward, you buy back your option and sell a new one
with a longer term but the same strike price. Although you could let the stock
be called away, if your stock has low volatility and your option strategy has
been working for you, rolling forward usually is best. How you make your
decision is based on your projected costs of commissions and fees, and what
your break-even point will be for the position.
If you’re writing calls, make sure you’re willing to let the underlying stock get
called away. Otherwise, you’re likely to become sorry at some point. If the
position is going against you and you keep rolling up and forward, you’re
probably only making matters worse. At some point, you will hit the panic
button and buy back your calls at a loss. You’ll probably start selling put
options to generate some credits, but you’ll also end up placing yourself in a
position that can wipe out your whole account.
172
Book III: Futures and Options 

Buying Calls
Call buying is different from call writing, because it isn’t usually used by
traders as a hedge against risk. Instead, call buying is used to make money 
on stocks that are likely to go up in price. Call buying is the most common
technique used by individual investors, but beware that success in this 
form of trading requires good stock-picking skills and a sense of timing.
The main attraction of buying call options is the potential for making large
sums of money in short amounts of time, while limiting downside risk to only
the original amount of money that you put up when you bought the option.
Here are two reasons for buying call options:
 You expect the stock to rise. ABC stock is selling at $50, and you buy a
six-month call, the December 55, at $3. You pay $300 for the position. For
the next six months you have a chance to make money if the stock rises
in price. If the stock goes up 10 points, or 20 percent, your option also
will rise, and because of leverage, the option will be worth much more. If
the price drops below $55 by the expiration date, all you lose is your
original $300 if you didn’t sell back the option prior to that.
 You expect to have money later and don’t want to miss a move up in a
stock. Say, for example, that you expect a nice sum of money in a couple
of weeks, and a stock you like is starting to move. You can buy an option
for a fraction of the price of the stock. When you get your money, if you’re
still interested, you can exercise your option and buy the stock. If 
you’re wrong, you lose only a fraction of what you would have by
owning the stock.
When you buy a call option, you pay for it in full. You have to post no margin.
Here’s some advice to keep in mind when buying call options:
 Choose the right stock. Buy call options on stocks that look ready to
break out. That means that you need to become familiar with charting
techniques and technical analysis (see Book VIII).
 Use charts over fundamentals when you trade call options.
 Out-of-the-money calls have greater profit potential and greater risk.
 In-the-money calls may perform better when the stock does not move as
you expected.
 Don’t buy cheap call options just because they’re cheap.
 Near-term calls are riskier than far-term calls.
 Intermediate-term calls may offer the best risk/reward ratio.
173

Calculating the break-even 
price for calls and puts
Before you buy any call option, you must calculate the break-even price by
using the following formula:
Strike price + Option premium cost + Commission and transaction costs =
Break-even price
So if you’re buying a December 50 call on ABC stock that sells for a $2.50 pre-
mium and the commission is $25, your break-even price would be
$50 + $2.50 + 0.25 = $52.75 per share
That means that to make a profit on this call option, the price per share of
ABC has to rise above $52.75.
To calculate the break-even price for a put option, you subtract the premium
and the commission costs. For a December 50 put on ABC stock that sells at a
premium of $2.50, with a commission of $25, your break-even point would be
$50 – $2.50 – 0.25 = $47.25 per share
That means the price per share of ABC stock must fall below $47.25 for you to
make a profit.
Make sure that you understand the fee structure used by your broker before
making any option trades. Fees differ significantly from one broker to the next.
Brokers frequently charge round-trip fees, which refer to the fees that you’re
charged on the way in and on the way out of an options trading position. To
figure out round-trip commission fees in the break-even formula, simply
double the commission cost.
Using delta to time call-buying decisions
Delta (which I explain in Chapter 1) measures the amount by which the price
of the call option will change, up and down, every time the underlying stock
moves 1 point.
In a day-trading situation, McMillan recommends trading the underlying stock.
This strategy follows the key concept of using delta: The shorter the term of
the strategy, the greater your delta should be. The delta of the underlying stock
is 1.0. Thus, the stock is the most volatile instrument and is best suited for day-
trading.
174
Book III: Futures and Options 

How long you expect to hold an option determines in part which option to
buy. Here are some general rules to follow when using delta to time your call
buying:
 For trades that you expect to hold for a week or less, use the highest
delta option you can find, because its moves will correlate the closest
with the underlying asset. In this case, short-term, in-the-money options
are the best bet.
 For intermediate-term trading, usually weeks in duration, use options
with smaller deltas. McMillan recommends using at-the-money options
for this time frame.
 For longer-term trading, choose low-delta options, either slightly out-of-
the-money or longer-term at-the-money options.
Following up after buying a call option
Keep these rules in mind after you buy a call option:
 If the underlying stock tanks, the best course is to sell the call option
and cut your losses.
 If the option rises in price, especially if it doubles in a short period of
time, take some profits.
 It’s better to sell a call than to exercise it because the commission costs
to buy the stock when you exercise the call are usually more than what
it costs to sell the option. Also, if you then turn around and sell the
stock, you’ll pay more of a commission at that time as well.
 If you buy several options and the stock rises significantly, you can take
partial profits by selling a portion of your overall position. For example,
if you bought five calls and the position is profitable, you can sell three
calls and ride the profit train with the remaining ones.
 If you decide to do nothing, you can lose everything at expiration. But if
you sell your profitable initial position and stay out of the options in that
particular stock, you can keep your profit. (For my money, a good profit
in my pocket is better than a great one that may never come.) So remember:
At the beginning of an options trading strategy, keeping it simple is the
best way to go. As you become more experienced, you can start making
more sophisticated bets.

Considering Basic Put Option Strategies
When you buy a put option, you’re hoping that the price of the underlying
stock falls. You make money with puts when the price of the option rises, or
when you exercise the option to buy the stock at a price that’s below the strike
price and then sell the stock in the open market, pocketing the difference. By
buying a put option, you limit your risk of a loss to the premium that you paid
for the put.
If, for example, you bought an ABC December 50 put, and ABC falls to $40 per
share, you can make money either by selling a put option that rises in price
or by buying the stock at $40 on the open market and then exercising the
option, thus selling your $40 stock to the writer for $50 per share, which is
what owning the put gave you the right to do.
Put options are used either as pure speculative vehicles or as protection
against the potential for stock prices to fall. When you buy a put option, you
are accomplishing essentially the same thing as short selling without some of
the more complicated details. Put options also give you leverage because you
don’t have to spend as much money as you would trying to short-sell a stock.
Making the most of your put option buys
Out-of-the-money puts are riskier but offer greater reward potential than in-
the-money puts. The flip side is that if a stock falls a relatively small amount,
you’re likely to make more money from your put if you own an in-the-money
option.
McMillan points out an important point: Call options tend to move more
dramatically than puts. You can buy the right put option, and the underlying
stock may have fallen significantly. Still, the market decided that the put option
should rise only 1 or 2 points. In an ideal world, you’d expect to be greatly
rewarded for buying a put option on a stock that collapses. But, in the world of
options pricing, things are not always what you’d expect them to be because 
of the vagaries of trading, the time to expiration, and other major influences
on option pricing. To avoid disappointment, you’re better off buying in-the-
money puts unless the probability that the underlying stock is going to fall 
by a significant amount is extremely high.
In contrast to call options, you may be able to buy a longer-term put option
for a fairly good price. Doing so is a good idea, because it gives you more
time for the stock to fall. Buying the longer-term put also protects you if the
stock rises, because its premium will likely drop less in price.
176
Book III: Futures and Options 

Dividends make put options more valuable, and the larger the dividend, the
more valuable the put becomes. When stocks go ex-dividend, the day the 
dividend gets paid out, the amount of the dividend reduces the price of the
stock. As the stock falls, the put increases in value. The prices of puts and
calls are not reduced by dividends. Instead, the price reflects the effect of the
dividend on the stock. Call prices fall as the stocks pay out their dividends.
Put prices rise as of the ex-dividend date.
Buying put options — fully dressed
Buying a put option without owning the stock is called buying a naked put.
Naked puts give you the potential for profit if the underlying stock falls. But if
you own a stock and buy a put option on the same stock, you’re protecting
your position and limiting your downside risk for the life of the put option.
A good time to buy a put on a stock that you own is when you’ve made a
significant gain, but you’re not sure you want to cash out. You can also use
puts to protect against short-term volatility in long-term holdings. In the first
instance, your put option acts as an insurance policy to protect your gains. In 
the second instance, if your put goes up in value, you can sell it and decrease the
paper losses on your stock. You decide which put option to buy by calculating how
much profit potential you’re willing to lose if the stock goes up.
Out-of-the-money puts are cheap, but they won’t give you as much protection
as in-the-money puts until the stock falls to the strike price. In-the-money puts
are more expensive but can provide better insurance.
Selling naked and covered puts
Selling naked put options is similar to buying a call option, because you make
money when the underlying stock goes up in price. Selling naked puts means
you’re selling a put option without being short the stock, and in the pro-
cess, you’re hoping that the stock goes nowhere or rises, which enables you
to keep the premium without being assigned. If the stock falls in a big way,
and you get assigned, you can face big losses from having to buy the stock in
the open market to sell it to the party exercising the put you sold.
You need to put up collateral to write naked puts, usually in an amount that is
equal to 20 percent of the current stock price plus the put premium minus any
out-of-the-money amount. Here is how it works: ABC is selling at $40 per share,
and a four-month put with a striking price of $40 is selling for 4 points. You
have the potential to make $400 here or the potential for a huge loss if the
stock falls. Your loss is limited only because the stock can’t go below zero.
177
Chapter 3: Basic Trading Strategies
Book III
Futures and
Options

The amount of collateral you’d need to put up would be $400, plus 20 percent
of the price of the stock, or $800. The minimum you’d have to put up, though,
would be 10 percent of the strike price plus the put premium, even if the
amount is smaller than what you just calculated.
Selling covered puts is not particularly recommended for beginners. A put
sale is covered, not by owning the stock, but rather by having an open short
position on the underlying stock. Your margin is covered if you’re also short
the stock. This strategy has unlimited upside risk and limited profit potential
if the underlying stock rises because the short sale will accrue losses. The
position is equivalent to a naked call write, except the covered put writer has
to pay out the dividend of the underlying stock if the stock pays a dividend.
Exercising your put option
Put and call options rarely are exercised in the stock market. Most option
traders take the gains on the options if they have them or cut their losses short
as early as possible if the market goes against them. But if you’re the holder of
a put option and you decide to exercise it, you’re selling the underlying stock
at the striking price, and you can sell the stock at the strike price any time
during the life of the option. If you write, or sell, the put, you’re assigned the
obligation of buying the stock at the strike price.
You can sell stock that you own at the strike price or buy stock in the open
market if you don’t own it, as in the case of a naked strategy, and then sell it
at the strike price. You notify your broker how you’ll deliver or receive the
stock. You must make sure that you can satisfy any margin or other require-
ment involved, and the exercise procedure and share transfer will be handled
by the broker.
Dealing with a huge profit in a put option
If you’re lucky enough to get a nice drop in a stock on which you own a put
option, you can do several things:
 Do nothing.
 Take profits. Doing so guarantees that you lock in a gain if you execute
the trade in a timely manner.
 Sell your in-the-money put and buy an out-of-the money put. By opting
for this strategy, you’re taking partial profits and then extending your
risk and your profit potential if the stock continues to fall.
178
Book III: Futures and Options 

 Create a spread strategy by selling an out-of-the-money put against the
one you already own. This strategy adds an important new wrinkle to
the possible strategies you can use. Your options:
• Sell a different put option than the one you already own. You can,
for instance, sell a December 45 put to offset the already profitable
December 50 put that you own, all so that you make some money off
the sale and lock in some of the costs of having bought the original
December 50 put. If the stock goes above 50, you lose everything.
But if the stock falls below 45 and stabilizes, you make the 5-point
maximum profit from the spread, which is the best of all worlds in
this strategy.
• Buy a call option. You can buy a December 45 call to limit your risk
if the stock rises. See the previous sections about writing calls.
Again your cost would be 5 points. This spread guarantees you 
5 points no matter where the stock closes at expiration.
Spreads get the best results when the stock stabilizes in price after the
spread is put on. But it is more important that the stock price stays in
the profit range of the spread.
The IRS taxes short-term and long-term profits on every sale of every trade
you make, except in a retirement account for which it taxes you later on,
when you withdraw the money. Some tax-specific details you need to know if
you’re trading put options include the following:
 Buying put options has no tax consequences if you’re a long-term holder,
usually greater than six months.
 If you forfeit any accrued time during the holding period, or if you’re a
short-term holder of the stock and you buy a put option, holding time
won’t begin to accrue again until you sell the put, or it expires.
Be sure to consult with your accountant before you trade any options.
Creating Straddles and Strangles
You can create a straddle when you simultaneously buy a put and a call 
for the same stock at the same strike price and of the same duration. With a
straddle, if the underlying stock moves far enough, you can make large poten-
tial profits and limit your losses to the amount of your initial investment.
Straddles are expensive because you are buying equal numbers of puts and calls.
179
Chapter 3: Basic Trading Strategies
Book III
Futures and
Options

You want to build straddles on stocks that are likely to be volatile but that
are in price consolidation patterns at the current time, and you’d like to give
yourself some time before a news announcement or another event is
expected from the company. Buying the straddle two weeks ahead of the
announcement is a decent time frame used by some experienced traders.
If the announcement comes and there is no major move, it’s better to exit
both sides of the straddle within the first one or two days, just in case it
takes a little time for the news to move the stock.
If there is a big move in one direction, you can sell the profitable side of the
trade and hold on to the losing side since the price could retrace. Then you
can sell the other side.
The chances of losing all your money in a straddle are small, but the chances
of making money in this strategy when you hold the position until the expira-
tion date also are small.
Taking small profits in a straddle can cost you money in the long run. You
may have to take a few small losses before you hit a big win. This particular
gut-wrenching quality about straddle strategy is what makes it more suitable
for experienced investors. If you’re interested in straddles, using an experi-
enced options broker/advisor who truly understands this strategy, at least
during your early trading experiences, may be your best option.
You build a strangle with a put and a call that usually have the same expiration
date but different strike prices. Strangles work best when the put and the call
are out-of-the-money. Strangles are a risky strategy because you can lose
money anywhere along the spread, as opposed to straddles where you can
lose money only at the strike price.

T
his chapter is where you get into the big money, starting with interest-
rate futures and taking stock of stock index futures. These markets, in
addition to the currency market (which you can read about in Book V), often
set the tone for the trading day in all markets because they form a focal point
or hub for the global financial system. What’s good about these markets is
that they’re great places for you to get started in futures trading, so I provide
you with tips for doing just that.
Thinking Like a Contrarian
Contrarians trade against the grain at key turning points when shifts in market
sentiment become noticeable. A contrarian, for example, may start looking for
reasons to sell when everyone else is bullish or may consider it a good time to
buy when pessimism about the markets is so thick that you can cut it with a
knife. In this section, I take you through the major aspects of contrarian thinking
and explain how to know when to use it and how to make it part of your trading
arsenal.
Picking apart popular sentiment surveys
Sentiment surveys are used to gauge when a particular market is at an extreme
point with either too much bullishness or too much bearishness. Their major
weakness is that they’re now so popular that their ability to truly mark major
turning points is not as good as it was even in the late 1980s or early 1990s. Still,
when used within the context of good technical and fundamental analysis, they

182
Book III: Futures and Options 
can be useful. Two popular sentiment surveys affect the futures markets: Market
Vane (www.marketvane.net) and Consensus, Inc. (www.consensus-inc.com).
Both offer sentiment data on items such as the following:
 Precious metals: Silver, gold, copper, and platinum
 Financial instruments: Eurodollars, U.S. dollar, Treasury bills (T-bills),
and Treasury bonds (T-bonds)
 Currencies: The U.S. dollar, Euro FX, British pound, Deutschemark,
Swiss franc, Canadian dollar, and Japanese yen
 Agricultural products: Soybean products, meats, grains, other foods
(such as sugar, cocoa, and coffee), and more
 Stock indexes: The S&P 500 and NASDAQ-100 stock indexes
 Energy complex: Crude oil, natural gas, gasoline, and heating oil
Snapshots of both surveys for stocks, bonds, Eurodollars, and Euro currency
are available weekly in Barron’s magazine under the Market Laboratory
section or at Barron’s Online, www.barrons.com. What you’ll find when 
reading Barron’s or another such publication are percentages of market 
sentiment, such as oil being 75 percent bulls, or bullish, which simply 
means that 75 percent of the opinions surveyed by the editors of Market
Vane or Consensus are bullish on oil.
After you find out the market sentiment, you need to perform a bit of technical
analysis. A high bullish reading in terms of sentiment, for example, should alert
you to start looking for technical signs that a top is in place, checking whether
key support levels or trend lines have been breached, or checking whether the
market is struggling to make new highs.
Sentiment survey readings must be at extreme levels to be useful. Sentiments
below 35 to 40 percent for any given category usually are considered bullish,
for example, because few advisors are left to recommend selling. Even so, when
using sentiment to help guide your decision-making, avoid trading on sentiment
data alone, which can be too risky. Always check sentiment tendencies against
technical and fundamental analyses, even though it may make you a little late in
executing your entry or exit trades.
Reading trade volume 
as a sentiment indicator
Trading volume is a direct, real-time sentiment indicator. As a general rule,
high trading volume is a sign that the current trend is likely to continue. Still,
good volume analysis takes other market indicators into account. When
analyzing volume, be sure that you

 Put the current volume trends in the proper context with relationship to
the market in which you’re trading, rather than thinking about hard-and-
fast rules. It’s important to note that trends tend to either start or end
with a volume spike climax (typically twice the 20- or 50-day moving
average of daily volume).
 Remember the differences in the way that volume is reported and
interpreted in the futures market compared with the stock market.
 Check other indicators to confirm what volume is telling you.
 Ask yourself whether the market is vulnerable to a trend change.
 Consider key support and resistance levels.
 Protect your portfolio by being prepared to make necessary changes.
Figure 4-1, which shows the S&P 500 e-mini futures contract for September
2005, portrays an interesting relationship between volume, sentiment, and
other indicators. In April, the market made a textbook bottom. Notice how
the volume bars at the bottom of the chart rose as the market was reaching a
selling climax, as signified by the three large candlesticks, or trading bars. This
combination of signals — large price moves and large volumes when the market
is falling — is often the prelude to a classic market bottom, because traders
were panicking and selling at any price just to get out of their positions.

Options

Notice how the volume trailed off as the market consolidated, or started moving
sideways, making a complex bottom that took almost two weeks to form.
Consolidation is what happens when buyers and sellers are in balance. When
markets consolidate, they’re catching their breath and getting set up for their
next move. Consolidation phases are unpredictable and can last for short peri-
ods of time, such as hours or days, or longer periods, even months to years.
A third important volume signal occurred in late May and early June as the
market rallied. Notice how volume faded as the market continued to rise.
Eventually, the market fell and moved significantly lower as it broke below
key trend-line support. Finally, note that open interest fell during the last
stage of the rally in late June, which usually is a sign that more weakness is
likely, because fewer contracts remain open, suggesting that traders are get-
ting exhausted and are less willing to hold on to open positions.
Using volume indicators in the futures markets has limitations. The example
in Figure 4-1 needs to be viewed within the context of these limitations:
 The release of volume figures in the futures market is delayed by one day.
 Higher volume levels steadily migrate toward the closest delivery month,
or the month in which the contract is settled and delivery of the under-
lying asset takes place. That migration is important for traders, because
the chance of getting a better price for your trade is higher when volume
is better. In June, for example, the trading volume is higher in the S&P
500 futures for the September contract than for other months, because
September is the next delivery month. Volume for the delivery-month
contract increases for a while as traders move their positions to the
front month, or the commonly quoted (price) contract at the time.
 Limit days (especially limit up days), or days in which a particular
contract makes a big move in a short period of time, can have very high
volume, thus skewing your analysis. Limit up or limit down days tend to
happen in response to a single or related series of events, external or
internal, such as a very surprising report. A limit up day, when the market
rises to the limit in a short period of time, usually is a signal of strength in
the market. When markets crash, you can see limit down moves that then
trigger trading collars (periods when the market trades but prices don’t
change) or complete stoppages of trading.
Viewing open interest as a sign
of trend reversal
One of the most useful tools you can have when trading futures, open interest
is the total number of options and/or futures contracts that are not closed or
delivered on a particular day. It is the most useful tool for analyzing potential
184
Book III: Futures and Options 

trend reversals in futures markets. Open interest applies to futures and
options but not to stocks and does the following:
 Measures the total number of short and long positions (shorts and
longs). In the futures markets, the number of longs always equals the
number of shorts. So when a new buyer buys from an old buyer who is
cashing in, no change occurs in open interest.
 Varies based on the number of new traders entering the market and the
number of traders leaving the market.
 Rises by one whenever one new buyer and one new seller enter the
market, thus marking the creation of one new contract.
 Falls by one when a long trader closes out a position with a trader who
already has an open short position.
The exchanges publish open-interest figures daily, but the numbers are delayed
by one day, so the volume and open-interest figures on today’s quotes are only
estimates. Nevertheless, charting open interest on a daily basis in conjunction
with a price chart helps you keep track of the trends in open interest and how
they relate to market prices. Barchart.com (www.barchart.com) offers
excellent free futures charts that give you a good look at open interest.
Rising markets
In a rising trend, open interest is fairly straightforward:
 Bullish open interest: When open interest rises along with prices, it
signals that an uptrend is in place and can be sustained. This bullish sign
also means that new money is moving into the market. Extremely high
open interest in a bull market, however, usually is a danger signal.
 Bearish open interest: Rising prices combined with falling open interest
signal a short-covering rally in which short sellers are reversing their
positions so that their buying actually is pushing prices higher. In this
case, higher prices are not likely to last, because no new buyers are
entering the market.
 Bearish leveling or decline: A leveling off or decrease in open interest in
a rising market often is an early warning sign that a top may be nearing.
Sideways markets
In a sideways market, open interest gets trickier, so you need to watch for the
following:
 Rising open interest during periods when the market is moving side-
ways (or in a narrow trading range). This usually leads to an intense
move after prices break out of the trading range — up or down.
185
Chapter 4: Advanced Speculation Strategies
Book III
Futures and
Options

When dealing with sideways markets, be sure to confirm open-interest
signals by checking them against other market indicators.
 Down-trending price breakouts (breakdowns). Some futures traders
use breakouts on the downside to set up short positions, thus leaving
the public wide open for a major sell-off.
 Falling open interest in a trader’s market. When it happens, traders
with weak positions are throwing in the towel, and the pros are covering
their short positions and setting up for a market rally.
Falling markets
In falling markets, open-interest signals also are a bit more complicated to
decipher:
 Bearish open interest: Falling prices combined with a rise in open interest
indicate that a downtrend is in place and being fueled by new money
coming in from short sellers.
 Bullish open interest: Falling prices combined with falling open interest
signal that traders who had not sold their positions as the market broke —
hoping the market would bounce back — are giving up. In this case, you
need to start anticipating, or even expecting, a trend reversal toward
higher prices after this give-up phase ends.
 Neutral: If prices rise or fall but open interest remains flat, a trend reversal
is possible. You can think of these periods as preludes to an eventual
change in the existing trend. Neutral open-interest situations are good
times to be especially alert.
 Trending down: A market trend that shifts downward at the same time
open interest reaches high levels can be a sign that more selling is
coming. Traders who bought into the market right before it topped out
are now liquidating losing positions to cut their losses.
Combining open interest and volume
You can combine open interest and volume to predict a trend change. Generally,
volume and open interest need to be heading in the same direction as the
market. When the market starts rising, for example, you want to see volume
and open interest expanding. A rising market with shrinking volume and falling
open interest usually is one that is heading for a correction. This is an important
concept. Rising markets should have rising volume and open interest accompa-
nying the rise of prices. That is a sign of strength. Table 4-1 summarizes the
relationship between volume and open interest.

Looking at put/call ratios 
as sentiment indicators
The put/call ratio is the most commonly used sentiment indicator for trading
stocks, but it can also be useful in trading stock index futures because with it
you can pinpoint major inflection points in trader sentiment. At extremes,
put/call ratios can be signs of excessive fear (a high level of put buying relative
to call buying) and excessive greed (a high level of call buying relative to put
buying). However, these indicators aren’t as useful as they once were because
of the more sophisticated hedging strategies now used in the markets.
As a futures trader, put/call ratios can help you make several important decisions
about
 Tightening your stops on open positions.
 Setting new entry points if you’ve been out of the market.
 Setting up hedges with options and futures.
 Taking profits.
The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) updates the put/call ratio
throughout the day at its Web site, www.cboe.com/data/IntraDayVol.aspx,
and provides final figures for the day after the market closes (5 p.m. central
time). Check the put/call ratios after the market closes.
Put/call ratios are best used as alert mechanisms for potential trend changes
and in conjunction with technical analysis. So be sure to look at your charts
and take inventory of your own positions during the time frame in which
you’re trading futures contracts. The sections that follow describe important
ratios you need to become familiar with when trading stock index futures.
187
Chapter 4: Advanced Speculation Strategies
Book III
Futures and
Options

Total put/call ratio
The total put/call ratio is calculated using the following equation:
Total put options purchased ÷ Total call options purchased
The total ratio includes options on stocks, indexes, and long-term options
bought by traders on the CBOE. Although you can make sense of this ratio in
many ways, I’ve found it useful when the ratio rises above 1.0 and when it
falls below 0.5. Above 1.0, the ratio usually means too much fear is in the air
and the market is trying to make a bottom. Readings below 0.5 usually mean
that too much bullishness is in the air and the market may fall.
Index put/call ratio
The index put/call ratio is a good measure of what futures and options players,
institutions, and hedge-fund managers are up to. Above 2.0, this indicator
traditionally is a bullish sign; below 0.90, it becomes bearish and traditionally
signals that some kind of correction is coming. Because these numbers are
not as reliable as they used to be, consider them only as reference points and
never base any trades on them alone. Don’t forget that put/call ratios need to
be correlated with chart patterns.
A word about abnormal ratios
Don’t ignore abnormal put/call ratio readings. Doing so can cost you significant
amounts of money in a hurry. When you see abnormally high or low put/call
ratios, make sure you’re ready to handle dramatic changes and immediately
look for weak spots in your portfolio. Abnormal activity should trigger ideas
about hedging. When you see abnormal put/call ratio numbers, consider
 Tightening stops on your open stock index futures positions.
 Exploring options strategies, such as straddles and strangles (see
Chapter 3).
 Reversing positions. If you have a short position in the market, make
sure you’re ready to reverse and go long, or vice versa if you have a long
position.
 Looking to the bond, currency, and oil markets for other trading oppor-
tunities with a goal of both hedging any problems in your stock index
futures and options and possibly expanding your profits in those areas.
188
Book III: Futures and Options 

Using soft sentiment signs
Soft sentiment signs usually are subtle, nonquantitative factors that most
people tend to ignore. They can be anything from the shoeshine boy giving
stock tips or a wild magazine cover (classic signs of a top) to people jumping
out of windows during a market crash (a classic sign of the other extreme).
These signs can be anywhere from humorous to dramatic. By no means
should you make them a mainstay of your trading strategy, but they can be
helpful. You can find soft sentiment signs in the following places:
 Magazine covers and Web site headlines: Every time crude oil rallies, I
start looking for crazy headlines. When crude oil reached an all-time
high on June 17, 2005, Time’s cover featured the late Mao Tse-tung,
BusinessWeek had senior citizens, and Newsweek had dinosaurs. None of
them even mentioned oil — a good soft sentiment sign that the oil
market still had some room to rise.
 Congressional investigations and activist protests: Political activity and
outrage are usually a sign that things are at a fever pitch, and the trend
can change, possibly in a hurry.
 The Drudge Report: All good traders need to keep an eye on the Drudge
Report, which is a barometer of public opinion (or at least Matt Drudge’s
current attempts to influence public opinion). As a contrary sign for the
markets, the Drudge Report is a useful tool.
As with put/call ratios, wild headlines, Congressional hearings, and plenty of
attention on cable and local news channels are an alert that something
dramatic is going to happen.
Exploring Interest Rate Futures
The bond market rules the world. Everything that anyone does in the finan-
cial markets anymore is built upon interest rate analysis. When interest rates
are on the rise, at some point doing business becomes difficult. When interest
rates fall, eventually economic growth is energized. The relationship between
rising and falling interest rates makes the markets in interest rate futures,
Eurodollars, and Treasuries (bills, notes, and bonds) important for all
consumers, speculators, economists, bureaucrats, and politicians.
189

Bonding with the universe
At the center of the world’s financial universe is the bond market. And at the
center of the bond market is its relationship with the United States Federal
Reserve (the Fed) and the way the Fed conducts interest rate policies. (See
Chapter 2 for more information on the Fed.)
When you buy a bond, you get a fixed return as long as you hold that bond
until it matures or, in the case of some corporate or municipal bonds, until
it’s called in. If you’re getting a 5 percent return on your bond investment and
inflation is growing at a 6-percent clip, you’re already 1 percent in the hole,
which is why bondholders hate inflation.
Grasping the connection between the bond market, the Fed, and the rest of
the financial markets is fundamental to understanding how to trade futures
and options and how to invest in general. In the next section, I discuss the
most important aspects of how they all work together.
The Fed and bond market roles
The Fed cannot directly control the long-term bond rates that determine how
easy (or difficult) it is to borrow money to buy a new home or to finance long-
term business projects. What the Fed can do is adjust short-term interest
rates, such as the interest rate on Fed funds, the overnight lending rate used
by banks to square their books, and the discount rate, the rate at which the
Fed loans money to banks to which no one else will lend money. As the Fed
senses that inflationary pressures are rising, it starts to raise interest rates.
When the Fed raises the Fed funds and/or the discount rates, banks usually
raise the prime rate, the rate that targets their best customers. At the same
time, credit card companies raise their rates.
As the bond market senses inflationary pressures are rising, bond traders sell
bonds and market interest rates rise. Rising market interest rates usually trig-
ger rate increases for mortgages and car loans, which usually are tied to a
bond market benchmark rate.
When it comes to recognizing when inflation is lurking, sometimes the bond
market takes action ahead of the Fed. When that happens, bond prices fall,
market rates rise (such as the yield on the U.S. ten-year T-note), and the Fed
raises rates if its indicators agree with the bond market’s analysis. Whenever
the Fed disagrees with the markets, it signals those disagreements usually
through speeches from Fed governors or even the chairman of the Fed.
190
Book III: Futures and Options 

Interest rates are a two-way street: The bond market sometimes disagrees
with the Fed, and the Fed sometimes disagrees with the markets.
Disagreements between the Fed and the bond market usually occur at the
beginning or at the end of a trend in interest rates. Say, for example, that the
Fed continually raises interest rates for an extended period of time. At some
point, long-term rates, which are controlled by the bond market, begin to
drop, even though short-term rates are on the rise. Falling long-term bond
rates usually are a sign — from the bond market to the Fed — that the Fed
needs to consider pausing its interest rate increases. The opposite also is
true: When the Fed goes too far in lowering short-term rates, bond yields
begin to creep up and signal the need for the Fed to consider a pause in its
lowering of the rates.
Interest rate futures and you
Interest rate futures serve one major function: They enable large institutions
to neutralize or manage their price risks. As an investor or speculator who
trades interest rate futures, you look at the markets differently than banks
and other commercial borrowers. For you, it’s a way to make money based on
the system’s inefficiencies, which often are created by the current relationship
between large hedgers, the Fed, and other major players, such as foreign
governments. Generally, you want to watch for the following:
 Opportunities to trade the long-term issues when interest rates are falling
 Opportunities to stay on the shorter-term side of the curve when interest
rates are rising
Going global with interest rate futures
Globalization has increased the number of short-term interest rate contracts
that trade at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and around the world.
Just about every country with a convertible currency has some kind of bond
or bond futures contract that trades on an exchange somewhere around the
world. The following are not complete lists, but they offer snapshots of some
of the more liquid contracts.
Fed funds futures
Fed funds futures trade on the CME and are an almost pure bet on what the
Federal Reserve is expected to do with future interest rates. Fed funds measure
interest rates that private banks charge each other for overnight loans of excess
reserves. The rates often are quoted in the media as a means of pricing the
probability of the Fed raising or lowering interest rates at an upcoming meeting
into the market.
191
Chapter 4: Advanced Speculation Strategies
Book III
Futures and
Options

Each Fed funds contract lets you control $5 million and is cash settled. The
tick size as described by the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) is “$20.835 per 1⁄2
of one basis point (1⁄2 of 1⁄100 of 1 percent of $5 million on a 30-day basis rounded
up to the nearest cent).” Margins are variable, depending on the tier in which
you trade, and they range from $104 to $675. A tier is just a time frame. The
longer the time frame before expiration, the higher the margin. For full infor-
mation, you can visit the CBOT’s margin page at www.cbot.com/cbot/
pub/page/0,3181,2142,00.html#1b. Fed funds contracts are quoted in
terms of the rate that the market is speculating on by the time the contract
expires, and they’re based on the formula found at the CBOT: “100 minus the
average daily Fed funds overnight rate for the delivery month (for example, a
7.25 percent rate equals 92.75).”
LIBOR futures
LIBOR futures are one-month interest rate contracts based on the London
Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), the interest rate charged between commercial
banks. LIBOR futures have 12 monthly listings. Each contract is worth $3 million.
The role of LIBOR futures is to offer professionals a way to hedge their interest
portfolio in a similar fashion to that offered by Eurodollars.
The minimum increment of price movement is “0.0025 (1⁄4 tick = $6.25) for the
front month expiring contract and 0.005 (1⁄2 tick = $12.50) for all other expira-
tions.” The major difference: Margin requirements are less for LIBOR, at $473
for initial and $350 for margin maintenance, compared with margins of $945
and $700 for respective Eurodollar contracts.
If you’re new to trading, a good way to choose between the highly liquid and
popular Eurodollar and LIBOR contracts — which offer essentially the same
type of trading opportunities — is to paper trade both contracts after doing
some homework on how each contract trades.
Eurodollar contracts
A Eurodollar is a dollar-denominated deposit held in a non-U.S. bank. Eurodollars
are the most popular futures trading contract in the world because they offer
reasonably low margins and the potential for fairly good return in a short period
of time. A Eurodollar contract gives you control of $1 million Eurodollars and is
a reflection of the LIBOR rate for a three-month, $1 million offshore deposit.
Eurodollars are popular trading instruments. Following are some facts 
about Eurodollars that you need to know:
 In the case of Eurodollars, a point = one tick = 0.1 = $25. If you own a
Eurodollar contract and it falls or rises four ticks, or 0.4, you either lose
or gain $100. Eurodollars can trade in 1⁄4 or 1⁄2 points, which are worth
$6.25 and $12.50, respectively.
 Eurodollar prices are a central rate in global business and are quoted in
terms of an index. If the price on the futures contract is $9,200, for example,
the yield is 8 percent.
192
Book III: Futures and Options 

 Eurodollars trade on the CME with contract listings in March, June,
September, and December. Different Eurodollar futures contracts suit
different time frames. Some enable you to trade more than two years from
the current date. This kind of long-term betting on short-term interest
rates is rare, but sometimes large corporations use it. For full details, it’s
always good to check with your broker about which contracts are available,
or go to the CME Web site.
 Trading hours for Eurodollars are from 7:20 a.m. to 2 p.m. central time
on the trading floor, but they can be traded almost 24/7 on Globex. For
Eurodollars, Globex is shut down only between 4 and 5 p.m. daily.
 The initial margin, or the minimum you need in your account (as of this
writing) to trade a single Eurodollar contract at CME, is $743 for non-
exchange members. The maintenance margin, or the minimum you need
in your account to keep the trade going, is $550. But remember that the
exchange minimum is a guideline. More important to you as a trader is
what your broker offers. This amount can vary, and it does not have to
be the exchange minimum. In fact, it is often greater and varies with the
assets’ volatility. This is true for every futures contract.
You want to trade Eurodollars when events are occurring that are likely to
influence interest rates. If you grasp the concept of trading Eurodollars,
you’re also set to trade other types of interest rate futures, as long as you
understand that each individual contract is going to have its own special
quirks and idiosyncrasies. The CME has a good help page that you can find at
www.cme.com/edu/res/bro/cmeinterestrate.
Treasury bill futures
A 13-week T-bill contract is considered a risk-free obligation of the U.S.
government. In the cash market, T-bills are sold in $10,000 increments; if you
pay $9,600 for a T-bill in the cash market, an annualized interest rate of 4 percent
is implied. At the end of the three months (13 weeks), you get $10,000 in return.
Risk-free means that if you buy the T-bills, you’re assured of getting paid by
the U.S. government. Trading T-bill futures, on the other hand, is not risk-free.
Instead, T-bill futures trades essentially are governed by the same sort of risk
rules that govern Eurodollar trades.
T-bill futures are 13-week contracts based on $10,000 U.S. Treasury bills and
have a face value at maturity of $1,000,000. In addition, T-bill futures move in
1⁄2-point increments (1⁄2 point = 0.005 = $12.50) with trading months of March,
June, September, and December.
Bonds and Treasury notes
The 10-year U.S. Treasury note has been the accepted benchmark for long-
term interest rates since the United States stopped issuing the long bond (30-
year U.S. Treasury bond) in October 2001. Thirty-year bond futures and
193
Chapter 4: Advanced Speculation Strategies
Book III
Futures and
Options

30-year T-bonds (issued before 2001) still are actively traded, and new 30-
year T-bonds hit the market in early 2006.
Bond and note futures are big-time trading vehicles that move fast. Each tick
or price quote, especially when you hold more than one contract and the
market is moving fast, can be worth several hundred dollars. Some other
facts about 10- and 30-year interest rate futures that you need to know:
 They’re traded under the symbols TY for pit trading and ZN for electronic
trading in the 10-year contract.
 U.S. note and bond futures have no price limits.
 They’re valued at $100,000 per contract, the same as for a 30-year bond
contract (which is traded under the symbol US for pit trading and ZB for
electronic trading).
 They’re longer-term debt futures that have higher margin requirements
than Eurodollars. As of this writing, the initial and maintenance margins
for the 10-year were $1,148 and $850. Initial and maintenance margins for
the 30-year bond were $1,755 and $1,300 per contract.
 They’re quoted in terms of 32nds. One point is $1,000, and one tick must
be at least
• 1⁄2 of 1⁄32, or $15.625, for a 10-year issue.
• 1⁄32, or $31.25, for a 30-year issue.
When a price quote is “84-16,” it means the price of the contract is 84
and 16⁄32 for both, and the value is $84,500.
 They’re traded on the CME from 7:20 a.m. to 2 p.m. central time Monday
through Friday. Electronic trades can be made from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m.
central time Sunday through Friday.
Trading in expiring contracts closes at noon central time (Chicago time)
on the last trading day, which is the seventh business day before the last
business day of the delivery month.
Taking delivery of T-bonds
If you take delivery, your contract will be wired to you on the last business
day of the delivery month via the Federal Reserve book-entry wire-transfer
system. What you get delivered to you, as of November 2007, is a series of
U.S. Treasury bonds that either cannot be retired for at least 15 years from
the first day of the delivery month or that are not callable with a maturity of
at least 15 years from the first day of the delivery month. The invoice price,
or the amount that you’ll have to tender, equals the futures settlement price
multiplied by a conversion factor with accrued interest added. The conversion
factor used is the price of the delivered bond ($1 par value) to yield the interest
rate that is pertinent to the contract. For full details, you can read these
important chapters of the CBOT rulebook: Chapter 18 for Treasury bond
194
Book III: Futures and Options 

futures, Chapter 23 for two-year Treasury note futures, Chapter 24 for ten-
year Treasury note futures, and Chapter 25 for five-year Treasury note
futures. The CBOT Rulebook can be viewed at www.cbot.com.
Bonds that are not callable remain in circulation until full maturity, which
means that the holder receives all the interest payments until the bond
expires, when the principle is returned. Callable bonds put the holder at risk
of receiving less interest because of an earlier retirement of the bond than
the holder had planned.
Taking delivery of T-notes
If you take delivery of T-notes, you receive a package of U.S. Treasury notes
that mature from 61⁄2 to 10 years from the first day of the delivery month. The
price is calculated by using a formula you can find on the CBOE Web site. As
a small speculator, your chances of getting a delivery are nil.
Euroyen contracts
Euroyen contracts represent Japanese yen deposits held outside of Japan. Open
positions in these contracts can be held at CME or at the SIMEX exchange in
Singapore. Euroyen contracts are listed quarterly, trade monthly, and offer
expiration dates as far out as three years. That long-term time frame can be
useful to professional hedgers with specific expectations about the future.
CETES futures
These 28-day and 91-day futures contracts are based on Mexican Treasury
bills. These instruments are denominated and paid in Mexican pesos, and
they reflect the corresponding benchmark rates of interest rates in Mexico.
Small traders usually trade Eurodollars, while pros with large sums and more
experience tend to trade LIBOR. No matter what contract you trade, though,
think in terms of short holding periods. Consider how much you may actually
have to pay up (if you’re long) if you don’t sell before the contract rolls over
(the amount specified by the contract — $3 million).
Eurobond futures
Longer-term global plays include Eurobond futures. The Eurobond market is
composed of bonds issued by the Federal Republic of Germany and the Swiss
Confederation. Eurobonds come in four different categories: Euro Shatz, Euro
Bobl, Euro Bund, and Euro Buxl. The duration on each respective category is
1.75 years, 4.5 to 5.5 years, 8.5 to 10.5 years, and 24 to 35 years. The contract
size is for 100,000 euros or 100,000 Swiss francs, depending on the issuer.
Eurobonds can be traded in the United States. The basic strategies are similar
to U.S. bonds because they trade on economic fundamentals and inflationary
expectations, and they respond to European economic reports similar to the
way U.S. bonds respond to U.S. reports.

Yielding to the curve
The yield curve is a graphical representation comparing the entire spectrum
of interest rates available to investors. Several informative shapes can be
seen on the yield curve. Three important ones are
 Normal curves: The normal curve rises to the right, and short-term
interest rates are lower than long-term interest rates. Economists usually
look at this kind of movement as a sign of normal economic activity, where
growth is ongoing and investors are being rewarded for taking more risks
by being given extra yield in longer-term maturities.
 Flat curves: A flat curve is when short-term yields are equal or close to
long-term yields. This type of graph can be a sign that the economy is
slowing down or that the Federal Reserve has been raising short-term
rates.
 Inverted curves: An inverted curve shows long-term rates falling below
short-term rates, which can happen when the market is betting on a
slowing of the economy or during a financial crisis when traders are
flocking to the safety of long-term U.S. Treasury bonds.
Figures 4-2 and 4-3 are excellent illustrations of the U.S. Treasury yield curve
and rate structure at a time when inflationary expectations are under control
and the economy is growing steadily. The curve and the table are from July 1,
2005, just two days after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the
ninth consecutive time in a 12-month period. Figure 4-3 depicts a standard,
table-style snapshot of all market maturities for the U.S. Treasury. You can
view an up-to-date version at bonds.yahoo.com/rates.html.

Book III: Futures and Options 

As you review Figures 4-2 and 4-3, notice the following:
 The longer the maturity, the higher the yield: That relationship is normal
for interest-paying securities because you’re lending your money to
someone for an extended period of time, and you want them to pay you
a premium for the extra risk.
 The yields on all securities rose: Starting with the 3-month Treasury bill
(T-bill) and ending with the 30-year bond, all yields rose (compared with
the previous week and month) after the Fed raised interest rates.
By keeping track of the yield curve, you’re achieving several goals that Mark
Powers describes in Starting Out In Futures Trading (Probus Publishing). By
checking out the yield curve, you can
 Focus on the cash markets. Doing so enables you to put activity in the
futures markets in perspective and provides clues to the relationship
between prices in the futures markets.
 Watch for prices rising or falling below the yield curve. This can indicate
good opportunities to buy or sell a security.
 Know that prices above the yield curve point to a relatively underpriced
market.
 Know that prices below the curve point to a relatively overpriced market.
Deciding your time frame
From a trader’s standpoint, you want to consider trading the short term, the
intermediate term, or the long term. Each position has its own time, place,
and reasoning, ranging from how much money you have to trade, your indi-
vidual risk tolerance, and whether your analysis leads you to think that the

particular area of the curve can move during any particular period of time.
The general rule is that the longer the maturity, the greater the potential reac-
tion to good or bad news on inflation. In other words, the further out you go
on the curve, the greater the chance for volatility.
Eurodollars are the best instrument for trading the short term because they
are liquid investments, meaning that they’re easy to buy and sell. Eurodollars
are well suited for small traders because margin requirements tend to be
smaller and the movements can be less volatile; however, don’t consider
those attractive factors a guarantee of success by any means. Any futures
contract can be a quick road to ruin if you become careless.
For long- and intermediate-term trading, you can use the 10-year T-note and
30-year T-bond futures. Ten-year T-note and T-bond futures can be quite
volatile because large traders and institutions usually use them for direct
trading and for complicated hedging strategies.
Sound interest rate trading rules
When trading international interest rate contracts, you must consider the
effects of currency conversion. If you just made a 10-percent profit trading
Eurobonds but the Euro fell 10 percent, your purchasing power hasn’t grown.
When getting ready to trade, make sure that you do the following:
 Calculate your margin requirements. You need to know how much of a
cushion for potential losses you have available before you get a margin
call and are required to put up more money to keep a position open.
Here’s a good rule used by professionals: Never risk more than 50 percent
of your total account equity when trading.
 Never put yourself in a position to receive a margin call. Make sure
you have enough money in your account, never risking more than 10
percent of your equity on any one position (5 percent if your account’s
small), and calculating your maximum risk while keeping it below the
amount that results in a margin call.
 Price in how much of your account’s equity you plan to risk before
you make your trade. As a general rule, you should never risk any more
than 5 percent of your equity on any one trade with a small account. The
bare minimum requirement for trading futures as an individual small
speculator is widely accepted to be no less than $20,000.
 Canvass your charts. You want to know support and resistance levels
on each of the markets that you plan to trade, and then you can set your
entry points above or below those levels, depending, of course, on
which way the market breaks.
198
Book III: Futures and Options 

 Understand what the economic calendar has in store on any given
day. Knowing the potential for economic indicators of the day to move
the market in either direction prepares you for the major volatility that
can occur on the day they’re released.
 Pick your entry and exit points. Include your worst-loss scenario — the
possibility of taking a margin call.
 Use trailing stops when trading all futures contracts. That way, even when
you aren’t sure whether a top was reached, you are stopped out when the
price falls below the three moving averages.
 Decide what your options are if your trade goes well and you have a
significant profit to deal with.
Focusing on Stock Index Futures
Stock index futures are futures contracts based on indexes that are com-
posed of stocks. For example, the S&P 500 futures contract is based on the
popular market benchmark of the same name — the S&P 500 stock index, a
group of 500 commonly traded stocks. When you trade stock index futures,
you’re betting on the direction of the contract’s value, not on the individual
stocks that make up the index.
Stock index futures are an integral part of the stock market’s daily activity. As
a percentage of the total number of futures contracts traded, stock index
futures are by far the largest category of futures contracts traded. That domi-
nance clearly speaks of the major role that stock index futures play in risk
management for the entire stock market.
I can think of several major reasons for trading stock index futures. Here are
some of the more common ones:
 Speculation: When you speculate, you’re making an educated guess
about the direction of a market. You can deliver trading profits to your
accounts by going long or short on index futures, or by betting on prices
rising or falling, respectively.
 Hedging: A hedge is when you use stock index futures and options to
protect an individual security in your portfolio or, in some cases, your
entire portfolio from losing value.
 Tax consequences: Short-term gains in the futures markets may be
taxed at lower rates than stock-market capital gains.
The IRS has a complex set of rules for taxing gains in the futures markets
and specific forms (such as IRS Form 4797 Part II for securities or Form
6781 for commodities) that you must become familiar with. To be safe
and stay on the right side of tax law, check with your accountant before
you start trading.
199
Chapter 4: Advanced Speculation Strategies
Book III
Futures and
Options

 Lower commission rates: Many futures brokerages offer lower commis-
sion rates. This practice is not as widespread as it was before online dis-
count brokers for stocks became a mainstay of the business. But you still
can find low commission rates in the futures markets, a factor that
becomes more important as you trade large blocks or quantities of stocks.
 Time factors: If something happens overnight, when the stock market is
closed, and you want to hedge your risk, you can trade futures on
Globex, a 24-hour electronic trading system, while Wall Street sleeps.
You don’t need to trade every major index contract in the world to be
successful; you just need to find one or two with which you’re comfortable —
the ones that enable you to implement your strategies. In this section, I focus
on the S&P 500 stock index futures. Any of the lessons that I describe with
respect to the S&P 500 can be applied to just about any contract.
Looking into fair value
Fair value is the theoretically correct value for a futures contract at a particular
point in time. You calculate fair value using a formula that includes the current
index level, index dividends, number of days to contract expiration, and interest
rates. Without getting caught up in the details, the important thing for you to
remember is that fair value is a benchmark that can be a helpful tool for your
analysis of the markets. When a stock index futures contract trades below its
fair value, for example, it’s trading at a discount. When it trades above fair
value, it’s trading at a premium.
Knowing the fair value is most helpful in gauging where the market is headed.
Because stock index futures prices are related to spot-index prices, changes
in fair value can trigger price changes. Here’s how it works:
 If the futures contract is too far below fair value, the index (cash) is sold
and the futures contract is bought.
 If the futures contract is too high versus its fair value, the futures
contract is sold and the index (cash) is bought.
 If enough sell programs hit the market hard enough over an extended
period of time, you can see a crash, or a situation where market prices
fall dramatically.
 If enough buy programs kick in, the market tends to rally.
Fair value is the number that the television stock analysts refer to when
discussing the action in futures before the market opens.

Book III: Futures and Options 

Considering major stock 
index futures contracts
You can trade many different stock index contracts, but they all share the same
basic characteristics. I describe many of these general issues in the section
that follows, and I address any particular differences with descriptions of
other individual contracts throughout the rest of this section.
S&P 500 futures (SP)
The biggest stock index futures contract is the S&P 500, which trades on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). This index is made up of the 500 largest
stocks in the United States. It’s a weighted index, which means that component
companies that have bigger market capitalizations, or market values, can have
a much larger impact on the movements of the index than components with
smaller market capitalizations.
Some of the particulars about the S&P 500 Index include the following:
 Composition: The S&P 500 is made up of 400 industrial companies, 40
financial companies, 40 utilities, and 20 transportation companies, offering
a fairly diversified view of the U.S. economy.
 Valuation: The S&P 500 Index is valued in ticks worth 0.1 index points 
or $25.
 Contracts: S&P 500 index futures contracts are worth 250 times the
value of the index. That means that when the index value is at 1,250, a
contract is worth 250 × $1,250, or $312,500. A move of a full point is
worth $250.
 Trading times: Regular trading hours for S&P 500 index futures are from
8:30 a.m. to 3:15 p.m., but S&P 500 index futures contracts are another
example of how 24-hour-a-day trading enables traders to respond to
economic news and releases in the premarket and aftermarket sessions.
The evening session starts 15 minutes after the close (at 3:30 p.m.) and
continues in the overnight until 8:15 a.m. on Globex.
 Contract limits: Individual contract holders are limited to no more than
20,000 net long or short contracts at any one time.
 Price limits: Price limits halt trading above or below the price specified
by the limit. A price limit is how far the S&P 500 index can rise or fall in a
single trading session. The limits are set on a quarterly basis. If the index
experiences major declines or increases beyond these limits, a procedure
is in place to halt trading. You can find the price limits detailed on the
CME’s Web site (www.cme.com).
201
Chapter 4: Advanced Speculation Strategies
Book III
Futures and
Options

 Circuit breakers: Circuit breakers halt trading briefly in a coordinated
manner between exchanges. The limits that trigger circuit breakers are
calculated and agreed upon on a quarterly basis by the different
exchanges.
 Final settlement: For all stock index futures, settlement on the CME is
based on a Special Opening Quotations (SOQ) price, which is calculated
based on the opening prices for each of the stocks in an index on the
day that the contract expires. Don’t confuse the SOQ with the opening
index value, which is calculated right after the opening. Note: Some
stocks may take a while to establish opening prices.
 Margin requirements: Margin values for S&P 500 index contracts are
variable. In November 2007, the initial margin for the S&P 500 contract
was $19,688, and the maintenance margin was $15,750.
 Cash settlement: Stock index futures are settled with cash, a practice
known as cash settlement. That means if you hold your contract until
expiration, you have to either pay or receive the amount of money the
contract is worth as determined by the SOQ price. Cash settlement
applies to all stock index futures.
Overnight and premarket trading can be thin and dangerous, especially
during slow seasons in the stock market, such as in summer, fall, and around
winter holidays.
NASDAQ-100 futures (ND)
The NASDAQ-100 index futures contract is similar to the S&P 500 futures con-
tract. Here’s what you need to know about it:
 Composition: The NASDAQ-100 stock index is made up of the 100 largest
stocks traded on the NASDAQ system, including large technology and
biotech stocks.
 Valuation: The ND is valued in minimum ticks of 0.25 that are worth $25.
 Contract limits: No more than 10,000 net long or short contracts can be
held by any individual at any one time.
 Margin requirements: Margins required for NASDAQ-100 index futures
are similar to the S&P 500 index futures. In November 2007, the initial
margin for the ND contract was $12,500, and the maintenance margin
was $10,000.
202
Book III: Futures and Options 

e-mini S&P 500 (ES) and e-mini NASDAQ-100 (NQ)
The e-mini S&P 500 (ES) contract and the e-mini NASDAQ-100 (NQ) are among
the most popular stock index futures contracts because they enable you to
trade the market’s trend with only a fifth of the requirement. The e-mini S&P
is a favorite of day-traders because of its high intraday volatility and major
price swings on a daily basis. The mini contracts are marketed to small
investors, and they offer some advantages. However, they also carry significant
risks because they’re volatile and still have fairly high margin requirements.
The ES and NQ e-mini contracts are based on the same makeup as the respective
S&P 500 and NASDAQ-100 index contracts, and they can be very volatile and can
move even more aggressively during extremely volatile market environments.
Other particulars about the e-mini contracts:
 Valuation: One tick on ES is 0.25 of an index point and is worth $12.50.
One tick on NQ is 0.50 of an index point and is worth $10.
 Contracts: The value of an ES contract is $50 multiplied by the value of
the S&P 500 index. The value of an NQ contract is $20 multiplied by the
value of the NASDAQ-100 index.
 Trading times: The e-mini contracts trade nearly 24 hours per day, with
a 30-minute maintenance break in trading from 4:30 to 5:00 p.m. daily.
 Monthly identifiers: Monthly identifiers for both mini contracts are H
for March, M for June, U for September, and Z for December.
 Margin requirements: Margins for the ES and NQ contracts are less than
for the normal-sized contracts. As of November 2007, the ES required
$3,938 for initial margin and $3,150 for maintenance, and the NQ
required $2,500 and $2,000, respectively.
The day-trading margin is less than the margin to hold an overnight position in
S&P 500 e-mini futures. Traders, though, are obligated to pay for the difference
between the margins for entry and exit points, which means that if you lose,
you’re likely to pay up in a big way at the end of the day.
When you own normal-sized contracts and e-mini contracts in one or the other
of the underlying indexes, position limits apply to both positions, meaning that
each of the contracts is counted as an individual part of the overall position.
The combined number of contracts can’t exceed the 20,000 contract limit for
the S&P 500-based index and the 10,000 contract limit for the NASDAQ-100-
based index.

S
avvy investors always keep their ﬁngers on the pulse
of the markets and seek to develop investment
strategies that take advantage of the market fundamentals.
One of the biggest trends in the global investment game in
the beginning of the 21st century is the increasing popularity
of commodities in investor portfolios. Driven by high
commodity prices, many investors are looking for ways to
proﬁt in this sector. This book tells you what you need to
know about key commodities markets –– energy, metals,
and agriculture –– so that you can decide whether to put
some of your investment dollars in commodities, and, if
so, where.

 Understanding risks specific to commodities
 Determining whether commodities should be part of your portfolio
F
or whatever reason, investors have often shunned commodities in favor
of what they think are more “prudent” investments, such as stocks. This
is quite baffling because the performance of commodities in recent years 
has been superior to that of stocks. Between 2002 and 2005, for example, the
Dow Jones Industrial Average returned a respectable 7 percent. Meanwhile,
the Dow Jones-AIG Commodity Index, which tracks a basket of commodities,
was up more than 21 percent! In 2002 alone, while the Dow Jones Industrial
Average had negative returns (–7 percent), the Dow Jones-AIG Commodity
Index had returns of 26 percent.
Many investors are afraid of commodities because they don’t know much
about them. The goal of this chapter is to shed some light on commodities so
you can invest with confidence.
Defining Commodities
Just what, exactly, are commodities? Put simply, commodities are the raw
materials humans use to create a livable world. We humans have been
exploiting the Earth’s natural resources since the beginning of time. We use
energy to sustain ourselves, metals to build weapons and tools, and agricul-
tural products to feed ourselves. These resources — energy, metals, and agri-
cultural products — are the three classes of commodities, and they are the
essential building blocks of the global economy.

Energy
Energy, whether fossil fuels or renewable energy sources, can make a great
investment; the world has a seemingly unquenchable thirst for this resource.
In Chapter 4, I cover investment opportunities in each of these major forms
of energy:
 Crude oil: Crude oil is the undisputed heavyweight champion in the
commodities world. In terms of volume, more crude oil is traded every
day (85 million barrels and growing) than any other commodity.
Accounting for 40 percent of total global energy consumption, it pro-
vides some terrific investment opportunities.
 Natural gas: Natural gas, the gaseous fossil fuel, is a major commodity 
in its own right. It’s used for everything from cooking food to heating
houses during the winter.
 Coal: Coal accounts for more than 20 percent of total world energy con-
sumption. In the United States, the largest energy market, 50 percent of
electricity is generated through coal. Because of abundant supply, coal
is making a resurgence.
 Uranium/nuclear power: Because of improved environmental standards
within the industry, nuclear power use is on the rise.
 Electricity: Electricity is a necessity of modern life, and the companies
responsible for generating this special commodity have some unique
characteristics.
 Solar power: Due to a number of reasons ranging from environmental to
geopolitical, demand for renewable energy sources such as solar power
is increasing.
 Wind power: Wind power is getting a lot of attention from investors as a
viable alternative source of energy.
 Ethanol: Ethanol, produced primarily from corn or sugar, is an increas-
ingly popular fuel additive that offers investment potential.
There are other commodities in the energy complex, such as heating oil,
propane, and gasoline. Although I do provide insight into some of these other
members of the energy family in Chapter 4, I focus primarily on the resources
mentioned in this list.
Metals
Metallurgy has been essential to human development since the beginning of
time. Societies that have mastered the production of metals have been able
to survive and thrive. Similarly, investors who have incorporated metals into
their portfolios have been able to generate significant returns. In Chapter 5, I
discuss investment opportunities for all the major metals:
208
Book IV: Commodities 

 Gold: For centuries, people have been attracted to its quasi-indestructibility
and have used it as a store of value. Folks invest in gold to hedge against
inflation and to protect their assets during times of global turmoil.
 Silver: Silver, like gold, has monetary applications. The British currency,
the pound sterling, is still named after this metal. Silver also has applica-
tions in industry (such as electrical wiring).
 Platinum: The rich man’s gold is one of the most valuable metals in the
world, used for everything from jewelry to the manufacture of catalytic
converters.
 Steel: Created by alloying iron and other materials, steel is the most
widely used metal in the world, helping to create everything from cars 
to buildings.
 Aluminum: Perhaps no other metal has the versatility of aluminum; it’s
lightweight yet surprisingly robust. That’s probably why it’s the second
most used metal (right behind steel).
 Copper: Copper, the third most widely used metal, is the metal of choice
for industry because it’s a great conductor of heat and electricity.
 Zinc: The fourth most widely used metal in the world, zinc is sought for
its resistance to corrosion. It’s used in the process of galvanization,
where zinc coating is applied to other metals to prevent rust.
 Palladium: Almost half the palladium that’s mined goes toward build-
ing automobile catalytic converters. As the number of cars with these
emission-reducing devices increases, the demand for palladium increases
as well.
 Nickel: Nickel is in high demand because of its resistance to corrosion
and oxidation. Because steel is usually alloyed with nickel to create
stainless steel, nickel will have an important role to play for years 
to come.
Agricultural products
Food is the most essential element of human life, and the production of food
presents solid money-making opportunities. Following are some major agri-
cultural products, which I discuss further in Chapter 6:
 Coffee: Coffee is the second most widely produced commodity in the
world in terms of physical volume, behind only crude oil.
 Cocoa: Cocoa is a major agricultural commodity primarily because it’s is
used to create chocolate.
 Sugar: Sugar can be a sweet investment. In industry lingo, Sugar #11 rep-
resents a futures contract for global sugar. Sugar #14 is specific to the
United States and is a widely traded commodity.

 Frozen concentrated orange juice: There are two types of frozen con-
centrated orange juice: Type A (FCOJ-A) and Type B (FCOJ-B). FCOJ-A,
the benchmark for North American orange juice prices, is grown in the
hemisphere’s two largest regions: Florida and Brazil. FCOJ-B represents
global orange juice prices and gives you exposure to orange juice activ-
ity on a world scale.
 Corn: Corn’s use for culinary purposes is perhaps unrivaled by any
other grain.
 Wheat: Wheat was one of the first agricultural products grown by man
and is still a staple.
 Soybeans and their derivatives (soybean oil and soybean meal):
Soybeans have many applications, and the soybean market is large.
Soybean oil, also known as vegetable oil, has become very popular in
recent years. Soybean meal is used as feedstock for poultry and cattle.
 Cattle: There are two types of cattle commodities: live cattle and feeder
cattle. Using the live cattle futures contract (which tracks adult cows) to
hedge against price volatility is a good idea for investors involved in
agriculture. The feeder cattle contract is used to hedge against the risk
associated with growing calves. This area is not widely followed in the
markets, but it’s important to figure out how it works.
 Lean hogs: They may not be the sexiest commodity out there, but lean
hogs are an essential.
 Frozen pork bellies: Frozen pork bellies are essentially just good old
bacon. This industry is subject to wild price swings, which provides
unique arbitrage trading opportunities.
Chewing on Characteristics 
of Commodities
As an asset class, commodities have unique characteristics that separate
them from other asset classes and make them attractive, whether as indepen-
dent investments or as part of a broader based investment strategy. I go
through these unique characteristics in the following sections.
Savoring the inelasticity
In economics, elasticity seeks to determine the effects of price on supply and
demand. The calculation can get pretty technical but, essentially, elasticity
quantifies how much supply and demand will change for every incremental
change in price.
210
Book IV: Commodities 

Goods that are elastic tend to have a high correlation between price and
demand, which is usually inversely proportional: When the price of a good
increases, demand tends to decrease. This makes sense because you’re not
going to pay for a good that you don’t need if it becomes too expensive.
Capturing and determining that spread is what elasticity is all about.
Inelastic goods, however, are goods that are so essential to consumers that
changes in price tend to have a limited effect on supply and demand. Most
commodities fall in the inelastic goods category because they are essential to
human existence.
For instance, if the price of ice cream were to increase by 25 percent, chances
are you’d buy less ice cream because it’s not a necessity. However, when the
price of unleaded gasoline increases by 25 percent, you may not be happy,
but you still fill your tank because gas is a necessity. Of course, the demand
for gasoline isn’t absolutely inelastic; a point will come when you decide that
it’s simply not worth paying the amount you’re paying at the pump, and
you’ll begin looking for alternatives. But the truth remains that you’re willing
to pay more for gasoline than for other products you don’t need (such as ice
cream); that’s the key to understanding price inelasticity.
Most commodities are fairly inelastic because they are the raw materials that
allow us to live the lives we strive for; they allow us to maintain a decent
(and, in some cases, extravagant!) standard of living. Without these precious
raw materials, you wouldn’t be able to heat your home in the winter; actually,
without cement, copper, and other basic materials, you wouldn’t even have a
house to begin with! And then, of course, there’s the most essential commod-
ity of all: food. Without food we would not exist.
Offering a safe haven for investors
During times of turmoil, commodities tend to act as safe havens for investors.
Certain commodities, such as gold and silver, are viewed by investors as reli-
able stores of value, so investors flock to these assets when times aren’t good.
When currencies slide, when nations go to war, when global pandemics break
out, you can rely on gold, silver, and other commodities to provide you with
financial safety.
Have part of your portfolio in gold and other precious metals so that you can
protect your assets during times of turmoil. Turn to Chapter 5 for more on
investing in precious metals.
Hedging against inflation
One of the biggest things you need to watch out for as an investor is the rav-
aging effects of inflation. Inflation can devastate your investments, particularly
211
Chapter 1: A Commodities Overview
Book IV
Commodities

paper assets such as stocks. The central bankers of the world — smart
people all — spend their entire careers trying to tame inflation, but despite
their efforts, inflation can easily get out of hand. You need to protect yourself
against this economic enemy.
Ironically, one of the only asset classes that actually benefits from inflation is —
you guessed it — commodities. Perhaps the biggest irony of all is that increases
in the prices of basic goods (commodities such as oil and gas) actually con-
tribute to the increase of inflation. For example, there’s a positive correlation
between gold and the inflation rate (see Figure 1-1). During times of high infla-
tion, investors load up on gold because it is considered a good store of value.
Bringing new sources online takes time
The business of commodities is a time- and capital-intensive business. Unlike
high tech or other “new economy” start-ups (such as e-commerce), bringing
commodity projects online takes a lot of time. It can take up to a decade, for
example, to bring new sources of oil online. First, a company must identify
potentially promising areas to explore for oil. Then the company has to start
drilling and prospecting for the oil (a process that, if it’s lucky, will take only
three to five years). After discovering significantly recoverable sources of oil,
the company must then develop infrastructure and bring in machinery to
extract the oil, which must then be transported to a refining facility to be
transformed into consumable energy products such as gasoline or jet fuel.
After the oil goes through the lengthy refining stage, it must finally be trans-
ported to consumers!
What does this mean to you as an investor? When you’re investing in com-
modities, you have to think long term. If you’re used to investing in tech
stocks or if you’re an entrepreneur involved in e-commerce, you need to radi-
cally change the way you think about investing when you approach com-
modities. If you’re able to recognize the long-term nature of commodities,
you’re on your way to becoming a successful commodities investor.
Moving in different cycles
“Sell in May and go away” is an old Wall Street adage referring to stocks;
because the stock market doesn’t perform well during the summer months,
the thinking goes, you should sell your stocks and get back into the game in
the fall. This adage doesn’t apply to commodities because commodities move
in different cycles than stocks. Some commodities perform really well during
the summer months. Gasoline products see an increase in demand during the
summer months (due to increased driving); all things equal, unleaded gaso-
line tends to increase in price during the summer.
212
Book IV: Commodities 

Choosing the Right Investment Vehicle
One of the most critical questions you should ask yourself before getting
started in commodities is the following: How do I invest in commodities? The
following sections give you some answers. (The other critical question is what
to invest in. You find a plethora of possibilities in Chapters 4 through 6.)
The futures markets
In the futures markets, individuals, institutions, and sometimes governments
transact with each other for price hedging and speculating purposes. An air-
line company, for instance, may want to use futures to enter into an agree-
ment with a fuel company to buy a fixed amount of jet fuel for a fixed price
for a fixed period of time. This transaction in the futures markets allows the
airline to hedge against the volatility associated with the price of jet fuel.
Although commercial users are the main players in the futures arena, the
futures markets are also used by traders and investors who profit from price
volatility through various trading techniques.

Chapter 1: A Commodities Overview
Book IV
Commodities

The futures markets are administered by the various commodity exchanges,
such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the New York Mercantile
Exchange (NYMEX). I discuss the major exchanges, the role they play in the
markets, and the products they offer in Chapter 2.
Investing through the futures markets requires a good understanding of
futures contracts, options on futures, forwards, spreads, and so on. The most
direct way of investing in the futures markets is by opening an account with a
futures commission merchant (FCM). The FCM is very much like your tradi-
tional stock brokerage house (such as Schwab, Fidelity, or Merrill Lynch),
except that it’s allowed to offer products that trade on the futures markets.
Here are some other ways to get involved in futures:
 Commodity trading advisor (CTA): The CTA is an individual or company
licensed to trade futures contracts on your behalf.
 Commodity pool operator (CPO): The CPO is similar to a CTA except
that the CPO can manage the funds of multiple clients under one
account. This provides additional leverage when trading futures.
 Commodity indexes: A commodity index is a benchmark, similar to the
Dow Jones Industrial Average or the S&P 500, which tracks a basket of
the most liquid commodities. You can track the performance of a com-
modity index, which allows you in effect to “buy the market.” A number
of commodity indexes are available, such as the Goldman Sachs
Commodity Index and the Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index.
The futures markets are regulated by a number of organizations, such as the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission (CFTC). These organizations monitor the markets to prevent
market fraud and manipulation and to protect investors from such activity. For
more information about the nuts and bolts of futures trading, go to Book III.
Trading futures is not for everyone. By their very nature, futures markets,
contracts, and products are extremely complex and require a great deal of
mastery even by the most seasoned investors. If you don’t feel you have a
good handle on all the concepts involved in trading futures, don’t jump into
futures or you could lose a lot more than your principal (because of the use
of leverage and other characteristics unique to the futures markets). If you’re
not comfortable trading futures, don’t sweat it. You can invest in commodi-
ties in multiple other ways.
If you are ready to start investing in the futures markets, you need to have a
solid grasp of technical analysis, which is discussed in Book VIII.
214
Book IV: Commodities 

The equity markets
Although the futures markets offer the most direct investment gateway to the
commodities markets, the equity markets also offer access to these raw mate-
rials. You can invest in companies that specialize in the production, transfor-
mation, and distribution of these natural resources. If you’re a stock investor
familiar with the equity markets, this may be a good route for you to access
the commodities markets. The only drawback of the equity markets is that
you have to take into account external factors, such as management compe-
tence, tax situations, debt levels, and profit margins, which have nothing to
do with the underlying commodity. That said, investing in companies that
process commodities still allows you to profit from the commodities boom.
Publicly traded companies
The size, structure, and scope of the companies involved in the business are
varied. Here’s a sampling:
 Integrated energy companies: These companies, such as Exxon Mobil
Corp. (NYSE: XOM) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX), are involved in all aspects
of the energy industry, from the extraction of crude oil to the distribu-
tion of liquefied natural gas (LNG). They give you broad exposure to the
energy complex (see Chapter 4).
 Diversified mining companies: A number of companies focus exclu-
sively on mining metals and minerals. Some of these companies, such as
Anglo American PLC (NASDAQ: AAUK) and BHP Billiton (NYSE: BHP),
have operations across the spectrum of the metals complex, mining
metals that range from gold to zinc. Head to Chapter 5 for more details.
 Electric utilities: Utilities are an integral part of modern life because
they provide one of life’s most essential necessities: electricity. They’re
also a good investment because they have historically offered large divi-
dends to shareholders. Read Chapter 4 to figure out whether these com-
panies are right for you.
This list is only a small sampling of the commodity companies I cover in these
pages. I also analyze highly specialized companies, such as coal mining com-
panies and oil refiners (Chapter 4), platinum mining companies (Chapter 5),
and purveyors of gourmet coffee products (Chapter 6).
Master limited partnerships
Master limited partnerships (MLPs) invest in energy infrastructure, such as oil
pipelines and natural gas storage facilities. I’m a big fan of MLPs because
215
Chapter 1: A Commodities Overview
Book IV
Commodities

they’re publicly traded partnerships. This means they offer the benefits of trad-
ing like a corporation on a public exchange while offering the tax advantages
of a private partnership. MLPs are required to transfer all cash flow back to
shareholders, which makes them an attractive investment. You can find more
information about MLPs in Chapter 3.
Managed funds
Sometimes it’s easier to have someone else manage your investments for
you. Luckily, you can count on professional money managers that specialize
in commodity trading to handle your investments. Here are two options:
 Mutual funds: If you’ve previously invested in mutual funds and are
comfortable with them, look into adding a mutual fund that gives you
exposure to the commodities markets. A number of funds are available
that invest solely in commodities. You can find more information on
commodity mutual funds in Chapter 3.
 Exchange-traded funds (ETFs): ETFs are an increasingly popular invest-
ment because they are managed funds that offer the convenience of
trading like stocks. A plethora of ETFs that track everything from crude
oil and gold to diversified commodity indexes have appeared in recent
years. Find out how to benefit from these vehicles in Chapter 3.
An outright commodity purchase
The most direct way of investing in certain commodities is by buying them
outright. Precious metals such as gold, silver, and platinum are a great exam-
ple of this. When the price of gold and silver skyrockets, you may see ads on
TV or in newspapers from companies offering to buy your gold or silver jew-
elry. As gold and silver prices increase in the futures markets, they also cause
prices in the spot markets to rise (and vice versa). You can cash in on this
trend by buying coins, bullion, or even jewelry. I present this unique invest-
ment strategy in Chapter 5.
Obviously, this investment strategy is suitable only for a limited number of
commodities, mostly precious metals. Unless you own a farm, keeping live
cattle or feeder cattle to profit from price increases doesn’t make much
sense. And I won’t even mention commodities like crude oil or uranium!
216
Book IV: Commodities 

Putting Risk in Perspective
Commodities have a reputation for being a risky asset, and many investors
are scared of investing in this asset class. Of course, investing in commodi-
ties does present risks — all investments do. This section explains what the
risks are and how you can minimize and manage them.
The pitfalls of using leverage
In finance, leverage refers to the act of magnifying returns through the use 
of borrowed capital. Leverage is a powerful tool that gives you the opportu-
nity to control large market positions with relatively little upfront capital.
However, leverage is the ultimate double-edged sword because both your
profits and losses are magnified to outrageous proportions.
If you invest in stocks, you know that you are able to trade on margin. You
have to qualify for a margin account but, after you do, you are able to use
leverage (margin) to get into stock positions. You can also trade commodities
on margin. However, the biggest difference between using margin with stocks
and with commodities is that the margin requirement for commodities is
much lower than margins for stocks, which means the potential for losses
(and profits) is much greater in commodities.
If you qualify for trading stocks on margin, you have to have at least 50 per-
cent of the capital in your account before you can enter into a stock position
on margin. The minimum margin requirements for commodity futures vary
but are, on average, lower than that for stocks. For example, the margin
requirement for soybeans in the Chicago Board of Trade is 4 percent. This
means that with only $400 in your account, you can buy $10,000 worth of soy-
beans futures contracts! If the trade goes your way, you’re a happy camper.
But if you’re on the losing side of a trade on margin, you can lose much more
than your principal.
When you’re trading on margin, you may get a margin call from your broker
requiring you to deposit additional capital in your account to cover the bor-
rowed amount. The balance on futures accounts is calculated at the end of
the trading session. This means that if you get a margin call, you need to take
care of it immediately. So if you’re trading commodities on margin, you may
have to come up with a nice chunk of change — even more than if you’re
trading stocks on margin.
217
Chapter 1: A Commodities Overview
Book IV
Commodities

Because of the use of margin and the extraordinary amounts of leverage 
you have at your disposal in the futures markets, you should be extremely
careful when trading commodity futures contracts. In order to be a responsi-
ble investor, I recommend using margin only if you have the necessary capital
reserves to cover any subsequent margin calls you may receive if the market
moves adversely.
The real risks behind commodities
Investing is all about managing the risk involved in generating returns. In this
section, I lay out some common risks you face when investing in commodities
and some small steps you can take to minimize these risks.
Geopolitical risk
One of the inherent risks of commodities is that the world’s natural resources
are located in various continents and the jurisdiction over these commodities
lies with sovereign governments, international companies, and many other
entities. International disagreements over the control of natural resources are
quite commonplace. Sometimes a host country will simply kick out foreign
companies involved in the production and distribution of the country’s nat-
ural resources. In 2006, Bolivia, which contains South America’s second largest
deposits of natural gas, nationalized its natural gas industry and kicked out
the foreign companies involved. In a day, a number of companies such as
Brazil’s Petrobras and Spain’s Repsol were left without a mandate in a coun-
try where they had spent billions of dollars in developing the natural gas
industry. Investors in Petrobras and Repsol paid the price.
One way to minimize the risk associated with geopolitical uncertainty is to
invest in companies with experience and economies of scale. If, for example,
you’re interested in investing in an international oil company, go with one
with an established international track record. A company like Exxon Mobil
Corp., for instance, has the scale, breadth, and experience in international
markets to manage the geopolitical risk it faces. A smaller company without
this sort of experience is going to be more at risk than a bigger one. In com-
modities, size does matter.
Speculative risk
The commodities markets, just like the bond and stock markets, are popu-
lated by traders whose primary interest is in making short-term profits by
speculating whether the price of a security will go up or down. Because spec-
ulators are simply interested in making profits, they tend to move the mar-
kets in different ways. Although speculators provide much-needed liquidity
218
Book IV: Commodities 

to the markets (particularly in commodity futures markets), they also tend to
increase market volatility, especially when they begin exhibiting what Alan
Greenspan termed “irrational exuberance.” Because speculators can get out
of control, as they did during the dot-com bubble, always be aware of the
amount of speculative activity going on in the markets. The amount of specu-
lative money involved in commodity markets is in constant fluctuation, but
as a general rule, most commodity futures markets contain about 75 percent
commercial users and 25 percent speculators.
Although I’m bullish on commodities because of the fundamental supply and
demand story, too much speculative money coming into the commodities
markets can have detrimental effects when speculators drive the prices of
commodities in excess of the fundamentals. If you see too much speculative
activity, it’s probably a good idea to simply get out of the markets.
If you trade commodities, find out as much as possible about who the market
participants are so that you can distinguish between the commercial users
and the speculators. Check out the Commitment of Traders report, put out
by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and available online
at www.cftc.gov/cftc/cftccotreports.htm.
The risk of fraud
As if there weren’t enough things to worry about, you should always watch
out for plain and simple fraud. Although the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission (CFTC) and other regulatory bodies do a decent job of protect-
ing investors from market fraud, there is always the possibility that you will
become a victim of fraud. Your broker may hide debts or losses in offshore
accounts, for example.
One way to prevent being taken advantage of is to be extremely vigilant
about who you do business with. Make sure that you thoroughly research a
firm before handing over your money. I go through the due diligence process
you should follow when selecting managers in Chapter 2. Unfortunately, there
are times when no amount of research or due diligence is able to protect you
from fraud — it’s just a fact of the investment game.

Understanding How Commodity
Exchanges Work
In This Chapter
 Realizing the importance of commodity exchanges
 Investigating exchanges around the world
 Placing orders at the exchange
T
he first image that usually comes to mind when you think of a commodity
exchange is a group of brokers standing in a large circle, wearing bright-
colored jackets, and shouting at each other while making funny gestures.
Behind all this apparent chaos is a very rational, efficient, and orderly process
that is responsible for setting global benchmark prices for the world’s most
important commodities. The prices established in the exchanges have a
direct impact on our lives, from the price we pay to fill our gas tanks to how
much we pay to heat our homes.
This chapter gives you a tour of a typical commodity exchange, explains the
role that exchanges play in global capital markets, and introduces some of
the players who are part of this fascinating world. It also examines some of
the products traded on the exchanges and shows you how you can get
involved in the buying and selling of exchange-traded commodities.
The Role of Commodity Exchanges
Commodity exchanges provide investors and traders with the opportunity to
invest in commodities by trading futures contracts, options on futures, and
other derivative products. By their very nature, these products are extremely
sophisticated financial instruments used by only the savviest investors and

the most experienced traders. They also serve a very important role in estab-
lishing global benchmark prices for crucial commodities such as crude oil,
gold, copper, orange juice, and coffee.
Although independent traders, like you and me, can and do trade the futures
markets, the majority of players in the futures markets are large commercial
entities who use the futures markets for price hedging purposes. Hershey
Foods Corporation, for example, is an active participant in cocoa futures
because it wants to hedge against the price risk of cocoa, a primary input for
making its chocolates. If you decide to trade cocoa futures contracts, you
should remember that you’re up against some large and experienced market
players.
At the end of the day, the commodity futures exchanges are your gateway to
the futures markets; in fact, they are the commodity futures markets. However,
because of the fierce competition in these markets and because of the com-
plexity of exchange-traded products, you should trade directly in the com-
modity futures markets only if you have an iron clad grasp of the technical
aspects of the markets and have a rock solid understanding of the market
fundamentals. If you don’t have either, I recommend staying out of these mar-
kets because you could subject yourself to disastrous losses. That said, you
can hire a trained professional with experience trading commodity futures to
do the trading for you.
A number of commodity exchanges operate worldwide, specializing in all
sorts of commodities. In the following sections, I identify the major commod-
ity exchanges and list the commodities traded in them.
The Major Commodity Exchanges
Many commodity exchanges operate worldwide, and each exchange special-
izes in certain commodities. In the following sections, I introduce you to
some of the key players in the United States and abroad.
Key U.S. players
The main commodity exchanges in the United States are located in New York
and Chicago, with a few other exchanges in other parts of the country. Table 2-1
lists the major commodity exchanges in the United States along with some of
the commodities traded in each one.

exchanges.
Keep in mind that this table offers only a small sampling of the commodities
that these exchanges offer. The CME, for example, offers more than 100
futures products. I recommend visiting the exchange Web sites for a compre-
hensive listing of their product offerings.
When a commodity is traded on more than one exchange, you want to trade
the most liquid market. You can find out where the most liquid market for a
commodity is by consulting the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
(CFTC), which keeps information on all the exchanges and their products.
The technical name for a commodity exchange is designated contract market
(DCM). DCM is a designation handed out by the CFTC to exchanges that offer
commodity products to the public. If an exchange does not have the designa-
tion DCM, stay away from it!

Regulatory organizations for 
commodity exchanges
Commodity exchanges are under strict over-
sight in order to protect all market participants
and to ensure transparency in the exchanges.
Here are the main regulatory organizations that
have oversight of commodity exchanges in the
United States:
 Commodity Futures Trading Commission
(CFTC): The CFTC is a federal regulatory
agency created by Congress in 1974. Its
main purpose is to regulate the commodity
markets and to protect all market partici-
pants from fraud, manipulation, and abusive
practices. Any exchange that conducts busi-
ness with the public must be registered with
the CFTC. You can visit its Web site at
www.cftc.gov.
 National Futures Association (NFA): The
NFA is the industry’s self-regulatory body. It
conducts audits, launches investigations 
to root out corrupt practices in the industry,
and enforces the rules relating to the 
trading of commodities on the various
exchanges. It also regulates every single
firm or individual who conducts business
with you as an investor — including floor
traders and brokers, futures commission
merchants, commodity trading advisors,
commodity pool operators, and introducing
brokers. You can check out the work of the
NFA, as well as research individual com-
modities professionals, at the NFA Web
site: www.nfa.futures.org.

If you’re in the United States, you may want to consider investing in overseas
exchanges for liquidity purposes. For example, aluminum futures contracts
are offered on both the American NYMEX and the British London Metal
Exchange (LME). However, the aluminum contract in the LME is more liquid,
so you could get a better price by buying aluminum contracts in London as
opposed to New York.
Ready, Set, Invest: Opening an 
Account and Placing Orders
When you decide you’re ready to start trading exchange-traded products,
you have to choose the most suitable way for you to do so. Unless you’re a
member of an exchange or have a seat on the exchange floor, you have to
open a trading account with a commodity broker who’s licensed to conduct
business on behalf of clients at the exchange.
The technical term for a commodity broker is a futures commission merchant
(FCM). The FCM is licensed to solicit and execute commodity orders and
accept payments for this service. Before choosing a commodity broker who
will handle your account, perform a thorough and comprehensive analysis of
its trading platform. You want to get as much information as possible about
the firm and its activities. A few things you should consider are firm history,
firm clients, licensing information, trading platform, regulatory data, and
employee information.
Choosing the right account
After you select a commodity brokerage firm you’re comfortable with, it’s time
to open an account and start trading! You can choose from a number of differ-
ent brokerage accounts. Most firms will offer you at least two types of accounts,
depending on the level of control you want to exercise over the account:
 Self-directed accounts: If you feel confident about your trading abilities,
have a good understanding of market fundamentals, and want to get direct
access to commodity exchange products, then a self-directed account is
for you. In this type of account, also known as a non-discretionary individual
account, you call the shots and make all the trading decisions.
Before you open a self-directed account, talk to a few commodity brokers
because each firm offers different account features. Specifically, ask about any
minimum capital requirements the firm has (some commodity brokers require
that you invest a minimum amount of $10,000 or more), account maintenance
fees, and the commission scale the firm uses.

 Managed accounts: In a managed account, you’re essentially transfer-
ring the responsibility of making all buying and selling decisions over to
a trained professional. This type of account is ideal if you don’t follow
the markets on a regular (i.e. daily) basis, are unsure about which trad-
ing strategy will maximize your returns, or simply don’t have the time to
manage a personal account.
Before you open a managed account, first determine your investment
goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance, and find a commodity trading
advisor (CTA) who will manage your account based on your personal
risk profile. Before contracting with anyone, however, find out about any
minimum capital requirements, commissions, or management fees you
may face.
Selecting a commodity trading advisor
If you are trading commodities through a managed account, you need to
select a commodity trading advisor (CTA). A CTA is a securities professional
who is licensed by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and
the National Futures Association (NFA) to offer advice on commodities and to
accept compensation for investment and management services. Here are a
few things to find out about your CTA:
 How many years of market experience does he have?
 What is his long-term performance record?
 What is his trading strategy and does it square with your investment goals?
 Does he have any complaints filed against him? (This information is pub-
licly available through the NFA.)
 How many accounts is he currently managing? If the number seems
high, your account may not be a high priority for him.
A CTA is allowed by law to manage more than one account and have
more than one client. However, a CTA must keep all managed accounts
separate. That means there is no commingling of funds allowed and no
transferring of profits or losses between accounts. A managed account is
very different from a commodity pool, where your funds are pooled with
those of other investors. In a commodity pool, the manager, who is
known as a commodity pool operator (CPO), pools all the funds, and all
profits or losses are shared by all investors.
 Does he have a criminal record? If so, find out the details of any arrests
or convictions. This information is also available through the NFA.
Before you select a CTA, perform a rigorous background check. Because
a CTA is required to register with the NFA to transact with the public,
you can find out a lot about a CTA by simply visiting the NFA Web site
(www.nfa.futures.org).
226
Book IV: Commodities 

After you perform due diligence on your CTA and feel comfortable with him,
you’re ready to turn over trading privileges to him. How do you do that? You
sign a power of attorney document, which gives your CTA full trading discre-
tion and complete control over the buying and selling of commodities in your
account. That means he makes all the decisions, and you have to live with
them. The main benefit of the managed account is that you get a trained pro-
fessional managing your investments. The drawback is you can’t blame
anyone but yourself if you incur any losses.
Placing orders
Your trading account is your link to a commodity exchange. The broker’s
trading platform gives you access to the exchange’s main products such as
futures contracts, options on futures, and other derivative products. Because
the products traded on commodity exchanges are fairly sophisticated finan-
cial instruments, you need to specify a number of parameters in order to pur-
chase the product you want.
Establishing contract parameters
The lifeblood of the exchange is the contract. As an investor, you can choose
from a number of different contracts — from plain vanilla futures contracts to
exotic swaps and spreads. Whichever contract(s) you choose, there are spe-
cific entry order procedures you need to follow. Here is a list of the parame-
ters you need to indicate to place an order at the exchange:
 Action: Indicate whether you are buying or selling.
 Quantity: Specify the number of contracts you’re interested in either
buying or selling.
 Time: By definition, commodity futures contracts represent an underly-
ing commodity traded at a specific price for delivery at a specific point
in the future. Futures contracts have delivery months, and you must
specify the delivery month. Additionally, you should also specify the
year because many contracts represent delivery points for periods of up
to five years (or more).
 Commodity: This is the underlying commodity that the contract repre-
sents. It could be crude oil, gold, or soybeans. Sometimes, it’s also help-
ful to indicate on which exchange you want to place your order. (This is
fairly significant as more and more of the same commodities are being
offered on different exchanges.)
 Price: This could be the most important piece of the contract: the price
at which you’re willing to buy or sell the contract. Unless you’re placing
a market order (which is executed at current market prices), indicate the
price at which you want your order to be filled.
227
Chapter 2: Understanding How Commodity Exchanges Work
Book IV
Commodities

 Type of order: This is where you indicate how you want to buy or sell
the contract. Several types of orders are available, from plain vanilla
market orders to more exotic ones such as Fill or Kill (FOK). The next
section lists the different types of orders.
 Day or open order: This item relates to how long you want your order
to remain open. In a day order, your order expires if it isn’t filled by the
end of the trading day. An open order, however, remains open unless you
cancel the order, the order is filled, or the contract expires.
Defining different types of orders
One of the most important pieces of information you need to indicate is the
order type. This indicates how you want your order to be placed and executed:
 Fill or Kill (FOK): Your order is to be filled right away at a specific price.
If a matching offer is not found within three attempts, your order will be
cancelled, or “killed.”
 Limit (LMT): Your order is to be filled only at a specified price or better.
If you’re on the buy side of a transaction, you want your limit buy order
placed at or below the market price. If you’re on the sell side, you want
your limit sell order at or above market price.
 Market (MKT): Your order will be filled at the current market price.
 Market if Touched (MIT): You specify the price at which you want to
buy or sell a commodity. When that price is reached (or “touched”),
your order is automatically filled at the current market price. A buy MIT
order is placed below the market; a sell MIT order is placed above the
market.
 Market on Close (MOC): You select a specific time to execute your
order, and your order will be executed at whatever price that particular
commodity is commanding at the end of the trading session.
 Stop (STP): Your order is placed when trading occurs at or through a
specified price. A buy stop order is placed above the market, and a sell
stop order is placed below market levels.
 Stop Close Only (SCO): Your stop order will be executed only at the
closing of trading and only if the closing trading range is at or through
your designated stop price.
 Stop Limit (STL): After the stop price is reached, the order will become a
limit order and the transaction will be executed only if the specified
price at which you want the order to go through has been reached. 
Here are a couple sample orders:
 Buy ten June 2008 COMEX Gold at $550 Limit Day Order. This means
you’re buying ten contracts for gold on the COMEX (the metals complex
228
Book IV: Commodities 

of the NYMEX) with the delivery date of June 2008. You are willing to pay
$550 per troy ounce per contract, or better. (A troy ounce is the measure-
ment unit for gold at the COMEX.) Because this is a day order, if your
order isn’t filled by the end of the trading day, it will expire.
 Sell 100 September 2009 NYMEX Crude at Market Open Order. Through
this order, you’re selling 100 contracts of crude oil on the NYMEX with
the delivery date of September 2009. You are willing to sell them at the
current market price. Because this is an open order, your order will
remain open for multiple trading sessions until it is filled.
Tracking your order from start to finish
When you pick up the phone or log into your online account and place an
order, it’s sometimes easy to forget that your order isn’t placed in a vacuum.
You place the order and wait for the confirmation number. Seems simple,
right? Not quite. In this section, I shed some light on how your orders are exe-
cuted and introduce you to some of the people who make this possible.
The information that follows details what happens in the open outcry system —
the system where brokers physically stand in a trading pit filling and execut-
ing orders manually. However, this system faces ever-increasing competition
from electronic trading platforms, where orders are matched electronically.
Of the major exchanges in the United States, only the NYMEX, COMEX, and
NYBOT still rely heavily on the open outcry system to conduct business. Most
exchanges now use a combination of electronic and open outcry, and many
people believe that the open outcry system will soon be retired altogether.
Following are some of the players involved in the open outcry system:
 The clerk: At the exchange, the first point of contact with the outside
world is the clerk. Employed by the various commodity brokers licensed
to conduct business at the exchange, the clerk works the phones and is
responsible for taking down client orders. When the clerk receives an
order by phone or e-mail, he fills out an order ticket, which he passes on
to the floor broker.
 The floor broker (FB): The FB — the person in the large ring shouting and
making funny gestures — is licensed to buy and sell commodities on behalf
of clients. It’s his job to execute the order. When the FB receives the order
ticket from the clerk, it’s his responsibility to find a matching offer and to
fill the order. After he finds a broker or trader willing to fill his order, he
writes down on the order ticket the time the agreement was entered into.
 The floor trader (FT): The FT may only trade on behalf of his personal
account. Sometimes known as a “local,” she provides much-needed liq-
uidity to the exchange. An FT may be the person who will sell or buy a
contract from the FB.
229
Chapter 2: Understanding How Commodity Exchanges Work
Book IV
Commodities

When both buyer and seller at the exchange agree on price and other
contractual terms, both must write down that the transaction went through
on their tickets. However, only the seller is responsible for notifying the
exchange that the transaction went through. He does so by filling out an
order ticket (with the price, quality, and quantity of the contract, along
with the time the transaction took place) and physically throwing the
ticket order to the card clocker.
 The card clocker: This person, who is employed by the exchange, 
sits in the middle of the ring, literally at the center of the action. The

Owning a piece of an exchange
Commodity exchanges are becoming popular
vehicles through which investors access the
commodity markets. Because of their unique
position, commodity exchanges stand to gain
tremendously from this interest from the invest-
ing public. Interested in cashing in on this trend
without trading a single contract on a single
commodity exchange?
Sometimes, with all the commotion associated
with the trading floors on commodity exchanges,
it’s easy to forget that an exchange is a busi-
ness like any other business. Exchanges have
employees, board members, revenues, earn-
ings, expenses, and so on. While a car manu-
facturer sells cars to customers, commodity
exchanges sell commodity contracts to 
customers. Of course, they charge fees for this
service.
For most of their existence, exchanges have
been privately held companies whose business
side remained under close wraps. However,
because of the increasing popularity of com-
modities and the rise of the electronic trading
platform, many commodity exchanges are now
becoming public companies with shareholders
and outside investors.
In 2003, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (the
nation’s largest commodity exchange in terms
of volume) went public. Its shares are traded on
the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker
symbol CME. CME went public at a price of $43
a share. By March 2006, the stock price of CME
reached an astonishing $435 a share! That’s
more than a 1,000 percent increase in a period
of three years. Encouraged by these results, a
number of other commodity exchanges went
public soon after, and more are following suit.
Other exchanges that have gone public include
Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) and Interconti-
nental Exchange (ICE).
You can cash in on this trend by becoming a
shareholder in one of these exchanges. But
before you purchase equity (stock) in one of the
commodity exchanges, make sure you perform
a thorough analysis of the stock and the com-
pany fundamentals. A stock will never go up in
a straight arrow — it always retreats before
reaching new highs. Sometimes, it doesn’t
reach new highs at all. I recommend you follow
a stock on paper — that is, follow its move-
ments without actually owning the stock — for
a period of at least two weeks. That way you
can get a feel for how the stock moves with the
rest of the market. This will allow you to pin-
point the right entry and exit points.

responsibility of the clocker is to time stamp every ticket order and
record the time of each transaction that takes place on the exchange
floor. Because brokers and traders are throwing order tickets at him, he
must wear eye goggles to protect himself.
 The floor runner: The floor runner, also employed by the exchange, is
responsible for gathering all time-stamped ticket orders from the card
clocker and handing them to the data-entry folks at the exchange. She is
called a floor runner because she has to literally run between the card
clocker and data-entry to deliver the ticket orders. Data-entry is respon-
sible for recording the exact time and nature of the contract for the
exchange’s internal compliance records.
 The price reporter: The price reporter is a major link between the
exchange and the outside world. She’s responsible for noting the price
and time of every transaction that takes place inside a trading ring. The
price reporter notes this information in a hand-held computer that is
directly linked to the exchange’s floor board. The price the reporter
notes flashes directly and instantaneously on the board, where it is then
disseminated to the public via news and wire services.
 The ring supervisor: Every ring (or pit) where specific commodity con-
tracts are bought and sold during the open outcry sessions has a super-
visor who is responsible for overseeing trading activity and maintaining
orderly conduct.

Welcoming Commodities 
into Your Portfolio
In This Chapter
 Determining how prominent a role commodities should play in your portfolio
 Gaining exposure to commodities in a variety of ways
 Researching before you invest
T
he goal of this chapter is to help you figure out how much of your portfo-
lio you should devote to commodities and introduce you to the vehicles
that let you invest in them — from index funds to master limited partner-
ships. If you’ve ever wondered how to get commodities into your portfolio,
you can’t afford not to read this chapter!
Making Room in Your Portfolio 
for Commodities
One of the most common questions I get from investors is, “How much of my
portfolio should I have in commodities?” My answer is usually very simple: It
depends. You have to take into account a number of factors to determine
how much capital to dedicate to commodities.
Many investors who like the way commodities anchor their portfolios have
about 15 percent exposure to commodities. But if you’re new to commodities,
start out with a relatively modest amount, anywhere between 3 and 5 percent,
to see how comfortable you feel with this new member of your financial family.
Test out how commodities contribute to your overall portfolio’s performance.
If you’re satisfied with what you see, gradually increase the percentage.

Choosing Your Method(s) for 
Investing in Commodities
You have several methods at your disposal, both direct and indirect, for get-
ting exposure to commodities. In this section, I go through the different ways
you can invest in commodities.
Having a diversified portfolio is important because it helps reduce the overall
volatility of your market exposures. Holding unrelated assets in your portfolio
increases your chances of maintaining good returns when a certain asset
underperforms. (See the sidebar “Modern Portfolio Theory and the benefits
of diversification.”)
Buying commodity futures
The futures markets are the most direct way to get exposure to commodities.
Futures contracts allow you to purchase an underlying commodity for an
234
Book IV: Commodities 
Modern Portfolio Theory and the 
benefits of diversification
The idea that diversification is a good strategy
in portfolio allocation is the cornerstone of the
Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT). MPT is the
brainchild of Nobel Prize–winning economist
Harry Markowitz. In a paper he wrote in 1952
for his doctoral thesis, Markowitz argued that
investors should look at a portfolio’s overall risk/
reward ratio. While this sounds like common
sense today, it was a groundbreaking idea at
the time.
Up until Markowitz’s paper, most investors con-
structed their portfolios based on a risk/reward
ratio analysis of individual securities. Investors
chose a security based on its individual risk
profile and ignored how that risk profile would
fit within a broader portfolio. Markowitz argued
(successfully) that investors could construct
more profitable portfolios if they looked at the
overall risk/reward ratio of their portfolios.
Therefore, when you are considering an indi-
vidual security, you should not only assess its
individual risk profile, but also take into account
how that risk profile fits within your general
investment strategy. Markowitz’s idea that hold-
ing a group of different securities reduces a
portfolio’s overall volatility is one of the most
important ideas in portfolio allocation.

agreed-upon price in the future. You can find in-depth information about
futures contracts in Book III. In this section, I list some ways you can play 
the futures markets.
Commodity indexes
Commodity indexes track baskets of commodity futures contracts. Each index
uses a different methodology, and the performance of the each is different
from its peers. Commodity indexes are known as passive, long-only invest-
ments because they aren’t actively managed, and they can only buy the
underlying commodity; they can’t short it. Here are the five major commodity
indexes you can choose from:
 Goldman Sachs Commodity Index (GSCI)
 Reuters/Jefferies Commodity Research Bureau Index (R/J-CRBI)
 Dow Jones-AIG Commodity Index (DJ-AIGCI)
 Rogers International Commodity Index (RICI)
 Deutsche Bank Liquid Commodity Index (DBLCI)
Futures commission merchants
To buy futures contracts, options, and other derivatives, you probably want
to open an account with a futures commission merchant (FCM). Don’t be
intimidated by the name — an FCM is very much like your regular stockbro-
ker, except he doesn’t buy and sell stocks. Opening an account with an FCM
gives you the most direct access to the commodity futures markets.
If you’re going to trade futures contracts directly, you should have a solid
grasp of technical analysis, discussed in Book VIII.
Commodity trading advisors
If you’re interested in investing in commodities through the futures markets
or on a commodity exchange, getting advice from a trained professional is
always a good idea. One option is to hire the services of a commodity trading
advisor (CTA). Like an FCM, a CTA can help you open a futures account and
trade futures contracts. But she also can help you develop an investment
strategy based on your personal financial profile.
Make sure you research a CTA’s track record and investment philosophy to
make sure it squares with yours. Refer to Chapter 2 to identify key elements
to look for when shopping for a CTA.
235
Chapter 3: Welcoming Commodities into Your Portfolio
Book IV
Commodities

CTAs have to pass a rigorous financial, trading, and portfolio management
exam called the Series 3. Administered by the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority (FINRA), this exam tests the candidate’s knowledge of the com-
modities markets inside and out. By virtue of passing this exam and working
at a commodities firm, most CTAs have a good fundamental understanding of
the futures markets. CTAs are also licensed by the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission (CFTC) and registered with the National Futures
Association (NFA).
Commodity pools
Another way you can get access to the commodities futures markets is by
joining a commodity pool. As its name suggests, it is a pool of funds that
trades in the commodities futures markets. The commodity pool is managed
and operated by a designated commodity pool operator (CPO) who is licensed
with the NFA and registered with the CFTC. All investors share in the profits
(and losses) of the commodity pool based on how much capital they’ve con-
tributed to the pool.
Investing in a commodity pool has two main advantages over opening an indi-
vidual trading account with a CTA. First, because you’re joining a pool with a
number of different investors, your purchasing power increases significantly.
You get a lot more leverage and diversification if you’re trading a $1 million
account as opposed to a $10,000 account.
The second benefit, which may not seem obvious at first, is that commodity
pools tend to be structured as limited partnerships. This means that, as an
investor with a stake in the pool, the most you can lose is the principal you
invested in the first place. Losing your entire principal may seem like a bad
deal, but for the futures markets this is pretty good!
The CPO acts a lot like a CTA except that, instead of managing separate
accounts, the CPO has the authority to “pool” all client funds in one account
and trade them as if she were trading one account.
A good place to start looking for commodity pools is the Web site www.
commodities-investor.com.
Investing in commodity mutual funds
Commodity mutual funds are exactly like your average, run-of-the-mill mutual
funds except that they focus specifically on investing in commodities. You
have a number of such funds to choose from, but the two biggest ones are
offered by PIMCO and Oppenheimer.
236
Book IV: Commodities 

To find out more about commodity mutual funds, a very useful tool is the
Morningstar Web site (www.morningstar.com). This is an all-around excel-
lent resource for investors and includes lots of information related to com-
modity mutual funds, such as the latest news, load charges, and expense
ratios. It also uses a helpful five-star ratings system to rate mutual funds.
PIMCO
With more than $12 billion in assets under management, the PIMCO Commod-
ity Real Return Strategy Fund (PCRAX) is the largest commodity-oriented
fund in the market. Although the fund is actively managed, it seeks to broadly
mirror the performance of the Dow Jones-AIG Commodity Index. As such, the
fund invests directly in commodity-linked instruments such as futures con-
tracts, forward contracts, and options on futures.
Because these contracts are naturally leveraged, the fund also invests in
bonds and other fixed-income securities to act as a collateral to the commod-
ity instruments. This fund offers three classes of shares — A, B, and C — and
I encourage you to examine each class carefully in order to choose the best
one for you. For example, if you invest in Class A shares, there is a minimum
investment amount of $5,000, a front load of 5.5 percent, and an expense ratio
of 1.24 percent. When you invest in Class B shares, there is no front load, 
but there is a deferred sales charge of 5 percent and an expense ratio of 
1.99 percent.
A recent SEC ruling changed the way that mutual funds account for qualifying
income, and this has put some pressure on funds, particularly PIMCO, to
come up with different accounting methods. Make sure you find out how
such rulings affect your investments.
Oppenheimer
With a little under $2 billion in assets, the Oppenheimer Real Asset Fund
(QRAAX) is considerably smaller than the PIMCO fund. It tracks the perfor-
mance of the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index, an index that tracks a broad
basket of 24 commodities.
With $1,000 as its minimum investment requirement, Oppenheimer requires 
a little less capital upfront than PIMCO’s fund. It offers five classes of shares
(A, B, C, N, and Y), Class A being the most popular among average individual
investors. Class A shares have no deferred sales charge, although they have 
a front load of 5.75 percent and an expense ratio of 1.32 percent. So even
though you need less initial capital to invest in the Oppenheimer fund, it is
slightly more expensive than the PIMCO fund because of the front load
charges and its expense ratio.
237
Chapter 3: Welcoming Commodities into Your Portfolio
Book IV
Commodities

Other funds
Although Oppenheimer and PIMCO offer the two most popular commodity
funds, a number of other firms are starting to offer similar products to satisfy
the growing demand from investors for funds that have wide exposure to the
commodities markets. Two relative newcomers to the market are the Merrill
Lynch Real Investment (MDCDX) and the Credit Suisse Commodity Return
Strategy Fund (CRSCX). As more investors seek exposure to commodities,
expect more funds of this nature to crop up in the future. This is good news
because you have more funds to choose from!
Tapping commodity-based 
exchange-traded funds
Driven by a growing demand for commodities, many financial institutions are
now offering commodities-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This breed of
fund offers the diversification inherent in a mutual fund with the added bene-
fit of being able to trade that fund like a regular stock, giving you the power-
ful combination of diversification and liquidity.
Unlike a regular mutual fund, where the net asset value is generally calcu-
lated at the end of the trading day, the ETF allows you to trade throughout
the day. Furthermore, you can go both long and short on the ETF, something
you can’t do with regular mutual funds. (For more on ETFs in general, head to
Book II, Chapter 4.)
The first commodity ETF in the United States was launched by Deutsche Bank
in February 2006. The Deutsche Bank Commodity Index Tracking Fund (DBC)
is listed on the American Stock and Options Exchange (AMEX) and tracks the
Deutsche Bank Liquid Commodity Index (DBLCI). The DBLCI in turn tracks a
basket of six liquid commodities: light sweet crude oil (35 percent), heating
oil (20 percent), gold (10 percent), aluminum (12.5 percent), corn (11.25 per-
cent), and wheat (11.25 percent).
The DBC ETF invests directly in commodity futures contracts. In order to
capture additional yields, the energy contracts are rolled monthly, while the
rest of the contracts are rolled on an annual basis. The fund also invests in
fixed-income products, including the three-month Treasury bill. This pro-
vides an additional yield. With an expense ratio of 1.5 percent, it is a reason-
ably priced investment.
One of the downsides of investing in ETFs is that they can be fairly volatile
because they track derivative instruments that trade in the futures markets.
A downside of the DBC specifically is that it tracks a basket of only six com-
modities. However, more commodity ETFs are in the pipeline that will offer
even greater diversification benefits. A number of ETFs that track individual
commodities have launched fairly recently, such as
238
Book IV: Commodities 

 United States Oil Fund (USO): This is an ETF that seeks to mirror the
performance of the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures con-
tract on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX). Although the ETF
doesn’t reflect the movement of the WTI contract tick by tick, it does a
good job of broadly mirroring its performance. It’s a good way to get
exposure to crude oil without going through the futures markets.
 streetTRACKS Gold Shares (GLD): This ETF seeks to mirror the perfor-
mance of the price of gold on a daily basis. The fund actually holds physical
gold in vaults located in secure locations to provide investors with the abil-
ity to get exposure to physical gold without actually holding gold bullion.
 iShares Silver Trust (SLV): This is the first ETF to track the performance
of the price of physical silver. Like the gold ETF, the silver ETF holds
actual physical silver in vaults. This is a safe way to invest in the silver
markets without going through the futures or physical markets.
Make sure you examine all fees associated with the ETF before you invest.
Taking stock in commodity companies
Another route you can take to get exposure to commodities is to buy stocks
of commodity companies. These companies are generally involved in the pro-
duction, transformation, and/or distribution of various commodities.
This is perhaps the most indirect way of accessing the commodity markets
because in buying a company’s stock, you’re getting exposure not only to the
performance of the underlying commodity the company is involved in, but
also other factors such as the company’s management skills, creditworthi-
ness, and ability to generate cash flow and minimize expenses.
Publicly traded companies
Publicly traded companies can give you exposure to specific sectors of com-
modities, such as metals, energy, or agricultural products. Within these three
categories, you can choose companies that deal with specific methods or
commodities, such as refiners of crude oil into finished products or gold
mining companies.
If you’re considering an equity stake in a commodity company, you should
determine how the company’s stock performs relative to the price of the
underlying commodity that company is involved in.
Although no hard fast rule exists, there is a relatively strong correlation between
the performance of commodity futures contracts and the performance of
companies that use these commodities as inputs. So investing in the stock of
commodity companies actually gives you pretty good exposure to the under-
lying commodities themselves. However, be extra careful to perform a thor-
ough due diligence before you invest your money in these companies.
239

Master limited partnerships
If you’re interested in investing in companies that are involved in the produc-
tion, transformation, and distribution of commodities, one of the best ways
to do so is by investing in a master limited partnership (MLP). MLPs are a
great investment because of their tax advantage and high cash payouts.
When you invest in an MLP, you are essentially investing in a public partner-
ship. This partnership is run by a general partner (which can be an individual
or a corporate entity) for his/its benefit and, more importantly, for the benefit
of the limited partners (which you become when you buy MLP units).
One of the biggest advantages of MLPs is that, as a unit holder, you are taxed
only at the individual level. This is different than if you invest in a corpora-
tion, where cash back to shareholders (in the form of dividends) is taxed
both at the corporate level and the individual level. MLPs do not pay any cor-
porate tax! This is a huge benefit for your bottom line.
In order for an MLP to qualify for these tax breaks, it must generate 90 per-
cent of its income from qualifying sources that relate to commodities, partic-
ularly in the oil and gas industry. Some of the popular assets that MLPs invest
in include oil and gas storage facilities and transportation infrastructure such
as pipelines.
Investing in an MLP is actually quite simple. Because MLPs are publicly traded,
you can purchase any of them on the exchanges on which they’re traded; call
your broker to purchase MLP units or buy them through an online trading
account. Either way, buying MLP units is as simple as buying stocks. Table 3-1
lists some MLPs along with the exchanges they’re traded on.

Looking Before You Leap: Researching
Potential Investments
A large number of investors buy on hype; they hear a certain commodity
mentioned in the press, and they buy just because everyone else is buying.
Buying on impulse is one of the most detrimental habits you can develop as
an investor. Before you put your money in anything, you should find out as
much as possible about this potential investment.
Because you have a number of ways you can invest in commodities, the type
of research you perform depends on what approach you take. The following
sections go over the due diligence you should perform for each investment
methodology.
Asking some fundamental questions
Whether you decide to invest through futures contracts, managed funds, or
commodity companies, you need to gather as much information as possible
about the underlying commodity itself. This is perhaps the most important
piece of the commodities puzzle because the performance of any investment
vehicle you choose depends on what the actual fundamental supply and
demand story of the commodity is.
Here are a few questions you should ask yourself before you start investing in
any commodity:
 Which country/countries hold the largest reserves of the commodity?
 Is that country politically stable or is it vulnerable to turmoil?
 How much of the commodity is actually produced on a regular basis?
(Ideally, you want to get data for daily, monthly, quarterly, and annual
basis.)
 Which industries/countries are the largest consumers of the commodity?
 What are the primary uses of the commodity?
 Are there any alternatives to the commodity? If so, what are they and 
do they pose a significant risk to the production value of the target 
commodity?
 Are there any seasonal factors that affect the commodity?
 What is the correlation between the commodity and comparable com-
modities in the same category?
 What are the historical production and consumption cycles for the 
commodity?
241
Chapter 3: Welcoming Commodities into Your Portfolio
Book IV
Commodities

These are only a few questions you should ask before you invest in any com-
modity. Ideally you want to be able to gather this information before you
start trading.
Inquiring about futures contracts
If you are interested in investing through commodity futures, you need to ask
a lot of questions before you get started. Here are some:
 On what exchange is the futures contract traded?
 Is there an accompanying option contract for the commodity?
 Is the market for the contract liquid or illiquid? (You want it to be liquid.)
 Who are the main market participants?
 What is the expiration date for the contract you’re interested in?
 What is the open interest for the commodity?
 Are there any margin requirements? If so, what are they?
To find out more about trading futures contracts, as well as options, make
sure you read Book III.
Getting to know your managers
Before you work with a commodity trading advisor or a commodity pool
operator, or before you trust your money to the manager of a commodity
mutual fund, you need to find out as much as you can about these people.
Here are a few questions you should ask:
 What is the manager’s track record?
 What is his investing style? Is it conservative or aggressive?
 Does he have any disciplinary actions against him?
 What do clients have to say about him? (It’s okay to ask to speak to one
of his existing clients.)
 Is he registered with the appropriate regulatory bodies?
 What fees does he charge, and are there any undisclosed fees? (Always
watch out for hidden fees!)
242
Book IV: Commodities 

 How much assets does he have under management?
 What are his after-tax returns? (Make sure you specify after-tax returns
because many managers post returns before taxes are considered.)
 Are there minimum time commitments?
 Are there penalties if you choose to withdraw your money early?
 Are there minimum investment requirements?
Inspecting commodity companies
Here are a few questions you should ask before you buy a company’s stock:
 What are the company’s assets and liabilities?
 How effective is the management with the firm’s capital?
 Where will the firm generate future growth from?
 Where does the company actually generate its revenue from?
 Has the company run into any regulatory problems in the past?
 What is the company’s structure? (Some commodity companies are cor-
porations, while others act as limited partnerships.)
 How does the company compare with competitors?
 Does the company operate in regions of the world that are politically
unstable?
 What’s the company’s performance across business cycles?
Of course, these are only a few questions you should ask before making an
equity investment. I go through a series of other facts and figures you should
gather about commodity companies in Chapter 4 (for energy companies) and
Chapter 5 (for mining companies).
You can get the answers to some of these questions by looking through the
company’s annual report (Form 10-K) and/or quarterly reports (Form 8-K).

nergy is the largest commodities asset class and presents some solid
investment opportunities. This chapter helps you discover the ins and
outs of the energy markets and shows you ways to profit in this sector, from
trading crude oil futures contracts to investing in diversified electric utilities.
Investing in Crude Oil
Crude oil is undoubtedly the king of commodities, in terms of both its pro-
duction value and its importance to the global economy. It’s the most traded
nonfinancial commodity in the world, and it supplies 40 percent of the world’s
total energy needs — more than any other single commodity. As of this writing,
about 87 million barrels of crude oil are traded on a daily basis.
Crude oil’s importance also stems from the fact that it is the base product for
a number of indispensable goods. Gasoline, jet fuel, plastics, and a number of
other essential products are derived from it. Because of its preeminent role in
the global economy, crude oil makes for a great investment.
Crude oil by itself isn’t very useful; it derives its value from its derivative
products. Only after it is processed and refined into consumable products
such as gasoline, propane, and jet fuel does it become so valuable.

Facing the crude realities
Having a good understanding of global consumption and production patterns
is important if you’re considering investing in the oil industry, especially
when misconceptions abound. Following are a couple key (and perhaps sur-
prising) facts:
 The United States is the third largest producer of crude oil in the world,
producing more than 7 million barrels a day (this includes oil products),
behind only Saudi Arabia and Russia.
 The United States imports about 65 percent of its oil. The biggest oil
exporter to the United States isn’t a Middle Eastern country but our
friendly northern neighbor. That’s right: Canada is the largest exporter
of crude oil to the United States! Persian Gulf oil makes up about 20 per-
cent of imported oil.
Global oil reserves and production
As an investor, knowing which countries have large crude oil deposits is an
important part of your investment strategy. As demand for crude oil increases,
countries that have large deposits of this natural resource stand to benefit
tremendously. One way to benefit from this trend is to invest in countries and
companies with large reserves of crude oil. To determine which countries are
exploiting their reserves adequately, you also need to look at actual produc-
tion. Having large reserves is meaningless if a country isn’t tapping those
reserves to produce oil.
Table 4-1 lists the countries with the largest proven crude oil reserves, as
well as the top ten producers of crude oil. Note that the reserve figures may
change as new oilfields are discovered and as new technologies allow for the
extraction of additional oil from existing fields.

Oil Reserves Source: Oil & Gas Journal.
Although Canada does not appear on the reserve list, it has proven reserves
of 4.7 billion barrels of conventional crude oil — crude that is easily recover-
able and accounted for. In addition to conventional crude, Canada is rich in
unconventional crude oil located in oil sands, which is much more difficult to
extract and, therefore, generally not included in the calculation of official and
conventional reserve estimates. If Canada’s oil sands were included, Canada
would jump to number two with a grand total of 178 billion barrels.
If you’re an active oil trader with a futures account, it’s crucial that you follow
the daily production numbers, available through the Energy Information
Administration (EIA) Web site at www.eia.doe.gov. The futures markets are
particularly sensitive to these numbers, and any event that takes crude off
the market can have a sudden impact on crude futures contracts. To keep up
on updated figures and statistics on the oil industry, you can also check out
the following organizations:
 International Energy Agency (IEA): www.iea.org
 BP Statistical Review (BP): www.bp.com
 Oil & Gas Journal: www.ogj.com
Demand figures
Demand figures are important because they indicate a steady and sustained
increase in crude demand for the mid- to long term, which is likely to main-
tain increased pressure on crude prices. Table 4-2 lists the top ten consumers
of crude oil in the world.

The United States and China are currently the biggest consumers of crude oil
in the world, and this trend will continue throughout the 21st century, with
global consumption expected to increase to 120 million barrels a day by 2025.
Always design an investment strategy that will profit from long-term trends.
The steady increase in global demand for crude oil is a good reason to be
bullish on oil prices.
Imports and exports
Another pair of numbers you need to keep close tabs on is export and import
figures. Identifying the top exporting countries is helpful because it allows
you to zero in on the countries that are actually generating revenues from the
sale of crude oil to other countries. You can get in on the action by investing
domestically in these countries.
Imports are as important as exports in your calculations. Countries that are
main importers of crude oil are primarily advanced, industrialized societies
like Germany and the United States, which are rich enough that they can
absorb crude oil price increases. As a general rule, however, importers face a
lot of pressure during any price increases, which sometimes translates into
lower stock market performances in the importing countries. Be careful if
you’re exposed to the domestic stock markets of these oil importers. Table
4-3 shows the top oil-exporting and importing countries.

Crude quality
Crude oil is classified into two broad categories: light and sweet, and heavy
and sour. There are other classifications, but these are the two major ones.
The two criteria most widely used to determine the quality of crude oil are
density and sulfur content:
 Density usually refers to how much a crude oil will yield in terms of
products, such as heating oil and jet fuel. A crude oil with lower density,
known as a light crude, for example, tends to yield higher levels of
products. A crude oil with high density, commonly referred to as a heavy
crude, will have lower product yields.
 Sulfur content is another key determinant of crude oil quality. Sulfur is a
corrosive material that decreases the purity of a crude oil. Crude oil
with high sulfur content, which is known as sour, is much less desirable
than a crude oil with low sulfur content, known as sweet crude.
If you want to invest in the oil industry, you need to know what kind of oil
you’re going to get for your money. A company involved in the production of
light, sweet crude will generate more revenue than one involved in the pro-
cessing of heavy, sour crude. This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t invest in com-
panies with exposure to heavy, sour crude; you just have to factor the type
into your investment strategy.

Making big bucks with big oil
The price of crude oil has skyrocketed during the first years of the 21st cen-
tury (see Figure 4-1); if this trend is any indication of what’s in store for oil,
you definitely want to develop a winning game plan to take advantage of it.
The integrated oil companies, sometimes known as big oil, the majors, or 
integrated oil companies, are involved in all phases of the oil production 
process — from exploring for oil, to refining it, to transporting it to con-
sumers. ExxonMobil, Chevron Texaco, and BP are all “big oil” companies.
Big oil companies aren’t the only players in the oil business. A number of
other companies are involved in specific aspects of the transformational
process of crude oil. For example, you have companies like Valero that are
primarily involved in refining, and others such as General Maritime that own
fleets of tankers that transport crude oil and products. I discuss how to
invest in these companies — the refiners, transporters, and explorers — later
in the chapter in the section “Putting Your Money in Energy Companies.”
Buying into individual oil companies
The major oil companies have been posting record profits. In 2005, Exxon
Mobil announced the largest annual corporate profit in history as it earned a
staggering $36.1 billion on revenues of $371 billion! Exxon’s 2005 profits were
20 percent higher than its 2004 profits, which were over 10 percent higher than

the previous year’s! Another big oil company, ConocoPhillips, raked in $13.53
billion in profits for 2005, up 66 percent from the previous year. Chevron
Corp., meanwhile, posted $14.1 billion in earnings for 2005. These announce-
ments are a direct result of the increased global demand for crude oil and its
products.
As global demand continues and supplies remain limited, big oil companies
are likely to keep generating record revenues and profits. Table 4-4 lists some
of the companies that you may want to include in your portfolio. For a more
comprehensive list, check out Yahoo! Finance’s section on integrated oil com-
panies at http://biz.yahoo.com/ic/120.html.

Most of these traditional oil companies have now moved into other areas in
the energy sphere. These companies not only process crude oil into different
products, but they also have vast petrochemicals businesses as well as grow-
ing projects involving natural gas and, increasingly, alternative energy
sources. Investing in these oil companies gives you exposure to other sorts of
products in the energy industry as well.
Choosing oil company ETFs
If you can’t decide which oil company you want to invest in, you have several
other options at your disposal, which allow you to buy the market, so to
speak. One option is to buy exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the
251
Chapter 4: The Power House: Making Money in Energy
Book IV
Commodities

performance of a group of integrated oil companies. (ETFs are discussed in
detail in Book II, Chapter 4.) Here are a few oil company ETFs to consider:
 iShares S&P Global Energy Index Fund (AMEX: IXC): This ETF mirrors
the performance of the Standard & Poor’s Global Energy Sector index.
Buying this ETF gives you exposure to companies such as ExxonMobil,
Chevron, ConocoPhillips, and Royal Dutch Shell.
 Energy Select Sector SPDR (AMEX: XLE): The XLE ETF is the largest
energy ETF in the market. It is part of the S&P’s family of Standard &
Poor’s Depository Receipts (SPDRs), commonly referred to as spiders,
and tracks the performance of a basket of oil company stocks. Some of
the stocks it tracks include the majors ExxonMobil and Chevron; how-
ever, it also tracks oil services companies such as Halliburton and
Schlumberger. You get a nice mix of integrated oil companies as well as
other independent firms by investing in the XLE.
 iShares Goldman Sachs Natural Resources Index Fund (AMEX: IGE):
The IGE ETF mirrors the performance of the Goldman Sachs Natural
Resources Sector index, which tracks the performance of companies like
ConocoPhillips, Chevron, and BP, as well as refiners such as Valero and
Suncor. Although a majority of this ETF is invested in integrated oil
companies, it also provides you with a way to play a broad spectrum of
energy companies.
Investing overseas
Another great way to capitalize on oil profits is to invest in an emerging-
market fund that invests in countries that sit on large deposits of crude oil
and that have the infrastructure in place to export crude oil.
Here are a couple of emerging-markets funds that give you an indirect expo-
sure to booming oil-exporting countries:
 Fidelity Emerging Markets (FEMKX)
 Evergreen Emerging Markets Growth I (EMGYX)
Trading Natural Gas
Natural gas is an important source of energy both in the United States and
around the world, accounting for approximately 25 percent of energy con-
sumption. Because of its importance as a source of energy, natural gas makes
for a good investment.
252
Book IV: Commodities 

Although natural gas is sometimes used as a transportation fuel, the gasoline
you buy at the gas station and natural gas have nothing to do with each
other. The gasoline your car consumes is a product of crude oil, while natural
gas is an entirely different member of the fossil fuel family used primarily for
heating, cooling, and cooking purposes.
Liquefied natural gas, or LNG, is nothing but natural gas in a liquid state. LNG
is easy to transport — an important characteristic as meeting increasing
demand requires transporting natural gas across vast distances, like conti-
nents and oceans.
The majority of natural gas in the United States is transported through pipelines
in a gaseous state. LNG is usually transported in specially designed tankers
to consumer markets. Some of the major operators of natural gas pipelines
that transport both natural gas and LNG are entities known as master limited
partnerships (MLPs). You can profit from moving natural gas across the
United States by investing in MLPs.
Recognizing natural gas applications
Because it is one of the cleanest-burning fossil fuels, natural gas has become
increasingly popular as an energy source. In the United States alone, natural
gas accounts for nearly a quarter of total energy consumption. It’s second
only to petroleum when it comes to generating energy in the United States.
The primary consumers of this commodity are the industrial sector, resi-
dences, commercial interests, electricity generators, and the transportation
sector. Figure 4-2 shows the consumption ratio of these sectors.

Industrial uses
The industrial sector is the largest consumer of natural gas, accounting for
almost 40 percent of total consumption, using it for processing food, melting
glass and metal, incinerating waste, fueling industrial boilers, and more.
While industrial uses of natural gas have always played a major role in the
sector, their significance has increased over the last several years. As you
can see in Figure 4-3, the industrial sector’s demand for natural gas use is
projected to continue. (Actually, demand for natural gas products as a whole
is going to increase throughout the first quarter of the 21st century.) This
increased demand should put upward price pressures on natural gas.
Residential uses
Residential usage accounts for almost a quarter of total natural gas consump-
tion, with a large portion of homes in the United States and other countries
using natural gas for both cooking and heating needs. About 70 percent of
households in the United States have natural gas ovens in the kitchen. More
than 50 percent of homes in the United States use natural gas for heating
purposes.
One way to benefit from the use of natural gas as a heating fuel is to identify
peak periods of natural gas consumption. Specifically, demand for natural gas
for heating increases in the northern hemisphere during the winter seasons.
One way to profit in the natural gas markets is to calibrate your strategy to
this cyclical, weather-related trend.

Commercial uses
Commercial users, such as hospitals and schools, account for almost 15 per-
cent of total natural gas consumption, using it for space and water heating,
lighting, cooling, cooking, and so on. Because commercial users also include
restaurants, movie theaters, malls, and office buildings, demand for natural
gas from these key drivers of the economy will rise during times of increasing
economic activity. This means that, all things being equal, you should be bull-
ish on natural gas during times of economic growth.
One place to look for important economic clues that affect demand for nat-
ural gas is the Energy Information Administration (EIA), a division of the U.S.
Department of Energy (DOE). The EIA provides a wealth of information
regarding consumption trends of key energy products, such as natural gas,
from various economic sectors. For information on the commercial usage of
natural gas, visit www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/aeo/aeoref_tab.html.
Electricity generation
Natural gas is quickly becoming a popular alternative to generate electricity;
just under 25 percent of natural gas usage goes toward generating electricity.
In the United States, natural gas is used to support approximately 10 percent
of electricity generation, a figure that is expected to increase dramatically in
the coming years (see Figure 4-4). Such an increased demand from a critical
sector will keep upward pressures on natural gas prices over the long term.

Transportation uses
Natural gas is used in approximately 3 million vehicles worldwide as a source
of fuel. These natural gas vehicles (NGVs) run on a grade of natural gas called
compressed natural gas (CNG). While this usage accounts for only about 5 per-
cent of total natural gas consumption, demand for NGVs could increase as
they become a viable (cheaper) alternative to vehicles that use gasoline (a
crude oil derivative).
Keep a close eye on technological developments that affect natural gas usage
in the transportation sector. If natural gas were to grab a slice of the trans-
portation market, which now accounts for almost two-thirds of crude oil con-
sumption, prices for natural gas could increase dramatically. One place to
check out the latest info on NGVs is the International Association for Natural
Gas Vehicles; the Web site is www.iangv.org.
Choosing how to invest in natural gas
The future for natural gas looks bright. The total natural gas consumption on
a global scale in 2006 was approximately 110 trillion cubic feet (110 Tcf). By
2025, that figure is estimated to increase more than 50 percent — at a rate of
2.3 percent annually — to a total of 156 Tcf. More important than knowing
that demand for natural gas will remain steady until 2025 is figuring out
which countries and companies will be meeting this demand. Table 4-5 lists
the countries with the largest reserves of natural gas in the world.

Global natural gas reserves are estimated at 6112 Tcf, which is the equivalent
of approximately 6 quadrillion cubic feet. You can get exposure to the huge
natural gas market in a couple of ways: by trading futures contracts or by
investing in companies that are involved in the production and development
of natural gas fields in the countries listed in Table 4-5.
Trading natural gas futures
The most direct method of investing in natural gas is by trading futures con-
tracts on one of the designated commodities exchanges. On the New York
Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), the preeminent exchange for energy prod-
ucts, you can buy and sell natural gas futures and options. The natural gas
(Nat Gas) futures contract is the second most popular energy contract right
behind crude oil. Traded under the ticker symbol NG, it trades in increments
of 10,000 Mmbtu. You can trade it during all the calendar months, to periods
up to 72 months after the current month.
The NYMEX offers a mini version of this contract for individual hedgers and
speculators. Check out the Nat Gas section of the NYMEX Web site for more
on this contract: www.nymex.com/ng_pre_agree.aspx.
Trading natural gas futures contracts and options is not for the faint hearted.
Even by commodities standards, natural gas is a notoriously volatile com-
modity subject to wild price fluctuations. If you’re not an aggressive investor
willing to withstand the financial equivalent of a wild roller coaster ride, then
natural gas futures may not be for you.
Investing in natural gas companies
Investing in companies that process natural gas offers you exposure to this
market through the expertise and experience of industry professionals, without
the volatility of the futures market. Some natural gas companies are involved
in the production of natural gas fields, while others are responsible for deliv-
ering natural gas directly to consumers. Following are fully integrated natural
gas companies, which means they are involved in all the production, develop-
ment, transportation, and distribution phases of natural gas. Investing in
these companies provides you with a solid foothold in this industry:
 Alliant Energy (NYSE: LNT): Provides consumers with natural gas and
electricity derived from natural gas throughout the United States. A
good choice if you want exposure to the North American natural gas
market.
 Allegheny Energy (NYSE: AYE): Provides natural gas–based electricity
to consumers in the eastern United States, primarily in Pennsylvania,
Virginia, and Maryland. A good option if you want regional exposure to
natural gas production.

 Nicor Inc. (NYSE: GAS): Provides natural gas to more than 2 million con-
sumers, primarily centered in the Illinois area. Another good regional
investment.

distribution, look at the American Gas Association Web site: www.aga.org.
Looking at Other Energy Sources
While crude oil and natural gas are always in the spotlight, they aren’t the
only energy commodities you can consider. The following sections touch on
coal, nuclear power, and other sectors of the energy market that may be
worth your investment dollars.
Bowing to Ol’ King Coal
Coal, which accounted for 28 percent of total fossil fuel consumption in the
United States in 2006, is used primarily for electricity generation (steam coal)
and steel manufacturing (metallurgical coal). It’s an increasingly popular
fossil fuel because of its large reserves. Companies in the United States have
long touted the benefits of moving toward a more coal-based economy
because the United States has the largest coal reserves in the world.
Demand for coal is expected to increase dramatically during the first quarter
of the 21st century. Most of this growth will come from the emerging-market
economies, particularly the economies of China and India which will account
for approximately 75 percent of the demand increase for coal. (China is cur-
rently the largest consumer of coal in the world, ahead of the United States,
India, and Japan.) The coal markets have already started reacting to this
increased demand for the product. From 2002 to 2005, the price of coal in the
spot market rose from approximately $25 per short ton in January 2002 to
reach a high of more than $60 per short ton by January 2005.
Considering coal reserves and production
If you’re going to invest in coal, you need to know which countries have the
largest coal reserves. Just because a country has large deposits of a natural
resource, however, doesn’t mean that it exploits them to full capacity.
Therefore, there is a significant gap between countries with large coal
reserves and those that produce the most coal on an annual basis. Table 4-6
lists the top ten countries with the largest coal reserves, as well as the top
coal-producing countries.

Coal is measured in short tons. One short ton is the equivalent of 2,000
pounds. In terms of energy, one short ton of anthracite, the coal of highest
quality, contains approximately 25 million Btu of energy.
If you’re going to invest in a company that processes coal, select a company
with a heavy exposure in one of the countries listed in Table 4-6. Because the
United States, Russia, and China collectively hold more than 55 percent of the
world’s total coal reserves, investing in a coal company with large operations
in any of these countries will provide you with exposure to this important
segment of the market.
Before you invest in companies involved in the coal business, find out which
type of coal they produce, which can help you better understand the com-
pany’s business and profit margins. You can find this type of information in a
company’s annual and quarterly reports.

Investing in coal
You can get access to the coal markets by either trading coal futures or
investing in coal companies:
 Coal futures: Coal has an underlying futures contract that trades on a
commodity exchange, in this case the New York Mercantile Exchange
(NYMEX). The coal futures contract on the NYMEX tracks the price of
the high quality Central Appalachian coal (CAPP), sometimes affectionately
called the big sandy. The CAPP futures contract is the premium bench-
mark for coal prices in the United States. It trades under the ticker
symbol QL and is tradable during all the calendar months of the current
year, in addition to all calendar months in the subsequent three years.
Additional information on this futures contract is available on the
NYMEX Web site: www.nymex.com/coa_fut_descri.aspx.
Most of the traders in this market represent large commercial interests
that transact with each other, which means that you may not be able to
get involved directly in this market without large capital reserves to
compete with the commercial interests.
 Coal companies: One of the best ways to invest in coal is by investing in
a company that mines it. The following three companies are among the
best:
• Peabody Energy (NYSE: BTU): This is the largest coal company in
the United States with approximately 10.2 billion short tons of coal
reserves. The coal that Peabody produces is responsible for gener-
ating approximately 10 percent of the electricity in the United
States. The company has mining operations in the United States,
Australia, and Venezuela.
• Consol Energy (NYSE: CNX): Headquartered in Pittsburgh, Consol
Energy has significant operations in the coal mines of Pennsylvania
and the neighboring coal-rich states of West Virginia and Kentucky.
As of 2006, it controlled 4.5 billion short tons of coal reserves, with
operations in over 17 mines across the United States. CNX is well
positioned to take advantage of the booming domestic coal market.
• Arch Coal (NYSE: ACI): Smaller in size than Peabody or Consol,
Arch Coal operates more than 20 mines on the continental United
States and controls more than 3 billion short tons of reserves.
If you want to invest in coal companies with a more international expo-
sure to markets in Russia, China, and other coal-rich countries, consult
the World Coal Institute (www.worldcoal.org).

Embracing nuclear power
Civilian and commercial nuclear power is an integral part of the global energy
supply chain and is a valuable energy source for residential, commercial, and
industrial consumers worldwide. Nuclear power generates more than 20 per-
cent of the electricity in the United States; in countries like France, nuclear
power generates over 75 percent of electricity! Accounting for about 5 per-
cent of total global energy consumption, nuclear power is expected to remain
at stable levels until 2030. But if the price of fossil fuels (oil, natural gas, and
coal) rises dramatically enough to start affecting demand, nuclear may play
an important role in picking up the slack.
One way you can profit from increased interest in nuclear power is to invest
in uranium, the most widely used fuel in nuclear power plants. There’s been a
bull market in uranium from 2000 to 2007, and this shows no sign of slowing.
Because uranium isn’t a widely tradable commodity, the best way to profit
from this trend is to invest in companies that specialize in mining, process-
ing, and distributing uranium for civilian nuclear purposes. A few companies
in this sector include:
 Cameco Corp. (NYSE: CCJ): Cameco operates four uranium mines in the
United States and Canada. It’s also involved in refining and converting the
uranium into fuel sold to nuclear power plants to generate electricity.
 UEX Corp. (Toronto: UEX): This Canada-based mining company specializes
in the exploration and mining of uranium in the Athabasca basin. The
Athabasca basin in Canada is an important region in global uranium
mining that accounts for about 30 percent of total world production.
UEX is currently still in exploration phases, but it could become a real
money-maker if it comes across large deposits of uranium. The company
trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
 Strathmore Minerals Corp. (Toronto: STM): Strathmore — another
Canadian company — specializes in the mining of uranium. The company,
which trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange, operates in the Athabasca
region in Canada and in the United States.
For more information on nuclear power, the Energy Information
Administration (EIA) has an excellent Web site with all sorts of practical
information on this industry at www.eia.doe.gov/fuelnuclear.html.
Another great source for everything regarding uranium and nuclear power is
The Ux Consulting Company (www.uxc.com).

Trading electricity
Investing in coal and in nuclear power are ways to invest in electricity. But
there are also several ways you can invest directly in the power industry, as
the following sections explain.
Plugging into the electricity futures market
The New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) offers a futures contract that
tracks the price of electricity as administered by PJM Interconnection, a
regional transmission organization (RTO) that oversees the largest electric grid
system in the world and services more than 50 million customers in the United
States. It’s responsible for generating more than 700 million megawatt hours of
electricity across 55,000 miles of transmission lines. Because of its dominance in
the U.S. electricity market, the PJM electricity futures contract on the NYMEX
provides you with a widely recognizable and tradable electricity benchmark.
The PJM contract (traded under the symbol JM) offers you the option of trading
both on-peak and and off-peak electricity hours:
 On-peak: Monday through Friday between 7:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m.
 Off-peak: Monday through Friday from midnight to 7:00 a.m. local time;
all day Saturday and Sunday
On-peak hours are usually more liquid because that’s when most electricity is
consumed. For more information on this specific contract, check out the
NYMEX Web site at www.nymex.com/JM_desc.aspx.
Although most of the market participants in the electricity futures market are
local and regional power providers and suppliers, the futures contract lends
itself to being traded by individual speculators as well. In recent years, as
interest in commodities as an asset class has increased, the number of specu-
lative participants in the electricity market has grown.
Investing in utilities
Electric utilities are the companies responsible for providing electricity to
millions of folks in the United States and around the world, and they offer
sound investment opportunities. There are several reasons to like utilities,
but the main reason is their very high dividend payout. The industry has on
average a 3 percent dividend yield, one of the highest of any industry.
Dividends are a taxable source of income. Because of recent tax relief legisla-
tion, taxes on income generated through dividends are usually capped at 15
percent. However, Congress is considering an overhaul of the dividend tax in
2008 that may result in an increase in the dividends tax rate. Make sure to
keep a close eye on these dividend tax issues because they will have a direct
impact on your utility investments.

Tapping into renewable energy sources
Currently, renewable sources of energy make up about 8 percent of total
energy use in the world. This figure pales compared to the 87 percent share
of fossil fuels, but it has the potential to grow as nonrenewable energy
sources are depleted. The field of renewable energy is getting a lot of atten-
tion, and there is certainly potential to make some money in this field.
If you’re interested in keeping up-to-date on the latest developments in the
renewable energy space, check out the U.S. Department of Energy’s Energy
Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) initiative (www.eere.energy.gov).
Spotlighting solar energy
Solar power is the process by which energy from the sun is harnessed and
channeled into a usable energy form, generally heat or electricity. Solar
power can be transformed using two different processes:
 Solar thermal energy transforms the sun’s energy into heat, which can
be used for a number of different purposes, such as interior space heating
or water heating. Flat panel solar collectors mounted on homes or buildings
are used for solar thermal energy purposes.
 Solar photovoltaic energy is the method whereby energy from the sun
is captured and transformed into electricity.
In 2007, solar power accounted for a little less than 0.10 percent of total
energy consumed in the United States. This doesn’t mean, however, that you
can’t make any money investing in this sector. Because of technological
advancements, the future looks bright for solar energy. Of the many companies
that have entered the field of solar power, two companies stand out:
 Evergreen Solar (Nasdaq: ESLR): Evergreen Solar has operations in
Germany and the United States and is engaged in the production and
distribution of photovoltaic cells. It has a patented system that allows
for direct transformation from solar to consumable electricity, and it
sells its electricity directly to residential, commercial, and industrial
consumers.
 Suntech Power Holdings (NYSE: STP): This company, headquartered in
China, is involved in producing photovoltaic cells and panels for
electricity generation. It’s attractive because it has a foothold in China,
which could be a huge market for solar power.

Eyeing the potential of wind energy
Wind energy — generated by huge wind machines (similar to traditional wind
mills) that are placed side by side in wind farms — is getting increasing atten-
tion from investors, even though it is extremely difficult to invest in wind
energy at this stage. Currently very few publicly traded companies deal
specifically in wind power. However, with rising energy prices, wind energy
may get more focus. If you are interested in investing in wind power and want
to keep on top of any emerging trend, check out the American Wind Energy
Association (www.awea.org), which keeps a database of private companies
involved in wind energy that may go public one day.
Investing in ethanol
Ethanol, an alcohol fuel that can be used as a transportation fuel, can be
made from corn, sugar, wheat, and other agricultural products. In Brazil, the
world’s largest producer of ethanol fuel, ethanol is the primary automotive
fuel. The United States has seen an increase in the use of ethanol as a trans-
portation fuel, a trend that’s likely to increase. One company involved in the
production of ethanol that you may want to check out is Pacific Ethanol
(NASDAQ: PEIX).
Putting Your Money in 
Energy Companies
One way to play the energy markets is to invest in the companies involved in
the production, transformation, and distribution of the world’s most impor-
tant energy commodities. Each of the companies operating in these segments
of the market offers unique money-making investment opportunities. Finding
out about specialized energy and oil companies that are critical links in the
global crude oil supply chain can help you develop a targeted investment
strategy.
Profiting from oil exploration and production
The exploration and discovery of oil is a very lucrative segment in the oil busi-
ness. Fortunately, to strike it rich by discovering oil, you don’t have to go
prospecting for oil in the Texas heartland yourself. You can invest in compa-
nies that specialize in the exploration and production of oilfields, known in the
business as E&P. Oil wells are found in one of two places: on land or on sea.
264
Book IV: Commodities 

Among industry insiders, exploring for oil and gas is affectionately called
wildcatting. Most wildcatting expeditions end up without any oil discoveries.
When wildcatters drill a hole in the ground and no oil comes out, that is
known as having a dry hole, the unfortunate opposite of a gusher.
Going offshore
In recent years, offshore drilling has generated a lot of interest among
investors, and a flurry of activity has been taking place in this sector as oil on
land becomes more and more scarce. Here are some of the leading offshore
drilling companies:
 Transocean Inc. (NYSE: RIG): Transocean, with more than 90 offshore
drilling units at its disposal, is an expert in operating under harsh and
extreme weather conditions. It has offshore operations in the U.S. Gulf of
Mexico, Brazil, South Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, the North Sea,
Australia, and Southeast Asia. If you’re looking for the most diversified
company in the group, this is it.
 GlobalSantaFe Corp. (NYSE: GSF): GSF is a global offshore drilling con-
tractor, operating a fleet of more than 60 vessels in locations stretching
from Canada to the Middle East. It operates in three major segments: the
leasing of drilling equipment, services, and crews (contract drilling);
engineering and project services where it teams up with clients to provide
offshore engineering solutions; and turnkey services where it assumes
full control and responsibility of drilling projects from the design to the
implementation phase. GSF offers an array of full offshore services to its
clients, which include independent and integrated oil companies as well
as foreign governments and oil companies.
 Noble Corp. (NYSE: NE): Noble is one of the oldest drilling contractors
in the world. With a fleet of more than 60 vessels and operations stretching
from Brazil to the North Sea, it has an edge in implementing technologically
oriented solutions to meet customer demands.

which includes up-to-date information on the offshore industry as well as the
oil industry as a whole.
Staying on dry land
While most industry insiders agree that a majority of onshore oil wells have
been discovered, you can still benefit by investing in companies that are
involved in the exploitation and production of onshore oilfields. Here are a
couple of companies to consider:
265
Chapter 4: The Power House: Making Money in Energy
Book IV
Commodities

 Nabors Industries (NYSE: NBR): One of the largest land drilling contractors
in the world, Nabors has a division that can perform heavy-duty and
horizontal drilling activities.
 Patterson-UTI Energy Inc. (NASDAQ: PTEN): Patterson-UTI, an onshore
oilfield drilling contractor that has extensive operations in North
America, operates in a number of segments, including the drilling of new
wells and the servicing and maintenance of existing oil wells.
Servicing oilfields
You can also invest in companies that focus on oilfield maintenance and
services. These companies seek to maximize an oilfield’s output and are
generally hired by major integrated oil companies or national oil companies
for general oilfield and oil well maintenance and extraction solutions. The
added value of the oilfield services companies is that they can improve oil
recovery rates on existing fields and recover previously untapped oil pockets
in old fields. As fewer and fewer oilfields are discovered, the world’s major oil
companies are looking for ways to maximize existing oilfields. Therefore, the
role of the oilfield services companies will become increasingly important in
the future. Here is your hit list of top companies if you’re looking to invest in
the oilfield services space:
 Schlumberger Ltd. (NYSE: SLB): Schlumberger, one of the most techno-
logically savvy services companies, can provide solutions regarding all
aspects of oilfield management services, from exploration and extraction
to maintenance and abandonment.
 Halliburton Co. (NYSE: HAL): The Houston-based company makes a lot
of headlines (sometimes not very positive ones) because of the political
nature of its work with the U.S. government and military. Besides its gov-
ernmental contracts — which make up only a fraction of its revenues —
the company is a leader in oil and gas field maintenance. It helps cus-
tomers extract as much energy from existing wells as possible while
maintaining low costs.
 Baker Hughes Inc. (NYSE: BHI): Baker Hughes, also headquartered in
Houston, operates both in the United States and internationally, with
operations stretching from the Persian Gulf to West Africa. Baker Hughes
provides technologically oriented solutions to its customers to maximize
oilfield output efficiency.

Investing in refineries
To be useful, crude oil must be refined into consumable products such as
gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, automotive lubricating oil, propane and
kerosene, and a myriad of other products. For this reason, refineries are a
critical link in the crude oil supply chain. Given the importance of the crude
oil derivative products, you can make a lot of money investing in refineries.
When considering investing in companies that operate refineries, pay atten-
tion to three criteria (included in a company’s annual or quarterly reports):
 Refinery throughput: The capacity for refining crude oil over a given
period of time, usually expressed in barrels.
 Refinery production: Actual production of crude oil products, such as
gasoline and heating oil.
 Refinery utilization: The difference between production capacity (the
throughput) and what’s actually produced.
Most major integrated oil companies, like ExxonMobil and BP, have large
refining capacity. ExxonMobil, for example, operates the largest refinery in
the United States, with a refining capacity of 557,000 barrels per day. One way
to get exposure to the refining space is by investing in these major companies.
Another, more direct, way to profit from refining activity is by investing in
independent refineries, such as the following:
 Valero Energy Corp. (NYSE: VLO): Valero is the largest independent
refining company in North America, with a throughput capacity of 
3.3 million barrels per day.
 Sunoco Inc. (NYSE: SUN): The second largest refiner in terms of total refin-
ery throughput, Sunoco refines approximately 1 million barrels of crude a
day. It distributes its products primarily in the eastern United States.
 Tesoro Corp. (NYSE: TSO): Tesoro is one of the leading refiners in the
mid-continental and western United States. Its refineries transform
crude oil into gasoline distributed through a network of about 500 retail
outlets in the western United States.
The Energy Information Administration compiles data on all U.S. refineries at
www.eia.doe.gov/neic/rankings/refineries.htm.

Banking on the shipping industry
The shipping industry plays a crucial role in the integrated oil business. Two
out of every three barrels of oil that are transported are moved around in
ships (the remaining one-third are transported via pipelines). Fortunately, as
an investor, this provides you with fertile ground to make money in the trans-
portation of commodities.
Grasping transportation supply and demand
If you invest in shipping, you need to understand the relationship between
the price of crude oil and oil tanker profit margins (tanker spot rates), which
is affected by a number of variables.
Tanker spot rates — the bread and butter of the shipping industry — are
determined by supply and demand. The supply side consists of how many
ships are available to transport crude and products to the desired destina-
tions around the world. On the demand side is how much crude oil and prod-
ucts need to be shipped. In the global shipping business, you need to watch
these two factors closely.
Oil import dependency is another important demand factor. The lifeblood of
the global oil tanker business is the flow of oil across countries and conti-
nents, or the dependence on oil imports. One key metric to help you gauge
the level of activity in this area is global import and export data, which is
monitored by the Energy Information Administration’s energy statistics division
(www.eia.doe.gov/oil_gas/petroleum/info_glance/petroleum.html).
To the extent that crude oil prices affect the demand of crude oil worldwide,
crude oil prices will have an effect on tanker spot rates. If crude oil prices go
so high that folks are no longer willing to buy crude, thus reducing demand,
the demand for shipping crude oil worldwide will also decrease, causing
tanker spot rates to go down as well.
As with most things that have to do with commodities, tanker spot rates and
fixed rates, which provide the bulk of a shipping company’s revenue stream,
are highly cyclical. It’s not out of the ordinary for shipping rates to fluctuate
by 60 or 70 percent on a daily basis. To protect yourself from these extreme
price volatilities, you may want to invest in one of the large oil tanker stocks
mentioned in the upcoming section “Listing key petroleum shipping compa-
nies”; these companies have been in the business a long time and have sub-
stantial experience managing the wild price swings.
268
Book IV: Commodities 

Ships ahoy!
Before you invest in a tanker stock, closely examine the fleet of vessels it
operates. The following list of vessels used in the global crude oil shipping
industry can help you with this examination:
 Ultra Large Crude Carrier (ULCC): The largest vessels in the market,
ULCCs are used for long haul voyages. They offer economies of scale
because they can carry large amounts of oil across long distances.
 Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC): VLCCs are ideally suited for intercon-
tinental maritime transportation; their areas of operation include the
Persian Gulf to East Asia and West Africa to the United States, among
other routes.
 Suezmax: The size and design of this vessel allow it to transit through
the Suez Canal in Egypt. Ideally suited for medium haul voyages, these
vessels transport oil from the Persian Gulf to Europe, as well as to other
destinations.
 Aframax: The workhorse in the tanker fleet, the Aframax is capable of
transporting crude and products to most ports around the world.
Because of its smaller size, it is ideally suited for short haul voyages.
 Panamax: Named for its ability to transit the Panama Canal, this vessel
is sometimes used for short haul voyages between the ports in the
Caribbean, Europe, and the United States.
Besides their catchy names, these vessels are also identified by how much
crude oil and products they can transport on sea. The unit of measurement,
known as the dead weight ton, or DWT, measures the weight of the vessel
including all cargo. Most ships are constructed in such a way that one DWT is
the equivalent of 6.7 barrels of oil. Table 4-7 lists the DWT capacities of the
vessels, along with their equivalent in barrels of oil.

Listing key petroleum shipping companies
The companies responsible for transporting crude oil and petroleum products
are a diverse bunch. Some companies concentrate their operations regionally;
others transport oil and products all around the globe. Some operate a small
group of VLCC vessels, while others operate a large number of smaller vessels.
Some specialize in shipping only crude oil; others focus primarily on petroleum
products such as gasoline. With so many options to choose from, trying to
identify which company to invest in can be confusing. Here are all the major
publicly traded oil shipping companies to help you decide:
 Teekay Corp. (NYSE: TK): Teekay, one of the world’s largest seaborne
transporters of crude oil and crude oil products, operates a fleet of more
than 130 vessels, including one VLCC that transports crude from the
Persian Gulf and West Africa to Europe, the United States, and Asia; about
15 Suezmax vessels that connect producers in North Africa (Algeria) and
West Africa to consumers in Europe and the United States; and more than
40 Aframax vessels that operate in the North Sea, the Black Sea, the
Mediterranean Sea, and the Caribbean. In addition to conventional
tankers, Teekay operates a fleet of offshore tankers to transport crude
from offshore locations to onshore facilities. If you’re interested in a truly
global and diversified oil shipping company, consider this one.
 Frontline Ltd. (NYSE: FRO): One of the largest tanker companies in the
world in terms of transportation capacity, Frontline operates a fleet of
more than 44 VLCCs and more than 35 Suezmax vessels in the Persian
Gulf, Europe, the United States, and Asia. In addition to its tanker fleet,
Frontline offers shareholders very high dividend payouts.
 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. (NYSE: OSG): Although OSG has an
international presence, it’s the only company with a large presence in
the American shipping market. Its U.S. vessels are mainly engaged in the
transportation of crude oil from Alaska to the continental United States,
and products from the Gulf of Mexico to the East Coast. Additionally,
OSG has one of the highest profit margins in the industry: a whopping 
45 percent in 2006.
 General Maritime Corp. (NYSE: GMR): General Maritime focuses on the
small and mid-size segment of the tanker market, operating a fleet of
Suezmax and Aframax vessels primarily focused in the Atlantic basin.
General Maritime links producers and consumers from Western Africa,
the North Sea, the Caribbean, the United States, and Europe.

nvestors who have been able to master the fundamentals of the metals
markets have been handsomely rewarded. Gold, silver, and platinum have
industrial applications, but their primary value comes from their ability to
act as stores of value, in addition to their use in jewelry. Steel, aluminum, and
copper, while not as glamorous as their precious metal counterparts, are per-
haps even more precious to the global economy. Other important metals, like
palladium, zinc, and nickel, are also essential building blocks of the global
economy. In this chapter, I cover all these metals that can play an important
role in your portfolio.
Metals are classified into two broad categories: precious metals and base
metals. This classification is based on a metal’s resistance to corrosion and
oxidation: Precious metals have a high resistance to corrosion, whereas base
metals have a lower tolerance.
Going for the Gold
Perhaps no other metal — or commodity — in the world has the cachet and
prestige of gold. For centuries, gold has been coveted and valued for its
unique metallurgical characteristics. It is such a desirable commodity that a
number of currencies used to be based on its value. In addition, gold has a

274
Book IV: Commodities 
number of applications in industry and jewelry that have increased its
demand. Here are the characteristics that make gold such a hot commodity:
 Quasi-indestructibility: Corrosive agents such as oxygen and heat have
almost no effect on gold, which can retain its luster over thousands of
years. (The only chemical that affects gold is cyanide.)
 Rarity: Gold is one of the rarest natural resources on earth. All the gold
in the world would not even fill up four Olympic-size swimming pools!
 Malleability: Pure gold (24 karat) is very malleable and prized by crafts-
men around the world. One ounce of gold can be transformed into more
than 96 square feet of gold sheet!
 Ductility: Ductility measures how much a metal can be drawn out into a
wire, and gold is a very ductile metal. One ounce of gold can be converted
into more than 50 miles of gold wire, which can then be applied in
electronics.
Recognizing the gold standard
To profit from the demand for gold, you need to be familiar with the funda-
mentals of the gold market. First, you should know what gold is used for:
 Jewelry: Jewelry is the most important consumer use of gold in the
world, accounting for more than 70 percent of gold’s total consumption.
 Electronics: Because of its ability to efficiently conduct electricity, gold
is a popular metal in electronics.
 Dentistry: Because gold resists corrosion, it has wide application in
dentistry, where it’s alloyed with other metals to create dental fixtures.
 Monetary: Gold has many monetary uses: Many central banks hold
reserves of gold; it’s one of the only commodities that the investing
public holds in its physical form; and it’s used in coinage.
You also need to know how it’s measured. Gold, like most metals, is measured
and weighed in troy ounces (oz). One troy ounce is the equivalent of 31.10
grams. When you buy gold for investment purposes, such as through
exchange-traded funds or gold certificates, troy ounces is the measurement
of choice. When you want to refer to large quantities of gold, such as the
amount of gold a bank holds in reserve or the amount of gold produced in a
mine, the unit of measurement you use is metric tons. One metric ton is equal
to 32,150 troy ounces.
If you’ve ever bought gold jewelry (or heard a jewelry ad on TV), you’ve cer-
tainly heard of the measurement call karats (sometimes spelled carats). This
measurement indicates the purity of gold. The purest form of gold is 24 karat

gold (24K). Everything below that number denotes that the gold is alloyed, or
mixed, with another metal. The purer the gold, the higher its value:

Buying into the gold market
You can invest in gold in a number of ways: physical gold, gold ETFs, gold
mining companies, and gold futures contracts.
Getting physical
Gold is one of the few commodities that can be physically stored to have its
value preserved or increased over time, so one way to invest in gold is to
actually buy it. You can purchase gold coins or bars and store them in a safe
location as an investment.
To purchase physical gold, or even gold certificates (which I explain in a
moment), you need to go through a gold dealer such as Kitco (www.kitco.
com). Before doing business with any gold dealer, find out as much informa-
tion about the business and its history as possible. You can check out differ-
ent gold dealers by going through the Better Business Bureau at www.bbb.org.
Gold coins
One of the easiest ways to invest in physical gold is by buying gold coins.
Here are the most popular types of gold coins:
 Gold Eagle: Issued by the United States government, the 22 karat Gold
Eagle comes in various sizes including 1 ounce, 1⁄2 ounce, 1⁄4 ounce, and 
1⁄10 ounce
 Gold Maple Leaf: Issued by the Royal Canadian Mint, this 24 karat coin
is the purest gold coin on the market.
 Gold Krugerrand: Issued by the South African government, this is one
of the oldest gold coins issued in the world and has a fineness of 0.916.
(Fineness is the ratio of the primary metal to any additives or impurities.)

Gold bars
Gold bars have an undeniable allure. While gold coins are more suited for
smaller purchases, gold bars are ideal if you’re interested in purchasing
larger quantities of gold. Gold bars come in all shapes and sizes. They can be
as small as 1 gram or as large as 400 troy ounces. Most gold bars are high
quality with a fineness of 0.999 and above (24 karats). For a comprehensive
listing of gold bars, peruse The Industry Catalogue of Gold Bars Worldwide at
www.grendon.com.au/goldbarscat.htm.
FYI, the term gold bullion simply refers to large gold bars.
Gold certificates
Gold certificates enable you to own physical gold without actually taking
possession of it. Gold certificates certify that you own a certain amount of
gold, which is usually stored in a safe location by the authority that issues
the gold certificates. The gold standard of gold certificates is the Perth Mint
Certificate Program (PMCP). Administered by The Perth Mint, Australia’s oldest
and most important mint, the PMCP issues you a certificate and stores your
gold in a secure government vault. You may retrieve or sell your gold at any
point. For more on this program, check out The Perth Mint’s Web site at
www.perthmint.com.au.
Purchasing gold through ETFs
Currently you have two gold ETFs to choose from:
 streetTRACKS Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD): The streetTRACKS gold ETF is
the largest gold ETF on the market today. Launched in late 2004, it holds
about 12 million ounces of physical gold in secured locations. The price
per ETF unit is calculated based on the average of the bid/ask spread in
the gold spot market. This fund is a good way of getting exposure to
physical gold without actually owning it.
 iShares COMEX Gold Trust (AMEX: IAU): The iShares gold ETF holds a
little more than 1.3 million ounces of gold in its vaults. The per-unit price
of the ETF seeks to reflect the current market price in the spot market of
the ETF gold.
Because both ETFs track the price of gold on the spot market, their perfor-
mance is remarkably similar — at times, it’s actually identical. If you’re strug-
gling to decide between the two, consider that streetTRACKS holds more
physical gold and, more importantly, offers you more liquidity than the
iShares ETF.
Holding stock in gold companies
Another way to get exposure to gold is by investing in gold mining companies. A
number of companies specialize in mining, processing, and distributing gold. 
A few recommendations:
276
Book IV: Commodities 

 Newmont Mining Corp. (NYSE: NEM): Newmont is one of the largest gold
mining companies in the world, with operations in Australia, Indonesia,
Uzbekistan, the United States, Canada, Peru, and Bolivia. It is the largest
gold producer in South America and has exploration programs in Ghana
that could turn out to be very promising for the company.
 Barrick Gold Corp. (NYSE: ABX): Barrick, a Canadian company, is a pre-
mier player in the gold mining industry. It has operations in Canada, the
United States, Argentina, Peru, Chile, Tanzania, South Africa, Australia,
and Papua New Guinea, as well as a foothold in the potentially lucrative
Central Asian market, where it has joint operations in Turkey, Russia,
and Mongolia. Barrick also has one of the lowest production costs per
ounce of gold in the industry.
 AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (NYSE: AU): AngloGold, listed in five different
stock exchanges around the world, operates more than 20 mines and has
significant operations in Africa and South America, particularly in South
Africa, Namibia, Tanzania, Ghana, Mali, Brazil, Argentina, and Peru, which
all have major gold deposits. It has additional operations in Australia and
North America. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Anglo American PLC, a
global mining giant that I cover at the end of the chapter in “Putting Stock
in Diversified Mining Companies.”
These companies don’t give you direct exposure to gold, as gold certificates
or bars do, for example. Also, by investing in these stocks, you’re exposing
yourself to regulatory, managerial, and operational factors. Research the
company before you invest.
Getting in the game through gold futures contracts
With gold futures contracts, you invest in gold directly through the futures
markets. Two gold futures contracts are widely traded in the United States:
 COMEX Gold (COMEX: GC): The most liquid gold contract in the world,
this contract is traded on the COMEX division of the New York Mercantile
Exchange (NYMEX). Although large commercial consumers and producers,
such as jewelry manufacturers and mining companies, use these contracts
primarily for price hedging purposes, you can also purchase the contract for
investment purposes. Each contract represents 100 troy ounces of gold.
 CBOT Mini-Gold (CBOT: YG): Launched in 2004, this gold contract is a
relative newcomer to the North American gold futures market, but it’s
very attractive because you can trade it online through the Chicago
Board of Trade’s electronic trading platform. In addition, at a contract
size of 33.2 troy ounces, the mini is popular with investors and traders
who prefer to trade smaller size contracts.
Although the CBOT also offers the more traditional, full-size 100-ounce gold
ontract, the COMEX’s 100-ounce contract is currently the more liquid of the two.

Taking a Shine to Silver
Silver has a number of uses that make it an attractive investment. Here are
the most important ones, which account for more than 95 percent of total
demand for silver:
 Industrial: The industrial sector is the single largest consumer of silver
products, accounting for almost 47 percent of total silver consumption
in 2006. Silver has a number of applications in the industrial sector,
including creating control switches for electrical appliances and con-
necting electronic circuit boards.
 Jewelry and silverware: Silver plays a large role in creating jewelry and
silverware, accounting for 16 percent of total silver consumption in 2006.
 Photography: The photographic industry is a major consumer of silver,
accounting for about 24 percent of total consumption. (In photography,
silver is compounded with halogens to form silver halide, which is used
in photographic film.) The demand for silver by the photo industry is
slowly decreasing, however, because digital cameras, which don’t use
silver halide, are becoming more popular than traditional cameras.
Monitor the commercial activity in each of these market segments to look for
signs of strength or weakness, because a demand increase or decrease in one
of these markets will have a direct impact on the price of silver.
Because of its precious metal status, you can use silver as a hedge against
inflation and to preserve part of your portfolio’s value. And because it has
important industrial applications, you can use it for capital appreciation
opportunities. Whether for capital preservation or appreciation purposes,
there’s room in any portfolio for some exposure to silver.
If you’re interested in finding out more about silver and its investment possi-
bilities, The Silver Institute (www.silverinstitute.org), a trade association
for silver producers and consumers, maintains a comprehensive database on
the silver market.
Buying physical silver
Like gold, you can invest in silver by actually buying the stuff. Most dealers
that sell gold generally offer silver coins and bars as well. Here are two
products to consider as investments:
 Silver Maple Coins: These coins, a product of the Royal Canadian Mint,
are the standard for silver coins around the world. Each coin represents 
1 ounce of silver and has a purity of 99.99 percent, making it the most
pure silver coin on the market.
278
Book IV: Commodities 

 100 oz. Silver Bar: These bars are what their name indicates: 100-ounce
bars of silver. Before buying, check the bar to make sure it’s pure silver.
(You want 99 percent purity or above.)
Pure silver is sometimes alloyed with another metal, such as copper, in order
to make it stronger and more durable. The term sterling silver refers to a
specific silver alloy that contains 92.5 percent silver and 7.5 percent copper
or other base metals. Just remember that if you’re considering silver jewelry
as an investment, sterling silver won’t provide you with as much value in the
long term as buying pure silver.
Considering a silver ETF
One of the most convenient ways of investing in silver is by going through an
exchange-traded fund (ETF). Barclays Global Investors (a subsidiary of the
investment bank) launched an ETF through its iShares program in 2006 to
track the price of silver. The iShares Silver Trust (AMEX: SLV) holds silver
bullion in a vault and seeks to mirror the spot price of that silver based on
current market prices.
Looking at silver mining companies
Another alternative investment route is to go through companies that mine
silver. Although some of the larger mining companies (covered in the later
section “Putting Stock in Diversified Mining Companies”) have silver mining
operations, you can get a more direct exposure to the silver markets by
investing in companies that specialize in mining this precious metal. These
companies may not be household names, but they are a potentially good
investment nevertheless. Here are a couple of them:
 Pan American Silver Corp. (NASDAQ: PAAS): This well-managed
company, based in Vancouver, operates six mines in some of the most
prominent locations in the world, including Peru, Mexico, and Bolivia.
 Silver Wheaton Corp. (NYSE: SLW): Silver Wheaton, one of the few
companies focusing exclusively on developing and mining silver, has
operations in geographically diverse areas that stretch from Mexico to
Sweden.
279

Tapping into silver futures contracts
The silver futures contracts, like gold futures, provide you with the most
direct access to the silver market. Following are the most liquid silver futures
contracts:
 COMEX Silver (COMEX: SI): This silver contract is the standard futures
contract for silver. It is traded on the COMEX division of the New York
Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and represents 5,000 troy ounces of
silver per contract.
 CBOT Mini-Silver (CBOT: YI): The Mini-Silver contract that trades on
the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) represents a stake in 1,000 troy
ounces of silver with a purity of 99.9 percent. This contract is available
for electronic trading.
Putting Your Money in Platinum
Platinum, sometimes referred to as “the rich man’s gold,” is one of the rarest
and most precious metals in the world. Perhaps no other metal or commodity
carries the same cachet as platinum, and for good reason. If you were to put
all the platinum that has ever been mined in an Olympic-size swimming pool,
it wouldn’t even cover your ankles! Platinum has superior characteristics to
most metals: It is more resistant to corrosion, doesn’t oxidize in the air, and
has stable chemical properties.
Platinum is also the name of the group of metals that includes platinum,
palladium, rhodium, ruthenium, osmium, and iridium. In this section, I talk
about the metal only — not the group of metals. (I do cover palladium later 
in the chapter in the section “Appreciating Palladium.”)
Poring over some platinum facts
Deposits of platinum ore are extremely scarce and, more important, are geo-
graphically concentrated in a few regions around the globe, primarily in
South Africa, Russia, and North America. South Africa has the largest
deposits of platinum in the world and, by some accounts, may contain up to
90 percent of the world’s total reserve estimates. Russia is also a large player
in the production of platinum, currently accounting for 20 percent of total
global production (2006 figures). North America also contains some commer-
cially viable platinum mines, located mostly in Montana. Platinum’s rarity is
280
Book IV: Commodities 

reflected in its price per troy ounce. For example, the price of platinum in
October 2007 was $1,415 per troy ounce! By comparison, silver during the
same period cost $13.77 per troy ounce.
Platinum has several uses. Here are the most important ones:
 Catalytic converters: Platinum’s use in catalytic converters accounts for
more than 45 percent of total platinum demand. As environmental fuel
standards become more stringent, expect the demand from this sector
to increase.
 Jewelry: Jewelry once accounted for more than 50 percent of total
demand for platinum. Although that number has decreased, the jewelry
industry is still a major purchaser of platinum metals.
 Industrial: Platinum has wide applications in industry, being used in
everything from personal computer hard drives to fiber optic cables.
A change in demand from one of these industries will affect the price of
platinum. The International Platinum Association (www.ipa-news.com)
maintains an updated database of the uses of platinum. Check out the 
site for more information on platinum supply and demand.
Going platinum
Platinum’s unique characteristics as a highly sought-after precious metal with
industrial applications make it an ideal investment. Fortunately, you can invest
in platinum in a number of ways. I list a couple in the following sections.
Purchasing a platinum futures contract
The most direct way of investing in platinum is by going through the futures
markets. The New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) offers a platinum
futures contract. Because of increased demand from the industrial sector and
other fundamental supply and demand reasons, the price of the NYMEX plat-
inum futures contract has experienced a significant upward shift in recent
years. The NYMEX platinum futures contract represents 50 troy ounces of
platinum and is available for trading electronically. It trades under the ticker
symbol PL.
281

Commodities

Buying into platinum mining companies
Here are a couple of companies you can check out that will give you direct
exposure to platinum mining activities:
 Stillwater Mining Company (NYSE: SWC): Stillwater Mining, headquartered
in Billings, Montana, owns the rights to the Stillwater mining complex in
Montana, which contains one of the largest commercially viable platinum
mines in North America. This is a good play on North American 
platinum mining activities.
 Anglo American PLC (NASDAQ: AAUK): Anglo American is a diversified
mining company that has activities in gold, silver, platinum, and other
precious metals. It’s worth a look because it has significant interests in
South African platinum mines, the largest mines in the world.
Adding Some Steel to Your Portfolio
Steel, iron alloyed with other compounds (usually carbon), is still the most
widely produced metal in the world today. In a high-tech world dominated by
software and technological gadgets, this age-old metal is making a resurgence
as advanced developing countries — China, India, and Brazil — barrel down a
path toward rapid industrialization.
Getting the steely facts
Steel production today is dominated by China, which produces three times
more steel than Japan, the second largest producer. The United States is still
an important player in the steel industry, and other countries worth mention-
ing include Russia, Germany, and South Korea.
If you’re interested in exploring additional statistical information relating to
steel production and manufacturing, check out these resources: International
Iron and Steel Institute (www.worldsteel.org), Iron and Steel Statistics
Bureau (www.issb.co.uk), and the Association for Iron & Steel Technology
(www.aist.org).
Holding stock in steel companies
Currently, no underlying futures contract for steel exists. However, a number
of exchanges have expressed interest in developing a steel futures contract,
so keep an eye out for such a development. For now, the best way to get
exposure to steel is by investing in companies that produce steel, specifically
282
Book IV: Commodities 

globally integrated steel companies. Following, I list good investments that
are not only the best-run companies but also show the greatest potential for
future market dominance:
 U.S. Steel (NYSE: X): U.S. Steel, formed as a result of the consolidation of
Andrew Carnegie’s steel holdings in the early 20th century, is one of the
oldest and largest steel companies in the world. Today it’s the seventh
largest steel-producing company worldwide, involved in all aspects of
the steel-making process from iron ore mining and processing to the
marketing of finished products.
 Nucor Corp. (NYSE: NUE): Nucor operates almost exclusively in the
United States, offering exposure to the U.S. steel market. It’s also one of
the only companies to operate mini-mills domestically, which many
people argue are more cost-efficient than the traditional blast furnaces.
 ArcelorMittal (NYSE: MT): In 2006, the two largest steel companies in
the world merged. The newly formed company controls more than 10
percent of the world’s steel market (in terms of output) and produces
approximately 120 million metric tons of steel annually.
Inviting Aluminum to Your Investments
Aluminum, generally measured in metric tons (MT), is lightweight, resistant to
corrosion, durable, and sturdy. It’s the second most widely used metal in the
world, right after steel, and is used in the following sectors:
 Transportation (26 percent of total aluminum consumption):
Aluminum is used in car bodies, axles, and, in some cases, engines. It’s
also used in large commercial aircraft.
 Packaging (22 percent): Almost a quarter of aluminum is used to make
aluminum wrap and foil, along with beverage cans and rivets.
 Construction (22 percent): Aluminum’s industrial uses include construction
of buildings, oil pipelines, and even bridges.
 Other: Aluminum is also used in electrical (8 percent), machinery 
(8 percent), and consumer goods (7 percent).
The underlying demand from rapidly industrializing nations such as China
and India has resulted in upward price pressures on the metal.
To find out more about the aluminum industry, check out these organiza-
tions: International Aluminium Institute (www.world-aluminium.org), the
Aluminum Association (www.aluminum.org), and aluNET International
(www.alunet.net).

Trading aluminum futures
You can invest in aluminum through the futures markets. Currently, two
major contracts for aluminum are available:
 LME Aluminum (LAH): The London Metal Exchange’s aluminum
contract is the most liquid in the world. The LME aluminum contract
represents a size of 25,000 tons, and its price is quoted in U.S. dollars.
 COMEX Aluminum (COMEX: AL): The aluminum contract traded on the
COMEX division of the NYMEX trades in units of 44,000 pounds, with a
99.7 percent purity. The contract is tradable during the current calendar
month as well as for the next 25 consecutive months. It’s also available
for trade electronically.
If you start investing in futures and something goes wrong, you need to know
who to turn to. NYMEX, located in the United States, is regulated by the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). LME, located in the United
Kingdom, falls under the jurisdiction of the Financial Services Authority
(FSA), the British regulator.
Considering aluminum companies
Another way to invest in aluminum is to invest in companies that produce
and manufacture aluminum products. Here are a few companies that make
the cut:
 Alcoa (NYSE: AA): The world leader in aluminum production, Alcoa is
involved in all aspects of the aluminum industry and produces primary alu-
minum, fabricated aluminum, and alumina. The company has operations in
more than 40 countries and services a large number of industries, from
aerospace to construction. Alcoa is a good choice if you’re looking to get
the broadest exposure to the aluminum market.
 Alcan (NYSE: AL): Alcan, headquartered in Canada, is a leading global
manufacturer of aluminum products. It has operations that cover the
spectrum of aluminum processing, from mining and refining to smelting
and recycling. Alcan provides you with wide exposure to aluminum.
 Aluminum Corporation of China (NYSE: ACH): ACH is primarily
engaged in the production of aluminum in the Chinese market. This com-
pany, which trades on the New York Stock Exchange, provides a foothold
in the aluminum Chinese market, which has the potential to be the
biggest such market in the future. Besides of this competitive advantage,
ACH boasts profit margins that, during the writing of this book, were in
excess of 16 percent.
284
Book IV: Commodities 

Seeing the Strengths of Copper
Copper, the third most widely used metal in the world, has applications in
many sectors and is sought after because of its high electrical conductivity,
resistance to corrosion, and malleability. Because of the current trends of
industrialization and urbanization across the globe, demand for copper has
been — and will remain — very strong.
Copper is used for a wide variety of purposes, from building and construction
to electrical wiring, engineering, and transportation. To find out more about
copper usage, consult the Copper Development Association (www.copper.org).
Copper is often alloyed with other metals, usually with nickel (to make copper)
and zinc (to make brass). Ironically, the U.S. penny, the only U.S. coin that’s a
reddish-brown color (the color of copper), uses only 2.5 percent copper; the
other 97.5 percent of the penny is made from zinc. The other coins in U.S.
currency, which are all silvery-white colors, contain more than 90 percent
copper.
Buying copper futures contracts
A futures market is available for copper trading. Most of this market is used
by large industrial producers and consumers of the metal, although you can
also use it for investment purposes. You have two copper contracts to
choose from:
 LME Copper (LME: CAD): The copper contract on the London Metal
Exchange (LME) accounts for more than 90 percent of total copper
futures activity. It represents a lot size of 25 tons.
 COMEX Copper (COMEX: HG): This copper contract trades in the
COMEX division of the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX). The
contract, which trades during the current month and subsequent 23
calendar months, is traded both electronically and through the open
outcry system. It represents 25,000 pounds of copper.
Demand for copper from China, India, and other advanced developing coun-
tries is increasing, which has put upward pressure on the price of copper.
Investing in copper companies
You can invest in copper by getting involved in companies that specialize in
mining and processing copper ore. An industry leader involved in all aspects
of the copper supply chain is Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (NYSE:
285
Chapter 5: Pedal to the Metal: Investing in Metals
Book IV
Commodities

FCX). Freeport-McMoRan is one of the lowest cost producers of copper in the
world. It has copper mining and smelting operations across the globe and has
a significant presence in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. The company spe-
cializes in the production of highly concentrated copper ore, which it then
sells on the open market. FCX also has some operations in gold and silver.
The company acquired Phelps Dodge, one of the oldest mining companies in
the United States, in 2007.
Appreciating Palladium
Palladium, which belongs to the group of platinum metals, is a popular alter-
native to platinum in the automotive and jewelry industries. Its largest use is
in the creation of pollution-reducing catalytic converters. Because of palla-
dium’s malleability, corrosion resistance, and price (it’s less expensive than
platinum: $380 per ounce versus $1,415 per ounce in October 2007), it’s
increasingly becoming the metal of choice for the manufacture of these
devices. Palladium is also used in dentistry and electronics.
When pollution-reducing regulation was established in the United States in
the 1970s, demand for palladium skyrocketed. All things equal, if emissions
standards are further improved and require a new generation of catalytic
converters, demand for palladium will increase again. Another reason to be
bullish on palladium is that the number of automobiles, trucks, and other
vehicles equipped with platinum- and palladium-made catalytic converters is
increasing, particularly in China. So if you invest in palladium, make sure you
keep an eye on automobile manufacturing patterns.
The palladium market is essentially dominated by two countries: Russia and
South Africa. These two countries account for more than 85 percent of total
palladium production. Any supply disruption from either country has a signif-
icant impact on palladium prices.
One of the best — albeit indirect — methods of getting exposure to the palla-
dium markets is by investing in companies that mine the metal. A number of
companies specialize in this activity; following are the two largest companies
that trade publicly on U.S. exchanges:
 Stillwater Mining Company (NYSE: SWC): Stillwater Mining is the
largest producer of palladium outside South Africa and Russia. It pro-
duces approximately 500,000 ounces of palladium a year, primarily
through North American mines.
 North American Palladium (AMEX: PAL): North American Palladium,
headquartered in Toronto, has a significant presence in the Canadian
palladium ore mining business. It is the largest producer of palladium in
Canada, with production in 2006 totaling more than 237,000 ounces.
286
Book IV: Commodities 

Several international companies have significantly larger palladium mining
activities than these two. Here are a couple of international palladium compa-
nies to consider. (Before investing, make sure you’re aware of the many regu-
latory differences between U.S. and overseas markets.)
 Anglo Platinum Group (South Africa): Anglo Platinum Group, one of the
largest producers of palladium in the world, produced more than 2.5 million
ounces of palladium in 2005 and is estimated to have reserves of more
than 200 million ounces (this includes other platinum group metals).
With its operations located primarily in South Africa, Anglo Platinum
Group is your gateway to South African palladium. Its shares are traded
on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE), as well as the London Stock
Exchange (LSE).
 Norilsk Nickel (Russia): Norilsk Nickel, the largest producer of palladium
in the world, dominates the Russian palladium industry. While the company
has large palladium mining activities, it’s also a major player in copper
and nickel ore mining. The company’s shares are available through the
Moscow Inter-bank Currency Exchange (MICEX).
For folks who are comfortable in the futures markets, the New York Mercantile
Exchange (NYMEX) offers a futures contract that tracks palladium. This
contract represents 100 troy ounces of palladium and trades both electronically
and during the open outcry session. It trades under the symbol PA.
Keeping an Eye on Zinc
Zinc is the fourth most widely used metal, right behind iron/steel, aluminum,
and copper. Zinc, which has unique abilities to resist corrosion and oxidation,
is used for metal galvanization, the process of applying a metal coating to
another metal to prevent rust and corrosion. Galvanization is by far the largest
application of zinc (accounting for 47 percent of zinc usage), but zinc has other
applications as well: brass and bronze coatings and zinc alloying, for example.
The best way to invest in zinc is by going through the futures markets. The
London Metal Exchange (LME) offers a futures contract for zinc, which has
been trading since the early 1900s and is the industry benchmark for zinc

Noting the Merits of Nickel
Nickel is sought-after for its ductility, malleability, and resistance to corro-
sion. Although there are a number of important uses for nickel, the creation
of stainless steel remains its primary application (accounting for 65 percent
of its market consumption). Nickel is also used in non-ferrous alloys, ferrous
alloys, and electroplating, among other things.
Australia has the largest reserves of nickel, and its proximity to the rapidly
industrializing Asian center — China and India — is a strategic advantage.
Another major player in the nickel markets is Russia; the Russian company
Norilsk Nickel (covered in the section on palladium) is the largest producer
of nickel in the world. Nickel mining is a labor-intensive industry, but those
countries that have large reserves of this special metal, listed in Table 5-1, are
poised to do very well.

Putting Stock in Diversified 
Mining Companies
Trading metals outright — through the futures markets — can be tricky for
the uninitiated trader. You have to keep track of a number of moving pieces,
such as contract expiration dates, margin calls, trading months, and other
variables. In addition, metals on the futures markets can be subject to
extreme price volatility, and you can set yourself up for disastrous losses. So
it’s understandable if you’d rather not trade metals futures contracts. But
this doesn’t mean that you should ignore the metals sub-asset class altogether
because you could be missing out on some tasty returns.
One possible avenue for opening up your portfolio to metals is investing in
companies that mine metals and minerals. A number of such companies
exist, and their performance has been stellar recently. This section looks at
the top diversified companies. For information about specialized mining com-
panies, refer back to the section that covers the metal you’re interested in.
Diversified mining companies are involved in all aspects of the metals pro-
duction process. These companies, which often employ tens of thousands of
people, have operations in all four corners of the globe. They’re involved in
the excavation of metals, as well as the transformation of these metals into
finished products and subsequent distribution of the end products to con-
sumers. Investing in one of these companies gives you exposure not only to a
wide variety of metals, but also to the whole mining supply chain.
BHP Billiton
BHP Billiton is one of the largest mining companies in the world.
Headquartered in Melbourne, Australia, it has mining operations in more
than 25 countries including Australia, Canada, the United States, South Africa,
and Papua New Guinea. The company processes a large number of metals,
including aluminum, copper, silver, and iron; it also has small oil and natural
gas operations in Algeria and Pakistan. The company is listed on the New
York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol BHP.
In recent years, the company has benefited handsomely from the increasing
prices of commodities such as copper and aluminum. As a result, BHP
Billiton’s profit increased by a staggering 108 percent between 2005 and 2006.

Rio Tinto
Rio Tinto was founded in 1873 by the Rothschild banking family to mine ore
deposits in Spain. Today, Rio Tinto boasts operations in Africa, Australia,
Europe, the Pacific Rim, North America, and South America. The company is
involved in the production of a number of commodities, including iron ore,
copper, aluminum, and titanium. In addition, Rio Tinto has interests in dia-
monds, manufacturing almost 30 percent of global natural diamonds,
processed primarily through its mining activities in Australia.
Rio Tinto trades on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker
symbol RTP.
Anglo American
Anglo American PLC began mining gold in South Africa in 1917. Ever since, it
has played an important role in the development of South Africa’s gold mining
industry. Today, Anglo American has operations in all four corners of the globe
and operates in more than 20 countries. It is involved in the production and dis-
tribution of a wide array of metals, minerals, and natural resources including
gold, silver, and platinum but also diamonds and paper packaging. (It owns 45
percent of De Beers, the diamond company.)
The company is listed in the London Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol
AAL. In addition, it has American Depository Receipts listed in the NASDAQ
National Market that trade under the symbol AAUK.

 Investing in the soft commodities: coffee, cocoa, sugar, and orange juice
 Exploring the ags: corn, wheat, and soybeans
 Trading livestock: cattle, lean hogs, and frozen pork bellies
F
ood is the most essential resource in human life. Investing in this sector
can also help improve your bottom line. This chapter introduces the major
sectors in this sub-asset class and shows you how to profit from grains such as
corn and wheat; tropical commodities like coffee and orange juice; and livestock.
Profiting from the Softs: Coffee, 
Cocoa, Sugar, and OJ
The commodities I present in this section — coffee, cocoa, sugar, and frozen
concentrated orange juice — are known as soft commodities. Soft commodities
are those commodities that are usually grown, as opposed to those that are
mined, such as metals, or those that are raised, such as livestock. The softs, as
they are sometimes known, represent a significant portion of the commodities
markets. They are indispensable and cyclical, just like energy and metals, but
they are also unique because they’re edible and seasonal. Seasonality is actually
a major distinguishing characteristic of soft commodities because they can be
grown only during specific times of the year and in specific geographical
locations — usually in tropical areas. (This is why these commodities are also
known as tropical commodities.) In this section, I show you that there’s nothing
soft about these soft commodities.

Feeling the buzz from coffee
Coffee is the second most widely traded commodity in terms of physical volume,
behind only crude oil (see Chapter 4). Like a number of other commodities,
coffee production is dominated by a handful of countries. Brazil, Colombia, and
Vietnam are the largest producing countries, as you can see in Table 6-1.

Just like choosing the right flavor when buying your cup of coffee, knowing
the different types of coffees available for investment is important. The
world’s coffee production is pretty much made up of two types of beans:
 Arabica: Arabica coffee accounts for more than 60 percent of global
coffee production. It’s grown in countries as diverse as Brazil and
Indonesia and is the premium coffee bean, adding a richer taste to any
brew. As a result, it’s the most expensive coffee bean. It serves as the
benchmark for coffee prices all over the world.
 Robusta: Robusta accounts for about 40 percent of total coffee production.
Because it’s easier to grow than Arabica coffee, it’s also less expensive.
You can invest in coffee production by buying coffee in the futures markets or
by investing in companies that specialize in running gourmet coffee shops.
To find out more about coffee markets, consult these resources: International
Coffee Organization (www.ico.org) and the National Coffee Association of
the U.S.A. (www.ncausa.org).

A number of organizations that offer information on specific commodities are
specialized lobby groups whose agenda — alongside providing information
to the public — includes promoting the consumption of the products they
represent. Keep this in mind as you consult any outside resource for research
purposes.
The coffee futures contract: It could be your cup of tea
The coffee futures markets are used to determine the future price of coffee
and, more importantly, to protect producers and purchasers of coffee from
wild price swings and to allow individual investors to profit from coffee price
variations. The most liquid coffee futures contract is available on the New
York Board of Trade (NYBOT).
The NYBOT coffee futures contract is one of the oldest futures contracts in
the market today. Here are its contract specs:
 Contract ticker symbol: KC
 Contract size: 37,500 pounds
 Underlying commodity: Pure Arabica coffee
 Price fluctuation: $0.0005/pound ($18.75 per contract)
 Trading months: March, May, July, September, December
Because of seasonality, cyclicality, and geopolitical factors, coffee can be a
volatile commodity subject to extreme price swings. Make sure to research
the coffee markets inside and out before investing.
Investing in gourmet coffee shops
Coffee is serious business, and you can profit from the coffee craze that has
gripped the United States (the largest consumer of coffee in the world) and is
spreading throughout Europe and newly-developing countries like India and
China by investing in the companies that are capitalizing on the gourmet
coffee shop trend. Find out where your $4.50 for a cup of coffee is going and
profit from it:
 Starbucks Corp. (NASDAQ: SBUX): Starbucks is a cultural phenomenon,
but, more important, it’s also a financial Juggernaut. With more than 
$7 billion in revenue, Starbucks dominates the entire coffee supply
chain, from purchasing and roasting to selling and marketing. It has
more than 10,000 stores worldwide, primarily in the United States and
Europe but also in China, Singapore, and even one in Saudi Arabia.
 Peet’s Coffee and Tea, Inc. (NASDAQ: PEET): Peet’s Coffee operates
only about 100 coffee shops, but its strength lies in distribution. The
company sells a large selection of coffees, produced in countries as
diverse as Guatemala and Kenya, to customers across the United States,
including restaurants and grocery stores.

 Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, Inc. (NASDAQ: GMCR): Green Mountain
Coffee, headquartered in Vermont, operates in the distribution of specialized
coffee products to a number of entities, such as convenience stores,
specialty retailers, and restaurants. It has a large presence in the East
Coast and has a partnership with Paul Newman’s Newman’s Own company
to provide organic coffee to customers. This is a good company if you
want exposure to the high-end coffee distribution market in the
Northeast.
Heating up your portfolio with cocoa
Cocoa is a fermented seed from the cacao tree, which is usually grown in hot
and rainy regions around the equator. The first cacao tree is said to have
originated in South America, but today the cocoa trade is dominated by
African countries, as you can see in Table 6-2.

Like coffee, the cocoa market is subject to seasonal and cyclical factors that
have a large impact on price movements, which can be pretty volatile.
Being sweet on sugar
Although sugar production began more than 9,000 years ago in southeastern
Asia, today, Latin American countries dominate the sugar trade. Brazil is the
largest sugar producer in the world, as you can see in Table 6-3.

Getting healthy profits from OJ
Orange juice is one of the only actively traded contracts in the futures mar-
kets that’s based on a tropical fruit. Oranges are widely grown in the western
hemisphere, particularly in Florida and Brazil. As you can see in Table 6-4,
Brazil is by far the largest producer of oranges, although the United States —
primarily Florida — is also a major player.

Because oranges are perishable, the futures contract tracks frozen concen-
trated orange juice (FCOJ). This particular form is suitable for storage and fits
one of the criteria for inclusion in the futures arena: that the underlying com-
modity be deliverable. This contract is available for trade on the New York
Board of Trade (NYBOT). The NYBOT includes two versions of the FCOJ con-
tract: one that tracks the Florida/Brazil oranges (FCOJ-A) and another one
based on global production (FCOJ-B). Here are the contract specs for both:

The production of oranges is very sensitive to weather. The hurricane season
common in the Florida region, for example, can have a significant impact on
the prices of oranges both on the spot market and in the futures market.
Make sure to take into consideration weather and seasonality when investing
in FCOJ futures.
Trading Ags: Corn, Wheat, and Soybeans
The major agricultural commodities that trade in the futures markets, sometimes
simply known as ags, are a unique component of the broader commodities
markets. They are very labor intensive and are subject to volatility because of
underlying market fundamentals. However, they also present solid investment
opportunities.
For additional information on agricultural commodities in general, check out
the following resources: National Grain and Feed Association (www.ngfa.
org), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) (www.usda.gov), USDA National
Agriculture Library (www.nal.usda.gov), and USDA National Agricultural
Statistics Service (www.nass.usda.gov).
Fields of dreams: Corn
Corn is definitely big business. In 2006, world corn production stood at
almost 700 million metric tons. Approximately 35 million hectares of land are
used exclusively for the production of corn worldwide, a business that the
U.S. Department of Agriculture values at over $20 billion a year.
297
Chapter 6: Down on the Farm: Trading Agricultural Products
Book IV

The most direct way of investing in corn is by going through the futures mar-
kets. A corn contract exists, courtesy of the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT),
to help farmers, consumers, and investors manage and profit from the under-
lying market opportunities. Here are the contract specs:
 Contract ticker symbol: C
 Electronic ticker: ZC
 Contract size: 5,000 bushels
 Underlying commodity: High grade No. 2 or No. 3 yellow corn
 Price fluctuation: $0.0025/bushel ($12.50 per contract)
 Trading hours: 9:05 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. open outcry; 6:30 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.
electronic (Chicago Time)
 Trading months: March, May, July, September, December
Both high-grade number 2 and number 3 yellow corn are traded in the futures
markets. In addition, corn futures contracts are usually measured in bushels.
Large scale corn production and consumption is generally measured in
metric tons.
Historically, the United States has dominated the corn markets, and still does
due to abundant land and helpful governmental subsidies. China is also a
major player and exhibits a lot of potential for being a market leader in the
coming years. Other notable producers include Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, and
France, listed in Table 6-5.

Like other agricultural commodities, corn is subject to seasonal and cyclical
factors that have a direct, and often powerful, effect on prices. Prices for corn
can go through roller coaster rides, with wild swings in short periods of time.
For more information on the corn markets, check out the following sources:
National Corn Growers Association (www.ncga.com), Corn Refiners Association
(www.corn.org), and USDA Economic Research Service (www.ers.usda.gov/
briefing/corn).
The bread basket: Wheat
Wheat is the second most widely produced agricultural commodity in the
world (on a per volume basis), right behind corn and ahead of rice. World
wheat production was more than 600 million metric tons in 2006, according
to the USDA.
Unlike other commodities that are dominated by single producers — Saudi
Arabia and oil, the Ivory Coast and cocoa, Russia and palladium — no one
country dominates wheat production. As a matter of fact, as you can see
from Table 6-6, the major wheat producers are a surprisingly eclectic group.
The advanced developing countries of China and India are the two largest
producers, while industrial countries like Canada and Germany also boast
significant wheat production capabilities.

Wheat is measured in bushels for investment and accounting purposes. Each
bushel contains approximately 60 pounds of wheat. As with most other agri-
cultural commodities, metric tons are used to quantify total production and
consumption figures on a national and international basis.
The most direct way of accessing the wheat markets, short of owning a wheat
farm, is by trading the wheat futures contract. The Chicago Board of Trade
(CBOT) offers a futures contract for those interested in capturing profits from
wheat price movements — whether for hedging or speculative purposes.
Here are the specs for the CBOT futures contract:
 Contract ticker symbol: W
 Electronic ticker: ZW
 Contract size: 5,000 bushels
 Underlying commodity: Premium wheat
 Price fluctuation: $0.0025/bushel ($12.50 per contract)
 Trading hours: 9:30 a.m. to 1:15 p.m. open outcry; 6:32 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.
electronic (Chicago Time)
 Trading months: March, May, July, September, December
Wheat production, like that of corn and soybeans, is a seasonal enterprise
subject to various output disruptions. For instance, Kazakhstan, an important
producer, has faced issues with wheat production in the past due to underin-
vestment in machinery and the misuse of fertilizers. This mismanagement of
resources has an impact on the acreage yield, which in turn impacts prices.
Such supply side disruptions can have a magnified effect on futures prices.
To find out more about the wheat market, check out these sources: Wheat
Foods Council (www.wheatfoods.org), National Association of Wheat Growers
(www.wheatworld.org), and U.S. Wheat Associates (www.uswheat.org).
Masters of versatility: Soybeans
Soybeans are a vital crop for the world economy, used for everything from
poultry feedstock to the creation of vegetable oil. You can trade soybeans
themselves, soybean oil, and soybean meal.
To get more background information on the soybean industry, check out

Soybeans
Although most soybeans are used for the extraction of soybean oil (used as
vegetable oil for culinary purposes) and soybean meal (used primarily as an
agricultural feedstock), whole soybeans are also a tradable commodity.
Soybeans are edible, and if you’ve ever gone to a sushi restaurant you may
have been offered soybeans as appetizers, under the Japanese name
edamame.
The United States dominates the soybean market, accounting for more than
50 percent of total global production. Brazil is a distant second, with about 20
percent of the market. The crop in the United States begins in September, and
the production of soybeans is cyclical.
The most direct way for you to trade soybeans is through the Chicago Board
of Trade (CBOT) soybean futures contract:
 Contract ticker symbol: S
 Electronic ticker: ZS
 Contract size: 5,000 bushels
 Underlying commodity: Premium No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 yellow soybean
bushels
 Price fluctuation: $0.0025/bushel ($12.50 per contract)

Soybean oil
Soybean oil, more commonly known as vegetable oil, is an extract of soy-
beans. Soybean oil is the most widely used culinary oil in the United States
and around the world, partly because of its healthy, nutritional characteris-
tics. Soybean oil is also becoming an increasingly popular additive in alterna-
tive energy sources technology, such as biodiesel. An increasing number of
cars in the United States and abroad, for example, are being outfitted with
engines that allow them to convert from regular diesel to soybean oil during
operation.
Demand for soybean oil has increased in recent years as demand for these
cleaner-burning fuels increases and as the automotive technology is more
able to accommodate the usage of such biodiesels. According to the
Commodity Research Bureau (CRB), production of soybean oil increased
from an average of 15 billion pounds in the mid-1990s to more than 22 billion
pounds in 2003.

Making Money Trading Livestock
Like the tropical and grain commodities, livestock is a unique category in the
agricultural commodities sub-asset class. It’s not a widely followed area of
the commodities markets — unlike crude oil, for example, you’re not likely to
see feeder cattle prices quoted on the nightly news — but this doesn’t mean
you should ignore this area of the markets. That said, raising livestock is a time-
consuming and labor-intensive undertaking, and the markets are susceptible
and sensitive to minor disruption. This section covers the markets for cattle
(both live cattle and feeder cattle), lean hogs, and frozen pork bellies.
Even by agricultural futures standards, livestock futures are notoriously
volatile and should be traded only by traders with a high level of risk tolerance.
Keep in mind that trading agricultural futures requires an understanding of 
the cyclicality and seasonality of the underlying commodity as well as large
capital reserves to help offset any margin calls that may arise from a trade
gone bad. If your risk tolerance is not elevated or you are not comfortable in
the futures arena, then I recommend you don’t trade these contracts because
you could be setting yourself up for disastrous losses. Venture into this area
of the market only if you have an iron-clad grasp on the concepts behind
futures trading — and a high tolerance for risk.
One resource that provides fundamental data relating to the consumption
and production patterns of pork bellies, livestock, and other commodities is
the CRB Commodity Yearbook, compiled by the Commodity Research Bureau
(www.crbtrader.com). This book includes a large number of data on some of
the most important commodities, including the identification of seasonal and
cyclical patterns affecting the markets.
Staking a claim on cattle
Throughout the ages, cows have been valued not only for their dietary value,
but also their monetary worth. Cows are literally a special breed because
they are low maintenance animals with high products output: They eat almost
nothing but grass yet they are used to produce milk, provide meat, and, in
some cases, create leather goods. This input to output ratio means that cows
occupy a special place in the agricultural complex.
Two futures contracts exist for the cattle trader and investor: the live cattle
and the feeder cattle contracts, which both trade on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange (CME).

Chapter 6: Down on the Farm: Trading Agricultural Products

Live cattle
The live cattle futures contract is widely traded by various market players,
including cattle producers, packers, consumers, and independent traders.
Here are the specs of this futures contract:
 Contract ticker symbol: LC
 Electronic ticker: LE
 Contract size: 40,000 pounds
 Underlying commodity: Live cattle
 Price fluctuation: $0.00025/pound ($10.00 per contract)
 Trading hours: 9:05 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. (Chicago Time), electronic and
open outcry
 Trading months: February, April, June, August, October, December
One of the reasons for the popularity of the live cattle contract is that it
allows all interested parties to hedge their market positions in order to
reduce the volatility and uncertainty associated with livestock production in
general, and live cattle growing in particular.
If you do trade this contract, keep the following market risks in mind: seasonality,
fluctuating prices of feedstock, transportation costs, changing consumer
demand, and the threat of diseases (such as mad cow disease).
Feeder cattle
The feeder cattle contract is for calves that weigh in at the 650- to 849-pound
range, which are sent to the feedlots to get fed, fattened, and then slaughtered.
Because the CME feeder cattle futures contract is settled on a cash basis, the
CME calculates an index for feeder cattle cash prices based on a seven-day
average. This index, known in the industry as the CME Feeder Cattle Index, is
an average of feeder cattle prices from the largest feeder cattle producing
states in the United States, as compiled by the U.S. Department of Agriculture
(USDA). You can get information on the CME Feeder Cattle Index through the
CME Web site at www.cme.com.
To get livestock statistical information, you should check out the U.S.
Department of Agriculture’s statistical division. Its Web site is www.market

Seeking fat profits on lean hogs
The lean hog futures contract (which is a contract for the hog’s carcass)
trades on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and is used primarily by
producers of lean hogs — both domestic and international — and pork
importers/exporters. Here are the contract specs for lean hogs:
 Contract ticker symbol: LH
 Electronic ticker: HE
 Contract size: 40,000 pounds
 Underlying commodity: Lean hogs
 Price fluctuation: $0.0001 per hundred pounds ($4.00 per contract)
 Trading hours: 9:10 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. (Chicago Time), electronic and
open outcry
 Trading months: February, April, May, June, July, August, October,
December
Perhaps no other commodity, agricultural or otherwise, exhibits the same level
of volatility as the lean hogs futures contract (see Figure 6-1). One of the reasons
is that, compared to other products, this contract is not very liquid because it is
primarily used by commercial entities seeking to hedge against price risk. Other
commodities, say, crude oil, that are actively traded by individual speculators
as well the commercial entities are far more liquid and thus less volatile. If you
are intent on trading this contract, keep in mind that you’re up against some
very experienced and large players in this market.

Warming up to frozen pork bellies
Essentially, the term pork bellies is the traders’ way of saying “bacon.”
Physically, pork bellies come from the underside of a hog and weigh approxi-
mately 12 pounds. These pork bellies are generally stored frozen for
extended periods of time, pending delivery to consumers.
As with most other livestock products, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
offers a futures contract for frozen pork bellies. Here are the specs for the
CME frozen pork bellies futures contract:
 Contract ticker symbol: PB
 Electronic ticker: GPB
 Contract size: 40,000 pounds
 Underlying commodity: Pork bellies, cut and trimmed
 Price fluctuation: $0.0001/ pound ($4.00 per contract)
 Trading hours: 9:10 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. (Chicago Time), electronic and
open outcry
 Trading months: February, March, May, July, August

The pork bellies market is a seasonal market subject to wild price fluctuations.
Although production of pork bellies is a major determining factor of market
prices, other variables also have a significant impact on prices. A buildup in
pork belly inventories usually takes place in the beginning of the calendar year,
resulting in lower prices. But as inventories are depleted, the market moves to
a supply side bias, thereby placing upward pressure on market prices. On the
other side of the equation, consumer demand for bacon and other meats is not
easily predictable and fluctuates with the seasons. Because of the cyclicality of
the supply side model, coupled with the seasonality of the demand model,
pork belly prices are subject to extreme volatility. As a matter of fact, the pork
bellies futures contract is one of the more volatile contracts trading in the
market today.

T
he foreign exchange (forex) market was once the private
domain of hedge funds, global banks, multinational
corporations, and wealthy private investors. But this all
changed a few years ago when the revolution of online
trading spread to the forex markets. Today, tens of
thousands of individual traders and investors all over 
the world are discovering the excitement and challenges
of trading in the forex market.
No question about it, forex markets can be one of the
fastest and most volatile ﬁnancial markets to trade. Money
can be made or lost in a matter of seconds or minutes. At
the same time, currencies can display signiﬁcant trends
lasting several days to weeks and even years. This book
shows you how the forex market really works, what moves
it, and how you can actively trade it. It also provides the
tools you need to develop the structured game plan
required for trading in the forex market without losing
your shirt.

T
he foreign exchange (forex) market has exploded onto the scene and is
the hot new financial market. It’s been around for years, but advances in
electronic trading have made it available to individual traders on a scale
unimaginable just a few years ago. Because it’s relatively new, a lot of people
are still in the dark when it comes to exactly what the currency market is:
how it’s organized, who’s trading it, and what a trading day looks like when
the market never closes. This chapter sheds a bit of light on these topics.
What Is Currency Trading?
Currency trading is speculation, pure and simple. The securities you’re spec-
ulating with are the currencies of various countries. For that reason, currency
trading is both about the dynamics of market speculation, or trading, and the
factors that affect the value of currencies. Put them together and you’ve got
the largest, most dynamic, and most exciting financial market in the world.
Speculating is all about taking on financial risk in the hope of making a profit.
But it’s not gambling (playing with money even when you know the odds are
stacked against you) or investing (minimizing risk and maximizing return,
usually over a long time period). Speculating, or active trading, is about taking
calculated financial risks to attempt to realize a profitable return, usually over
a very short time horizon.

312
Book V: Foreign Currency Trading 
The forex market is the largest financial market in the world, at least in terms
of daily trading volumes. To be sure, the forex market is unique in many
respects:
 Because the volumes are huge, liquidity is ever present.
 The forex market operates around the clock six days a week, giving
traders access to the market any time they need it.
 Few trading restrictions exist — no daily trading limits up or down, no
restrictions on position sizes, and no requirements on selling a currency
pair short.
 There are anywhere from 15 to 20 different currency pairs — pitting the
U.S. dollar (USD) against other countries’ currencies or pitting two non-
USD currencies against each other — depending on which forex brokerage
you deal with. Chapter 2 discusses these pairs in detail.
 Most individual traders trade currencies via the Internet through a
brokerage firm. Online currency trading is typically done on a margin
basis, which allows individual traders to trade in larger amounts by
leveraging the amount of margin on deposit.
 The leverage, or margin trading ratios, can be very high, sometimes as
much as 200:1 or greater, meaning a margin deposit of $1,000 could
control a position size of $200,000. But trading on margin carries its own
rules and requirements and is the backdrop against which all your trading
will take place. See Chapter 4 for details.
Risk management is the key to any successful trading plan. Without a risk-
aware strategy, margin trading can be an extremely short-lived endeavor.
With a proper risk plan in place, you stand a much better chance of surviving
losing trades and making winning ones. You can find information on risk man-
agement in Chapter 4.
The Foreign Currency Market
Often called the forex market (or FX market), the foreign exchange market is
the largest and most liquid of all international financial markets. It’s the
crossroads for international capital, the intersection through which global
commercial and investment flows have to move. International trade flows,
such as when a Swiss electronics company purchases Japanese-made compo-
nents, were the original basis for the development of the forex markets.
Today, however, global financial and investment flows dominate trade as the
primary nonspeculative source of forex market volume. Whether it’s an
Australian pension fund investing in U.S. Treasury bonds, or a British insurer
allocating assets to the Japanese equity market, or a German conglomerate

purchasing a Canadian manufacturing facility, each cross-border transaction
passes through the forex market at some stage.
Firms such as FOREX.com, Saxo Bank, and MF Global have made the forex
market accessible to individual traders and investors. You can now trade the
same forex market as the big banks and hedge funds.
Entering the interbank market
When people talk about the “currency market,” they’re referring to the inter-
bank market, whether they realize it or not. The interbank market is where
the really big money changes hands. Minimum trade sizes are one million of
the base currency, such as €1 million of EUR/USD or $1 million of USD/JPY.
Much larger trades of between $10 million and $100 million are routine and can
go through the market in a matter of seconds. Even larger trades and orders
are a regular feature of the market. For the individual trading FX online, the
prices you see on your trading platform are based on the prices being traded in
the interbank market.
As the prefix suggests, the interbank market is “between banks,” with each
trade representing an agreement between the banks to exchange the agreed
amounts of currency at the specified rate on a fixed date. The interbank market
is alternately referred to as the cash market or the spot market to differentiate it
from the currency futures market, which is the only other organized market for
currency trading.
Currency futures markets operate alongside the interbank market, but they
are definitely the tail being wagged by the dog of the spot market. As a
market, currency futures are generally limited by exchange-based trading
hours and lower liquidity than is available in the spot market.
The interbank market developed without any significant governmental oversight
and remains largely unregulated. In most cases, there is no regulatory authority
for spot currency trading apart from local or national banking regulations.
The interbank market is a network of international banks operating in financial
centers around the world. Currency trading today is largely concentrated in
the hands of about a dozen major global financial firms, such as UBS, Deutsche
Bank, Citibank, JPMorgan Chase, Barclays, Goldman Sachs, and Royal Bank of
Scotland, to name just a few. Hundreds of other international banks and financial
institutions trade alongside the top banks, and all contribute liquidity and
market interest.

These banks maintain trading operations to facilitate speculation for their
own accounts, called proprietary trading (or prop trading for short), and to
provide currency trading services for their customers. Banks’ customers can
range from corporations and government agencies to hedge funds and
wealthy private individuals.
Trading in the interbank market
The interbank market is an over-the-counter (OTC) market, which means that
each trade is an agreement between the two counterparties to the trade. There
are no exchanges or guarantors for the trades, just each bank’s balance sheet
and the promise to make payment.
The bulk of spot trading in the interbank market is transacted through electronic
matching services, such as EBS and Reuters Dealing. Electronic matching ser-
vices allow traders to enter their bids and offers into the market, hit bids (sell at
the market), and pay offers (buy at the market). Price spreads vary by currency
pair and change throughout the day depending on market interest and volatility.
The matching systems have prescreened credit limits, and a bank will only
see prices available to it from approved counterparties. Pricing is anonymous
before a deal, meaning you can’t tell which bank is offering or bidding, but the
counterparties’ names are made known immediately after a deal goes through.
The rest of interbank trading is done through currency brokers, referred to as
voice brokers to differentiate them from the electronic ones. Traders can place
bids and offers with these brokers the same as they do with the electronic
matching services. Prior to the electronic matching services, voice brokers
were the primary market intermediaries between the banks.
Introducing currency pairs
Forex markets refer to trading currencies by pairs, with names that combine
the two different currencies being traded against each other, or exchanged
for one another. Additionally, forex markets have given most currency pairs
nicknames or abbreviations, which reference the pair and not necessarily the
individual currencies involved. The following sections give you a brief
overview of the currency pairs; go to Chapter 2 for in-depth information.
The bulk of spot currency trading, about 75 percent by volume, takes place in
the so-called major currencies. Trading in the major currencies is largely free
from government regulation and takes place outside the authority of any
national or international body. Trading in the currencies of smaller, less-
developed economies, such as Thailand or Chile, is often referred to as
314
Book V: Foreign Currency Trading 

emerging-market or exotic currency trading, and may involve currencies with
local restrictions on convertibility or limited liquidity, both of which limit
access and inhibit the development of an active market.
Major currency pairs
The major currency pairs all involve the U.S. dollar on one side of the deal.
The designations of the major currencies are expressed using International
Standardization Organization (ISO) codes for each currency. Table 1-1 lists
the most frequently traded currency pairs, what they’re called in conven-
tional terms, and what nicknames the market has given them.

Currency names and nicknames can be confusing when you’re following the
forex market or reading commentary and research. Be sure you understand
whether the writer or analyst is referring to the individual currency or the
currency pair.
 If a bank or a brokerage is putting out research suggesting that the Swiss
franc will weaken in the future, the comment refers to the individual
currency, in this case CHF, suggesting that USD/CHF will move higher
(USD stronger/CHF weaker).
 If the comment suggests that Swissy is likely to weaken going forward,
it’s referring to the currency pair and amounts to a forecast that
USD/CHF will move lower (USD weaker/CHF stronger).
Cross-currency pairs
A cross-currency pair (cross or crosses for short) is any currency pair that
does not include the U.S. dollar. Cross rates are derived from the respective
USD pairs but are quoted independently and usually with a narrower spread
than you could get by trading in the dollar pairs directly. (The spread refers
to the difference between the bid and offer, or the price at which you can sell
and buy. Spreads are applied in most financial markets.)
Cross trades can be especially effective when major cross-border mergers
and acquisitions (M&A) are announced. If a UK conglomerate is buying a
Canadian utility company, the UK company is going to need to sell GBP and
buy CAD to fund the purchase. The key to trading on M&A activity is to note
the cash portion of the deal. If the deal is all stock, you don’t need to
exchange currencies to come up with the foreign cash.
The most actively traded crosses focus on the three major non-USD curren-
cies (EUR, JPY, and GBP) and are referred to as euro crosses, yen crosses, and
sterling crosses. The remaining currencies (CHF, AUD, CAD, and NZD) are also
traded in cross pairs. Tables 1-2, 1-3, and 1-4 highlight the key cross pairs in
the euro, yen, and sterling groupings, respectively, along with their market
names. (Nicknames never quite caught on for the crosses.) Table 1-5 lists
other cross-currency pairs.

Identifying base and counter currencies
When you look at currency pairs, you may notice that the currencies are
combined in a seemingly strange order. For instance, if sterling-yen (GBP/JPY)
is a yen cross, why isn’t it referred to as “yen-sterling” and written “JPY/GBP”?
The answer is that these quoting conventions evolved over the years to
reflect traditionally strong currencies versus traditionally weak currencies,
with the strong currency coming first.
It also reflects the market quoting convention where the first currency in the
pair is known as the base currency. The base currency is what you’re buying
or selling when you buy or sell the pair. It’s also the notional, or face, amount
of the trade. So if you buy 100,000 EUR/JPY, you’ve just bought 100,000 euros
and sold the equivalent amount in Japanese yen. If you sell 100,000 GBP/CHF,
you just sold 100,000 British pounds and bought the equivalent amount of
Swiss francs.
The second currency in the pair is called the counter currency, or the sec-
ondary currency. Hey, who said this stuff isn’t intuitive? Most important for
you as an FX trader, the counter currency is the denomination of the price
fluctuations and, ultimately, what your profit and losses will be denominated
in. If you buy GBP/JPY, it goes up, and you take a profit, your gains are not in
pounds but in yen.
Getting Inside the Numbers
Average daily currency trading volumes exceed $2 trillion per day — a mind-
boggling number and a lot of zeros ($2,000,000,000,000) no matter how you
slice it. To give you some perspective on that size, it’s about 10 to 15 times
the size of daily trading volume on all the world’s stock markets combined.
That $2-trillion-a-day number, which you may have seen in the financial press
or other books on currency trading, actually overstates the size of what the
forex market is all about: spot currency trading.
What affects currency rates?
Information drives every financial market, but the forex market has its own
unique roster of information inputs. Many different cross-currents are at play
in the currency market at any given moment. After all, the forex market is set-
ting the value of one currency relative to another, so at the minimum, you’re
looking at the things affecting two major international economies. Add in half
a dozen or more other national economies, and you’ve got a serious amount
of information flowing through the market.
318
Book V: Foreign Currency Trading 

Fundamentals
Fundamentals, outlined in Chapter 3, are the broad grouping of news and
information that reflect the macroeconomic and political fortunes of the
countries whose currencies are traded. Most of the time, when you hear
someone talking about the fundamentals of a currency, he’s referring to the
economic fundamentals, which are based on economic data reports, interest
rate levels, monetary policy, international trade flows, and international
investment flows.
There are also political and geopolitical fundamentals. An essential element
of any currency’s value is the faith or confidence that the market places in
the value of the currency. If political events, such as an election or scandal,
are seen to be undermining the confidence in a nation’s leadership, the value
of its currency may be negatively affected.
Gathering and interpreting all this information is just part of a currency
trader’s daily routine.
Technicals
The term technicals refers to technical analysis, a form of market analysis most
commonly involving chart analysis, trend-line analysis, and mathematical studies
of price behavior, such as momentum or moving averages, to mention just a
couple. We don’t know of too many currency traders who don’t follow some
form of technical analysis in their trading. If you’ve been an active trader in
other financial markets, chances are you’ve engaged in some technical analysis
or at least heard of it.
If you’re not aware of technical analysis but you want to trade actively, we
strongly recommend that you familiarize yourself with some of its basics (see
Book VIII).
Technical analysis is especially important in the forex market because of the
amount of fundamental information hitting the market at any given time.
Currency traders regularly apply various forms of technical analysis to define
and refine their trading strategies, with many people trading based on techni-
cal indicators alone. (See Chapter 6 for how traders really use technicals.)
Something else
Many cross-currents are at play in the forex market at any given time. That
means that in addition to understanding the currency-specific fundamentals,
and familiarizing yourself with technical analysis, you also need to have an
appreciation of the market dynamics (see Chapter 4).

Liquidity in the currency market
The vast majority of currency trading volume is based on speculation:
traders buying and selling for short-term gains based on minute-to-minute,
hour-to-hour, and day-to-day price fluctuations. The depth and breadth of the
speculative market means that the liquidity of the overall forex market is
unparalleled among global financial markets.
From a trading perspective, liquidity is a critical consideration because it
determines how quickly prices move between trades and over time. A highly
liquid market like forex can see large trading volumes transacted with rela-
tively minor price changes. An illiquid, or thin, market will tend to see prices
move more rapidly on relatively lower trading volumes. A market that trades
only during certain hours (futures contracts, for example) also represents a
less liquid, thinner market. Liquidity, liquidity considerations, and market
interest are among the most important factors affecting how prices move, or
price action.
Although the forex market offers exceptionally high liquidity on an overall basis,
liquidity levels vary throughout the trading day and across various currency
pairs. For individual traders, variations in liquidity are more of a strategic
consideration than a tactical issue. For example, if a large hedge fund needs to
make a trade worth several hundred million dollars, it needs to be concerned
about the tactical levels of liquidity, such as how much its trade is likely to
move market prices depending on when the trade is executed. For individuals,
who generally trade in smaller sizes, the amounts are not an issue, but the
strategic levels of liquidity are an important factor in the timing of when and
how prices are likely to move.
Key Players
Participants in the forex market generally fall into one of two categories:
financial transactors and speculators. Financial transactors, including hedgers
and financial investors, are active in the forex market as part of their overall
business but not necessarily for currency reasons. (Don’t confuse hedgers
with hedge funds. Despite the name, a hedge fund is typically 100 percent
speculative in its investments; go to Book VI for details on hedge funds.)
Financial transactors are important to the forex market for several reasons:
 Their transactions can be extremely sizeable, typically hundreds of mil-
lion or billions.
 Their deals are frequently one-time events.
 They are generally not price sensitive or profit maximizing.
320
Book V: Foreign Currency Trading 

Speculators — hedge funds and day traders — are in it purely for the money.
In contrast to hedgers, who enter the market to neutralize or reduce risk and
have some form of existing currency market risk, speculators have no currency
risk until they enter the market, and they embrace risk-taking as a means of
profiting from long-term or short-term price movements.
The lion’s share of forex market turnover — upwards of 90 percent — comes
from speculators (specs for short), who are the ones that really make a market
efficient. They add liquidity to the market by infusing it with their views and,
more important, their capital. That liquidity is what smoothes out price move-
ments, keeps trading spreads narrow, and allows a market to expand.
The following sections look at all these main players.
Hedgers
Hedging is about eliminating or reducing risk. In financial markets, hedging
refers to a transaction designed to insure against an adverse price move in
some underlying asset. In the forex market, hedgers are looking to insure
themselves against an adverse price movement in a specific currency rate.
Say, for example, that you’re a widget maker in Germany and you just won a
large order from a UK-based manufacturer to supply it with a large quantity of
widgets. To make your bid more attractive, you agreed to be paid in British
pounds (GBP). But because your production cost base is denominated in
euros (EUR), you face the exchange rate risk that GBP will weaken against the
EUR, which would make the amount of GBP in the contract worth fewer EUR
back home, reducing or even eliminating your profit margin on the deal. To
insure, or hedge, against that possibility, you would seek to sell GBP against
EUR in the forex market. If the pound weakens against the euro, the value of
your market hedge will rise, compensating you for the lower value of the GBP
you’ll receive. If the pound strengthens against the euro, your loss on the
hedge is offset by gains in the currency conversions. (Each pound would be
worth more euros.)
Financial investors
Financial investors are the other main group of nonspeculative players in the
forex market. As far as the forex market is concerned, financial investors are
mostly just passing through on their way to other investments. More often
than not, financial investors look at currencies as an afterthought because
they’re more focused on the ultimate investment target, be it Japanese equities,
German government bonds, or French real estate.
321

When a company seeks to buy a foreign business, there can be a substantial for-
eign exchange implication from the trade. When large merge and acquisitions
(M&A) deals are announced, note the answers to the following two questions:
 Which countries and which currencies are involved? If a French elec-
trical utility buys an Austrian power company, there are no currency
implications because both countries use the euro (EUR). But if a Swiss
pharmaceutical company announces a takeover of a Dutch chemical
firm, the Swiss company may need to buy EUR and sell Swiss francs
(CHF) to pay for the deal.
 How much of the transaction will be in cash? Again, if it’s an all stock
deal, there are no forex market implications. But if the cash portion is
large, forex markets will take note and begin to speculate on the
currency pair involved.
Hedge funds
Hedge funds are a type of leveraged fund, which refers to any number of dif-
ferent forms of speculative asset management funds that borrow money for
speculation based on real assets under management. For instance, hedge
funds with $100 million under management can leverage those assets (through
margin agreements with their trading counterparties) to give them trading
limits of anywhere from $500 million to $2 billion. Hedge funds are subject to
the same type of margin requirements as you are, just with a whole lot more
zeroes involved.
The other main type of leveraged fund is known as a commodity trading advi-
sor (CTA). A CTA is principally active in the futures markets. But because the
forex market operates around the clock, CTAs frequently trade spot FX as well.
In the forex market, leveraged funds can hold positions anywhere from a few
hours to days or weeks. When you hear that leveraged names are buying or
selling, it’s an indication of short-term speculative interest that can provide
clues as to where prices are going in the near future.
Day-traders, big and small
This is where you fit into the big picture of the forex market. If the vast major-
ity of currency trading volume is speculative in nature, then most of that
speculation is short-term in nature. Short-term can be minute-to-minute or hour-
to-hour, but rarely is it longer than a day or two. From the interbank traders
who are scalping EUR/USD (high frequency in-and-out trading for few pips —
the smallest price increments in the currency) to the online trader looking for
the next move in USD/JPY, short-term day-traders are the backbone of the
market.
322
Book V: Foreign Currency Trading 

Intraday trading was always the primary source of interbank market liquidity,
providing fluid prices and an outlet for any institutional flows that hit the
market. Day-traders tend to be focused on the next 20 to 30 pips in the
market, which makes them the source of most short-term price fluctuations.
Around the World in a Trading Day
The forex market is open and active 24 hours a day from the start of business
hours on Monday morning in the Asia-Pacific time zone straight through to
the Friday close of business hours in New York. At any given moment,
depending on the time zone, dozens of global financial centers — such as
Sydney, Tokyo, and London — are open, and currency trading desks in those
financial centers are active in the market.
In addition to the major global financial centers, many financial institutions
operate 24-hour-a-day currency trading desks, providing an ever-present
source of market interest. It may be a U.S. hedge fund in Boston that needs to
monitor currencies around the clock, or it may be a major international bank
with a concentrated global trading operation in one financial center.
Currency trading doesn’t even stop for holidays when other financial markets,
like stocks or futures exchanges, may be closed. Even though it’s a holiday in
Japan, for example, Sydney, Singapore, and Hong Kong may still be open. It
may be the Fourth of July in the United States, but if it’s a business day, Tokyo,
London, Toronto, and other financial centers will still be trading currencies.
About the only holiday in common around the world is New Year’s Day, and
even that depends on what day of the week it falls on.
Opening the trading week
There is no officially designated starting time to the trading day or week, but
for all intents the market action kicks off when Wellington, New Zealand, the
first financial center west of the international dateline, opens on Monday
morning local time. Depending on whether daylight saving time is in effect in
your own time zone, it roughly corresponds to early Sunday afternoon in North
America, Sunday evening in Europe, and very early Monday morning in Asia.
The Sunday open represents the starting point where currency markets
resume trading after the Friday close of trading in North America (5 p.m.
eastern time [ET]). This is the first chance for the forex market to react to
news and events that may have happened over the weekend. Prices may have
closed New York trading at one level, but depending on the circumstances,
they may start trading at different levels at the Sunday open. The risk that
323

Book V

currency prices open at different levels on Sunday versus their close on
Friday is referred to as the weekend gap risk or the Sunday open gap risk. A
gap is a change in price levels where no prices are tradable in between.
As a strategic trading consideration, you need to be aware of the weekend
gap risk and know what events are scheduled over the weekend. There’s no
fixed set of potential events, and there’s never any way of ruling out what may
transpire, such as a terror attack, a geopolitical conflict, or a natural disaster.
You just need to be aware that the risk exists and factor it into your trading
strategy. Of typical scheduled weekend events, the most common are quar-
terly Group of Seven (G7) meetings and national elections or referenda. Just
be sure you’re aware of any major events that are scheduled.
On most Sunday opens, prices generally pick up where they left off on Friday
afternoon. The opening price spreads in the interbank market will be much
wider than normal, because only Wellington and 24-hour trading desks are
active at the time. Opening price spreads of 10 to 30 points in the major
currency pairs are not uncommon in the initial hours of trading. When banks
in Sydney, Australia, and other early Asian centers enter the market over the
next few hours, liquidity begins to improve and price spreads begin to
narrow to more normal levels.
Because of the wider price spreads in the initial hours of the Sunday open,
most online trading platforms do not begin trading until 5 p.m. ET on Sundays,
when sufficient liquidity enables the platforms to offer their normal price
quotes. Make sure you’re aware of your broker’s trading policies with regard
to the Sunday open, especially in terms of order executions.
Trading in the Asia-Pacific session
The principal financial trading centers in the Asia-Pacific session are
Wellington, New Zealand; Sydney, Australia; Tokyo, Japan; Hong Kong; and
Singapore. In terms of the most actively traded currency pairs, that means
news and data reports from New Zealand, Australia, and Japan are going to
be hitting the market during this session. New Zealand and Australian data
reports are typically released in the early morning local time, which corre-
sponds to early evening hours in North America. Japanese data is typically
released just before 9 a.m. Tokyo time, which equates to roughly 7 or 8 p.m.
ET. Some Japanese data reports and events also take place in the Tokyo after-
noon, which equates to roughly midnight to 4 a.m. ET.
The overall trading direction for the NZD, AUD, and JPY can be set for the
entire session depending on what news and data reports are released and
what they indicate. In addition, news from China, such as interest rate
changes and official comments or currency policy adjustments, may also be
released. Occasionally as well, late speakers from the United States, such as
324
Book V: Foreign Currency Trading 

Federal Reserve officials speaking on the West Coast of the United States,
may offer remarks on the U.S. economy or the direction of U.S. interest rates
that affect the value of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies.
Because of the size of the Japanese market and the importance of Japanese
data to the market, much of the action during the Asia-Pacific session is
focused on the Japanese yen currency pairs, such as USD/JPY and the JPY
crosses, like EUR/JPY and AUD/JPY. Of course, Japanese financial institutions
are also most active during this session, so you can frequently get a sense of
what the Japanese market is doing based on price movements.
Trading in the European/London session
About midway through the Asian trading day, European financial centers
begin to open up and the market gets into its full swing. The European session
overlaps with half of the Asian trading day and half of the North American
trading session, which means that market interest and liquidity is at its
absolute peak during this session.
News and data events from the Eurozone (and individual countries like
Germany and France), Switzerland, and the United Kingdom are typically
released in the early-morning hours of the European session. As a result,
some of the biggest moves and most active trading take place in the European
currencies (EUR, GBP, and CHF) and the euro cross-currency pairs (EUR/CHF
and EUR/GBP).
Asian trading centers begin to wind down in the late-morning hours of the
European session, and North American financial centers come in a few hours
later, around 7 a.m. ET.
Trading in the North American session
Because of the overlap between North American and European trading ses-
sions, the trading volumes are much more significant. Some of the biggest
and most meaningful directional price movements take place during this
crossover period.
The North American morning is when key U.S. economic data is released and
the forex market makes many of its most significant decisions on the value of
the U.S. dollar. Most U.S. data reports are released at 8:30 a.m. ET, with others
coming out between 9 and 10 a.m. ET. Canadian data reports are also released
in the morning, usually between 7 and 9 a.m. ET. There are also a few U.S.
economic reports that variously come out at noon or 2 p.m. ET, livening up
the New York afternoon market.
325

London and the European financial centers begin to wind down their daily
trading operations around noon eastern time each day. The London close (or
European close, as it’s known) can frequently generate volatile flurries of
activity.
On most days, market liquidity and interest fall off significantly in the New
York afternoon, which can make for challenging trading conditions. On quiet
days, the generally lower market interest typically leads to stagnating price
action. On more active days, when prices may have moved more significantly,
the lower liquidity can spark additional outsized price movements, as fewer
traders scramble to get similarly fewer prices and liquidity. Lower liquidity
and the potential for increased volatility are most evident in the least-liquid
major-currency pairs, especially USD/CHF and GBP/USD.
North American trading interest and volume generally continue to wind down
as the trading day moves toward the 5 p.m. New York close, which also sees
the change in value dates take place. (See Chapter 3 for more on rollovers
and value dates.) But during the late New York afternoon, Wellington and
Sydney have reopened and a new trading day has begun.
Noting key daily times and events
In addition to the ebb and flow of liquidity and market interest during the
global currency trading day, you need to be aware of the following daily
events, which tend to occur around the same times each day.
Expiring options
Currency options are typically set to expire either at the Tokyo expiry (3 p.m.
Tokyo time) or the New York expiry (10 a.m. ET). The New York option expiry
is the more significant one, because it tends to capture both European and
North American option market interest. When an option expires, the underlying
option ceases to exist. Any hedging in the spot market that was done based on
the option being alive suddenly needs to be unwound, which can trigger signifi-
cant price changes in the hours leading up to and just after the option expiry
time.
Setting the rate at currency fixings
There are several daily currency fixings in various financial centers, but the
two most important are the 8:55 a.m. Tokyo time and the 4 p.m. London time
fixings. A currency fixing is a set time each day when the prices of currencies
for commercial transactions are set, or fixed.
326
Book V: Foreign Currency Trading 

From a trading standpoint, these fixings may see a flurry of trading in a
particular currency pair in the run-up (generally 15 to 30 minutes) to the
fixing time that abruptly ends exactly at the fixing time. A sharp rally in a
specific currency pair on fixing-related buying, for example, may suddenly
come to an end at the fixing time and see the price quickly drop back to
where it was before.
Squaring up on the currency futures markets
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), one of the largest futures markets
in the world, offers currency futures through its International Monetary
Market (IMM) subsidiary exchange. Daily currency futures trading closes each
day on the IMM at 2 p.m. central time (CT), which is 3 p.m. ET. Many futures
traders like to square up or close any open positions at the end of each trad-
ing session to limit their overnight exposure or for margin requirements.
The 30 to 45 minutes leading up to the IMM closing occasionally generate a
flurry of activity that spills over into the spot market. Because the amount of
liquidity in the spot currency market is at its lowest in the New York after-
noon, sharp movements in the futures markets can drive the spot market
around this time.

 Looking at the trading fundamentals of the major currency pairs
 Getting to know the small dollar pairs: USD/CAD, AUD/USD, and NZD/USD
 Finding opportunities in cross-currency trading
 Modifying trading strategies to fit the currency pair
T
he vast majority of trading volume takes place in the major currency
pairs: EUR/USD, USD/JPY, GBP/USD, and USD/CHF. These currency pairs
account for about two-thirds of daily trading volume in the market and are
the most watched barometers of the overall forex market. When you hear
about the dollar rising or falling, it’s usually referring to the dollar against
these other currencies.
Of course, speculative trading opportunities extend well beyond just the four
major dollar pairs (currency pairs that include the USD). For starters, three
other currency pairs — commonly known as the minor or small dollar pairs —
round out the primary trading pairs that include the USD. Then there are the
cross-currency pairs, or crosses for short, which pit two non-USD currencies
against each other.
This chapter takes a closer look at the major and minor dollar pairs and
cross-currency pairs to show how they fit into the overall market. You can
also find an additional array of speculative trading opportunities. Although
the USD is frequently the driving force in the currency market, you’re going to
want to know where the opportunities are when the spotlight isn’t on the
greenback.
The Big Dollar: EUR/USD
EUR/USD is by far the most actively traded currency pair in the global forex
market. Everyone and his brother, sister, and cousin trades EUR/USD. The
same can be said for the big banks. Every major trading desk has at least one,
and probably several, EUR/USD traders. All those EUR/USD traders add up to
vast amounts of market interest, which increases overall trading liquidity.

330
Book V: Foreign Currency Trading 
EUR/USD is the currency pair that pits the U.S. dollar against the single cur-
rency of the Eurozone, the euro. The Eurozone refers to a grouping of coun-
tries in the European Union (EU); as of this printing, they are Austria,
Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia, and Spain. All together, the Eurozone consti-
tutes a regional economic bloc roughly equal to the United States in both
population and total GDP.
Trading fundamentals of EUR/USD
Standard market convention is to quote EUR/USD in terms of the number of
USD per EUR. For example, a EUR/USD rate of 1.3000 means that it takes $1.30
to buy €1.
EUR/USD trades inversely to the overall value of the USD, which means 
when EUR/USD goes up, the euro is getting stronger and the dollar weaker. When
EUR/USD goes down, the euro is getting weaker and the dollar stronger. If you
believed the U.S. dollar was going to move higher, you’d be looking to sell
EUR/USD. If you thought the dollar was going to weaken, you’d be looking to
buy EUR/USD.
EUR/USD has the euro as the base currency and the U.S. dollar as the
secondary or counter currency. That means
 EUR/USD is traded in amounts denominated in euros. In online
currency trading platforms, standard lot sizes are €100,000, and mini lot
sizes are €10,000.
 The pip value, or minimum price fluctuation, is denominated in USD.
 Profit and loss accrue in USD. For one standard lot position size, each
pip is worth $10; for one mini lot position size, each pip is worth $1.
 Margin calculations in online trading platforms are typically based in
USD. At a EUR/USD rate of 1.3000, to trade a one-lot position worth
€100,000, it’ll take $1,300 in available margin (based on 100:1 leverage).
That calculation will change over time, of course, based on the level of
the EUR/USD exchange rate. A higher EUR/USD rate will require more
USD in available margin collateral, and a lower EUR/USD rate will need
less USD in margin.
Having a sense of which currency is driving EUR/USD at any given moment is
important so you can better adapt to incoming data and news. If it’s a EUR-
based move higher, for instance, and surprisingly positive USD news or data
is released later in the day, guess what? You’ve got countertrend information
hitting the market, which could spark a reversal lower in EUR/USD (in favor
of the dollar). By the same token, if that U.S. data comes out weaker than
expected, it’s likely to spur further EUR/USD gains, because EUR-buying inter-
est is now combined with USD-selling interest.

Swimming in deep liquidity
Liquidity in EUR/USD is unmatched by other major currency pairs. This is
most evident in the narrower trading spreads regularly available in EUR/USD.
Normal market spreads are typically around 2 to 3 pips versus 3 to 5 pips in
other major currency pairs.
The euro also serves as the primary foil to the U.S. dollar when it comes to
speculating on the overall direction of the U.S. dollar in response to U.S. news
or economic data. If weak U.S. economic data is reported, traders are typi-
cally going to sell the dollar, which begs the question, “Against what?” The
euro is the first choice for many, simply because it’s there. It also helps that
it’s the most liquid alternative, allowing for easy entry and exit.
This is not to say that EUR/USD reacts only to U.S. economic data or news.
On the contrary, Eurozone news and data can move EUR/USD as much as U.S.
data moves the pair. But the overall tendency still favors U.S. data and news
as the driving force of short-term price movements.
Watching the data reports
Here’s a list of the major European data reports and events to keep an eye on:
 European Central Bank (ECB) interest rate decisions and press conferences
after ECB Central Council meetings
 Speeches by ECB officials and individual European finance ministers
 EU-harmonized consumer price index (CPI), as well as national CPI and
producer price index (PPI) reports
 EU Commission economic sector confidence indicators
 Consumer and investor sentiment surveys separately issued by three
private economic research firms known by their acronyms: Ifo, ZEW, and
GfK
 Industrial production
 Retail sales
 Unemployment rate

Trading behavior of EUR/USD
The deep liquidity and tight trading spreads in EUR/USD make the pair ideal
for both shorter-term and longer-term traders. The price action behavior in
EUR/USD regularly exhibits a number of traits you should be aware of.
Trading tick by tick
In normal market conditions, EUR/USD tends to trade tick by tick, as opposed
to other currency pairs, which routinely display sharper short-term price
movements of several pips. In trading terms, if EUR/USD is trading at
1.2910/13, there are going to be traders looking to sell at 13, 14, and 15 and
higher, while buyers are waiting to buy at 9, 8, 7 and lower.
Fewer price jumps and smaller price gaps
The depth of liquidity in EUR/USD also reduces the number of price jumps or
price gaps in short-term trading. A price jump refers to a quick movement in
prices over a relatively small distance (roughly 10 to 20 pips) in the course of
normal trading. A price gap means prices have instantaneously adjusted over
a larger price distance, typically in response to a news event or data release.
Price jumps/gaps do occur in EUR/USD, as anyone who has traded around
data reports or other news events can attest. But price jumps/gaps in
EUR/USD tend to be generated primarily by news/data releases and breaks of
significant technical levels, events which can usually be identified in advance.
Backing and filling
When it comes to EUR/USD price action, backing and filling, in which prices
moving rapidly in one direction tend to reach a short-term stopping point
when opposite interest enters the market, is quite common. It tends to be
more substantial than in most currency pairs, meaning a greater amount of
the directional move is retraced. Look at Figure 2-1 to get a visual idea of
what backing and filling looks like. When EUR/USD is not backing and filling
the way you would expect, it means the directional move is stronger and with
greater interest behind it.
Prolonged tests of technical levels
When it comes to trading around technical support and resistance levels,
EUR/USD can try the patience of even the most disciplined traders because
EUR/USD can spend tens of minutes (an eternity in forex markets) or even
several hours undergoing tests of technical levels. (See Book VIII for a primer
on technical analysis.) This goes back to the tremendous amount of interest
and liquidity that defines the EUR/USD market. All those viewpoints come
together in the form of market interest (bids and offers) when technical
levels come into play. The result is a tremendous amount of market interest
that has to be absorbed at technical levels, which can take time.
332
Book V: Foreign Currency Trading

Looking at GBP/USD and USD/CHF as leading indicators
Given the tremendous two-way interest in EUR/USD, it can be very difficult to
gauge whether a test of a technical level is going to lead to a breakout or a
rejection. To get an idea of whether a test of a technical level in EUR/USD is
going to lead to a break, professional EUR/USD traders always keep an eye on
GBP/USD and USD/CHF, as they tend to be leading indicators for the bigger
EUR/USD and dollar moves in general.
If GBP/USD and USD/CHF are aggressively testing (trading at or through the
technical level with very little pullback) similar technical levels to EUR/USD
(for example, daily highs or equivalent trend-line resistance), then EUR/USD
is likely to test that same level. If GBP/USD and USD/CHF break through their
technical levels, the chances of EUR/USD following suit increase. By the same
token, if GBP/USD and USD/CHF are not aggressively testing the key technical
level, EUR/USD is likely to see its similar technical level hold.

GBP/USD and USD/CHF lead times can be anywhere from a few seconds or
minutes to several hours and even days. Just make sure you’re looking at the
equivalent technical levels in each pair.
EUR/USD trading considerations
The preceding sections look at the major trading attributes of EUR/USD. This
section looks at how those elements translate into real-life trading tactics.
After all, that’s where the real money is made and lost.
Being patient in EUR/USD
Earlier in this chapter we explore why EUR/USD can spend hours trading in
relatively narrow ranges or testing technical levels. The key in such markets
is to remain patient based on your directional view and your technical analy-
sis. You should be able to identify short-term support that keeps an upside
test alive or resistance that keeps a down-move going. If those levels fail, the
move is stalling at the minimum and may even be reversing.
Taking advantage of backing and filling
Because EUR/USD tends to retrace more of its short-term movements, you
can usually enter a position in your desired direction by leaving an order to
buy or sell at slightly better rates than current market prices may allow. If the
post–08:30 ET U.S. data price action sees EUR/USD move lower, and you think
getting short is the way to go, you can leave an offer slightly (roughly 5 to 10
pips) above the current market level and use it to get short, instead of reach-
ing out and hitting the bid on a down-tick.
If your order is executed, you’ve got your desired position at a better rate
than if you went to market, and you’re probably in a better position rhythm-
wise with the market (having sold on an up-tick). Alternatively, you can take
advantage of routine backing and filling by dealing at the market by selling on
up-ticks and buying on down-ticks.
Allowing for a margin of error on technical levels
When it comes to determining whether EUR/USD has broken a technical level,
use a 10- to 15-pip margin of error. (Shorter-term traders may want to use a
smaller margin of error.) Some very short-term traders and technical purists
like to pinpoint an exact price level as support or resistance. If the market
trades above or below their level, they’ll call it a break and that’s that. But
the spot forex market rarely trades with such respect for technical levels to
make such a clear and pinpointed distinction. And given the amount of inter-
est in EUR/USD, it’s especially prone to hazy technical lines in the sand.
334
Book V: Foreign Currency Trading 

The key point to take away from this is that all sorts of interest emerges
around technical levels, and it’s still going through the market even though
the pinpointed level may have been breached. And this is where our margin
of error comes in. Again, it’s not a hard and fast rule, but generally speaking,
EUR/USD will have chewed through most of the market interest around a
technical level within about 10 to 15 points beyond the level.
East Meets West: USD/JPY
USD/JPY is one of the more challenging currency pairs among the majors.
Where other currency pairs typically display routine market fluctuations and
relatively steady, active trading interest, USD/JPY seems to have an on/off
switch. It can spend hours and even days in relatively narrow ranges and
then march off on a mission to a new price level. The key to developing a suc-
cessful trading game plan in USD/JPY is to understand what drives the pair
and the how price action behaves.
Trading fundamentals of USD/JPY
The Japanese yen is the third major international currency after the U.S.
dollar and the European single currency, the euro. USD/JPY accounts for 17
percent of daily global trading volume, according to the 2004 Bank for
International Settlements (BIS) survey of foreign exchange markets. Japan
stands as the second largest national economy after the United States in
terms of GDP.
Standard market convention is to quote USD/JPY in terms of the number of
JPY per USD. For example, a USD/JPY rate of 115.35 means that it takes
¥115.35 to buy $1.
USD/JPY trades in the same direction as the overall value of the USD, and
inversely to the value of the JPY. If the USD is strengthening and the JPY is
weakening, the USD/JPY rate will move higher. If the USD is weakening and
the JPY is strengthening, the USD/JPY rate will move lower.
USD/JPY has the U.S. dollar as the base currency and the JPY as the sec-
ondary or counter currency. This means
 USD/JPY is traded in amounts denominated in USD. In online currency
trading platforms, standard lot sizes are $100,000, and mini lot sizes are
$10,000.
 The pip value, or minimum price fluctuation, is denominated in JPY.
335
Chapter 2: Major and Minor Currency Pairs
Book V
Foreign
Currency
Trading

 Profit and loss accrue in JPY. For one standard lot position size, each
pip is worth ¥1,000; for one mini lot position size, each pip is worth
¥100. To convert those amounts to USD, divide the JPY amount by the
USD/JPY rate. Using 115.00 as the rate, ¥1,000 = $8.70 and ¥100 = $0.87
 Margin calculations are typically calculated in USD. So it’s a straightfor-
ward calculation using the leverage rate to see how much margin is
required to hold a position in USD/JPY. At 100:1 leverage, $1,000 of avail-
able margin is needed to open a standard-size position of 100,000 USD/JPY.
It’s politically sensitive to trade
USD/JPY is the most politically sensitive currency pair among the majors.
Japan remains a heavily export-oriented economy, accounting for more than
40 percent of overall economic activity. This means the JPY is a critical policy
lever for Japanese officials to stimulate and manage the Japanese economy —
and they aren’t afraid to get involved in the market to keep the JPY from
strengthening beyond desired levels.
The Japanese Ministry of Finance (MOF) engages in routine verbal interven-
tion in not-so-subtle attempts to influence the level of the JPY. The chief
spokesman on currencies is, of course, the Minister of Finance, but the Vice
Finance Minister for International Affairs is the more frequent commentator
on forex market developments.
The Japanese financial press devotes a tremendous amount of attention to
the value of the JPY, similar to how the U.S. financial media cover the Dow or
S&P 500. Press briefings by MOF officials are routine. During times of forex
market volatility, expect near-daily official comments. These statements
move USD/JPY on a regular basis.
The MOF has also been known to utilize covert intervention through the use
of sizeable market orders by the pension fund of the Japanese Postal Savings
Bank, known as Kampo. This is sometimes referred to as semiofficial interven-
tion in various market commentaries.
JPY as a proxy for other Asian currencies
The JPY is sometimes considered a proxy for other Asian currencies that are
not freely convertible or have poor liquidity or other trading restrictions,
such as the Korean won, Chinese yuan, or Taiwan dollar. Speculation that the
Chinese government would revalue (strengthen) the Chinese yuan relative to
the USD in early 2005 led to speculation that the JPY would also strengthen.
336
Book V: Foreign Currency Trading 

Japanese asset managers tend to move together
If Americans are the ultimate consumers, the Japanese are the consummate
savers. The Japanese savings rate (the percentage of disposable income
that’s not spent) is around 15 percent. (Compare that with the U.S. savings
rate at around –1 percent!) As a result, Japanese financial institutions control
trillions of dollars in assets, many of which find their way to investments out-
side of Japan. The bulk of assets are invested in fixed income securities, and
this means Japanese asset managers are on a continual hunt for the best
yielding returns.
This theme has taken on added prominence in recent years due to extremely
low domestic yields in Japan. The continual off-shoring of JPY-denominated
assets leads to continual selling of JPY to buy the currencies of the ultimate
investment destination. This makes domestic interest-rate yields in Japan a
key long-term determinant of the JPY’s value.
Japanese financial institutions also tend to pursue a highly collegial approach
to investment strategies. The result for forex markets is that Japanese asset
managers tend to pursue similar investment strategies at the same time,
resulting in tremendous asset flows hitting the market over a relatively short
period of time. This situation has important implications for USD/JPY price
action (see the section “Price action behavior of USD/JPY”).
Important Japanese data reports
The key data reports to focus on coming out of Japan are

Price action behavior of USD/JPY
As noted earlier, USD/JPY seems to have an on/off switch when compared to
the other major currency pairs. Add to that the fact that USD/JPY liquidity
can be similarly fickle. Sometimes, hundreds of millions of USD/JPY can be
bought or sold without moving the market noticeably; other times, liquidity
can be extremely scarce. This phenomenon is particularly acute in USD/JPY
owing to the large presence of Japanese asset managers. The Japanese
investment community tends to move en masse into and out of positions. Of
course, they’re not the only ones involved in USD/JPY, but they do tend to
play the fox while the rest of the market is busy playing the hounds.
Prone to short-term trends, followed by sideways consolidations
The result of this concentration of Japanese corporate interest is a strong
tendency for USD/JPY to display short-term trends (several hours to several
days) in price movements, as investors pile in on the prevailing directional
move. This tendency is amplified by the use of standing market orders from
Japanese asset managers.
For example, if a Japanese pension fund manager is looking to establish a
long position in USD/JPY, he’s likely to leave orders at several fixed levels
below the current market to try to buy dollars on dips. If the current market
is at 116.00, he may buy a piece of the total position there, but then leave
orders to buy the remaining amounts at staggered levels below, such as
115.75, 115.50, 115.25, and 115.00. If other investors are of the same view,
they’ll be bidding below the market as well.
If the market begins to move higher, the asset managers may become ner-
vous that they won’t be able to buy on weakness and raise their orders to
higher levels, or buy at the market. Either way, buying interest is moving up
with the price action, creating a potentially accelerating price movement.
Any countertrend move is met by solid buying interest and quickly reversed.
Such price shifts tend to reach their conclusion when everyone is onboard —
most of the buyers who wanted to buy are now long. At this point, no more
fresh buying is coming into the market, and the directional move begins to
stall and move sideways. The early buyers may be capping the market with
profit-taking orders to sell above, while laggard buyers are still buying on
dips. This leads to the development of a consolidation range, which can be as
wide as ¥1 or ¥2, or as narrow as 40 to 50 pips.
Short-term traders can usually find trading opportunities in such consolida-
tion ranges, but medium- and longer-term traders may want to step back and
wait for a fresh directional movement.

Technical levels are critical in USD/JPY
If you’re a regular trader or investor and you don’t work at a Japanese bank,
you can tell where the orders are by focusing on the technical levels. Perhaps
no other currency pair is as beholden to technical support and resistance as
USD/JPY. In large part, this has to do with the prevalence of substantial
orders, where the order level is based on technical analysis. USD/JPY dis-
plays a number of other important trading characteristics when it comes to
technical trading levels:
 USD/JPY tends to respect technical levels with far fewer false breaks.
 USD/JPY’s price action is usually highly directional (one-way traffic) on
breaks of technical support and resistance.
 Spike reversals (sharp — 20- to 50-pip — price movements in the oppo-
site direction of the prior move) from technical levels are relatively
common.
 Orders frequently define intraday highs and lows and reversal points
(see Figure 2-2).

USD/JPY trading considerations
USD/JPY’s tendency is to either be active directionally or consolidating — the
on/off switch. A good way to approach USD/JPY is on a more strategic, hit-
and-run basis — getting in when you think a directional move is happening
and standing aside when you don’t. Look for breaks of trend lines, spike
reversals, and candlestick patterns as your primary clues for spotting a pend-
ing directional move.
Actively trading trend-line and price-level breakouts
One trigger point for jumping into USD/JPY is breaks of trend lines and key
price levels, such as daily or weekly highs/lows. It usually takes a significant
amount of market interest to break key technical levels. So look at the actual
breaks as concrete evidence of sizeable interest, rather than normal back-
and-forth price action.
Jumping on spike reversals
After USD/JPY has seen a relatively quick (usually within two to three hours)
move of more than 70 to 80 pips in one direction, be on the lookout for any
sharp reversals in price. Spike reversals of 30 to 40 pips that occur in very
short timeframes (5 to 20 minutes) are relatively common in USD/JPY. But
you pretty much have to be in front of your trading screen to take advantage
of these, because they’re a short-term phenomenon by their very nature.
Monitoring EUR/JPY and other JPY crosses
USD/JPY is heavily influenced by cross flows and can frequently take a back
seat to them on any given day. In evaluating USD/JPY, always keep an eye on
the JPY crosses and their technical levels as well. A break of important sup-
port in GBP/JPY, for instance, could unleash a flood of short-term USD/JPY
selling, because GBP/JPY is mostly traded through the dollar pairs.
EUR/JPY is the most actively traded JPY cross, and its movements routinely
drive USD/JPY on an intraday basis. Be alert for when significant technical
levels in the two pairs coincide, such as when both USD/JPY and EUR/JPY are
testing a series of recent daily highs or lows. A break by either can easily spill
into the other and provoke follow-through buying/selling in both.

The Other Majors: GBP/USD 
and USD/CHF
GBP/USD (affectionately known as sterling or cable) and USD/CHF (called
Swissy by market traders) are counted as major currency pairs, but their
trading volume and liquidity are significantly less than EUR/USD or USD/JPY.
As a result, their trading characteristics are very similar to each other.
The British pound: GBP/USD
Trading in cable presents its own set of challenges, because the pair is prone
to sharp price movements and seemingly chaotic price action. But it’s exactly
this type of price behavior that keeps the speculators coming back — when
you’re right, you’ll know very quickly, and the short-term results can be 
significant.
Trading fundamentals of GBP/USD
The UK economy is the second largest national economy in Europe, after
Germany, and the pound is heavily influenced by cross-border trade and
mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity between the United Kingdom and
continental Europe. Upwards of two-thirds of UK foreign trade is conducted
with EU member states, making the EUR/GBP cross one of the most impor-
tant trade-driven cross rates.
The 2004 BIS survey of foreign exchange turnover showed that GBP/USD
accounted for 14 percent of global daily trading volume, making cable the
third most active pairing in the majors. But you may not believe that when
you start trading cable, where liquidity seems always to be at a premium.
Relatively lower liquidity is most evident in the larger bid-offer spread, which
is usually 3 to 5 pips compared to 2 to 4 pips in EUR/USD and USD/JPY.
GBP/USD is quoted in terms of the number of dollars it takes to buy a pound,
so a rate of 1.8515 means it costs $1.8515 to buy £1. The GBP is the primary
currency in the pair and the USD is the secondary currency. That means
 GBP/USD is traded in amounts denominated in GBP. In online currency
trading platforms, standard lot sizes are £100,000, and mini lot sizes are
£10,000.
 The pip value, or minimum price fluctuation, is denominated in USD.
 Profit and loss accrue in USD. For one standard lot position size, each
pip is worth $10; for one mini lot position size, each pip is worth $1.

 Margin calculations are typically calculated in USD in online trading
platforms. Because of its high relative value to the USD, trading in GBP
pairs requires the greatest amount of margin on a per-lot basis. At a
GBP/USD rate of 1.9000, to trade a one-lot position worth £100,000, it’ll take
$1,900 in available margin (based on 100:1 leverage). That calculation will
change over time, of course, based on the level of the GBP/USD exchange
rate. A higher GBP/USD rate will require more USD in available margin col-
lateral, and a lower GBP/USD rate will need less USD in margin.
Trading alongside EUR/USD, but with a lot more zip!
Cable is similar to the EUR/USD in that it trades inversely to the overall USD,
except that it exhibits much more abrupt volatility and more extreme overall
price movements. If U.S. economic news disappoints, for instance, both ster-
ling and EUR/USD will move higher. But if EUR/USD sees a 60-point rally on
the day, cable may see a 100+ point rally.
This goes back to liquidity and a generally lower level of market interest in
cable. In terms of daily global trading sessions (see Chapter 1), cable volume
is at its peak during the UK/European trading day, but that level of liquidity
shrinks considerably in the New York afternoon and Asian trading sessions.
During those off-peak times, cable can see significant short-term price moves
simply on the basis of position adjustments (for example, shorts getting
squeezed out).
Another important difference between cable and EUR/USD comes in their dif-
ferent reactions to domestic economic/news developments. Cable tends to
display more explosive reactions to unexpected UK news/data than EUR/USD
does to similar Eurozone news/data.
Important UK data reports
Key UK data reports to watch for are
 Bank of England (BOE) Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) rate decisions,
as well as speeches by MPC members and the BOE governor
 BOE MPC minutes (released two weeks after each MPC meeting)
 Inflation gauges, such as consumer price index (CPI), producer price
index (PPI), and the British Retailers Consortium (BRC) shop price index
 Retail sales and the BRC retail sales monitor
 Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) house price balance
 Industrial and manufacturing production
 Trade balance
 GfK (a private market research firm) UK consumer confidence survey

Safe haven or panic button: USD/CHF
The Swiss franc has, or we should say had, a reputation for being a safe-
haven currency — a reputation that is largely a relic of the Cold War, when
fears of a European ground war between the United States and the Soviet
Union meant most European financial centers could be out of business in
short order. In practical terms, this is no longer the case, but plenty of people
in the market continue to refer to the CHF as a safe-haven currency. 
Knee-jerk buying of CHF frequently occurs in response to geopolitical crises
or terrorism. But those market reactions are increasingly very short-lived,
usually only a few minutes or hours now, before preexisting trends reassert
themselves. Instead of portraying it as a safe-haven currency pair, we prefer
to view USD/CHF as the panic button of forex markets. When unexpected
geopolitical news hits the proverbial fan, USD/CHF usually reacts the fastest
and the farthest.
Trading fundamentals of USD/CHF
In terms of overall market volume, USD/CHF accounts for only 4 percent of
global daily trading volume according to the 2004 BIS survey. With such a
small share of market turnover, you’d be right in wondering why it’s consid-
ered a major pair in the first place. And that’s probably the key takeaway
from this section: In terms of liquidity, Swissy is not a major.
USD/CHF is quoted in terms of the number of CHF per USD. At a USD/CHF rate
of 1.2545, it costs CHF 1.2545 to buy $1. USD/CHF trades in the overall direction
of the U.S. dollar and inversely to the CHF. If the USD/CHF rate moves higher,
the USD is strengthening and the CHF is weakening. The USD is the primary
currency in the pairing, and the CHF is the secondary currency. That means
 USD/CHF is traded in amounts denominated in USD. In online currency
trading platforms, standard lot sizes are $100,000, and mini lot sizes are
$10,000.
 The pip value, or minimum price fluctuation, is denominated in CHF.
 Profit and loss accrues in CHF. For one standard lot position size, each pip
is worth CHF 10; for one mini lot position size, each pip is worth CHF 1. To
convert those amounts to USD, divide the CHF amount by the USD/CHF
rate. Using 1.2500 as the rate, CHF 10 = $8 and CHF 1 = $0.80. The pip
value will change over time as the level of the USD/CHF exchange rate
fluctuates, with a lower USD/CHF rate giving a higher pip value in USD
terms, and vice versa.
 Margin calculations are typically calculated in USD. So it’s a straightfor-
ward calculation using the leverage rate to see how much margin is
required to hold a position in USD/JPY. At 100:1 leverage, $1,000 of avail-
able margin is needed to open a standard-size position of 100,000 USD/CHF.

Keeping the focus on Europe
Switzerland conducts the vast share (about 80 percent) of its foreign trade
with the Eurozone and remaining EU countries. When it comes to the value 
of the CHF, the Swiss are most concerned with its level against the EUR as
opposed to the USD. The Swiss National Bank (SNB), the Swiss central bank,
tends to get involved in the forex market only when the Swiss franc is either
too strong or too weak against the euro.
The SNB typically prefers to use verbal intervention to influence the value of
the CHF, and SNB comments frequently stir up USD/CHF and EUR/CHF trad-
ing. Since the introduction of the euro in 1999, EUR/CHF has been confined
mostly to a relatively narrow range of 1.5000 to 1.6200, but as of this writing
it’s pushing toward 1.65, drawing increased criticism from the SNB.
Important Swiss economic reports
Swiss data tends to get lost in the mix of data reports out of the United States
and the Eurozone, with many in the market looking at Switzerland as a de
facto Eurozone member. In that sense, market reactions to Swiss data and
events primarily show up in EUR/CHF cross rates. The important Swiss data
to keep an eye on are
 SNB rate decisions and speeches by directorate members
 KOF Index of Globalization
 Retail sales
 Trade balance
 PPI and CPI
 Unemployment rate
Price action behavior in GBP/USD 
and USD/CHF
The GBP/USD and USD/CHF share similar market liquidity and trading inter-
est, which are the main drivers of price action. In both pairs, liquidity and
market interest tend to be the thinnest among the majors, especially outside
of European trading hours. As a result, both pairs typically trade with wider
3- to 5-pip prices relative to narrower spreads in EUR/USD and USD/JPY. The
most important trading characteristics of cable and Swissy are as follows:
 Price action tends to be jumpy, even in normal markets. Cable 
and Swissy are like long-tailed cats in a room full of rocking chairs —
extremely nervous. In a relatively calm market, you can see prices in
these two pairs jump around by routine 2- to 3-pip increments (say, 
from 20/25 to 22/27 or 23/28, back to 21/26, and then 24/29).
344
Book V: Foreign Currency Trading 

When prices are moving in response to news or data, those price jumps
can be even more pronounced, frequently changing by 3 to 5 pips between
prices. Online traders are also likely to get more “rates changed” responses
when trying to deal on the current market price. That response means the
price changed by the time your trade request was received and the
attempted trade was not completed. The subsequent price may be 2 to 3
pips higher or lower than where you first tried to deal.
 Price action tends to see one-way traffic in highly directional markets.
When news or data move the market, the price changes in Swissy and
cable are apt to be the most abrupt. On top of that, cable and Swissy will
remain highly directional and tend to see minimal pullbacks or backing
and filling.
 Look at cable and Swissy as leading indicators for EUR/USD. One of
the ways that experienced traders judge the level of buying or selling
interest, how bid or offered a market is, during a directional move is 
by looking at how cable and Swissy are trading. For example, if bids in
USD/CHF keep appearing in a relatively orderly fashion, say every 1 to 2
pips on a downswing, it’s a sign that the move is not especially extreme.
On the other hand, if the prices are dropping by larger increments and
displaying very few bounces, it’s a strong indication that a larger move
is unfolding.
 False breaks of technical levels occur frequently. Cable and Swissy
have a nasty habit of breaking beyond technical support and resistance
levels, only to reverse course and then trade in the opposite direction.
And we’re not talking about just a few points beyond the level here, but
more like 25 to 30 pips in many cases.
 Spike reversals are very common. The tendency of cable and Swissy 
to overshoot in extreme directional moves and to generate false breaks
of technical levels means that spike reversals appear frequently on
short-term charts. Though the size of the spikes will vary depending 
on the market circumstances and current events, spike reversals of
more than 30 to 40 points on an hourly closing basis should alert you to
a potentially larger reversal taking place. The bigger the spike reversal
(and it’s not uncommon to see 50- to 70-pip spikes in cable and Swissy),
the more significance it holds for the future direction.
GBP/USD and USD/CHF 
trading considerations
The routine short-term volatility of cable and Swissy suggests several impor-
tant tactical trading refinements. The overarching idea here is to adjust your
trading strategies to weather the erratic price action and higher overall
volatility in these pairs in comparison to the larger EUR/USD.
345
Chapter 2: Major and Minor Currency Pairs
Book V
Foreign
Currency
Trading

Reducing position size relative to margin
This first consideration is especially important in cable, due to its high rela-
tive value to the USD. With GBP/USD trading around 1.90 to the dollar (£1 =
$1.90) a one-lot position (£100,000) eats up $1,900 in required margin at 100:1
leverage. A similar-size position in EUR/USD (at 1.30) takes up only $130,000
and costs $1,300 in margin. If you’re going to trade in cable, you need more
margin than if you stay with EUR/USD, USD/JPY, or Swissy.
Cable and Swissy’s higher volatility also argue for overall smaller position
sizes. A smaller position allows you to better withstand their short-term
volatility and gives you greater staying power relative to margin.
Allowing a greater margin of error on technical breaks
In cable and Swissy, tests of technical levels frequently result in false breaks
as stops are triggered. If your stop loss is too close to the technical level, it’s
ripe for the picking by the market. Factoring in a margin of error when plac-
ing stop-loss orders can help — it allows you to withstand any short-term
false break. Using a margin of error may also require you to reduce your posi-
tion size to give you greater flexibility and margin staying-power.
Anticipating overshoots and false breaks for position entry
When you’re looking to enter a position by selling on rallies or buying on
dips, you’re probably focused on selling at resistance and buying on support.
You can take advantage of cable and Swissy’s tendency to overshoot or make
false breaks of technical levels by placing your limit order behind the techni-
cal level (above resistance, below support). If cable and Swissy break
through the level, you’d be able to enter at a better price than you would
have if you’d adhered to the technical level alone.
Alternatively, you can enter a portion of your desired position at the techni-
cal level and enter the rest at better prices if the level is breached, improving
the average rate of your position. Worst-case scenario, the market only fills
you for half of your desired position and then reverses. Best-case scenario,
you establish your full desired position at a better rate than you expected
and the market reverses. If the market keeps going against you, at least your
average position rate is better than it otherwise would have been.
Being quick on the trigger
Cable and Swissy tend to move very quickly and may not spend a lot of time
around key price levels. This favors traders who are decisive and quick on
the trigger in terms of entering and exiting positions. Another way you can
take advantage of the short-term volatility of cable and Swissy is by using
resting orders to get in and out. You may not be in front of your trading
screen, or your click-and-deal trade may not have made it through on a rapid
price fluctuation. A standing limit order will accomplish the same trade —
only automatically and instantly if the price deals. Trailing stops are espe-
cially useful when you have a position that’s moving the right way.
346
Book V: Foreign Currency Trading 

Resisting the contrarian urge following large directional moves
After an extended directional price move, many traders may feel inclined to
trade in the opposite direction, if only for a short-term correction. Maybe you
missed the big move and think it’s ripe for a pullback. Or maybe it looks like
the move has gone too far, too fast. Resist that urge in cable and Swissy. On
days with large directional price moves of more than 100 pips, cable and
Swissy often finish out the trading day at the extremes of the price move
(meaning at the highs on an up-move and at the lows on a decline). So even if
you sell the high of a move up, you’re unlikely to get any joy on the day.
Picking your spots wisely
Instead of simply jumping into cable or Swissy, the way you may in EUR/USD,
you’re going to need to do a fair amount of watching and studying to get a
handle on where appropriate entry points may be. Short-term volatility in
cable and Swissy make for treacherous short-term trading conditions. You’ll
greatly improve your chances of catching a favorable move if you step back
and look at the medium and longer-term pictures (four-hour and daily)
instead of getting caught up in the short-term volatility.
Trading the Minor Pairs: USD/CAD,
AUD/USD, and NZD/USD
The minor dollar pairs are USD/CAD (the U.S. dollar versus the Canadian
dollar), AUD/USD (the Australian dollar versus the U.S. dollar), and NZD/USD
(the New Zealand dollar versus the U.S. dollar). The minor currency pairs are
also commonly referred to as the commonwealth currencies or the commodity
currencies.
Commonwealth refers to the commonwealth of former colonies of the United
Kingdom. The commodity currencies nickname stems from the key role that
oil, metals, and mining industries play in the national economies of Canada,
Australia, and New Zealand.
The minor currency pairs each account for around 5 percent of global daily
trading volume, according to the 2004 Bank for International Settlements (BIS)
survey of forex market volumes. But they can offer significant trading oppor-
tunities, both for short-term traders and medium- to longer-term speculators.

Trading fundamentals of USD/CAD
The Canadian dollar (nicknamed the Loonie, after the local bird pictured on
domestic currency notes) trades according to the same macroeconomic fun-
damentals as most other major currencies. That means you’ll need to closely
follow Bank of Canada (BOC) monetary policy developments, current eco-
nomic data, inflation readings, and political goings-on, just as you would with
any of the other majors.
As goes the U.S. economy, so goes the Canadian economy. The trajectory 
of the Canadian economy is closely linked to the overall direction of the 
U.S. economy. The United States and Canada are still each other’s largest
commercial trading partners, and the vast majority of Canadians live within
100 miles of the U.S./Canadian border. Even the BOC regularly refers to the
U.S. economic outlook in its forecasts of Canadian economic prospects. It’s a
long-term dynamic, making for plenty of short-term trading opportunities.
Trading USD/CAD by the numbers
The standard market convention is to quote USD/CAD in terms of the number
of Canadian dollars per USD. A USD/CAD rate of 1.1800, for instance, means 
it takes CAD 1.18 to buy USD 1. The market convention means that USD/CAD
trades in the same overall direction of the USD, with a higher USD/CAD rate
reflecting a stronger USD/weaker CAD and a lower rate showing a weaker
USD/stronger CAD.
USD/CAD has the USD as the primary currency and the CAD as the counter
currency. This means
 USD/CAD is traded in amounts denominated in USD. For online cur-
rency trading platforms, standard lot sizes are USD 100,000, and mini lot
sizes are USD 10,000.
 The pip value, or minimum price fluctuation, is denominated in CAD.
 Profit and loss register in CAD. For a standard lot position size, each
pip is worth CAD 10, and each pip in a mini-lot position is worth CAD 1.
Using a USD/CAD rate of 1.1800 (which will change over time, of course),
that equates to a pip value of USD 8.47 for each standard lot and USD
0.85 for each mini-lot.
 Margin calculations are typically based in USD, so to see how much
margin is required to hold a position in USD/CAD it’s a simple calcula-
tion using the leverage ratio. At 100:1 leverage, for instance, $1,000 of
available margin is needed to trade 100,000 USD/CAD, and $100 is
needed to trade 10,000 USD/CAD.
348
Book V: Foreign Currency Trading 

USD/CAD is unique among currency pairs in that it trades for spot settlement
only one day beyond the trade date, as opposed to the normal two days for
all other currency pairs. The difference is due to the fact that New York and
Toronto, the two nations’ financial centers, are in the same time zone, allow-
ing for faster trade confirmations and settlement transfers. For spot traders,
the difference means that USD/CAD undergoes the extended weekend (three-
day) rollover after the close of trading on Thursdays, instead of on
Wednesdays like all other pairs, assuming no holidays are involved.
Canadian events and data reports to watch
On top of following U.S. economic data to maintain an outlook for the larger
economy to the south, you need to pay close attention to individual Canadian
economic data and official commentaries. In particular, keep an eye on the
following Canadian economic events and reports:
 Bank of Canada (BOC) speakers, rate decisions, and economic forecasts
 Employment report
 Gross domestic product (GDP) reported monthly
 International securities transactions
 International merchandise trade
 Leading economic indicators
 Wholesale and retail sales
 Consumer price index (CPI) and BOC CPI
 Manufacturing shipments
 Ivey Purchasing Managers Index
Trading fundamentals of AUD/USD
The Australian dollar is commonly referred to as Aussie (pronounced aw-
zee), or even just Oz for short. These terms refer to both the AUD/USD pair
and Australian dollar cross pairs. Aussie trading volume accounts for a little
over 5 percent of daily global spot turnover, but it’s still a regular mover, both
against the U.S. dollar and on the crosses, so it makes an active currency pair
for speculators.
In trading AUD/USD, you need to factor in all the usual macroeconomic sus-
pects, like monetary policy rhetoric, interest-rate levels, and all the domestic
economic data that determine them. Comments by officials from the Reserve
Bank of Australia (RBA), the central bank, and the finance minister can move
the Aussie market sharply.
349
Chapter 2: Major and Minor Currency Pairs
Book V
Foreign
Currency
Trading

The boom in Asian regional growth over the past decade and high levels of
global economic growth have benefited the Australian economy in recent
years. Those high levels of growth have brought with them relatively high
levels of inflation, prompting the RBA to repeatedly hike interest rates. As a
result, nominal interest rates in Australia are currently the second highest
among the dollar pairs, with only New Zealand interest rates higher. That
means the interest-rate outlook is especially critical to the value of the Aussie.
Aussie trading is heavily influenced by cross trading, especially against 
the yen, because the AUD/JPY cross captures one of the highest interest dif-
ferentials between major currencies, as of this writing. AUD/JPY has been a
favorite among traders pursuing the carry trade, so you’ll want to monitor
important AUD/JPY technical levels.
Aussie trading is also regularly influenced by New Zealand economic data,
but the flow is usually more significant in the opposite direction, where
Aussie data will exert a larger pull on NZD prices, given the larger size of the
Australian economy. Still, when trading Aussie, it helps to be aware of upcom-
ing NZD data, because the two tend to move together in regional sympathy.
Occasionally, though, divergent economic data can produce sharp swings in
the AUD/NZD cross rate, where NZD may be sold on weaker NZ data, for
instance, and AUD bought if Aussie prospects remain more buoyant.
Trading AUD/USD by the numbers
Market quoting conventions for trading in AUD/USD are to quote the pair 
in terms of the number of USD per AUD. An AUD/USD rate of 0.7800 means 
it takes USD 0.78 (or 78¢) to buy AUD1. This is the same convention as
GBP/USD.
AUD/USD trades in the opposite direction of the overall value of the USD and
in the same direction as the value of the AUD. A higher AUD/USD rate means
AUD is stronger/USD weaker, and a lower AUD/USD rate means AUD is
weaker/USD stronger. If you think the AUD should strengthen, for example,
you’d be looking to buy AUD/USD. Alternatively, if you think the USD is in an
overall strengthening trend, you’d be looking to sell AUD/USD (buy USD).
AUD is the primary currency in the pair, and USD is the counter currency,
which means
 AUD/USD is traded in amounts denominated in AUD.
 The pip value is denominated in USD.
 Profit and loss accrue in USD. For a 100,000 AUD/USD position size,
each pip is worth USD 10, and each pip on a 10,000 AUD/USD position is
worth USD 1.
350
Book V: Foreign Currency Trading 

 Margin calculations are typically in USD on online trading platforms.
Because of AUD’s lower relative value to USD, the amount of margin
required per lot of AUD/USD is one of the lowest of the dollar pairs. 
At an AUD/USD rate of 0.7800, for example, a 100,000 AUD/USD position
size requires USD 780 of margin, and a 10,000 AUD/USD position needs
only USD 78. Compare that to the USD 1,300 of margin needed for a
100,000 EUR/USD position (at 1.3000) or USD 1,900 needed for a 100,000
GBP/USD position (at 1.9000), and you can see that AUD/USD provides a
lot of pip bang for your margin buck. But don’t trade Aussie solely on its
lower relative margin cost. The margin cost will change over time based
on changes in the AUD/USD exchange rate, with a lower AUD/USD rate
requiring less USD in margin and a higher AUD/USD rate requiring more
margin USD.
Australian events and data reports to watch
Australian data and events regularly transpire during the New York late after-

Trading fundamentals of NZD/USD
The New Zealand dollar is nicknamed the Kiwi, which refers to both the NZD
and the NZD/USD pair. Given the relatively small size of the New Zealand
economy, Kiwi is probably the most interest-rate sensitive of all the curren-
cies and, therefore, heavily influenced by investment and speculation.
The New Zealand economy has undergone a virtual transformation over the
past two decades, moving from a mostly agricultural export orientation to a
domestically driven service and manufacturing base. The rapid growth has
seen disposable incomes soar; with higher disposable incomes have come
persistently high levels of inflation. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand
(RBNZ), the central bank, has responded by raising official interest rates to
over 7 percent, the highest nominal interest rate among the major currencies
(as of this writing).

Kiwi trading is heavily influenced by interest-rate levels and expectations,
with international investors able to reap several percentage points in higher
yields on high credit-quality New Zealand government bonds. The primary
fundamental force driving Kiwi, then, is near-term interest-rate outlook and
inflation environment. The RBNZ has shown a determined willingness to
tighten monetary policy to stamp out inflation, even at the risk of unsettling
domestic growth, reinforcing the value of Kiwi along the way.
In addition to all the standard New Zealand economic data and official pro-
nouncements you need to monitor, Kiwi trading is closely tied to Australian
data and prospects, due to a strong trade and regional relationship. No set
formula exists to describe the currencies’ relationship, but a general rule is
that when it’s a USD-based move, Aussie and Kiwi will tend to trade in the
same direction as each other relative to the USD. But when Kiwi or Aussie
news comes in, the AUD/NZD (Aussie/Kiwi) cross will exert a larger influence.
Trading NZD/USD by the numbers
Kiwi is another of the commonwealth currencies and is quoted in similar fash-
ion to GBP/USD and AUD/USD, or the number of USD per NZD. An NZD/USD
rate of 0.6800 means it costs USD 0.68 (or 68¢) to buy NZD 1. Kiwi trades in 
the opposite direction of the overall value of the USD, so a weaker USD means
a higher Kiwi rate, and a lower Kiwi rate represents a stronger USD.
The NZD is the primary currency in the pair, and the USD is the counter 
currency, which means
 NZD/USD is traded in position sizes denominated in NZD.
 The pip value is denominated in USD.
 Profit and loss accrues in USD. On a 100,000 NZD/USD position, each
pip is worth USD 10; on a 10,000 Kiwi position size, each pip is worth
USD 1. At current exchange rates, that makes Kiwi pips the most expen-
sive of the dollar pairs on a percentage-of-margin basis.
 Margin calculations are typically based in USD on margin trading plat-
forms. Because of Kiwi’s lower value relative to the USD, NZD/USD cur-
rently requires the least amount of margin dollars on a per-lot basis.
Using an NZD/USD rate of 0.6800 and a leverage ratio of 100:1, a 100,000
Kiwi position requires only USD 680 in margin, while a 10,000 NZD/USD
position would need only USD 68 in margin. In relation to the other
dollar pairs, this makes Kiwi the cheapest to trade on a margin basis
and, together with the high pip value, provides the highest pip-per-
margin ratio.
Don’t trade Kiwi solely based on the lower margin cost basis. No relationship
exists between the margin cost of a position and the likelihood of a positive
outcome.

New Zealand events and data reports to watch
RBNZ commentary and rate decisions are pivotal to the value of Kiwi, given
the prominence of the interest-rate differential in favor of NZD at the moment.
Finance ministry comments are secondary to the rhetoric of the independent
RBNZ but can still upset the Kiwi cart from time to time. Additionally, keep an
eye on the following:
 Consumer prices, housing prices, and food prices
 Retail sales and credit-card spending
 Trade balance and current account
 Nonresident bond holdings
 Business confidence surveys from National Bank of New Zealand (NBNZ)
and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ), and the quarterly
business sentiment survey issued by the private New Zealand Institute
of Economic Research (NZIER)
Trading considerations in USD/CAD,
AUD/USD, and NZD/USD
These three currency pairs share many of the same trading traits and 
even travel as a pack sometimes — especially Aussie and Kiwi, given their
regional proximity and close economic ties. Whether they’re being grouped
as the commodity currencies, the commonwealth currencies, or just smaller
regional currencies versus the U.S. dollar, they can frequently serve as a lead-
ing indicator of overall USD market direction.
Liquidity and market interest are lower
One of the reasons these pairs tend to exhibit leading characteristics is due
to the lower relative liquidity of the pairs, which amplifies the speculative
effect on them. If sentiment is shifting in favor of the U.S. dollar, for example,
the effect of speculative interest — the fast money — is going to be most 
evident in lower-volume currency pairs.
In general, you need to be aware that overall liquidity and market interest in
these pairs is significantly lower than in the majors. On a daily basis, liquidity
in these pairs is at its peak when the local centers (Toronto, Sydney, and
Wellington) are open. London market makers provide a solid liquidity base 
to bridge the gap outside the local markets, but you can largely forget about
USD/CAD during the Asia-Pacific session, and the Aussie and Kiwi markets
are problematic after the London/European session close until their financial
centers reopen a few hours later. The net result is a concentration of market
interest in these currency pairs among the major banks of the currency coun-
tries, which has implications of its own (see the “Technical levels can be
blurry” section, later in this chapter).
353
Chapter 2: Major and Minor Currency Pairs

Price action is highly event driven
As a result of the overall lower level of liquidity in these currency pairs, in
concert with relatively high levels of speculative positioning (at times),
you’ve got the ultimate mix for explosive reactions after currency-specific
news or data comes out. Significant data or news surprises, especially when
contrary to expectations and likely market positioning, tend to have an out-
sized impact on the market. Traders positioning in these currencies need to
be especially aware of this and to recognize the greater degree of volatility
and risk they’re facing if events don’t transpire as expected.
A data or event surprise typically leads to a price gap when the news is first
announced. If the news is sufficiently at odds with market expectations and
positioning, subsequent price action tends to be mostly one-way traffic, as
the market reacts to the surprise news and exits earlier positions. If you’re
caught on the wrong side after unexpected news in these pairs, you’re likely
better off getting out as soon as possible rather than waiting for a correction
to exit at a better level. The lower liquidity and interest in these currency
pairs mean you’re probably not alone in being caught wrong-sided, which
tends to see steady, one-way interest, punctuated by accelerations when
additional stop-loss order levels are hit.
All politics (and economic data) is local
Domestic political developments in these smaller-currency countries can pro-
voke significant movements in the local currencies. National elections, politi-
cal scandals, and abrupt policy changes can all lead to upheavals in the value
of the local currency. The effect tends to be most pronounced on the down-
side of the currency’s value (meaning that bad news tends to hurt a currency
more than good news — if there ever is any in politics — helps it). Of course,
every situation is different, but the spillover effect between politics and cur-
rencies is greatest in these pairs, which means you need to be aware of
domestic political events if you’re trading in them.
In terms of economic data, these currency pairs tend to participate in overall
directional moves relative to the U.S. dollar until a local news or data event
triggers more concentrated interest on the local currency. If the USD is under
pressure across the board, for instance, USD/CAD is likely to move lower 
in concert with other dollar pairs. But if negative Canadian news or data
emerges, USD/CAD is likely to pare its losses and may even start to move
higher if the news is bad enough. If the Canadian news is CAD-positive (say, 
a higher CPI reading pointing to a potential rate hike), USD/CAD is likely to
accelerate to the downside, because USD selling interest is now amplified by
CAD buying interest.
354
Book V: Foreign Currency Trading 

Technical levels can be blurry
The relatively lower level of liquidity and market interest in these currency
pairs makes for sometimes-difficult technical trading conditions. Trend lines
and retracement levels in particular are subject to regular overshoots. Prices
may move beyond the technical level — sometimes only 5 to 10 pips, other
times for extensive distances or for prolonged periods — only to reverse
course and reestablish the technical level later.
If the price break of a technical level is quickly reversed, it’s a good sign that
it was just a position-related movement. If fresh news is out, however, you
may be seeing the initial wave of a larger directional move.
Cross-Currency Pairs
A cross-currency pair (or cross, for short) is any currency pair that doesn’t
have the U.S. dollar as one of the currencies in the pairing. The catch is 
that cross rates are derived from the prices of the underlying USD pairs. 
For example, one of the most active crosses is EUR/JPY, pitting the two
largest currencies outside the U.S. dollar directly against each other. But the
EUR/JPY rate at any given instant is a function (the product) of the current
EUR/USD and USD/JPY rates.
The most popular cross pairs involve the most actively traded major curren-
cies, like EUR/JPY, EUR/GBP, and EUR/CHF. According to the 2004 BIS survey
of foreign-exchange market activity, direct cross trading accounted for a rela-
tively small percentage of global daily volume — less than 10 percent for the
major crosses combined.
But that figure significantly understates the amount of interest that is actually
flowing through the crosses, because large interbank cross trades are typi-
cally executed through the USD pairs instead of directly in the cross markets.
If a Japanese corporation needs to buy half a billion EUR/JPY (half a yard,
in market parlance), for example, the interbank traders executing the order
will alternately buy EUR/USD and buy USD/JPY to fill the order. Going directly
through the EUR/JPY market would likely be impractical and would tend to
tip off too many in the market and drive the rate away from them. (We look at
how large cross flows can drive the dollar pairs in the “Stretching the legs”
section, later in this chapter.)
For individual traders dealing online, however, the direct cross pairs offer
more than ample liquidity and narrower spreads than can be realized by 
trading through the dollar pairs. Additionally, most online platforms do not
net out positions based on overall dollar exposure, so you’d end up using
roughly twice the amount of margin to enter a position through the dollar
355
Chapter 2: Major and Minor Currency Pairs

pairs to create the same net market position you’d have if you’d gone
through the direct cross market. The advances in electronic trading technol-
ogy even make relatively obscure crosses like NZD/JPY and GBP/CHF easily
accessible to individual online traders.
Why trade the crosses?
Cross pairs represent entirely new sets of routinely fluctuating currency pairs
that offer another universe of trading opportunities beyond the primary USD
pairs. In particular, cross trading offers the following advantages:
 You can pinpoint trade opportunities based on news or fundamentals.
If negative Japanese news or data is released, you may be looking to sell
the JPY. But against what? If the USD is currently weakening, buying USD
and selling JPY may not yield any results. Selling JPY against another
currency with better immediate prospects (such as buying EUR/JPY or
AUD/JPY) may yield a more appreciable return.
 You can take advantage of interest-rate differentials. Selling low-yielding
currencies against higher-yielding currencies is known as a carry trade.
Carry trades seek to profit from both interest-rate differentials and spot
price appreciation, and can form the basis of significant trends.
 You can exploit technical trading opportunities. The majors may be
range bound or showing no actionable technical signals, but a cross rate
may be set to stage a directional price breakout. Survey charts of cross
rates to spot additional technical trading setups.
 You can expand the horizon of trading opportunities. Instead of look-
ing at only four to seven dollar pairs, cross rates offer another dozen
currency pairs that you can look to for trading opportunities.
 You can go with the flow. Speculative flows are ever-present in the cur-
rency market, but they don’t always involve the dollar pairs. Today’s
speculative flow may be focused on the JPY crosses or selling CAD
across the board on the back of surprisingly weak CAD data. The more
attuned you are to cross-currency pairs, the more likely you are to iden-
tify and capitalize on the speculative move du jour.
Calculating cross rates
Cross rates are a function of the prices of the underlying USD pairs.
Depending on how the dollar pairs are quoted (that is, whether the USD is
the primary or the secondary currency), the cross rate is going to be either
the product of multiplying the rates of two dollar pairs or the quotient of
dividing the rates of two dollar pairs. But each currency quote has two sides:
the bid and the offer.
356
Book V: Foreign Currency Trading 

Calculating the cross rate is a messy business. Fortunately, online traders
don’t really need to know how cross rates are calculated, because the online
trading platforms are doing it for you and narrowing the spread to boot.
Different cross pairs have different spreads depending on the spreads of the
underlying USD pairs, with less-liquid and more-volatile pairs resulting in
wider cross spreads. For instance, GBP/JPY is going to have a wider spread
than EUR/JPY because of the lower liquidity and higher volatility of GBP/USD
relative to EUR/USD. But because the components of wider-spread crosses
are more volatile, the cross rates themselves will also be more volatile, allow-
ing the spread to be recouped, typically in relatively short order.
Stretching the legs
A lot of interbank cross trading volume does not go through the direct cross
market, because institutional traders have a vested interest in hiding their
operations from the rest of the market. In many cases, too, standing liquidity
is simply not available in less-liquid crosses (GBP/JPY or NZD/JPY, for exam-
ple). So they have to go through the legs, as the dollar pairs are called with
respect to cross trading, to get the trade done. They also have an interest in
maximizing the prices at which they’re dealing — to sell as high as possible
and to buy as low as possible.
One of the ways they’re able to do that is to alternate their trading in the
dollar legs. If you have to sell a large amount of EUR/JPY, for example, you
can alternate selling EUR/USD, which may tend to drive down EUR/USD but
also push USD/JPY higher (because U.S. dollars overall are being bought).
You now (you hope) have a higher USD/JPY rate at which to sell the JPY leg
of the order. But selling USD/JPY may push USD/JPY lower or cap its rise,
leading EUR/USD to stop declining and recover higher, because U.S. dollars
are now being bought. Now you have a slightly better EUR/USD rate to keep
selling the EUR leg of the order. By alternating the timing of which U.S. dollar
leg you’re selling, you have (you hope) executed the order at better rates
than you could have directly in the cross and likely managed to obscure your
market activity in the more active dollar pairs.
Of course, it doesn’t always work out as neatly and cleanly as just described.
The net result in the market is a steady directional move in the cross rate,
while the USD pairs remain relatively stagnant or within recent ranges. Be
alert for such dollar-based movement, and consider that it may be a cross-
driven move and a potential trading opportunity.
357
Chapter 2: Major and Minor Currency Pairs
Book V
Foreign
Currency
Trading

Cross-rate movements can also have a pronounced effect on how individual
dollar pairs move in an otherwise dollar-based market reaction. Say some very
USD-positive news or data has just been released, and the market starts buying
USD across the board. If USD/JPY happens to break a key technical resistance
level, it may accelerate higher and prompt EUR/JPY to break a similarly signifi-
cant resistance level, bringing in EUR/JPY buyers. The net effect in this case is
that EUR/USD will not fall as much or as rapidly as USD/JPY will rally, because
of the EUR/JPY cross buying. If you went short EUR/USD on the positive U.S.
news, you may not get as much joy. But the legs also tend to move in phases,
and continued EUR/USD selling may eventually break through support, sending
EUR/JPY lower and capping USD/JPY in the process.
As you can see, crosses can affect the market in virtually limitless ways, and
there’s no set way these things play out.
When the U.S. dollar is not the primary focus of the market’s attention, or if
major U.S. news is approaching (like a non-farm payrolls [NFP] report or a
Federal Open Market Committee [FOMC] decision in a few days), sending
market interest to the sidelines, speculative interest frequently shifts to the
crosses. Always consider that the market’s focus may be cross-driven rather
than centered on the USD or any other single currency. Some days it’s a
dollar market, and other days it’s a cross market. GBP may be weakening
across the board on weak UK data, but if the USD is similarly out of favor, 
the pound’s weakness is likely to be most evident on the crosses.
When looking at cross-trade opportunities, you may be tempted to translate
the cross idea into a USD-based trade. You may think that AUD/JPY is forming
a top, for example. If you’re right, you may be thinking that one of two moves
is likely — USD/JPY will move lower or AUD/USD will move lower — and you
may be tempted into selling one of the legs (AUD/USD or USD/JPY) because
you don’t want to get involved in a cross. But there’s another possibility: 
One leg may go down precipitously while the other moves higher, sending 
the cross lower, as you expected. But if you went short the wrong leg, you
missed the boat.
When you spot a trade opportunity in a cross, trade the cross. Don’t try to out-
guess the market and pick which component will make the cross move. Trust
that if your trade analysis is correct, the cross will move the way you expect.
Trading the JPY crosses
The JPY crosses constitute one of the primary cross families and basically 
pit the JPY against the other major currencies. EUR/JPY is the highest 
volume of the JPY crosses, but the prominence of the carry trade, where 
the low-yielding JPY is sold and higher-yielding currencies are bought, has
seen significant increases in GBP/JPY, AUD/JPY, and NZD/JPY trading volume.
Those currencies offer the highest interest-rate differentials against the JPY.
358
Book V: Foreign Currency Trading 

JPY crosses have their pip values denominated in JPY, meaning profit and
loss will accrue in JPY. The margin requirement will vary greatly depending
on which primary currency is involved, with GBP/JPY requiring the greatest
margin and NZD/JPY requiring the least.
In terms of JPY-cross fundamentals, JPY-based news and events tend to have
the greatest impact, but trying to pin down which leg is going to cause the
JPY crosses to move is a risky game. When trading in the JPY crosses, you
need to keep an eye on USD/JPY in particular, due to its relatively explosive
tendencies and its key place as an outlet for overall JPY buying or selling. Be
alert for similar technical levels between USD/JPY and the JPY crosses, as a
break in either could spill over into the other.
Trading the EUR crosses
Outside of EUR/JPY, EUR cross action tends to be concentrated in EUR/GBP
and EUR/CHF, where the cross direction is largely determined by changing
outlooks between the Eurozone economy relative to the UK and Swiss
economies. Reactions to Eurozone and Swiss news or data are most likely to
be felt in the EUR crosses as opposed to EUR/USD or USD/CHF, whereas UK
news/data is going to explode all over GBP/USD and EUR/GBP.
Sharp USD-driven moves will also affect these crosses, with the brunt of 
the USD move being felt in GBP/USD and USD/CHF, frequently biasing those
legs to drive their EUR cross in the short run. That means frequently (but 
not always) that a sharp move higher in the USD will tend to see a higher
EUR/CHF and EUR/GBP, while a rapid USD move lower will tend to see lower
EUR/CHF and EUR/GBP.
The pip values of these EUR crosses will be denominated in either GBP or
CHF, with GBP significantly more expensive on a pip basis than CHF (as of
this writing). Typical daily ranges in the EUR crosses are relatively small on 
a pip basis — roughly 20 to 40 pips on average — but they’re still substantial
on a pip-value basis and roughly equivalent to daily EUR/USD ranges.

T
he currency market has its own set of market trading conventions and
related lingo, just like any other financial market. If you’re new to cur-
rency trading, the mechanics and terminology may take some getting used to.
But at the end of the day, you’ll see that most currency trade conventions are
pretty straightforward.
Not as straightforward is figuring out in what direction the major currencies
are likely to move. Because so many things impact whether currencies
strengthen or weaken, currency traders have to have a bit of detective in
them. Not only do they have to find the necessary information, but they 
often have to interpret it, too.
The Nuts and Bolts of Currency Trading
The biggest mental hurdle facing newcomers to currencies, especially traders
familiar with other markets, is the idea that each currency trade consists of 
a simultaneous purchase and sale. The purchase of one currency involves 
the simultaneous sale of another currency. This is the exchange in foreign
exchange. To put it another way, if you’re looking for the dollar to go higher,
the question is “Higher against what?” The answer has to be another cur-
rency. In relative terms, if the dollar goes up against another currency, it also
means that the other currency has gone down against the dollar. To think of
it in stock-market terms, when you buy a stock, you’re selling cash, and when
you sell a stock, you’re buying cash. The following sections outline the other
conventions fundamental to currency trading.

Grasping the long, short, and square of it
Forex markets use the same terms to express market positioning as most
other financial markets do. But because currency trading involves simultane-
ous buying and selling, being clear on the terms helps — especially if you’re
totally new to financial market trading.
Going long
A long position, or simply a long, refers to a market position in which you’ve
bought a security. In the currency market, it refers to having bought a cur-
rency pair. When you’re long, you’re looking for prices to move higher, so you
can sell at a higher price than where you bought. When you want to close a
long position, you have to sell what you bought. If you’re buying at multiple
price levels, you’re adding to longs and getting longer.
Getting short
A short position, or simply a short, refers to a market position in which you’ve
sold a security that you never owned. In the stock market, selling a stock
short requires borrowing the stock (and paying a fee to the lending broker-
age) so you can sell it. In forex markets, it means you’ve sold a currency pair:
You’ve sold the base currency and bought the counter currency. So you’re
still making an exchange, just in the opposite order and according to cur-
rency pair quoting terms. When you’ve sold a currency pair, it’s called going
short or getting short, and it means you’re looking for the pair’s price to move
lower so you can buy it back at a profit. If you sell at various price levels,
you’re adding to shorts and getting shorter.
Because currencies can fall or rise relative to each other, both in medium-
and long-term trends and minute-to-minute fluctuations, currency pair prices
are as likely to be going down at any moment as they are up. Therefore, in
currency trading, going short is as common as going long. “Selling high and
buying low” is a standard currency trading strategy.
Squaring up
If you have no position in the market, it’s called being square or flat. If you have
an open position and want to close it, it’s called squaring up. If you’re short, you
need to buy to square up. If you’re long, you need to sell to go flat. The only
time you have no market exposure or financial risk is when you’re square.
Understanding rollovers
One market convention unique to currencies is rollovers. A rollover is a trans-
action where an open position from one value date (settlement date) is rolled
over into the next value date. Rollovers represent the intersection of interest-
rate markets and forex markets.
362
Book V: Foreign Currency Trading 

Rollovers and interest rates
Rollover rates are based on the difference in interest rates of the two curren-
cies in the pair you’re trading. That’s because what you’re actually trading is
good old-fashioned cash. When you’re long a currency (cash), it’s like having
a deposit in the bank. If you’re short a currency (cash), it’s like having bor-
rowed a loan. Just as you would expect to earn interest on a bank deposit or
pay interest on a loan, you should expect an interest gain/expense for holding
a currency position over the change in value.
The catch in currency trading is that if you carry over an open position 
from one value date to the next, you have two bank accounts involved. Think
of it as one account with a positive balance (the currency you’re long) and
one with a negative balance (the currency you’re short). But because your
accounts are in two different currencies, the two interest rates of the differ-
ent countries will apply.
The difference between the interest rates in the two countries is called the
interest-rate differential. The larger the interest-rate differential, the larger the
impact from rollovers. The narrower the interest-rate differential, the smaller
the effect from rollovers. You can find relevant interest-rate levels of the
major currencies from any number of financial-market Web sites, but www.
marketwatch.com and www.fxstreet.com have especially good resources.
Look for the base or benchmark lending rates in each country.
If you’re going to be trading a relatively large account with an online forex
broker (say, over $25,000 in margin deposited), you’ll probably be able to
negotiate a tighter rollover spread with your broker. This will enable you to
capture more of the gains if you’re positioned the right way, or to reduce
your cost of carry if you’re not.
Rollovers and value dates
In forex markets, spot refers to trade settlement in two business days, which
is called the value date. That time is needed to allow for trade processing
across global time zones and for currency payments to be wired around the
world.
The forex market operates on a 24-hour trade date basis beginning at 5 p.m.
eastern time (ET) and ending the next day at 5 p.m. ET. So if it’s a Monday,
spot currencies are trading for value on Wednesday (assuming no holidays).
At 5 p.m. ET on Monday, the trade date becomes Tuesday and the value date
is shifted to Thursday. If you have an open position on Monday at 5 p.m. ET
closing, your position will be rolled over to the next value date, in this case
from Wednesday to Thursday, or a one-day rollover. If you close your position
the next day (Tuesday) and finish the trade date square, there are no
rollovers because you have no position. The same is true if you never carry a
363
Chapter 3: The Mechanics of Currency Trading

Trading

position through the daily 5 p.m. ET close. Sounds simple enough, but things
get a bit more complicated when you consider weekends and holidays, when
banks are closed:
 Weekend rollovers: On Wednesday trade dates, spot currencies are 
normally trading for a Friday value date. At 5 p.m. ET on Wednesday, 
the value date changes from Friday to Monday, a weekend rollover. In
rollover calculations, that’s a three-day rollover (Saturday, Sunday, and
Monday), which means the rollover costs/gains are going to be three
times as much as any other day.
The one exception to the two-day spot convention in currency trading 
is trades in USD/CAD, which settle in one business day. The weekend
rollover for USD/CAD takes place on Thursday after the 5 p.m. ET close,
when the value date shifts from Friday to Monday. This applies only to
USD/CAD and not to other pairs involving CAD, such as CAD/JPY or
EUR/CAD.
 Holidays: Rollover periods can be longer if there is a banking holiday in
one of the countries whose currency is part of the trade. For example, 
if it’s Wednesday and you’re trading GBP/USD, the normal spot value
date would be Friday. But if UK banks aren’t open on Friday because of 
a holiday, the value date would change to Monday, skipping Friday’s hol-
iday. That’s a four-day rollover (Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday). A
few times each year (mostly around Christmas, New Year’s, and Golden
Week spring holidays in Japan), when multiple banking holidays in vari-
ous countries coincide over several days, rollover periods can be as
long as seven or eight days. So you may earn or pay rollovers of seven
or eight times normal on one day, but then not face any rollovers for the
rest of the holiday period.
Applying rollovers
Rollover transactions are usually carried out automatically by your forex
broker if you hold an open position past the change in value date. Rollovers
are applied to your open position by two offsetting trades that result in the
same open position. Some online forex brokers apply the rollover rates by
adjusting the average rate of your open position. Other forex brokers apply
rollover rates by applying the rollover credit or debit directly to your margin
balance.
Reading currency prices
Online brokerages display currency prices. Although different online forex
brokers use different formats to display prices on their trading platforms, the
info is the same.
364
Book V: Foreign Currency Trading 

Two prices appear for each currency pair. The price on the left-hand side is
called the bid, and the price on the right-hand side is called the offer (some
call this the ask). Some brokers display the prices above and below each
other, with the bid on the bottom and the offer on top. The easy way to tell
the difference is that the bid price will always be lower than the offer price.
The price quotation of each bid and offer you see has two components: the
big figure and the dealing price. The big figure refers to the first three digits of
the overall currency rate and is usually shown in a smaller font size or even
in shadow. The dealing price refers to the last two digits of the overall cur-
rency price and is brightly displayed in a larger font size (see Figure 3-1).
A spread is the difference between the bid price and the offer price. Most
online forex brokers use spread-based trading platforms for individual
traders. Think of it as the commission that the online brokers charge for exe-
cuting your trades. Spreads will vary from broker to broker and by currency
pairs at each broker as well. Generally, the more liquid the currency pair, the
narrower the spread; the less liquid the currency pair, the wider the spread.
This is especially the case for some of the less-traded crosses.
Executing a trade
There are two main ways of executing trades in the currency market: live
trades and orders.
Live trades
Live dealing is how you access the market to buy or sell at current market
rates. Knowing exactly what you want to do is important, because when you
make a live deal, it’s a done deal. If you make a mistake, you’ll have to make
another trade to correct your erroneous trade, and that is very likely going to
cost you real money.

Online dealing
Most forex brokers provide live streaming prices that you can deal on with a
simple click of your computer mouse. To execute a trade, simply specify the
amount of the trade you want to make and then click on the Buy or Sell
button. The forex trading platform will respond back, usually within a second
or two, to let you know whether the trade went through. If the trade goes
through, you have a position in the market and you’ll see your unrealized
profit and loss (P&L) begin updating according to market price fluctuations.
Some online brokers advertise narrower trading spreads as a way to attract
traders. If your click-and-deal trade attempts frequently fail, and the platform
then asks if you’d like to make the trade at a worse price, you’re probably
being re-quoted. Re-quoting is when brokers offer you a worse price to make
your trade, meaning you end up paying a larger spread than you bargained for.
Phone dealing
Placing live trades over the phone is available from most online forex bro-
kers. You need to find out from your broker whether it offers this service 
and exactly what its procedures are before you can be ready to use it. When
you place a trade over the phone, make sure you have your trading account
number and password and that you know what your position is. (If you’re not
sure, your broker will be able to give you this info, but be prepared for time
delays.) Then do the following:
1. Ask what the current price is for the currency pair you’re trading.
The broker’s representative will quote you a two-way bid/offer price,
such as “EUR/USD is trading at 1.3213/15.”
2. If you don’t want the price, say, “No, thank you”; if you do want the
price, specify exactly what trade you would like to make.
Note the direction (buy or sell), the amount (don’t use lots — use the
real amounts), and the currency pair. For example, “I would like to sell
140,000 EUR/USD.”
The broker should then say “Done” or “That’s agreed.”
3. Confirm with your broker exactly what trade you just made.
For example, say, “To confirm, I just sold 140,000 EUR/USD at 1.3213.”
Be sure the broker confirms the trade. You can double-check that the
trade was correct by asking the broker to input the trade and update
your position.
4. Get the name of the broker’s representative you just made the trade
with in case you have to call back.

Orders: Trading in absentia
If you’re not a full-time trader, then you’ve probably got a full-time job that
requires your attention when you’re at work. (At least your boss hopes he 
has your attention.) Orders are how you can act in the market without being
there. Not all order types are available at all online brokers, so add order
types to your list of questions to ask your prospective forex broker.
Using orders helps you capitalize on short-term market movements, as well
as limit the impact of any adverse price moves. A disciplined use of orders
also helps you quantify the risk you’re taking and, with any luck, gives you
peace of mind in your trading.
 Take-profit orders: You use take-profit orders to lock in gains when you
have an open position in the market. If you’re short USD/JPY at 117.20,
your take-profit order will be to buy back the position and be placed
somewhere below that price, say at 116.80 for instance. If you’re long
GBP/USD at 1.8840, your take-profit order will be to sell the position some-
where higher, maybe 1.8875. Partial take-profit orders are take-profit orders
that close only a portion of your open position, enabling you to take some
money off the table and lock in some gains. With two partial take-profit
orders, you can close the whole position at two different levels.
 Limit orders: A limit order is any order that triggers a trade at more
favorable levels than the current market price. Think “Buy low, sell
high.” If the limit order is to buy, it must be entered at a price below the
current market price. If the limit order is to sell, it must be placed at a
price higher than the current market price.
 Stop-loss orders: Stop-loss orders are critical to trading survival. The 
traditional stop-loss order stops losses by closing out an open position
that’s losing money. If you’re long, your stop-loss order will be to sell, but
at a lower price than the current market price. If you’re short, your stop-
loss order will be to buy, but at a higher price than the current market.
Most online forex brokers guarantee that your stop-loss order will be
executed at the order rate. To do so, they rely on the spread: Stop-loss
orders to sell are triggered if the broker’s bid price reaches your stop-
loss order rate; stop-loss orders to buy are triggered if the platform’s
offer price reaches your stop-loss rate. The benefit of this practice is
that some firms will guarantee against slippage on your stop-loss orders
in normal trading conditions. The downside is that your order will likely
be triggered earlier than stop-loss orders in other markets, so add in
some extra cushion when placing them on your forex platform.
 Trailing stop-loss orders: A trailing stop-loss order is a stop-loss order
that you set at a fixed number of pips from your entry rate. The trailing
stop adjusts the order rate as the market price moves, but only in the
direction of your trade. For example, if you’re long EUR/CHF at 1.5750 and
you set the trailing stop at 30 pips, the stop will initially become active
at 1.5720 (1.5750 – 30 pips). Essentially it lets you cut losing positions
quickly and let winning positions run.
367
Chapter 3: The Mechanics of Currency Trading
Book V

Currency

 One-cancels-the-other orders: A one-cancels-the-other order (more com-
monly referred to as an OCO order) is a stop-loss order paired with a
take-profit order. It’s the ultimate insurance policy for any open position.
Your position will stay open until one of the order levels is reached by
the market and closes your position. When one order level is reached
and triggered, the other order automatically cancels. OCO orders are
highly recommended for every open position.
 Contingent orders: A contingent order is a fancy term for combining sev-
eral types of orders to create a complete currency trade strategy. You
use contingent orders to put on a trade while you’re asleep, or other-
wise indisposed, knowing that your contingent order has got all the
bases covered and your risks are defined. Contingent orders are also
referred to as if/then orders. If/then orders require the if order to be
done first, and then the second part of the order becomes active, so
they’re sometimes called if done/then orders.
Online forex brokers accept your orders according to their trading policies,
which are spelled out in detail in the fine print in the contract you’ll have to
sign to open up an online trading account. The key feature of most brokers’
order policies is that your orders will be executed based on the price spread
of the trading platform. A limit order to buy, for example, will be filled only if
the trading platform’s offer price reaches your buy rate. A limit order to sell
will be triggered only if the trading platform’s bid price reaches your sell rate.
Profit and loss, up close and personal
If you’re going to trade currencies actively, you need to get up close and per-
sonal with P&L. Understanding how P&L works is especially critical to online
margin trading, where your P&L directly affects the amount of margin you
have to work with. Changes in your margin balance will determine how much
you can trade and for how long you can trade if prices move against you.
Margin balances and liquidations
When you open an online currency trading account, you need to pony up
cash as collateral to support the margin requirements established by your
broker. That initial margin deposit becomes your opening margin balance
and is the basis on which all your subsequent trades are collateralized.
Unlike futures markets or margin-based equity trading, online forex broker-
ages do not issue margin calls (requests for more collateral to support open
positions). Instead, they establish ratios of margin balances to open positions
that must be maintained at all times.
368
Book V: Foreign Currency Trading 

Be sure you completely understand your broker’s margin requirements and
liquidation policies. Some brokers’ liquidation policies allow for all positions
to be liquidated if you fall below margin requirements. Others close out the
biggest losing positions or portions of losing positions until the required
ratio is satisfied again. You can find the details in the fine print of the account
opening contract that you sign.
Unrealized and realized profit and loss
Most online forex brokers provide real-time mark-to-market calculations
showing your margin balance. Your margin balance is the sum of your initial
margin deposit, your unrealized P&L, and your realized P&L. Mark-to-market
is the calculation that shows your unrealized P&L based on where you could
close your open positions in the market at that instant. Realized P&L is what
you get when you close out a trade position, or a portion of a trade position.
Your unrealized P&L will continue to fluctuate based on the remaining open
positions and so will your total margin balance. If you’ve got a winning posi-
tion open, your unrealized P&L will be positive and your margin balance will
increase. If the market is moving against your positions, your unrealized P&L
will be negative and your margin balance will be reduced. Currency prices are
constantly changing, so your mark-to-market unrealized P&L and total margin
balance will also be constantly changing.
Calculating profit and loss with pips
Profit-and-loss calculations are pretty straightforward in terms of math — it’s
all based on position size and the number of pips you make or lose. A pip (or
point) is the smallest increment of price fluctuation in currency prices. In the
five-digit currency quote, the pip is the last itty-bitty digit:
 EUR/USD: 1.2853
 USD/CHF: 1.2267
 USD/JPY: 117.23
 GBP/USD: 1.9285
 EUR/JPY: 150.65
Looking at EUR/USD, if the price moves from 1.2853 to 1.2873, it’s just gone
up by 20 pips. If it goes from 1.2853 down to 1.2792, it’s just gone down by 
61 pips.
Pips provide an easy way to calculate the P&L. To turn that pip movement
into a P&L calculation, all you need to know is the size of the position. For a
100,000 EUR/USD position, the 20-pip move equates to $200 (EUR 100,000 ×
0.0020 = $200). For a 50,000 EUR/USD position, the 61-point move translates
into $305 (EUR 50,000 × 0.0061 = $305).
369
Chapter 3: The Mechanics of Currency Trading

Trading

True, online currency trading platforms calculate the P&L for you automati-
cally, but they do so only after you enter a trade. To structure your trade and
manage your risk effectively (How big a position? How much margin to risk?),
you need to calculate your P&L outcomes before you enter the trade.
Forces behind Forex Rates
On a daily basis, currency traders have to sort through myriad economic
reports, interpret the comments of political and financial officials from
around the world, take stock of geopolitical developments, and assess move-
ments in other financial markets. They do all this to help them determine
what direction major currencies are likely to move.
Currencies and interest rates
In currency trading, the guiding principle is “interest rates, interest rates,
interest rates.” Interest rates are important to currencies because they influ-
ence the direction of global capital flows and serve as benchmarks for what
investors expect to earn investing in a particular country. Currencies with
higher yields (higher interest rates) tend to go up, and currencies with lower
yields (lower interest rates) tend to weaken. The most significant overall
determinant of a currency’s value relative to other currencies is the nature
and direction of monetary policy set by a country’s central bank (explained
in the next section).
The future is now: Interest rate expectations
When it comes to currencies and interest rates, forex markets are focused
more on the direction of future interest rate moves (higher or lower) than
they are on the current levels because the current levels are already priced 
in by the market. So even though a currency may have a low interest rate,
market expectations of higher interest rates in the future frequently will
cause the currency to appreciate. The opposite is also true: A currency with a
relatively high interest rate frequently weakens if the market expects interest
rates in that country to move lower in the future.
The outlook period, or the time frame in which markets are expecting interest
rates to change, can span several months or quarters into the future. The far-
ther out the expected changes are on the horizon, however, the more limited
the impact on the currencies in the here and now. Speculation on interest
rate levels six months out tends to prompt relatively small adjustments that
are frequently lost in the day-to-day noise. But as the timing for anticipated
interest rate changes nears, currency speculation will reach a crescendo in
the immediate run-up (weeks and days) to the anticipated change.
370
Book V: Foreign Currency Trading 

Relative interest rates
You may be tempted to focus strictly on the level of a currency’s interest rate
as the basis for deciding whether the currency should move up or down. But
currency traders usually pay very little attention to absolute interest rates
and prefer to home in on one currency’s interest rate in relation to other 
currencies’ interest rates:
 Interest-rate differentials: In currency trading, markets are always
focused on currency pairs, or one currency’s value relative to another
currency. In this case, the difference between the interest rates of the
two currencies, known as the interest-rate differential, is the key spread
to watch. An increasing interest-rate differential will generally favor the
higher-yielding currency, while a narrowing interest-rate differential will
tend to favor the lower-yielding currency.
 Nominal and real interest rates: The interest rate to focus on is not always
just the nominal interest rate (the base interest rates you see, such as the
yield on a bond). Markets focus on real interest rates (inflation-adjusted
rates, which is the nominal interest rate minus the rate of inflation [usually
consumer price index]). So even though a bond may carry a nominal yield
of, say, 8.5 percent, if the annual rate of inflation in the country is 4.5 per-
cent, the real yield on the bond is closer to 4 percent.
One of the more popular (though potentially risky) long-term trade strate-
gies, known as a carry trade, is based on relative interest rates.
Monetary policy
Monetary policy is the set of policy actions that central banks use to achieve
their legal mandates. Most central banks function under legislative mandates
that focus on two basic objectives:
 Promoting price stability (a.k.a. restraining inflation)
 Promoting sustainable economic growth, sometimes with an explicit
goal of promoting maximum employment
Although it’s a no-brainer that promoting economic growth is more important
to those of us who work for a living, central bankers like to focus primarily on
inflation, and the primary lever of monetary policy is changes to benchmark
interest rates, such as the federal funds rate in the United States or the 
refinance rate in the Eurozone.

Expansionary or restrictive?
Changes in interest rates effectively amount to changes in the cost of money,
where higher interest rates increase the cost of borrowing and lower interest
rates reduce the cost of borrowing. The benchmark rates set by central
banks apply to the nation’s banking system and determine the cost of bor-
rowing between banks. Banks in turn adjust the interest rates they charge to
firms and individual borrowers based on these benchmark rates, affecting
domestic retail borrowing costs.
The main thrust (or bias, as markets call it) of monetary policy generally falls
into two categories: expansionary and restrictive. An expansionary monetary
policy aims to expand or stimulate economic growth, while a restrictive bias
aims to slow economic growth, usually to fight off inflation.
 Expansionary monetary policy: Expansionary monetary policy (also
known as accommodative or stimulative monetary policy) is typically
achieved through lowering interest rates (that is, reducing the costs of
borrowing in the hope of spurring investment and consumer spending).
Cutting interest rates is also known as easing interest rates and is fre-
quently summed up in the term easy monetary policy.
 Restrictive monetary policy: Restrictive monetary policy (also known
as contractionary or tighter monetary policy) is achieved by raising, or
“tightening,” interest rates. Higher interest rates increase the cost of bor-
rowing and work to reduce spending and investment with the aim of
slowing economic growth.
Identifying monetary policy cycles
Changes in monetary policy usually involve many small shifts in interest
rates (because central bankers are increasingly reluctant to shock an econ-
omy by adjusting interest rates too drastically) that play out over extended
periods of time, ranging from quarters to years. Still, given the significance of
monetary policy to currencies, currency traders devote a great deal of atten-
tion trying to divine the intentions of central bankers. Fortunately, central
bankers communicate with the markets in a number of ways: rate decisions,
policy statements or guidance, and public speeches.
Currency traders need to be aware of and constantly follow the current
market thinking on the direction of interest rates because of the strong 
relationship between interest rates and currency values. The best way to 
do this is to follow market commentaries in print and online news media,
always keeping in mind that such outlets (especially print) are usually one
step behind the current market. This makes online news commentaries that
much more relevant. Some of the best sites for timely insights and market
reporting are Bloomberg.com, Reuters.com, and MarketWatch.com. Best of
all, these sites are free.
372
Book V: Foreign Currency Trading 

Interpreting monetary policy communications
Central bankers are keenly aware that their comments have the ability to
move, and potentially disrupt, financial markets all over the world. So they
choose their words very carefully, leaving traders to act as interpreters.
Before you start interpreting monetary policy statements and commentary, 
it helps to know the following:
 When the head of the central bank gives an update on the economy or
the outlook for interest rates, listen up. A scheduled speech by the chair
of the Fed, for instance, is likely to be preceded by market speculation
similar to that of a major economic data report. And the reaction to his
comments can be equally sharp.
 Markets typically refer to central bankers in terms of being hawks or
doves: A hawk is someone who generally favors an aggressive approach
and tends to be fixated on fighting inflation. A dove tends to stress
growth and employment. If a hawk is slated to speak on the outlook for
monetary policy, and he downplays the threats from inflation or sug-
gests that inflationary pressures may be starting to recede, pay atten-
tion. Markets will jump all over dovish comments coming from a hawk,
and vice versa with hawkish comments made by a dove.
Official currency policies and rhetoric
After considering monetary policy and interest rates, the next biggest influ-
ences on currency values are government policies or official stances regard-
ing the value of individual currencies. National governments have a great deal
at stake when it comes to the value of their currencies. After all, in a sense, a
nation’s currency is the front door to its economy and financial markets. If
the currency is viewed as unstable or too volatile, it’s tantamount to slam-
ming the front door shut. And no major economy can afford to do that today.
Currency market intervention
In every big-bank currency trading room in major financial centers, there is 
a direct line to the open market trading desk of the central bank. When that
line lights up, the whole dealing room erupts. That line is reserved for open
market intervention by the central bank, and when it rings, it usually means
only one thing: The central bank is intervening in the market.
Intervention refers to central banks buying or selling currencies in the open
market to drive currency rates in a desired direction. Direct intervention in
the market is usually taken only as a last resort. It also may be a stopgap
measure to stabilize markets upset by extreme events, such as a terrorist
attack or rumors of a financial institution’s failure. When it’s not necessitated
by emergency circumstances, markets are generally aware of the increasing
risks of intervention.
373
Chapter 3: The Mechanics of Currency Trading
Book V
Foreign
Currency
Trading

Some of the more subtle forms of intervention are
 Verbal intervention or jawboning: These are efforts by finance ministry
or central bank officials to publicly suggest that current market direc-
tions are undesirable. Basically, it amounts to trying to talk up or talk
down a particular currency’s value.
 Checking rates: This is the central bank’s open market desk ringing in
on the direct line to major currency banks’ trading desks. The traders
don’t know if it’s going to be a real intervention or not, but they still
react instinctively based on previously indicated preferences. Even
rumors of a central bank checking rates are enough to trigger a signifi-
cant market reaction.
In terms of actual open market intervention, there are several different forms
it can take, all depending on which and how many central banks are partici-
pating. The more the merrier; better still, there’s strength in numbers.
 Unilateral intervention: This is intervention by a single central bank to
buy or sell its own currency. Unilateral intervention is generally the least
effective form of intervention, because the government is perceived (usu-
ally correctly) to be acting alone and without the support of other major
governments. Markets will typically revert to the earlier direction after
the intervention has run its course to test the central bank’s resolve and
to see if it’s intent on stopping the move or simply slowing it.
 Joint intervention: This is when two central banks intervene together
to shift the direction of their shared currency pair. This is a clear sign to
markets that the two governments are prepared to work together to
alter the direction of that pair’s exchange rate.
 Concerted intervention: This is when multiple central banks join
together to intervene in the market simultaneously. This is the most
powerful and effective type of intervention, because it suggests unity of
purpose by multiple governments. Concerted intervention is not done
lightly by major central banks — and markets don’t take it lightly either.
It’s the equivalent of a sledgehammer to the head. Concerted interven-
tion frequently results in major long-term trend changes.
In terms of the impact of intervention, different governments are given differ-
ent degrees of respect by the market. Due to the frequency of past interven-
tions and constant threats of it, the Japanese tend to get the least respect.
The Bank of England, the Swiss National Bank, and the European Central
Bank (ECB) are treated with considerably more respect by markets, with the
ECB being the linchpin of credibility for the Eurozone. Finally, when the U.S.
Treasury (via the Fed) intervenes, it’s considered a major event, and the
market usually respects the intervention.
374
Book V: Foreign Currency Trading 

Geopolitical risks and events
Geopolitics is nothing more than a fancy word used to describe what’s going
on in the world at large. As it’s applied to the currency markets, geopolitics
tends to focus on political, military/security, or natural disruptions to the
global economy or individual regions or nations. Because currency markets
are the conduits for international capital flows, they’re usually the first to
react to international events, as global investors shift assets in response to
geopolitical developments.
As important as geopolitical issues are to the market’s overall assessment of
a currency’s value, they tend to have relatively short-run implications and
must be interpreted in light of other prevailing economic fundamentals.

Gathering and Interpreting
Economic Data
In This Chapter
 Reading key economic reports
 Making sense of the information you find
A
ny number of real-world forces are at work in the forex market at any
given moment: economic data, interest rate decisions, and geopolitical
events, to name just a few. And they all get filtered through the market’s col-
lective consciousness and translated into price movements. So, with a whole
raft of active participants and a whole slew of factors that impact it, how can
you make any sense at all of economic data you rely on to make sound trad-
ing decisions?
First, you become familiar with the key economic reports. Then you figure
out how to interpret the information the reports contain. Not necessarily
easy tasks, but vital — and the ones that this chapter focuses on. The goal of
this chapter is to give you a better understanding of the types of information
that move the market and a solid foundation to interpret the information and
apply it. In other words, by the end of this chapter, not only will you know
what reports to read, but how to read them.
First Up: A Model for Absorbing
Economic Data
The sooner you’re able to make sense of what a specific report means and
factor it into the bigger picture, the sooner you’ll be able to react in the
market. But, given the deluge of economic indicators you’ll encounter in the
forex market, it’s all too easy to get swept away in the details. The key is stay-
ing focused on these areas:

 The labor market: Jobs and job creation are the keys to the medium-
and long-term economic outlook for any country or economic bloc. No
matter what else is going on, always have a picture of the labor market
in the back of your mind. If jobs are being created, more wages are being
paid, consumers are consuming more, and economic activity expands. 
If job growth is stagnant or weak, long-run economic growth will typi-
cally be constrained, and interim periods will show varying degrees of
strength and weakness. Signs of broader economic growth will be seen
as tentative or suspect unless job growth is also present.
From the currency market point of view, labor market strength is typi-
cally seen as a currency positive, because it indicates positive growth
prospects going forward, along with the potential for higher interest
rates based on stronger growth or wage-driven inflation.
 The consumer: The economies of the major currencies are driven over-
whelmingly by personal consumption, accounting for 65 to 70 percent or
more of overall economic activity. Personal consumption (also known as
private consumption, personal spending, and similar impersonal terms)
refers to how people spend their money. In a nutshell, are they spending
more, or are they spending less?
 The business sector: Businesses and firms contribute directly to eco-
nomic activity through capital expenditures (for example, building 
factories, stores, and offices; buying software and telecommunications
equipment) and indirectly through growth (by hiring, expanding produc-
tion, and producing investment opportunities). Look at the data reports
coming from the corporate sector. (Keep in mind that manufacturing and
export sectors are more significant in many non-U.S. economies than
they are in the United States.)
Market-Moving Reports
This section gets down to the nitty-gritty data, explaining the major economic
data reports that you need to be familiar with. Each report is classified in
terms of its usual impact on the market.
The significance of individual reports rises and falls depending on the envi-
ronment, the market’s current focus, and a host of other factors. See the sec-
tion “Understanding Market Info and Anticipating Market Reactions” for
factors to consider as you try to make sense of it all.

Book V: Foreign Currency Trading 

Major U.S. reports
The United States is the world’s largest national economy, and the U.S. dollar
is on one side of 80 percent of currency trades. But that’s not why U.S. reports
come first. Nope, the aim here is to introduce the major economic reports
issued by every major currency country, using U.S. data as the example.
The main data reports of other major national economies essentially mirror
the U.S. data reports, but with some minor differences in calculation methods
or reporting. The upcoming section “Major international data reports” high-
lights other reports that are important in non-U.S. economies.
Labor market reports
Various labor market reports let you keep tabs on the job market. The
monthly U.S. employment report, the highlight of which is the non-farm pay-
rolls (NFP) report, gets the most attention. Non-farm Fridays, as they’re semi-
affectionately known, are among the most volatile trading days each month.

Rumors: Where there’s smoke, there’s fire
All financial markets love rumors. They tend to
come out after relatively extensive directional
moves or attempts to break through important
technical levels — attempts that subsequently
fail and see prices reverse direction. Here are
some of the forex market’s favorites:
 Whisper numbers: These are generally
unfounded rumors of economic data any-
where from a few minutes to a few hours
before the scheduled release time. They
tend to roil short-term positions opened in
anticipation of a report and influence the
market’s subsequent reaction to the report.
Whisper numbers are one reason to con-
sider avoiding the market going into a data
release.
 Large market orders: These rumors fre-
quently do hold water, but not always.
They’re typically associated with central
banks or large institutional players buying or
selling, and they usually mention a price
level.
 Terrorism rumors: Everything from suspi-
cious packages to building evacuations
sends a shudder through the market. These
rumors tend to have relatively small and
short-lived impacts on the currencies
involved (like GBP dipping on a London
subway evacuation). The USD tends to dip
slightly regardless of the location of the
rumored terror scare.
The trouble with rumors is that you have no
easy way to determine whether they’re true,
and even if you can, you have no way of being
certain of the price reaction. Just be aware that
an intraday move or test of a technical level is
underway, and have a relatively tight exit strat-
egy if the market turns tail.

Non-farm payroll report (Relevance: High)
The NFP report, also referred to as the establishment survey (because it’s
based on responses from companies), is the government’s primary report
assessing the overall labor market in the prior month. The main components
of the report are
 Change in non-farm payrolls: This NFP number accounts for 75 to 80
percent of total U.S. employment, excluding government, self-employed,
and farm workers, among other categories. The going wisdom is that the
U.S. economy needs to add an average of 100,000 to 150,000 jobs each
month to keep the unemployment rate steady. The market’s initial reac-
tion is based on the difference between the actual and the forecast
change in non-farm payroll workers.
 Unemployment rate: The unemployment rate measures unemployed
individuals seeking work as a percentage of the civilian labor force.
Increases in the unemployment rate are typically interpreted as a sign of
weakness in the labor market and the economy overall, while declines in
the rate are considered a positive indicator of the job situation.
 Change in manufacturing payrolls: Measures the number of jobs added
or lost in manufacturing industries and is looked at as a gauge of near-
term production activity.
 Average hourly earnings: Measures the change in employee wages and
is viewed as an indicator of whether incomes are rising or falling and the
implications for consumer spending.
 Average weekly hours: Measures the average number of hours worked
each week and is looked at as a rough gauge of the demand for labor,
with increasing weekly hours seen as a positive for the labor market.
ADP national employment report (Relevance: Medium)
The ADP report is intended to serve as an alternative measurement of the
labor market, but it’s a relative newcomer, having debuted in mid-2006. Early
discrepancies between the ADP report and the NFP report have left market
participants uncertain about how much weight to give the ADP report. At the
moment, it produces little market reaction on its own. Instead, the market
may adjust its forecasts for the NFP depending on what the ADP indicates.
Weekly initial unemployment claims (Relevance: Low)
Initial jobless claims represent first-time filings for unemployment insurance.
The changes in initial claims can be volatile on a week-to-week basis, so ana-
lysts look at a four-week moving average of initial claims to factor out one-off
events. Still, sharp increases or declines in initial claims data will get the
market’s attention. A second part of the weekly claims report is continuing
claims, which is a measure of the total number of people receiving unemploy-
ment benefits, excluding first-time filers. The market looks at continuing
380
Book V: Foreign Currency Trading 

claims as another gauge of labor market conditions, with increases in contin-
uing claims typically suggesting deterioration in the job market and declines
in continuing claims suggesting an improvement.
Inflation gauges
Inflation reports are used to monitor overall changes in price levels of goods
and services. Increases in inflation are likely to be met with higher interest
rates (as central-bank policy makers seek to stamp out inflation), while mod-
erating or declining inflation readings suggest generally lower interest-rate
expectations.
There are a number of different inflation reports, with each focused on a dif-
ferent source of inflation or stage of the economy where the price changes
are appearing. The main inflation reports to keep an eye on are
 Consumer price index (CPI) (Relevance: High): The CPI measures the
cost of a basket of goods and services at the consumer or retail level —
the prices we’re paying. The CPI is looked at as the final stage of inflation.
 Producer price index (PPI) (Relevance: Medium): The PPI measures the
change in prices at the producer or wholesale level, or what firms are
charging one another for goods and services. The PPI may serve as a
leading indicator of overall inflation.
 Personal consumption expenditure (PCE) (Relevance: High): The PCE
is roughly equivalent to the CPI in that it measures the changes in price
of a basket of goods and services at the consumer level, but it’s pre-
ferred by the Federal Reserve as its main inflation gauge because the
composition of items in the PCE basket changes more frequently than in
CPI, reflecting evolving consumer tastes and behavior.
 Institute for Supply Management (ISM) prices paid index (Relevance:
Medium): The national and regional purchasing managers indices have
subcategories reporting on the level of prices paid and the level of
prices received by firms. The prices-paid component usually gets the
most attention as another corporate-level indication of price pressures,
likely to be mirrored by the PPI.
Gross domestic product (Relevance: High)
Gross domestic product (GDP) measures the total amount of economic activ-
ity in an economy over a specified period, usually quarterly and adjusted for
inflation. The percentage change in GDP from one period to the next is looked
at as the primary growth rate of an economy. GDP is frequently calculated on
a quarterly basis but reported in annualized terms. That means a 0.5 percent
quarterly GDP increase would be reported as a 2 percent annualized rate of
growth for the quarter (0.5 percent × 4 quarters = 2 percent). The use of
annualized rates is helpful for comparing relative growth among economies.
381
Chapter 4: Gathering and Interpreting Economic Data
Book V

Currency
Trading

In most countries, GDP is reported on a quarterly basis, so it’s taken as a big-
picture reality check on overall economic growth. The market’s economic
outlook will be heavily influenced by what the GDP reports indicate. Better-
than-expected growth may spur talk of the need for higher interest rates,
while steady or slower GDP growth may suggest easier monetary policy
ahead. At the same time, though, GDP reports cover a relatively distant eco-
nomic past — a quarter’s GDP report typically comes out almost midway
through the next quarter and is looking back at economic activity three to
four months ago. As a result, market expectations continue to evolve based
on incoming data reports, so don’t get too caught up in GDP for too long after
its initial release.
Trade and current account balances
Two of the most important reports for the forex markets are trade balance
and current account balance:
 Trade balance (Relevance: High) measures the difference between 
a nation’s exports and its imports. If a nation imports more than it
exports, it’s said to have a trade deficit; if a nation exports more than 
it imports, it’s said to have a trade surplus.
 Current account balance (Relevance: High) is a broader measure of
international trade and includes financial transfers as well as trade in
goods and services. Current accounts are also either in deficit or sur-
plus, reflecting whether a country is a net borrower or lender to the rest
of the world. Nations with current account deficits are net borrowers;
those with current account surpluses are net lenders.
Countries with persistently large trade or current account deficits tend to see
their currencies weaken relative to other currencies, while currencies of
countries running trade surpluses tend to appreciate.
Leading economic indicators (Relevance: Low)
The index of leading economic indicators (LEI) is based on ten components
that typically lead overall economic developments, such as initial unemploy-
ment claims, average hourly wages, and consumer sentiment, to single out
just a few. The LEI index is looked at as a gauge of the economy’s direction
over the next six to nine months. Increases in the index point to stronger
growth in the months ahead, while declines in the index point to likely future
weakness. Because eight of the ten components in the index are known in
advance of its release, the LEI index tends to have a subdued market impact,
but it’s still useful to guide future expectations.
382
Book V: Foreign Currency Trading 

Institute for Supply Management and purchasing managers reports
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) calculates several regional and
national indices of current business conditions and future outlooks based 
on surveys of purchasing managers. ISM readings are based on a boom/bust
scale with 50 as the tipping point: A reading above 50 indicates expansion,
while a reading below 50 signals contraction.
The main ISM reports to keep an eye on are
 Chicago Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) (Relevance: Low): The
Chicago PMI is the first of the national PMIs to be reported, and the
market frequently views it as a leading indicator of the larger national ISM
manufacturing report, which is released a few days after the Chicago PMI.
 ISM manufacturing report (Relevance: Medium): This report includes a
prices-paid index, which is viewed as an interim inflation reading, along
with other key subsector measurements, like the employment situation.
The market tends to react pretty aggressively to sharp changes in the
report or if the ISM is moving above or below 50, but because the manu-
facturing sector accounts for a relatively small portion of overall U.S.
economic activity, the importance of the ISM manufacturing gauge tends
to be exaggerated.
 ISM nonmanufacturing report (Relevance: Medium): The ISM non-
manufacturing report is the monthly ISM report that covers the other 80
percent of the U.S. economy. The ISM manufacturing report may get more
attention, but the ISM nonmanufacturing report is the one to focus on.
Consumer sentiment and spending reports
Consumer psychology is at the heart of the market’s attempts to interpret
future consumer activity and, with it, the overall direction of the economy.
The theory is that if you feel good, you’ll spend more, and if you feel lousy,
you’ll stop spending. The market likes to pay attention to consumer confi-
dence indicators even though there is little correlation between how con-
sumers tell you they feel and how they’ll actually go on to spend.
Consumer sentiment reports
The key confidence gauges are
 Consumer confidence index (Relevance: Medium): A monthly report
issued by the Conference Board comprised of the expectations index
(looking six months ahead) and the present-situation index. The surveys
ask households about their outlooks for overall economic conditions,
employment, and incomes.
 University of Michigan consumer sentiment index (Relevance:
Medium): Comes out twice a month: a preliminary reading in the middle
of the month and a final reading at the start of the next month.

Personal income and personal spending (Relevance: Medium)
Personal income includes all wages and salaries, along with transfer payments
(like Social Security or unemployment insurance) and dividends. Personal
spending is based on personal consumption expenditures for all types of 
individual outlays. The market looks at these two monthly reports to get an
update on the health of the U.S. consumer and the outlook for personal con-
sumption going forward.
Personal income is watched as a leading indicator of personal spending on
the basis that future spending is highly correlated with personal income. The
greater the increases in personal income, the more optimistic the consump-
tion outlook will be, and vice versa. But it’s important to note that inflation-
adjusted incomes are the key. If incomes are just keeping pace with inflation,
the outlook for spending is less positive.
Retail sales (Relevance: High)
The monthly advance retail sales report is the primary indicator of personal
spending in the United States, covering most every purchase Americans
make, from gas station fill-ups to dinner out and a night at the movies. These
reports are subject to a variety of distorting effects, most commonly from
weather. Stretches of bad weather, such as major storms or bouts of unsea-
sonable cold or heat, can impair consumer mobility or alter shopping pat-
terns, reducing retail sales in the affected period. Sharp swings in gasoline
prices can also create illusory effects, such as price spikes leading to an
apparent increase in retail sales due to the higher per-gallon price, while
overall non-gas retail sales are reduced or displaced by the higher outlays 
at the pump.
Durable goods orders (Relevance: Medium)
Durable goods reports measure the amount of orders received by manufac-
turers that produce items made to last at least three years. Durables are gen-
erally bigger-ticket purchases, such as washing machines and furniture, so
they’re also looked at as a leading indicator of overall consumer spending. 
If consumers are feeling flush with cash and confidence, big-ticket spending 
is more common. If consumers are uncertain, or times are tight, high-cost
purchases are the first to be postponed.
Housing-market indicators
There’s a raft of monthly housing market reports to monitor the sector, based
on whether the homes are new or existing:
384
Book V: Foreign Currency Trading 

 Existing-home sales (Relevance: High) is reported by the National
Association of Realtors (NAR). Sales of preexisting homes (condos
included) account for the lion’s share of residential real estate activity —
about 85 percent of total home sales. Existing-home sales are reported
on an annualized rate, and the market looks at the monthly change in
that rate. Median home prices and the inventory of unsold homes are
important clues to how the housing market is evolving. Existing-home
sales are counted after a closing. (Pending home sales are a separate
report viewed as a leading indicator of existing home sales and are
counted when a contract is signed to buy an existing home.)
 New-home sales (Relevance: Medium), reported on an annualized basis,
account for about 15 percent of residential home sales. New home sales
are counted when a contract is signed to purchase the new home, which
means that contract cancellations (not reported) may result in lower
actual sales than originally reported.
 Housing starts (Relevance: Medium) measure the number of new-home
construction starts that took place in each month, reported on an annu-
alized rate. Housing starts are considered a leading indicator of new-
home sales but more recently have been looked at as an indication of
home builder sentiment, as builders try to reduce inventories of unsold
new homes.
 Building permits (Relevance: Medium) are reported alongside housing
starts each month. Building permits are viewed as another leading indi-
cator of housing starts and new-home sales.
Regional Federal Reserve indices
A number of the Federal Reserve district banks issue monthly surveys of
business sentiment in their regions, usually concentrated on the manufactur-
ing sector. Responses above zero indicate that conditions are improving, and
readings below zero indicate deterioration. The main regional Fed indices to
watch are
 Philadelphia Fed index (Relevance: Medium): Usually the first of the
major Fed indices to be reported each month, covering the manufactur-
ing sector in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware.
 New York Empire State index (Relevance: Medium): Assesses New York
state manufacturers’ current and six-month outlooks.
 Richmond Fed manufacturing index (Relevance: Low): A composite
index based on new orders, production, and employment, covering the
Middle Atlantic states.

The Fed’s Beige Book (Relevance: High)
The Beige Book is a compilation of regional economic assessments from the
Fed’s 12 district banks, issued about two weeks before every Federal Open
Market Committee (FOMC) policy-setting meeting. The regional Fed banks
develop their summaries based on surveys and anecdotal reporting of local
business leaders and economists, and the report is then summarized by one
of the Fed district banks, all of which take turns issuing the report. The Beige
Book is designed to serve as the basis of economic discussions at the upcom-
ing FOMC meeting. Markets look at the Beige Book’s main findings to get a
handle on how the economy is developing:
 Is the economy expanding or contracting? How fast and how widespread?
 Which sectors are strongest, and which sectors are weakest?
 Are there any signs of inflation?
 How does the labor market look?
Major international data reports
Plenty of national data reports don’t have an equivalent in the United States,
and others are followed more closely in local markets and require extra atten-
tion. The next few sections highlight the main data reports of other national
economies.
Eurozone
The main data reports out of the Eurozone are remarkably similar to those of
the United States. The key difference is that individual European countries
report national economic data, which comes out alongside Eurozone-wide
reports from the European Commission or other pan-European reporting
agencies, like the European Central Bank (ECB). Don’t panic, though — you
don’t have to start monitoring Irish CPI and Dutch retail sales unless you’re
trading securities of those countries.
Because the Eurozone has a common currency and central bank, the forex
market focuses primarily on Eurozone indicators that cover the entire region,
such as Eurozone industrial production and trade balance. Among individual
national reports, the market concentrates on the key reports from the largest
Eurozone economies: Germany; France; and, to a lesser extent, Italy. Keep a
close eye on all the major data reports coming out of those countries.
The only European reports that may escape your attention due to unusual
names are the principal European confidence indicators, which go by the
acronyms of the groups that put them together. These reports can generate
sizeable reactions when they’re out of line with expectations:
386
Book V: Foreign Currency Trading 

 ZEW and GfK sentiment surveys (Relevance: Medium) are two sepa-
rate consumer confidence gauges issued by private research firms
known by their initials (ZEW and GfK). They’re reported for Germany
and France and on a Eurozone-wide basis.
 IFO sentiment survey (Relevance: Medium) is a corporate sentiment
survey that queries businesses across Germany on current sentiment
and how business is expected to develop over the next six months. The
IFO survey is put out by the IFO Institute, a private think tank in Munich,
and covers only Germany.
Japan
In addition to following all the usual reports, pay special attention to indus-
trial production and manufacturing data because of their large role in the
Japanese economy (which is heavily export-oriented). Outside the standard
reports to watch, keep an eye on the following:
 Tankan index (Relevance: High): This is the big corporate sentiment
survey in Japan, issued by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) after surveying some
10,000+ Japanese firms on their outlook. The Tankan is reported as a 
diffusion index, where negative responses are subtracted from positive
responses, resulting in a net reading — the higher the Tankan index, the
more optimistic the outlook. The Tankan survey produces four readings:
current conditions and future outlook from both large manufacturers
and large nonmanufacturers. The large all-industry capital expenditures
survey is an important gauge of capital spending and is often the focus
of the entire Tankan survey.
 Trade balance (Relevance: High): Japan’s monthly trade balance is
nearly always in surplus. The size of that surplus carries indications 
for the health of the export sector as well as potential political repercus-
sions against excessive JPY weakness when the trade surplus is seen to
be too large.
 All-industry and tertiary industry (services) indices (Relevance:
Medium): These are monthly sentiment gauges of industrial and service-
sector firms.
United Kingdom
Be alert for the following reports that can trigger sharp reactions in GBP:
 Bank of England minutes (Relevance: High): Released two weeks after
each Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting, they show the voting
results for the most recent decision. Market expectations and GBP are
frequently upended when the policy vote shows dissent (not all mem-
bers voted for the action) or unanimity.
387

 GfK consumer confidence and Nationwide consumer confidence
(Relevance: Medium): These are two separate consumer-sentiment
gauges put out by GfK, a UK/European marketing agency, and the
Nationwide Building Society, a UK mortgage lender.
 Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) house price balance
(Relevance: Medium): This monthly housing market survey shows the
proportion of real-estate agents reporting a rise in housing prices minus
those indicating a decline.
 CBI distributive trades survey and industrial trends survey
(Relevance: Medium): These two monthly reports are put out by the
Confederation of British Industry, a private trade group. The distributive
trades survey is a measure of retail sales, and the industrial trends
survey is a survey of manufacturers’ current and future outlook.
 British Retail Consortium (BRC) retail sales monitor and shop price
index (Relevance: Medium): These two monthly reports are put out by
the British Retail Consortium, a private trade organization. The retail
sales monitor is another measure of retail sales, and the shop price
index measures inflation at the retail level.
Canada
Canadian data mirrors U.S. data in many respects, but here are few other
important Canadian indicators to watch:
 International securities transactions (Relevance: High): This is roughly
the equivalent of the U.S. Treasury’s TIC report, showing net investment
flows into and out of Canada on a monthly basis. High inflows typically
support the CAD, and outflows tend to hurt it.
 International merchandise trade (Relevance: Medium): Canada’s trade
balance is especially significant due to the size of the manufacturing and
export sectors.
 Ivey purchasing managers index (Relevance: Medium): This key
monthly sentiment gauge of Canadian businesses is issued by the
Richard Ivey Business School.
Australia
Australian data reports exert a strong influence on Aussie, similar in many
respects to how UK data affects the pound. In particular, keep an eye on
 Westpac consumer confidence and National Australia Bank (NAB)
business confidence (Relevance: Medium): These two monthly senti-
ment gauges are put out by two of Australia’s leading banks.
 Trade balance (Relevance: Medium): Australia’s trade balance is criti-
cal due to the significance of the export sector and the relatively small
size of the economy, which means that trade deficits tend to hurt the
AUD more than surpluses support it.
388
Book V: Foreign Currency Trading 

Switzerland
Swiss data reports are generally fewer but fit the standard data bill of fare.
Swiss data tends to have the greatest impact on EUR/CHF, especially if the
two economies are seen to be diverging, either in economic growth or inter-
est rates. The most important Swiss data report outside the usual suspects is
the KOF Swiss Leading Indicator (Relevance: Medium). The KOF is an index
of six indicators intended to forecast the outlook over the next six to nine
months. The index is calculated by the KOF Technical Institute in Zurich.
New Zealand
New Zealand data is similarly provocative for the Kiwi, and inflation reports
are among the most significant due to the relatively high level of benchmark
interest rates. In addition to the other main data reports, keep an eye on the
following Kiwi-specific data:
 Australia New Zealand (ANZ) business New Zealand (NZ) purchasing
managers index (PMI) (Relevance: Medium): A monthly survey of pur-
chasing managers’ (corporate) sentiment issued by ANZ Banking Group.
 Trade balance (Relevance: High): New Zealand’s trade balance is also
critical due to the relatively small size of the economy and the impor-
tance of exports.
 Westpac New Zealand consumer confidence (Relevance: Medium): A
monthly consumer sentiment index released by Westpac Banking
Corporation.
Understanding Market Info and
Anticipating Market Reactions
Fundamental economic data reports are among the more significant informa-
tion inputs because policy makers and market participants alike use them to
gauge the state of the economy, set monetary policy, and make investment
decisions. While you may have a decent idea of what certain economic
reports mean, you may not feel comfortable that you can really make sense
of what you read and hear. The following sections can help you out by not
only explaining the prism through which market info is filtered, but also
explaining how the market tends to react.

Deciphering market themes
At any given moment in the forex market, several themes dominate the
market’s attention. Market themes are the essence of the real-world forces
currently driving the market. Themes are what market commentators and
analysts are talking about when they explain what’s happening. But most
important, themes are the filters through which new information and data are
absorbed by the market. Or to put it another way, they’re the lenses through
which the market sees events and data.
Market themes come in all shapes and sizes; some are long-term themes that
can color the market’s direction for months and years; others may hold sway
for only a few hours, days, or weeks. Market themes come in two main forms
that coexist in parallel universes and also frequently overlap:
 Fundamental themes: Each currency has its own set of fundamental cir-
cumstances in which it’s being evaluated by the market. The basic funda-
mental environment is ever-present, but it’s also subject to change over
time, just as economic conditions will change in the course of business
cycles. Fundamental themes will also shift in relative importance to one
another, with certain themes being pushed to the side for a period when
news or events focus the market’s attention on other, more pressing
themes. The following sections explain the main fundamental themes.
 Technical themes: The prevalence of technical analysis as the basis for
many trading decisions can add weight to existing fundamental-driven
moves, generating yet another theme to propel the move: the technical
theme. It may be a trending market movement that attracts trend-following
traders who don’t give a hoot about the underlying fundamentals. As
long as the technical trend is in place, they keep pushing the market in
the direction it’s going, prolonging the price adjustment perhaps far
beyond what the fundamentals would dictate. For information on techni-
cal analysis, see Book VIII.
Rising or falling interest rates
Because interest rates are usually the single most important determinant of 
a currency’s value, markets are constantly speculating about their direction.
But it’s not just about where interest rate levels are now, though that’s still
important (higher interest rate currencies tend to do better against lower-
yielding currencies). What matters most is their overall direction (whether
they’re going up or down), their future level (how high or low they’re likely to
go), and the timing of any changes (how fast rates are likely to change). The
effect of interest rate themes is most powerful when the interest rates of two
currencies are diverging — when one currency’s interest rate is expected to
move higher and the other lower.
390
Book V: Foreign Currency Trading 

When you’re looking at economic data or monetary policy rhetoric, always
assess information first in terms of what it means for the interest rates of 
the nation’s currency. A currency that’s expected to see lower rates in the
near future, for example, is likely to stop declining and may even rebound 
if an economic growth report or an inflation reading comes in higher than
expected. The market will pause to consider whether its outlook for lower
rates is correct.
Looking for growth
Economic growth prospects are the linchpin to a host of currency value
determinants, from the interest rate outlook to the attractiveness of a
nation’s investment climate (stocks and bonds). Strong economic growth
increases the likelihood of higher interest rates down the road. Weaker
growth data increases the prospect of potentially lower interest rates, as 
well as dampening the outlook for the investment environment.
There’s no set recipe for how growth data will impact a currency’s value, but
when the interest rate outlook is generally neutral, as in no solid conviction
on the direction of two countries’ rates, the growth theme becomes more
important.
Be aware that many growth data reports reflect only a particular sector of a
nation’s larger economy, such as the manufacturing sector or the housing
market. How significant the information is interpreted to be depends on how
significant that sector is to the larger national economy.
Fighting inflation
Inflation is the bogeyman to all central bankers. Even when inflation is low,
they still worry about it — it’s just part of the job. As a currency trader
attuned to monetary policy developments, you need to monitor inflation
readings as well.
When factoring inflation data into the interest rate theme, be aware of how
the overall growth theme is holding up. If growth is good, and inflation is high
because of economic strength, higher inflation readings will be currency 
supportive. If growth is slowing, and inflation is still too high, the currency
impact will be decidedly less positive and very likely downright negative.
(You may be wondering why currencies are so fickle, liking higher interest
rates some, but not all, of the time. The reason is the low-/slow-growth sce-
nario coupled with high/higher interest rates increases the risks of an econ-
omy dropping into recession, which would ultimately result in interest rate
cuts farther down the road.)

Gauging the strength of structural themes
Structural themes (the big-picture elements of how an economy is performing
or national events are playing out) are the most fleeting; they can be in full
force one day or for several weeks or months and then drop from the radar
screen altogether. These themes are also usually secondary to the interest
rates, growth, and inflation, but they can still exert significant influence on 
a currency. More important, they can amplify the impact of the primary
themes. Following are frequently recurring structural themes:
 Employment: Employment is the key to an economy’s long-run expan-
sion and a primary driver of interest rates. Sharp increases in unemploy-
ment are among the fastest triggers to interest rate cuts by central
bankers, going back to the primary interest rate theme.
 Deficits: Both fiscal and trade deficits are typically currency negatives.
During times of low/slow growth, the impact of deficits can be magnified,
as the very credibility of a currency can be questioned. During times of
steady/high growth, their impact tends to be more muted, but they are
still a negative hanging over the outlook.
 Geopolitical issues: The USD is the currency most vulnerable to geo-
political issues, given the size of the U.S. economy, its reliance on world
trade, and the potential for military involvement. After geopolitical 
tensions subside, the market is quick to revert to preexisting themes.
 Political elections or uncertainty: Changes of government and political
uncertainty in the major-currency countries can certainly dent the
market’s sentiment toward the affected currency. The impact on the cur-
rency will usually be felt on the margins, hurting a softening currency and
restraining an appreciating one. But shortly after the political situation is
resolved, political issues tend to fade quickly into the background.
Recognizing reporting conventions
The data that you find in economic textbooks is very neat and clean, but the
data as it actually arrives in the market can be anything but neat and clean.
We’re talking here not only about the imperfections of economic data gather-
ing, which relies heavily on statistical sampling methods, but also about how
the market interprets individual data reports.
In the following sections, we look at important data-reporting conventions
and how they can affect market reactions. When currencies don’t react to 
the headlines of a data report as you would expect, odds are that one of the
following elements is responsible, and you need to look more closely at the
report to get the true picture.
392
Book V: Foreign Currency Trading 

Comparing past and present: Data history
When you’re looking at upcoming economic data events, not only do you
need to be aware of what’s expected, but it also helps to know what, if any,
trends are evident in the data series. The key is to first be aware of prior-
period revisions and to then view them relative to the incoming data. Things
to keep in mind:
 The more pronounced or lengthy the trend is, the more likely the reac-
tions to out-of-line economic reports will prove short lived. The more
ambiguous or fluid the recent data has been, the more likely the reaction
to the new data will be sustained.
 See whether the data in the new report revises the data from the prior
period, in which case the market tends to look at the two reports
together. If a current report comes out worse than expected, and the
prior report is revised lower as well, the two together are likely to be
interpreted as very disappointing. If a current report comes out better
than expected, but the prior period’s revision is negative, the positive
reaction to the most recent report will tend to be restrained by the
downgrade to the earlier data.
 The larger the revision to the prior report, the more significance it will
carry into the interpretation of the current release.
 Current data reports tend to receive a higher weighting by the market if
only because the data is the freshest available, and markets are always
looking ahead.
Getting to the core
A number of important economic indicators are issued on a headline basis
and a core basis. The headline reading is the complete result of the indicator,
while the core reading is the headline reading minus certain categories or
excluding certain items. In the case of inflation reports, for example, many
reporting agencies strip out or exclude highly volatile components, such as
food and energy. The rationale for ignoring those items is that they’re prone
to market, seasonal, or weather-related disruptions. By leaving them out, the
core reading is believed to paint a more accurate picture of structural, long-
term price pressures, which is what monetary-policy makers are most con-
cerned with.
Whenever you see a data report “ex-something,” it’s short for “excluding”
that something. In the United States, for instance, the consumer price index
(CPI) is reported on a core basis excluding food and energy, commonly cited
as CPI ex-F&E.
393
Chapter 4: Gathering and Interpreting Economic Data
Book V
Foreign
Currency
Trading

Markets tend to focus on the core reading over the headline reading in most
cases, especially where a known preference for the core reading exists on the
part of monetary-policy makers. The result can be large discrepancies
between headline data and the core readings, resulting in market reactions
that are similarly disjointed, with an initial reaction based on the headline
reading frequently followed by a different reaction to the core.
Watching early moves: Consensus 
expectations and pricing in and out
Data reports and news events don’t happen in a vacuum. Forex markets eval-
uate incoming data reports relative to market forecasts, commonly referred
to as consensus expectations or simply the consensus. Consensus expectations
are the average of economic forecasts made by economists from the leading
financial institutions, banks, and securities houses. News agencies like
Bloomberg and Reuters survey economists for their estimates of upcoming
data and collate the results. The resulting average forecast is what appears
on market calendars indicating what is expected for any given data report.
The consensus becomes the baseline against which incoming data will be
evaluated by the market. In the case of economic data, the market will com-
pare the actual result — the economic figure that’s actually reported — with
what was expected (the consensus). The actual data is typically interpreted
by the market as expected (or in line with expectations), better than expected,
or worse than expected. The degree to which a data report is better or worse
than expected is important. The farther off the mark the data report is, the
greater the likelihood and degree of a subsequent price shift following the
data release.
Players in the currency market don’t typically wait for news to actually be
released before they start trading on it. Currency traders begin to price con-
sensus expectations into the market anywhere from several days to several
hours before a report is scheduled. The more significant the report, the sooner
markets are likely to start pricing in expectations. Pricing in is the practice of
trading as though the data were already released and, usually, as though it has
come out as expected. But not always. Keep these things in mind:
 Sometimes the market doesn’t always price in an as-expected result.
Market sentiment may have soured (or improved) in the run-up to the
release, leading the market to price in a worse-than-expected (or better-
than-expected) report.

Book V: Foreign Currency Trading 

 Consensus estimates can sometimes change in the days leading up to
the report, based on other interim reports. This can lead to pricing out
of consensus expectations, depending on to what degree the consensus
was priced in.
 Data miss is the market euphemism for when a data report comes in 
outside expectations. If the consensus was for an improvement in a 
particular indicator, and the actual report is worse than expected or 
disappointing, the result may be a sharp reversal in price direction. The
same thing can happen in reverse if negative expectations are met by a
surprisingly positive data report.
To get a sense of how much the market has priced in any forecast, follow
market commentaries and price action in the hours and days before a sched-
uled report. Stay on top of the market reports to get a handle on the mood.
It frequently helps to think through the likely reactions to major data releases
to prepare for how the market may react in the very likely case that the data
surprises one way or the other. It’s a thoroughly academic exercise, but it
may just give you a significant leg up on the rest of the market if you’re
inclined to trade around data reports.

In This Chapter
 Identifying your own trading style
 Viewing the market — and your trades — dispassionately
 Keeping risk in perspective
 Knowing what to look for in a broker
S
un Tzu, author of the ancient The Art of War, a book of military strategy,
observed that every battle is won or lost before it even begins. That
same rationale applies to trading. And just as an army must know its
strengths and weaknesses to succeed, you have to get to know yours, too.
This chapter looks at various trading styles, provides tips to develop trading
discipline, and offers a practical plan for analyzing markets with an eye to
spotting trade opportunities. It also takes a hard look at risks beyond just
losing money, so you can be prepared for bumps in the road.
Finding a Trading Style That Suits You
We’re frequently asked, “What’s the best way to trade the forex market?”
Unfortunately, there is no easy answer. Better put, there is no standard
answer: one that applies to everyone. The forex market’s trading characteris-
tics have something to offer every trading style (long-term, medium-term, or
short-term) and approach (technical, fundamental, or a blend). In deciding
what style or approach, the starting point is not the forex market itself, but
your own individual circumstances and way of thinking.

Step 1: Know thyself
Before you can begin to identify a trading style and approach that works best
for you, you need to give some serious thought to what resources you have
available to support your trading. In other words, forex trading takes time
and money: What can you afford?
 Money: When it comes to money, trading capital has to be risk capital:
money that, if lost, will not materially affect your standard of living.
Obviously, borrowed money is not risk capital — never use borrowed
money for speculative trading.
When you determine how much risk capital you have available for 
trading, you’ll have a better idea of what size account you can trade 
and what position size you can handle. Most online trading platforms
typically offer generous leverage ratios that allow you to control a larger
position with less required margin. But just because they offer high
leverage doesn’t mean you have to fully utilize it.
 Time: If you’re a full-time trader, you have lots of time to devote to
market analysis and actually trading the market. But if your full-time job
is something other than trading, you have to do your market research in
your free time. Be realistic when you think about how much time you’ll
be able to devote on a regular basis, keeping in mind family obligations
and other personal circumstances.
Step 2: Technical or fundamental analysis?
Ask yourself on what basis you’ll make your trading decisions: fundamental
analysis, which relies on evaluating the underlying value and future potential
of the security, or technical analysis, which uses the tracking of price fluctua-
tions to predict or identify market trends? (For details on the different styles,
go to Books VII and VIII respectively.)
Sometimes forex markets seem to be more driven by fundamental factors,
such as current economic data or comments from a central bank official. 
In those times, fundamentals provide the catalysts for technical breakouts
and reversals. At other times, technical developments seem to be leading the
charge. So rather than take sides, why not follow an approach that blends the
two disciplines? Approaching the market with a blend of fundamental and
technical analysis can improve your chances of both spotting trade opportu-
nities and managing your trades more effectively.

Step 3: Pick a style, any style
After you’ve given some thought to the time and resources you’re able to
devote to currency trading and which approach you favor (technical, funda-
mental, or a blend), the next step is to settle on a trading style that best fits
those choices. The next sections explain three main trading styles, with
degrees of exposure to market risk. Keep in mind that styles frequently 
overlap, and you can adopt different styles for different trade opportunities
or different market conditions.
The two main elements of market risk are time and relative price movements.
The longer you hold a position, the more risk you’re exposed to. The more of
a price change you’re anticipating, the more risk you’re exposed to.
Short-term, high-frequency day trading
Short-term trading in forex typically involves holding a position for only a few
seconds or minutes and rarely longer than an hour. The goal is to profit by
repeatedly opening and closing positions after gaining just a few pips, fre-
quently as little as one or two pips. In the interbank market, extremely short-
term, in-and-out trading is referred to as jobbing the market; online currency
traders call it scalping. Traders who follow this style have these characteristics:
 They are among the fastest and most disciplined of traders. Their goal
is to capture only a few pips on each trade. Rapid reaction and instanta-
neous decision-making are essential to successfully jobbing the market.
Their motto is “Take the money and run” — repeated a few dozen times
a day.
 They have an intuitive feel for the market. (Some practitioners refer to
it as rhythm trading.) If you were to ask a scalper for her opinion of a par-
ticular currency pair, she would be likely to respond along the lines of “It
feels bid” or “It feels offered” (meaning, she senses an underlying buying
or selling bias in the market — but only at that moment). If you ask her
again a few minutes later, she may respond in the opposite direction.
 They have no allegiance to any single position. They couldn’t care less
if the currency pair goes up or down. They’re strictly focused on the
next few pips.
If you pursue a short-term trading strategy online, where dealing spreads can
equal profit targets, you need to be right by a larger margin. For that reason,
trading a short-term strategy online requires individual traders to invest
more time and effort in analyzing the overall market, especially from the 
technical perspective. Other tips for the short-term trader:
399
Chapter 5: Advice for Successful Forex Trading
Book V
Foreign
Currency
Trading

 Trade only the most liquid currency pairs, such as EUR/USD, USD/JPY,
EUR/GBP, EUR/JPY, and EUR/CHF, and focus your trading on only one
pair at a time.
 Trade only during times of peak liquidity and market interest, and avoid
trading around data releases.
 Look for a brokerage firm that offers click-and-deal trading so you’re not
subject to execution delays or requites.
 Preset your default trade size so you don’t have to keep specifying it on
each deal, and adjust your risk and reward expectations to reflect the
dealing spread of the currency pair you’re trading.
Medium-term directional trading
Medium-term positions are typically held for periods ranging anywhere from 
a few minutes to a few hours, but usually not much longer than a day. As with
short-term trading, the key distinction for medium-term trading is not the length
of time the position is open but the amount of pips you’re seeking/risking.
The essence of medium-term trading (sometimes referred to as momentum
trading and swing trading) is determining where a currency pair is likely to go
over the next several hours or days and constructing a trading strategy to
exploit that view. (Of course, although medium-term traders normally look to
capture larger relative price movements — say, 50 to 100 pips or more —
they’re also quick to take smaller profits on the basis of short-term price
behavior.)
Medium-term trading requires many of the same skills as short-term trading,
but it also demands a broader perspective, greater analytical effort, and a lot
more patience. Medium-term traders typically pursue one of the following
overall approaches, but there’s also plenty of room to combine strategies:
 Trading a view: Having a fundamental-based opinion on which way a
currency pair is likely to move (although view traders still need to be
aware of technical levels as part of an overall trading plan).
 Trading the technicals: Spotting trade opportunities on charts (but
these traders still need to be aware of fundamental events, which are 
the catalysts for many breaks of technical levels).
 Trading events and data: Basing positions on expected outcomes of
events, like a central bank rate decision or a G7 meeting. Event/data
traders typically open positions well in advance of events and close
them when the outcome is known.
 Trading with the flow: Trading based on overall market direction
(trend) or information of major buying and selling (flows). Flow traders
tend to stay out of short-term range-bound markets and jump in only
when a market move is underway.

Long-term macroeconomic trading
Long-term trading in currencies is generally reserved for hedge funds and
other institutional types with deep pockets. Long-term trading in currencies
can involve holding positions for weeks, months, and potentially years at a
time. Holding positions for that long necessarily involves being exposed to
significant short-term volatility that can quickly overwhelm margin trading
accounts. Still, with proper risk management, individual margin traders can
seek to capture longer-term trends. The key is to hold a small enough posi-
tion relative to your margin that you can withstand volatility of as much as 
5 percent or more. Mini accounts, which trade in lot sizes of 10,000 currency
units, are a good vehicle to take advantage of longer-term price trends.
Long-term trading seeks to capitalize on major price trends, which are in turn
the result of long-term macroeconomic factors:
 Interest rate cycles: Where are the two currencies’ relative interest
rates, and where are they likely to go in the coming months?
 Economic growth cycles: What’s the outlook for relative growth over
the next several months?
 Currency policies: Are the currencies considered to be excessively
overvalued or undervalued by the major global trading powers?
 Structural deficits or surpluses: Do the currencies have any major struc-
tural issues that tend to see currencies weaken or strengthen, such as
fiscal deficits/surpluses or trade deficits/surpluses?
Just because you’re trading with a long-term view doesn’t mean you can’t
take advantage of significant price changes when they’re in your favor in the
medium term. Trading around a core position refers to taking profit on a por-
tion of your overall position after favorable price changes. You continue to
hold a portion of your original position — the core position — and look to
reestablish the full position on subsequent market corrections.
It never hurts to take some money off the table when you’re winning. The risk
with trading around a core position is that the trend may not correct after
you’ve taken partial profit, never giving you the chance to reestablish your
desired full position. But you’re still holding the core of your position, and
because the market hasn’t corrected, it means your core position is doing
just fine.
Developing Trading Discipline
No matter which trading style you decide to pursue, you need an organized
trading plan, a well-thought-out approach to executing a trade strategy, or
you won’t get very far. Any trading plan has three simple components:
401
Chapter 5: Advice for Successful Forex Trading
Book V
Foreign
Currency
Trading

 Determining position size: How large a position will you take for each
trade strategy? Position size is half the equation for determining how
much money is at stake in each trade.
 Deciding where to enter the position: Exactly where will you try to
open the desired position? What happens if your entry level is not
reached?
 Setting stop-loss and take-profit levels: Exactly where will you exit the
position, both if it’s a winning position (take profit) and if it’s a losing posi-
tion (stop loss)? Stop-loss and take-profit levels are the second half of the
equation that determines how much money is at stake in each trade.
Developing a trading plan and sticking to it are the two main ingredients of
trading discipline, the defining characteristic of successful traders. Traders
who follow a disciplined approach are the ones who survive year after year
and market cycle after market cycle. They can even be wrong more often
than right and still make money because they follow a disciplined approach.
Yet establishing and maintaining trading discipline is an elusive goal for many
traders.
Taking the emotion out of trading
When it comes to trading in any market, don’t underestimate the power of
emotions to distract and disrupt. Of course you can’t take all the emotion out
of trading. As long as your heart is pumping and your synapses are firing,
emotions are going to be flowing, and emotions can be pretty intense when
you’re trading. Because you can’t block out the emotions, the best you can
hope to achieve is limiting their impact on your trading. Do the following:
 Focus on the pips and not the dollars and cents. Don’t be distracted by
the exact amount of money won or lost in a trade. Instead, focus on
where prices are and how they’re behaving.
 Remind yourself it’s not about being right or wrong; it’s about making
money. At the end of the day, the market doesn’t care if you were right
or wrong, and neither should you. The only true way of measuring trad-
ing success is in dollars and cents.
 Accept that you’re going to lose in a fair number of trades. Taking
losses is as much a part of the routine as taking profits, and you can still
be successful over time.
 Don’t personalize what happens in the market. The market isn’t out to
get you; it’s going to do what it does whether you’re involved in it or not.
Interpret events professionally, just as you would the results of any
other business venture.

Managing your expectations
Before you get involved with trading currencies, you need to have a healthy
sense of what to expect when it comes to trading outcomes. The trading style
that you decide to pursue dictates the relative size of profits and losses that
you can expect to experience. If you’re trading on a short- to medium-term
basis, look at average daily trading ranges to get a good idea of what to expect.
The average daily trading range is a mathematical average of each day’s trad-
ing range (high to low) over a specified period. Keep in mind that this figure
is just a statistical average — there will be days with larger ranges and days
with narrower ranges. Also, average daily ranges will vary significantly by
currency pair.
Balancing risk versus reward
Trading is all about taking on risk to generate profits. Some trading books
advise people to use a risk/reward ratio, like 2:1, meaning that if you risk $100
on a trade, you should aim to make $200 to justify the risk. Others counsel
never to risk more than a fixed percentage of your trading account on any
single trade. But a better way to think about risk and reward is to look at
each trade opportunity on its own and assess the outcomes based on techni-
cal analysis. This approach has the virtue of being as dynamic as the market,
allowing you to exploit trade opportunities according to prevailing market
conditions.
Another factor to consider in balancing risk and reward is the use of leverage.
In online currency trading, generous leverage ratios of 100:1 or 200:1 are 
typically available. The higher the leverage ratio, the larger position you can
trade based on your margin. But leverage is a double-edged sword because 
it also amplifies profits and losses. The key is to limit your overall leverage
utilization so you’re not putting all your eggs in one basket. If you open the
largest position available based on your margin, you’ll have very little cush-
ion left in case of adverse price movements.
Keeping your ammunition dry
One of the biggest mistakes traders make is known as overtrading.
Overtrading typically refers to trading too often in the market or trading too
many positions at once. Both forms suggest a lack of discipline, and sound
more like throwing darts at a board and hoping something sticks. Keeping
your ammunition dry refers to staying out of the market, watching and wait-
ing, and picking your trades more selectively.

Using your margin collateral sparingly
The margin you’re required to post with your forex broker is the basis for all
your trading. The amount of margin you put up determines how large a posi-
tion you can hold and for how long (in pips) if the market moves against you.
Unless you just won the lottery, your margin collateral is a precious, finite
resource, so you have to use it sparingly.
Holding open positions not only exposes you to market risk but can also cost
you market opportunities. After you enter a position, your available margin 
is reduced, which in turn lowers the amount of available positions you can
establish. If you’re routinely involved in the market because you don’t want
to miss out on the next big move, you actually run the risk of missing out on
the next big move because you may not have enough available margin to sup-
port a position for the big move.
Missing a few opportunities — deliberately
Don’t be afraid to miss out on some trade opportunities. No one ever catches
all the moves. Instead, focus on your market analysis and pinpoint the next
well-defined trading opportunity. (We look at spotting trade setups in the
upcoming section “Analyzing trade setup to determine position size.”)
One virtue of trading less frequently is that your market outlook is not
skewed by any of the emotional entanglements that come with open posi-
tions. If you ask a trader who’s long EUR/USD what he thinks of EUR/USD, sur-
prise, surprise — he’s going to tell you he thinks it’s going up. That’s called
talking your book. But being out of the market, or being square, allows you to
step back and analyze market developments with a fresh perspective. That’s
when you can spot opportunities more clearly and develop an effective trade
strategy to exploit them.
Making Time for Market Analysis
The more regular your analysis, the greater the feel you’ll develop for where
the market has been and where it’s likely to go. Also, the more regularly you
update yourself on the market, the less time it takes to stay up to speed. At
the minimum, be prepared to devote at least an hour every day to looking at
the market and keeping tabs on upcoming data and events. A routine for reli-
able market analysis includes
 Multiple-time-frame technical analysis, which enables you to recognize
price channels. (Both are explained in the following sections.)
 Candlestick analysis after each daily and weekly close. (Head to Book
VIII for information on candlestick analysis.)
 Reading economic data reports that have come out overnight.
404
Book V: Foreign Currency Trading 

 Assessing the likely market impact of upcoming data reports and events.
 Reviewing market commentaries to stay on top of major themes and
overall market sentiment.
If the time you have to devote to market analysis is limited, focus your 
energies on only one or two currency pairs. As you become more adept at
analysis — or if your available time increases — you can follow and analyze
additional currency pairs.
Performing multiple-time-
frame technical analysis
You need to perform multiple-time-frame technical analysis to identify sup-
port and resistance levels and to track overall price developments. (For key
technical analysis principles and charting techniques, go to Book VIII.)
Multiple-time-frame technical analysis is nothing more complicated than
looking at charts using different time frames of data. The basic idea is to look
at the big picture first to identify the key longer-term features and then drill
down into shorter data time frames to pinpoint short-term price levels and
trends. Our own preference is to focus on daily, 4-hour, and 30-minute time
frames, but you can use whichever time frames you think best match your
trading style. Short-term traders, for instance, may want to focus on 2-hour,
30-minute, and 5-minute charts to better reflect the narrower time frames of
their trading.
Whichever time frames you end up working with, be sure to include longer
time frames, like daily and weekly, so you can get a sense of where the most
significant price levels are. The strength and significance of support and
resistance levels are a function of the time frame in which they’re evident,
with longer-term technical levels holding greater meaning than shorter ones.
You don’t want your focus to become so narrow that you lose sight of the big
picture and go with a break of short-term resistance, for instance, when
major daily or weekly resistance is just beyond.
Make sure the charting system you’re using has the ability to save trend lines
across time frames, meaning that a trend line you draw on a daily chart
should also appear on the four-hour and hourly charts, and vice versa. Also,
make sure the charting system has the ability to save the entire chart so you
don’t have to redraw the trend lines every time you pull up the same chart.
On subsequent updates, keep the trend lines that still appear to be valid
(meaning, price action has not broken through them), and erase trend lines
that are no longer active or have been broken. Over time, you’ll get an idea of
how good you are at spotting meaningful trend lines by the frequency with
which you have to discard old trend lines.

Looking for price channels
A price channel is a series of parallel trend lines that encapsulate price action
over a discernible period. Channels will form in all time frames, with long-
term channels on a daily chart highlighting multiday or multiweek trading
ranges, and short-term channels on an hourly chart revealing steady buying
or selling during a trading session. Price channels can also form in any direc-
tion, from horizontal to steeply sloping up or down and anything in between.
The whole point of looking for and drawing channel lines, of course, is to
highlight additional sources of support or resistance.
The way to identify price channels is through visual inspection, using your
eyes and imagination, as well as a fair amount of trial and error. Drawing
channels is made much easier by the Copy a Line and Parallel Line functions,
which are standard in most charting systems.
You can use channels as part of your trading strategy to guide both position
entry and exit. Short-term traders in particular like to use channels to trade
around a core position, for example, selling short on trend-line resistance and
buying a portion of the position back if prices drop to channel support. If the
channel continues to hold, they’ll resell on gains back toward trend-line resis-
tance, reestablishing their core short position. When channels break, it’s also
a sign that prices are accelerating in the direction of the trend, as shown by
the channel, or that the trend is reversing and prices break out of the channel
in the opposite direction.
Managing Your Trading Risk
Experienced traders calculate the risk they’re facing in every trade before
they ever enter it. It’s part of their decision-making DNA, and it goes a long
way toward determining which trade opportunities they pursue and which
ones they skip. By approaching the forex market with risk management as
your first thought, you’ll be able to get some trades wrong and still survive 
to get other trades right.
You’re probably not drawn to currency trading for the chance to lose money.
You’re interested in making money and are prepared to take some risks to 
do that. The question is how much risk you are prepared to accept. Because
you’re dealing with finite resources — namely, the amount of risk capital
you’ve devoted to your trading — you have a definite limiting factor to your
trading. If you eat through your trading capital, you’re done. So the starting
point of a risk-aware trading plan has to focus on the downside risks. It may
not be as fun as thinking about making millions, but it’ll make you a better
trader.
406
Book V: Foreign Currency Trading 

Analyzing trade setup to 
determine position size
A trade setup is a trade opportunity that you’ve identified through your analy-
sis. In every trade setup, you need to identify the price point where the setup
is invalidated — where the trade is wrong. If you’re looking to sell a currency
pair based on trend-line resistance above, for example, price gains beyond
the trend line would invalidate your rationale for wanting to be short. So the
price level of the trend line is the line in the sand for the overall strategy.
Now comes the entry point for the trade. Say that current market prices 
are 50 pips below the trend-line resistance you’ve identified. That means 
the market could move higher by 50 pips and your trade setup would still be
valid, but you’d be out of the money by 50 pips. You now have a clear delin-
eation of how much risk your trade setup would require you to assume. If you
get in now, you’re risking at least 50 pips. Alternatively, you could reduce that
risk by waiting and using an order to try selling at better levels — say, 25 pips
higher. If the market cooperates and your limit-entry order is filled, you’re
now risking only 25 pips before your trade setup is negated.
So how large a position should you commit to the trade? From a risk stand-
point, it all depends where you’re able to enter the trade relative to your
stop-out level.
Putting the risk in cash terms
After you’ve identified where your stop-loss point is — where the trade setup
is negated — and where you’re able to enter, you’re able to calculate the
amount of risk posed by the trade. Say you’re inclined to enter the position 
at current market levels, and your stop is 50 pips away. If you’re trading a
standard-size account (100,000 lot size), and the trade is in NZD/USD (where
profit and loss accrue in USD), each lot would translate into risking $500
(100,000 × 0.0050 NZD/USD pips = $500). If your margin balance is $10,000,
you’re risking 5 percent of your trading capital in this trade (frequently cited
in trading literature as the maximum risk in any one trade).
Considering other opportunity risks
Risk in the trading plan is not confined simply to losing money on the trade.
There are also opportunity risks from trade setups that you’re not able to
enter.

Identifying the trade entry points
Winning or losing on a trade is difficult if you never get into the position in
the first place, which makes identifying where to get into the trade one of the
most important steps in any trading plan. We like to use technical analysis as
the primary means of identifying entry levels. When looking to identify entry
points, focus on the following technical levels:
 Trend lines in various time frames (daily, four-hour, and hourly)
 Hourly highs and lows for short-term intraday position entries
 Daily highs and lows for medium- to longer-term positions
 Congestion zones
 Fibonacci retracements of prior price movements (38.2 percent, 
50 percent, 61.8 percent, and 76.4 percent)
 Spike highs and lows
If you’re not familiar with Fibonacci retracements (which refer to a theory
that prices are likely to retrace a large portion of an original move based
upon certain ratios), check out www.fibonacci.com.
Establishing stop losses with foresight
The stop-loss level is the starting point in any trade plan from an overall risk
perspective. It’s the point where the trade setup is negated and the strategy
fails. When considering where to place the stop level, be aware that the cur-
rency market, like most financial markets, has a tendency to try to take out
levels where stop losses are likely to be located. Nothing is worse than having
the right strategy but being taken out by a short-term, stop-loss-driven price
move that eventually reverses and goes in the direction of your outlook.
To guard against the risk of being unnecessarily whipsawed out of a position,
approach selecting your stop-loss level from a defensive point of view.
Anticipate that the market will test the level where the trade setup is invali-
dated, such as trend-line support or hourly lows. Then consider if the market
tests that level, how far must it go through before it’s really considered a
break?
No set formula exists for this calculation, but allowing for a margin of error
can sometimes prevent a stop loss from being triggered unnecessarily. The
margin of error you apply depends on the general volatility of the currency
pair you’re trading, as well as on the overall market volatility at the time of
the trade.
408
Book V: Foreign Currency Trading 

Setting take-profit objectives dynamically
When it comes to establishing the take-profit objective, we suggest using a
market-based approach, one that considers where the market is likely to go
based on where it’s been (technical analysis) and overall market conditions.
The idea is to be realistic about how much you can take out of the market, not
idealistic about how much the market will reward you. Focus on technical
support and resistance levels as the primary guideposts in the progress of
market movements (see Book VIII).
Another important consideration in dynamically managing your profit objec-
tives is time. You need to be aware of and anticipate upcoming events and
market conditions. If you’ve been long for a rally during the North American
morning, what’s likely to happen when European markets begin to close up
for the day? If you’re positioned in USD/JPY in the New York afternoon, and
Japanese industrial production is slated to be released in a few hours, what
can you expect in the interim? Stay flexible and dynamic, just like the market.
Finding the Right Broker
With the explosion in online currency trading over the past several years,
dozens of forex brokerage firms now operate all over the world. Competition
among various brokerages is fierce, and there’s no shortage of advertising
seeking to win you as a client. Here are some questions to ask as you search
for just the right broker:
 How good are trading executions? Are you consistently able to trade at
the price you’re trying for?
 How are orders filled? Is a stop-loss sell order filled when the bid price
matches the stop price? Are stops guaranteed and, if so, are there any
exceptions? What’s the policy for filling limit orders?
 Are dealing spreads fixed or variable? Fixed spreads remain constant
all the time, regardless of what’s happening in the market, and tend to be
slightly wider than variable spreads. Variable spreads fluctuate depend-
ing on market interest. In highly liquid periods, variable spreads tend to
be the tightest, while in slower periods, they tend to be wider.
Which you prefer largely depends on your trading style. A short-term
trader looking to make just a few pips on each trade would probably be
better off with variable spreads, while someone who trades around news
would likely choose fixed spreads.

 What is the commission structure? While some online brokers have
chosen a commission-based pricing structure, many are compensated
by the price spread between the bid and the offer.
 Is the broker a market-maker? Market-makers typically provide both
consistent liquidity and execution, which allows you to trade your
desired amount at all times. They typically offer either fixed spreads 
or variable spreads.
Some firms claim to operate a nondealing desk (NDD) model or other
alternative to the dealing-desk (market-maker) model. Nondealing desk
brokers, which are often commission-free, claim that the trade price
comes directly from the interbank market and that they route all trades
directly to the banks. Though these firms may tout this model as supe-
rior to the market-making approach, you have to ask yourself, how is the
firm making its money?
 How much leverage does the firm offer? Firms offering excessively
high leverage aren’t looking out for their customers’ business interests.
A good guideline: Anything more than 200:1 is too high.
 What trading resources are available? Evaluate all tools and resources
offered by the firm: charting services, live market commentary,
research, accessible trading platforms, and so on.
 Is the broker registered with the appropriate financial authorities in
the jurisdiction where it operates? In the United States, forex brokers
are required to be registered as futures commission merchants (FCMs)
with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and are ulti-
mately subject to CFTC rules and regulations. The National Futures
Association (NFA) is the self-regulating body for forex brokers. Visit the
NFA’s Web site at www.nfa.futures.org to check on the regulatory
status of a prospective broker.

Putting Your Trading 
Plan in Action
In This Chapter
 Opening a position at the right time and with the right strategy
 Actively managing your trades
 Taking profits — or not
 Analyzing your trades after the fact
T
his is what it all comes down to. You’ve done the research, you’ve looked at
the charts, you’ve developed your strategic trade plan, and now it’s time 
to put it to work. If you thought economic data mining and chart analysis were 
the hard part, wait until your adrenaline starts pumping after you’ve entered the
trade. This chapter takes you through the concrete steps of opening a position,
monitoring the trade while it’s active, closing it out, and doing a post-trade
analysis to refine your trading going forward.
Getting into the Position
You can make trades in the forex market one of two ways: You can trade at
the market, or at the current price, using the click-and-deal feature of your
broker’s platform; or you can employ orders, such as limit orders and one-
cancels-the-other orders (OCOs). (We discuss order types in Chapter 3.) But
there’s a lot more to it than that. Certain trade setups suggest a combination
of both methods for entering a position, while others rely strictly on orders
to capture rapid or unexpected price movements. Then there’s the fine art of
timing the market to get in at the best price at the moment.

412
Book V: Foreign Currency Trading 
Buying and selling at the current market
Many traders like the idea of opening a position by trading at the market as
opposed to leaving an order that may or may not be executed. They prefer
the certainty of knowing that they’re in the market.
If this describes you, before actually executing your first trade, fine-tune your
entry by getting a good handle on the short-term price action. To do this, look
at shorter-term charts, such as 5 or 15 minutes, to get an idea of where prices
have been trading recently. Chances are you’ll observe a relatively narrow
range of price action, typically between 10 and 20 pips. Unless the situation is
urgent, a little patience can go a long way toward improving your entry level.
Why buy at 1.1550 when you have a viable chance to buy at 1.1535?
Let the routine price fluctuations work to your advantage by trying to buy on
down-ticks and sell on up-ticks in line with your overall strategy. Selecting
your trade size in advance helps — so when the price gets to your desired
level, you need to click only once to execute the trade. As you watch the
price action, keep a disciplined price target in mind, both in your favor and in
case prices start to move away from your entry level.
Averaging into a position
Averaging into a position refers to the practice of buying/selling at succes-
sively lower/higher prices to improve the average rate of the desired
long/short position.
Say you buy one lot of USD/JPY at 120.50 and another lot at 120.30; you’re long
two lots at an average price of 120.40 ([120.50 +120.30] ÷ 2 = 120.40). Here’s how
it works. To begin with, you were long one lot from 120.50. To add to the position
at 120.30, the market had to be trading lower, which also means you were looking
at an unrealized P/L of –20 pips on your initial position from 120.50. After you buy
the second lot, your unrealized P/L has not changed substantially, but your
position size has just doubled, which means your risk has also just doubled. 
If the market rebounds from 120.30, your unrealized loss will be reduced. But if
the market continues to decline, your losses are going to be twice what they
were had you not added on to your position.
Many trading books recommend avoiding averaging into, or adding on to, a
losing position — and with good reason. The tactic can lead to dramatically
higher losses on smaller incremental price movements. Also, if you’re adding
on to a losing position, you’re missing out on the current directional move. In
other words, not only are you losing money, but you’re also not making
money, which is the opportunity cost of averaging.

Trading breakouts
A breakout or break refers to a price movement that moves beyond, or breaks
out of, recent established trading ranges or price patterns captured with trend
lines. Breakouts can occur in all time frames, from weeks and days on down to
hours and minutes. The longer the time frame, the more significant the break-
out in terms of the overall expected price movement that follows. In terms of
entering a position, breakouts frequently represent important signals to get in
or out of positions. In that sense, they take a lot of the guesswork out of deciding
where to enter or exit a position.
Trading breakouts is a relatively aggressive trading strategy and is certainly
not without risks. Until you’ve gained some experience in the forex market
you’re probably better off focusing only on breaks of levels identified by
trend-line analysis in longer time frames, such as daily charts, or breaks of
longer-term price levels, like daily or weekly highs/lows. They may not occur
as frequently, but they’ll tend to be more reliable.
Identifying potential breakout levels
The first step in trading on a breakout is to identify where breakouts are likely
to occur. The easiest way to do this is to draw trend lines that capture recent
high/low price ranges. In many cases, these ranges will form a sideways or
horizontal range of prices, where sellers have repeatedly emerged at the same
level on the upside and buyers have regularly stepped in at the lower level.
Horizontal ranges are mostly neutral in predicting which direction the break
will occur.
Other ranges are going to form price patterns with sloping trend lines on the
top and bottom, such as flags, pennants, wedges, and triangles. These patterns
have more predictive capacity for the direction of the eventual breakout and
even the distance of the breakout. (Go to Book VIII to find out about common
patterns.)
The time frame determines the overall significance of the breakout and goes
a long way toward determining whether you should make a trade based on it.
Very short time frames (less than an hour) have much less significance than
a break of a four-hour range or a daily price pattern. The length of time that a
price range or pattern has endured also gives you an idea of its significance.
A break of a range that has formed over the past 48 hours has less significance
for price movements than the break of a range that’s persisted for the past 3
weeks.

Trading breaks with stop-loss entry orders
After you’ve identified a likely breakout point, you can use a resting stop-loss
entry order placed just beyond the breakout level to get into a position when
a breakout occurs. To get long for a break to the upside, you would leave a
stop-loss entry order to buy at a price just above the upper level of the range
or pattern. To get short for a break lower, you would leave a stop-loss entry
order to sell at a price just below the lower level of the range or pattern.
The appeal of using stop-loss entry orders is that you’re able to trade the
breakout without any further action on your part. Breakouts can occur in the
blink of an eye. Just when you thought the upper range level was going to
hold and prices started to drift off, for example, they’ll come roaring back
and blow right through the breakout level.
When placing a stop-loss entry order to trade a breakout level, be aware of
any major data or news events that are coming up. If your stop-loss entry
order is triggered as a result of a news event, the execution rate on the order
could be subject to slippage, which may wipe out any gains from getting in on
the breakout.
Trading the retest of a breakout level
The other way to trade a breakout is after the breakout has occurred. A retest
refers to a frequent price reaction after breakouts, where prices eventually
reverse course, return to the break level, and retest it to see if it will hold. In
the case of a break to the upside, for example, after the initial wave of buying
has run its course, prices may stall and trigger very short-term profit-taking
selling. The tendency is for prices to return to the breakout level, which
should now act as support and attract buying interest.
Not every breakout sees prices return to retest the break level. Some retests
may retrace only a portion of the breakout move, stopping short of retesting
the exact break level, which is typically a good sign that the break is for real
and will continue. Other breakouts never look back and just keep going.
Guarding against false breaks
Breakouts are relatively common events in currency trading, especially from
a very short-term perspective. But not every breakout is sustained. When
prices break through key support or resistance levels, but then stop and
reverse course and ultimately move back through the break level, it’s called a
false break.
To protect against false breaks, you need to follow up your stop-loss entry
with a contingent stop-loss exit order to close out the position if the market
reverses course.
414
Book V: Foreign Currency Trading 

Although there’s no surefire way to tell whether a breakout is a false break or
a valid one that you should trade, here are a few points to keep in mind:
 Time frame of the breakout level: The shorter the time frame you’re
looking at, the greater the potential for a false break.
 Significance of the price level: The more important the price level
that’s broken, the more likely it is to provoke a market response and to
be sustained.
 Duration of the break: The longer the breakout level is held, the more
likely the breakout is to be valid.
 Currency pair volatility: Relatively volatile currency pairs, such as
GBP/USD and USD/CHF, are more prone to false breaks than others,
especially in short-term time frames.
 Fundamental events and news: Sustained breakouts tend to have a
fundamental catalyst behind them — a significant piece of news that has
altered the market’s outlook, resulting in the breakout.
Making the Trade Correctly
When using an online trading platform, entering a position is as easy as
making a few simple mouse clicks, as the following sections explain.
The simplicity and speed with which you can enter a position can also put
your trading capital at risk. Any action you take on a trading platform is your
responsibility. You may have meant to click Buy instead of Sell, but no one
knows for sure except you. If you make a mistake, correct it as soon as you
discover and confirm it. Don’t try to trade your way out of it or manage it —
and don’t rationalize that it may work out anyway. No trader is error-proof,
and you’re bound to make a mistake someday. Just cover the error and get
your position back to what you want it to be.
Buying and selling online
Most every online trading brokerage now provides for click-and-deal trade
execution. Click and deal refers to trading on the current market price by
clicking either the Buy button or the Sell button in the trading platform.
Before you can click and deal, you have to
1. Select the right currency pair.
When the market gets hectic and you’re switching between your charts
and the trading platform, you could easily mistake EUR/USD for
EUR/CHF if you’re not careful.
415
Chapter 6: Putting Your Trading Plan in Action
Book V
Foreign
Currency
Trading

2. Select the correct trade amount.
Different platforms have different ways of inputting the trade amount.
Some use radio buttons, others use scroll-down menus, and others allow
you to type the amount manually.
3. Double-check your selections.
In case you think input errors can’t happen to you, think about the
equity trader at a New York investment bank who meant to sell 10 mil-
lion shares of a stock but ended up entering 10 billion. By the time the
trade was stopped, the system had sold several hundred million shares!
Ouch.
4. Click Buy or Sell.
If you want to buy, you’ll need to click the higher price — the trading
platform’s offer. If you want to sell, you’ll have to click the lower price —
the platform’s bid.
After you’ve clicked Buy or Sell, the trading platform will confirm whether
your trade went through successfully, usually within a second or two. If your
trade request went through, you receive a confirmation from the platform.
Double-check your position, and make sure it’s what you want it to be. If the
trading price changed before your request was received, you receive a
response indicating “trade failed,” “rates changed,” “price not available,” or
something along those lines. You then need to repeat the steps to make
another trade attempt.
Attempts to trade at the market can sometimes fail in very fast-moving mar-
kets when price are adjusting quickly. Part of this stems from the latency
effect of trading over the Internet, which refers to time lags between the plat-
form price reaching your computer and your trade request reaching the plat-
form’s server.
Whatever the outcome of your trade request, you need to be sure you’ve
received a response from the trading platform. If you have not gotten a
response back after more than a few seconds, call your broker immediately
and confirm the status of the trade request. The deal may have gone through,
but confirmations may be delayed due to processor slowness. Or the trade
may have never been received by the trading platform because your com-
puter lost its Internet connection.
Placing your orders
Orders are critical trading tools in the forex market. Think of them as trades
waiting to happen, because that’s exactly what they are. If you enter an order,
and subsequent price action triggers its execution, you’re in the market. So
416
Book V: Foreign Currency Trading 

you need to be as careful as you are thorough, if not more so, when placing
your orders in the market. (Refer to Chapter 3 to read about the types of
orders and how they’re used.)
Here are some important tips to keep in mind when placing and managing
your orders:
 Input your orders correctly. Make sure you’ve correctly specified the
currency pair, order type, amount, and price. Then double-check your
order after it has been accepted by the trading platform. If it’s wrong,
edit it or cancel it and start again.
 Note the expiration of your orders. Order expirations are typically
good-’til-cancelled (GTC), in which the order remains active until you
cancel it, or good until the end of the day (EOD), which means that the
order automatically expires at the end of the trading day (5 p.m. eastern
time [ET]). If you have an intraday position with a stop-loss good until
EOD, and you later decide to hold the position overnight, you need to
revise the expiration. GTC orders will expire on some trading platforms
after an extended period of time, such as 90 days, so be clear on your
broker’s policy.
 Cancel unwanted orders. Some trading platforms allow orders to be
associated with a position, meaning that the order remains valid as long
as the position is open. Such position orders also usually adjust the order
amount if you increase or reduce the associated position. Other orders
are independent of positions, so even if you close out your position, the
independent orders remain active. Make sure you understand the differ-
ence between the two types, and remember to cancel any independent
orders if you close the position they were based on, such as take profits,
stop losses, or OCO.
Managing the Trade
So you’ve pulled the trigger and opened up the position, and now you’re in
the market. Time to sit back and let the market do its thing, right? Not so fast,
amigo. The forex market isn’t a roulette wheel where you place your bets, watch
the wheel spin, and simply take the results. It’s a dynamic, fluid environment
where new information and price developments create new opportunities and
alter previous expectations. Actively managing a trade when you’re in it is just
as important as the decision-making that went into establishing the position in
the first place.
417

Monitoring the market
No matter which trading style you follow, it’ll pay to keep up with market
news and price developments while your trade is active. Unexpected news
that impacts your position may come into the market at any time.
The starting point for any trading plan is determining how much you’re pre-
pared to risk, which is ultimately expressed by the size of the position and the
pip distance to the stop-loss point. When we talk about making changes to the
trading plan, we’re referring only to reducing the overall risk of the trade, by
taking profit (full or partial) or moving the stop loss in the direction of the
trade. The idea is to be fluid and dynamic in one direction only: taking profit
and reducing risk. Keep your ultimate stop-out point where you decided it
should go before you entered the trade.
Rate alerts
One way to follow the market from a distance is to set rate alerts from either
your charting system or your trading platform. A rate alert is an electronic
message that alerts you when a price you’ve specified is touched by the
market in a particular currency pair. Rate alerts are a great way to keep tabs
on the market’s progress.
Rate alerts are a convenient way to follow the market remotely, but they
don’t take the place of live orders and should never be substituted for stop-
loss orders. By the time you respond to a rate alert and log on to the trading
platform or call your broker’s trading desk, prices may have moved well
beyond your desired stop-out level, leaving you with a larger loss than you
anticipated. Rate alerts are a nice little extra service, but only orders repre-
sent obligations on the part of your broker to take an action in the market for
your account.
News and data developments
Ideally, you should be aware of all data reports and news events scheduled to
occur during the anticipated time horizon of your trade strategy. You should
also have a good understanding of what the market is expecting in terms of
event outcomes to anticipate how the market is likely to react. Additionally, if
your trade rationale is reliant on certain data or event expectations, you need
to be especially alert for upcoming reports on those themes. (See Chapter 4
for a detailed look at economic reports and the major fundamental drivers
and how the market interprets them.)
Speculating based on expected event or data outcomes is perfectly okay. It
becomes a problem only if you maintain the trade even after the data/event
outcome has come out against your expectations and strategy. Always relate
incoming news and data back to the original reason for your trade, and be
prepared to adapt your trade strategy accordingly.
418
Book V: Foreign Currency Trading 

Updating your trade plan over time
Time — and its passing — brings with it routine daily events, such as option
expirations and the daily closing of the currency futures market. These are
specific time periods when traders can reasonably expect a flurry of activity,
though it doesn’t always materialize. Time’s passing also brings you nearer to
scheduled news or data events. As the release time draws closer, anticipative
speculation generally declines, but price movements can become more erratic
as traders take to the sidelines immediately ahead of the release. All these
market reactions are as much the result of time as they are of the event itself.
Time can also add significance to, or detract significance from, price move-
ments that have already occurred, frequently providing trading signals as a
result. So pay attention to time as you update your trade plan.
Trend lines move over time
If you’re basing your trading strategies on trend-line analysis, you need to be
aware that price levels derived from trend lines change depending on the
slope of the trend line. The slope of a trend line refers to the angle of a trend
line relative to a horizontal line. The steeper the slope of the trend line, the
more the relevant price level will change over time; the less slope, the more
gradually the price levels will change with time.
No matter what time frame you’re trading, be sure to factor in the shifting
levels of trend lines if they’re part of your trade strategy. You may need to
adjust your order levels accordingly. In particular, consider the following:
 Short-term and overnight positions: Consider where trend-line support
or resistance will be over the next 6 to 12 hours, while your position is
still active but while you may not be able to actively follow the market.
You may want to use a trailing stop as a proxy for changes in trend-line-
based support/resistance levels.
 Limit-entry orders: If your limit buying/selling order is based on a sloping
trend line, periodically adjust your order so that it’s still in play according
to changes in the trend line. You may miss a trade entry if the trend line
is eventually touched, but in the meantime its level has shifted away
from where you first placed the order.
 Breakouts: A significant trend line that looks to be a mile away one week
may suddenly be within striking distance in the following week or two
weeks, substantially altering the market’s outlook. Alternatively, the
market may be focused on a price high/low as a breakout trigger, when a
sloping trend line touching that high/low may actually be the catalyst for
a breakout.

Adjusting your trade plan over impending events
As you develop your trading plan, look ahead to see what data and events are
scheduled during the expected life of the trade. If you follow that simple
advice, you strongly reduce the chances of having your trade strategy upset 
by largely predictable events. More important, you’ll be able to anticipate likely
catalysts for price shifts, which will give you greater insight into subsequent
price movements.
If, for example, you’ve entered into a trade strategy based on an upcoming
event — an expected weak U.S. data report, for instance — and the market
has cooperated and priced in a lower U.S. dollar before the report is released,
you may be looking at a profitable position before the data is even released.
As the release time draws near, you take some profit off the table and hold on
to the remaining partial position. In this situation, you’ve successfully played
the market: If the data comes in negative for the U.S. dollar, and the market
reacts by selling the U.S. dollar, you’re still in the partial position to gain from
further dollar weakness. If the data comes in stronger than expected (or the
data comes in weak as expected, but the market takes profit on short-dollar
positions made in advance), you’ve protected your profit by taking some
money out of the market before the event ever transpired.
Before major data and events, the market frequently goes into a sideways
holding pattern. The event speculators have all put on their positions, and
the rest of the market is waiting for the data to decide how to react. These
holding patterns can develop hours or days in advance, depending on what
event is coming. Especially if you’re trading from a short-term perspective, be
prepared for these doldrums and consider whether riding through them is
worthwhile.
Updating order levels as prices progress
When you’re in a position, and the market is moving in your favor, it’s impor-
tant to be flexible in adjusting take-profit targets and amending stop-loss
orders to protect your profits. The key to being flexible in this regard is also
being prudent: Don’t adjust your take-profit targets without also adjusting
your stop-loss order in the same direction. If you’re long, and you raise your
take profit, raise your stop loss too. If you’re short, and you lower your take
profit, lower your stop-loss order as well.
Increasing take-profit targets
You’ve put together a well-developed trade strategy ahead of your trade, so
now that you’re in the trade, why would you change your take-profit objective?
Only for some very good reasons, like the following:
 Major new information: Major means it has to come from the very top
echelons of decision-making, like the Fed chairman, the European
Central Bank (ECB) president, or other central bank chiefs; the U.S.
Treasury secretary; or the G7. Surprise interest rate changes or policy
420
Book V: Foreign Currency Trading 

shifts are always candidates. The more at odds the information is with
current market expectations, the better the chances that it will generate
an extensive price move.
 Thinner-than-usual liquidity: Reduced liquidity conditions can provoke
more extensive price movements than would otherwise occur, because
fewer market participants are involved to absorb the price shocks.
Reduced liquidity is most evident during national holidays, seasonal
periods (late summer, Christmas/New Year’s), end of month, end of
quarter, and certain Fridays.
 Breaks of major technical levels: Trend lines dating back several
months or years, retracement levels of major recent directional moves,
and recent extreme highs and lows are likely to trigger larger-than-
normal price movements. Reduced volatility preceding the breakout is
another ingredient in favor of a more sustained directional move.
 The currency pair: The more illiquid and volatile the currency pair
you’re trading, the greater the chances for an extreme move. GBP, CHF,
and JPY are the most common culprits among the majors.
Tightening stop-loss orders to protect profits
To protect profits, adjust your stop losses to lock in gains. When formulating
your overall trade plan, always consider what price levels need to be sur-
passed to justify moving your stop loss. If it happens in the market, you’ll be
ready and know exactly what to do.
We like to focus on hourly and daily trend-line levels, daily highs/lows, and
breaks of Fibonacci retracement levels. When these technical support/resis-
tance points are exceeded, it’s an indication that the market has seen fit to
move prices into a new level in the overall direction of the trade. When that
happens, consider moving your stop-loss order to levels just inside the
broken technical level. If the market has second thoughts about sustaining
the break, your adjusted stop will then take you out of the trade.
The risk with adjusting stops too aggressively is that the market may come
back to test the break level, triggering your adjusted stop loss if it’s too close,
and then go on to make fresh gains. But the trade-off in that situation is
between something and more of something, or potentially nothing and more
of nothing. We prefer to have something to show for our efforts.
Another way to lock in profits in a more dynamic fashion is by using a trailing
stop-loss order (see Chapter 3). After a technical level in the direction of your
trade is overcome, similar to the preceding example, you may consider insti-
tuting a trailing stop to replace your fixed stop-loss order. Set the trailing
distance to account for the distance between the current market and the
other side of the technical break level.

Closing Out the Trade
On the most basic level, every trade ends with either a profit or a loss. Sure,
some trades finish flat, which is when you exit the trade at the same price
you entered, producing no gain or loss. Most of the time, though, you’re going
to be dealing with the agony or ecstasy of either being stopped out or taking
profit.
Taking profits
Taking profit is usually a positive experience for traders. But if the market
continues to move in the direction of your trade after you’ve squared up and
taken profit, you may begin to feel as though you’re missing out or even
losing money. At these times, you want to avoid making rash trading deci-
sions. Even if the market continues to move in the direction of your earlier
position, don’t re-enter the same position until you’ve first taken the time to
reevaluate the market objectively. Also, avoid the urge to suddenly take a
position in the opposite direction. The key is to treat each trade indepen-
dently, recognizing that the outcome of one trade has no bearing on the next
trade.
Taking partial profits
One way that traders are able to stay in the market with a profitable position
and hang on for a potentially larger move is to take partial profits on the
overall position. Of course, taking partial profits requires the ability to trade
in multiple lots — at least two. The idea is that as prices move in favor of
your trading position, you take profit on just a portion of your total position.
Whenever you take partial profits, modify the size of your stop-loss and other
take-profit orders to account for the reduction in your total position size. Some
online brokers offer a position-based order-entry system, where your order
size automatically adjusts based on any changes to the overall position.
Stopping out before things get worse
As part of any trade strategy and to preserve your trading capital for future
trading, always identify where to exit a trade if the market doesn’t move in
the direction you expect. Devote as much time and energy to pinpointing that
level as you need, and keep in mind that a lot of short-term price action is
stop-loss driven.
422
Book V: Foreign Currency Trading 

Stop losses are a necessary evil for every trader, big and small. You can never
know beforehand where a price movement will stop, but you can control where
you exit the market if prices don’t move as you expect. Stop losses are an
important tool for preventing manageable trading losses from turning into dis-
astrous ones.
Trailing stop-loss orders are often used to protect profits and enable traders
to capture larger price movements. (We explain how trailing stop-loss orders
work in Chapter 3.) They’re no surefire guarantee that you’ll be able to stay
on board for a larger directional price move, but they do provide an element
of flexibility that you should consider in adjusting your trade plan. For exam-
ple, if your position is in the money and holding beyond a significant technical
break level, you may want to consider adjusting your stop loss to a trailing
stop that has its starting point on the other side of the technical level. If the
break leads to a more sustained move, you’ll be able to capture more than you
otherwise might. If the break is reversed, the trailing stop will limit the damage.
Letting the market trigger your stop-loss/take-profit order
When you’ve identified a trade opportunity and developed a risk-aware trading
plan, you’re going to have active orders out in the market to cover your position
one way or the other (stop-loss or take-profit). Depending on your trading style
and the trade setup, you can reasonably follow a set-it-and-forget-it trade strategy
where your orders will watch the market and your position for you.
Medium- to longer-term traders are more likely to rely on set, or resting, market
orders to cover open positions due to the longer time frame of such trade
strategies and the burdens of monitoring the market overnight or for longer
stretches of time. If you use resting orders, also use rate alerts to update you
on specific price movements (see the earlier section “Monitoring the market”)
so that you can act when necessary. Shorter-term traders are more apt to be
in front of their trading monitors while their trade is still open, but they
should always still have an ultimate limiting set of orders to cover the trade.
While you may want to be flexible with where you leave your take-profit order,
always have a stop-loss order in place to protect you in case of unexpected
news or price movements. If you’re trading the market from the long side
(meaning you think prices in a currency pair are likely to move higher), you
need to pinpoint the ultimate price level on the downside, which negates this
short-term view.

Getting out when the price is right
The most reliable market information is the prices themselves. Sharp price
reactions are usually strong indicators of significant market interest that’s
either pushing prices faster in the same direction or repelling them in the
opposite direction. As you monitor your position in the market, stay closely
attuned to significant price reactions, such as spike reversals or price gaps,
with a good benchmark being typically more than 20 points over a few minutes.
The sharp move in prices may be due to news or rumors, or it may just be a
pocket of illiquidity. Either way, the sharp price move carries its own significance
that is information to you. There’s no set way such moves always play out, but
if you’re alert for them, you’ve got one more piece of information to help you
decide when and how to exit your position.
If the rapid price movement is in your favor, you can look at it as a new high-
water mark, or as a new support or resistance level. If the move is reversed,
the tide is reversing, and you should consider exiting sooner rather than
later. If the tide doesn’t reverse, you’ve got a solid short-term price level on
which to base your decisions going forward. If the price move was against
you, you may want to consider that the market is not cooperating and adopt
a more defensive strategy, such as tightening stop losses, reducing your posi-
tion, or exiting altogether.
Getting out when the time is right
The time of day and the day of the week can frequently determine how prices
behave and how your ultimate trade strategy plays out. If you’re trading
ahead of major data releases, for example, you need to be aware that price
action is going to be affected in the run-up to the scheduled release, not to
mention in its aftermath. Similarly, if you’ve been positioned correctly for a
directional price move in the New York morning, for example, you need to be
aware that there may be a price reaction as European traders begin to wind
up their trading on any given day. When it comes to adjusting your trading
plan or closing out your position, it frequently pays to be a clock watcher.
After the Trade
Good traders learn from their mistakes and try to avoid repeating them in the
future. Bad traders keep making the same mistakes over and over again until
they give up in frustration or are forced to for financial reasons. The best way
to learn from each trading experience — both the good and the bad ones —
is to make post-trade analysis part of your regular trading routine.
424
Book V: Foreign Currency Trading 

Identifying what you did right and wrong
Regardless of the outcome of any trade, you want to look back over the
whole process to understand what you did right and wrong. In particular, ask
yourself the following questions:
 How did you identify the trade opportunity? If more of your winning
trades are being generated by technical analysis, you’ll probably want to
devote more energy to that approach. If more of your winning trades are
coming from the fundamental approach, you’re probably better off
concentrating on a fundamental style.
 How well did your trade plan work out? Was the position size sufficient
to match the risk and reward scenarios, or was it too large or too small?
Could you have entered at a better level? What tools might you have
used to improve your entry timing? Was your take profit realistic or pie
in the sky? Use the answers to these questions to refine your position
size, entry level, and order placement going forward.
 How well did you manage the trade after it was open? Were you able
to effectively monitor the market while your trade was active? Did you
modify your trade plan appropriately along the way? Did you close out
the trade based on your trading plan, or did the market surprise you
somehow? Based on your answers, you’ll learn what role your emotions
may have played and how disciplined a trader you are.
Updating your trading record
Recollections of individual trades can be hazy sometimes. Some traders may
tend to favor remembering winning trades, while others may remember only
the losing trades. The only way to get to the heart of the matter is to look at
the numbers — the results of your trades over a specific time period, such as
a month. A trading record doesn’t lie, but you still have to interpret it prop-
erly to glean any useful lessons from it. Depending on your trading style, it’s
best to approach analyzing your trading record from two different angles,
each with a common denominator — average wins and average losses.
 Long-term and medium-term traders: Tend to have fewer overall trades
because they’re more likely to be looking at the market from a more
strategic perspective, picking trade opportunities more selectively. If that’s
you, tally your results on a per-trade basis, totaling up separately the
number of winning trades and the number of losing trades, along with the
total amount of profits and the total amount of losses. Divide the number
of profits by the number of winning trades to find your average winning
trade amount. Do the same with your losing trades.
425
Chapter 6: Putting Your Trading Plan in Action
Book V
Foreign
Currency
Trading

 Short-term traders: Tend to have a larger number of trades due to their
short-term trading style. If that’s you, and if you’re making only one or
two trades a day, you may want to follow the method described in the
preceding bullet item. If you’re a more active day-trader, measure your
results on a per-day basis to get an idea of how successful you are at
trading in multiple positions on any given day. Tally up the results of
each trading day over the course of a month to come up with the same
numbers outlined in the preceding bullet item: total number of wins or
losses, and average win amount and loss amount.
Focus on what you’re doing right, but also figure out what you’re doing wrong.
Refine your analysis of your trading results by breaking them down to smaller
categories, such as day of the week and currency pair or even trade size. Are
your losing days or trades concentrated on certain days of the week, such as
Fridays or Mondays? Are your losing trades concentrated in certain currency
pairs? Does the position size of each trade have any relationship to wins and
losses? Are you winning more on large trades, for example, or are you giving
up larger losses on smaller trade sizes?

H
edge funds. You’ve seen the headlines in the ﬁnan-
cial press. You’ve heard the rumors about mythical
investment funds that make money no matter what hap-
pens in the market. And you want a part of that action.
Hedge funds are private partnerships that pursue high
ﬁnance. If you don’t mind a little risk, you can net some
high returns for your portfolio. However, you have to meet
strict limits put in place by the Securities and Exchange
Commission –– namely that you have a net worth of at least
$1 million or an annual income of $200,000 ($300,000 with a
spouse). In fact, most hedge fund investors are institutions,
like pensions, foundations, and endowments.
Here’s a little secret: Not all hedge fund managers are
performing ﬁnancial alchemy. Many of the techniques
they use are available to any investor who wants to
increase return relative to the amount of risk taken.

s a hedge fund a surefire way to expand your wealth or a scam that will
surely rip you off? After all, some funds have failed, and that makes for big
headlines. Is it a newfangled mutual fund or a scheme for raiding corporations
and ripping off hard-working employees? You see hedge funds in the news all
the time, but it’s hard to know exactly what they are. That’s because, at its
essence, a hedge fund is a bit of a mystery. A hedge fund, generally speaking, is
a lightly regulated investment partnership that invests in a range of securities
in an attempt to increase expected return while reducing risk. And that can
mean just about anything.
This chapter covers basic things you need to know if you’re considering
buying into a hedge fund. It tells you what a hedge fund is and explains who
the people involved in hedge funds are, what you have to do to qualify as a
hedge fund investor, and more.
Defining Hedge Funds
When you talk about hedge funds, you soon discover that the term hedge
fund means different things to different people. In the investment world, “I
run a hedge fund” has the same meaning as “I’m a consultant” in the rest of
the business world. Still, one definition that most folks can agree on is a fairly
general one: A hedge fund is a private partnership that operates with little to
no regulation from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and

430
Book VI: Hedge Funds 
that uses a range of investment techniques and invests in a wide array of
assets to generate a higher return for a given level of risk than what’s
expected of normal investments. In many cases, but hardly all, hedge funds
are managed to generate a consistent level of return, regardless of what the
market does.
Hedging: The heart of 
the hedge fund matter
To understand what a hedge fund is, obviously, it helps to know what hedging
is. Hedging means reducing risk, which is what many hedge funds are designed
to do. Although risk is usually a function of return (the higher the risk, the
higher the return), a hedge fund manager has ways to reduce risk without
cutting into investment income. She can look for ways to get rid of some risks
while taking on others with an expected good return. For example, a fund
manager can take stock market risk out of the fund’s portfolio by selling stock
index futures. Or she can increase her return from a relatively low-risk invest-
ment by borrowing money, known as leveraging. Keep in mind, however, that
risk remains, no matter the hedge fund strategy.
The challenge for the hedge fund manager is to eliminate some risk while
gaining return on investments — not a simple task, which is why hedge fund
managers get paid handsomely if they succeed.
Characteristics of hedge funds
A hedge fund differs from so-called “real money” — traditional investment
accounts like mutual funds, pensions, and endowments — because it has more
freedom to pursue different investment strategies. In some cases, these unique
strategies can lead to huge gains while the traditional market measures languish.
In 2005, for example, the Credit Suisse/Tremont Hedge Fund Index, a leading
measure of hedge fund performance (www.hedgeindex.com/hedgeindex/
en/default.aspx), reported that the average hedge fund return for the year
was 7.61 percent. For the same period, the NASDAQ Composite Index (www.
nasdaq.com) returned only 1.37. The amount of potential return makes hedge
funds more than worthwhile in the minds of many accredited and qualified
investors.
The following sections dig deeper into the characteristics of hedge funds.
Here, I offer the basic characteristics.

Illiquid
One key characteristic of hedge funds is that they’re illiquid. Most hedge fund
managers limit how often investors can take their money out; a fund may lock
in investors for two years or more. In other words, investing in a hedge fund
is a long-term proposition because the money you invest may be locked up
for years.
For that reason, a hedge fund investment is most appropriate if you don’t need
the money now or in the near future to support your life or any necessary
obligations and if you can afford to take some chances in terms of the risk and
the illiquidity.
Little to no regulatory oversight
Hedge funds don’t have to register with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC). Most funds and their managers also aren’t required to
register with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority or the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, the major self-regulatory bodies in the investment
business. However, many funds register with these bodies anyway, choosing
to give investors peace of mind and many protections otherwise not afforded
to them (not including protection from losing money, of course). Whether
registered or not, hedge funds can’t commit fraud, engage in insider trading,
or otherwise violate the laws of the land.
In order to stay free of the yoke of strict regulation, hedge funds agree to accept
money only from accredited or qualified investors — people and institutions
with high net worths. The later section “Is a Hedge Fund Right for You?” defines
the requirements for each.
The reason for the high-net-worth requirement is that regulators believe
people with plenty of money generally understand investment risks and
returns better than the average person, and accredited investors can afford to
lose money if their investments don’t work out. In order to avoid the appear-
ance of improper marketing to unqualified investors, hedge funds tend to stay
away from Web sites, and some don’t even have listed telephone numbers.
You should have to prove your accredited status before you can see offering
documents from a fund or find out more about a fund’s investment style.
Aggressive investment strategies
In order to post a higher return for a given level of risk than otherwise
expected, a hedge fund manager does things differently than a traditional
money manager. This fact is where a hedge fund’s relative lack of regulatory
oversight becomes important: A hedge fund manager has a broad array of
investment techniques at his disposal that aren’t feasible for a tightly regulated
investor, such as short selling and leveraging.
431
Chapter 1: Getting the 411 on Hedge Funds
Book VI
Hedge
Funds

Manager bonuses for performance
Another factor that distinguishes a hedge fund from a mutual fund, individual
account, or other type of investment portfolio is the fund manager’s compen-
sation in the form of a performance fee. (SEC regulations forbid mutual funds,
for example, from charging performance fees.) Many hedge funds are structured
under the so-called 2 and 20 arrangement, meaning that the fund manager
receives an annual fee equal to 2 percent of the assets in the fund and an
additional bonus equal to 20 percent of the year’s profits. You may find that
the percentages differ from the 2 and 20 formula when you start investigating
prospective funds, but the management fee plus bonus structure rarely changes.
The hedge fund manager receives a bonus only if the fund makes money.
Many investors love that the fund manager’s fortunes are tied to theirs. The
downside of this rule? After all the investors pay their fees, the hedge fund’s
great performance relative to other investments may disappear. For informa-
tion on fees and their effects on performance, see the later section “Fee, Fi,
Fo, Cha Ching! Hedge Fund Fees.”
Biased performance data
What gets investors excited about hedge funds is that the funds seem to have
fabulous performances at every turn, no matter what the market does. But
the great numbers you see in the papers can be misleading because hedge
fund managers don’t have to report performance numbers to anyone other
than their fund investors. Those that do report their numbers to different
analytical, consulting, and index firms do so voluntarily, and they’re often the
ones most likely to have good performance numbers to report. Add to that
the fact that hedge fund managers can easily close shop when things aren’t
going well; after it shuts down it doesn’t report its data anymore (if it ever
did), and poorly performing funds are most likely to close. What all this means
is that measures of hedge fund performance have a bias toward good numbers.
You have to do your homework when buying into a hedge fund. You can’t rely
on a rating service, and you can’t rely on the SEC, as you can with a mutual
fund or other registered investment. You have to ask a lot of tough questions
about who the fund manager is, what he plans for the fund’s strategy, and
who will be verifying the performance numbers.
Secretive about performance and strategies
Some hedge funds are very secretive, and for good reason: If other players in
the market know how a fund is making its money, they’ll try to use the same
techniques, and the unique opportunity for the front-running hedge fund may
disappear. Hedge funds aren’t required to report their performance, disclose
their holdings, or take questions from shareholders.
432
Book VI: Hedge Funds 

However, that doesn’t mean hedge fund managers refuse to tell you anything.
A fund must prepare a partnership agreement or offering memorandum for
prospective investors that explains the following:
 The fund’s investment style
 The fund’s structure
 The fund manager’s background
A hedge fund should also undergo an annual audit of holdings and performance
and give this report to all fund investors. (The fund manager may require you
to sign a nondisclosure agreement as a condition of receiving the information,
but the information should be made available nonetheless.) But the hedge
fund manager doesn’t have to give you regular and detailed information, nor
should you expect to receive it.
Beware the hedge fund that gives investors no information or that refuses to
agree to an annual audit — that’s a blueprint for fraud.
Alpha: What hedge funds are all about
Hedge fund managers all talk about alpha. Their goal is to generate alpha,
because alpha is what makes them special. But what the heck is it?
Unfortunately, alpha is one of those things that everyone in the business
talks about but no one really explains.
Alpha is a term that originated in the Modern (Markowitz) Portfolio Theory
(MPT), which explains how an investment generates its return. The equation
used to describe the theory contains four terms:
 The risk-free rate of return
 The premium over the risk-free rate that you get for investing in the market
 Beta, the sensitivity of an investment to the market
 Alpha, the return over and above the market rate that results from the
manager’s skill or other factors
Today, people aren’t always thinking of MPT when they use alpha. Instead,
many people use it as shorthand for whatever a fund does that’s special. In
basic terms, alpha is the value that the hedge fund manager adds.
In theory, alpha doesn’t exist, and if it does exist, it’s as likely to be negative
(where the fund manager’s lack of skill hurts the fund’s return) as positive. In
practice, some people can generate returns over and above what’s expected
by the risk that they take, but it isn’t that common, and it isn’t easy to do.

The People in Your Hedge
Fund Neighborhood 
Many different people work for, with, and around hedge funds. The following
sections give you a little who’s who so you understand the roles of the people
you may come into contact with and of people who play a large role in your
hedge fund.
Managers
The person who organizes the hedge fund and oversees its investment process
is the fund manager — often called the portfolio manager or even PM for
short. The fund manager may make all the investment decisions, handling all
the trades and research himself, or he may opt to oversee a staff of people
who give him advice. A fund manager who relies on other people to work his
magic usually has two important types of employees:
 Traders: The traders are the people who execute the buy-and-sell decisions.
They sit in front of computer screens, connected to other traders all
over the world, and they punch in commands and yell in the phones.
Traders need to act quickly as news events happen. They have to be
alert to the information that comes across their screens, because they’re
the people who make things happen with the fund.
 Analysts: Traders operate in real time, seeing what’s happening in the
market and reacting to all occurrences; analysts take a longer view of
the world. They crunch the numbers that companies and governments
report, ask the necessary questions, and make projections about the
future value of securities.
Consultants
Because big dollars are involved, many hedge fund investors work closely
with outside consultants who advise them on their investment decisions,
market for accredited investors, and make sure that they’re meeting their
investors’ needs. Staff members who oversee large institutional accounts —
like pensions, foundations, or endowments, for example — rely heavily on
outside advisors to ensure that they act appropriately, because these types
of accounts hinge on the best interests of those who benefit from the money.
Consultants can also help investors make sound investment decisions,
ensure that they follow the law, give advice on the proper structure of their
portfolios in order to help them meet their investment objectives, and so on.
434
Book VI: Hedge Funds 

A consultant can take a fee from an investor or from a hedge fund, but not
from both. That way, the consultant stays clear of any conflicts of interest.
Fee, Fi, Fo, Cha Ching! Hedge Fund Fees
A hedge fund can be an expensive business to run. The general partners of
the fund have to worry about paying for many areas of the business, includ-
ing the following:
 Rent and utility costs of the office space, telephones, computers, office
supplies, and so on
 The price of research services, specialized software, and brokerage
commissions
 The salaries for the fund managers and staff
 The lawyers, accountants, and consultants who track the fund’s assets
and help it comply with applicable regulations
All these supplies and employees cost money. And who pays for it all? The fund
investors. Ever since the first hedge fund, started by Alfred Winslow Jones in
the late 1940s, funds have charged investors fees: You pay two fees to the fund
manager (a performance fee and a management fee), a fee to get into the 
fund, and a fee to get out. In the following sections, I discuss these fees.
Before you begin gnashing your teeth about what you have to pay, keep in
mind that, although these fees drain a bit of money from your bottom line,
they also give life to the hedge fund business. If your hedge fund generates a
high return, the amount you give will be worth it. (If not, well, being in the
fund will just be expensive.)
Management fees
Most funds charge management fees of about 1 to 2 percent of the fund’s assets,
usually at the end of the fiscal year. Some charge higher fees — especially if they
follow strategies that involve expensive research and related expenses, such as
shareholder activism. Other funds keep the fee relatively low by paying only
some expenses out of the fee; the funds pay for other bills, especially legal
and accounting expenses, directly out of funds assets. Find out upfront what
management fees a prospective fund charges, what other expenses the fund
incurs, and how the fund calculates its fees.
435
Chapter 1: Getting the 411 on Hedge Funds
Book VI
Hedge
Funds

A hedge fund manager receives a management fee no matter how the fund
performs. However, if the fund’s assets increase, the fee does, too. Two per-
cent of $60 million is more than 2 percent of $50 million, so a 20-percent
investment return translates into a 20-percent increase in management fees.
Sales charges
Hedge funds incur expenses throughout the year. They may take their
management fees on a periodic basis, like once per quarter or once every 
six months, but the rate of fee collection may not match the rate at which the
bills come in. Some funds may need money up front in order to operate, so
they charge upfront sales charges — often at the same scale as the management
fees (1 to 2 percent that comes out of the amount invested). The sales charge
allows the fund to cover its expenses and pay its staff until the management
fees and performance fees come in.
Performance fees
Hedge fund managers charge performance fees as a reward for getting excellent
returns for their investors. A typical performance fee is 20 percent of the fund’s
annual profits before fees. Some funds charge a higher rate if performance is
above a predetermined benchmark — say, 20 percent on investment returns of
up to 50 percent and 35 percent on any returns generated over 50 percent.
One of the many appeals of hedge funds is that the managers eat their own
cooking, as the saying goes — their incentives are aligned with their
investors’ goals. If the fund doesn’t make money, the fund manager doesn’t
get a performance fee.
High water marks
Performance fees come with a downside for fund managers: The fund only
gets paid if it turns profit, and most funds set what’s called a high water mark.
The fund can only charge a performance fee if the fund’s assets return to where
they were before the fund started losing money. If it had $10 million in year one
and lost 10 percent, making the asset value $9 million, the manager can’t
charge a performance fee until the assets appreciate back to $10 million.
Is the high water mark a good thing for investors? It depends. The fund
manager pays a penalty for not making money, which is a powerful incentive
to manage the fund well. However, the loss of a performance fee for more
than a year can be painful to the fund manager. If the fund loses a large
amount of money in its bad year, it may take a while for the asset values to
recover. Sometimes, a hedge fund manager will disband a fund after a losing
436
Book VI: Hedge Funds 

year and then launch a new fund instead of losing out on a few years of
performance fees. In the investment business, very good years often follow
very bad years, so disbanding the fund means that the fund’s investors lose
out on what could be a year of great performance that would help them
recoup their losses.
Graduated performance fees
Hedge fund investors may well be ready to accept the crunchy with the smooth,
so many want to reduce the fund manager’s incentive to disband the fund after
a loss. After all, a few years of poor performance may be part and parcel of a
great long-term investment strategy. Some funds address this desire of investors
by calling for graduated performance fees that may give the fund managers
some of the performance-fee money while they climb back up to the high water
mark. For example, a fund manager may receive a performance fee of 10 percent
of profits until the fund reaches the high water mark, at which point she gets the
full 20 percent of profits thereafter.
Redemption fees
You pay money while you’re in the hedge fund, and you may have to pay
money to get into the fund in the first place, but at least you’re off the hook
when you get out, right? Nope! Many hedge funds charge redemption fees
when their investors withdraw their money. These fees may be another 1 to 2
percent of assets. One reason funds charge redemption fees is that they can.
Another reason is that they increase the money that the fund manager earns.
But there are better reasons, too. Hedge funds want to impress upon their
limited partners that investment is a long-term proposition, so they can’t get
out easily. Also, the general partners have to deal with sales and administra-
tive costs involved with raising the money to meet the redemption.
A hedge fund that charges a redemption fee may waive it if it has held the
investment for a certain amount of time, or if you provide a certain amount of
notice about when you plan to withdraw the funds.
Commissions
If you employ a broker or consultant to find a suitable hedge fund for you,
and this person introduces you to the general partners, he or she will expect
to be paid for said services. The consultant may charge you a flat fee, or he
or she may take a percentage of the assets invested.

Getting Info from Hedge Fund Managers
Many hedge fund managers dream of sitting in front of trading screens and
making investment decisions all day. They want to avoid sitting in meetings,
holding the hands of their nervous clients, or making presentations to marketing
departments. Many hedge fund investors, on the other hand, want regular
contact with the people managing their money, and they want the niceties of
notes, golf outings, and occasional dinners. See the disconnect? That’s why 
it helps to know a fund manager’s policies on meetings and communication.
The partnership agreement you sign will probably discuss what kind of
communication the hedge fund manager wants to arrange and how often he’ll
make contact. If you feel like you have to have regular, face-to-face communica-
tion with the hedge fund manager you associate with, make sure a manager is
amenable to this request before you commit your money.
Even if she isn’t big on face-to-face meetings, your hedge fund manager
should offer you written reports:
 Quarterly report: This report should explain the fund’s investment
performance to date, giving you a sense of where the returns are relative
to the appropriate investment benchmarks and letting you know how
the market outlook suits the fund’s strategy.
 Annual report: Once a year, your fund manager should give you a
comprehensive report on the fund’s performance, including the total
value of the assets under management and the total fees charged. An
outside auditor should prepare this report — not the hedge fund
manager. Make sure of this before you sign up. You probably won’t get 
a comprehensive list of holdings, but you should get enough information
on industry and asset classes to get a sense of the fund’s overall risk-and-
return profile, which helps you evaluate how the fund’s performance fits
your portfolio needs.
Read through a prospective fund’s report archives before you invest to dis-
cover more about the fund’s investment style and communication philosophy.
Fund Partnerships: General and Limited
Most hedge funds are structured as lightly (if at all) regulated investment
partnerships, but that doesn’t mean that the partners within a fund are equal.
Some partners stand on higher ground than others, and the structure of the
fund affects the liability that investors may take on. If you buy into a hedge
fund, you enter into a partnership, and you need to know what rights and
obligations you have — especially if something goes wrong.
438
Book VI: Hedge Funds 

General partners: Controlling the fund
A hedge fund’s general partners are the founders and money managers of the
fund. These people have the following responsibilities:
 Form the fund
 Control the fund’s investment strategy
 Collect the fees charged
 Pay the bills
 Distribute the bonuses
In exchange for their control, general partners take on unlimited liability in
the fund, which means that their personal assets are at stake if the fund’s lia-
bilities exceed its assets. Many general partners own their stakes through S
corporations (an ownership structure for small businesses that under U.S. tax
code provides owners with limited liability and tax advantages) or other
structures that shield their personal assets.
A fund’s original general partners may grant the general-partner status to
certain key hires or give it as a reward to top-performing employees. Some
firms give the partnership in lieu of bonuses, and at other firms, managers
expect new partners to write checks to cover their shares of the partnership
stake. When general partners leave a fund, the other general partners buy out
their stakes.
Limited partners: Investing in the fund
The limited partners (often shortened to limiteds) of a hedge fund are the
people who invest in the fund — yep, you. When investors give their money
to the fund manager (a general partner) to invest, they take a stake in the
fund as a business. Limited partners can come in many different flavors:
 Individual investors, pension funds, or endowments
 Brokerage firms or investment companies that are sponsoring the fund’s
general partners
 Other partnerships or corporations formed to make investments in
hedge funds
439

Limited partnership has its drawbacks. Limited partners pay fees to the
general partners for their management services. They have little or no say in 
the fund’s operations. And the fund may restrict ongoing communication
with the general partners to only a few times per year. But in exchange for
these limitations of control, limited partners have limited liability. You can
lose only the amount you invest in the fund and no more. If the hedge fund
goes belly-up and a landlord comes looking for back rent, he can go after the
general partners and their personal assets, but he can’t come to the limited
partners and ask them for money.
Introducing Basic Types of Hedge Funds
You can sort hedge funds into two basic categories: absolute-return funds
and directional funds. The following sections look at the differences between
the two.
Hedge funds are small, private partnerships, and hedge fund managers can
use a wide range of strategies to meet their risk and return goals. For these
reasons, I can’t recommend any funds or fund families to you, and I can’t tell
you that any one strategy will be appropriate for any one type of investment.
That’s the downside of being a sophisticated, accredited investor: You have
to do a lot of work on your own!
Absolute-return funds
Sometimes called a “non-directional fund,” an absolute-return fund is designed
to generate a steady return no matter what the market is doing. An absolute-
return fund has another moniker: a pure-alpha fund. In theory, the fund man-
ager tries to remove all market risk (in other words, beta risk) in order to
create a fund that doesn’t vary with market performance. If the manager
removes all the market risk, the fund’s performance comes entirely from the
manager’s skill, which in academic terms is called alpha.
An absolute-return strategy is most appropriate for a conservative investor
who wants low risk and is willing to give up some return in exchange.
Some people say that absolute-return funds generate a bond-like return
because, like bonds, absolute-return funds have relatively steady but rela-
tively low returns. The return target on an absolute-return fund is usually
higher than the long-term rate of return on bonds, though. A typical absolute-
return fund target is 8 to 10 percent, which is above the long-term rate of
return on bonds and below the long-term rate of return on stocks.

Book VI: Hedge Funds 

Directional funds
Directional funds are hedge funds that don’t hedge — at least not fully. (See
the earlier section “Hedging: The heart of the hedge fund matter.”) Managers
of directional funds maintain some exposure to the market, but they try to
get higher-than-expected returns for the amount of risk that they take.
Because directional funds maintain some exposure to the stock market,
they’re sometimes called beta funds and are said to have a stock-like return. A
fund’s returns may not be steady from year to year, but they’re likely to be
higher over the long run than the returns on an absolute-return fund.
A directional fund’s return may be disproportionately larger than its risk, but
the risk is still there. These funds can also swing wildly, giving a big return
some years and plummeting big in others. Longer-term investors may not
mind as long as the upward trend is positive.
Is a Hedge Fund Right for You?
Hedge funds aren’t for everyone. If you don’t meet the SEC’s definition of an
accredited investor, you can’t invest in a hedge fund. And some hedge funds
go beyond the SEC requirements, making sure that all investors are qualified
purchasers. The following sections explain the requirements for both types
of investors.
Accredited investor
An accredited investor is an individual who can enter into a hedge fund due to
his or her financial standing. An investor is considered accredited if he or she
meets any of the following criteria:
 Has a net worth of more than $1 million, owned alone or jointly with a
spouse
 Has earned $200,000 in each of the past two years
 Has earned $300,000 in each of the past two years when combined with
a spouse
 Has a reasonable expectation of making the same amount in the future
For investment institutions, such as pensions, endowments, and trusts, the
primary qualification is having $5 million in assets.
441
Chapter 1: Getting the 411 on Hedge Funds
Book VI
Hedge
Funds

Qualified purchaser
Many hedge funds set a more stringent standard than the SEC, asking that
investors be qualified purchasers under their own internal guidelines.
Typically, qualified purchasers are individuals with at least $5 million in
investable assets. Trusts, endowments, and pensions must have at least $25
million in investable assets. Investors who meet a firm’s qualified-purchaser
standards are sometimes called super accredited.
Some firms may not set a qualified-purchaser standard, but they set their
minimum-investment standards for their limited partners high enough that
they may as well have a rule in place. For example, a hedge fund may demand
that its new investors put in at least $1 million or $5 million, which eliminates
a novice investor who has most of her wealth in her house and her IRA account.
Funds go above and beyond because of concerns that the accredited-investor
definition hasn’t been indexed for inflation. (It was last revised in 1982, when
a dollar was worth more than twice what it’s worth today.) Many people now
meet the definition thanks to appreciation in residential real estate or self-
directed retirement savings. An investor may have $1 million in assets, but
that doesn’t mean he’s knowledgeable enough or solvent enough to invest in
lightly regulated hedge funds.
Alternatives if you don’t qualify
If you don’t qualify for a hedge fund as an accredited or qualified investor,
you may be tempted to put this book down and pick up a copy of Frugal
Living For Dummies (by Deborah Taylor-Hough [Wiley]). That’s a good and
useful book, no matter your income, but don’t give up on this book just yet. If
you don’t qualify for a hedge fund outright, try the following:
 Use hedge fund strategies within a small portfolio: Understanding how
hedge funds work can help you make better choices among mutual funds
or help you balance a large position in your company’s stock. Chapter 4
outlines many of the strategies that hedge funds use to gain a high return.
 Find mutual funds that use hedge fund strategies: Some mutual fund
companies offer funds designed to capture the benefits of hedge funds
within the highly regulated mutual fund structure. Janus and Laudus
Rosenberg, for example, are among the companies that offer these funds.

How Hedge Funds Work
In This Chapter
 Exploring basic and alternative asset classes
 Investigating a fund’s research techniques
 Allocating assets within a portfolio/fund
 Bringing your financial needs to light
A
hedge fund manager’s job is to survey the world’s markets to find
investments that meet the fund’s risk and return parameters. But how
does the manager actually do it?
The fund manager has to have a system in place for determining what to invest
in and for how long. He looks for opportunities to make money in an asset that’s
going to change in price, and he looks to reduce the risk of the portfolio. Without
discipline, he can’t make good decisions, which makes your job of evaluating
performance impossible. Anyone who invests money has several available
techniques for increasing returns and reducing risk. Some hedge fund managers
simply do better research, and others rely on technical analysis, short-selling,
and leverage to generate the returns that their clients expect.
This chapter gives you a basic overview of the different financial assets
available and tells you how fund managers may value them. I hope to help
you understand what kinds of assets a hedge fund may invest in. I can’t give
you an easy answer as to how or whether these assets should be used in a
hedge fund, but armed with this information, you can make better investment
decisions for yourself and ask better questions of a hedge fund manager.

444
Book VI: Hedge Funds 
Examining Asset Options
Most investors should hold a diversified mix of securities in order to get their
optimal risk and return payoff. The exact proportion depends on your needs.
Likewise, hedge fund managers have different targets for risk and return, and
they turn to different assets in order to meet their targets.
A hedge fund or a group of hedge funds may use the assets you see here in
many different ways. Hedge fund managers often use traditional assets in
nontraditional ways, for example, so there are no hard and fast rules to rely
on. Chapter 4 covers some of the investment strategies and styles that hedge
funds use.
Traditional asset classes
Although many hedge funds pursue esoteric strategies and exotic assets,
most funds have some investment positions in ordinary investment classes.
The following sections give you a roundup of the usual suspects used to
manage risk and return in hedge funds. You may be surprised that they don’t
look much different from what you would see in any investment portfolio.
(For more information about traditional investments, go to Book II.)
Just because a hedge fund invests in securities doesn’t mean it’s playing it
safe. Some hedge funds buy very ordinary and safe securities, such as U.S.
government bonds, but they goose up the returns — and the risk — by using
borrowed money to finance almost the entire position.
Stocks
A stock (also called an equity) is a security that represents a fractional inter-
est in the ownership of a company. Hedge fund managers often buy and sell
stocks in order to meet their investment objectives.
A share of stock has limited liability, which means that you can lose your
entire investment, but no more than that. If the company files for bankruptcy,
creditors can’t come after shareholders for the money that the company
owes them.
Bonds
A company or a government issues a bond in order to raise money to cover
expenses or investments that can’t be funded out of current income or savings.
As a bond holder, you are essentially a creditor to the issuer of the bond. Hedge
fund managers invest in many different types of bonds at different times; it all
depends on the fund’s investment objectives, what techniques the fund uses,
and the prices in the market at any given time.

Cash and equivalents
Hedge fund managers have money readily available to purchase securities for
the portfolio or to meet customer redemptions. For the most part, the interest
rate on cash is very low, so hedge funds try to keep as little cash on hand as
possible. However, they do look for some cash and cash-equivalent investments
that can pay off handsomely. Other forms of money market securities include
the following:
 Short-term loans, collectively known as money market securities or cash
equivalents, which are expected to mature within 30 days or even
overnight
 Long-term bonds that are about to mature (say, a bond issued 15 years
ago that matures next week)
 Uninsured bank CDs
 Government securities that will mature within 90 days
Alternative assets
An alternative investment is anything other than stocks, bonds, or cash. Hedge
fund managers, sniffing out opportunities to meet their investment objectives,
often turn to the alternative assets outlined in the following subsections.
Hedge funds themselves are often considered to be an alternative investment
class, but they shouldn’t be. A hedge fund is an investment vehicle. Because
of their light regulations and limits on withdrawals, hedge funds have more
freedom to invest in alternative asset classes. They may be structured with a
risk profile that’s completely different from a traditional asset, but they’re not
in and of themselves alternative assets.
Real estate
Real estate isn’t always considered an investment. In most cases, it’s a store
of value, which is an excellent hedge against inflation. In other words, over
the long run, you expect the price to increase by inflation and not much
more. This expectation is particularly appropriate for raw land and, believe it
or not, single-family houses.
Real estate can be an investment, too. An office or apartment building generates
a steady flow of rental income in addition to the stored value of the land.
Agricultural real estate, including timberland, generates a steady flow of income
from the sale of the commodities produced. Real estate that contains minerals
generates profits when the minerals are extracted and sold.
445
Chapter 2: Looking before You Leap: How Hedge Funds Work
Book VI
Hedge
Funds

Hedge funds rarely purchase raw land for investment purposes, but they may
provide lending to real estate investors, help finance construction projects, or
take shares in mineral projects (see the following section for more information).
Commodities
Commodities, explained in detail in Book IV, are popular as a hedge against
inflation and uncertainty because commodity prices tend to increase at the
same rate as prices in the overall economy, meaning that they maintain their
real (inflation-adjusted) value. A hedge fund probably won’t buy commodities
outright, but it may take a stake in them in one of a few different manners:
 By purchasing real estate that generates income from commodities
produced
 Through futures contracts, which change in price with the underlying
commodities (see the upcoming “Futures” section)
 By managing its stock investments based on the exposure of the company
issuing the stock to different commodity trends
Venture capital
Great entrepreneurs often have fabulous ideas held captive by thin wallets.
To fund their business ideas, they look for investors willing to take great risks
in hopes of high returns. Such investors provide the start-up capital. Examples
of businesses started by venture capital? Google, Yahoo!, and America 
Online — all of which succeeded fabulously — as well as countless others
you’ve never heard of that failed miserably.
Many hedge funds are in the business of taking on high risk in exchange for
potential high returns, so venture capital fits neatly. Some hedge funds
become partners in venture capital firms, and others seek out promising new
businesses to invest in directly. (See Chapter 4 for more on venture capital.)
Derivatives
To manage risk, hedge funds often use derivatives, financial contracts that
draw their value from the value of an underlying asset, security, or index. By
selling an S&P 500 future, for example, a fund can effectively sell off its exposure
to the stock market. This action helps the fund maintain its market-neutral
position. Other hedge funds use derivatives to increase return or reduce
other forms of risk, such as interest rate or currency risk. A handful of funds
invest only in derivatives.
Options
Hedge funds sometimes use options to manage risk or to profit from price
changes. An option is a contract that gives the holder the right, but not the
obligation, to buy or sell the underlying asset at an agreed-upon price at an
446
Book VI: Hedge Funds 

agreed-upon date in the future. An option that gives you the right to buy is a
call, and an option that gives you the right to sell is a put. A call is most valuable
if the stock price is going up, whereas a put has more value if the stock price
is going down. Head to Book III for more information on options.
Warrants and convertible bonds
Hedge funds sometimes use warrants and convertible bonds to manage risk
or to profit from price changes. A warrant is similar to an option, but it’s
issued by a company instead of being sold on an organized exchange. It gives
the holder the right to buy more stock in the company at an agreed-upon
price in the future. Company-issued employee stock options are more like
warrants than exchange-traded stock options. Related to the warrant is the
convertible bond, which is debt issued by the company. The company pays
interest on the bond, and the bondholder has the right to exchange it for
stock. Which option the holder should exercise depends on interest rates
and the stock price.
Futures
Futures contracts, covered in detail in Book III, are useful for hedge fund
managers who want to lock in prices. They also give managers exposure to
commodity prices without having to handle the actual assets. Some hedge
funds also use futures contracts to speculate — to make bets that the price 
of the underlying assets will go up or down in price. Futures contracts are
highly liquid — they’re easy to trade — which makes them attractive for a
hedge fund that wants to take a very short-term position in an asset class.
Forward contracts
With a forward contract, an investor buys a currency, commodity, or other
asset now at the market price, but the delivery doesn’t take place until an
agreed-upon future time. This strategy allows an investor to lock in the
current price. In many cases, a hedge fund manager uses forward contracts
to cover a futures contract; the manager locks in the current price in hopes
that the future value is different, creating a profit on the difference. The
difference is known as the spread.
Swaps
A swap is an exchange of one cash flow for another. Say a company has issued
bonds that pay interest in U.S. dollars, but decides to incur expenses in Japanese
yen to offset profits that it makes in Japan. The company finds another company
making payments in yen that would rather be making payments in dollars, and
they swap payments. As a result, each company can better manage its internal
currency risk. In many cases, one or both parties in the transaction are banks
or financial services firms, like hedge funds. The fund looks to profit on the
difference between the different currencies, different interest-rate structures,
or different payment times.

Custom products and private deals
Hedge funds often participate in private transactions and offbeat investments
so they can meet their desired risk and return characteristics better than they
can with readily traded securities. Contract law governs private transactions;
only rarely does the Securities and Exchange Commission have any say in
them. This section discusses a few such private transactions, but you may
come across many others.
Mezzanine financing
Mezzanine financing is a combination of debt and equity used to support a
company until it can go to the public markets. The debt and equity may be
used as late-stage venture capital, when the new business isn’t quite ready to
sell its stock to the public, or it can go toward financing an acquisition. The
lenders of the financing don’t get paid until the company settles all other
debts, making the financing almost like equity in that mezzanine lenders can
lose everything if the company goes bankrupt.
Payment-in-kind bonds
Companies in financial trouble often issue payment-in-kind bonds. Instead of
paying interest on its debt, the company gives the investors that own its
bonds, known as bondholders, other bonds or securities, which creates many
interesting trading opportunities. For example, a hedge fund manager may
notice that the price of a payment-in-kind bond doesn’t fully reflect the value
of the bonds that the company will pay out in place of interest. Hedge funds
like these opportunities.
Tranches
Bonds are often issued in several classes, known as tranches. (Tranche is the
French word for “slice”; in essence, a security is sliced up into smaller securities
when it’s issued in tranches.) Each tranche may have a different interest rate
and payment term. For example, one tranche may pay interest only after the
first three years. Another may be a zero-coupon bond, which helps a company
meet unique cash-flow needs. Tranches are often designed with the buyer’s
needs in mind as well. A hedge fund or other bond buyer may be looking for a
structure that fits in with its overall portfolio construction, and a unique
tranche may be a good fit.
Viaticals
A viatical is a life insurance policy purchased from the insured as an investment.
Many terminally ill people need money now. They have life insurance policies
with big benefits, but their policies aren’t helping the sick today. So, these sick
people find investors who are willing to give them money now in exchange for
the death benefits later. Viaticals are enormously risky investments, because
448
Book VI: Hedge Funds 

sick people get better and researchers develop new cures all the time. And
because the time to maturity is unknown, viaticals are difficult to price.
Researching a Security’s Value
Each hedge fund manager needs a system for figuring out the price at which
to buy or sell a security. The following sections outline common analytical
approaches.
Top-down analysis
Top-down fundamental analysis examines the overall state of the economy.
The researcher uses the findings to identify specific assets that he or she
expects to benefit or suffer from changes in the overall state of the economy,
like price increases, employment levels, and interest rates. A top-down analyst,
for example, may look at consumer debt levels, project future changes, and
then look for companies affected by the changes. Will an increase in consumer
debt help or hurt car and appliance manufacturers? High-end retailers? Bargain
retailers? Financial service firms that emphasize lending or savings? If the
researcher has a framework in place for analyzing the trends of the overall
changes in the economy, he or she can select companies expected to change
in price and structure the portfolio accordingly.
Top-down investing is sometimes called theme investing because a fund
manager looks for a handful of broad trends and invests based on those
trends. The fund may look to benefit from an aging population, higher energy
prices, or increased defense spending, for example. In some cases, a firm may
have a portfolio strategist who works to determine the themes. The firm’s
other analysts, who may use different analytical approaches, have to narrow
their search to securities that fit the themes.
One major theme of top-down fundamental research is the use of economic
analysis. Hedge funds often use economic analysis as part of their investment
strategies, no matter their overall research styles. And if the funds invest in
several of the world’s markets, economic analysis is especially important. Hedge
fund managers perform economic analysis in order to determine the best
ways to profit from changes in economic trends, like inflation, unemployment,
interest rates, or growth in a nation’s gross domestic product. Most hedge
fund managers at least think about the underlying economy when making
investment decisions, and some hedge funds, known as macro funds, base
their entire strategy around economic changes.
The following sections explore the different levels of economic analysis
within top-down research.
449
Chapter 2: Looking before You Leap: How Hedge Funds Work
Book VI
Hedge
Funds

A microeconomic approach
Microeconomics relates to the structure of small units in the economy, like
individual companies or households. Microeconomic analysis looks at condi-
tions, like how much competition or regulation exists in a market, how easy 
it is for new companies to enter a market, and how taxes cause a specific
company to behave. Microeconomic analysis is practically synonymous with
fundamental research, because the hedge fund manager wants to know how
changes in prices, competition, and product trends affect the prospects for a
given company.
A macroeconomic approach
Macroeconomics looks at the overall national or even global economy.
Macroeconomic analysis is concerned with exchange rates, interest rates,
price levels, growth, and employment. Hedge funds that invest heavily in
government bonds, financial derivatives, and currencies generally pay atten-
tion to macroeconomic analysis. Managers of these funds use data published
by government agencies, central banks, and nongovernmental organizations
such as the United Nations and the World Bank to develop forecasts for
changes in price levels.
Secular versus cyclical trends
Trends fall into two categories: secular and cyclical. A cyclical trend is related
to economic cycles. For example, when employment improves, more people
are working, and these new employees need clothes to wear to work, so they
buy more threads, increasing revenue for apparel companies.
A secular trend represents a fundamental shift in the market, regardless of the
cyclical trends. A secular trend in the clothing industry, for example, is the
move toward casual dress in the office. In the 1990s, the economy boomed
and white-collar employment grew, but folks were wearing khakis and golf
shirts rather than suits and ties. Sales were strong at retailers that sold
casual apparel, but sales dropped off at traditional suit makers. Even if
professionals bought their golf shirts at suit stores, they spent less money
than they would’ve on crisp white shirts and expensive silk ties.
The challenge for an investor is separating the cyclical economic trend,
which is temporary, from the secular economic one, which is not.
Demographics
Understanding the nature of the demographics within a population can help
hedge fund managers make better decisions and separate cyclical from secular
trends. Companies need to worry about the demographics of their employee
and customer bases, and nations need to worry about the people within their
borders. Young populations tend to have cheap, unskilled workers, and older
demographics usually have highly skilled, experienced, and expensive work
450
Book VI: Hedge Funds 

forces. Young people tend to borrow money to spend; older people spend
their savings; and people in the middle tend to set aside more than they
spend.
Bottom-up analysis
A bottom-up analyst looks for individual companies that he expects to do
especially well or especially poorly in the future. The analyst starts his
research by examining the company itself: its financial statements, its history,
its product line, the quality of its management, and so on. He then makes a
judgment about the company’s value on its own merits. He incorporates broad
market trends only as they directly affect the business, which sets bottom-up
analysis apart from top-down analysis.
A subset of bottom-up research is known as the story stock: an offbeat company
with complex products or unusual circumstances that require elaborate explana-
tions. Sometimes story stocks prove to be good investments — meaning that
they go up in price as those who tell the stories expect them to — especially if
the companies are harbingers of change in their industries. Other times, these
companies make good shorts (see Chapter 4 for more information on short-
selling).
Accounting research
Some bottom-up analysts look only at a company’s reported financial state-
ments, ignoring other aspects of its business. These people look for evidence
of fraud, unsustainable growth, or hidden assets. This examination is known
as accounting research. Often accountants themselves, the accounting analysts
who examine the companies understand the many nuances and judgment calls
that go into preparing financial statements. In most cases, the goal of account-
ing research is to identify potential short ideas.
Quantitative research
Quantitative research looks strictly at numbers. These numbers may represent
accounting figures (for example, accounts receivable relative to sales), or
they may be sensitivity factors (for example, how much a company’s profit
changes when oil prices increase by 1 percent). Quantitative analysts, often
called quants, tend to put the information they find into complex mathematical
models, and the solutions that result correspond to the securities that investors
should put into the portfolio. Firms that rely heavily on quantitative analysis
451
Chapter 2: Looking before You Leap: How Hedge Funds Work
Book VI
Hedge
Funds

are often called black-box shops because the quants put numbers into a
computer, which then spits out the portfolio selection, and only a handful of
people understand how this system works.
Technical analysis
Technical analysis involves looking at charts of the price and volume of trading
in a security. The charts show the historic supply and demand for the security,
which may indicate where future prices are heading. The information shows a
measure of sentiment. Analysts look to any number of questions: Is the number
of buy orders increasing? Are the orders increasing while the price goes up or
while the price goes down? Is the stock’s price rising steadily, or does it go up
in bursts around news announcements? Technical analysts use the answers to
these types of questions to make investment decisions.
Few funds rely on technical analysis exclusively, but many use it regularly as
a check on their fundamental research. Technical analysis is complicated,
which means that the dabbler can run into trouble. For information on how
to perform this type of analysis, go to Book VIII.
Putting the Findings to Work
So, what happens when a hedge fund’s research identifies some great oppor-
tunities in different assets? Well, the fund takes a position. It can go long (buy
in hopes that the asset goes up) or go short (sell in hopes that the asset goes
down). The fund can also trade securities, monitor positions that may pay off
in the future, or look for other ways to turn the information into a return for
the hedge fund investor. These options are discussed in the pages that follow.
The long story: Buying appreciating assets
When a hedge fund manager or other investor buys a security, he or she is said
to be long. An investor has only one reason to go long: He or she thinks that the
asset will go up in price. Some hedge fund managers look for longs that will
work over an extended period of time — possibly years — and others prefer to
make their profits over very small stretches of time — possibly seconds.
452
Book VI: Hedge Funds 

Buying low, selling high
The secret of making money is buying low and selling high. So what marks
low and high? Answering this question is where research comes in. The
research sets the price targets for establishing and selling the position. The
fund buys the security (with cash on hand or with leverage; see Chapter 4)
and holds it until it reaches a higher price or sells it if it becomes clear that
the investment isn’t working out. The difference between the purchase price
and the sale price — adjusted for borrowing, interest, and commissions — is
the profit (or loss) for the position.
Trading for the short term
The hedge fund structures of light regulation, limited investor liquidity, and
maximum return for a given level of risk very much favor trading. For this
reason, many hedge funds are aggressive traders: They often take positions
for only a very short time. They look to capture small increases in price, but
they do it every day, over and over again, so that the amounts compound
into a very large return.
Holding for the long term
Some hedge funds take a long-term outlook with their securities, meaning
they buy and hold to establish a position and then wait weeks, months, or
even years to be proven right. The buy-and-hold style is less common in hedge
funds than in other investment vehicles, such as mutual funds or individual
accounts, because the hedge fund structure is less of an advantage to the
investor with a long-term outlook than to the active trader. Still, many hedge
funds do buy and hold — especially if they’re playing with private and illiquid
investments (see the section “Custom products and private deals” earlier in
this chapter).
The short story: Selling depreciating assets
Hedge funds can make money by selling securities, and not necessarily securities
that they own. A short-seller borrows a security from someone else (usually
from a brokerage firm’s inventory) and then sells it. After a while — ideally,
after the security goes down in price — the short-seller buys back the security
in the market and repays the loan with the asset that he originally borrowed.
The lender doesn’t have to repay the original dollar value, just the security in
question. The profit (or loss) is the difference between where the short-seller
sold the security and where he bought it back, less commissions and interest
charged by the lender. (See Chapter 4 for more on short-selling.)
453
Chapter 2: Looking before You Leap: How Hedge Funds Work
Book VI
Hedge
Funds

Protecting long positions
Short-selling reduces risk. By selling off part of the risk, the fund can make
money while hedging the long position. For example, if a fund’s quantitative
research finds that a given investment is heavily exposed to the price of oil,
the fund can get rid of that risk by shorting oil futures. The fund offsets any
gain or loss in the investment’s price caused by sensitivity to oil with the gain
or loss of the futures position.
Investment shorts
An investment short is a short-sell taken in a legitimate business that the fund
doesn’t expect to do well. A fund may make the decision to go with an invest-
ment short as part of a matching long position in a competitor that it expects
to do well, as part of a risk-management maneuver, or purely for investment
success.
Fraud shorts
A fraud short is an investment that the fund expects to go down in value because
of suspicions that the company is guilty of misrepresenting its products, its
financial results, or its management (see the section “Accounting research”).
These investments are rare, but funds make a few of them every year. A fraud
short is risky stuff, the management of a company that a fund heavily shorts
will probably fight back, sometimes with ugly tactics, and short-sellers who
are anxious to get the news flow moving in their favor have been known to
resort to lies and threats.
Naked shorts
A fund exacts a naked short when it sells a security that it hasn’t borrowed in
hopes that it will go down fast enough that the fund can buy back the security
and settle with the buyer. Naked shorting is against exchange regulations in
most markets, but it still happens. The advantage for the fund is that it can
sell short without paying interest to the lender, and it can sell short even if no
lender will loan the fund the security. The downside is that if the fund can’t
repurchase the security in time to settle its sale, the exchanges will find out
and probably shut down the fund.
Because of the illicit nature of the technique, you shouldn’t invest in any fund
that admits to naked shorting.
454
Book VI: Hedge Funds 

Final Considerations Before You Jump In
Hedge funds are both illiquid and lightly regulated. Because your money is
likely to be tied up for an extended period and the fund itself won’t necessar-
ily fall under the scrutiny of any regulatory body, the onus is on you to be a
savvy investor. Before signing an agreement with any hedge fund manager —
even the one your investment banker friend swears by — you need to take a
close look at your own specific financial goals, figure out how much you can
afford to invest in a hedge fund scheme, and consider what type of asset allo-
cation is most likely to mesh with the other investments in your portfolio.
Determining the size of your
hedge fund allocation
Because of their illiquidity (see Chapter 1), hedge funds are seldom appropri-
ate for an entire investment portfolio. In almost all cases, hedge funds offer
their maximum portfolio benefit in relatively small doses. In fact, hedge funds
are mostly designed as investment vehicles for excess capital: money that the
investor doesn’t need now and doesn’t need to support near-term spending.
Suppose, for example, that you’re in charge of making investment decisions
for a trust fund worth $20 million. You need to generate $600,000 in annual
income. In most cases, a 5 percent income is reasonable for a minimum long-
term return assumption for a mixed stock and bond portfolio. So, you start
with the $600,000 income need and divide it by 5 percent to determine how
much of the portfolio you should put in stocks and bonds. The answer: $12
million. The remaining amount of the portfolio is considered excess capital.
You can lock up and invest this money at a higher risk level than the rest of
the portfolio because you don’t need it to support your income needs.
Although you don’t want to lose that money, losing it wouldn’t affect the min-
imum portfolio objective of generating $600,000 in annual income.
Determining your financial goals
The answers to two questions go a long way toward determining how to
invest your money and what to invest it in:
 When do you need your money?
 What do you need your money for?
Your answers influence the risk you can take, the return you need to shoot for,
the asset classes that are open to you, and how much time you can allocate
toward the investment.

Chapter 2: Looking before You Leap: How Hedge Funds Work
Book VI
Hedge
Funds

Generally speaking, investable money falls into three categories:
 Temporary (or short-term) funds that you’ll need in a year. Hedge funds
charge high fees (see Chapter 1). Because fund managers need time to
earn these fees, they want money that investors can set aside for long
periods.
 Matched assets that you invest to meet a specific liability, like a college
education. Whether a hedge fund is an appropriate match for an upcoming
financial need depends in large part on the risk profile of the hedge fund.
An absolute-return fund, which is designed to have low risk and a steady,
low return (see Chapter 1), is usually a good match with an intermedi-
ate-term obligation, for money that you don’t need until after you meet
any lockup periods on the fund. Directional funds, which pursue high-
risk strategies in exchange for higher expected returns, are a better
match for financial needs that reach far into the future.
 Permanent funds that you invest for such a long term that, for all practical
purposes, you’ll never spend them. Instead investors plan to spend only
the income generated from the investments’ interest and dividends. They
can then reinvest the capital gains so that the initial amounts invested
get larger, which causes the amount of income that the investments can
generate to grow. Permanent funds are often great investment candidates
for hedge funds. Most hedge funds are designed to generate steady capital
gains, and they limit withdrawals, so your fund’s money should build up
over time.
Few managers structure hedge funds to generate income, so if producing
income is one of your key investment objectives, you should allocate your
funds to other types of investments, like bonds or dividend-paying stocks.
Allocating your assets: 
Finding the right mix
As stated in Chapter 1, hedge funds fall into two broad categories: absolute-
return, which is designed to produce a steady but relatively low rate of return
with relatively little risk, and directional, which aims for the highest possible
return, although with a high level of risk. Within these categories are many
different strategies and asset concentrations, as Chapter 4 explains.
Different assets — real (tangible) and financial (securities) — have different
sources of return and present different tradeoffs, and you want a balance of
them in your portfolio. Table 2-1 summarizes many types of financial assets.

When choosing a hedge fund (whose manager chooses assets to invest in) to
fit into your portfolio, you need to think about how it will act with the other
investments in your portfolio because different asset classes interact with
your other investments differently. For example, if you mostly invest in
domestic stocks and bonds, you may want to put your hedge fund allocation
into macro funds because those will have more international exposure. This
strategy will reduce the risk of your overall portfolio better than a U.S. long-
short equity fund.
You also want to find a fund whose strategy jibes with your investment 
needs — a task that’s fairly difficult when hedge fund managers often don’t
want to tell investors what strategies they’re following or where they invest
their money. Chapter 3 gives a list of questions you can ask as you interview
prospective hedge fund managers to gather the information you need.
Matching goals to money
Asset allocation is the process of matching your investment goals to your money
in order to meet your goals with the lowest possible amount of risk. Do you
need to generate $100,000 in pre-tax annual income from your investments? Are
current interest rates at 4 percent? If so, you should put $4 million in fixed-
income securities with an average coupon (annual interest rate) of 4 percent. Do
you need $10 million in 20 years to meet a contractual obligation? Do you think
that an 8 percent return is acceptable as long as you experience little variation
between your expected return and the return that you get? If so, you should put
$2.2 million in a hedge fund with an absolute-return strategy.
457
Chapter 2: Looking before You Leap: How Hedge Funds Work
Book VI
Hedge
Funds

The exact amounts and investments you choose will vary with your means and
your goals. Any professional advisors you work with should take the time to
find out what you need. Beware of advisors who try to sell you products with-
out finding out what your needs are. It’s not only against regulations (a violation
of the know-your-customer and suitability rules), but also bad for you.
Chasing return versus allocating assets
“I don’t care what fund you put me in, as long as it performs well. How about
this fund that was up 40 percent last year?” Whoa, cowboy! Unfortunately,
that’s a common strategy among investors, and it’s a dangerous one. Known
as chasing return, this strategy ignores long-term goals, near-term constraints,
and good investing principles in hopes of landing the big bucks right now.
Return chasers are doomed to fail in the long run, and often in the short run,
too. Markets move in cycles, so last year’s hot performer will probably cool
off this year. Moving your money around too much leads to plenty of taxes
and commission charges that eat into your investment base. And without a
sense of how much money you really need, when you need it, and with what
degree of certainty you’re operating, you risk choosing investments that miss
your goals by a mile.

In This Chapter
 Paying attention to pricing issues in the fund
 Buying into a fund, step by step
 Managing liquidity after you enter a fund
 Making sense of hedge fund reports
 Taking care of investment taxes
A
n open-end mutual fund (described in Book II, Chapter 3) continuously
offers stock to the public. You find a fund that interests you; you read
the prospectus that the fund issues; you fill out a form; you write your check;
and viola! You’re a mutual fund shareholder. A hedge fund is nothing like that.
When you enter into a hedge fund, you join a private-investment partnership.
Step foot in the hedge fund world, and you may discover, as Dorothy did, that
you’re not in Kansas anymore.
To help you navigate your way into and around hedge funds, this chapter
explains how to choose the fund that’s right for you, how to purchase a stake
in the fund, what to do after you’re a partner, and how to read the hedge fund
reports. Finally, as an investor who’s (we hope!) making money, you need to
know what your tax obligations are. This chapter covers that topic, too.
Investor, Come on Down: Pricing Funds
When you buy into a hedge fund or cash out your shares, you need to know
what the shares are worth. When a fund forms, setting the price is simple:
The total value of the fund is the total value of the cash put into it. If the fund
disbands, setting the prices is also simple: The hedge fund manager sells all
the securities, pays all the bills, and distributes the remainder proportion-
ately. Of course, you also need to know what the shares are worth to calcu-
late performance. (See Chapter 5 for more information on performance
calculation.)

This section covers net asset value calculation, including dealing with illiquid
securities. With the use of these tools, you’ll have a sense of how the fund
comes up with the value of your investment.
Prices are all over the place, as are minimum investments. Some funds report
values to consultants annually or quarterly, but many don’t. Some funds will
take $25,000 investments, and others insist on $10 million.
Calculating net asset value
Hedge funds are priced on their net asset value. Also called book value, net
asset value is the total of all the fund’s assets minus all the fund’s liabilities.
Sounds simple, right? Well, here’s a catch: finding the value for all the fund’s
securities, calculated at the end of each trading day, when the end of the
trading day varies depending on when markets close around the world.
If a fund invests entirely in one market and one type of investment, the pric-
ing is straightforward. The New York Stock Exchange closes at 4 p.m. Eastern
Time, so if all your investments trade there, you simply price at the close. But
in a global market, who decides when the trading day ends? What if you also
have futures (financial contracts that trade on a different exchange)? And if
assets are in constant motion, when does the clock stop so you can calculate
net asset value? All these things need to be taken into account when calculat-
ing net asset value.
One way to calculate net asset value is to add the values at the closing time
for each relevant market. The price then would be the sum of the prices at
each market’s close (ignoring after-market trading). For example, if your
security trades in these exchanges and has a closing value as indicated, the
net asset value would be $2,138.

No calculation method is inherently better; the key is that the method is dis-
closed and applied consistently. Be sure to ask the fund manager when and
how the fund calculates the value. It should be spelled out in the contracts
that you sign when you enter the fund.

Book VI: Hedge Funds 

Valuing illiquid securities
Because hedge funds can limit how often clients withdraw money, and
because they tend to take a broad view of possible investments, they often
put money in illiquid securities — investments that don’t trade very often and
are difficult to sell on short notice.
Short-term buying and selling can have an enormous impact on the prices of
securities. If an asset trades all the time, the value is widely known. It’s easy
to know what a share of Microsoft stock is worth because millions of shares
are bought and sold every day, for example. If an asset doesn’t trade often,
you have little observable, unbiased market indicator of what the true price
should be. To get around this situation, hedge funds have many techniques
to assign values to illiquid securities (see Chapter 5 for more details):
 Net present value: The discounted value of all the expected cash flows
 Black-Scholes: A complicated mathematical model used to find the value
of an option
 Relative valuation: Basing the security’s price on a similar security that
trades frequently
If a hedge fund you’re interested in invests in illiquid securities, find out what
its policy for valuation is. And know that you take on some risk if the fund buys
a lot of these assets; the price assigned to the fund may not hold when the
illiquid securities have to be sold (quite a catchy rhyme, don’t you think?).
Managing side pockets
A side pocket in a hedge fund is a group of securities held by only some of the
fund’s investors. Hedge funds set up side pockets — also called designated
investments or special investments — for two main reasons:
 To hold illiquid securities away from money that investors can
redeem. For example, the fund may allow investors to pull money out of
the main part of the fund once per quarter, but it may decide that
investors can redeem funds in the side pocket only once every two
years. Likewise, new fund investors can’t enter into the side pocket so
that the valuation of those investments doesn’t become an issue for
them. If you invest in a fund that’s just starting out, part of your invest-
ment may be held in a side pocket.
 To allow certain fund investors access to securities that other investors
many not have. The fund may provide performance enticements or other
461
Chapter 3: Taking the Plunge
Book VI
Hedge
Funds

special benefits that attract specific investors. A fund may also set up a
side pocket to meet the needs of a large institutional investor that can
put a great deal of money into the fund.
Side pockets are priced separately from the rest of the fund. Because they’re
often set up just to hold illiquid investments, their price may be more uncertain.
Due Diligence: Picking a Hedge Fund
Because hedge funds are structured as partnerships (see Chapter 1), you
enter into a relatively intimate business relationship with the fund manager
when you buy into the fund. The better prepared you are, the better the rela-
tionship will be. If you do the work necessary to know that the fund manager
is who he says he is, you’ll have a greater level of trust. Although a consultant
may help you evaluate a fund manager, you still need to do your own
research. The following sections explain how.
Knowing what to ask
One of the first steps in determining if a particular hedge fund makes sense
for you is to ask a lot of questions. After you assure the hedge fund manager
that you’re a serious investor (both accredited and able to invest in the fund
now; see Chapter 1), you’ll probably receive an offering document that answers
some of your questions — and raises others. No matter how thorough the
offering document is, you’ll have to sit down for an interview with the fund
manager or submit a list of questions to the fund’s staff.
Here’s a list of questions to get you started. Your offering document will
cover some; some you’ll ask in an interview; and some you may have to find
answers to on your own. You probably want to get an answer for each one,
and you may well come up with other questions to ask.
 Investment strategy:
• What’s your investment objective? How do you achieve alpha (see
Chapter 1)?
• How did you construct your portfolio? How and why is it rebalanced?
• What’s your analysis and investment style? What would cause you
to deviate from your style?
• If you use computer models, do you ever override them? Do you
change the models?
462
Book VI: Hedge Funds 

• What’s the average number of positions your fund holds? How long
do you hold a typical position? What’s the level of portfolio turnover?
• Do you use sub-advisors? (Sub-advisors are money managers who
handle a portion of the portfolio.) When and why? How do you
compensate them?
• Do you see yourself as a trader, an investor, or an analyst?
• Why is your fund different from others with the same investment
style? What edge do you have over other managers?
• Is your fund more suitable for taxable investors or for tax-exempt
ones?
• How does your fund keep enough liquidity to meet allowed 
withdrawals?
 Performance:
• What have been your worst months? Your best months? Why?
• Did you earn your performance evenly in the past year, or did you
have one or two really good months? If so, what made those
months so good for your strategy?
• What was the time (the peak-to-trough range) between your best
month and your worst month?
• What holdings have worked out the best for you? Which one was
your worst ever? Why?
• Who calculates your fund’s returns? How often? Where does this
person get his/her data: from the prime broker or from the fund
manager?
• How do you value the portfolio? When do you price it? How do you
handle illiquid securities?
• Is your performance GIPS (Global Investment Performance
Standards) compliant? If not, why not? Do you report your perfor-
mance to Morningstar or other tracking services?
 Risk management:
• How does your fund use leverage (see Chapter 4)? What’s the aver-
age leverage? What’s the maximum leverage allowed? How often
are you near those limits?
• Does your fund always have some leverage?
• Does your fund borrow from one bank or broker, or from several?
• What’s your maximum exposure to any one security? Any one
market? How often are you near those limits?
463
Chapter 3: Taking the Plunge
Book VI
Hedge
Funds

• How much of your borrowing is overnight? Short-term? Long-term?
How has that changed over time?
• How do you define risk? What’s your firm’s attitude toward risk?
• What risks have you identified? What are your strategies for man-
aging them?
• What happens if a trader exceeds his or her limits?
• What are your long-tail risk scenarios?
• Do you use derivatives to hedge? To speculate?
• Do you try to profit from, or hedge against, interest-rate risk?
Currency risk? Market risk?
 Fund operations:
• Who are your fund’s founders? Are they still with you? If they’ve
left, why did they leave and where did they go?
• How do you compensate your traders? What’s the turnover of your
investment staff? Of your total staff?
• How much do the fund principals have invested in the fund? Is this
a good portion of their net worth?
• How do you keep the front and back office separated?
• Who is the asset custodian?
• What are your data-backup and disaster-recovery plans? How
quickly could you get back into business if your building 
shut down?
• Who takes over if the fund manager is incapacitated or dies? What
is the key person risk?
• What are your data-security practices?
• Is the fund audited annually? If not, why not? If yours is a new fund,
have you lined up an auditor to do an audit at the end of the year?
• What’s your accounting firm? Your law firm? Your prime broker?
Your administrative-services firm?
 Compliance and transparency:
• What are your compliance policies and procedures? May I see them?
• Are you registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission?
With the Commodity Futures Trading Commission? Why or why not?
• How much disclosure and reporting can I expect? How much trans-
parency should any hedge fund investor expect?

Book VI: Hedge Funds 

Interviewing the hedge fund manager
Getting to know the hedge fund manager on the other side of the table is a
good idea. When you talk to a fund manager, you get a sense of what it will be
like doing business with this person. You want to make sure that the fund fits
your needs and that you’re comfortable with the fund’s strategy and the fund
manager’s personality.
The hedge fund manager probably won’t tell you everything. For example,
she probably won’t discuss the fund’s short positions (securities that the
fund borrows from others and then sells in hopes that they’ll go down in
price) or even its long positions. She should, however, tell you about the 
following:
 How the fund goes about getting its return
 How she manages risk
 What types of securities she invests in
 How fund operations are handled
With this information, you’ll know if the fund’s investment strategies, risk-
and-return parameters, and administration situation are logical and if they fit
your investment needs.
Poring over fund literature
After you arm yourself with the right questions and get some answers, 
your next step is to check up on the information you receive. One way to do
this is by reviewing the firm’s literature. A hedge fund manager will give a
prospective investor thick legal documents after he or she is satisfied that
the investor is accredited and serious about investing in the fund. The docu-
ments lay out the investment policies that govern the fund and its opera-
tions. The hedge fund manager may also hand accredited and interested
prospective investors glossy decks of PowerPoint slides or other sales mate-
rials that explain the fund’s investment policies and operations with less
legalese.
The information in these legal documents and marketing materials includes
the fund’s investment strategy and fees, as well as biographical information
on the people who run the fund. You can use these resources to make a list of
information you want to verify elsewhere and to come up with questions that
you still consider unanswered.
465
Chapter 3: Taking the Plunge
Book VI
Hedge
Funds

Picking up the phone
Another important step in the due-diligence process is to call former employ-
ees of the fund you’re interested in and others to verify the information
you’ve received through interviews and literature and that appears on the
hedge fund manager’s résumé. The fund manager should give you reference
names and contact information for the resources you want to investigate.
Here’s a list of people you should call:
 Former employees: They may restrict their details to only dates of hire
and positions held, but that information is useful — especially if it doesn’t
match with what the hedge fund manager tells you. If you can talk to a
former fund colleague in depth, consider asking about the following
topics:
• How the fund manager researched and made trades
• How the manager worked with others on staff
• How the manager worked with clients
• How the fund manager affected this person’s performance in his
old position
 Universities and colleges: Be sure to call the colleges listed on the
hedge fund manager’s résumé. Many folks have an unfortunate habit of
lying about or embellishing their educational backgrounds, so you
should verify the degrees that the hedge fund manager claims from the
schools that he says he attended.
 Associated firms: Call the law firm that the hedge fund lists as its coun-
sel, as well as the hedge fund’s accounting firm, prime broker, and
administrative-services firm. You want to make sure that these firms are
providing the services that the manager says they are, and you want to
make sure that the relationships are good ones.
 Current investors: You may also be able to talk to current investors in
the hedge fund. If so, you should ask them for the following information:
• Why they chose this fund
• If the fund’s performance has met their expectations
• What type of communication they’ve received from the hedge fund
manager
Even if the list has a former employee’s or current investor’s direct line or
personal cell phone, go through the organization’s main switchboard and ask
to be connected. In the unlikely event that a fraud is hot on your trail, you
466
Book VI: Hedge Funds 

can catch it faster this way. Sometimes, criminals hire an accomplice and give
the person a cell phone and a script to use when the phone rings.
Searching Internet databases
Are the folks in charge of the hedge fund who they say they are? One way to
find out is to do some simple Internet searches and look beyond the first
pages of results you see. Most likely, your search will turn up nothing inter-
esting, but that’s the point.
Internet databases sometimes have incorrect information, and they can be
thrown off if the person that you’re looking for has a common name or rela-
tives who share the same name. Consider any information that you find to be
a point for further questioning and research, not an automatic reason to
accept or reject the fund.
Some of the sites that show up may be products of the hedge fund manager
herself; what you want are sites that objective outsiders have prepared. Here
are some recommended database sites:
 Pretrieve (www.pretrieve.com): Offers free searches of property
records, court records, and other databases. You can see if the hedge
fund’s principals have had run-ins with regulators before. Pretrieve isn’t
as powerful as LexisNexis, but it’s a good first stop.
 LexisNexis (www.lexisnexis.com): A huge database of court records,
public records, and news stories. Law firms rely on it heavily because it
includes more information than any free service. Unlimited access is
expensive, but an a la carte service allows you to search for free and
then buy the documents you need at about $3 each.
 Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) BrokerCheck
(www.finra.org): Has an online service that lets investors check on
brokers. Many people in the securities industry hold brokers’ licenses,
not just folks holding sales jobs. Some hedge fund managers may be 
registered with FINRA now, or they may have been registered with the
National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) in earlier jobs. (The
NASD is now part of FINRA.) You can find the employment and disci-
plinary history of managers who are registered at this site.
 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (www.sec.gov): Many hedge
funds are registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC), so you can do research on the funds through the SEC Web site. You
can also search for enforcement records (www.sec.gov/divisions/
enforce.shtml) to see if a registered fund has had problems or to find
out if the fund manager ran into trouble while at another job.
467
Chapter 3: Taking the Plunge
Book VI
Hedge
Funds

 National Futures Association (www.nfa.futures.org/basicnet):
Many hedge funds are registered as commodities trading accounts,
which the Commodity Futures Trading Commission oversees. The
National Futures Association maintains a database of people and funds
registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and you
can look up information about the people and funds at this Web site.
Seeking help from service providers
Most hedge funds rely heavily on outside service organizations. As a prospec-
tive hedge fund investor, you should know who the people in these firms are
and what they do. The hedge fund manager should give you a list of the fund’s
service providers, and you should call at least a few to verify the services
provided:
 The prime broker: The brokerage firm that handles most of the securi-
ties trades that the fund makes. The prime broker may also handle
administrative services, such as taking in new investments, dispersing
any funds withdrawn, and sending out periodic statements. (A dedicated
administrative-services provider can also handle these functions.)
The folks who actually handle the fund’s cash, taking in investments 
and disbursing withdrawals, should be part of an outside organization.
Consider it a red flag if the hedge fund you’re investigating does its own
administrative work. At a minimum, separate legal subsidiaries that
have guidelines to ensure that transactions happen at arm’s length
should provide the fund’s administrative services.
 A law firm: Assists with the fund’s regulatory compliance activities.
Even an unregistered fund has laws that govern its activities.
 An accounting firm: Assists with the fund’s valuation of assets, calcula-
tion of returns, and preparation of tax forms.
 Sub-advisors: Manage certain types of assets.
 An actuary or other risk-management consultant: Helps the fund calcu-
late the risk it takes.
Purchasing Your Stake in the Fund
After a hedge fund investor and a hedge fund manager decide to work
together, the next stage in the process is the purchase. The investor (lucky
you!) and the manager have forms to fill out, and, of course, you have to
468
Book VI: Hedge Funds 

transfer some money before you can turn a large profit. This section covers
these logistics.
Fulfilling basic paperwork requirements
The U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Informant Network (www.
fincen.gov), which investigates money laundering, requires financial institu-
tions to have enforcement procedures in place to verify that new investments
aren’t made from ill-gotten funds. Hence, the hedge fund’s staff must verify
that they know who the investors in the fund are and where their money came
from. You have to provide the following when you open a hedge fund account:
 Name
 Date of birth
 Street address
 Place of business
 Social Security number or taxpayer identification number
 Copies of financial statements from banks, brokerages, and other
accounts showing that you’re accredited and that you have enough
money to meet the initial investment
If you want to open an individual account, you should also be prepared to
provide your driver’s license and passport. If you want to open an institu-
tional account, you have to provide certified articles of incorporation, a gov-
ernment-issued business license, or a trust instrument.
Filling out tax forms
You also have forms to fill out for tax reporting down the road. IRS Form W9,
for example, keeps your taxpayer information on record.
Each year, you’ll receive a K-1 form from the fund, which reports your share
of the hedge fund’s profits. (The hedge fund itself files Form 1065 with the
IRS.) As a partner, you need to report your share of the fund’s earnings to 
the IRS, even if you haven’t received any cash. This is a different reporting
structure from most other forms of investment income, which are usually
reported on 1099 forms and handled through Schedule B and Schedule D of
IRS Form 1040.
The fund itself doesn’t pay the taxes — you do. For more on your tax obliga-
tions, see the later section “Your Tax Responsibilities.”
469
Chapter 3: Taking the Plunge
Book VI

Signing the partnership agreement
When you enter into a hedge fund, the fund manager presents you with a con-
tract drawn up by the fund’s law firm. This contract specifies contractual
obligations that both parties — the investor who purchases as the limited
partner and the hedge fund’s general partners — have to meet. The contract
will be more or less standard, but it will be written to favor the general part-
ners’ interests. (Note: The fund manager may refer to the contract as a part-
nership agreement, a subscription agreement, or a private-placement
memorandum. Its legal status as a contract is the same no matter the docu-
ment’s title.)
Some contracts can be so sided to the managers that they’ll be open to doing
anything the managers want with the money, investment-wise. I strongly advise
you to have a lawyer with you when going over the contract. A lawyer may be
able to negotiate changes on different provisions, like withdrawal procedures
or disclosure levels, to get them working in your favor.
Addressing typical contract provisions
The hedge fund contract sets forth many pieces of information you need 
to know:
 The fund’s general partners
 The fund’s status with regulators
 The fees that the fund charges and how it calculates them
 The fund’s limits on withdrawals
The contract may also discuss the fund’s investment strategies, the assets
that the fund will and won’t invest in, and reporting requirements, but it
doesn’t have to.
A partnership agreement also sets forth how the fund will handle any con-
flicts. Most likely, limited partners give up the right to sue; you have to take
disputes to arbitration, which is the norm in the investment business. The
agreement you sign should discuss who will oversee the arbitration and
where it will take place, should a hearing become necessary.
By signing the document, you agree to the terms and certify that you’re an
accredited investor (see Chapter 1).
Finding room for negotiation
When you get the contract — either in person, electronically, or in the mail —
your first impulse will be to mark every clause you don’t like and then go to
470
Book VI: Hedge Funds 

the fund’s general partners and ask for changes. In most cases, you’ll get
rebuffed. Hedge funds are popular investments, and many people want to
hop on the bandwagon. Good fund managers can — and do — set their 
own terms.
But keep this in mind: If the fund you’re interested in is small, if the manager
is relatively new, and if you have plenty of money to commit, you may have
some leverage. You may be able to ask for sales-fee reductions, fewer with-
drawal restrictions, or other changes that meet your needs. In hedge funds,
as in life, it never hurts to ask.
Putting up your money
After you sign all the forms and do all the hand-shaking (not the fraternity
kind, probably), you deposit your cash. The money you put up goes to the
fund’s prime broker, which holds it in escrow until the fund is ready to add
new money. To minimize the cash-flow effects on investment returns, the
fund may add money only once a month, once a quarter, or once a year.
If you already have an account for your other investments at the same firm as
the fund’s prime brokerage, you’ll have an easy transfer. If your money comes
from a bank or another brokerage firm, you may be required to obtain signa-
ture guarantees before you can transfer the funds. The brokerage or bank will
probably send the money electronically, although you may be required to
send a certified or cashier’s check. (In the United States, most brokerage and
bank functions are separated. In other parts of the world, the same institu-
tion may handle both services.)
Handling Liquidity after 
the Initial Investment
Choosing and entering a fund is a big, tough process, but your work doesn’t
stop after you hand over your investment and ride out the minimum lockup
period. Your hedge fund will (we hope) generate money for your investment,
giving you additional investment opportunities. The fund may allow you to
withdraw funds so you can meet other objectives (but it comes with a price).
The fund may also start sending you checks to reduce its burden, or it may
decide to disband altogether. The following sections discuss factors that can
affect your investment objectives after you enter into a hedge fund.

Considering opportunities for 
additional investments
After you meet the strict requirements to get into a hedge fund, find the right
fund for your investment objectives, and go through initiation (just kidding),
you can begin to enjoy the perks of the fund: additional investment opportu-
nities, like these:
 Your hedge fund manager may look to raise more money in order to
pursue interesting investment strategies that he sees in the market. His
initial inquiries will likely be with his current investors.
 You come into money that you want to add to the fund and let your fund
manager know. He may not need the money now, but he may want it in
the near future.
 Even if the fund doesn’t want to take on more money, the manager may
allow you to buy shares from another investor — another good way to
make additional investments after you enter a fund.
From the fund manager’s perspective, cash in the fund is a problem unless he
can invest it to meet the risk-and-return profile that investors expect. Your
fund manager plans to reinvest the returns from the hedge fund. Every time
the fund manager receives an interest payment or sells an investment at a
profit, you make money that goes into the fund. Your underlying investment
increases as long as the fund has a positive return.
Knowing when (and how) 
to withdraw funds
At some point, you may need to pull out money from your hedge fund. A
hedge fund’s offering documents should set out how often you can make
withdrawals and how you should request a withdrawal. Instead of the rapid
redemption services that mutual funds, brokerage firms, or bank accounts
offer, you’ll probably have to send written notice to a hedge fund manager in
advance of your withdrawal. The manager may lay out very specific terms for
how you should send the request (for example, certified postal mail) if you
want to get your money. The turnaround time between when the manager
receives the request and when he approves the withdrawal may be a month;
the hedge fund’s partnership agreement probably specifies the time period.
The fund manager has some options when it comes to raising your with-
drawal funds. She can
472
Book VI: Hedge Funds 

 Meet your request with cash on hand.
 Sell off some assets to raise the cash.
 Sell your shares to another investor.
You’ll receive the proceeds from the bank or prime broker that handles the
fund’s investments.
You won’t find a standard withdrawal policy in the hedge fund industry. A
hedge fund manager may even negotiate different policies for different
investors in the fund. You need to know your needs before you invest in a
hedge fund so that you know what policies will match your portfolio require-
ments. (Refer to Chapter 2 for help determining what your financial needs
and expectations are.)
A hedge fund manager may not want to sell investments just to meet your
withdrawal request because it may screw up a carefully crafted investment
position or require her to sell an asset at a near-term loss. Also, some fund
investments are illiquid, meaning that they’re difficult to sell on demand. As a
result, a fund manager may view your withdrawal as something that will hurt
the fund’s remaining investors. To offset the hurt, some hedge funds impose
withdrawal fees, especially if investors want to pull out more than a small
amount.
Your fund manager may also hold back some of your money until the fund’s
accountants have a chance to calculate the performance of the fund up to the
date of your withdrawal. It isn’t easy to calculate the value of some invest-
ments like venture capital, so the fund manager wants to wait until she knows
the value before settling up with you.
Receiving distributions
Although few hedge funds are designed as income investments, they some-
times send checks to their investors. The checks may be distributions of
income, or they may be returns of capital. The difference may appear acade-
mic on the surface, but it affects your portfolio — especially when it comes
time to pay your taxes. Which distribution is which, and why do the funds
start sending you checks like grandma on your birthday? Read on to find out!
 Income: Income is money generated from interest, dividends, rental pay-
ments, and similar sources. Hedge funds usually reinvest income into
their funds, but sometimes they pay it out to their investors. You may
receive a check to help you meet your tax obligations, or your fund may
send it to manage the size of its investable assets.
473
Chapter 3: Taking the Plunge
Book VI
Hedge
Funds

 Returns of capital: Capital gains are profits made when an investment
goes up in price. These gains are paper gains when the fund still holds the
asset that goes up in price, and realized gains when the fund sells the asset,
locking in the profit in the process. Realized gains are taxable, but paper
gains are not. In most cases, hedge funds want to reinvest their capital
gains into new investments. However, your hedge fund may send you a
check for your capital gains, reducing the amount of principal in the fund.
You may think that income and capital gains are the same thing, but they
aren’t. The government taxes them at different rates, and people handle them
differently for accounting purposes. In most cases, capital gains are taxed at
lower rates than income, which is enough of a reason to keep them sepa-
rated. See the section “Your Tax Responsibilities” for more information.
Managers of top-performing funds have been known to kick investors out.
(The offering documents that you sign when you enter the fund explain if and
when the fund manager can do this.) The policy may screw up your portfolio,
and all the paper gains will suddenly fall into the realized (taxable) category.
Moving on after disbandment
For many reasons — mostly related to poor performance — a fund manager
may decide to disband the fund and return the money to investors.
Hennessee Group (www.hennesseegroup.com), an investment consulting
firm that tracks hedge funds, reports that 5.1 percent of the hedge funds in its
database shut their doors in 2006. In 2005, 5.4 percent of hedge funds tracked
by Hennessee closed.
When your fund disbands because of poor performance, you’re happy to get
your money back. But poor performance isn’t the only culprit. A fund may
have a new manager who realizes that it can be hard to raise enough money
and earn enough of a return to make the venture worthwhile. However, there
are two main problems with fund abandonment:
 Poor performance may be a temporary blip. A given investment strat-
egy may be having an off year, which actually presents a good opportu-
nity to buy assets cheap in order to take advantage of better performance
in the near future. If the fund closes, its investors lose the opportunity to
buy low in order to sell high. This is one reason that funds like having as
long a lockup period as possible.
 It may not be easy for a fund investor to find a new investment that
meets his or her risk-and-return needs. The likelihood of you finding
another suitable investment is called reinvestment risk. Based on
Hennessee Group’s 2006 numbers, your chances may be running at
about 5 percent or so that your fund will disband and you will have to
find a new place to invest your money.
474
Book VI: Hedge Funds 

If disbandment looks like a possibility for your fund, you really can’t do any-
thing except start looking for new places to put your money. Disbandment is
one of the risks you take when you invest in hedge funds.
Reading the Hedge Fund Reports
Hedge funds are like undercover cops: They don’t like to talk about what they
do. You can attribute their preference for mystery to a few reasons: They’re
organized as private partnerships; they may not be registered with the Secu-
rities and Exchange Commission; and they may have figured out proprietary
strategies to take advantage of market inefficiencies. If they tell the world
what they’re doing, they risk losing their money-making secrets.
However, you have legitimate reasons to know what’s happening in the fund.
Not only are you putting your money at risk, but also you may need to report
to others or certify that you’ve met your fiduciary responsibilities if you work
with an endowment or charitable organization, for example. If you have fidu-
ciary responsibilities, transparency — or the lack of it — may affect your abil-
ity to do your job.
This section discusses position transparency, risk transparency, and 
window dressing and how they affect fiduciary responsibility — a considera-
tion when choosing whether to invest in hedge funds or which hedge funds
to invest in.
Reports of a hedge fund’s holdings should come from a prime brokerage 
firm (a firm that handles the hedge fund’s trading account), and a bona-fide
accounting firm should audit the reports. One recent hedge fund investiga-
tion found that a fund’s shareholders hadn’t received a report for two years,
and when they finally saw a partial report of holdings, it was a statement
from a discount brokerage firm — a fine company, but not one that handles
prime brokerage services for hedge funds. If you find out that a hedge fund
doesn’t have an audited financial statement and doesn’t work through a
prime broker, you shouldn’t invest in it.
Appraising positions
When a hedge fund releases a list of the investments it owns, it has position
transparency. You can look at the list to see what stocks sit in the account,
what bonds the fund holds, what currencies it’s exposed to, and other infor-
mation. You can combine this information with any other holdings you have
to ensure that the fund is meeting your overall investment risk-and-return
objectives. Position transparency can also show whether the fund is comply-
ing with any unique requirements that you may have.
475
Chapter 3: Taking the Plunge
Book VI
Hedge
Funds

Many hedge funds give position information to investors who need it to fulfill
their fiduciary responsibilities; however, the funds may make the recipients
sign confidentiality agreements. The agreement ensures that a pension fund’s
trustees have enough information to see that the hedge fund is behaving as a
prudent expert and in line with the pension’s investment objectives, but it
prevents the trustees from giving copies of the fund’s investments to employ-
ees covered by the pension plan. A hedge fund manager knows if an investor
has fiduciary responsibilities because the investor has to tell the manager
before making the investment.
Interpreting risk
By using tactics such as leverage (or borrowing) and agreements such as
derivatives (contracts based on the value of an underlying asset), a hedge
fund may present a different risk level than its holdings list indicates. The
risk may be more or less than the investor realizes.
The bad news is that you don’t have an easy way to measure the amount of
risk in a hedge fund. You can blame it on the fact that risk isn’t well defined in
finance, despite Nobel Prizes going to men who have done years of research
on the subject.
Although some hedge fund managers simply refuse to give investors informa-
tion on risk, saying that the information is proprietary, most try to give their
investors some information they can use. A common measurement is value at
risk (VaR), a single number that gives the likelihood of the portfolio losing a
set amount of money over a set period (say, ten days). One problem with VaR
is that the likelihood will never be zero. Another is that the hedge fund man-
ager may give you information on VaR at a given point in time, but that
number can change rapidly as market conditions change.
Another technique that some portfolio managers use is stress testing, where
they run computer models to find out how a hedge fund’s portfolio may per-
form in different economic conditions. The results of stress testing give you
some parameters to use in determining how much risk an investment has.
Keep in mind, however, that stress testing can’t test for every possible event.
Martians could take over the earth tomorrow — why not? — and you can bet
that no one has done a stress test for that.
If you need to know the risk of the hedge fund that you’re investing in, you
should deal only with funds that give you risk information.
Avoiding window dressing
Hedge funds rarely give transparency in real time. A hedge fund won’t tell
anyone what’s happening on any particular day. Some hedge fund managers
476
Book VI: Hedge Funds 

take advantage of this position to make their portfolios look good on the days
that they must report. This tactic is known in the investing world as window
dressing.
For example, say that a hedge fund handles many government pension and
university endowment accounts. The trustees for these accounts have made
it clear that the fund can’t invest their money in Sudan, and they want to see
a list of positions every six months. One day, the hedge fund manager sees
some great opportunities in bonds that will finance an oil project in Sudan.
She ignores the accounts’ wishes and buys the bonds, and then she sells
them the day before she has to report her fund’s holdings.
A less nefarious, and far more common, form of window dressing takes place
when a hedge fund manager sells all the positions that turned out to be bad
ideas right before the reporting date.
No matter how you look at it, window dressing is a manipulation of the truth.
Avoid hedge funds that practice it.
Your Tax Responsibilities
Hedge fund investment returns come in two forms: capital gains and income.
A capital gain is the increase in value an asset experiences over time. Income
includes interest, dividends, and rent — in other words, any ongoing pay-
ments made to the investor. You may not care about the classification of your
return, as long as you make money, but you need to care that the U.S. tax
code treats these returns differently.
Different investment techniques have different tax effects. Some hedge fund
strategies make great money, but not after the fund pays taxes. If you have to
pay taxes, you need to make sure your hedge fund is managed with that
responsibility in mind.
You may have to pay taxes on your share of your hedge fund’s income and
capital gains each year, whether you take any money out of the fund or not.
And you aren’t done after the Feds get their cut; your state probably wants a
share of your profit, too, and the city or county where you live may also take
a piece of your investment profits. There are too many state considerations
to cover in this book; just make sure you look into it, for your own sake.
Making sense of capital gains taxes
A capital gain is the increase in value of an asset over time. If you buy a share
of stock at $10, hold it while the company introduces great new products and
generates tons of profits, and then sell it after the stock reaches $52, you have
477
Chapter 3: Taking the Plunge
Book VI
Hedge
Funds

a capital gain of $42. You don’t pay taxes until you sell the asset. Your basis is
the price you paid to acquire the asset, and your gain is the price you sell it
at less the basis.
Capital gains are classified as short-term or long-term, based on how long
you hold your investment. Long-term capital gains come from assets that you
hold for more than one year, and short-term capital gains come from assets
that you hold for one year or less. You can net capital gains against capital
losses. If you lose money when you sell one investment, you can deduct that
loss (up to $3,000) against a gain incurred when you sell another. If you have
more than $3,000 in losses, you can carry the extra into next year and deduct
it then. You can also net any short-term capital losses against long-term capi-
tal gains, which may reduce your liability.
The advantage of capital gains is that the government taxes them at a lower
rate than income. If you have to pay taxes, 28 percent — the maximum rate
on capital gains as of press time — is less than 35 percent — the current max-
imum rate on income. In addition, long-term capital gains are taxed at lower
rates than short-term capital gains.
Most hedge funds generate at least some returns from capital gains. Investors
in a hedge fund are expected to pay taxes on those gains each year out of
other sources of funds, because the fund manager probably won’t distribute
money to investors so they can pay the taxes. If a hedge fund gets almost all
its returns from short-term capital gains, the tax burden will be higher than
with a fund that gets almost all its returns from long-term capital gains.
Tax laws change every year. Be sure to check the IRS’s latest guidance on
investment tax issues, because this book may be out of date when you do
your taxes in the future. Don’t think that I’m going into an audit with you! The
IRS Web site, www.irs.gov, is a great source of information.
Taxing ordinary income
Many investment gains are classified as ordinary income. Income is money
that an asset generates on a regular basis — interest on a bond, dividends on
common stock, or rent from a commercial real estate stake. You report this
income on your taxes, and you pay the same rate on it that you pay on earned
income from your job. The good news? You can deduct any investment inter-
est you pay, such as interest paid in leveraging or short-selling strategies.
The government taxes dividends, payouts of company profits, at a lower rate
than other investment income because the company that issues the dividend
has already paid taxes on its profits before it issues the dividend out of what’s
left over. Many companies pay their shareholders small amounts of money
out of their profits each year. The maximum tax rate on dividend income as of
this writing is 15 percent.
478
Book VI: Hedge Funds 

A hedge fund that generates much of its return from interest income carries a
higher tax burden than one that generates return from dividend income or
from long-term capital gains.
On occasion, a hotshot trader makes an investment that generates tons of
money, only to find come April 15 that the earnings are classified as income
and the expenses are classified as capital losses. With no expenses to deduct,
the investor finds that the taxes more than offset the realized profit. How to
avoid this situation? Work with a hedge fund manager who has enough expe-
rience to understand the tax implications of different trading strategies.
Because taxes can eat into an investment return, hedge fund investors who
pay taxes should ask potential hedge fund managers about the tax implica-
tions of their funds’ investment strategies.
Exercising your right to be exempt
With all these crazy tax implications, it’s a wonder anyone invests in hedge
funds. Think about it: You could have to pay huge amounts in taxes each year
on money that the fund locks up for two years. Who would do that? A tax-
exempt or tax-deferred investor would. But doesn’t everyone pay taxes? No.
Two primary types of investors don’t pay taxes, or at least they don’t pay
them upfront:
 Qualified retirement and pension plans: A qualified plan is a pension
plan that meets certain IRS provisions. Among other things, the plan has
to benefit all employees, not just a few highly paid workers. There are
two types of qualified plans:
• Defined benefit plans: The employer agrees to pay the employee 
a set monthly amount upon retirement, based on the years that 
the employee worked and the income that he or she earned. The
defined benefit plan is a traditional pension fund, and it’s becom-
ing rare.
• Defined contribution plans: The employee sets aside some money
from each paycheck and determines where he or she wants to
invest it. The employer may match some of the employee’s contri-
bution. A familiar example is a 401(k) plan. Defined contribution
plans don’t invest in hedge funds, because no employee’s annual
contribution would be large enough to meet a hedge fund’s initial
investment requirements.
If a plan meets the qualification rules, an employer can deduct contribu-
tions made to the plan from its taxes. Investment returns on the plan
assets, along with the original principal, will be taxed as ordinary
income, but only after the money is withdrawn from the plan.
 Bona-fide charitable foundations and endowments: Nonprofit institu-
tions, such as foundations or endowments, are often supported by large
479
Chapter 3: Taking the Plunge
Book VI
Hedge
Funds

pools of money that generate annual investment income used to support
the organizations’ work:
• A foundation is set up by a wealthy individual or a company.
Charitable organizations that need money for activities send grant
applications to foundations, explaining how they plan to use the
money to support the foundations’ goals. Some very large founda-
tions eschew hedge funds because they don’t want to risk a large
return. Sounds crazy, huh? They want to give money to charities
for responsible use, but they don’t want the charities to have so
much money that they give it away to wasteful projects.
• An endowment is a pool of money that the charitable organization
controls itself. Endowments can be quite small or they can be on
the scale of Yale’s $22.5 billion or Harvard’s $34.9 billion. Larger
endowments often turn to hedge funds because they can afford to
lock up large sums of money for two years; they don’t have to
worry about taxes; and they appreciate the increased return rela-
tive to the risk taken.
Donations made to foundations and endowments are usually deductible
from income taxes. The investment income earned by the organizations
is also tax-free as long as they meet certain requirements. Foundations,
for example, must distribute 5 percent of their assets each year.
Tax-exempt investors have to meet stringent IRS requirements and possibly
other standards to retain their status. If you’re responsible for choosing any
investment options for a qualified tax-exempt investment fund, talk to a lawyer
to make sure you don’t make a mistake that could have your foundation or
endowment writing a big check come April 15. I doubt your organization will
be as charitable with your position, in that case!

edge funds are wildly different from each other. Because hedge funds
are simply lightly regulated investment partnerships — and therefore
can take advantage of more investment strategies than other highly regulated
investment vehicles, such as mutual funds — different funds are bound to
invest in different ways.
This chapter looks at how you can include hedge funds in your investment
portfolio to increase your return for a given level of risk. It also explains 
arbitrage, the primary investment strategy of many hedge funds, as well as
equity-based hedge funds and hedge funds that make money through venture
capital and loans. If you want to invest in a hedge fund, you need to know
about these various strategies so that you have a better understanding of
what a particular hedge fund may be doing. The more you know, the better
your questions — and decisions — will be.
Viewing Hedge Funds as an Asset Class
Asset classes are distinctly different from each other, with unique risk-and-
return profiles. For example, bonds are loans; the borrower makes regular
interest payments and returns the principal at the end of the loan. Changes in
interest rates and the ability of the borrower to make the payments affect the
bond price. Stocks, on the other hand, are partial shares of ownership in a
company. The company’s profits and prospects affect the price of stocks.

One of the biggest debates in the hedge fund world is whether hedge funds
represent a separate, new asset class, or whether they simply represent
another vehicle to manage the traditional asset classes of stocks, bonds, and
cash. The discussion affects the way that people make decisions about their
money, some good and some bad.
While some people don’t think that hedge funds deserve to be treated as a
separate asset class, others argue that, because hedge funds are uniquely
managed, they deserve to be thought of as unique assets — even though
they’re made up of other assets. This section takes a closer look at the argu-
ments in favor of hedge funds being in a separate asset class and explains
why such a debate is important to you as an investor.
Hedge funds as assets
The argument for hedge funds being a unique asset class is that many hedge
fund managers design their funds to post completely different risk-and-return
profiles than traditional asset classes. The big idea is that if you have an
investment that you design to return, say, 6 to 8 percent every year — year in
and year out, regardless of how interest rates fluctuate or how the economy
shifts — you have an investment that’s different from anything else out there.
Of course, not all hedge fund managers design their funds to perform differ-
ently from the financial markets. The risk-and-return tradeoff for absolute-
return funds, for example, is different from the risk-and-return tradeoff of
directional funds. While absolute-return funds seek to generate a reasonable
percentage return each year, regardless of the state of the financial markets,
and therefore rarely aim to beat the equity indexes or assume the risk neces-
sary to do so, directional funds seek to return the maximum amount possible
and, in the process, assume a lot of risk (see Chapter 1).
Why it matters
Does it matter if a hedge fund represents its own asset class or not? Yes, it
does, and here’s why: An investor should structure her investment portfolio
to reflect the risk and return that she needs. If a hedge fund appears in its
own asset class, other assets that the investor selects to offset the portfolio’s
risk-and-return characteristics need to appear in the portfolio. After all, in
some years stocks will be up, and in some years bonds will be. A diversified
portfolio has exposure to both stocks and bonds, in line with the investor’s
preferences, in order to meet the investor’s needs — regardless of how the
market performs. In fact, adding different kinds of assets to a portfolio can
reduce risk without affecting expected return.
482
Book VI: Hedge Funds 

Here’s a breakdown of what happens when a hedge fund is in its own class
and what happens when it isn’t:
 If a hedge fund is its own asset class, with its own risk-and-return profile,
it can diversify the risks of other assets in the portfolio. For this reason,
many large pension and endowment funds have been putting money into
hedge funds that feature an absolute-return style and listing them as
separate asset classes.
 If a hedge fund isn’t its own asset class, it increases the risk in the port-
folio. Investors would have to add other assets to offset that risk. For
this reason, many hedge fund investors don’t break out their invest-
ments in hedge funds; they opt to include them with their domestic
equity or international markets assets when they report their holdings.
Hedge fund managers have a ton of discretion, and they sometimes change
strategies or attempt trades in new areas. You may think you’re buying one
type of fund but end up in something different. Your hedge fund’s investment
agreement may specify limitations, but it may not. You can exit the fund if
you don’t like the new strategy, but only when the lock-up period expires 
(see Chapter 1).
Using Your Hedge Fund as an Overlay
Many investors view hedge funds as an overlay, not as a separate asset allo-
cation. In other words, an investor makes the asset allocation first and then
decides if any of the assets should be managed by a hedge fund manager or
by another type of investor.
483
Chapter 4: A Potpourri of Hedge Fund Strategies
Book VI
Hedge
Funds
Correlation
If return is a function of risk, how can adding dif-
ferent assets to your portfolio reduce risk with-
out affecting return? The answer: correlation.
Correlation shows how much two assets move
together. If they move in tandem, the assets are
perfectly correlated. If two assets aren’t per-
fectly correlated, some of the movement in one
offsets the movement in another. An investment
manager can run a computer program that ana-
lyzes the correlations of all her assets under
consideration and determines how much of an
investor’s portfolio should be in each in order to
generate the minimum-variance portfolio. This
portfolio has less risk — but not less return —
than the average risk and return of all of its
assets.

Investors have two reasons for taking the overlay approach — one good and
one not so good:
 The overlay thumbs up: To think about the portfolio’s risk and return 
as a whole, acknowledging that a hedge fund will have market exposure
no matter how much the fund manager wants to talk about pure alpha
(refer to Chapter 1). Overlay lets the investor think about how much
exposure the portfolio has to different asset risks instead of placing the
risk elsewhere.
 The overlay thumbs down: To deny an investment in a hedge fund. For
every person who wants to invest in a hedge fund, another person is
scared off. This person sees something inherently dangerous about
hedge funds. A charity may be concerned that listing hedge funds, or
even alternative investors, in its annual holdings will scare off donors. A
pension fund consultant may be concerned that worker representatives
on the trustee board will panic if they see hedge funds on the list. The
solution to this fright is to hide the hedge fund investments, which isn’t
quite honest.
Just because a portfolio listing doesn’t include hedge funds or absolute-
return strategies among its assets doesn’t mean it has no investments in them.
If you’re analyzing the investments of a large pension or endowment plan and
you don’t see hedge funds listed, chances are good that the fund included
them in another asset class. If you need to know, don’t hesitate to ask.
Buying Low, Selling High: Arbitrage
In theory, arbitrage opportunities don’t exist because markets are perfectly
efficient, right? (Arbitrage is the process of buying an asset cheap in one
market and selling it for a higher price in another.) In reality, arbitrage takes
place every single day, which forces markets into efficiency. However, the
price differences needed for arbitrage are often small and don’t last long. For
this reason, successful arbitrageurs have to be paying constant attention to
the market, and they have to be willing to act very quickly. They have no
room for indecision.
People often misuse the word “arbitrage” to describe any kind of aggressive
trading. If you hear a hedge fund manager say that his fund uses arbitrage,
ask what kind of arbitrage is involved.
Whether you buy into the idea of arbitrage depends on your feelings about
market risk: the idea that market prices reflect all known information about a
stock. Someone who believes in market efficiency would say that arbitrage is
484
Book VI: Hedge Funds 

imaginary because someone would’ve noticed a price difference between
markets already and immediately acted to close it off. People with a less rigid
view of the world would say that arbitrage exists, but the opportunities for
taking advantage of it are very few and far between. People who don’t believe
in market efficiency would say that arbitrage opportunities happen all the
time. These people believe that someone in one of the markets knows some-
thing, and if you can figure out what that person knows, you may have a solid
advantage in the marketplace.
Factoring in transaction costs
What goes into the cost of arbitrage trading? Quite a lot, actually:
 The overhead of having traders on staff, including salaries, bonuses, and
benefits.
 The cost of having the information systems in place to monitor several
markets in real time, enabling the hedge fund and a broker to execute an
arbitrage trade almost instantaneously. (The free quotes that investors
can find online through such sources as Yahoo! Finance [finance.yahoo.
com] are delayed for 15 to 20 minutes, depending on where the security
trades. Real-time quotes are expensive.)
 The commissions for brokers who execute the transaction.
Because of transaction costs associated with arbitrage, hedge funds tend to
either commit heavily to arbitrage or avoid it entirely. If you plan on investing
in a hedge fund that expects to generate most of its profits from arbitrage, be
sure to ask about these factors when you shop for a hedge fund.
Separating true arbitrage 
from risk arbitrage
True arbitrage is riskless trading. The purchase of an asset in one market and
the sale of the asset in another happen simultaneously. The fund manager
can count on profit as long as the trades go through immediately. True, risk-
less arbitrage is possible, but rare. No hedge fund that pursues only riskless
arbitrage will stay in business for long.
Here’s a classic example of true arbitrage: A hedge fund trader notices that a
stock is trading at $11.98 in New York and $11.99 in London. He buys as many
shares as possible in New York, borrowing money if necessary, and immediately
485
Chapter 4: A Potpourri of Hedge Fund Strategies
Book VI
Hedge
Funds

sells those shares in London, making a penny on each one. This type of arbi-
trage transaction has no risk, so people often describe it as “finding money
on the sidewalk.”
Most arbitrageurs practice risk arbitrage, which, like true arbitrage, seeks to
generate profits from price discrepancies; however, risk arbitrage involves
taking some risk (go figure!). Risk arbitrage still involves buying one security
and selling another, but an investor doesn’t always buy the same security,
and he doesn’t necessarily buy and sell at the same time. For example, a fund
manager may buy the stock of an acquisition target and sell the stock of an
acquirer, waiting until the acquisition finalizes before closing the transaction,
making (he hopes) a tidy profit in the process.
In many cases, the risk taken is that of time. The trade may work out but not
as soon as the hedge fund manager hopes. In the meantime, his portfolio’s
performance may suffer or loans taken to acquire the position may be called
in. It’s one thing to be right; however, it’s another thing entirely to be right in
time for the decision to matter.
Cracking open the arbitrageur’s toolbox
Opportunities for riskless trading are very few and far between. Therefore, to
find risky arbitrage opportunities, hedge funds look at similar securities, and
they look for ways to profit from price discrepancies while offsetting much of
the risk. The arbitrageur’s favorite tools for offsetting risk include the following:
 Derivatives: A derivative is a financial instrument (like an option, a future,
or a swap) that derives its value from the value of another security. A stock
option, for example, is a type of derivative that gives you the right, but
not the obligation, to buy shares of the stock at a predetermined price.
Because derivatives are related to securities, they can be useful in risk
arbitrage. A fund manager may see a price discrepancy between a deriv-
ative and an underlying asset, creating a profitable trading opportunity.
With their value so closely linked to the value of other securities, deriva-
tives offer many opportunities for constructing risk arbitrage trades.
And with a wider range of low-risk arbitrage opportunities, a fund stands
a better chance of making money. The more ways a hedge fund can
structure a trade, the more arbitrage opportunities it can grab.
 Leverage: Leverage, discussed in the upcoming section “Putting the
power of leverage to use,” is the process of borrowing money to trade.
Because a hedge fund puts only a little of its own capital to work and
borrows the rest, the return on its capital is much greater than it would
be if it didn’t borrow any money. Because leverage allows a hedge fund
to magnify its returns, it’s a popular tool for arbitrage.
486
Book VI: Hedge Funds 

Leverage does have a downside, though: Along with magnifying returns,
it magnifies risk. The fund has to repay the borrowed money, no matter
how the trade works out.
 Short-selling: Short-selling gives fund managers a way to profit from a
decline in a security’s price (see the later section “Investigating Equity
Strategies”). The short-seller borrows the declining security (usually
from a broker), sells it, and then repurchases the security in the market
later in order to repay the loan. If the price falls, the profit is the differ-
ence between the price where the fund manager sold the security and
the price where she repurchased it. If the price goes up, though, that dif-
ference is the amount of the loss. Short-selling allows an arbitrageur
more freedom in choosing how to buy securities low and sell high. By
shorting an asset, the seller gives up the risk of the price going down,
which can offer both a way to exploit a price discrepancy and a way to
manage the risk of the transaction.
 Synthetic securities: A synthetic security is one created by matching one
asset with a combination of a few others that have the same profit-and-
loss profile. For example, you can think of a stock as a combination of a
put option, which has value if the stock goes down in price, and a call
option, which has value if the stock goes up in price. By designing trans-
actions that create synthetic securities, a hedge fund manager can create
more ways for an asset to be cheaper in one market than in another, thus
increasing the number of potential arbitrage opportunities. Many of the
arbitrage styles that you can read about in the following sections involve
synthetic securities.
Recognizing arbitrage types
Arbitrageurs use the tools of arbitrage in many different ways. Most arbitrage
funds pick a few strategies to follow, although some may stick to only one
and others may skip from strategy to strategy as market conditions warrant.
Most hedge funds use some forms of arbitrage, and some may use arbitrage
as their primary source of investment returns.
The following sections outline all the varieties of arbitrage transactions that a
hedge fund may use as part of its investment strategy, arranged in alphabeti-
cal order for your reading pleasure. The strategies vary in complexity and in
how often a fund can use them, but all are designed to take advantage of prof-
its from security price discrepancies.
Capital-structure arbitrage
The capital structure of a firm represents how the company is financed. 
Does it have debt? How much? Does it have stock? How many classes? Many
487
Chapter 4: A Potpourri of Hedge Fund Strategies
Book VI
Hedge
Funds

companies have only one type of stock that trades, but other company port-
folios can be quite complicated. When a company has many different securi-
ties trading, arbitrageurs look for price differences among them. After all, if
all the securities are tied to the same asset — the company’s business — they
should trade in a similar fashion. You can’t count on it, though.
Say, for example, that the MightyMug Company has common stock outstand-
ing, as well as 20-year corporate bonds at 7.5 percent interest. The stock price
stays in line with market expectations, but the company bonds fall in value
more than expected given changes in interest rates. An arbitrageur may buy
the bonds and short the stock, waiting for the price discrepancy between the
two securities to return to its normal level. That means that the bonds will
have increased in price, so he can sell them at a profit, and the stock will have
fallen in price, so he buys it back to cover the short and locks in a profit.
Convertible arbitrage
Some companies issue convertible bonds (sometimes called a convertible
debenture) or convertible preferred stock. The two types of securities are very
similar: They pay income to the shareholders (interest for convertible bonds
and dividends for convertible preferred stock), and they can be converted
into shares of common stock in the future. Convertible securities generally
trade in line with the underlying stock. After all, the securities represent
options to purchase the stock. If the convertible gets out of line, an arbitrage
opportunity presents itself.
Here’s an arbitrage example: An arbitrageur notices that a convertible bond
is selling at a lower price than it should be, given the interest rates and the
price of the company’s common stock. So, she buys the bonds and sells the
stock short. The trade cancels out the stock exposure, reducing the transac-
tion risk and leaving only the potential for profit as the bond’s price moves
back into line.
Fixed-income arbitrage
Fixed-income securities give holders a regular interest payment. Some people
like to buy them just to get a check deposited every quarter. These securities
may seem safe because the money just keeps rolling in, but they have enormous
exposure to fluctuating interest rates. Because interest rates affect so many
different securities — bonds, currencies, and derivatives, for example —
they’re a common focus for arbitrageurs. With fixed-income arbitrage, the
trader breaks out the following:
 The time value of money
 The level of risk in the economy
 The likelihood of repayment
 The inflation-rate effects on different securities
488
Book VI: Hedge Funds 

If one of the numbers is out of whack, the trader constructs and executes
trades to profit from it. If, for example, a hedge fund trader tracking interest
rates on U.S. government securities notices that one-year treasury bills are
trading at a higher yield than expected, he may decide to short the two-year
treasury notes and buy the one-year treasury bills until the price difference
falls back where it should be.
Index arbitrage
A market index is designed to represent the activity of the market. It can be
designed a few different ways, but an index is always based on the perfor-
mance of a group of securities that trade in the market. Futures contracts are
available on most indexes, for example. These are derivatives based on the
expected future value of the index. Sometimes, the value of the futures con-
tract deviates from the value of the index itself. When that happens, the arbi-
trageur steps in to make a profit.
Most indexes have many securities, so buying a load of them can be expen-
sive. The S&P 500 index has 500 stocks in it! That’s why only the largest
hedge funds are active in index arbitrage, and they use plenty of leverage out
of necessity (as well as the profit motive). Only a few funds are able to buy
enough stocks in the index to make the investment matter, and even fewer
can do it with cash on hand!
Liquidation arbitrage
Liquidation arbitrage is a bet against the breakup value of a business. An arbi-
trageur researches a company to see what it would be worth if it was sold. 
If she sees value in the company’s various components that is greater than
the current market value of the stock, she may buy shares of the company in
anticipation that someone will come along and take over the company at a
price that reflects its value.
Sometimes, liquidation arbitrageurs acquire so many shares in a company
that they can influence whether a merger takes place. When this happens, the
arbitrageurs become known as corporate raiders. You can find out more about
the role of hedge funds in corporate finance decisions in the later section
“Project finance: Replacing banks?”
Merger arbitrage
Merger arbitrage is about profiting from a company’s acquisition after a
merger has been announced. A merger announcement includes the following:
 The name of the acquiring company
 The name of the company being taken over (and no matter what PR
people say, there are no mergers of equals)
 The price of the transaction
489
Chapter 4: A Potpourri of Hedge Fund Strategies
Book VI
Hedge
Funds

 The currency (cash, stock, debt)
 The date the merger is expected to close
Any of these variables can change — the acquiring company may decide that
the deal is a bad one and walk away, for example — and all these variables
create trading opportunities, although not all are riskless.
When companies announce a big merger, traders sometimes get caught up 
in the mood of the moment and engage in garbatrage. That is, everyone gets
so excited that even businesses with no real connection to the merger become
part of the speculation. For example, if a drug company buys a shampoo
manufacturer, the shares of any and all beauty-products manufacturers may
go up. This may cause folks to pay too much money because not all the
shares will be worth their newly inflated price.
Option arbitrage
Options come in many varieties, even if they exist on the same underlying
security. They come in different types: puts (bets on the underlying security
price going down) and calls (bets on the underlying security price going up).
They have different prices, where a holder can cash the option in for the
underlying security, and different expiration dates. You can exercise some
options, known as European options, at any time between the date of issue
and the expiration date, and you can exercise others, known as American
options, only at the expiration date. Needless to say, having so many securi-
ties that are almost the same creates plenty of opportunities for a knowledge-
able arbitrageur to find profitable price discrepancies.
If, for example, a hedge fund’s options trader notices that the options
exchanges are assuming a slightly higher price for a security than in the secu-
rity’s own market, she may decide to buy the underlying security and then
buy a put and sell a call with the same strike price and expiration date. The
put–call transaction has the same payoff as shorting the security, so she has
effectively bought the security cheap in one market and sold it at a higher
price in another.
Pairs trading
Pairs trading is a form of long–short hedging (described in the upcoming sec-
tion “Long–short funds”) that looks for discrepancies among securities in a
given industry sector. If one security appears to be overvalued relative to
others, a savvy arbitrageur will short that security; the arbitrageur then buys
another security in the group that seems to be undervalued.
Scalping
Scalping is a form of arbitrage that takes advantage of small price movements
throughout the day — an especially common practice in commodities markets.
490
Book VI: Hedge Funds 

In most cases, scalpers look to take advantage of changes in a security’s
bid–ask spread, which represents the difference between the price that a
broker will buy a security for from those who want to sell it (the bid) and the
price that the broker will charge those who want to buy it (the ask — also
called the offer in some markets).
For many securities, the bid–ask spread stays fairly constant over time because
the supply and demand should balance out. If everyone has the same infor-
mation (the old market-efficiency situation), their trading levels are in bal-
ance and the broker-dealers can maintain a steady profit. Sometimes, however,
the spread will be just a little out of balance compared to normal levels. A
scalper can take advantage of that situation by buying the security, waiting
even a minute or two for the spread to change, and then selling it at a profit.
Or, the scalper can buy the security, wait a few minutes for the price to go up
a small amount, and then sell it.
The scalper has to work quickly to make many small trades. He has to have a
low commission structure in place, or else transaction costs will kill him. He
also has to be careful to get out of the market as soon as a news event comes
along that causes the security’s trading to become more volatile, because
scalping becomes a high-risk proposition when market prices are changing
quickly. This is why some folks describe scalping as “picking up nickels in
front of a steamroller.”
Scalping probably isn’t a primary strategy for any hedge fund, but the strat-
egy may give a trader profit opportunities on a slow day.
Investigating Equity Strategies
Equity-based hedge funds, hedge funds that invest in equities, start with the
same investment strategies as mutual funds, brokerage accounts, or other
types of investment portfolios that invest in equities. But they use two unique
strategies — short-selling and leveraging — to change the risk profiles of
their investments in stocks. Depending on your hedge fund’s strategy and
market expectations, it may have greater or less risk than the market, in part
because of the use of these strategies. And you can assume that most hedge
funds are using some leverage and some short-selling to reach their risk and
return objectives.
Short-selling and leveraging are fundamental to the operations of a hedge
fund. They’re widely associated with equity trading, although they can be
used with other types of securities and derivatives. In fact, almost all hedge
funds use some short-selling and leverage in order to increase return for a
given level of risk. Therefore, if you’re interested in hedge funds, you should
491
Chapter 4: A Potpourri of Hedge Fund Strategies
Book VI
Hedge
Funds

find out as much as you can about short-selling and leverage so that you
have a better understanding of what hedge funds do:
 Short-selling: Borrowing an asset (like a stock or bond), selling it, and
then buying it back to repay the loaned asset. If the asset goes down in
price, the hedge fund makes the difference between the price where it
sold the asset and the price where it repurchased the asset. Of course, if
the asset appreciates in price, the hedge fund loses money. The opposite
of short is long, so an investor who is long is an investor who owns the
asset.
If much of your portfolio sits in an S&P 500 index fund — a fund that
invests in all the securities in the S&P 500 in the same proportion as the
index in order to generate the same return — you have significant expo-
sure to the stock market, which means you have market risk. One way to
reduce that risk without giving up your expected return is to seek out
equities with a different risk profile. Short-selling gives you more places
to look.
 Leverage: Borrowing money to invest, often from brokerage firms.
Leverage increases your potential return — and your risk. Hedge funds
use leverage, but so do other types of accounts, and many individual
investors use it, too.
Investment styles of long equity managers
Long equity managers, those equity investors who don’t short stocks (and
thus are rarely hedge fund managers, although a small number of hedge fund
managers are long-only), fall into several broad categories and employ sev-
eral styles, often called style boxes. Fund managers use these categories to
guide their choices for the long portions of their portfolios (the securities
that they own, not those that they short) or to determine the risk that they
can reduce with hedging strategies. At a minimum, you want to recognize the
terms covered in this section when they come up in conversation.
Few hedge funds use the strategies in this section exclusively. Hedge fund
managers are in the business of using exotic investment techniques in order
to beat the market — and to justify their high fees.
Trying on a large cap
A large cap fund, which may be a hedge fund, a mutual fund, or another type
of investment portfolio, invests in companies with a market capitalization
(shares outstanding multiplied by current price) of $5 billion or more. These
492
Book VI: Hedge Funds 

companies tend to be multinational behemoths with steady performance and
fortunes tied to the global economy. You can find these companies in the S&P
500, the Fortune 500, and on every other 500 list, save the Indy 500.
Many large cap managers engage in a strategy called closet indexing: They
buy shares in the largest companies in the S&P 500 in more or less the same
proportion as the S&P index. The result is that the portion of the portfolio
containing the large cap shares has almost identical risk and return as the
index but for the higher fee that an active manager receives. A hedge fund
manager who does closet indexing isn’t hedging, so she isn’t doing what you
pay her to.
Fitting for a small, micro, or mid cap
A small cap stock is a share of a company with a market capitalization of
under $1 billion. These companies tend to be growing faster than the market
as a whole, and they aren’t as closely covered by investment analysts as
larger companies, so their shares may not be as expensive as those in similar
but better-known companies.
Some fund managers concentrate on investing in company stocks with a
market cap of under $100 million, believing that’s where the real money-
making opportunities lie because these stocks are even less covered than
small cap stocks, so the managers may be getting in on the ground floor. This
style of investing, known as micro cap, is similar to venture capital and
requires that the fund manager do careful research, because other investors
may be showing little interest in the company.
What’s in between $5 billion and $1 billion? Mid cap investments, which have
characteristics of both large cap and small cap stocks. Easy, huh? Some small
and mid cap companies will grow and graduate to the next level. However,
some mid cap companies used to be large cap companies before they ran
into trouble, and some small caps are former mid caps whose growing days
are over.
If a hedge fund manager mentions capitalization as a style, you should cer-
tainly ask about how the fund defines the cutoffs. Why? Because the industry
has no standard cutoff for small, mid, and large cap stocks. Different analysts
and money-management firms set their own parameters, and the parameters
tend to go up when the market goes up and come down a little bit when the
market comes down. If you come across a hedge fund manager who defines
companies with a capitalization of $2 billion as small cap stocks, she isn’t
doing anything wrong; she’s just using a cutoff that works with what she sees
in the market at that point.
493
Chapter 4: A Potpourri of Hedge Fund Strategies

Investing according to growth and GARP
A growth fund looks to buy stock in companies that are growing their revenue
and earnings faster than the market as a whole. Hedge funds expect these
equities to appreciate more than the market and to have some life to them,
making them longer-term holdings.
Growth stocks tend to be more expensive than stocks in companies that are
growing at a normal rate. For this reason, many fund managers try to find
cheap growth stocks, following a strategy called Growth At the Right Price (or
Growth At a Reasonable Price [GARP]). The fund manager attempts to com-
bine growth with low price-to-earnings ratios in order to earn a greater-than-
market return for a market rate of risk.
Swooping in on lowly equities with value investing
Value investors are the most traditional of equity investors. Hedge fund 
managers who consider themselves value investors look for stocks that are
cheap based on accounting earnings or asset values. They shoot for compa-
nies that have solid assets, plenty of cash, and inferiority complexes because
the market doesn’t recognize them. Value investors care more about what a
business would look like dead, with the assets sold and the proceeds distrib-
uted to shareholders, than what it would look like if it grew in the future. For
more on value investing, go to Book VII.
Keeping options open for special style situations
A special-situations investor doesn’t like to declare allegiance to any one
style of equity investing; he prefers to look at stocks that seem likely to
appreciate. A sharp manager may want to keep his options open, especially
at a larger firm that can afford investment analysts and traders who have
their own investment niches. Other managers may want flexibility to move
between styles whenever the current en vogue style isn’t working out. (A
cynic may say that this is why fund managers are often so secretive about
their strategies.)
Although it seems like a good idea to keep all investment options open, spe-
cial-situations investors can end up chasing ideas all over the place. With no
discipline to help them determine valuation, these investors may end up
buying high and selling low, which is a sure path to ruin. If you interview a
special-situations fund manager because you’re interested in his fund’s ability
to handle your money, ask how he makes his investing decisions.
Creating a market-neutral portfolio
With a typical, diversified equity portfolio, you can earn only the market rate
of return. Although you take on the same amount of risk as the market, that
494
Book VI: Hedge Funds 

may be more risk than you want. For these reasons, many hedge funds have 
a market-neutral strategy. You expect a market-neutral portfolio to generate a
positive return, regardless of what the market does. This doesn’t mean that a
market-neutral portfolio will generate a higher return than the market,
although it should when the market loses money.
A fund manager has to tweak a market-neutral portfolio to maintain its neu-
trality, so the manager needs a system for the tweaking process. The three
common styles of market-neutral investing are creating beta-neutral, dollar-
neutral, and sector-neutral portfolios.
Being beta-neutral
Many hedge fund managers go back to academic theory and use beta as the
neutral point when figuring out ways to make their portfolios market-neutral.
Beta is the relationship of a security to the market as a whole. Under the
Modern (Markowitz) Portfolio Theory (MPT), the market has a beta of 1, and
a stock that’s correlated with the market also has a beta of 1. A security that’s
negatively correlated with the market has a beta of –1. A beta-neutral portfolio,
therefore, is made up of securities that have a weighted average beta of 0. In
other words, the portfolio has no market exposure.
Few 0-beta securities exist in the market, because if a security is part of the
market, it almost definitely has some bit of exposure to it. The closest asset
to a 0-beta security is a short-term U.S. treasury security, which has a very
low return. Of course, a beta-neutral hedge fund has to generate a return
greater than treasuries in order to attract assets!
In order to maintain 0 beta while maximizing return, a fund manager can run
a program that comes up with optimal portfolio weighting. In some ways, a
beta-neutral portfolio is as much about programming as it is about picking
stocks, because the weightings are very difficult to calculate by hand. Finding
negative-beta stocks, on the other hand, is easy. Shorting a stock is the same
as reversing its beta, so a fund manager can generate negative-beta securities
by taking short positions in stocks with positive betas. (See the earlier sec-
tion “Investigating Equity Strategies” for an explanation of short-selling.)
Establishing dollar neutrality
In a dollar-neutral portfolio, the hedge fund manager holds the same amount
of money in short positions — that is, in securities that he borrowed and
then sold in hopes that they would go down in price so the fund could repur-
chase them at a lower price to repay the loan — as in long positions, securi-
ties that the fund owns outright. With this strategy, the portfolio’s expected
return isn’t highly exposed to the market, because the portfolio should bene-
fit no matter what direction the market moves. An investor follows this strat-
egy to eliminate market risk from a portfolio. Of course, if you want to have
market risk, this feature would be a disadvantage.
495
Chapter 4: A Potpourri of Hedge Fund Strategies
Book VI
Hedge
Funds

Staying sector-neutral
Certain industries represented in the investment indexes perform differently
than others, which can make index performance more volatile than a true
market investment should be. The people who select the stocks for the indexes
have been known to make additions and subtractions that make the indexes
perform better, even if the indexes become less representative of the market
and the economy.
To structure his or her portfolio free of political influences, generating less
risk than may be found in an index fund in the process, a hedge fund manager
can weight each industry sector equally so that Internet stocks don’t crowd
out automaker stocks, for example. This is called sector neutrality. Although it
doesn’t eliminate market risk, it does reduce it. Many hedge fund managers
combine sector neutrality with other portfolio strategies, such as arbitrage
or leverage.
Long–short funds
A long–short fund is actually a traditional hedge fund: It buys and sells stocks
according to its risk profile and market conditions. A long–short fund man-
ager looks for overvalued assets to sell and undervalued assets to buy. The
valuation may be relative to the current assets and earnings of the securities
or relative to the future prospects for the companies. Matching the two
allows for reduced risk and increased returns — the very stuff of the hedge
fund game.
Some hedge fund managers allocate parts of their portfolios to pure short-
selling. (The other part of the portfolio is long but not matched to the short
assets, so this is a type of long–short fund.) These managers want to increase
their risk (and thus their expected returns) by finding overvalued securities
in the market and then selling them short. This strategy isn’t for the faint of
heart, because the most a stock can go down is 100 percent, to 0, but the
most it can go up is infinity. That’s why most hedge fund managers view
short-selling as part of a hedged portfolio, not the centerpiece of it.
The flip side of this is a long strategy called a short squeeze, in which a hedge
fund or other portfolio manager looks for stocks that have been shorted. At
some point, all the short-sellers have to buy back the stocks to repay the
lenders. This means that someone can buy up enough of the stock to push
the prices higher, causing investors on the short side to start losing money.
As the shorts lose money, the managers can buy shares to cover the loans
and get out of the positions; their buying drives the prices even higher.
496
Book VI: Hedge Funds 

Most short-sellers do excellent research. An unscrupulous few have been
known to drive asset prices down by starting ugly rumors and spreading out-
right lies. As a result, short-selling isn’t a game for the faint of heart.
Making market calls
A traditional hedge fund — namely, a long–short hedge fund — hedges risk. A
modern, lightly regulated partnership may enlist all sorts of risky strategies
to increase return. As long as the fund doesn’t closely correlate the risk with
the other holdings in the portfolio, it can meet its goal of reducing risk. What’s
more, a strategy keyed off of market performance doesn’t require the portfo-
lio manager to determine how the market is moving. But some investors want
more. They want return tied to the market in one form only: a return that
beats the market handily.
But here’s the thing: How do you call the market? In other words, how do you
foresee the future? Anyone who can call the market consistently is retired to
a beachfront estate in Maui, not running a hedge fund. Some hedge fund man-
agers are close to affording a beach hideout, but others are still trying to beat
the market in order to get there. But how? How can a fund manager call the
market in order to figure out how to position her portfolio? Magic? Tea leaves?
Astrology? Or hardcore analysis? Maybe a little of each strategy, and it’s a
perilous enterprise.
Predicting the market is nearly impossible to do in the long run. Money man-
agers try to predict the future all the time, but almost all fail, whether they’re
running hedge funds or other investment portfolios. Don’t expect a hedge
fund you’re interested in to beat the market, and be leery of a fund manager
who claims to be a seer. Instead, think about how the hedge fund will help
you manage risk.
This section describes some of the things that hedge fund managers look for
when they make decisions about buying and selling securities.
Investing with event-driven calls
An event-driven manager looks at situations he expects to happen in the
market, guesses how the market will react, and invests accordingly. A man-
ager always has two moving pieces when making event-driven calls: predict-
ing the event and determining what the market expects the event to be. Such
an event may be an upcoming election, the death of an ailing world leader, or
a hurricane that knocks out some offshore oil drills.

Taking advantage of market timing
A hedge fund manager who times the market allocates different portions of
his portfolio to different asset classes. The exact proportion for each class
varies with different market indicators. The idea is to have plenty of money 
in assets that the fund manager expects to do well and to put less money in
assets that aren’t supposed to do as well. The difference between a market-
timing strategy and an event-driven strategy is that an event-driven manager
looks for individual securities that he expects to do well based on specific
events; the market timer looks for changes in general economic trends, such
as inflation and unemployment — often signaled by technical indicators —
which would show up on stock trading charts analyzed by using technical
analysis. (See Book VIII for more information on technical analysis.)
Market timing can be used long or short. Some long–short hedge fund man-
agers decide what portion of their portfolio they’ll invest outright and what
part they’ll short, based on their analysis of where the market will go.
Putting the power of leverage to use
Even a simple investing strategy — such as buying stocks in the S&P 500
index in the same proportion in order to replicate the index’s performance —
can take on new risk and return levels through the use of leverage. Maybe
you’ve heard the phrase “using other people’s money”; that’s what leveraging
is. An investor borrows money to make an investment, getting maximum
return for a minimal amount of cash up front. Of course, this strategy can
also lead to a maximum loss. The following sections show you how to use
leverage in an equity portfolio to maximize return. But be forewarned: It’s a
strategy that also increases your risk.
Buying on margin
The simplest way to use leverage is to borrow money from the brokerage firm
that holds the investment account — called buying securities on margin. The
Federal Reserve Board sets the amount that a hedge fund can borrow. As of
press time, the Board requires individual investors to have 50 percent of the
purchase prices on account at the time they place their margin orders; they
may borrow the rest of the money from their brokerage firms. Hedge funds
and other large investors are often allowed to borrow more.
After the leverage takes place, the margin borrower must meet ongoing margin
requirements. As the security bought on margin fluctuates in price, the 50
percent purchase-price level kept on account may fall to only 30 percent of
498
Book VI: Hedge Funds 

the money owed. In this case, the borrower gets a margin call and has to add
money to the account to get it back to the minimum maintenance level. If not,
the brokerage firm will cash out the borrowed position. The New York Stock
Exchange (NYSE) and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) set
minimum margin requirements, although many brokerage firms have the abil-
ity to set higher levels based on their risk-management requirements and
their comfort levels with the clients.
As long as a borrowed security appreciates by more than the cost of the bor-
rowing, the margin position makes money. But, because the borrowing fund
has to pay interest, margin buying is a money-losing proposition if the secu-
rity doesn’t go up.
Gaining return with other forms of borrowing
Larger hedge funds can find banks, financial institutions, and even other
hedge funds willing to lend them money that they can use to buy securities. If
you’re investing in a hedge fund, you should expect that the fund has more
sources of funds than just margin accounts.
Private banks often loan hedge fund investors money to get into a fund or a
fund of funds. In this case, the investor’s personal wealth is leveraged over
and above whatever leverage the fund has. The same risks apply: If the
investment goes up, the loan leads to a greater rate of return, but if the
investment heads south, the investor still has to repay the loan.
Participating in Corporate Life Cycles
Given the inherent flexibility and current popularity of hedge funds, it’s no
surprise that they’re taking on a big role in corporate transactions — ranging
from venture capital and project finance to takeovers. What this means for
you, a prospective investor, is that the hedge fund you’re interested in may
be taking roles in corporate transactions. The following sections describe
these transactions so you’ll understand what a hedge fund that follows this
type of strategy is doing with your money.
The many stages of the corporate life cycle give hedge funds plenty of 
opportunities to make money. Some funds concentrate on corporate finance
transactions, and others view that strategy as one of many ways to make
money. Hedge funds aren’t mutual funds. No one type of fund is suitable 
for all investors, and no one type of investor is suitable for any given type 
of fund.

Venture capital: Helping businesses 
break to the next level
Venture capital, sometimes known as private equity, is money given to entre-
preneurs to fund new companies — money that comes with strings attached.
An investor who gives the money wants to ensure that the business succeeds.
It isn’t uncommon, for example, for venture capitalists to make their invest-
ments on the condition that the founders leave their companies so seasoned
managers can replace them. Hedge funds often invest in venture capital.
Although their styles may seem pushy, venture investments can help a com-
pany grow faster than it could otherwise, and investors can bring expertise —
and potential clients — to the start-ups. Some of the United States’s biggest
technology companies, like Intel, Oracle, Apple, and Google, were started
with venture capital. The payoff to those investors (and investors in those
investors) was huge, which is the attraction of the investment.
Venture investors count on acquiring some companies that will fail in their
portfolios, offset by the few companies that hit it big.
Venture capital comes in different forms. Investors from a hedge fund may
give the money to a young company as equity, making the hedge fund one of
the owners of the company. The capital can also be debt that converts into
equity if the company goes public or sells out to a larger company. The struc-
ture depends on the start-up company’s business and state of profitability.
Venture-capital investors need a liquidity event to make money. This event
occurs when a company is sold to a larger one or when it issues stock
through an initial public offering, or IPO. Until that event happens, the ven-
ture investor won’t make much money.
Following are the most common forms of venture capital that you’re likely 
to encounter when scoping out hedge funds (including private equity, which
deals with established companies, making it not quite venture capital, but
close):
 Late-stage venture: After a new company gets over the initial hurdles of
setting up the business and attracting customers, it becomes a lot more
interesting to investors, who see a little less risk with some huge upside.
The company still needs more money to grow, and it still isn’t ready to
go public or to be acquired.
 Mezzanine capital: When a young company needs just enough financing
to move it to the stage where it can go public or be an attractive acquisi-
tion, it needs mezzanine financing. Mezzanine capital is the least risky
500
Book VI: Hedge Funds 

stage of venture capital (although it’s still riskier than investing in a
public company) because a company’s management has proved that the
business is viable. Returns are likely to be higher with a company at this
stage than with public companies, though, so this stage of venture
investing is interesting to hedge funds.
 Private equity: Many established companies choose not to be publicly
traded; other companies are publicly traded but can’t raise money effi-
ciently through a public offering. These companies turn to private equity
deals, often with hedge funds on the other side. These transactions
carry lower potential returns than venture capital because they carry
less risk (the company is established), but they often carry higher
returns than shares of common stock in similar companies because it’s
harder to sell private equity.
 Seed capital: Money used to take an idea and turn it into a business is
called seed capital. Few hedge funds provide seed capital because they
prefer to wait to see if a company has a chance of surviving.
Project finance: Replacing banks?
Hedge funds may have money to lend, or they may need money to invest. When
it comes to short-term transactions — sometimes as short as overnight —
hedge funds often replace banks in the role of taking deposits and lending
money.
Borrowing money
Hedge fund managers are always looking to make the largest possible amount
of money at the lowest possible rate. They borrow from other hedge funds,
from banks, from brokerage firms, and sometimes from large corporations.
Many corporations have money sitting around that they won’t need for a few
days. A company’s executives want to get the maximum possible return on
their funds, so they lend the money out, often only overnight. But for the
hedge fund on the other side of the transaction, overnight may be exactly
enough time to take advantage of a profitable price discrepancy between two
securities. Because it’s unlikely (but not out of the question) that the bor-
rower will go out of business in such a short period, this type of transaction
carries very little risk.
Most hedge funds use leverage to increase their potential return, which
means that they borrow money to buy securities, increasing the amount of
money that they can make relative to the amount of money actually in the
funds.
501
Chapter 4: A Potpourri of Hedge Fund Strategies
Book VI
Hedge
Funds

Lending
One way a hedge fund manager tries to generate a high rate of return relative
to a given level of risk is to keep the fund’s holdings earning returns at all
times. Therefore, if he sees money in one account that isn’t being used for
one of the fund’s investments, he may decide to loan it out, even for a short
period, to get some amount of return. Hedge funds receive interest when they
loan out money; of course, the funds take on the risk that the borrowers
won’t repay the money.
Some hedge fund managers are willing to loan out money for longer periods
of time — even a few years — to corporations or governments that need
money. They can do this by buying bonds (as can any investor, because
bonds are simply tradable loans), or they can make loans through private
transactions. They can create all kinds of risk and return combinations by
lending money, depending on the funds’ goals and the market opportunities.
Gaining return from company 
mergers and acquisitions
Hedge funds are often players in mergers (combinations of equal companies)
and acquisitions (when larger companies purchase smaller companies) by
providing funding and speculating on the outcomes. Here, I outline certain
situations funds look for and the strategies they use to increase return and
put money in your pocket:
 Leveraged (management) buyouts: Sometimes, members of a com-
pany’s management group, having grown fed up with shareholders and
the hassles of having publicly traded shares, believe they could make
more money if they ran the company themselves, so they decide to raise
the money to take over. Because it involves heavy borrowing, this type
of transaction is called a leveraged buyout (LBO) in the United States.
Because the management group is doing the buying, the transaction is
called a management buyout (MBO) in Europe. Many hedge funds invest
in LBO debt because it tends to be riskier than most corporate debt. The
risk comes from the management group’s decision to borrow most or all
of the money needed for the acquisition.
 Buyout funds: Buyout funds are investment pools formed by hedge fund
managers and other private investors for the express purpose of fund-
ing leveraged buyouts and business expansions. Like venture capital
funds, buyout funds tend to go in and out of fashion, and funds often see
502
Book VI: Hedge Funds 

mismatches between the amount of money raised to invest in buyouts
and the need for buyout capital. It’s unlikely that you’ll come across a
hedge fund dedicated solely to buyouts; instead, it will be one of many
strategies that a hedge fund manager may use.
 Bridge lending: Hedge funds that want to loan money may work with
companies that are looking to acquire other companies and, at least in
the short run, need some financing to acquire shares in the market or
otherwise support a bid for another company. A loan from a hedge fund
in this situation is called a bridge loan or bridge financing. Bridge loans
usually have terms of less than one year and carry higher interest rates
than other forms of short-term financing.
 Merger arbitrage: Merger arbitrage is a low-risk trading strategy
designed to profit after a corporate merger or acquisition is announced.
In general, the shares of the company about to be acquired trade at a
discount to the offer price because you take on some risk that the deal
won’t go through. A hedge fund trader buys the stock of the target com-
pany and sells the stock of the acquirer, waiting until the deal is
announced for the gap to close at a nice profit.
Investing in troubled and dying companies
Insiders often use a slang term for investment pools that seek out troubled
businesses and troubled countries: vulture funds. In some ways, vulture funds
are the opposite of venture capital funds: The venture funds profit as compa-
nies get going, and vulture funds are there to profit at the end of the corpo-
rate life cycle. If a fund’s traders see that a nation’s currency has weakened or
that some bonds are in risk of default, they swoop in, buy as much as they
can, and use their positions as negotiating leverage to get a profit for the
fund. Fund traders may also take large positions in the equity and debt of a
troubled company and then force management to sell off divisions and other
assets. Several investment strategies prey on troubled businesses, including
hostile takeovers and liquidation arbitrage:
 Hostile takeovers: A hostile takeover occurs when a company or an
investment group acquires enough common stock in a company to get
control of its board of directors. In some cases, the company or invest-
ment group believes that it can operate the business more profitably. In
other cases, the acquirer simply wants to sell off the company’s assets
at a profit. A hedge fund may offer financing to another takeover group,
or it can buy enough stock to be a part of one. Both strategies can be
profitable.
503
Chapter 4: A Potpourri of Hedge Fund Strategies
Book VI
Hedge
Funds

 Liquidation arbitrage: Liquidation arbitrage is an investment technique
that looks to profit from the breakup of a firm. An investor does careful
research to determine exactly how a company’s market value differs
from the value of the sum of its parts. If the investment fund, often a
hedge fund, finds an opportunity where the actual value of the company
looks very different from the market value, the fund can acquire enough
shares to force management to break the company up or at least sell off
some of the assets at a gain for shareholders.

C
alculating investment performance seems easy: You take your balance 
at the end of the year, divide it by your balance at the start of the year,
subtract 1, and voila! For example, $1,100,000 ÷ $1,000,000 – 1 = 10 percent.
But what if you add to your investment in the middle of the year in order to
net a bigger return? What if your hedge fund manager had to cash out other
shareholders? Quickly, you’re left with algebra unlike any you’ve seen since
high school. Because of all the possible complications, many researchers in
the investment industry are trying to standardize calculations, and others are
asking pointed questions to make solid comparisons.
This chapter looks at how a hedge fund measures and evaluates its performance,
as well as what questions you need to ask your prospective fund partners
about performance calculation. Evaluating a hedge fund’s performance helps
you determine if the fund is the right fit for your investment objectives. It
also tells you if the hedge fund manager is doing well relative to the risk
taken, which is why you invest in the fund in the first place.
Measuring a Hedge Fund’s 
Risk and Return
In general, less risk is preferable to more, and more return is preferable to less.
Some people invest in hedge funds to reduce risk, preferring nondirectional or
absolute-return funds (see Chapter 1); other investors aim to increase return

regardless of risk by investing in directional funds. These funds maintain
exposure to the market rate of return, and you have no guarantee that the
direction of the return will be up.
The following sections give you the methods used to measure return and risk
within a hedge fund, presenting the different forms of return, factoring in
fees, and explaining how risk factors into performance.
Unlike mutual funds, hedge funds don’t have to publish their performance
numbers. And even if they do, they don’t have to follow a set methodology.
You have to ask questions about the numbers that you see.
Reviewing the return
Return is an estimate that investors can manipulate. It’s a measure of past
performance, not a predictor of future results. It doesn’t matter what a hedge
fund did last year; this year is an entirely different ballgame. Whether you’re
a current or a prospective investor, past return numbers are only rough
indicators of what you can expect. That doesn’t mean, however, that return
figures are worthless. If you’re already in a fund, return measures tell you how
you did over a time period, which is important information. You may get a
different return when you cash out of the fund, but the fund manager still
posted a set of investment gains or losses over a specific time period. You 
can compare that number to your expectations and your needs.
What muddies the picture is that a hedge fund manager may have been lucky
or unlucky, or he may have an investment style that does very well in some
market conditions and not so well in others. That’s why return is only one
piece in the evaluation of a portfolio’s performance.
Calculating your return
The following list gives you the steps taken to calculate investment return:
1. Valuing the assets. A hedge fund has to know what it holds and what its
holdings are worth. The best method is to use market value — what the
security would sell for on the market today — but some funds use their
initial costs instead (especially for assets, like real estate, that don’t
trade easily). Sometimes, a hedge fund will estimate the value of an illiq-
uid asset. The estimate may be close to reality, or the fund may use it to
make itself look good.
Many securities pay off some income. Almost all bonds make regular
interest payments. Funds should value bonds that pay income with an
accrual for any upcoming payments.
506
Book VI: Hedge Funds 

2. Choosing the dates. On a regular calendar, a year has 12 months and 
365 days (usually), and it ends on December 31. In an accounting calen-
dar, a year may be 360 days long, and a month could end not on the last
day of the month but on the last business day or the last Friday. As long
as the hedge fund manager discloses the beginning and ending dates
and applies the method consistently, it doesn’t matter how she sets the
fund’s time periods.
When you’re doing comparisons, make sure that you compare numbers
for the same time periods. A shady fund manager may change the
ending date for a quarter in order to avoid a big market decline on the
last calendar day, for example.
3. Picking a calculation methodology. Give someone with a numerical bent a
list of numbers and a calculator and she can come up with several different
relationships between numbers. After investors determine the asset values
for certain time periods, they can calculate rates of return. But how? And
over how long a time period? Even though the fund may hand over the
work to accountants or even actuaries, you should still understand the dif-
ferences in the methods. Following are the different calculation methods:
• Time-weighted returns: The most common way to calculate
investment returns — also called the compound average growth
rate (CAGR). For one time period, the calculation produces a
simple percentage:
EOY stands for “end of year asset value,” and BOY is “beginning of
year value.” The result is the percentage return for one year.
Simple arithmetic!
If you want to look at your return over a period of several years, you
need this equation, which looks at the compound return rather than the
simple return for each year:
EOP stands for “end of the total time period,” BOP stands for
“beginning of the total time period,” and N is the number of years
that you’re looking at.
• Dollar-weighted returns, also called the internal rate of return
(IRR): The rate that makes the net present value of a stream of
numbers equal to zero. You find the number through an iteration
that almost always has to be done on a calculator or a computer.
You use the IRR to determine the return for a stream of numbers
over time; it’s also widely used to value bonds.

Because of the problems with dollar-weighted returns, most people who ana-
lyze investment returns prefer to use a time-weighted, compound average
approach. It isn’t as flashy — you can do it with the same cheap scientific cal-
culator you used in high school chemistry — but it gives you a more precise
way to figure out how a fund performs over a range of market cycles.
Calculating fees
One big nuance with return calculations is whether or not you include fees.
And fees can be hefty: A typical hedge fund charges a 1- or 2-percent manage-
ment fee and takes a 20-percent cut of profits (see Chapter 1). Other funds
take much more. Here are two terms to know:
 Gross of fees: If a fund manager reports returns gross of fees, that means
he hasn’t taken out most of the fees. Trading costs should be removed
because those commissions and fees are necessary to building the port-
folio. However, the manager shouldn’t remove the investment manage-
ment fees and cuts of profits. Trading costs should be relatively small,
but they can be high if the fund makes many small, frequent trades or if
it uses unusual strategies that carry high commissions.
One reason to report numbers gross of fees is that different investors
may be paying different fees. A hedge fund may agree to reduce the
profit fee charged to a fund of funds (which invests in several different
hedge funds) or a single large investor in exchange for its investment.
So, although most investors may have an arrangement for a 2-percent
management fee and a 20-percent share of profits, some may be paying
only “1 and 18.”
 Net of fees: In a net-of-fees performance calculation, you remove all the
fees charged by the fund. This method may not reflect the return that
any one investor receives, because different investors may have differ-
ent fee schedules. Anyone evaluating a net-of-fee rate of return has to
ask if different investors pay different fees, because any one investor’s
realized returns may be higher or lower.
Sizing up the risk
An investor must consider return relative to what a manager had to do to get
it, which is why you have to compare return to the amount of risk taken. The
problem is that measurements of risk are inherently subjective. What’s risky
to one investor may not be risky to you. In finance, the dispute over how to
define risk has led to a range of measures. The following sections present
what goes into each measurement so that you can judge for yourself how
appropriate each method is for your needs.
508
Book VI: Hedge Funds 

Standard deviation
In finance, risk is usually considered to be a function of standard deviation —
a statistic that shows how much your return may vary from the return that
you expect to get. Say, for example, that you expect a security to have an
average return of 10 percent over two years. If it returns 10 percent the first
year and 10 percent the second year, no deviation exists between any one
return and the average return. But if the security returns 20 percent one
period and 0 percent the next, it still returns an average of 10 percent but
with big deviations from the 10-percent mean. The more a security swings
around the expected return, the riskier it is.
Some hedge funds are designed to have low standard deviations. Funds of
this structure are absolute-return funds, which aim to post returns within a
narrow range (often 6 to 8 percent). Directional funds, on the other hand, try
to maximize returns, so they sometimes take on very high levels of risk, cre-
ating a high expected standard deviation (see Chapter 1 for more). When
looking for a prospective fund, you can compare how much the return varies
from year to year to give you a ballpark idea of how risky it is.
Beta
A refinement of the standard deviation measurement is beta, which compares
the standard deviation of an investable asset or fund to the standard devia-
tion of the market itself. In most cases, the performance of an index measures
the “market” (in the sense that the index is a sample of investable assets, not
an agglomeration of all the possible assets that you can invest in), like the
S&P 500 in the United States or the Nikkei in Japan.
If a fund has a beta of 1, it should move right in step with the market itself. If
it has a beta greater than 1, it should move more sharply up or more sharply
down — whichever way the market goes. If it has a beta of less than 1, it
should move in the same direction as the market, but less sharply. If the beta
is negative, it should move in the opposite direction of the market.
Peak-to-trough ranges
A simple way to look at the volatility of a long-standing hedge fund is to com-
pare the distance between the peak — the year with the highest return —
and the trough — the year with the lowest return. The greater the distance
between the peak and the trough, and the closer together the two are, the
riskier the fund is. For example, if a fund’s peak return was 80 percent, fol-
lowed by a loss of 35 percent the next year, the peak-to-trough distance is 115
percent (80 – (–35)) over two years. If another fund had a peak return of 15
percent, followed by a return of 10 percent the next year, its peak-to-trough
distance is 5 percent (15 – 10) over two years. The first fund is much riskier
than the second fund.
509
Chapter 5: Evaluating Hedge Fund Performance
Book VI
Hedge
Funds

For a hedge fund with a short operating history, you can look at the peak and
trough months rather than years.
Stress tests
Standard deviation and beta are nice shortcuts, but they don’t answer one
question that may be on a worrisome investor’s mind: How much money will
I lose if things go terribly wrong? A stress test solves this problem. The test is
a computer simulation that models what could happen to a hedge fund’s
portfolio under a variety of different scenarios, like a dramatic increase in
interest rates, the Euro falling apart, or the government of Mexico defaulting
on its bonds. Based on the sensitivity that the different fund investments
have to the tested factors, the stress test shows how much the factors may
affect the portfolio’s return. The less effect the events have, the less risky the
fund — assuming that the right stresses have been tested.
Stress tests are expensive to run, and even the best are based on guesses
about the future. Still, the information from a test can be useful, especially 
for a fund that intends to retain exposure to a certain set of market factors. For
example, a macro hedge fund that concentrates on emerging Asian-Pacific
markets could undergo a test for exposure to those currencies and interest rates.
Value at risk
Value at risk (VAR) is a single number that represents how much you can
expect a portfolio to lose over a given time period. The value is a statistical
calculation involving several equations, so it is very difficult to calculate by
hand, and in most cases, you will have to rely on the hedge fund for VAR
information. You see it quoted with similar margins of error that you see with
political polls.
For example, a hedge fund may say that it has a 95 percent confidence level
that its portfolio has a 10-day VAR of losing $10 million. This translates to the
following: Based on the securities held in the portfolio and on market conditions,
the fund manager is 95 percent certain that the most the fund could lose over
the next 10 days is $10 million. Events could take place over the next ten days
that fall into the 5 percent uncertainty level, but more likely than not, the
most the fund will lose is $10 million.
Benchmarks for Evaluating 
a Fund’s Risk and Return
Investment performance is relative — relative to your needs and expecta-
tions and relative to what your return would’ve been had you invested your
money elsewhere. That’s why you have to compare your return and risk num-
bers to something. But what? In many cases, hedge fund investors compare
510
Book VI: Hedge Funds 

performance to a market index. Some compare performance to that of similar
hedge funds or to an expected return based on the fund’s style. All these
types of comparisons have their advantages and disadvantages.
A fund can beat its benchmarks and all its peers and still lose money. The
fund manager may be happy; the consultants and brokers who recommended
the hedge fund may be happy; but the investors who put money into the fund
may be fuming.
Looking into indexes
The most common way to compare investment performance is with a market
index. Market indexes are the measures of the overall market that you hear
quoted all the time in the news, like the Standard & Poor’s 500 (S&P 500) and
the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Not only are these widely reviewed, but
also widely mimicked: Many mutual funds and futures contracts are designed
to mimic the performance of market indexes. What this means is that
investors can always do at least as well as the index itself if their investment
objectives call for exposure to that part of the broad investment market.
Indexes aren’t perfect for comparison purposes. One big problem is that
investors often look at the wrong indexes for the type of investments that they
have. For example, an investor may compare the performance of a macro fund
that invests all over the world to the S&P 500 when he or she should use a
global index that includes a range of securities.
In many cases, you should compare a fund to a mixture of indexes. For example,
you should compare a macro fund that invests
30 percent in international equities
30 percent in international bonds
40 percent in currencies
to
30 percent of the return on an international equity index
30 percent of the return on an international bond index
40 percent of the return on a currency index
511
Chapter 5: Evaluating Hedge Fund Performance

Funds

Preparing indexes is a big business. In many cases, indexes are designed and
calculated by newspapers that want to keep their names in front of investors,
so the different companies that calculate and maintain indexes put different
conditions on their use. Anyone offering an S&P 500 index fund has to pay a
fee to Standard & Poor’s. Hedge funds and performance-consulting firms may
have to pay index companies for detailed information about the securities in
the indexes. When a hedge fund presents its results relative to a given index
to you, a prospective investor, it may do so for different reasons:
 Because that index is the best choice
 Because the index’s performance makes the fund look good
 Because another index service was too expensive to use
Verify that your hedge fund uses the same benchmarks every time it reports.
If it changes its benchmarks, that may mean that the fund is trying to make
its performance look good or is changing its investment style so that it no
longer matches the profile of the fund you need in your portfolio.
Different indexes show different results, even if they are calculated using the
same securities. There are several different ways to calculate indexes, and
understanding them can give you a sense of why a fund manager may choose
one over the other.
Market capitalization–weighted index
Market capitalization is the total value of a security. For example, the market
capitalization of a common stock is the total number of shares outstanding
multiplied by the price per share, and the market capitalization of a bond
issue is the number of bonds issued multiplied by the price of each bond. In a
market capitalization–weighted index, different securities are entered in pro-
portion to their total market value. One example of a market
capitalization–weighted index is the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (S&P 500).
A market capitalization–weighted index is a good representation of how the
market as a whole trades, but it may place too much emphasis on the price
fluctuations of the largest companies. The NASDAQ Composite Index, which
represents the value of all the companies traded on NASDAQ, is dispropor-
tionately exposed to the trading of Microsoft and other huge high-tech and
biotech companies. Those huge technology companies are mainstays on
NASDAQ, but most of the companies on that exchange are quite small.
Price-weighted index
A price-weighted index includes one of each security from the group being
measured. For example, a price-weighted stock index includes one share of
each of the companies it tracks, and a price-weighted bond index includes
one share of each of the bonds it tracks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is
an example of a price-weighted index.
512
Book VI: Hedge Funds 

The price-weighted index is independent of the total capitalization of the
included securities, so securities with a high price may be overweighted.
Differing results for different indexes
Even if they include the same securities, price-weighted and market capital-
ization indexes can post different results. Table 5-1 shows how this can
happen.

Picking over peer rankings
If you just want the risk and return that comes with an index, you wouldn’t be
considering paying a hedge fund’s high fees. And if you’ve made the decision
that a hedge fund is the way to go with your money, you’ll want to know how
your fund does against other hedge funds that you could’ve invested in
instead. That’s why you look at peer group rankings.
Many hedge funds report their results to services, like Morningstar (www.
morningstar.com), where the analysts rank funds based on their risk-and-
return parameters. For example, the service ranks arbitrage funds against
other arbitrage funds, and long–short funds against other long–short funds.

Chapter 5: Evaluating Hedge Fund Performance
Book VI
Hedge
Funds

With the information from the services, you can see if your fund is one of the
better or worse ones within a specific style. Unlike Morningstar’s mutual fund
information, you have to pay to see these rankings.
One problem with peer rankings of hedge funds is that reporting is optional,
which makes the picture you see less rounded. A fund that doesn’t do so well
is less likely to report its numbers for a ranking, so the average performance
may have an upward bias. A fund in the bottom half of a published ranking
isn’t in the bottom half of all hedge funds within that style; it’s just in the
bottom half of funds that reported. You can bet that plenty of funds in that
style are worse; they’re just in hiding.
Standardizing performance calculation:
Global Investment Performance Standards
Hedge fund managers have many options to use when calculating and
comparing risk and return, and they have an incentive to choose the methods
that make them look better than the alternatives. In 1996, the Association for
Investment Management and Research, now known as the CFA Institute (www.
cfainstitute.org), introduced its Performance Presentation Standards to
help U.S. investment advisors present their numbers fairly and to make it
easy for investors to compare the performance of different firms. In 2006, the
CFA Institute adopted a revised standard, the Global Investment Performance
Standards (or GIPS), that applies to money managers around the world. The
GIPS include the following:
 Accurate data collection, with records to support the information
 Market-value accounting
 Accrual accounting for the value of any assets that generate income
 Monthly portfolio valuation, ending on the last business day or last
calendar day of the month
 Time-weighted returns
 Results that are net of investment expenses
 Results shown for the last five years (or from the fund’s inception if it’s
less than five years old), with annual results given for each year
Compliance with the standards is voluntary, but it allows fund managers to
market their results to current and prospective investors as being “GIPS
Compliant” or “GIPS Verified.” Still, some hedge funds ignore GIPS, and some-
times for good reasons:
514
Book VI: Hedge Funds 

 It can be expensive to calculate results in the correct manner in order to
qualify for the GIPS label.
 The CFA Institute designed the methodology for investment-manage-
ment firms that handle several different portfolios in-house, but many
hedge funds are one-portfolio operations.
 Not all investors are aware of GIPS or even care, something that the CFA
Institute hopes to change.
Putting Risk and Return into Context
with Academic Measures
It isn’t enough to have the return and risk numbers and comparisons with
indexes or other funds (of course!). You have to put the performance figures
into context to figure out what the portfolio manager did to get those numbers.
Given that hedge funds have huge minimum-investment requirements (see
Chapter 1), investors have a lot of money at stake. Many hedge fund investors,
like employees of pension funds or charitable endowments, have responsibilities
to the people who rely on their funds. These factors are the reasons why
investors need to know what the risk-and-return numbers mean and how they
reflect on hedge fund managers’ performances. Several equations developed
in ivory towers can help you figure out why a hedge fund did as well as it did,
and this section shows you what they are.
Academic approaches to finance have their problems because they’re based
on the assumption that rational investors are trading in efficient markets. You
may be tempted to laugh off the whole idea of academic theories, but that
leaves you with nothing to determine how a hedge fund performed. Look at
the approaches in this section with this limitation in mind.
Sharpe measure
The Sharpe measure, named after Nobel Prize–winning economist William
Sharpe, is the amount of performance that a fund earns over and above the
risk-free rate of return (which, for investors based in the United States, is the
interest rate on Treasury bills) divided by the standard deviation of returns.
(Standard deviation is a mathematical measure of how much one number in a
set varies from the average of all the numbers in the set.) Here’s what the
equation looks like:
r
r
σ p
p
f
-
515
Chapter 5: Evaluating Hedge Fund Performance
Book VI
Hedge
Funds

The Sharpe measure shows whether the portfolio’s return for taking risk (the
return minus the risk-free rate) came by increasing the amount of risk in the
portfolio or from the fund manager’s skill (known as alpha; see Chapter 1),
which allowed her to get a better return than expected from the amount of
standard deviation in the securities held by the portfolio. A higher number is
better than a lower one, because a higher number indicates that the hedge
fund manager is getting more return for the risk that she’s taking.
Treynor measure
Jack Treynor developed a variation of the Sharpe measure that looks at how
a hedge fund performed for the risk it took over and above the risk of the
market as a whole — not just at how it performed relative to the risk-free rate
of return. The equation is
σp
After all, people take risk when they invest, but they can put their money into
a low-fee index fund (a fund invested in the same securities as a broad-market
index, like the S&P 500, with the goal of generating the same return) instead
of paying a hedge fund manager fees for 2 percent of the assets and 20 per-
cent of the profits. For example, if the fund returned 15 percent, the market
rate of return was 10 percent, and the fund’s standard deviation was 20 per-
cent, the Treynor measure would be (15 – 10)/20, or 25 percent. This is better
than a fund with a Treynor measure of 15 percent, and worse than a fund with
a Treynor measure of 35 percent.
Jensen’s alpha
Michael Jensen, a professor at the Harvard School of Business, decided that
investors should just use the capital assets pricing model (CAPM) rather than
Sharpe’s or Treynor’s measures of performance. The CAPM involves alpha.
Hedge fund managers love to talk about alpha. The word derives from the
CAPM; it measures how much an investment returns over and above its beta
(its exposure to the market). Here’s the equation (with A representing alpha):
E(r) = B(rm – rf) + A+ rf
If a portfolio has a positive alpha, the portfolio manager did a good job. If the
portfolio’s alpha is zero or negative, maybe the manager’s fees weren’t deserved.
516
Book VI: Hedge Funds 

The appraisal ratio
Some performance analysts use a fourth measure to evaluate a hedge fund’s
performance: the appraisal ratio, which divides the fund’s alpha by the non-
systematic risk of the portfolio. Although the equation is simple, you more or
less need a computer to generate the statistics involved in this calculation.
The nonsystematic risk is risk that the manager could’ve diversified by adding
more securities to the portfolio but didn’t. The return from the risk isn’t so
much, due to the portfolio manager’s skill as to the portfolio manager’s decision
not to diversify the portfolio. Suppose, for example, that a hedge fund manager
decides to invest only in oil company stock. Beta isn’t the best comparison,
because the fund’s portfolio is far narrower than the entire investment market.
Some of that risk is unnecessary, and the manager could remove it through
diversification. The appraisal ratio is an attempt to separate the diversifiable
risk from the true alpha — the true extra performance due to a portfolio
manager’s skill.
A Reality Check on Hedge Fund Returns
One reason so many investors are interested in hedge funds is because they
think hedge funds are raking in enormous investment returns that other
investors can’t get. Certainly, some hedge funds bring in enormous investment
returns, and the nature of a hedge fund’s structure supports the idea that
other investors are shut out (see Chapter 1 for info on the structure of hedge
funds). But the reality is that many hedge funds don’t perform in the stratos-
phere, which is why you need to know what you want from your investments
before you commit. The following sections aim to put you in touch with your
investment needs by bringing to light many facts about hedge fund returns.
Risk and return tradeoff
Some hedge funds post poor results relative to a stock-market index because
they’re designed to perform very differently. Investment return is a function
of risk; the more risk a fund takes, the greater its expected return. A hedge
fund’s goal is to post a return that’s greater than expected for a given level of
risk. Some funds choose high risk levels in the hopes of even higher returns,
and others maintain very low risk levels and generate relatively low returns.
517
Chapter 5: Evaluating Hedge Fund Performance
Book VI
Hedge
Funds

Many investors are content with an 8 percent return year in and year out, but
others would find this incredibly disappointing. Before you commit to a
hedge fund, you need to know your investment objectives inside and out;
refer to Chapter 2.
Survivor bias
Many hedge fund managers limit how often investors can make withdrawals,
but they can’t lock up an investor’s money forever. A fund may require that
an investor keep money in for two years, but if performance is bad in both
years, you can bet that the investor will yank the money as soon as the time
period expires.
In addition, hedge fund managers charge high fees, but they can collect a profit
payout only if the funds show a profit (see Chapter 1). If a fund isn’t doing so
well, its investors will go, and the fund manager will want out, too, so he can
make some money elsewhere. Hedge Fund Research, a firm that tracks hedge
funds, estimated that 11.4 percent of hedge funds folded in 2005.
When looking at long-term results for hedge funds, remember that the worst
performing funds all probably dropped out of the game after two years,
which means funds that are still in business have less competition. They
already have better-than-average status because they’re still in business.
However, unless they’re looking for new investors, they’ll force you to invest
in a newly formed fund. Will it be a survivor or one of the ones that eventu-
ally shut down?
Performance persistence
One huge problem for any hedge fund and its investors is following one good
year with another. Is a great number the result of luck, or is it due to the
portfolio manager’s skill? Will the manager’s luck hold out next year? Will a
skilled portfolio manager face bad luck next year? It’s really hard to post good
performance year after year — a problem known as performance persistence.
A study published in 2000 by Vikas Agarwal of Georgia State University and
Narayan Naik of the London Business School found no evidence of persistence
in the funds that they studied. One year’s performance wasn’t an indicator of
the next year’s, and the relationship between performance one year and the
next weakened as more time periods were included in the study. What does
this mean? If a hedge fund has the kind of extraordinary return that grabs
headlines this year, it probably won’t bring in those spectacular returns the
next year. This is a phenomenon known as reversion to the mean.
518
Book VI: Hedge Funds 

Style persistence
The problem of a fund manager changing style to get performance is called
style persistence. If a fund keeps changing its investment strategy, it may post
good numbers, but consultants, academics, and others who evaluate returns
may not know what to do with the fund.
Academic performance studies in particular control for different risk mea-
sures, which affects the performance persistence that they report. Some
funds show persistence, but that’s because the fund changes its investment
style with the market. Some investors may want a hedge fund that’s flexible
and can post a consistent return no matter what. Other investors may need a
fund to limit its investments or maintain a consistent risk profile so that it
complements other parts of their portfolios.
Hiring a Reporting Service to Track
Hedge Fund Performance
Given all the information-collecting options covered in the pages of this chap-
ter, how in the world are you supposed to keep track of everything to find out
how a hedge fund actually performs? Some people require help in this area,
and help is available. Along with the numbers that the fund manager presents,
you can find several consulting firms and reporting services that monitor how
hedge funds perform, analyze their results, and evaluate their risk and return
based on the styles that the fund managers follow. The following list is by no
means exhaustive and doesn’t represent an endorsement. But it should give
you some ideas of where to start if you want to enlist some help to evaluate hedge
fund performance. Be forewarned: Most of these companies charge for their
services — and charge a lot.
 Greenwich Alternative Investments: Greenwich (www.greenwichai.
com) is one of many hedge fund services that operates in two businesses:
A consulting firm that advises investors on hedge fund investments, and
a hedge fund performance-analysis service. Some information on the
performance of broad categories of hedge funds is available for free from
the Web site, but other information is available only to institutional
investors (pensions, endowments, and foundations) that pay the firm 
for its services.
 HedgeFund.net: HedgeFund.net maintains a database of quantitative
and qualitative information about hedge funds, submitted by the funds
themselves. The site also carries news and information about the industry
(even offering a free daily report) and offers both free and paid services;
however, all subscribers must be accredited investors.

istration. It has at least some information on 9,000 funds and detailed
information on 5,800 of them. This helps people determine how many
funds are being formed, how many are being disbanded, and what kind
of returns are being generated for investors. Full access is available to
accredited investors for a fee.
 Lipper HedgeWorld: Lipper (www.lipperhedgeworld.com) made its
name in mutual fund performance reporting, and it now offers hedge
fund performance services as well. The company, owned by Reuters,
offers a variety of free and paid reports on performance. How much
access you get depends on whether you’re accredited and how much
you’re willing to pay.
 Managed Account Report: Managed Account Report (www.marhedge.
com) collects news and information on the hedge fund industry, organizes
conferences, and reports on hedge fund performance. The firm collects its
data from fund managers and reports it to subscribers on its Web site and
print publication. It compares results to indexes of hedge fund perfor-
mance prepared by The Barclay Group (www.barclaygrp.com). Sub-
scribers don’t have to be accredited investors.
 Morningstar: Morningstar (www.morningstar.com) is a dominant firm
for mutual fund performance analysis, and it’s building a niche in hedge
funds. Funds report their own performance numbers each month. The
database was started in 2004 and holds information on 3,000 hedge funds,
funds of hedge funds, and commodity trading advisors. Subscribers, who
must be accredited investors, can access the site’s information to get a
sense of how a fund’s risk and return compares to other hedge funds fol-

Value Investing

alue investing is good old-fashioned investing: It
takes you back to the tried-and-true principles of
valuing a stock as one would value a business. When the
price, or value, of a stock matches the value of a business,
the value investor considers buying it. When the price of a
stock is less than the value of the business, the value
investor warms and may get excited about buying it. And
when the price of the stock skyrockets past the value of
the company, yes, the value investor sells it.
Believe it or not, markets do undervalue businesses, and
do so frequently. Because there is no magic formula for
valuing a business, the true value of a stock is a matter of
opinion anyway. All of which serves to make investing more
fun –– and proﬁtable –– for the prudent and diligent investor
who sorts through available information to best understand
a company’s value.
A value investor who applies the principles brought forth
in this book is essentially betting with the house. The odds,
especially in the long term, are in your favor.

N
o doubt, somewhere during your investing career you’ve heard something
about value investing. You may know it’s “what Warren Buffett does,” or
maybe you’ve seen mutual funds described as “value-oriented.” You have a
pretty good idea what the word value means in ordinary English, but how does
it apply to investing? What is value investing, anyway? This chapter answers
that question and helps you decide whether you’re a value investor at heart.
What Value Investing Is — And Isn’t
If you ask investors (amateur or professional) to define value investing, you’ll
hear a lot of different answers that might include phrases like “conservative,”
“long-term oriented,” “the opposite of growth,” “the Buffett approach,” “buying
stocks with a low P/E,” “buying stuff that’s cheap,” or “buying stocks that nobody
wants.” Aside from “the opposite of growth,” each of these phrases is a valid part
of the definition.
Broadly defined, value investing is an investing approach and style blending
many principles of business and financial analysis to arrive at good investing
decisions. To be more specific,
Value investing is buying shares of a business as though you were buying
the business itself. Value investors emphasize the intrinsic value of assets
and current and future profits, and they pay a price equal to or less than
that value.

524
Book VII: Value Investing 
Note the key phrases “buying . . . a business,” “intrinsic value,” and “pay a
price equal to or less than that value.” These are explicit tenets of the value
investing approach, and underlying them all is the notion of conscious
appraisal — that is, the idea of a rigorous and deliberate attempt to measure
business value.
Obviously, price enters the value investor’s appraisal, but you’ll notice that it
appears at the end of the definition. Value investors go to the stock market
only to buy their share of the business. They don’t look at the market as a
first indicator of whether or not to invest.
Important value investing principles
With the definition of value investing as an appetizer, here’s a main course of
value investing principles:
 Buying a business: If you take nothing else away from this part of the
book, take away the thought process that investing in stocks is really
like buying a business. No matter how large or small the company you’re
investing in, you want to find out as much as possible about it before
you commit your capital.
If you got caught in the tech boom and bust, you may think you did
exactly that. You followed a company and its story. Everything the com-
pany did made headlines. Everybody wanted to own its products or
work for the company. So you bought shares.
But did you look at business fundamentals? The intrinsic value of assets
and future profit prospects? Did you understand the company’s strategy
and competitive advantages? Did you do your homework to assess
whether the stock price was at or below your appraisal? Likely not. That’s
the difference between value investing and most other investing forms.
 A conscious appraisal: If you were interested in buying a business and
thought the corner hardware store looked attractive, how much would
you be willing to pay for it? You would likely be influenced by the sale
price of other hardware stores and by opinions shared by neighbors and
other customers. But you would still center your attention on the intrinsic
economic value — the worth and profit-generation potential — of that
business, and a determination of whether that value justified the price.
Value investors refer to this process as an appraisal of the business. They
rely on publicly available facts and figures to conduct a true numbers
assessment — an appraisal of intrinsic value, not just the market price.
Appraising the value, relating the value to the price, and looking for
good bargains capture the essence of the value approach.

 Beyond the fundamentals: Basic investment analysis should start with
an analysis of business fundamentals: the metrics and measures that
define business performance, like profitability, productivity, and capital
structure. But it needs to go further to be blended with a company’s “story”
to determine whether the fundamentals will hold up or, better yet, improve.
The value investor gets good at blending the two.
Adopting the value investing approach means becoming your own
investment analyst. You may read the work of others, but you’ll incorporate
it into your own analysis and investing decision.
 Ignoring the market: How can you spot the value investor at a cocktail
party? Easy. She is the only one talking about an actual company while
others stand around discussing the stock market.
Focusing on the company itself, not on the market, is a consistent value
investing attribute. As a general rule, value investors ignore the market
and tune out brokers, advisers, and commentators. They may, however,
listen to folks in the industry, customers, or people who know a lot
about competitors.
Value investors have a long-term focus. And if they’ve done their homework
right, what the market does to their stocks on a daily basis is irrelevant.
To be sure, external factors can affect stock prices. Interest rates, in
particular, can also affect the intrinsic values of companies, as the cost
of capital rises and falls and the value of alternative investments increases.
So it makes sense to pay some attention to the markets, especially in the
long term. But daily fluctuations should be ignored. Value investors wait
anywhere from a few years to forever for their investments to mature.
 A quest for consistency: Most value investors like a high degree of
consistency in returns, profitability, growth, asset value, management
effectiveness, customer base, supply chain, and most other aspects of
the business. It’s the same consistency you’d strive for if you bought a
business to run yourself.
The value investor looks for consistency in an attempt to minimize risk
and provide a margin of safety for his investment. This is not to say the
value investor won’t invest in a risky enterprise, but the price paid for
earnings potential must correctly reflect the risk. Consistency need not
be absolute, but predictable performance is important.
More than meets the eye
Value investing isn’t only about long-term investing, low P/E ratios, cheap
stocks, and diversification. And it isn’t about being the opposite of investing
in growth. The following list helps define value investing by showing that
“Value investing isn’t just . . .”
525
Chapter 1: An Investor’s Guide to Value Investing
Book VII
Value
Investing

 Long-term investing: Most value investments are long-term. The
Buffettonian view is to “hold forever” and look for businesses that you
would want to hold forever. But not all long-term investments are good
values, and not all value investments are long-term. Indeed, as business
cycles shorten, what is excellent today may soon look like a flash in the
pan as technologies and marketplace acceptance change.
Buffett deals with this problem by avoiding technology stocks, but even
businesses in other sectors see their products changing ever more quickly.
You once could buy only one “flavor” of Tide detergent, but now there
are dozens, and they change all the time.
So when buying a business, it’s good to look long term, but you must
also realize that businesses and their markets change, and you should
always be prepared to sell if assumptions change. It’d be nice to hold
forever, but that doesn’t mean you should expect to or have to.
 Low P/E ratios: Oil companies, banks, food producers, steel companies —
they all have had P/E (price-to-earnings) ratios below market averages.
(See Chapters 3 and 4 for an explanation of P/E.) But does that mean they
are good values? Sometimes, but not always. Even Enron traded with low
P/Es at times.
While low P/E can be part of the investing equation, especially when
deciding when the stock price is right, it is far from the whole story.
 The opposite of growth: “Stock ABC is a growth stock, and stock XYZ is
a value stock.” You hear that all the time, and you also hear it about
mutual funds, which are neatly divvied up into neat little boxes tagged
as “growth,” “value,” and “blend.”
So value stocks aren’t supposed to grow? Well, some, like your local
electric utility, may prosper just fine on the business they have, but for
most companies, growth is an integral part of the value of the business.
I place growth in the center of the “value” stage. The potential for growth
defines some companies as good values; the current assets and perhaps
even current business levels alone don’t justify the price. Indeed, this is
what separates early value investing, as practiced and preached by patriarch
Ben Graham, from the more recent views practiced by Buffett and many of
his current disciples: Growth creates value.
 Cheap stocks: Above all, value investors seek to buy businesses at or
below their appraised value. Why? Not just because they like to get a
good deal — it’s to provide a margin of safety. Since any business appraisal
is imprecise in its best case, the value investor likes to give a cushion for
error, a cushion just in case things don’t turn out exactly as assessed.
Does that mean that a value investor always buys a stock below its highest
price? Usually, but not always. Does a value investor “bottom fish” for
the lowest 52-week price? Usually not. A stock at a 52-week low may
have serious flaws in its business or marketplace acceptance.
526
Book VII: Value Investing 

 Diversification: You hear it constantly: The key to investing success is
to diversify. Diversification provides safety in numbers and avoids the
eggs-in-one-basket syndrome, so it protects the value of a portfolio.
Yes, there’s some truth to that. But the masters of value investing have
shown that diversification only serves to dilute returns. If you’re doing
the value investing thing right, you are picking the right stocks at the right
price, so there’s no need to provide this extra insurance. That said,
perhaps diversification isn’t a bad idea until you prove yourself a good
value investor. The point is that diversification per se is not a value
investing technique.
Are You a Value Investor?
If you’re asking yourself the same question, following are seven character
traits found in most value investors. You don’t have to display every one to be
a good value investor, but you want to see yourself in at least some of them.
 Bargain hunter: If you check the price of the hotel across the street
before you check into your chosen hotel, you have a key trait of a value
investor.
 Do-it-yourselfer: Value investors want to check the numbers themselves
and build their own assessments. By doing so, they develop a better
understanding of the company and its fundamentals.
 Like margins of safety: People who actually slow down when it rains are
more likely to be better value investors.
 Long-term focus: Value investors would rather make a lot of money
slowly than a little flashy money in one day.
 Business, not price, oriented: The value investor focuses on the under-
lying business, not the price or superficial image.
 Numbers oriented: Not advanced mathematics, mind you, but you can’t
get completely away from the numbers. Value investors are concerned
about company business fundamentals and performance. For those who
don’t like numbers, fortunately there are software packages that do
some of the computation and preparation for you.
 Contrarian: Value investors are not crowd followers! Value investors
stay away from what’s exciting and hip quite purposefully: Popular
stocks aren’t normally bargains.

The Value Investing Story
Volatility. You hear about it all the time. The market is on cruise control, and
then all of a sudden, something unforeseen happens to stir things up.
Subprime loan defaults. Oil prices. A war. The markets have run mostly up
and to the right for 25-plus years, but along the way, we’ve had our bumps.
The first years of this century signified an important turning point in the
history of investing. In the late 1990s, investors had moved away from analysis
of business fundamentals. As the percentage of stock-owning households
boomed, a growing portion of the investing public knew little about reading
financial statements — or perhaps even where to find one! People bought
stocks based on stories they heard from colleagues at the office or friends at
parties. And the retail brokerage industry got into the game, too, offering
investment analysis that seemingly supported almost anything.
Since the dot-com bubble burst, value investing has caught on, and we’ve
seen a dramatic return to investing based on fundamentals — so much so
that many of the so-called “value” stocks actually became overvalued.
The good news is that value investing has become more popular, so there’s
more information and commentary out there to help the value investor. The
bad news is that value investing has become more popular, so it’s harder to
find good values!
A short history of the markets
They say history predicts the future, so let’s take a short tour of the past six
decades of stock market history, with special focus on lessons for value
investors:
 The good old days — 1950s and 1960s: Time was, you simply bought
the market, and you bought for the long term. The stock certificates sat
in your safety deposit box, and a few government bonds or savings
bonds may have sat alongside them. You checked the paper at most
weekly, and you watched market reports nightly on the Huntley-Brinkley
Report. You cared more about the averages than your individual stocks,
because the market was your stocks. Your investments grew with the
economy. There was little to worry about and little for you to do.
 Political ties and international dependence — 1970s: On May 1, 1975,
high fixed brokerage commissions became a thing of the past. Lower
commissions enabled more individual investors to trade in and out of
stocks more frequently. This factor, plus the advent of NASDAQ, made
do-it-yourself investing feasible for the first time. As a result, markets
became more liquid.
528
Book VII: Value Investing 

Also in the 1970s, investors started to realize that investments weren’t
bound to follow the economy as a whole — that certain sectors and
industries were bound to do better than others. Cyclical companies and
companies overly dependent on cheap, abundant resources — such as
foreign oil — were no longer the best bets. It was the beginning of a
more complex, dynamic investing climate. But aside from annual reports
and other company releases, there was little information for a value-
oriented investor to use.
 Globalization, asset shift, and technology — 1980s: Interest rates in the
early 1980s were kept artificially high to combat inflation, and they stifled
business growth. But in 1982, as interest rates and inflation eased, President
Reagan pushed through tax legislation that included a new assortment
of retirement savings incentives for individuals and small businesses.
Transportation deregulation, more free trade, and increased government
spending in technology and defense sectors added to the story. The
result was a long-awaited shift of capital from real estate and fixed assets
into stocks. The bull run, which was to last almost 18 years with a few
short interruptions, had begun.
Lower taxes, as well as business and consumer optimism, led the markets
higher and induced people to spend more. But they were buying a lot of
foreign goods, and a ballooning trade deficit resulted. To keep the dollar
relatively strong and attractive for foreign investment, interest rates were
kept high. The leftover inflation fear from a few years prior also fueled a
lingering high interest rate mentality. In October 1987, a particularly bad
trade deficit report, high interest rates (over 10 percent for U.S. Treasury
bonds), and some speculative excess in stocks created a volatile mix. The
Dow experienced its worst one-day percentage plunge ever.
After six months, investors once again gained confidence and started
back in, but this time more cautiously. Even the most secure long-term
investor now had to watch for “perfect storms” that could wipe out huge
chunks of market value. Conditions were still favorable for investing in
businesses — and even more so as interest rates and the dollar declined.
But the imperative to invest rationally grew by leaps and bounds.
 Democratization and the Internet bubble — 1990s: As the decade began,
the boom of the 1980s had slowed; key industries, such as automobiles
and basic manufacturing, saw a down cycle, exacerbated once again by
the flood of imports. The markets really didn’t get going again until 1992.
Newly elected President Bill Clinton and his vision of the “information
superhighway” jazzed the markets, particularly the technology sector. The
vision promised faster, more efficient business and a new conduit to reach
customers.
The growth of the Internet was not just a boon to suppliers of Internet
“parts,” nor to Internet-only companies building a new electronic channel
to sell existing products. It was an opportunity for all businesses to
529

build a new market presence and streamline or simplify operations.
Every company developed a Web strategy, and the stock market liked
what it saw.
In June 1998, the stock price of a small company called Amazon.com
started to move. The market awoke to the dot.com concept, and the
stock rocketed skyward. Soon, other companies started following suit.
The whole game became finding companies that hadn’t been “discovered”
yet and buying stock in them before they took off. The Internet stock
boom took the rest of the market with it.
There was another force at work, shaped by the Internet. For the first
time in history, individual investors had virtual real-time connections to
the stock market. Free and easy access gave entry to many more market
players, and the market was already in a boom to begin with.
The start of the new century saw a fading business cycle and the realization
that, although the Internet brought improvements in business fundamentals
and productivity, it wasn’t off-the-charts improvement. The presence and
use of the Internet did not guarantee success to any business.
The grim result and profound lessons are recent enough to stick in the
minds of all investors. There were many lessons — some repeated his-
tory and some were new. No bull market can go on forever; overvalued
stocks should be treated as such, growth in value of business assets
cannot consistently exceed growth in the economy, and it takes more
than a business plan to guarantee success. One other obvious realiza-
tion from this period: Business cycles are becoming ever shorter, and
investors need to stay on top of these cycles and invest accordingly.
 Trust shattered and recovered — the Oughts: In November 2001, Enron
shocked the investment world when a $1 billion write-off for assets
suddenly deemed worthless was revealed. No longer could we trust 
what had been sacred — the reporting of financial results. When Adelphia
Communications and WorldCom went down for much the same reason, we
suddenly realized a much bigger problem: Most individuals — and a large
number of professional investors and analysts — never really understood
financial statements. We had forgotten that, although assets might be ficti-
tious and subjectively valued, liabilities are always real. Following the trail
of how a company came up with its numbers was nearly impossible and, in
the era of increased public visibility, where any earnings “miss” was sure to
be punished, executives did what they could to make things look right.
Meanwhile, questions started to emerge about the brokerage and invest-
ment banking industries. The very companies who hired these analysts
and published their advice had investment banking relationships with
the companies they followed.
530
Book VII: Value Investing 

Corporate earnings declined substantially during the fallout from the
bust. After overspending, especially on technology, businesses simply
stopped spending. Consumers, shaken by the 9/11 terrorists attacks and
job instability, also cut back. Growth expectations fell, and stocks fell to
lows that many thought would never be seen.
But the Fed took quick action to stimulate the economy by dropping interest
rates, and a renewed focus on business fundamentals and rationale squeezed
the previous fluff out of the business environment. Corporate investing
decisions once again became based on ROI (return on investment) and,
perhaps helped along by Congress and new accounting rules, financial
reporting regained footing in reality.
The result: Markets in 2003 started a four-year trend upward, culminating
in new record highs set in the summer of 2007. But unlike the previous
highs set in 2000, these were based on corporate profitability — and
hence, value.
How value investing evolved
Before 2002, value investing had relatively low visibility. But after the bubble
market popped (loudly), more investors realized that the value investing
approach has earned strong returns for its faithful followers, often far beyond
market averages for good stock pickers.
Value investing often deals in boring industries and requires patient examination
of the nitty-gritty details of financial statements. Value analysis comes slowly,
as does value investing success. If that sounds discouraging, read on to gain
some inspiration from the most successful value investors, Benjamin Graham
and Warren Buffett. Value investing got its beginnings and developed into a
serious investing discipline based on their teachings and experiences.
The patriarch: Benjamin Graham
The beginnings of value investing as a documented discipline go back to
Benjamin Graham. Graham was a self-made financial analyst and investor
who proved very successful through some very trying investing times (as in
the Great Depression). He founded Graham-Newman, a New York investment
firm, and left a legacy for the rest of us when he wrote the original bibles of
value investing: Security Analysis and The Intelligent Investor. Both are still in
print today. (The Intelligent Investor, which is largely a repacking of Security
Analysis for the individual investor, is much shorter and an easier read.) He
also taught the art of value investing at Columbia University, and one of his
students was Warren Buffett. To this day, Mr. Buffett and other Graham disci-
ples pay the utmost respect to his pioneering leadership.
531
Chapter 1: An Investor’s Guide to Value Investing
Book VII
Value
Investing

Graham and his followers relied on the balance sheet for the first indication 
of a company’s status and value. Essentially, the balance sheet is a snapshot of
what the company owns and what it owes. If it owns more than it owes, the
company scores points with the value investor. If what it owns is productive
and has marketable value, the company scores more points. (Many value investors
today still place emphasis on the balance sheet, while others, notably Buffett,
take a closer look at the income and cash flow statements. The reality: You
have to look at all three statements; they are inextricably linked. None of the
three alone can tell the whole story. See Chapter 2 for all the details on
financial reports.)
Graham believed that the balance sheet revealed the foundation, the value
below which a company would never go. The balance sheet also reveals the
degree of safety in the form of liquid assets and assets in excess of debt.
One of Graham’s many lasting contributions is a simple, easy-to-use formula he
devised to calculate a company’s intrinsic value. Graham was trying to establish
a stock’s value based on earnings and earnings growth, while keeping an eye on
bond yields available as an alternative. The formula: Take current earnings,
apply a base P/E ratio (see Chapter 3 for details on the P/E ratio), add a growth
factor if there is growth, and adjust according to current bond yield. The result
is an intrinsic value that the stock can be expected to achieve in the real world if
growth targets are met. The formula is shown in Chapter 4.
The master: Warren Buffett
Warren Buffett has turned his steady devotion to value investing principles
into some $52 billion in net worth. He is the second wealthiest person in the
world (depending on the price of Microsoft stock). Buffett is clearly the
Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods of value investing. His on-court record cannot
be touched, and it would be a disservice not to mention Buffett’s off-court
demeanor, where his candor, clairvoyance, and wit combine with his humble
lifestyle to create a model for all of us to emulate.
Buffett displayed business acumen from an early age but dropped out of
college before getting a degree. When Benjamin Graham’s Intelligent Investor
hit the shelves, Buffett applied to Columbia Business School, where he
became one of Graham’s students. The rest, as they say, is history.
Buffett later worked for Graham at the brokerage firm Graham-Newman,
where he learned to manage investment portfolios and use insurance
company assets as an effective investing vehicle. From these beginnings
Buffett started his own investment fund (with contributed capital from
neighbors, relatives, coworkers, and the like) and later built the Taj Mahal of
investment companies, Berkshire Hathaway.
532
Book VII: Value Investing 

Berkshire Hathaway
Buffett first spied Berkshire, a faltering Massachusetts textile company, in 1962.
He saw potential value in a very depressed stock and began buying shares
cheap for his partnership. Buffett continued to accumulate shares until the
partnership owned 49 percent of the company by 1965. He effectively
controlled the company.
Originally, Buffett planned to right some of the wrongs and capture quick
gains by selling or merging the company. But he saw a tempting opportunity
to use Berkshire as an investment conduit to build worth by buying other
businesses.
When Buffett distributed the partnership in 1969, he offered a choice of cash or
Berkshire shares as part of the distribution. If you had 200 shares, you would
have received about $8,400. For his portion, Buffett took shares. He offered to
buy the shares of other partners for himself. A small group of now-wealthy folks
made the choice to stick with Buffett, and many of them still make the annual
pilgrimage to Omaha to enjoy those juicy steaks and count their blessings.
Why? Those shares, worth $42 apiece then, are worth about $135,000 apiece in
late 2007. The 200-share investment would be worth $27 million today!
Berkshire is now the world’s largest investing pool. The Berkshire formula is this:
 Employ cash flows from businesses owned within the holding company.
 Buy stocks and bonds in the open market.
 Use the cash flow to buy businesses outright — preferably cash rich 
and cash generating — to build the investment pool and increase 
book value.
 Acquire solid insurance companies to provide cash flow and further
build investing float and to insulate from downturns.
Gradually, Buffett shifted his emphasis from small, opportunistic, turnaround
situations to longer-term large cap investments and even acquired whole
companies when the numbers were right. He did this with a clear eye on
tapping the growth potential of the major companies and major brands that
are abundant in American life. Berkshire put together a world-class portfolio
of high visibility blue chip growth stocks, including such household names as
Coca-Cola, Gillette, American Express, and Wells Fargo.
Intrinsic value on the balance sheet, solid earnings with at least some growth
and growth potential, and solid value in the franchise are what Buffett looked
for in all his investments. And always –– repeat, always –– at a good price.
Berkshire Hathaway acquired 200 million shares of Coke in the mid-1980s at
around $6 to $6.50 per share (split adjusted). Coke generally sells at over $50
today. The Berkshire before-tax profit is in the $10 billion range.

Shares? Why not the whole company?
Acquiring shares certainly works over time and is what we ordinary value
investors should be focused on. But Berkshire went beyond this strategy —
way beyond — to buy whole companies for its portfolio. Why? Two reasons,
mainly. If you own the whole company you’re entitled to its cash and cash
flow and can reinvest it as you wish. You don’t have to compete with other
shareholders, and management and reporting relationships are simpler.
So Berkshire Hathaway has made many “whole enchilada” investments. The
insurance group has grown substantially and is anchored by consumer favorite
GEICO (originally bought by Ben Graham in the 1950s), and by General Re in
the lucrative reinsurance (wholesale insurance) market. The companies play in
different insurance segments and combined to produce almost $100 billion in
revenue in 2006, with $11 billion in net profits and $50 billion in float — cash
taken in but not paid out on claims and used for investments.
The manufacturing, retail, and service group of Berkshire Hathaway now
consists of some 70 companies, large and small, all successful in their own
arena. What do all Berkshire Hathaway companies have in common?
 They are profitable, safe, and solid.
 They are easy to understand with simple business models.
 They produce plenty of cash flow to reinvest.
 They are unique businesses with strong market positions and franchises.
 They have solid, trustworthy management.
 They were bought at reasonable prices.
We ordinary value investors can’t assemble this kind of portfolio, but we can
learn from what makes Berkshire Hathaway and its master tick. That’s ground
to be covered in the rest of this book.
Today: The world is flat, and other trends
In the past six decades, the investment style of the day has shifted from value
to growth to outright speculation, back to value, and maybe back to growth
(although I don’t separate growth and value to the extent that many market
experts do). It’s worth noting other current business and investing trends:
 Globalization: Businesses are increasing global market reach into inter-
national economies and are increasing “supply” reach in sourcing goods
and services at the lowest possible prices. Value investors need to
appraise whether a business is getting the most out of these trends,
taking advantage of available import and export opportunities.
534
Book VII: Value Investing 

 Shorter business cycles: It took the railroad industry 70 years to start,
prosper, and begin its decline. It took the Internet industry about seven
years to do the same. The point: Business changes come much faster,
and what you invest in today may not even be around in ten years. You
must stay on top of business and technology trends.
 The Information Age: It’s here, and there’s no going back. The success
of a business often depends on its use of information systems and tech-
nology; in fact, in many businesses, it’s a key competitive advantage that
forms a moat or barrier to entry for others. But technology leadership can
be notoriously hard to assess.
 Volatility: Exacerbated by the three factors just mentioned, market
volatility seems to be here to stay. Markets will rise and fall in 5 or 10
percent increments in a given month, with no real change in business
value to support the change. Investors must, more than ever, be patient
and try to separate real business change from market change. And they
will learn to use the dips to find value.
A Short Math Primer
Value investing is inherently analytical and numbers-based, and to become
fluent in the value investing thought process, it’s important to grasp a few
key math principles. The following four lessons bubble up to the top as the
most important; other principles and computational shortcuts can be found
in Value Investing For Dummies, 2nd Edition.
Lesson 1: Time value of money
A dollar today isn’t worth the same amount as a dollar yesterday, nor is it
worth the same amount as a dollar tomorrow. Invested money appreciates
with time.
An investment that has a present value of $10 will (we hope) grow over time,
so its future value will include the initial $10 plus all returns generated. Invested
money grows and compounds. There is growth on the original investment,
plus return and growth on returns already earned. A snowball rolling downhill
is a good analogy: As the ball gets bigger, it picks up ever-larger amounts of
snow. How much? Compounding formulas, which are driven by rate of return
and the amount of time, supply the answer.
535
Chapter 1: An Investor’s Guide to Value Investing

Value
Investing

Suppose that someone promises to pay you $10 five years from now. Are you
$10 wealthier? No. To have $10 in the future, you need to put only some fraction
of that $10 in the bank today. The exact fraction depends on the same factors
that drive future value: rate of return and time. At 10 percent, you would need to
deposit only $6.21 today to have $10 five years from now. Same formula, but this
time, the approach is from the opposite direction. Instead of asking, “What is my
$10 worth in five years?” you ask, “What would I need today to have $10 in five
years?”
The magic compounding formula
The fundamental time-value-of-money, or compounding, formula provides an
indispensable foundation for value investors. A word of advice: It’s just as
important to understand the formula, the dynamics, and the factors that drive
or have the most influence on the result as it is to memorize the formula to
do lots of math problems. Furthermore, just as it takes more than garlic to
cook, you need a lot more than this formula to select stocks and be successful
Here’s the formula:
FV = PV × (1 + i)n
where . . .
FV is future value
PV is present value
i is the interest rate, or rate of return
n is the number of years invested
Taking apart the formula: The future value is a function of the present value,
expanded or compounded by the interest rate over time. To calculate a return
for one year, simply take PV and multiply by 1 (to preserve the original value)
plus i (to increment by the interest rate or rate of return). The result is future
value.
To calculate the return for more than one year, it gets more interesting.
Multiply PV by (1 + i) factored by the number of years, so 5 years is (PV) ×
(1 + i) × (1 + i) × (1 + i) × (1 + i) × (1 + i). Each (1 + i) indicates another year of
compounding interest. The FV of $10 invested at 10 percent over 5 years is
FV = $10 × (1 + .10)5
or
$10 × (1.61), or $16.10
Fine, we can calculate future value. But what about present value? What if
you want to figure out what interest rate would give you $16.10 on a $10
investment if held for five years? In other words, what if you want to work
backwards? You can transpose the formula algebraically to calculate PV, i,
and even n:
536
Book VII: Value Investing 

1) PV = FV ÷ (1 + i)n
2) i = [(FV ÷ PV )(1/n))] – 1 or the nth root of (FV/PV)
3) n is trickier — it involves logarithms!
The power of i and n
The nature of the (1 + i)n expression in our formula produces a fascinating
result. If i is small, no matter how large the n, the end result doesn’t grow
much. Likewise, if n is small, it doesn’t so much matter what the i is.
The power of compounding assumes its full glory (and your investments
reach their full girth) as i and n get larger. The and is important! Value
investors look for a few more i points of return and to hold the productive
investment for as many n years as possible.
Because n is an exponent, it exerts the greatest power and influence on your
investing portfolio. Time is an investor’s best friend. As Warren Buffett says,
“Time is the friend of the good business, and the enemy of the poor one.” No
wonder value investors tend to be long-term investors! Upshot: Find the best
possible i and then let n happen.
Lesson 2: Return rates done right
Just what is the rate of return on an investment? It depends on how it’s calcu-
lated. Say that you have a friend who brags about buying a house for $150,000
and selling it ten years later for $600,000. She may call that a 300 percent
return: an average of 30 percent per year. On the surface, that’s correct.
But when you evaluate the home purchase as an investment (compared to
other investments), you must include the compounding effect to have an
accurate, apples-to-apples comparison. If that $150,000 were invested ten
years ago in such a way as to allow returns to compound, what rate of return
would have produced $600,000?
The compounded rate of return is sometimes called the geometric rate of return.
It stands in contrast to the straight average approach of simply dividing the
total return by the number of years (as in 300 percent ÷ 10 equals 30 percent
annually). So, how do you calculate true compounded, or geometric, rates of
return? There is a formula:
Compounded rate of return = [(Ending value/Beginning value)(1/n)] – 1
where n equals the number of years.
537
Chapter 1: An Investor’s Guide to Value Investing
Book VII
Value
Investing

In the example, $600,000/$150,000 is 4. Take 4 to the 1⁄10th power (use your cal-
culator) and get 1.149. Subtract 1, and get 14.9 percent. Obviously, your
friend’s home purchase was still lucrative, but 14.9 percent return doesn’t
make headlines the way 30 percent would.
Lesson 3: How buying cheap really pays
What investor hasn’t heard the advice “buy low and sell high”? The principle
behind this cliché is so obvious that one can hardly write about it. But in the
irrationally exuberant markets of 1999 and 2000, this old standard gradually
gave way to “buy high, sell higher.” Traders (and novice investors experienc-
ing the markets for the first time) bought stocks because they were going up,
defying value investing logic.
What’s the problem? The higher a price you pay for a stock, the less likely it
is to achieve a high rate of return. Suppose that a stock has an intrinsic value
of $75. If you pay $100 for it, you’re essentially betting that something good
will happen to dramatically increase intrinsic value — or that some greater
fool is out there to pay $110.
But suppose that you were to buy the same stock at $50 as a value play, meaning
that you think it’s undervalued. The chance for a 50 percent return — reverting to
intrinsic value — is much higher than with the at-value or overvalued $100 stock.
Keep your i on the ball
Value investors always look for the opportunity to achieve superior i. You
achieve superior i by buying a stock with good fundamentals, including growth.
So you get the growth rate — perhaps 6 percent, maybe 8 percent, or even 10
percent. But as a bonus, you also get the return to intrinsic value, which can
increase returns substantially. The lower the price paid, the higher the likeli-
hood of above-average returns. This idea comes straight from the teachings of
Ben Graham and the practice of Warren Buffett.
How much does buying cheap help?
Take a look at Table 1-1. Note how long-term profits jump as the rate of return
grows beyond the market average and time has an opportunity to work its
magic. An investor consistently beating the market by 2 percent would achieve
20 percent greater return in 10 years ($3,106/$2,594), 43 percent in 20 years,
and 72 percent in 30 years. An investor beating the market by 6 percent would
get 70 percent more in 10 years, 189 percent in 20 years, and 392 percent, or
almost 5 times as much profitable return, in 30 years.

Lesson 4: Beware of large numbers
In investing, like life, some numbers are too good to be true and can’t go on
forever. Say a high-tech company brags in each report of a continuous 30
percent growth in sales and profits. The stock is priced at a lofty 60 times
earnings because it’s the norm for stocks in that industry to have price-
earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratios of 2 (that is, P/E can be twice the growth
rate). So what’s the problem? In a word, sustainability.
Suppose that your company has $100 million in sales today. To achieve a 30
percent growth rate, it has to achieve $130 million in sales next year. To
maintain this rate, what does the company have to achieve in the second
year? That would be $169 million in sales. What about in ten years?
539
Chapter 1: An Investor’s Guide to Value Investing
Book VII
Value
Investing

You see the formula coming together. FV = PV × (1 + i)(n-1). (It’s [n-1] because
we’re talking about growth after the first year.) Only this time you don’t calcu-
late the future value of an investment. You calculate the future value of sales
required to sustain a 30 percent growth bragging right. So for our example,
Future sales in 10 years = $100M × (1 + 0.30)9
Or $1.06 billion
In 20 years, that becomes $14.6 billion, with an average incremental growth
of $764 million annually and about $4.4 billion in the twentieth year.
If you’re the sales manager assigned the glorious task of meeting shareholder
expectations for growth, where can you find the incremental sales? Your com-
pany has conquered the world, but Earth is a small planet. Extraterrestrial
markets are still pre-emergent. So what happens? Growth rates likely start to
decline. Maintaining the growth rate requires greater and greater chunks of
incremental dollars, which becomes increasingly difficult as markets become
saturated.
Smart value investors recognize the increasing difficulty in maintaining high
growth rates, so they project lower rates in years further out.
Over the years, there has been a noticeable trend toward diminished growth
when a company hits the $20 billion, and then again the $40 billion, sales mark.
Companies with $20 billion in sales and 20 percent growth rates suddenly see
growth rates fall off the table and must buy growth through potentially harmful
acquisitions. Why? Markets become saturated, and large incremental sales in
core businesses become more difficult to find. Additionally, these companies,
because of their sheer size, have more difficulty organizing themselves to exe-
cute dynamic and aggressive sales plans. The lesson: Conservative or even zero
growth estimates are in order, especially beyond the five- to ten-year horizon.

alue investors need to know about the companies they invest in.
Fortunately, an enormous amount of financial information about companies
is available and easy to find. Unfortunately for most of us, it’s too much
information. The challenge is to acquire the right information about a company
and then to convert it into actionable investing knowledge. This knowledge
reveals the true character and dynamics of a business, the intrinsic value, the
business performance characteristics that conclusively indicate whether you’d
want to own a company — which in turn may suggest that it’s a good place to
invest.
Most of the information public companies disclose is too complex and detailed
to make much sense to the common reader, who may be unaware of what’s
important and may even be misled. Although the situation was worse prior to
the 2001 Enron and WorldCom scandals, it is still possible to present legally
correct information in ways so that the true meaning isn’t necessarily obvious
to the investor.
The goal of this chapter is to provide a guide for separating the wheat from
the chaff. It starts with a basic overview of financial statements and moves
forward into the balance sheet, earnings statement, and cash flow statement.
You’ll see some tricks of the trade and creative accounting practices that can
and do deceive the inattentive investor from time to time.

What a Value Investor Looks For
Investing combines art and science. Quantifiable and unquantifiable facts are
put into the pot, and the resulting stew is interpreted according to taste. The
“science” part is using numbers, facts, and formulas to measure business
value. The “art” part is taking all the facts and measurements together and
weighing them according to intuition and experience to judge a most likely
outcome or set of outcomes.
Facts and more facts
All value investors need facts about a company’s financial and operating
performance. These facts provide the foundation for value analysis and are
available from the company itself as financial statements or from one of many
information sources that repackage company-provided data for investor use:
 Financial results: Financial statements provide a picture of company
assets, liabilities, earnings, and growth. The balance sheet presents a
snapshot of assets, liabilities, and net worth. The income statement shows
revenues, expenses, and earnings for a defined period of time. The state-
ment of cash flows follows the income statement, showing where cash is
obtained and used in the business. Each of these documents is examined
in detail in later sections of this chapter.
 Financial trends: It is helpful to capture and measure change as it occurs
over time. Good trend data, and especially good trend analysis, is hard to
come by. Many financial sources, including company reports, show only
the past two, maybe three years of performance. Not bad, but seeing where
a company has been for the last five, ten, or more years is really helpful.
For example, if profits or profit margins have grown steadily over the last
three years, that’s nice to know. But it says more if that trend is solid over
the past ten or more years.
 Ratios: From raw financial data, the value investor can construct ratios —
relationships between facts that offer clues to financial safety, quality,
profitability, and efficiency, thus providing a clearer picture of company
value. We explain more about ratios in Chapter 3.
 Percentages: Like ratios, percentages relate facts to other facts and help
paint a clearer picture of company performance and normalize data for
comparison. Examples include return on equity (ROE), return on assets
(ROA), and gross and net profit margin. ROE, ROA, and margins are
explored in depth in Chapter 4.

Book VII: Value Investing 

 Marketplace facts: Financial facts represent past business results pro-
duced by a business, while marketplace facts can often be a leading indi-
cator of future financial results. So it’s important to understand metrics
like market share, customer base, or unit sales growth wherever possible.
Unfortunately, companies aren’t required to report such facts and often
choose not to do so for competitive reasons. You have to rely on what a
company does disclose and on market analysis done by third parties.
 Operating facts: Certain kinds of operational facts or metrics can also
be used as a measure of comparing companies or to support financial
analysis. It’s interesting to know the number of employees, stores,
plants, or square feet as measures of size of operations. From there, you
can determine productivity or efficiency — how much revenue, profit, and
so on is produced per unit of operational activity. Hence, some people
call these unit measures.
Sources of facts
Seasoned investors find the right sources for the right information at the
right time at the right cost, and use those sources consistently.
Annual and quarterly reports
Most U.S. companies are required by law to provide annual and quarterly
financial summaries for their investors and the financial community. There
are two kinds of annual reports. One is a consumer-friendly version with pic-
tures and descriptions of the company business with the appropriate finan-
cial facts included, usually in the back half of the report. The other is the 10-K
annual report, submitted according to guidelines set by the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC). This report is more detailed overall, with more
supporting financial facts and an analysis of the company business, including
key marketing and operating facts. See the upcoming section “Dissecting the
Annual Report” for more information.
Quarterly reports, also required, summarize the most recent business activ-
ity and major changes during the quarter. The 10-Q version has more detail
and is cast to SEC standards.
Financial portals
Financial portals like Yahoo!Finance (http://finance.yahoo.com) assemble
vast amounts of company and performance information, including business
descriptions; financial summaries; news items; and some comparative analy-
sis, performance analysis, and screening tools. Portals provide a great quick
overview or update, usually with links to more detailed information.

Broker sites
Most broker Web sites enable some investing analysis. The quality and ease
of use of their tools varies, and in many cases you have to have an account to
get the good stuff like professional analysis or stock screeners.
Research services
Dozens of companies are set up to provide data and analysis to investors;
however, many aim at providing these products to professional investors, not
you. Companies like S&P and Hoover’s offer huge packages of investment
information, but the issue is cost, which can run into the thousands.
At this point, Value Line (www.valueline.com) is the one research service
aimed at individual investors providing a complete package of value-oriented
facts and analysis. Value Line provides basic company facts but smartly nar-
rows it to what’s needed to appraise the business. The Value Line Investment
Survey costs $598 per year for the printed version and $538 for the online
version. There are smaller, more focused products available, too — for small
cap stocks, convertible securities, and other more specialized analysis. Trial
versions are available for a small charge. Many libraries and brokerage firms
with physical offices still carry the printed Value Line Investment Survey on
their shelves. You may want to try this path before committing your dollars.
The soft stuff
In addition to financial information, value investors want to get a sense of a
company’s management effectiveness and market position. To understand a
company’s products and markets, you can look at Web sites; advertising and
marketing campaigns; the company’s own description of its products; and
what you see, hear, and experience on the street.
You can gauge management effectiveness by looking at a company’s financials
and financial ratios, previous marketplace and financial decisions, business
execution, acquisitions and mergers, public statements, and other “track record”
items. Many value investors look at management ownership of company stock
as a signal of management commitment. Market position refers to a company’s
approach to the marketplace and the resulting success — or failure — of 
that approach. We take a closer look at these intangibles in Chapter 4.
544
Book VII: Value Investing 

Sources of soft stuff
The list of “soft stuff” sources is almost endless. Among the many sources are
the following:
 Financial and investing Web sites: Financial portal Yahoo!Finance will
point to information about a company posted in various corners of the
Internet. MarketWatch (www.marketwatch.com) and TheStreet.com
(www.thestreet.com) offer general news and journalistic commentary
about companies across the board, while Morningstar (www.morning
star.com) and The Motley Fool (www.fool.com) provide more thorough
analysis generally from a value perspective.
 Business journals: Standbys like The Wall Street Journal and Business
Week still offer timely and high quality appraisal of companies, often
with a value slant. Trouble is, they write about the companies they choose,
not what you want to read about at a given moment. You’ll find a few
nuggets occasionally in Kiplinger’s, Smart Money, and Money magazines.
 Trade journals: Various journals and Web sites are available to follow
everything from the restaurant industry to military electronics. Sometimes
industry-specific Web sites can offer lots of comparative factual information
to go with the soft stuff.
 Company conference calls: You can learn a lot about the character of
management and the markets a company operates in by listening to
investor conference calls, usually held at the time of quarterly earnings
releases.
 On the street: Particularly with consumer-focused companies, you can
learn a lot about how a company markets its products, how well they are
selling, and even how employees feel about the company and its business
by simply watching it do business.
Dissecting Financial Statements
A company’s financial reports serve a critical function: to reflect the economic
reality of a company and its business.
Accounting and accountants are supposed to project a fair, unbiased view of
company performance. Accountants build financial reports according to
accepted practices in the field, which dictate such principles as substance
over form, conservatism, and materiality. But despite (and maybe because
of) the fact that no fewer than three governing bodies decree accounting and
545
Chapter 2: A Value Investor’s Guide to Financial Statements
Book VII
Value
Investing

reporting practices, a degree of latitude and flexibility exists in how reporting
is actually done. This flexibility exists mostly in the valuation of assets and
the determination of revenue and cost. We cover these issues in the following
sections.
Value investors need to be smart about what and how much to question in a
financial report. The smart value investor knows what to look for in a state-
ment and what levers a company’s management can throw to convey a cer-
tain image. It’s okay to be a skeptic, but it’s probably not productive to
dispute every figure in the report. As with so much else in life, focus on
what’s important.
Poring over the Annual Report
Most companies still publish fancy, glossy annual reports. They contain basic
financial information, but beyond that, they’ve become more of a marketing
brochure. Value investors are better served by looking at what’s known as a
Form 10-K annual report, which is the SEC’s required version of the docu-
ment. The 10-K is a longer, harder read, but it provides much more in-depth
financial data, product and market data, and management discussion of the
financials than does the standard annual report. The patience required is
rewarded by a more in-depth understanding of the company. The best way to
get 10-Ks reliably and quickly is to go to a company’s “investor relations” Web
site, but the SEC also has a Web site to make the required filings public:
Electronic Data Gathering And Reporting (EDGAR). EDGAR Online can be
found at http://sec.gov/edgar.shtml.
Most annual reports contain the elements that follow. From one company to
the next, these elements won’t look the same, be the same size, be in the
same order, or contain the same information. But these pieces will likely be
present in some form.
Highlights
The highlights section is usually a one-page graphic summary of significant
financial results: sales, earnings, and a few productivity measures key to a
company’s industry. Four or five years of history are often included.
Highlights are useful for a first glance, but there’s usually more to the story.
Letter to shareholders
The letter to shareholders presents a chipper one- or two-page summary,
usually from the CEO, describing the past year and the year ahead. Although
546
Book VII: Value Investing 

some managers are frank in describing and confronting a company’s difficul-
ties, others are not. You may see a discussion of milestones and achieve-
ments without a lot of discussion of whether they were worthwhile. The
letter may include something about new customers, new technologies, and
employment practices. Investors look for clear language without panacean
jargon or buzzwords, and many look for willingness to discuss bad stuff in
these letters — a sign of management honesty and integrity.
Business summary
This objectively worded section covers the business, its products, markets,
competition, and factors like seasonality, patents, and international exposure
that may affect the business. That’s usually followed by a summary of the
management team, which is in turn followed by a fairly detailed discussion of
potential risks to the business. The business summary section is one of the
best ways for an investor to gain business understanding.
Management’s discussion and analysis
From there, we move into the financials themselves, which usually begin with
a management discussion and analysis of the financials. The discussion
covers specific financial statement components, including sales, costs,
expenses, assets, liabilities, liquidity, and perhaps market expansion risks.
The statements
The financial statement section usually consumes the last half to two-thirds
of an annual report. Several versions of consolidated financial data are pre-
sented. Financials invariably include a balance sheet, income statement, and
statement of cash flows:
 The balance sheet captures a company’s financial position at a point in
time. It shows all assets, liabilities, and owners’ equity, usually in clearly
defined subsections. The balance sheet is often called a statement of
financial position or statement of financial condition.
 The income statement (also called the earnings statement) captures a
company’s performance over an interval of time. Of interest here are the
sales or revenues, cost of those sales, other expenses, and the difference
between sales and costs — earnings. This statement is sometimes called
the statement of operations or statement of operating activity.
547
Chapter 2: A Value Investor’s Guide to Financial Statements
Book VII
Value
Investing

 The statement of cash flows also captures company activity and perfor-
mance over a time interval, but this time it’s done in cash terms. As you
see in the later section “Understanding the Earnings Statement,” cash
and accounting flows can be different. The difference is usually timing.
Cash flows are just as the name implies — cash or checks coming in,
cash or checks being paid out. Cash flows tell you a lot about company
liquidity — which refers to the presence or absence of enough cash to
operate and the quality of earnings — and whether the earnings are real
or a result of accounting gimmicks.
Most reports also include a statement of shareholders’ equity, a statement of
working capital, or some other summary of changes in the financials.
Common size statements
In addition to normal financial statements, some annual reports provide a set
of common size statements. Common size statements are standard financial
reports with all information presented as percentages. Thus, cash or
accounts receivable are presented as a percent of total assets, and the cost of
goods sold and marketing expenses are presented as a percent of revenue.
Common size statements are useful for comparing companies.
Notes
Ironically, the notes part of an annual report may take more room and con-
tain more detail than the financial statements themselves. Notes can give a
lot of important detail or “color” to support the statements.
Notes also show the accounting practice a company uses in preparing a
statement. A company’s description of depreciation methods, option
accounting, pension funding, and the like can make a big difference in inter-
preting the statements. Notes also disclose one-time situations such as acqui-
sitions, discontinued businesses, and asset write-downs — or changes in
accounting methods.
Auditor’s review
The auditor’s review is normally a one-page boilerplate somewhere toward
the back of the annual report. This element looks pretty much the same in
every annual report. The purpose of the auditor’s review is to provide con-
crete evidence of review and acceptance of a company’s accounting and
548
Book VII: Value Investing 

financial practices. What is important is identifying exceptions. The standard
auditor’s review is three paragraphs. If the words “qualified” or “adverse”
creep into the third paragraph, or if there’s a fourth paragraph, watch out.
Reading the Balance Sheet
A balance sheet is a listing of assets against the liabilities and equity that
fund those assets, taken at a specific point in time. For investment and legal
reporting purposes, these snapshots are generally taken at the end of each
fiscal quarter and at fiscal year-end.
A core financial equation forms the heart of the balance sheet:
Assets = liabilities + owners’ equity
A balance sheet must balance: For every asset dollar, there must be con-
tributed dollars produced by borrowing (increased liabilities) or additional
funding by the owners (owners’ equity) to match.
The balance sheet can be a powerful indicator of business health. But keep in
mind that it doesn’t tell much about the future of the business or about
future income. It tells you more about where the company has been and how
well it did getting there. On a balance sheet, value investors and business
analysts look for the following:
 The composition of assets, liabilities, and owners’ equity (lots of inventory
and little cash can be a bad sign)
 Trends (increasing debt and decreasing owner’s equity — also bad)
 Quality (do stated values reflect actual values?)
Each of these examinations is done with an eye toward what the figure probably
should be for a company in that line of business. A company like Starbucks,
with frequent small cash sales, shouldn’t have a large accounts receivable
balance. A retailer should have sizeable inventories, but they shouldn’t be
out of line for the industry or category. A semiconductor manufacturer has a
large capital equipment base but should depreciate it aggressively to account
for technology change.
To determine whether balance sheet numbers are in line, most analysts apply
specifically defined ratios to the numbers. Ratios serve to draw comparisons
among companies and their industry. By doing so, they show whether perfor-
mance is better or worse than industry peers. See Chapter 3 for a discussion
of ratio analysis.

A swift kick in the asset
An asset is anything a company uses to conduct its business toward producing
a profit. From an accounting standpoint, an asset must
 Have value toward producing a return for the business.
 Be in the company’s control. (A leased airplane is still an asset even if
it’s not legally “owned” by the company.)
 Be recordable and have value. (Employees don’t show up as a balance
sheet asset, though they’re frequently referred to as assets by their CEOs.)
Most companies classify assets as current or noncurrent:
 Current assets: Current assets are short-term items generally held for a
year or a business cycle. Think of current assets (especially cash) as the
lifeblood of the business flowing to and from customers, to and from
suppliers, and around to the different locations in the business operation
to produce the greatest possible business and customer benefit. Current
assets are managed by the business pretty much on a daily basis and nor-
mally include things like cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable,
and inventory.
 Noncurrent assets: These include longer-term fixed assets and a catch-
all of other types of assets not normally vital to day-to-day operations.
The following sections explore these different assets in more detail.
To assign value to assets, look at three defining characteristics of any asset:
size, trend, and quality. Table 2-1 is useful as a simple reference to convert
reported asset values to liquidating value, a conservative base for intrinsic
valuation. Professionals may use evolved versions, but this table is still a
handy tool.

Cash and cash equivalents
For most businesses, cash is the best type of asset to have. There’s no question
about its value: Cash is cash! Cash equivalents, which are short-term marketable
securities with little to no price risk, can be converted to cash at a moment’s
notice and are, for balance sheet purposes, essentially cash.
Value investors like cash. Cash is security and forms the strongest part of the
safety net that value investors seek. Value investors question a cash balance
only if it appears excessive against the needs of the business. If a value
investor sees an excess in cash, she’d be likely to ask “why?” Could the
company not put that cash to better work elsewhere? Why isn’t it being
returned to shareholders? Most companies don’t retain that much cash, 
but if they do, it becomes a red flag.
Look at the total picture when you see a company report a high cash balance.
There may be a good reason: Many companies have large cash balances for a
while immediately following an initial public offering (IPO), for example.
Accounts receivable
Accounts receivable represent funds owed to the business, presumably for
products delivered or services performed. As individuals, everyone likes to
be owed money — until we’re owed too much money. The same principle
applies to businesses.
You should be aware of situations in which companies aren’t collecting on
their bills or are using accounts receivable to create credit incentives for oth-
erwise questionable customers to buy their product. To assign value to
accounts receivable, pay attention to the following:
 The size of accounts receivable relative to sales and other assets: Is a
company extending itself too much to sustain or grow the business?
Ratios (see Chapter 3) help measure this, and industry comparisons and
common sense dictate the answer.
551
Chapter 2: A Value Investor’s Guide to Financial Statements
Book VII
Value
Investing

 Trend: Is the company continuously owed more and more, with potentially
greater and greater exposure to nonpayment? Look at historical
accounts receivable and compare them to sales.
 Quality of accounts receivable: Typically, most companies collect on
more than 95 percent of their accounts receivable balances, and thus
they’re almost as good as cash. But if accounts receivable balances
grow, and particularly if large reserves show up on the income statement
(“allowance for doubtful accounts” or similar), this is a red flare not to
be missed.
Accounts receivable are driven by the type of business that a company
operates in. A small-sale retailer like Starbucks or a grocer operates mostly
on cash. Most companies that sell directly to consumers have little to no
accounts receivable. Contrast this to companies that sell to other companies
or to distributors or retailers in the supply food chain, where most of the
business is done on account, meaning that goods or services are delivered and
invoices are then cut and sent. The billing process creates an account receivable,
which goes away only when the customer pays the bill. So suppliers to other
businesses or through distribution and sales channels often have significant
accounts receivable.
Inventory
Inventory is all valued material procured by a business and resold, with or
without value added, to a customer. Retail inventory consists of goods bought,
warehoused, and sold through stores. Manufacturing inventory consists of raw
material, work in process, and finished goods inventory awaiting shipment.
Companies live and die by their ability to effectively manage inventory.
For most companies, the key to successfully managing inventory is to match
it as closely as possible to sales. The faster that procured inventory can be
processed and sold, the better. More sales are generated per dollar tied up in
inventory. Dollars tied up in inventory cost money because they could be
invested elsewhere in the business.
Measuring inventory
Measuring the size of inventory assets is often done by measuring turnover.
Turnover is simply annual sales divided by the dollar amount of the asset on
the books. If sales are $500 million a year and inventory on the books is $100
million, inventory turnover is five times a year. Another way to look at it: The
average item of inventory is on the books for about 2.4 months (12 ÷ 5). The
greater the turnover, the more efficient the utilization of that asset. Turnover
ratios naturally vary by industry. For example, Starbucks turns over inven-
tory much faster than Boeing.
Inventory carries with it a significant risk of obsolescence. Changes in
demand patterns, technology, or the nature of the product itself can cause
valued inventory to rapidly lose value.
552
Book VII: Value Investing 

Valuing inventory
Investors should keep an eye on inventory balances for economic value and
efficiency of use. Look at the size of the asset in an absolute sense and rela-
tive to the size and sales of the business. Look for trends, favorable and unfa-
vorable, in inventory balances and ratios. Look at competitors and industry
standards. Where possible, look at inventory quality and past track record
for inventory obsolescence and resulting write-offs. And then be conserva-
tive. It often makes sense to assign a value of 50 to 75 percent, sometimes
less, to inventory values appearing on a balance sheet.
Deferred taxes and other current assets
“Deferred taxes” is an item that appears frequently on balance sheets and
results from timing differences between financial reporting and tax reporting
requirements. It is essentially estimated taxes paid before a tax liability is
actually determined. For the most part, you shouldn’t worry about these
items; seldom do they comprise more than 5 percent of stated assets.
Bolted to the floor: Fixed assets
The balance sheet entry called “property, plant, and equipment” (PP&E)
refers to fixed assets — land, buildings, machinery, fixtures, office technol-
ogy, and similar items owned by the firm for productive use. Depending on
the industry, this item may have a different name. Retail stores, for example,
don’t have plants but may have distribution centers.
The key to understanding PP&E value is to understand depreciation, the
amount subtracted each year by accountants from an asset purchase price
for normal wear and tear and technological obsolescence. Depreciation can
affect underlying asset values substantially.
To appropriately value fixed assets, you need to be familiar with the two
basic types of depreciation: In straight-line depreciation an equal amount of
asset value is expensed each year until the asset value reaches zero. In accel-
erated depreciation accountants expense proportionately more in the early
years of asset life. Further changing the picture can be a company’s decision
to value at lower of cost or market value. As for other accounts, the account-
ing method is disclosed in the statements under the notes entry.
The choice of depreciation methods is important. Accelerated depreciation
results in the most conservative PP&E asset valuations. It also results in the
most conservative view of earnings and allows more room for future net earn-
ings growth, because you can assume that a greater portion of depreciation
is behind you. But some companies may deliberately prop up current earn-
ings by employing straight-line methods. Watch for companies changing over
to straight-line from accelerated methods.
553
Chapter 2: A Value Investor’s Guide to Financial Statements
Book VII
Value
Investing

Understanding the nature of a corporation’s PP&E and its depreciation meth-
ods will help you assess the value of this account. Generally, value investors
assign very conservative values to PP&E (unless a lot of land is involved): 50
percent or less.
Depreciation is the leading difference between stated earnings and cash flows
and can mean the difference between survival and failure for a company
recording net income losses. Cash flow, unburdened by depreciation, may
still be positive. But look out. Cash consumed to keep a losing business afloat
may not be available the next time a key piece of equipment needs to be
replaced. Reporting methods that downplay depreciation or ignore it alto-
gether, such as pro forma or EBITDA reporting, indicate trouble. For more on
this issue, see “The Games Companies Play” later in this chapter.
Investments: Companies are investors, too
Besides more liquid marketable securities, many companies commit surplus
cash to more substantial long-term investments. These investments can
serve many purposes: to achieve returns as any other investor would, to par-
ticipate in the growth of a related or unrelated industry, or to eventually
obtain control of the company. Favorable tax treatment of dividends and
gains makes investing in other companies still more attractive.
There are many ways to value investments, boiling down basically to histori-
cal cost or market valuation (sometimes referred to as mark-to-market valua-
tion). Market valuation is obviously better. Investment value is disclosed in
the 10-K, but you need to read carefully to find the information. Watch out for
declining fair values and particularly for large gross unrealized losses —
future write-offs and asset value impairment loom large.
Gauge the size of investments on the balance sheet, look for detail, and
understand management’s intent in making the investments.
Intangibles: Soft assets
Intangibles, also called “soft” assets, don’t have a physical presence but are
critical in acquiring and maintaining sales and producing a competitive edge.
Soft assets include patents, copyrights, franchises, brand names, and trade-
marks. Also included is the all-encompassing “goodwill” often acquired by
acquiring other companies. Placing a financial value on these ethereal mar-
keting assets is difficult, but accountants must and do. If there is an historical
cost, accountants may carry the intangible at that cost. This is often the case
with goodwill from company acquisitions.
The key to assessing intangible assets is to understand (1) their carrying
value and (2) their composition. Most important, you must understand the
source of goodwill — from acquisitions, from patents, or what?
554
Book VII: Value Investing 

Intangibles are subject to a great deal of discretion in their accounting, and their
sources and form can be numerous and highly variable from one company to
the next. Especially problematic are companies with aggressive acquisition
strategies. These can be a value investor’s nightmare, particularly where large
amounts of goodwill and other intangibles are involved. Cast a skeptical eye on
large goodwill accounts in particular.
While the classical school of value investing considered intangibles fluff and
suggested deducting intangibles from company valuation altogether, today,
intellectual capital and brand equity are part of a company’s value and cannot
simply be ignored. In fact, for some companies, these intangibles may represent
their greatest value. What is the value of the Coca-Cola Company without the
Coke recipe and brand name? Or the value of Microsoft without its lock on PC
operating systems? Such brands and locks often ultimately produce the best
profit streams and best value.
Does the company owe money?
Liabilities are fairly straightforward: If you owe, you owe. Although different
things can be done to state asset values differently, the same doesn’t happen
with liabilities. The effect of liabilities on a company’s intrinsic value is
straightforward.
Like assets, liabilities come in two basic flavors: current and long-term.
Current liabilities are liabilities for which payment is due normally in less
than a year. Long-term liabilities are long-term debts.
Excessive use of debt signals potential danger if things don’t turn out the way
a company expects them to. Value investors don’t like surprises, and a com-
pany with uncertain prospects and a lot of debt may not make it on to their
list. Industry standards and common sense apply to debt-to-equity ratios.
Payables: Current liabilities
Almost every corporation has payables, money owed to others for products
purchased or services rendered. The liability is created when the service or
product arrives; a cash payment follows to discharge the liability. Nearly all
companies maintain a regular balance of current accounts payable, interest
payable, and the like. If payment is received in advance, as with a deposit, the
unearned portion is tracked as a liability. Sometimes contingent liabilities may
be recorded, as in warranty claims expected to be paid but not yet actualized.
Value investors don’t need to take much note of current liabilities other than
perhaps to spot large changes or trends. Investors should also realize that
current liabilities aren’t necessarily a bad thing and can result in higher effec-
tive returns on ownership capital with relatively low cost and risk.
555
Chapter 2: A Value Investor’s Guide to Financial Statements
Book VII
Value
Investing

Long-term liabilities
Long-term corporate liabilities represent contracted commitments to pay
back a sum of money over time with interest. As with short-term liabilities,
you don’t need to look too closely at the quality of these long-term liabilities,
or even the amount if reasonable by previous company or industry standards.
Trends can be important, however. Increased reliance on long-term debt may
be a sign of trouble. The company may not be making ends meet and may be
having trouble raising capital from existing or potential owners — never a good
sign. In addition, a company constantly changing, restructuring, or otherwise
tinkering with long-term debt may be sending tacit trouble signals. The com-
pany may be seeking concessions from lenders behind the scenes. In any event,
attention paid to this kind of activity diverts attention from the core business,
which is not a good thing and a warning flag for value investors.
Understanding the Earnings Statement
Earnings are the driving force and macro indicator of a company’s success.
Used by investors of all kinds, earnings statements are among the most
widely examined of company publications. Investors look at the top line (rev-
enue or sales) and the bottom line. For value investors, earnings statements
are indispensable, and most will take a much more in-depth look at the
underlying numbers, trends, and history. The following list highlights impor-
tant attributes to look for in an earnings statement:
 Growth: The long-term growth of a stock price is driven by growth in
the business. The value investor works to obtain a deep understanding
of business growth, growth trends, and the quality of growth. Is reported
growth based on internal core competencies? Or is it acquired or specu-
lative growth based on unproven ventures? The value investor assesses
growth and growth patterns, judges the validity of growth reported, and
attempts to project the future.
 Consistency: Long-term growth should be sustainable and consistent.
Look for sustained growth across business cycles. Long, consistent,
successful earnings track records get the A grades. A big pop in earnings
one year followed by malaise for the next two does not paint a pretty
picture. Consistency in sales and sales growth, profit margins and margin
growth, operating expense and expense trends is highly prized. The less
consistency, the more difficult to predict the future five or ten years and
beyond, and the less attractive a company looks to value investors.
 Comparative components and trends: Value investors look at individual

market position, for example. Value investors also constantly compare
companies in like industries. Gross margins of competing computer
manufacturers, for instance, tell a lot about who has the best market
position, production and delivery process, and business model.
As you examine earnings statements, remember that they’re not always
broken down the same way. Although the bottom line is the bottom line, the
intermediate steps may be different. One company’s operating earnings may
include marketing costs, while another’s may not. In addition, two companies
that appear (and even are classified) in the same industry may have differ-
ences large enough to raise caution. Commercial and industrial suppliers,
such as Honeywell, have consumer divisions, for example, while consumer
businesses, such as Procter & Gamble, have industrial divisions. The upshot:
You must understand businesses before comparing them.
The bottom line and other lines
You hear a lot about the bottom line, which refers to the net earnings or
income after all expenses, taxes, and extraordinary items are factored in. The
bottom line is the final net measure of all business activity.
Other important lines in the earnings statement reveal key factors and trends
in the business. You’ll see these lines or items in various forms on financial
statements depending on the statement and sometimes the industry.
There are many ways to measure income. Each reveals an important layer of
business performance, both for determining intrinsic value and also for
comparing companies. Among them are
 Gross profit: This is simply the sales less the direct cost of producing
the company’s product or service. Direct cost includes labor, material,
and expenses directly attributable to producing it. Gross profit, often
called gross margin, is the purest indicator of business profitability. Value
investors closely watch gross margin trends as an indicator of market
dominance, price control, and future profitability.
 Operating profit: Operating profit, often referred to as operating income,
is gross profit less period expenses — overhead or marketing costs not
directly attributable to product production. Operating profit gives a
more complete picture of how the business is performing on a day-to-
day basis. Period expenses typically include selling, general, and admin-
istrative expenses (SG&A), and amortization. Typically excluded are
financing costs, such as interest and taxes, as well as items deemed as
extraordinary.
 Net income: This represents the net result of all revenues, expenses,
interest, and taxes.

There are other supplemental earnings measures such as free cash flow,
discussed later in this chapter. The following sections explore the key 
components of an earnings statement.
The top line
Sales or revenues make up the top line of any business. Sales and revenues
represent accounting dollars generated for business products sold or services
performed. (Remember, with accrual accounting it doesn’t matter whether the
company has been paid yet.) With “b-to-b” businesses or those selling into a
distribution channel (a wholesaler or retailer), revenue recognition can be more
complex.
Accounting revenue is normally recorded at the time of sale or service com-
pletion. But there are situations in which the delivery process isn’t complete,
and that may call revenue validity into question. If a distributor doesn’t have
to pay until a product is resold, or if the manufacturer is still required to per-
form significant services, such as configuration, installation, or even war-
ranty work, a sale to a distributor or customer may be exaggerated if fully
recorded as a sale. Similarly, sales to subsidiaries or affiliated companies
shouldn’t be considered sales. Sales for consideration other than money,
such as advertising exposure, may also be suspect.
But for the most part, sales are sales. In many businesses, such as transportation
or utilities, they may be called revenues, but it’s the same thing. Occasionally you
will see an allowance for returns broken out; if not, you can usually safely assume
that they’re included in the sales figure as a negative amount.
When comparing sales figures or projecting trends, compare apples to
apples. If there is a significant acquisition, divestiture, or extraordinary
change in the business, make sure to take it into account.
Cost of goods sold
Cost of goods sold, or CGS, is the cost of acquiring goods and raw material
plus labor and direct overhead expended to add value for sale, and it’s an
important driver of business success. For all but a few companies with high
intellectual property or service content, CGS is the largest piece of the rev-
enue pie. CGS varies widely by industry and industry cost structure. For
example, the physical CGS of Microsoft is tiny with respect to revenue,
whereas a grocery store or discount retailer may see CGS in the 70 or 80 per-
cent range. Apples-to-apples comparisons and especially trend analysis are
critical to effective business appraisal.
558
Book VII: Value Investing 

Different accounting treatments can affect CGS. LIFO (last in, first out) and
FIFO (first in, first out) are different ways of valuing balance sheet inventory
and can affect CGS. Value investors should be careful to understand which
accounting method is used before comparing companies and watch for
changes in accounting methods that may shift reporting bias. (Note 1 in the
financial statements usually clarifies accounting methods.) In a price-stable,
low-inflation environment, the LIFO/FIFO thing becomes less important.
Gross margin
Gross margin, or gross profit, is simply the sales less the cost of goods sold. It
is the basic economic output of the business before overhead, marketing, and
financing costs enter the picture. Gross profit takes on added meaning when
taken as a percentage. This percentage — and trends in the percentage —
speaks volumes for the health and direction of the business.
Operating expenses
No matter the business, any company incurs operating expenses (also called
indirect costs) — the costs of doing business that are not directly related to
producing and selling individual units of product or service. Some call it over-
head, but it goes a little beyond the traditional definition of overhead and into
marketing, R&D, and other costs necessary to sustain the business in addi-
tion to directly producing products. Standard types of operating expenses are
examined in the following sections.
Selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) costs
SG&A includes marketing and selling costs, including advertising; sales and
sales forces; marketing and promotion campaigns; and a host of other admin-
istrative and corporate expenses such as travel, Web sites, office equipment,
and so on. Many investors use SG&A as a barometer of management effective-
ness — a solid management team keeps SG&A expenses in check. SG&A can
mushroom into a vast slush fund and an internal corporate pork barrel that
can easily get out of control. As with gross margin, looking at SG&A as a per-
centage is best.

Investing

Research and development
Manufacturing and technology companies in particular need to invest in
future products. Because these investments occur long before product pro-
duction, and because many of them never pan out into saleable products,
companies are allowed to expense research and development (R&D) as a
period expense. Appropriate levels of R&D expense vary widely by industry.
For example, software companies incur very large R&D as a percent of sales,
but insurers or retailers have small R&D percentages.
Because you won’t know the detail of R&D expenditures, watch the trend and
changes in R&D as a percent of sales. Increasing R&D percentages reflect an
increasing cost of doing business and possibly ineffective R&D, while decreasing
R&D as a percent may reflect sacrificing the future for the present. Neither is a
good thing. Also note that companies without a significant R&D effort may not
report it as a separate line. In some financial statements, it’s called product
development, or it may be bundled into some other expense line.
Depreciation
Depreciation can obviously affect inventory, as explained in the earlier sec-
tion “A swift kick in the assets,” but it can also have a net effect on property,
plant, and equipment as an earnings statement item. Depreciation and amor-
tization represent the accountant’s assignment of the cost of a long-lived
asset to specific business periods. Depreciation is used when referring to
physical fixed assets, and amortization is used when referring to intangible
assets. (Some oil and natural resource investors may run into the term deple-
tion: a cost recovery for exhaustion of natural resource assets.)
Depreciation and amortization expenses are usually broken out on the earnings
statement, but they may be buried in a consolidated SG&A or other operating
expense line.
Impairments, investments, and other write-downs
When the value of an asset changes significantly in the eyes of management,
a company can elect to take a write-down recognizing the change. The write-
down shows up as a decrease in asset value on the balance sheet for the asset
category involved and as a (usually) one-time expense somewhere on the
earnings statement. The rules for when and how to take these write-downs are
somewhat flexible. The good news is that write-downs are normally reported
as a separate line and are well-documented in the notes.
Write-down behavior provides insight into management behavior and effec-
tiveness as well as overall business consistency and should not be ignored.
For value investors, knowing the detail or amount may not be as important as
knowing the pattern. Are these write-downs really one-time adjustments, for
example, or does the company continually overinvest in unproductive
technology?
560
Book VII: Value Investing 

It’s also critically important to understand write-offs and one-time charges when
building intrinsic value models (more in Chapter 4). Many intrinsic value models
base forward projections on the most recently reported net income numbers.
Most financial portals and automated investment analysis tools simply take the
latest year’s earnings figure from a database. If that figure was significantly
reduced (or enhanced) by extraordinary items, a large (and compounded!)
error in the intrinsic value assessment can occur.
Goodwill
Goodwill assets are obtained by acquiring other companies. These goodwill
assets arise when more is paid for an acquired company than it is worth in
hard assets. Acquired goodwill assets often have real value — brand equity,
customer base, and so forth — but more often than not, the amount booked
exceeds this value, and goodwill is used as a plug-in figure to account prop-
erly for the purchase.
The treatment of goodwill has changed in recent years and become more uni-
form. The deal that accountants struck with the corporate world calls for
allowing goodwill to remain on the books forever, but it subjects companies
to an annual review for impairment of the fair value of those assets.
Like depreciation and impairments, goodwill amortizations are accounting
phenomena and don’t result in a cash transaction. Goodwill amortization
affects earnings, not cash flow. Informative annual reports deconstruct
impairment analysis for you and give estimates not only for current but also
future asset impairment charges.
You can decide how you want to appraise goodwill, but conservative is usually
best. Ben Graham was particularly leery of goodwill and usually removed it
entirely from company valuation, regardless of company policy. Buffett and
other contemporary value investors recognize the value of patents, copyrights,
brand equity, customer base, and other intellectual property and allow it to
stand in valuation, so long as it’s not in excess and is accounted for realistically.
Operating income
Operating income is simply sales less cost of goods sold, less operating
expenses. Because it includes noncash amortizations, it is a fully loaded view
of operating performance in the business. If you closely observe the effects of
amortizations, special write-downs, and accounting changes, you can better
understand operating income and operating income trends.

Interest and taxes
Companies invariably have some form of interest income or interest expense —
usually both. Interest income comes primarily from cash and short-term
investments held on the balance sheet, while interest expense comes from
short- and long-term debt balances. Interest reporting is usually done as net
interest — that is, by combining interest income and expense into a net figure.
Taxes are quite complicated, just as they are for individuals, and the details
go beyond the scope of this book. There is normally an income tax provision
recorded as a single line item on the earnings statement, consisting of fed-
eral, state, and local taxes put together.
You don’t need to pay too much attention to these areas except where interest
expenses are disproportionately high and growing. In most situations value
investors treat taxes as a given, unless the company has recently been
through tough times and has a lot of write-offs to carry forward. When that
happens, taxes can be artificially low for a while; investors must take into
account when they will return to a normal level.
Income from continuing operations
What results from netting out interest and taxes from operating income is
income from continuing operations. This figure gives a good picture of company
performance, not only from an operating but also a financial perspective.
Income from continuing operations tells shareholders what their investments
are returning after everyone, including Uncle Sam and his brethren, is paid.
Income from continuing operations is a good indicator of total business perfor-
mance, but be aware of truly extraordinary events driving expenses or income.
Extraordinaries
Extraordinary items are tied to unusual and nonrecurring events. Unusual
events aren’t related to typical activities of the business, at least going forward.
Nonrecurring events aren’t expected to occur again. Extraordinary items
commonly result from business closures (“discontinued operations”); major
restatements due to changes in accounting rules, debt restructurings, or other
complex financial transactions; layoffs and other employee transactions; and
so on. Extraordinary items generally are not supposed to include asset write-
downs (such as receivables, inventory, or intangibles), foreign currency gains
or losses, or divestitures.
562
Book VII: Value Investing 

Some companies interpret the accounting rules and guidelines more strictly
than others, so watch for extraordinary expenses that aren’t so extraordi-
nary. If, for example, earnings are consistently a dollar a share each quarter
with a consistent $4 year-end write-off each year, the true value generated by
the business is closer to zero than four.
There you have it: Net income
Sales less CGS, less operating expenses, less interest and taxes, less or plus
extraordinaries give you a company’s net income, sometimes referred to as
income attributable to common shareholders or some similar phrase. Net income
represents the final net earnings result of the business on an accounting — not
necessarily a cash — basis.
Net earnings are usually divided by the number of shares outstanding to
arrive at earnings per share — the common barometer heard in nearly all
financial reports. Most analysts and investors focus on diluted earnings per
share, which figures in outstanding employee stock options and other equity
grants beyond actual shares outstanding in the share markets.
Reading Cash Flow Statements
A business needs cash to operate. A business generating positive cash flow is
much healthier than one bleeding cash and borrowing or taking cash from
investors to stay afloat. But because of noncash items, earnings statements
don’t give a complete cash picture. So value investors use the statement of
cash flows as a standard part of the financial statement package. (Note:
Sometimes the statement of cash flows is called sources and uses of funds or
something similar. Accountants use the terms “funds” and “cash” inter-
changeably.) The statement of cash flows tracks cash obtained in, or used for,
three separate kinds of business activity: operations, investing, and financing.
You’re probably wondering what the difference is between earnings and cash
flow. The answer is that the realization of accounting earnings may occur at
different times than the actual receipt of cash. The main differences arise
from accrual accounting and from depreciation and other noncash amortiza-
tions and adjustments. A dollar earned today may not be collected until
tomorrow, and a dollar earned today as cash may be diminished as earnings
563
Chapter 2: A Value Investor’s Guide to Financial Statements
Book VII
Value

by a noncash amortization of an asset. Mainly, the difference is timing —
although the time difference (especially with a long-lived fixed asset) can be
years. To summarize:
 Earnings statements measure business activity as it occurs, regardless
of cash flow, and include noncash amortization and other transactions.
 Cash flow statements specifically track the movement of cash in and out
of the company. This cash flows into and out of the “cash and
marketable securities” item on the balance sheet.
Cash flow from operations
Similar to operating income, cash flow from operations tells you what cash is
generated from, or provided by, normal business operations, and what cash
is consumed, or used in, the business. Cash flow information contains these
figures:
 Net income from continuing operations: Calculating cash flow from
operations starts with this number.
 Adjustments for depreciation and amortization: Depreciation and
amortization are accounting, not cash, transactions. So here is where
depreciation and amortization dollars are added back in — dollars that
came out of accounting income but had no corresponding cash payment.
 Changes in working capital items: Working capital items include
accounts receivable and inventory, and changes in these items either
produce or consume cash. It takes a while to get used to the logic, but a
positive number here means that the item sourced or generated cash; 
a negative item means that the item used cash. A negative figure for
inventory, for example, means that the business used cash to buy 
more inventory. A positive figure means that inventory balances were
reduced, freeing up cash for other uses. (The cash actually comes from
selling the inventory — either to a customer or some other buyer.)
 Total cash flow from operating activities: This is a very important
figure. Essentially, this is cash generated by ongoing day-to-day business
activities. Negative operating cash flow is a dismal sign.
Cash flow from investing activities
The second section of the statement of cash flow shows, among other things,
cash used for investments in the business, including capital expenditures for
plants, equipment, and other longer-term product assets.
564
Book VII: Value Investing 

While cash flow from operations should be positive, cash flow from investing
activities is often negative because growing companies need more physical
investments — property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) — to sustain growth.
It is possible (but not the norm) to generate positive cash flows in this part of
the statement, either by selling PP&E or by selling investments owned by the
company.
By comparing net cash flows from operations and net cash flows from invest-
ing activities, you can get a first glance at whether a business is productive
and healthy. If positive cash flows from operations exceed negative cash
flows from investing activities, the business produces more cash than it con-
sumes. But don’t jump to a favorable conclusion too quickly — you may be
looking at an airline that’s about to pay for five new jets in the next quarter. A
surplus cash situation must be sustained to be meaningful.
Free cash flow
Earn income, pay for costs of doing business, and what’s left over is yours to
keep as an owner. What’s left over is the free cash flow. Pretty simple. Free
cash flow is a good indication of what a company really has left over after
meeting obligations, and thus could theoretically return to shareholders. For
that reason, free cash flow is sometimes called owners’ earnings.
Cash flow from financing activities
Financing activities tell where a firm has obtained capital in the form of cash
to fund the business. Proceeds from the sale of company shares or bonds
(long-term debt) are a source of cash. If a company pays off a bond issue,
pays a dividend, or buys back its own stock, that’s a use of cash for financing.
A consistent positive cash flow from financing activities indicates excessive
dependence on credit or equity markets. Typically, this figure oscillates
between negative and positive. A big positive spike reflects a big bond issue
or stock sale. In such a case, check to see if the resulting cash is used for
investments in the business (probably okay) or to make up for a shortfall in
operating cash flow (probably not okay). If the generated cash flows straight
to the cash balance, you should wonder why a company is selling shares or
debt just to increase cash, although often the reasons are difficult to know.
Perhaps an acquisition?

The Games Companies Play
Accounting rules, while improved in recent years, still allow enough flexibility
to give companies latitude to manage their business and decide what to
recognize, and when and how. Understanding company accounting and
reporting policies — and conservative versus aggressive bias — has always
been considered a good value investing practice.
This section explores some occasional accounting practices used to make
business results look better. It’s called accounting stretch, and as a value
investor, you need to be aware of it. Sensitive stretch points occur in both
revenue and expense portions of the earnings statement, as the following sec-
tions explain.
The balance sheet is a snapshot in time that captures the cumulative effects
of business activity over a period. This business activity is measured on earn-
ings and cash flow statements. As such, the balance sheet reflects the results
of accounting policy and any stretch that may have occurred — it isn’t where
stretch is initially applied.
Revenue stretch
There are two major sources of revenue recognition problems. The first involves
timing, where revenues for long-term deals and contracts may be recognized
prematurely. The second involves customer financing or price adjustments,
where a customer receives an incentive or is otherwise enabled to buy a product
but revenue is overstated by not recognizing the downside of such incentives.
Following are some of the ways companies can manipulate revenue and rev-
enue timing:
 Contractual revenues, forward sales, service fees: Accounting principles
state that revenue can be recognized for substantial performance of
delivering a good or a service. Yet cases abound where companies,
perhaps selling a three-year forward service agreement with a product,
or perhaps an insurance policy, bundle downstream revenue into the
original sale.
 Channel stuffing: Manufacturers who distribute through retail or other
channels often fall to the temptation to sell as much as they can down-
stream into the next channel “tier.” Computer suppliers may sell tons of
equipment to their distributors, often to turn around and reverse the
sale with a return or a credit for a price drop somewhere down the line.
566
Book VII: Value Investing 

Today, some companies don’t recognize revenue until the product is sold
through — that is, sold to an end customer. Others will recognize the
revenue but with an appropriate reserve for returns. Look for companies
that specifically state this practice in their financial statement notes.
And avoid companies with large fiscal year-end revenue jumps matched
by weak subsequent quarter performance — unless seasonal factors
suggest the pattern is normal.
 Related party revenue: Some companies mishandle revenue from closely
aligned third parties — or even from sales to subsidiaries or other
“controlled” entities. Related party revenue is common in the tech
industry or other businesses with strong partner relationships or lots of
subsidiaries. Accounting and SEC rules are pretty clear about recognizing
revenue only when a transaction is done at arms’ length — that is, without
being controlled in any way by the company recognizing the revenue.
 Creating sales with financing: An increasing number of companies have
resorted to financing their customers as a way to win deals, win customers,
and bolster revenues. Although this has been common in department store
retailing for years through store credit cards, it takes on new meaning 
when, for example, billions are lent to single customers to buy telecommu-
nications equipment. These sales may turn out not to be real — for example,
if the recipient goes bankrupt. In some cases the sales may be real but are
artificially brought forward, creating gaps in subsequent periods. Look
carefully at financial statement notes for evidence of extensive financing
programs, and also look at the running accounts receivable and notes
receivable balances compared to sales.
How do you detect these issues? It isn’t easy. Pay attention to revenue
recognition policies (usually Note 1 of the statements) and unusual
increases or bumps in sales, receivables, or allowances against receivables.
Accounting clarifications and a stronger imperative toward cleaner
reporting have diminished these revenue issues somewhat, but there is
still plenty of latitude, and judging companies often becomes a matter of
understanding their business and trusting their management.
 Warranty costs: Typically, a reserve for warranty should be set aside for
every product shipped or service completed. But companies can change
the amount set aside. This item is often invisible because most companies
don’t break out warranty costs in detail.
567
Chapter 2: A Value Investor’s Guide to Financial Statements
Book VII

Inventory valuation
How inventory is managed — whether LIFO (last in, first out) or FIFO (first in,
first out) — impacts inventory valuation. LIFO typically represents the more
conservative valuation, particularly in an inflationary environment because
recognized costs are relatively higher. However, LIFO also results in relatively
lower inventory valuations.
Value investors should understand inventory valuation policy, normally dis-
closed in Note 1, particularly where an accounting policy is changing or has
been changed. If a company switches from LIFO to FIFO, watch out.
Expense stretch
Expenses, or indirect costs, are easier to stretch because there are more dif-
ferent kinds of them, and typically little detail is given on the consolidated
statements. Fortunately, this area has received considerable scrutiny, espe-
cially options and amortization expenses, so it is less of an arena for abuse
than in the past.
Options
Compensating employees with stock options became much more in vogue
toward the end of the 20th century. Why? To recruit and retain better employees
without consuming precious cash or diluting earnings. Investors got very
upset about it because not only were companies inflating earnings by not
recognizing option expenses, but many a corporate staffer was getting
fantastically wealthy on the resulting awards.
For a long time, accounting rules required only disclosure — not incorporation
into actual statements. So option grants and their theoretical expense were
noted somewhere deep in the statements, but not in the results themselves.
Finally in 2004, that changed: The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
implemented a revised Statement 123, requiring expensing and prescribing a
formula for valuing the options. So now, options can still be abused by greedy
or irresponsible management teams, but at least investors will see the results
more clearly.
R&D and marketing costs
A few companies have been caught deferring certain R&D and marketing costs
into the future by capitalizing them: recording them as an asset when incurred,
rather than an expense, and then depreciating or amortizing the asset over
future years. Accounting rules are fairly firm, but not rock solid, around 
the notion that most R&D expenses should be incurred as they arise due to the
568
Book VII: Value Investing 

uncertain nature of their outcome. There’s no way to tell upfront whether an
R&D effort will turn into a marketable product. However, where R&D is significant
as a proportion of total product expense, as with software, portions are allowed
to be capitalized.
Depreciation and amortization
Choice of depreciation and amortization methods — and time periods — can
influence earnings and balance sheet statements. More aggressive depreciation
results in lower earnings and conservative asset valuations, but the pressure
to “meet the numbers” on earnings may lead to less aggressive depreciation.
Firms have the choice of method (straight line versus accelerated) and time
frame (number of years) to manage their financial reporting.
Depreciation and amortization methods are among the most clearly disclosed
of financial statement “levers.” Note 1 disclosures are complete with both
method and time period, although frequently a mix of different methods and-
time periods is used for different assets. Look for how hard assets are
depreciated and how goodwill is amortized.
The value investor should look for conservatism, consistency (as opposed to
frequent changes), and common sense. (Wireless licenses amortized over 40
years probably doesn’t make sense because the technology probably won’t be
around for that long.) If a company suddenly switches to longer depreciation
schedules without adequate explanation, look out.
Pension costs and assets
Pension fund accounting can be another source of stretch earnings in a pinch.
Suppose that a plan is targeted to reach a certain funding level in ten years.
Management has diligently set money aside with an assumption of a 7 percent
return in order to achieve that long-term goal. Now suppose that management
decides that an 8 percent return is more likely. Because the existing balance is
bigger than it needs to be to meet the obligation, the plan is said to be over-
funded. Some or all of that overfunding can be recognized as income, inflating
reported earnings. Large old-line companies — the IBMs and AT&Ts of the world —
are more susceptible to pension stretch than newer companies, which use the
401(k) approach, where the company directly carries few or no pension assets.
Pension information is usually deep in the Notes section. Check the fair value
of pension assets, the projected benefit obligation, and the difference between
the two. Look at the assumptions, and look for changes in accounting policy,
especially those not mandated by accounting standards bulletins.

Write-offs: Big baths
Write-offs come from the old school of accounting gimmicks. Bundling large
costs into extraordinary write-offs clears the books of bad assets and bad
decisions in order to increase earnings in the immediate future. Generally
accepted accounting principles (GAAP) are fairly specific in indicating that
write-offs must be unusual and nonrecurring, but these terms are subject to
interpretation. Are layoffs, plant closings, and restructurings unusual and
nonrecurring? Depends on the company. They’re almost annual events for
automakers and other smokestack industries.
Be aware of the reasons for and any regularities in such write-offs. Have they
gotten to be a habit? Are they actually a cost of doing business in disguise?

A
s you gaze through the myriad numbers in financial statements, pretty
soon eye and brain fatigue set in. After all, what do the numbers tell you?
How do you take away any meaning from them — and quickly, because you
don’t have all day to address every number for every business you look at?
Are accounts receivable in line or not? Is the company’s inventory scaled
properly to the size of the business? What about fixed assets, debt, and
profitability? Is the company using capital efficiently? And does its stock
price make sense? How do you know?
The Basics of Using Ratios
Applying ratios to the numbers is like using a lens to bring them into clearer
focus. Ratios explain the relationship between two or more numbers, thus
providing you with scale and context.
For example, one major U.S. construction products manufacturer reported
$217.6 million in inventory in 2006. That means little until measured against
its $863.1 million in sales the same year. The inventory-to-sales ratio of 0.252
puts company raw data into perspective, tells a story, and provides a standard
for comparison with other companies and the industry. And it tells the trends —
favorable or unfavorable. The 2005 ratio of 0.214 suggests that the amount of
inventory required to support sales rose substantially in 2006 — not a good sign.
Inventory-to-sales is one of dozens of standard ratios. Each ratio by itself
provides a clue into some facet of business performance. Taken together as a
collection, ratios provide a clearer total picture of a company for the investor
to interpret.

Book VII: Value Investing 
Identifying ratio resources
A great deal of comparative industry ratio data is available to professional
financial and credit analysts, but they pay hefty subscription fees to get it.
The challenge is finding that information for free (or nearly so). Here are
some sources of ratio data and comparison:
 Free: Yahoo!Finance and similar investing portals provide some ratios
and limited comparison tools. The Yahoo!Finance “Key Statistics” page
shows several ratios, mainly valuation ratios.
 For a modest fee: At the time of this writing, there is still little available
for the ratio-hungry investor to buy. One source is VentureLine (www
.ventureline.com), where, for $9.95, you can purchase a fairly
complete rundown for a particular industry, like “electronic computers.”
This product provides five years’ worth of data, making trend analysis
practical. While $9.95 per industry can add up if you invest in a lot of
industries, this tool is worth considering if you’re doing a lot of ratio
analysis.
 More expensive: Value Line Investment Survey (www.valueline.com)
offers a window to many key ratios. Value Line doesn’t present a lot of
ratios but does give a lot of history, which can be better. The standard
Value Line Investment Survey subscription costs $595 per year but
offers a lot beyond ratio analysis.
If you have access to Dun & Bradstreet or Standard & Poor’s industry financial
comparisons, don’t hesitate to use these rich, complete, and up-to-date
resources. They may be out of reach of the average investor due to cost. If
you work with a broker or financial adviser, you may get access to some of
these services for free.

 Intrinsic meaning: What does the ratio tell you? If the debt-to-equity ratio
is 3 to 1, the company has a lot of debt. If the inventory-to-sales ratio is
greater than 1, the company turns its inventory less than once per year.
A price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 50 implies a 2 percent return on invested
capital ($1 returned per $50 invested). These numbers tell you something
without looking at any comparisons or trends.
 Comparisons: For many analysts (especially credit analysts) trying to
get a picture of a company’s health, comparative analysis is the most
important use of ratios. A ratio acquires more meaning when it’s
compared to direct competitors, the company’s industry, or much

broader standards, like the S&P 500. A profitability measure, such as
gross profit margin, reported at 25 percent tells more when direct com-
petitors are at 35 percent plus. Analysts make similar comparisons with
asset utilization, financial strength, and valuation ratios.
 Consistency: The hallmark of good management, as well as of an attractive
long-term investment, is the consistency of results delivered. If profit
margins are consistent and changing at a consistent rate, the company is
predictable — and most likely in control of its markets. Inconsistent
ratios reflect on inconsistent management, competitive struggles, and
cyclical industries, all of which diminish a company’s intrinsic value.
 Trends: Better than consistency alone is consistency with a favorable
trend. Growing profit margins, return on equity, asset utilization, and
financial strength are all very desirable, particularly if valuation ratios
(P/E and so on) haven’t kept pace. Value investors who study trends
carefully have information that most investors don’t have.
Key Ratios, Classified and Identified
The following sections explore the different kinds of ratios and their use in
value investing. Ratios can be divided into four categories:
 Asset productivity: These ratios describe how effectively assets are
deployed. Some analysts call these efficiency or asset management ratios.
 Financial strength: These ratios measure to what extent company
resources are provided by sources other than the owners. Sometimes
called liquidity or debt management ratios, they also assess the company’s
ability to pay its creditors and how vulnerable it may be to debt
problems and high interest costs. And some financial ratios tell you
about financial or capital structure — that is, how financially leveraged 
a company may be.
 Profitability: Profitability ratios suggest how much profit or cash flow is
generated per dollar sold or dollar invested. Some analysts refer to
these ratios as management effectiveness ratios, as they indicate man-
agement’s overall success in generating returns for the enterprise.
 Valuation: The first three ratio families examine internal business funda-
mentals. With valuation, the stock price enters the picture. Valuation
ratios, as the name implies, relate a company’s stock price to its perfor-
mance. The ubiquitous price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio shows up here, as
do its siblings price-to-sales, price-to-book, and a few others.

Asset productivity ratios
Asset productivity ratios describe how effectively business assets are deployed.
They typically look at sales dollars generated per unit of resource. Resources
can include accounts receivable, inventory, fixed assets, and occasionally
other tangible assets. Similar analysis may also be done not just for financial
assets but also for operational assets like square footage, employees, number
of facilities, and airplane seat miles.
Receivables turnover
Receivables turnover measures the size of unpaid customer commitments to
a company. Specifically, it measures how many times a year this asset turns
over — that is, is cleared out and replaced by similar obligations from other
customers. Rapid turnover, not lingering old debts, is what you want to see.
Here’s the formula:
Receivables turnover = sales $ ÷ accounts receivable $
Accounts receivable is a resource at a company’s disposal like anything else
and must be paid for, essentially, by sacrificing cash that otherwise would be
available to fund some other part of the business. A company selling direct to
consumers with cash sales or bank credit card sales will have lower receiv-
ables turnover than an industrial supplier. Watch for consistency and compli-
ance with normal billing policy for the industry.
Average collection period
A slightly different way of looking at receivables is to show the average number
of days that a given receivable dollar lives on the books. To calculate, you
divide the receivables turnover ratio into 360 to put it on a daily scale:
Average collection period = 360 ÷ receivables turnover
This ratio is also sometimes called days’ sales in receivables.
If, based on industry comparisons or stated billing cycles, the collection period
is higher than it should be (or growing), watch out. The company may be losing
control of its collections or selling to customers with questionable credit.
Inventory turnover
Inventory turnover works like receivables turnover, only you plug in balance
sheet inventory in place of receivables. Here’s the formula:
Inventory turnover = sales ÷ inventory $
574
Book VII: Value Investing 

As with receivables turnover, the higher the number, the better. High numbers
indicate that raw materials, work in progress, and finished goods are flying
onto and off of shelves rapidly. Less dust collects on less stuff in fewer ware-
houses, and less cash is tied up in inventory. Also, there’s less risk of obsoles-
cence and write-offs and, in many businesses, less risk of markdowns to clear
inventory.
Fixed asset turnover
This ratio is straightforward:
Fixed asset turnover = sales $ ÷ fixed asset $
All else being equal, the company that produces the most sales or revenue
per dollar of fixed assets wins.
Total asset turnover
Again, straightforward:
Total asset turnover = sales $ ÷ total asset $
Here we get a bigger picture of asset productivity as measured by the generation
of sales. For the first time, intangible assets are included. Again, industry
norms form the benchmark. Comparing a railroad to a software company
doesn’t make sense.
Non-financial productivity ratios
Operational or capacity utilization ratios can be quite interesting yet sometimes
hard to find or apply. The raw data is often not available in company statements
or published reports. Calculated ratios are even harder to find, although Value
Line and other analysis services make it a point to present certain non-financial
operating data. These measures vary by industry, but here are some examples:
 Sales per employee: This ratio tells you how productive a company is in
regard to investments in human resources. We think it’s worth a look in
almost all industries, particularly those that are labor intensive such as
retail, transportation, and other service industries. Here’s a tip: The
Yahoo!Finance “Competitors” page shows employee counts for every
publicly traded company.
 Sales per square foot: This ratio is especially important for retail and
similar businesses where occupancy investments are large and sales can
be tied directly to them.
 Average selling price (ASP): Many financial reports don’t present the
number of units sold because they don’t have to — and they want to
keep selling prices secret. But sometimes this data is available (for
575
Chapter 3: Using Ratios as a Valuation Tool

example, from Boeing and other very-large-ticket manufacturers), and it
can be quite revealing as to the direction of a business.
 Industry specials: Airlines and airline investors pay close attention to
seat miles and revenues per seat mile flown. Railroads may look at revenue
per track mile or car mile. Other service businesses such as banks and
mail order retail may look at sales or revenue per customer.
Financial strength ratios
This set of ratios goes by many names (liquidity, solvency, financial lever-
age), but they all point to the same thing: What is a business’s financial
strength and position? What is its capital structure? A balance sheet–oriented
value investor looks closely to make sure that the company will be around
tomorrow (as many investors did in the 1930s). Value investors first look at
financial strength ratios for obvious danger, then they base intrinsic value
analysis on business-strength and market-strength measures like productivity
and profitability.
Current and quick ratios
These commonly used liquidity ratios help evaluate a company’s ability to
pay its short-term obligations. Here’s the formula:
Current ratio = current assets ÷ current liabilities
The current ratio includes all current assets, but because inventory is often
difficult to turn into cash, at least for a reasonable price, many analysts
remove it from the equation to arrive at a quick ratio. The quick ratio empha-
sizes coverage assets that can be quickly converted to cash:
Quick ratio = (current assets – inventory) ÷ current liabilities
Another ratio, cash to debt, is often used. The calculation is self-explanatory.
It takes a still more conservative view of coverage assets (cash only) and a
clearer view of what needs to be covered (total debt, current and long-term
portions).
The traditional thinking is that the higher the ratio, the better off the company.
Greater than 2:1 for the current ratio or 1:1 for the quick ratio is good and safe;
less than 2:1 or 1:1 is a sign of impending problems meeting obligations.
Debt to equity and debt to assets
Sometimes also called solvency or leverage ratios, this set measures what
portion of a firm’s resources, or assets, are provided by the owners versus
provided by others. The two most common ratios used to assess solvency
576
Book VII: Value Investing 

and leverage are debt to equity and debt to total assets. Here’s the formula for
debt to equity; note that current liabilities, such as accounts payable, typically
are not included:
Debt to equity = total debt ÷ owners’ equity
Here’s the formula for debt to assets:
Debt to total assets = total debt ÷ total assets
Making a sweeping statement about what these ratios should be for a given
company is difficult. When a company has more debt than equity (debt to
equity > 1 or debt to total assets > 0.5), yellow flags fly. But again, industry
comparisons are important. Economic value achieved should exceed the cost
and risk incurred with the debt. Sounds good in theory, but precise appraisal
can be complex. As with liquidity measures, solvency measures probably
deliver a stronger signal for what not to buy than what to buy.
Cash flow ratios
Because cash is really the lifeblood of a business, financial strength assessments
typically look at these ratios:
 Overall cash flow ratio: This powerful ratio tells whether a business is
generating enough cash from its business to sustain itself, grow, and
return capital to its owners. Here’s the formula:
Overall cash flow ratio = cash inflow from operations ÷
(investing cash outflows + financing cash outflows)
If the overall cash flow ratio is greater than 1, the company is generating
enough cash internally to cover business needs. If it’s less than 1, the
company is going to capital markets or is selling assets to keep afloat.
 Cash flow and earnings ratio: Cash flow comparisons with earnings can
be used as a quick quality test to see how non-cash accounting transac-
tions and “stretch” may have gone into a set of statements. It’s best
when cash flows march in step with, or exceed, earnings. If earnings
increase without a corresponding increase in cash flow, earnings quality
comes into question. The following is a base measure:
Cash flow to earnings = cash flow from operations ÷ net earnings
Because depreciation and other non-cash amortizations vary by industry,
it’s hard to hang a specific goal on this measure. Consistency over time
is good. Favorable industry comparisons also are good. Further, it’s
good when period-to-period earnings increases are accompanied by
corresponding cash flow increases.

Profitability ratios
Asset productivity and financial strength reflect essential business basics —
important, but neither of which alone can point you to good companies and
good investments. Profitability ratios form a core set of bottom-line ratios
crucial to all investment analysis. This section examines four profitability ratios.
Each is typically based on net earnings, but occasionally you see variations
using cash flow or operating earnings.
Typically, items related to extraordinary charges or discontinued operations
should be excluded when calculating these ratios. If you’re using figures from
a financial portal or calculations from a screener or other financial information
package, check to make sure figures exclude extraordinary items. You may
have to dig into the company’s own issued financial statements.
Return on sales
This ratio is just as it sounds:
Return on sales = net earnings ÷ sales
Return on sales (ROS) tells you how much profit a firm generated per dollar
of sales. This figure is much better known as the net profit margin. Closely
related is gross margin:
Gross margin = (sales – cost of goods sold) ÷ sales
Obviously, gross margin is a key driver of return on sales and is the most
strongly connected to the organization’s business strength and operational
effectiveness. Some analysts also look at operating margin:
Operating margin = (sales – cost of goods sold – operating expenses) ÷ sales
where SG&A (selling, general, and administrative) expenses, marketing, asset
recovery (depreciation), and special amortizations are factored in.
Return on assets
How much profit is generated per resource dollar invested? Return on assets,
or ROA, provides the answer:
Return on assets = net earnings ÷ total assets
This measure is especially important in asset-intensive industries, such as
retail, semiconductor manufacturing, and basic manufacturing. Chapter 4
takes a closer look at ROA.
578
Book VII: Value Investing 

Return on equity
Return on equity, or ROE, is one of the more important bottom-line ratios in
the value investor’s repertoire. Here’s the formula:
Return on equity = net earnings ÷ owners’ equity
ROE is the true measure of how much a company returns to its owners, the
shareholders. It is the bottom line result of other factors, including asset pro-
ductivity, financial structure, and top-line profitability. ROE is important as an
opportunity benchmark. What else could an investor invest in to get a better
return? Again, consistency, trends, and comparisons are critical.
Return on invested capital
Debt, while raising ROE in good times, also can lead to financial disaster. As a
result, many investors instead look at return on invested capital (ROIC), mea-
suring profit as a percentage of combined owners’ equity and debt invest-
ments. This measure is sometimes called return on total capital, or ROTC.
Here’s the formula:
Return on invested capital = net earnings ÷ (owners’ equity + long-term debt)
Frequently, you see ROE and ROIC side by side in ratio charts and discus-
sions. Sustained ROE of 20 percent or more is considered very good, and
ROIC should be higher, because debt increases the size of the business on
the same equity base. See Chapter 4 for more on ROE/ROIC.
Valuation ratios
The ratios presented so far are aimed at appraising a company’s performance
to get a better understanding of its intrinsic value. If a business were an
orchestra, productivity, financial structure, and profitability would be sec-
tions, like brass, woodwinds, and strings. The total sound produced depends
not just on individual sounds made by individual instruments (ratios) but
also how they work together to produce music.
Now here’s the critical question: As a music buff, how much would you pay to
listen to it? That’s the question that valuation ratios try to answer: How much
would you pay (and how much are others paying) for tickets to this concert?
Here, finally, the stock price enters the stage.
And now, the most popular ratio of all, the one seen in the newspaper, heard
about on talk shows, found in all those beginning books on investing, makes
its appearance here: the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Alongside P/E, other
valuation ratios, including price-to-sales, price-to-book, and a couple of bou-
tique P/E variations, enter the mix.
579
Chapter 3: Using Ratios as a Valuation Tool
Book VII
Value
Investing

Price-to-earnings
Price-to-earnings is just what it sounds like: the ratio of a price at a point in
time to net earnings in a period, usually the trailing 12 months (TTM). Here’s
the formula:
Price-to-earnings (P/E) = stock price ÷ net earnings per share
A high P/E — say, 20 or higher — indicates a relatively high valuation. A low
P/E — say, 15 or less — indicates a relatively low or more conservative one.
Most investors are probably familiar with P/E, so the calculation doesn’t need
to be illustrated here. Rather, it makes sense to share a couple of useful deriv-
atives: earnings-to-price and price-earnings-to-growth, both of which bring
greater understanding to the base P/E measure. Chapter 4 also explores P/E
in greater detail.
Earnings-to-price
Earnings-to-price is simply the reciprocal of P/E, or 1 divided by the P/E. Why
is this important? Earnings-to-price is the functional equivalent of a stock’s
yield, comparable to an interest rate on a fixed income investment. Because
we’re talking earnings and not dividends, this yield doesn’t usually come your
way in the form of a check, but it’s useful just the same to determine how
much return your dollar paid for a share is generating. Many people call this
figure earnings yield.
Take our construction products manufacturer example: 17.6 was a recent P/E
based on a share price of $33 and TTM earnings of 1.87. Earnings yield would
thus be 1/17.6, or 5.7 percent. What’s the significance? This investment could
be compared to a long-term Treasury security (today yielding about 4.5
percent) as a prospective investment. Which investment is better? An
580
Book VII: Value Investing 
When in doubt, should you average?
Occasionally, you see a variation in ROE and
sometimes ROA formulas. Because these ratios
use recent snapshot balance sheet items in the
denominator, some analysts feel that you get
the most accurate financial picture by adding
year-end and year-beginning equity or asset
values and dividing by 2. Thus ROE would be
ROE = net earnings ÷ [(beginning equity +
ending equity) ÷ 2]
Many information sources and services use the
averaged formula. If you use a data source or
service to acquire these figures, it’s best to
understand how your source calculates the
figures. Most important, be consistent when
evaluating different investments.

investment in that business returns more and, while being riskier, affords the
opportunity for gain through growth. The difference in earnings yield illus-
trates the basic risk/return tradeoff between investing in corporate equities
versus safe fixed-income Treasuries.
Price-earnings-to-growth
Investors pay more for companies with greater growth prospects. Greater
growth prospects mean greater earnings and greater earnings yields sooner.
So when comparing businesses, one popular way to normalize P/Es is to
compare them to their respective companies’ growth rates. From this
comparison, you get a ratio known as price-earnings-to-growth, or PEG:
Price-earnings-to-growth = P/E ÷ earnings growth rate
If Cisco has an earnings growth rate of 25 percent, while our sample manufac-
turer is 10 percent and Bank of America’s is 5 percent, then PEG is 27.4 ÷ 25
or 1.1 for Cisco, 17.4 ÷ 10 or 1.74 for our company, and 10 ÷ 5 or 2 for Bank of
America. If you’re confident in the sustainability of the growth rates, you’d
pick Cisco as the best investment because its P/E is modest compared to its
growth rate.
Price-to-sales
Per dollar of shareholder value, how much business does a company gener-
ate? Price-to-sales (P/S) is a straightforward way to answer this question.
Here’s the formula:
Price-to-sales = stock price (total market cap) ÷ total sales (revenues)
P/S is a common-sense ratio. The lower the better, although there’s no spe-
cific rule or normalizing factor like growth. Somewhere around 1.0 usually is
considered good. 2.0 isn’t out of hand, but the business had better grow con-
sistently into its valuation. P/S can be a way to filter out unworthy candidates.
Price-to-book
The price-to-book ratio (P/B) is getting varying amounts of attention from
investors in different sectors. Here’s the formula:
Price-to-book = stock price (total market cap) ÷ book value
Book value consists of the accounting value of assets less (real) liabilities —
sort of an accounting net worth or owners’ equity of a corporation. This figure
has greater meaning in financial services industries, where most assets are
actual dollars, not factories, inventories, goodwill, and other hard-to-value
items. Some book value measures include intangible assets, and others
exclude them.
581
Chapter 3: Using Ratios as a Valuation Tool
Book VII
Value
Investing

Value investors use price-to-book a bit like price-to-sales: as a test for obvious
lack of value. P/B of 1.0 is very good — unless the asset base is a bunch of rusty
unused railroad tracks. P/B of less than 1.0 signifies a buying opportunity if
book assets are quality assets. A price way out of line with book had better be
justified by conservative asset valuation or by the nature of the industry. In the
software industry, for example, if R&D (research and development) is properly
expensed and intellectual capital intangibles are aggressively amortized, book
value and P/B will be low. Again, like elsewhere, trends and apples-to-apples
comparisons are important.
582
Book VII: Value Investing 
Market cap
When calculating price-to-sales ratios or other
valuation measures, it’s sometimes easier to
look at aggregate rather than per-share
amounts. Sales are reported as an aggregate
figure, not as a per-share figure. So to compare
apples to apples, you can look at aggregate
share valuation instead of the per-share price.
This aggregate figure is known as market cap-
italization, or market cap for short. Market cap
is simply the number of shares (usually the fully
loaded number, including options and equiva-
lents) times the stock price. Divide total market
cap by total sales, and you have the price-to-
sales ratio.

o be consistent with the value investing approach, you must understand
what a company is worth before you make an investment decision. If only
it were so simple. Valuation has been the subject of vast theoretical study
and debate — as well as experience and learning — in the investing commu-
nity. Business valuation is at best an inexact science that no two people do
exactly the same way. The goal of this chapter is to expose you to some of
the techniques and underlying principles. Whether you apply them rigor-
ously to every investment decision or just keep them in the back of your
mind is up to you.
A How-to Valuation Guide
The following value investing model is one that you can use as is or modify to
meet your own needs. It’s designed for non-professionals, those with just a
few hours a month to review and select investments.
1. Screen companies.
Using P/E, P/S, or other chosen ratios (see Chapter 3), get a list of compa-
nies to evaluate. The list can include industries considered timely by pop-
ular investment analysts, companies you read about in the financial press,
or companies you deal with in everyday life that appear to have their act
together. In addition, online stock screeners are useful for this step.
2. Calculate intrinsic value.
Using formulas presented in the next section, estimate intrinsic value for
each chosen candidate.

3. Assess each company’s strategic value.
Develop a checklist for key business performance measures (return on
assets growing, return on equity constant, profit margins growing, liquid-
ity sufficient, and so on). Then, add a checklist and evaluate intangibles.
For details, check out the upcoming sections “Looking at Strategic
Financials: It’s All about ROE” on strategic financials and “Evaluating
Intangibles” on strategic intangibles.
4. Decide whether the price is right.
Compare current price to intrinsic value, sprinkle in strategic value
assessments, and bake in a dash of judgment. The later section
“Deciding When the Price Is Right” walks you through this process.
Evaluating Intrinsic Value
Intrinsic value is a present dollar value placed on the expected net returns
generated by a business over time. Profits and growth drive intrinsic value.
For any fairly priced asset to increase in value over time, the value of the
returns must grow. The value you get out of owning a business or a security
is the amount you receive in return for your investment. That return may
come as a single payment at the end of the ownership period for selling the
stock or business, or as payments at regular intervals during ownership (divi-
dends), or as a combination of the two.
Growth and time value of money have a major impact on the final valuation of
equity investment returns. In fact, intrinsic valuation is a lot about assessing
the effects of future growth on future returns and then assigning a present
value to those returns.
Asking key questions
The following questions can guide your assessment of business returns:
 How much? How many dollars of return will the business produce, either
to distribute to shareholders or to invest productively in the business?
Key drivers are profitability and growth rates — and the collection of
business factors that drive the profitability and growth.
 How soon? If two companies produce the same return but one does it
sooner, that company has more value, because those dollars can be
reinvested elsewhere sooner for more return.
584
Book VII: Value Investing 

 How long? Although future returns have less value than current returns,
they do have substantial value, and 20, 30, or 50 years of those returns
can’t be ignored, particularly in a profitable, growing business.
 How consistent? A company producing slow, steady growth and return is
usually more valuable than one that’s all over the map. A greater variability,
or uncertainty, around projected returns calls for more conservative
growth and/or discounting assumptions.
After you assess potential returns (how much, how soon, how long, how
consistent), you must assign a current value to those returns. That value is
driven by the value of the investment capital as it might be used elsewhere. A
return may look attractive until you realize you can achieve the same return
with a bond or a less risky investment. Valuing the returns involves discount-
ing (using a discount rate) to bring future returns back to fair current value
(see Chapter 1). The discount rate is your personal cost of capital — in this
case, the rate of return you expect to deploy capital here versus elsewhere.
Sooner isn’t always better. A business producing quick, short-term bucks may
not be more valuable than one that produces slow, steady growth. Even
though the quick-bucker produces a lot of value in the first few years, that
may not be better than sustained growth and value produced later on by the
slower, steadier company.
More about returns
When you look at a business, you seek consistent, growing returns on a qual-
ity asset base — achieving reasonable returns without taking on unreason-
able risk. So what “returns” am I referring to? Direct returns to shareholders?
Returns to the business? Net income? Cash flow? EBITDA? What’s the best
“base” for intrinsic value?
Net income to the business is the starting point, but many investors look further.
Dividends
As part of intrinsic value, dividends are counted as part of yearly investment
returns and grown and discounted in the same way as earnings retained in
the business. But deducting dividends reduces the growth base of retained
earnings and book value kept in the business. Companies with a high growth
rate and return on equity often yield greater intrinsic value if all earnings are
retained and reinvested, which is why you often see just that — no dividends
in high-growth companies.

Cash flow streams
Any one of the following cash flow streams can be used as an input to an
intrinsic value model:
 Cash flow (CF) or discounted cash flow (DCF): Cash flows, covered in
detail in Chapter 2, are yearly cash returns into a business, without
accounting adjustments for asset write-downs, amortizations, and the
like. Many sophisticated security analysis models, including intrinsic
value models, operate on cash flow. These models are sometimes
referred to as discounted cash flow (DCF) models.
 EBITDA: Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization
is an approximation of cash generated by business operating activities.
(Note: Interest and taxes are real, and depreciation comes into play
when depreciated fixed assets need to be replaced. Because intrinsic
value calculations are long term in view, it’s dangerous to leave out the
cost of fixed assets, especially in a business that has a lot of them.)
 Free cash flow (FCF): Free cash flow is essentially cash flow generated
from operations beyond interest, taxes, and capital investments. As a
business owner, it’s what you’d really be able to put into your pocket.
 Net free cash flow (owner earnings): The most realistic version of free
cash flow starts with plain old free cash flow and then makes an
additional adjustment for working capital changes.
Although cash flow streams may be more robust than earnings, they’re
harder to identify for the nonprofessional investor. Most free data sources
provide little in the way of cash flow figures, and if they do, they aren’t
adjusted to give a clear view of fixed asset or working capital investments.
Earnings
Most investors use earnings as the most readily available proxy for business
returns. Understanding earnings quality and the differences between earn-
ings and cash flow goes a long way toward producing valid results.
When using earnings streams to project future returns, make sure to under-
stand quality and one-time extraordinary gains or losses. Especially when
occurring in the base year, extraordinary earnings items can mess up the
intrinsic value calculation. Be especially careful when using a “canned” pack-
age, as it picks up whatever is on a company’s source earnings database,
ordinary or otherwise. To their credit, analysts and Value Line (www.value
line.com) usually filter out these abnormalities when making projections.
586
Book VII: Value Investing 

Projecting future growth
Beyond the net assets owned by a business today, intrinsic value is driven by
current and especially future earnings. For that reason, projecting future
earnings growth is vital to determining intrinsic value. The following sections
explain how to examine growth assumptions more closely.
True intrinsic value is the total of all expected future returns: this year, next
year, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80 years from now. How can you possibly project a company’s
return when part of it includes something that happens 77 years from now? It’s
hard enough to project next year’s returns. Answer: by taking it in stages:
 First stage: Typically the first stage is ten years, although in some analyses
it may be more or less. Near-term growth is by nature easier to model,
and as a result of the discounting process, it contributes more toward
the final result anyway. For these reasons, intrinsic value models are set
up to specifically value a first stage in detail, year-by-year. The first stage
is generally assumed to have a higher growth rate and a lower discount
rate than the second stage.
 Second stage: Second-stage returns are harder than first-stage to project
with any degree of accuracy, so intrinsic value models use one of two
assumptions to estimate what is known as continuing value:
• Indefinite life: The indefinite life model assumes ongoing returns
and uses a mathematical formula to project returns over an indefinite
period of time.
• Acquisition: A convenient way to bypass mathematical approxima-
tions is to assume that someone will come along and buy your
business after the first stage at a reasonable valuation. Returns
include all future payouts, including lump sums, so this method
works too, so long as resale value is projected reasonably.
Each stage of a business life has a growth rate and discount rate applicable to
that stage. To run a model, you need a base, first- and second-stage growth
rates, and first- and second-stage discount rates. You calculate net future
earnings by first compounding growth over the first stage and then discount-
ing that value back to the present. A generalized formula, either indefinite life
or acquisition-based, is applied to the second stage. The value attributed to
the second stage is called continuing value.

Intrinsic Value Models
To determine intrinsic value you can use one of three intrinsic value models:

to construct; formulas will be shown along with sample results for both
indefinite continuing value and the acquisition assumption.
 Prepackaged Web-based analyzer: At this writing, the data and analysis
package offered by iStockResearch (www.istockresearch.com) is the
best available for free.
 Intrinsic value formula as developed by Ben Graham: This simple for-
mula is easy to apply and gives surprisingly robust results.
The one highlighted in this section is built from scratch as an Excel spread-
sheet. At the time of this writing, there is little in the way of PC or Web-based
models available for use by consumer investors. As noted, the exception is
iStockResearch, which offers a model to non-professional investors; I offer an
example later in the chapter.
Of course, any time you use a tool, it’s good to know in advance what out-
come to expect. With intrinsic value models, you get a single-figure result: the
estimated per-share value of the company. One single number: Company ABC,
for example, may have a projected worth of $34.97. If you’re satisfied with this
number and the assumptions supporting it, you can compare this intrinsic
value with current market price and make a buying (or selling) decision. More
likely, you’ll want to model a range of intrinsic values based on different
assumptions. Then to complete the value appraisal, you’ll want to consider
strategic financials and intangibles before hitting the buy (or sell) button.
Intrinsic value worksheet models
With a spreadsheet and a few initial assumptions, you can build your own
intrinsic value worksheet for either continuing value assumption: the indefinite
life model or the acquisition assumption model. Figure 4-1 shows an example of
the indefinite life continuing value model, with formulas to help you build your
own. Note that dollar figures, except per-share amounts, are in millions.

The indefinite life model
The mainstream intrinsic value model makes a mathematical assumption
about so-called “continuing value.” The worksheet has nine parts.
Step 1: Growth and discount assumptions
Not surprisingly, here at the very top of the worksheet is where you can do
the most damage — or the most good — to your analysis because of the
potential effects of these assumptions carried over 10, 15, or 20 years, due to
the power of compounding.
The most realistic way to model intrinsic value is to choose two stages; a
more rapid initial growth stage and a more conservative, or flat, second
stage. So two growth rates are chosen, and two corresponding discount rates
are chosen. Almost always, the initial growth rate exceeds the second stage
growth rate while, due to uncertainty, the second stage discount rate exceeds
the initial one.
 Choosing a growth assumption: To choose a growth assumption, you
can rely on outside sources including professional analysts or Value
Line. You can eyeball the numbers yourself and pick a number that
makes sense, even with conservative bias. Or you can dig deeper and do
what most professional analysts do and derive earnings growth esti-
mates by projecting sales, profitability, productivity, and so on.
Regardless of how you decide to formulate your growth assumptions, it
is important to be consistent. Comparing two businesses by using different
approaches to growth and discounting assumptions can lead to trouble.
 Projecting second-stage growth: To project second-stage growth, you
can’t use the same tools and techniques you use to project first-stage
growth. Not even the most self-assured analysts try to pin down growth
rates beyond ten years!
Excessive second-stage growth rates distort results because so much
time is involved. And no matter what the company is, sooner or later it
will exhaust market growth and penetration opportunities. Second-stage
growth rates should be less than first-stage growth rates and less than
10 percent, probably no more than 5 or 6 percent. Conservative is
always better.
If you’re uncomfortable with second-stage growth rates and their effect
on valuation (and many investors are), you can use the acquisition
model presented later in this chapter. Although this model implies that
an acquisition will take place, it can also be used to reduce sensitivity to
input assumptions even if acquisition is unlikely.
 Choosing a discount assumption: In theory, the discount rate should be
your own personal cost of capital for this kind of investment plus equity
premium that’s added to the risk-free cost of capital rate. Here’s the
reasoning: If you can invest your money with no risk in a Treasury bond
590
Book VII: Value Investing 

at 5 percent, your cost of capital is the risk-free 5 percent you would
forego by not investing in the bond. But because Company XYZ common
stock is riskier than the bond investment, an equity premium is added as
compensation for assuming extra risk.
Most value investors, however, prefer a simpler approach: Just discount
at a relatively high rate, usually higher than the growth rate.
Conservative value investors usually use discount rates in the 10 to 15
percent range. Here are a few points to remember about discount rates:
• The higher the discount rate, the lower the intrinsic value — and
vice versa.
• The second-stage discount rate should always be higher than the
first-stage rate. Risk increases the farther out you go.
• If you choose an aggressive growth rate, it makes sense also to
choose a higher discount rate. Risk of failure is higher with high
growth rates.
• If the discount rate exceeds the growth rate, intrinsic value will be
low and implode quickly the larger the gap. Aggressive growth
assumptions with low discount rates yield very high intrinsic values.
Following is the set of growth and discount assumptions used for this example.
Consistency is important, but growth rates will vary for each company, and
discount rates may change also with differing risk assessments.

Step 2: Earnings, shares outstanding, EPS
Earnings, number of shares, and EPS come straight from the statements. This
model projects total, rather than per-share, earnings streams, to make it
easier to subtract out (not per-share) long-term debt (which happens to be
zero for Simpson Manufacturing, used in the Figure 4-1 example).
When loading beginning earnings, remember to adjust for one-time or extra-
ordinary gains or charges.

Step 3: Calculate the ten-year earnings stream
This section projects growth during each year of the first stage and then dis-
counts the resulting value back to the present. The spreadsheet formulas are
straightforward. For each year, you do the following:
1. Multiply beginning earnings by [(1 + g1)n]
where g1 is the first-stage growth rate
and n is the sequential future year.
2. Divide that figure by [(1 + d1)n]
where d1 is the first-stage discount rate.
The resulting figures represent projected earnings for each year, discounted
to the present.
Step 4: Total discounted return, first ten years
To arrive at the sum of the first ten years’ discounted earnings stream, simply
add the figures for each year. The total represents the total discounted value
of the first stage.
Step 5: Continuing value
Higher math enters the picture in calculating a continuing value for all future
returns. Here’s the formula:
[E × (1 + g1)n +1] ÷ (d2 – g2) all divided by (1+d1)n
where
E is beginning earnings
g1 and d1 are first-stage growth and discount rates, respectively
g2 and d2 are second-stage growth and discount rates, respectively
n is the number of years in the first stage, in this case, 10
After you enter this formula into your worksheet, the computation is simple.
The resulting single value approximates the discounted value of all future
returns for the business beyond the first stage.
Step 6: Total discounted future returns value
The next step is to add first-stage and second-stage continuing discounted
value to find the value of the total discounted future returns.
Step 7: Long-term debt adjustment
To arrive at true value, you have to take long debt away from earnings.
592
Book VII: Value Investing 

Step 8: Net future returns value
Net of long-term debt, the net future returns value is the total intrinsic value,
based on future returns, of the business.
Step 9: Per-share intrinsic value
Now, finally, the bottom line. Divide net future returns value by the number of
shares outstanding to get a per-share intrinsic value. This is the magic
number to compare with market price and with other companies. You’re
done!
The acquisition assumption model
If the continuing value formula of the preceding section makes you nervous,
and if the idea of trying to project to eternity makes you equally nervous,
there is another approach. The approach is to assume that someone else will
buy the business at a fair value at the end of the first stage. In essence, you
get continuing value in a lump sum payment, which of course must also be
discounted for time value of money.
Before showing the model, here are a few important points:
 Growth and discount assumptions are the same as for the indefinite life
model.
 The price paid by the acquirer is the key assumption that makes or breaks
this model. That price is calculated as a ratio of price to book value, or
P/B. Earnings during the first stage grow the base book value. You then
supply an assumption of what price-to-book value is appropriate ten
years down the road and use that to determine the cash-out price.
Earnings paid out as dividends don’t accrue to long-term book value and
should be backed out of the earnings stream used to grow book value.
Share buybacks should also be backed out.
 Because book value already nets out debt, long-term debt doesn’t need
to be factored in.

Book VII: Value Investing 

The acquisition assumption worksheet model is fairly straightforward. Growth
and discount assumptions are the same as in the indefinite life model. Base
values are share price and per-share book value, which are used to calculate
an initial price-to-book ratio. A per-share earnings figure is then used as a base
for growth and discounting.
The book value is assumed to increase by each year’s grown and discounted
earnings. If there are dividends or significant share buybacks, subtract them
out — they will not accrete to book value — but you may want to value them
as a separate discounted income stream. The formula for growing earnings
and discounting to the present is the same, except here you apply it to per-
share earnings instead of total earnings.
To model the value in Year 10, when the supposed acquisition takes place
(you can set it up for a different year), here is a short tour through the steps:
1. Make your growth and discounting assumptions, just as you would in the
indefinite life model, and look up key figures on the financial statements.
2. Estimate the annual accretion of earnings to book value, but subtract
dividends and other shareholder payments.
3. Model the incremental book value per share per year by growing, then
discounting, the per-share net earnings over the ten years, much like the
indefinite life model.
4. Take current book value and assume that it remains intact ten years
from now; then discount the value back to the present to get an apples-
to-apples view of all components of Year 10 book value.
One benefit of this version of the model is that some value is explicitly
placed on productive assets already owned by the business.
5. Total the estimated ten-year book value.
Now comes the fun part: figuring out the acquisition price based on the price-
to-book (P/B) ratio:
6. Determine what price-to-book you should use.
Which one you use depends on the type of business, what other compa-
rable acquisitions show, and your own intuition. In a manufacturing busi-
ness, a P/B of 2.0 is probably reasonable because book values of
productive physical assets tend to be low. If you’re valuing a financial
institution, with assets mainly in cash and receivables, the model P/B
would likely be lower. If you’re valuing a technology company, the P/B
may perhaps be higher.
595
Chapter 4: Valuing a Business
Book VII
Value
Investing

Using today’s P/B ratio is a place to start, although if it’s much higher
than 1.0, there’s a tendency for the ratio to decline over time as growth
patterns settle and the company matures. Any P/B ratio exceeding 3 is
probably excessive.
7. Multiply the total ten-year book value by acquisition P/B and, voilà, you
get intrinsic value.
Depending on how you set the assumptions, the indefinite life model and ten-
year acquisition models yield similar results. That isn’t a big surprise
because acquiring firms are (or should be) looking for the same kinds of
intrinsic value characteristics that you are.
The iStockResearch model
As fundamental as intrinsic value modeling may seem, it’s surprising how few
tools are available for individual consumer investors to put it into play. Such
models are commonly used by value-oriented investing professionals, but,
possibly due to their complexity and sticky assumptions like discount rates,
they haven’t hit the mainstream.
The best tool available today, offered as a stand-alone Web site by Canadian-
born and educated CFA (chartered financial analyst) Alexander Chepakovich,
is iStockResearch, available at www.istockresearch.com.
The iStockResearch model is similar to the indefinite life model but is more
complete. First, the site contains the financial data for most major U.S. com-
panies, so you don’t have to find it yourself. Second, rather than a split first-
and second-stage growth pattern, the model allows a yearly decline or “decay”
in growth rates — perhaps more realistic. Finally, it factors in stock option
grants (the earlier models did not), and it supplies a recommended discount
rate based on current economic conditions and the industry the company is
part of. The results, as shown in Figure 4-3, are similar to the other models.
Note that you can modify the growth and discount assumptions as you choose
to get a range of acceptable modeling results.
The site is free and easy to use, and it gives a complete set of raw financial
data to help in other analysis. This site and set of tools is highly recom-
mended for beginning and more experienced value investors.
596
Book VII: Value Investing 

The Ben Graham model
Finally, and perhaps most simply, it’s worth checking out intrinsic value
through the eyes of Ben Graham, based on his 1930s formula:
Intrinsic value = Earnings × [(2 × growth rate) + 8.5] × [4.4 ÷ bond yield]
A simple straight-line formula, no exponents, no first- and second-stage stuff,
no discount rate? Could it work? In a word, yes.
The Graham model, derived from the more complex model but philosophically
aligned to it, can be used as computational shorthand. It doesn’t allow for stages
and uses a more simplistic discounting assumption. And it can produce the
same wide range of results as the other models. But it is a good shortcut —
one you may be able to do in your head when looking at a number of invest-
ment choices.
Looking at Strategic Financials: 
It’s All about ROE
Return on equity (ROE), at the end of the day, is one of the most important
business growth drivers. Sustained ROE implies sustained growth and blares
out loudly “well-managed company!” Strategic financials represent the factors
management can shape and control to achieve growth, ROE, and, hence,
intrinsic value.

Chapter 4: Valuing a Business
Book VII
Value
Investing

Unlike intrinsic value, ROE doesn’t estimate the value of a company. You can’t
go through a series of calculations culminating in a per-share value estimate.
But ROE — and its components — can tell whether things are healthy and
moving in the right direction. Another way to look at the difference: Intrinsic
value explicitly looks forward into the income-producing capability of the firm
in the long run, while strategic valuation is primarily a snapshot of the present,
albeit with many components that can predict future performance.
ROE may appear to be a single number, but in fact there’s a complex chain of
events or set of factors underlying the figure. A series of business fundamentals,
all linked together, leads to respectable, sustained, and growing ROE. That
“strategic value” chain will become clearer in the strategic profit formula,
which I cover next.
The strategic profit formula
In the strategic profit formula, sometimes called the DuPont formula because
it originated in DuPont’s finance department, it’s easy to see the links in the
chain: profitability, productivity, and capital structure, in sequence:
Return on equity = [profits/sales] × [sales/assets] × [assets/equity]
The intermediate terms in this formula tell a great deal about the health of
the business. For each intermediate term in the formula, you want to know its
value, in what direction it’s going (trend), and how it compares to others in
the industry.
ROE, defined as net earnings divided by owners’ equity, is a capitalist’s
bottom line. It represents the return on owners’ equity invested in the busi-
ness. As a practical matter, although it can be jiggered somewhat through
accounting policy and practice, it’s a good barometer to determine whether
the company is on the right track and whether management is doing a good
job. Other things to know about ROE:
 Over time, ROE trends toward the earnings growth rate of the company.
A company with a 5 percent earnings growth rate and a 20 percent ROE
today will see ROE gradually diminish toward 5 percent. A company with
a 20 percent earnings growth rate and a 10 percent ROE will see ROE
move toward 20 percent, as the numerator grows at a faster rate than
the denominator.
 ROE doesn’t just happen all by itself. A series of business fundamentals,
all linked together and controlled or influenced by management, leads to
respectable, sustained, and growing ROE. The links are profitability,
productivity, and capital structure. When all three are strong and tight,
ROE outcome is destined for success. If a business fundamental is poor
or failing, it can weaken the entire chain and hamper ROE indefinitely.
598
Book VII: Value Investing 

 Pay attention to ROTC, return on total capital. ROTC is owners’ equity
plus long-term debt. If a company is growing ROE but not ROTC, chances
are the company is borrowing to fund growth-producing assets, thus
leveraging the company. (In moderation, this can be a good thing.) So
look at ROTC and ROE together. They should march side by side and
change in unison. Many information services such as Value Line provide
both figures simultaneously.
 Unlike intrinsic value, covered in the preceding section, ROE doesn’t
purport to estimate the value of a company. Although intrinsic value is an
absolute measure of company value, ROE and its components tend to be
relative to past performance and to the performance of other businesses.
Bottom line: Maintaining a constant ROE percentage requires steady earnings
growth. For that reason, a company with increasing ROE, without undue
exposure to debt or leverage, is especially attractive.
ROE value chain components
Each link in the ROE chain has its own component drivers. For instance,
strategic financials such as gross margins and expenses drive profitability.
Asset levels, quality, and turnover drive productivity, while debt and new
capital requirements drive capital structure. In turn, strategic intangibles such
as market position, customer share and loyalty, brand strength, and supply
chain strength drive those margins and expenses.
Figure 4-4 illustrates the strategic value chain. ROE, the result, is shown as a
result or outcome at the right-hand side of the figure. Working backwards
toward the left, the figure lists a few examples of value chain components
that drive ROE components and thus ROE. They’re grouped into strategic
financials (measurable financial factors) and strategic intangibles (mostly
immeasurable market and business characteristics that drive them).
The value investor works backward through the ROE value chain to find good
or bad in ROE drivers and the things that influence those drivers.
For the first-tier components of ROE, perform a quality test. Look for charac-
teristics that are off course. For example, low debt doesn’t necessarily indicate
high value, but frequent trips to the capital markets for debt or stock sales
may indicate capital starvation and “un-value.” Consider a drug test metaphor
here: The substances you’re testing for are frequently addictive to bad
managements — overuse of acquisitions, write-offs and write-downs, debt,
and stock sales, which are used to pad numbers and fix problems arising
from bad performance. Keep in mind that drug tests are usually painless
pass/fail tests, not detailed assessments.

Measuring profitability
To measure profitability, you want to first consider the financial drivers that
lead to the net profit percent. Then you want to test the major ROE compo-
nents for any signs of trouble. Finally, you need to look at the intangibles.
Financial drivers
Profit/sales, or net profit percent, is the primary profitability measure. No sur-
prise here. But when looking at profitability, look at the dynamics behind net
profit percent. Specifically, you want to look at gross margin, SG&A, and oper-
ating profit percent.
Gross margin
Gross margin tells a lot about a business’s success in managing its sales and
the direct costs of producing products and services. A company on top of its
marketing and production game usually produces improving margins.
Market characteristics and selling aggressiveness can work against margins.
Intuitively, you may guess that increased volumes lead to increased margins, as
fixed costs are absorbed and economies of scale work in their favor. However,
this isn’t always the case. A company often must make price concessions to
achieve sales goals. And aggressive volume building also takes its toll on
operating costs (not part of gross margin) in the form of marketing expenses

and sometimes interest expense to expand the level of business. The key is to
understand the industry in which you want to invest.
Selling, general, and administrative
Selling, general, and administrative (SG&A), although not directly tied to net
profit percent, tells a lot about how management controls expenses and how
expenses are tied to business production. SG&A percentage is the total SG&A
cost divided by sales or revenues. You have to calculate this one yourself, as
few information sources provide this info. It is an important part of total
operating expenses — and thus operating profit percentage. Also be aware
that different companies define SG&A differently, so look to annual reports
for clarification.
When SG&A increases faster than sales, that’s a bad sign, especially in a
maturing industry. Although investors tolerate short-term expenditures in
marketing campaigns, store openings, or customer relationship management
platforms, these can’t go on forever. Chronic SG&A percentage increases are
a red flag.
Operating profit
SG&A is part of this important figure, but certainly not all. Depreciation,
amortization, and certain facility and employee costs can all influence operat-
ing expenses. A company in control of gross margin and operating expenses
will show increased operating profit.
Even though some companies may go through periods of deteriorating gross
margins, focus on total profitability and tight control of SG&A and other oper-
ating expenses may keep operating profit percentages relatively flat — a good
sign that management is managing total shareholder return.
Quality checks
As you do your evaluation of the major ROE components, test each one for
signs of trouble or inherent weakness. Here are key quality checks for prof-
itability:
 Overdependence on acquisitions for growth: Companies sometimes
get so caught up in building the top line that they resort to painful and
expensive acquisitions to do it. Profitability usually suffers.
 Excessive goodwill: Often working hand-in-hand with acquisitions,
growth in goodwill or a growing gap between total stockholder equity
and net tangible assets can signal trouble in the form of future write-offs.
601
Chapter 4: Valuing a Business
Book VII
Value
Investing

 Overdependence on expansion: Growth is good, but if the core business
isn’t growing or is declining, that’s a bad sign. Try to sniff out organic
growth — that is, growth not sourced from new outlets or acquisitions. 
If sales are expanding but profits aren’t, it’s a sign that the most recent
expansions aren’t working. (However, it depends on the industry: A
Starbucks outlet will produce returns more quickly than an aircraft plant.)
 Cash flow and changes in book value march with changes in earnings:
If earnings rise but cash flow and book value don’t, over time, you must
question the quality of earnings.
Intangible drivers
Obviously, the intangibles you want to pay attention to are those that are rel-
evant to gross margins:
 Market position: It’s a vital influencer, involving a myriad of things:
market leadership, brand dominance, public image, pricing power and
so on.
 Resource acquisition or supply chain power: This directly affects costs.
 Reporting quality: Do a quick spot check of cash flows and changes in
book value as they relate to earnings. Once again, it’s important to
understand write-offs and extraordinary items that may affect the analysis.
 A check with neighbors: See how other businesses in the industry are
faring.
Basically, you want to look for improving profitability measures and to be
able to explain those that aren’t improving.
Measuring productivity
Productivity measures tell us how well companies deploy and use assets. All
things considered, a dollar of sales produced on 50 cents worth of assets is
better than the same company producing a dollar of sales on a dollar of
assets. Obviously, asset productivity figures vary by industry as different
industries require different assets to do business.
Financial drivers
Sales/assets is the primary measure of asset productivity and is simply the
amount of sales generated per asset dollar deployed. As you look at
sales/assets, avoid these two traps:
602
Book VII: Value Investing 

 Misinterpreting changes due to write-offs: If a company took the plunge
to purge a big chunk of overvalued or nonexistent assets from the
books, that would show up as an “improvement” in sales/assets. Not! Be
careful to distill out major changes in asset deployment that create no
change in the business.
 Reading too much into the absolute numbers: Sales/assets will be huge
for a Microsoft or Oracle, reporting high sales on a small asset base,
while a large industrial corporation, railroad, or electric utility requiring
a large asset infrastructure will appear to have poor asset utilization. Be
careful about comparing across industries. Good comparisons — and
trends — are most important.
Deconstructing ROA
Many popular information services show ROA, return on assets. If you’re
wondering why ROA doesn’t make the grade as a first-tier ROE component,
here’s why: ROA really does too much.
ROA is net profit divided by total assets, which you’ll recognize as the first
two links in the ROE chain combined. (Profit/assets = profit/sales ×
sales/assets, for you math types.) I don’t dispute the validity and value of
ROA but prefer to look at the two links separately. The first measure,
profit/sales, has more to do with market power and cost structures, while the
second, sales/assets, has more to do with resource requirements and deploy-
ment. Deconstructing ROA provides a more bottoms-up, inside-out view of
the business.
Keep in mind that if ROA and profit margin figures are supplied by an infor-
mation portal such as Yahoo! Finance or Value Line, you can deduce asset
productivity. Bad ROA and good margins equal bad productivity.
Deconstructing sales/assets
An obvious key to understanding total sales/assets is to understand utiliza-
tion for individual assets making up the total asset base. Accounts receivable,
inventory, and fixed assets are the major food groups in this value chain.
 Accounts receivable turnover: How many dollars in sales does the busi-
ness generate per dollar of accounts receivable investment? A business
on top of its receivables generates more and more, through faster collections
and extending less credit altogether. When examining statements for
accounts receivable, use trade accounts receivable — those that arise
from and support the normal course of business.
 Inventory turnover: A business in control of finished goods, raw material,
and production inventories shows greater sales per dollar invested in
inventory.
603
Chapter 4: Valuing a Business
Book VII
Value
Investing

 Fixed asset turnover: This is another turnover measure, this time for
fixed assets or PP&E (property, plant, and equipment).
Occasionally you’ll see a modest sales/asset gain when the big three
components — accounts receivable, inventory, and fixed assets —
showed larger improvements, up to 50 percent. In many cases, this is
due to increased cash, which is also an asset and part of the denominator
base. If a company shows stubbornly little improvement in asset
productivity as reported, sometimes it’s because of cash accumulation —
sometimes because of other assets. Scrupulous value investors should
check to make sure what those other assets represent.
 Unit productivity measures: If the figures are available, you can go into
sales per facility, sales per store, same-store-sales growth, revenue per
mile of track or passenger seat flown, or sales per square foot, depending
on the industry. You can also track sales per employee, a handy metric
for overall efficiency and management competence. Finding historic data
for these factors can be challenging, but such unit productivity metrics
are good for comparing with other firms in the same industry once you
understand them.
For a possible clue that problems are present, look at asset write-downs. If
write-downs are excessive and persistent, asset quality — and really, asset
acquisition — problems are evident. On the flip side, a company not taking
sufficient write-downs may also be suspect. If technology changes, capital
equipment is overbought, or sales are declining, asset write-downs not taken
may spell trouble. The telecommunications industry is a recent example.
Quality checks
Asset productivity measures themselves are pretty good at sniffing out qual-
ity problems: If a company has the wrong assets or poor quality assets, they
generally won’t generate as much sales or income. Value investors should
look at write-offs and write-off history: If a company seems to always be writ-
ing off some inventory or writing down accounts receivable with impairment
charges and reserves, asset quality may be called into question.
Sometimes a more subjective assessment comes into play: Do company facili-
ties look modern and efficient? Does a company keep up with trends in infor-
mation technology and supply chain management? These questions can be
hard to answer and are more intangible than measurable, but closely fol-
lowed businesses will usually yield some clues.
Intangible drivers
Asset quality is greatly influenced by depreciation and amortization policies.
Channel structure (direct, single-tier retail, two-tier wholesale-retail, OEM, or
other) can greatly influence the amount of assets required, particularly
604
Book VII: Value Investing 

receivables and inventory. And of course, the base nature of the business —
the cost structure — can tell a lot. A steel mill has different asset needs and
utilization than a nail salon.
Looking at trends within individual metrics makes sense — improving values
at all tiers is a healthy thing. Give special credit to consistent improvement
through business cycles. Depending on the industry, you may balance
emphasis on inventory, accounts receivable, and fixed assets differently. And
it never hurts to compare companies to other companies, so long as you’re
comparing apples to apples.
Looking at capital structure
When looking at capital structure, you’re trying to determine two things:
 Is the business a consumer or producer of capital? Does it constantly
require capital infusions to build growth or replace assets?
 Is the business properly leveraged? Overleveraged businesses are at risk
and additionally burden earnings with interest payments.
Underleveraged businesses, while better than overleveraged, may not
be maximizing potential returns to shareholders.
Assets/equity
The first-tier measure for capital structure is assets/equity. Per dollar of
owners’ equity invested, how many dollars of productive assets are deployed
in the business? For the second-tier evaluation, the key questions are “Is
more capital needed?” and “Is the company properly leveraged?”
Capital sufficiency
Capital-hungry companies are sometimes hard to detect, but there are a few
obvious signs. Companies in capital-intensive industries, such as manufactur-
ing, transportation, or telecommunications, are likely suspects. Here are a
few indicators:
 Share buybacks: The number of shares outstanding can be a simple
indicator of a capital-hungry company. A company using cash to retire
shares — if acting sensibly — is telling you that it generates more capital
than it needs.
When evaluating share buybacks, make sure to look at actual shares out-
standing. Relying on company news releases alone can be misleading.
Companies also buy back shares to support employee incentive programs
or to accumulate shares for an acquisition. Such repurchases may be
okay but aren’t the kind of repurchases that increase return on equity
for remaining owners.
605
Chapter 4: Valuing a Business
Book VII
Value
Investing

 Cash flow ratio: Pay attention to the cash flow ratio (refer to Chapter 3),
which shows whether cash flow from operations is enough to meet
investing and financing requirements (in this case, the repayment of
debt). If not, it’s back to the capital markets. This figure is pretty elusive
unless you have — and study — statements of cash flow.
 Lengthening asset cycles: If accounts receivable collection periods and
inventory holding periods are lengthening, that forewarns the need for
more capital.
 Working capital: A company requiring steady increases in working capital
to support sales requires, naturally, capital. Working capital is capital.
Leverage
Some debt is usually regarded as a good thing because it expands the size of
the business and hence the return on owner capital. But too much is too much.
Guiding principles include comparative analysis and vulnerability to down-
turns. Debt must always be paid back, whether business is good or not — so
debt stops being okay when it’s too large to cover during a downturn or business
strategy change. Here are a couple supporting metrics:
 Debt to equity: This old standard is used over and over to get a feel for
indebtedness and particularly for industry comparison. The calculation
is simple, but remember that it refers to long-term debt. A deteriorating
D/E over time is a bad sign unless you understand the context. A wors-
ening D/E without a reduction in shares is less healthy.
 Interest coverage: One way to look at whether a business has the right
amount of debt is to look at how much of its earnings are consumed to
service (pay interest on) it. Interest coverage is the ratio of earnings to
annual interest, a rough indication of how solvent or burdened a com-
pany is by debt.
Quality checks
As you evaluate all the other measures of productivity, keep a look out for
these, which can let you know whether the company has an insatiable
demand for capital:
 Current assets (besides cash) rising faster than business: More receiv-
ables result from extending credit, while losing channel structure and
supply chain battles (customers and distributors won’t carry inventory,
suppliers are making them carry more inventory) result in increased
inventories. The risk is greater capital requirements and expensive
impairments downstream.
606
Book VII: Value Investing 

 Debt growing faster than business: Over a sustained period, debt rising
faster than business growth is a problem. If the owners won’t kick in to
grow the business, and if retained earnings aren’t sufficient to meet growth,
what does that tell you?
 Repeated financings: If the business continually has to approach the
capital markets (other than in startup phases), that again is a sign that
internally generated earnings and cash flows aren’t sufficient.
Intangibles
Several intangibles enter in here:
 Credit ratings and changes in credit ratings: Declining credit ratings
mean that someone somewhere is less secure with the capital structure
as currently deployed.
 Capital intensity, particularly changes in capital intensity: The semi-
conductor business happily churning out DRAM chips becomes less
happy when equipment must be replaced with more expensive equip-
ment more often. Such shortening product cycles can similarly stoke the
capital requirement fires for software companies and the like.
 Quality: A company that faces its finances head on is in better shape
than one that plays games, delays write-downs, uses good debt to
finance bad assets, and the like. There are specific indicators and a lot of
general ones, such as the thickness of 10-K reports (refer to Chapter 2),
the tone of press coverage, the departure of CFOs, and so forth.
Evaluating strategic intangibles
Warren Buffett once famously said: “If you gave me $100 billion and said ‘take
away the soft drink leadership of Coca-Cola in the world,’ I’d give it back to
you and say it can’t be done.” This quote underlies the essence of strategic
intangibles: the difference between a business and a mere set of assets and
liabilities.
Intangibles come in all shapes and sizes. Every company has different intangi-
bles. This section discusses marketing and management tenets that separate
great from good, focusing on those that are clearly strategic in the creation of
value in the business and return for the shareholders. So much of what
makes excellent businesses excellent transcends the arcane world of facto-
ries, storefronts, products, and packages. And most of it can be controlled or
influenced by good management.

Market power
Market power is all about advantage. Market power is strength in franchise,
brand, customer base, supply chain power, or other competence that gives
the company an advantage in the marketplace. Advantage drives and pro-
tects the first component of ROE: profitability.
The franchise factor
A franchise is an established, sustainable, powerful position in a market (not
to be confused with the term’s other meaning: the one you can buy from a
restaurant or convenience store chain allowing you to sell merchandise or
services under someone else’s logo). Franchise is probably the most valuable
asset a business can have. Coca-Cola is the classic case of the franchise, a sit-
uation in which the power of the brand and the reputation of the company
have created a near-unassailable fortress around the production and sale of
flavored sugar water.
Franchises also create barriers to entry (called “creating a moat”). If you can
grill burgers, you can set up a hamburger stand, but can you set up a
McDonald’s? Would anyone come? “Creating a moat” describes franchise
power that keeps competitors away — and keeps the business and its funda-
mentals moving in the right direction. What determines the width and depth
of a moat? The following sections explain.
The brand centerpiece
One external manifestation of the marketing machine that creates enduring
value is the brand. Brands are built over time through a combination of good
products and good presentation of those products to the marketplace. Key
factors that define a brand include:
 Image: How the public perceives the brand in the marketplace. This
perception relates not only to product quality but also with the ideas
and images that people associate with the company. People tend to
associate Wrangler with rugged Western jeans, for example, and Harley-
Davidson with rugged individualism.
 Familiarity: Familiarity creates mindshare, drives repeat or habitual
purchase, and creates barriers for entry. Most value investors place a
high value on habitual repeat purchase.
 Reputation: Reputation builds slowly over time and provides a powerful
umbrella giving storm shelter when other things go wrong. But it must
be nurtured and handled with care. When considering companies to
invest in, look for businesses that manage their mistakes well.
Brand can tell a lot about a company’s value. It’s up to you to decide how
valuable the brand is in the marketplace both today and in the future.
608
Book VII: Value Investing 

Market share and leadership
Market leadership means that a company defines the market, sets the pace in
price and product, and (usually) is tied to a strong brand. Market leadership
often leads to cost advantages through buying power and economies of scale.
To evaluate market share and leadership, look for two things: (1) to what
degree does the business possess market share and leadership and (2) does
it do the right things and have the right attitude to maintain its market posi-
tion and grow it?
Customer base
A company with a loyal customer base can depend on repeat sales and spend
less money acquiring new customers. Profitability increases through lower
marketing costs and repeat sales driven other than by price. A business treat-
ing a customer base as an asset is more successful than one that treats it as a
liability. Score for strong, loyal customer base and business strategies that
employ the customer base as an asset and capitalize on it. Don’t forget that
this applies to business-to-business companies, not only to consumer busi-
nesses.
Special competencies
Does the company have some kind of infrastructure, business model, or tech-
nology that’s difficult to duplicate? Does it have the best search engine or
most innovative designs or best support available? Does it have special
knowledge, experience, or intellectual capital that others don’t have? Score a
plus if this is the case.
The supply chain
Look at the degree of control a company exerts over its suppliers as well as
its distribution channels. Also pay attention to how much influence a com-
pany has on stability, sustainable and growable sales, and stable costs. A
company that can economically sell directly to its customers may have an
advantage.
All about management
Just as important as market power, company management is another intangi-
ble pillar. Four attributes indicate management excellence:
 Competence: Does management have the right vision, make the right
decisions, and offer good reasons for those decisions? Does it make sound
investments in existing businesses? In new businesses? Does it under-
stand — and control — expenses? Does it make changes when changes
should be made, being neither too eager nor too reluctant to make them?
Does it make reasonable projections about growth and earnings? I could
go on and on, but suffice it to say that good management understands the
business, has a realistic view of it, has a solid rationale behind strategies
and decisions, and employs resources wisely within it.
609
Chapter 4: Valuing a Business
Book VII
Value
Investing

 Candor: Value investors like managers who communicate quickly and
honestly about business issues and problems — and without undue
spin, jargon or buzzwords. These managers disclose as much data as
they can about their businesses, including information about sector per-
formance, unit productivity, and key strategies and investments. Along
with candor, a little of the right attitude goes a long way. Arrogant man-
agers who hide problems, think they can solve them all, or think they
are invincible are bound for trouble.
 Independence: Good management teams think and act independently
and for the long-term health of the business, and they resist the temptation
to pour energy and resources into achieving this quarter’s results. They
have a vision, a mission, and a plan and follow them, avoiding distractions.
 Customer focus: A management team focused on customers is more likely
to succeed than one focused on its internal issues and on competitors.
Evaluating management excellence can be tricky. You don’t sit or work with
these managers on a daily basis; in fact, much of what they do is deliberately
kept secret. Solid information about a company’s management is usually hard
to find. Yet, a sensitive antenna can pick up a lot over a period of time. Yahoo!
Finance provides links to the bios and executive compensation of manage-
ment. Read the paper and watch corporate communications and press
releases to catch the buzz about a company’s management.
Ownership
By looking at a company’s ownership, particularly those who own the largest
pieces of the business, you can discover something of the attractiveness of
the business to others — and to its own management.
 Management as owners: Management ownership reflects management
commitment. One of the best places to find out what insiders own and what
they’re doing with their holdings is Yahoo! Finance and its “Insider Roster”
and “Insider Transactions” pages. You can also refer to company publications,
including annual reports, but these may be a little less current.
 Institutions as owners: Yahoo! Finance under the “Major Holders” tab
shows the top ten institutional shareholders — usually large banks, pension
funds, or trusts. The larger the holdings, and the more blue chip the
names, the better. You can also see whether institutions have been
buying, but realize that this data may be outdated.
 Mutual funds as owners: Yahoo! Finance (again under the “Major
Holders” tab) shows the top ten largest mutual fund holders. Look for
who, how much, and what kind of fund. If the top ten funds all are value
funds, that may be a good sign.

Book VII: Value Investing 

Deciding When the Price Is Right
Sooner or later, price enters the value equation. By far, the most popular valu-
ation tool is the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which is one of the major ways
that investors make sense of the price tag. This section explores how you can
use P/E to price a business.
There is no formula for applying P/E. “If it’s 17 you buy, and if it’s 25 you sell”
doesn’t work. A deeper understanding of the P/E and underlying fundamen-
tals is required. The following sections provide some of that depth by devel-
oping a better understanding of the P/E measure and what it really means.
Earnings yield
What is P/E? It is the ratio of share price to earnings. But there’s more infor-
mation than meets the eye. First, P/E tells how many years it would take to
recoup an investment, with earnings staying the same. A P/E of 17 means that
with flat earnings, it would take 17 years to recover your investment. A P/E of
40 means 40 years. But a greater revelation occurs when we turn the ratio
upside down. The inverse ratio (earnings yield) tells the annual percentage
return implied by the P/E. It is simply 1/(P/E).
If P/E is 10, then 1/(P/E) is 0.1 or 10 percent. If P/E is 40, then 1/(P/E) is 0.025
or 2.5 percent. This figure is the equivalent yield the investor would use to
compare this earnings stream to, suppose, a bond. A bond returning $5 on a
face value of $100 yields 5 percent. A stock returning $5 in earnings on $100
invested (stock price) could also be said to yield 5 percent and would have a
P/E ratio of 20 ($100 ÷ $5). Table 4-1 is one of the simpler math tables you’ll
see in value investing; it illustrates the wide range of investment yields
implied by different P/E ratios.

P/E and growth
Of course, it would be nice if looking at price, P/E, and earnings yield was all
there was to it. Find an earnings yield of 6 percent (P/E of 17), beat the bond,
and move on. But you’re buying equities, not bonds, because you want to
participate in company growth and success.
Assessing growth is a major factor in analyzing a stock price through P/E. What
is the earnings yield today, what will it be in the future, and how does it get into
the equation? Table 4-2 shows future earnings yields realized in the case of a
bond with no growth versus a stock with a 10 percent earnings growth.

A PEG in a poke
By itself, it’s hard to tell whether a P/E is good or bad. A stock with a P/E of
30 may be a better deal than another stock with a P/E of 15 because of growth.
A stock of a no-growth company with a P/E of 15 will never achieve an earnings
yield beyond 7.5 percent (1/15). Meanwhile the company with a P/E of 30, with
a growth rate of 20 percent, eventually achieves an earnings yield greater than
20 percent.
Enter the price-earnings to growth or PEG ratio, which is introduced in Chapter 3.
PEG normalizes the P/E to the growth rate. With PEG, apparently high P/E
ratios are supported by look-ahead growth. PEG thus becomes a better tool
to compare stocks with different P/Es and different underlying growth
assumptions. In the PEG ratio, you divide all P/Es by the company’s growth
rate. G is the growth rate, expressed as a whole number (that is, the percent-
age times 100). So a company with a P/E of 30 and a growth rate of 20 percent
has a PEG of 1.5.
PEG gives you a standard for comparison. Company A with a P/E of 18 and a
growth rate of 12 percent has the same PEG as Company B with a P/E of 30
and a growth rate of 20 percent. Although the two P/Es aren’t the same (30
versus 18), the PEG ratio reveals that they are indeed priced equally.
Table 4-3 show the relationship between future earnings yield, P/E, and PEG.
Watch what happens to PEG and future earnings yields as growth assumptions
rise. Low PEG ratios (less than 2) correspond to high future earnings yields.

So what is a “good” PEG ratio? It all depends on the implied future rate of
return you’re looking for, which depends on investment objectives, risk toler-
ance, and current risk-free (bond) interest rates.
Hurdle rates and the 15 percent rule
Warren Buffett looks at P/E and growth in a slightly different way, using so-
called hurdle rates. A hurdle rate is what the name implies: a minimum level
of compounded annual returns, or a “bar” over which a business — and thus
a stock price — must be able to appreciate to be deemed a good investment.
Part of Buffett’s thought process is this: If an investment cannot clear a given
hurdle, the capital is probably better deployed elsewhere.
Buffett is known to use a 15 percent rule is to determine if a stock’s price can
feasibly grow at a minimum annual compounded rate, or hurdle rate. The
analysis examines current stock price, earnings growth, and potential future
stock price based on that growth. If the growth-supported future stock price
can appreciate at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) meeting or
exceeding the hurdle rate, it is in buy territory. If appreciation potential is
short of the required price growth hurdle, the stock is rejected. Either the
current stock price is too high or the projected growth is too weak to meet
the growth hurdle.
At the risk of providing an oversimplified example, consider Coca-Cola, which
recently sold for $60.50 with annual earnings of $2.34, a P/E ratio of 25.9 and
an annual earnings growth rate of 13.3 percent.
The earnings growth rate is quite healthy for a company the size of Coca-
Cola, a $28 billion company in annual sales. But the fact that earnings growth
trails the hurdle rate, and that the P/E exceeds market averages (about 18 for
the S&P 500 at the time), and that earnings yield is under 4 percent, you
would be skeptical of Coke as an investment.
Taking the calculation further, you might project what Coke’s EPS would be
after 10 years:
$2.34 × (1 + 0.133)10 = $8.16
Then, calculate the stock price appreciation necessary to meet the 15 percent
hurdle:
$60.50 × (1 + 0.15)10 = $244.75
Then, calculate the implied P/E in ten years:
$244.75 ÷ $8.16, or 30
614
Book VII: Value Investing 

The stock would have to command a P/E of 30 after ten years, despite grow-
ing dramatically to reach that level — a P/E that is in all probability unrealis-
tic. Put differently, the stock price is unlikely to grow at 15 percent given the
assumptions made. Either earnings growth would have to exceed the current
expectation, or the current stock price would have to be lower, to make the
15 percent hurdle.
So using this approach, you would probably reject the investment at the cur-
rent price.
Before rejecting Coke altogether, you must consider whether the 13.3 percent
earnings growth rate is really right. If sales, profitability, and/or productivity
are in for major improvement, Coke could still be a good buy. The very strong
26 percent gross margins and 29 percent ROE tell an unusually good story.
Don’t forget the fundamentals underlying earnings and earnings growth.
A Practical Approach
Throughout the four chapters presented in this book, you’ve been exposed to
many of the tools — and, more importantly, the thought processes — of
today’s value investor.
At the end of the day, value investors develop their own customized
approach to analyzing a business and an investment, derived from these
tools and thought processes — an approach that works for them. It works
because it makes sense, and as it gets fine-tuned over time, it works from
experience.
Many value investors, especially in the beginning, make checklists to help
evaluate financial and intangible features of business. They evaluate each
business opportunity as if they were attempting to buy the business, looking
at assets, profits, growth, customer base, market presence, and management
quality as if they were going to have to live with it for a while.
It’s not unlike the approach a rational, numbers-oriented buyer might use to
buy a car: look at features and performance data, then test-drive it to see if it all
works well together, to see if the whole is at least equal to (preferably better
than) the sum of the parts. And yes, the tires are kicked and the doors are
opened and closed to check for obvious problems and complete the impression.
And the car is carefully compared to other cars in the category — all before
talking to the dealer or owner about price.

Over time, you’ll get better at and more comfortable with the value investing
approach. You’ll learn what to look for so you don’t have to get down to
every detail of horsepower and gear ratios. Experienced value investors do
the diligence, but they learn what’s most important to look at in a business as
they learn the industry and other similar businesses. Buffett is famous for
doing most of his analysis in his head; like most business owners, you’ll get
to the point where you can do a lot in your head, too.
Remember: At the end of the day, the thought process is just as important as
the mechanics, if not more so.

et ready to suspend belief in everything you think you know about trading
and investing. Technical analysis, a set of forecasting methods that can
help you make better trading decisions, focuses on the price of a security
rather than the fundamentals of the company behind the security. In technical
analysis, you observe how prices actually move and try to use past regularities
in price movements to predict future regularities. Basically it’s a way of charting
price trends so that you can make rational trading decisions that bypass greed,
fear, and the other emotions that often accompany trading.
Technical Analysis Defined: Observing
Prices Directly
Technical analysis is the study of how securities prices behave and how to
exploit that information to make money while avoiding losses. Basically, with
technical analysis, you work to identify price trends (a trend is a discernible
directional bias in the price — upwards, downwards, or sideways). Following
are the basic observations underlying technical analysis:
 Securities prices move in trends much of the time, and trends remain in
place until some major event comes along to stop them.

Prices incorporate (or discount) all known information about the security,
and prices change as new information becomes available. All known
information consists of hundreds of factors ranging from accurate facts
to opinions, guesses, and emotions — and previous prices. They all go
into the supply and demand for a security and result in its price.
 Trends can be identified with patterns that you see repeatedly and with
support and resistance trendlines (both are covered in Chapter 4).
 Primary trends (lasting months or years) are punctuated by secondary
movements (lasting weeks or months) in the opposite direction of the
primary trend. Secondary trends, or retracements, are the very devil to
deal with as a trader. See the later section “Retracements” for details.
Your goal is to forecast the price of the security over some future time hori-
zon in order to buy and sell the security to make a cash profit. The emphasis
in technical analysis is to make profits from trading, not from owning a secu-
rity as some kind of savings vehicle, although long-term investors use techni-
cal analysis as well.
Charting course
Because in technical analysis prices and trends rule, you have to be able to
track and identify them. Although technical analysts have developed numerous
indicators based on price and volume that can be expressed as statistics,
tables of numbers, and other formats, you’ll spend most of your time looking
at charts, like the one shown in Figure 1-1 which illustrates a classic uptrend
following a downtrend.

Book VIII: Technical Analysis 

At the most basic level, your goal is to shun the security shown on the chart
while it’s downtrending and to identify the key reversal point — which is the
best place to buy — as early as possible. To do this successfully, you absolutely,
positively must become attuned to looking at charts and trying to figure out
what the prices are telling you.
A chart is the workspace of technical analysis. Technical analysts have devel-
oped numerous indicators based on price and volume that can be expressed
as statistics, tables of numbers, and other formats, but the core method
remains a graphic display of prices on a chart.
Uncovering the essence 
of market movements
Securities are different from cars, bread, and socks. You don’t buy a security
for the joy of owning it and using it. The main reason to buy a security is to
sell it again, preferably for more than you paid for it.
In securities trading, the pricing process is more like an auction than the tra-
ditional price-discovery process of classical economics, in which demand for
an item depends on its price: If something is rare, it’s expensive. At higher
and higher prices, demand falls off. At some point, the high price induces
suppliers to produce more of the thing, whereupon the price falls. The price-
discovery process can be lengthy.
In auction economics, demand increases as the price rises. The item may or
may not be scarce in the real world — it doesn’t matter. The immediacy of
the auction is what skews prices, sometimes to absurd levels. Later, when
suppliers see the high prices, they may indeed be able to find or produce
more of the item — but by then, the specific demand dynamic of that one
auction is gone.
When you decide to buy a security, it’s because you think the price will rise.
When you decide to sell, it’s because you have a juicy profit that meets your
needs, or because you have taken an intolerable loss. You seldom think about
the true supply of the security. And, in fact, while the supply of any security
is limited by the number of shares outstanding and the like, supply may be
considered infinite for all practical purposes, because a price exists at which
you can induce someone to sell you what you want.
In technical trading, think of demand for a security as rising on rising prices,
not falling ones. Similarly, the supply of a security dries up on rising prices, at
least in the short run.
621

Technical
Analysis

Figuring Out What’s Normal: 
Drawing a Market Profile
Technical analysis can be categorized broadly as falling into four categories:
 Analyzing patterns (double tops ands bottoms, for example; see Chapter 4)
 Trend-following methods (moving averages and trendlines, for example;
see Chapter 4)
 Character-of-market analysis (oscillators like Relative Strength Indicator
[RSI], for example)
 Structural theories
Structural theories include the broadest measures of market behavior, like
seasonality (which I discuss later in this chapter). The most inclusive of the
structural theories is market profile.
Each crowd, whether a fraternity or a gang, develops criteria for normal
behavior. The secret vocabulary of traders in a specific security or class of
securities takes the form of prices changing by a certain amount over a
period of time (usually one day, one week, and one month). The crowd that
trades a specific security, for example, knows that the average daily range of
prices between the high and low of the day is normally some specific amount.
Market profile is a technique for analyzing the normal behavior of the crowd
while in the process of trading a security. Using a fictitious security, Figure 1-2
shows trading during a particular day. Each X stands for blocks of shares
traded. All the Xs add up to the volume figure for the day — the number of
shares or contracts traded, as reported by the exchange. The number of
shares or contracts is recorded according to the price associated with them
and the time of day the transactions took place.
As you can see, the price ranged from $8 (the low) to $11 (the high) on that
day, with the average price at $9.50. (Note that in this instance, the arithmetic
average is the same thing as the mode, which is the price that occurs most
frequently. This isn’t always the case, and if you pursue this method of look-
ing at markets, you’ll have to deal with situations where the average differs
from the mode.)
Turn the page sideways. Do you see the outline of a shape in this price distrib-
ution? If you’ve ever sat through a statistics class, you may be able to pick out
the bell-shaped normal distribution curve. It’s called a normal distribution because
you can use it to describe a set of data that varies around an average value.
622
Book VIII: Technical Analysis 

Explaining the standard deviation
Prices clustered around the average are normal and represent the market
consensus of the rough equilibrium price for that day. The normal prices
deviate by only one unit from the average in each direction: higher or lower.
This unit is named a standard deviation.
The standard deviation region in Figure 1-2 is symmetrical — when you use a
normal distribution curve, you assume that an equal number of prices will
fall on each side of the average. This isn’t always true, of course. Prices are
trended at least some of the time, and so if the price is on a generally rising
trend, expect to see the distribution curve skewed to one side, to the higher
prices. You’ll also see days on which the prices form a double hump or are
just flat across the daily range.

Technical
Analysis

Statisticians say that securities prices aren’t actually normally distributed;
they just look that way sometimes. You risk making unwarranted assumptions
if you apply the normal distribution concept uncritically. Still, the main point
of market profile is that you can often track crowd behavior as it is happening
to determine whether bullish sentiment is winning out over bearish sentiment,
or vice versa.
Trading normalcy
The prices that occur in the outer tails of the curve are, statistically speaking,
abnormal. In the example in Figure 1-2, only about one-third of prices stray so
far away from the average.
Say that, after writing down each trade on a chart, you see that early in the
day, the price moves from $8 to the average, $9.50, which is still in the process
of being established. Only a few prices have appeared on the high side of the
price range. From studying past days and weeks of data, you already know
that the average daily trading range of the security is $3. (See Chapter 2 for a
discussion of the trading range.) You guess that if the trading is normal that
day (consistent with the average over the past several days or weeks), you’ll
be able to buy under or near the average of $9.50 and sell near the expected
high, $11. In fact, after you see that the trades are starting to average $9.50, if you
see an offer at the cheap end of the range, $8, you jump on it, thus improving
your net profit if you’re able to sell at the high end of the range later in the day.
Using market profile to make 
trading decisions
Market profile isn’t, technically speaking, a buy/sell indicator. It’s a way of
visually organizing price and volume data to give you a perspective on how
traders feel over the course of the day. If you start entering a lot of entries
down around $8 later in the day, for example, what you’re seeing is a shift in
sentiment to the bearish side. How you interpret that information is up to
you. You have two choices:
 Buy some more: The market is temporarily undervaluing the security.
You expect normalcy to return. You still expect to see the average at
$9.50, and you still hope to see the price extreme of $11.
 Sell: Sentiment is going against you. When you see prices develop in the
tail, you’re seeing a price extreme. Price extremes are abnormal and can
mark the beginning of a trend. In fact, a trending market is characterized
by fat tails, meaning a lot of volume occurring at the edge of the normal
price range.
624
Book VIII: Technical Analysis 

Your choice depends on the information you’re getting from technical indicators.
For example, you can use market profile together with moving averages or
momentum to estimate whether a trend is forming, weakening, or strengthening.
Crowd Extremes and What 
to Do about Them
Technical analysis is the art of identifying crowd behavior in order to join the
crowd and take advantage of its momentum. This is called the bandwagon
effect. Here’s how a bandwagon works: A fresh piece of news comes out, a
majority of traders interpret it as favorable to the security, and buying over-
whelms selling so that the price rises. You profit by going with the flow. Then
when everyone is jumping off the bandwagon, you jump, too.
625

A word about manias and panics
People behave differently when they act as indi-
viduals from the way they act when they’re part
of a crowd in which otherwise sensible individ-
uals can behave in the most extraordinary
ways. If someone shouts “Fire!” in a crowded
theater, people will trample each other to get to
the exits; if someone shouts “Free ice cream!”
people will fall all over each other to be first in
line. In markets, you see the same thing. Prices
fall as traders abandon a security after bad news
about it is released. If an authority figure pro-
nounces the security a gem and a bargain, secu-
rities prices reach new highs as people flock to
them. As a technical trader, you want to be sen-
sitive to what the crowd is doing without suc-
cumbing to the ruling passions of the crowd itself.
A mania is a situation in which traders buy an
object or security without regard for its intrinsic
value or even whether they’ll be able to sell it
again later at a higher price. They fear being left
out of an opportunity. They’re caught up in the
moment and temporarily irrational. A panic is
the opposite — people can’t sell the thing fast
enough and will accept ever-lower prices just
to get any money back at all.
In economic history, a mania or a panic comes
along only a few times in a century. In the tech-
nical worldview, mania and panic happen every
day, in miniature. Emotional extremes lead to
price extremes in the context of the hour, day,
or week — minimanias and minipanics occur all
the time. Those aren’t the words used in techni-
cal trading lingo, but the emotion and the price
effects are the same as in big-picture manias
and panics.
Technical traders work hard at not listening to
chatter about securities, even from authority fig-
ures. You’re unlikely to get useful information —
and you may get disinformation (deliberately mis-
leading information as some traders invent
rumors to try to create a stampede in either
direction). All the information you need is embed-
ded in the price. When you do check the news
for the cause of a price action, be sure to do so
with a healthy dose of skepticism.

As market participants get excited about a security, they become increasingly
bullish and either buy for the first time or add to positions, a phase named
accumulation. When traders become disillusioned about the prospect of their
security price rising, they sell, in a phase named distribution. To buy 100 shares
of a stock is to enter a position. To buy another 100 shares for a total of 200 is to
add to your position. If you have 500 shares and sell half, you would be reducing
your position. To sell all the shares you own is to square your position. When
you’re square (also called flat), you have no position in the security. All your
money is in cash. You’re neutral.
After traders have been accumulating the security on rising prices, eventually
the price goes too far. Too far is a relative term and can be defined in any
number of equally valid ways, but basically it means any price extreme that’s
wildly abnormal, statistically speaking.
Overbought and oversold
When a price has reached or surpassed a normal limit, it’s at an extreme. In
an upmove, everyone who wanted to buy has already bought. The market is
called overbought, a term specific to securities trading. In a downmove, everyone
who wanted to sell has already sold. The security is called oversold. The
concept of overbought/oversold is applied to market indices as well as individ-
ual securities. It’s usually measured by the momentum indicators described in
the section “Examining how indicators work,” later in this chapter.
By the time most of the market participants have jumped on the bandwagon,
it has become so heavy it can’t move forward. Traders are tapped out. All
their money is in a position. Traders have to square their positions just to
put cash back into their pockets so they can conduct additional trades.
Retracements
When a price has gone too far and traders deem the security overbought or
oversold, the price stops rising or falling. Instead of hovering at a particular
level, however, the price moves in the opposite direction for a while. A move
in the opposite direction of the main trend is named a retracement. (Other
names for it are correction, which explicitly recognizes that the security had
gone too far and is now correcting course, pullback, or throwback.)
626
Book VIII: Technical Analysis 

Recognizing a retracement
Prices seldom move in one direction for long. Even a major trend exhibits
retracements. When the market runs out of cash, traders have to close positions
to get their cash back so they can put on new trades. If they’ve been buyers, they
need to sell. If they’ve been sellers (shorting the security), they need to buy.
Position squaring always causes a price move in the opposite direction of the
trend. Therefore, at the extreme outside limit of a price move, you should expect
a temporary, minor reversal of the previous price move. In an uptrend, a
retracement is always a drop in price. In a downtrend, a retracement is
always a rise in price.
Figure 1-3 shows a primary trend with several retracements, each outlined by
an ellipse. In this instance, the retracements last only a day or two — but
retracements can last a lot longer, several weeks on a daily chart, for exam-
ple. They can also retrace over more ground.
At the time a retracement starts, you don’t know for sure that it is a retracement.
For all you know, it could be a full reversal, with the price switching direction.
This is one of the occasions when it pays to check the fundamentals (the news
and events pertaining to the security). An ordinary retracement caused by normal
position squaring can suddenly turn into a full-fledged rout in the opposite
direction if fresh news come out that seems to support a reversal.

ments.

Catch a falling knife: Estimating when a retracement will end
To try to estimate where a retracement will stop is called “to catch a falling
knife.” Unfortunately, no reliable rules exist to tell you where a trend correc-
tion will end or when the primary trend will resume. One of the chief uses of
indicators and combined indicators is to get guidance on where and when a
retracement will stop.
Your tolerance for retracements is the key to deciding what time frame you
want to trade in. If the security you want to trade regularly retraces 50 per-
cent and the prospect of losing 51 percent turns you into a nervous wreck,
you need to trade it in a shorter time frame — or find another security.
Acknowledging that no one can forecast a retracement hasn’t stopped techni-
cal traders from trying to establish forecast rules. The following rules are
generally helpful, but no one can offer statistics to back them up, so take
them with a grain of salt:
 A retracement won’t exceed a significant prior high or low. In Figure 1-3,
for example, the second retracement doesn’t challenge the lowest low of
the first dip, and the third retracement doesn’t challenge the second.
 Look for round numbers. Research shows that support and resistance
levels (see Chapter 4) occur more often at round numbers than chance
would allow.
 The 30 percent rule. Measure the percentage change and assume that a
majority of traders will place stops to avoid losing more than x percent,
such as 30 percent. The problem with this idea, and it’s a chilling one, is
that you’re measuring from a peak and you don’t know the price level
where the majority of traders entered.
Looking at Market Sentiment
In technical analysis, sentiment comes in only two flavors — bullish (the
price is going up) or bearish (the price is going down). At any moment in
time, a bullish crowd can take a price upward or a bearish crowd can take it
downward. When the balance of sentiment shifts from bullish to bearish (or
vice versa), a pivot point emerges. A pivot point is the point (or a region)
where an upmove ends and a downmove begins (or the other way around).
At the pivot point, the crowd itself realizes that it has gone to an extreme,
and it reacts by heading in the opposite direction. Another term for pivot
point is key reversal.
When the crowd is reaching an extreme of emotion, it’s usually wrong. A
reversal point is impending. You should do the opposite of what the crowd is
doing, or at least get ready to.
628
Book VIII: Technical Analysis 

Tracking volume
Volume, the number of shares or contracts of a security traded in a period, is
the most powerful confirming indicator of a price move, and confirmation is a
key concept in technical analysis.
You can feel more confident that a price move has staying power if you know
that many traders are involved in a price move and not just one or two. In
technical trading, therefore, you use volume to measure the extent of trader
participation. When a price rise is accompanied by rising volume, you have
confirmation that the direction is associated with participation. Similarly, if
you see a price fall by a large amount, but the change isn’t accompanied by a
change in volume, you can deduce that the price change was an aberration.
Some trader made a mistake.
Leading the way with spikes
Volume sometimes leads price. The most obvious situations are when volume
spikes. A spike is a volume number that is double or more the size of volume
on the preceding days. Say volume has been running at 100,000 shares per
day for several days or weeks and suddenly it explodes to 500,000 shares. If
the price had been in a downtrend, this wild increase in volume means that
the crowd is throwing in the towel and exiting en masse.
A volume spike is one of the occasions when fundamental information is com-
plementary to a technical observation. In the case of a price making new
highs coupled with a volume spike where you discover that no fresh news or
fundamental information prompted new buyers to come on the scene, be
wary. Chances are the top is in. If the security has new, legitimately exciting
news and you can reasonably deduce that it attracted new buyers, you have
a non-technical reason to ignore the usual spike interpretation.
Tracking on-balance volume
On-balance volume (OBV) is a running (cumulative) total of volume, calcu-
lated by adding the volume on days the price is higher than the day before
and subtracting the volume on days the price is lower than the day before.
The logic goes like this: At the simplest level, when the price closes higher
than the day before, demand was greater than supply at each price level.
Buyers had to offer higher prices to get holders to part with their shares. You
can attribute all the volume on a higher-close day to net buying and all the
volume on a lower-close day to net selling. Figure 1-4, which shows IBM
stock, indicates daily prices in the top part, volume (in hundreds of thou-
sands of shares) in the center, and the OBV indicator in the bottom window.
629
Chapter 1: Wrapping Your Brain around Technical Analysis
Book VIII
Technical
Analysis

OBV doesn’t work all the time, but a change in the indicator often precedes a
change in the price. Using Figure 1-4, you can see how to use the OBV indica-
tor in two instances:
 The downmove: The price downmove, already in progress, is suddenly
accompanied by a big rise in volume. The increase in volume starts the
day before the downward gap. A falling price punctuated by a downward
gap is a message to the market that the price is going to fall some more.
In this case, the OBV indicator forecasts the impending bottom. It starts
to fall ahead of the volume spike and ahead of the gap. If you own the
stock and see the OBV indicator start to decline and then you see spiky
volume (like the area in the ellipse), you should sell. Holding on after the
downward gap is courting a fat loss.
 The upmove: OBV reaches its lowest levels about two weeks before
Pivot Day 1, which features the lowest low in the series of lower lows,
but a higher closing price and a gap upward the following day. Notice
that OBV is already rising while the price is still falling, a divergence that
is a critical clue to an impending change in the direction of the price.
The divergence of price and an indicator that normally rises and falls in
tandem with it is itself a wake-up call. A change in volume often predicts a
change in price. The indicator is telling you something you can’t see with the
naked eye — prices were putting in new lows, but prices weren’t consistently
closing lower than the day before. Buying and selling pressure, or supply and
demand, was reaching a balance. Your eye can see the price downmove, but
the indicator can detect the exhaustion of the sellers (supply).

Notice that after Pivot Day 1, the price puts in several gap days upward. This
is a message to the crowd to buy, and they do, leading to Pivot Day 2. If you
had bought IBM at the close on Pivot Day 1 and sold it one day after Pivot
Day 2 (when the OBV indicator turned downward), you would have made a
nice little profit.
Refining volume indicators
It’s not realistic to attribute all of the day’s volume to the accumulation
column just because the close today is higher than yesterday’s. It makes
more sense to attribute only a portion of the volume to the price rise. A more
representative amount would be the percentage equivalent of the price that
is above the midpoint of the day. A midpoint is calculated as the high of the
day plus the low of the day divided by two.
If a security closes above its midpoint for the day, bullish sentiment ruled.
The close over the midpoint defines accumulation, referring to buyers being
willing to pay higher prices to get sellers to part with the security. The closer
the closing price is to the high, the more bullish it was. If the price closed at
the high, then you say that 100 percent of the volume can be attributed to
bullish sentiment. A close below the price midpoint means distribution, sellers
willing to accept lower prices to induce buyers to buy. Lower prices imply
bearish sentiment. The closer the closing price is to the low, the more distrib-
ution there was. If the close is exactly at the midpoint, then the indicator has
the same value as yesterday — you have no reason to add or subtract
volume from the running total.
Understanding market effects
Some percentage of any security’s price move (how much exactly nobody
knows for sure) is attributable to changes in the market environment:
 Securities: Factors impacting price include not only the index to which a
particular security belongs, but also its size (large cap or small cap, for
example) and sector (biotech, high-tech, no-tech). About 25 percent of a
price move in any single issue should be considered a function of what
is going on in its index (or other benchmark to which the issue belongs).
 Commodities: Some portion of the price move in a commodity is a function
of the price move of the overall commodity indices, like the Commodity
Research Bureau index (CRB).
 Currencies: In currencies, the benchmark is something called the dollar
index, a price average comprised of individual currency prices weighted
by their countries’ share of trade with the United States and published by
the Federal Reserve.
631

Overall, the market environment has a magnetic effect on individual compo-
nents. You may have the inside scoop on the best stock ever, but if the entire
market has a case of the collywobbles, your best-ever stock is likely to fall,
too. Conversely, when the market is in a manic phase, even the worst of
stocks gets a boost.
To get a handle on possible market effects on your specific security, measure
overall market sentiment by looking at market statistics. Strictly speaking,
market statistics are not technical analysis, which is the study of how spe-
cific prices behave. Nevertheless, sentiment measures can be very helpful as
a supplement and complement to work on your individual charts.
Sampling information about sentiment
Most sentiment indicators look outside the price dynamics of a particular
security or index of securities for information about whether the trading
crowd is humming along with expectations of normalcy or is willing to jump
ship. Following are a few outside sources you can use:
 Advisors: A service called Investors Intelligence measures the balance of
bullish sentiment against bearish sentiment (which it calls the bull/bear
ratio) and claims an excellent track record in predicting turning points. You
can find the bull/bear ratio and other indicators on hundreds of Web sites
and in business newspapers. To get a specific bull/bear ratio from a spe-
cific vendor the minute it’s published, you have to pay a subscription fee.
 Breadth indicators: Breadth indicators measure the degree of participation
by traders in the overall market represented by an index, such as the Dow
or NASDAQ. Breadth indicators include:
• The ratio of advancing to declining issues: This indicator mea-
sures the mood of the market. Stocks that are reaching a higher
price today than yesterday are called advancing issues. Stocks that
are reaching lower prices are called declining issues. When
advancers outnumber decliners, money is flowing into the market.
Bulls are beating bears. Sentiment is favorable.
• The difference between issues making new highs and those
making new lows: If more stocks in an index are closing at higher
prices than the period before, bullishness is on the rise. When a
higher number are putting in new lows, supply is overwhelming
demand and the mood is bearish.
 Put/call ratios: The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) is the
venue for options trading in equity indices like the S&P and NASDAQ
indices. The CBOE publishes the ratio of puts to calls. The put/call ratio
is an indicator of whether sentiment is bearish or bullish. A high put/call
ratio means bears are winning. The same line of thinking holds true for a
low put/call ratio: When emotions are running strongly optimistic, watch
632
Book VIII: Technical Analysis 

out for an opportunity to take advantage of a change. (Book III has more
information on put/call ratios.)
 Volatility index: Use the volatility index (VIX) as a contrary indicator.
When the crowd is feeling an extreme emotion, like anxiety, it’s usually
wrong. Therefore, a high VIX value means exactly the opposite of what it
seems to mean — the bottom isn’t coming, it’s already in! When VIX is
low, traders are complacent; they’re projecting the same price levels, or
nearly the same levels, into the immediate future with little variation and
therefore little risk. When VIX is either abnormally high or abnormally
low, you know it’s the right time to trade against the crowd.
Accounting for seasonality
Seasonality (also known as calendar effects) refers to the natural rise and fall
of prices according to the time of year. Heating oil futures go up as winter
heads for Chicago, for example, and prices of agricultural commodities rise
when the crop is poor and fall when farmers get a bumper crop. Interestingly,
equities and financial futures exhibit a similar effect: They change according
to the time of year. The changes are regular and consistent enough to warrant
your attention. Here are a few:
 Best six months rule: Nearly all the gains in the S&P 500 are made
between November 1 and April 30. This isn’t true without exception, but
it’s been true for most years since 1950. When April 30 rolls around, you
sell all your stocks and put the money in U.S. government Treasuries.
Come November 1, you reenter the stock market.

Contrarians and cranks
A true contrarian is someone who has a funda-
mental reason for thinking that a security is mis-
priced. In equities, a fundamental reason could
be insider knowledge that an out-of-favor phar-
maceutical company has secretly discovered
the cure for some important disease and its
price will shoot the moon when the announce-
ment comes out. In financial futures (stock
indices, bonds, and currencies), a fundamental
reason to judge a security mispriced may be an
in-depth analysis of a central bank interest rate
change that nobody else can see coming. A true
contrarian is quite rare, although lots of people
fancy themselves contrarians when they’re just
cranks. When a contrarian is right, he becomes
a zillionaire and is called eccentric. When he is
wrong, he stays poor and is called a crackpot.
In contrast, technical trading is by its very
nature non-contrarian. You want to go with the
crowd, not against it (most of the time).

This advice comes from work on calendar effects by Yale and Jeffrey
Hirsch, who tested the correlation of stock index prices with the time of
year in their annual Stock Trader’s Almanac. If you’d followed this rule
every year since 1950, a starting capital stake of $10,000 in 1952 would
have ballooned to $1,308,304 by 2003.
 January Barometer: When the S&P 500 is up in January, it’ll close the
year higher than it opened. Since 1950, this rule has an accuracy reading
of 92.5 percent.
 President’s Third Year: Since 1939, the third year of a presidential term
is always an up year for the Dow. In fact, going back 84 years, the only
big down year in the third year of a presidential term was 1931.
 Presidential Election Cycle: Wars, recessions, and bear markets tend to
start in the first two years, while prosperity and bull markets tend to
happen in the second two years. Since 1833, the last two years of a
president’s term produced a cumulative net gain in the Dow of 717.5
percent, while the first two years produced 227.6 percent.
You can discover the seasonality characteristics of any given stock by using
seasonality trackers on various Web sites, including the best-known seasonality
tracker, Thomson Financial (www.thomson.com). The Thomson Financial Web
site allows you to see a chart of any stock with its associated average returns
by month, starting in 1986. You can also see a table of the months in which
the stock rose or fell over the years.
Searching for Historic Key Reversals
One of the enduring mysteries of market history is that big key reversal points
come out of the blue. Seldom can you find a specific event that triggers a rally
taking off or a bubble bursting. Does that mean that historic key reversals occur
randomly? If so, why shouldn’t we say that all key reversals occur randomly?
Opinion is divided on the answer, and many people give up on technical
analysis at this point. If you never know when a major turning point is going
to hit you over the head with a hammer, how can you trust technical indica-
tors? The answer is that you can trust your indicators only up to a point, and
then your survival as a trader depends on risk management. In the meantime,
it’s important to have a useful way to think about randomness and not let it
overwhelm you.
Enduring randomness
Although the expectation is that prices will behave normally, random events
can and do cause the occasional wild price departure from the norm. For
634
Book VIII: Technical Analysis 

example, you sometimes see a price (named a spike) that is so far out of whack
you don’t know how to interpret it. A price spike is the equivalent of a tornado
in weather forecasting. We know the conditions that cause tornadoes — we
just don’t know exactly when an actual tornado will develop.
Who would have thought, for example, that the S&P 500 could fall more than
20 percent in a single day? Most market observers used to say it was impossi-
ble. But that’s exactly what happened on Black Monday, 1987. Most market
tornadoes, like Black Monday, give plenty of technical warnings ahead of time.
The problem is that those same warnings have existed during other periods
and don’t result in a Black Monday. This is an inconvenient fact of life that you
have to accept.
Neither sentiment indicators nor standard technical analysis is much help in
detecting the cataclysmic change from rally to crash.
Remembering the last price
In normal trading, you can assume that a wildly erratic price has a low
probability of occurring, yet such events have an impact on future prices. In
markets, a low-probability event changes the odds for the next period analysis.
This is because traders remember and form their trading plans on earlier prices.
The next price normally depends on preceding prices. Sometimes, all it takes is
one or two abnormal prices to alter the expectations of the trading crowd. If they
were bullish before, they become bearish now.
Using Chart Indicators
Technical traders go to great lengths to remove emotion and impulsiveness
from decision-making. The chief tool for squelching emotion is the indicator, a
calculation that you put on a chart to identify chart events, chiefly whether
the price is trending, the degree of trendedness, and whether a trend turning
point is being reached. The purpose of indicators is to clarify and enhance
your perception of the price move. They come in two varieties:
 Judgment-based indicators: This group includes visual pattern-recognition
methods such as bar, line, and pattern analysis, as well as candlesticks.
Chapters 2 through 4 cover these methods.
 Math-based indicators: This group includes moving averages, regression,
momentum, and other types of calculations; see Chapter 5 for the details.
635
Chapter 1: Wrapping Your Brain around Technical Analysis
Book VIII
Technical
Analysis

Just because math-based indicators are based on math doesn’t mean they
aren’t subjective. You determine the specifications of math-based indicators
in the first place (such as how many days are in a moving average), and your
specifications may contain preconceptions and bias. When you interpret
trading guidance from math-based indicators, you’re using judgment again.
Math-based indicators may involve just as much personal judgment in design
and application as outright judgment-based indicators.
Indicators are useful for identifying these five conditions:
 A trend is beginning (moving average crossover, pattern breakout).
 A trend is strong or weak (slope of linear regression or moving average).
 A trend is retracing but will likely resume (relative strength index).
 A trend is ending and may reverse (moving average crossover, pattern
breakout).
 A price is range-trading (slope of linear regression or moving average).
Each indicator works best in one situation and less well in others. Technical
traders argue the merits and drawbacks of indicators in each situation, and
the indicator you choose for each task depends, to a certain extent, on the
security and also on your choice of analytical time frame.
Choosing an analysis style
The trend is always the focus. In a perfect world, you first determine whether
your security is trending or range-trading sideways, and then you apply the
appropriate indicator. In practice, you can’t always classify price moves as
trending or not trending in a neat and tidy way. Besides, prices usually have
an identifiable range, whether they’re trending or not. In addition, retrace-
ments always create doubt — is it a momentary correction or a reversal?
Following are the types of analysis styles:
 Trend followers: Traders who like to identify trends may wait out
retracements and sideways range-trading situations until they resolve
back into a trend. Other trend followers use information from momentum
indicators to modify their position, for instance by taking some profit
when the security becomes overbought/oversold even though the trend
is just pausing and they expect it to continue. (See the earlier section
“Overbought and oversold” for definitions of these terms.) Figure 1-5
illustrates a trend, complete with minor retracements, and shows how a
trend-following trader makes decisions.
636
Book VIII: Technical Analysis 

If you choose trend-following, you’re choosing to suffer through the
downward bounce in an uptrend (or the upward bounce in a down-
trend). You’re going to wait it out, and if you have correctly identified
the trend, your patience pays off and the trend resumes.
 Swing traders: Swing traders buy at relative lows and sell at relative
highs, regardless of whether the price is trending. A swing trader may
know that a price is downtrending, for example, but he’s still willing to
buy it for a short-term profit opportunity when a momentum indicator
says it’s temporarily oversold and likely to enjoy a bounce upward.
Figure 1-6 shows how the swing trader tries to capture every move,
including the retracements.
Your choice of trending or swing-trading indicators determines your holding
period. Trending indicators generally keeps you in a trade for a longer period
of time than swing-trading indicators.
The best guiding principles are the ones that relate directly to the supply and
demand dynamics that you can see on the chart. This is why simple, old-
fashioned techniques, such as bar reading and pattern identification, are 
so powerful.

Examining how indicators work
Indicators aren’t inherently tied to particular time frames, nor do they have a
single correct interpretation. The sections that follow describe the general
way indicators work, but be aware that technical traders are mavericks and
use indicators in an infinite variety of ways.
Finding relevant time frames
Most indicators measure price and volume changes relative to previous
prices and volume over a specific look-back period, such as 12 days or 21
days. If you compare the trend-following chart in Figure 1-5 with the swing-
trading chart in Figure 1-6, you can see that trend-following uses indicators
with a relatively longer time frame than swing-trading indicators.
With the exception of “historic” highs and lows, most indicators have a range
of time in which research shows they work best. (For more on historic highs
and lows, see the “Establishing benchmark levels” section later in the chapter.)
This is why charting software has preformatted indicators with default
parameters specifying a particular time range. However, adopting the 
default parameter doesn’t mean that you must trade according to that time
range. Consider it a starting point; if the default doesn’t work for you, use a
different number of periods.
Most math-based indicators have an associated time frame, from very short-
term to very long-term:
 Intraday: Entry and exit on the same trading day
 Short-term: 3 to 12 days (average 3)

638
Book VIII: Technical Analysis 

 Intermediate-term: 12 to 45 days (average 20)
 Long-term: More than 30 days
The ability to apply an indicator over any time frame reflects the fractal quality
of prices — the weird and wonderful fact that without a label, a price series of
15-minute bars often can’t be distinguished from a month’s worth of daily prices.
Intraday bars are like microcosms of daily bars and daily bars are like micro-
cosms of weekly or monthly bars. Traders respond to price changes in regular,
consistent, and repetitive ways whatever the time frame.
Heeding indicator signals
Indicators are designed to give buy and sell signals, although in many
instances, the signal is more like a warning and doesn’t have a black-and-
white embedded decision rule. The following list introduces signals to pay
attention to:
 Crossovers: The term crossover refers to one line crossing another line.
Crossovers include:
• The price crossing a fixed historic benchmark.
• The indicator crossing the price or the price crossing the indicator.
• One line of a two-line indicator crossing the other.
In most instances, the price crossing an indicator is named a breakout,
one of the most important concepts in technical analysis. When a price
rises above a long-standing resistance line, for example, technical
traders say it broke out of its previous trading range and now the sky’s
the limit — until the new range is established. In an upside breakout,
bullish sentiment triumphed, but bearish sentiment can win out as well.
A breakout doesn’t necessarily imply a trend reversal; sometimes a
breakout is a confirming factor that the existing trend is gathering new
momentum or passing new benchmarks.
 Range limits: Oscillators describe where today’s price stands relative to
its recent trading range. They’re usually based on 100, so they range
from 0 to 100, or minus 100 to plus 100, or some other variation using
the number 100. In practice, traders find that most of the time, the scope
of the price range falls well under the outer limits and doesn’t vary by
more than 20 to 80 percent of the total possible range. Thus, they draw a
line at 20 percent of the maximum range and another one at 80 percent
(or 10 percent and 90 percent, or some other variation). When the indi-
cator approaches one of the lines, you know that the price is nearing an
extreme of its recent range.
639
Chapter 1: Wrapping Your Brain around Technical Analysis
Book VIII
Technical
Analysis

 Convergence: Convergence refers to two indicator lines coming closer to
one another, as when a support line and a resistance line converge to
form a triangle or two moving averages get closer together, indicating
less difference between their numerical values. Convergence generally
means that the price action is starting to go sideways or has a narrower
high–low range, or both. A sideways move, in turn, generally leads to a
breakout.
 Divergence: Divergence refers to two indicator lines moving farther
apart, as when the spread between two moving averages widens.
Divergence also refers to an indicator and the price going in different direc-
tions. Momentum indicators, in particular, reshuffle the components of the
price bar to come up with the rate of change of a price, so that the slope of
the indicator is a sophisticated measure of the strength of a trend. When the
price is still rising (making new highs) as the momentum indicator starts to
fall (making progressively lower highs), the price and indicator are diverg-
ing, which is an important leading indicator that the price rise is probably
about to stop. (See Chapter 5 for more on momentum.)
Establishing benchmark levels
Every chart has historic highs and lows. Technically, they aren’t indicators,
and yet they may serve to indicate future price action. You’ve probably heard
the phrases “52-week high” or “52-week low,” meaning the security is reach-
ing a one-year high or low. A new one-year high or low has no analytical value
to the technical trader — unless it’s also a historic high or low. A historic high
or low is an absolute level that becomes a benchmark.
When a price makes a new historic high or low and then retreats in the other
direction, years can pass before the benchmark is surpassed. In the meantime,
intermediate highs and lows emerge and become benchmarks in their own
right. At the time they occur, they seem historic. After a bounce up off a new
low, traders hesitate to break it, but after they do, the price accelerates to the
next low. The same thing happens on the way up to new highs. Profit-taking
after a high causes the price to dip, and traders hesitate to breach the new
“historic” high.
Hesitation ahead of the breach of a benchmark price can be prolonged and is
often accompanied by a gap (see Chapter 2 on gaps), demonstrating that
traders are aware of “historic levels.”
640
Book VIII: Technical Analysis 

Choosing and modifying indicators
Indicators only indicate; they don’t dictate the next price move. According to
the old joke, if you give 12 technical traders a new indicator, a year later you
have 12 different track records. This observation is perfectly accurate,
because how you use an indicator isn’t set by the indicator itself, but by the
trading rules you use. For example, you may like an indicator but find it gen-
erates too many trades in a fixed period, so you don’t execute every single
signal. Someone else may use the identical indicator, but instead of overrid-
ing indicator signals with personal judgment, he modifies the exact timing of
trades by using a second indicator.
Overriding your indicator haphazardly is self-defeating. You’re letting emotion
back in. Plus, you won’t get the expected result from the indicator — and
then you’ll blame the indicator. Modifying indicators with trading rules is
always better than overriding them. Fortunately, most indicators are fairly
flexible. They can be adapted to fit the trading rules you prefer, such as the
frequency of your trades.
Indicators are about price-move measurement. Trading rules are about you
and your tolerance for risk. Trading rules must be appropriate to the indica-
tors you choose. So don’t pick indicators that you can’t follow, like a momen-
tum indicator that gives ten trading signals per month when you don’t have
the time or inclination to trade that much.
Optimizing: The Necessary Evil
Optimization is the process of testing a hypothesis on historical data to see
which parameter would’ve worked the best. Optimization is necessary because
when you’re starting out to trade a new security, you have no idea of what indi-
cators to use or what parameters to put into the indicators. In keeping with the
empirical approach of technical analysis, you want to try various indicators
and different parameters in the indicators to see what works. As you optimize,
however, keep these caveats in mind:
 The future will differ from the past. Price patterns repeat, but only in a
general way. Any number of equally probable outcomes are possible in
any specific situation. What worked in March 2000 may get disastrous
results when applied in 2008 or 2016. It’s hard to follow trading rules
built on past patterns when you know the future will be different.
 Do you have the discipline to execute trades when your indicator tells
you to? More to the point, do you trust the indicator? This is like asking
whether you trust your own work developing the indicator parameters.
641
Chapter 1: Wrapping Your Brain around Technical Analysis

Take a look at Figure 1-7. The chart is of QQQQ, the tracking stock of the
NASDAQ-100 Index (technically an exchange-traded fund that incorporates
the 100 largest and most actively traded non-financial stocks on the
NASDAQ). QQQQ more than doubled from March 1999 to the all-time high in
March 2000. If you’d used a 50-day moving average crossover indicator to
signal when to sell, you would have sold QQQQ seven days after the peak.
Seven days — imagine the savings. (Fifty days is an oft-used parameter for
the moving average, but you need to find out whether it’s the best one for
your particular security. Who knows? Maybe 36 days, 77 days, or some other
number of days works better.)
Constructing a back-test optimization
The chart in Figure 1-7 displays a back-test (a test on historical data) of the
single moving average crossover rule on IBM stock. Say you’ve dabbled in
trading IBM stock on and off for a number of years, and you want to try your
hand at applying an indicator-based technical trading rule. Here’s the hypoth-
esis: “If you buy IBM stock every time the price crosses above the x-day
moving average and sell it every time the price crosses below the x-day
moving average, it’ll consistently and reliably be a profitable trading rule.”

Book VIII: Technical Analysis 

The goal of the optimization back-test is to find x, which is the number of
days in the moving average. Just about every software package allows you to
search for x. In this instance, the software delivered a result in less than 15
seconds. It was told to try every moving average from 10 days to 30 days
over the past 1,000 days. The most profitable moving average would’ve been
15 days. Figure 1-7 shows the 15-day moving average and the buy/sell signals
that the indicator would have generated at every crossover.
In the top window, take a look at the equity curve, which shows the cumulative
running total of the profit you would have made if you had been buying or selling
at each arrow. From a starting point of $1,000 in capital, you now have $2,443, or
a gain of 144 percent. Because 1,000 days is about 4 years, that’s an annual
return of 34.5 percent, better than the return on a risk-free bond and a whole
lot better than the loss you would have taken if you had bought $1,000 worth
of IBM stock on Day 1 of this test and simply held to Day 1,000. The stock fell
30 percent during the 1,000 days.
Taking a closer look at the test
Go back and look at Figure 1-7 again, and you can see that this case illustrates
the general objections to the back-testing process:
 Notice the horizontal line on the equity window at $1,000. Now see that
one month into the test, your equity fell below its starting point. The
indicator blew up right away; it caused losses. It blew up a few more
times, too. In real life, you’d probably not stick with a trading rule that
failed to show an interesting amount of profit for almost two full years.
 To apply the 15-day crossover rule would’ve caused you to trade a total
of 119 times, or every 8 days on average. In some cases, you would’ve
been trading every day. The cost of those trades isn’t zero.
Slippage is the term applied to the reduction in trading profits that arises
from the cost of trading. It includes the bid-offer spread, commissions,
and fees. Always look at the performance track record of an indicator
back-test after slippage. It can make all the difference between a profitable
trading rule and an unprofitable one.
 The majority of trades lose money. You can’t see that from the chart, but
most back-testing software shows you a system report summarizing
aspects of the test. In this example, of 119 trades, 82 lost money and
only 37 were profitable.
643
Chapter 1: Wrapping Your Brain around Technical Analysis
Book VIII
Technical
Analysis

 To get these results, you would’ve had to sell every time the indicator
signaled sell and at the same time go short the stock. In practice, most
people can’t short equities, although it’s an everyday occurrence in the
futures market.
Okay, so tell the software that you’re only a buyer when the indicator
signals a buy and you never take a short position when the indicator
tells you to go short. Because the stock was a net loser over the entire
1,000 days and buy-and-hold would’ve returned a big loss, you can guess
what the outcome is — only a 15 percent return over the 1,000 days, or
about 3.6 percent per year. Factor in the cost of commissions, and you
would have lost most if not all of your starting capital.
This particular moving average rule didn’t work after you factored in realistic
factors like paying commissions and not taking a short position. But the case
does exemplify one characteristic you seek in a trading rule: The average
profitable trade is much higher than the average unprofitable trade, over $75
in this case versus an average unprofitable trade of $26.67. Winners were
almost three times the size of losers. This yields a win/loss ratio of 2.8, or
$2.80 in profit for every $1 in loss. Moreover, the average winning trade lasted
19 days while the average losing trade lasted only 4 days. Even though the
trading rule didn’t work, it does meet a second winning characteristic of tech-
nical trading that you seek from your indicator: “Let your winners run and
cut your losses short.”
The goal of every indicator-based trading rule is to get more profit from winning
trades than you lose on losing trades. It isn’t to have a higher number of
profitable trades than losing trades, although that’s nice if you can get it.
Fixing the indicator
As the preceding section makes clear, your hypothesis (buying IBM stock
every time the price crosses above the x-day moving average and selling it
every time the price crosses below the x-day moving average will consis-
tently and reliably be a profitable trading rule) didn’t bear out in the test. But
the process illustrates common problems you encounter when you begin
back-testing indicators to find the optimum parameter.
Overtrading
An unadjusted indicator often results in overtrading — it generates too many
trades overall. Overtrading is trading so often that slippage reduces profits or
even eliminates them. You therefore need to find adjustments to the indicator
to reduce the number of trades, without damaging the returns from the
winning trades.
644
Book VIII: Technical Analysis 

You can filter the buy/sell signals by specifying that you want the software to
generate a buy or sell signal only if the price is x percent above or below the
moving average or has been above/below the moving average by y amount of
time. Be careful not to make conditions too fancy. It’s possible to fix the 15-
day moving average trading rule with filters to reduce the number of trades
so that profitability is high enough even to absorb trading costs. But you may
find that filter fixes aren’t robust, meaning that they back-test nicely but then
fail to deliver the expected gain in real-time. This is because the volatility of
the security changes over time.
Keep indicators and their associated trading rules as simple as possible.
Reducing losing trades
Most indicators generate more losing trades than winning ones, and the
reason the indicator works is that the winning trades are bigger in money and
percentage terms than the losers. But you still want to reduce losers. The
single best way to do that is to add a confirmation requirement, such as one
of the momentum indicators. In fact, requiring that the moving average indi-
cator be confirmed by a simple momentum rule (see Chapter 5 for more on
momentum) reduces the number of losing trades from 82 to 32 and improves
profitability considerably. You still have more losing trades than winning
trades in absolute numbers, but the average win-loss ratio improves.
Adding judgment calls
In many instances, when you look at the chart itself, you can see where some
bar configuration or pattern would’ve kept you out of a losing trade or gotten
you into a winning trade sooner. For example, the price may break a trendline
(see Chapter 4) or show a gap (see Chapter 2). But you can’t systematically
include judgment calls like this in a back-test of a math-based indicator
unless you’re mathematically very advanced and adept. In most instances, to
specify a condition like a gap as qualifying a trading rule would require you to
create a very long and elaborate formula.
Applying the indicator again
After successfully back-testing a given indicator, the job isn’t quite finished.
Back-tests are hypothetical. You don’t actually make those trades. To get a
more realistic idea of how an indicator-based trading rule works, you back-
test the rule on historical price data and then apply it to out-of-sample data.
In the IBM case, for example, you’d back-test the rule for the years 1999 to
2003, obtain the 15-day parameter, and then see how it worked in 2004. If the
results are about the same on the fresh data, you consider your rule to be
robust, meaning it works across a wide range of conditions.
645

As you modify your indicator, be sure to avoid curve-fitting, making the indicator
perfect for the past. The probability of it being perfect for the future is low,
because the market is dynamic and changes. Instead you want to apply the
moving average principle in a more flexible way by making it adaptive, by
adding confirming factors, by consulting volume, and other means.

Reading Basic Bars 
to Special Bars
In This Chapter
 Taking a look at the info shown by basic bars
 Identifying trends by reading bars
 Becoming familiar with special bars
 Getting the lowdown on spikes and gaps
T
he price bar and its placement on the chart deliver a ton of information
about market sentiment. It doesn’t take much practice to start reading
the mind of the market by looking at bars and small patterns. You have to be
patient, imaginative, and thoughtful, but the payoff is cold, hard cash. This
chapter explains what to look for in both basic and special bars.
Building Basic Bars
The price bar describes and defines the trading action in a security for a
given period. Price bars consist of four components — open, high, low, and
close, abbreviated OHLC (see Figure 2-1):
 Open: The horizontal line on the left is the opening price.
 High: The top of the vertical line defines the high of the day.
 Low: The bottom of the vertical line defines the low of the day.
 Close: The horizontal line on the right is the closing price.
Price bars can encompass different periods, anything from a minute to a
month. This discussion refers to a daily price bar. (The scope of the period
doesn’t change the price bar dynamics.)

648
Book VIII: Technical Analysis 
The two horizontal lines on the price bar are called tick marks. In trading
parlance, a tick represents a single trade at a single price, so the tick mark
representing the open or the close refers literally to a single transaction or 
to a batch of transactions all at the same price and at the same time.
The price bar tells you the outcome of the battle between the buyers (bulls)
and the sellers (bears). Hidden in every price bar is a winning group and a
losing group. If the price opened at the low and closed at the high, the winners
that day were the buyers. If the price opened at the high and closed at the low,
the winners that day were the sellers. If the bar is very tall, encompassing a $10
range when the normal bar for this security is only $3, the trading was a titanic
battle. If the bar is very short, say $1, it was a mere pillow fight.
As you try to interpret price bars, keep in mind that randomness can affect
any part of the price bar. Sometimes people make decisions about their money
that have nothing to do with the price, but rather with their personal needs.
Setting the tone: The opening price
The opening price is the very first trade between a buyer and a seller on the
trading day. The meaning of the open, like all the price bar components,
comes from its relationship to the other components of the bar as they
develop and to the components of the bars that come before. The opening
price’s most important relationship is to the close of the day before.
When the open is up
If the open is up from the close the day before, it may be because the first
trader of the day is expecting favorable news or has some other reason to
think his purchase will return a gain. If you want to be a buyer today, his
action reinforces your feeling. The first trade sets the tone, in this case a
hopeful one.

You can’t automatically attribute optimism or hopefulness to an opening
bounce, however, because sometimes a good opening is due to traders buying
on open. Mutual fund and other professional managers have preset allocations
to specific securities. When fresh money comes in the night before, they’re
going to distribute a certain percentage of it to all the securities in the fund
selected by the new customer. To “buy on open” is the easiest way to top up a
fund and not necessarily a judgment on that security that day.
To determine whether an opening bounce is due to fresh enthusiasm or just
the mechanical buy-on-open effect, you have to study each security to see
whether it normally displays the effect. Big-name securities (such as IBM
stock) are more susceptible to an opening bounce than specialized securities
with a narrower trader base (like cocoa futures).
When the open is down
If the opening price is below the close of the day before, chances are the tone
is sour. Maybe bad news came out after the close last night. The open may
also be down if some traders have executed a sell on open, but don’t count
on it unless you study the security and find that the open often falls below
yesterday’s close. Selling on open isn’t a common practice.
Summarizing sentiment: The closing price
The closing price is literally the last price at which a buyer bought and a seller
sold before the closing bell. The close is generally considered the most
important part of the price bar because it summarizes what traders feel 
about the security. They’ve watched this price all day, and by the end of the
day, they have a sense of how popular it was near the lows (lots of buying
going on) or how unpopular near the highs (lots of selling going on).
After-hours trading creates a problem in evaluating the close. How do you
treat the close when your security makes a new high or new low in after-
hours trading — only ten minutes after the close? The answer is that you
don’t adjust the close. In terms of managing your data, the open and close are
associated with the trading hours of the primary exchange where the security
is listed: the New York Stock Exchange, the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, and so on. If the security trades wildly higher or lower
from the “official” close, even five or ten minutes after the close, the new
information is included in the price data for the next day.
Selling on close is a modifying factor to keep in mind as you evaluate the close.
Traders sell at the close to eliminate the risk of loss if something happens
overnight that causes the price to fall. Because so many people exit on the
close, the close is seldom the high of the day. And when the close is at the
high of the day, it means people who do hold overnight positions are buying
right up to the last minute, offsetting the usual end-of-day sales.

When the close is up
Over time, the cumulative relationship of the close today to the close yesterday
gives you a visual impression of directional bias:
 An up-day is one where the close is higher than the close the day before.
 A down-day refers to a day on which the close is lower than the close the
day before.
If today’s close is consistently higher than yesterday’s close, day after day,
buyers are demanding more and more of the security and are willing to pay
an ever-higher price to get it. Take a look at Figure 2-2; with the exception of
Day 4, every close is higher than the close the previous day.
When the close is down
In Figure 2-3, you can see that, after the first bar, each close is lower than the
day before. Here the sellers are willing to take ever-lower prices to get rid of the
security. The market assumes that those holding an inventory of the security
are willing to sell at lower and lower prices in order to get buyers to demand it.

Book VIII: Technical Analysis 

Tapping out: The high
The high of the price bar is literally the highest point of the bar, and it represents
the highest price at which a buyer and seller made an exchange of cash for the
security. The high of the day has meaning only in the context of its relationship
to other parts of the same bar, especially the close, and to the high the day before.
When the price closes at the high of the day, traders are extremely optimistic of
more gains to come (bullish). When the high is at the open and it’s all downhill for
the rest of the day, traders are pessimistic (bearish).
Hitting bottom: The low
The low of the day is the cheapest price at which a buyer and seller exchanged
cash for the security. As with the high of the day, the low has meaning only in
the context of its relationship to other parts of the price bar and the bars that
precede it. When the low is lower than the open, it probably means that some
fresh news has come out after the opening bell that offsets any buy-on-open
orders or initial sentiment. When the close is at the low, it means that bad news
or negative sentiment ruled for the day.
Using Bars to Identify Trends
After a price is established through the execution of a real cash trade, traders
have a baseline from which to track prices. The preceding sections explain
how to interpret price bar components to one another within a single bar.
When you look at the components across a series of bars, you get even more
information, and interpretation becomes a lot more complex.
The price bar embodies all the supply–demand dynamics of the day, and a
series of bars on a chart shows the evolution of the supply–demand dynam-
ics over time. Sometimes, the evolution is visible in the form of a trend. This
section describes how to use combinations of bars to identify trends.
Identifying an uptrend
The textbook-perfect uptrend is a series of up-day price bars (close higher than the
close yesterday) that have higher highs and higher lows in a majority of the bars.
A higher high exists when the high today is higher than the high yesterday or
higher than the high of the past few days. A series of higher highs often signals
that the market is feeling enthusiastic about the security. But you usually don’t
know at the time whether a new high or a small series of new highs is the
651
Chapter 2: Reading Basic Bars to Special Bars
Book VIII
Technical
Analysis

beginning of a trend. To confirm your suspicion that a trend may be forming,
you need another piece of information: higher lows. Higher lows are a series
of low points that dip less with each successive day. A series of higher highs
combined with higher lows hints that a trend is forming.
If you have higher highs with higher lows for a couple of days in a row, can
you assume that Day 3 will also deliver a higher high and a higher low? Not
necessarily. Prices don’t move in straight lines. You seldom see an unbroken
series of higher highs on every single day. Refer to Figure 2-2. You see a series
of days on which the close is higher than the close the day before. At the
same time, the price is making a fresh high nearly every day, but not every
day without fail. On Day 4 in the figure, the close was higher than the open
and the low was higher than the day before, but the high of the day was not
higher than the day before.
Most analysts tell you not to worry about this particular configuration of bars.
It’s an uptrend, all right, and you know this because you have an unbroken
series of higher lows. Day 4 is a disappointment — it doesn’t deliver a higher
high — but the low is higher than all the previous lows. By considering the
additional factor of higher lows, you confirm that the probability is pretty
good of getting a higher high and a higher close on Day 5.
Identifying a downtrend
The textbook definition of a downtrend is a series of down-day bars (close
lower than yesterday) characterized by lower lows and lower highs in a pre-
ponderance of the bars.
Go back and look at the down-days in Figure 2-3. After the first day, each of
these bars has a close lower than the close the day before. Day 3 has the
same high as the day before, but a lower low. On Day 3 you are starting to get
the idea that this may be the beginning of a downtrend.
When identifying a downtrend, a series of lower highs is a good confirming
indicator to the series of lower lows. Sellers see that new lows are occurring —
somebody must know something negative about the security. Traders aren’t
willing to hold a falling asset, and they unload it at ever-lower prices. Meanwhile,
fans of the security can’t give it support at yesterday’s low — selling pressure
is too great.
652
Book VIII: Technical Analysis 

But wait . . . nothing is that simple
A trend has two identifiers: a series of higher highs (or lower lows) and a
series of up-days (or down-days). Technical analysis doesn’t offer a hard-and-
fast rule on which identifier is more important. Traditional technical analysis
emphasizes that you need higher lows to confirm the higher highs in an uptrend,
but candlestick analysis, covered in Chapter 3, says that the position of the close
trumps every other factor, including a new high or low.
In practice, you find that the weight you place on the position of the close 
is a direct function of how far out in time you want to extend your forecast.
Traditional bar chart reading generally has a longer forecasting time frame in
mind than candlestick chart reading, and a longer expected holding period over
which you plan to own the security. In traditional bar analysis, you may accept
two, three, or even more days of countervailing bars (bars that don’t confirm the
trend). In candlestick analysis, you may accept only one day or none because
the trading style associated with candlestick analysis is very short-term.
Bar components influence the next bar
When new highs or lows are occurring, market players start wondering why.
This uncertainty arouses various emotions:
 A new high or low makes market participants nervous. A sufficiently
large number of new highs triggers the greed instinct — better buy now
so you don’t miss out, even if you don’t have a reason for new highs to
be occurring. The result is a higher close as buyers pile in near the end
of the day.
 New lows scare just enough traders that they sell their positions, even in
the absence of any fresh news that would justify the selling. Sellers are
unwilling to hold a falling asset and sell near the end of the day, causing
a lower close.
When the close today is higher than the close yesterday, but the high today
isn’t higher than the high yesterday, pay attention because new highs may
start to appear. These new highs may happen because those who know
enough about up-days and down-days begin to anticipate higher highs or
lower lows. Then, by acting on that expectation — buying or selling ahead of
the actual appearance of a higher high or lower low — they make it happen.
Trends can be relative
Markets are not neat and tidy, and not every bar is going to qualify on all the
criteria traditionally needed to indicate an up- or downtrend. The chart in
Figure 2-4 depicts an uptrend — even though not every bar qualifies as
653
Chapter 2: Reading Basic Bars to Special Bars
Book VIII
Technical
Analysis

belonging to an uptrend. You see lower lows as well as several days on which
the bar is a down-day. Down-days are colored black, and up-days are gray.
This figure demonstrates in what ways trends can be relative:
 Significance: In Figure 2-4, not every high is higher than the day before,
but every significant high is higher than the highs that came before. You
can judge significance by eyeing the chart, or you can specify rules, such
as “a significant high is one that is x percent higher than the average of
the past y highs.” You can use software to develop a filter that defines
criteria like a “significant high.” In Figure 2-4, two significant higher highs
stand out. They each represent a 50 percent gain from the previous up-
day high.
If you use charting software to look at charts, turn on the feature that
lets you visually differentiate between up-days and down-days. A stan-
dard practice is to make up-days green and down-days red. It takes no
practice to see where a trend is interrupted by bars that don’t qualify.
 Preponderance: Figure 2-4 illustrates that not every high in an uptrend
has to be higher than the one before. You just need to identify a prepon-
derance of higher highs and a preponderance of higher lows. What is a
preponderance? You decide. You can eyeball it, or use software to
develop a precise definition and back-test it on historical data.
Your eyes can deceive you
Sometimes, if you aren’t careful, you can misinterpret what you’re seeing. You
may see a series of higher highs but forget to make sure that each bar has a
higher low and is an up-day, or you may see a series of lower lows but forget
to check that the high is lower or that the bars are all down-days. Take a look
at Figure 2-5 for a chart that can easily be misread.

Book VIII: Technical Analysis 

This figure shows a price series where every day brings a new high but every
day also brings a close lower than the day before, and many days bring a low
that is lower than the lows on preceding days.
Your eye may want to see an uptrend, but when you look more closely and
analyze the bars for all three conditions, you have only one uptrend condition
(higher highs) that is more than offset by the two downtrend conditions
(down-days and lower lows). This set of bars is a series of down-days (the
close is lower than the close the day before). It’s hard to swallow, but this
figure displays a downtrend emerging at the third bar.
Bar-reading doesn’t always work
Sometimes you can’t figure out what the market is thinking, because it’s
changing its mind just about every other day. Figure 2-6 is such a chart. The
series of gray up-days is a minor uptrend, and the following series of black
down-days is a minor downtrend — but then things fall apart. You see higher
highs followed by lower lows and no consistency in the placement of the
close (up-day or down-day).
What do you do in a case like this? Nothing — at least not anything based on
interpretation of the bars. When bars are in a chaotic mess like this, the prob-
ability of picking the right direction (up or down) is very low. You’d just be
guessing.

Reading Special Bar Configurations
An uptrend features higher highs with higher lows and a close higher than
the day before (up-days). A downtrend features a series of lower lows together
with lower highs and mostly down-days. A fourth factor in determining a trend
is the relationship between the day’s open and close. A close above the open
is a sign of an uptrend; a close below the open is a sign of a downtrend.
Continuation and reversal patterns
When you spot a special configuration in a small series of bars, you’re looking
for one of two things — it either confirms the trend or signals that the trend is
at risk of ending:
 Continuation patterns: The trend is continuing. The direction and pace
of the trend are about the same as they were before. Evidence that a
trend is continuing includes things like a preponderance of higher highs
and higher lows marking bullish sentiment on the part of the trading
crowd, even though perhaps some other qualifying factor isn’t present.

 Reversal patterns: The trend is switching direction. When the trend shifts
from down to up or up to down, the configuration of the bar components
and their placement across a series of price bars often shout “The trend
is changing” from the rooftop. Listen up. If you have a position in the
security, a reversal pattern tells you to exit. If you hold on to the position
anyway, your risk of loss is much higher.
A reversal pattern is not only a warning to exit when you’re invested in
the security; it’s also advance notice that a good entry place may be
coming up. For example, when a downtrend ends, you may see one of
the very specific reversal patterns that is a reliable precursor to a buy
signal. You can get ready to enter the upcoming uptrend.
You hardly ever see a series of bars where every single one of these factors
confirms the trend. Because prices never move entirely in a straight line, you
have to accept that some bars in a trend don’t fall into line with all the trend
criteria. You may have one or two bars in an uptrend that don’t have higher
highs or a few bars where the close is lower than the day before. Such variations
in tick placement and bar placement (position of a price bar relative to the
bars that precede it) are normal in even the best-behaved trend.
The daily trading range
The daily trading range is the difference between the high and the low of the
day. It measures the maximum distance that the price traveled that period.
You can also say that the range defines the emotional extremes of the day:
 If you have a bar with a small range in a sea of larger bars, the market is
indecisive. Indecisiveness isn’t the same thing as indifference. A change
in sentiment may be brewing, such as deceleration in a price rise that
precedes the end of the trend.
 When it’s one very large bar in a sea of smaller ones, pay close attention.
Traders are willing to pay a lot more for a rising security, or they want to
dump a falling one so badly that they’ll accept an abnormally low price.
Interpreting Common Special Bars
Some bars are just a little out of line, but sometimes you see bars that really
stand out. It takes almost no practice at all to differentiate ordinary out-of-
line bars from special configurations that traders consider to be associated
with specific interpretations. In these special cases, you know you’ve got a
valuable clue to upcoming price behavior.
657
Chapter 2: Reading Basic Bars to Special Bars
Book VIII
Technical
Analysis

The interpretation guidelines aren’t 100 percent right at all times. In fact,
nobody can tell you even roughly what percentage of the time the standard
interpretation is correct, because it may be correct all the time in one security
but only 10 percent of the time in another, or correct 75 percent of the time in
one year but never correct in another. In addition, a bar component or even the
placement of the entire bar can be random. The lack of statistically verified and
perfectly reliable guidelines is frustrating and annoying to all technical traders
and especially beginners, but remember, you’re seeking meaningful information
about crowd psychology from an excess of evidence.
Use logic and common sense when you’re looking at special bars. Keep it
simple. The simplest explanations are the likeliest ones.
Closing on a high note
A series of closes at the high — and the downtrending counterpart, closes at
the low — indicate that a new trend may be starting or the existing trend is
likely to continue. In Figure 2-7, configuration A illustrates close at the high.
The price has closed at the high of the day for three days running, and the
third bar is much longer than the others, which means the high–low range is
wider than the previous two days. So, what’s happening?
The first two bars show the close at the high at about the same level. On the
second bar, the low of the day was lower than the low the day before, mean-
ing that sellers came out of the woodwork. But the bulls fought back, buying
more and more, so that the close was at a fresh high on that second day. The
close at the high for a second day trumps the lower low, and Day 3 delivers a
whopping gain — and a third close at the high.

Book VIII: Technical Analysis 

A big gain is often followed by profit-taking by active traders who get in a
move early. Profit-taking doesn’t change a trend, but it can put a dent in the
performance of the bar the next day. You may see a lower high or a lower
close, which can be very discouraging when you’re trying to identify a new
trend. It’s also annoying to put on a new position in a promising move —
three higher highs and three closes at the high — only to take a paper loss on
your first day. If you’re using bar-reading alone to make trading decisions,
stick with the trade (while cursing short-term traders), but also reconsider
where you placed your stop-loss order.
Spending the day inside
Configuration B in Figure 2-7 shows the inside day. An inside day refers to a
price bar that meets two criteria:
 The high is lower than the previous day’s high.
 The low is higher than the previous day’s low.
An inside day is a bar “inside” the previous day’s high–low range and usually
the average high–low range of the past few days. It reflects indecision. Buyers
didn’t feel strongly enough about this security to buy more. Sellers weren’t
particularly inspired to sell, either. The inside day doesn’t suggest what’s
going to happen the following day. But it does warn that the market is start-
ing to reconsider what it feels about this security.
Getting outside for the day
Configuration C in Figure 2-7 is the outside day. On an outside day, the
high–low range of the bar is outside the range of the preceding bar. The open
and close ticks can appear anywhere on the outside day bar, but two variations
stand out:
 The open is at the low and the close is at the high: This configuration
suggests that something new has happened to inspire bullish buying
right up to the end of the day.
 The open is at the high and close is at the low: Sentiment turned bearish
and sellers overwhelmed buyers, right to the end of the day.
659
Chapter 2: Reading Basic Bars to Special Bars
Book VIII
Technical
Analysis

After considering where the open and close are located on the bar, take a
look at what else is going on in the market, especially the configuration of the
preceding bars:
 No trend exists: The outside day alerts you to a possible trend beginning.
 A trend is in place: The outside day may suggest a reversal or a continua-
tion, depending on where the open and close are and which direction the
security is trending. The outside day has a higher high by definition, but
a higher close as well implies continuation in an uptrend and reversal in a
downtrend, especially if the close is exactly at the high. Similarly, the out-
side day has a lower low by definition, so it confirms continuation in a
downtrend, especially if the close is at the low.
Finding the close at the open
Configuration D in Figure 2-7 shows a series of bars where the close is at or
near the open. Close-at-open ordinarily occurs near the center of the daily
price range, not at the high or the low. A close at or near the open reflects
indecision among market participants. Trader opinion is divided as to whether
this bar generally signifies a continuation or reversal pattern. Consider it a clue
to look at what else is going on, such as trading volume.
When the open and close are at (or almost at) the same price, and they’re at
the high or low of the day, you have a greater chance of determining whether
the trend will continue or reverse. Which way the cookie crumbles depends
on what was happening before:
 In an uptrend: If the open and close are near the high, look for the
uptrend to accelerate. If they are near the low, look for a reversal.
 In a downtrend: If the open and close are near the low, expect more of
the same. If they are near the high, think about a reversal.
Understanding Spikes
Sometimes the market delivers a price bar that looks like the market went
crazy that day — the high or the low is very far away from the general trend
of things and the bar itself is abnormally large (wide high–low range). Figure
2-8 shows two of these uncommon price bars, called spikes. A spike is a bar
that encompasses a much bigger high–low range than the bars immediately
preceding it.
660
Book VIII: Technical Analysis 

In some cases, like that shown in the top example of Figure 2-8, a spike turns
out to be an anomaly. The spike low suggests that some people panicked and
were selling at such a high quantity and at such a frantic pace that the few
buyers still around were able to buy at abnormally low prices. On this chart,
the sellers panicked unnecessarily. The next day, the price resumed its uptrend
and its same “normal” high–low range. The spike was just an oddity — a
random move.
Even though price spikes can be an anomaly, you can’t afford to ignore them.
The spike may be a reaction to fresh news or perspective that has the potential
to create a new trend. Or it may be a message that sentiment has changed
dramatically.
The bottom spike example in Figure 2-8 is a key reversal because on the next
few days, the price proceeded to make lower highs and lower lows. This spike
in the size of the daily high–low range was a warning of a reversal. Key rever-
sals can be ordinary bars and aren’t always spikes, but when you see a spike,
always ask yourself whether it may mark a reversal.
You seldom know whether a spike is random or meaningful on the day that it
happens. Only hindsight can tell you that. Though hindsight has the final say
on the meaning of a spike, you can still use spikes for immediate analytical
purposes:
 Investigate the environment: Sometimes you do know when a spike is a
key reversal because you can determine what shock caused it and your
judgment in interpreting the news or event is sound.

 Trust the close: As a general rule, you’re safe assuming that the close is the
most important part of the bar because it sums up the sentiment for 
the day.
A key reversal bar is also called a swing bar, although not all swing bars are
spikes. A swing bar is any bar that is the final and lowest low in a series of
lower lows or the final and highest high in a series of higher highs, as in the
bottom chart in Figure 2-8. You can see a spike bar at the end of the day after
the close, but you can’t identify it as a swing bar until after two additional
closes.
A conservative trading tactic is to order your broker to sell the security if the
price falls below the low of the spike day over the next two or three days.
Everybody who trades this security knows about the spike low and will be
watching to see if the bears are strong enough to break the level and take the
price lower. If so, they plan to sell at that level, and you should, too. In an
upmove, bulls are often curiously timid about testing a spike high. The bar
following a spike is often an inside day. Other times the following bar has a
new higher high only a few pennies above the spike high and a close lower
than the spike bar close. Neither bar is helpful. They’re simply inconclusive,
and you have to wait for additional evidence to get guidance on how to trade.
Grasping Gaps
A gap is one of the most important of the special bar configurations. A gap is
a major, visible discontinuity between two price bars on a chart (see Figure 2-9).
Because every bar encompasses all the transactions made during a specific
period, a gap marks the absence of any transactions at the prices covered by
the gap.
The gap is a void — no demand if there was supply and no supply if there
was demand, at least not at those prices. Prices had to shift considerably in
order for supply and demand to meet again and for both buyers and sellers
to be satisfied. On daily charts, a gap is initially seen when the opening price
today diverges dramatically from yesterday’s high or low, although you can
also see gaps between bars on intraday charts.
You can identify a gap at the open, but you can’t measure a gap until the day’s
trading is over. Then you measure it from yesterday’s high to today’s low (for
an upside gap) or from yesterday’s low to today’s high (for a downside gap).
The gap is between the bars, not between the opens and closes. If the security
opens on a gap but then the gap is filled during the day, the gap doesn’t show
up on a daily chart. The same thing is true if a security gaps during the day
on an hourly chart — the daily bar doesn’t show it.
662
Book VIII: Technical Analysis 

Gaps are often the result of positive or negative news, like earnings or some
other event, whether true or invented (rumors). Events are the source of
most key price moves, including trends, whether starting or stopping. Prices
don’t, on the whole, move randomly — traders have reasons, right or wrong,
to buy and sell. Even the strongest trend can be broken by a piece of fresh
news contrary to the trend direction. Authentically big news trumps the
chart (nearly) every time.
Gaps are a wonderful trading opportunity if you can differentiate between a
common gap and uncommon gaps.
Lacking opportunity: Common gaps
A common gap is one that appears out of nowhere for no particular reason
(no fresh news). Common gaps can occur in trending and nontrending prices.
If the price is trending, it fails to change the trend. If the price isn’t trending,
it fails to initiate a trend. Common gaps are generally insignificant.
A common gap tends to have low volume on the gap day. If you see an opening
gap, one way to evaluate whether to take it seriously is to consult volume. To
consult volume, you need access to live data. If volume is low or normal, traders
aren’t jumping on the bandwagon and it’s probably a common gap. If volume is
abnormally high, traders are jumping on the bandwagon and the gap will
probably lead to a big rise or fall in the coming days.
A security that normally has low volume tends to have more gaps than heavily
traded securities. A low-volume security is described as thinly traded, meaning
few market participants. Don’t try to interpret gaps in thinly traded securities.
These gaps are usually just common gaps and mean nothing at all.

Kicking things off: Breakaway gaps
A breakaway gap, shown in Figure 2-10, is an important event because it
almost always marks the start of a new trend. Not only do you get the gap
and a new trend, but you also get a major change in the appearance of the
chart, such as a widening of the normal high–low daily trading range, an
increase in day-to-day volatility, and much higher volume. All these changes
occur because the breakaway gaps draw in new traders. A breakaway gap is
event-driven, usually on some news about the security itself.
To qualify as a breakaway gap, the gap has to
 Be proportionately big to the usual trading range: If the security normally
trades in a $3 range between the daily high and low, and the gap is $15
between the preceding day’s high and the gap-day open, you can instantly
recognize that something big happened.
 Occur when a price is either slightly trending or moving sideways:
Nothing much is going on in the chart, and then bam! Fresh news creates
new supply and demand conditions and ignites a trend.
You interpret a breakaway gap depending on whether it’s upward or downward.
 Upside breakaway gap: Good news creates demand. New buyers want
to own the security and are willing to pay ever-higher prices to get it.
Volume is noticeably higher than usual.
 Downside breakaway gap: Traders can’t wait to get rid of their holdings
and accept ever-lower prices to achieve that goal. Volume may or may
not be abnormally high.

Book VIII: Technical Analysis 

Continuing the push: Runaway gaps
A runaway gap (refer to Figure 2-10) occurs after a security is already moving
in a trended way and fresh news comes out that promotes the existing trend.
Whereas a breakaway gap starts a trend, a runaway gap continues a trend. In
both cases, buyers become exuberant and offer higher and higher prices.
Sometimes there’s fresh good news, sometimes traders make up fresh good
news, and sometimes the buying frenzy is just feeding on itself in the absence
of any news at all.
A pullback (a falling price after a dramatic move) represents profit-taking by
the early birds and is very common. In fact, professionals count on the pull-
back to “buy on the dip.” If they get really enthusiastic, re-entering profes-
sional traders often supply the energy for a runaway gap that follows a
breakaway gap.
Calling it quits: Exhaustion gaps
Exhaustion gaps occur at the end of a trend, signaling the party’s over. Volume
is usually low. What’s exhausted is the news that propelled the security up in
the first place and the energy of the early buyers. An exhaustion gap is usually
followed by a reversal.
You can distinguish an exhaustion gap from a runaway gap by looking at volume,
which is usually low at an exhaustion gap. Anytime you see wild new highs (or
lows) that aren’t accompanied by wild new high volume, be suspicious of the
staying power of the move. You can exit altogether or move up your stop-loss
order.
Scoring big: Island reversals
Sometimes an exhaustion gap is followed immediately by a breakaway gap
going in the other direction. This is how an island reversal forms. An island
reversal is a single isolated price bar with a gap up on one side and a gap
down on the other. It looks like an island in a sea of price bars and is almost
always an unusually long bar — a wide high–low range.
In Figure 2-11, you can see a series of higher highs, including a minor gap up, but
then the last buyers realize they are all alone on top of the mountain. They start
to sell in a panic and are willing to accept a much lower price. Now the price
takes off in the opposite direction on a breakaway gap, which tends to have high
volume. The island reversal bar has a higher high but is accompanied by low
665

volume. This combination is the warning. The next day, as the breakaway gap
develops, it has unusually high volume. You need live data to evaluate the
new breakaway gap as it emerges at the open. High volume in combination
with the downward gap is an indication that early selling is strong and prices
later in the day aren’t going to go back and fill that gap.
Examine price bars, and you’ll see a lot of gaps. Seldom, though, will you see
an island reversal. But when you do see it, you know what to do:
 An island reversal at the bottom: Buy.
 An island reversal at the top: Sell.
Will the gap be filled?
Filling the gap means that prices are returning to the level they occupied
before the gap, as shown in Figure 2-12.
With a runaway gap or a common gap, demand for the stock is more a function
of buyers egging each other on than changing conditions, so the gap may be
filled quickly. Sometimes a gap gets filled just because all the chatter about
filling the gap in the market makes it a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Book VIII: Technical Analysis 

A breakaway gap is another matter. If a security takes off on a breakaway gap,
sometimes the price doesn’t return to fill the gap for many months or even
years — if ever. When the fundamentals of a security change dramatically,
why would market participants sell it back down to the level it was before the
big event? Conditions have changed permanently, and so has the price of the
security.

andlestick charting displays the price bar in a graphically different way from
the standard bars described in Chapter 2. But this isn’t just a notation
method — candlesticks do many other things, as well:
 They’re easy to use and simple to interpret. Plus you can use candlesticks
on any chart, with any other indicators, just like standard bars.
 The names of candlesticks and candlestick patterns contain the seeds of
interpretation and help you to remember what the pattern means. Because
candlestick bar interpretations are widely known, other participants in the
market respond in a specific way to a specific pattern.
 They excel in identifying strategic market turning points — reversals
from an uptrend to a downtrend or a downtrend to an uptrend.
This chapter breaks down the components of a candlestick and covers those
candlesticks and combinations that stand out the most from the dozens that
exist.
Anatomy of a Candlestick
The candlestick form emphasizes the open and the close (see Figure 3-1). The
open and the close mark the top and bottom of a box, named the real body. A
thin vertical line at the top and bottom of the real body, named the shadow,
shows the high and the low. (See Chapter 2 for a discussion of the basic bar
components — open, close, high, and low.)

670
Book VIII: Technical Analysis 
Drawing the real body
The real body encompasses the range between the open and the close. The
color of the real body tells you how the daily struggle between the bulls and
the bears played out:
 White real body: The close is higher than the open. A white body is
bullish, and the longer the body, the more bullish it is. A long candlestick
indicates that the close was far above the open, implying aggressive
buying. In the daily battle of bulls and bears, the bulls won.
 Black real body: The close is lower than the open. A black body is bearish,
and the longer the body, the more bearish it is. A long black candlestick
indicates a preponderance of sellers throughout the session. In the daily
battle of bulls and bears, the bears won.
The two candlestick bars in Figure 3-1 show the identical open and close, but
coloring one of them black creates the optical illusion that it is bigger. That
black bar demands your attention, which is one reason candlestick charting
is appealing — and effective.
In standard bar notation, described in Chapter 2, a bar’s color depends on
whether it’s a down-day (the close is lower than the day before) or an up-day
(the close is higher than day before). In candlestick notation, the color of the
bar is determined only by today’s open and today’s close, without reference
to yesterday’s prices.
As in all bar analysis, context is crucial. Although you may sometimes use a
single candlestick bar as an indicator in its own right, most of the time you
use it in relation to the bars that precede it. One small white-body bar in a

sea of black bars, for example, may mean the bulls won that day, but it was a
minor event. The one white bar may signal that the bears are losing power,
but you wouldn’t use it all by itself to call the end of a black-bar downtrend.
Defining doji: No real body
A candlestick that has no real body or only a very small one is named a doji.
In a doji, the open and the close are at or nearly at the same level. Figure 3-2
displays three doji bars. When the close is at or near the open, market
participants are indecisive. Bulls and bears are at a standoff.
A doji implies that sentiment is in a transitional phase. It’s a neutral bar, neither
bullish nor bearish, that gains meaning from its placement within a set of
bars. If the price series has been in an uptrend, for example, the doji may
reflect that the buyers are coming to the end of their bullish enthusiasm. A doji
coming immediately after a very long white bar shows that the market is tired.
Studying the shadows
The high and the low are shown in the shadows, which you can think of as a
candlewick (on the top) or a tail (on the bottom). Although the shadow is sec-
ondary to the real body in importance, shadows contribute useful information
about market psychology, too, and modify your interpretation of the body.
Shadows offer special interpretive clues in three instances: when the real
body is a doji, when the shadow is missing, and when the shadow is extremely
long.

Shadows in the doji bar
In many instances, a doji is just a plain one, but the dragonfly and gravestone
dojis are the more useful (refer to Figure 3-2):
 Dragonfly doji: Features a long lower shadow. A very long lower shadow
tells you that the open, high, and close were all the same or nearly the
same, meaning sellers were trying to push the price down and succeeded
in making a low — but they didn’t succeed in getting it to close there.
Because the close was back up at or near the open, buyers must have
emerged before the end of trading and fought back, getting the price to
close at or near what was both the open and the high. How you interpret
the dragonfly depends on what bar patterns precede it:
• If the price move is a downtrend, the dragonfly may mean that
buyers are emerging and the downtrend may be ending.
• If the dragonfly appears after a series of uptrending bars, buyers
failed to push the price over the open to a new high while sellers
succeeded in getting a low, so the uptrend may be in trouble.
 Gravestone doji: Features a long upper shadow. This bar is formed 
when the open, low, and close are the same or nearly the same, but a
high creates a long upper shadow. Although buyers succeeded in pushing
the price to a high over the open, by the end of the day the bears were
fighting back and pushed the price back to close near the open and the
low. This is a failed effort at a rally, but you can interpret the bar only in
the context of the bars that precede it:
• If the gravestone bar appears after a series of uptrending bars,
buyers failed to get the close at the high. Sellers dominated and
the uptrend is at risk of ending.
• If the price move is a downtrend, the gravestone doji may mean
that buyers are emerging and the downtrend may be ending.
Missing shadows
The absence of a shadow at one end is called a shaven top or a shaven
bottom. To get a shaven top or bottom, the open or close must be exactly at
the high or the low (see Figure 3-3).
SHAVEN TOP
SHAVEN BOTTOM
Figure 3-3:

672
Book VIII: Technical Analysis 

 Shaven top: No upper shadow exists when the open or close is at the
high. A shaven top can be black or white, and it comes about in two ways:
• If the open is at the high, the day’s trading was all downhill from
there. Not only is it a black candlestick, bearish to begin with, but
it’s doubly bearish that no net new buying occurred after the open.
• If the close is at the high, the net of the day’s trading was at higher
prices, which is bullish. The candlestick is also (by definition)
white, a bullish sign.
 Shaven bottom: No lower shadow exists when the open or the close is
at the low of the day. A shaven bottom can come about in two ways:
• If the open is at the low, all the day’s trading was euphoric. This is
bullish, adding to the bullishness of the white candlestick.
• If the close is at the low, all the day’s trading points to developing
negative sentiment (depending on what bars precede it, of course).
This is a black bar, with bells on.
Really long shadows
When the shadow is as long as the real body, or longer (see Figure 3-4),
traders are expressing an extreme of sentiment. They may or may not follow
through the next day by pushing the close to the high or low extreme. It can
be tricky, therefore, to evaluate a long shadow. As a general rule, you judge a
long shadow by its placement on the chart (relative to preceding bars).
 Long upper shadow: The high of the day came well above both the open
and the close, whether the real body is black or white.
• If the price series is in an uptrend, the long upper shadow is a failure
to close near the high. If the uptrend is nearing a resistance level
(see Chapter 4 for a discussion of resistance), the long upper shadow
may signal a weakening of the uptrend. If a long upper shadow
follows a doji bar indicating indecisiveness, you should worry 
that the uptrend may be over.

Technical
Analysis

• If the price series is on a downtrend, the long upper shadow sug-
gests that some market participants are buying at higher levels.
Especially if a long upper shadow follows a doji bar, you should
wonder whether the downtrend may be ending.
 Long lower shadow: A long lower shadow means that the low of the day
came well under both the open and the close, whether the real body is
black or white.
• If the price series is in a downtrend, the long lower shadow is a fail-
ure to close near the low. If the downtrend is nearing a support
level (see Chapter 4), the long lower shadow may signal a weakening
or an end of the downtrend.
• If the price series is on an uptrend, the long lower shadow suggests
that traders were not willing to keep buying at the high levels right
up to the close. They were exiting under the high and, therefore,
think that new highs are not warranted. This can be a warning sign
of the trend decelerating or ending.
Identifying Emotional Extremes
Identifying when traders are reaching the end of their emotional tether is one
of the primary goals of candlestick charting. A change in the size of the bar is
one of the best indicators of this situation. If you’re looking at a series of medium-
sized bars and suddenly see one relatively long bar (as shown in Figure 3-5), it
may be telling you that support or resistance has been reached. Support marks
an extreme level where buyers perceive that the price is relatively cheap, and
resistance marks an extreme level where sellers perceive the price is relatively
high, inspiring profit-taking or at least an end to accumulation.
In the top illustration in Figure 3-5 is a series of three white bars making higher
opens and higher closes, followed by a doji and an exceptionally long white
bar. If you were looking at this in standard bar notation, as seen in the bottom
illustration, you might say to yourself, “Higher highs, higher lows, higher
closes, trend okay.” But the unusually tall bar stands out more prominently in
candlestick mode — especially following the transitional doji — and alerts you
to the possibility that all the buyers who were going to buy have just done so
in one last burst, and the price may have formed a resistance level at the top
of the bar (the close, in this case).
If the long bar were a black bar, denoting that the close was lower than the
open, you would find it easy to deduce that the upmove might be ending. A
long black bar implies panic selling. But to interpret the white bar as an
ending burst in an uptrend is more subtle. Dozens of possible bar placement
combinations and permutations are possible. The next section covers several
of the most popular patterns.
674
Book VIII: Technical Analysis 

Two similar candlesticks or candlestick patterns often have the exact opposite
interpretation, depending on where they fall in a series. You have to memorize
the exact patterns to avoid getting confused.
Hammer and hanging man
Both the hammer and hanging man have a small real body and only one
shadow — a long lower shadow. The long shadow of the hammer extends 
to the downside off a white body, while the long shadow of the hanging man
extends to the downside off a black body (see Figure 3-6).
You’d think that the white-body version would automatically be a bullish
indicator and the black-body version a bearish one, but interpreting this
candlestick depends on its placement on the chart, regardless of the real-
body color. If the candlestick appears in a downtrend, for example, it marks
the likely end of the trend even if the real body is white.
You may see a hammer in many other contexts, but when it has a white body
and it comes after a series of black downtrending bars, as in Figure 3-6, it
implies reversal. Note that the close is higher than the previous close, too. In
this context, the long lower shadow means the sellers were able to achieve a
new low, but buyers emerged at some point during the day and the close was
higher than the open, indicating last-minute buying.

675
Chapter 3: Charting the Market with Candlesticks
Book VIII
Technical
Analysis

The hanging man looks the same except it has a black body coming after a series
of white uptrending bars. The long lower shadow marks the bulls’ failure to
prevent the bears making a new low and also from keeping the close below the
open. You may see this bar in other places within a series of bars, but when
you see it at the top of an uptrending series (as in Figure 3-6), you should
consider that the trend is probably over. The wise course is to take your 
profit and run.
Harami
A small real-body candlestick that comes after a bigger one, as shown in
Figure 3-7, is called a harami, which means pregnant in Japanese. A harami
implies that a change in sentiment is impending. Technically, the harami
pattern requires two bars, so it doesn’t stand alone. This chart shows the
shadows of the harami bar as also inside the scope of the first big bar, although
this isn’t essential to identifying the pattern.
A harami can be white or black, and in fact, it can even be a doji (inside day).
The smaller the real body is, the more powerful the implication that a reversal
is impending. In Figure 3-7, white bars, seemingly downtrending, are followed
by a large white bar, reflecting a high level of emotion. Seeing just the big
white bar after a series of smaller ones that are downtrending, you may think

MAN

676
Book VIII: Technical Analysis 

that the bulls finally got the upper hand, and this is the start of an uptrend —
especially because you have an indecision doji just ahead of it. The black
harami following the big white bar should disillusion you. If an uptrend was
forming, the harami just put the kibosh on it.
Turning to Reversal Patterns
Identifying reversals is the main application of candlesticks. The engulfing
candlestick and the shooting star, shown in Figure 3-8, are two of the most
popular and easily identified candlesticks showing reversal patterns:
 Engulfing candlestick: An engulfing pattern signals the reversal of a trend.
The word engulfing refers to the open and close of the bar encompassing
a wider range than the open and close of the day before. In Figure 3-8,
which shows a bearish engulfing candlestick, the engulfing nature is the
dominant characteristic, so that the lower close pops out at you even
though the bar also has a higher open. When a bar starts out at a higher
open but then closes at a lower level, the bears won that day. Not shown is
a bullish engulfing candlestick, which is white. The higher close is visually
compelling because the real body is so big.
 Shooting star: The shooting star is characterized by a small real body
and a long upper shadow, as you can see in Figure 3-8. As discussed in
the section “Really long shadows,” the shadow in an uptrend implies a
failure of the trend — a failure to close near the high. Notice the indecisive
doji bar just before the shooting star.

Recognizing Continuation Patterns
Candlestick patterns are most often used to identify reversals, but continuation
patterns do exist. As the name suggests, a continuation pattern gives you
confirmation that the trend in place will likely continue. Two such patterns
are the rising (or falling) window and the three white soldiers:
 Rising/falling window: Rising window is the term for a gap — in this
case, an upward gap. A downward gap is a falling window. (Go to Chapter 2
for more on gaps.) In Figure 3-9, the gap separates two white candlesticks,
which are themselves bullish. The next bar doesn’t fill the gap. The gap
between the two price bars is confirmation of the existing trend, and the
market’s refusal the following day to go back and fill the gap is further
confirmation that the trend is okay.
 Three white soldiers: The bottom bars in Figure 3-9 show three white
soldiers. In this pattern, what’s important are three large white candle-
sticks in a row. Seeing the close consistently over the open for three
days confirms that the price series is in an uptrend, and the size of the
bars indicates its robustness.

Book VIII: Technical Analysis 

Interpreting a Series of Patterns
To do a good job interpreting candlesticks, you need to understand the dynamic
and complex relationships of many patterns all at once, like juggling six oranges
instead of three. Figure 3-10 shows a series of candlesticks that reveal several
patterns. (Note: This figure also shows a set of parallel support and resistance
lines called a channel, which is used to outline the probable limit of future prices
moves, either up or down. You can read more about support and resistance in
Chapter 4.)
The harami is followed by a rising window (upward gap) and a big white
candle. These three candlesticks together are bullish and alert you to go back
and start the channel at the lowest low, the bar before the harami.
In reading this chart, notice that the real bodies push against the top of the
channel resistance line, but the doji, which suggests that traders are having
second thoughts, is followed by two higher white candles. The two white candles
indicate that the reconsideration of the move on the doji day culminated in
traders’ decision to keep taking the price up. This was an occasion when the
doji wasn’t a reversal indicator, at least not for the next day. After the two
white candles comes a bearish engulfing candle, a reversal warning that this
upmove may be ending. The engulfing candle alerts you to watch the next
day’s activity, especially the open, with an eagle eye.

No matter how compelling a particular bar may seem, you still need confirmation
of the interpretation, which comes only after you see the next day’s bar.
Sometimes you get a strong reversal pattern that is invalidated the very next
day, for example. Candlestick analysis may offer a forecast of the general
direction of the price move over the next day or few days, but it doesn’t
suggest the extent of the move — a price target.

S
ecurities prices move in regular ways that most professional traders (who
dominate the market) expect — and therefore create. Technical traders
have been developing patterns from the earliest days of technical analysis.
Chart patterns are powerful indicators, and having some rudimentary knowledge
of patterns is a good idea for the most sophisticated indicator trader and the
beginner alike.
Other things to know include support and resistance and breakout. Even a rough
application of these two concepts will save you a bundle or help you make
profits, because they’re among the top technical ruling concepts in the market.
This chapter explains the most common chart patterns and tells you how to
use these key concepts to recognize when a trend starts and stops.
Introducing Patterns
Chart patterns are indicators consisting of shapes, such as triangles, drawn on
the chart. Although most patterns employ straight lines (such as triangles), a
few use semi-circles or semi-ellipses (such as head-and-shoulders). In addition,
pattern lines generally follow either the highs or the lows.
Not everyone can see patterns right away. Pattern identification takes practice —
and a lot of drawing and redrawing of lines and shapes until you get the hang
of it. For example, consider Figure 4-1. Do you see the pattern?

682
Book VIII: Technical Analysis 
The pattern in Figure 4-1 is a symmetrical triangle, as you can see in Figure 4-2,
characterized by a series of lower highs along which you can draw one trendline
and a series of higher lows along which you can draw another trendline. The two
lines eventually come together at an apex. Before that point is reached, the price
must pierce one of the trendlines in the course of trading in its normal range.
Which one? Because most of the bars are trending downward, you imagine 
the odds favor a break to the downside. But it could also be to the upside.
Following are a few points to keep in mind as you try to identify and interpret
patterns:
 Pattern types are usually organized according to whether they forecast a
continuation or a reversal of the current price move, although many
patterns can be applied either way. As with most indicators, a price
forecast is embedded in the pattern identification.
 You usually see a burst of higher volume when a pattern reaches
completion. This makes sense — other chartists in the crowd are seeing
the same pattern. For triangles, low volume often precedes the breakout
and serves as a bonus warning of an impending move.

Figure 4-1:

pattern.

 Pattern identification doesn’t require that each single price in a series
line up perfectly. Not every price high hits an overhead resistance line,
for example. It suffices that several hit the line.
 All triangles — symmetrical, ascending, and descending — as well as
flags and pennants, and other patterns, incorporate support (top) and
resistance (bottom) lines.
Opinions differ on whether the top and bottom lines must enclose every
part of every price bar, or if it’s okay for the bar to break the line by a
tiny amount as a pattern is developing. In many patterns, such as double
tops and head-and-shoulders, drawing a rough outline that breaks some
price bars is good enough to identify the pattern, but discarding the
pattern when a bar breaks support or resistance is safer. So how do you
know when you may break a bar and when you shouldn’t? Fortunately,
technical traders and software designers are rapidly qualifying the
conditions that define each pattern. The real key is practice.
As with most aspects of technical analysis, a pattern is a work in progress,
and pattern identification can be frustrating and time-consuming. You may
think you see a pattern developing, only to have the price action change course
and fail to complete the expected formation. You may have to erase your work
and start over a number of times on any single set of bars. Resign yourself to
making a lot of mistakes. The reason to tolerate the pattern recognition process
is that when you get it right, you have a powerful forecasting tool that can
deliver 20 to 40 percent returns in a short period of time.
Identifying Continuation Patterns
A continuation pattern tells you that buying or selling pressure is pausing. If a
big-picture trend is well-established, the pattern suggests it will accelerate
after the pause. A continuation pattern is therefore a good place to add more
to a position, because you expect an additional move in the same direction.
Because continuation patterns tend to be fairly short-term, sometimes only a
few days, they’re often neglected.
Continuation patterns serve as reassurance that you’ve identified the trend
correctly. They also often point you to the ideal level at which to place a
stop-loss order.

Ascending and descending triangles
To draw ascending and descending triangles, you draw a line along the highs
of a price series and another one along the lows (see Figure 4-3) — just as
you do with symmetrical triangles.
In the ascending triangle, the price isn’t making new highs, and the topmost
(resistance) line is horizontal. You may worry that the failure to make new
highs means the upmove is over. But the price isn’t making new lows, either.
You expect a breakout of the top line to the upside.
When you can draw a horizontal line along a series of highs, remember to
look for a rising line along the lows at the same time. Not only does the
ascending line confirm the trend continuation, but it also provides you with 
a ready-made stop-loss level at the ascending support line. The ascending
triangle pattern delivers the expected rise about two-thirds of the time, but it
fails about 32 percent of the time. If you wait for prices to close above the top
trendline, then the failure rate drops to a mere 2 percent. The expected rise,
by the way, is equal to the height of the triangle pattern.
A descending triangle is the mirror image of the ascending triangle. The
important point is that the price is failing to make new lows in the prevailing
downtrend. You wonder if the trend is failing. But if you can still draw a line
along the series of lower highs, it would be a mistake to buy at this point —
the probability is high that the downtrend is going to continue.

Pennants and flags
A pennant is shaped like a triangle — converging lines — but the price swing
between the top and bottom lines is smaller (see Figure 4-4). Usually a pennant
lasts only a few days and hardly ever longer than three weeks. A pennant is a
form of retracement accompanied by a drop in volume. A flag is another
retracement, but its support and resistance lines are parallel (see Figure 4-5).
A trend is usually punctuated by minor retracement moves in the opposite
direction when traders take profit and set off a small cascade of profit-taking
by others. With pennants and flags, the pattern lasts an average of 10 to 11
days and is accompanied by falling volume. In Figure 4-5, note the gray line
that roughly describes the overall uptrend. Whenever you get a retracement
like a pennant or a flag (and often with ascending or descending triangles,
too), you have to broaden your vision of the price move because the pattern
causes the longer-term high–low range of the entire period to widen.
Technically, a series of lower lows in an uptrend breaks and ends the trend,
and a series of higher highs breaks and ends a downtrend. But if the retrace-
ment is minor and the pattern qualifies as a continuation pattern, the trend is
still in place — it just has to be seen in a wider perspective.

If you have confidence in the trend, you can tolerate a minor and short-lived
break when it’s a pennant or flag doing the breaking. In fact, pennants and
flags are what pattern chartists call half-mast patterns. That is, they form
midway in a trend, and you can project the distance already traveled from
the start of the trend from the pattern to estimate the end of the trend.
If you don’t see a drop in volume with flags and pennants, you may be looking
at a reversal rather than a continuation pattern.
Dead-cat bounce — phony reversal
A dead-cat bounce, shown in Figure 4-6, is a peculiar continuation pattern
that looks like a reversal at the beginning, with a sizeable upward retrace-
ment of a downmove, but then fades back to the same downward direction.
Note that a dead-cat bounce occurs only in downmoves, and no equivalent
named pattern exists for a parallel sequence of events in an upmove.
The dead cat-pattern starts off with a negative fundamental event that trig-
gers a massive downmove. The bounce is an upward retracement that may
make you think the drop is over. The pattern includes a breakaway downside
gap about 80 percent of the time, and sometimes the bounce upward fills part
of the gap. (See Chapter 2 for a discussion of gaps.) Many traders mistakenly
think that if a gap is filled, even partly, the preceding move has ended. The
dead-cat bounce is one of the patterns that disproves that idea.

Noting Classic Reversal Patterns
Patterns come into their own when used to identify a trend reversal. No
matter what way a trend comes to an end, chances are good that a pattern
exists to identify it.
Double bottom
A double bottom looks like a W (see Figure 4-7) and predicts a price breakout
to the upside and substantial gains. A valid double bottom includes these
characteristics:
 A minimum of 10 days between the two lows and sometimes as long as
two or three months.
 A 4 percent or less price variation between the two lows.
 A center upmove of at least 10 percent from the lower of the two bottoms.
 A price that rises above the confirmation line (which confirms that the
pattern is indeed a double bottom and the forecast of a continued rise is
correct).
The confirmation line is a horizontal line drawn from the highest high 
in the middle of the W. The point where the price rises above the line is
called the confirmation point. Reaching the confirmation line drawn hori-
zontally from the confirmation point is the most important identification
key of the double bottom. This is where you buy.

Technical
Analysis

Notice that some of the price bars break the lines you draw to form the
double bottom pattern. Breaking some of the bars is allowed in a formation
where the line is not a support or resistance line.
Not every twin bottom is a true double bottom. Only about one-third of all
the patterns that look like a double bottom end up meeting the confirmation
criterion. In other words, the pattern fails about two-thirds of the time. This
sounds terrible, but on the occasions when you do get confirmation, the
double bottom is tremendously reliable. If you wait for the price to break
above the confirmation line, the pattern delivers a profit an astonishing 97
percent of the time — and the average gain is 40 percent.
Other characteristics of a double bottom are
 A large increase in volume on the price crossing above the confirmation
line, demonstrating increased interest by the crowd and implying wide-
spread recognition of the pattern.
 Frequent retracements to the downside right after the price breaks the
confirmation line. A retracement occurs 68 percent of the time in con-
firmed double bottoms, making it hard, psychologically, to hang on to
the trade that you just put on only a few days before when the price
crossed the confirmation line.
Not every double bottom pattern is as easy to detect as the one in Figure 4-7.
One or both of the two lows of the double bottom could be rounded instead
of pointed, for example. Often the two lows of a double bottom are separated
by several months or even a year, and it’s easy to miss the pattern altogether.
Also, minor retracements and other wobbles within the W can obscure the
pattern.
Double tops
A double top is the mirror image of the double bottom — it looks like the
letter M. The price makes a high, pulls back on profit-taking (as usual), and
then bullish traders try but fail to surpass the first high. The failure to rally a
second time through the first high means the bulls were beaten and the bears
are now in charge. A true double top is usually accompanied by falling
volume as the second top is being formed.
As with the double bottom, you need to see the price surpass the confirmation
level (the lowest point in the center bar of the M) for the pattern to be valid.
When that condition is not met, twin tops fail to deliver a sustained down-
move 65 percent of the time. When the condition is met, however, the pattern
688
Book VIII: Technical Analysis 

delivers a downmove 83 percent of the time, which is less reliable than the
double bottom (97 percent), but still impressive. The average drop after a
confirmed double top is 20 percent and lasts three months.
Again, as with double bottoms, the price pulls back after the confirmation 69
percent of the time, leaving you to doubt the pattern. Fortunately, the pullback
period averages only ten days before the downtrend resumes.
The triple top: Head-and-shoulders
The head-and-shoulders pattern is a triple top that’s easy to see; one bump
forms the left shoulder, a higher bump forms a head, and a third bump forms
the right shoulder. Figure 4-8 shows two examples. A triple top or bottom is
somewhat rarer than the double version, but the meaning is the same — the
price fails to surpass the previous low or high, signaling a trend reversal.
The head-and-shoulders patterns shown in Figure 4-8 are easy enough to see,
but many head-and-shoulders patterns are more complex and contain other
patterns within them. The second head-and-shoulders pattern in Figure 4-8,
for example, contains a little double top and a gap (see Chapter 2). You may
also see what appears to be two heads or two shoulders, although one is
always higher, which makes it the head.

Chapter 4: Seeing Patterns and Drawing Trendlines
Book VIII
Technical
Analysis

In a head-and-shoulders pattern, the confirmation line connects the low point
of each shoulder and is named the neckline. The price breaking the neckline
predicts a price decline, whether the neckline is sloping upward or downward.
Seldom do you see the neckline perfectly horizontal. A downward-sloping
neckline tends to deliver the biggest price move.
A head-and-shoulders pattern usually forms after a long uptrend. The dip
from the first shoulder represents the normal retracement after a new high.
The head then represents the triumph of bullish sentiment and sets a new
higher high. The dip after the higher-high head represents more profit-taking,
whereupon the bulls buy again. When the bulls are making their third try at a
rally, their price target is the last highest high, which is the top of the head.
The failure of the second shoulder to surpass the head is the end of the rally.
Buying demand diminishes and selling pressure takes hold, forcing prices
down, completing the pattern.
As with double tops and bottoms, some traders refuse to accept the pattern,
and they cause a pullback to the confirmation line 45 percent of the time.
Pullbacks average only 11 days before the stock resumes its decline. This is
your last chance to jump off before the price hits the wall.
As with every trend that’s losing steam, volume falls after the head, although
about half the time the highest volume is at the left shoulder and about half
the time at the head. Volume is low at the second shoulder. Volume on the
breakout day and the next few days after the breakout day, however, tends to
be very large, because by that point a great number of chart-oriented traders
have identified the pattern and its neckline.
Drawing Trendlines
A trendline is a straight line that starts at the beginning of the trend and stops
at the end of the trend. Often you can see a trend with the naked eye, but to
impose order on your visual impression, you can connect the dots by actu-
ally drawing a line along the price bars. You can do this the low-tech way by
using a piece of paper and a pencil, or go high-tech with software like Excel
or special charting software. Figuring out where trends start and stop can be
complicated, but this section explains how to spot them, plot them, and
figure out what they’re telling you.
When you look at a chart of a securities price, sometimes the trendline pops
out at you. Other times, a line isn’t obvious, in which case you study the
chart for a few minutes and may even draw a few experimental lines.
Take a look at Figure 4-9, which shows experimental trendlines. Which one is
correct? None of them — and all of them. The first two lines on the left connect
a series of lows, but then the price breaks the line to the downside, so they’re
690
Book VIII: Technical Analysis 

abandoned. The heavy line through the center is another kind of a trendline,
the linear regression, discussed later in the chapter. This line does a pretty
good job of cutting off the high–low extremes and representing the essence of
the total move. Finally, the longest trendline connects the three major lows.
How do you know if this is the right trendline or if another new low will come
along? You don’t know. You know only afterwards that new highs are going to
reappear and keep the trendline alive.
Here are a few things to remember about drawing trendlines:
 The time frame of the chart you’re looking at influences what you see. A
trader with a long-term time frame sees one trend on this chart, whereas
a swing trader with a shorter time frame sees three trends (two
upmoves punctuated by a downmove).
 In order to see the single long-term trendline, you have to accept that
charting is a dynamic process. Your work is never done. Every day (or
hour, or week) provides new data. You need to be willing to discard a
trendline when it stops representing the trend — or to restore an old
trendline with some minor modifications if your original drawing turns
out to be right. In this case, the move is a big-picture uptrend, but you
don’t know it for sure until late in the move.

Chapter 4: Seeing Patterns and Drawing Trendlines
Book VIII
Technical
Analysis

 In the transition from a downtrend to an uptrend, you can’t draw a single
line that captures the trend, because no single trend exists that captures
both moves. In other instances, all you can see is a meandering line that’s
practically horizontal. This may be a pause while the same trend resumes,
or it may mark the transition period from up to down or down to up.
 No security is in a trending mode all the time. So be realistic about
whether a trendline is drawable. Often, you can’t draw a trendline on the
chart you have in front of you, but if you generate another chart with a
longer time frame (for instance a weekly chart), drawing a trendline
becomes possible.
Forming impressionistic trendlines
Freehand, or impressionistic, trendlines are useful in confirming or denying
that a security is on a trend — and in identifying which direction the trend is
going. You can visually identify trends in many different and equally valid
ways. In general, though, you’re aiming to start and stop your trendlines at
obvious highs and lows:
 Uptrend: Spot an obvious low and carry your eye along higher highs
(tops) and higher lows to an obvious high. Take a look at Figure 4-10. The
first line, starting from the left, starts at a low and ends at a high.
 Downtrend: The next trendline in Figure 4-10 is a downtrend. It starts at
the high and goes to the low. In the case of a downtrend, your eye starts
at an obvious high and follows successively lower highs and lower lows
(bottoms) to an obvious low. (Of course, you know it’s the lowest low
only after the fact.)
The third line is an uptrend, and it stops at a high. That high is duplicated a
little later by another high at nearly the same level — see the area in the
circle. So wait a minute — shouldn’t that second uptrend go to the second
high and not the first?
The trendline should end at the highest high, and if you see a higher one, you
shouldn’t end the trendline yet. In Figure 4-10, the second high is near the
first high, but not actually higher. That’s why the trendline stops at the first
high. In fact, the second high forms a pattern named a double top (see the
earlier section “Double tops”).
692
Book VIII: Technical Analysis 

For purposes of drawing trendlines, use the highs and lows — but don’t
totally ignore the close. It’s possible to get a wild random move that creates a
spike high or a spike low that isn’t consistent with the overall trend. In fact,
Figure 4-10 has a doozy of a spike (see the price bar in the ellipse). What should
you think about this spike? Well, its sheer size confirms negative sentiment
toward the security, even if the sharp upmove afterwards gives you cause for
doubt. But the high after the downward spike doesn’t match or surpass the
highest high, confirming that the bulls are losing this battle and the bears are
about to triumph.
Creating rule-based trendlines
A rule-based trendline is one that starts and stops according to well-defined
conditions, such as a line starting at the lowest low of the last three days and
ending at the highest high of the last three days. A rule-based trendline is
better than an impressionistic trendline for three reasons:
 It doesn’t let you impose your personal view of what the trend should be.
 It improves your ability (and self-confidence) to buy a security when its
price is rising or sell it when the price is falling.
 It helps prevent loss by showing you the exit at the right time.
Figure 4-10:

Book VIII
Technical
Analysis

To draw a rule-based trendline for an uptrend, follow these steps:
1. Start at the lowest low and connect the line to the next low that pre-
cedes a new high.
2. As long as new highs are being made, redraw the line to connect to
the lowest low before the last high.
3. When prices stop making new highs, stop drawing. Extend the line out
into the future at the same slope.
To draw a rule-based trendline for a downtrend, follow these steps:
1. Start at the highest high and connect the line to the next high that pre-
cedes a new low.
2. As long as new lows are being made, redraw the line to connect to the
highest high before the last low.
3. When prices stop making new lows, stop drawing. Extend the line out
into the future at the same slope.
Notice that this is a dynamic process. You often have to erase one line and
draw another one as conditions change.
Drawing support lines
In Figure 4-11, the trendline illustrates the rule-based trendline named a support
line. It’s named support because you expect the line to support the price —
traders won’t let the price fall below it. To draw a support line, you start at
the lowest low and draw a line to the next low. This generates a line that can
be extended at the same slope, but it becomes a trendline only when another
daily price low touches the line.
Knowing when to enter
The support line entry rule says “Buy on the third touch of the support line
by the low of a price bar.” The third touch is confirmation that the line is
more than just a line and is a true trendline. When you use the support trend-
line as a trading guide, you initiate a new position on the confirmation, or
third touch.
You use the support line to identify an uptrend. The price is rising, and rising
consistently. This provides comfort that the purchase of this security is
returning a profit and may continue to return a profit. Notice that on many
days, the low price touched the line but didn’t cross it.
694
Book VIII: Technical Analysis 

The more times that a low-of-the-day touches the support line without crossing
it, the more confidence you should have that it is a valid description of the
trend. This is called a test of support and encourages buyers of the security to
buy more after the price passes the test. Fresh buying constitutes demand for
the security and is called accumulation. Those who already own the security
are reluctant to sell it after support has passed the test, and now require a
higher price to put their inventory of the security on offer.
Sometimes traders engineer a test of support by selling the security down to
the support line to see if support will hold. If you put on a new long position
above the support line, you’re sweating bullets when traders test support.
Will holders of the security rush in to buy more of the security to defend
their position? When the support line does hold, the traders who were selling
become big buyers. They’ve just been given proof that the bulls put their
money where their mouths are.
Some technical traders say that to require a third touch is to be overly cautious
and to miss out on some perfectly good trends that fail to meet the third-
touch qualification. This is true — many valid trends do have only two
touches before they end. If you’re waiting for the third touch, you may miss
the entire move. But experience shows that your trust is better placed in a
trendline with three or more touches. You’re taking more risk if you accept
two touches.

Knowing when to exit: The breakout
The support line exit rule says “Sell when the low of the price bar falls 
below the support line.”
When any part of the price bar penetrates the line on the downside, support
has been broken, and you may think that the trend is over. This may or may
not be true. In Figure 4-11, the move continues after the line was broken —
but experience teaches that the trendline is no longer reliable. A break of sup-
port is literally just that — some holders of the stock were willing to break
ranks with the other holders and to sell at progressively lower prices.
A breakout is any part of the price bar penetrating a line that you drew on the
chart. The word breakout is used in a dozen contexts in technical analysis,
but it always refers to a significant violation of the trend. Sometimes the
offending breakout is quickly roped back into the herd, but usually a breakout
means that the trend is changing direction, either right away or sometime soon.
A one-day break of the line is called a false breakout. To estimate whether a
breakout may be false, master trader Larry Williams recommends you con-
sider the position of the close on the day before the breakout. In an uptrend,
if the close is at or near the high, chances are good that it’s a false breakout.
The breakout was due to profit-taking that got carried away, it was triggered
by a false rumor, or it was a random move. If the close on the day before is at
or near the low, though, chances are the breakout is real.
Even though you should discard the support line as a trading tool after it’s
been broken, you may want to leave it on the chart for a while. Sometimes
old support becomes new resistance (and vice versa; see the next section).
Drawing resistance lines
Resistance is the mirror image of support: A line drawn along a series of highs
marks where buyers resist buying more — the price is too high for them.
Traders expect sellers to emerge at the resistance line (taking profit). As a
securities buyer, you’re mainly concerned with the support line, but you should
care about identifying a downtrend using the resistance line for two reasons:
 When a downtrend ends, the next move may be an uptrend. Because you
want to get in on the action as early as possible, you care when a down-
trend is broken to the upside. The breakout is an important clue that an
uptrend may be starting and you should start paying attention.
 Someday, you may sell short.
Figure 4-12 shows multiple resistance lines, each starting at the January high
and ending at places where the price breaks the trendline.
696
Book VIII: Technical Analysis 

Looking at the first (shortest) line, start at the January high and connect the
line to the first high on January 17. The third touch comes on February 6. The
price tests resistance for the next two days and breaks above the line on
February 11. The trend may be over. You should buy it back, or cover the
short position, the first time the price closes above the line.
The more times the high-of-the-day touches the resistance line and doesn’t
cross it, the more confidence you have that it is a valid description of the
trend. This is called a test of resistance and encourages sellers of the security
to sell more after the price passes the test. Fresh selling constitutes supply of
the security and is called distribution. Those who own the security are reluc-
tant to hold it after resistance was proved to resist an effort to break above it.
They’re willing to sell their inventory at increasingly lower prices.
In this instance, the exit rule caused a loss. After the buy-back exit specified
on the chart, the price moved up a bit and then resumed its downtrend. You
could start a new resistance line, but — following the rules — you can also go
back to the highest high on the chart. You draw another line, but it connects
only two highs and is violated to the upside on the very day of the third
touch. Finally, on the third try, you connect the starting point to another high
and it is confirmed by a third touch in March — several touches, in fact. You
initiate the short trade position and hold it all the way to August, when the
price breaks out above the resistance line.

Technical
Analysis

In trend-following trading, you never enter at the absolute high and never exit
at the absolute low. The goal is to capture most of the trend. You hardly ever
capture all of the trend.
Fine-tuning support and resistance
You need patience and persistence to work with trendlines because you need
to adjust the lines often, sometimes daily.
 Trend reversal: The uptrend that you identified by drawing the support
line (Figure 4-11) turned into a downtrend a few weeks later. This is 
often — but not always — the case. As the resistance case demonstrates
(Figure 4-12), a trendline breakout doesn’t necessarily lead to formation
of a trend in the opposite direction. In the resistance case, it led to
resumption of the same trend (downward). The move upward that
occurred after the first breakout above the resistance line is called a
retracement, correction, or pullback. At the time it’s occurring, you don’t
know whether it’s a full trend reversal or just a retracement. Drawing
trendlines is especially frustrating and difficult during retracement
periods, and you’ll take a lot of losses if you use trendlines alone to
make trading decisions.
 Sideways movements: In both the support and resistance trendline
cases, the price entered a period of sideways price movements just
before the breakout of the line that triggered the exit rule (the “Sell”
point in Figure 4-11). Such sideways periods, named congestion, are
common during trends as well as when a trend is ending. Another term
for a sideways price movement is consolidation, which refers to market
participants consolidating their ideas about the security being traded.
Consolidation often — but not always — precedes a breakout of the
trendline.
Drawing internal trendlines: 
Linear regression
Wouldn’t it be nice to know the “true” trendline — a line that would reveal the
hidden trendedness of the prices without at the same time alerting everybody
and his brother to attack or defend specific levels? Such a line does exist. It’s
a line that goes through the center of the price series rather than along its
edges, like support and resistance.
698
Book VIII: Technical Analysis 

How do you draw a straight line through the center of each price bar?
Technically, you can’t, as least not on any chart where the prices jump around
at all. But scientists have a solution to jumpiness: to “fit” a line that minimizes
the distance from itself to each price along the line. The best-fit line is named the
linear regression line, linear referring to line and regression referring to the
mathematical calculation.
You can’t draw an accurate linear regression without first performing a complex
statistical calculation. Fortunately, you don’t need to know how the line is calcu-
lated to be able to use it. Spreadsheet software and all charting packages come
with the linear regression already built-in.
In Figure 4-13, the linear regression line doesn’t actually go through the center
of each price bar. But if you look closely, you’ll see that no other line gets you
as close to Point A and to Point B at the same time. Only one linear regression
exists for any set of prices on the chart.
A linear regression is the true, pure trendline. If you accept the core concept
of technical analysis, that a trend will continue in the same direction, at least
for a while, now you can extend the true trendline and obtain a forecast. In some
software packages, a linear regression extension is called exactly that — “a
time-series forecast.” This is tremendously useful. You have created a high-
probability forecast for the upcoming period that gives you perspective on what
to expect.

If you’re going to draw only one line, the linear regression is a good choice. If
you select a good starting point, the linear regression delivers pure trend.
Unlike support and resistance lines, the linear regression line doesn’t have any
trading rules associated directly with it, but visually, it’s the most informative
line. As you create linear regression lines, keep these things in mind:
 Figuring out where to start and where to end a linear regression line is the
first big obstacle in using the line in a practical way. The simple answer is
to start it at an obvious high or low. This means you need to look back-
ward at the historical data on the chart to see where the current move
began. This can be trickier than it sounds. You can get very different
slopes, depending on how tightly you want the data to fit to the line.
Seeing a welter of slopes covering up your chart can get very frustrating.
But stick to it. The linear regression could save your bacon someday.
 The linear regression line can slope this way or that way or no way
(horizontal), depending on where you start drawing. If you take a V-
shaped price series like the one in Figure 4-14 and draw a single linear
regression line, you get . . . garbage. Obviously two trends on a chart
require two linear regressions. In other words, you can draw linear
regression lines that are totally useless. They’ll still be scientifically
accurate in that they depict the best fit possible of the line to the data,
and everyone else will get the same result, but they won’t advance the
cause of making a profit in the market or preventing a loss.
 You can do some really dumb things using the linear regression line, too.
If you extend a line out into the indefinite future, you get a fantasy, not a
forecast. The market is a collection of human beings, not a science
project. Prices simply don’t move in a straight line indefinitely.

rawing a straight-line trendline and extending it out into the future
suggests what the price may be in days to come. Actually, a trendline
suggests only the general neighborhood of future prices. If the trendline is a
support line, you expect the price not to fall below it, but that doesn’t tell
you anything about how high it may go. With a linear regression line, you
expect future prices to cluster around the line, but some outliers are always
possible. In short, common sense tells you that you can’t forecast future
prices to the penny.
While nobody can create a pinpoint forecast, we can forecast the range of
probable future prices. Range refers to the same high–low range of the price
bar described in Chapter 2, only encompassing a larger number of price bars
in a series — weeks and months rather than only a few days.
In this chapter, I describe the straight-line channel and its forecasting capabil-
ities. I show you two ways to build a straight-line channel forecast and outline
how to interpret the information you see on the chart. I also talk about using
pivot-point analysis to draw horizontal support and resistance, for use either
in non-directional situations or with trend channels.

Channel-Drawing Basics
A channel is a pair of straight-line trendlines encasing a price series. It
consists of one line drawn along the top of a price series and another line,
parallel to the first, along the bottom of the price series.
The purpose of the channel is to train your eye to accept prices within its
borders as on the trend and to detect prices outside its borders as off the
trend (and perhaps ending the trend). In other words, the channel is a wider
measure of trending behavior than a single line. As long as prices remain
within the channel, you deduce that the trend is still in place.
Depending on the raw material of your price bars, you can
 Start with a top line connecting at least two highs, and draw the bottom
line parallel to it.
 Start with the bottom line connecting at least two lows, and draw the
top line parallel to that.
 Draw a linear regression line (see Chapter 4) and draw the top and
bottom of the channel at equal distances on either side of it.
How do you know when a high or low is obvious and the right place to start a
trendline? An obvious high or low is named a swing point, because it’s the last
highest high or lowest low in a series of higher highs or lower lows. The trend
may seem to continue for a few more bars after the highest high or lowest
low. You don’t always get a sharp, clear-cut reversal exactly at the swing bar.
But a few days after a swing bar, the reversal or swing point becomes visually
obvious. Can you mistakenly identify a swing point? You bet. When drawing
trendlines, you have to resign yourself to erasing a lot.
You can draw channels to enclose every part of every price bar in the series,
or you can draw the channels to allow some minor breaking of the lines. (In
the section “Neatness counts” later in the chapter, I describe the pros and
cons of allowing minor breakage.) Whatever your starting point (top, bottom,
or linear regression) and whether you encase some or all of the price series,
consider the top line of the channel to be resistance and the bottom line of
the channel to be support.
Constructing a channel by drawing parallel support and resistance lines orga-
nizes your vision. You expect future price highs not to exceed the top of the
channel (resistance) and upcoming price lows not to exceed the bottom of
the channel (support). The parallel lines tell you the maximum probable
future price range. Note that word probable. Channels are visually compelling
and can seduce you into thinking that the forecast range must occur. It’s all
too easy to start drawing channels and forget that they’re only a forecast. A
zillion factors can come out of the blue and knock your trend off the rails.

Channels, whether hand-drawn or software-drawn, aren’t always as neat and
tidy as the examples I use in the following sections. Some securities never
offer the opportunity to draw a tidy channel, and some securities offer a tidy
channel only some of the time. But the longer a tidy channel lasts, the more
confident you can feel that you have correctly identified a trend.
Drawing channels by hand
Figure 5-1 is a model perfect channel, but you’ll be astonished at how often
you can draw a channel like this on a real security. Here’s how you do it:
1. Start by connecting the two lows at the lower left. This is the support
line. Notice that they’re the two relative lows because a bar with a
higher low comes in-between.
2. With your ruler, you extend that line into the future.
3. To form the top of the channel, you have to wait for the next relative
high. A relative high can be seen only after you get an intervening lower
high (got that?). On the chart, the highest high is the last of three higher
highs. You go back to the highest high and start a line parallel to the
support line from it. This is the resistance line.
4. Extend the resistance line into the future.

Analysis

Note that sometimes you later get a higher high and have to shift the entire
resistance line up, keeping it parallel. Oddly, a high proportion of new highs
stop at the old resistance line, even though some stop at the new resistance
line, too. It’s like having two equally valid resistance lines. To be on the safe
side, consider the farther-away channel line as the more important one. The
same thing is true of a second, farther-away support line.
On the chart in Figure 5-1, the extension lines are gray. At the time they’re
first drawn, the extended lines are hypothetical (not proven) support and
hypothetical resistance.
The lines stop being hypothetical and become actual support and resistance
when the next high or low touches the extended line but doesn’t break it, vali-
dating the extension process. The circles in Figure 5-1 mark where the next high
and low occur in this price series — and they occur at the hypothetical support
and resistance lines. You know that you’ve drawn your channel line correctly
when a third relative high or low makes a touch of the line but doesn’t cross it,
making that touch a confirmation point.
706
Book VIII: Technical Analysis 
Why are the lines parallel?
When you draw a support line connecting a
series of lows, you often see a parallel resis-
tance line that mysteriously connects the high-
est highs. This is so common that most charting
software programs have a standard command —
“create parallel line.” No one knows why support
and resistance lines are so often parallel. Here
are a few explanations:
 This kind of orderliness appears when the
high–low trading range is stable. Volume is
steady, too. It’s an orderly crowd trading the
security, so the channel is orderly. Market
participants know where the price is rela-
tively high — at the top of the channel. They
expect no more gains at this point and are
prepared to sell at the top to put their money
to better use in some other security. Die-
hard buyers, in turn, see when the price is
relatively cheap — down around the support
line. They add to their position, propelling the
price upward.
 Many technical analysts perceive a cyclical
quality to the ebb and flow of prices within
a channel. They rely on the security alter-
nating between support and resistance,
and the perceived cycle is the basis of their
trading plan. This often works, at least for
short periods, as long as you don’t project
the price bouncing off the support or resis-
tance line several cycles into the future. In
other words, don’t get cocky. You never
know when fresh news is going to come
along and cause prices to break the channel.
 Humans have an innate need to impose
order on a chaotic universe — or market.
Parallel lines don’t always appear, of
course, but they appear often enough that
observers speak of trading ranges with a
certain air of authority. When you hear of a
trading range, this kind of parallel support
and resistance channel is usually what the
commentator has in mind.

Letting software do the drawing
Another way to capture the collective habit of market participants is to draw
the linear regression line, as described in Chapter 4, and then to build a channel
on either side of it. Instead of drawing the support and resistance lines by
hand and extending them out, you let the software do the drawing. See the later
section “Riding the Regression Range” for information on how the channel is
calculated mathematically.
Whichever way you draw the channel, you apply the same expectations about
the collective behavior of the market participants, and you assume that future
relative highs and relative lows are going to fall within the same range. The
principle of extending support and resistance lines is the same whether you
draw them by hand or use the linear regression as an anchor.
Noting the benefits of 
straight-line channels
When you use straight lines to represent a range, you get a chart that’s easy
to read. Your eye fills in the blanks. Benefits are:
 Straight-line channels imply absolute limits that give you comfort and
the sense that you know where you stand.
 When a new price touches the channel top or bottom but then retreats,
you believe that the channel limits are correctly drawn and valid — and
will likely work next time, too. The more often a price touches a support
or resistance line but doesn’t cross it, the more reliable you can consider
the line to be.
 If a channel line is broken, you feel certain that something significant has
happened to the perception of the security by its market participants.
Violation of the channel alerts you to changing conditions and the need
to consider making a trading decision.
Recognizing drawbacks 
of straight-line channels
If your price series is orderly and doesn’t vary much day-to-day from the
average, the straight-line channel is fairly narrow. But if your chart contains a
disorderly price move, one on which each price seems unrelated to the one
before and prices jump around all over the place, your channel lines have to
be so far apart that you can’t judge what is usual or normal.
707
Chapter 5: Transforming Channels into Forecasts
Book VIII
Technical
Analysis

To some extent, a channel is valid because many others can see the same thing.
One of the reasons that a technical analysis method works is because it creates a
self-fulfilling prophecy. When everyone can see the same lines, a consensus builds
as to what constitutes breaking the lines. When you draw a channel so wide or so
narrow that only you can see it, you can’t expect other traders to respond to it. To
forecast a price range is really to forecast the probable collective behavior of the
people who trade the security.
Using Channels to Make 
Profit and Avoid Loss
When you have confidence that the channel broadly describes the trend:
 You can buy near the channel bottom and sell near the channel top —
over and over again, as long as the channel lasts.
 You can estimate your future gain. If the width of the channel is $5 and
you bought near a support line, your maximum probable gain over the
next few days is about $5 — as long as the channel remains in place and
you’re able to sell near the resistance line. This is more useful than you
may think at first.
• It’s a sanity check: You can’t reasonably expect a gain that would
call for a price far outside the channel.
• It’s a reality check: You can use the channel to evaluate a forecast
made by someone else. If the forecaster is calling for a price far
outside the channel, you have grounds to question the forecast.
 You can calculate your maximum loss. Regardless of where you bought
the security, you know that when a price bar breaks the bottom support
line of the channel, the channel is no longer valid. The trend is likely
over. This is the point at which you want to sell. And you don’t have to
wait for the actual breakout. You can place a stop-loss order with your
broker at the breakout level.
Dealing with Breakouts
The breakout is one of the most important concepts in technical analysis. It’s
a direct, graphic representation that something happened to change the market’s
sentiment toward the security. In the simplest terms, a breakout implies that a
trend is over, at least in its present form. After a breakout, the price can go up,
down, or sideways, but it seldom resumes at exactly the same level and rate of
change you had before the breakout.
708
Book VIII: Technical Analysis 

A breakout must always be respected, but you want to be sure it’s authentic.
Because so many traders draw support and resistance lines, there’s always
some wise guy in the market who tries to push the price through the lines. In
an uptrend that’s retracing downward, he tries to break the support line and
panic holders into selling. He may believe in the uptrend; he’s just trying to
get a lower price for himself. In a downtrend, he’s the joker who buys so much
that the price puts in a new high and a close higher than on previous days,
which scares the pants off sellers, who then cover their shorts and propel the
price higher. In addition, a breakout can be just a random aberration.
Distinguishing between false breakouts
and the real thing
You often see a tiny breakout and don’t know how to evaluate it. Say your
support line is at precisely $10 and the low of the price bar is $9.75. Is that a
legitimate breakout or just an accident? Sometimes you have to accept
imperfection and live with ambiguity. The channel lines are an estimate, not a
certainty.
Or sometimes you get a minor break of a channel line that lasts one or two
days, but then the price returns back inside its channel and performs just as
before. The breakout was a false breakout, which is a breach of a trendline that
then fails to deliver the expected additional moves in the same direction (see
Figure 5-2). To call it false is misleading, because the price bar unmistakably
breaks the trendline. What’s false is the conclusion you draw from it — that
the trend is over.

709
Chapter 5: Transforming Channels into Forecasts
Book VIII
Technical
Analysis

False breakouts are especially damaging because you may automatically
assume that the breakout means a reversal. This isn’t necessarily so, but it’s
tempting to jump on a breakout because the first few periods (usually days)
after a breakout are often the best time to get in on the action. As much as
one-quarter to one-third of a post-breakout move occurs in the first few days.
It takes courage to jump on a security that just had a breakout, especially if
you can’t discover why it broke out. If you look for fresh news to justify the
price pop but can’t find any, you need to be suspicious. It may be false.
In Figure 5-2, the channel does define the high–low trading range, after all.
Sometimes you have to accept one or two violations of your lines. The challenge,
of course, is that you don’t know right away whether a breakout is meaningful
or just a random outcome. I provide some answers to this question in the
following section.
The first line of defense
Your first line of defense is the configuration of the breakout bar. A simple
judgment is to see whether the breakout is a violation of the channel line by
the close, and not just the high or low. The close is the bar component that
best summarizes sentiment. A high or a low can be a random aberration. The
close is less likely to be random.
A special version of the close rule is to evaluate whether the bar that breaks
the line is a key reversal bar, which is a form of outside day. When you’re in
an uptrend, the key reversal bar has a promising open — above yesterday’s
close. The price even makes a new high over yesterday’s high, but then the
price crashes and delivers a close at or near the low and below yesterday’s
low. The market psychology isn’t hard to read — the day started out well but
then something happened to make negative sentiment rule the day, right into
the close.
In a downtrend, the key reversal bar initially confirms the trend — the open
is below yesterday’s close and the price even makes a lower low. But then the
price reverses direction and rallies strongly into the close, so that the close is
above yesterday’s high. Good news must have come out.
Opinion differs on whether the key reversal bar is definitive. Some traders
swear by it while others say that you wouldn’t want to make trading decisions
on the key reversal bar alone — you should have additional confirming factors
or at least be able to verify the “news” that caused the abrupt change of
sentiment during the day.
710
Book VIII: Technical Analysis 

Does volume verify?
Breakouts are often accompanied by a change in volume, usually an easily-
noticed higher level. This is in keeping with interpreting events on the chart
in terms of supply and demand. You can verify that the breakout isn’t random
by seeing an equivalent change in volume:
 Increase in volume: Extraordinarily high volume on one or two days is
named a volume spike and often accompanies the end of a strong trend,
either a rally or a crash. Buying and selling interest is frenzied.
 Decrease in volume: If volume declines steeply after holding steady at
about the same level over the life of your trend, demand is falling off but
so is selling interest. You don’t necessarily know what falling volume
means, but it may foreshadow a breakout. All the people who wanted to
sell have done so, and the people still holding an inventory aren’t willing
to sell at the current price. It’s like a logjam. It will be broken up when
either the bull camp or the bear camp takes the initiative and causes a
new high or new low, with accompanying higher volume.
Size matters — and so does duration
You can use a filter to estimate whether a breakout is meaningful or can be
ignored. A filter is a formula or a procedure used to modify an indicator. In
this instance, the indicator is the break of the channel line. A filter can modify
the amount or duration of the breakout.
 To modify the size of the indicator, you add some percentage of the total
range to the channel line. You stipulate that to constitute a real break of
the channel line, the new high or low must surpass this extra amount.
If the channel is $5 wide, you can specify that a price has to violate the
line by more than 5 percent (or 25 cents). Anything less wouldn’t be a
real breakout. Where does 5 percent come from? Why not 10 percent or
20 percent? Any one of them may be effective, or none of them. You need
to experiment with each security to see whether it has a habit of breaking
its lines by this amount or that amount. You can also specify that the
close has to break the line by x percent to qualify as a real breakout. In
either case, the result is a new channel line that is a little farther out,
effectively widening the channel.
 To modify the duration, you can specify that you’re willing to accept one
price bar violating the channel line, but not two. Or perhaps two days of
violation, but not three. Again, you have to experiment with each secu-
rity to see what its habits are. Also, you can combine the duration rule
with the close rule and specify that the close beyond the line for x
number of days is the sign of a true breakout.
711
Chapter 5: Transforming Channels into Forecasts
Book VIII
Technical
Analysis

Experienced technical analysts warn against making size and duration filters
too complex and fancy, for a number of reasons:
 Rules count: The breakout principle is a powerful and well-known concept.
A lot of other traders in your security are likely to heed a breakout in a
black-and-white way. They always exit on a downside breakout of a sup-
port line, for example. They feel that a breakout is a breakout, and
traders shouldn’t try to second-guess it.
 One size doesn’t fit all: You can only know that 10 percent is the right
amount to put into your filter if 10 percent was the amount that worked
in the past on this security. Each security has its own habits; or rather,
the people who trade it have their collective habits. In one security, the
best filter may consistently be 10 percent and in another, it may consis-
tently be 40 percent. (In the 1930s and 1940s, a filter of 3 percent was
standard.) No single correct filter exists for every security under all cir-
cumstances. You only know whether a filter is usable by testing different
filters on the price history of each security, one by one.
 Blending works only with coffee: The orderliness of your security can
change without warning. During some periods, a 5 percent filter may be
the most effective, but later, volatility can increase and you would need
a 10 percent filter to capture all the price highs and lows that really do
belong inside the same channel. Looking back over historical data to
find the best filter has an enormous flaw: Chances are that you’ll come
up with a blended percentage filter that’s too small for an orderly move
and too big for a volatile one. And if today is the breakout day, you don’t
know how volatile the upcoming move is going to be.
Putting breakouts into context
A genuine breakout means that your trend channel is now defunct. You need
to discard it. To verify that the breakout truly ended the trend, you need to
evaluate it in the context of the general volatility characteristics of the secu-
rity itself. By examining conditions at the time of the breakout, you may
gather clues as to what the price is likely to do next.
Neatness counts
As a general rule, a breakout that occurs in the course of an orderly (low
volatility) trend is more meaningful than a breakout that occurs in a disorderly
(high volatility) trend.
Figure 5-3 illustrates this point. In the first chart, the security is orderly —
prices line up neatly within the channel. The breakout is obvious. In the
second channel, the security isn’t so tidy — prices jump around a lot. The
breakout bar is exactly the same size as the first breakout bar, but in the
712
Book VIII: Technical Analysis 

disorderly price series, you can’t be sure it’s authentic. The people who trade
this security are accustomed to big bars and big jumps. You can see that it
broke the support line, but perhaps others won’t find it meaningful.
Orderliness isn’t a word you find in the technical analysis literature. Instead,
you find volatility, which refers to the extent of variation away from a central
reference point (like an average). You should consider that low volatility
constitutes orderliness and high volatility implies disorder.
The more orderly your price bars, the more reliable your channels are. A break-
out of an orderly channel is more likely to be the real thing than a breakout of a
high-volatility (disorderly) channel. If you choose to trade a disorderly security,
you must be able to tolerate a high number of false breakouts — and modify
your filters accordingly.
If your security generates a lot of false breakouts and you find that intolerable
because it makes you nervous, find another security. A number of vendors
offer software you can use to scan a collection of securities for those which
are low-volatility and therefore less likely to generate a lot of false breakouts.
Transitioning from orderly to disorderly (and back)
When a price series morphs from an orderly to a disorderly mode, the
transformation is almost always accompanied by a breakout and a change in
volume. Strangely, a shift the other way also foreshadows a breakout. When
prices shift from disorderly to orderly, the sharp decrease in volatility warns
you that a breakout is impending; buyers and sellers alike don’t know what to
do, so they do nothing. On the day of the breakout and in the day or two
following, you see a big increase in volume.

Driving faster is always risky
You also want to know the context of the breakout in terms of where the
prices were located within the channel just before the breakout. The usual
breakout is in the opposite direction of the prevailing trend.
But sometimes you see prices pressing against the top or bottom of the channel
line, and this can lead to a breakout in the same direction as the trend. In other
words, higher volatility can mean an acceleration of an existing trend. A
breakout can be to the upside in an uptrend as well as to the downside in a
downtrend.
Figure 5-4 illustrates an upside breakout in an uptrend. It’s still a breakout, and
you should expect that it still marks a change in the trend even though it is in
the same direction. The acceleration of an existing trend should make you sit
up and take notice. While it may simply signal a steepening of the trend as the
crowd develops enthusiasm for the security, it can also occur near the end of
a trend. It is sometimes called a blowout (or blowoff) top or a blowout bottom.
In other words, an upside breakout in an uptrend is often a warning of an
impending downside breakout, counterintuitive as that seems at first.
How can such a pattern come about? Easy. The crowd becomes overheated
with greed to buy a security that is rising with tremendous force, or over-
whelmed by fear to dump a security that is declining with great momentum.
At some point, everyone who was going to buy has bought. Because these
are traders who bought only to get a fast profit, when the rise slows down

Book VIII: Technical Analysis 

and a lower high or a lower low appears, these buyers exit in a horde. By selling
a lot of the security in a very short period of time, the market has an
oversupply, and buyers can command a low price.
The same thing happens when a downmove exhausts itself. Everybody who
was going to sell has sold. Supply is now limited. Anyone who wants to buy
has to start bidding the price up until he induces a longer-term holder of the
security to part with it.
Riding the Regression Range
You can construct a more “scientific” set of parallel lines by drawing channel
lines around the linear regression line. As described in Chapter 4, the linear
regression is the line that minimizes the distance from itself and every point
of the chart. It is the true, pure trendline, and thus the channel built on it,
named the standard error channel (also called the linear regression channel)
should be the true trend channel. You can calculate the standard error by
hand, but it’s laborious. Software is less error-prone and a lot faster.
You use a channel based on the linear regression line the same way that you
use a hand-drawn support and resistance channel. By projecting the lines out
into the future, you get a forecast of the future price range, and you deem a
significant breakout of a channel line as ending the trend.
With hand-drawn support and resistance channels, the channel is defined by
the outer limits (the series of higher highs with higher lows, or lower lows
with lower highs). No centerline exists. In the linear regression channel, you
build the channel from the inside out, so to speak. You start with a center
linear line and draw the outer lines from that.
Introducing the standard error
Computer software places the standard error channel on either side of the
linear regression line according to the statistical measure named the standard
error. Like the standard deviation discussed in Chapter 1, you don’t need to
know how to calculate this number or even precisely what it means in order
to use it effectively.
The standard error measures how closely the prices cluster around your linear
regression line. Most chartists use two standard errors, which results in a
channel top and channel bottom that enclose a high percentage (95 percent)
of the highs and lows. An extreme high or low constitutes a bigger error away
from the trendline than 95 percent of the other highs and lows.
715
Chapter 5: Transforming Channels into Forecasts
Book VIII
Technical
Analysis

If you don’t like to draw a channel that you already know is going to have
some prices breaking the lines, you can draw lines parallel to the standard
error channel lines but a bit wider, to encompass all the highs and lows.
The closer prices are to the linear regression line, the stronger the trend.
Here are a couple points to keep in mind:
 If you have an orderly trend, the prices don’t stray very far from one
another or from the linear regression, and therefore the channel is a
narrow one on either side of the linear regression. A price that doesn’t
vary at all from the linear regression is literally “on the trend” and has a
zero standard error.
 If you draw a channel and see that it’s very wide, your price series has a
lot of variation away from the linear regression. Prices far from the
norm, the linear regression, are called outliers and when you have a lot
of them, they are collectively called noise. The more noise, the less reliable
your channel.
Drawing a linear regression channel
How “true” the linear regression and its channel turn out to be depends on
where you start drawing. See Chapter 4 for a discussion of starting the linear
regression in a reasonable place.
You start a linear regression channel at an obvious low or high, draw a channel
line from there to a second relative low or high, and then extend it out. The
parallel line comes along for the ride, which often helps you adjust the slope of
the line by discovering relative highs or lows that you didn’t see at first. As
with the hand-drawn support and resistance channel lines, you know that you
have drawn your channel line correctly when a third relative high or low makes
a touch of the line but doesn’t cross it. Sometimes the “obvious” swing high or
low occurs within a previous channel that has been broken and discarded: Go
back to the swing bar and use it as the starting point for the new channel.
Figure 5-5 shows a nicely uptrending security with two channels. Look at the
shorter one first. I started it at the lowest low, and let the software do the
drawing to the bar after the next relative low. Then I stopped drawing and
extended the lines by hand, using dotted lines to mark them as hypothetical.
It isn’t until three months later that prices break out of the channel — to the
upside. Uh oh. A breakout always means something. When it’s a breakout in
the same direction as the trend, you start worrying that it may be a blowout
breakout, as I describe earlier in the chapter in the section “Driving faster is
always risky.” Whatever it turns out to be, you still need to discard the old
channel. It has been broken. In this case, I left it on the chart.
716
Book VIII: Technical Analysis 

Now I draw a new linear regression and its channel (the darker lines on the
chart) from the same lowest low starting point, and keep drawing until just after
a new relative high appears. I know it’s a relative high because it’s breaking the
top of the channel and followed by a lower high. I stop drawing at that relative
high and extend the channel lines out, as before. Notice that the price does it
again! It breaks out of the top of the channel a second time.
As a practical matter, every time a price breaks a channel line, you face a
higher risk. The channel defines what is normal and any foray outside the
channel is not normal. What does this breakout mean?
 These latest high prices can mark a third shift to a new, more steeply
sloping channel yet to be drawn.
 It may be a blowout breakout forming.
 The price series may subside back into the channel.
You have no way to know which of these three outcomes is the most likely
from the information on the chart. You may choose to exit on every channel
line breakout, or you can add another indicator to guide your decision.

Confirming hand-drawn channels
You can validate a hand-drawn support-and-resistance channel by superim-
posing a standard error channel on top of it. Starting at the same low (or
high) point that you used to draw by hand, you draw the standard error
channel and see how closely it tracks your hand-drawn lines. Sometimes the
standard error channel falls exactly on top of your hand-drawn lines, which is
“scientific” validation that you drew them right and they accurately represent
the trend. More often, the standard error channel has a slightly different slope.
The chart in Figure 5-6 shows a hand-drawn resistance line between the two
highs, as marked. Notice that it is only in hindsight that we see the first high
as a swing point. I extended the line after the second relative high and, at that
point, drew the support line parallel to it starting at the first low. At the same
time, I drew a standard error channel starting at the first high and stopping it
at the second high. Every line after the second high is an extension line. And
look at how well both the hand-drawn and the linear regression channel
forecast the future course of the security!
Trading a security that moves neatly within its channel, especially a validated
double channel (hand-drawn and standard error), reduces the stress of trading.

Seeing special features of the linear
regression channel
You use the linear regression channel the same way you use a hand-drawn
channel — to estimate the future range and to determine when a trend has
ended by observing a breakout of one of the channel lines. The linear regression
has a few special characteristics, though. For instance
 The linear regression doesn’t encompass every price extreme in a
series. It encompasses a very high percentage of them. Therefore, some
price bars will always break the channel lines without invalidating the
channel, unlike the situation in a hand-drawn channel.
 To make it more unlikely that you’ll mistake a normal breaking of the channel
line with a breakout, you can widen the channel lines to encompass the
first two or three highest highs and lowest lows, and then extend it out.
This modification is named a Raff regression channel after Gilbert Raff, the
man who devised it.
 You can adjust the width of the channel lines by instructing your software
to use three errors instead of the usual two. A three-error channel encloses
99 percent of the prices. This is handy for a just-emerging channel where
you don’t have many prices yet.
 The linear regression is self-adjusting. Every time you update the channel,
your software includes the new day’s data and modifies both the linear
regression line and the slope and width of the channel accordingly. It’s
therefore a bit of an odd duck — a set of straight lines that isn’t fixed, at
least until you fix it by halting the updating process.
 In order to see a breakout to confirm a trend change, you have to stop
drawing at some point. Otherwise, the channel simply adjusts to the new
data and gets wider and wider. Don’t forget; it automatically incorporates
all the price data you put into it. Garbage in, garbage out.
A useful technique to differentiate between the actual linear regression channel
and your extension of it is to make the extension a dotted line. This is an
important issue — it’s all too easy to cheat your eye and see regularity or
orderliness where it doesn’t exist.
You can draw new channels on top of your existing forecast channel. You begin
at the same starting point but continue the true channel to the current day. If
the width and the slope of the fresh true channel are about the same as your
forecast channel, you deem the forecast channel to be stable. A stable channel
implies that the forecast embedded in the farther-out lines is probably pretty
good. If you notice that the new true channel that incorporates the latest
prices is starting to widen or to change slope, examine the price bars them-
selves to see if they indicate a trend change.

Accepting drawbacks of linear 
regression channels
Linear regression channels are more difficult to work with than hand-drawn
support and resistance — you have to exercise more judgment, and it is more
of an art. Some of the complications are listed below:
 Not a majority process: A large number of people draw support and
resistance lines and channels, but not everyone draws linear regression
channels. A big part of why technical analysis works is that many people
are observing the same thing and acting on it, like breakouts. The same
can’t be said of linear regression channels.
 May not stand alone: You can draw a very large number of channels on
the same chart, and each of them is “right.” Often you draw one channel
from an obvious starting point but after fixing it and extending it out into
the future, you find that you can draw another channel from a nearby
starting point that points to a different outcome. I call this dueling
channels, and it always occurs at trend turning points.
 Not really “scientific”: The linear regression channel is scientific in the
sense that the software calculates it to enclose a preponderance of prices,
but that doesn’t mean that you started it or stopped it at the ideal spot, or
that the channel extension is correct. The mathematical principle isn’t
subjective, but your application is always subjective. Consider that your
car works on scientific principles of internal combustion and the like, but
that doesn’t necessarily make you a good driver.
Pivot Point Support and 
Resistance Channel
What do you do when you stop getting higher highs (in an uptrend) or lower
lows (in a downtrend)? In other words, the price is still within its channel but
moving sideways.
The pause in movement may be temporary, but the sideways action can also
be a warning that forward momentum is gone. From this you may deduce
that if you’re going to take profit, now is the time. The sideways action may
also imply that a breakout in the opposite direction is impending.
720
Book VIII: Technical Analysis 

One technique for dealing with sideways moves within a channel is to draw
horizontal support and resistance lines off pivot points. The term pivot point
is used in many different ways. One standard definition is that the pivot point
is the center bar of three where the center bar is the highest high or lowest
low. Another definition of pivot is the median price (the numerical average of
the high, low, and close). Other traders cook up yet more definitions. Today, the
median price version is probably the most accepted.
Calculating the first zone 
of support and resistance
The logic of the pivot point is that after a trend pauses, you need a breakout
that’s a significant distance from the median price to decide whether the old
trend will resume or a reversal is really at hand. So you start with the median
price and to that you add a factor to get upside resistance and you subtract a
factor to get downside support.
On the chart in Figure 5-7, the lightest horizontal line extends off the pivot
point calculated on the day of the highest high in the series. You’re worried
about this bar because it had a close lower than the open, despite the higher
high. It’s a weak higher high. The next day is an inside day, which may imply
a reversal. You’re starting to get suspicious that the uptrend is stalling.
To calculate the first (inner) line of resistance, multiply the pivot point value
by two and, from that number, subtract the low of the pivot day. To calculate
the first (inner) line of support, multiply the pivot value by two and, from that
number, subtract the high of the pivot day. This sounds like a lot of arithmetic
but it’s easy enough to do in a spreadsheet or by hand. It’s also a sensible
procedure — you’re using a multiple of the median price to estimate a range
going forward that subtracts the high and the low to yield a “norm.” Any price
higher or lower would be an “extreme.” If the upcoming price breaks the
horizontal support and resistance lines calculated this way, the direction 
of the breakout is your clue that the trend is truly over.
And that’s exactly what happens in Figure 5-7. The day after the inside day,
the price makes a new low below the first support line. It closes within the
zone and also closes a hair under the linear regression channel, but the low is
well below both the directional channel and the horizontal channel. This is a
double breakout — it’s a break of your linear regression channel and of the
first pivot channel as well. Note that analysts who work with pivot-based
support and resistance don’t call it a channel, a word I am using for consis-
tency and convenience. If it looks like a duck . . .
721
Chapter 5: Transforming Channels into Forecasts
Book VIII
Technical
Analysis

Calculating the second zone 
of support and resistance
The first inner zone is fairly narrow. In fact, it contains only about half of the
breakout bar. To get a wider horizontal support and resistance channel, you
can add the first zone to the pivot level to get a second resistance level and
subtract the first zone from the pivot level to get a second support level.
When you see R1, R2, R3 and S1, S2, S3 noted on a chart or in a table, these
abbreviations refer to the first resistance level, second resistance level, and
so on, calculated from a pivot point. The pivot point may or may not be the
median price. As I mention at the beginning of this section, many technical
analysts take the liberty of choosing their own pivot point definition.
Using pivot support and resistance
You can use pivot support and resistance all by itself, and many day-traders
do. In the case presented in Figure 5-7, upon seeing the inside day, you would
set your stop-loss order at the first pivot support level. Anticipating a

bounce, you can also place a buy order at the second support level with an
accompanying sell order at either of the two resistance levels.
If you’re using the standard error channel for directional guidance, the break-
out of the channel means you are at a loose end. You can’t construct a new
channel based on the linear regression because you simply don’t have
enough data. The pivot-based support and resistance channel suffices to
define the likely trading range until it is, in turn, broken.
You leave the pivot-based horizontal support and resistance zones in place
until you get a new swing bar that is substantially higher or lower than your
pivot support and resistance zones. Notice that on the chart in Figure 5-7,
you do get a matching high to the pivot bar. In fact, it’s a few pennies higher.
But it doesn’t set your hair on fire, and right afterwards, the price subsides
back into the support and resistance zone. What’s important about the pivot-
based support and resistance lines is that they effectively outline a period of
activity where traders don’t know the trend. Bulls try to make a new high and
get only a few pennies worth. Bears try to make a new low but fail to get a
close under S2.
Then the price convincingly breaks below the second support line. Almost
the whole bar is below the line. This is a breakout of the pivot channel and
usually a sign that you can now go back and start a new directional channel,
either hand-drawn support and resistance or a standard error channel. In
Figure 5-7, a new standard error channel is started, and notice that it is drawn
from the highest high, not from the breakout point. At this time, you can dis-
card the pivot channel — or you can leave the support line on the chart.
Remember, old support often becomes new resistance.
