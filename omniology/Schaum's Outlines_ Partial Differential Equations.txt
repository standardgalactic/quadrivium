Preface 
The importance of partial differential equations among the topics of applied 
mathematics bas been recognized for many years. However, the increasing 
complexity of today's technology is demanding of the mathematician, the engineer, 
and the scientist an understanding of the subject previously attained only by 
specialists. This book is intended to serve as a supplemental or primary text for a 
course aimed at providing this understanding. It has been organized so as to 
provide a helpful reference for the practicing professional, as well. 
After the introductory Chapter 1, the book is divided into three parts. Part I, 
consisting of Chapters 2 through 5, is devoted primarily to qualitative aspects of the 
subject. Chapter 2 discusses the classification of problems, while Chapters 3 and 4 
characterize the behavior of solutions to elliptic boundary value problems and 
evolution equations, respectively. Chapter 5 focuses on hyperbolic systems of 
equations of order one. 
Part II comprises Chapters 6 through 8, which present the principal tech-
niques for constructing exact solutions to linear problems in partial differential 
equations. Chapter 6 contains the essential ideas of eigenfunction expansions and 
integral transforms, which are then applied to partial differential equations in 
Chapter 7. Chapter 8 provides a practical treatment of the important topic of 
Green's functions and fundamental solutions. 
Part III, Chapters 9 through 14, deals with the construction of approximate 
solutions. Chapters 9, 10, and 11 focus on finite-difference methods and, for 
hyperbolic problems, the numerical method of characteristics. Some of these 
methods are implemented in FORTRAN 77 programs. Chapters 12, 13, and 14 are 
devoted to approximation methods based on variational principles, Chapter 14 
constituting a very elementary introduction to the finite element method. 
In every chapter, the solved and supplementary problems have the vital 
function of applying, reinforcing, and sometimes expanding the theoretical con-
cepts. 
It is the authors' good fortune to have long been associated with a large, a£tive 
group of users of partial differential equations, and the development of this Outline 
has been considerably influenced by this association. Our aim has been to create a 
book that would provide answers to all the questions--or, at least, those most 
frequently asked-of our students and colleagues. As a result, the level of the 
material included varies from rather elementary and practical to fairly advanced 
and theoretical. The novel feature is that it is all collected in a single source, from 
which, we believe, the student and the technician alike can benefit. 
We would like to express our gratitude to the McGraw-Hill staff and the 
Colorado State University Department of Mathematics for their cooperation and 
support during the preparation of this book. In particular, we thank David 
Beckwith of McGraw-Hili for his many helpful suggestions.

Introduction 
1.1 NOTATION AND TERMINOLOGY 
Let u denote a function of several independent variables; say, u = u(x, y, z, t). At (x, y, z, t), the 
partial derivative of u with respect to x is defined by 
au = lim u(x + h, y, z, t) - u(x, y, z, t) 
ax 
h ... O 
h 
provided the limit exists. We will use the following subscript notation: 
au 
-==u 
ax 
x 
au 
-==u 
ay 
Y 
aZu 
--==u 
axay 
xy 
If all partial derivatives of u ~p through order m are continuous in some region 0, we say u is in the 
class em 
(0), or u is em in O. 
A partial differential equation (abbreviated PDE) is an equation involving one or more partial 
derivatives of an unknown fu nction of several variables. The order of a PDE is the order of the 
highest-order derivative that appears in the equation. 
The partial differential equation F(x, y, z, t; U, ux ' uy , uz ' u" uxx ' uxy ' ••• ) = 0 is said to be linear if 
the function F is algebraically linear in each of the variables U, ux ' uy, ... , and if the coefficients of u 
and its derivatives are functions only of the independent variables. An equation that is not linear is 
said to be nonlinear; a nonlinear equation is quasilinear if it is linear in the highest-order derivatives. 
Some of the qualitative theory of linear PDEs carries over to quasi linear equations. 
The spatial variables in a PDE are usually restricted to some open region 0 with boundary S; the 
union of nand S is called the closure of 0 and is denoted O. If present, the time variable is 
considered to run over some interval, tl < t < tz. A function u = u(x, y, z, t) is a solution for a given 
m th-order PDE if, for (x, y, z) in 0 and tl < t < tz, u is em and satisfies the PDE . 
In problems of mathematical physics, the region 0 is often some subset of Euclidean n -space, Rn. 
In this case a typical point in 0 is denoted by x = (XI ,xz, ... , xn ) , and the integral of u over 0 is 
denoted by 
I· .. I U(Xp Xz, ... , xJ dX I dxz ... dXn = J UdO

The PDEs that model physical systems usually have infinitely many solutions. To select the single 
function that represents the solution to a physical problem, one must impose certain auxiliary 
conditions that further characterize tbe system being modeled. These fall into two categories. 
Boundary conditions. These are conditions that must be satisfied at points on the boundary S of the 
spatial region 0 in which the PDE holds. Special names have been given to three forms of boundary 
conditions:

consideration of the physical system begins. A typical initial condition prescribes some combination of u

and any inhomogeneous term in the PDE, are said to comprise the data in the problem modeled by

The prescribed initial- and boundary-condition functions, together with the coefficient functions 
and any inhomogeneous term in the POE, are said to comprise the data in the problem modeled by 
the PDE. The solution is said to depend continuously on the data if small cbanges in the data produce

correspondingly small changes in the solution. TIle problem itself is said to be well-posed if (i) a 
solution to the problem exists, (ii) the solution is unique, (iii) the solution depends continuously on 
the data. If any of these conditions is not satisfied, then the problem is said to be ill-posed. 
The auxiliary conditions that, together with a PDE, comprise a well-posed problem must not be 
too many, or the problem will have no solution. They must not be too few, or the solution will not be 
unique. Finally, they must be of the correct type, or the solution will not depend continuously on the 
data. The well-posedness of some common boundary value problems (no initial conditions) and 
initial- boundary value problems is discussed in Chapters 3 and 4.

if un is formally replaced by 0'2, uxy by af3, Uyy by f32, Ux by a, and uy by f3, then associated with (2.1) 
is a polynomial of degree two in a and f3: 
pea, (3) == aa 2 + 2baf3 + cf32 + dO' + ef3 + f 
The mathematical properties of the solutions of (2.1 ) are largely determined by the algebraic properties 
of the polynomial p ea , (3). pea, (3)-and along with it, the POE (2.1 )-is classified as hyperbolic, 
parabolic, or elliptic according as its discriminant, b

- ac, is positive, z ero, or negative. Note that the 
type of (2.1 ) is determined solely by its principal part (the terms involving the highest-order 
derivatives of u) and that the type will generally change with position in the xy-plane unless a, b, and 
C are constants. 
EXAMPLE 2.1 
(a) The PDE 3uxx + 2u7y + 5uyy + xUy = 0 is elliptic, since 
b2 _ ac = 12-3(5)= -14 < 0 
(b) The Tricorni equation for transonic flow, Uxx + YUyy = 0, has 
b 2 - ac = 02 - (l)y = -y 
Thus, the equation is elliptic for y > 0, parabolic for y = 0, and hyperbolic for y < o. 
The general linear POE of order two in n variables has the form 
L ai/·u x .x · + L biu x . + CU = d

~j = l 
i = 1 
(2.2) 
If u xx = U x x' then the principal part of (2.2) can always be arranged so that a ij = aji ; thus, the n x n 
matri~ A =J[~ij ] can be assumed symmetric. In linear algebra it is shown that every real, symmetric 
n x n matrix has n real eigenvalues. These eigenvalues are the (possibly repeated) zeros of an 
nth-degree polynomial in A, det (A - AI), where l is the n x n identity matrix. Let P denote the 
number of positive eigenvalues, and Z the number of zero eigenvalues- (i.e., the multiplicity of the 
eigenvalue zero), of the matrix A. Then (2.2 ) is: 
hyperbolic 
parabolic 
elliptic 
ultrah yperbolic 
if 
if 
if 
if 
Z = 0 and P = 1 or Z = 0 and P == n - 1 
Z > 0 (equivalently, if det A == 0) 
Z == 0 and P == n or Z = 0 and P = 0 
Z == 0 and 1 < P < n - 1 
If any of the aii is nonconstant, the type of (2.2) can vary with position.

type of (2.1) is determined solely by its principal part (the terms involving the highest-order 
derivatives of u ) and that the type will generally change with position in the xy-plane unless a, b, and 
c are constants. 
EXAMPLE 2.1 
(a) The POE 3uxx + 2u7y + 5uyy + xUy = 0 is elliptic, since 
b2 _ ac = 12_ 3(5)= -14<0 
(b) The Tricomi equation for transonic flow, Uxx + yuyy = 0, has 
b2 _ ac = ~- (l)y =-y 
Thus, the equation is elliptic for y > 0, parabolic for y = 0, and hyperbolic for y < o. 
The general lin ar PDE of order two in n variables has the form 
(L.2) 
If u xx = U x .x .' then the principal part of (2.2) can always be arranged so that a ij = aji ; thus, the n x n 
ma tri~ A =J[~ ij] can be assumed symmetric. In linear algebra it is shown that every real, symmetric 
n x n matrix has n real eigenvalues. These eigenvalues are the (possibly repeated) zeros of an 
nth-degree polynomial in A, det (A - AI), where I is the n x n identity matrix. Let P denote the 
number of positive eigenvalues, and Z the number of zero eigenvalues "'(i.e., the multiplicity of the 
eigenvalue zero), of the matrix A. Then (2.2) is:

Z = 0 and 1 < P < n - 1 
If any of the aij is nOnconstant, the type of (2.2) can vary with position.

2.2 CHARACTERISTICS 
The following, seemingly unrelated, questions both naturally lead to a consideration of special 
curves associated with (2.1), called characteristic curves or, simply, characteristics. (1) How can a 
coordinate transformation be used to simplify the principal part of (2.1)? (2) Along what curves is a 
knowledge of U, ux' and uy' together with (2.1 ), insufficient uniquely to determine uxx' uxy' and Uyy ? 
To address the first question, suppose a locally invertible change of independent variables, 
t= 4>(x,y) 
TJ = I/I(x,y) 
(4)xl/ly -
4>yl/lx ~ 0), is used to transform the principal part of (2.1) from 
to 
Auu + 2Bu", + Cu."." + lower-order terms 
which implies that the principal part of the transformed equation is 
Auu + 2Bu", + Cu."." 
As found in Problem 2.3, 
A = a4>: + 2bc/>x4>y + c4> ~ 
Since the transformed and original discriminants are related by 
B 2 - AC = (b
2 
- ac)(4)xl/ly -
4>yl/lS 
(2.3) 
the type of (2.1) is invariant under an invertible change of independent variables. The principal part 
of the transformed equation will take a particularly simple form if A = C = 0, which will be the case 
if 4> and 1/1 are both solutions of 
. 
(2.4) 
(2.4) is called the characteristic equation of (2.1); the level curves, z(x, y) = const., of a solution of 
(2.4) are called characteristic curves of (2.1). 
,Turning to question (2), suppose that u, Ux' and uy are known along some curve r. Then, as 
shown in Problem 2.10, uxx' uxy' and Uyy are uniquely determined along runless 
a dy2 - 2b dx . dy + C dx
2 = ° 
(2.5) 
holds along (i.e., is the ordinary differential equation for) r. 
Theorem 2.1: 
z (x, y) = const. is a characteristic of (2.1) if and only if z (x, y) = const. is a solution of 
(2.5). 
For the proof, see Problem 2.4. 
Related to the indeterminacy of the second derivatives along a characteristic is the fact that 
ph ysically significant discontinuities in the solution of (2.1) can propaga e only along characteristics. 
The number of real solutions of (2.4 ) or (2.5) is dictated by the sign of the discriminant, 
b2(x, y ) - a(x, y)c(x, y) 
Thus, when (2.1) is hyperbolic, parabolic, or elliptic, there are, respectively, two, one, or zero 
characteristics passing through (x, y). In the hyperbolic case, the two families of characteristics define 
natural coordinates (t, TJ) in which to study (2.1). The absence of characteristics for <> ~eq.u <!.tiQn.s 
implies that there are no curves along which discontinuities in a solution can propagate; solutions of 
elliptic equations are generally smooth. 
EXAMPLE 2.3 
(a) 
By Theorem 2.1, the characteristics of the (hyperbolic) one-dimensional wave equation, a2 uxx -
Uti = 0, are 
defined by a 2 df - dx 2 = O. Thus, the characteristics are the lines 
x + at == ~ = const. 
x - at == TJ = const.

(b) The characteristics of the (parabolic) one-dimensional heat equatiorl, 
KUx.x -
U, = 0 
are defined by I( dt2 = O. Thus, the characteristics are the lines t == TJ = const. 
(c) 
Characteristics of the (elliptic) two-dimensional Laplace's equation, 
u= + Uy y = 0 
must satisfy dy2 + dx2 = 0, which has no nonzero real solution. Thus, Laplace's equation has no real 
characteristics. 
For the n-dimensional PDE (2.2), the characteristic surfaces are the level surfaces, 
of the solutions of the characteristic equation 
For n > 2, this characteristic equation cannot generally be reduced to an ordinary differential 
equation as in Theorem 2.1; so, the characteristics are often difficult to determine. As in the case 
n = 2, the characteristics of (2.2) are the surfaces along which discontinuities in derivatives of the 
solution propagate. 
EXAMPLE 2.4 The characteristics of the hyperbolic equation 
U XP1 -
U x2X2 -
U XJX3 = 0 
(1) 
(a two-dimensional wave equation with XI taking the role of time) are the level surfaces of the solutions of 
(2) 
, 
By direct substitution it may be verified that 
z = F(x, + x2sin a + X3COS a) 
(3) 
with F an arbitrary C' function and a an arbitrary parameter, solves (2). This solution is constant when 
XI + X2 sin a + X3 cos a = const. 
which may be rewritten as 
(4) 
where (x" X2, X3) is an arbitrary point in XIX2X3-space. Equation (4) represents a one-parameter family of planes, 
each plane containing the point (XI, X2, X3) and making a 45° angle with the positive xraxis. As is geometrically 
obvious, the family has as its envelope the right circular cone 
--
(XI - XI)2 - (X2 - x2f -
(X3 - X3)2 = 0 
(5) 
On the cones (5), all solutions (3) are constant; hence, these cones are the characteristic surfaces of (1). 
2.3 CANONICAL FORMS 
We have already seen, in Section 2.2, how a hyperbolic second-order PDE may be simplified by 
choosing the characteristics as the new coordinate curves. In general, if a, b, and c in (2.1) are 
sufficiently smooth functions of x and y, there will always exist a locally one-one coordinate 
transformation, g = cp(x, y), 'T/ = "'(x, y), which transforms the principal part to the canonical form

The canonical forms u{f -
u'I1'11' u{{' and Uu + u'I11' are the principal parts of the wave, heat, and Laplace 
equations, which serve as prototypes of hyperbolic, parabolic, and elliptic equations, respectively. 
Methods for choosing <p and 1/1 to reduce (2.1) to canonical form are illustrated in Problems 2.6- 2.9. 
If (2.1), or more generally (2.2 ), has constant coefficients in its principal part, reduction to a 
canonical form can be accomplished using a linear change of independent variables. Specifically, 
there will exist an invertible linear coordinate transformation, 
h 
(r = 1, 2, ... , n )

that takes (2.2 ) into an equation with principal part

where Ai (i = 1,2, . .. , n) are the eigenvalues of the symmetric matrix A. (If A is an eigenvalue of 
multiplicity q > 1, then q of the ~-var i ables will correspond to A.) A rescaling of the independent 
variables, 
then yields one of the canonical forms

If (2.2) has all coefficients constant and has been reduced to one of the above canonical forms, a 
fu rther simplification is always possible in the elliptic or hyperbolic case (see Problem 2.14) and is 
sometimes possible in the parabolic case (see Problem 2.15). 
2.4 DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS 
The reduction of a POE to canonical form does not change the order of the equation or the 
number of independent variables. However, by seeking a solution of a particular form it is often 
possible to reduce the number of independent variables in a problem. 
EXAMPLE 2.5 (a) If we look for oscillatory solutions to the wave equation, 
u.u +Uyy- u,, = o 
of the form u(x, y, t) = vex, y)e ikt 
(i = v=I), then v satisfies the Helmholtz equation, 
(b) Traveling-wave solutions to U,u - u" + U = 0, in the form u(x, t) = vex - at) (a = const.), satisfy the ordinary 
differential equation (1 - a 2)v" + v = O. (c) Radially symmetric solutions of Laplace's equation, Ux. + Uyy = 0, of 
the form

where 
satisfy v" + r-1v' = O.

Suppose that a physical problem is modeled by a PD E that involves dependent variable u; 
independent variables xI' x2' . . . , xn; and parameters PI' P2' . .. ,Pm. The general expression for the 
solution of the PDE is 
F (u, XI' x2' ... , xn' PI> P2' . . . , Pm) = 0 
(2.6) 
which can usually be "solved" to give u = f(x 1, • • • , xn' PI' .. . , Pm). Consider a fundamental system 
of physical dimensions, each with its corresponding base unit ; specifically, consider the International 
System (SI), as indicated in Table 2-1.

Each quantity in (2.6) is either dimensionless (i.e., a pure number) or has as its physical dimension a 
product of powers of the fundamental dimensions of Table 2-1. 
EXAMPLE 2.6 Let F (u, x, I, pc, k) = 0 be the general solution of the one-dimensional heat equation 
pcu, - kuxx = 0 
(1 ) 
The dependent variable is the temperature u, while the independent variables and physical parameters are 
Xl == X, X2 == I, PI == pc (density times specific heat capacity), and P2 == k (thermal conductivity). The physical 
dimensions of these quantities are: 
{u} = e 
{X,} = L 
{pd = ML- I T- 20- 1 
{P2} = MLr3e - 1 
There are in all N = 5 dimensional quantities, which are specified in terms of R = 4 fundamental dimensions (the 
three mechanical dimensions L, T, M and the thermal dimension 0). It happens that only integral powers of the 
fundamental dimensions enter. 
If we define K == k/ pc (thermal diffusivity) and rewrite (1) as 
u, -
KUxx = 0 
(2) 
there are present in (2 ) one fewer physical parameter and one fewer fundamental dimension ({K} = L 2r
l); 
hence, N - R is unchanged. This invariance reflects the mass independence of the thermal process, and should 
not be expected in general. 
When, as in Example 2.6, a PDE involves fewer fundamental dimensions than dimensional 
quantities, it must admit a simplified, sim ilarity solution, in accordance with 
Theorem 2.2 (Buckingham Pi Theorem) : 
If (i) the function Fin (2.6 ) is continuously differentiable 
with respect to each argument; (ii) given N - 1 of the N = 1 + n + m quantities u, Xj' Pi' the 
equation (2.6 ) can be uniquely solved for the remaining quantity; and (iii) U, Xi' Pi 
collectively involve R fundamental units (0 < R < N); then (2.6) is equivalent to

To complete the proof, let z (x, y) = const. be a general integral of (2.5). To show that z(x, y)

Chapter 3 
Qualitative Behavior of 
Solutions to Elliptic Equations 
3.1 HARMONIC FUNCTIONS 
Because the canonical example of an elliptic POE is Laplace's equation, ,\PU = 0, we begin with 
the following 
Definition: 
A function u = u(x) is harmonic in an open region, fl, if u is twice continuously 
differentiable in fl and satisfies Laplace's equation in fl. u is harmonic in .0, the closure of 
fl, if u is harmonic in fl and continuous in fl. 
EXAMPLE 3.1 
(a) 
u(x, y) = x 2 - y2 is harmonic in any region n of the xy-pJane. 
(b) 
u(x, y, z) = (x2+ y2+ z2r l!2 is harmonic in any three-dimensional region which does not contain the origin. 
If n denotes the ball of radius one centered at (1,0, 0), then u is harmonic in n but not in n. 
Let "0 be a point in n and let BR ("0) denote the open ball having center Xo and radius R. Let 
l R(XO) denote the boundary of BR(xO) and let A(R) be the area of lR(XO) ' 
EXAMPLE 3.2 Using calculus methods, one can show that in R
n the volume, Vn(R ), and the surface area, 
A n (R ), of any ball of radius R are given by

1·3· 5··· n 
Definition: 
A function u has the mean-value property at a point Xo in fl if 
u(xo) = A;R) {R 
u(x) dIR 
for every R > 0 such that BR (Xo) is contained in fl. 
(1) 
(3.1 ) 
Theorem 3.1: 
u is harmonic in an open region fl if and only if u has the mean-value property at 
each Xo in fl. 
By Theorem 3.1, the state function, u(x), for a physical system modeled by Laplace's equation is 
balanced throughout fl in the sense that the value of u at any point Xo is equal to the average of u 
taken over the surface of any ball in fl centered at xO. In other words, Laplace's equation-
and 
elliptic PDEs in general-are descriptive of physical systems in the equilibrium or steady state. 
Theorem 3.2: Let n be a bounded region with boundary S and let u be harmonic in O. If M and m 
are, respectively, the maximum and minimum values of u(x) for x on S, then (Weak 
Maximum-Minimum Principle) 
m :5 u(x) :5 M 
for all x in n 
or, more precisely (Strong Maximum -Minimum Principle), 
either 
m < u(x) < M 
for all x in n 
or else 
m = u(x) = M 
for all x in n 
19

SOLUTIONS TO ELLIPTIC EQUATIONS 
[CHAP. 3 
EXAMPLE 3.3 If n is not bounded, then the (weak) maximum-minimum principle need not hold. In fact, 
u(x, y ) = eX sin y 
satisfies Laplace's equation in n == {(x, y ): -00 < x < 00, 0 < Y < 7T}, and u is zero on the boundary of n, so that 
m = M = O. But u (x, y) is not identically zero in n. 
Definition: 
A function u(x) is analytic in n if u is in CO(n) and, in a neighborhood of each point x 
in n, u equals its Taylor series expansion about x. 
Theorem 3.3: If u is harmonic in a region n, then u is analytic in n. 
Theorem 3.3 implies that solutions of Laplace's equation cannot exhibit discontinuities in the value 
of u or of any of its derivatives. This is again characteristic of a physical system in the steady state (any 
initial disturbances having been smoothed out). 
There is a strong connection between harmonic functions in the plane and analytic functions of a 
complex variable. This connection provides a partial converse to Theorem 3.3. 
Theorem 3.4: If f(z) == f(x + iy) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y) is an analytic function of the complex variable z 
in n, then u and v are harmonic in n. 
Theorem 3.5: 
A function u(x, y) is harmonic in a simply connected region n if and only if, in n, u 
is the real part of some analytic function f(z). 
EXAMPLE 3.4 If f(z) = Z2 = (x + iy f = x 2 - y2 + i 2xy, then 
u(x, y) = Ref(z) = x2_ y2 
and 
vex, y) = Re -if(z) = 2xy 
each satisfy Laplace's equation in the plane. 
3.2 EXTENDED MAXIMUM-MINIMUM PRINCIPLES 
Definition: 
A continuous function u is subharmonic in a region n if, for every Xo in n, u(xo) is less 
than or equal to the average of the u-values on the boundary of any ball, BR(Xo), in n: 
u(xo):5-
1-J u(x)dIR 
A (R) lR 
(3.2) 
A superharmonic function satisfies (3.2) with the inequality reversed; it is thus the negative of a 
subharmonic function. 
If u is C 2, then u is subharmonic if and only if V2u ~ 0, and u is superharmonic if and only if 
V2u :50. Clearly, a harmonic function is both subharmonic and superhartl'ionic, and conversely. The 
maximum-minimum principle, Theorem 3.2, extends to subharmonic and superharmonic functions, as 
follows: 
Theorem 3.6: For n, S, m, and M as in Theorem 3.2, 
(i) if V
2u ~ ° in n, then u(x) < M for all x in n or else u(x) == M in ii; 
(ii) if V2u :5 0 in n, then u(x) > m for all x in n or else u(x) == m in ii. 
Results similar to Theorem 3.6 hold for elliptic equations more general than Laplace's equation. 
Definition: The linear operator 
(3.3) 
is uniformly elliptic in n if there exists a positive constant A such that

for all «(1' (2' ... , (J in R
n and all x in 0. 
Observe that, if (3.4) holds, matrix A(x) must be positive definite in 0, which means that L[ ] is 
elliptic in 0 , with Z = 0 and P = n (Section 2.1). On the other hand, assuming that an elliptic 
operator has all eigenvalues positive (if all are negative, multiply the operator by -1), we have 
Theorem 3.7: If L[ ] is elliptic in n, it is uniformly elliptic in n (a1ortiori, in 0). 
Theorem 3.8: 
Let 0, S, m, and M be as in Theorem 3.2. Suppose in (3.3) that c = 0, L[ 
is 
uniformly elliptic in 0 , and aij and bi are continuous in n.

continuous in O. Suppose further that, in 0, c :s 0 and f is continuous.

(ii) If f ~ 0 in nand u(x) is nonconstant, then any positive maximum of u(x)

3.3 ELLIPTIC BOUNDARY VALUE PROBLEMS 
Since elliptic equations in general model physical systems that are not changing with time, the 
associated auxiliary conditions are typically boundary conditions (Section 1.1). 
EXAMPLE 3.5 If n is the region 0 < x < 1, 0 < Y < 1, then the boundary value problem 
Ux.< + Uyy = f(x, y) 
u(x, 0) = u(x, 1) = 0 
ux(O, y) = 1 
2yu(1, y) - 5ux (1, y) = y2 
in n 
on O< x < 1 
onO<y<.1 
onO <y<l 
has a homogeneous Dirichlet condition on the portion of the boundary where y = 0 or y = 1. A Neumann 
condition holds on the part of the boundary where x = O. On the edge x = 1, u satisfies a mixed condition. 
A classical solution of a (elliptic) boundary value problem satisfies the PDE L [u] = fin 0 , is C 2 
in 0, and is CO in n (for a Dirichlet condition on S) or C 1 in n (for a Neumann or mixed condition 
on ...... S). It is possible to relax somewhat the smoothness conditions; such weak solutions are discussed 
briefly in Chapter 5. When no qualifier is used, a solution is understood to be a classical solution.

If the region n is unbounded, then, in addition to the boundary conditions, a solution is generally 
required to satisfy a condition at infinity, which is frequently dimension dependent. 
EXAMPLE 3.6 
(a) If fl is the half-plane y > 0, then, in the boundary value problem 
Uxx + Uyy = f(x, y) 
in n 
u(x, 0) = g(x) 
on S 
the usual condition at infinity is that u be bounded, 
Iu(x, y)1 < M = const. 
(b) If n is the half-space z > 0, then, in the boundary value problem 
Un + Uyy + Uzz = f(x, y, z) 
in n 
u(x, y, 0) = g(x, y) 
on S 
the typical condition is that U vanish at infinity, 
Iu(x, y, z)I~O 
The three conditions for a well-posed problem were stated in Section 1.3. For many elliptic 
boundary value problems, maximum-minimum principles like Theorems 3.8-3.10 or an energy-
integral argument can be used to show that conditions (ii) (uniqueness) and (iii) (continuous 
dependence on data) hold. See Problem 3.14.

each have at most one solution and each solution depends continuously on the data functions f and g. Nonetheless, 
there are mathematically and physically significant elliptic boundary value problems that are iii-posed with 
regard to conditions (ii) and (iii). 
Condition (i), the existence of a solution to a boundary value problem, is generaUy more difficult 
to establish. The most satisfactory way to show that a solution exists is to construct it; the solutions to 
a number of elliptic boundary value problems are constructed in Chapters 7 and 8. A particularly 
important constructive existence result, for Laplace's equation, is given by

The converse theorem, that the mean-value property implies harmonicity, can be proved by 
reversing the above argument if the prior assumption is made that u is in C\fl). A way around such an 
assumption is shown in Problems 3.2-3.4.

Suppose that u has the mean-value property in a bounded region n and that u is continuous 
in fl. Show that if u is nonconstant in n, then u attains its maximum and minimum values on 
the boundary of n, not in the interior of n. 
Since u is continuous in the closed, bounded region 0, u attains its maximum, M, and its minimum, 
m, somewhere in O. We will show that if u attains its maximum at an interior point of fl, then u is 
constant in O. 
Assume that u(xo) = M, with Xo in fl, and let x* be any other point in fl. Let r be a polygonal path 
in fl joining xo and x* and let d be the minimum distance separating rand S, the boundary of 0: 
d = min {Ix - yl: x on r, y on S }

Problem 3.2 shows that u is identically equal to M in each BR(Xi), i = 0, 1, . . . , n ; hence, u(x * ) = M. 
Since x* was arbitrary, u must be equal to M throughout n and, by continuity of u, throughout 0 . This 
shows that if u is not a constant in n, then u can attain its maximum value only on the boundary of n. 
The above argument, applied to - U, establishes that if u is nonconstant, it can attain its minimum 
value only on S.

Show that if u has the mean-value property in an open region n, then u is harmonic in n . 
Let Xo be any point in 0 , and let B R (xo) be wholly contained in n. Since Laplace's equation is 
invariant under a translation of coordinates, we shall suppose Xo = O. If v is defined in BR (O) by Poisson's 
integral formula, (3.5), with v = u on the boundary of BR, then, by Theorem 3.11, v i. harmonic in tiR. 
By Problem 3.1, v has the mean-value property in BR • Because both u and v have the mean-value 
property in BR , W == U - v has the mean-value property in BR . Since w = 0 on the boundary of B R , 
Problem 3.3 shows that w = 0 throughout DR. Thus, u is identically equal to the harmonic function v in 
DR, and so u is harmonic at 0, which, from the above, represents any point in n. 
The above proof has an important implication: Any harmonic function can be expressed in terms of 
its boundary values on a sphere by Poisson's formula. Equivalently: The Dirichlet problem 
has a unique solution.

Problems 3.9 and 3.10 provide a proof of Theorem 3.8(i) for R2 in the case that the principal part of 
L[ ] is the Laplacian. The arguments employed contain the essential ingredients of the general proof of 
Theorem 3.8.

For a bounded region n, show that if U is a nonconstant solution of 
uxx + Uyy + blux + bzuy + cu = f 
(1 ) 
with b l , bz, C $; 0, and f:2: 0 all continuous on n, then U can assume a positive maximum only 
on S, the boundary of n, and Dot in n. 
Suppose that M is a positive maximum of u and let 0 be the set of points in n where u = M Since 
a solution of (1) is continuous in 0, we know from calculus that 0 is closed (its complement is open) 
relative to O. 
To complete the argument, we show that if 0 is nonempty, then 0 is also open relative to n, 
implying that 0 = 0 and contradicting the hypothesis that u is nonconstant. Let (X, 9) be a point in 0, so 
that u(x, y) = M'> O. Then, by continuity of u, there is a ball, B, in 0 , centered at (x, y), in which 
u(x, y) > O. Thus, 
U xx + Uyy + b1ux + b2 uy = -cu + /2: 0 
in B 
Now, from Problem 3.10, we conclude that u must be identically equal to M in B. This shows that any 
point in 0 has a ball about it that is entirely in 0 ; i.e., 0 is open relative to O. 
The above provides a proof of Theorem 3.9(ii) for R2 when the principal part of the elliptic operator 
is the Laplacian. A general proof of Theorem 3.9 follows the same lines.

The following example is due to Hadamard. For F = Fl == 0 and G = G 1 == 0, it is clear that Uj == 0 is

INITIAL VALUE AND INITIAL-BOUNDARY VALUE PROBLEMS 
Unlike elliptic PDEs, which describe a steady state, parabolic or hyperbolic evolution equations 
describe processes that are developing in time. For such an equation, the initial state of the system is part 
of the auxiliary data for a well-posed problem. If the equation contains time derivatives up to order k, the 
initial state can be characterized by specifying the initial values of the unknown function and its time 
derivatives through order k - 1. 
EXAMPLE 4.1

which are well-posed for the heat equation will be well-posed for more general parabolic equations.

If the initial conditions in a well-posed initial value or initial-boundary value problem for an 
evolution equation are replaced by conditions on the solution at other than the initial time, the 
resulting problem may not be well-posed, even when the total number of auxiliary conditions is 
unchanged.

u(O, I) = u(l, /) = 0

O<x < l 
0<1 < T 
Here the initial condition of the forward problem has been replaced by a terminal condition specifying the 
state at a final time 1 = T. The problem is to find previous states u(x, I) 
(I < T) which will have evolved at 
time T into the state f(x). For arbitrary f(x), this problem has no solution. Even when the solution exists, it 
does not depend continuously on the data (see Problem 4.9).

O<x < l 
O<x<l 
0 < 1< T 
Here the initial condition on u, has been replaced by a terminal condition on u. The solution to this 
problem does not depend continuously on the data (see Problem 4.20). 
4.2 MAXIMUM-MINIMUM PRINCIPLES (PARABOLIC PDEs) 
Neither the wave equation nor hyperbolic equations in general satisfy a maximum-mInimum 
principle, but the heat equation and parabolic equations of more general form do so. 
Let n denote a bounded region in R3 whose boundary is a smooth closed surface S. Suppose 
u(x, y, z, t) to be continuous for (x, y, z) in nand O:s t:s T; for short, in n X [0, T]. Let 
Ms == max {u(x, y, z, t): (x, y, z) on Sand O:s t:s T} 
Mo == max {u(x, y, z, t): (x, y, z) in nand t = O} 
M == max {Ms, Mo} 
and let ms' mo' and m denote the corresponding minimum values for u. 
Theorem 4.1 (Maximum-Minimum Principle for the Heat Equation): 
Given that u(x, y, z, t) IS 
continuous in n x [0, T ]: 
(i) 
If u, - 'i/2u :s 0 in n X (0, T), then u :s M in n X [0, T]. 
(ii) If u, - 'i/
2u ?: 0 in n X (0, T), then u?: m in n X [0, T ]. 
(iii) If u, - 'i/2u = 0 in n X (0, T), then m :s u :s M in n x [0, T]. 
According to Theorem 4.1(iii), the temperatures inside a heat conductor are bounded by the extreme 
temperatures attained either inside initially or on the boundary subsequently. Theorem 4.1 is useful 
in establishing uniqueness and continuous dependence on the data and to obtain various comparison 
results for the solutions to initial-boundary value problems for the heat equation. 
The maximum-minimum principle may be extended in various ways; the next theorem states that 
if an extreme value of a nonconstant solution of the heat equation occurs on the boundary S, then the 
normal derivative of the solution (the heat flux) cannot vanish at that point.

4.3 DIFFUSIONLIKE EVOLUTION (PARABOLIC PDEs) 
Two properties characterize the time-behavior of systems modeled by parabolic PDEs. To 
describe the second of these, we introduce the notion of an "evolution operator" that takes the initial 
state u(x, 0) of the system into the evolved state u(x, t). 
Infinite speed of propagation. At any time t > ° 
(no matter how small), the solution to a parabolic 
initial value problem at an arbitrary location x depends on all of the initial data. (See Problem 4.7.) 
As a consequence, the problem is well-posed only if behavior-at-infinity conditions are imposed. 
Smoothing action of the evolution operator. A solution u(x, t) to the Cauchy problem for the heat 
equation is, for each x and all t > 0, infinitely differentiable with respect to both x and t. (See Problem 
4.8.) 
There is an interesting consequence of the smoothing property of the evolution operator for the 
heat equation. A sectionally continuous initial state u(x, 0) can always evolve forward in time in 
accordance with the heat equation. However, if it is not infinitely differentiable with respect to both x 
and t, then it cannot have originated from an earlier state u(x, t), t < O. Thus the heat equation is 
irreversible in the mathematical sense that "forward" time is distinguishable from "backward" time. 
Correspondingly, any physical process for which the heat equation is a mathematical model is 
irreversible in the sense of the Second Law of Thermodynamics.

Additional conditions on the smoothness and compatibility of f, g, and h will result in additional 
smoothness of u(x, t) for O:s x:s L, t ~ O. If such conditions are lacking, the solution may satisfy the initial and 
boundary conditions in a mean-square but not a pointwise sense. 
4.4 WAVELIKE EVOLUTION (HYPERBOLIC PDEs) 
The following two properties contrast with those of diffusionlike evolution. 
Finite speed of propagation. A solution to an initial value problem for the wave equation 
corresponding to initial data that vanish outside some bounded region will itself vanish outside a 
region which is bounded but expands with time. The rate at which this expanding region grows can 
be interpreted as the (finite) speed of propagation of the effect modeled by the wave equation. 
Lack of smoothing action in the evolution operator. The solution of a hyperbolic initial value 
problem cannot be smoother than the initial data; it may in fact be less smooth than the data. When 
irregularities in the solution to a hyperbolic equation are present, they persist in time and are 
propagated along characteristics (d. Problem 2.10). 
Finite propagation speed has various consequences. For instance, at any point in the spatial 
domain at any finite time t > 0, the solution to a hyperbolic initial value problem depends on only a 
portion of the initial data. The set of locations x such that the solution value assumed at x at time t = 0 
affects the value of the solution at (xo, to) constitutes the domain o/ dependence for (xo, to)· For each ("0, to) 
the domain of dependence is of finite extent; consequently, the initial value problem is well-posed 
without the specification of behavior at infinity. 
The lack of smoothing action in wavelike evolution is related to the fact that physical processes 
modeled by the wave equation are thermodynamically reversible. An initial state u(x, O) that is 
lacking in smoothness can evolve forward in time in accordance with the 
ave equation and can, as 
well as not, have originated from an earlier state. Thus we can solve forward in time to find 
subsequent states into which u(x,O) will evolve, or we can solve backward in time to find earlier 
states from which u(x,O) has evolved.

"Profiles" for three time values are plotted in Fig. 4-1. The curves are below the x-axis, in 
accordance with Problem 4.4(a). On x = 0 we have v,(O, t) $ 0 (Problem 4.4(c)) and vx(O, t) = g(t); thus, 
the starting value is a negative, decreasing function of time, while the starting slope is a positive, 
increasing function of time. The curves are concave (Problem 4.4(c)), and have final slope zero 
(vAl, t) = 0). 
Inspection of Fig. 4-1 suggests that, for each fixed t in [0, T],

Thus, even though the influence of the initial state propagates with infinite speed, the strength of 
this influence dies out very rapidly (as e-,2) as the distance (r = Ix - EI) from the set where F o;i 0 
increases. We are therefore able to claim that although solutions to the heat equation exhibit a 
nonphysical property (infinite speed of propagation), they do behave in a manner that is an 
acceptable approximation of reality. Practically speaking, effects governed by the heat equation 
propagate with finite speed. For more on this matter, see Problem 7.8.

the series in (1) converges absolutely and uniformly to a continuous function of x. The same can be said 
of the series obtained from (1 ) by term-by-term differentiation any number of times with respect to x

infinitely differentiable with respect to both x and t for t > 0 and 0 < x < 1T.

We have seen that whereas the fn represent a function of x that is not necessarily even Co, their images under

equations in general) that u(x, t) is an extremely smooth function for t > 0, even if u(x, 0) is not particularly 
smooth. 
For parabolic equations having variable coefficients, the smoothing action of the evolution operator 
may be limited by a lack of smoothness in the coefficients.

Now, the distance from the point (1 + a, 0) to the interval (-1,1) is just a units. Consequently, 
our result may be interpreted to mean that the influence of the initial data requires just 1 unit of 
time to traverse this distance; i.e., the propagation speed is a units of distance per unit of time .

sequently, E (t) = 0 for t ~ O. But then the CO functions v, and Vx must be identically zero, so that v ex' t) 
is a constant. Because v (x, 0) = 0, this constant must be zero. 
If the original boundary conditions are replaced by the conditions u(O, t) = u(L , t) = 0, then 
v,(O, t) = v,(L, t) = 0 
and the uniqueness proof goes through as before.

(a) According to Problem 4.10. (5) is the solution of the following initial value problem: 
u,,(x, t) = a 2uxx(x, t) 
u(x, 0) = Fo(x) 
Ut(x,O) = Go(x) 
-00 < x < 00, t > 0 
- 00< x < 00 
-00 < x <00 
Since Fo(x) = [(x ) and G,,(x) = g(x), for 0 < x < 7T, the expression (5) satisfies the PDE (1), 
together with the initial conditions (2) and (3). Moreover, for t > 0,

u(O, t) = - [Fo (al) + Fo(- at)] + -

since Fo and Go are odd functions. Similarly, using the 27T-periodicity, u( 7T, t) = 0 for t > O. Thus 
u(x, t) as given by (5) satisfies (4) as well. In Problem 4.13 we proved that the problem (1) through 
(4) has at most one solution; therefore, (5) is the solution. 
(b) Differentiation of (5) gives 
(m, n = 0, 1,2, . . . ). Evidently, the continuity of u(x, t) and its derivatives is determined by the 
smoothness of Fo and Go, which, in tum, is dependent on the smoothness of [and g in [0, 7TJ, and 
the compatibility of [ and g with the boundary conditions (4). 
In Problem 6.4 it will be shown that Fo (x) and all its derivatives through order Mare 
continuous for all x if and only if: 
(i) [ (x) and all its derivatives through order M are continuous on [0, 7T] ; 
(ii) 
for all nonnegative integers n such that 2n :$ M, 1'2n)(0) = [ (2n)( 7T) = O. 
Now (ii) is just the condition that [ and g and their even-order derivatives satisfy the boundary 
conditions; this is what is meant by compatibility between the initial data and the boundary 
conditions. If, for some M > 0, (i) or (ii) is not satisfied by both [ and g, the solution u(x, I ) will 
experience some sort of discontinuity along a characteristic. For example, if g(O) 0;£ 0, then Go(x) is 
discontinuous at every integer multiple of 7T, which means, by (6), that u,(x, t) and ux(x, t) 
experience discontinuities for (x, t) such that x ± at = k7T 
(k = integer).

Water flow with velocity v and depth u in a slightly inclined, rectangular, open channel is described by the 
first-order system 
vUx + uVx + U , = 0 
gux + VVx + V, = g(So- Sf) 
where So is the bed slope, Sf measures the frictional resistance to flow, and g is the gravitational 
acceleration constant. In the equations, the channel width has been taken as the unit of length. 
(d) 
Population density u at time t of age-a individuals satisfies the McKendrick-von Foerster equation, 
u, + Ua = -c(t, a, u) 
where C(/, a, u) represents the removal rate at time I of age-a individuals.

In terms of the n x n matrices A = [ajjl and 8 = [bjj ], and the column vectors u = (up u2' ... , UJT

If A or B is nonsingular, it is usually possible to classify system (5.2) according to type. Suppose 
det (8 ) ¥- 0 and define a polynomial of degree n in A by 
Pn(A)==det(AT -ABT)= det(A- AB) 
(5.5) 
System (5.2) is classified as 
elliptic if Pn (A ) has no real zeros. 
hyperbolic 
if Pn (A) has n real, distinct zeros; or if Pn (A ) has n real zeros, at least one of which 
is repeated, and the generalized eigenvalue problem (AT - A B T)t = 0 yields n 
linearly independent eigenvectors t . 
parabolic 
if Pn(A) has n real zeros, at least one of which is repeated, and the above generalized 
eigenvalue problem yields fewer than n linearly independent eigenvectors. 
An exhaustive classification cannot be carried out when Pn{A ) has both real and complex zeros. Since 
ajj and bjj are allowed to depend on x, y, u j , u2 ' .. . , un' the above classification may be position 
and/or solution dependent. 
EXAMPLE 5.5 
(a) 
All four systems of Example 5.1 are hyperbolic. 
(b) If the Cauchy-Riemann equations, Ux = Vy , Uy = - vx , are written in the form (5.2), then 
A = [~ ~] 
and P2(A) = A 2 + 1, which has no real zeros. Thus, the Cauchy-Riemann equations are elliptic (as is 
Laplace's equation for either u or v). 

CHAP. 5] 
FIRST-ORDER EQUA nONS 
53 
(c) If u satisfies the system of equations u, = Vy, Uy = v, then u satisfies the heat equation, u, = Uyy. With t 
playing the role of x in (5.2), we have 
A = [~ ~] 
and P2(A) = A 2 . All eigenvectors corresponding to tbe real do uble root A = ° are scalar mUltiples of [0, 1 r. 
Hence there is just one linearly independent eigenvector and the first-order system is parabolic. 
The method of characteristics for linear second-order PDEs (Chapter 2) may be usefully 
extended to hyperbolic, but not to elliptic or parabolic, first-order systems. For this reason, the 
remainder of this chapter will deal almost exclusively with hyperbolic systems. 
5.3 NORMAL FORM FOR HYPERBOLIC SYSTEMS 
If in (5.2), Aux + Buy = c, the coefficient matrices A and B are such that A = DB, for some 
diagonal matrix D, then the system can be written in component form as

(i = 1, 2, ... , n) 
wherein the ith equation involves differentiation only in a single direction-the direction dx/dy = dii• 
We say in this case that (5.2) is in normal form. When a system is in normal form, techniques of 
ordinary differential equations become applicable to it. 
Suppose that (5.2) is hyperbolic, and let AI' A2 , ..• ,An denote the n real zeros of the polynomial 
(5.5). The characteristics of (5.2) are those curves in the xy-plane along which 
dx

I 
(i=1,2, ... ,n) 
(5.6) 
EXAMPLE 5.6 For a linear system, the Ai depend at most on x and y; so the characteristics of (5.2) can be 
determined by integrating the ordinary equations (5.6). For a quasiJinear system, where the Ai depend on 
Ur, U2, . .. , Un, the characteristics are solution dependent. In the case that (5.2) consists of a single quasilinear 
PDE, many authors call the plane curves determined by (5.6) the characteristic base curves, and use the term 
"characteristics" or "characteristic curves" to denote the space curves in xyu-space whose projections on the 
xy-plane are the characteristic base curves. In this Outline we shall use "characteristics" to denote both the plane 
and the space curves; the context will make it clear which kind of curves is intended. 
Theorem 5.1: 
For (5.2) hyperbolic, let D denote the n x n diagonal matrix of the Ai' Then there 
exists a nonsingular n x n matrix T satisfying

According to Theorem 5.1, if (5.2) is not already in normal form, the transformed system 
TAux + TBuy = Tc 
(5. 7) 
(5.8) 
IS In normal form, with the ith row-equation involving differentiation only in the direction of the 
tangent to the ith characteristic. Stated otherwise, a hyperbolic system can always be brought into 
normal form by taking suitable linear combinations of the equations. 
5.4 THE CAUCHY PROBLEM FOR A HYPERBOLIC SYSTEM 
The Cauchy problem (or initial value problem) for a hyperbolic system (5.2) calls for determining 
ui (x, y) (i = 1, 2, ... , n) that satisfy (5.2) and take prescribed values (the initial data) on some 
initial curve, r. If r is nowhere tangent to a characteristic of (5.2) and if the coefficients in (5.2) are 

54 
FIRST-ORDER EQUA nONS 
[CHAP. 5 
continuous, the Cauchy problem is well-posed in a neighborhood of r. At the other extreme, if r 
coincides with a characteristic, then the Cauchy problem usually will be insoluble (see Problem 5.29). 
In illustration, suppose that n = 3, and let C€l' C€2' C€3 be the characteristics of (5.2) that pass 
through the point R (see Fig. 5-1). The shaded region of the xy-plane enveloped by the charac-
teristics and the initial curve r is caHed the domain of dependence of the point R ; the portion of r 
between P and Q is called the interval of dependence of R. Changes in the initial data exterior to the 
interval PO will not affect the solution at R. 
y 
r 
x 
Fig. 5-1 
Any discontinuities in the initial data are propagated away from the initial curve along the 
characteristics defined by (5.6). When the system (5.2) is nonlinear, it is possible-even for smooth 
initial data-for the solution to develop discontinuities some distance from the initial curv . These 
discontinuities occur when two characteristics carrying contradictory information about the solution 
intersect. A curve across which one or more of the u;(x, y) hav jump discontinuities is called a 
shock. The position of the shock and the magnitudes of the jumps in the uj are determined by 
conservation principles (see Problem 5.17).

Show that the characteristics of the quasilinear first-order PDE

are the curves along which (1) and a knowledge of u are insufficient uniquely to determine Ux

along which

by which u. and uy are uniquely determined along cg, unless the determinant of the system is zero:

But (2) holds if and only if

definition, it is in normal form.

Show that a surface 9' given by u = I(x, y) defines a solution to the quasilinear first-order 
equation

words, a solution surface of (1 ) consists entirely of (space) characteristics. 
If f(x, y) - u = 0, then 
0= d(f(x, y) - u) = fxdx + fydy - du = (fx,fy, -1) ' (dx, dy, du ) 
Now, if (4b) of Problem 5.3 holds, the vectors (dx, dy, du ) and (a, b, c) are parallel, whence 
0= (fx,fy, -1)· (a, b, c) = afx + bfy - c 
(2) 
i.e., the function f satisfies (1 ). 
Conversely, if :J' is defined by a solution f(x, y) - u = 0 of (1), then (2 ) shows that at any point P of 
:J' the vector (a, b, c) is orthogonal to the surface normal (fx'/y, -1),JllUs, (a, b, c) represents a direction 
in the tangent plane at P ; a curve eg lying in :J' and passing through P in this direction will have, at P, the

is defined implicitly by 
a(u)ux + uy = 0 
u(x, 0) = uo(x ) 
u = uo(x - a(u)y) 
provided 1 + ub(x - a(u) y ) a'(u) y =;I- O. 
Again following Problem 5.5, we consider the equivalent problem 
xr= a(u) 
Yr=l 
Ur = 0 
x(O,s) =s 
y(O,s)=O 
u(O, s) = uo(s) 
Integrating the equations (4) in reverse order and applying the conditions (5), we find: 
U = uo(s) 
y=r 
x = a(Uo(s» r + s 
From (6 ), there follows 
u = uo(s) = Uo(x - a(Uo(s» r ) = uo(x - a(u)y) 
which is (3). 
The expression (3) will actually fu rnish the solution to (1 )-(2) provided the equation 
1I>(x, y, u) == U - Uo(x - a(u)y) = 0 
can be solved for u as a function of x and y. The condition for solvability is 
<t>~(x, y, u ) = 1 + uO(x - a(u)y ) a'(u)y =;I- 0 
which certainly holds for Iyl sufficiently small.

FOURIER SERIES 
Let F(x ) be an arbitrary function defined in (-e, e). The infinite trigonometric series 
~ao+ L: an cos (mTX/e) + bnsin (n7Tx/e) 
n=l 
is called the Fourier series for F(x) if the coefficients an and bn are given by 
1 t I e  
a" = e J F(x) cos (n7Tx/e) dx 
bn = e J F(x) sin (n7Tx/e) dx 
- f 
-( 
in which case the coefficients are known as the Fourier coefficients for F(x). 
(6.1) 
(6.2) 
Since each of the trigonometric functions in the Fourier series for F(x) is periodic of period 2e, it 
follows that if the series actually converges to F(x) for - e < x < e, then it converges to the 
2e-periodic extension of F(x), 
F(x)= F(x) (-e < x <e) 
and 
F(x) = F(x + 2e) 
(6.3) 
for all x in the domain of F; see Problem 6.3. 
Theorem 6.1 states sufficient conditions for the convergence of a Fourier series, in terms of 
properties of F(x). These, of course, derive from properties of F(x), as discussed in Problem 6.3. 
Recall that a function is piecewise or sectionally continuous in (-00, (0) if it has at most finitely many 
finite jump discontinuities in any interval of finite length. 
Theorem 6.1: Let F(x ) be defined in( - e, e) and let F(x) denote the 2e-periodic extension of F(x). 
(i) If F(x) and F'(x) are both sectionally continuous, the Fourier series for F(x ) 
converges pointwise to F(x) at each point where F (x ) is continuous. At each Xo 
where F(x) has a jump discontinuity, the series converges to the average of the 
left- and right-hand limits of F(x) at xo. 
(ii) If F (x) is continuous and F'(x ) is sectionally continuous, the Fourier series for 
F(x) converges uniformly to F(x). 
(iii) If F(x) is in C P and if F(P+l)(X) is sectionally co tinuous, the series obtained by 
differentiating the Fourier series for F(x ) termwise j times (j = 0, 1, .. . , p) 
converges uniformly to ft(j)(x). 
6.2 GENERALIZED FOURIER SERIES 
To extend the notion of Fourier series to other than trigonometric expansions, we first recall the 
usual definition of the inner product of two vectors in RN : 
X · Y or (x, y) = X1Yl + X2Y2 + ... + XNYN 
(6.4) 
A set of vectors {Xl> ... , xM} in RN is an orthogonal family if (Xi' X) = 0 for i ¥ j 
(i, j = 1, . . . , M ); it 
is an orthonormal family if 
72 
i¥j 
i=j

CHAP. 6] 
EXPANSIONS AND TRANSFO RMS: THEORY 
73 
Clearly, an orthogonal family of nonzero vectors can always be made into an orthonormal family by 
dividing each vector Xi by its norm, Ilxill = (Xi' x)1I2. 
Definition: 
An orthogonal family is complete in RN if the only vector orthogonal to every member of the 
family is the zero vector. 
Theorem 6.2: 
A ny complete orthonormal family {xl' ... , xM } is a basis of RN (i.e., M = N) in terms 
of which an arbitrary vector v has the representation 
N 
V = L (v, Xn)Xn 
"= 1 
The coefficients cn == (v, xn) in (6.6) are such that the Pythagorean relation 
N 
IlvW = 2: c~ 
n=I 
(6.6) 
(6.7) 
holds when RN is referred to the orthonormal basis {xn }. It is the formal resemblance of the right side 
of (6.6) to the Nth partial sum of the Fourier series (6.1)-(6.2) that serves as the springboard for the 
generalization that follows. 
Let F (x) denote a function which is defined in (a, b) and satisfies 
b 
{ F (X)2 dx < 00 
(6.8) 
The collection of all such functions will be denoted by L2(a, b). Two elements, F and G, are said to 
be equaL in the L 2(a, b)-sense if 
b 
fa [F(x)- G(x)fdx=O 
This concept of equality is used to define what is meant by the convergence of an infinite series of 
L2(a, b)-functions: 
Fj(x) + Fix) + ... converges to the limit F(x) in L\a, b) if 
lim( [F(x)- i
F;(x)fdX=O 
(6.9) 
N--+oo 
a 
i=1 
(This kind of convergence is frequently referred to as mean-square convergence.) 
With the introduction of an inner product, 
b 
(F, G ) == { F(x )G(x) dx 
(6.10) 
(which is well defined by virtue of Problem 6.16), L\a, b) becomes an inner product space. 
O rthogonality, normality, and completeness are defined exactly as in RN. In L2(a, b), a complete 
orthonormal family is necessarily infinite, but an infinite orthonormal family is not necessarily 
complete.

However, the union of these two families is a complete orthonormal family, and it generates the Fourier series 
(6.1) for a square-integrable function F(x). 
Analogous to Theorem 6.2 we have 
Theorem 6.3: If {un (x)}, n = 1, 2, ... , is a complete orthonormal family in L2(a, b), then for arbi-
trary F(x) in L2(a, b),

There remains the problem of finding (nontrigonometric) complete orthonormal families for the 
constructi n of generalized Fourier series (6.11). The next section will show that such families arise 
naturally as the solutions to certain boundary value problems for ordinary differential equations. 
6.3 STURM- LIOUVILLE PROBLEMS; EIGENFUNCTION EXPANSIONS 
Consider the following boundary value problem for the unknown fu nction w(x): 
-( p(x)w'(x»' + q(x)w(x) = Ar(x)w(x) 
C 1w(a)+ C2w'(a) = 0

(3) 
C~+ C~ -:;t 0, C~+ C~ -:;t 0, then (6.13) constitutes a Sturm -Liouville problem. The function 
w(x) == 0 is a trivial solution to any Sturm-Liouville problem. In addition, for certain values of the 
parameter A, there exist nontrivial solutions. Each value of A for which a nontrivial solution exists is 
called an eigenvalue of the problem, and the corresponding nontrivial solution is called an eigen-
function. 
Theorem 6.4: The eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of a Sturm-Liouville problem have the following 
properties. 
(i) 
All eigenvalues are real and compose a countably infinite collection satisfying 
Al < A2 < ... < As -'> roo 
(ii) 
(iii) 
To each eigenvalue An there corresponds only one independent eigenfunction 
wn (x ).

An eigenfunction expansion- Le., a generalized Fourier series for an L 2(a, b)-function F based on 
the family (6.14 )-not only converges in the mean-square sense (Theorem 6.3), but also:

Theorem 6.5: 
(i) If F and F' are both sectionally continuous in (a, b), then the series converges 
pointwise to the value [F(x+) + F(x- )]/2 at each x in (a, b). 
(ii) If F and F' are continuous in (a, b), if F" is sectionally continuous, and if F 
satisfies the boundary conditions of the Sturm-Liouville problem (6.13), then 
the series converges uniformly to F(x) in (a, b). 
6.4 FOURIER AND LAPLACE INTEGRAL TRANSFORMS 
Theorem 6.4(i) and (iii) also hold for the eigenvalues n = 0, 1,2, ... and eigenfunctions {e±inx} of 
the problem

W'(-7T) = W'(7T)

which is of Sturm-Liouville type, except for the boundary conditions, which are periodic instead of 
separated. Thus, for arbitrary f(x) in L2(-7T, 7T), we have (cf. (6.9»

~{f(x)} = F(a) 
or

Operational properties of the Fourier transform are listed in Table 6-1. In addition, Table 6-2 gives a 
number of specific functions and their Fourier transforms. For our purposes, inversion of the Fourier 
transform will be carried out by using Table 6-2 as a dictionary, together with certain of the

Find all eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for the problem 
-w"(x) = Aw(x) 
w'(O) = w'(f) = 0 
O<x < f 
As this problem is of Sturm-Liouville type, Theorem 6.4(i) ensures that the 
igenvalues A are 
real-negative, zero, or positive. Each of the three possibilities for A leads to a different form of the 
generaJ solution to the differential equation, and we must then check to see which solution(s) can satisfy 
the homogeneous boundary conditions without reducing to the trivial solution. 
If A < 0, write A = _JL2 < O. Then w(x) = AeSLX + Be- JL\ and the boundary conditions, 
w'(O) = JL(A - B) = 0 
are satisfied if and only if A = B = 0; i.e., there are no negative eigenvalues. 
If A = 0, then w(x) = Ax + B, and the boundary conditions, 
w'(O) = A = 0 
w'(e) = A = 0 

CHAP. 6]

79 
are satisfied by w(x) = B o¢ O. Thus, A = 0 is an eigenvalue, and all corresponding eigenfunctions are 
constant multiples of wo(x) = 1. 
If A > 0, write A = /L 2 > O. Then w(x ) = A sin /LX + B cos /LX, and 
w'(O) = /LA = 0 
w'(t) = /LA cos /Lt -
/LB sin /Lt = 0 
The determinant of this system, -/L2 sin /Lt, vanishes for /Ln = n7T/e (n = ±1, ±2, ... ). Hence, the 
positive eigenvalues are An = (n7T/t)2 
(n = 1, 2, ... ), and the eigenfunctions corresponding to An all are 
constant multiples of wn(x) = cos nmc/e. 
It is seen that the eigenfunction expansion on (0, t) yielded by the above Sturm-Liouville problem is 
nothing other than the Fourier cosine series of Problem 6.1(a). Changing the boundary conditions to 
w(O) = w(e) = 0 would yield the Fourier sine series. 
6.3 
Given a function F(x), defined on the closed interval [-e, e], state conditions sufficient to 
ensure that F (x) is C P on the whole real axis. 
If F(x) were defined merely in (-e, e), then (6.3) would fail to define F at the points X = 
± t, ±3e, ±5t, . .. , so that questions of continuity would be meaningless. Even if 
(i) F(x) is defined on 
[-e, t], 
the function F is well defined only if 
(ii) F(t) = F(-t). If (i) and (ii) hold and, in addition, 
F (x) is continuous on [-t, e), it is apparent that F(x) will be continuous for all x. 
Repeating the above argument with respect to the derivatives of f:; we prove the 
Theorem: 
F(x) is C P if, for j = 0,1, ... , p, F(j)(x) is continuous on [-t, t] and obeys 
F(j)(t) = F(j)(-t) 
6.4 
Given a function f(x ), defined on the closed interval [0, e], state conditions sufficient to ensure 
that Fo(x ) [Problem 6.1(b)] is C P on the whole real axis. 
We apply the result of Problem 6.3 to the function Fo(x) of Problem 6.1(b), making two preliminary 
observations: 
(1) 
For the odd function Fo(x) to be continuous on [-e, t] and to obey Fo(t) = Fo(-t), it is 
sufficient (and necessary) that f(x) be continuous on [0, t) and obey f(O) = f(t) = O. 
(2) For odd j, the jth derivative F(P(x) is an even function in [-e, e). Hence, if it exists, this 
function automatically satisfies F(P(t) = F(jl(-t). 
Theorem: 
Fo(x) is C P if Pil(x) is continuous on [0, t] for j = 0, 1, ... , p, and if

Eigenfunction Expansions and 
Integral Transforms: Applications 
The techniques of Chapter 6 can yield exact solutions to certain PDEs, by reducing them to 
ordinary differential equations or even to algebraic equations. For success, it is essential that the 
PDE be linear and hence allow superposition of solutions. 
7.1 
THE PRINCIPLE OF SUPERPOSITION 
Let L [ ] denote any linear partial differential operator; e.g., (3.3). Then, for arbitrary, 
sufficiently smooth functions U\' .. . , UN and arbitrary constants cp . .. , CN' 
and so 
L [ Uj ] = 0 (j = 1, . .. , N ) ~ L[ c\ u\ + ... + CNUN] = 0 
(7.2) is one statement of the principle of superposition. 
For infinite linear combinations such that 
and 
both converge, we have 
L [i CkUk] = i ckL[uk] 
k=\ 
k= \ 
and the superposition principle reads: 
L[uk ]=O (all k) ~ L[ i CkUk]=O

7.2 SEPARATION OF VARIABLES 
If u(x, y) satisfies a linear PDE in x and y, then the method of separation of variables for this 
problem begins with the assumption that u(x, y) is of the form X (x) Y (y). This has the effect of

EXPANSIONS AND TRANSFORMS: APPLICATIONS 
[CHAP. 7 
replacing the single PDE with two ordinary differential equations. The theory of eigenfunction 
expansions enters into the treatment of any inhomogeneous aspects of the problem. 
EXAMPLE 7.1 
By examining the Solved Problems, where numerous applications of the method of eigen-
function expansion (separation of variables) are made, we see that for the method to be successful, the problem 
must have the following attributes: 
(1) 
At least one of the independent variables in the problem must be restricted to a finite interval. 
Moreover, the domain· of the problem must be a coordinate cell in the coordinate system in which the 
PDE is expressed (e.g., in Cartesian coordinates, a rectangle; in polar coordinates, a sector). See 
Problem 7.17(b). 
(2) 
The PDE must separate; see Problem 7.17(a). 
(3) 
In general, homogeneous boundary conditions must be arranged such that at least one of the separated 
problems is a Sturm-Liouville problem. (If this is not the case, it can often be made so by reduction to 
subproblems or by a change of dependent variable.) See Problems 7.18 and 7.4. 
7.3 INTEGRAL TRANSFORMS 
The integral transforms which are most generally applicable are the Fourier and Laplace 
transforms. Others, such as the Hankel and Mellin transforms, are sometimes useful, but they will not be 
considered here. 
EXAMPLE 7.2 Examination of the Solved Problems reveals that integral transforms apply in the following 
situations: 
(1) The PDE has constant coefficients (otherwise the Fourier or Laplace transform would not produce an 
ordinary differential equation in the transform space). 
(2) 
The independent variable ranges over an unbounded interval. If the interval is (-00,00), then the 
Fourier transform is the likely transform to use. If the interval is (0,00) and, in addition, if the initial 
conditions are appropriate, then the Laplace transform is indicated.

For f(x) in L2(0, t), find u(x, t) satisfying 
u(x, 0) = f(x) 
u(O, t) = u(e, t) = 0 
Assume that u(x, t) = X(x) T(t). Then 
u,(x, t) = X(x) T(t)

And sin (n7Tx/e) satisfies the PDE (1)

U(x, t) = :z: enun(x, t)

has these same properties, for any set of constants en for which the series converges. Finally, the initial 
condition (2) will be satisfied if 
I(x) = :z: enun(x, 0) = :z: en sin (n7Tx/e)

It is obvious physically that an initially antisymmetric temperature distribution must evolve antisym-
metrically; that is, the solution vex, I) of (1 )-(2) ought to be odd in x. If it is, and in addition is 
continuous and bounded for all x and all positive t, then its restriction to x > 0 provides the solution 
U2(X, I) of subproblem 2. Now, by Problem 7.6, the unique solution of (1 )-(2) is

Evidently, as was suggested in Problem 4.14(a), the initial-boundary value problem (1)-(2)-(3) is 
equivalent to the pure initial value problem in which the initial data are the periodic functions Fo and Go. 
Indeed, for such data, separation of variables in a half-period strip has led to the same D' Alembert 
solution of the wave equation as is furnished by the method of characteristics when applied over the 
entire xt-plane. See Problem 4.10.

Neither variable is restricted to a bounded interval; so separation of variables is not indicated. 
Neither variable ranges over the whole real line; so the Fourier transform does not seem to apply. 
Finally, the Laplace transform does not apply, since the equation is second-order in either variable but 
there is only one initial condition for either variable. However, a reduction of the problem to two 
subproblems, 
u(x, y) = u,(x, y) + U2(X, y)

If we suppose that u(x, y) = X (x) Y (y), then X "(x) Y ( y) + X'(x) Y'(y) + X(x) yl/(y) = 0 and there is 
no way to separate this expression so as t have a function of x alone on one side of the equation and a 
function of y alone on the other side.

If we suppose that u(x, y) = X(x) Y(y), then the equation separates into two ordinary differential 
equations. However, the boundary conditions do not lead to a problem of Sturm- Liouville type either 
for X(x) or Y (y). The difficulty lies in the fact that the region {O < x < 1, 0 < Y < x} is not a coordinate 
cell. This problem may, in fact, be solved by means of a clever transformation (see Problem 7.18). In 
general, when 11 is not a coordinate cell, no such transformation is possible. 
7.18 
Transform Problem 7.17(b) so that it becomes separable, and carry out the solution. For 
convergence of the series, assume that /(0) = /(1) = O. 
Extend the problem to the square 0 < x < 1, 0 < Y < 1, making the boundary data antisymmetric 
with respect to the diagonal y = x (see Fig. 7-3). This forces v(x, x) = O. Now, decompose the v-problem 
into two subproblems such that v = V I + V2 .

INTRODUCTION 
In a region n with boundary S, let 
L[u] =f(x) 
B [u] = 0 
in n 
on S 
(8.1) 
(8.2) 
represent, respectively, a linear, second-order PDE and linear boundary-initial conditions, such that 
for each continuous f, the problem (8.1 )-(8.2) has a unique solution. Then G(x;~) is the Green's 
function for the problem if this unique solution is given by 
u(x) = J G(x; ~)f(~) dtn 
n 
(We attach a subscript to the volume element to emphasize that the integration is with respect to the 
~-variables.) 
EXAMPLE 8.1 
We know (Problems 4.2, 4.7, 4.17, 7.6) that the initial value problem for the heat equation, 
has the unique solution 
v,(x, t) - vxx (x, t) = 0

It then follows from Duhamel's principle (Problem 4.23) that the problem 
has the unique solution 
u,(x, t)- uxx(x, t) = f(x) 
u(x, 0) = 0

(4) 
It is seen that the Green's function (4) exhibits singular behavior as x = (x, t) approaches ~ = (g, T). This holds 
true for Green's functions in general, and is reflected in the fact that G(x;~) for (8.1 )- (8.2) satisfies, as a 
function of x, the PDE 
L[u] = o(x - ~) 
(5) 
which is (8.1) with f(x) replaced by the "function" c5(x - ~) (see Problem 8.1). We call a solution of (5) a 
singularity solution for L[ ]. The essence, then, of the Green's function method is to represent f(x) in (8.1) as a 
"sum" of delta functions, thereby obtaining u(x) as the "sum" of the corresponding singularity solutions 
(adjusted to obey (8.2 )).

for n 2: 1, V;O" = 0 for all x ,t. ~; 
(iii) 
for n > 1, the integral of the normal derivative of 0" over any sphere centered at 
x = ~ is equal to one. (This extends in the obvious way to RI.) 
Since O'(x; ~) = O"(~ ; x), Theorem 8.1 is valid with the roles of x and ~ reversed. 
Because Poisson's equation, V
2u = p(x), is solved in unbounded R
n by 
u(x) = f O"(x; ~)p(~) dll 
Rn 
the singularity solution serves as the Green's function for V2[ ] when no boundaries are present; we 
call it the free-space Green's function. We now show how to modify this function so that it gives the 
Green's function when boundary conditions have to be satisfied. 
Let !l be a region with boundary S, and take ~ to be a fixed point inside n. If, as a function of x, 
V2h = 0 in n, then the function 
cfJ(x, ~) = O"(x; ~) + h 
where h may depend on ~ as well as on x, is called a fundamental solution of J: place's equation in !l. 
EXAMPLE 8.3 Let.n be the upper half of the xy-plane and let t = (g, T/) be a fixed point in fl. Both 
c/>I(X, y ; g, T/) = o-(x, y; g, T/) + X2 - y2

If f and u are sufficiently welI-behaved at infinity, then Theorem 8.2 is valid in unbounded regions. In 
(8.4) the roles of x and ~ can be interchanged to obtain an expression for u(x)

As with the diffusion equation, the singularity solution is a point-source solution in that k satisfies 
ku - a 2V2k = o(x -~) oCt - T) 
In the variables x, t, the function k represents the causal Green's function for the wave equation; in 
t, T, it is the free-space Green's function. Figure 8-1 suggests the difference in interpretation, for 
n = 1.

In contrast to the diffusion equation, however, the singularity solution for the wave equation 
depends essentially on the dimension n. For n = 3, the delta function in (8.22) implies that, at time t, 
the disturbance due to a local impulse at t = (g, 'TI, () at time T < t is concentrated on the surface of a 
sphere of radius aCt - T) with center at (g, 'TI, (). However, for n = 2, because of the Heaviside 
fu nction, the analogous disturbance is distributed over the interior of a circle of radius a (t - T) 
centered on the source. Both disturbances are traveling radially with speed a; but, while in three 
dimensions there is a sharp wave front that leaves no wake, in two dimensions a wake exists that 
decays like Va (t - T) after the wave front passes. The foregoing observations form the basis of 
Huygens' principle. 
Fundamental solutions of the wave equation and Green's functions for initial- boundary value 
problems are obtained from the singularity solution as in the parabolic case, Section 8.4. In 
particular, consider the problem

Solved Problems 
8.1 
Let n be an open region and let T denote the set of all infinitely differentiable (COO) functions 
on n having the property that each 0 in T is identically zero outside some closed bounded 
subset of n. T is called the set of test functions on n (d. Problem 5.15). A sequence {On} of test 
functions is said to converge to zero in T if all the On are zero outside some common bounded set 
and if {On} and all its derived sequences converge uniformly to zero as n -'> 00. Any rule d which 
assigns to each test function ° a real number, (d, 0), which satisfies the linearity condition (note 
that T is a vector space over the reals) 
(d, 0'01 + f30z) = a (d, ( 1) + f3(d, Oz) 
and the continuity condition 
(a, f3 in R; Op Oz in T) 
lim (d, On) = 0 
whenever 
{On} converges to zero in T 
(1) 
(2) 
is called a distribution or generalized function. (a) If f(x) is a continuous function in n, show 
that the rule 
(f, 0) == J f(x) O(x) dn 
n 
defines a distribution. (b) If ~ is any point in n, show that the rule 
(0, 0) == O(xo) 
defines a distribution. 
(3 ) 
(4) 
(a) Since f is continuous and 0 is Coo and vanishes outside a bounded subset of 0 , the integral on the 
right of (3) exists (i.e., is a real number). The linearity condition (1) follows immediately from the 
linearity in 0 of the integral (3). To establish the continuity condition (2), Jet {On} converge to zero 
in T. Since the On all vanish outside some common set, Q, in 0 and {On} converges uniformly to 
zero on Q, 
lim (f, On) = lim f jOn dO = lim f fOn d O = f (lim On)f dO = 0 
n-+ oo 
n-+ oo n 
n_co

Thus, (3) defines a distribution. Because this distribution is determined exclusively by the 
continuous function f, it too has been given the symbol f.

[CHAP. 8 
(b) 
Since Xo is in 11 and 0 is a test function on 11, the right side of (4) is well defined. The rule 8 assigns 
to the linear combination of test functions aO, + (302 the number 
so (4) satisfies (1). For any sequence {On} which converges to zero In T, it is clear that 
(8, On ) = On(XO)~O as n ~oo; therefore, (2) is also satisfied. 
The distribution or generalized function (4) is known as the Dirac delta distribution or, more 
commonly, as the Dirac delta function. By a formal analogy with (3), it is common practice to write 
(8, 0) = L 
8(x - xo) O(x) d11 = O(xo) 
(5) 
even though there is no continuous function f(x) that can be identified with 8(x - xo). 
A linear combination of two distributions, d, and d2 , is defined by 
(a, (3 in R) 
Products and quotients of distributions are not well-defined in general. However, if x = (x, y) and 
t = (g, TJ), the two-dimensional 8-function 8(x - t) can be represented as a direct product of two 
one-dimensional 8-functions: 
8(x - t) = 8(x - g)8(y - TJ) 
A distribution d is said to be zero on an open set 11' in 11 if (d, 0) = 0 for every 0 in T which is 
identically zero outside 11'. In this sense, 8(x - xo) is zero on any region that does not contain Xo.

Establish Theorem 8.2 for R2. 
Let t = (g, TJ) be any point in the two-dimensional region 11 and let r = Ix - tl be the distance from t

When applying the method of images to Laplace's equation in R2, it is often helpful to interpret the 
free-space Green's function, (T(x, y; g, 71), as the steady xy-temperature distribution due to a unit line 
sink at (g, 71). ("Sink," not "source," because of Fourier's law and Theorem 8.1(iii).) 
(a) 
In -00 < x < 00, y > 0, if (T(x, y; g, 71 ) represents a sink at (g, 71), 71 > 0, then a symmetrically placed 
source at (g, - 71), - (T(x, y; g, - 71), will ensure a zero temperature on y = O. Because hex, y; g, 71) ""'-
-(T(x, y; g, -71) is harmonic in y > 0, we have from Theorem 8.3:

In this case, an infinite series of sources and sinks is required to make G = 0 on both y = 0 and

An eigenfunction expansion is most simply obtained if the left side of (3) is put in self-adjoint

(a) The Green's function is a fundamental solution, G = K + J, with J chosen to make G = 0 on y = 0

image point (g, -7)) is required. In an attempt to zero Gx on x = 0, place a source at (-g,7)). 
Finally, balance these two images with a sink, -K(x, y, t; -g, -7), r):

DIFFERENCE EQUATIONS 
The various partial derivatives of a function u(x, t) can be expressed as a difference quotient plus 
a truncation error (T.E.).

Usually it is only the order of magnitude of the truncation error which is of interest. A function 
f(h) is said to be of the order of m agnitude g(h ) as h.....,. 0, where g is a nonnegative function, if 
lim f(h) = constant 
h~O g(h) 
In the O-notation we write f(h) = O(g(h» 
(h .....,. 0). It is easy to see that if, as h p h2.....,. 0, fl = O(g 1) 
and f2 = 0(g2)' then fl + f2 = O (gl + g2)' 
EXAMPLE 9.1 
For (9.1), T.E.= O(k) 
(k ..... O), provided Un is bounded. For (9.2), T.E. = O(h2) 
(h ..... O), 
provided Uxxx is bounded. In (9.4), T.E. = O (h 2 + e ), provided Uxxxt and Uxrn are bounded ; we omit as understood 
the (h, k ..... 0). 
A grid or mesh in the xt-plane is a set of points (xn' t) = (xo + nh, to + jk ), where n and j are integers 
and (xo, to) is a reference point. The (xn , t) are called grid points, mesh points, or nodes. The positive

numbers h and k are respectively the x and t grid spacings or grid siz es. If hand k are constants, the grid 
is called uniform ; if h = k = constant, the grid is said to be square. The compact subscript notation 
ulli == U(XII' t) 
is convenient and widely used. 
EXAMPLE 9.2 The difference formulas (9.1) and (9.3) may be written 
where the difference operator o ~ is the analog of the differential operator 02/0X2. We say that (9.1) is two-level (in t) 
because it involves only two j-values , these being consecutive. 
Let a region !i in the xt-plane be covered by a grid, (XII' tJ If all the derivatives in the POE 
L[u ] = f 
(x, t)in !i 
(9.5) 
are replaced by difference quotients, the result is the finite-difference equation 
(9.6) 
The continuous problem (9.5) was differenced or discretized to produce the discrete problem (9.6), 
whose solution, U lli, approximates u(x, t) at the grid points. 
9.2 CONSISTENCY AND CONVERGENCE 
If discretization is to provide a usefu l approximation, the solution to (9.5) should very nearly 
satisfy (9.6 ), when hand k are taken ufficientiy small . The amount by which the solution to L[ul = f 
fails to satisfy the diff rence equation is called the local truncation error; it may be expressed as 
Tlli == D[ulli ]- fni 
The difference equation (9.6) is said to be consistent with the PDE (9.5) if 
lim Tni = 0 
h. k~O 
(9.7) 
With the exception of the DuFort- Frankel method (Problem 9.10), all difference methods to be 
treated are consistent with their corresponding PDEs. 
In addition to consistency, we want the accuracy of the approximation to improve as h, k ~ O. If 
Uni is the exact solution to (9.6 ) and uni is the solution of (9.5) evaluated at (x"' (i)' the discretization 
error is defined as Uni -
uni" The difference method (9.6) is said to be convergent if 
lim !Uni- uni! = O 
(x,.,t)in!i 
(9. 8) 
h. k~O 
It is possible for a difference method to be consistent but not convergent. 
9.3 STABILITY 
Let U ni satisfy (9.6 ), with initial values UnO and possibly boundary values prescribed. Let Vni be 
the solution to a perturbed difference system which differs only in the initial values, and write 
VnO == UnO + EnO ' Then, a suming exact arithmetic, the initial perturbation, or "error," E nO' can be 
shown to propagate, with increasing j, according to the homogeneous difference equation 

126 
DIFFERENCE METHODS FOR PARABOLIC EQUATIONS 
D[Enj ] = 0 
subject to homogeneous boundary conditions. 
[CHAP. 9 
When applying (9.6) to approximate u(x, T) for fixed T = to + jk, it is clear that letting h, k ~ 0 
entails letting j ~ 
00. Also, on a fixed grid, if we apply (9.6) to approximate u(xn' t) at successively 
larger ~, then again we have the case j ~ 
00 to consider. For a PDE with a bounded solution, the 
difference method (9.6) is said to be stable if the Enj are uniformly bounded in n as j ~ 
00; i.e., if for 
some constant M and some positive integer ] 
(j > J ) 
(9.9 ) 
If h and k must be functionally related for (9.9 ) to hold, the difference method is conditionally stable. 
When the PDE has a solution that is unbounded in t, the stability condition (9.9) is relaxed to allow 
errors to grow with the solution (see Problem 9.7). 
One of the concerns in applying a difference method is whether or not rounding errors in the 
calculation grow to such an extent that they dominate the numerical solution. When a stable method 
is used, rounding errors do not generally cause any difficulties. 
It is usually easier to check a difference method for consistency and stability than for con-
vergence. Fortunately, stability and convergence are equivalent for a large class of problems. 
Theorem 9.1 
(Lax Equivalence Theorem ): Given a well-posed initial-boundary value problem and a 
finite-difference problem consistent with it, stability is both necessary and sufficient for 
convergence. 
In certain cases (e.g., Problem 9.11) the boundary conditions imposed on (9.5) make themselves 
felt as modifications in the form of the operator D[ ] of (9.6), as it applies at grid points adjacent to 
the boundary. Let us agree to call Unj an extended solution of (9.6) if it satisfies the equation for the 
unmodified operator; an extended solution would be an actual solution in the event that (9.5 ) held 
over the entire xt-plane. 
von Neumann stability criterion. A difference method for an initial- boundary value problem with a 
bounded solution is von Neumann stable if every extended solution to D[ Unj ] = 0 of the fonn 
Unj = t
j e
i
/3
n (f3 real, t = t (f3) complex) 
has the property It I ~ 1. For a problem with an unbounded solution, the criterion becomes It I ~ 
1 + O(k). 
For a rationale of the von Neumann criterion, see Problem 9.5. Stability in the von Neumann 
sense is a necessary condition for stability in the general sense of (9.9); moreover, 
Theorem 9.2: 
For two-level difference methods, von Neumann stability is both necessary and 
sufficient for stability. 
Consider an initial-boundary value problem with N nodes in the x-direction and define a column 
vector of errors at level j, E j = (Elj, E 2j, E 3j , •. • , EN)T. For two-level difference methods, the errors 
at levels j and j + 1 are related by 
Ej + l = CEj 
where C is an N x N matrix. Let p(C), the spectral radius of C, denote the maximum of the magnitudes of 
the eigenvalues of C. 
Matrix stability criterion. A two-level difference method for an initial-boundary value problem with 
a bounded solution is matrix stable if p(C) ~ 1. For a problem with an unbounded solution, the criterion 
becomes p(C) ~ 1 + O(k). 
Matrix stability is a necessary condition for the stability of a two-level method. Furthermore, 
Theorem 9.3: 
Let C be symmetric or similar to a symmetric matrix, whereby aU eigenvalues of C 
are real. Then matrix stability is necessary and sufficient for stability. 

CHAP. 9] 
DIFFERENCE METHODS FOR PARABOLIC EQUATIONS 
127 
Although a matrix stability analysis incorporates the boundary conditions of the problem (as 
reflected in the form of C) whereas a von Neumann stability analysis neglects the boundary 
conditions, the conclusions reached regarding the stability of a difference method are nearly always 
the same. This indicates that the stability of a method is determined more by the character of the 
difference equations than by the way in which the boundary conditions are accounted for. 
9.4 PARABOLIC EQUATIONS 
The one-dimensional diffusion equation,

U, = a Uxx 
(9.10) 
(to avoid confusion between K and k we write a 2 for the diffusivity) is used as a guide in developing 
finite-difference methods for parabolic POEs in general. For the grid (xn , tj) = (nh, jk), we shall state 
three commonly used difference equations for (9.10). All three are two-level equations whereby the 
solution, known at level j, is advanced to level j + l.

Theorem 9.7: The forward-difference method (9.15) has local truncation error O(k + h2); it is

Theorem 9.8: The backward-difference method (9.16) has local truncation error O(k + h2); it is

Theorem 9.9: The Crank- Nicolson method (9.17) has local truncation error O(e + h2); it is stable. 
As a class, the explicit methods enjoy the property of directly marching the solution forward in 
time, from one level to the next. They apply either to pure initial value problems or to initial-
boundary value problems, but suffer the drawback of conditional stability. On the other hand, the 
implicit methods, which are stable, require (in effect) a matrix inversion at each step forward in time. 
Thus, these methods are applicable only to initial-boundary value problems with a finite number of 
spatial grid points. 
For the one-dimensional implicit methods (9.12) and (9.13), the matrix to be inverted is 
tridiagonal; for the two-dimensional (9.16) and (9.17), pentadiagonal. Alternating-direction implicit 
(ADI) methods for parabolic problems in xl> x 2 ' ••• preserve the tridiagonal feature by fi rst solving a 
sequence of one-dimensional difference equations in Xl; then a sequence in x 2 ; and so on. Thus, if 
Dirichlet boundary conditions are specified for (9.14); if m = 0, 1, 2, ... , M; and if n = 0,1,2, .. . , N ; 
then we have (r == a 2k/h2) :

where t is some (possibly complex-valued) function of the real parameter {3. From this, by superposition,

(Strictly, the real part of the integral should be taken.) By a comparison with (6.17), (3) may be

Thus, at level j, the error amplitude corresponding to a given frequency {3127T is t({3)j. The Fourier-von 
Neumann rule, It I :5 J, amounts to the prescription that at no frequency should the error amplitude grow 
without limit as j -> 00.

Suppose that at time level j errors Enj are introduced at Xn 
(n = 1,2, ... , N - 1), perturbing the 
solution of (l) to V i + EJ, where E j is a column vector with nth component E ni . Then, using (1) to 
advance the solution, we have 
or 
or, after m steps, 
(2) 
Let AI, A2 , ... , AN-I and VI, V2 , ..• , VN- 1 be the eigenvalues and associated linearly independent 
eigenvectors of the symmetric matrix C. Writing Ej as a linear combination of the Vk , 
N-I 
Ej = 2: a kVk

and using (2 ) and CVk = Ak Vk , we see that

(3) 
Equation (3) shows that the errors Eni remain bounded if and only if IAkl:$ 1 for k = 1,2, ... , N - 1. By 
Problem 9.8, with p = (1 - 2r) and q = " 
Amax = (1 - 2,) + 12,1 = 1 
Amin = (1- 2,) - 12'1 = 1 - 4, 
which yields the condition 1 - 4r ;::: - 1, or r :$ 1/2. (This same condition is obtained when the exact 
expressions for the eigenvalues, from Problem 11.11, are employed.)

A stable (see Problem 9.20) overlapping-steps method is the DuFort- Frankel method,

Show that if k/ h is held constant as h, k ~ 0, then (9.19) is consistent with an equation of

show how to imbed the implicit method (9.12) and the Crank- Nicolson method (9.13 ) in a 
single algorithm. 
With 
(xn, Ii) = (nh, jk) (n = 0, 1, . . . , N; j = 0,1,2, . .. ; Nh = 1), 
let 
UnO = f(xn) 
(n = 1,2, ... , 
N - 1), Uoo = (f(0) + p(0)]/2, UNO = [1(1) + q(O)]!2; further, for j = 1,2, .. . , let UOj = P(ti), U Nj = q(tj). 
In the implicit and Crank-Nicolson methods a system of linear equati6 ns must be solved to advance the 
solution from Ii to li+l: it is not possible simply to march the solution forward as in the explicit method. 
The weighted-difference m ethod, 
U n,j+l - U nj = r[(l- w)8;U ni + w8; U n,i+d 
(9.20 ) 
reduces to (9.12) when w = 1 and to (9.13) when w = 0.5. Incorporating the boundary and initial 
conditions into (9.20), we find that the unknowns U 1.i+I, U 2,i+l, .. . , U N -l.j+l satisfy the following 
tridiagonal system:

approximate the solution of

Compare the numerical solution with the exact solution, u = l00e-z
.".2, sin TTX sin 'TTy, at t = 0.1. 
For a program, see Fig. 9-5. Though the symmetry of the solution was not exploited in constructing 
the program, the numerical results do display the expected symmetries. It therefore suffices to compare 
the numerica1 and exact solutions on 0 < Y $: x, 0 < x $: 1/2. See Fig. 9-6.

For a parabolic initial-boundary value problem, the method of lines consists in discretizing 
only the spatial variables to obtain a system of ordinary differential equations in t. Illustrate 
the method of lines by applying it to 
Take h = 0.25. 
u(x, 0) = f(x) 
u(O, t) = u(l, t) = 0 
O< x < 1, t > O 
0 < x < 1 
t>O 
(1) 
(2) 
(3) 
Let Xn = nh 
(n = 0, 1, 2,3,4) and let Vn(t) be an approximation to u(Xn, I). In (1) approximate u, 
by V ~(I) and Uxx by 8 ~ Vn(l ) to obtain the following system of ordinary differential equations. 
1 
VI = h 2 (-2VI + V 2 ) 
1 
V z= h 2 (V\-2V2 + V 3) 
(4) 
1 
V3 = h 2 (V2 - 2V3 ) 
If we look for solutions to the system (4) of the form Vn = ane Al
, we are led to the following eigenvalue 
problem in A: 
(5) 
By Problem 11.11, the eigenvalues A of (5) are 
Ak = h-2 (-2 + 2 
cos k;) 
(k=1,2,3) 
or A 1= -8 + 4V2, A2 = - 8, A3 = -8 - 4V2, with corresponding eigenvectors 
VI = [V2, 2, V2V 
The solution of (4) can be expressed as 
[VI(I), Vz(t), V3(1)]T = C I V I eAJI + C2 Vze A21 + C3 V3eA31 
(6) 
and all that remains is to set 1=0 and Vn(O) = I(xn) in (6) to obtain three linear equations for CI, C2, C3' 
In practice, the number of x-nodes is usually much larger than five, and the POE may have variable 
coefficients or may be nonlinear. In these circumstances it is desirable, or necessary, to obtain an 
approximate solution to the system of ordinary differential equations by a numerical method.

The local truncation errors given in Theorems 10.1 and 10.2 assume that u is four times continuou ly 
differentiable in x and t. 
Theorem 10.1: 
The explicit method (10.2) has local truncation error a(e+ h2); it is stable if and 
only if C2S 2 
$ 1. 
Theorem 10.2: 
The implicit method (10.3) has local truncation error a(e + h2); it is stable. 
In Problem 10.1 it is shown how initial c nditions are used to evaluate UnO and Un\> which are 
needed to start the calculations in either method. The sorts of problems to which the two methods 
properly apply are as in the parabolic case, assuming smooth solutions. For problems to which the 
solution is not smooth, the method of characteristics usually provides a more accurate numerical 
solution (see Section 10.2). 
The stability condition of Theorem 10.1 is often referred to as a Couranl- Friedrichs- Lewy (CFL) 
condition. The CFL condition for the stability of an explicit finite-difference method is that the 
numerical domain of dependence must contain the analytical domain of dependence. Thus, for (10.2 ) 
to be stable, the backward characteristics through (xn, tj+J must pass between (xn_p t) and (xn+P Ij).

characteristic, becomes a Cauchy problem for a first-order system of the same type when Ux and uy 
are taken as new dependent variables. Writing

we obtain from the theory of Chapter 5 (see also Section 10.4) the following basic results for (10.4):

The numerical method of characteristics begins with the selection of grid points Pj on r (Fig.

are replaced by difference quotients; e.g., 
The result, after cancellation of l1a and 11,8, is a system of five algebraic equations in the five 
unknowns x(O;), y(O), u(O) , ux(O), and uy(O;). In general, the system is nonlinear and must be 
solved by an iterative technique (see Problem 10.5). With the new grid points OJ located and with 
new starting values at hand, the transition can be made to the R j ; and so forth .

DIFFERENCE METHODS FOR HYPERBOLIC EQUATIONS 
[CHAP. 10 
In the event that a, b, and c in (10.4) are independent of u, an a priori integration of the ordinary 
differential equations (10.5) and (10.6 ) may be possible, yielding the characteristic curves and their 
points of intersection, the grid points. In that case, (10.7) and (10.8) may be dropped from the 
numerical algorithm. 
Only one of the equations (10.11) need figure in the numerical method of characteristics. In the 
case of a pure initial value problem, it is a good idea to check the solution obtained when (10.J1a) is 
used against that involving (lO.l1h). For an initial-boundary value problem, in calculations adjacent 
to a boundary, the choice of equations (10. 11) is dictated by the relative orientations of the boundary 
and the a- and f3-characteristics. See Problem 10.20. 
10.3 FIRST-ORDER EQUATIONS 
We start with the simple equation 
aux + u, = f 
(10.12) 
where a is a constant and f= f(x, t), because difference methods for (10.12) carryover directly to a 
hyperbolic system of m linear first-order equations in m functions of x and t. Letting (xn' ti ) = (nh, jk) 
and s == k/ h, we have

It should be noted that the unmodified centered-in-x method, with a simple forward difference in 
time, is always unstable. 
A three-level explicit method for (10.12) can be obtained by estimating both ux(xn, t) and 
u,(xn , t) by centered differences:

(10.17) 
Theorem 10.8: 
Wendroff's implicit method (10.17) has local truncation error O(e + h2); it is stable. 
WendroH's implicit method cannot be applied to a pure initial-value problem. However, for an 
initial- boundary value problem, (10.17) can be used in an explicit manner (see Problem 10.8), Each 
of the methods (10.13)-(10.17) can be modified to apply to the general quasilinear first-order POE 
in two independent variables. 
As is shown in Problem 10.4, the scalar conservation-law equation 
[F (u )L + u/ = 0 
(10.18) 
admits the 
Lax- WendroJf Method (Scalar) 
(10.19) 
Here, Fnj == F( Unj ), F~j == F'( Unj ). 
Theorem 10.9: 
The Lax-Wendroff method (10.19) has local truncation error O(e + h 2). 
The stability criterion for (10. 19 ) will depend on the function F; if F(u ) = au 
(a = const.), the 
method is stable if and only if Isal :$; 1. 
To avoid the calculation of F', several two-step modifications of (10.19 have been devised. For 
example, 
Un,i+1 = Uni -
s(F~j -
F~_l,j) 
(10.20) 
has the same local truncation error, O(e + h2), as (10.19 ) and reduces to (10.19) in the linear case 
F (u) = au. 
Next, con ider the hyperbolic system of M linear first-order equations 
Aux + u, = f 
(10.21 ) 
where A is a constant M x M matrix and 
By Section 5.2, all M eigenvalues of A are real. The scalar numerical methods (10.13)- (10.17 ) 

148 
DIFFERENCE METHODS FOR HYPERBOLIC EQUATIONS 
[CHAP. 10 
become vector numerical methods for (10.21 ) when a is replaced by A (and 1 ± sa by I ± sA), and Unj 
and Inj are replaced by 
(10.22) 
Theorems 10.4-10.8 hold for these vector methods if, in the statements, a is replaced by A, any 
eigenvalue of A. 
Similarly, the Lax- Wendroff method may be extended to handle the conservation-law system

(p,q=1,2, ... ,M) be the Jacobian matrix of the functions 
F., . .. , FM , and write

(10.24 ) 
The vector version of the two-step modification (10.20) avoids calculation of the Jacobian matrix. 
EXAMPLE 10.1 
For f = 0, the linear system (10.21) becomes the special case F(u) = Au of (10.23 ). In this case,

Problem 10.10 treats the stability of (10.25). 
The difference methods presented above, like those of Section 10.1, work best if the exact solution is 
smooth. If discontinuities are present, greater accuracy will be furnished by a numerical method of 
characteristics.

10.4 NUMERICAL METHOD OF CHARACTERISTICS FOR FIRST· ORDER SYSTEMS 
The numerical method of characteristics is applicable to initial value problems for either a single 
first-order equation or a hyperbolic system of first-order equations. 
First, consider the quasilinear PDE 
(b rf- O) 
(10.26) 
and suppose that u is given on the noncharacteristic initial curve f. Let Q be any fixed point on f and 
ri be the characteristic of (10.26) passing through Q [Fig. lO-2(a)]. By (4b) of Problem 5.3, 
b dx - a dy = 0 
and 
b du - c dy = 0 
along ri. Approximating dx, dy, and du by x (P ) - x( Q), yep) - y( Q), and u(P) - u( Q), we obtain a 
pair of algebraic equations, 
b[x(P) - x( Q)] - a[y(P) - y( Q)] = 0 
b[ u(P) - u( Q )] - c[y(P) - y( Q)] = 0 
(10.27) 
(10.28) 
After one of the coordinates, x(P) or yep), of P has been selected, this system determines the other 
coordinate of P and the value of u at P. The system (10.27)-(10.28) is linear only if (10.26) is linear with 
constant coefficien ts.

Next, consider the 2 x 2 quasilinear hyperbolic system 
Aux + Buy = c 
(det (B) r! 0) 
(10.29) 
with u = [u, vf given on f. Using the theory of Chapter 5 (see especially Problem 5.12) to transform 
from the variables x, y to characteristic coordinates a, [3, we obtain the canonical equations for 
(10.29): 
xa = AlYa 
x{3 = A2Y{3 
b~lua + b~2V" = cT y" 
b21 U{3 + b~v{3 = c;Y/3 
where Al and A2 are the (by assumption, real) zeros of det (A- AB) and where the starred coefficients 
are known functions of x, y, U, v. Replacing the a- and [3-derivatives by difference quotients (per Fig. 
10-2(b» yields the following numerical method: 

150 
DIFFERENCE METHODS FOR HYPERBOLIC EQUATIONS 
x(P) - x(Q) = AJ[Y(P) - y(Q)] 
x(P) - x(R) = A2[Y(P) - y (R)] 
b~J [u(P) - u(Q)] + b~2[V (P) - v(Q)] = c7[y(P)- yeo)] 
b;Ju(P) - u(R )] + b;2f v(P ) - vCR)] = c;[y(P) - y(R )] 
[CHAP. 10 
(10.30) 
(10.31 ) 
(10.32) 
(10.33 ) 
In general, the algebraic system (10.30)-(10.33) must be solved for the unknown x(P), yep), u(P), 
and v(P) by an iterative procedure. 
Solved Problems 
10.1 
Given the initial conditions u(x, 0) = I(x) and u,(x, 0) = g(x) for the wave equation (10.1), 
show how to obtain starting values UnO and U nJ for the difference methods (10.2) and (10.3). 
The guiding principle here is that the starting values should represent the initial data with an error no 
worse than the local truncation e"Or 01 the difference method, which in the present case is O(e + h 2 ). 
Obviously, then, we take U"o = I(x,,), as this incurs error zero. 
To decide on U,,!, Jet us suppose that f is in C 2 and that (10.1 ) hol.ds at t = O. Then Taylor's 
theorem gives 
where, in the last step, f'(x,,) has been approximated through a second difference, according to (9.3). 
From (1) it is seen that the relation 
U"l- U"O 
kc
2 
g(x,,) = 
k 
- 2h2 (f(X"-l) - 2f(x,,) + f(Xn+l)] 
(2) 
is satisfied by the exact solution u to within O(kh2 + e); i.e., letting (2) determine U" I results in an error 
of higher order than O(k 2 + h 2). 
~ 
10.2 
Write a computer program that uses the explicit method (10.2), with starting values as in 
Problem 10.1, to approximate the solution to the initial- boundary value problem 
u,, - 4uu = 0 
u(x, 0) = sin 21TX 
u( x, 0) = 0 
u(O, t) = u(l, t) = 0 
O<x < 1, t > O 
O< x< l 
O< x< l 
t > O 
At t = 1 compare the numerical results with the exact solution, u = cos 41Tt sin 2 1TX. 
Figure 10-3 gives a program listing, and Fig. 10-4 shows two runs, one stable and one unstable.

ux(Q) = 1 
u(Q ) = 1 
y(Q) = 0 
uy{Q) = 2 
u(R ) = 1.2

ux(R ) = 1 
u,(R) = 2

Putting the above values in (6)- (10) of Problem 10.5, we obtain

Use the linear Lax- Wendroft method (10.25) (1 x 1 version) to approximate the solution to 
Ux + u, = 0 
u(x, 0) = 2+ x 
u(O, t) = 2 - t 
x > 0, t >O 
x>O 
t > O 
At t = 0.5, for 0 s; x s; 1, compare the numerical solution with the exact solution, U = 2 + x - t. 
A program listing is given in Fig. 10-7, and the results of a stable run and an unstable run are 
displayed in Fig. 10-8. T he exact agreement in the stable run is explained by noting that the analytical 
solution is linear in x and t, and therefore the local truncation error is zero. Thus, the only errors in the 
calculation are rounding errors. The unstable run illustrates the growth of these errors even in the 
absence of any truncation errors.

Apply Wendroff's implicit method (10.17) to the initial- boundary value problem of Problem 
10.7 with s = 2.00, the case in which the Lax-Wendroff method proved to be unstable. 
See Figs. 10-9 and 10-10. As expected, this stable method produces the exact solution. Notice that 
even though the differen ce method is implicit, the calculations in the program proceed from left to right 
in x, in an explicit manner.

10.10 Show that a necessary condition for the linear Lax-Wendroff method (10.25) to be stable is 
that Is'\ I:5 1 for each of the eigenvalues A of the matrix A. 
Making a von Neumann analysis (see Problem 9.5), we substitute 
in (10.25), obtaining [et\ ... , t~ l lT = G[tL . .. ,t~r, where 
G == I - (is sin f3)A - (2S2 sin2~) A2 
(1) 
For stability, all eigenvalues J.L of the amplification matrix G must satisfy IJ.L 1:5 1. But the eigenvalues 
of the matrix polynomial (1) are the values of the polynomial at the eigenvaJues ,\ of A: 
J.L = 1- (is sin f3)A - (2S2 sin2~) ,\ 2 
(2) 
From (2), since ,\ is real, 
1J.L12 = [1- (2s2sin2~) ,\2r + [(s sin fi),\ ]2 
= 1 - (4sin4 ~) p(1 - p) 
(p ==S2,\2)

It is clear from (3) that IJ.L 12:5 1 for all /3 only if 0:5 p :5 1; i.e., only if Is,\ 1:5 1. This condition is (it can be 
shown) also sufficient for stability.

determined by solving

[u(Po) - 1] + 2u( Q ? y(P) = 0 
to obtain x(Po) = 1 + yep), u(Po) = 1 - 2y(P). Now successive approximations can be defined by solving

Difference Methods for 
Elliptic Equations 
11.1 
LINEAR ALGEBRAIC EQUATIONS 
In a linear elliptic boundary value problem, if all derivatives are replaced by their corresponding 
difference quotients, a system of linear algebraic equations results. 
EXAMPLE 11.1 
On the square n: 0 < x < t, 0 < Y < t, consider the Dirichlet problem for Poisson's equation, 
uxx + Uyy = f(x, y) 
u= g (x,y) 
Choosing a mesh spacing h = t/4, define on n the grid points 
in n 
on S 
(xm , Yn) = (mh, nh) 
(m, n == 0, 1,2, 3,4) 
Using central differences to approximate U xx and Uyy, one obtains the difference equation 
where f mn == f(xm , Yn), and the boundary values are V mn = g mn for m or n equal to 0 or 4. 
(11.1) 
(11.2) 
(11.3) 
A system like (11.3) is more clearly displayed as a system of linear equations if the grid points are labeled by a 
single index. Thus, if the interior nodes are ordered left-to-right and bottom-to-top, as in Fig. 11-1, then we can write 
Vll == V" V2I == V 2 , . . • , and can reindex f similarly. With this indexing, multiplication of (11.3) by _h 2 produces 
the following nine linear equations in the nine unknowns Vi :

By the scheme of Example 11.1 the difference equations for the general, two-dimensional, linear, 
elliptic boundary value problem (see Problem 11.7) can be put in the form 
AU = B 
(11.4 ) 
The following remarks are pertinent to the general problem. 
(1) The dimension of the vectors U and B is equal to the number of nodes at which the solution 
is to be approximated. 
(2) The vector B is determined by the boundary conditions and the u-independent terms in the 
PDE. 
(3) 
The matrix A is square and contains at most five nonzero entries per row. With fl fixed, the 
order of A, given in (1) above, is a certain decreasing function of the mesh spacing h. Thus,

even if the entries of A do not involve h, the eigenvalues of A-and those of various 
iteration matrices to be derived from A-will be functions of h. 
(4) 
Provided the boundary value problem has a unique solution and h is sufficiently small, A is 
nonsingular, so that the system (11.4) has exactly one solution. 
1l.2 DIRECT SOLUTION OF LINEAR EQVA TIONS 
A method for solving (11.4) is calIed a direct method if it produces the exact solution to (11.4) 
(up to rounding errors) by a finite number of algebraic operations. Gaussian elimination is an 
example of a direct method. Direct methods are generally restricted to problems such that (11.4) can 
be accommodated in the central memory of the available computer. 
If (11.4) is to be solved for a given nonsingular matrix A and several vectors B, the LU-
decomposition method is more economical than Gaussian elimination. This method is based on a 
factorization of A of the form A = LV, where L is a lower-triangular matrix and V is an upper-
triangular matrix (see Problem 11.8). 
The matrix A is usually sparse (most entries are zero), banded (some set of contiguous diagonals 
contains all the nonzero entries), symmetric, and/or block tridiagonal; efficient direct methods exploit 
any such special properties. 
11.3 ITERATIVE SOLUTION OF LINEAR EQUATIONS 
Iterative methods (or indirect methods ) generate a sequence of approximations to the solution of a 
system of alg braic equations. In contrast to direct methods, they do not produce the exact solution 
to the system in a finite number of algebraic operations. Iterative methods generally require less 
computer storage and are easier to program than direct methods. 
In most linear algebra and numerical analysis literature, iterative methods are stated for a system 
of equations in single-index form; e.g., (11.4). In computational applications we shall find it easier to 
use multiple indices to identify the unknowns; single indexing will be employed only in discussions of 
the convergence of iterative methods. 
The iterative methods, which below are stated for (11.1 )-(11.2), extend to the general, linear, 
elliptic boundary value problem.

Some properties of these methods, in the present application, follow. 
(1) The boundary condition (11.2) is accounted for by setting U~n = gmn at all boundary nodes, 
for k = 0, 1,2, .... 
(2) 
In all three methods the initial estimate, U~n' can be chosen arbitrarily and, as k ~ co, the U;nn 
will converge to the solution of the difference equations. 
(3) 
Fmn is determined by the right-hand side of the PDE (11.1): Fmn = -h
2fmn' 
(4) If (11.1) is Laplace's equation (f = 0), Jacobi's method consists in successively replacing the 
U-value at a node by the average of the U-values at the four neighboring nodes. 
(5) Jacobi's method is independent of the order in which the nodes are scanned. 
(6) The Gauss-Seidel and SOR methods are stated here for a scanning of nodes in the 
numerical order of Fig. 11-1. If the nodes are scanned in a different order, (11.6) and (11.7) 
must be modified. 
(7) The Gauss-Seidel method differs from the Jacobi method only in that new information 
about U is used as soon as it becomes available. 
(8) The SOR method takes note of the direction in which the G auss-Seidel iterates are 
proceeding and (for w > 1) extrapolates in that direction in an effort to accelerate con-
vergence. 
(9) 
In (11.7), w is called the relaxation parameter; the method is characterized as under-
relaxation or ove"elaxation according as 0 < w < 1 or 1 < w < 2. With w = 1, the SO R 
method reduces to the Gauss-Seidel method. 
The methods (11.5), (11.6), (11. 7) are point iterative methods because they update U one grid 
point at a time. Improved convergence rates can be obtained by using block iterative methods which 
update U at several grid points simultaneously. This improved convergence is gained at the expense 
of having to solve a system of linear equations each time a block of nodes is updated. In most block 
iterative methods the calculations are arranged so that the linear system is tridiagonal and therefo re 
easy to solve. For instance, choosing as the block the horizontal line of nodes n = const., we obtain 
the following row iterative counterparts of (11.5), (11.6), (11.7):

Column iteration methods similar to (11.8), (11.9 ), (11.10) are also available (see Problem 
11.24). By alternating row and column iterations a variety of ADI methods can be devised (ct. 
Section 9.4). 
11.4 CONVERGENCE OF POINT ITERATIVE METHODS 
To investigate the convergence of (11.5), (11.6), (11.7), suppose the difference equation (11.3) 
written in singly indexed form (11.4 ). Next, write the coefficient matrix A as A = - L + D - V, where L, D, 
and U are, respectively, strictly lower triangular (zeros on the main diagonal), diagonal, and strictly upper 
triangular matrices. Assume that det (D) .,e O. 
EXAMPLE 11.2 For the matrix A of Example 11.1, D is the 9 x 9 diagonal matrix with 4s along the main 
diagonal; L is the 9 x 9 matrix with I s along the third subdiagonal, the pattern two Is, 0, two Is, 0, .. . along the first 
subdiagonal, and zeros elsewhere; and U = LT. 
Methods (11.5), (11.6 ), (11.7) can be expressed in matrix form as follows: 
Jacobi Point Iteration 
Gauss-Seidel Point Iteration 
(Tc == (D- L)-IU, 
Cc == (D- L)-IB) 
SOR Point Iteration 
Theorem 11.1: 
10 (11.11 ), (11.12 ), or (11.13), if {Uk} converges to U *, then AU* = B. 
As in Section 9.3, let the spectral radius of a square matrix T be denoted peT ). 
(11.11 ) 
(11.12 ) 
(11.13 ) 
Theorem 11.2: The sequence {Uk} defined by uk+ I = TUk + C, with UO arbitrary, converges to a 
unique vector, U*, independent of 00, if and only if peT) < l. 
Theorem 11.3 (Stein- R osenberg): If, for the matrix A of (11.4), aij $ 0 for i.,e j and aii > 0, then 
exactly one of the following statements holds: 
(1) O< p(Tc )< p(T,)<l 
(2) 
1 < p(T,) < p(T c) 
(3) 
peT,) = peTe ) = 0 
(4) p(T,)= p(Te )=l 
Theorem 11.4: 
For the system AU = B if (i) a j} $ 0 for i .,e j and a ij > 0, 
(ii) aii ~ L lai}1 
with strict inequality for some i 
} 
} " i 
and (iii) a change in any component of B affects every component of U, then both 
the Jacobi and the Gauss-Seidel point iterative methods converge (conclusion (1) or 
(3) of Theorem 11.3). 
Theorem 11.5: For the system AU = B with au .,e 0, a necessary condition for the convergence of the 
SOR point iterative method is 0 < OJ < 2. If peT,) < 1, the condition is also sufficient.

u.s CONVERGENCE RATES 
Let U* represent the exact solution to AU = B and let Uk represent an approximation to U* 
obtained by k applications of an iterative method 
Uk = TUk - J + C 
(11.14) 
The residual vector, Rk == B - AUk, is a measure of the amount by which Uk fails to satisfy the system 
AU = B, if Uk = U*, then Rk = O. The maximum residual after k applications of (11.14) is the 
maximum of the magnitudes of the components of Rk. 
The convergence rate of (11.14 ) is defined to be -loglO peT), where peT) is the spectral radius of 
the iteration matrix. For large k the reciprocal of the convergence rate is roughly the number of 
further iterations of (11.14 ) required to reduce the maximum residual by a factor of ten. For a square 
mesh, the asymptotic convergence rate is the dominant term in the convergence rate as the mesh 
spacing approaches zero (cL remark (3) of Section 11.1). 
To compare the convergence rates of the three point-iterative methods, some way of relating 
peT,), p(To ), and p(Tw) is needed. This relationship is given in Theorem 11.6, which involves two 
new notions. 
Definition: 
Matrix A is 2-cyclic if there exists a permutation matrix P such that 
T [OJ F] 
PAP = 
G 
D2 
where 0 , and O2 are square diagonal matrices. 
Definition: 
The 2-cyclic matrix A=-L+ D -U is consistently ordered if det(-.8L+aO- .8-
1U) is 
independent of the scalar .8. 
Theorem 11.6: If A is 2-cyclic and consistently ordered, then the eigenvalues p, of T J and the 
eigenvalues A of T w satisfy 
. 
(A + w - 1/ = AW 2p, 2 
(W ;i 0, A ;i 0) 
(11.15) 
Since To = Tw when w = 1, (11.15) relates the eigenvalues of T J to the eigenvalues of both To and T w'

The relationship (11.15 ) can be used to find the value of the relaxation parameter, lV, which maximizes

Solved Problems 
11.1 
Determine the truncation error associated with using centered differences to approximate the 
Laplacian operator, Uxx + uYY' on a rectangular grid, (xm' Yn) = (mh, nk). 
By (9.3), 
provided Ux.ux and Uyyyy are bounded. 
If a solution to a boundary value problem for Poisson's equation has identically zero fourth 
derivatives, e.g., u = xy, then the exact solution to the difference equation gives the exact solution to the 
boundary value problem. Such solutions are valuable when comparing different numerical methods. 
11.2 
Formulate difference equations with truncation error O (h 2), together with discrete boundary 
conditions, for the Neumann problem 
Uxx + Uyy = f(x, y) 
au 
an = g(x,y) 
in 0 
on S 
(1) 
(2 ) 
where 0 is the rectangle 0 < x < a, 0 < Y < b. Choose grid points (mh, nh) such that Mh = a, 
Nh= b. 
By (11.3) and Problem 11.1, (1) can be approximated with truncation error O(h 2) by 
- U m-I.n - U m.n-I + 4U mn - U m+l.n - U m,n+1 = - h 2fmn 
(3) 
in which m = 0, 1, ... , M and n = 0, 1, ... , N. Note the tacit assumption that f is also defined on S. 
To approximate au/an by a centered difference requires the introduction of ghost points (open dots 
in Fig. 11-2). At those grid points on S that are not corner points, the boundary conditions are: 
U M+I .n - U M-I.n = 2h gMn 
U m,N+I - U m.N- l = 2h gmN 
U -I,n -
U In = 2h gOn 
U m.- 1 - Uml=2hgmo 
(n = 1,2, ... , N - 1) 
(m = 1,2, ... , M - 1) 
(n = 1, 2, ... ,N - 1) 
(m = 1,2, . .. , M - 1) 
(4) 
(5) 
(6) 
(7) 
At a corner grid point, where n is undefined, let us take as the "normal derivative" the average of the 
two derivatives along the two outer normals to the sides meeting at the corner. This leads to the final 
four boundary conditions

Since the entries in each row of A sum to zero, the vector C == [I, }, ... , }f satisfies AC = o. Thus, 
the system AU = 0 has a solution besides the zero solution, and so the matrix A is singular. In 
consequence, the numerical Neumann problem AU = 8 may have no solution, or it may have an 
infinite number of solutions of the form U = U* + aC. In the latter event, U is determined at each 
grid point only up to the additive constant a.

Once a system A V = B has been expressed in the form LUV = B, show how it can be solved 
for V by a forward substitution followed by a backward substitution. 
In the system LUV = B, let W = UV. Then AV = B can be written L W = B, or

For the solution of a single linear system, the work required in an LU-decomposition is the same as 
that required in straightforward Gaussian elimination . One attractive feature of the LU-decomposition 
approach is that once Land U have been found for a given A, it is possible to solve AV = B for any and 
all right-hand sides B just by using the forward-backward substitution method outlined above.

The largest in magnitude of these eigenvalues is /-L1l; hence, p(TJ) = \/2/2. 
II.1S For the system of Example 11.1, wTite the Jacobi row iteration method, (11.8), in matrix form 
and determine the spectral radius of the resulting iteration matrix, T . 
By Problem 11.10, the system can be represented as 
where Vi = [V i, Ui+l , Ui+ZV and Ci = [B;, Bi+I, Bi+zV for i = 1,4,7. Let 
L{ ::] D-[: : ~] 
U ~ [: : n 
where D is invertible (because H is invertible). Then (1) may be written 
(-L+ D - U)V=c 
or 
where V = [vi, vI, vlY = U and c = [cT, cr, clY = B. 
The second equation (2) is equivalent to the fixed-point iteration 
V k + l = D- l(L + U)Vk + D - lc 
and (3 ) is identical to (11.8). In fact, since 
(3) yields

V~+1 = H-IV~ + ... 
V~+1 = H-l(V~ + v~)+'" 
V~+1 = H -IV~ + ...

To determine the eigenvalues /-L of T, let w be an eigenvector of H corresponding to the eigenvalue 
Ak and look for eigenvectors of T of the form V = [alw T, a 4wT, a7wT]T. TV = /-L V implies (L + U)V = 
/-LDV, or 
Since w 'i- 0, we now have

a lW + a7W = a4/-L Hw = /-LAka 4W

rate of the SOR method as against the Gauss-Seidel method becomes even more striking. It is seen that 
the numerical results are not in very good agreement with the analytical solution. To improve the 
numerical solu tion one might (i) drive the maximum residual below a smaller tolerance, or (ii) use a finer 
me h. An analysis of the truncation error (see Problem 11.1) shows it to be the villain here: to improve 
the accuracy, a finer mesh is needed.

12.1 
INTRODUCTION 
In certain cases, the solution of a boundary value problem for a POE is also a solution of an 
associated c31culus of variations problem. A typical problem in the calculus of variations is to find, 
for functions u belonging to a prescribed set d, the extreme values of the integral expression 
J[u(x)] = J F(x, u(x), Vu(x» dO 
n 
where F denotes a given function. Hence we shalI begin by describing some of the structure of the 
domain d of J. 
12.2 THE FUNCTION SPACE e(O) 
In Chapter 6 we considered the space L2(a, b) of functions f(x) that are defined and square 
integrable on (a, b) in RI. More generally, let 0 denote a bounded region in R n and consider the set 
L2(0) of all real-valued functions u(x) defined on 0 which satisfy 
J u(xfdO< oo 
n 
Like L2(a, b), L2(0) is a vector space over the real numbers, and the expected definition 
makes it an inner product space. 
(u, v) == J u(x)v(x) dO 
n 
A subset of L\O) is said to be a subspace of e(O) if the subset is closed under the operation of 
forming linear combinations. 
EXAMPLE 12.1 
(a) For k a nonnegative integer, the subset Ck(n) of all u in e (fl) which, together with all 
derivatives of order k or less, are continuous on n is a subspace of L2(O). (b) Let U \, •.. , UN denote N elements 
of L2(O). The subset .it of all linear combinations of U\ , ... , UN is a subspace of L2(O)-the subspace spanned 
by the Ui. (c) For m a positive integer, the subset H m(o) of all u in L2(O) whose derivatives of order m or 
less are also in L2(O) is a subspace of e(O). 
A subspace At of L2(fl) is dense in L\O) if for any € > 0 and any f in L2(0) there exists a v in At 
such that 
Ilv - fl12 == J (v - 1)2 dO < € 
n 
i.e., if any f in e(O) can be approximated with arbitrary precision in the least-squares sense by a 
function from At. 
Theorem 12.1: 
For each positive integer m, the following subspaces are dense in e (O): em (n), 
H m (0), and the set of all u in e m (fi) such that u = 0 on S, the boundary of O . 
Theorem 12.2: If At is a dense subspace in L\fl) and if an element u of L2(0 ) satisfies (14, v ) = 0 for 
311 v in At, then u = o.

12.3 THE CALCULUS OF VARIATIONS 
A real-valued function J whose domain of definition is a subset of L2(O) will be called a 
functional. The fundamental problem of the calculus of variations is, then, to find the extreme values \ 
of a given functional J over a specified domain d in L2(O). 
EXAMPLE 12.2 (a) For 0 a bounded set in R2 having smooth boundary S and for given functions fin C(O) 
and g in C(S), let sti == {u(x, y) in H l(O) : u = g on S}. Minimize 
J[u] = t (u~ + u; - 2fu) dx dy 
over sti. (b) For 0 a bounded set in R" with smooth boundary S and for given functions aij (x) and f(x) in C(O), 
let A == {u in Hl(O) : u = 0 on S}. Minimize 
f ("au au 
) 
Jfu] = 
2, aij --- 2fu dO 
n 
i.i - l 
aXi aXi 
Such problems can be treated in much the same way as extreme-value problems in elementary 
calculus, if the notion of the derivative is suitably generalized. 
Variation of a Functional 
First, we associate with the domain d of the functional J, a set .Ai of comparison functions such 
that, for any u in d and any v in .Ai, u + EV belongs to d for every real number E • .Ai is necessarily a 
subspace of L2(O). 
EXAMPLE 12.3 (a) For sti as in Example 12.2(a), we may take oM == {v in Hl(O) : v = 0 on S}. (b) For sti as in 
Example 12.2(b), we may take AI- to be identical to sti. In general, whenever sti is a subspace of L2(O) and not 
just a subset as in the first example, we may take oM == sti (for u, v in sti, the linear combination u + EV is also in 
sti). 
For J a functional on domain d, to which corresponds a set of comparison functions .Ai, let u 
belong to d and v belong to .Ai. Then 
(12.1 ) 
is a real-valued function of the real variable E. 
Definition: If the limit 
) 
J[ u + EV] - J[ u] 
4>'(0 = lim ----~-'-
(12.2) 
E-O 
€ 
exists for every v in.Ai (the value of the limit will generally depend on the "direction" v), we 
write 
4>'(0)= SJ[u; v] 
and call this the variation of J at u (in the direction v). 
Theorem 12.3: Let J denote a functional on domain d with associated set of comparison functions 
.Ai, and suppose that Uo in d is a local extreme point for J. If J has a variation at uo, 
it must vanish; i.e., 
for all v in .Ai 
Gradient of a Functional 
Theorem 12.3 shows that the variation of a functional J is analogous to the directional derivative 
of a function on Rn, which is obtained by computing the scalar product of the gradient of the function 

190 
VARIATIONAL FORMULATION OF BOUNDARY VALUE PROBLEMS 
[CHAP. 12 
with a unit vector in the given direction. Under certain conditions, we can define what is meant by 
"the gradient of a functional." 
Consider functional J with domain d contained in e (fl). Suppose that the comparison functions 
comprise a dense subspace At of L
2(fl). Finally, let (!lJ consist of all u in d such that J has a variation 
at U and, moreover, such that there exists a G in L2(fl) having the property 
M[u; vJ = (G, v) 
for all v in At 
If 0J is nonempty, we call the funct ion G the gradient of J at u, and write G = V J[ u] ; the subset 0J of 
d is called the domain of the gradient. 
If Uo in 0J furnishes a local extremum for I, Theorem 12.3 and the definition of the gradient of J 
imply that (V J[ uo], v) = 0 for all v in At. But At is dense in L2(fl), and so, by Theorem 12.2, 
V J[ uo] == O. We can, in fact, prove 
Theorem 12.4: If the subspace At of comparison functions is dense in L2(fl) and if Uo in d is a local 
extreme point for 1, then Uo necessarily belongs to 0J and 
(the Euler equation for J). 
The point of Theorem 12.4 is that to solve a POE which is the Euler equation of a suitably 
constructed functional I, subject to whatever boundary conditions are part of the definition of the 
domain 0J, it is sufficient to minimize I over the class d of admissible functions. As the smoothness 
conditions incorporated into the definition of (!lJ appear to be weaker than what is required for a 
classical solution, the solution of the variational problem is considered to be a generalized solution of 
the bo undary value problem. In Section 12.5 we shall develop an even broader notion of the solution 
of a boundary value problem. 
12.4 V ARIA TIONAL PRINCIPLES FOR 
EIGENV ALVES AND EIGENFUNCTIONS 
Consider the Sturm-Liouville problem (6.13), with C2 = C4 = O. Theorem 6.4 describes the 
eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of this problem. Define 
d o={4> in HI(a, b): 4>(a) = 4>(b) = O}

The functional (12.4 ) is called the Rayleigh quotient of the Sturm- Liouville problem (6.13), whose 
eigenvalues are characterized by the minimum principles (12.5) and (12.7).

(12.9) 
where p(x) > 0, q(x), and r(x) > 0 are all in Cl(fi). As in the case of the one-dimensional Sturm-
Liouville problem, all eigenvalues of (12.8)-(12.9) are real and can be arranged in a countably 
infinite, increasing sequence. Moreover, weighted eigenfunctions r1!2u belonging to distinct eigen-
values are orthogonal; i.e.,

12.7(b» that the minima in (12.10) and (12.13) are assumed at the eigenfunctions; i.e., Ax = 
1[uk ] 
(k = 1,2, ... ). 
Mini,mum principles analogous to (12.10) and (12.13) hold when the differential operator in 
(12.8) is replaced by a general linear, elliptic, differential operator. 
12.5 WEAK SOLUTIONS OF BOUNDARY VALUE PROBLEMS -
Let 11 denote a bounded region in RZ with smooth boundary 5 consisting of complementary arcs 
51 and 5z· Let p, q, J, gp g2 denote given functions which are defined and smooth on 11 and/or on S.

Definition: 
A weak solution of (12.16)-(12.18 ) is any function u(x, y ) that belongs to d and 
satisfies (12.21). 
A notion of weak solution has already been encountered in Problem 5.15. Evidently, every 
classical solution of the boundary value problem is a weak solution. However, a weak solution u 
need not be a classical solution: it need only be sufficiently regular to allow definition of K[u, v] for 
all v in ..Ii. 
In the special (s If-adjoint) case that p and q in (12.15) vanish on 0, [i.e., when (12.16) is Poisson's 
equation], then 
Klu, vJ = Klv, uJ 
for all u, v in At 
K[u, u];:::O 
for all u in At 
Whenever (12.24) holds, it follows that for u in d , v in At, 
2{K[u, v]- F[ v]} = 8J[u; vJ 
where 
J[u ] "'" K[u, u]- 2 F[u ] 
(12.24) 
(12.25) 
(12.26) 
If Uo is a weak solution of tbe boundary value problem (for Poisson's equation), it follows from 
(12.25) that Uo is a stationary point for J. In fact, it can be shown that Uo minimizes J over d, which 
leads to 
Theorem 12.5: 
Let K[u, v ] satisfy (12.24 ) and let J[u] be given by (12.26). Then Uo minimizes J 
over d if and only if K[ uo' v] = F [ v] for aJl v in .At. 
According to Theorem 12.5, the weak formulation of a boundary value problem is, provided 
(12.24) holds, the same thing as the variational formulation guaranteed by Theorem 12.4. However, 
when (12.24) does not hold, only the weak formulation is possible. Thus, the notion of a weak 
solution to a boundary value problem is mOre comprehensive than that of a variational solution, 
which in turn is more comprehensive than the notion of a classical solution.

For each functional of Problem 12.1, find 9.0 and V J[ u]. 
Again it suffices to treat 13 and then to specialize the results to the other two functionals. Applying

This problem illustrates further the relation between .s4 and .QI. Note that the admissible class .s4 of 
(0) is "between" the classes .s4 of Problems 12.3 and 12.4, in the sense that 
{u in H l(n ) : u = g on 5} C {u in H l(n) : u = g on 51 C 5} C {u in H I(n)} 
As usual, we may restrict attention initially to 13 • Since v = 0 on 51, we have, analogous to (1) of 
Problem 12.4,

(2) 
In the case of each functional, the definition (0) of .s4 specifies how u is to behave over the part 5\ 
of the boundary. Then the definition of.QI imposes a condition over the remainder of the boundary; this 
condition involves the normal derivative of u. Boundary conditions incorporated in the definition of .s4

conditions.

Consider the Sturm-Liouville problem (12.8)-(12.9) and let <PI' ... , <PN - 1 denote any N - 1 
elements of silO' as defined in (12. 11). Let gyN-l denote the following subspace of silo: 
gyN-l == {u in silo: <rl!2<pj' rl!2u ) = 0 (j = 1, ... , N - I)} 
For the Rayleigh quotient J of (12.12), write

Prove that C[ <PI' .. . , <PN- l ] 5: AN' with equality if <pp ... , <PN- 1 coincide with eigenfunctions of 
the Sturm-Liouville problem, corresponding to the first N - 1 eigenvalues. This result, the 
Courant minimax principle, implies that AN' the Nth eigenvalue of the Sturm- Liouville 
problem, can be characterized as the maximum over all subsets {<PI' ... , <PN - l } of silo of the 
minimum of J[u ] on gyN-I' 
To establish the desired inequality it will suffice to construct a function w in 2ON - I such that 
J[ w ] ~ AN. Write

Chapter 13 
Variational Approximation Methods 
This chapter presents some techniques for constructing approximate solutions to boundary value 
problems. These techniques are based on the ideas of Chapter 12 and differ markedly from the 
finite-difference methods of Chapters 9, 10, and 11. 
13.1 THE RAYLEIGH-RITZ PROCEDURE 
This approximation procedure is limited to boundary value problems admitting the variational 
formulation "Find u* in d such that functional ][u] is minimized over d by u*." It was seen in 
Chapter 12 that such boundary value problems arise in connection with self-adjoint elliptic PDEs. 
We suppose d to be some subset of L\O), where .0. denotes a bounded set in R
n with smooth 
boundary S consisting of complementary portions SI and S2. Specifically, we take d = 
{u in H1(.o.) : u = g on SI} for a given g in C(O); the associated subspace of comparison functions is 
taken as .At = {v in H 1(.o.) : v = 0 on SJ 
Let CPo denote an arbitrary function from d (e.g., ¢o = g) and let ¢ p ... , ¢N denote N linearly 
independent functions in .At. Then, 
N 
UN (X) == ¢o(X) + L Cj¢j(X) 
j = 1 
(13.1 ) 
belongs to d for all choices of the constants cp ... , cN ; we denote by d N the subset of d consisting 
of all such functions UN. Let u;. denote the function in d N that minimizes] over d N • It can be shown 
that u;. represents the best approximation, in the least-squares sense, from d N to the exact solution 
u*. This function u;. is called the Rayleigh-Ritz approximation to the solution of the boundary value 
problem. 
The minimization of ] over d N is tantamount to the minimization over all c in RN of the ordinary 
function 
N 
H(c 1, · ··, cN )==] [¢o+ L Cj¢j] 
) = 1 
The minimizing constants c7, c;, ... , C;' must satisfy 
(m = 1, . .. , N) 
which is a system of N equations in N unknowns. 
(13.2) 
The Rayleigh-Ritz procedure may also be applied to eigenvalue problems of the sort treated in 
Section 12.4. In any eigenvalue problem the boundary conditions are aU homogeneous. Hence, we 
take ¢o == 0 in (13.1) and minimize the Rayleigh quotient] over the subspace d N = .AtN . 
13.2 THE GALERKIN PROCEDURE 
This approximation method is employed when the boundary value problem admits only a weak 
formulation; e.g., in the case of a linear elliptic PDE containing odd-order derivatives. In the event 
that conditions (12.24) hold in the weak formulation, so that a variational formulation also exists, it 
can be shown (see Problem 13.4(b» that the Galerkin and Rayleigh-Ritz procedures coincide. 
Consider, then, a boundary value problem with the weak formulation "Find u* in d such that 
K[ u *, v] = F[ v] for all v in .At." Here we suppose that .0., S, d, and .At are as described in Section 
202

13.1. Let ifJp ... , ifJN den te N linearly independent trial functions in .At and let ifJo denote an 
arbitrary function in .sIl. As in the Rayleigh- Ritz procedure, we seek an approximation u ~ to the 
weak solution u* of the form (13.1). In addition, let 1/11' . .. ' I/IN denote N linearly independent 
weight functions in .At; these may or may not be the same as the trial functions. The Galerkin 
approximate solution is required to satisfy 
K[ u;', I/Ii ] = F[ I/Ii 1 
(j = 1, .. . , N )

This is a set of N equations in the N unknowns c r ' ... , c~.

This set of equations is inconsistent and has no solution. The system of (b) was obtained from this 
one by rounding off. Evidently, a careless application of the Rayleigh-Ritz procedure can lead to 
disastrous results. 
The functions l/J,(x) and l/J2(X) compose an independent set and yield the approximation 
ui(x) = 7.76l/Jb) + 1.02l/J2(X) 
Now, u!(x) turns out to be a less accurate approximate solution than U3(X), even though it satisfies 
the boundary conditions of the problem, whereas U3(X) does not. This illustrates a second 
undesirable feature of the Rayleigh-Ritz approximation procedure: the success of the method is 
determjned by the choice of trial functions. Unfortunately, there are no dependable a priori clues as

Chapter 14 
The Finite Element Method: 
An Introduction 
The success of the approximation methods presented in Chapter 13 is largely dependent on the 
selection of an effective collection of trial functions cf>j and/or weight functions !/Ij. If these functions 
are chosen from certain families of piecewise polynomials, called finite element spaces, the following 
advantages are realized: 
(i) 
It is possible to deal in a systematic fashion with regions n having curved boundaries of 
rather arbitrary shape. 
(ii) 
One can systematically estimate the accuracy of the approximate solution in terms of the 
adjustable parameters associated with the finite element family. 
(iii) The coefficient matrix and data vector for the system of algebraic equations defining the 
approximate solution can be efficiently generated by computer. 
14.1 FINITE ELEMENT SPACES IN ONE DIMENSION 
Suppose that the intervaJ [0, 1] is subdivided into N subintervals each of length h = liN. Let 
Xj = jh 
(j = 0, 1, ... , N ) denote the nodes in the interval [0, 1]. Then the finite element space 
denoted by Sh [k, r] shall consist of all functions cf>(x) defined on [0,1] such that (i) on each subintervaJ 
[xj> xj+1], cf>(x) is a polynomial of degree at most k; (ii) cf>(x) has r continuous derivatives on [0, 1], 
which is to say, cf> belongs to C'[O, 1]. 
If r = 0, cf> is continuous but not necessarily differentiable at nodes. If cf> is to be allowed to be 
discontinuous at nodes, we set r = -1. Evidently, Sh [k, r J is a finite-dimensional vector space (a 
subspace of L 2(0, 1» and so may be characterized by giving a basis; i.e., a linearly independent set 
of elements {cf» 
that spans the space. 
Modifications for the case of nonuniform grids are easily developed.

14.2 FINITE ELEMENT SPACES IN THE PLANE 
Let 0 denote a bounded region in the plane and suppose that 0 is decomposed into polygonal 
subregions 01' ... , ON' called finite elements. Let hj denote the length of the longest side in OJ and let 
h = max hj" Finally, let Oh denote the polygonal region that is the union of all the OJ" Note that if the 
boundary of 0 is curved, then Oh may not coincide with O. We will denote by Sh[k, r] the space of all 
functions 4>(x, y) which are defined on Oh and satisfy (i) on each OJ' 4>(x, y) is a polynomial in (x, y) 
of degree at most k; (ii) 4>(x, y) has r continuous derivatives with respect to both x and y in Oh. 
As in one dimension, a finite element space Sh [k, r] will be specified via a basis composed of 
elements 4>j (x, y) associated with the nodes of the decomposition; i.e., with the vertices of the 
polygons. 
Triangular Finite Elements 
Let 0 be decomposed into triangular subregions, 0 1, ... , ON' where no triangle has a vertex on 
the side of another triangle (a proper triangulation; see Fig. 14-4). Euler's polyhedral fonnula shows 
that any proper triangulation into N triangles will have M nodes (vertices), where 
N+5 
--s,Ms,N+2 
2 
Therefore, we expect Sh(k, r) to be approximately N-dimensional. 
(a) Proper triangulation 
(b) Improper triangulation. 
Fig. 14-4 
EXAMPLE 14.4 Let the nodes of a proper triangulation of U into N triangles be labeled Zl, . .. , ZM. Then a 
basis for Sh[1, 0], the piecewise linear functions on un, is provided by the family 4>l(X, y), . . . , 4>M(X, y) that is 
uniquely defined by the conditions 
(i) There exist constants A jk , B jk , Cjk such that 
for 1 :S j :S M, 1:s k :S N; i.e., each 4>j is piecewise linear on un. 
(ii) 
(1 :S i, j:S M) 
The finite element space of Example 14.4 provides functions that are continuous on 0 (strictly, 
on Oh) and have first-order derivatives that are square-integrable (but are generally discontinuous). 
These functions would be suitable for constructing approximations to the variational solution of a 

214 
THE FINITE ELEMENT METHOD: AN INTRODUCTION 
[CHAP. 14 
boundary value problem of order two. For higher-order boundary value problems, functions having a 
higher degree of smoothness are required. Functions that are continuous, have continuous first 
derivatives, and have square-integrable second derivatives, must at the least be piecewise cubic. Such 
functions may be generated in more than one way. 
EXAMPLE 14.5 Suppose that on each ilk the function ¢i (X, y) is of the form 
¢j (x, y) = A jk + Bjkx + CjkY + Djkx 2 + Ejkxy + F,.k y2 + GjkX3 + H,.dx2y + xy2) + Ijky3 
and, together with OX¢j and Oy¢,., is continuous at each node Zi. Since there are 3 nodes on each triangle ilk, we have 
3 x 3 conditions for determining the 9 un knowns A jk , ... , Ijk. The functions ¢" . .. , ¢M so determined 
con tilute a basis for Sh [3, 1]. 
Rectangular Finite Elements 
Retaining the notation of the preceding subsection, we have for any proper decomposition of n 
into rectangles (where "proper" is defined as in the case of triangles) 
N+3::s; M::s;2N+2 
EXAMPLE 14.6 A basis for the space of piecewise linear functions on il\ Sh[l, 0], is provided by the family of 
functions ¢,(X, y), ... , ¢M(X, y) defined by: 
(i) 
On each ilk (1:s: k :s: N), 
(1 :s: j :s: M) 
(ii) 
(1:s: i, j:s: M) 
In fact, conditions (i) and (ii) uniquely determine the ¢dx, y) as products ¢i(X)¢j(Y) of the one-dimensional 
" hat functions" of Example 14.2. See Problem 14.4. 
EXAMPLE 14.7 Consider the space Sh [3, 1] relative to the decomposition of il into rectangular subregions. A 
basis for the space is provided by the 2M functions 
(1 :s: k :s: M), where (Xi, yj) are the coordinates of vertex Zk and where the ¢m (x) and "'m (x) denote the piecewise 
cubic Hermite functions of one variable described in Example 14.3. 
14.3 THE FINITE ELEMENT METHOD 
When the solution of a boundary value problem is approximated by one of the techniques of 
Chapter 13 and when the trial functions are chosen from one of the finite element families, the 
approximation scheme is referred to as a finite element method. For problems in one dimension (i.e., 
for ordinary differential equations), finite element methods generally do not offer any advantage over 
finite difference methods. However, for certain problems in two or more dimensions, finite element 
methods provide distinct advantages over finite difference methods. On the other hand, the finite 
element approach requires complex, sophisticated computer programs for implementation, and the 
use of library software is to be recommended.

14.1 
Let </>0' </>1' . . . , </>N denote the hat functions of Sh[1, 0] defined on (0,1]. (a) Show that this is a 
family of N + 1 independent functions in Sh[1, 0] whose span is just Sh(l, 0]. (b) Describe the 
relation between u(x) in qo, 1] and U (x) in Sh[1, 0], where 
N 
U (x) == 2: u(x) </>j(x) 
j~O 
(a) If we write F(x) = Co<Po(X) + ... + CN<PN(X) and suppose that F(x) vanishes for every x, then we 
must have Co = Cl = .. . = CN = 0, since F(xj) = Ci 
(0:$ j:$ N). Thus the <pj are linearly in-
dependent. To see that the <Pi span 5h[I , 0], let v(x) be an arbitrary function in 5h[l, 0) and form 
the function 
N 
w(x) = 2: v(Xj)<pj(x) 
j <=< O 
Now W(Xk) = V(Xk) for each k, since <Pj(Xk) = 8jk. In addition, w(x) and v(x) are linear on each 
subinterval [Xk-l, Xk] and agree at the endpoints Xk-l and Xk. This implies that w(x) = v(x) on each 
subinterval and hence on all of [0, 1); i.e., the <Pi span 5 h[0, 1]. 
(b) For arbitrary u(x) in qo, 1], not necessarily in 5"[1,0], the function U(x) is the piecewise linear 
interpolating approximation to u(x); see Fig. 14-5.

Note that </>2(x, y) vanishes identically off of .0.1 and ~ . This is a result of condition (1). Because

linear function of x and y on each .o.k and hence 4>2 must be identically zero on .0.3 through .0.6. It follows 
from this that on each triangle .o.k there are just three of the 4>jk which are nonzero: 
Evidently, 4>jk is nonzero only if Zj is a vertex of .o.k. This leads to the following somewhat more efficient 
algorithm for generating the nonzero 4>ik.

foregoing would read if the decomposition were into rectangles, with different numbers in the x- and
