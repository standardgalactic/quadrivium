Preface
Preface
The Twelfth Edition of Electric Circuits represents a planned, incremen-
tal revision focusing on the Assessment Problems and the end-of-chapter  
Problems. The fundamental goals of the text are unchanged. These goals are:
• To build new concepts and ideas on concepts previously presented. 
This challenges students to see the explicit connections among the 
many circuit analysis tools and methods.
• To develop problem-solving skills that rely on a solid conceptual 
foundation. This challenges students to examine many different 
approaches to solving a problem before writing a single equation.
• To introduce realistic engineering experiences at every opportunity. 
This challenges students to develop the insights of a practicing engi-
neer and exposes them to practice of engineering.
Why This Edition?
The Twelfth Edition of Electric Circuits incorporates the following new and 
revised elements:
• End-of-chapter problems—Problem solving is fundamental to the 
study of circuit analysis. Having a wide variety of problems to assign 
and work is a key to success in any circuits course. Therefore, nearly 
all of the existing existing end-of-chapter problems were revised, and 
some new end-of-chapter problems were added. The only problems 
that were not altered are those asking you to derive or prove a par-
ticular result.
• Assessment Problems—After most subsections in a chapter, one or 
two assessment problems give you a chance to reflect on the new 
material and apply it to solve a problem. Every assessment problem is 
new to the Twelfth Edition and comes with answers to all parts of the 
problem posed. Many of the assessment problems have interactive 
video solutions available in Mastering, which guide you through the 
solution and ask you to participate in the problem-solving process.
• Mastering Engineering is an online tutorial and assessment pro-
gram that provides students with personalized feedback and 
hints and instructors with diagnostics to track students’ prog-
ress. With the Twelfth Edition, Mastering Engineering will offer 
new enhanced end-of-chapter problems with hints and feedback, 
Coaching Activities, and Adaptive Follow-Up assignments. Visit  
www.masteringengineering.com for more information.
• We have eliminated the Selected Answers appendix that has 
appeared in previous editions. Some instructors may not wish to 
assign  problems whose solutions are readily available to students at 
the back of the text. Since instructors have the complete solutions 
available to them, they are free to supply answers to select problems 
they assign if they wish. Providing the reader with answers to prob-
lems discourages them from checking their own answers using an 
alternate analysis technique or comparing their answers to known 
circuit behavior.

Hallmark Features
Analysis Methods
Students encountering circuit analysis for the first time can benefit from 
 step-by-step directions that lead them to a problem’s solution. These directions 
are compiled into a collection of analysis methods, and many of the examples 
in the text use these analysis methods. Some of the analysis methods that are 
used most often can be found inside the book’s covers for easy reference.
Chapter Problems
Users of Electric Circuits have consistently praised the breadth, depth, vari-
ety, and sheer number of Chapter Problems. In the Twelfth Edition, there 
are nearly 1200 end-of-chapter problems, organized at the end of each 
chapter by section.
Practical Perspectives
The Twelfth Edition continues using Practical Perspectives to introduce the 
chapter. They provide real-world circuit examples, taken from real-world 
devices. Every chapter begins by describing a practical application of the 
material that follows. After presenting that material, the chapter revisits 
the Practical Perspective, performing a quantitative circuit analysis using 
the newly introduced chapter material. End-of-chapter problems directly 
related to the Practical Perspective application are identified for easy 
reference. These problems provide additional opportunities for solving 
 real-world problems using the chapter material.
Assessment Problems
Each chapter begins with a set of chapter objectives. At key points in the 
chapter, you are asked to stop and assess your mastery of a particular 
objective by solving one or more assessment problems. The answers to the 
assessment problems are given at the conclusion of each problem, so you 
can check your work. If you can solve the assessment problems for a given 
objective, you have mastered that objective. The Student Study area of Mas-
tering includes interactive video solutions for many of the assessment prob-
lems. If you want more practice, several end-of-chapter problems that relate 
to the objective are suggested at the conclusion of the assessment problems.
Examples
Every chapter includes numeric examples illustrating the concepts pre-
sented in the text. There are nearly 200 examples in this text that apply a 
particular concept, often employ an Analysis Method, and exemplify good 
problem-solving skills.
Checking the Results of Analysis
You are encouraged to check analysis results to verify that they make sense. 
There are many different ways to check results and examples of these 
checks are included throughout the text, the assessment problems, and the 
end-of-chapter problems. Don’t rely on comparing your results with some 
known answer, and instead check your own answer by solving the problem 
in a different way or comparing your answer with known circuit behavior.
Fundamental Equations and Concepts
Throughout the text, you will see fundamental equations and concepts set apart 
from the main text. This is done to help you focus on some of the key principles 
in electric circuits and to help you navigate through the important topics.

Preface
Integration of Computer Tools
Computer tools can assist in the learning process by providing a visual rep-
resentation of a circuit’s behavior, validating a calculated solution, reducing 
the computational burden of more complex circuits, and iterating toward a 
desired solution using parameter variation. This computational support is 
often invaluable in the design process. The Twelfth Edition supports PSpice 
and Multisim, both popular computer tools for circuit simulation and anal-
ysis. Chapter problems suited for exploration with PSpice and Multisim are 
marked accordingly.
Design Emphasis
The Twelfth Edition emphasizes the design of circuits in many ways. First, 
many of the Practical Perspective discussions focus on the design aspects 
of the circuits. The accompanying Chapter Problems continue discussing 
design issues in these practical examples. Second, design-oriented Chapter 
Problems have been labeled explicitly, enabling students and instructors 
to identify those problems with a design focus. Third, identifying problems 
suited to PSpice or Multisim exploration suggests design opportunities 
using these software tools. Fourth, some problems in nearly every chapter 
ask you to choose realistic circuit component values in achieving a desired 
circuit design. Once such a problem has been analyzed, the student can 
build and test the circuit in a laboratory, comparing the analysis with the 
measured performance of the actual circuit.
Accuracy
All text and problems in the Twelfth Edition have undergone our strict hall-
mark accuracy checking process, to ensure the most error-free book possible.

Prerequisites
In writing the first 12 chapters of the text, we have assumed that the reader 
has taken a course in elementary differential and integral calculus. We have 
also assumed that the reader has had an introductory physics course, at 
either the high school or university level, that introduces the concepts of 
energy, power, electric charge, electric current, electric potential, and elec-
tromagnetic fields. In writing the final six chapters, we have assumed the 
student has had, or is enrolled in, an introductory course in differential 
equations.
Course Options
The text has been designed for use in a one-semester, two-semester, or a 
three-quarter sequence.
• Single-semester course: After covering Chapters  1–4 and Chap-
ters 6–10 (omitting Sections 7.7 and 8.5) the instructor can develop 
the desired emphasis by covering Chapter 5 (operational amplifiers), 
Chapter 11 (three-phase circuits), Chapters 13 and 14 (Laplace meth-
ods), or Chapter 18 (two-port circuits).
• Two-semester sequence: Assuming three lectures per week, cover the 
first nine chapters during the first semester, leaving Chapters 10–18 
for the second semester.
• Academic quarter schedule: Cover Chapters 1–6 in the first quarter, 
Chapters 7–12 in the second quarter, and Chapters 13–18 in the third 
quarter.

Preface
Note that the introduction to operational amplifier circuits in Chapter 5 can 
be omitted with minimal effect on the remaining material. If Chapter 5 is 
omitted, you should also omit Section 7.7, Section 8.5, Chapter 15, and those 
assessment problems and end-of-chapter problems that pertain to opera-
tional amplifiers.
There are several appendixes at the end of the book to help readers 
make effective use of their mathematical background. Appendix A presents 
several different methods for solving simultaneous linear equations; com-
plex numbers are reviewed in Appendix B; Appendix C contains additional 
material on magnetically coupled coils and ideal transformers; Appendix D 
contains a brief discussion of the decibel; Appendix E is dedicated to Bode 
diagrams; Appendix F is devoted to an abbreviated table of trigonometric 
identities that are useful in circuit analysis; and an abbreviated table of use-
ful integrals is given in Appendix G. Appendix H provides tables of com-
mon standard component values for resistors, inductors, and capacitors, to 
be used in solving many end-of-chapter problems.
Acknowledgments

thank the incredible Matt Walker, who served as the developmental editor 
on that project and made countless suggestions for improving both the con-
tent and the design. He was a great collaborator and I’m so very sorry for 
failing to catch this error before the Eleventh Edition was published.
There were many hard-working people behind the scenes at our pub-
lisher who deserve my thanks and gratitude for their efforts on behalf of 
the Twelfth Edition. A special shout-out to the amazing Rose Kernan, 
who has helped guide these revisions since the Seventh Edition, which 
first appeared in 2005. Rose is so easy to work with, does her very best 
to keep me on top of the production schedule, and is an endless source of 
encouragement. I would also like to thank Erin Ault, Erin Sullivan, Holly 
Stark, Sandra Rodriguez, and Scott Disanno at Pearson for their continued 
 support, encouragement, and hard work. I thank the staff at Integra Soft-
ware Solutions for their dedication and attention to detail in typesetting 
this text.
I am very grateful for the many instructors and students who have done 
formal reviews of the text or offered positive feedback and suggestions for 
improvement more informally. I am pleased to receive email from instruc-
tors and students who use the book, even when they are pointing out an 
error that I failed to catch in the review process. Thank you for taking the 
time to contact Pearson or me with your comments and suggestions. I use as 
many of them as possible to continue to improve the content, the pedagogy, 
and the presentation in this text. I am privileged to have the opportunity to 
impact the educational experience of the many thousands of future engi-

Circuit Variables
Electrical engineering is an exciting and challenging profession 
for anyone who has a genuine interest in, and aptitude for, applied 
science and mathematics. Electrical engineers play a dominant 
role in developing systems that change the way people live and 
work. Satellite communication links, cell phones, computers, 
televisions, diagnostic and surgical medical equipment, robots, 
and aircraft represent systems that define a modern  technological 
society. As an electrical engineer, you can participate in this 
ongoing technological revolution by improving and refining 
 existing systems and by discovering and developing new systems 
to meet the needs of our ever-changing society.
This text introduces you to electrical engineering using the 
analysis and design of linear circuits. We begin this chapter by 
presenting an overview of electrical engineering, some ideas 
about an engi neering point of view as it relates to circuit analy-
sis, and a review of the International System of Units. We then 
describe generally what circuit analysis entails. Next, we intro-
duce the concepts of voltage and current. We continue by discuss-
ing the ideal basic element and the need for a polarity reference 
system. We conclude the chapter by describing how current and 
voltage relate to power and energy.

CHAPTER OBJECTIVES

Practical Perspective
Balancing Power
One of the most important skills you will develop is the 
ability to check your answers for the circuits you design 
and analyze using the tools developed in this text. A com-
mon method used to check for valid answers is to calcu-
late the power in the circuit. The linear circuits we study 
have no net power, so the sum of the power associated 
with all circuit components must be zero. If the total 
power for the circuit is zero, we say that the power bal-
ances, but if the total power is not zero, we need to find 
the errors in our calculation.
As an example, we will consider a simple model 
for distributing electricity to a typical home. (Note that a 
more realistic model will be investigated in the Practical 
Perspective for Chapter 9.) The components labeled a and 
b represent the source of electrical power for the home. The 
components labeled c, d, and e represent the wires that 
carry the electrical current from the source to the devices 
in the home requiring electrical power. The components 
labeled f, g, and h represent lamps, televisions, hair dryers, 
refrigerators, and other devices that require power.
Once we have introduced the concepts of voltage, 
current, power, and energy, we will examine this circuit 
model in detail, and use a power balance to determine 
whether the results of analyzing this circuit are correct.

Circuit Variables
1.1 Electrical Engineering: An Overview
The electrical engineering profession focuses on systems that produce, 
transmit, and measure electric signals. Electrical engineering combines the 
physicist’s models of natural phenomena with the mathematician’s tools for 
manipulating those models to produce systems that meet practical needs.  
Electrical systems pervade our lives; they are found in homes, schools, 
 workplaces, and transportation vehicles everywhere. We begin by  presenting 
a few examples from each of the five major classifications of electrical systems:
• communication systems
• computer systems
• control systems
• power systems
• signal-processing systems
Then we describe how electrical engineers analyze and design such systems.
Communication systems are electrical systems that generate, trans-
mit, and distribute information. Well-known examples include television 
equipment, such as cameras, transmitters, receivers, and monitors; radio 
telescopes, used to explore the universe; satellite systems, which return 
images of other planets and our own; radar systems, used to coordinate 
plane flights; and telephone systems.
Figure 1.1 depicts the major components of a modern telephone sys-
tem that supports mobile phones, landlines, and international calling. 
Inside a telephone, a microphone turns sound waves into electric signals. 
These signals are carried to local or mobile exchanges, where they are

combined with the signals from tens, hundreds, or thousands of other 
telephones. The form of the signals can be radio waves traveling through 
air, electrical signals traveling in underground coaxial cable, light pulses 
traveling in fiber-optic cable, or microwave signals that travel through 
space. The combined signals are broadcast from a transmission antenna 
to a receiving antenna. There the  combined signals are separated at an 
exchange, and each is routed to the appropriate telephone, where an 
earphone acts as a speaker to convert the received electric signals back 
into sound waves. At each stage of the process, electric circuits operate 
on the signals. Imagine the challenge involved in designing, building, and 
 operating each circuit in a way that guarantees that all of the hundreds of 
 thousands of simultaneous calls have high-quality connections.
Computer systems use electric signals to process information ranging  
from word processing to mathematical computations. Systems range 
in size and power from simple calculators to personal computers to 
 supercomputers that perform such complex tasks as processing weather 
data and modeling chemical interactions of complex organic molecules.  
These systems include networks of integrated circuits—miniature 
 assemblies of hundreds, thousands, or millions of electrical components 
that often  operate at speeds and power levels close to fundamental 
 physical limits, including the speed of light and the thermodynamic laws.
Control systems use electric signals to regulate processes. Examples 
include the control of temperatures, pressures, and flow rates in an oil 
refinery; the fuel–air mixture in a fuel-injected automobile engine; mech-
anisms such as the motors, doors, and lights in elevators; and the locks in 
the Panama Canal. The autopilot and autolanding systems that help to fly 
and land airplanes are also familiar control systems.
Power systems generate and distribute electric power. Electric power, 
which is the foundation of our technology-based society, usually is gen-
erated in large quantities by nuclear, hydroelectric, solar, and thermal 
(coal-, oil-, or gas-fired) generators. Power is distributed by a grid of con-
ductors that  crisscross the country. A major challenge in designing and 
operating such a system is to provide sufficient redundancy and control 
so that failure of any piece of equipment does not leave a city, state, or 
region completely without power.
Signal-processing systems act on electric signals 
that represent information. They transform the sig-
nals and the information contained in them into a 
more suitable form. There are many different ways 
to process the signals and their information. For 
example, image-processing systems gather massive 
quantities of data from orbiting weather satellites, 
reduce the amount of data to a manageable level, 
and transform the remaining data into a video image 
for the evening news broadcast. A magnetic reso-
nance imaging (MRI) scan is another example of an 
image-processing system. It takes signals generated 
by powerful magnetic fields and radio waves and 
transforms them into a detailed, three- dimensional 
image such as the one shown in Fig. 1.2, which can 
be used to diagnose disease and injury.
Considerable interaction takes place among the 
engineering disciplines involved in designing and oper-
ating these five classes of systems. Thus, communica-
tions engineers use digital computers to control the 
flow of information. Computers contain control sys-
tems, and control systems contain computers. Power 
systems require extensive communications systems to

coordinate safely and reliably the operation of components, which may be 
spread across a continent. A signal-processing system may involve a commu-
nications link, a computer, and a control system.
A good example of the interaction among systems is a  commercial 
airplane, such as the one shown in Fig. 1.3. A sophisticated communica-
tions system enables the pilot and the air traffic controller to monitor the 
plane’s location, permitting the air traffic controller to design a safe flight 
path for all of the nearby aircraft and enabling the pilot to keep the plane 
on its designated path. An onboard computer system manages engine 
functions, implements the navigation and flight control systems, and gen-
erates video information screens in the cockpit. A complex control system 
uses cockpit commands to adjust the position and speed of the airplane, 
producing the appropriate signals to the engines and the control surfaces 
(such as the wing flaps, ailerons, and rudder) to ensure the plane remains 
safely airborne and on the desired flight path. The plane must have its 
own power system to stay aloft and to provide and distribute the electric 
power needed to keep the cabin lights on, make the coffee, and activate 
the entertainment system. Signal-processing systems reduce the noise in 
air traffic communications and transform information about the plane’s 
location into the more meaningful form of a video display in the cockpit. 
Engineering challenges abound in the design of each of these systems and 
their integration into a coherent whole. For example, these systems must 
operate in widely varying and unpredictable environmental conditions. 
Perhaps the most important engineering challenge is to guarantee that 
sufficient redundancy is incorporated in the designs,  ensuring that passen-
gers  arrive safely and on time at their desired destinations.
Although electrical engineers may be interested primarily in one area, 
they must also be knowledgeable in other areas that interact with this area 
of interest. This interaction is part of what makes electrical engineering 
a challenging and exciting profession. The emphasis in engineering is on 
making things work, so an engineer is free to acquire and use any tech-
nique from any field that helps to get the job done.

1.1 Electrical Engineering: An Overview

Circuit Theory
An electric circuit is a mathematical model that approximates the behav-
ior of an actual electrical system. Since electric circuits are found in every 
branch of electrical engineering, they provide an important foundation for 
learning how to design and operate systems such as those just described. 
The models, the mathematical techniques, and the language of circuit theory 
will form the intellectual framework for your future engineering endeavors.
Note that the term electric circuit is commonly used to refer to an 
actual electrical system as well as to the model that represents it. In this 
text, when we talk about an electric circuit, we always mean a model, 
unless otherwise stated. It is the modeling aspect of circuit theory that has 
broad applications across engineering disciplines.
Circuit theory is a special case of electromagnetic field theory: the 
study of static and moving electric charges. But applying generalized 
field theory to the study of electric signals is cumbersome and requires 
advanced mathematics. Consequently, a course in electromagnetic field 
theory is not a prerequisite to understanding the material in this text. We 
do, however, assume that you have had an introductory physics course in 
which electrical and magnetic phenomena were discussed.
Three basic assumptions permit us to use circuit theory, rather than 
electromagnetic field theory, to study a physical system represented by an 
electric circuit.
1. Electrical effects happen instantaneously throughout a system. We 
can make this assumption because we know that electric signals 
travel at or near the speed of light. Thus, if the system is physically 
small, electric signals move through it so quickly that we can con-
sider them to affect every point in the system simultaneously. A 
system that is small enough so that we can make this assumption is 
called a lumped-parameter system.
2. The net charge on every component in the system is always zero. 
Thus, no component can collect a net excess of charge, although 
some components, as you will learn later, can hold equal but oppo-
site separated charges.
3. There is no magnetic coupling between the components in a system. 
As we demonstrate later, magnetic coupling can occur within a 
component.
That’s it; there are no other assumptions. Using circuit theory provides 
simple solutions (of sufficient accuracy) to problems that would become 
hopelessly complicated if we were to use electromagnetic field theory. 
These benefits are so great that engineers sometimes specifically design 
electrical systems to ensure that these assumptions are met. The impor-
tance of assumptions 2 and 3 becomes apparent after we introduce the 
basic circuit elements and the rules for analyzing interconnected elements.
Let’s take a closer look at assumption 1. The question is, “How 
small does a physical system have to be to qualify as a lumped-parameter 
 system?” To get a quantitative answer to this question, remember that 
electric signals propagate as waves. If the wavelength of the signal is large 
compared to the physical dimensions of the system, we have a lumped- 
parameter system. The wavelength λ is the velocity divided by the repeti-
tion rate, or frequency, of the signal; that is, 
c f
λ =
. The frequency f is 
measured in hertz (Hz). For example, power systems in the United States 
operate at 60 Hz. If we use the speed of light c
(
3
10 m/s)
8
=
×
 as the 
velocity of propagation, the wavelength is 5
10 6
×
 m. If the power system 
of interest is physically smaller than this wavelength, we can represent it as 
a lumped-parameter system and use circuit theory to analyze its behavior. 

8 
Circuit Variables
How do we define smaller? A good rule is the rule of 1 10th: If the  dimension 
of the system is less than 1 10th  the dimension of the wavelength, you 
have a lumped-parameter system. Thus, as long as the physical dimension 
of the power system is less than 5
10 5
×
 m (which is about 310 miles),  
we can treat it as a lumped-parameter system.
Now consider a communication system that sends and receives radio 
signals. The propagation frequency of radio signals is on the order of 
10 9 Hz, so the wavelength is 0.3 m. Using the rule of 1 10th, a commu-
nication system qualifies as a lumped-parameter system if its dimension 
is less than 3 cm. Whenever any of the pertinent physical dimensions of a 
system under study approaches the wavelength of its signals, we must use 
electromagnetic field theory to analyze that system. Throughout this text 
we study circuits derived from lumped-parameter systems.
Problem Solving
As a practicing engineer, you will not be asked to solve problems that 
have already been solved. Whether you are improving the performance 
of an existing system or designing a new system, you will be working on 
unsolved problems. As a student, however, you will read and discuss 
problems with known solutions. Then, by solving related homework and 
exam problems on your own, you will begin to develop the skills needed 
to  attack the unsolved problems you’ll face as a practicing engineer.
Let’s review several general problem-solving strategies. Many of 
these pertain to thinking about and organizing your solution strategy 
 before proceeding with calculations.
1. Identify what’s given and what’s to be found. In problem solving, 
you need to know your destination before you can select a route 
for getting there. What is the problem asking you to solve or find? 
Sometimes the goal of the problem is obvious; other times you may 
need to paraphrase or make lists or tables of known and unknown 
information to see your objective.
On one hand, the problem statement may contain extraneous 
information that you need to weed out before proceeding. On the 
other hand, it may offer incomplete information or more complexi-
ties than can be handled by the solution methods you know. In that 
case, you’ll need to make assumptions to fill in the missing infor-
mation or simplify the problem context. Be prepared to circle back 
and reconsider supposedly extraneous information and/or your 
assumptions if your calculations get bogged down or produce an 
answer that doesn’t seem to make sense.
2. Sketch a circuit diagram or other visual model. Translating a verbal 
problem description into a visual model is often a useful step in the 
solution process. If a circuit diagram is already provided, you may 
need to add information to it, such as labels, values, or reference 
directions. You may also want to redraw the circuit in a simpler, but 
equivalent, form. Later in this text you will learn the methods for 
developing such simplified equivalent circuits.
3. Think of several solution methods and decide on a way of choosing 
among them. This course will help you build a collection of analyt-
ical tools, several of which may work on a given problem. But one 
method may produce fewer equations to be solved than another, or 
it may require only algebra instead of calculus to reach a solution. 
Such efficiencies, if you can anticipate them, can streamline your cal-
culations considerably. Having an alternative method in mind also 
gives you a path to pursue if your first solution attempt bogs down.

 
1.2 The International System of Units

4. Calculate a solution. Your planning up to this point should have helped 
you identify a good analytical method and the correct equations for 
the problem. Now comes the solution of those equations. Paper-and- 
pencil, calculator, and computer methods are all available for per-
forming the actual calculations of circuit analysis. Efficiency and your 
instructor’s preferences will dictate which tools you should use.
5. Use your creativity. If you suspect that your answer is off base or if 
the calculations seem to go on and on without moving you toward a 
solution, you should pause and consider alternatives. You may need 
to revisit your assumptions or select a different solution method. Or 
you may need to take a less conventional problem-solving approach, 
such as working backward from a solution. This text provides 
answers to all of the Assessment Problems and many of the Chapter 
Problems so that you may work backward when you get stuck. In 
the real world, you won’t be given answers in advance, but you may 
have a desired problem outcome in mind from which you can work 
backward. Other creative approaches include allowing yourself to 
see parallels with other types of problems you’ve successfully solved, 
following your intuition or hunches about how to proceed, and sim-
ply setting the problem aside temporarily and coming back to it later.
6. Test your solution. Ask yourself whether the solution you’ve obtained 
makes sense. Does the magnitude of the answer seem reasonable? Is 
the solution physically realizable? Are the units correct? You may 
want to rework the problem using an alternative method to validate 
your original answer and help you develop your intuition about the 
most efficient solution methods for various kinds of problems. In the 
real world, safety-critical designs are always checked by several inde-
pendent means. Getting into the habit of checking your answers will 
benefit you both as a student and as a practicing engineer.
These problem-solving steps cannot be used as a recipe to solve every prob-
lem in this or any other course. You may need to skip, change the order of, 
or elaborate on certain steps to solve a particular problem. Use these steps 
as a guideline to develop a problem-solving style that works for you.
1.2 The International System of Units
Engineers use quantitative measures to compare theoretical results to exper-
imental results and compare competing engineering designs. Modern engi-
neering is a multidisciplinary profession in which teams of engineers work 
together on projects, and they can communicate their results in a meaningful 
way only if they all use the same units of measure. The International System 
of Units (abbreviated SI) is used by all the major engineering societies and 
most engineers throughout the world; hence we use it in this text.
The SI units are based on seven defined quantities:
• length
• mass
• time
• electric current
• thermodynamic temperature
• amount of substance
• luminous intensity
These quantities, along with the basic unit and symbol for each, are 
listed in Table 1.1. Although not strictly SI units, the familiar time units 

10 
Circuit Variables
of minute (60 s), hour (3600 s), and so on are often used in engineering 
calculations. In addition, defined quantities are combined to form derived 
units. Some quantities, such as force, energy, power, and electric charge, 
you already know through previous physics courses. Table 1.2 lists the 
derived units used in this text.
In many cases, the SI unit is either too small or too large to use con-
veniently. Standard prefixes corresponding to powers of 10, as listed in 
Table 1.3, are then applied to the basic unit. Engineers often use only the 
prefixes for powers divisible by 3; thus centi, deci, deka, and hecto are used 
rarely. Also, engineers often select the prefix that places the base number 
in the range between 1 and 1000. Suppose that a time calculation yields 
a result of 10
5
− s, that is, 0.00001 s. Most engineers would describe this  
quantity as 10
s
µ , that is, 
×

6 , rather than as 0.01 ms or 10,000 ns.
Example 1.1 illustrates a method for converting from one set of units 
to another and also uses power-of-10 prefixes.

1.3 Circuit Analysis: An Overview
We look broadly at engineering design, specifically the design of electric 
 circuits, before becoming involved in the details of circuit analysis. This 
overview provides you with a perspective on where circuit analysis fits within 
the whole of circuit design. Even though this text focuses on circuit analysis, 
we try to provide opportunities for circuit design where appropriate.
All engineering designs begin with a need 1 , as shown in Fig. 1.4. 
This need may come from the desire to improve on an existing design, or it 
may be something brand new. A careful assessment of the need results in 
design specifications, which are measurable characteristics of a proposed 
design. Once a design is proposed, the design specifications 2  allow us 
to assess whether or not the design actually meets the need.
A concept 3  for the design comes next. The concept derives from 
a complete understanding of the design specifications coupled with an 
insight into the need, which comes from education and experience. The 
concept may be realized as a sketch, as a written description, or as some 
other form. Often the next step is to translate the concept into a mathe-
matical model. A commonly used mathematical model for electrical sys-
tems is a circuit model 4 .
The elements that make up the circuit model are called ideal circuit 
components. An ideal circuit component is a mathematical model of an 
actual electrical component, like a battery or a light bulb. The ideal circuit

components used in a circuit model should rep-
resent the behavior of the actual electrical com-
ponents to an acceptable degree of accuracy. 
The tools of circuit analysis 5 , the focus of 
this text, are then applied to the circuit. Circuit 
 analysis uses mathematical techniques to predict 
the behavior of the circuit model and its ideal 
circuit components. A comparison between the 
desired behavior, from the design specifications, 
and the predicted behavior, from circuit analysis, 
may lead to refinements in the circuit model and 
its ideal circuit elements. Once the desired and 
 predicted behaviors are in agreement, a physical 
prototype 6  can be constructed.
The physical prototype is an actual electrical 
system, constructed from actual electrical com-
ponents. Measurements determine the quantita-
tive behavior of the physical system. This actual 
behavior is compared with the desired behavior 
from the design specifications and the predicted 
behavior from circuit analysis. The comparisons 
may result in refinements to the physical proto-
type, the circuit model, or both. This iterative 
process, in which models, components, and sys-
tems are continually refined, usually produces a 
design that accurately satisfies the design speci-
fications and thus meets the need.
Circuit analysis clearly plays a very important 
role in the design process. Because circuit analysis 
is applied to circuit models, practicing engineers 
try to use mature circuit models so that the result-
ing designs will meet the design specifications in 
the first iteration. In this text, we use models that 
have been tested for at least 40 years; you can 
assume that they are mature. The ability to model actual electrical systems 
with ideal circuit elements makes circuit theory extremely useful to engineers.
Saying that the interconnection of ideal circuit elements can be 
used to quantitatively predict the behavior of a system implies that we 
can  describe the interconnection with mathematical equations. For the 
 mathematical equations to be useful, we must write them in terms of 
measurable quantities. In the case of circuits, these quantities are voltage 
and current, which we discuss in Section 1.4. The study of circuit analysis 
involves  understanding the behavior of each ideal circuit element in terms 
of its voltage and current and understanding the constraints imposed on 
the voltage and current as a result of interconnecting the ideal elements.
1.4 Voltage and Current
The concept of electric charge is the basis for describing all electrical phe-
nomena. Let’s review some important characteristics of electric charge.
• Electric charge is bipolar, meaning that electrical effects are  described 
in terms of positive and negative charges.
• Electric charge exists in discrete quantities, which are integer 
 multiples of the electronic charge, 1.6022

1.4 Voltage and Current 
13
In circuit theory, the separation of charge creates an electric force 
 (voltage), and the motion of charge creates an electric fluid (current).
The concepts of voltage and current are useful from an engineering 
point of view because they can be expressed quantitatively. Whenever 
positive and negative charges are separated, energy is expended. Voltage 
is the energy per unit charge created by the separation. We express this 
ratio in differential form as

v = d
dq ,  
(1.1)
where
the voltage in volts,

the energy in joules,

The electrical effects caused by charges in motion depend on the rate 
of charge flow. The rate of charge flow is known as the electric current, 
which is expressed as

i
dq
dt ,  
(1.2)
where
=
i
the current in amperes,
=
q
the charge in coulombs,

t
the time in seconds.
Equations 1.1 and 1.2 define the magnitude of voltage and current, 
respectively. The bipolar nature of electric charge requires that we assign 
polarity references to these variables. We will do so in Section 1.5.
Although current is made up of discrete moving electrons, we do not 
need to consider them individually because of the enormous number of 
them. Rather, we can think of electrons and their corresponding charge 
as one smoothly flowing entity. Thus, i is treated as a continuous variable.
One advantage of using circuit models is that we can model a com-
ponent strictly in terms of the voltage and current at its terminals. Thus, 
two physically different components could have the same relationship 
between the terminal voltage and terminal current. If they do, for pur-
poses of circuit analysis, they are identical. Once we know how a com-
ponent behaves at its terminals, we can analyze its behavior in a circuit. 
However, when developing component models, we are interested in a 
component’s  internal behavior. We might want to know, for example, 
whether charge conduction is taking place because of free electrons mov-
ing through the crystal lattice structure of a metal or whether it is because 
of electrons moving within the covalent bonds of a semiconductor mate-
rial. These concerns are beyond the realm of circuit theory, so in this text 
we use component models that have already been developed.

1.5 The Ideal Basic Circuit Element
An ideal basic circuit element has three attributes.
1. It has only two terminals, which are points of connection to other 
circuit components.
2. It is described mathematically in terms of current and/or voltage.
3. It cannot be subdivided into other elements.
Using the word ideal implies that a basic circuit element does not exist as a 
realizable physical component. Ideal elements can be connected in order 
to model actual devices and systems, as we discussed in Section 1.3. Using 
the word basic implies that the circuit element cannot be further reduced 
or subdivided into other elements. Thus, the basic circuit elements form 
the building blocks for constructing circuit models, but they themselves 
cannot be modeled with any other type of element.
Figure 1.5 represents an ideal basic circuit element. The box is blank 
because we are making no commitment at this time as to the type of cir-
cuit element it is. In Fig. 1.5, the voltage across the terminals of the box 
is denoted by v, and the current in the circuit element is denoted by i. 
The plus and minus signs indicate the polarity reference for the voltage, 
and the arrow placed alongside the current indicates its reference direc-
tion. Table 1.4 interprets the voltage polarity and current direction, given 
positive or negative numerical values of v and i. Note that algebraically 
the notion of positive charge flowing in one direction is equivalent to the 
notion of negative charge flowing in the opposite direction.
Assigning the reference polarity for voltage and the reference direction 
for current is entirely arbitrary. However, once you have assigned the ref-
erences, you must write all subsequent equations to agree with the chosen 
references. The most widely used sign convention applied to these references 
is called the passive sign convention, which we use throughout this text.

PASSIVE SIGN CONVENTION
Whenever the reference direction for the current in an 
element is in the direction of the reference voltage drop 
across the element (as in Fig. 1.5), use a positive sign in 
any expression that relates the voltage to the current. 
Otherwise, use a negative sign.
We apply this sign convention in all the analyses that follow. Our 
purpose for introducing it even before we have introduced the differ-
ent types of basic circuit elements is to emphasize that selecting polarity 
references is not a function either of the basic elements or the type of

the passive sign convention for power calculations in Section 1.6.

1.6 Power and Energy
Power and energy calculations are important in circuit analysis. Although 
voltage and current are useful variables in the analysis and design of elec-
trically based systems, the useful output of the system often is nonelectrical 
(e.g., sound emitted from a speaker or light from a light bulb), and this out-
put is conveniently expressed in terms of power or energy. Also, all practical 
devices have limitations on the amount of power that they can handle. In the 
design process, therefore, voltage and current calculations by themselves are 
not sufficient to determine whether or not a design meets its specifications.
We now relate power and energy to voltage and current and at the 
same time use the power calculation to illustrate the passive sign conven-
tion. Recall from basic physics that power is the time rate of expending or 
absorbing energy. (A water pump rated 75 kW can deliver more liters per

expressed in the form of a derivative, or

Equation 1.4 shows that the power associated with a basic circuit element is 
the product of the current in the element and the voltage across the element. 
Therefore, power is a quantity associated with a circuit element, and we have 
to determine from our calculation whether power is being delivered to the 
circuit element or extracted from it. This information comes from correctly 
applying and interpreting the passive sign convention (Section 1.5).
If we use the passive sign convention, Eq. 1.4 is correct if the refer-
ence direction for the current is in the direction of the reference voltage 
drop across the terminals. Otherwise, Eq. 1.4 must be written with a minus 
sign. In other words, if the current reference is in the direction of a refer-
ence voltage rise across the terminals, the expression for the power is
p
i.
= −v
The algebraic sign of power is based on charge movement through 
voltage drops and rises. As positive charges move through a drop in volt-
age, they lose energy, and as they move through a rise in voltage, they 
gain energy. Figure 1.6 summarizes the relationship between the polarity 
references for voltage and current and the expression for power.
We can now state the rule for interpreting the algebraic sign of power:
INTERPRETING ALGEBRAIC SIGN OF POWER
• If the power is positive (that is, if p
0
> ), power is being 
delivered to the circuit element represented by the box.
• If the power is negative (that is, if p
0
< ), power is being 
extracted from the circuit element.

Example 1.3 shows that the passive sign convention generates the correct 
sign for power regardless of the voltage polarity and current direction you 
choose.
EXAMPLE 1.3 
Using the Passive Sign Convention
a)  Suppose you have selected the polarity refer-
ences shown in Fig. 1.6(b). Your calculations 
for the current and voltage yield the following 
numerical results:

voltage show that

What power does she calculate?
Solution
a) The power associated with the circuit element in 
Fig. 1.6(b) is

40 W.
Thus, the circuit element is absorbing 40  W.
b) Your classmate calculates that the power associ-
ated with the circuit element in Fig. 1.6(c) is
= −
−
=
p

40 W.
Using the reference system in Fig. 1.6(c) gives the 
same conclusion as using the reference system in 
Fig. 1.6(b)—namely, that the circuit element is 
absorbing 40 W. In fact, any of the reference sys-
tems in Fig. 1.6 yields this same result.
Example 1.4 illustrates the relationship between voltage, current, 
power, and energy for an ideal basic circuit element and the use of the 
passive sign convention.

Something is wrong—if the values for voltage and current in this circuit 
are correct, the total power should be zero! There is an error in the data, 
and we can find it from the calculated powers if the error exists in the 
sign of a single component. Note that if we divide the total power by 2, 
we get −10 W, which is the power calculated for component d. If the 
power for component d is +10 W, the total power would be 0. Circuit

cles have been sold in the United States since 1999. 
Approximately 1.4 million plug-in electric passen-
ger vehicles have been sold in the United States 
since 2010. Assume the average energy stored in a 
hybrid vehicle battery is 1.5 kilowatt-hours (kWh), 
and assume the average energy stored in a plug-in 
electric vehicle battery is 45 kWh. If 80% of the 
hybrid vehicles and 90% of the plug-in electric 
vehicles are still in service, estimate the total energy 
stored in these vehicles in gigawatt-hours.

battery, you will need to charge the battery to what 
percent of its capacity before starting your trip?

CHAPTER 
Circuit Elements
There are five ideal basic circuit elements:
• voltage sources
• current sources
• resistors
• inductors
• capacitors
In this chapter, we discuss the characteristics of the first three 
circuit elements—voltage sources, current sources, and resistors. 
Although this may seem like a small number of elements, many 
practical systems can be modeled with just sources and resistors. 
They are also a useful starting point because of their relative sim-
plicity; the mathematical relationships between voltage and cur-
rent in sources and resistors are algebraic. Thus, you will be able 
to begin learning the basic techniques of circuit analysis with only 
algebraic manipulations.
 We will postpone introducing inductors and capacitors until 
Chapter 6, because their use requires that you solve integral and 
differential equations. However, the basic analytical techniques 
for solving circuits with inductors and capacitors are the same 
as those introduced in this chapter. So, by the time you need to 
begin manipulating more difficult equations, you should be very 
familiar with the methods of writing them.

elements: independent voltage and current 
sources, dependent voltage and current 
sources, and resistors.
2 Be able to state Ohm’s law, Kirchhoff’s 
 current law, and Kirchhoff’s voltage law, 
and be able to use these laws to analyze 
simple circuits.
3 Know how to calculate the power for each 
element in a simple circuit and be able 
to determine whether or not the power 
 balances for the whole circuit.
CHAPTER OBJECTIVES

Practical Perspective
Heating with Electric Radiators
You want to heat your small garage using a couple of 
electric radiators. The power and voltage requirements 
for each radiator are 1200 W, 240 V. But you are not sure 
how to wire the radiators to the power supplied to the 
garage. Should you use the wiring diagram on the left or 
the one on the right? Does it make any difference?
Once you have studied the material in this chapter, 
you will be able to answer these questions and deter-
mine how to heat the garage. The Practical Perspective 
at the end of this chapter guides you through the anal-
ysis of two circuits based on the two wiring diagrams 
shown below.

Circuit Elements
2.1 Voltage and Current Sources
An electrical source is a device capable of converting nonelectric energy 
to electric energy and vice versa. For example, a discharging battery 
 converts chemical energy to electric energy, whereas a charging battery 
converts  electric energy to chemical energy. A dynamo is a machine  
that converts mechanical energy to electric energy and vice versa. For 
operations in the mechanical-to-electric mode, it is called a generator. For 
transformations from electric to mechanical energy, it is called a motor. 
Electric sources either deliver or absorb electric power while maintaining 
either voltage or current. This behavior led to the creation of the ideal 
voltage source and the ideal current source as basic circuit elements.
• An ideal voltage source is a circuit element that maintains a pre-
scribed voltage across its terminals regardless of the current flowing 
in those terminals.
• An ideal current source is a circuit element that maintains a pre-
scribed current through its terminals regardless of the voltage across 
those terminals.
These circuit elements do not exist as practical devices—they are ideal-
ized models of actual voltage and current sources.
Using an ideal model for current and voltage sources constrains the 
mathematical descriptions of these components. For example, because an 
ideal voltage source provides a steady voltage even if the current in the 
element changes, it is impossible to specify the current in an ideal voltage 
source as a function of its voltage. Likewise, if the only information you 
have about an ideal current source is the value of current supplied, it is 
impossible to determine the voltage across that current source. We have 
sacrificed our ability to relate voltage and current in a practical source for 
the simplicity of using ideal sources in circuit analysis.
Ideal voltage and current sources can be further described as either 
independent sources or dependent sources.
• An independent source establishes a voltage or current in a circuit 
without relying on voltages or currents elsewhere in the circuit. The 
value of the voltage or current supplied is specified by the value of 
the independent source alone.
• A dependent source, in contrast, establishes a voltage or current 
whose value depends on the value of a voltage or current elsewhere 
in the circuit. You cannot specify the value of a dependent source 
unless you know the value of the voltage or current on which it 
depends.
The circuit symbols for the ideal independent sources are shown in 
Fig. 2.1. Note that a circle is used to represent an independent source. To 
completely specify an ideal independent voltage source in a circuit, you 
must include the value of the supplied voltage and the reference polarity, 
as shown in Fig. 2.1(a). Similarly, to completely specify an ideal indepen-
dent current source, you must include the value of the supplied current 
and its reference direction, as shown in Fig. 2.1(b).
The circuit symbol for an ideal dependent source is a diamond, as 
shown in Fig. 2.2. There are four possible variations because both depen-
dent current sources and dependent voltage sources can be controlled by 
either a voltage or a current elsewhere in the circuit. Dependent sources 
are sometimes called controlled sources.
To completely specify an ideal dependent voltage-controlled volt-
age source, you must identify the controlling voltage, the equation

currents that are invariant with time. Constant sources are often called dc 
sources. The dc stands for direct current, a description that has a histori-
cal basis but can seem misleading now. Historically, a direct current was 
defined as a current produced by a constant voltage. Therefore, a constant 
voltage became known as a direct current, or dc, voltage. The use of dc for 
constant stuck, and the terms dc current and dc voltage are now universally 
accepted in science and engineering to mean constant current and con-
stant voltage.
Finally, we note that ideal sources are examples of active circuit ele-
ments. An active element is one that models a device capable of generat-
ing electric energy. Passive elements model physical devices that cannot 
generate electric energy. Resistors, inductors, and capacitors are exam-
ples of passive circuit elements. Examples 2.1 and 2.2 illustrate how the 
characteristics of ideal independent and dependent sources limit the types 
of permissible interconnections of the sources.
Use the definitions of the ideal independent voltage 
and current sources to determine which intercon-
nections in Fig. 2.3 are permitted and which violate 
the constraints imposed by the ideal sources.
Solution
Connection (a) is permitted. Each source supplies 
voltage across the same pair of terminals, marked 
a and b. This requires that each source supply the 
same voltage with the same polarity, which they do.
Connection (b) is permitted. Each source supplies 
current through the same pair of terminals, marked 
a and b. This requires that each source supply the 
same current in the same direction, which they do.
Connection (c) is not permitted. Each source sup-
plies voltage across the same pair of terminals, 
marked a and b. This requires that each source 
 supply the same voltage with the same polarity, 
which they do not.
Connection (d) is not permitted. Each source sup-
plies current through the same pair of terminals, 
marked a and b. This requires that each source 
 supply the same current in the same direction, 
which they do not.
Connection (e) is permitted. The voltage source 
supplies voltage across the pair of terminals 
marked a and b. The current source supplies cur-
rent through the same pair of terminals. Because 
an ideal voltage source supplies the same voltage 
regardless of the current, and an ideal current 
source supplies the same current regardless of the 
voltage, this  connection is permitted.

 Testing Interconnections of Ideal Independent  
and Dependent Sources
State which interconnections in Fig. 2.4 are permit-
ted and which violate the constraints imposed by 
the ideal sources, using the definitions of the ideal 
independent and dependent sources.
Solution
Connection (a) is not permitted. Both the inde-
pendent source and the dependent source supply 
 voltage across the same pair of terminals, labeled 
a and b. This requires that each source supply the 
same voltage with the same polarity. The indepen-
dent source supplies 5 V, but the dependent source 
supplies 15 V.
Connection (b) is permitted. The independent volt-
age source supplies voltage across the pair of termi-
nals marked a and b. The dependent current source 
supplies current through the same pair of terminals. 
Because an ideal voltage source supplies the same 
voltage regardless of current, and an ideal current 
source supplies the same current regardless of volt-
age, this is a valid connection.
Connection (c) is permitted. The independent cur-
rent source supplies current through the pair of 
terminals marked a and b. The dependent voltage 
source supplies voltage across the same pair of ter-
minals. Because an ideal current source supplies 
the same current regardless of voltage, and an ideal 
voltage source supplies the same voltage regardless 
of current, this is a valid connection.
Connection (d) is not permitted. Both the inde-
pendent source and the dependent source supply 
current through the same pair of terminals, labeled 
a and b. This requires that each source supply the 
same current in the same direction. The indepen-
dent source supplies 2 A, but the dependent source 
supplies 6 A in the opposite direction.

Circuit Elements
2.2 Electrical Resistance (Ohm’s Law)
Resistance is the capacity of materials to impede the flow of current or, 
more specifically, the flow of electric charge. The circuit element mod-
eling this behavior is the resistor. Figure 2.5 shows the resistor’s circuit 
symbol, with R denoting the resistance value of the resistor.
To understand resistance, think about the electrons that make up 
electric current moving through, interacting with, and being resisted by 
the atomic structure of some material. The interactions convert some 
electric energy to thermal energy, dissipated as heat. Many useful electri-
cal devices take advantage of resistance heating, including stoves, toast-
ers, irons, and space heaters.
Most materials resist electric current; the amount of resistance 
depends on the material. Metals like copper and aluminum have small 
values of resistance, so they are often used as wires conducting electric 
current. When represented in a circuit diagram, copper or aluminum wir-
ing isn’t usually modeled as a resistor; the wire’s resistance is so small 
compared to the resistance of other circuit elements that we can neglect 
the wiring resistance to simplify the diagram.
A resistor is an ideal basic circuit element, which is described mathe-
matically using its voltage and current. The relationship between voltage 
and current for a resistor is known as Ohm’s law, after Georg Simon Ohm, 
a German physicist who established its validity early in the nineteenth 
century. Consider the resistor shown in Fig. 2.6(a), where the current in 
the resistor is in the direction of the voltage drop across the resistor. For 
this resistor, Ohm’s law is

For the resistor in Fig. 2.6(b), Ohm’s law is
 
v = −iR, 
(2.2)
where υ, i, and R are again measured in volts, amperes, and ohms, respec-
tively. We use the passive sign convention (Section 1.5) in determining the 
algebraic signs in Eqs. 2.1 and 2.2.
Resistance is measured in the SI unit ohms. The Greek uppercase 
omega (Ω) is the standard symbol for an ohm. The circuit diagram symbol 
for an 8 Ω resistor is shown in Fig. 2.7.
Ohm’s law expresses the voltage as a function of the current. 
However, expressing the current as a function of the voltage also is conve-
nient. Thus, from Eq. 2.1,

(2.5)
An 8 Ω resistor has a conductance value of 0.125 S.
Ideal resistors model the behavior of physical devices. The word ideal 
reminds us that the resistor model makes several simplifying assumptions 
about the behavior of actual resistive devices. Assuming the resistance of 
the ideal resistor is constant, so that its value does not vary over time, is 
the most important of these simplifications. Most actual resistive devices 
have a time-varying resistance, often because the temperature of the 
device changes over time. The ideal resistor model represents a physical 
device whose resistance doesn’t vary much from some constant value over 
the time period of interest in the circuit analysis. In this text, we assume 
that the simplifying assumptions about resistance devices are valid, and 
we thus use ideal resistors in circuit analysis.
We can calculate the power at the terminals of a resistor in several 
ways. The first approach is to use the defining equation (Section 1.6) to 
calculate the product of the terminal voltage and current. For the resistor 
shown in Fig. 2.6(a), we write
 
v
=
p
i, 
(2.6)
and for the resistor shown in Fig. 2.6(b), we write
 
v
= −
p

(2.7)
A second method expresses resistor power in terms of the current and 
the resistance. Substituting Eq. 2.1 into Eq. 2.6, we obtain

Equations 2.8 and 2.9 are identical, demonstrating that regardless of volt-
age polarity and current direction, the power at the terminals of a resistor 
is positive. Therefore, resistors absorb power from the circuit.

Sometimes a resistor’s value will be expressed as a conductance

Equations 2.6–2.12 provide a variety of methods for calculating the power 
absorbed by a resistor. Each yields the same answer. In analyzing a circuit, 
look at the information provided and choose the power equation that uses 
that information directly.
Example 2.3 illustrates Ohm’s law for a circuit with an ideal source 
and a resistor. Power calculations at the terminals of a resistor also are 
illustrated.
In each circuit in Fig. 2.8, either the value of v  or i is 
not known.

2.3 Constructing a Circuit Model
Let’s now move on to using ideal sources and resistors to construct circuit 
models of real-world systems. Developing a circuit model of a device or 
system is an important skill. Although this text emphasizes circuit-solving 
skills, as an electrical engineer you’ll need other skills as well, one of the 
most important of which is modeling.
We develop circuit models in the next two examples. In Example 2.4, 
we construct a circuit model based on knowing how the system’s compo-
nents behave and how the components are interconnected. In Examp le 2.5, 
we create a circuit model by measuring the terminal behavior of a device.
EXAMPLE 2.4 
Constructing a Circuit Model of a Flashlight
Thom Lang/Corbis/Getty Imagess
Figure 2.9 ▲ A flashlight can be viewed as an electri-
cal system.
Construct a circuit model of a flashlight. Figure 2.9 
shows a photograph of a widely available flashlight.
Solution
When a flashlight is regarded as an electrical sys-
tem, the components of primary interest are the 
batteries, the lamp, the connector, the case, and the 
switch. Figure  2.10 shows these components. We 
now consider the circuit model for each component.
• A dry-cell battery maintains a reasonably con-
stant terminal voltage if the current demand is 
not excessive. Thus, if the dry-cell battery is oper-
ating within its intended limits, we can model it 
with an ideal voltage source. The prescribed volt-
age is constant and equal to the sum of two dry-
cell values.
• The ultimate output of the lamp is light energy, 
the result of heating the lamp’s filament to a 
temperature high enough to cause radiation in 
the visible range. We can model the lamp with 
an  ideal resistor. The resistor accounts for the 
amount of electric energy converted to thermal 
energy, but it does not predict how much of the 
thermal energy is converted to light energy. The 
resistor representing the lamp also predicts the 
steady current drain on the batteries, a character-
istic of the system that also is of interest. In this 
model, Rl symbolizes the lamp resistance.
•  The connector used in the flashlight serves a 
dual role. First, it provides an electrical con-
ductive path between the dry cells and the 
case. Second, it is formed into a springy coil 
that applies mechanical pressure to the contact 
between the batteries and the lamp, maintaining 
contact between the two dry cells and between 
the dry cells and the lamp. Hence, in choosing 
the wire for the connector, we may find that its 
mechanical properties are more important than 
its electrical properties for the flashlight design. 
Electrically, we can model the connector with an 
ideal resistor with resistance R1.
• The case also serves both a mechanical and an 
electrical purpose. Mechanically, it contains all 
the other components and provides a grip for the 
person using the flashlight. Electrically, it pro-
vides a connection between other elements in 
the flashlight. If the case is metal, it conducts cur-
rent between the batteries and the lamp. If it is 
plastic, a metal strip inside the case connects the 
coiled connector to the switch. An ideal resistor 
with resistance Rc models the electrical connec-
tion provided by the case.

 
2.3 Constructing a Circuit Model 
37
Our flashlight example provides some general modeling guidelines.
1. The electrical behavior of each physical component is of primary 
interest in a circuit model. In the flashlight model, three very differ-
ent physical components—a lamp, a coiled wire, and a metal case—
are all represented by resistors because each circuit component 
resists the current flowing through the circuit.
2. Circuit models may need to account for undesired as well as desired 
electrical effects. For example, the heat resulting from the lamp 
resistance produces the light, a desired effect. However, the heat 
resulting from the case and coil resistance represents an unwanted 
or parasitic resistance. It drains the dry cells and produces no useful 
output. Such parasitic effects must be considered, or the resulting 
model may not adequately represent the system.

• The switch has two electrical states: on or off. An 
ideal switch in the on state offers no  resistance 
to the current, but it offers infinite resistance to 
current in the off state. These two states repre-
sent the limiting values of a resistor; that is, the 
on state corresponds to a zero resistance, called 
a short circuit R
(
0),
=
 and the off state corre-
sponds to an infinite resistance called an open 
circuit R
.

 Figures 2.11(a) and (b) depict 
a short circuit and an open circuit, respectively. 
The symbol shown in Fig.  2.11(c) represents a 
switch that can be either a short circuit or an 
open circuit, depending on the position of its 
contacts.
We now construct the circuit model of the 
flashlight shown in Fig. 2.10. Starting with the dry-
cell batteries, the positive terminal of the first cell 
is connected to the negative terminal of the sec-
ond cell. The positive terminal of the second cell is 
connected to one terminal of the lamp. The other 
terminal of the lamp makes contact with one side 
of the switch, and the other side of the switch is 
connected to the metal case. The metal spring con-
nects the metal case to the negative terminal of the 
first dry cell. Note that the connected elements in 
Fig. 2.10 form a closed path or circuit. Figure 2.12 
shows a circuit model for the flashlight.

Circuit Elements
3. Modeling requires approximation. We made several simplifying 
assumptions in developing the flashlight’s circuit model. For exam-
ple, we assumed an ideal switch, but in practical switches, contact 
resistance may be large enough to interfere with proper operation 
of the system. Our model does not predict this behavior. We also 
assumed that the coiled connector exerts enough pressure to elim-
inate any contact resistance between the dry cells. Our model does 
not predict the effect of inadequate pressure. Our use of an ideal 
voltage source ignores any internal dissipation of energy in the dry 
cells, which might be due to the parasitic heating just mentioned. 
We could account for this by adding an ideal resistor between the 
source and the lamp resistor. Our model assumes the internal loss 
to be negligible.
We used a basic understanding of the internal components of the 
flashlight to construct its circuit model. However, sometimes we know 
only the terminal behavior of a device and must use this information to 
construct the model. Example 2.5 presents such a modeling problem.
EXAMPLE 2.5 
Constructing a Circuit Model Based on Terminal Measurements
The voltage and current are measured at the ter-
minals of the device illustrated in Fig. 2.13(a), and 
the values of v t  and it are tabulated in Fig. 2.13(b). 
Construct a circuit model of the device inside the 
box.
Solution
Plotting the voltage as a function of the current 
yields the graph shown in Fig. 2.14(a). The equation 
of the line in this figure is v
=
i4
t
t , so the termi-
nal voltage is directly proportional to the terminal 
current. Using Ohm’s law, the device inside the box 
behaves like a 4 Ω resistor. Therefore, the circuit 
model for the device inside the box is a 4 Ω resistor, 
as seen in Fig. 2.14(b).
We come back to this technique of using termi-
nal characteristics to construct a circuit model after 
introducing Kirchhoff’s laws and circuit analysis.

2.4 Kirchhoff’s Laws
A circuit is solved when we determine the voltage across and the current 
in every element. While Ohm’s law is an important tool for solving a cir-
cuit, it may not be enough to provide a complete solution. Generally, we 
need two additional algebraic relationships, known as Kirchhoff’s laws, to 
solve most circuits.
Kirchhoff’s Current Law
Let’s try to solve the flashlight circuit from Example 2.4. We begin by 
redrawing the circuit as shown in Fig. 2.15, with the switch in the on state. 
We have labeled the current and voltage variables associated with each 
resistor and the current associated with the voltage source, including 
reference polarities. For convenience, we use the same subscript for the 
voltage, current, and resistor labels. In Fig. 2.15, we also removed some 
of the terminal dots of Fig. 2.12 and have inserted nodes. Terminal dots 
are the start and end points of an individual circuit element. A node is a 
point where two or more circuit elements meet. In Fig. 2.15, the nodes 
are labeled a, b, c, and d. Node d connects the battery and the lamp and 
stretches all the way across the top of the diagram, though we label a sin-
gle point for convenience. The dots on either side of the switch indicate 
its terminals, but only one is needed to represent a node, labeled node c.
The circuit in Fig. 2.15 has seven unknowns: is, i1, ic, il, v 1 , v c , and v l . 
Recall that 
= 3 V,
s
v
 as it represents the sum of the terminal voltages 
of the two dry cells. To solve the flashlight circuit, we must find values 
for the seven unknown variables. From algebra, you know that to find 
n unknown quantities you must solve n simultaneous independent equa-
tions. Applying Ohm’s law (Section  2.2) to each of the three resistors 
gives us three of the seven equations we need:
 
v

What about the other four equations?
Connecting the circuit elements constrains the relationships among 
the terminal voltages and currents. These constraints are called Kirchhoff’s 
laws, after Gustav Kirchhoff, who first stated them in a paper published 
in 1848. The two laws that state the constraints in mathematical form are 
known as Kirchhoff’s current law and Kirchhoff’s voltage law.
We can now state Kirchhoff’s current law (KCL):

KIRCHHOFF’S CURRENT LAW (KCL)
The algebraic sum of all the currents at any node in
a circuit equals zero.
To use Kirchhoff’s current law at a node, assign an algebraic sign cor-
responding to the current’s reference direction for every current at the 
node. Assigning a positive sign to a current leaving the node requires 
assigning a negative sign to a current entering a node. Conversely, giving a 
negative sign to a current leaving a node requires giving a positive sign to 
a current entering a node.

Circuit Elements
We apply Kirchhoff’s current law to the four nodes in the circuit 
shown in Fig. 2.15, using the convention that currents leaving a node are 
positive. The four equations are:
 
i

But Eqs. 2.16–2.19 are not an independent set because any one of 
the four can be derived from the other three. In any circuit with n nodes, 
n

−
 independent equations can be derived from Kirchhoff’s current 
law.1 Let’s disregard Eq. 2.19 so that we have six independent equations, 
namely, Eqs. 2.13–2.18. We need one more, which we can derive from 
Kirchhoff’s voltage law.
Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law
Before we can state Kirchhoff’s voltage law, we must define a closed path 
or loop. Starting at an arbitrarily selected node, we trace a closed path in 
a circuit through selected basic circuit elements and return to the original 
node without passing through any intermediate node more than once. The 
circuit shown in Fig. 2.15 has only one closed path or loop. For example, 
choosing node a as the starting point and tracing the circuit clockwise, we 
form the closed path by moving through nodes d, c, b, and back to node a. 
We can now state Kirchhoff’s voltage law (KVL):
KIRCHHOFF’S VOLTAGE LAW (KVL)
The algebraic sum of all the voltages around any
closed path in a circuit equals zero.
To use Kirchhoff’s voltage law, assign an algebraic sign (reference 
direction) to each voltage in the loop. As we trace a closed path, a voltage 
will appear either as a rise or a drop in the tracing direction. Assigning a 
positive sign to a voltage rise requires assigning a negative sign to a volt-
age drop. Conversely, giving a negative sign to a voltage rise requires giv-
ing a positive sign to a voltage drop.
We now apply Kirchhoff’s voltage law to the circuit shown in Fig. 2.15, 
tracing the closed path clockwise and assigning a positive algebraic sign to 
voltage drops. Starting at node d leads to the expression

= 0.

Now we have the seven independent equations needed to find the seven 
unknown circuit variables in Fig. 2.15.
Solving seven simultaneous equations for the simple flashlight model 
seems excessive. In the coming chapters, we present analytical techniques 
that solve a simple one-loop circuit like the one shown in Fig. 2.15 using 
a single equation. Before leaving the flashlight circuit, we observe two 
analy sis details that are important for the techniques presented in subse-
quent chapters.
1 We say more about this observation in Chapter 4.

 
2.4 Kirchhoff’s Laws 
41
1. If you know the current in a resistor, you also know the voltage 
across the resistor because current and voltage are directly related 
through Ohm’s law. Thus, you can associate one unknown variable 
with each resistor, either the current or the voltage. For example, 
choose the current as the unknown variable. Once you solve for the 
unknown current in the resistor, you can find the voltage across the 
resistor. In general, if you know the current in a passive element, 
you can find the voltage across it, greatly reducing the number of 
simultaneous equations to solve. In the flashlight circuit, choosing 
the current as the unknown variable eliminates the voltages 
c
v , 
lv , 
and 
1
v  as unknowns, and reduces the analytical task to solving four 
simultaneous equations rather than seven.
2. When only two elements connect to a node, if you know the current 
in one of the elements, you also know it in the second element by 
applying Kirchhoff’s current law at the node. When just two ele-
ments connect at a single node, the elements are said to be in series, 
and you need to define only one unknown current for the two ele-
ments. Note that each node in the circuit shown in Fig. 2.15 con-
nects only two elements, so you need to define only one unknown 
current. Equations 2.16–2.18 lead directly to
i

which states that if you know any one of the element currents, you 
know them all. For example, choosing is as the unknown eliminates 
i1, ic, and il. The problem is reduced to determining one unknown, 
namely, is .
Examples 2.6 and 2.7 illustrate how to write circuit equations based 
on Kirchhoff’s laws. Example 2.8 illustrates how to use Kirchhoff’s laws 
and Ohm’s law to find an unknown current. Example 2.9 expands on the 
technique presented in Example 2.5 for constructing a circuit model for a 
device whose terminal characteristics are known.
EXAMPLE 2.6 
Using Kirchhoff’s Current Law
Sum the currents at each node in the circuit shown 
in Fig. 2.16. Note that there is no connection dot (•) 
in the center of the diagram, where the 4 Ω branch 
crosses the branch containing the ideal current 
source ia.

EXAMPLE 2.8 
 Applying Ohm’s Law and Kirchhoff’s Laws to Find

Because io also is the current in the 120 V 
source, we have two unknown currents and 
therefore must derive two simultaneous equa-
tions involving io and i1. One of the equations 
results from applying Kirchhoff’s current law to 
either node b or c. Summing the currents at node

leaving the node gives

What circuit model components produce this 
relationship between voltage and current? 
Kirchhoff’s voltage law tells us that the voltage 
drops across two components in series add. From 
the equation, one of those components pro-
duces a 30 V drop regardless of the current, so 
this component’s model is an ideal independent 
voltage source. The other component produces a 
positive voltage drop in the direction of the cur-
rent it. Because the voltage drop is proportional 
to the current, Ohm’s law tells us that this com-
ponent’s model is an ideal resistor with a value 
of 5 Ω. The resulting circuit model is depicted in 
the dashed box in Fig. 2.21(b).
b) Now we attach a 10 Ω resistor to the device in 
Fig. 2.21(b) to complete the circuit. Kirchhoff’s 
current law tells us that the current in the 
Ω
10 
resistor equals the current in the 5 Ω resistor.

2.5 Analyzing a Circuit Containing Dependent Sources

2.5  Analyzing a Circuit Containing 
Dependent Sources
We conclude this introduction to elementary circuit analysis by consider-
ing circuits with dependent sources. One such circuit is shown in Fig. 2.22.
We want to use Kirchhoff’s laws and Ohm’s law to find 
o
v  in this cir-
cuit. Before writing equations, it is good practice to examine the circuit 
diagram closely. This will help us identify the information that is known 
and the information we must calculate. It may also help us devise a strat-
egy for solving the circuit using only a few calculations.
A look at the circuit in Fig. 2.22 reveals that:
• Once we know io, we can calculate 
o
v  using Ohm’s law.
• Once we know i∆, we also know the current supplied by the depen-
dent source i5 ∆.
• The current in the 500 V source is i ∆, using Kirchhoff’s current law 
at node a.
There are thus two unknown currents, i∆and io. We need to construct 
and solve two independent equations involving these two currents to pro-
duce a value for 
o
v . This is the approach used in Example 2.10.
 EXAMPLE 2.10     Analyzing a Circuit with a Dependent Source
Find the voltage 
o
v  for the circuit in Fig. 2.22.
Solution
The closed path consisting of the voltage source, the 
5 Ω resistor, and the 20 Ω resistor contains the two 
unknown currents. Apply Kirchhoff’s voltage law 
around this closed path, using Ohm’s law to express 
the voltage across the resistors in terms of the cur-
rents in those resistors. Starting at node c and tra-
versing the path clockwise gives:
i
i

Now we need a second equation containing these 
two currents. We can’t apply Kirchhoff’s voltage 
law to the closed path formed by the 20 Ω resistor 
and the dependent current source because we don’t 
know the value of the voltage across the dependent 
current source. For this same reason, we cannot 
apply Kirchhoff’s voltage law to the closed path con-
taining the voltage source, the 5 Ω resistor, and the 
 dependent source.
We turn to Kirchhoff’s current law to  generate 
the second equation. Either node b or node c can 
be used to construct the second equation from 
Kirchhoff’s current law, since we have already used 
node a to determine that the current in the voltage 
source and the 5 Ω resistor is the same. We select 
node b and produce the following equation,  summing 
the currents leaving the node:

Circuit Elements
Think about a circuit analysis strategy before beginning to write equa-
tions because not every closed path yields a useful Kirchhoff’s voltage law 
equation and not every node yields a useful Kirchhoff’s current law equa-
tion. Think about the problem and select a fruitful approach and useful 
analysis tools to reduce the number and complexity of equations to be 
solved. Example 2.11 applies Ohm’s law and Kirchhoff’s laws to another 
circuit with a  dependent source. Example 2.12 involves a much more com-
plicated circuit, but with a careful choice of analysis tools, the analysis is 
relatively uncomplicated.
EXAMPLE 2.11   Applying Ohm’s Law and Kirchhoff’s Laws to Find  
an Unknown Voltage
a) Use Kirchhoff’s laws and Ohm’s law to find the 
voltage 
o
v  as shown in Fig. 2.23.
b) Show that your solution is consistent with the 
requirement that the total power developed in the 
circuit equals the total power dissipated.
Solution
a)  A close look at the circuit in Fig. 2.23 reveals that:
• There are two closed paths, the one on the left 
with the current is and the one on the right with 
the current io.
• Once io is known, we can compute 
o
v  using 
Ohm’s law.
We need two equations for the two currents. 
Because there are two closed paths and both have 
voltage sources, we can apply Kirchhoff’s voltage 
law to each, using Ohm’s law to express the voltage 
across the resistors in terms of the current in those 
resistors. The resulting equations are:

2.5 Analyzing a Circuit Containing Dependent Sources 
47
EXAMPLE 2.12     Applying Ohm’s Law and Kirchhoff’s Laws in an Amplifier Circuit
The circuit in Fig. 2.24 represents a common con-
figuration encountered in the analysis and design 
of transistor amplifiers. Assume that the values of 
all the circuit elements—R1, R2, RC, RE, VCC, and 
V0—are known.
a) Develop the equations needed to determine the 
current in each element of this circuit.
b) From these equations, devise a formula for com-
puting iB in terms of the circuit element values.
A fourth equation results from imposing the 
constraint presented by the series connection of 
RC and the dependent source:
β
=
i

We use Kirchhoff’s voltage law to derive the 
remaining two equations. We must select two 
closed paths, one for each Kirchhoff’s voltage 
law equation. The voltage across the dependent 
current source is unknown and cannot be deter-
mined from the source current iB
β
, so select two 
closed paths that do not contain this dependent 
current source.
We choose the paths b-c-d-b and b-a-d-b, 
then use Ohm’s law to express resistor voltage 
in terms of resistor current. Traverse the paths 
in the clockwise direction and specify voltage 
drops as positive to yield

b) To get a single equation for iB in terms of the 
known circuit variables, you can follow these 
steps:
• Solve Eq. (6) for i1, and substitute this 
 solution for i1 into Eq. (2).
• Solve the transformed Eq. (2) for i2 , and sub-
stitute this solution for i2  into Eq. (5).
• Solve the transformed Eq. (5) for iE, and sub-
stitute this solution for iE into Eq. (3). Use 
Eq.  (4) to eliminate iC in Eq. (3).
• Solve the transformed Eq. (3) for iB, and 
rearrange the terms to yield

Problem 2.38 asks you to verify these steps. Note 
that once we know iB, we can easily obtain the 
remaining currents.
Solution
Carefully examine the circuit to identify six 
unknown currents, designated i1, i2 , iB, iC, iE, 
and iCC . In defining these six unknown currents, 
we observed that the resistor RC is in series with 
the dependent current source 
iB
β
, so these two 
components have the same current. We now must 
derive six independent equations involving these 
six unknowns.
a) We can derive three equations by applying 
Kirchhoff’s current law to any three of the nodes 
a, b, c, and d. Let’s use nodes a, b, and c and label 
the currents away from the nodes as positive:

Heating with Electric Radiators
Let’s determine which of the two wiring diagrams introduced at the 
beginning of this chapter should be used to wire the electric radiators to 
the power supplied to the garage. We begin with the diagram shown in 
Fig. 2.25. We can turn this into a circuit by modeling the radiators as resis-
tors. The resulting circuit is shown in Fig. 2.26. Note that each radiator has 
the same resistance, R, and is labeled with a voltage and current value.
To find the unknown voltages and currents for the circuit in  
Fig. 2.26, begin by using Kirchhoff’s voltage law to sum the voltage 
drops around the path on the circuit’s left side:

Remember that the power and voltage specifications for each radiator 
are 1200 W, 240 V. Therefore, the configuration shown in Fig. 2.25 sat-
isfies the voltage specification, since each radiator would have a sup-
plied voltage of 240 V.
Next, calculate the value of resistance R that correctly models 
each radiator. We want the power associated with each radiator to be  
1200 W. Use the equation for resistor power that involves the resistance 
and the voltage:

Each radiator can be modeled as a 48 Ω resistor, with a voltage drop of 240 V 
and power of 1200 W. The total power for two radiators is thus 2400 W.
Finally, calculate the power for the 240 V source. To do this, calcu-
late the current in the voltage source, is, using Kirchhoff’s current law to 
sum the currents leaving the top node in Fig. 2.26. Then use is to find 
the power for the voltage source.

Thus, the total power in the circuit is −2400 + 2400 = 0, and the power 
balances.
Now look at the other wiring diagram for the radiators, shown in 
Fig. 2.27. We know that the radiators can be modeled using 48 Ω resis-
tors, which are used to turn the wiring diagram into the circuit in Fig. 2.28.
Start analyzing the circuit in Fig. 2.28 by using Kirchhoff’s voltage 
law to sum the voltage drops around the closed path:

The current in the two resistors is the same, and we can use that cur-
rent in Ohm’s law equations to replace the two unknown voltages in the 
Kirchhoff’s voltage law equation:
48i + 48i = 240 = 96i  ⇒  i = 240
96  = 2.5 A.
Use the current in the two resistors to calculate the power for the two 
radiators:

Thus, if the radiators are wired as shown in Fig. 2.27, their total power is 
600 W. This is insufficient to heat the garage.
Therefore, the way the radiators are wired has a big impact on the 
amount of heat that will be supplied. When they are wired using the dia-
gram in Fig. 2.25, 2400 W of power will be available, but when they are 
wired using the diagram in Fig. 2.27, only 600 W of power will be available.

Summary
• The circuit elements introduced in this chapter are volt-
age sources, current sources, and resistors:
• An ideal voltage source maintains a prescribed 
voltage regardless of the current in the source. An 
ideal current source maintains a prescribed current 
regardless of the voltage across the source. Voltage 
and current sources are either independent, that is, 
not influenced by any other current or voltage in the 
circuit, or dependent, that is, determined by some 
other current or voltage in the circuit. (See pages 28 
and 29.)
• A resistor constrains its voltage and current to be 
proportional to each other. The value of the propor-
tional constant relating voltage and current in a resis-
tor is called its resistance and is measured in ohms. 
(See page 32.)
• Ohm’s law establishes the proportionality of voltage 
and current in a resistor. Specifically,
= iR
v
if the current flow in the resistor is in the direction of 
the voltage drop across it, or
= −iR
v
if the current flow in the resistor is in the direction of 
the voltage rise across it. (See page 32.)
• By combining the equation for power,

law, we can determine the power absorbed by a resistor:

• Kirchhoff’s voltage law states that the algebraic sum 
of all the voltages around any closed path in a circuit 
equals zero. (See page 40.)
• A circuit is solved when the voltage across and the 
 current in every element have been determined. By 
combining an understanding of independent and 
dependent sources, Ohm’s law, and Kirchhoff’s laws, we 
can solve many simple circuits.
elements connect to form a node, they are said to be in 
series. A closed path is a loop traced through connect-
ing elements, starting and ending at the same node and 
encountering intermediate nodes only once each. (See 
pages 39–40.)
• The voltages and currents of interconnected circuit ele-
ments obey Kirchhoff’s laws:
• Kirchhoff’s current law states that the algebraic sum 
of all the currents at any node in a circuit equals zero.

Simple Resistive Circuits
This chapter focuses on two important circuit element 
 interconnections: series connections and parallel connections.
• When resistors are connected in series and in parallel, we 
can combine these resistors into equivalent resistors, reduc-
ing the number of circuit elements and the circuit’s com-
plexity, and simplifying the circuit analysis.
•  When a voltage source is connected to two or more resistors 
in series, the supplied voltage divides across the resistors. 
This common configuration is used as a voltage divider that 
outputs a specific (desired) voltage, smaller than the sup-
plied voltage. We introduce voltage division, a new tool that 
simplifies the analysis of these circuits.
• When a current source is connected to two or more resistors 
in parallel, the supplied current divides among the resistors. 
This common configuration is used as a current divider that 
 outputs a specific (desired) current, smaller than the sup-
plied current. We introduce current division, a new tool that 
simplifies the analysis of these circuits.
Finally, we look at three important measurement instruments.
• The ammeter, which is a practical application of the current 
divider, is used to measure current.
•  The voltmeter, which is a practical application of the voltage  
divider, is used to measure voltage.
• The Wheatstone bridge, which introduces two new inter-
connections known as delta and wye connections, is used  
to measure resistance.

Practical Perspective
Resistive Touch Screens
Many mobile phones and tablet computers use touch 
screens created by applying a transparent resistive 
material to the glass or acrylic screens. Two screens 
are typically used, separated by a transparent insulat-
ing layer. We can model a touch screen as a grid of 
resistors in the x-direction and a grid of resistors in the 
y-direction. The figure on the right depicts one row of  
the grid in the x-direction, with terminals 
1
x  and
2
x , 
and one column of the grid in the y-direction, with ter-
minals 
1
y  and 
2
y .
A separate electronic circuit repeatedly applies a volt-
age drop across the grid in the x-direction (between the 
points 
1
x  and 
2
x  ), then removes that voltage and applies 
a voltage drop across the grid in the y-direction (between 
points 
1
y  and 
2
y  ). When the screen is touched, the two 
resistive layers are pressed together, creating a voltage 
that is sensed in the x-grid and another voltage that is 
sensed in the y-grid. These two voltages precisely locate 
the point where the screen was touched.
How is the voltage created by touching the screen 
related to the position where the screen was touched? 
How are the properties of the grids used to calculate the 
touch position? We will answer these questions in the 
Practical Perspective at the end of this chapter. The circuit 
analysis required to answer these questions uses some of 
the new tools developed in this chapter.

3.1 Resistors in Series
In Chapter 2, we learned that two elements connected at a single node are 
said to be in series. For example, the seven resistors in Fig. 3.1 are con-
nected in series. Series-connected circuit elements carry the same current. 
Applying Kirchhoff’s current law to each node in the circuit, we can show 
that these resistors carry the same current. The series interconnection in 
Fig. 3.1 requires that

so if we know any one of the seven currents, we know them all. Thus, we 
can redraw Fig. 3.1 as shown in Fig. 3.2, using the single current i .

To find i ,
s  we apply Kirchhoff’s voltage law around the single closed 
loop in the clockwise direction. Defining the voltage across each resistor 
as a drop in the direction of is (Ohm’s law) gives

Note that the resistance of the equivalent resistor is always larger than the

Think about equivalent resistance by visualizing the series-connected 
resistors inside a black box, depicted on the left of Fig. 3.4. (An electrical 
engineer uses the term black box to imply an opaque container; that is, 
the contents are hidden from view.) The single equivalent resistor is in 
a second black box, on the right of Fig. 3.4. We can derive the equation 
for the equivalent resistor by writing the equations relating voltage and 
current for each black box and finding the condition that makes these two 
equations equivalent, given in Eq. 3.1 when

3.2 Resistors in Parallel 
61
3.2 Resistors in Parallel
Two elements connected at both of their nodes are said to be in parallel. For 
example, the four resistors in the circuit in Fig. 3.5 are in parallel. Parallel-
connected circuit elements have the same voltage across their terminals. 
Don’t assume that two elements are parallel connected merely because they 
are lined up in parallel in a circuit diagram. The defining characteristic of 
parallel-connected elements is that they have the same voltage across their 
terminals. In Fig. 3.6, you can see that R1 and R3 are not parallel connected 
because, between their respective terminals, another resistor dissipates some 
of the voltage.
We can reduce resistors in parallel to a single equivalent resistor using 
Kirchhoff’s current law and Ohm’s law. In Fig.  3.5, we let the currents 
i
i
i
,  ,  ,

Thus, for just two resistors in parallel, the equivalent resistance equals 
the product of the resistances divided by the sum of the resistances. 
Remember that you can only use this result in the special case of just two 
resistors in parallel.
Work through Examples 3.1 and 3.2 to practice using series and paral-
lel simplifications in circuit analysis.
EXAMPLE 3.1 
Applying Series-Parallel Simplification
a) Find the equivalent resistance seen by the cur-
rent source in Fig. 3.9, using series and parallel 
simplifications.
b) Use your results in part (a) to find the power 
delivered by the current source.
Solution
a) Our goal is a circuit with the 50  mA current 
source and a single resistor. We start simplifying 
the circuit’s right-hand side, moving left toward 
the current source. The 2 kΩ and 3 kΩ resistors 
are in series and can be replaced by a single resis-
tor whose value is

Figure 3.10(a) shows this simplified circuit where 
the 20 kΩ and the 5 kΩ resistors are now in paral-
lel. We replace these parallel-connected resistors 
with a single equivalent resistor, calculating its 
value using the “product over the sum” equation  
(Eq. 3.3):

3.3  The Voltage-Divider  
and Current-Divider Circuits
The Voltage-Divider Circuit
A voltage-divider circuit produces two or more smaller voltages from a 
single voltage supply. This is especially useful in electronic circuits, where 
a single circuit may require voltages of 
15 V
+
, 
15 V
−
, and 
5 V

. An 
example of a voltage-divider circuit that creates two voltages is shown in 
Fig 3.14. We introduce the current i, as shown in Fig. 3.14(b), and recog-
nize (from Kirchhoff’s current law) that R1 and R2 carry this current. 
Using Ohm’s law to determine the resistor voltages from the current i and 
applying Kirchhoff’s voltage law around the closed loop yields

equals the total power dissipated in the resistors, and thus the power in 
the circuit balances. (See Problems 3.10 and 3.11.)

EXAMPLE 3.4 
Adding a Resistive Load to a Voltage Divider

suppose R

Ω and R
30 k
1 =
Ω. Connect 
a resistor R

b) Repeat part (a) using R

but the same value of RL.
Solution
a) The voltage divider with the resistor RL is shown 
in Fig. 3.15. The resistor RL acts as a load on the 
 voltage-divider circuit. A load on any circuit consists 
of one or more circuit elements that draw power 
from the circuit. The parallel combination of the 
two 10 kΩ resistors, one from the voltage divider 
and the other the load resistor RL, gives an equiva-
lent resistance of 5 kΩ. Therefore, from Eq. 3.5,

This is certainly not the 5   V we were expecting the 
voltage divider to deliver to the load, because adding 
the load resistor changed the voltage-divider circuit.
b) The voltage divider with a different set of resis-
tors and the same load resistor is shown in 
Fig.  3.16. Again, we expect the load resistor to 
change the voltage-divider circuit. The parallel 
combination of the 400 Ω and 10 kΩ resistors  
When selecting values for R1 and R2, you should consider the power the  
resistors must dissipate and the effects of connecting the  voltage-divider 
circuit to other circuit components. Example 3.4 uses the voltage divider 
designed in Example 3.3 to supply 5 V to a 10 kΩ resistor.

Another characteristic of the voltage-divider circuit is its sensitivity

ble values. The resistances of commercially available resistors always vary 
within some percentage of their stated value. Example 3.5 illustrates the 
effect of resistor tolerances in a voltage-divider circuit.

The current-divider circuit shown in Fig. 3.19 consists of two resistors con-
nected in parallel across a current source. It divides the current is between 
R1 and R .
2  What is the relationship between the current is and the cur-
rent in each resistor (i1 and i2 )? The voltage across the parallel resistors 
can be expressed in three ways: as the product of the R1 resistor and its 
current i1, as the product of the R2 resistor and its current i2 , and as the 
product of the equivalent resistance seen by the source and the source 
current. These three expressions for the voltage are given as

Equations 3.7 and 3.8 show that when the current divides between two resis-

parallel pair multiplied by the other resistance and divided by the sum of the 
resistors. See how to design a current divider by working through Example 3.6.

ASSESSMENT PROBLEMS
EXAMPLE 3.6 
Designing a Current-Divider Circuit
Suppose the current source for the current divider

0.25   W resistors available, what is the largest R2
 resistor you can use to get i
50 mA
2 =
?
Solution
While you can use Eq. 3.8 to find the ratio of resis-
tors, it should be clear that if the current in one 
resistor is 50   mA, the current in the other resistor 
must also be 50   mA, so both resistors must have the 
same value. Therefore, there are an infinite number 
of different resistor values which, when used for R1
and R2 will give i
50 mA

the same value and the same current, they absorb 
the same amount of power, which cannot exceed

are n resistors connected in series. We are interested in finding the voltage 
drop

v  across an arbitrary resistor Rj  in terms of the voltage v. We start 
by using Ohm’s law to calculate i, the current through all of the resistors in

Now consider the circuit shown in Fig. 3.21, where the box on the left 
contains a single current source or any other combination of basic circuit 
elements that results in the current i shown in the figure. To the right of 
the box are n resistors connected in parallel. We are interested in finding 
the current i j through an arbitrary resistor Rj  in terms of the current i. 
We start by using Ohm’s law to calculate v, the voltage drop across each of

Equation 3.10 is the current division equation. It says that the current ij

tors. The constant of proportionality is the ratio of the equivalent resistance 
of the parallel-connected set of resistors to the single resistance, or R

Note that the constant of proportionality in the current division equation is the 
inverse of the constant of proportionality in the voltage division equation!

voltages and currents in a circuit.

3.5 Measuring Voltage and Current
Working with actual circuits often requires making voltage and current 
measurements. The next two sections explore several common devices 
used to make these measurements. The devices are relatively simple to 
analyze and offer practical examples of the current- and voltage-divider 
configurations. We begin by looking at ammeters and voltmeters.
• An ammeter is an instrument designed to measure current; it is placed 
in series with the circuit element whose current is being measured.
• A voltmeter is an instrument designed to measure voltage; it is placed 
in parallel with the element whose voltage is being measured.
Ideal ammeters and voltmeters have no effect on the circuit variable 
they are designed to measure. That is, an ideal ammeter has an equivalent 
resistance of 0 Ω and functions as a short circuit in series with the ele-
ment whose current is being measured. An ideal voltmeter has an infinite 
equivalent resistance and functions as an open circuit in parallel with the 
element whose voltage is being measured. Figure 3.23 measures the cur-
rent in R1 using an ammeter and measures the voltage across R2 using a  
voltmeter. The ideal models for these meters in the same circuit are shown 
in Fig. 3.24.
There are two broad categories of meters used to measure continuous 
voltages and currents: analog meters and digital meters.

3.5 Measuring Voltage and Current 
71
 Analog Meters
Analog meters are based on the d’Arsonval meter movement, which 
includes a dial readout pointer as shown in Fig.  3.25. The d’Arsonval 
meter movement consists of a movable coil placed in the field of a per-
manent magnet. When current flows in the coil, it creates a torque on the 
coil, causing it to rotate and move a pointer across a calibrated scale. By 
design, the deflection of the pointer is directly proportional to the current 
in the movable coil. The coil is characterized by both a voltage rating and 
a current rating. For example, one commercially available meter move-
ment is rated at 50   mV and 1   mA. This means that when the coil is car-
rying 1   mA, the voltage drop across the coil is 50   mV and the pointer is 
deflected to its full-scale position.
An analog ammeter consists of a d’Arsonval movement in paral-
lel with a resistor, as shown in Fig.  3.26. The parallel resistor limits 
the amount of current in the movement’s coil by shunting some of it 
through R .
A  In contrast, an analog voltmeter consists of a d’Arsonval 
movement in series with a resistor, as shown in Fig.  3.27. Here, the 
resistor limits the voltage drop across the meter’s coil. In both meters, 
the added resistor determines the full-scale reading of the meter 
movement.
From these descriptions we see that an analog meter is nonideal; both 
the added resistor and the meter movement introduce resistance in the 
circuit where the meter is attached. In fact, any instrument used to make 
physical measurements extracts energy from the system while making 
measurements. The more energy extracted by the instruments, the more 
severely the measurement is disturbed. The equivalent resistance of a real 
ammeter is not zero, so it adds resistance to the circuit in series with the 
element whose current is being read. The equivalent resistance of a real 
voltmeter is not infinite, so it adds resistance to the circuit in parallel with 
the element whose voltage is being read.
How much these meters disturb the circuit being measured 
depends on the effective resistance of the meters compared with the 
resistance in the circuit. For example, using the rule of 1 10th , the 
effective resistance of an ammeter should be no more than 1 10th  of 
the value of the smallest resistance in the circuit to be sure that the 
current being measured is nearly the same with or without the amme-
ter. But in an analog meter, the value of resistance is determined by 
the desired full-scale reading we wish to make, and it cannot be arbi-
trarily selected. Examples 3.8 and 3.9 illustrate how to calculate the 
resistance needed in an analog ammeter or voltmeter. The examples 
also determine the effective resistance of the meter when it is inserted 
in a circuit.
EXAMPLE 3.8 
Using a d’Arsonval Ammeter

used in an ammeter with a full-scale reading of 
10   mA. Determine R .

b) Repeat (a) for a full-scale reading of 1   A.
c) How much resistance is added to the circuit 
when the 10   mA ammeter is inserted to measure 
current?
d) Repeat (c) for the 1   A ammeter.
Solution
a)  Look at the analog ammeter circuit in Fig. 3.26. 
The current in the ammeter must divide between 
the branch with the resistor RA  and the branch 
with the meter movement. From the prob-
lem statement we know that when the cur-
rent in the ammeter is 10   mA, 1   mA is flowing 
through the meter coil, which means that 9   mA

EXAMPLE 3.9 
Using a d’Arsonval Voltmeter

b) Repeat (a) for a full-scale reading of 5   V.
c) How much resistance does the 150   V meter insert

d) Repeat (c) for the 5   V meter.
Solution
a) Look at the analog voltmeter circuit in Fig. 3.27. 
The voltage across the voltmeter must divide 
between the resistor Rv  and the meter movement. 
From the problem statement we know that when 
the voltage across the voltmeter is 150   V, the 
voltage across the meter coil must be 50   mV. The 
remaining 149.95   V must be the voltage across Rv. 
We also know that when the movement’s voltage 
drop is 50   mV, its current is 1   mA, which is also 
the current in Rv. Using Ohm’s law,
v

b) For a full-scale reading of 5   V, the voltage across

ASSESSMENT PROBLEMS

Digital Meters
Digital meters measure the continuous voltage or current signal at dis-
crete points in time, called the sampling times. The signal is thus con-
verted from an analog signal, which is continuous in time, to a digital 
signal, which exists only at discrete instants in time. A more detailed 
explanation of the workings of digital meters is beyond the scope of this 
text and course. However, you are likely to see and use digital meters 
in lab settings because they offer several advantages over analog meters. 
They introduce less resistance into the circuit to which they are connected 
(though they are still nonideal), are easier to connect, and take more pre-
cise measurements owing to the nature of their readout mechanism.
3.6 Measuring Resistance—  
The Wheatstone Bridge
While many different circuit configurations are used to measure resistance, 
here we will focus on just one, the Wheatstone bridge. The Wheatstone 
bridge circuit is used to precisely measure resistances of medium val-
ues, that is, in the range of 1 Ω to 1 M .
Ω In commercial models of the 
Wheatstone bridge, accuracies on the order of ±0.1% are possible. The 
bridge circuit, shown in Fig. 3.28, consists of four resistors, a dc voltage 
source, and a detector. The resistance of one of the four resistors can be 
varied, which is indicated by the arrow through R .
3  The dc voltage source 
is usually a battery, which is indicated by the battery symbol for the volt-
age source υ in Fig. 3.28. The detector is generally a d’Arsonval move-
ment in the microamp range and is called a galvanometer. In Fig. 3.28, 
R

To find the value of R ,

is no current in the galvanometer. We then calculate the unknown resistor 
from the simple expression

Simple Resistive Circuits
We derive Eq. 3.11 by applying Kirchhoff’s laws to the bridge circuit. 
We redraw the bridge circuit as Fig. 3.29 to show the branch currents in 
the bridge. When ig is zero, we say the bridge is balanced. At node a, 
Kirchhoff’s current law requires that
=

while at node b, Kirchhoff’s current law requires that

Now, because ig is zero, the voltage drop across the detector is also zero, 
so nodes a and b are at the same potential. Thus, when the bridge is bal-
anced, Kirchhoff’s voltage law for the clockwise path containing the gal-
vanometer and resistors R3 and Rx gives

Now that we have verified the validity of Eq. 3.11, some comments 
about the result are in order. First, note that if 
=
R
R

, the unknown 
resistor Rx equals R3, so R3 must vary over a range that includes the 
value R .
x  For example, if the unknown resistance is 
Ω
1000 
 and R3 could 
be varied from 0 to 100 Ω, the bridge could never be balanced. Thus, 
to cover a wide range of unknown resistors, we must be able to vary the 
ratio R
R
2
1 . In a commercial Wheatstone bridge, R1 and R2 consist of 
decimal values of resistances that can be switched into the bridge cir-
cuit. Normally, the decimal values are 1, 10, 100, and 1000 Ω, so that the 
ratio R
R
2
1  can be varied from 0.001 to 1000 in decimal steps. The vari-
able resistor R3 is usually adjustable in integral values of resistance from  
1 to 11,000
.
Ω
Second, although Eq. 3.11 implies that Rx can vary from zero to infin-
ity, the practical range of Rx is approximately 1 Ω to 1 M .
Ω Resistances 
smaller than 1 Ω are difficult to measure on a standard Wheatstone bridge 
because of thermoelectric voltages generated at the junctions of dissim-
ilar metals and because of thermal heating effects—that is, i R
2
 effects. 
Resistances larger than 1 MΩ are difficult to measure accurately because 
of leakage currents. In other words, if Rx is large, the current leakage in 
the electrical insulation may be comparable to the current in the branches 
of the bridge circuit.
Example 3.10 uses a Wheatstone bridge to measure a range of 
unknown resistors.

Equivalent Circuits
Look again at the Wheatstone bridge in Fig. 3.28; if we replace the gal-
vanometer with its equivalent resistance Rm, we get the circuit shown in 
Fig. 3.31 (p. 76). Because this circuit does not have any series- connected 
or parallel-connected resistors, we cannot simplify it using the sim-
ple series or parallel equivalent circuits introduced earlier in this chap-
ter. But the five interconnected resistors can be reduced to a single 
equivalent resistor using a delta-to-wye ( ∆-to-Y) or pi-to-tee (π-to-T)

, 
m

, and Rx) in the circuit 
shown in Fig. 3.31 form a delta (∆) interconnection because the inter-
connection looks like the Greek letter ∆. It is also called a pi intercon-
nection because the ∆ can be reshaped like the Greek letter π without 
disturbing the electrical equivalence of the two configurations, as shown 
in Fig. 3.32.
The resistors R

, 
m

, and R3 (or R
R

, and Rx) in the circuit shown 
in Fig. 3.31 form a wye (Y) interconnection because the interconnection 
can be shaped to look like the letter Y. It is easier to see the Y shape 
of the interconnection in Fig. 3.33. The Y configuration is also called a 
tee (T) interconnection because the Y structure can be reshaped into a T 
structure without disturbing the electrical equivalence of the two struc-
tures, as shown in Fig. 3.33.
Figure 3.34 illustrates the ∆-to-Y (or π-to-T) equivalent circuit 
transformation. But we cannot transform the ∆ interconnection  
into the Y interconnection simply by changing the shape of the inter-
connections. Saying the ∆-connected circuit is equivalent to the 
Y-connected circuit means that the ∆ configuration can be replaced 
with a Y configuration without changing the terminal behavior. Thus, 
if each circuit is placed in a black box, we can’t tell whether the box 
contains a set of ∆-connected resistors or a set of Y-connected resis-
tors by making external measurements. This condition is true only if 
the resistance between  corresponding terminal pairs is the same for 
each box. For example, the resistance between terminals a and b must 
be the same whether we use the ∆ -connected set or the Y-connected 
set. For each pair of terminals in the ∆-connected circuit, compute 
the equivalent resistance using series and parallel simplifications. For 
each pair of terminals in the Y-connected circuit, compute the equiv-
alent resistance using only series simplification. The three equivalent 
resistance equations are

From the figure you can see that when the touch is on the far right 
side of the screen,

Vx =

on the far left side of the screen,

α =

between the two edges of the screen, the value of α is between 0 and

calculate the voltage Vx using the equation for voltage division:

We can find the value of α, which represents the location of the touch 
point with respect to the far right side of the screen, by dividing the 
voltage across the grid resistance starting at the touch point,Vx, by the 
voltage applied across the entire resistive grid in the x-direction,Vs:
V

α =
Now we want to use the value of α to determine the x-coordinate of 
the touch location on the screen. Typically, the screen coordinates are 
specified in terms of pixels (short for “picture elements”). For example, 
the screen of a mobile phone is a grid of pixels, with px pixels in the 
x-direction and py pixels in the y-direction. Each pixel is identified by its 
x-location (a number between 0 and 
1
px −) and its y-location (a number  
between 0 and 
1
py −). The pixel with the location (0, 0) is in the 
 upper-left-hand corner of the screen, as shown in Fig. 3.40.
Since α represents the location of the touch point with respect 
to the right side of the screen, 1

α

• A voltmeter measures voltage and must be placed in 
parallel with the voltage being measured. An ideal volt-
meter has infinite internal resistance and thus does not 
alter the voltage being measured. (See page 70.)
• An ammeter measures current and must be placed in 
series with the current being measured. An ideal amme-
ter has zero internal resistance and thus does not alter 
the current being measured. (See page 70.)
• Digital meters and analog meters have internal resis-
tance, which influences the value of the circuit variable 
being measured. Meters based on the d ’ Arsonval meter 
movement deliberately include internal resistance as a 
way to limit the current in the movement’s coil. (See 
pages 71–73.)
• The Wheatstone bridge circuit is used to make pre-
cise measurements of a resistor’s value using four 
resistors, a dc voltage source, and a galvanometer. A 
Wheatstone bridge is balanced when the resistors 
obey Eq. 3.11, resulting in a galvanometer reading of  
0   A. (See pages 73–74.)
• A circuit with three resistors connected in a ∆ configu-
ration (or a π configuration) can be transformed into an 
equivalent circuit in which the three resistors are Y con-
nected (or T connected). The ∆-to-Y transformation 
is given by Eqs. 3.15–3.17; the Y-to-∆ transformation is 
given by Eqs. 3.18–3.20. (See pages 75–77.)

 3.45 You have been told that the dc voltage of a power 
supply is about 350   V. When you go to the instru-
ment room to get a dc voltmeter to measure the 
power supply voltage, you find that there are only 
two dc voltmeters available. One voltmeter is rated 
300   V full scale and has a sensitivity of 900 
V
Ω
. 
The other voltmeter is rated 150   V full scale and 
has a sensitivity of 1200 
V
Ω
. (Hint: You can find 
the effective resistance of a voltmeter by multiply-
ing its rated full-scale voltage and its sensitivity.)

the power supply. The reading on the 300   V meter

CHAPTER 
Techniques of Circuit 
Analysis
This chapter introduces two powerful circuit-analysis  
techniques: the node-voltage method and the mesh-current 
method. The power of these methods comes from their ability to 
describe complex circuits using a minimum number of simulta-
neous equations. The alternative—applying Kirchhoff’s laws and 
Ohm’s law—becomes cumbersome for complex circuits.
We also introduce new techniques for simplifying  circuits: 
source transformations and Thévenin and Norton equiva-
lent  circuits. Adding these skills to your existing knowledge of 
 series-parallel reductions and ∆-to-Y transformations greatly 
 expands your ability to simplify and solve complex circuits.
Finally, we explore the concepts of maximum power  transfer 
and superposition. You will learn to use Thévenin equivalent 
circuits to establish the conditions needed to ensure maximum 
power is delivered to a resistive load. Superposition helps us ana-
lyze circuits that have more than one independent source.

CHAPTER OBJECTIVES

Practical Perspective
Circuits with Realistic Resistors
 In the last chapter, we examined the effect of imprecise 
resistor values on the performance of a voltage divider. 
Resistors are manufactured for only a small number of 
discrete values, and any given resistor from a batch of 
resistors will vary from its stated value within some toler-
ance. Resistors with a tolerance of 1% are more expen-
sive than resistors with a tolerance of 10%. If we know 
that a particular resistor must be very close to its stated 
value for the circuit to function correctly, we can then 
decide to spend the extra money necessary to achieve a 
tighter tolerance on that resistor’s value.
Therefore, we want to predict the effect of varying the 
value of each resistor in a circuit on the output of that cir-
cuit, a technique known as sensitivity analysis. Once we 
have presented additional circuit analysis methods, the 
topic of sensitivity analysis will be examined.

Techniques of Circuit Analysis
4.1 Terminology
Before discussing the node-voltage and mesh-current methods of circuit 
analysis, we must define a few basic terms. So far, all the circuits presented 
have been planar circuits—that is, those circuits that can be drawn on 
a plane with no crossing branches. A circuit that is drawn with crossing 
branches still is considered planar if it can be redrawn with no crossing 
branches. For example, the circuit shown in Fig. 4.1(a) can be redrawn as 
Fig. 4.1(b); the circuits are equivalent because all the node connections 
have been maintained. Therefore, Fig. 4.1(a) is a planar circuit because 
it can be redrawn as one. Figure 4.2 shows a nonplanar circuit—it cannot 
be redrawn in such a way that all the node connections are maintained 
and no branches overlap. Identifying a circuit as planar or nonplanar is 
important, because
• the node-voltage method is applicable to both planar and nonplanar 
circuits;
• the mesh-current method is limited to planar circuits.
Describing a Circuit—The Vocabulary
When ideal basic circuit elements (Section 1.5) are interconnected to form 
a circuit, the resulting interconnection is described in terms of nodes, 
paths, loops, branches, and meshes. Two of these terms, nodes and loops, 
were defined in Section 2.4. The rest of the terms are defined in Table 4.1. 
The table also includes examples of each definition taken from the circuit 
in Fig. 4.3, which are developed in Example 4.1.

Simultaneous Equations—How Many?
Recall that we need b independent equations to solve a circuit with b 
unknown currents. In Fig. 4.3, for example, the circuit has nine branches 
with unknown currents, so b
9
=
; we need nine independent equations to 
solve for the unknown currents. Some of the equations can be written by 
applying Kirchhoff’s current law (KCL) to a set of the circuit’s nodes. In 
fact, if the circuit has n nodes, we can derive n
1
−
 independent equations 
by applying Kirchhoff’s current law to any set of n

−
 nodes.1 To obtain 
the rest of the needed b
n
(
1)
−
−
 equations, we apply Kirchhoff’s volt-
age law (KVL) to circuit loops or meshes.
To reduce the number of independent equations needed, we can use 
essential nodes and essential branches instead of nodes and branches. This 
is because the number of essential nodes in a circuit is less than or equal to 
the number of nodes, and the number of essential branches is less than or 
equal to the number of branches. Thus, our systematic method for writing the 
necessary equations to solve for the circuit’s unknown currents is as follows:
• Count the number of essential nodes, ne.
• Count the number of essential branches, be, where the current is 
 unknown.
• Write n

from Example 4.1, as seen in Example 4.2.

Techniques of Circuit Analysis
4.2 Introduction to the Node-Voltage 
Method
The node-voltage method generates independent simultaneous equations 
by applying Kirchoff’s current law at the essential nodes of the circuit. 
Solving the simultaneous equations yields the voltage drops between all 
but one of the essential nodes and a reference essential node. You can 
use these voltages to calculate voltages and currents for every component 
in the circuit, thereby solving the circuit. We illustrate the step-by-step 
 procedure using the circuit in Fig. 4.5.
Step 1 is to make a neat layout of the circuit so that no branches cross 
and to mark the essential nodes on the circuit diagram, as in Fig.  4.6. 
This circuit has three essential nodes n
(
3);
e =
 therefore, we need two 
n
(
1)
e −
 KCL equations to describe the circuit.
Step 2 is to select one of the three essential nodes as a reference 
node. Although in theory the choice is arbitrary, there is often an obvious 
and practical choice. Choosing the reference node becomes easier with 
practice. For example, the node with the most branches is usually a good 
choice, so we select the lower node in Fig. 4.5 as the reference node. The 
reference node is identified by the symbol ▼, as in Fig. 4.6. Complete this 
the current is unknown is b
6
e =
. Note that there 
are seven essential branches in the circuit, but the 
current in the essential branch containing the current 
source is known. We need to write six independent 
equations because there are six unknown currents.
We derive three of the six independent equa-
tions by applying Kirchhoff’s current law to any 
three of the four essential nodes. We use the nodes 
b, c, and e to get

We derive the remaining three equations by 
 applying Kirchhoff’s voltage law around three 
meshes. Remember that the voltage across every 
component in each mesh must be known or must 
be expressed as the product of the component’s 
resistance and its current using Ohm’s law. Because 
the circuit has four meshes, we need to dismiss one 
mesh. We eliminate the R

step by labeling the remaining essential node voltages on the circuit dia-
gram. A node voltage is defined as the voltage rise from the reference 
node to a nonreference essential node. For this circuit, we must define two 
node voltages, which are denoted 
1
v  and 
2
v  in Fig. 4.6.
In Step 3 we generate the KCL equations. To do this, write the cur-
rent leaving each branch connected to a nonreference node as a function 
of the node voltages and sum the currents to zero in accordance with 
Kirchhoff’s current law. Let’s look at node 1. Ohm’s law tells us that the 
current leaving node 1 through the 1 Ω resistor equals the voltage across 
the resistor (
10
1 −
v
) divided by its resistance (1 Ω). That is, the current 
equals (
10)/1.
1 −
v
 Figure 4.7 depicts these observations. Repeating this 
reasoning, the current leaving node 1 through the 5 Ω resistor is 
/5,
1
v
 
and the current leaving node 1 through the 2 Ω resistor is (
)/2.

current source.
In Step 4, solve the simultaneous equations (see Appendix A).

4.3 The Node-Voltage Method  
and Dependent Sources
If the circuit contains dependent sources, the KCL equations must be 
supplemented with the constraint equations imposed by the dependent 
sources. We will modify Step 3 in the node-voltage method to accommo-
date dependent sources. Example 4.4 illustrates the application of the 
node-voltage method to a circuit containing a dependent source.
Solution
a) We begin by noting that the circuit has two essen-
tial nodes; thus, we need to write a single KCL 
equation. Step 1: Identify the two essential nodes. 
Step 2: Select the lower node as the reference 
node and define the unknown node voltage as 
1
v . 
Figure 4.9 illustrates these decisions. Step 3: Write 
a KCL equation at the nonreference essential 
node by summing the currents leaving node 1:

EXAMPLE 4.4 
Using the Node-Voltage Method with Dependent Sources
Use the node-voltage method to find the power dis-

Fig. 4.10.
As written, these two node-voltage equations con-
tain three unknowns, namely, 
1
v , 2
v , and iφ. We need 
a third equation, which comes from the constraint 
imposed by the dependent source. This equation 
expresses the controlling current of the dependent 
source, iφ, in terms of the node voltages, or

As you can see, we need to modify Step 3 in the 
node-voltage procedure to remind us to write a

is present.
Step 3: Write a KCL equation at each nonreference 
essential node. If the circuit contains dependent 
sources, write a dependent source constraint equa-
tion that defines the controlling voltage or current of 
the dependent source in terms of the node voltages.
The condensed form for Step 3 is shown in

A good exercise to build your problem-solving 
intuition is to reconsider this example, using node 2 
as the reference node. Does it make the analysis 
easier or harder?
Solution
Step 1: Identify the circuit’s three essential nodes. 
We will need two KCL equations to describe the 
circuit.
Step 2: Since four branches terminate on the lower 
node, we select it as the reference node and label 
the node voltages at the remaining essential nodes. 
The results of the first two steps are shown in  
Fig. 4.11.

 4.4 The Node-Voltage Method:  
Some Special Cases
Let’s explore the special case in which a voltage source is the only ele-
ment between two essential nodes. The five-step node-voltage method 
still  applies as long as we modify Step 2.
As an example, let’s look at the circuit in Fig. 4.12. There are three 
essential nodes in this circuit, which means two simultaneous equations are 
needed. Apply Steps 1 and 2 to identify the essential nodes, choose a ref-
erence node, and label the remaining nodes. Notice that the 100 V source 
constrains the voltage between node 1 and the reference node to 100 V. 
We now modify Step 2 in order to take advantage of this simplification.
Step 2: Pick and label a reference node, then label the node voltages at the 
remaining essential nodes. If a voltage source is the only element between 
an essential node and the reference node, replace the node voltage label 
with the value of the voltage source.
Thus, we can replace the voltage 
1
v  in the circuit with its value, 100 V, 
as shown in Fig. 4.13.
Now Step 3 requires only a single KCL equation at node 2:

 we can calculate the current in every branch. Use Step 5 to 
verify that the current into node 1 in the branch containing the indepen-
dent voltage source is 1.5 A.
As another example, consider the circuit shown in Fig. 4.14, which has 
four essential nodes and requires three simultaneous equations. However, 
two essential nodes are connected by an independent voltage source, and 
two other essential nodes are connected by a current-controlled dependent

voltage source. Making simple modifications to the node-voltage method 
allows us to take advantage of these observations.
There are several possibilities for the reference node. The nodes 
on each side of the dependent voltage source look attractive because, if 
chosen, one of the node voltages would be either 
i
10
+
φ (left node is the 
reference) or 
i
10
−
φ (right node is the reference). The lower node looks 
even better because one node voltage is immediately known (50 V) and 
five branches terminate there. We therefore opt for the lower node as the 
reference.
Figure 4.15 shows the redrawn circuit, after Steps 1 and 2. Notice that 
we introduced the current i because we cannot express the current in the 
dependent voltage source branch as a function of the node voltages

We will continue the steps of the node-voltage method after we introduce 
a new concept, the supernode.
The Concept of a Supernode
When a voltage source is between two essential nodes, we can combine 
those nodes and the source to form a supernode. Let’s apply the super-
node concept to our circuit from Fig. 4.15. Figure 4.16 shows the circuit 
redrawn with a supernode created by combining nodes 2 and 3. We can 
remember to look for supernodes by modifying Step 2 one final time:
Step 2: Pick and label a reference node, then label the node voltages at the 
remaining essential nodes. If a voltage source is the only element between 
an essential node and the reference node, replace the node voltage label 
with the value of the voltage source. If a voltage source is the only element 
between two nonreference essential nodes, combine the two essential 
nodes and the voltage source into a single supernode.
Step 3 also needs to be modified. Obviously, Kirchhoff’s current law 
must hold for supernodes, so we can write a single KCL equation for the 
supernode. The supernode also constrains the difference between the 
node voltages used to create the supernode to the value of the voltage 
source within the supernode. We therefore need to write a supernode 
constraint equation. Thus, we arrive at the final version of Step 3.
Step 3: Write a KCL equation at each supernode, then write a KCL equa-
tion at each remaining nonreference essential node where the voltage is 
unknown. If there are any dependent sources, write a dependent source 
constraint equation for each one, and if there are any supernodes, write a 
supernode constraint equation for each one.
The final version of the node-voltage method can be found in the end- 
of-chapter Summary; a condensed version is given in Analysis Method 4.3.

Techniques of Circuit Analysis
We can now use Step 3 to create the equations for the circuit in 
Fig. 4.16. First, write the KCL equation for the supernode. Starting with

generate the equation

node to the difference between the two node voltages in the supernode:

Let’s use the node-voltage method to analyze the amplifier circuit first 
introduced in Section 2.5 and shown again in Fig. 4.17. When we analyzed 
this circuit using Ohm’s law, KVL, and KCL in Section 2.5, we faced the task 
of writing and solving six simultaneous equations. Work through Example 
4.5 to see how the node-voltage method can simplify the circuit analysis.

2. Pick and label a reference node; then label the node 
voltage at the remaining essential nodes.

source.
• If a voltage source is the only element between 
two nonreference essential nodes, combine the 
nodes and the source into a single supernode.
3. Write a KCL equation for each supernode and every 
remaining nonreference essential node where the voltage 
is unknown.
• If there are dependent sources, write a constraint 
equation for each one.

for each one.
4. Solve the equations to find the node voltage values 
and any other unknowns.

Step 1: We identify the four essential nodes, which

as the reference node. Then label the voltages at 
the remaining three essential nodes. Before writing 
equations, we notice two special cases. The voltage

the reference node constrains the voltage between 
those nodes, so

, and the voltage source 
V0 in the branch between nodes b and c constrains 
the voltage between those nodes and creates a 
supernode. The results of Steps  1 and 2 and the 
modifications prompted by the special cases are 
depicted in Fig. 4.18.

Techniques of Circuit Analysis
4.5 Introduction to the Mesh-Current 
Method
Before we learn about the mesh-current method for solving circuits, let’s 
summarize the node-voltage method. The node-voltage method pre-
sented in Sections 4.2–4.4 is used to solve a circuit by writing simultane-
ous KCL equations at essential nodes. If a dependent source is present, 
a dependent source constraint equation is required. Special cases exist 
when a voltage source is the only component in a branch connecting two 
essential nodes. If one of the essential nodes is the reference node, the 
node voltage at the other node is the value of the voltage source and no 
KCL equation is required at that node. If neither of the essential nodes is 
the reference node, the two nodes and the voltage source are combined 
into a supernode. A KCL equation is written for the supernode as well as 
a supernode constraint equation. The simultaneous equations are solved 
to find the node voltages, and the node voltages can be used to find the 
voltage, current, and power for every circuit component.
We now turn to the mesh-current method, presented in Sections  
4.5–4.7. The mesh-current method is used to solve a circuit by writing simul-
taneous KVL equations for the circuit’s meshes. If a dependent source is 
present, a dependent source constraint equation is required. Special cases 
exist when a current source is a component of a mesh. If a current source is 
a component in only one mesh, the mesh current must have the same value 
as the current source and no KVL equation is needed for that mesh. If a 
current source is shared by two adjacent meshes, the two meshes are com-
bined to form a supermesh. A KVL equation is written for the supermesh 
as well as a supermesh constraint equation. The simultaneous equations 
are solved to find the mesh currents, and the mesh currents can be used to 
find the voltage, current, and power for every circuit component.
Did you notice the symmetries in the descriptions of the node-voltage 
method and the mesh-current method? In engineering, this symmetry is 
called duality, and we will encounter it throughout this text. In comparing the 
two circuit analysis techniques, we see that essential nodes and meshes are 
duals, KVL and KCL are duals, voltages and currents are duals, supernodes 
and supermeshes are duals, and so on. Recognizing the existence of duality 
can help you master the techniques for circuit analysis presented in this text.
Applying the Mesh-Current Method
Recall from the terms defined in Table 4.1 that a mesh is a loop that does 
not contain any other loops. You should review the definitions of loop 
and path in Table 4.1, too. A mesh current is the current that exists on the 
perimeter of a mesh. We represent a mesh current on a circuit diagram 
4.6 
Use the node-voltage method to find v  in the 
circuit shown.

4.5 Introduction to the Mesh-Current Method 
105
using a curved arrow that follows the mesh perimeter, where the arrow-
head indicates the current’s direction.
Just like the node-voltage method, the mesh-current method is a 
step-by-step procedure. Let’s use the mesh-current method for the circuit 
shown in Fig. 4.19 to solve for the currents i1, i2 , and i3. Because the cir-
cuit has two meshes, we expect to write two simultaneous equations.
In Step 1, we identify the meshes using a directed curved arrow that 
follows the perimeter of the mesh.
Step 2 labels the mesh currents using the labels ia  and ib. The results 
of Steps 1 and 2 are shown in Fig. 4.20. We can see from this figure that 
the branch current i1 equals the mesh current ia  and that the branch 
current i2  equals the mesh current ib. Note that to avoid confusion we 
use different names for the branch currents and the mesh currents in  
this circuit.
In Step 3, we write the KVL equation for each mesh. Let’s start with 
the mesh whose mesh current is ia. Pick a starting point anywhere on the 
perimeter of the mesh and sum the voltage drops for each component 
in the mesh in the direction of the mesh current until you return to the 
starting point. Start below the 100 V source and travel in the clockwise 
direction of the mesh current. The first voltage is due to the 100 V source 
and has the value –100. The next voltage is across the 4 Ω resistor, whose 
current is ia , so from Ohm’s law the voltage is i4 a. The next voltage is 
across the 10 Ω resistor, whose current is (i
i
a
b
−
), so from Ohm’s law the 
voltage is 10(i
i
a
b
−
). We are back to the starting point, so KVL tells us 
that the sum of these three voltages is zero:
i

Repeat this process to get the KVL equation for the ib mesh. Remember 
that you can start anywhere on the perimeter of this mesh, so let’s start at 
the left of the 5 Ω resistor. Again we determine the voltage drops for each 
component in the direction of the ib mesh. The voltage drop for the 5 Ω 
resistor is i5 b, the voltage drop for the 40 V source is 40, and the voltage 
drop for the 10 Ω resistor is 10(i
i
b

). We have returned to the starting 
point, so KVL tells us that the sum of these three voltages is zero:

In Step 4, we solve these simultaneous mesh current equations (see

Step 5 uses the mesh currents to solve for the currents, voltages, and

The ability to calculate the branch currents using the mesh currents is cru-
cial to the mesh-current method of circuit analysis. Once you know the 
mesh currents, you also know the branch currents. And once you know 
the branch currents, you can compute any voltages or powers of  interest.

EXAMPLE 4.6 
Using the Mesh-Current Method
a) Use the mesh-current method to determine the 
power associated with each voltage source in the 
circuit shown in Fig. 4.21.
b) Calculate the voltage 
o
v  across the 8 Ω resistor.
 Solution
a) Step 1: We identify the three meshes in the circuit 
and draw the mesh currents as directed curved 
arrows following the perimeter of each mesh. It 
is best to define all mesh currents in the same di-
rection.
Step 2: Label the mesh currents; the results of the 
first two steps are depicted in Fig. 4.22.
Step 3: We use KVL to generate an equation for 
each mesh by summing the voltages in the direc-
tion of the mesh current. In the ia  mesh, start just 
below the 40 V source and sum the voltages in 
the clockwise direction to give

 4.6 The Mesh-Current Method and 
Dependent Sources
If the circuit contains dependent sources, we must modify the equation- 
writing step in the mesh-current analysis method, just as we did in the 
node-voltage analysis method.
Step 3: Write the KVL equation for each mesh; if the circuit contains 
a dependent source, write a dependent source constraint equation that 
defines the controlling variable for the dependent source in terms of the 
mesh currents.
The condensed form for Step 3 is shown in Analysis Method 4.5. 
Example 4.7 applies the mesh-current method to a circuit with a depen-
dent source.

Using the Mesh-Current Method with Dependent Sources
Use the mesh-current method to find the power 
dissipated in the 4 Ω resistor in the circuit shown

Solution
Step 1: Begin by drawing the mesh currents in each 
of the three meshes.
Step 2: Label each mesh current. The resulting cir-
cuit is shown in Fig. 4.24.
Step 3: Write a KVL equation for each mesh by 
picking a starting point anywhere in the mesh 
and summing the voltages around the mesh in the 
 direction of the mesh current. When you return to 
the starting point, set the sum equal to zero. The

4.7 The Mesh-Current Method: Some 
Special Cases
Recall that voltage sources present special cases when using the node- voltage 
method (Section 4.4). So, it is no surprise that current sources present spe-
cial cases when using the mesh-current method. There are two  special cases, 
one that occurs when a current source is in a single mesh, and the other that 
occurs when a current source is shared by two adjacent meshes.
When a current source is in a single mesh, the value of the mesh cur-
rent is known, since it must equal the current of the source. Therefore, we 
label the mesh current with its value, and we do not need to write a KVL 
equation for that mesh. This leads to the following modification in Step 2 
of the mesh-current method.
Step 2: Label the mesh current for each mesh; if there is a current source in 
a single mesh, label the mesh current with the value of the current source.
This special case is illustrated in Example 4.8.

A Special Case in the Mesh-Current Method
Use the mesh-current method to find branch cur-
rents ia, ib, and ic in the circuit for Example 4.3, 
repeated here as Fig. 4.25.
Solution
 Step 1: Use directed arrows that traverse the mesh 
perimeters to identify the three mesh currents.
Step 2: Label the mesh currents as i1, i2 , and i3. The 
modification in Step 2 reminds us to look for cur-
rent sources, and the i3 mesh has a current source 
that is not shared by any other mesh. Therefore,  
the i3 mesh current equals the current supplied by 
the source. Note that i3 and the current source are

are shown in Fig. 4.26.
Step 3: Write the KVL equations for the meshes 
whose mesh currents are unknown, which in this 
 example are the i1 and i2  meshes. Remember to pick  
a starting point anywhere along the mesh, sum the 
voltages in the direction of the mesh current, and 
set the sum equal to zero when you return to the 
 starting point. The resulting simultaneous mesh cur-

These are the same branch current values as those

analysis methods is better when calculating the 
branch currents? Which method is better when cal-
culating the power associated with the sources?
Now we turn our attention to the other special case, created by a 
current source that is shared between two adjacent meshes. The circuit 
shown in Fig. 4.27 depicts this situation. Applying Steps 1 and 2, we define 
the mesh currents i
i

c  as well as the voltage across the 5 A cur-
rent source. In Step 3, we write the KVL equations for each mesh; let’s 
start with mesh a and pick the starting point just below the 100 V source. 
The first two voltages we encounter when we traverse the mesh in the 
direction of the mesh current are 100 V

to the current source, we must label the voltage drop across it as v and use

ducing a new concept, the supermesh.
 The Concept of a Supermesh
When a current source is shared between two meshes, we can combine 
these meshes to form a supermesh, which traverses the perimeters of the 
two meshes and avoids the branch containing the shared current source. 
Figure 4.28 illustrates the supermesh concept. Using a modified Step 3, 
we write a KVL equation around the supermesh (denoted by the dashed 
line), using the original mesh currents to give

We have two simultaneous equations, Eqs. 4.21 and 4.22, but

node- voltage method requires a KCL equation at the supernode and a  
supernode constraint equation that defines the difference between the node  
voltages in the supernode as the value of the voltage source in the super-
node. In a like manner, the presence of a supermesh in the mesh-current  
method requires a KVL equation around the supermesh and a supermesh 
constraint equation that defines the difference between the mesh currents 
in the supermesh as the value of the shared current source. From Fig. 4.28,

The final version of Steps 2 and 3 in the mesh-current method reminds us 
how to handle current sources in our circuits:
• Step 2: Label the mesh current for each mesh; if there is a current 
source in a single mesh, label the mesh current with the value of the 
source. If there is a current source shared between two meshes, create 
a supermesh by combining the two meshes and mentally erasing the 
current source.
• Step 3: Write a KVL equation around each supermesh and each sin-
gle mesh where the mesh current is unknown. If there is a dependent 
source, write a constraint equation defining the controlling quantity 
for the dependent source in terms of the mesh currents. If there is a 
supermesh, write a supermesh constraint equation that defines the 
difference between the two mesh currents in the supermesh as the 
value of the shared current source.
The final version of the mesh-current method can be found in the end-of-
chapter Summary; a condensed version is given in Analysis Method 4.6.

4.8 The Node-Voltage Method Versus 
the Mesh-Current Method
It is natural to ask, “When is the node-voltage method preferred to the 
mesh-current method and vice versa?” As you might suspect, there is no 
clear-cut answer. Asking a number of questions, however, may help you 
identify the more efficient method before plunging into the solution process:
• Does one of the methods result in fewer simultaneous equations to 
solve?
• Is there a branch between two essential nodes that contains only a 
voltage source? If so, making one of the essential nodes the refer-
ence node and using the node-voltage method reduces the number of 
equations to be solved.
• Is there a mesh containing a current source that is not shared with an 
adjacent mesh? If so, using the mesh-current method allows you to 
reduce the number of equations to be solved.
• Will solving some portion of the circuit give the requested solution? 
If so, which method is most efficient for solving just the pertinent 
portion of the circuit?
Perhaps the most important observation is that, for any situation, some 
time spent thinking about the problem in relation to the various analytical

approaches available is time well spent. Examples 4.10 and 4.11 illus-
trate the process of deciding between the node-voltage and mesh-current 
methods.
EXAMPLE 4.10 
 Understanding the Node-Voltage Method Versus  
Mesh-Current Method
Find the power dissipated in the 300 Ω resistor in 
the circuit shown in Fig. 4.31.
Solution
To find the power dissipated in the 300 Ω resistor, 
we need to find either the current in the resistor 
or the voltage across it. The mesh-current method 
yields the current in the resistor; this approach 
requires solving five mesh equations, as depicted in 
Fig. 4.32, and a dependent source constraint equa-
tion, for a total of six simultaneous equations.
Let’s now consider using the node-voltage 
method. The circuit has four essential nodes, and 
therefore only three node-voltage equations are 
required to describe the circuit. The dependent 
voltage source between two essential nodes forms a 
supernode, requiring a KCL equation and a super-
node constraint equation. We have to sum the cur-
rents at the remaining essential node, and we need to 
write the dependent source constraint equation, for a 
total of four simultaneous equations. Thus, the node- 
voltage method is the more attractive approach.
Step 1: We begin by identifying the four essential 
nodes in the circuit of Fig. 4.31. The three black dots 
at the bottom of the circuit identify a single essen-
tial node, and the three black dots in the middle of 
the circuit are the three remaining essential nodes.
Step 2: Select a reference node. Two essential 
nodes in the circuit in Fig.  4.31 merit consider-
ation. The first is the reference node in Fig. 4.33, 
where we also defined the three node voltages 
,

form a supernode because they are connected by 
a dependent voltage source. If the reference node 
in Fig. 4.33 is selected, one of the unknown node 
voltages is the voltage across the 300 Ω resistor, 
namely,

v  in Fig. 4.33. Once we know this voltage,  
we calculate the power in the 300 Ω resistor by 
using the expression

The second node worth considering as the ref-
erence node is the bottom node in the circuit, as 
shown in Fig. 4.34. If this reference node is chosen, 
one of the unknown node voltages is eliminated 
because

KCL equations and a dependent source constraint 
equation, and solve these three simultaneous equa-
tions. However, to find either the current in the

additional calculation once we know the node volt-

Techniques of Circuit Analysis
Find the voltage 
o
v  in the circuit shown in Fig. 4.35.
Solution
We first consider using the mesh-current method.
Step 1: Identify the three mesh currents in the circuit 
using directed arrows that follow the mesh perimeters.
Step 2: Label the three mesh currents. Because there 
are two current sources, each shared by two meshes, 
we can combine all three meshes into a single super-
mesh that traverses the perimeter of the entire circuit 
and avoids the two branches with current sources. The 
result of these two steps is shown in Fig. 4.36.

4.9 Source Transformations
We are always interested in methods that simplify circuits. Series-parallel 
reductions and ∆-to-Y transformations are already on our list of simpli-
fying techniques. We now expand the list with source transformations. A 
source transformation allows a voltage source in series with a resistor to 
be replaced by a current source in parallel with the same resistor or vice 
versa. Figure 4.38 shows a source transformation. The double-headed 
arrow emphasizes that a source transformation is bilateral; that is, we can 
start with either configuration and derive the other.
We need to find the relationship between 
s
v  and is that guarantees 
the two configurations in Fig. 4.38 are equivalent with respect to nodes a 
and b. Equivalence is achieved if any resistor RL has the same current and 
thus the same voltage drop, whether connected between nodes a and b in 
Fig. 4.38(a) or Fig. 4.38(b).

values of R .
L  If the current in RL is the same for both circuits, then the 
voltage drop across RL is the same for both circuits, and the circuits are 
equivalent at nodes a and b. If the polarity of 
s

tion of is must be reversed to maintain equivalence.
Example 4.12 uses source transformations to simplify a circuit- analysis 
problem.
EXAMPLE 4.12 
Using Source Transformations to Solve a Circuit
Find the power associated with the 6 V source for 
the circuit shown in Fig. 4.39 and state whether the 
6 V source is absorbing or delivering the power.
Solution
If we study the circuit shown in Fig. 4.39, we see 
ways to simplify the circuit by using source trans-
formations. But we must simplify the circuit in a 
way that preserves the branch containing the 6 V 
source. Therefore, begin on the right side of the cir-
cuit with the branch containing the 40 V source. We 
can transform the 40 V source in series with the 5 Ω 
resistor into an 8 A current source in parallel with a 
5 Ω resistor, as shown in Fig. 4.40(a).
Next, replace the parallel combination of the 
20 Ω and 5 Ω resistors with a 4 Ω resistor. This 4 Ω 
resistor is in parallel with the 8 A source and there-
fore can be replaced with a 32 V source in series 
with a 4 Ω resistor, as shown in Fig. 4.40(b). The 
32 V source is in series with 20 Ω of resistance and, 
hence, can be replaced by a current source of 1.6 A 
in parallel with 20 Ω, as shown in Fig. 4.40(c). The 
20 Ω and 30 Ω parallel resistors can be reduced to 
a single 12 Ω resistor. The parallel combination of 
the 1.6 A current source and the 12 Ω resistor trans-
forms into a voltage source of 19.2 V in series with 
12 Ω. Figure  4.40(d) shows the result of this last 
transformation. The current in the direction of the 
voltage drop across the 6 V source is 
−
(19.2
6)/16, 
or 0.825 A. Therefore, the power associated with 
the 6 V source is

and the voltage source is absorbing power.
Practice your circuit-analysis skills by using

you get the same answer.

Figure 4.40 ▲ Step-by-step simplification of the circuit shown in Fig. 4.39.
A couple of questions arise from the source transformation depicted 
in Fig. 4.40.
• What happens if there is a resistance Rp in parallel with the voltage 
source?
• What happens if there is a resistance Rs in series with the current 
source?
In both cases, the resistance can be removed to create a simpler equiva-
lent circuit with respect to terminals a and b. Figure 4.41 summarizes this 
observation. The two circuits depicted in Fig. 4.41(a) are equivalent with 
respect to terminals a and b because they produce the same voltage and 
current in any resistor RL inserted between nodes a and b. The same can 
be said for the circuits in Fig. 4.41(b). Example 4.13 illustrates an applica-
tion of the equivalent circuits depicted in Fig. 4.41.

Using Special Source Transformation Techniques
a) Use source transformations to find the voltage 
o
v  in the circuit shown in Fig. 4.42.
b) Find the power developed by the 250 V voltage 
source.
c) Find the power developed by the 8 A current 
source.
Solution
a) We begin by removing the 125 Ω and 10 Ω resis-
tors because the 125 Ω resistor is connected in par-
allel with the 250 V voltage source and the 10 Ω 
resistor is connected in series with the 8 A current 
source. We also combine the series- connected resis-
tors in the rightmost branch into a single resistance 
of 20 Ω. Figure 4.43 shows the simplified circuit.
Now use a source transformation to replace 
the series-connected 250 V source and 25 Ω resis-
tor with a 10 A source in parallel with the 25 Ω 
resistor, as shown in Fig.  4.44. We can then use

without affecting the terminal behavior of the 
circuit, these resistors play an important role in 
how the power is dissipated throughout the cir-
cuit. The current supplied by the 250 V source, 
 represented as si , equals the current in the 125 Ω

that connecting the toaster has on voltages or currents elsewhere in the 
circuit supplying the outlet. We can expand this interest in terminal 
behavior to a set of appliances, each requiring a different amount of 
power. We then are interested in how the voltage and current delivered 
at the outlet change as we change appliances. In other words, we want 
to focus on the behavior of the circuit supplying the outlet, but only at 
the outlet terminals.
Thévenin and Norton equivalents are circuit simplification tech-
niques. These equivalent circuits retain no information about the inter-
nal behavior of the original circuit and focus only on terminal behavior. 
They are extremely valuable when analyzing complex circuits where one 
portion of the circuit is fixed, so it can be replaced by a simple Thévenin 
or Norton equivalent, and another portion of the circuit is changing. 
Although here we discuss them as they pertain to resistive circuits, 
Thévenin and Norton equivalent circuits may be used to represent any 
circuit made up of linear elements.
The Thévenin equivalent circuit is the simplest equivalent for a 
given circuit and consists of a single voltage source in series with a sin-
gle resistor. The Norton equivalent circuit is the source transform of the 
Thévenin equivalent circuit. To better grasp the concept of a Thévenin 
equivalent circuit, imagine a circuit with a complex interconnection 
of resistors, independent sources, and dependent sources, as shown 
in Fig. 4.46(a). We are interested in simplifying this complex circuit 
with respect to the terminals a and b. The simplified equivalent circuit, 
shown in Fig. 4.46(b), is the series combination of a voltage source VTh 
and a resistor RTh called the Thévenin equivalent circuit. It is equiva-
lent to the original circuit in the sense that, if we connect the same load 
across the terminals a and b of each circuit, we get the same voltage and 
current at the terminals of the load. This equivalence holds for all pos-
sible values of load resistance.
The Thévenin Equivalent
To represent the original circuit by its Thévenin equivalent, we must cal-
culate the Thévenin voltage VTh and the Thévenin resistance R
.
Th  First, 
we note that if the load resistance is infinitely large, we have an open- 
circuit condition. The open-circuit voltage at the terminals a and b in the 
circuit shown in Fig. 4.46(b) is V .
Th  By hypothesis, this must be the same 
as the open-circuit voltage at the terminals a and b in the original circuit. 
Therefore, to find the Thévenin voltage V ,
Th  calculate the open-circuit 
voltage in the original circuit.
Reducing the load resistance to zero gives us a short-circuit condition. 
If we place a short circuit across the terminals a and b of the Thévenin 
equivalent circuit, the short-circuit current directed from a to b is
 
i

Hence, the Thévenin voltage for the circuit is 32 V.
The next step is to place a short circuit across the  
terminals a and b and calculate the resulting short- 
circuit current. Figure 4.48 shows the circuit with the 
short in place. Note that the short-circuit current is  
in the direction of the open-circuit voltage drop across 
the terminals a and b. If the short-circuit current is in 
the direction of the open-circuit voltage rise across the 
terminals, a minus sign must be inserted in Eq. 4.37.
The short-circuit current (isc) is found easily 
once 
2
v  is known. Therefore, the problem reduces 
to finding 
2
v  with the short in place. Again, if we 
use the lower node as the reference node, the KCL

Figure 4.49 shows the Thévenin equivalent for 
the circuit shown in Fig. 4.45.
You should verify that, if a 24 Ω resistor is con-
nected across the terminals a and b in Fig. 4.47, the 
voltage across the resistor will be 24 V and the current 
in the resistor will be 1 A, as would be the case with 
the Thévenin circuit in Fig. 4.49. This same equivalence 
between the circuits in Figs. 4.47 and 4.49 holds for any 
resistor value connected between nodes a and b.
The Norton Equivalent
A Norton equivalent circuit consists of an independent current source in 
parallel with the Norton equivalent resistance, as shown in Fig. 4.50. We can 
 derive it directly from the original circuit by calculating the open-circuit volt-
age and the short-circuit current, just as we did when calculating the Thévenin 
equivalent. The Norton current equals the short-circuit current at the ter-
minals of interest, and the Norton resistance is the ratio of the open-circuit 
 voltage to the short-circuit current, so it is identical to the Thévenin resistance:

If we already have a Thévenin equivalent circuit, we can derive the 
Norton equivalent circuit from it simply by making a source transformation.
Using Source Transformations
Sometimes we can use source transformations to derive a Thévenin or 
Norton equivalent circuit. This technique works best when the network 
contains only independent sources. Dependent sources require us to retain 
the identity of the controlling voltages and/or currents, and this constraint 
usually prohibits simplification of the circuit by source transformations. 
Work through Example 4.15 to see how a series of source transformations 
leads to a Norton equivalent circuit.
Gain additional practice with Thévenin equivalent circuits and see 
how to cope with the presence of a dependent source in the original circuit 
by working through Example 4.16.
EXAMPLE 4.15 
Finding a Norton Equivalent
Find the Norton equivalent of the circuit in Fig. 4.47 
by making a series of source transformations.
Solution
We start on the left side of the circuit and trans-
form the series-connected 25V source and 5 Ω 
resistor to a parallel-connected 5A source and 
5 Ω resistor, as shown in Step 1 of Fig. 4.51. Use 
KCL to combine the parallel-connected 5A and 
3A  sources into a single 8A source, and com-
bine the parallel-connected 5 Ω and 25 Ω resistors 
into a single 4 Ω resistor, as shown in Step 2 of 
Fig.  4.51. Now transform the parallel-connected 
8A source and 4 Ω resistor to a series-connected 
32 V source and 4 Ω resistor, and combine the two 
 series-connected 4 Ω resistors into a single 8 Ω 
 resistor, as shown in Step 3 of Fig. 4.51. Note that 
the result of Step 3 is the Thévenin equivalent cir-
cuit we derived in Example 4.14. Finally, transform 
the series-connected 32 V source and 8 Ω resis-
tor into a parallel-connected 4A source and 8 Ω 
resistor, which is the Norton equivalent circuit, as 
shown in Step 4 of Fig. 4.51.

Techniques of Circuit Analysis
Find the Thévenin equivalent for the circuit con-
taining dependent sources shown in Fig. 4.52.
Solution
The first step in analyzing the circuit in Fig. 4.52 is to 
recognize that the current labeled ix must be zero. 
(Note the absence of a return path for ix to enter the 
left-hand portion of the circuit.) The open-circuit, 
or Thévenin, voltage is the voltage across the 25 Ω 
resistor. Since i

To calculate the short-circuit current, we place 
a short circuit across a and b. When the terminals a 
and b are shorted together, the control voltage v  is 
reduced to zero. Therefore, with the short in place, 
the circuit shown in Fig.  4.52 becomes the one 
shown in Fig. 4.53. With the short circuit shunting 
the 25 Ω resistor, all of the current from the depen-
dent current source appears in the short, so

We can calculate the Thévenin resistance, RTh, directly from the circuit 
rather than calculating it as the ratio of the open-circuit voltage to the 
short-circuit current (Eq. 4.37). If the circuit contains only independent 
sources and resistors, we can determine RTh by deactivating all indepen-
dent sources and then calculating the resistance seen looking into the 
network at the designated terminal pair. A voltage source is deactivated 
by replacing it with a short circuit, while a current source is deactivated 
by replacing it with an open circuit. Example 4.17 illustrates this direct 
method for determining RTh.

Finding the Thévenin Equivalent Resistance Using a Test Source
Find the Thévenin resistance RTh for the circuit in

Solution
Begin by deactivating the independent voltage 
source and exciting the circuit from the terminals a 
and b with either a test voltage source or a test cur-
rent source. If we apply a test voltage source, we will 
know the voltage of the dependent voltage source 
and hence the controlling current i. Therefore, we 
opt for the test voltage source. Figure 4.57 shows 
the circuit for computing the Thévenin resistance.
The test voltage source is denoted

 and the 
current that it delivers to the circuit is labeled i .

whose value must be determined using the test source method. The proce-
dure is illustrated in Example 4.19.

Therefore, the Norton equivalent current is zero, 
and the Norton equivalent circuit consists only of 
the Norton resistance, RN . Applying a test source 
to the terminals a and b is the only way to deter-
mine RN . We have applied a test current source, 
whose value is iT , as shown in Fig. 4.59. Analyze

We conclude this discussion of Thévenin and Norton equivalents with 
one final example of their application in circuit analysis. Sometimes we 
can use a Thévenin equivalent to simplify one portion of a circuit, thereby 
greatly simplifying analysis of the larger network. Let’s return to the 
amplifier circuit first introduced in Section 2.5 and subsequently analyzed 
in Sections 4.4 and 4.7. Study Example 4.20 to see how a Thévenin equiv-
alent of one portion of this circuit helps us in the analysis of the whole 
circuit.

4.12 Maximum Power Transfer
Circuit analysis plays an important role in the analysis of systems designed 
to transfer power from a source to a load. This text discusses power trans-
fer in two basic types of systems.
• Systems Optimized for Maximum Efficiency Power utility systems 
are a good example of this type because they generate, transmit, and 
distribute large quantities of electric power. If a power utility system 
is inefficient, a large percentage of the power generated is lost in the 
transmission and distribution processes, and thus wasted. We will 
look at these types of systems in Sections 9.10 and 9.11.
• Systems Optimized for Maximum Power Communication and instru-
mentation systems are good examples because when information 
(data) is transmitted via electric signals, the power available at the 
transmitter or detector is limited. Thus, transmitting as much of this 
power as possible to the receiver (load) is desirable. In such applica-
tions, the amount of power being transferred is small, so the transfer 
efficiency is not a primary concern. Here we consider maximum power 
transfer in systems that can be modeled by a purely resistive circuit.

4.12 Maximum Power Transfer 
127
Maximum power transfer can best be described with the aid of the circuit 
shown in Fig. 4.63. We assume a resistive network containing independent and  
dependent sources and a designated pair of terminals, a and b, to which a load, 
R ,
L  is connected. The problem is to determine the value of RL that permits max-
imum power delivery to R .
L  The first step in this process is to recognize that a 
resistive network can always be replaced by its Thévenin equivalent. Therefore, 
we redraw the circuit shown in Fig. 4.63 as the one shown in Fig. 4.64. Replacing 
the original network by its Thévenin equivalent greatly simplifies the task of 
finding R .
L  To derive RL, begin by expressing the power dissipated in RL as a 
function of the three circuit parameters V

4.13 Superposition
A linear system obeys the principle of superposition, which states that 
whenever a linear system is excited, or driven, by more than one inde-
pendent source of energy, the total response is the sum of the individual 
responses. An individual response is the result of an independent source 
acting alone. Because we are dealing with circuits made up of intercon-
nected linear-circuit elements, we can apply the principle of superposition 
directly to the analysis of such circuits when they are driven by more than 
one independent energy source. At present, we restrict the discussion to 
simple resistive networks; however, the principle is applicable to any lin-
ear system.
Superposition is applied in both the analysis and design of circuits. In 
analyzing a complex circuit with multiple independent voltage and current 
sources, there are often fewer, simpler equations to solve when the effects 
of the independent sources are considered one at a time. Applying super-
position can thus simplify circuit analysis. Be aware, though, that some-
times applying superposition actually complicates the analysis, producing 
more equations to solve than with an alternative method. Superposition 
is required only if the independent sources in a circuit are fundamentally 
different. In these early chapters, all independent sources are dc sources, 
so superposition is not required. We introduce superposition here in antic-
ipation of later chapters in which circuits will require it.
Superposition is applied in design to synthesize a desired circuit 
response that could not be achieved in a circuit with a single source. If the 
desired circuit response can be written as a sum of two or more terms, the 
response can be realized by including one independent source for each 
term of the response. This approach to the design of circuits with complex 
responses allows a designer to consider several simple designs instead of 
one complex design.
We demonstrate the superposition principle in Example 4.22.
EXAMPLE 4.22 
Using Superposition to Solve a Circuit
Use the superposition principle to find the branch 
currents in the circuit shown in Fig. 4.67.
We can easily find the branch currents in the cir-
cuit in Fig. 4.68 once we know the node voltage across 
the 3 Ω resistor. Denoting this voltage

Solution
We begin by finding the branch currents resulting 
from the 120 V voltage source. We denote those 
currents with a prime. Replacing the ideal current 
source with an open circuit deactivates it; Fig. 4.68 
shows this. The branch currents in this circuit are 
the result of only the voltage source.

To find the component of the branch currents 
resulting from the current source, we deactivate the 
ideal voltage source and solve the circuit shown in 
Fig.  4.69. The double-prime notation for the cur-
rents indicates they are the components of the total 
current resulting from the ideal current source.
We determine the branch currents in the cir-
cuit shown in Fig. 4.69 by first solving for the node 
voltages across the 3 and 4 Ω resistors, respec-
tively. Figure  4.70 shows the two node voltages.

Practical Perspective
Circuits with Realistic Resistors
It is not possible to fabricate identical electrical components. For exam-
ple, resistors produced from the same manufacturing process can vary 
in value by as much as 20%. Therefore, in creating an electrical system, 
the designer must consider the impact that component variation will 
have on the performance of the system. Sensitivity analysis permits the 
designer to calculate the impact of variations in the component values 
on the output of the system. We will see how this information enables a 
designer to specify an acceptable component value tolerance for each 
of the system’s components.
Consider the circuit shown in Fig.  4.74. We will use sensitivity 
analysis to determine the sensitivity of the node voltages 
1
v  and 
2
v  to 
changes in the resistor R1. Using the node-voltage method, we derive 
the expressions for 
1
v  and 
2
v  as functions of the circuit resistors and 
source currents. The results are given in Eqs. 4.45 and 4.46d:

Therefore, if R1 is 10% less than its nominal value, our analysis pre-

We attempt to confirm the results in Eqs. 4.53 and 4.54 by substituting the

 into Eqs. 4.45 and 4.46. When we do, the results are
23.4780 V,
1 =

2 =

Why is there a difference between the values predicted from the sensi-
tivity analysis and the exact values computed by substituting for R1 in 
the equations for 
1
v  and 
2
v ? We can see from Eqs. 4.47 and 4.48 that 
the sensitivity of 
1
v  and 
2
v  with respect to R1 is a function of R1 be-
cause R1 appears in the denominator of both Eqs. 4.47 and 4.48. This 
means that as R1 changes, the sensitivities change; hence, we cannot 
expect Eqs. 4.47 and 4.48 to give exact results for large changes in R .
1  
Note that for a 10% change in R1, the percent error between the pre-
dicted and exact values of 
1
v  and 
2
v  is small. Specifically, the percent 
error in 
0.2713%
1 =
v
 and the percent error in 
0.0676%
2 =
v
.
From this example, we can see that a tremendous amount of work 
is involved if we are to determine the sensitivity of 
1
v  and 
2
v  to changes 
in the remaining component values, namely, R2, R3, R4, I g1, and I g2. 
Fortunately, PSpice3 has a sensitivity function that will perform sensi-
tivity analysis for us. The sensitivity function in PSpice calculates two 
types of sensitivity. The first is known as the one-unit sensitivity, and 
the second is known as the 1% sensitivity. In the example circuit, a one-
unit change in a resistor would change its value by 1 Ω and a one-unit 
change in a current source would change its value by 1 A. In contrast, 
1% sensitivity analysis determines the effect of changing resistors or 
sources by 1% of their nominal values.
The result of PSpice sensitivity analysis of the circuit in Fig. 4.69 is 
shown in Table 4.2. Because we are analyzing a linear circuit, we can

In both cases, our predictions are within a fraction of a volt of the actual 
node-voltage values.
Circuit designers use the results of sensitivity analysis to determine 
which component value variation has the greatest impact on the out-
put of the circuit. As we can see from the PSpice sensitivity analysis 
in Table 4.2, the node voltages 
1
v  and 
2
v  are much more sensitive to 
changes in R2 than to changes in R1. Specifically, 1
v  is (5.417/0.5833) or 
approxi mately 9 times more sensitive to changes in R2 than to changes 
in R1, and 
2
v  is (6.5/0.5) or 13 times more sensitive to changes in R2 
than to changes in R1. Hence, in the example circuit, the tolerance on 
R2 must be more stringent than the tolerance on R1 if it is important to 
keep 
1
v  and 
2
v  close to their nominal values.
SELF-CHECK: Assess your understanding of this Practical Perspective 
by trying Chapter Problems 4.105–4.107.
Summary
• For the topics in this chapter, mastery of some basic terms, 
and the concepts they represent, is necessary. Those terms 
are node, essential node, path, branch, essential branch, 
mesh, and planar circuit. Table 4.1 provides definitions 
and examples of these terms. (See page 95.)
• Two new circuit analysis techniques were introduced in 
this chapter:
• The node-voltage method works with both planar 
and nonplanar circuits. The steps in the node-voltage 
method are in Table 4.3. (See page 135.)
• The mesh-current method works only with planar 
circuits. The steps in the mesh-current method are in 
Table 4.3. (See page 135.)
• Several new circuit simplification techniques were 
introduced in this chapter:
• Source transformations allow us to exchange a volt-
age source (
s
v ) and a series resistor (R) for a current 
source (is) and a parallel resistor (R) and vice  versa. 
The combinations must be equivalent in terms of 
their terminal voltage and current. Terminal equiva-
lence holds, provided that

TABLE 4.3 Steps in the Node-Voltage Method and the Mesh-Current Method
Node-Voltage Method
Mesh-Current Method
Step 1
Identify nodes/meshes
Identify the essential nodes by circling them 
on the circuit diagram.
Identify the meshes by drawing directed 
arrows inside each mesh.
Step 2
Label node voltages/mesh currents
Recognize special cases
Pick and label a reference node; then label 
the remaining essential node voltages.
• If a voltage source is the only component 
in a branch connecting the reference 
node and another essential node, label 
the essential node with the value of the 
voltage source.
• If a voltage source is the only component 
in a branch connecting two  nonreference 
essential nodes, create a supernode that 
includes the voltage source and the two 
nodes on either side.
Label each mesh current.
• If a current source is in a single mesh, 
label the mesh current with the value of 
the current source.
• If a current source is shared by two 
adjacent meshes, create a supermesh by 
combining the two adjacent meshes and 
temporarily eliminating the branch that 
contains the current source.
Step 3
Write the equations
Write the following equations:
• A KCL equation for any supernodes;
• A KCL equation for any remaining 
essential nodes where the voltage is 
unknown;
• A constraint equation for each dependent 
source that defines the controlling vari-
able for the dependent source in terms of 
the node voltages;
• A constraint equation for each supernode 
that equates the difference between the 
two node voltages in the supernode to the 
voltage source in the supernode.
Write the following equations:
• A KVL equation for any supermeshes;
• A KVL equation for any remaining 
meshes where the current is unknown;
• A constraint equation for each dependent 
source that defines the controlling vari-
able for the dependent source in terms of 
the mesh currents;
• A constraint equation for each supermesh 
that equates the difference between the 
two mesh currents in the supermesh to 
the current source eliminated to form the 
supermesh.
Step 4
Solve the equations
Solve the equations to find the node 
voltages.
Solve the equations to find the mesh 
 currents.
Step 5
Solve for other unknowns
Use the node voltage values to find any 
unknown voltages, currents, or powers.
Use the mesh current values to find any 
unknown voltages, currents, or powers.
• Thévenin equivalents and Norton equivalents allow us 
to simplify a circuit composed of sources and resistors 
into an equivalent circuit consisting of a voltage source 
and a series resistor (Thévenin) or a current source and 
a parallel resistor (Norton). The simplified circuit and 
the original circuit must be equivalent in terms of their 
terminal voltage and current. Note that
• The Thévenin voltage (VTh) is the open-circuit volt-
age across the terminals of the original circuit;
• The Thévenin resistance (RTh) is the ratio of the 
Thévenin voltage to the current in a short circuit con-
necting the terminals of the original circuit;
• The Norton equivalent is obtained by performing a 
source transformation on a Thévenin equivalent.
(See pages 118–121.)
• Maximum power transfer is a technique for calculating 
the maximum value of p that can be delivered to a load, 
RL. Maximum power transfer occurs when

The equation for the maximum power transferred is

(See pages 126–127.)
• In a circuit with multiple independent sources,  
superposition allows us to activate one source at a time 
and calculate voltages and currents due to each source. 
To determine the voltages and currents that exist when 
all independent sources are active, sum the voltages 
and currents that resulted from each of the sources. 
Dependent sources are never deactivated when apply-
ing superposition. (See page 129.)

CHAPTER 
The Operational Amplifier
This chapter analyzes circuits containing sources, resistors, and 
a new component, the operational amplifier (op amp). Unlike 
sources and resistors, the op amp is not an ideal basic circuit ele-
ment. Instead, it is a complicated integrated circuit consisting of 
many electronic components such as transistors and diodes that 
are beyond the scope of this text. We can use op amps in intro-
ductory circuits, however, by taking a black box approach that 
focuses solely on the terminal behavior of the op amp (not on its 
internal structure or the currents and voltages that exist in this 
structure).
Operational amplifier circuits were first used as basic build-
ing blocks in analog computers. The term operational refers to 
op amp circuits that implement mathematical operations such as 
integration, differentiation, addition, sign changing, and scaling. 
While the range of applications has broadened beyond im ple-
menting mathematical operations, the original name for the cir-
cuit persists.
We do not introduce new circuit analysis techniques in this 
chapter. Instead, we apply tools we have already introduced to 
analyze and design interesting and useful op amp circuits that 
perform scaling, addition, and subtraction. Once we introduce 
inductors and capacitors in Chapter 6, we will present op amp 
circuits that integrate and differentiate electric signals.
Initially, we employ an ideal model of the op amp’s terminal 
behavior. At the conclusion of this chapter, we consider a more 
realistic op amp model that employs a dependent source. This 
provides additional opportunities to practice analyzing circuits 
with these sources.

Strain Gages
How could you measure the amount of bending in metal 
cables, such as the ones shown in the figure, without 
physically contacting the cables? One method uses a 
strain gage, which is a type of transducer. A transducer is  
a device that measures a quantity by converting it into a 
more convenient form. The quantity we wish to  measure 
in the metal bar is the bending angle, but measuring the 
angle directly is quite difficult and could even be danger-
ous. Instead, we attach a strain gage (shown in the line 
drawing here) to the metal bar. A strain gage is a grid of 
thin wires whose resistance changes when the wires are 
lengthened or shortened, according to the equation
∆
=
∆
R
R
L
L
2
,
where R  is the resistance of the gage at rest, ∆L L  is the 
fractional lengthening of the gage (which is the definition  
of strain), 2 is a constant typical of the manufacturer’s 
gage factor, and 
R
∆
 is the change in resistance due to  
the bending of the bar. Typically, pairs of strain gages 
are attached to opposite sides of a bar. When the bar is 
bent, the wires in one pair of gages get longer and thinner, 
increasing the resistance, while the wires in the other pair of  
gages get shorter and thicker, decreasing the resistance.
How can the change in resistance be measured? One 
way would be to use an ohmmeter. However, the change 
in resistance experienced by the strain gage is typically 
much smaller than an ohmmeter can measure accurately. 
Usually, the pairs of strain gages are connected to form 
a Wheatstone bridge, and the voltage difference between 
two legs of the bridge is measured. We use an op amp 
circuit to amplify, or increase, the voltage difference to 
make an accurate measurement. After we introduce oper-
ational amplifiers and some of the important circuits that 
employ them, we conclude with an analysis of a strain 
gage circuit that measures the bending in the metal bar.

5.1 Operational Amplifier Terminals
We begin by looking at the terminal behavior of a commercially available 
op amp, the A 741.
µ
 Fairchild Semiconductor introduced this widely used  
device in 1968. This op amp is available in several different packages. For 
our discussion, we assume an eight-lead DIP.1 Figure 5.1 shows a top view 
of the package, with the terminals, their names, and numbers. We focus 
on the following terminals:
• inverting input,
• noninverting input,
• output,
• positive power supply V
(
),
+
• negative power supply V
(
).
−
The remaining three terminals are of little or no concern. The two offset 
null terminals may be used in an auxiliary circuit that compensates for 
performance degradation owing to aging and imperfections. These termi-
nals are seldom used because degradation is usually negligible. Terminal 8 
is an unused terminal; NC stands for no connection, which means that the 
terminal is not connected to the op amp circuit.
Figure 5.2 shows a common circuit symbol for an op amp that con-
tains the five terminals of primary interest. Because word labels are 
inconvenient in circuit diagrams, we simplify the terminal designations in 
the following way. The noninverting input terminal is labeled plus +
( ), 
and the inverting input terminal is labeled minus −
( ). The power supply 
 terminals, which are always drawn outside the triangle, are marked 
+
V  
and V .
− The terminal at the apex of the triangle is always understood to 
be the output terminal. Figure 5.3 summarizes these simplifications.
 5.2 Terminal Voltages and Currents
We now describe the behavior of the op amp using the terminal voltages 
and currents. The voltage variables are measured from a common refer-
ence node.2 Figure 5.4 shows the five voltage variables with their refer-
ence polarities.
All voltages are considered as voltage rises from the common node, a 
convention we also used in the node-voltage analysis method. A positive  
supply voltage (VCC) is connected between 
+
V  and the common node. A 
negative supply voltage (−VCC) is connected between 
−
V  and the common 
node. The voltage between the inverting input terminal and the common 
node is denoted 
.
n
v
 The voltage between the noninverting input terminal  
and the common node is designated as 
.
p
v
 The voltage between the output  
terminal and the common node is denoted 
.
o
v
Figure 5.5 shows the current variables with their reference directions, 
all of which are into the terminals of the operational amplifier: in is the 
current into the inverting input terminal; i p is the current into the nonin-
verting input terminal; io is the current into the output terminal; 
+
ic  is the 
current into the positive power supply terminal; and 
−
ic  is the current into 
the negative power supply terminal.
1 DIP is an abbreviation for dual in-line package. This means that the terminals on each side 
of the package are in line and that the terminals on opposite sides of the package also line up.
2 The common node is external to the op amp. It is the reference terminal of the circuit in 
which the op amp is embedded.

The terminal behavior of the op amp as a linear circuit element is 
characterized by constraints on the input voltages and the input currents. 
The voltage constraint is derived from the voltage transfer characteristic 
of the op amp integrated circuit, pictured in Fig. 5.6.
The voltage transfer characteristic describes how the output voltage 
varies as a function of the input voltages—that is, how voltage is trans-
ferred from the input to the output. Note that the op amp’s output voltage 
is a function of the difference between its input voltages,

(5.1)
We see from Fig. 5.6 and Eq. 5.1 that the op amp has three distinct 
regions of operation: negative saturation, linear region, and positive sat-
uration. When the magnitude of the input voltage difference ( 
p
n
−
v
v
 ) 
is small, the op amp behaves as a linear device, so the output voltage is a 
linear function of the input voltages. More specifically, the output voltage  
is equal to the difference between the input voltages times the multiplying  
constant, or gain, A. Outside this linear region are two saturation  regions. 
When the output of the op amp saturates, the op amp behaves as a 
 nonlinear device; its output voltage is no longer a linear function of the 
input voltages.
Op Amp Input Voltage Constraints
When we confine the op amp to its linear operating region, a constraint is 
imposed on the input voltages, 
p
v  and 
.
n
v
 The constraint is based on typi-
cal numerical values for VCC and A in Eq. 5.1. For most op amps, the rec-
ommended dc power supply voltages seldom exceed 20 V, and the gain, 
A, is rarely less than 10,000, or 10 .
4  We see from both Fig. 5.6 and Eq. 5.1 
that in the linear region, the magnitude of the input voltage difference 
( 
p
n
−
v
v
 ) must be less than 20 10 ,
4  or 2 mV.
Node voltages in the circuits we study are typically much larger than 
2 mV, so a voltage difference of less than 2 mV means the two voltages 
are essentially equal. Thus, when an op amp is constrained to its linear 
operating region and the node voltages are much larger than 2 mV, the 
constraint on the input voltages of the op amp is

(5.2)
Note that Eq. 5.2 characterizes the relationship between the input volt-
ages for an ideal op amp—that is, an op amp whose value of A is infinite.
We can use Eq. 5.2 only if the op amp is confined to its linear oper-
ating region. The op amp stays in its linear region if the op amp circuit 
includes a signal path from the op amp’s output terminal to its inverting 
input terminal. This configuration is known as negative feedback because 
the signal is fed back from the output and is subtracted from the input 
signal. The negative feedback causes the input voltage difference to 
decrease. Because the output voltage is proportional to the input voltage 
difference, the output voltage is also decreased, and the op amp operates 
in its linear region.

The Operational Amplifier
If a circuit containing an op amp does not provide a negative feedback 
path from the op amp output to the inverting input, then the op amp will 
normally saturate. But even if the circuit provides a negative feedback 
path for the op amp, linear operation is not guaranteed. So how do we 
know whether the op amp is operating in its linear region?
The answer is, we don’t! We deal with this dilemma by assuming linear 
operation, performing the circuit analysis, and then checking our results 
for contradictions. For example, suppose we assume that an op amp in a 
circuit is operating in its linear region, and we compute the output voltage 
of the op amp to be 10 V. On examining the circuit, we discover that VCC 
is 6 V, resulting in a contradiction, because the op amp’s output voltage 
can be no larger than V
.
CC  Thus, our assumption of linear operation was 
invalid, and the op amp output must be saturated at 6 V.
We have identified a constraint on the input voltages that is based on 
the voltage transfer characteristic of the op amp, the assumption that the 
op amp is restricted to its linear operating region, and typical values for 
VCC
3 and A. Equation 5.2 represents the voltage constraint for an ideal op 
amp, that is, with a value of A that is infinite.
Op Amp Input Current Constraints
We now turn our attention to the constraint on the input currents. Analysis of 
the op amp integrated circuit reveals that the equivalent resistance seen by the 
input terminals of the op amp is very large, typically 1 MΩ or more. Ideally, 
the equivalent input resistance is infinite, resulting in the current constraint
3 The positive and negative power supply voltages do not have to be equal in magnitude.  
In the linear operating region, v o  must lie between the two supply voltages. For example, if

Note that the current constraint is not based on assuming that the op amp 
is confined to its linear operating region, as was the voltage constraint. 
Together, Eqs. 5.2 and 5.3 form the constraints on terminal behavior that 
define our ideal op amp model.

The equation for i  o tells us that, even though the current at the input ter-

When we use Eqs. 5.2 and 5.3 in analyzing a circuit with an op amp, 
we are effectively using an ideal model of that op amp. Let’s summarize 
the circuit analysis steps:
Step 1:  Check for the presence of a negative feedback path; if it exists, we 
can assume the op amp is operating in its linear region.
ANALYZING A CIRCUIT WITH 
AN IDEAL OP AMP
1. Check for a negative feedback path.  
If it exists, assume the op amp operates  
in its linear region.
2. Write a KCL equation at the inverting 
input terminal.
3. Solve the KCL equation and use the 
solution to find the op amp’s output voltage.
4. Compare the op amp’s output voltage 
to the power supply voltages to determine 
if the op amp is operating in its linear region 
or if it is saturated.

amp circuit with a negative feedback path.

Step 2:  Write a KCL equation at the inverting input terminal, using the 
input current constraint (Eq. 5.3), the value of 
n
v  (Eq. 5.2), and 
Ohm’s law to find the currents. This equation will usually contain 
the unknown voltage at the op amp’s output terminal.
Step 3:  Solve the KCL equation and calculate the voltage at the op amp’s 
output terminal.
Step 4:  Compare the voltage at the op amp’s output terminal to the power 
supply voltages to determine whether the op amp is actually in its 
linear region or whether it has saturated.
These steps are summarized in Analysis Method 5.1. Example 5.1 
 analyzes an op amp circuit using this analysis method.

a) Step 1:  A negative feedback path exists from the 
op amp’s output to its inverting input through 
the 100 kΩ resistor, so we assume the op amp is 
confined to its linear operating region.

5.3 The Inverting-Amplifier Circuit
This section and the three that follow present some important op amp 
circuits. We begin with the inverting-amplifier circuit, shown in Fig. 5.8. 
This circuit contains an ideal op amp, two resistors (Rf  and Rs), a voltage 
source (
),

v
 and a short circuit connecting the noninverting input terminal 
and the common node.
We can analyze this circuit to obtain an expression for the output volt-
age,

note the circuit’s negative feedback path, so assume the op amp is in its

 Hence, we  
call this circuit an inverting amplifier.
Using Step 4, we see that the result given by Eq. 5.4 is valid only if 
the op amp shown in the circuit in Fig. 5.8 is operating in its linear region. 
Even if the op amp is not ideal, Eq. 5.4 is a good approximation. (We 
demonstrate this in Section 5.7.) Equation 5.4 specifies the gain of the 
inverting amplifier with the external resistors Rf  and R .

In the inverting amplifier circuit shown in Fig. 5.8, the resistor Rf  pro-
vides the negative feedback connection. That is, it connects the output ter-
minal to the inverting input terminal. If Rf  is removed, the feedback path 
is opened and the amplifier is said to be operating open loop. Figure 5.9 
shows the open-loop operation.
Opening the feedback path drastically changes the behavior of the 
circuit. To understand the open-loop circuit, we do not replace the op amp 
with its ideal model; although A and the input resistance are both large, 
they are not infinite. Now the output voltage is

5.4 The Summing-Amplifier Circuit

output voltage of a summing amplifier is an inverted, scaled sum of the 
voltages applied to the input of the amplifier. We can find the relationship

The summing amplifier has a negative feedback path that includes  
the resistor R   f, so in Step 1 we assume the op amp is in its linear region.

Although we analyzed the summing amplifier with three input sig-

needed. For example, you might wish to sum 16 individually recorded 
audio signals to form a single audio signal. The summing-amplifier config-
uration in Fig. 5.11 could include 16 different input resistors whose values 
specify different amplification factors for each of the input audio tracks. 
The summing amplifier thus plays the role of an audio mixer. As with

5.5 The Noninverting-Amplifier Circuit
Figure  5.13 depicts a noninverting-amplifier circuit. We use Analysis 
Method 5.1 to find the expression for the output voltage as a func-
tion of the source voltage v   g. Starting with Step 1, we note that the 
 noninverting- amplifier circuit has a negative feedback path with the resis-
tor R   f, so we assume that the op amp is in its linear region. In Step 2, the 
voltage constraint equation (Eq. 5.2) tells us that 
.
n
p
=
v
v
 However, the 
voltage at the noninverting terminal is not 0 because the terminal is not 
connected to the common node. The current constraint equation (Eq. 5.3) 
tells us the noninverting input current is zero. Since this current equals the 
current in the resistor R   g, there is no voltage drop across R   g and 
p
g
=
v
v . 
Therefore, 
n

5.6 The Difference-Amplifier Circuit
The output voltage of a difference amplifier is proportional to the dif-
ference between the two input voltages. To demonstrate, we analyze the 
difference-amplifier circuit shown in Fig. 5.15, using Analysis Method 5.1. 
In Step 1, we note the negative feedback path that includes the resistor R   b 
and thereby assume the op amp is in its linear region. In Step 2, we use the 
voltage constraint equation (Eq. 5.2) to recognize that 
n
p
=
v
v . Now we 
need an expression for v   p. Let’s focus on the subcircuit at the noninverting 
input; employing the current constraint equation (Eq. 5.3), we note that 
there is no current into the noninverting input. Therefore, the current in 
the v   b source remains in the loop containing that source and the resistors 
R   c and R   d. The voltage at the noninverting terminal is the voltage across 
R   d, which we can find using voltage division:

input, which is the difference between the two input voltages in Fig. 5.15:

5.6 The Difference-Amplifier  ircuit

Thus, an ideal difference amplifier has A

 amplifies only the dif-
ferential mode portion of the input voltage, and eliminates the common 
mode portion of the input voltage. Figure 5.17 shows a  difference-amplifier 
circuit with differential mode and common mode input voltages in place 
of 
a
v  and 
.

Equation 5.16 provides an important perspective on the function of 
the difference amplifier. In many applications it is the differential mode 
signal that contains the information of interest, while the common mode 
signal represents the noise found in all electric signals. For example, an 
electrocardiograph electrode measures the voltages produced by your 
body that regulate your heartbeat. These voltages have very small magni-
tudes compared with the electrical noise that the electrode picks up from 
lights and other electrical equipment in the room. The noise appears as 
the common mode portion of the measured voltage, whereas the heart 
rate voltages comprise the differential mode portion. Thus, an ideal dif-
ference amplifier (one whose resistors satisfy Eq. 5.9) amplifies only the 
voltage of interest and suppresses the noise.
Measuring Difference-Amplifier Performance—  
The Common Mode Rejection Ratio
An ideal difference amplifier has zero common mode gain and nonzero 
(and usually large) differential mode gain. Two factors influence the ideal 
common mode gain—resistance mismatches (that is, Eq. 5.9 is not sat-
isfied) or a nonideal op amp (that is, Eqs. 5.2 and 5.3 are not satisfied). 
We focus first on how resistance mismatches affect the performance of a 
difference amplifier.
Suppose that resistor values are chosen that do not precisely satisfy 
Eq. 5.9. Instead, the relationship among the resistors R

The second reason for nonzero common mode gain is a nonideal op 
amp. Remember that the op amp is itself a difference amplifier because 
in the linear operating region, its output is proportional to the difference 
of its inputs; that is, 
A(

 The output of a nonideal op amp 
is not strictly proportional to the difference between the inputs (the dif-
ferential mode input) but also includes a common mode signal. Internal 
mismatches in the integrated circuit components make the behavior of 
the op amp nonideal, in the same way that the resistor mismatches in the 
 difference-amplifier circuit make its behavior nonideal. Even though a 
discussion of nonideal op amps is beyond the scope of this text, note that 
the CMRR is used to rate op amps in practice by assessing how nearly 
ideal an op amp’s behavior is.
 Example 5.6 examines how resistor mismatches affect the CMRR of 
a difference amplifier.

fier designed in Example 5.5, shown in Fig. 5.16, 
is 10% larger than its nominal value. All other 
resistor values are unchanged. Calculate the 
common mode gain, the difference mode gain, 
and the CMRR for the difference amplifier.
b) Repeat part (a) assuming the R   d resistor value is

 5.7  A More Realistic Model for the

We now consider a more realistic model, shown in Fig. 5.18, that predicts 
the performance of an op amp in its linear region of operation. This model 
includes three modifications to the ideal op amp: (1) a finite input resistance, 
R ;
i  (2) a finite open-loop gain, A; and (3) a nonzero output resistance, R .

 (Eq. 5.3) are invalid. Equation 5.1  
is also invalid because the output resistance, R   o, is not zero.
Although the presence of A, Ri, and Ro makes op amp circuit anal-
ysis more cumbersome, it remains straightforward. To illustrate, we 
use the equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 5.18 when analyzing both an 
inverting and a noninverting amplifier. We begin with the inverting 
amplifier.
Analyzing an Inverting-Amplifier Circuit Using  
a More Realistic Op Amp Model
The circuit for the inverting amplifier, using the op amp circuit shown 
in Fig. 5.18, is depicted in Fig. 5.19. We can find the output voltage,

as a function of the source voltage, v    s, by writing two KCL equations 
at the nodes labeled a and b in Fig. 5.19. Note that

Strain Gages
 hanges in the shape of elastic solids are of great importance to engi-
neers who design structures such as aircraft frames that twist, stretch, 
or bend when subjected to external forces. To use strain gages, you 
need information about the physical structure of the gage, methods of 
bonding the gage to the surface of the structure, and the orientation 
of the gage relative to the forces exerted on the structure. Strain gage 
measurements are important in many engineering applications, and 
knowledge of electric circuits is germane to their proper use.
The circuit shown in Fig.  5.22 provides one way to measure the 
change in resistance experienced by strain gages in applications like 
the one in the chapter opener. As we will see, this circuit is the familiar 
difference amplifier, with the strain gage bridge providing the two volt-
ages whose difference is amplified. The pair of strain gages that are 
lengthened once the bar is bent have the values 
+ ∆

feeding the difference amplifier, whereas the pair of strain gages that are 
shortened have the values

cover the relationship between the output voltage, vo, and the change in 
resistance, ∆R, experienced by the strain gages.
To begin, assume that the op amp is ideal. Writing the K L equa-
tions at the inverting and noninverting input terminals of the op amp, we

Summary
• The operational amplifier (op amp) is a complex elec-
tronic circuit with two input terminals, two power 
 supply terminals, and one output terminal. The voltage 
at the inverting input terminal is v  n, the voltage at the 
 noninverting input terminal is v  p, and the voltage at  
the output terminal is v  o, all with respect to a common 
node. The current into the inverting input terminal is i   n, 
while the current into the noninverting input terminal is i   p. 
(See page 152.)

teristic of an ideal op amp is

where A is a proportionality constant known as the 
open-loop gain, and VCC represents the power supply 
voltages. (See page 153.)

(See page 153.)
• A voltage constraint exists when the op amp is con-

made—meaning A is assumed to be infinite—the ideal 
op amp model is characterized by the voltage constraint

(See page 154.)
• To analyze an ideal op amp circuit, follow these steps:
• Check for the presence of a negative feedback path; 
if it exists, we can assume the op amp is operating in 
its linear region.
• Write a KCL equation at the inverting input termi-
nal, using the input current constraint (Eq. 5.3), the 
value of 
n
v , and Ohm’s law to find the currents. This 
equation will usually contain the unknown voltage at 
the op amp’s output terminal.
• Solve the KCL equation and determine the voltage 
at the op amp’s output terminal.
• Compare the voltage at the op amp’s output terminal 
to the power supply voltages to determine whether 
the op amp is actually in its linear region or whether 
it has saturated.
• An inverting amplifier is an op amp circuit producing an 
output voltage that is an inverted, scaled replica of the 
input. (See page 156.)
• A summing amplifier is an op amp circuit producing an 
output voltage that is a scaled sum of the input voltages. 
(See page 158.)
• A noninverting amplifier is an op amp circuit producing 
an output voltage that is a scaled replica of the input 
voltage. (See page 160.)

• A difference amplifier is an op amp circuit producing 
an output voltage that is a scaled replica of the input 
voltage difference. (See page 162.)

mode voltage inputs,

(See page 166.)
• We considered both a simple, ideal op amp model and 
a more realistic model in this chapter. The differences 
between the two models are as follows:
Simplified Model
More Realistic Model
Infinite input resistance
Finite input resistance
Infinite open-loop gain

CHAPTER 
Inductance, Capacitance, 
and Mutual Inductance
Here we introduce inductors and capacitors, the last two ideal 
circuit elements mentioned in Chapter  2. Fortunately, the circuit- 
analysis techniques you learned in Chapters 3 and 4 apply to circuits 
containing inductors and capacitors as well. Once you understand the 
terminal behavior of these elements in terms of current and voltage, 
you can use Kirchhoff’s laws to describe any interconnections with the 
other basic elements.
Like other components, inductors and capacitors are easier to  
describe in terms of circuit variables rather than electromagnetic 
field variables. Hence, Sections 6.1 and 6.2 briefly review the field 
concepts underlying inductors and capacitors before focusing  
on the circuit descriptions. These sections also examine energy  
in inductors and capacitors. Energy can be stored in both mag-
netic and electric fields, so inductors and capacitors can store 
energy. For example, energy can be stored in an inductor and then  
released to fire a spark plug, or stored in a capacitor and then 
released to fire a strobe light. In ideal inductors and  capacitors, 
you can extract only as much energy as you have stored. Because 
 inductors and capacitors cannot generate energy, they are classi-
fied as passive elements.
Section  6.3 describes circuit simplification using series and 
parallel combinations of capacitors or inductors.
In Sections 6.4 and 6.5, we consider two circuits linked by a  
magnetic field and thus magnetically coupled. The voltage 
induced in one circuit is related to the time-varying current in the 
other circuit by a parameter known as mutual inductance. The 
practical significance of magnetic coupling unfolds as we study 
the relationships between current, voltage, power, and several  
new parameters specific to mutual inductance. We introduce 
these relationships here and then describe their utility in a device 
called a transformer in Chapters 9 and 10.

CHAPTER OBJECTIVES

Practical Perspective
Capacitive Touch Screens
The Practical Perspective in Chapter 3 used a grid of re-
sistors to create a touch screen for a phone or computer  
monitor. But resistive touch screens have some limita-
tions, the most important of which is that the screen can 
only process a single touch at any instant in time (see 
Problem 3.75). This means a resistive touch screen can-
not process the “pinch” gesture used by many devices to 
enlarge or shrink the image on the screen.
Multi-touch screens use a different component  
within a grid below the screen—capacitors. When you 
touch a capacitive touch screen, the capacitor’s value 
changes, causing a voltage change. Once you have 
learned the basic behavior of capacitors and know how 
they combine in series and in parallel, we will present  
two possible designs for a  multi-touch screen using a 
grid of capacitors.

6.1 The Inductor
An inductor is an electrical component that opposes any change in electri-
cal current. It is composed of a coil of wire wound around a supporting core  
whose material can be magnetic or nonmagnetic. The behavior of inductors  
is based on phenomena associated with magnetic fields. The source of the  
magnetic field is charge in motion, or current. If the current is varying with  
time, the magnetic field is varying with time. A time-varying magnetic field  
induces a voltage in any conductor linked by the field. The circuit parame-
ter of inductance relates the induced voltage to the current.
Figure 6.1(a) shows an inductor, represented graphically as a coiled 
wire. Its inductance is symbolized by the letter L and is measured in henrys  
(H). Assigning the reference direction of the current in the direction of the 
voltage drop across the terminals of the inductor, as shown in Fig. 6.1(b), 
and using the passive sign convention yields
THE INDUCTOR 
i
v − EQUATION
 
v
L di
dt ,
=
 
(6.1)
where v is measured in volts, L in henrys, i in amperes, and t in seconds. 
If the current reference is in the direction of the voltage rise, Eq. 6.1 is 
written with a minus sign.
Note from Eq. 6.1 that the voltage across the terminals of an  inductor 
is proportional to the time rate of change of the current in the inductor. 
We can make two important observations here. First, if the current is 
constant, the voltage across the ideal inductor is zero. Thus, the inductor 
behaves as a short circuit in the presence of a constant, or dc, current. 
Second, current cannot change instantaneously in an inductor; that is, the 
current cannot change by a finite amount in zero time. Equation 6.1 tells 
us that this change would require an infinite voltage, and infinite voltages  
are not possible. For example, when someone opens the switch on an in-
ductive circuit in an actual system, the current initially continues to flow in 
the air across the switch, a phenomenon called arcing. The arc across the 
switch prevents the current from dropping to zero instantaneously.
Example 6.1 illustrates the application of Eq. 6.1 to a simple circuit.
EXAMPLE 6.1 
 Determining the Voltage, Given the Current, at the Terminals  
of an Inductor

the same time?
f) At what instant of time does the voltage change 
polarity?
g) Is there ever an instantaneous change in voltage 
across the inductor? If so, at what time?

Current in an Inductor in Terms of the Voltage Across 
the Inductor
Equation 6.1 expresses the voltage across the terminals of an inductor as 
a function of the current in the inductor. Now we express the current as 
a function of the voltage. To find i as a function of v, start by multiplying 
both sides of Eq. 6.1 by a differential time dt:

generates a differential change in i, so the expression simplifies to

Equations 6.1 and 6.2 both give the relationship between the voltage 
and current at the terminals of an inductor. In both equations, the refer-
ence direction for the current is in the direction of the voltage drop across 
the terminals. Pay attention to the algebraic sign of i(t0). If the initial cur-
rent direction and the reference direction for i are the same, the initial 
current is positive. If the initial current is in the opposite direction, it is 
negative. Example 6.2 illustrates the application of Eq. 6.2.

inductor.
Power and Energy in the Inductor
The power and energy relationships for an inductor can be derived directly 
from the current and voltage relationships. If the current reference is in 
the direction of the voltage drop across the terminals of the inductor, the 
power is
 
= v
p
i.  
(6.3)
Remember that power is in watts, voltage is in volts, and current is in 
amperes. If we express the inductor voltage as a function of the inductor 
current, the expression for inductor power becomes

Eqs. 6.3 and 6.5 to the circuits in Examples 6.1 and 6.2 to examine power

the interval when p

Integrating p between 0.2 s and infinity gives the 
energy extracted. Note that in this time interval, all 
the energy originally stored is removed, so after the 
current peak, no energy is stored in the inductor.
f) The plots of v, i, p, and w follow directly from 
the expressions for v and i given in Example 6.2 
and are shown in Fig. 6.9. Note that in this case 
the power is always positive, and hence energy is 
always being stored during the voltage pulse.
g) The inductor stores energy when the voltage pulse 
is applied. Because the inductor is ideal, the energy 
cannot dissipate after the voltage subsides to zero, 
and thus current continues to circulate in the cir-
cuit. Practical inductors require a resistor in the cir-
cuit model, which we will examine later in this text.

6.2 The Capacitor
A capacitor is an electrical component consisting of two conductors 
 separated by an insulator or dielectric material. The capacitor is the only 
device other than a battery that can store electrical charge. The behavior 
of capacitors is based on phenomena associated with electric fields. The 
source of the electric field is separation of charge, or voltage. If the voltage 
is varying with time, the electric field is varying with time. A time-varying 
electric field produces a displacement current in the space occupied by 
the field. The circuit parameter of capacitance relates the displacement 
current to the voltage, where the displacement current is equal to the con-
duction current at the terminals of the capacitor.
The circuit symbol for a capacitor is two short parallel conductive 
plates, as shown in Fig. 6.10(a). The capacitance is represented by the let-
ter C and is measured in farads (F). Because the farad is an extremely 
large quantity of capacitance, practical capacitor values usually lie in the 
picofarad (pF) to microfarad μ
( F) range.
The capacitor’s symbol reminds us that capacitance occurs whenever 
electrical conductors are separated by a dielectric, or insulating, material. 
This condition implies that electric charge is not transported through the 
 capacitor. Although applying a voltage to the terminals of the capacitor 
cannot move a charge through the dielectric, it can displace a charge within

the dielectric. As the voltage varies with time, the displacement of charge 
also varies with time, causing what is known as the displacement current.
The displacement current is indistinguishable from the conduction 
current at the capacitor’s terminals. The current is proportional to the rate 
at which the voltage across the capacitor varies with time, so

(6.6)
where i is measured in amperes, C in farads, v in volts, and t in seconds. In 
Fig. 6.10(b), the current reference is in the direction of the voltage drop 
across the capacitor. Using the passive sign convention, we write Eq. 6.6 
with a positive sign. If the current reference is in the direction of the volt-
age rise, Eq. 6.6 is written with a minus sign.
Two important observations follow from Eq. 6.6. First, if the voltage 
across the terminals is constant, the capacitor current is zero because a 
conduction current cannot be established in the dielectric material of the 
capacitor. Only a time-varying voltage can produce a displacement cur-
rent. Thus, a capacitor behaves as an open circuit in the presence of a con-
stant voltage. Second, voltage cannot change instantaneously across the 
terminals of a capacitor. Equation 6.6 indicates that such a change would 
produce infinite current, a physical impossibility.
Equation 6.6 gives the capacitor current as a function of the capacitor 
voltage. To express the voltage as a function of the current, we multiply 
both sides of Eq. 6.6 by a differential time dt and then integrate the result-
ing differentials:

b) The excitation current and the resulting voltage, 
power, and energy are plotted in Fig. 6.12.
c) Note that the power is always positive for the 
duration of the current pulse, which means that 
energy is continuously being stored in the capac-
itor. When the current returns to zero, the stored 
energy is trapped because the ideal capacitor 
cannot dissipate energy. Thus, a voltage remains 
on the capacitor after its current returns to zero.

Inductance, Capacitance, and Mutual Inductance
6.3 Series-Parallel Combinations  
of Inductance and Capacitance
Just as series-parallel combinations of resistors can be reduced to a single 
equivalent resistor, series-parallel combinations of inductors or capacitors 
can be reduced to a single inductor or capacitor.
Inductors in Series and Parallel
Figure 6.13 shows inductors in series. The series connection means the 
inductors all have the same current, so we define only one current for the 
series combination. The voltage drops across the individual inductors are

If the original inductors carry an initial current of i(t0), the equivalent 
inductor carries the same initial current. Figure 6.14 shows the equivalent 
circuit for series inductors carrying an initial current.
Inductors in parallel have the same terminal voltage, so the current in 
each inductor is a function of the terminal voltage and the initial current 
in that inductor. For the three inductors in parallel shown in Fig. 6.15, the 
currents for the individual inductors are

Capacitors in Series and Parallel
Capacitors connected in series can be reduced to a single equivalent 
capacitor. The reciprocal of the equivalent capacitance is equal to the sum 
of the reciprocals of the individual capacitances. The initial voltage on 
the equivalent capacitor is the algebraic sum of the initial voltages on the 
individual capacitors. Figure 6.17 and the following equations summarize

Figure  6.19 shows four interconnected inductors. 
The initial currents for two of the inductors are also 
shown in Fig.  6.19. A single equivalent inductor, 
together with its initial current, is shown in Fig. 6.20.
a) Find the equivalent inductance, Leq.
b) Find the initial current in the equivalent inductor.

Inductor and Capacitor Symmetry
 We introduced the concept of symmetry, or duality, in Chapter 4. In that 
chapter, we recognized several examples of duality, including
• essential nodes and meshes;
• KCL and KVL;
•  the node-voltage method and the mesh-current method.
There are also examples of duality in Sections 6.1 through 6.3; these are summa-
rized in Table 6.1. From this table we note many dual relationships, including
• voltage and current;
• open circuits and short circuits;
• inductance and capacitance;
• series connections and parallel connections.

Recognizing the symmetry in the characteristics of inductors and capac-

6.4  Mutual Inductance
A time-varying current in an inductor coil creates a time-varying  magnetic 
field that surrounds that coil, as we saw in Section 6.1. Inductance relates 
the voltage drop across an inductor to the time-varying current in that 
inductor. As you will see, it makes sense to rename this parameter 
self-inductance.
Now we consider circuits containing two inductors with time-varying 
currents, each creating a time-varying magnetic field. In these circuits, the 
magnetic field generated by one coil’s current envelops the other coil and 
vice versa, thereby magnetically coupling the two inductors and the circuits 
that contain them. Figure 6.23 shows an example of such a circuit, where 
L1 and L2 are the self-inductances of the individual inductors and M is 
the mutual inductance associated with the magnetic coupling. Note the 
 double-headed arrow adjacent to M; the arrows indicate the pair of coils 
with this value of mutual inductance. We need this notation to accommo-
date circuits with more than one pair of magnetically coupled coils.
The mesh-current method is the easiest way to analyze circuits 
with magnetically coupled inductors. Following Analysis Method 4.6 
(page 110), in Step 1 we identify the meshes, and in Step 2 we label the 
mesh currents. The result is shown in Fig. 6.24. In Step 3, we write a KVL 
equation around each mesh, summing the voltages across each mesh com-
ponent. There will be two voltages across each inductor coil because the 
coils are magnetically coupled. One voltage is the self-induced voltage, 
which is the product of the self-inductance of the coil and the first deriva-
tive of that coil’s current. The other voltage is the mutually induced volt-
age, which is the product of the mutual inductance of the coils and the first 
derivative of the current in the other coil. Consider the inductor on the 
left in Fig. 6.24 with self-inductance L .

this coil is L

(
), and the mutually induced voltage across this coil is 
M di
dt
2
(
). But what about the polarities of these two voltages?
Using the passive sign convention, we find that the self-induced 
 voltage is a voltage drop in the direction of the current producing the 
 voltage. But the polarity of the mutually induced voltage depends on the 
way the inductor coils are wound in relation to the reference direction of 
coil currents. Showing the details of mutually coupled windings is very 
cumbersome. Instead, we use the dot convention to determine the mutu-
ally induced voltage polarities. A dot is placed on one terminal of each 
winding, as shown in Fig. 6.25. These dots carry the sign information, so 
we can draw the inductor coils schematically rather than showing how 
they wrap around a core structure.
The dot convention can be summarized as follows:
DOT CONVENTION FOR MAGNETICALLY  
COUPLED INDUCTOR COILS
When the reference direction for a current enters the dot-
ted terminal of a coil, the reference polarity of the volt-
age that it induces in the other coil is positive at its dotted 
terminal.

Inductance, Capacitance, and Mutual Inductance
Usually, dot markings will be provided for you in the circuit diagrams 
in this text, as they are in Fig. 6.25. Let’s use the dot convention to com-
plete Step 3 in the mesh-current method. Start with the mesh on the left in  
Fig. 6.25 and sum the voltages around the mesh in the direction of the i1  
mesh current to get

The first three terms in the sum, including their signs, should be familiar 
to you. Look at the fourth term: note that the i2 current enters the undot-
ted terminal of the L2 inductor and creates a mutually induced voltage 
across the L1 inductor that is positive at its undotted terminal. This is a 
voltage rise with respect to the direction of i1, so the sign of Mdi

 in 
the sum is negative.
Now consider the mesh on the right in Fig. 6.25, and sum the voltages 
around the mesh in the direction of the i2 mesh current to get

Look at the third term in the sum: the i1 current enters the dotted terminal 
of the L1 inductor and creates a mutually induced voltage across the L2 
inductor that is positive at its dotted terminal. This is a voltage rise with 
respect to the direction of i2, so the sign of Mdi
dt

 in the sum is nega-
tive. Figure 6.26 shows the self- and mutually induced voltages across both 
inductor coils, together with their polarity marks.
ALTERNATE DOT CONVENTION
When the reference direction for a current leaves the 
dotted terminal of a coil, the reference polarity of the 
voltage that it induces in the other coil is negative at its 
dotted terminal.
The Procedure for Determining Dot Markings
If the polarity dots are not given, you can often determine their locations 
by examining the physical configuration of the actual circuit or by testing 
it in the laboratory. We present both of these procedures.
The first procedure assumes that we know the physical arrangement 
of the two coils and the mode of each winding in a magnetically coupled 
circuit. Use the following six steps, applied here to Fig. 6.27, to create the 
dot markings:
1. Arbitrarily select one terminal—say, the D terminal—of one coil 
and mark it with a dot.

 If the fluxes 
have the same reference direction, place a dot on the terminal of 
the second coil where the test current i(
)
A  enters. If the fluxes have 
different reference directions, place a dot on the terminal of the 
second coil where the test current leaves. In Fig. 6.27, the fluxes 
D
φ  
and 
A
φ  have the same reference direction, and therefore a dot goes 
on terminal A.
The second procedure determines the relative polarities of magneti-
cally coupled coils experimentally. This method is used when it is impos-
sible to determine how the coils are wound on the core. One experimental 
method is to connect a dc voltage source, a resistor, a switch, and a dc volt-
meter to the pair of coils, as shown in Fig. 6.28. The shaded box covering the 
coils implies that physical inspection of the coils is not possible. The resistor 
R limits the magnitude of the current supplied by the dc voltage source.
Begin by marking the coil terminal connected to the positive terminal 
of the dc source, via the switch and limiting resistor, with a dot, as shown 
in Fig. 6.28. When the switch is closed, observe the voltmeter deflection. 
If the momentary deflection is upscale, place a dot on the coil terminal 
connected to the voltmeter’s positive terminal. If the deflection is down-
scale, place a dot on the coil terminal connected to the voltmeter’s nega-
tive terminal.
Example 6.8 constructs the equations for a circuit with magnetically 
coupled coils, using the dot convention.

Now we observe that as t approaches infinity, the 
source current ig
(

of 16 A, and therefore the magnetically coupled 
coils behave as short circuits. Hence, at t = ∞ 
the circuit reduces to that shown in Fig.  6.30. 
From Fig. 6.30 we see that at t = ∞ the three 
resistors are in parallel across the 16 A source. 
The equivalent resistance is 3.75 Ω, and thus the  
voltage across the 16 A current source is 60 V.

6.5 A Closer Look at Mutual 
Inductance
Here we take a closer look at self-inductance, and then we turn to a deeper 
inspection of mutual inductance, examining the limitations and assump-
tions made in Section 6.4.
A Review of Self-Inductance
Michael Faraday, who studied inductance in the early 1800s, envisioned a 
magnetic field consisting of lines of force surrounding the current- carrying 
conductor. Picture these lines of force as energy-storing elastic bands that 
close on themselves. As the current increases and decreases, the elastic 
bands (that is, the lines of force) spread and collapse about the conductor. 
The voltage induced in the conductor is proportional to the number of 
lines that collapse into, or cut, the conductor. This image of induced volt-
age is expressed by Faraday’s law:
 
v
λ
= d
dt  ,  
(6.18)
where λ is the flux linkage, measured in weber-turns.
So, how is Faraday’s law related to inductance as defined in 
Section 6.1? Let’s look at the coil depicted in Fig. 6.31. The lines threading 
the N  turns, labeled φ, represent the magnetic lines of force that make up 
the magnetic field, which has a spatial orientation and a strength. Use the 
right-hand rule to determine the spatial orientation: When the fingers of 
the right hand are wrapped around the coil and point in the direction of 
the current, the thumb points in the direction of that portion of the mag-
netic field inside the coil.
To determine the magnetic field strength, begin by defining flux link-
age, introduced in Faraday’s law (Eq. 6.18). The flux linkage is the prod-
uct of the magnetic field, ,
φ  measured in webers (Wb), and the number of 
turns linked by the field, N:
N .
λ
φ
=
The magnitude of the flux, φ, is related to the magnitude of the coil cur-
rent by the relationship
P
φ =
Ni
where N  is the number of turns on the coil, and P is the permeance of the 
space occupied by the flux. When the space containing the flux is made 
up of magnetic materials (such as iron, nickel, and cobalt), the permeance 
varies with the flux, giving a nonlinear relationship between φ and i. But 
when the space containing the flux is composed of nonmagnetic materials, 
the permeance is constant, giving a linear relationship between φ and i. 
Note that the flux is also proportional to the number of turns on the coil.

The polarity of the induced voltage in the circuit in Fig. 6.31 depends 
on the current creating the magnetic field. For example, when i is increas-
ing, di dt is positive and v  is positive, so energy is required to establish 
the magnetic field. The product iv  gives the rate at which energy is stored  
in the field. When i is decreasing, di dt is negative, v is negative, and the 
field collapses about the coil, returning energy to the circuit.
Given this deeper look at self-inductance, we now reexamine mutual 
inductance.
The Concept of Mutual Inductance
Figure 6.32 shows two magnetically coupled coils. Use the procedure pre-
sented in Section 6.4 to verify that the dot markings on the two coils agree 
with the direction of the coil windings and currents shown. The number 
of turns on each coil are N1 and N ,
2  respectively. Coil 1 is energized by a 
time-varying current source that establishes the current i1 in the N1 turns. 
Coil 2 is not energized and is open. The coils are wound on a nonmagnetic 
core. The flux produced by the current i1 can be divided into two compo-
nents, labeled 
11
φ  and 
.
21
φ
 The flux component 
11
φ  is the flux produced by 
i1 that links only the N1 turns. The component 
21
φ
 is the flux produced by 
i1 that links both the N 2 and N1 turns. The first digit in the flux subscript 
gives the coil number, and the second digit refers to the coil current. Thus, 
11
φ  is a flux linking coil 1 and produced by a current in coil 1, whereas 
21
φ
 
is a flux linking coil 2 and produced by a current in coil 1.
The total flux linking coil 1 is

which represents an ideal state. In reality, winding two coils so that they share 
precisely the same flux is physically impossible. Magnetic materials (such as 
alloys of iron, cobalt, and nickel) create a space with high permeance and are 
used to establish coefficients of coupling that approach unity. (We say more 
about this important quality of magnetic materials in Chapter 9.)

Inductance, Capacitance, and Mutual Inductance
Equations 6.29 and 6.30 express the total energy stored in a pair of  linearly 
coupled coils as a function of the coil currents, the self-inductances, and 
the mutual inductance. Note that the only difference between these equa-
tions is the coefficient of the current product I I .
1
2  We use Eq. 6.29 if i1 is 
established first and Eq. 6.30 if i2  is established first.
When the coupling medium is linear, the total energy stored is the 
same regardless of the order used to establish I 1 and I2 because the resul-
tant magnetic flux depends only on the final values of i1 and i ,
2  not on how 
the currents reached their final values. If the resultant flux is the same, the 
stored energy is the same. Therefore, for linear coupling, M

12

Also, because I 1 and I 2 are arbitrary values of i1 and i ,
2  respectively, we 
represent the coil currents by their instantaneous values i1 and i .

any instant of time, the total energy stored in the coupled coils is

We derived Eq. 6.35 by assuming that i1 and i2  are either both positive or

signs because in this case we obtain the limiting value of M by selecting 
the plus sign in Eq. 6.32.

Practical Perspective
Capacitive Touch Screens
Capacitive touch screens are often used in applications where two or 
more simultaneous touch points must be detected. We will discuss 
two designs for a multi-touch screen. The first design employs a grid 
of electrodes, as shown in Fig. 6.35. When energized, a small parasitic 
capacitance, Cp, exists between each electrode strip and ground, as  

210 
Inductance, Capacitance, and Mutual Inductance
shown in Fig. 6.36(a). When the screen is touched, say at position  
x, y on the screen, a second capacitance exists due to the transfer of a 
small amount of charge from the screen to the human body, which acts 
like a conductor. This introduces a second capacitance at the point of 
touch with respect to ground, as shown in Fig. 6.36(b).
A touch-screen controller is continually monitoring the capaci-
tance between the electrodes in the grid and ground. If the screen is 
untouched, the capacitance between every electrode in the x-grid and 
ground is Cp; the same is true for the capacitance between every elec-
trode in the y-grid and ground.
When the screen is touched at a single point, Ct and Cp combine in 
parallel. The equivalent capacitance between the x-grid electrode clos-
est to the touch point and ground is now

Likewise, the equivalent capacitance between the y-grid electrode clos-
est to the touch point and ground is now
=
+
C

C .
ty
t
p
Thus, a screen touch increases the capacitance between the 
 electrodes and ground for the x- and y-grid electrodes closest to the 
touch point.
What happens when there are two simultaneous points where the 
screen is touched? Assume that the first touch point has coordinates 
x1, y1 and the second touch point has coordinates x2, y2. Now there are 
four screen locations that correspond to an increase in capacitance: 
x1, y1; x1, y2; x2, y1; and x2, y2. Two of those screen locations match the 
two touch points, and the other two points are called “ghost” points 
because the screen was not touched at those points. Therefore, this 
method for implementing a capacitive touch screen cannot accurately 
identify more than a single touch point.
Most modern capacitive touch screens do not use the “ self-  
capacitance” design. Instead of measuring the capacitance between 
each x-grid electrode and ground, and each y-grid electrode and 
ground, the capacitance between each x-grid electrode and each y-grid 
electrode is measured. This capacitance is known as “mutual” capaci-
tance and is shown in Fig. 6.37(a).
When the screen is touched, say at position x, y on the screen, a 
second capacitance again exists due to the transfer of a small amount 
of charge from the screen to the human body. The second capaci-
tance exists at the point of touch with respect to ground, as shown 
in Fig. 6.37(b). Therefore, whenever there is a change in the mutual 
 capacitance, Cmxy, the screen touch point can be uniquely identified 
as x, y. If the screen is touched at the points x1, y1 and x2, y2 then pre-
cisely two mutual capacitances change: Cmx1y1 and Cmx2y2. There are no 
“ghost” points identified, as there were in the self- capacitance design. 
The mutual capacitance design produces a multi-touch screen capa-
ble of identifying two or more touch points uniquely and accurately.

Summary
• Inductance is a linear circuit parameter that relates the 
voltage induced by a time-varying magnetic field to the 
current producing the field. (See page 184.)
• Capacitance is a linear circuit parameter that relates the 
current induced by a time-varying electric field to the 
voltage producing the field. (See page 189.)
•  Inductors and capacitors are passive elements; they can 
store and release energy, but they cannot generate or 
dissipate energy. (See page 182.)
• The instantaneous power at the terminals of an inductor 
or capacitor can be positive or negative, depending on 
whether energy is being delivered to or extracted from 
the element.
• An inductor:
• does not permit an instantaneous change in its termi-
nal current,
• does permit an instantaneous change in its teminal 
voltage, and
• behaves as a short circuit in the presence of a con-
stant terminal current. (See page 184.)
• A capacitor:
• does not permit an instantaneous change in its termi-
nal voltage,
• does permit an instantaneous change in its terminal 
current, and
• behaves as an open circuit in the presence of a con-
stant terminal voltage. (See page 190.)
• Equations for voltage, current, power, and energy in 
ideal inductors and capacitors are given in Table  6.1. 
(See page 198.)
• Inductors in series or in parallel can be replaced 
by an equivalent inductor. Capacitors in series or 
in parallel can be replaced by an equivalent capac-
itor. The equations are summarized in Table 6.1. The 
 table   includes the initial conditions for series and 
parallel equivalent circuits involving inductors and 
capacitors.
• Mutual inductance, M, is the circuit parameter relating 
the voltage induced in one circuit to a time-varying cur-
rent in another circuit. Specifically,

• The dot convention establishes the polarity of mutually 
induced voltages:
When the reference direction for a current enters the 
dotted terminal of a coil, the reference polarity of the 
voltage that the current induces in the other coil is 
positive at its dotted terminal.
Or, alternatively,
When the reference direction for a current leaves the 
dotted terminal of a coil, the reference polarity of the 
voltage that the current induces in the other coil is 
negative at its dotted terminal.

 6.13  The expressions for voltage, power, and energy 
derived in Example 6.5 involved both integration 
and manipulation of algebraic expressions. As an 
engineer, you cannot accept such results on faith 
alone. That is, you should develop the habit of ask-
ing your self, “Do these results make sense in terms 
of the known behavior of the circuit they purport 
to describe?” With these thoughts in mind, test the 
expressions of  Example 6.5 by performing the fol-
lowing checks:
a) Check the expressions to see whether the volt-
age is continuous in passing from one time inter-
val to the next.
b) Check the power expression in each inter-
val by selecting a time within the interval and 
seeing whether it gives the same result as the 
 corresponding product of v and i. For example, 
test at 10 and 
μ
30  s.
c) Check the energy expression within each inter-
val by selecting a time within the interval and 
seeing whether the energy equation gives the 
same result as

ghost points. If a self-capacitance touch screen is 
touched at the x, y coordinates (1.8, 2.4) and (3.0,

b) A self-capacitance touch screen can still func-

touch points are those identified in part (a), and 
at time t2 four touch points associated with the 
x, y coordinates (2.2, 2.8) and (2.5, 3.4) are iden-
tified. Comparing the four points at t1 with the 
four points at t2, software can recognize a pinch 
gesture—should the screen be zoomed in or 
zoomed out?
c) Repeat part (b), assuming that at time t2 four 
touch points associated with the x, y coordinates 
(1.2, 1.8) and (3.6, 5.0) are identified.

CHAPTER 
Response of First-Order 
RL and RC Circuits
In this chapter, we focus on circuits that consist only of sources, 
resistors, and either (but not both) inductors or capacitors. We call 
these circuits RL (resistor-inductor) and RC (resistor- capacitor) 
circuits. In Chapter 6, we saw that inductors  and capacitors can 
store energy. We analyze RL and RC circuits to determine the 
currents and voltages that arise when energy is either released 
or acquired by an inductor or capacitor in response to an abrupt 
change in a dc voltage or current source.
We divide our analysis of RL and RC circuits into three phases.
• First Phase: Find the currents and voltages that arise when 
stored energy in an inductor or capacitor is suddenly released 
to a resistive network. This happens when the inductor or 
capacitor is abruptly disconnected from its dc source. Thus, 
we can reduce the circuit to one of the two equivalent forms 
shown in Fig. 7 .1 on page 222. These currents and voltages 
characterize the natural response of the circuit because the 
nature of the circuit itself, not external sources of excitation, 
determines its behavior.
• Second Phase: Find the currents and voltages that arise 
when energy is being acquired by an inductor or capacitor 
when a dc voltage or current source is suddenly applied. 
This response is called the step response.
• Third Phase: Develop a general method for finding the response 
of RL and RC circuits to any abrupt change in a dc voltage or 
current source. A general method exists because the process for 
finding both the natural and step responses is the same.
 Figure 7.2 (page 222) shows the four general configurations 
of RL and RC circuits. Note that when there are no independent 
sources in the circuit, the Thévenin voltage or Norton current is 
zero, and the circuit reduces to one of those shown in Fig. 7.1; 
that is, we have a natural-response problem.
RL and RC circuits are also known as  first-order circuits because  
their voltages and currents are described by first-order differential 
equations. No matter how complex a circuit may appear, if it can 
be reduced to a Thévenin or Norton equivalent connected to the

 CHAPTER OBJECTIVES

Practical Perspective
Artificial Pacemaker
The muscle that makes up the heart contracts due to 
 rhythmical electrical impulses. Pacemaker cells control the 
impulse frequency. In adults, the pacemaker cells estab-
lish a resting heart rate of about 72 beats per minutes. 
Sometimes, however, damaged pacemaker cells produce a 
very low resting heart rate (a condition known as bradycar-
dia) or a very high resting heart rate (a condition known as 
tachycardia). When either happens, a normal heart rhythm 
can be restored by implanting an artificial pacemaker 
that mimics the pacemaker cells by delivering electrical 
impulses to the heart. Examples of internal and external 
artificial pacemakers are shown in the figures below.
Artificial pacemakers are very small and lightweight. 
They have a programmable microprocessor that adjusts 
the heart rate based on several parameters, an efficient 
battery with a life of up to 15 years, and a circuit that 
 generates the pulse. The simplest circuit consists of a 
 resistor and a capacitor. After we introduce and study 
the RC circuit, we will look at an RC circuit design for an 
 artificial pacemaker.

 natural response. (a) RL circuit. (b) RC circuit.
7.1 The Natural Response  
of an RL Circuit
We can describe the natural response of an RL circuit using the circuit 
shown in Fig. 7.3. We assume that the independent current source gener-
ates a constant current Is and that the switch has been in a closed position 
for a long time. We define the phrase a long time more accurately later in 
this section. For now it means that all currents and voltages have reached 
a constant value. Thus only constant, or dc, currents exist in the circuit 
just before the switch opens, and the voltage across the inductor is zero 
Ldi dt
(
0)
=
. Therefore, before the stored energy is released,
• The inductor behaves like a short circuit;
• The entire source current Is appears in the inductive branch; and
• There is no current in either R0 or R.
To find the natural response, we find the voltage and current at the 
terminals of the resistor R after the switch has been opened—that is, after 
the source and its parallel resistor R0 have been disconnected and the 
inductor begins releasing energy. If we let t
0
=
 denote the instant when 
the switch is opened, we find 
t( )
v
 and i t( ) for t
0.
≥
 For ≥
t
0, the circuit 
shown in Fig. 7.3 reduces to the one shown in Fig. 7.4.
 Deriving the Expression for the Current
To find i t( ), we write an expression involving i, R, and L for the circuit in 
Fig. 7.4 using Kirchhoff’s voltage law. Summing the voltages around the 
closed loop gives

(7.1)
where we used the passive sign convention. Equation 7.1 is a first-order 
ordinary differential equation because it involves the ordinary derivative 
of the unknown, di dt, and the highest order derivative appearing in the 
equation is 1.
We can go one step further in describing this equation. The coeffi-
cients in the equation, R and L, are constants; that is, they are not func-
tions of either the dependent variable i or the independent variable t. 
Thus, the equation can also be described as an ordinary differential equa-
tion with constant coefficients.
terminals of an equivalent inductor or capacitor, it is a first-order cir-
cuit. If the original circuit has two or more inductors or capacitors, 
they must be interconnected so that they can be replaced by a single 
equivalent element.
After introducing the techniques for analyzing the natural and 
step responses of first-order circuits, we will discuss three special 
cases:
•  Sequential switching (circuits in which switching occurs at 
two or more instants in time);
• Circuits with an unbounded response;
• The integrating amplifier circuit (containing an ideal op amp).

7.1 The Natural Response of an RL Circuit

result is

Recall from Chapter 6 that the inductor current cannot change instan-

the current in the inductor remains unchanged. If 0− is the time just prior

The Significance of the Time Constant
The time constant is an important parameter for first-order circuits. 
You can express the time elapsed after switching as an integer multiple 
of .τ  For example, one time constant after the inductor begins releasing 
its stored energy to the resistor, the current has been reduced to e
,
1
− or 
approximately 0.37 of its initial value.

time exceeds five time constants. So, five time constants after switching has 
occurred, the currents and voltages have essentially reached their final val-
ues. After switching, the changes to the currents and voltages are momen-
tary events and represent the transient response of the circuit.
By contrast, the phrase a long time implies that five or more time con-
stants have elapsed, for first-order circuits. The response that exists a long 
time after switching is called the steady-state response. The phrase a long 
time then also means the time it takes the circuit to reach its steady-state 
value.
The time constant also represents the time required for the current to 
reach its final value if the current continues to change at its initial rate. To 
illustrate, we evaluate di dt at 0+ and assume that the current  continues 
to change at this rate:

second, the expression for i becomes

This expression indicates that i would reach its final value of zero in  
τ seconds. Figure 7.9 shows how this graphic interpretation can be used to 
estimate a circuit’s time constant from a plot of its natural response. Such 
a plot could be generated on an oscilloscope measuring output  current. 
Drawing the tangent to the natural-response plot at t
0
=
 and reading the 
value at which the tangent intersects the time axis gives the value of .τ  This  
allows you to determine the time constant of a circuit even if you don’t 
know its component values.
Up to this point, we have dealt with circuits having a single inductor. 
But the techniques presented apply to circuits with multiple inductors if 
the inductors can be combined into a single equivalent inductor. Example 7.2  
finds the natural response of an RL circuit that contains two inductors.

7.2 The Natural Response  
of an RC Circuit
The form of an RC circuit’s natural response is analogous to that of an RL 
circuit. Consequently, we don’t treat the RC circuit in as much detail as we 
did the RL circuit.
We develop the natural response of an RC circuit using the circuit 
shown in Fig. 7.12. Begin by assuming that the switch has been in posi-
tion a for a long time, allowing the loop containing the dc voltage source 
V ,
g  the resistor R ,
1  and the capacitor C to reach a steady-state condition. 
Recall from Chapter 6 that a capacitor behaves as an open circuit in the 
Step  1: The initial current in the inductor in Fig. 7.11 
is I

Step 2:  The equivalent resistance attached to the  
inductor in Fig. 7.11 is 8 Ω. Therefore, the time con-
stant is

presence of a constant voltage, so the source voltage appears across the 
capacitor terminals. In Section 7.3, we will discuss how the capacitor volt-
age builds to the steady-state value of the dc voltage source. Here it is 
important to remember that when the switch is moved from position a to 
position b (at t

g  Because there 
can be no instantaneous change in the voltage at the terminals of a capaci-
tor, the problem reduces to solving the circuit shown in Fig. 7.13.
Deriving the Expression for the Voltage
We can easily find the voltage

7.3 The Step Response of RL and RC 
Circuits
The response of a circuit to the sudden application of a constant voltage 
or current source is called the step response of the circuit. In this section, 
we find the step response of first-order RL and RC circuits by describ-
ing the currents and voltages generated when either dc voltage or cur-
rent sources are suddenly applied. We also show how the circuit responds 
when energy is being stored in the inductor or capacitor. We begin with 
the step response of an RL circuit.
The Step Response of an RL Circuit
We modify the first-order circuit shown in Fig. 7.2(a) by adding a switch 
and develop the step response of an RL circuit using the resulting circuit, 
shown in Fig. 7.20. We assume a nonzero initial current i(0), so the induc-
tor has stored energy at the time the switch is closed. We want to find the 
expressions for the current in the circuit and for the voltage across the 
inductor after the switch has been closed. We use circuit analysis to derive 
the differential equation that describes the circuit in terms of the variable 
of interest, and then we use elementary calculus to solve the equation, just 
as we did in Section 7.1.
After the switch in Fig. 7.20 has been closed, KVL requires that

e) Plot both i t( ) and

Solution
a) Use Analysis Method 7.3 to find the inductor current.
Step   1: Determine the initial current in the 
inductor. To do this, draw the circuit in Fig. 7 .21 
when t
0
<
 and the switch is in position a, as 
shown in Fig. 7.22. Note that since the switch has 
been in position a for a long time, the inductor 
behaves like a short circuit that carries all of the 
current from the 8 A current source. Therefore, 
I
8 A
0 = −
 because the inductor current and 
the source current are in opposite directions.
Step   2: Calculate the time constant for the cir-
cuit. Start by drawing the circuit in Fig. 7 .21 when 
t
0
≥
 and the switch is in position b, as shown in 
Fig. 7.23. Then determine the Thévenin equivalent 
resistance for the circuit attached to the inductor. 
Since the circuit attached to the inductor is already 
a Thévenin equivalent circuit, the Thévenin equiv-
alent resistance is 2 Ω  and 
0.2 2
0.1 s.
τ =
=
Step   3: Calculate the final value for the inductor 
current. To do this, draw the circuit in Fig. 7 .21 
as t
,
→∞ when the switch is in position b, as 
shown in Fig. 7 .24. Since the switch has been in 
position b for a long time, the inductor behaves 
like a short circuit, as seen in Fig. 7 .24, and the 
current can be found from Ohm’s law. Therefore, 
I

Step   4: Write the equation for the inductor cur-

the 24 V drop across the source, producing a 40 V

7.3 The Step Response of RL and RC Circuits 
237
Does the value of v  at t
0
=
+ make sense? Because the initial cur-
rent is I 0 and the inductor prevents an instantaneous change in current, 
the current is I 0 in the instant after the switch has been closed. The volt-
age drop across the resistor is I R,
0
 so the voltage across the inductor is the 
source voltage minus the resistor voltage, that is, V
I R.

When the initial inductor current is zero, Eq. 7.15 simplifies to

If the initial current is zero, the voltage across the inductor jumps to Vs 
when the switch closes. We also expect the inductor voltage to approach 
zero as t increases because the current in the circuit is approaching the 
constant value of V
R.

 Figure  7.27 shows the plot of the simplified 
 voltage equation and the relationship between the time constant and the 
initial rate at which the inductor voltage is decreasing.
We can also describe the voltage 
t( )
v
 across the inductor in Fig. 7.20 
directly, without first calculating the circuit current. We begin by noting 
that the voltage across the resistor is the difference between the source 
voltage and the inductor voltage. Using Ohm’s law, we write

You should verify (in Problem 7.43) that the solution to Eq. 7.16 is identi-

At this point, a general observation about the step response of an RL 
circuit is pertinent. (This observation will prove helpful later.) When we

Eq. 7.10, which we can rewrite as

Observe that Eqs. 7.16 and 7.17 have the same form. Specifically, each 
equates the sum of the first derivative of the variable and a constant 
times the variable to a constant value. In Eq. 7.16, the constant on the 
 right-hand side happens to be zero; hence, this equation takes on the same 
form as the natural-response equations in Section 7.1. In both Eq. 7.16 
and Eq. 7.17, the constant multiplying the dependent variable is the recip-
rocal of the time constant; that is, R L

We can find the step response of a first-order RC circuit by analyzing the 
circuit shown in Fig. 7.28. For mathematical convenience, we choose the

Eq. 7.11. Therefore, by substituting the appropriate variables and coeffi-
cients, we can write the solution for v  directly. The translation requires 
that I s replace V ,

We obtained Eqs. 7.19 and 7.22 by applying a mathematical analogy 
to the solution for the step response of the RL circuit. Let’s see whether 
these solutions for the RC circuit make sense in terms of known circuit 
behavior. From Eq. 7.19, we have already observed that the initial capac-
itor voltage is V ,

7.4 A General Solution for Step and Natural Responses

7.4 A General Solution for Step  
and Natural Responses
We can construct a general approach to finding either the natural response 
or the step response of the first-order RL and RC circuits because their 
differential equations all have the same form. To generalize the solution 
of these four possible circuits, we let x t( ) represent the unknown quantity, 
where x t( ) represents the circuit variable that is required to be continuous 
for all time. Thus, x(t) is the inductor current for RL natural- and step- 
response circuits and is the capacitor voltage for RC natural- and  
step-response circuits. From Eqs. 7.16, 7.17, 7.18, and 7.21, we know that 
the differential equation describing both the natural and step responses of 
the RL and RC circuits takes the form
dx
dt
x
K,
τ
+
=
where the value of the constant K is zero for the natural response and 
nonzero for the step response.
How are the natural and step responses of RL circuits different, and 
how are they the same? Compare the circuits we analyzed to determine 
the natural and step responses of RL circuits using Figs. 7.3 and 7.20. The 
step-response circuit contains an independent source for t
0,
≥
 but the 
natural-response circuit does not. Now compare the analysis of the RL nat-
ural response and the RL step response (Analysis Methods 7.1 and 7.3). 
There is one extra calculation in the step-response analysis that computes 
the final value of the inductor current. We can make Analysis Methods 7.1 
and 7.3 exactly the same by recognizing that the final value of the induc-
tor current in the natural-response circuit is 0. These same observations 
hold when comparing both the natural and step responses of RC circuits 
(Figs. 7.12 and 7.28) and the natural-response analysis and  step- response 
analysis of RC circuits (Analysis Methods 7.2 and 7.4). So we can make 
Analysis Methods 7.2 and 7.4 exactly the same by recognizing that the final 
value of the capacitor voltage in the natural-response circuit is 0.
Next, let’s look at how the step response of an RL circuit is similar to 
and different from the step response of an RC circuit. Comparing Analysis 
Methods 7.2 and 7.4, we identify four important differences:
• In the RL circuit, we find the inductor current for t
0;
≥
 in the RC 
circuit, we find the capacitor voltage for t
0.
≥
• We analyze the RL circuit when t
0
<
 to find the initial inductor current; 
we analyze the RC circuit when t
0
<
 to find the initial capacitor voltage.
• We analyze the RL circuit when t
0
≥
 to find the equivalent resis-
tance attached to the inductor and use it to calculate the circuit’s 
time constant, 
L R;
τ =
 we analyze the RC circuit when t
0
≥
 to 
find the equivalent resistance attached to the capacitor and use it to 
calculate the circuit’s time constant, 
RC.
τ =
• We analyze the RL circuit as t →∞ to find the final inductor cur-
rent; we analyze the RC circuit as t →∞ to find the final capacitor 
voltage. If the circuit exhibits a natural response instead of a step 
response, we know that the final values are zero without performing 
circuit analysis.
Based on these comparisons, we can create a general step-by-step method 
to calculate the natural and step responses of both RL and RC circuits.
Step   1: Identify the variable x(t), which is the quantity that is required to 
be continuous for all time. This is the inductor current in RL circuits and 
the capacitor voltage in RC circuits.

so the capacitor looks like an open circuit. 
Therefore, the voltage across the capacitor is the 
voltage across the 60 Ω  resistor. Using voltage

(See Problem 6.39.) It follows that the circuit in 
Fig. 7 .37 can be simplified, as shown in Fig. 7.38. 
We can apply Analysis Method 7.5 to the circuit 
in Fig. 7 .38.
Step   1: Identify the inductor current, io, as the 
variable of interest, because this is an RL circuit.
Step   2: Calculate the initial value of i. By hypoth-
esis, there is no initial energy stored in the coils, 
so there is no initial current in the equivalent  
1.5 H inductor. Thus, I

7.5 Sequential Switching
Whenever switching occurs at two or more distinct times in a circuit, we 
have sequential switching. For example, a single, two-position switch may 
be in position 1 at t1 and in position 2 at t2, or multiple switches may be 
opened or closed in sequence. We determine the voltages and currents 
generated by a switching sequence using the techniques described pre-
viously in this chapter, primarily Analysis Method 7.5. We derive the 
expressions for 
t( )
v
 and i t( ) for a given position of the switch or switches 
and then use these solutions to determine the initial conditions for the 
next position of the switch or switches.
With sequential switching problems, a premium is placed on obtain-
ing the initial value x t(
).
0
 Recall that anything but inductive currents and 
capacitive voltages can change instantaneously at the time of switching. 
Thus, solving first for inductive currents and capacitive voltages is even 
more pertinent in sequential switching problems. Drawing the circuit that

solution process.
Examples 7.11 and 7.12 illustrate the analysis techniques for circuits 
with sequential switching. The first example is a natural-response problem 
with two switching times, and the second is a step-response problem.

Solution
We use Analysis Method 7.5 to solve this  problem.
a) Step 1: Identify the inductor current, iL, as the 
variable of interest, because this is an RL circuit.
Step 2: Calculate the initial value of i. For t

both switches are closed, causing the 150 mH 
inductor to short-circuit the 18 Ω resistor. The 
equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. 7.40. We deter-
mine the initial current in the inductor by solving 
for i (0 )

 switch 1 is open (switch 2

source and the 4 Ω and 12 Ω resistors from the 
circuit. The inductor is no longer behaving as a 
short circuit (because the dc source is no longer in  
the circuit), so the 18 Ω resistor is no longer short- 
circuited. The equivalent circuit is shown in 
Fig.  7.41. Note that the equivalent resistance 
across the terminals of the inductor is the parallel 
combination of 9 Ω and 18  ,

EXAMPLE 7.12   Analyzing an RC Circuit That Has Sequential Switching
The uncharged capacitor in the circuit shown in 
Fig.  7.43 is initially switched to terminal a of the 
three-position switch. At t
0,
=
 the switch is 
moved to position b, where it remains for 15 ms. 
After the 15 ms delay, the switch is moved to posi-
tion c, where it remains indefinitely.
a) Derive the numerical expression for the voltage 
across the capacitor.
b) Plot the capacitor voltage versus time.
c) When will the voltage on the capacitor equal  
200 V?
Solution
We use Analysis Method 7.5 to solve this problem.
a) Step   1: Identify the capacitor voltage, v, as the 
variable of interest, because this is an RC circuit.
Step   2: Calculate the initial value of v. For 
t

Therefore,

Step 4: Calculate the final value for the capac-
itor voltage, Vf. If the switch were to remain in 
 position b for a long time, the capacitor would 
eventually behave like an open circuit in the pres-
ence of the 400 V source. Because of the open 
circuit, there would be no current in the 
Ω

resistor, so V

substituting the values for V0, τ, and Vf into Eq. 7 .23

ASSESSMENT PROBLEMS

7.6 Unbounded Response
A circuit response may grow, rather than decay, exponentially with time. 
This type of response, called an unbounded response, is possible if the cir-
cuit contains dependent sources. In circuits with an unbounded response, 
the Thévenin equivalent resistance with respect to the terminals of either 
an inductor or a capacitor is negative. This negative resistance generates 
a negative time constant, and the resulting currents and voltages increase 
without limit. In an actual circuit, a component eventually breaks down or 
saturates, halting the unbounded response.
We cannot use Analysis Method 7.5 to analyze a circuit with an 
unbounded response because calculating a final value of voltage or current

is not possible. Instead, we must derive the differential equation describ-
ing the circuit’s response and then solve it using the separation of variables 
technique. Example 7.13 analyzes a circuit with an unbounded response to 
illustrate this technique.
As an engineer, you should be aware that interconnected circuit ele-
ments may create unbounded responses. If such interconnections are 
unintended, the resulting circuit may experience unexpected, and poten-
tially dangerous, component failures.

b) Assume that the capacitor short-circuits when 
its terminal voltage reaches 150 V. How many 
milliseconds elapse before the capacitor short-

Solution
a) We need to write the differential equation that 
describes the capacitor voltage, vo. To make this 
task easier, let’s simplify the circuit attached to 
the capacitor by replacing it with its Thévenin 
equivalent. This subcircuit is shown in Fig. 7.46, 
and as you can see, it does not contain an inde-
pendent source. Thus, the Thévenin equivalent 
consists of a single resistor. To find the Thévenin 
equivalent resistance for the circuit in Fig. 7.46, 
we use the test-source method (see Example 4.18,  
p. 124), where vT is the test voltage and iT is the 
test current. Writing a KCL equation at the top

7.7 The Integrating Amplifier
We are now ready to analyze an integrating-amplifier circuit, shown in 
Fig. 7.48, which is based on the op amp presented in Chapter 5. This cir-
cuit generates an output voltage proportional to the integral of the input 
voltage. In Fig. 7.48, we added the branch currents if and is, along with the 
node voltages vn and vp, to aid our analysis. We assume that the op amp is 
ideal. Write a KCL equation at the inverting input node, and remember 
that the current into the ideal op amp at its input terminals is zero, to get

Figure 7.50 shows a plot of vo(t) versus t. Clearly, the output voltage is 
an inverted, scaled replica of the integral of the input voltage.
The output voltage is proportional to the integral of the input voltage 
only if the op amp operates within its linear range—that is, if it doesn’t 
saturate. Examples 7.14 and 7.15 further illustrate the analysis of the inte-
grating amplifier.

ASSESSMENT PROBLEMS
SELF-CHECK: Also try Chapter Problems 7.90 and 7.94.
From the examples, we see that the integrating amplifier can perform the 
integration function very well but only within specified limits that avoid satu-
rating the op amp. The op amp saturates because charge accumulates on the 
feedback capacitor. We can prevent saturation by placing a resistor in parallel 
with the feedback capacitor. We examine such a circuit in Chapter 8.
Note that we can convert the integrating amplifier to a differentiating 
amplifier by interchanging the input resistance Rs and the feedback capac-
itor Cf. Then

We leave the derivation of this expression as an exercise for you. The dif-
ferentiating amplifier is seldom used because in practice it is a source of 
 unwanted or noisy signals.
Finally, we can use an inductor instead of a capacitor to create both 
integrating- and differentiating- amplifier circuits. Since it is easier to fab-
ricate capacitors for integrated-circuit devices, inductors are rarely used in 
integrating amplifiers.

Practical Perspective
Artificial Pacemaker
The RC circuit shown in Fig. 7.53 can be used in an artificial pacemaker 
to establish a normal heart rhythm by generating periodic electrical 
impulses. The box labeled “controller” behaves as an open circuit until 
the voltage drop across the capacitor reaches a preset limit. Once that 
limit is reached, the capacitor discharges its stored energy in the form 
of an electrical impulse to the heart, starts to recharge, and then the 
process repeats.
Before we develop the analytical expressions that describe the cir-
cuit’s behavior, let’s get a feel for how the circuit works. First, when the 
controller behaves like an open circuit, the dc voltage source will charge 
the capacitor via the resistor R, toward a value of Vs volts. But once 
the capacitor voltage reaches Vmax, the controller behaves like a short 
circuit, enabling the capacitor to discharge. Once the capacitor dis-
charge is complete, the controller again acts like an open circuit and the 
capacitor starts to recharge. This cycle of charging and discharging the 
capacitor establishes the desired heart rhythm, as shown in Fig. 7.54.
In drawing Fig. 7.54, we have chosen =
t
0 at the instant the capac-
itor starts to charge. This plot also assumes that the circuit has reached 
the repetitive stage of its operation and that the time to discharge the 
capacitor is negligible when compared to the recharge time. We need 
an equation for vC(t) as a function of Vs, R, and C to design the artificial 
pacemaker circuit.
To begin the analysis, we assume that the circuit, shown in Fig. 7.55, 
has been in operation for a long time. Let 
=
t
0 at the instant when the 
capacitor has completely discharged and the controller is acting as an 
open circuit. From the circuit we find the initial and final values of the 
capacitor voltage and the circuit’s time constant:

Summary
• A first-order circuit may be reduced to a Thévenin (or 
Norton) equivalent connected to either a single equiva-
lent inductor or capacitor. (See page 220.)
• The natural response is the currents and voltages that 
exist when stored energy is released to a circuit that 
contains no independent sources. (See page 220.)
• The time constant of an RL circuit equals the equiva-
lent inductance divided by the Thévenin resistance as 
viewed from the terminals of the equivalent inductor. 
(See page 223.)
• The time constant of an RC circuit equals the product of 
the equivalent capacitance and the Thévenin resistance 
as viewed from the terminals of the equivalent capaci-
tor. (See page 229.)
• The step response is the currents and voltages that result 
from abrupt changes in dc sources connected to a circuit. 
Stored energy may or may not be present at the time the 
abrupt changes take place. (See page 233.)
• Analysis Method 7.5 can be used to find the solution for 
the natural and step responses of both RL and RC circuits:
Step 1: Identify the variable x(t), which is the quantity 
that is required to be continuous for all time. This is the 
inductor current in RL circuits and the capacitor voltage 
in RC circuits.
Step 2: Calculate the initial value X0, by analyzing the 
circuit to find x(t) for t
0
<
.
Step  3: Calculate the time constant, τ, for the circuit 
by analyzing the circuit for t
0
≥
 to find the equivalent 
resistance attached to the inductor or capacitor. For RL 
circuits, 
L R
τ =
, and for RC circuits, 
RC
τ =
.
Step  4: Calculate the final value Xf, by analyzing the 
circuit to find x(t) as t →∞. If the circuit exhibits a 
natural response, X
0
f =
, so no calculation is needed.
 Step 5: Write the equation for x(t) by substituting the  
initial value X0, the time constant τ, and the final value Xf, 
into the expression x t

Step 6: Use x(t) to find any other quantities of interest 
in the circuit. (See page 242.)
• Sequential switching in first-order circuits is analyzed 
by dividing the analysis into time intervals corres-
ponding to specific switch positions. Initial values for 
a particular interval are determined from the solution 
corresponding to the immediately preceding interval. 
(See page 246.)
• An unbounded response occurs when the Thévenin resis-
tance is negative, which is possible when the first- order 
circuit contains dependent sources. (See page 250.)
• An integrating amplifier consists of an ideal op amp, a 
capacitor in the negative feedback branch, and a resistor 
in series with the signal source. It outputs the inverted, 
scaled integral of the signal source, within specified lim-
its that avoid saturating the op amp. (See page 252.)

switch between a and b for a predetermined length 
of time. The electric relay holds its contact arms 
down as long as the voltage across the relay coil

the  relay contacts return to their initial position by 
a mechanical spring action. The switch between a 
and b is  initially closed by momentarily pressing 
the push button. Assume that the capacitor is fully 
charged when the push button is first pushed down.

inductance of the coil is negligible.

switch T2 will be on, and T1 will be off. (The oper-
ation of the ideal transistor switch is described in 
detail in Problem 7.97.) T2 can be turned off by 
momentarily closing the switch S. After S returns to 
its open position, T2 will return to its on state.

 7.97  The circuit shown in Fig. P 7.97 is known as an 
astable multivibrator and finds wide application 
in pulse circuits. The purpose of this problem is to 
relate the charging and discharging of the capaci-
tors to the operation of the circuit. The key to ana-
lyzing the circuit is to understand the behavior of 
the ideal transistor switches T1 and T2. The circuit 
is designed so that the switches automatically alter-
nate between on and off. When T1 is off, T2 is on 
and vice versa. Thus in the analysis of this circuit, we 
assume a switch is either on or off. We also assume 
that the ideal transistor switch can change its state 
instantaneously. In other words, it can snap from 
off to on and vice versa. When a transistor switch 
is on, (1) the base current ib is greater than zero,  
(2) the terminal voltage vbe is zero, and (3) the 
terminal voltage vce is zero. Thus, when a transis-
tor switch is on, it presents a short circuit between 
the terminals b,e and c,e. When a transistor switch 
is off, (1) the terminal voltage vbe is negative, (2) 
the base current is zero, and (3) there is an open 
circuit between the terminals c,e. Thus when a 
transistor switch is off, it presents an open circuit 
between the terminals b,e and c,e. Assume that T2 
has been on and has just snapped off, while T1 has 
been off and has just snapped on. Further assume 
that C2 is charged to the supply voltage VCC, and 
the charge on C1 is zero. Finally, assume C

Natural and Step 
Responses of RLC 
Circuits
In this chapter, we discuss the natural response and step  response 
of circuits containing a resistor, an inductor, and a  capacitor, known 
as RLC circuits. We limit our analysis to two simple structures: the 
parallel RLC circuit and the series RLC circuit.
We begin with the natural response of a parallel RLC circuit and 
cover this material in two sections: one section discusses the solution 
of the second-order differential equation that describes the circuit, 
and the other presents the three distinct forms that the solution can 
take. After introducing these three forms, we show that the same 
forms apply to the step response of a parallel RLC circuit as well as 
to the natural and step responses of series RLC circuits. The chap-
ter concludes with an introduction to an op-amp-based circuit whose 
output is also characterized by a  second-order differential equation.
Parallel RLC Circuits
We characterize the natural response of a parallel RLC circuit 
by finding the voltage across the parallel branches created by the 
release of energy stored in the inductor or capacitor, or both. The 
circuit is shown in Fig. 8.1 on page 274. The initial voltage on the 
capacitor, V0, represents the initial energy stored in the capaci-
tor. The initial current in the inductor, I 0, represents the initial 
energy stored in the inductor. You can find the individual branch 
currents after determining the voltage.
We derive the step response of a parallel RLC circuit by using 
Fig. 8.2 on page 274. We determine the circuit’s response when a 
dc current source is applied suddenly. Energy may or may not be 
stored in the circuit when the current source is applied.
 Series RLC Circuits
We characterize the natural response of a series RLC circuit by 
finding the current generated in the series-connected elements by 
the release of initially stored energy in the inductor, capacitor, or 
both. The circuit is shown in Fig. 8.3 on page 274. As before, the 
initial inductor current, I 0, and the initial capacitor voltage, V0, 
represent the initially stored energy. You can find the individual 
element voltages after determining the current.

CHAPTER OBJECTIVES

Practical Perspective 
Clock for Computer Timing
The digital circuits found in most computers require 
a  timing signal that synchronizes the operation of the 
 circuits. Consider a laptop computer whose processor 
speed is 2 GHz. This means that the central processing 
unit for this computer can perform about 2
109
×
 simple 
operations every second.
The timing signal, produced by a clock generator 
chip, is typically a square wave with the required clock 
frequency. The square wave is obtained from a sinusoi-
dal wave with the required clock frequency. Typically, 
the sinusoidal wave is generated by a precisely cut 
quartz crystal with an applied voltage. The crystal 
 produces a stable frequency suitable for synchronizing 
digital circuits.
We can also generate a sinusoidal wave using a 
 circuit with an inductor and a capacitor. By choosing the 
values of inductance and capacitance, we can create a 
sinusoid with a specific frequency. We will  examine such 
a design once we have presented the fundamental con-
cepts of second-order circuits.

Natural and Step Responses of RLC Circuits
8.1 Introduction to the Natural 
Response of a Parallel RLC 
Circuit
To find the natural response of the circuit shown in Fig. 8.1, we begin by 
deriving the differential equation that the voltage v  satisfies. We choose to 
find the voltage because it is the same for each component. Once we know 
the voltage, we can find every branch current by using the current–voltage 
relationship for the branch component. We write the differential equation 
for the voltage using KCL to sum the currents leaving the top node, where 
each current is expressed as a function of the unknown voltage v :

(8.1)
Equation 8.1 is an ordinary, second-order differential equation with con-
stant coefficients because it describes a circuit with both an inductor and a 
capacitor. Therefore, we also call RLC circuits second-order circuits.
 The General Solution of the Second-Order 
Differential Equation
We can’t solve Eq. 8.1 by separating the variables and integrating, as we 
were able to do with the first-order equations in Chapter 7. Instead, we 
solve Eq. 8.1 by assuming that the voltage is of the form
 
= Ae ,
st
v
 
(8.2)
where A and s are unknown constants.
Why did we choose an exponential form for v, given in Eq. 8.2? The 
reason is that Eq. 8.1 requires the sum of the following three terms equals 
zero for all values of t: the second derivative of v, the first derivative of 
v times a constant, and v times a constant. This can occur only if higher- 
order derivatives of v have the same form as v. The exponential func-
tion satisfies this criterion. Furthermore, note that the solutions of the

We describe the step response of a series RLC circuit using the 
circuit shown in Fig. 8.4. We determine the circuit’s response to the 
sudden application of the dc voltage source. Energy may or may 
not be stored in the circuit when the switch is closed.

 
8.1 Introduction to the Natural Response of a Parallel RLC Circuit 
275
first-order equations we derived in Chapter 7 were all exponential; thus, 
it seems reasonable to assume that the solution of the second-order equa-
tion is also exponential.
If Eq. 8.2 is a solution of Eq. 8.1, it must satisfy Eq. 8.1 for all values of t.  
Substituting Eq. 8.2 into Eq. 8.1 generates the expression

Eq. 8.1, the parenthetical term must be zero, or

In Eq. 8.4, the constants s1 and s2, which are the roots of the characteristic 
equation, are determined by the circuit parameters R, L, and C. The con-
stants A1 and A2 are determined by the initial conditions for the inductor 
and the capacitor.
To find the natural response (Eq. 8.4), we begin by finding the roots 
of the characteristic equation, s1 and s2, which we first wrote in terms of 
the circuit parameters. We now rewrite them as follows:

These results are summarized in Table 8.1.

The exponent of e must be dimensionless, so both s1 and s2 (and hence 
α and 
0
ω ) must have the dimension of the inverse of time, or frequency. 
To distinguish among the frequencies s ,
1  s ,

α  and

 we use the fol-
lowing terminology: s1 and s2 are the complex frequencies, α is the neper 
frequency, and 
0
ω  is the resonant radian frequency. The full significance 
of this terminology unfolds as we move through the remaining chapters of 
this text. These frequencies all have the dimension of angular frequency 
per time. For the complex frequencies, the neper frequency, and the reso-
nant radian frequency, we specify values using the unit radians per second 
(rad s).
The form of the roots s1 and s2 depends on the values of α and 
.

As we shall see, damping affects the way the voltage response reaches its 
final (or steady-state) value. We discuss each case separately in Section 8.2.
Example 8.1 illustrates how the values of R, L, and C determine the 
numerical values of s1 and s2.

8.2 The Forms of the Natural 
Response of a Parallel RLC 
Circuit
In this section, we find the natural response for each of the three types of 
damping: overdamped, underdamped, and critically damped. As we have 
already seen, the values of s1 and s2 determine the type of damping. We 
need to find values for the two coefficients A1 and A2 so that we can com-
pletely characterize the natural response given in Eq. 8.4. This requires 
two equations based on the following observations:
• The initial value of the voltage in Eq. 8.4 must be the same as the 
initial value of the voltage in the circuit.
• The initial value of the first derivative of the voltage in Eq. 8.4 must 
be the same as the initial value of the first derivative of the voltage 
in the circuit.
As we will see, the natural-response equations, as well as the equations 
for evaluating the unknown coefficients, are slightly different for each of 
the three types of damping. This is why the first task that presents itself 
when finding the natural response is to determine whether the response is 
overdamped, underdamped, or critically damped.

 
8.2 The Forms of the Natural Response of a Parallel RLC Circuit

 The Overdamped Response
When the roots of the characteristic equation are real and distinct, the 
response of a parallel RLC circuit is overdamped. The solution for the 
voltage is

A1 and A2 are determined by the initial conditions, specifically from the 
values of (0 )

,
v

 which in turn are determined from the ini-
tial voltage on the capacitor, V ,

To determine the values of A1 and A2, we need two independent 
equations. The first equation sets the initial value v from Eq. 8.9 equal to 
the initial value of v in the circuit, which is the initial voltage for the capac-
itor, V0. The resulting equation is

terms of the initial current in the capacitor:

Now we use KCL to find the initial current in the capacitor. We know 
that the sum of the three branch currents at t

=

initial current in the resistive branch is the initial voltage V0 divided by the 
resistance, and the initial current in the inductive branch is I .

Natural and Step Responses of RLC Circuits
The method for finding the voltage for the parallel RLC circuit in 
Fig. 8.5 is as follows:
Step 1: Determine the initial values of capacitor voltage, V0, and inductor 
current, I0, by analyzing the parallel RLC circuit for t

Step 2: Determine the values of the neper frequency, α, and the resonant 
radian frequency,

a parallel RLC circuit.

 In 
this underdamped case, A1 and A2 are complex conjugates, and thus B1 
and B2 are real. (See Problems 8.11 and 8.12.) Defining the underdamped  
response in terms of the coefficients B1 and B2 yields a simple expres-
sion for the voltage, v. We determine B1 and B2 in the same way that we 
found A1 and A2 for the overdamped response—by solving two simulta-
neous equations. The first equation sets the initial value v from Eq. 8.15 
equal to the initial value of v in the circuit. The second equation sets the 
initial value of d

v
 from Eq. 8.15 equal to the initial value of d

in the circuit. Note that the initial values of v and d

 in the circuit 
are the same in both the underdamped and overdamped cases. For the 
underdamped response, the two simultaneous equations that determine 
B1 and B2 are

The overall process for finding the underdamped response is the same 
as that for the overdamped response, although the response equations and 
the simultaneous equations used to find the constants are slightly differ-
ent. We can modify Steps 3, 4, and 5 in the method for finding the voltage 
for the parallel RLC circuit to accommodate the differences.

Characteristics of the Underdamped Response
Let’s look at the general nature of the underdamped response. From  
Eq. 8.15 and the plot in Fig. 8.9 we know that the voltage alternates, or oscil-
lates between positive and negative values. The voltage oscillates because 
there are two types of energy-storage elements in the circuit: the inductor 
and the capacitor. (A mechanical analogy of this electric circuit is that of a 
mass suspended on a spring, where oscillation is possible because energy 
can be stored in both the spring and the moving mass.) The oscillation rate 
is fixed by ωd and the oscillation amplitude decreases exponentially at a rate 
determined by α, so α is also called the damping factor or damping coeffi-
cient. That explains why 
d
ω  is called the damped radian frequency.
If there is no damping, 
0
α =
 and the frequency of oscillation is 
.
0
ω
 
Whenever there is a dissipative element, R, in the circuit, α is not zero 
and the frequency of oscillation, 
,
d
ω
 is less than 
.
0
ω
 Thus, when α is not 
zero, the frequency of oscillation is said to be damped. As the dissipative 
losses in the circuit decrease, the persistence of the oscillations increases, 
and the frequency of the oscillations approaches 
.
0
ω
 In other words, as

b) Figure 8.9 shows the plot of v(t) versus t for the 
first 11 ms after the stored energy is released. It 
clearly indicates that the underdamped response is 
a damped oscillation. The voltage v(t) approaches 
its final value, alternating between values that 
are greater than and less than the final value. 
Furthermore, these swings about the final value 
decrease exponentially with time.

Natural and Step Responses of RLC Circuits
In this case, the oscillation is sustained at a frequency of 1000 rad/s and the 
maximum amplitude of the voltage is 98 V.
Let’s examine the qualitative differences between an underdamped 
and an overdamped response. In an underdamped system, the response 
oscillates, or “bounces,” about its final value. This oscillation is also called 
ringing. In an overdamped system, the response approaches its final value 
without ringing or in what is sometimes described as a “sluggish” manner. 
When specifying the desired response of a second-order system, you have 
two options:
• Reach the final value in the shortest time possible, without concern 
for the small oscillations about that final value that will eventu-
ally cease. Therefore, design the system components to achieve an  
underdamped response.
• Do not allow the response to exceed its final value, perhaps to ensure 
that components are not damaged. Therefore, design the system com-
ponents to achieve an overdamped response, and accept a relatively 
slow rise to the final value.

Thus, when the roots of the characteristic equation are equal, the

This solution involves a simple exponential term plus the product of a lin-
ear term and an exponential term. The justification of Eq. 8.19 is left for 
an introductory course in differential equations.
There are only two unknowns in Eq. 8.19, D1 and D2. We find their 
values in the same way we found A1 and A2 for the overdamped response 
and B1 and B2for the underdamped response—by solving two simultane-
ous equations.
One equation sets the initial value v from Eq. 8.19 equal to the ini-
tial value of v in the circuit. The second equation sets the initial value of 
d
dt
v
 from Eq. 8.19 equal to the initial value of d
dt
v
 in the circuit. Note 
that the initial values of v and d
dt
v
 in the circuit are the same in the 
underdamped, overdamped, and critically damped cases. For the critically 

damped response, the two simultaneous equations that determine D1 and 
D2 are

The overall process for finding the critically damped response is the 
same as that for the overdamped and underdamped responses, but again, 
the response equation and the simultaneous equations used to find the 
constants are slightly different. We can modify Steps 3, 4, and 5 in the 
method for finding the voltage for the parallel RLC circuit to accommo-
date the differences.

Natural and Step Responses of RLC Circuits
You will rarely encounter critically damped systems in practice, 
largely because 
0
ω  must equal α exactly. Both of these quantities depend 
on circuit parameters, and in a real circuit it is very difficult to choose 
component values that satisfy an exact equality relationship. Even so, 
Example 8.5 illustrates the approach for finding the critically damped 
response of a parallel RLC circuit.

8.3 The Step Response of a Parallel RLC Circuit

8.3 The Step Response of a Parallel 
RLC Circuit
Now we find the step response of a parallel RLC circuit, represented by 
the circuit shown in Fig. 8.11. The step response results from the sudden 
application of a dc current source. Energy may or may not be stored in the 
circuit when the current source is applied. We develop a general approach 
to the step response by finding the current in the inductive branch i(
)
L .
Why do we find the inductor current? Remember that for the nat-
ural response, we found the voltage because it was the same for all of 
the parallel-connected components, and we could use the voltage to find 
the current in any branch. But to find the step response, we need to sat-
isfy three constraints. Two of the constraints are established by the ini-
tial values of the capacitor voltage and the inductor current, just as in 
the  natural-response problem. For the step-response problem, a third 
constraint arises from a nonzero final value that exists because there is a 
source in the circuit for t
0
≥
.
We draw the circuit in Fig. 8.11 as t →∞. In the presence of the dc 
current source, the capacitor behaves like an open circuit, and the induc-
tor behaves like a short circuit, which shunts the resistor. The resulting 
circuit is shown in Fig. 8.12, where we see that the only nonzero final value 
is the inductor current. This explains why we find the inductor current and 
not the voltage in the parallel RLC step response.

(8.23)
Compare Eq. 8.23 with Eq. 8.1—they have the same form, but note the 
nonzero constant on the right-hand side of Eq. 8.23. Before showing how 
to solve Eq. 8.23 directly, we find its solution indirectly. When we know 
the solution of Eq. 8.23, explaining the direct approach will be easier.
The Indirect Approach
We can solve for iL indirectly by first finding the voltage v . We use the 
techniques introduced in Section  8.2 because the differential equation 
that v  must satisfy is identical to Eq. 8.1. To see this, we simply return to 
Eq. 8.22 and express iL as a function of v ; thus

where I0 is the initial current in the inductor. Differentiating once with 
respect to t reduces the right-hand side to zero because I is a constant and 
eliminates I0 from the left-hand side for the same reason. Thus

the primed constants can be found indirectly in terms of the arbitrary

cumbersome.
The Direct Approach
As we have just seen, the solution for a second-order differential equa-
tion with a constant forcing function equals the forced response, plus a 
response function identical in form to the natural response. Thus, we can 
always write the solution for the step response in the form

where I f and Vf  represent the final value of the response function. The 
final value may be zero, as we saw for the voltage v  in the circuit in Fig. 8.12.
As we have already noted, the only quantity with a nonzero final 
value in the circuit of Fig. 8.11 is the inductor current. Let’s construct a 
method for finding the parallel RLC step response for the inductor cur-
rent by altering the parallel RLC natural-response method.
Step 1: Determine the initial values of capacitor voltage, V0, and inductor 
current, I0, by analyzing the parallel RLC circuit for t
0
<
. In this step, we 
also need to find the final value of the inductor current, If, by analyzing the 
circuit as t

EXAMPLE 8.6 
 Finding the Overdamped Step Response of a  
Parallel RLC Circuit
The initial energy stored in the circuit in Fig. 8.13 is 
zero. At t

 a dc current source of 24 mA is applied 
to the circuit. The value of the resistor is 400 Ω. Find

Solution
Follow the steps in Analysis Method 8.4.
Step 1: The initial values of capacitor voltage, V0, and 
inductor current, I0, are both zero because the initial 
stored energy is zero. As t
,
→∞ the capacitor behaves 
like an open circuit and the inductor behaves like a 
short circuit that shunts the resistor, so all of the current 
from the source is in the inductor. Thus, I

200  s, the overdamped, underdamped, and

damped 
responses 
derived 
in  
Examples 8.6–8.8.
b) Use the plots of (a) to find the time required for 
iL to reach 90% of its final value.
c) On the basis of the results obtained in (b), which 
response would you specify in a design that puts 
a premium on reaching 90% of the final value of 
the output in the shortest time?
d) Which response would you specify in a design 
that must ensure that the final value of the cur-
rent is never exceeded?
Solution
a) See Fig. 8.14.
b) The final value of iL is 24 mA, so we can 
read the times off the plots corresponding to 
i
21.6 mA.

c) The underdamped response reaches 90% of the 
final value in the fastest time, so it is the desired 
response type when speed is the most important 
design specification.
d) From the plot, you can see that the underdamped 
response overshoots the final value of current, 
whereas neither the critically damped nor the 
overdamped response produces currents in 
excess of 24 mA. Although specifying either of 
the latter two responses would meet the design 
specification, it is best to use the overdamped 
response. It would be impractical to require a 
design to achieve the exact component values 
that ensure a critically damped response.

 8.4 The Natural and Step Responses 
of a Series RLC Circuit
The procedures for finding the natural and step responses of a series RLC 
circuit are the same as those used to find the natural and step responses of 
a parallel RLC circuit because both circuits are described by differential 
equations that have the same form. For the natural-response problem, we 
solve for the current because it is the same for all circuit components. We 
begin by summing the voltages, expressed in terms of the current, around 
the closed path in the circuit shown in Fig. 8.15. Thus

Natural and Step Responses of RLC Circuits
Once you know the current you can find the voltage across any circuit 
element.
Let’s construct a method for finding the series RLC natural response for 
the circuit’s current by altering the parallel RLC natural-response method.
Step 1: Determine the initial values of capacitor voltage, V0, and inductor 
current, I0, by analyzing the RLC circuit. This step is unchanged.
Step 2: Determine the values of the neper frequency, ,
α  and the resonant 
radian frequency, 
,
0
ω
 using the values of R, L, and C. While the equation 
for 
0
ω  is the same for both circuits, the equation for α is different: for the 
parallel RLC, 
RC
1 (2
)
α =
, and for the series RLC, 
R 2L.
α =
Step 3: Compare α 2 and 
0
2
ω  to determine the response form. Use the 
appropriate equation for the circuit current from Eqs. 8.31–8.33.
Step 4: If the response is overdamped, calculate the values of s1 and s2. If 
the response is underdamped, calculate the value of 
.
d
ω
 If the response is 
critically damped, you can skip this step. No changes are needed in this step.
Step 5: Calculate the values of the A, B, and D coefficients by simulta-
neously solving two equations. To construct the first equation, we evalu-
ate the expression for i(t) from Step 3 at t
0
=
+ and set it equal to the 
initial inductor current, I0. For example, in the overdamped case the first 
 equation is
+

in the underdamped case, the first equation is

and in the critically damped case, the first equation is

To construct the second equation, we find di dt from the circuit current 
in Step 3, evaluate it at t
0
=
+ and set it equal to the initial value of di dt 
from the circuit. How do we find the initial value of di dt from the circuit? 
We use the relationship between voltage and current in an inductor to get
di

L

(0 ).
L
v
=

But we don’t know the initial voltage across the inductor, so we use KVL to 
find it. We know that the sum of the three component voltages at t
0
=
+ 
must be zero. The voltage across the resistor at t
0
=
+ is the product of 
the initial current (I0) and the resistance, and the voltage across the capaci-
tor at t

The steps for finding the natural response for a parallel RLC circuit 
are condensed into Analysis Method 8.5. All of the equations you will 
need are collected in Table 8.4.
To verify that the procedure for finding the step response of a series 
RLC circuit is similar to that for a parallel RLC circuit, we show that the 
differential equation that describes the capacitor voltage in Fig. 8.16 has 
the same form as the differential equation that describes the inductor cur-

 Hence, from the circuit shown in

Let’s look at how to alter the series RLC natural-response method 
(Analysis Method 8.5) to find the series RLC step response for the 
 capacitor voltage.
Step 1: Determine the initial values of capacitor voltage, V0, and induc-
tor current, I0, by analyzing the RLC circuit. In this step, we also need to 
find the final value of the capacitor voltage, Vf, by analyzing the circuit as 
t

radian frequency,

needed for this step.
Step 3: Compare

 Here we replace the natural response for 
the current with the step response for the capacitor voltage, given in  
Eqs. 8.35–8.37.
Step 4: If the response is overdamped, calculate the values of s1 and s2. If 
the response is underdamped, calculate the value of

 If the response 
is critically damped, you can skip this step. No changes are needed in this 
step.
Step 5: Here we calculate the values of the A

,

′  and D′ coefficients by 
simultaneously solving two equations. To construct the first equation, we 
evaluate the expression for vC(t) from Step 3 at t

the initial capacitor voltage, V0. For example, in the overdamped case the 
first equation is

The steps for finding the step response for a series RLC circuit are con-
densed into Analysis Method 8.6. All of the equations you will need are 
collected in Table 8.5.
Examples 8.11 and 8.12 find the natural and step responses of a series 
RLC circuit.

for the current in every component is in the direction of the reference voltage drop across that 
component.)

8.5 A Circuit with Two Integrating 
Amplifiers
A circuit containing two integrating amplifiers connected in cascade1 
is also a second-order circuit; that is, the output voltage of the second 
integrator is related to the input voltage of the first by a second-order 
 differential equation. We begin our analysis of a circuit containing two 
cascaded amplifiers with the circuit shown in Fig. 8.19.

Natural and Step Responses of RLC Circuits

Clock for Computer Timing
Consider the circuit in Fig. 8.22, where the output is the voltage drop 
across the capacitor. For 
0.
≥
t
 this circuit looks like the series RLC 
 natural-response circuit of Fig. 8.3 without its resistor. When we analyze 
this LC circuit, we will discover that its output is an undamped sinusoid, 
which a computer’s clock generator could use instead of the typical 
quartz crystal oscillator. We will be able to specify the frequency of the 
clock by selecting appropriate values for the inductor and capacitor.
Since this is a series RLC natural-response problem, we follow 
Analysis Method 8.5, which uses Table 8.4. Remember that R

capacitor acts like an open circuit, whose voltage is V0, and the inductor 
acts like a short circuit, whose current is I 0 . The capacitor and inductor 
have the same voltage, and since the inductor’s voltage is 0, V

So why is a quartz crystal used to generate the sinusoid for the clock

But ideal inductors and capacitors do not exist—real inductors and ca-

ine the effect of this small amount of resistance on the performance of 
an LC oscillator in the Chapter Problems.

• To determine the step response of a series RLC circuit, 
follow the steps in Analysis Method 8.6, using the equa-

• When two integrating amplifiers with ideal op amps are 
connected in cascade, the output voltage of the second 
integrator is related to the input voltage of the first by an 
ordinary, second-order differential equation. Therefore, 
the techniques developed in this chapter may be used 
to analyze the behavior of a cascaded integrator. (See 
pages 303 and 304.)
• We can overcome the limitation of a simple integrating 
amplifier—the saturation of the op amp due to charge 
accumulating in the feedback capacitor—by placing a 
resistor in parallel with the capacitor in the feedback 
path. (See page 305.)

CHAPTER 
Sinusoida l  
Steady-State Analysis
Thus far, we have focused on circuits with constant sources; 
in this chapter we are now ready to consider circuits energized 
by sinusoidal voltage or current sources. For these circuits, we 
will calculate the values of the specified output voltages and 
currents in the steady state. This means we will not know the 
complete response of the circuits, which in general is the sum of 
the transient (or natural) response and the steady-state response. 
Our analysis will only characterize a circuit’s response once the 
transient component has decayed to zero.
Sinusoidal sources and their effect on circuit behavior form 
an important area of study for several reasons.
• Generating, transmitting, distributing, and consuming elec-
tric energy occurs under essentially sinusoidal steady-state 
conditions.
• Understanding sinusoidal behavior makes it possible to 
predict the behavior of circuits with nonsinusoidal sources.
• Specifying the behavior of an electrical system in terms of 
its steady-state sinusoidal response simplifies the design. If 
the system satisfies the specifications, the designer knows 
that the circuit will respond satisfactorily to nonsinusoidal 
inputs.
The remaining chapters of this book are largely based on the 
techniques used when analyzing circuits with sinusoidal sources. 
Fortunately, the circuit analysis and simplification techniques 
from Chapters 1–4 work for circuits with sinusoidal as well as dc 
sources, so some of the material in this chapter will be very famil-
iar to you. The challenges of sinusoidal analysis include devel-
oping the appropriate component models, writing the equations 
that describe the resulting circuit, and working with complex 
numbers.

CHAPTER OBJECTIVES

Practical Perspective
A Household Distribution Circuit
Power systems that generate, transmit, and distribute 
electrical power are designed to operate in the sinusoidal 
steady state. The standard household distribution circuit 
used in the United States supplies both 120 V and 240 V.
Consider the following situation. At the end of a day 
of fieldwork, a farmer returns to the farmstead, checks 
the hog confinement building, and finds the hogs are 
dead. The problem is traced to a blown fuse that caused 
a 240 V fan motor to stop. The loss of ventilation led to 
the suffocation of the livestock. The interrupted fuse is 
located in the main switch that connects the farmstead to 
the electrical service.
Before the insurance company settles the claim, 
it wants to know if the electric circuit supplying the 
farmstead functioned properly. The lawyers for the insur-
ance company are puzzled because one of the farmer’s 
children was home from school and spent part of the day 
playing video games in the living room. At one point they 
used the kitchen microwave to reheat some leftovers. 
The lawyers have hired you to explain why the kitchen 
appliances and the living room electronics continued to 
operate after the fuse in the main switch blew.
We will explore this situation and answer the question 
after learning how to calculate the steady-state response 
of circuits with sinusoidal sources.

Sinusoida l Steady-State Analysis 
9.1 The Sinusoidal Source
A sinusoidal voltage source (independent or dependent) produces a 
voltage that varies sinusoidally with time. A sinusoidal current source 
(independent or dependent) produces a current that varies sinusoidally 
with time. We begin by reviewing the sinusoidal function, using a voltage 
source as an example, but our observations also apply to current sources.
We can express a sinusoidally varying function with either the sine 
function or the cosine function. Although they work equally well, we 
 cannot use both functional forms simultaneously. We will use the cosine 
function throughout our discussion. Hence, we write a sinusoidally vary-
ing voltage as

V

v
 
(9.1)
To aid discussion of the parameters in Eq. 9.1, we show the voltage ver-
sus time plot in Fig. 9.1. The coefficient Vm gives the maximum amplitude 
of the sinusoidal voltage. Because 
1
±  bounds the cosine function, 
Vm
±
 
bounds the amplitude, as seen in Fig. 9.1. You can also see that the sinusoi-
dal function repeats at regular intervals; therefore, it is a periodic function. 
A periodic function is characterized by the time required for the function to 
pass through all its possible values. This time is the period of the function, T, 
and is measured in seconds. The reciprocal of T gives the number of cycles 
per second, or the frequency, of the periodic function, and is denoted f, so
 
f
T
1 .
=
 
(9.2)
A cycle per second is called a hertz, abbreviated Hz. (The term cycles per 
second rarely is used in contemporary technical literature.)
Now look at the coefficient of t in Eq. 9.1. Omega ( )
ω  represents the 
angular frequency of the sinusoidal function and is related to both T and f:
 
 
f

(9.3)
Equation 9.3 tells us that the cosine (or sine) function passes through 
a complete set of values each time its argument, 
t,
ω  passes through 
2 rad(360 )
π
° . From Eq. 9.3, we see that whenever t is an integral multiple 
of T, the argument t
ω  increases by an integral multiple of 2π rad.
The angle φ in Eq. 9.1 is the phase angle of the sinusoidal voltage. It 
determines the value of the sinusoidal function at t
0;
=
 therefore, it fixes 
the point on the periodic wave where we start measuring time. Changing 
the phase angle φ shifts the sinusoidal function along the time axis but 
has no effect on either the amplitude V
(
)
m  or the angular frequency ( )
ω . 
Note, for example, that reducing φ to zero shifts the sinusoidal function 
shown in Fig. 9.1 φ ω time units to the right, as shown in Fig. 9.2. When 
compared with a sinusoidal function with 
0,
φ =
 a sinusoidal function 
with a positive φ is shifted to the left, while a sinusoidal function with a 
negative φ is shifted to the right. (See Problem 9.1.)
Remember that t
ω  and φ must carry the same units because the argu-
ment of the sinusoidal function is 
t
(
).
ω
φ
+
 With t
ω  expressed in radians, 
you would expect φ to also be in radians. However, φ normally is given 
in degrees, and t
ω  is converted from radians to degrees before the two 
quantities are added. The conversion from radians to degrees is given by
(numberof degrees)
180 (numberof radians).

9.1 The Sinusoidal Source

Another important characteristic of the sinusoidal voltage (or cur-
rent) is its rms value. The rms value of a periodic function is defined 
as the square root of the mean value of the squared function. Hence, if

Note from Eq. 9.4 that we obtain the mean value of the squared voltage 
by integrating v 2 over one period (that is, from t 0 to

dividing by the range of integration, T. Note further that the starting point 
for the integration t 0 is arbitrary.

The rms value of the sinusoidal voltage depends only on the maximum 
amplitude of v , namely, V .
m  The rms value is not a function of either the 
frequency or the phase angle. In Chapter 10, we explain the importance 
of the rms value and use it extensively to calculate power in circuits with 
sinusoidal sources.
We can completely describe a specific sinusoidal signal if we know its 
frequency, phase angle, and amplitude. Examples 9.1, 9.2, and 9.3 illus-
trate these basic properties of the sinusoidal function. In Example 9.4, we 
calculate the rms value of a periodic function, and in so doing we clarify 
the meaning of root mean square.

As stated in the Introduction, this chapter focuses on the steady-state 
 response to sinusoidal sources. But we begin by characterizing the total 
response, which will help you keep the steady-state solution in perspective.

 using a method similar to the one used when finding the step 
response of an RL circuit (Chapter 7). But here, the voltage source is

Sinusoida l Steady-State Analysis 
Thus, we can easily determine θ for a circuit driven by a sinusoidal source 
of known frequency. We can check that Eq. 9.7 is valid by showing that it 
satisfies Eq. 9.6 for all values of t
0
≥
; this exercise is left for your explo-
ration in Problem 9.10.
Look carefully at the two terms on the right-hand side of Eq. 9.7. 
The first term is a decaying exponential function whose time constant is 
L R.
τ =
 This term is the transient component of the current because it 
decays to zero as t
0.
→
 Remember from Chapter 7 that this transient 
component has less than 1% of its initial value when t
5 .τ
=
The second term is a cosine whose frequency is ,
ω  the same as the fre-
quency of the voltage source. This is the steady-state component of the cur-
rent because it persists as long as the switch remains closed and the source 
continues to supply the sinusoidal voltage. In this chapter, we find only the 
steady-state response of circuits with sinusoidal sources; that is, we find the 
response once its transient component has decayed to zero. We develop a 
technique for calculating the steady-state response directly, thus avoiding the 
problem of solving the differential equation. However, when we use this tech-
nique, we cannot find either the transient component or the total response.
Using the steady-state component of Eq. 9.7, we identify four import-
ant characteristics of the steady-state solution:
1. The steady-state solution is a cosine function, just like the circuit’s 
source.
2. The frequency of the solution is identical to the frequency of the 
source. This condition is always true in a linear circuit when the 
circuit parameters, R, L, and C, are constant. (If frequencies in 
the solution are not present in the source, there is a nonlinear ele-
ment in the circuit.)
3.  The maximum amplitude of the steady-state response, in general, dif-
fers from the maximum amplitude of the source. For the circuit in 
Fig. 9.5, the maximum amplitude of the current is V

the phase angle of the source. For the circuit being discussed, the phase 
angle of the current is φ

φ
These characteristics motivate the phasor method, which we introduce  
in Section 9.3. Note that finding only the steady-state response means 
finding only its maximum amplitude and phase angle. The waveform and 
frequency of the steady-state response are already known because they 
are the same as the circuit’s source.

9.3 The Phasor
A phasor is a complex number that carries the amplitude and phase angle 
information of a sinusoidal function.1 The phasor concept is rooted in Euler’s 
identity, which relates the exponential function to the trigonometric function:

Euler’s identity gives us another way of representing the cosine and sine 
functions. We can think of the cosine function as the real part of the

and

where R means “the real part of” and I means “the imaginary part of.”
Because we chose to use the cosine function to represent sinusoidal 
signals (see Section 9.1), we can apply Euler’s identity directly. In partic-
ular, we write the sinusoidal voltage function given in Eq. 9.1 by replacing 
the cosine function with the real part of the complex exponential:

We can move the constant Vm inside the argument of the R function with-
out altering the equation. We can also reverse the order of the two expo-
nential functions inside the argument and write the voltage as

In this expression for the voltage, note that the quantity V e

number that carries the amplitude and phase angle of the cosine function 
we started with (Eq. 9.1). We define this complex number as the phasor 
representation, or phasor transform, of the given sinusoidal function. Thus

also called the frequency domain, since the response depends, in general, 
on .
ω  As in Eq. 9.8, throughout this text we represent a phasor quantity by 
using a boldface capital letter.
Equation 9.8 is the polar form of a phasor, but we also can express a 
phasor in rectangular form. Thus, we rewrite Eq. 9.8 as

Both polar and rectangular forms are useful in circuit applications of the 
phasor concept.
We see from Eq. 9.8 that phasors always have the form Ae

abbreviate phasors using the angle notation A

because it carries only amplitude and phase information. When we trans-
form a phasor to the corresponding time-domain expression, we use the 
inverse phasor transform function, as shown in the equation

this type of problem.

9.4  The Passive Circuit Elements 
in the Frequency Domain
Applying the phasor transform in circuit analysis is a two-step process.
1. Establish the relationship between the phasor current and the pha-
sor voltage at the terminals of the passive circuit elements. We com-
plete this step in this section, analyzing the resistor, inductor, and 
capacitor in the phasor domain.
2. Develop the phasor-domain version of Kirchhoff’s laws, which we 
discuss in Section 9.5.

which states that the phasor voltage at the terminals of a resistor is the 
resistance times the phasor current—the phasor version of Ohm’s law. 
Figure 9.8 shows the circuit diagram for a resistor in the frequency domain.
 Equation 9.10 contains an important piece of information—namely, 
that at the terminals of a resistor, there is no phase shift between the cur-
rent and voltage. Figure 9.9 depicts this phase relationship, where the 
phase angle of both the voltage and the current waveforms is 60 .°  The sig-
nals are said to be in phase because they both reach corresponding values 
on their respective curves at the same time (for example, they are at their 
positive maxima at the same instant).
The V-I Relationship for an Inductor
We derive the relationship between the phasor current and phasor 
voltage at the terminals of an inductor by assuming a sinusoidal cur-
rent and using Ldi dt  to establish the corresponding voltage. Thus, for

Equation 9.11 states that the phasor voltage at the terminals of an 
inductor equals j L
ω
 times the phasor current. Figure 9.10 shows the 
 frequency-domain equivalent circuit for the inductor. Note that the rela-
tionship between phasor voltage and phasor current for an inductor also 
applies for the mutual inductance in one coil due to current flowing in 
another mutually coupled coil. That is, the phasor voltage at the terminals 
of one coil in a mutually coupled pair of coils equals j M
ω
 times the pha-
sor current in the other coil.

which indicates that the voltage and current are out of phase by exactly 
90 .°  Specifically, the voltage leads the current by 90 ,°  or, equivalently, 
the current lags the voltage by 90°. Figure 9.11 illustrates the concept of 
 voltage leading current or current lagging voltage. For example, the voltage 
reaches its negative peak exactly 90° before the current reaches its neg-
ative peak. The same observation can be made with respect to the zero- 
going-positive crossing or the positive peak.
We can also express the phase shift in seconds. A phase shift of 90° 
corresponds to one-fourth of a period; hence, the voltage leads the current 
by T 4, or 
f
1 (4 ) second.
The V-I Relationship for a Capacitor

Equation 9.12 demonstrates that the equivalent circuit for the capacitor in

Thus, we can also say that the current leads the voltage by 90°. Figure 9.13 
shows the phase relationship between the current and voltage at the ter-
minals of a capacitor.
 Impedance and Reactance
We conclude this discussion of passive circuit elements in the frequency 
domain with an important observation. When we compare Eqs. 9.10, 9.11, 
and 9.12, we note that they are all of the form
where Z represents the impedance of the circuit element. Solving for Z 
in Eq. 9.13, you can see that impedance is the ratio of a circuit element’s 
voltage phasor to its current phasor. Thus, the impedance of a resistor is R, 
the impedance of an inductor is j L,
ω
 the impedance of mutual inductance 
is j M,
ω
 and the impedance of a capacitor is 
j C

 In all cases, imped-
ance is measured in ohms. Note that, although impedance is a complex 
number, it is not a phasor. Remember, a phasor is a complex number that

9.4 The Passive Circuit Elements in the Frequency Domain

results from the phasor transform of a cosine waveform. Thus, although 
all phasors are complex numbers, not all complex numbers are phasors.
Impedance in the frequency domain is the quantity analogous to resis-
tance, inductance, and capacitance in the time domain. The imaginary 
part of the impedance is called reactance. The values of impedance and 
reactance for each of the component values are summarized in Table 9.1.
And, finally, a reminder. The passive sign convention holds in the 
frequency domain. If the reference direction for the current phasor in a 
circuit element is in the direction of the voltage phasor rise across the 
element, you must insert a minus sign into the equation that relates the 
voltage phasor to the current phasor.
Work through Example 9.6 to practice transforming circuit compo-
nents from the time domain to the phasor domain.

9.6 Series, Parallel, and Delta-to-Wye Simplifications

Equations 9.13, 9.14, and 9.15 form the basis for circuit analysis in 
the frequency domain. Note that Eq. 9.13 has the same algebraic form 
as Ohm’s law and that Eqs. 9.14 and 9.15 state Kirchhoff’s laws for pha-
sor quantities. Therefore, you can use all the techniques developed for 
analyzing resistive circuits to find phasor currents and voltages. No new 
analytical techniques are needed; the basic circuit analysis and simplifi-
cation tools covered in Chapters 2–4 can all be used to analyze circuits in 
the frequency domain. Phasor-circuit analysis consists of two fundamental 
tasks: (1) You must be able to construct the frequency-domain model of a 
circuit; and (2) you must be able to manipulate complex numbers and/or 
quantities algebraically.
 Example 9.7 illustrates the use of KVL in the frequency domain.
EXAMPLE 9.7 
Using KVL in the Frequency Domain
a) Use the results from Example 9.6 to calculate the 
phasor voltage drop, from left to right, across the 
series combination of the resistive and inductive 
impedances in Fig. 9.15.
b) Use the phasor voltage found in (a) to calculate 
the steady-state voltage drop, from left to right, 
across the series combination of resistor and 
inductor in Fig. 9.14.

Remember from Chapter 3 that we can use voltage division to find the 
voltage across a single component from a collection of series- connected  
components whose total voltage is known (Eq. 3.9). We derived the volt-
age division equation using the equation for the equivalent resistance of 
series-connected resistors. Using the same process, we can derive the volt-
age division equation for frequency-domain circuits, where Vs is the volt-
age applied to a collection of series-connected impedances, Vj is the voltage 
across the impedance Zj, and Zeq is the equivalent impedance of the series- 
connected impedances:
Example 9.8 illustrates the following frequency-domain circuit analysis 
techniques: combining impedances in series, Ohm’s law for phasors, and 
voltage division.

the  current division equation for frequency-domain circuits, where Is is

Solution
It is not possible to simplify the circuit in Fig. 9.23 
using series and parallel combinations of imped-
ances. But if we replace either the upper delta (abc) 
or the lower delta (bcd) with its Y equivalent, we 
can simplify the resulting circuit by series-parallel 
combinations. To decide which delta to replace, 
find the sum of the impedances around each delta. 
This quantity forms the denominator for the equiv-
alent Y impedances. The sum around the lower 
delta is 
j

 so we choose to transform the 
lower delta to its equivalent Y. The Y impedance

9.7 Source Transformations and Thévenin–Norton Equivalent Circuits 
341
Figure 9.27 illustrates the frequency-domain version of a Thévenin 
equivalent circuit, and Fig. 9.28 shows the frequency-domain equivalent 
of a Norton equivalent circuit. The techniques for finding the Thévenin 
equivalent voltage and impedance are identical to those used for resistive 
circuits, except that the frequency-domain equivalent circuit involves pha-
sors and complex numbers. The same holds for finding the Norton equiv-
alent current and impedance.
Example 9.11 demonstrates the application of the  source-transformation 
equivalent circuit to frequency-domain analysis. Example 9.12 illustrates 
the details of finding a Thévenin equivalent circuit in the frequency domain.
EXAMPLE 9.11  Performing Source Transformations in the Frequency Domain

phasor voltage V0 in the circuit shown in Fig. 9.29.

Solution
We first determine the Thévenin equivalent voltage. 
This voltage is the open-circuit voltage  appearing 
at terminals a,b. We choose the reference for the 
Thévenin voltage as positive at terminal a. We can 
make two source transformations using the 120 V, 
Ω
12
, and 
Ω
60
 circuit elements to simplify the left-
hand side of the circuit. These transformations must 
preserve the identity of the controlling voltage Vx 
because of the dependent voltage source.
The first source transformation replaces the 
series combination of the 120 V source and 
Ω
12
 
resistor with a 10 A current source in parallel with 
Ω
12
. Next, we replace the parallel combination of 
the 12 and 
Ω

 resistors with a single

tor. Finally, we replace the parallel-connected 10 A 
source and

with

We can find the Thévenin impedance using any 
of the techniques in Sections 4.10–4.11 for finding 
Thévenin resistance. We use the test-source method 
in this example. We begin by deactivating all inde-
pendent sources in the circuit, and then we apply 
either a test-voltage source or a  test-current source 
to the terminals of interest. The ratio of the volt-
age to the current at the test source is the Thévenin 
impedance. Figure 9.34 presents the result of apply-
ing this technique to the circuit shown in Fig. 9.32 
while preserving the identity of V .

Sinusoida l Steady-State Analysis 
9.8 The Node-Voltage Method
In Sections 4.2–4.4, we introduced the node-voltage method of circuit 
analysis, culminating in Analysis Method 4.3 (p. 102). We can use this 
analysis method to find the steady-state response for circuits with sinusoi-
dal sources. We need to make a few modifications:
• If the circuit is in the time domain, it must be transformed to the 
appropriate frequency domain. To do this, transform known volt-
ages and currents to phasors, replace unknown voltages and currents 
with phasor symbols, and replace the component values for resistors, 
inductors, mutually coupled coils, and capacitors with their imped-
ance values.
• Follow the steps in Analysis Method 4.3 to find the values of the 
unknown voltage and current phasors of interest.
• Apply the inverse phasor transform to the voltage and current pha-
sors to find the steady-state values of the corresponding voltages and 
currents in the time domain.
Example 9.13 illustrates these steps. Assessment Problem 9.12 and many 
of the chapter problems give you an opportunity to use the node-voltage 
method to solve for steady-state sinusoidal responses.
 EXAMPLE 9.13  Using the Node-Voltage Method in the Frequency Domain
Use the node-voltage method to find the branch 
currents ia, ib, and ic in the steady-state, for the cir-
cuit shown in Fig. 9.36. The value of the current 
source in this circuit is i
t
10.6cos(500 )A
s =
.
Now we can employ Analysis Method 4.3.
Step 1:  The circuit has three essential nodes, two at 
the top and one on the bottom. We will need two 
KCL equations to describe the circuit.
Step 2:  Four branches terminate on the bottom 
node, so we select it as the reference node and label 
the node voltages at the remaining essential nodes. 
The results of the first two steps are shown in Fig. 9.38.

10.6 0 A

and ix with corresponding phasor symbols Ia, Ib, Ic, 
and Ix. Then we  replace the inductor and capacitor 
values with their impedances, using the frequency

9.9 The Mesh-Current Method
We can also use the mesh-current method to analyze frequency-domain 
circuits. If a problem begins with a circuit in the time domain, it needs to 
be transformed into the frequency domain. Then, Analysis Method 4.6 
(p. 110) can be used to find the mesh-current phasors, just as it was used 
to find mesh currents in resistive circuits. Finally, apply the inverse phasor 
transform to the phasor voltages and currents to find the steady-state volt-
ages and currents in the time domain. We use the mesh-current method to 
analyze a frequency-domain circuit in Example 9.14.

 9.10 The Transformer
A transformer is a device based on the magnetic coupling that charac-
terizes mutually coupled inductor coils. Transformers are used in both 
 communication and power circuits. In communication circuits, the trans-
former is used to match impedances and eliminate dc signals from por-
tions of the system. In power circuits, transformers are used to establish ac 
 voltage levels that facilitate the transmission, distribution, and consump-
tion of electrical power. We need to know how a transformer behaves in 
the sinusoidal steady state when analyzing both communication and power 
systems. In this section, we will discuss the sinusoidal steady-state behavior 
of the linear transformer, which is found primarily in communication cir-
cuits. In Section 9.11, we will present the ideal transformer, which is used 
to model the ferromagnetic transformers found in power systems.
When analyzing circuits containing mutually coupled inductor coils, 
we use the mesh-current method. The node-voltage method is hard to use 
when mutual inductance is present because the currents in the coupled 
coils cannot be written by inspection as functions of the node voltages.
The Analysis of a Linear Transformer Circuit
A simple transformer is formed when two coils are wound on a single core 
to ensure magnetic coupling. Figure 9.41 shows the  frequency- domain 
circuit model of a system that uses a transformer to connect a load to a 
source. The transformer winding connected to the source is called the 
 primary winding, and the winding connected to the load is called the 
 secondary winding. The transformer circuit parameters are

Sinusoida l Steady-State Analysis 
The internal voltage of the sinusoidal source is V ,
S  and the internal 
 impedance of the source is Z .
S  The impedance ZL  represents the load 
connected to the secondary winding of the transformer. The phasor cur-
rents I1 and I 2  are the primary and secondary currents of the transformer, 
respectively.
We analyze the circuit in Fig. 9.41 to find I1 and I 2  as functions of the 
circuit parameters VS, ZS, R1, L1, L2, R2, M, Z ,

Note that the impedance Zab is independent of the magnetic polarity 
of the transformer because the mutual inductance M appears in Eq. 9.31 as 
a squared quantity. The impedance Zab is interesting because it describes 
how the transformer affects the impedance of the load as seen from the 
source. Without the transformer, the load would be connected directly to 
the source, and the source would see a load impedance of Z ;
L  with the 
transformer, the load is connected to the source through the transformer, 
and the source sees a load impedance that is a modified version of Z ,
L  as 
seen in the third term of Eq. 9.31.
Reflected Impedance
The third term in Eq. 9.31 is called the reflected impedance Z
(
)
r  because 
it is the equivalent impedance of the secondary coil and load impedance 
transmitted, or reflected, to the primary side of the transformer. Note that 

 
9.10 The Transformer 
349
the reflected impedance exists because of the mutual inductance. If the two 
coils are not coupled, M is zero, Zr is zero, and Zab is the  self- impedance 
of the primary coil.
To consider reflected impedance in more detail, we first express the 
load impedance in rectangular form:

where the load reactance X L carries its own algebraic sign. That is, X L is a

An ideal transformer consists of two magnetically coupled coils having N1 
and N 2 turns, respectively, and exhibiting these three properties:
1. The coefficient of coupling is unity k

2.  The self-inductance of each coil is infinite L

4. The coil losses, due to parasitic resistance, are negligible.
Understanding the behavior of ideal transformers begins with Eq. 9.31, 
which describes the impedance at the terminals of a source connected to 
a linear transformer. We repeat this equation in the following discussion 
and examine it further.
Exploring Limiting Values
Equation 9.31, repeated here as Eq. 9.33, defines the relationship bet-
ween the input impedance (Zab) and load impedance (ZL) for a linear 
transformer:

Let’s consider what happens to Eq. 9.33 as L1 and L2 each become infinitely 
large and, at the same time, the coefficient of coupling approaches unity. 
Transformers wound on ferromagnetic cores can approach these condi-
tions. Even though such transformers are nonlinear, we can obtain some 
useful information using an ideal model that ignores the nonlinearities.
To show how Zab changes when k

 This follows from the relationship between L1 and N1

that, as the coupling becomes extremely tight, the two permeances P1 and

Compare this expression for Zab with the one given in Eq. 9.33. We see that

ing analysis in terms of sinusoidal steady-state operation, the results also 
apply to instantaneous values of v  and i.

DOT CONVENTION FOR IDEAL TRANSFORMERS
If the coil voltages V1 and V2 are both positive or neg-
ative at the dot-marked terminals, use a plus sign in  
Eq. 9.35. Otherwise, use a negative sign.
If the coil currents I1 and I 2 are both directed into or 
out of the dot-marked terminals, use a minus sign in  
Eq. 9.36. Otherwise, use a plus sign.
Figure 9.45 shows the graphic symbol for an ideal transformer. The 
vertical lines in the symbol represent the layers of magnetic material from 
which ferromagnetic cores are often made. Coils wound on a ferromag-
netic core behave very much like an ideal transformer, for several reasons. 
The ferromagnetic material creates a space with high permeance. Thus, 
most of the magnetic flux is trapped inside the core material, establish-
ing tight magnetic coupling between coils that share the same core. High 
permeance also means high self-inductance because 
P

 Finally, 
ferromagnetically coupled coils efficiently transfer power from one coil to 
the other. Efficiencies in excess of 95% are common, so neglecting losses 
is a valid approximation for many applications.
Determining the Polarity of the Voltage and Current 
Ratios
We now turn to the removal of the magnitude signs from Eqs. 9.35 and 
9.36. Note that magnitude signs do not appear in Eqs. 9.37 and 9.38 
 because we established reference polarities for voltages and reference 
 directions for currents in Fig. 9.44. In addition, we specified the magnetic 
polarity dots of the two coupled coils.
The rules for assigning the proper algebraic sign to Eqs. 9.35 and 9.36 
are as follows:
The four circuits shown in Fig. 9.46 illustrate these rules.

Sinusoida l Steady-State Analysis 
Using an Ideal Transformer for Impedance Matching
Ideal transformers can be used to increase or decrease the impedance 
level of a load, as illustrated by the circuit shown in Fig. 9.50. The imped-
ance seen by the practical voltage source (Vs in series with Zs) is V
I .

I 2 ) are related to V1 and I1 by the transformer turns ratio; thus

Thus, the ideal transformer’s secondary coil reflects the load impedance

Note that the ideal transformer changes the magnitude of ZL  but 
does not affect its phase angle. Whether ZIN is greater or less than ZL  
depends on the turns ratio a. The ideal transformer—or its practical coun-
terpart, the ferromagnetic core transformer—can be used to match the 
magnitude of ZL  to the magnitude of Z .
s  We will discuss why this may be 
desirable in Chapter 10.
Ideal transformers are also used to increase or decrease voltages from 
a source to a load, as we will see in Chapter 10. Thus, ideal transform-
ers are used widely in the electric utility industry, where it is desirable to 
decrease, or step down, the voltage level at the power line to safer resi-
dential voltage levels.

9.12 Phasor Diagrams
When we analyze the sinusoidal steady-state operation of a circuit using 
phasors, a diagram of the phasor currents and voltages can give us addi-
tional insight into the circuit’s behavior. A phasor diagram shows the 
 magnitude and phase angle of each phasor quantity in the  complex- number 
plane. Phase angles are measured counterclockwise from the positive real 
axis, and magnitudes are measured from the origin of the axes. For exam-
ple, Fig. 9.51 shows the phasor quantities 10
30 ,°  12
150 ,°  5
45 ,
−
°  and 
8
170 .
−
°
Because constructing phasor diagrams for circuits usually involves 
both currents and voltages, we use two different magnitude scales, one for 
currents and one for voltages. Visualizing a phasor on the  complex- number 
plane is a good way to check your calculations. For example, suppose you 
convert the phasor 
j
7 –
3
−
 to polar form. Before making your calcula-
tion, you should anticipate a magnitude greater than 7 and an angle in 
the third quadrant that is more negative than 
135
−
° or less positive than 
225 ,°  as illustrated in Fig. 9.52.
Examples 9.17 and 9.18 construct and use phasor diagrams. You can 
use phasor diagrams to get additional insight into the steady-state sinu-
soidal operation of a circuit. For example, Problem 9.83  uses a phasor 
diagram to explain the operation of a phase-shifting circuit.
EXAMPLE 9.17  Using Phasor Diagrams to Analyze a Circuit
Use a phasor diagram for the circuit in Fig. 9.53 to 
find the value of R that causes the current through 
that resistor, i ,
R  to lag the source current, i ,
s  by 45° 
when ω = 5 krad s.
Solution
According to KCL, the sum of the currents I ,
R  
I ,
L  and IC must equal the source current I .

assume that the phase angle of the voltage Vm is

the current phasors of the three circuit components 
and must be at an angle that is 45° more positive 
than the current phasor for the resistor. As you 
can see, summing the phasors makes an isosceles 
 triangle, so the length of the current phasor for the 
resistor must equal V

the resistor is Ω.

Sinusoida l Steady-State Analysis 
The circuit in Fig. 9.55 has a load consisting of the 
parallel combination of the resistor and inductor. Use 
phasor diagrams to explore the effect of adding a 
capacitor across the terminals of the load on the 
amplitude of Vs if we adjust Vs so that the amplitude 
of VL remains constant. Utility companies use this 
technique to control the voltage drop on their lines.
Solution
We begin by assuming zero capacitance across the 
load. After constructing the phasor diagram for the 
zero-capacitance case, we can add the capacitor and 
study its effect on the amplitude of V ,
s  holding the 
amplitude of VL  constant. Figure 9.56 shows the 
frequency-domain equivalent of the circuit in 
Fig. 9.55. We added the phasor branch currents I, 
I ,
a  and I b to Fig. 9.56 to assist our analysis.
Figure 9.57 shows the stepwise evolution of the 
phasor diagram. Keep in mind that in this example 
we are not interested in specific phasor values and 
positions, but rather in the general effect of adding 
a capacitor across the terminals of the load. Thus, 
we want to develop the relative positions of the 
phasors before and after the capacitor is added.
Relating the phasor diagram to the cir-
cuit shown in Fig. 9.56, we make the following 
observations:
• We choose VL  as our reference because we are 
holding its amplitude constant. For convenience, 
we place this phasor on the positive real axis.
• We know that I a  is in phase with VL  and that its 
magnitude is

The completed phasor diagram shown in Step 6 of  
Fig. 9.57 shows the amplitude and phase angle relation-

Now add the capacitor branch shown in Fig. 9.58. 
We are holding VL constant, so we construct the 
 phasor diagram for the circuit in Fig. 9.58 following 
the same steps as those in Fig. 9.57, except that, in 
Step 4, we add the capacitor current I c to the diagram,

A Household Distribution Circuit
After determining the loads on the three-wire distribution circuit prior to 
the interruption of Fuse A, you are able to construct the  frequency- domain 
circuit model shown in Fig. 9.61. The impedances of the wires connect-
ing the source to the loads are assumed negligible.
Let’s begin by calculating all of the branch current phasors in the 
figure, prior to the interruption of Fuse A. We calculate I4, I5, and I6 using 
Ohm’s law:

Thus, comparing the dashed phasors of I, R I,

j L I,

ω
 and Vs with their solid counterparts clearly 
shows the effect of adding C to the circuit. In partic-
ular, adding the capacitor reduces the source volt-
age amplitude while maintaining the load voltage 
amplitude. Practically, this result means that, as the 
load increases (i.e., as I a  and I b increase), we can 
add capacitors to the system (i.e., increase I c), so 
that under heavy load conditions we can maintain 
VL  without increasing the amplitude of the source 
voltage.

material by trying Chapter Problems 9.84 and 9.85.

Now calculate those same branch current phasors after Fuse A is 
interrupted. We assume that the fan motor behaves like a short circuit 
when it stalls, and the interrupted fuse behaves like an open circuit. The 
circuit model now looks like Fig. 9.62. To analyze this circuit, we write 
two mesh current equations using the mesh current phasors shown in 
Fig. 9.62:

We can see that even though Fuse A is interrupted and the I1 branch 
current is zero, all of the other branch currents are nonzero. The appli-
ances and electronics in the house continued to operate because they 
are represented by the 12 Ω load that still has an ample supply of current.

where Vm (or I m) is the maximum amplitude, ω  is the 
frequency, and φ is the phase angle. (See page 320.)
• The frequency, ω , of a sinusoidal response is the same 
as the frequency of the sinusoidal source driving the 
circuit. The amplitude and phase angle of the response 
are usually different from those of the source. (See 
page 323.)
• The best way to find the steady-state voltages and 
currents in a circuit driven by sinusoidal sources is to 
 perform the analysis in the frequency domain. The 
following mathematical transforms allow us to move 
 between the time and frequency domains.

frequency domain):

• In a circuit with a sinusoidal source, the voltage leads 
the current by 90° at the terminals of an inductor, and 
the current leads the voltage by 90° at the terminals of a 
capacitor. (See pages 327–331.)
• Impedance (Z) relates the phasor current and phasor 
voltage for resistors, inductors, and capacitors in an 
equation that has the same form as Ohm’s law,
Z
V
I,
=
where the reference direction for I obeys the pas-
sive sign convention. The reciprocal of impedance is 
admittance (Y), so another way to express the current- 
voltage relationship for resistors, inductors, and capac-
itors in the frequency domain is
Y
V
I
.
=
(See pages 330 and 336.)
• The equations for impedance and admittance for 
resistors, inductors, and capacitors are summarized in 
Table 9.3.
• All of the circuit analysis techniques developed in 
Chapters 2–4 for resistive circuits also apply to sinusoi-
dal steady-state circuits in the frequency domain. These 
techniques include KVL, KCL, series, and parallel com-
binations of impedances, voltage and current division, 
node-voltage and mesh- current methods, Thévenin and 
Norton equivalents, and source transformation.
• The two-winding linear transformer is a coupling device 
made up of two coils wound on the same nonmagnetic 
core. Reflected impedance is the impedance of the sec-
ondary circuit as seen from the terminals of the primary 
circuit, or vice versa. The reflected impedance of a linear 
transformer seen from the primary side is the complex 
conjugate of the self-impedance of the secondary circuit 
scaled by the factor ω

b) Because the transient component vanishes as 
time elapses and because our solution must 
satisfy the differential equation for all values

also satisfy the differential equation. Verify this 
observation by showing that the steady-state

CHAPTER 
Sinusoidal Steady-State 
Power Calculations
Nearly all electric energy is supplied by sinusoidal voltages 
and currents. Thus, after our Chapter 9 discussion of sinusoidal 
circuits, we now consider sinusoidal steady-state power calcula-
tions. We are primarily interested in the average power delivered 
to or supplied by a pair of terminals in the sinusoidal steady state. 
We also present other power quantities, including reactive power, 
complex power, and apparent power.
We begin and end this chapter with two concepts that should be 
very familiar to you from previous chapters: the basic equation for 
power (Section 10.1) and maximum power transfer (Section 10.6). 
In between, we discuss the general techniques for calculating 
power, which will be familiar from your studies in Chapters 1 and 4, 
although some additional mathematical techniques are required 
here to deal with sinusoidal, rather than dc, signals. We also revisit 
the rms value of a sinusoid, briefly introduced in Chapter 9, because 
it is used extensively in power calculations.
A wide variety of problems deal with the delivery of energy 
to do work, ranging from determining the power rating for safely 
and efficiently operating an appliance to designing the vast array 
of generators, transformers, and wires that provide electric 
energy to household and industrial consumers. Thus, power engi-
neering is an important and exciting subdiscipline in electrical 
engineering.

CHAPTER OBJECTIVES

Practical Perspective 
Vampire Power
Even when we are not using many of the common 
 electrical devices found in our homes, schools, and busi-
nesses, they can still be consuming power. This “standby 
power” can run an internal clock, charge  batteries, 
 display time or other quantities, monitor temperature or 
other  environmental measures, or search for signals to 
receive. Devices such as microwave ovens, cable boxes, 
 televisions,  remote controls, and computers all consume 
power when not in use.
The ac adapters used to charge many portable 
 devices are a common source of standby power. Even 
when the device is unplugged from the adapter, the 
adapter can continue to consume power if it is plugged 
into the wall outlet. Because the plug on the adapter 
looks somewhat like vampire fangs, standby power has 
become known as “vampire power.” It is power that is 
used even while we sleep.
How much vampire power do electrical devices in 
our home use over the course of a year? Is there a way to 
reduce or eliminate vampire power? These questions are 
explored in the Practical Perspective example at the end 
of the chapter and in the chapter problems.

Using the passive sign convention, we find that the power at any instant 
of time is
v
p
i.
=
This is instantaneous power. Instantaneous power is measured in watts 
when the voltage is in volts and the current is in amperes.
Because the circuit operates in the sinusoidal steady state, we can 
choose any convenient reference for zero time. It is convenient to define 
zero time at the instant the current passes through a positive maximum. 
This reference system requires a shift of both the voltage and current by 
.

10.2 Average and Reactive Power 
377
Examine the three terms on the right-hand side of Eq. 10.3. The first 
term is a constant; it is not a function of time. The other two terms are 
sinusoids, each with a frequency that is double the frequency of the volt-
age and current in Eqs. 10.1 and 10.2. You can make these same observa-
tions in the plot of Fig. 10.2, which depicts v , i, and p, assuming v
60°
θ
=
 
and 
0°.
iθ
=
 You can see that the frequency of the instantaneous power 
is twice the frequency of the voltage or current. Therefore, the instanta-
neous power goes through two complete cycles for every cycle of either 
the voltage or the current.
Also note that the instantaneous power may be negative for a portion 
of each cycle. When the power is negative, the energy stored in the induc-
tors or capacitors is being extracted. The instantaneous power varies with 
time when a circuit operates in the sinusoidal steady state. As a result, 
some motor-driven appliances (such as refrigerators) experience vibra-
tion and require resilient motor mountings to prevent excessive vibration.
In the next section, we use Eq. 10.3 to find the average power at the 
terminals of the circuit in Fig. 10.1 and also introduce the concept of reac-
tive power.

Figure 10.3 ▲ Instantaneous power and  average 
power for a purely resistive circuit.
P is the average power, and Q is the reactive power. Average power is 
sometimes called real power because it describes the power in a circuit 
that is transformed from electric to nonelectric energy. Although the two 
terms are interchangeable, we primarily use the term average power in 
this text.
It is easy to see why P is called the average power: it is the average of 
the instantaneous power over one period. In equation form,
 
P

(10.7)
where T is the period of the sinusoidal function. The limits on the integral 
imply that we can initiate the integration process at any convenient time t 0  
but that we must terminate the integration exactly one period later.  
(We could integrate over nT periods, where n is an integer, provided we 
multiply the integral by 
nT
1
.)
We could find the average power by substituting Eq. 10.3 directly 
into Eq. 10.7 and integrating. But the average value of p is given by the 
first term on the right-hand side of Eq. 10.3 because the integral of both 
t
cos 2ω  and 
t
sin 2ω  over one period is zero. Thus, the average power is 
given in Eq. 10.5.
We can develop a better understanding of all the terms in Eq. 10.4 
and the relationships among them by examining the power in circuits that 
are purely resistive, purely inductive, or purely capacitive.
Power for Purely Resistive Circuits
If the circuit between the terminals in Fig. 10.1 is purely resistive, the volt-
age and current are in phase, which means that 
vθ

The instantaneous power for a resistor is called the instantaneous real 
power. Figure 10.3 shows a graph of p for a purely resistive circuit with 
377  rad s.
ω =
 By definition, the average power, P, is the average of p 
over one period. Looking at the graph, we see that P
1
=
 for this circuit. 
Note that the instantaneous real power can never be negative, which is 
seen in its equation and is also shown in Fig. 10.3. In other words, power 
cannot be extracted from a purely resistive network. Resistors dissipate 
electric energy in the form of thermal energy.
Power for Purely Inductive Circuits
If the circuit between the terminals in Fig. 10.1 is purely inductive, the 
current lags the voltage by 90° (that is,

Figure 10.5 ▲ Instantaneous power, average 
power, and reactive power for a purely capacitive 
circuit.
In a purely inductive circuit, the average power is zero, and energy is not 
transformed from electric to nonelectric form. Instead, the instantaneous 
power in a purely inductive circuit is continually exchanged between the 
circuit and the source driving the circuit, at a frequency of 2 .
ω  When p is 
positive, energy is stored in the magnetic fields associated with the induc-
tive elements, and when p is negative, energy is extracted from the mag-
netic fields.
We measure the power of purely inductive circuits using the reactive 
power Q. The name reactive power recognizes an inductor as a reactive 
element; its impedance is purely reactive. Note that average power P 
and reactive power Q carry the same dimension. To distinguish between 
average and reactive power, we use the units watt (W) for average power 
and var (volt-amp reactive, or VAR) for reactive power. Figure 10.4 
plots the instantaneous power for a purely inductive circuit, assuming

 Power for Purely Capacitive Circuits

rent leads the voltage by 90° (that is,

Again, the average power is zero, and energy is not transformed from 
electric to nonelectric form. Instead, the power is continually exchanged 
between the source driving the circuit and the electric field associated with 
the capacitive elements. Figure 10.5 plots the instantaneous power for a 
purely capacitive circuit, assuming 
377  rad s

Note that the decision to use the current as the reference (see Eq. 10.2) 
means that Q is positive for inductors (because v

) and nega-
tive for capacitors (because v

this difference in the algebraic sign of Q by saying that inductors demand 
(or absorb) magnetizing vars and capacitors furnish (or deliver) magnetiz-
ing vars. We say more about this convention later.
The Power Factor
The angle

 is used when computing both average and reactive 
power and is referred to as the power factor angle. The cosine of this angle 
is called the power factor, abbreviated pf, and the sine of this angle is 
called the reactive factor, abbreviated rf. Thus

 To completely

hence, an inductive load. Leading power factor means that current leads 
voltage—hence, a capacitive load. Both the power factor and the reactive 
factor are convenient quantities to use in describing electrical loads.

 Appliance Ratings
Average power is used to quantify the power needs of household appli-
ances. Your monthly electric bill is based on the number of kilowatt-hours 
used by the household. Table 10.1 presents data for some common appli-
ances, including the average hours per month and the number of months 
the appliance is used, the annual kilowatt-hour (kwh) consumption, and 
the annual cost of operation. For example, a coffee maker has a monthly 
use of 30 hours, or one hour per day, is used every month of the year, and 
consumes 60 kwh per year, at a cost of about $10. Therefore, the coffee 
maker consumes 60 kwh 360 hours

EXAMPLE 10.2    Making Power Calculations Involving Household Appliances
The branch circuit supplying the outlets in a typ-
ical home kitchen is wired with #12 conductor and 
is  protected by either a 20 A fuse or a 20 A circuit 
breaker. Assume that the following 120 V appliances 
are in operation at the same time: a coffee maker, 
microwave, dishwasher, and older refrigerator. Will 
the circuit be interrupted by the protective device?
Solution
We have already estimated that the average 
power used by the coffee maker is 167 W. Using 
Table 10.1, we find that the average power used by 
the other three appliances is

10.3  The RMS Value and Power 
Calculations
When we introduced the rms value of a sinusoidal voltage (or current) in 
Section 9.1, we mentioned that it would play an important role in power 
calculations. We now discuss this role.
Assume a sinusoidal voltage is applied to the terminals of a resistor, 
as shown in Fig. 10.7, and that we want to determine the average power 
delivered to the resistor. From Eq. 10.7,

The rms value is also referred to as the effective value of the sinusoi-
dal voltage (or current). The rms value has an interesting property: Given 
an equivalent resistive load, R, and an equivalent time period, T, the rms 
value of a sinusoidal source delivers the same energy to R as does a dc 
source of the same value. For example, a dc source of 100 V delivers the 
same energy in T seconds that a sinusoidal source of 100 V(rms) deliv-
ers, assuming equivalent load resistances (see Problem 10.11). Figure 10.8 
demonstrates this equivalence. The effect of the two sources is identical 
with respect to energy delivery. So we use the terms effective value and 
rms value interchangeably.
The average power given by Eq. 10.5 and the reactive power given by 
Eq. 10.6 can be written in terms of effective values:

Using the effective values of sinusoidal signals in power calculations 
is so widespread that we specify the voltage and current ratings of circuits 
and equipment using rms values. For example, the voltage rating of res-
idential electric wiring is often 240 V 120 V service. These voltages are 
the rms values of the sinusoidal voltages supplied by the utility company,  
which provides power at two voltage levels, accommodating low-voltage  
appliances (such as televisions) and higher-voltage appliances (such as 
electric ranges). Appliances such as electric lamps, irons, and toasters 
all carry rms ratings on their nameplates. For example, a 120 V, 100 W 
lamp has a resistance of 120
100,
2
 or 144  ,
Ω  and draws an rms current of 
120 144, or 0.833 A. The peak value of the lamp current is 0.833 2, or 
1.18 A.
The phasor transform of a sinusoidal function may also be expressed 
as an rms value. The magnitude of the rms phasor is equal to the rms value 
of the sinusoidal function. We indicate that a phasor is based on an rms 
value using either an explicit statement, a parenthetical “rms” adjacent to 
the phasor’s units, or the subscript “rms.”
In Example 10.3, we use rms values to calculate power.

10.4 Complex Power
Before discussing the methods for calculating real and reactive power in 
circuits operating in the sinusoidal steady state, we introduce and define 
complex power. Complex power is the complex sum of real power and 
reactive power, or
COMPLEX POWER

(10.11)
As you will see, we can compute the complex power using the voltage and 
current phasors for a circuit. Equation 10.11 can then be used to determine 
the average and reactive power, because

Complex power has the same units as average or reactive power. 
However, to distinguish complex power from both average and reactive

power, we use the units volt-amps (VA). Thus, we use volt-amps for 
 complex power, watts for average power, and vars for reactive power, as 
summarized in Table 10.2.
Complex power provides a geometric relationship among several dif-
ferent power quantities. In Eq. 10.11, envision P, Q, and S  as the sides 
of a right triangle, as shown in Fig. 10.9. We can show that the angle θ in 
the power triangle is the power factor angle v

 The geometric relationships for a right triangle

(10.12)
Apparent power, like complex power, is measured in volt-amps. The appar-
ent power, or volt-amp, requirement of a device designed to convert electric 
energy to a nonelectric form is more useful than the average power require-
ment. The apparent power represents the volt-amp capacity required to sup-
ply the average power used by the device. As you can see from the power 
triangle in Fig. 10.9, unless the power factor angle is 0° (that is, the device 
is purely resistive, pf
1,
=
 and Q
0
=
), the volt-amp capacity required by 
the device is larger than the average power used by the device.
Many appliances (including refrigerators, fans, air conditioners, fluo-
rescent lighting fixtures, and washing machines) and most industrial loads 
operate at a lagging power factor. The power factor of these loads can be 
corrected either by adding a capacitor to the device itself or by connecting 
capacitors across the line feeding the load; the latter method is often used 
for large industrial loads. Many of the problems at the end of the chapter 
explore methods for correcting a lagging power factor load and improving 
the operation of a circuit.
Example 10.4 uses a power triangle to calculate several quantities 
associated with power in an electrical load.
EXAMPLE 10.4    Calculating Complex Power
An electrical load operates at 240 V(rms). The 
load absorbs an average power of 8 kW at a lagging 
power factor of 0.8.
a) Calculate the complex power of the load.
b) Calculate the impedance of the load, Z.

Alternate Forms for Complex Power
Equations 10.13 and 10.14 have several useful variations. We use the rms 
form of the equations throughout because voltages and currents are most 
often given as rms values in power computations.
The first variation of Eq. 10.13 replaces the voltage with the prod-
uct of the current times the impedance. We can always represent the cir-
cuit inside the box of Fig. 10.11 by an equivalent impedance, as shown in 
Fig. 10.13. Then,

EXAMPLE 10.7  Calculating Power in Parallel Loads
The two loads in the circuit shown in Fig. 10.15 can 
be described as follows: Load 1 absorbs 8 kW at a 
leading power factor of 0.8. Load 2 absorbs 20 kVA 
at a lagging power factor of 0.6.
a) Determine the power factor of the two loads in 
parallel.
b) Determine the apparent power required to supply 
the loads, the magnitude of the current, I s, and the 
average power loss in the transmission line.
c) Given that the frequency of the source is 60 Hz, 
compute the value of the capacitor that would 
correct the power factor to 1 if placed in parallel 
with the two loads. Recalculate the values in (b) 
for the load with the corrected power factor.

Adding the capacitor as the third load is rep-

the power factor is 1, the apparent power and

10.6 Maximum Power Transfer
Recall from Chapter 4 that certain systems—for example, those that trans-
mit information via electric signals—need to transfer a maximum amount 
of power from the source to the load. We now  determine the condition for 
maximum power transfer in sinusoidal steady-state networks, beginning 
with Fig. 10.19. We must determine the load impedance ZL  that maxi-
mizes the average power delivered to terminals a and b. Any linear net-
work can be replaced by a Thévenin equivalent circuit, so we will use the 
circuit in Fig. 10.20 to find the value of ZL  that results in maximum aver-
age power delivered to ZL .
For maximum average power transfer, ZL  must equal the conjugate 
of the Thévenin impedance; that is,

the Thévenin voltage amplitude is an rms value. We also use the Thévenin 
voltage as the reference phasor, that is, the phasor whose phase angle is 0°.

For purely resistive networks, maximum power transfer occurs when 
the load resistance equals the Thévenin resistance. Note that we first derived 
this result in the introduction to maximum power transfer in Chapter 4.
Examples 10.9–10.11 calculate the load impedance ZL that produces 
maximum average power transfer to the load, for several different situa-
tions. Example 10.12 finds the condition for maximum power transfer to a 
load for a circuit with an ideal transformer.
EXAMPLE 10.9     Determining Maximum Power Transfer without Load 
Restrictions
a) For the circuit shown in Fig. 10.21, determine the 
impedance ZL  that results in maximum average 
power transferred to Z .
L
b) What is the maximum average power transferred 
to the load impedance determined in (a)?
Solution
a) To begin, determine the Thévenin equivalent 
with respect to the load terminals a, b. After 
two source transformations involving the 20 V 
source, the 5 Ω  resistor, and the 20 Ω  resistor, 
we simplify the circuit shown in Fig. 10.21 to the 
one shown in Fig. 10.22. Use voltage division in

EXAMPLE 10.10        Determining Maximum Power Transfer with Load Impedance 
Restriction
a) For the circuit shown in Fig. 10.24, what value of 
ZL  results in maximum average power transfer to 
ZL ? What is the maximum power in milliwatts?
b) Assume that the load resistance can be varied 
between 0 and 4000 Ω and that the capacitive 
reactance of the load can be varied between 0 
and 
2000  .
−
Ω  What values of RL and X L trans-
fer the most average power to the load? What is 
the maximum average power that can be trans-
ferred under these restrictions?
Solution
a) If there are no restrictions on RL and X ,
L  max-
imum average power is delivered to the load if 
the load impedance equals the conjugate of the 
Thévenin impedance. Therefore we set

Practical Perspective 
Vampire Power
Vampire power, or standby power, may cost you more than you think. The 
average household has about 40 electrical products that draw power, 
even when they are turned off. Approximately 5% of typical residential 
power consumption can be attributed to standby power. Table 10.3 pro-
vides the power consumption for several different devices. Notice that 
when a device is “off” it is often still consuming power.
Consider a typical mobile phone charger. According to the values 
given in Table 10.3, when the charger is detached from the phone it 
consumes only a fraction of the power required when the charger is

Sinusoidal Steady-State Power Calculations
attached to the phone and the phone is charging. Suppose you charge 
your phone for three hours each day but leave the charger plugged into 
the wall outlet 24 hours a day. Recall that the electric company charges 
you based on the number of kilowatt-hours (kWh) you use in a given 
month. A device that uses 1000 W of power continuously over one hour 
has consumed 1 kWh. Let’s calculate the number of kilowatt-hours 
used by the phone charger in one month:

Keeping the charger plugged in when you are not using it consumes 
more than 5 times the power needed to charge your phone every day. 
You can therefore minimize the cost of vampire power by unplugging 
electrical devices if they are not being used.
Why does the phone charger consume power when not plugged into 
the phone? The electronic circuitry in your phone uses 5 V(dc) sources 
to supply power. The phone charger must transform the 120 V(rms) sig-
nal supplied by the wall outlet into a signal that can be used to charge 
the phone. Phone chargers can use linear transformers, together with 
other circuitry, to output the voltage needed by the phone.
Consider the circuit in Fig. 10.29. The linear transformer is part 
of the circuitry used to reduce the voltage supplied by the source to 
the level required by the phone. The additional components needed 
to complete this task are not shown in the circuit. When the phone is 
unplugged from the circuit in Fig. 10.29, but the circuit is still connected 
to the 120 V(rms) source, there is still a path for the current, as shown in 
Fig. 10.30. The current is

Summary
• Instantaneous power is the product of the instantaneous 
terminal voltage and current, or 
v
p
i.
= ±
 The positive 
sign is used when the reference direction for the current 
is from the positive to the negative reference polarity of 
the voltage. The frequency of the instantaneous power 
is twice the frequency of the voltage (or current). (See 
page 376.)
• Average power is the average value of the instantaneous 
power over one period. It is the power converted from 
electric to nonelectric form and vice versa, so it is also 
called real power. Average power is given by

• Reactive power is the electric power exchanged between 
the magnetic field of an inductor and the source that 
drives it or between the electric field of a capacitor and 
the source that drives it. Reactive power is never con-
verted to nonelectric power. Reactive power is given by

as the unit for reactive power. The volt-amp (VA) is 
used as the unit for complex and apparent power. (See 
page 385.)
• Maximum power transfer occurs in circuits operating 
in the sinusoidal steady state when the load imped-
ance is the conjugate of the Thévenin impedance as 
viewed from the terminals of the load impedance. (See

Balanced  
Three-Phase Circuits
We use three-phase circuits to generate, transmit, 
dis tribute, and consume large blocks of electric power. The 
comprehensive analysis of such systems is a field of study in its 
own right; we cannot cover it in a single chapter. Fortunately, an 
understanding of the steady-state sinusoidal behavior of balanced 
three-phase circuits is sufficient for engineers who do not spe-
cialize in power systems. We analyze balanced three-phase cir-
cuits using several shortcuts based on circuit-analysis techniques  
discussed in earlier chapters.
The basic structure of a three-phase system consists of volt-
age sources connected to loads by means of transformers and 
transmission lines. To analyze such a circuit, we can reduce it 
to a voltage source connected to a load via a line. The omission 
of the transformer simplifies the discussion without jeopardiz-
ing a basic understanding of the three-phase system. Figure 11.1 
on page 414 shows a basic circuit. A defining characteristic of a 
balanced three-phase circuit is that it contains a set of balanced 
three-phase voltages at its source. We begin by considering these 
voltages, and then we move to the voltage and current relation-
ships for the Y-Y and Y-∆ circuits. After considering voltage and 
current in such circuits, we conclude with sections on power and 
power measurement.

CHAPTER OBJECTIVES

 Practical Perspective
Transmission and Distribution of Electric Power
In this chapter, we introduce circuits that are designed 
to handle large blocks of electric power. These are the 
circuits used to transport electric power from generat-
ing plants to both industrial and residential customers. 
We  introduced a very basic residential customer circuit in 
the design perspective for Chapter 1. Now we introduce 
the type of circuit that delivers electric power to an entire 
residential subdivision.
One of the requirements imposed on electric  utilities 
is to maintain the rms voltage level at the customer’s 
premises. Whether lightly loaded, as at 3:00 am, or heav-
ily loaded, as at midafternoon on a hot, humid day, the 
utility must supply the same rms voltage. To satisfy this 
requirement, utility systems place capacitors at strategic 
locations in the distribution network. The  capacitors sup-
ply magnetizing vars close to the loads requiring them, 
adjusting the power factor of the load. We illustrate this 
concept after we have analyzed balanced three-phase 
circuits.

11.1 Balanced Three-Phase Voltages
A set of balanced three-phase voltages consists of three sinusoidal volt-
ages that have identical amplitudes and frequencies but are out of phase 
with each other by exactly 120°. We refer to the three phases as a, b, and c, 
and use the a-phase as the reference phase. The three voltages are referred 
to as the a-phase voltage, the b-phase voltage, and the c-phase voltage.
Only two possible phase relationships can exist between the a-phase vol-
tage and the b- and c-phase voltages. One possibility is for the b-phase voltage  
to lag the a-phase voltage by 120°, in which case the c-phase voltage must 
lead the a-phase voltage by 120°. This phase relationship is known as the 
abc (or positive) phase sequence. Using phasor notation, we see that the 
abc phase sequence is

The only other possibility is for the b-phase voltage to lead the a-phase 
voltage by 120°, in which case the c-phase voltage must lag the a-phase 
voltage by 120°. This phase relationship is known as the acb (or negative) 
phase sequence. In phasor notation, the acb phase sequence is

Figure 11.2 shows the phasor diagrams of the voltages in Eqs. 11.1 and 
11.2. The phase sequence is the clockwise order of the subscripts around 
the diagram, starting from V .
a  You can use the phasor diagrams to show 
that the sum of the three phasor voltages in a balanced set is zero. This 
important characteristic can also be derived from Eq. 11.1 or 11.2 to give

Now that we know the nature of a balanced set of three-phase volt-
ages, we can state the first of the analytical shortcuts alluded to in the 
introduction to this chapter: if we know the phase sequence and one volt-
age in the set, we know the entire set. Thus, for a balanced three-phase 
system, once we determine the voltages (or currents) in one phase, we can 
use the 120° phase angle difference and the phase sequence to find the 
voltages or currents in the remaining two phases.

ing Chapter Problems 11.1 and 11.2.

11.2 Three-Phase Voltage Sources

11.2 Three-Phase Voltage Sources
A three-phase voltage source is a generator with three separate windings 
distributed around the periphery of the stator. Each winding comprises 
one phase of the generator. The rotor of the generator is an electromag-
net driven at synchronous speed by a prime mover, such as a steam or 
gas turbine. Rotation of the electromagnet induces a sinusoidal voltage 
in each winding. The phase windings are designed so that the sinusoi-
dal voltages induced in them are equal in amplitude and out of phase 
with each other by 120°. The phase windings are stationary with respect 
to the rotating electromagnet, so the frequency of the voltage induced 
in each winding is the same. Figure 11.3 shows a sketch of a two-pole 
three-phase source.
There are two ways of interconnecting the separate phase wind-
ings to form a three-phase source: as a wye (Y) or as a delta ∆)
(
. 
Figure 11.4 shows both, with ideal voltage sources modeling the phase 
windings of the three-phase generator. The common terminal in the 
Y-connected source, labeled n in Fig. 11.4(a), is called the neutral ter-
minal of the source, which may or may not be available for external 
connections.
When constructing a circuit model of a three-phase generator, we 
need to consider the impedance of each phase winding. Sometimes it is 
so small (compared with other impedances in the circuit) that we don’t 
include it in the generator model; the model then consists solely of ideal 
voltage sources, as in Fig. 11.4. If the impedance of each phase winding is 
not negligible, we connect an inductive winding impedance in series with 
an ideal sinusoidal voltage source in each phase. Because the winding con-
struction in each phase is the same, we make the winding impedances in 
each phase identical. Figure 11.5 shows two models of a three-phase gen-
erator, one using a Y connection and the other using a ∆ connection. In 
both models, Rw is the winding resistance, and  Xw is the inductive reac-
tance of the winding.
Because both three-phase sources and three-phase loads can be either 
Y-connected or ∆-connected, the basic circuit in Fig. 11.1 represents four 
different configurations:
Source
Load
Y

∆

We begin by analyzing the Y-Y circuit. The remaining three config-
urations can be reduced to a Y-Y equivalent circuit, so analysis of 
the Y-Y circuit is the key to solving all balanced three-phase arrange-
ments. We  then illustrate how to transform a Y-∆ circuit to a Y-Y 
circuit and leave the analysis of the ∆-Y and ∆-∆ circuits to you in the  
Problems.

Figure 11.6 ▲ A three-phase Y-Y system.
What happens to the KCL equation if the three-phase circuit in 
Fig. 11.6 is balanced? To answer this question, we must formally define 
a balanced three-phase circuit. A three-phase circuit is balanced if it 
 satisfies the following criteria:

conductor that connects the source neutral to the load neutral. A fourth 
conductor is possible only in the Y-Y arrangement. For convenience, 
we transformed the Y connections into “tipped-over tees.” In Fig. 11.6,

The right-hand side of Eq. 11.3 is zero because by hypothesis the numer-
ator is a set of balanced three-phase voltages and 
φ
Z  is not zero. The 
only value of VN that satisfies Eq. 11.3 is zero. Therefore, for a balanced 
 three-phase circuit,

(11.4)
When a three-phase circuit is balanced, VN is zero, so the volt-
age between the source neutral, n, and the load neutral, N, is zero. 
Consequently, the current in the neutral conductor is zero, so we can 
either remove the neutral conductor from a balanced Y-Y configura-

From these equations, we see that the three line currents form a bal-
anced set; that is, the current in each line is equal in amplitude and 
frequency and is 120° out of phase with the other two line currents. 
Thus, if we calculate the current I aA and we know the phase sequence, 
we have a shortcut for finding I bB and I
.
cC  This is the same shortcut 
used to find the b- and c-phase source voltages from the a-phase source 
voltage.

Terminology
We use Fig. 11.6 to define some important terms.
• Line voltage is the voltage across any pair of lines. In Fig. 11.6, the 
three line voltages at the load are VAB, VBC, and VCA.
• Phase voltage is the voltage across a single phase. In Fig. 11.6, the 
three phase voltages at the load are VAN, VBN, and VCN.
• Line current is the current in a single line. In Fig. 11.6, the three line 
currents are IaA, IbB, and IcC.
• Phase current is the current in a single phase. In Fig. 11.6, the three 
phase currents for the load are IAN, IBN, and ICN.
From Fig. 11.6 you can see that when the load is Y-connected, the line 
current and phase current in each phase are identical, but the line voltage 
and phase voltage in each phase are different.
The Greek letter phi φ
( ) is widely used in the literature to denote 
a per-phase quantity. Thus, 
φ
φ
φ
φ
Z
P
V
I
, 
, 
, 
, and 
φ
Q  are interpreted 
as  voltage-per-phase, current-per-phase, impedance-per-phase, real  
p ower-per-phase, and reactive power-per-phase, respectively.
Since three-phase systems are designed to handle large blocks of elec-
tric power, all voltage and current specifications are rms values. When 
voltage ratings are given, they refer specifically to the rating of the line 
voltage. Thus, when a three-phase transmission line is rated at 345 kV, 
the value of the line-to-line voltage is 345,000 V(rms). In this chapter, we 
express all voltages and currents as rms values.
Constructing a Single-Phase Equivalent Circuit
We can use Eq. 11.5 to construct an equivalent circuit for the a-phase 
of the balanced Y-Y circuit. From this equation, the line current in the 
a-phase is the voltage generated in the a-phase winding of the generator 
divided by the total impedance in the a-phase of the circuit. Thus, Eq. 11.5 
describes the circuit shown in Fig. 11.7, in which the neutral  conductor has 
been replaced by a short circuit. The circuit in Fig. 11.7 is the  single-phase 
equivalent circuit for a balanced three-phase circuit. Once we solve 
this circuit, we can write down the voltages and currents in the other 
two phases, using the relationships among the phases. Thus, drawing a 
 single-phase equivalent circuit is an important first step in analyzing a  
balanced  three-phase circuit.
Note that the current in the neutral conductor in Fig. 11.7 is IaA. This 
is not the same as the current in the neutral conductor of the balanced 
three-phase circuit, which is

Thus, the circuit shown in Fig. 11.7 gives the correct value of the line cur-
rent but only the a-phase component of the neutral current. In a balanced 
three-phase circuit, the line currents form a balanced three-phase set, and

.
Once we know the line current (IaA) in Fig.  11.7, we know the 
phase current (IAN) because they are equal. We can also use Ohm’s 
law to calculate the phase voltage (VAN) from the phase current and

The line voltage is not even shown in the single-phase equivalent circuit 
in Fig. 11.7. In a Y-connected load, the line voltages and the phase volt-
ages are related. Using Fig. 11.8, we can describe those relationships

Equations 11.6–11.8 reveal that
1. The magnitude of the line voltage is 3  times the magnitude of the 
phase voltage.
2. The line voltages form a balanced three-phase set.
3. The set of line voltages leads the set of phase voltages by 30°.
We leave it to you to demonstrate that for a negative sequence, the 
only change is that the set of line voltages lags the set of phase volt-
ages by 30°. The phasor diagrams shown in Fig. 11.9 summarize these 
observations. Here, again, is a shortcut in the analysis of a balanced 
system: If you know any phase voltage in the circuit, say VBN, you 
can determine the  corresponding line voltage, which is VBC, and vice 
versa.

11.4 Analysis of the Wye-Delta Circuit
A balanced, three-phase, Y-∆ circuit is shown in Fig. 11.11. From this 
 circuit you can see that the line voltage and the phase voltage in each 
phase of the load are the same. For example, 
=

AB. But the line 
current and the phase current in each phase of the load are not the same. 
This is an important difference when comparing the Y-∆ circuit with the 
Y-Y circuit, where the line and phase currents are the same in each phase 
of the load but the line and phase voltages are different.
When the load in a three-phase circuit is connected in a delta, it can 
be transformed into a wye by using the delta-to-wye transformation dis-
cussed in Section 9.6. When the load is balanced, the impedance of each 
leg of the wye is one-third the impedance of each leg of the delta, or

which follows directly from Eqs. 9.21–9.23. After the ∆ load has 
been replaced by its Y equivalent, the a-phase can be modeled by the 
 single-phase equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 11.12.
We use this circuit to calculate the line currents, and we then 
use the line currents to find the currents in each phase of the original  
∆-connected load. The relationship between the line currents and the 
phase currents in each phase of the delta can be derived using the circuit 
shown in Fig. 11.11. We assume a positive phase sequence and let

Comparing the line currents and the phase currents reveals that the mag-

and that the set of line currents lags the set of phase currents by 30°.
We leave it to you to verify that, for a negative phase sequence, 
the line currents are still 
3  times larger than the phase currents, but 
they lead the phase currents by 30°. Thus, we have a shortcut for cal-
culating line currents from phase currents (or vice versa) for a balanced 
 three-phase ∆-connected load. Figure  11.13 summarizes this shortcut 
graphically. Example 11.2 analyzes a balanced three-phase circuit hav-

Figure 11.15 shows a Y-connected load, along with its pertinent currents 
and voltages. We calculate the average power associated with any one 
phase by using the techniques introduced in Chapter 10. Using Eq. 10.9, 
we express the average power associated with the a-phase as

ated with the b- and c-phases:

In Eqs. 11.13–11.15, all phasor currents and voltages use the rms value of 
the sinusoidal function they represent.
In a balanced three-phase system, the magnitude of each  line-to- neutral 
voltage is the same, as is the magnitude of each phase current. The argu-
ment of the cosine functions is also the same for all three phases. We intro-
duce the following notation to take advantage of these observations:

Expressing the total power in terms of the rms magnitudes of the line 
voltage and current is also desirable. If we let VL and I L represent the rms 
magnitudes of the line voltage and current, respectively, we can modify 
Eq. 11.16 as follows:

In deriving Eq. 11.17, we recognized that, for a balanced Y-connected 
load, the magnitude of the phase voltage is the magnitude of the line volt-
age divided by 
3, and that the magnitude of the line current is equal to 
the magnitude of the phase current. When using Eq. 11.17 to calculate the 
total power delivered to the load, remember that θφ is the phase angle 
between the phase voltage and current.
Reactive and Complex Power in a Balanced Wye Load
We can also calculate the reactive power and complex power associated 
with any phase of a Y-connected load using the techniques introduced in

Thus, whether you have a balanced Y- or ∆-connected load, the average 
power per phase is equal to the product of the rms magnitude of the phase 
voltage, the rms magnitude of the phase current, and the cosine of the 
angle between the phase voltage and current.

Instantaneous Power in Three-Phase Circuits
Although we are primarily interested in average, reactive, and complex 
power calculations, computing the total instantaneous power is also 
important. In a balanced three-phase circuit, this power has an interesting 
property: it is invariant with time! Thus, the torque developed at the shaft 
of a three-phase motor is constant, which in turn means less vibration in 
machinery powered by three-phase motors.

11.6  Measuring Average Power in 
Three-Phase Circuits
The instrument used to measure power in three-phase circuits is the elec-
trodynamometer wattmeter. It contains two coils. One coil, called the 
 current coil, is stationary and is designed to carry a current proportional 
to the load current. The second coil, called the potential coil, is movable 
and carries a current proportional to the load voltage. The important fea-
tures of the wattmeter are shown in Fig. 11.18.
The average deflection of the pointer attached to the movable coil 
is proportional to the product of the rms current in the current coil, 
the rms voltage impressed on the potential coil, and the cosine of the 
phase angle between the voltage and current. The pointer deflects in a 
direction that depends on the instantaneous polarity of the current-coil 
 current and the potential-coil voltage. Therefore, each coil has one ter-
minal with a polarity mark—usually a plus sign—but sometimes the dou-
ble polarity mark ± is used. The wattmeter deflects upscale when (1) the

polarity-marked terminal of the current coil is toward the source, and 
(2) the  polarity-marked terminal of the potential coil is connected to the 
same line in which the current coil has been inserted.
The Two-Wattmeter Method
Consider a general network inside a box, with power supplied by n con-
ducting lines. Such a system is shown in Fig. 11.19. If we wish to mea-
sure the total power at the terminals of the box, we need to know 
−
n

currents and voltages. This follows because if we choose one terminal as 
a reference, there are only 
−
n
1 independent voltages. Likewise, only 
−
n
1 independent currents can exist in the n conductors entering the 
box. Thus, the total power is the sum of 
−
n

Applying this general observation, we can see that for a three- con-
ductor circuit, whether balanced or not, we need only two wattmeters to 
measure the total power. For a four-conductor circuit, we need three watt-
meters if the three-phase circuit is unbalanced, but only two wattmeters if 
it is balanced, because in the latter case there is no current in the neutral 
line. Thus, only two wattmeters are needed to measure the total average 
power in any balanced three-phase system.
The two-wattmeter method determines the magnitude and algebraic 
sign of the average power indicated by each wattmeter. We can describe 
the basic problem using the circuit shown in Fig. 11.20, where the two 
wattmeters are indicated by the shaded boxes and labeled W1 and W .
2  
The coil notations cc and pc stand for current coil and potential coil, 
respectively. The current coils of the wattmeters are inserted in lines aA 
and cC, making line bB the reference line for the two potential coils. The 
load is Y-connected, and its per-phase impedance is 
θ
=
φ
Z
Z  
.  This is 
a general representation, as any ∆-connected load can be represented by 
its Y equivalent; furthermore, for the balanced case, the impedance angle 
θ is unaffected by the ∆-to-Y transformation.
We now develop general equations for the readings of the two 
 wattmeters, making the following assumptions.
• The current drawn by the potential coil of the wattmeter is negligible 
compared with the line current measured by the current coil.
• The loads can be modeled by passive circuit elements, so the phase 
angle of the load impedance (θ in Fig. 11.20) lies between −90° (pure 
capacitance) and +90° (pure inductance).
• The phase sequence is positive.
From our introductory discussion of the average deflection of the 
wattmeter and the placement of wattmeter 1 in Fig. 11.20, we note that the 
wattmeter reading, W ,

To calculate W1 and W ,
2  we express θ1 and θ2 in terms of the 
 impedance angle θ, which is also the same as the phase angle between the 
phase  voltage and current. For a positive phase sequence,

11.41). When we substitute Eqs. 11.22 and 11.23 into Eqs. 11.20 and 11.21,

which is the expression for the total average power in a three-phase cir-
cuit, given in Eq. 11.17. Therefore, we have confirmed that the sum of the 
two wattmeter readings is the total average power.
A closer look at the expressions for W1 and W2 reveals the following 
about the readings of the two wattmeters:
1. If the power factor is greater than 0.5, both wattmeters read positive.
2. If the power factor equals 0.5, one wattmeter reads zero.
3. If the power factor is less than 0.5, one wattmeter reads negative.
4.  Reversing the phase sequence will interchange the readings on the 
two wattmeters.
Example 11.6 and Problems 11.41–11.52 illustrate these observations.

Practical Perspective
Transmission and Distribution of Electric Power
At the start of this chapter we noted that utilities must maintain the rms 
voltage level at their customer’s premises. Although the acceptable de-
viation from a nominal level may vary among different utilities, we will as-
sume that the tolerance is 
%
5
±
. Thus, a nominal rms voltage of 120 V  
could range from 114 V to 126 V. We also pointed out that strategically 
located capacitors can be used to support voltage levels.
The circuit shown in Fig. 11.21 represents a substation in a munici-
pal system. We assume that the system is balanced, the line-to-line volt-
age at the substation is 13.8 kV, the impedance of the distribution line 
is 0 6

We are assuming the utility is required to keep the voltage level within

voltage at the power plant should not exceed 14.5 kV nor be less than 
13.1 kV. The magnitude of the line voltage at the generating plant exceeds 
14.5 kV, so could cause problems for customers.
To address this problem, connect a capacitor bank to the substa-
tion bus that supplies the magnetizing vars required by the load. Now 
the generator does not need to supply this reactive power, the load has a 
unity power factor, and the line current I aA becomes

• Three-phase systems can be unbalanced or balanced. A 
three-phase system is balanced when the following con-
ditions are satisfied:
1. The voltage sources form a balanced three-phase set.
2. The impedance of each phase of the voltage source 
is the same.
3. The impedance of each line is the same.
4. The impedance of each phase of the load is the same.
(See page 417.)
• A single-phase equivalent circuit is used to calculate the 
line current and the phase voltage in one phase of the Y-Y 
structure. The a-phase is normally chosen for this purpose. 
If the structure is not Y-Y, any ∆ connections should be 
transformed into equivalent Y connections before creating 
a single-phase equivalent circuit. (See page 418.)
• Once we know the line current and phase voltage in the 
a-phase equivalent circuit, we can use analytical short-
cuts to find any current or voltage in a balanced three-
phase circuit, based on the following facts:
• The b- and c-phase currents and voltages are iden-
tical to the a-phase current and voltage except for a 
120° shift in phase. The direction of the phase shift 
depends on the phase sequence.
• The set of line voltages is out of phase with the set of 
phase voltages by ±30°. The plus sign corresponds 
to the positive phase sequence, while the minus sign 
corresponds to the negative phase sequence.
• In a Y-Y circuit, the magnitude of a line voltage is 3  
times the magnitude of a phase voltage.
• The set of line currents is out of phase with the set 
of phase currents in ∆-connected sources and loads 
by 
30°.
∓
 The minus sign corresponds to the positive 
phase sequence, while the plus sign  corresponds to 
the negative phase sequence.
•  The magnitude of a line current is 
3  times the 
 magnitude of a phase current in a ∆-connected 
source or load.
(See pages 419 and 423.)
• The techniques for calculating per-phase average 
power, reactive power, and complex power are identical 
to those introduced in Chapter 10. (See page 425.)
• The total real, reactive, and complex power can be deter-
mined either by multiplying the corresponding per-
phase quantity by 3 or by using the expressions based 
on line current and line voltage, as given by Eqs. 11.17, 
11.18, and 11.19. (See page 426.)
• The total instantaneous power in a balanced three-
phase circuit is constant and equals 
V I
1.5
m
mpf. (See 
page 427.)
• A wattmeter measures the average power delivered to a 
load by using a current coil connected in series with the 
load and a potential coil connected in parallel with the 
load. (See page 430.)
• The total average power in a balanced three-phase cir-
cuit can be measured by summing the readings of two 
wattmeters connected in two different phases of the cir-
cuit. (See page 432.)

Introduction to the 
Laplace Transform
We now introduce the Laplace transform, which forms the 
basis of a powerful technique that is widely used to analyze linear, 
lumped-parameter circuits. We need the Laplace transform 
analysis technique because we can use it to solve the following 
types of problems.
• Finding the transient behavior of circuits whose describing 
equations consist of more than a single node-voltage or 
mesh-current differential equation. In other words, ana-
lyzing multiple-node and multiple-mesh circuits that are 
described by sets of linear differential equations.
• Determining the transient response of circuits whose signal

CHAPTER OBJECTIVES

Practical Perspective 
Transient Effects
As we learned in Chapter  9, power delivered from 
 electrical wall outlets in the United States can be mod-
eled as a sinusoidal voltage or current source, where the 
frequency of the sinusoid is 60 Hz. We used the phasor 
transform, introduced in Chapter  9, to find the steady-
state response of a circuit to a sinusoidal source.
But in many cases, we need to consider the complete 
response of a circuit to a sinusoidal source. Remember that 
the complete response has two parts—the steady-state 
response that takes the same form as the input to the cir-
cuit, and the transient response that decays to zero as time 
progresses. When a circuit’s source is a 60 Hz sinusoid, 
the steady-state response is also a 60 Hz sinusoid whose 
magnitude and phase angle can be calculated using pha-
sor circuit analysis. The transient response depends on the 
components that make up the circuit, the values of those 
components, and the way the components are intercon-
nected. Once the source is switched into the circuit, the  
voltage and current for every circuit component are the sum 
of a transient expression and a steady-state expression.
The transient part of the voltage and current even-
tually decays to zero. But, initially, the sum of the 
transient part and the steady-state part might exceed 
the voltage or current rating of the circuit component. 
This is why it is important to determine the complete 
response of a circuit. The Laplace transform tech-
niques introduced in this chapter can be used to find 
the complete response of a circuit to a sinusoidal 
source.
Consider the RLC circuit shown, comprised of com-
ponents from Appendix H and powered by a 60 Hz sinu-
soidal source. As detailed in Appendix H, the 10 mH  
inductor has a current rating of 40 mA. The amplitude of 
the sinusoidal source has been chosen so that this rating 
is not exceeded in the steady state. Once we have pre-
sented the Laplace transform method, we will be able to 
determine whether this current rating is exceeded when 
the source is first switched on and both the transient 
and steady-state components of the inductor current 
exist.

Introduction to the Laplace Transform
12.1  Definition of the Laplace 
Transform
The Laplace transform of a function is given by the expression

( )

(12.1)
where the symbol 
{
}
L
f t( )  is read “the Laplace transform of f t( ).”
The Laplace transform of f t( ) is also denoted F s
( ); that is,
 
{
}
= L
F s
f t
( )
( ) . 
(12.2)
This notation emphasizes that when the integral in Eq. 12.1 has been eval-
uated, the resulting expression is a function of s. In our applications, t rep-
resents the time domain and s represents the frequency domain. Note that 
the dimension of s must be reciprocal time, or frequency, because the expo-
nent of e in the integral of Eq. 12.1 must be dimensionless. The Laplace 
transform transforms the problem from the time domain to the frequency 
domain. Once we solve the problem in the frequency domain, we inverse- 
transform the solution back to the time domain.
Recall that the phasor is also a transform. As we know from Chapter 9, 
it converts a sinusoidal signal into a complex number for easier, algebraic 
computation of circuit values. After determining the phasor value of a sig-
nal, we transform it back to its time-domain expression. Both the Laplace 
transform and the phasor transform exhibit an essential feature of mathe-
matical transforms: They create a new domain to make the mathematical 
manipulations easier. After finding the unknown in the new domain, we 
inverse-transform it back to the original domain.
In circuit analysis, we use the Laplace transform to transform a set 
of integrodifferential equations in the time domain to a set of algebraic 
equations in the frequency domain. We can therefore find the solution for 
an unknown quantity by solving a set of algebraic equations.
Before we illustrate some of the important properties of the Laplace 
transform, some general comments are in order. First, note that the inte-
gral in Eq. 12.1 is improper because the upper limit is infinite. Thus, we 
are confronted immediately with the question of whether the integral 
converges. In other words, does a given f t( ) have a Laplace transform? 
Obviously, the functions of primary interest in engineering analysis have 
Laplace transforms; otherwise we would not be interested in the trans-
form. In linear circuit analysis, we excite circuits with sources that have 
Laplace transforms. Excitation functions such as t t or e ,
t 2  which do not 
have Laplace transforms, are of no interest here.
Second, because the lower limit on the integral is zero, the Laplace 
transform ignores f t( ) for negative values of t. That is, F s
( ) is determined 
by the behavior of f t( ) only for positive values of t. To emphasize that 
the lower limit is zero, Eq. 12.1 is frequently referred to as the one-sided, 
or unilateral, Laplace transform. In the two-sided, or bilateral, Laplace 
transform, the lower limit is −∞. We do not use the bilateral form here; 
hence, F s
( ) is understood to be the one-sided transform.
The Laplace transform’s lower limit creates a concern: what happens 
when f t( ) has a discontinuity at the origin? If f t( ) is continuous at the 

 
12.2 The Step Function 
447
origin, like the function in Fig. 12.1(a), f(0) is not ambiguous. However, if 
f t( ) has a finite discontinuity at the origin, like the function in Fig. 12.1(b), 
should the Laplace transform integral include or exclude the discontinuity?  
That is, should we make the lower limit 
−
0  and include the discontinuity, or  
choose 
+
0  as the lower limit and exclude the discontinuity? (We use the 
notation 
−
0  and 
+
0  to denote values of t just to the left and right of the 
origin, respectively.) Actually, we may choose either as long as we are 
consistent. For reasons we explain later, we choose 
−
0  as the lower limit.
Because we are using 
−
0  as the lower limit, we note that the inte-
gral from 
−
0  to 
+
0  is zero, except when the discontinuity at the origin 
is an impulse function. We discuss this situation in Section 12.3. The two 
functions shown in Fig. 12.1 have the same unilateral Laplace transform 
because there is no impulse function at the origin for the function in 
Fig. 12.1(b).
The one-sided Laplace transform ignores f t( ) for <
−
t
0 . We use ini-
tial conditions to account for what happens prior to 
−
0 . Thus, the Laplace 
transform predicts the response to a function that begins after initial con-
ditions have been established.
In the discussion that follows, we divide the Laplace transforms into 
two types: functional transforms and operational transforms. A functional 
transform is the Laplace transform of a specific function, such as 
ωt
sin
, t, 
−
e
,
at  and so on. An operational transform defines a general mathematical 
property of the Laplace transform, such as finding the transform of the 
derivative of f t( ). Before considering functional and operational trans-
forms, we introduce the step and impulse functions.
12.2 The Step Function
When a circuit contains a switch, a change in the switch position creates 
abrupt changes in currents and voltages, as we have seen in previous chap-
ters. An abrupt change is represented mathematically as a discontinuity, 
which can occur at any instant in time. We represent such discontinuities 
in the functions that describe the currents and voltages using step and 
impulse functions.
Figure 12.2 illustrates the step function. The symbol for the step func-
tion is Ku(t). The mathematical definition of the step function is

(12.3)
If K is 1, the function in Eq. 12.3 is the unit step, u(t).
The step function is not defined at 
=

0. If we need to define the 
transition between 
−
0  and 
+
0 , we assume that it is linear and that

As before,

left and right of the origin. Figure 12.3 illustrates the linear transition from

A discontinuity may occur at some time other than

ple, it may occur in sequential switching. A step that occurs at

Introduction to the Laplace Transform
If 
>
a
0, the step occurs to the right of the origin, and if 
<
a
0, the step 
occurs to the left of the origin. The step function’s value is 0 when the 
argument

a is negative, and it is K when the argument is positive. 
Figure 12.4 illustrates a step that occurs at

finite-width pulse. For example, the function

defining this pulse, think of the step function (

12.3 The Impulse Function 
449
12.3 The Impulse Function
An impulse is a signal of infinite amplitude and zero duration. Such signals 
don’t exist in nature, but some circuit signals come very close to approx-
imating this definition, so a mathematical model of an impulse is useful. 
For example, the impulse function1 enables us to define the derivative at 
a discontinuity, such as the one in the function of Fig. 12.1(b), and thus to 
define the Laplace transform of that derivative. Also, voltage and current 
impulses occur in circuit analysis either because of a switching operation 
or because the circuit is excited by an impulsive source. We will analyze 
these situations in Chapter 13, but here we define the impulse function 
generally.
Describing the Impulse Function
We describe the impulse function by considering how we would define 
the derivative of the function in Fig.  12.1(b) at its discontinuity. First, 
we assume that the function varies linearly across the discontinuity, as 
shown in Fig. 12.8. In this figure, note that as 
0
∈→ an abrupt disconti-
nuity occurs at the origin. When we differentiate the function, the deriva-
tive between ∈
− and ∈
+  is constant, with a value of 
∈
1 2 . For 
∈
>
t
, the 
derivative is −
∈
(
)
−
−
ae
a t
. Figure 12.9 shows these observations graphically. 
As ∈ approaches zero, the value of ′f t( ) between 
∈
±  approaches infin-
ity. At the same time, the duration of this large value is approaching zero. 
Furthermore, the area under ′f t( ) between ∈
±  remains constant as 
0.
∈→
 
In this example, the area is unity. As ∈ approaches zero, we say that the 
function between 
∈
±  approaches a unit impulse function, denoted δ t( ). 
Thus, the derivative of f t( ) at the origin approaches a unit impulse function 
as ∈ approaches zero, or
f
t
(0)
( )
as
0.
δ
∈
′
→
→
If the area under the impulse function curve is other than unity, the 
impulse function is denoted 
δ
K
t( ), where K is the area. K is often referred 
to as the strength of the impulse function.
To summarize, an impulse function is created from a variable- 
parameter function whose parameter approaches zero. The variable- 
parameter function must exhibit the following three characteristics as the para-
meter approaches zero:
1. The amplitude of the function approaches infinity.
2. The duration of the function approaches zero.
3. The area under the variable-parameter function is constant as the 
parameter value changes.
Many different variable-parameter functions have these three characteris-
tics. In Fig. 12.8, we used a linear function

example of a variable-parameter function with the three characteristics is 
the exponential function:

As ∈ approaches zero, the function becomes infinite at the origin and at 
the same time decays to zero in an infinitesimal length of time.

Introduction to the Laplace Transform
12.4 Functional Transforms
The Laplace transform of a specified function of t is called a functional 
transform. Because we are using the unilateral, or one-sided, Laplace 
transform, we define all functions to be zero for 
<
−
t
0 .
We derived one functional transform pair in Section 12.3, where we 
showed that the Laplace transform of the unit impulse function equals 1. 
Next, we find the Laplace transform of the unit step function at the origin, 
where

12.5 Operational Transforms
Operational Laplace transforms define how mathematical operations per-
formed on f t( ) affect its Laplace transform, F s
( ). Operational transforms 
also define how mathematical operations performed on F(s) affect its cor-
responding time-domain function f(t). The operations we consider include 
(1) multiplication by a constant; (2) addition and subtraction; (3) differen-
tiation; (4) integration; (5) translation in the time domain; (6) translation 
in the frequency domain; and (7) scale changing.
Multiplication by a Constant

L f t
F s

then

Thus, multiplication of f t( ) by a constant corresponds to multiplying F s

by the same constant.

Translation in the time domain corresponds to multiplication by an expo-

to ensure that the resulting function is defined for all positive time.

We now use the Laplace transform to solve the ordinary integrodifferen-
tial equations that describe the behavior of a lumped-parameter circuit, 
such as the one shown in Fig. 12.16. We assume that no initial energy is 
stored in the circuit at the instant the switch is opened. The problem is to

Note that we represented the switch opening at

the source current and the unit step function, Idcu(t).
We transform the KCL equation into the s-domain using four opera-
tional transforms (multiplication by a constant, addition, integration, and 
differentiation) and one functional transform (unit step) to get

 is 
zero because the initial energy stored in the circuit is zero. Thus, we have

The inverse transform, which takes the solution from the s-domain to the 
time domain, is the subject of Section 12.7. In that section, we also pres-
ent a final, critical step: checking the validity of the resulting time-domain 
expression. This final step is not unique to the Laplace transform; it is 
always a good idea to test any derived solution to be sure it makes sense in 
terms of known system behavior.
Before continuing, we simplify the notation by dropping the paren-
thetical t in time-domain expressions and the parenthetical s in frequency- 
domain expressions. We use lowercase letters for all time-domain variables, 
and we represent the corresponding s-domain variables with uppercase let-
ters. Thus

Introduction to the Laplace Transform
12.7 Inverse Transforms
The expression for V s
( ) in Example 12.2 is a rational function of s. This 
means we can write V(s) as a ratio of two polynomials in s where only inte-
ger powers of s appear in the polynomials. For linear, lumped- parameter 
circuits with constant component values, the s-domain  expressions for the 
unknown voltages and currents are always rational functions of s. (For 
verification, work Problems 12.27–12.31.) If we can inverse-transform 
rational functions of s, we can find the time- domain expressions for the 
voltages and currents. This section presents a straightforward and system-
atic technique for finding the inverse transform of a rational function.
In general, we need to find the inverse transform of a function that 
has the form

The coefficients a and b are real constants, and the exponents m and 
n are positive integers. The ratio N s
D s
( )
( ) is called a proper rational 
function if 
>
m
n, and an improper rational function if 
≤
m
n. Only a 
proper rational function can be expanded as a sum of partial fractions. 
This restriction poses no problem, as we show at the end of this section.

The expression for V(s) is not a familiar functional 
Laplace transform, so we cannot use Tables  12.1 
and 12.2 to find its inverse transform. But note that 
we can rewrite the denominator of V(s) as the prod-
uct of two factors:

=

Now, recognize that we can write V(s) as the sum 
of two terms, with each factor appearing in the 
denominator of one term:
(

(
)
=
+
+
+
V s
K

Each of these terms looks like a familiar Laplace 
transform. Using the transform for the exponential 
function (Table  12.1) and the operational trans-
forms for multiplication by a constant and addition 
(Table 12.2) we predict that v(t) is the sum of two 
exponential terms in the form 
−
e

20,000  and 
−

80,000 .

Partial Fraction Expansion: Proper Rational 
Functions
A proper rational function is expanded into a sum of partial fractions by 
writing a term or a series of terms for each root of D s
( ). Thus, D s
( ) must 
be factored before we construct a partial fraction expansion. For each dis-
tinct root of D s
( ), a single term appears in the sum of partial fractions. 
For each multiple root of D s
( ) of multiplicity r, the sum of partial frac-
tions contains r terms. For example, in the rational function
+
+
+
s
s s
s
6
(
3)(
1) ,
2
the denominator has four roots. Two of these roots are distinct—namely, 
at 
=
s
0 and 
= −
s
3. A multiple root of multiplicity 2 occurs at 
= −
s
1. 
Thus, the partial fraction expansion takes the form

that appear in each partial fraction term. There are only four different 
types of partial fraction terms because the roots of D s
( ) can be (1) real 
and distinct; (2) complex and distinct; (3) real and repeated; or (4) com-
plex and repeated. We develop a technique to determine the numerator 
coefficient for each type of partial fraction term. Before doing so, a few 
general comments are in order.
We used the 
≡
identity sign
in the partial fraction expansion to 
emphasize that expanding a rational function into a sum of partial frac-
tions establishes an identical equation. This means that both sides of 
the equation must be the same for all values of the variable s. Also, the 
identity  relationship must hold when the same mathematical operation is 
applied to both sides. These observations will help us calculate the coeffi-
cient values.
Before creating a partial fraction expansion, you should verify that 
the rational function is proper. This check is important because the proce-
dure for finding the partial fraction coefficients will not prevent you from 
generating invalid results if the rational function is improper. We present 
a procedure for checking the coefficients, but you can avoid wasted effort 
by always asking, “Is F s
( ) a proper rational function?”
Partial Fraction Expansion: Distinct Real Roots of D(s)
Let’s find the partial fraction expansion of a proper rational function 
whose denominator has distinct real roots. For example,

It is a good idea to test this result. While the 
choice of test values is completely open, we choose 
values that are easy to verify. For example, testing 
at either −5 or −12 is convenient because in both

Partial Fraction Expansion: Distinct Complex Roots 
of D(s)
We begin by noting that if F(s) describes the Laplace transform of a volt-
age or current in a physically realizable circuit, the factors of D(s) that 
have complex roots will always come in conjugate pairs. Let’s assume that

We find the unknown coefficients, K1 and K2, using the same tech-
nique we employed when the factors of D(s) were real and distinct. As 
you will see, the only difference is that the algebra involves complex num-
bers. To find K1, we multiply both sides of the identity by the denomina-

Compare the expression for K1 with the expression for K2; K1 and K2 
are conjugates. This will always be the case when D(s) has complex roots,

Introduction to the Laplace Transform
Partial Fraction Expansion: Repeated Real Roots of D(s)
We describe two methods for finding the partial fraction coefficients for 
terms generated by a multiple root with multiplicity r. Method A requires 
you to solve several simultaneous algebraic equations. Method B is a 
modification of the process we have been using to find the coefficients 
for the partial fraction terms associated with distinct roots. Both methods 
begin with the identity relating the original s-domain function, which must 
be a proper rational function, and its partial fraction expansion:

Method A
1. Combine all terms in the partial fraction expansion over the common 
denominator, D(s). Call the numerator of this new function N1(s).
2. Collect all of the terms in the numerator N1(s) according to their 
power of s. The coefficient of each power of s will include some of 
the unknown partial fraction coefficients.
3. Equate the coefficient of each power of s in N1(s) with the coeffi-
cient of the corresponding power of s in N(s). The result is a col-
lection of simultaneous equations whose unknowns are the partial 
fraction coefficients.
4. Solve the simultaneous equations to find the partial fraction 
coefficients.
Method B
1. Multiply both sides of the identity defining the partial fraction 
expansion by the multiple root raised to its rth power. Call the 
resulting identity Ir.
2. Find K in the numerator of the factor raised to the rth power by 
evaluating both sides of Ir at the multiple root.
3. To find K in the numerator of the factor raised to the 
−
r
(
1) power, 
differentiate both sides of Ir with respect to s. Call the resulting 
identity 
−
I r
(
1). Evaluate both sides of 
−
I r
(
1) at the multiple root. 
The right-hand side is always the desired K, and the left-hand side 
is always its numerical value.
4. Repeat Step 3 to find the remaining partial fraction coefficients by 
differentiating 
−
I r
(

−
I r
(

differentiated

Introduction to the Laplace Transform
 Partial Fraction Expansion: Repeated Complex 
Roots of D(s)
We can find the coefficients of the partial fraction terms corresponding to 
repeated complex roots using either Method A or Method B. The algebra 
involves complex numbers. Recall that complex roots always appear in 
conjugate pairs and that the coefficients associated with a conjugate pair 
are also conjugates, so that only half the Ks need to be evaluated. We 
illustrate the process using Method B in Example 12.6.

Equations 12.11 and 12.12 are the key to finding the inverse transform 
for any partial fraction expansion with repeated roots. One further note 
regarding these two equations: In circuit analysis problems, r is seldom 
greater than 2. Therefore, the inverse transform of a rational function can 
be handled with four transform pairs. Table 12.3 lists these pairs.
Partial Fraction Expansion: Improper Rational 
Functions
An improper rational function can always be written as the sum of a poly-
nomial and a proper rational function. The polynomial is then inverse- 
transformed into impulse functions and derivatives of impulse functions, 
while the proper rational function is inverse-transformed by the tech-
niques outlined in this section.
We illustrate the procedure in Example 12.7.

 12.9 Initial- and Final-Value Theorems
The initial- and final-value theorems enable us to determine the behavior 
of f t( ) at 0 and ∞ from F s
( ). Hence, we can check the initial and final 
values of f t( ) to see if they conform to known circuit behavior, before 
actually finding the inverse transform of F s
( ).
The initial-value theorem states that

and the final-value theorem states that
The initial-value theorem assumes that f t( ) does not have an impulse func-
tion at the origin. The final-value theorem is valid only if the poles of F s
( ), 
except for a first-order pole at the origin, lie in the left half of the s plane.
To prove Eq. 12.14, we start with the operational transform of the 
first derivative:

Since the problem states that there is no energy 
stored in the circuit prior to the switch opening at

zero.
Before applying the final-value theorem, find 
the poles of V(s). They are −20,000 and −80,000, 
so both lie in the left-half complex plane, and we 
can use the final-value theorem to get

The first term in the inductor current is the transient response, which will 
decay to zero in about 7 ms. The second term in the inductor current is 
the steady-state response, which has the same frequency as the 60 Hz 
 sinusoidal source and will persist as long as this source is connected 
in the circuit. Note that the amplitude of the steady-state response is 
36.69 mA, which is less than the 40 mA current rating of the inductor. 
But the transient response has an initial amplitude of 147.14 mA, far 
greater than the 40 mA current rating. Calculate the value of the inductor 
current at

Clearly, the transient part of the response does not cause the induc-
tor current to exceed its rating initially. But we need a plot of the com-
plete response to determine whether or not the current rating is ever 
exceeded, as shown in Fig. 12.20.

Thus, the current rating is exceeded in the inductor, at least momentar-
ily. If we determine that we never want to exceed the current rating, we 
should reduce the magnitude of the sinusoidal source. This example 
illustrates the importance of considering the complete response of a cir-
cuit to a sinusoidal input, even if we are satisfied with the steady-state 
response.

Summary
• The Laplace transform is a tool for converting time- 
domain equations into frequency-domain equations, 
according to the following general definition:
f t
f t e

( )
( ), 
st

{

where f t( ) is the time-domain expression and F(s) is 
the frequency-domain expression. (See page 446.)
• The step function Ku t( ) describes a function that 
experiences a discontinuity from one constant level to 
another at some point in time. K is the magnitude of 
the jump; if 
=
K
1, Ku t( ) is the unit step function. (See 
page 447.)
• The impulse function

K is the strength of the impulse; if

δ
K
t( ) is the 
unit impulse function. (See page 449.)
• A functional transform is the Laplace transform of a 
specific function. Important functional transform pairs 
are summarized in Table 12.1. (See page 453.)
• Operational transforms define the general mathemati-
cal properties of the Laplace transform. Important oper-
ational transform pairs are summarized in Table  12.2. 
(See page 458.)
• In linear lumped-parameter circuits, F s
( ) is a rational 
function of s. (See page 460.)
• If F s
( ) is a proper rational function, the inverse transform 
is found by a partial fraction expansion. (See page 461.)
• If F s
( ) is an improper rational function, it can be 
 inverse-transformed by first expanding it into a sum of a 
polynomial and a proper rational function. (See page 469.)
• F s
( ) can be expressed as the ratio of two factored poly-
nomials. The roots of the denominator are called poles 
and are plotted as X's on the complex s plane. The roots 
of the numerator are called zeros and are plotted as O’s 
on the complex s plane. (See page 470.)

CHAPTER 
The Laplace Transform 
in Circuit Analysis
The Laplace transform has two characteristics that make it an 
attractive tool for circuit analysis.
• It transforms a set of linear constant-coefficient differential 
equations into a set of linear polynomial equations, which 
are easier to manipulate and solve.
• It automatically introduces into the polynomial equations 
the initial values of the current and voltage variables. Thus, 
initial conditions are an inherent part of the transform pro-
cess. (This contrasts with the classical approach to the solu-
tion of differential equations, in which initial conditions are 
considered when the unknown coefficients are evaluated.)
We begin this chapter by showing how to avoid writing 
time-domain integrodifferential equations and transforming them 
into the s domain. In Section 13.1, we’ll develop the s- domain cir-
cuit models for resistors, inductors, and capacitors. Then we can 
transform entire circuits into the s domain and write the s-domain 
equations directly. Section 13.2 reviews Ohm’s and Kirchhoff’s 
laws for s-domain circuits. After establishing these fundamentals, 
we apply the Laplace transform method to a variety of circuit 
problems in Section 13.3, using the circuit analysis and simplifica-
tion tools first introduced for resistive circuits.
After solving for the circuit response in the s domain, we 
 inverse-transform back to the time domain, using partial fraction 
expansion (as demonstrated in Chapter 12). As before, checking 
the final time-domain equations in terms of the initial conditions 
and final values is an important step in the solution process.
We introduce a new concept, the transfer function, in 
Section 13.4. The transfer function for a circuit is the ratio of the 
Laplace transform of its output to the Laplace transform of its input. 
In Chapters  14 and 15, we’ll use the transfer function in circuit 
design, but here we focus on using it for circuit analysis. We con-
tinue this chapter with a look at the role of partial fraction  expansion 
(Section  13.5) and the convolution integral (Section  13.6) when 
using the transfer function in circuit analysis. We conclude with a 
discussion of the impulse function in circuit analysis.

CHAPTER OBJECTIVES

Practical Perspective 
Surge Suppressors
When using personal computers and other sensitive 
 electronic equipment, we need to provide protection from 
voltage surges. These surges can occur during a lightning 
storm or just by switching an electrical device on or off. 
A commercially available surge suppressor is shown in 
the accompanying figure.
How can flipping a switch to turn on a light or turn 
off a hair dryer cause a voltage surge? At the end of this 
chapter, we will answer that question using Laplace trans-
form techniques to analyze a circuit. We will illustrate how 
a voltage surge can be created by switching off a resistive 
load in a circuit operating in the sinusoidal steady state.

The Laplace Transform in Circuit Analysis
13.1 Circuit Elements in the s Domain
A three-step procedure transforms each circuit element into an s-domain 
equivalent circuit.
1. Write the time-domain equation relating the terminal voltage to 
the terminal current.
2. Laplace transform the time-domain equation to generate an alge-
braic relationship between the s-domain current and voltage.
3. Construct a circuit model that satisfies the relationship between 
the s-domain current and voltage.
Note the s-domain dimensions: the s-domain voltage dimension is 
 volt-seconds [V-s], the s-domain current dimension is ampere-seconds 
[A-s], and thus the s-domain voltage-to-current ratio dimension is volts 
per ampere, or ohms. An impedance in the s domain is measured in ohms, 
and an  admittance is measured in siemens. We use the passive sign con-
vention in all the derivations.
A Resistor in the s Domain
We begin with the resistor. From Ohm’s law,

From Eq. 13.1 we see that the s-domain equivalent circuit of a resistor is a 
resistance of R ohms that carries a current of I ampere-seconds and has a 
terminal voltage of V volt-seconds.
Figure  13.1 shows the time- and frequency-domain circuits of the 
resistor. Note that going from the time domain to the frequency domain 
does not change the resistance element.

One circuit configuration that satisfies Eq. 13.2 is an impedance

erence direction for i, then I 0 has a negative value.
We can also solve Eq. 13.2 for the current I and then construct the

The s-domain equivalent circuit that satisfies this equation is an 
impedance of sL ohms in parallel with an independent current source of

There are two other ways to construct the s domain circuit in Fig. 13.4: 
(1) find the Norton equivalent of the circuit shown in Fig. 13.3 or (2) start 
with the inductor current as a function of the inductor voltage in the time 
domain and then Laplace transform the resulting integral equation. We 
leave these two approaches to Problems 13.1 and 13.2.
If the initial energy stored in the inductor is zero, that is, if 
=
I
0,
0
 
the s-domain equivalent circuit is an inductor with an impedance of sL 
ohms. Figure 13.5 shows this circuit.
A Capacitor in the s Domain
A capacitor with initial stored energy also has two s-domain equivalent 
circuits. Figure 13.6 shows a capacitor initially charged to V0 volts. The 
capacitor current is

so the s-domain current I is the sum of two branch currents. One branch 
contains an admittance of sC siemens, and the second branch contains an 
independent current source of CV0 ampere-seconds. Figure 13.7 shows 
this parallel equivalent circuit.
To derive the other equivalent circuit for the charged capacitor, solve 
Eq. 13.3 for V:

Figure 13.8 shows the circuit that satisfies the equation for capacitor volt-
age, which is a series combination of an impedance and an independent 
voltage source.
In the equivalent circuits shown in Figs. 13.7 and 13.8, V0 carries its 
own algebraic sign. In other words, if the polarity of V0 is opposite to the 
reference polarity for υ, V0 is a negative quantity. If the initial voltage on 
the capacitor is zero, both equivalent circuits reduce to an impedance of 
sC
1
 ohms, as shown in Fig. 13.9.
In Chapter 9 we used the phasor transform to turn a time-domain cir-
cuit into a frequency-domain circuit. In this chapter, we use the s- domain 
equivalent circuits, summarized in Table 13.1, to transform a time- domain 
circuit into the s domain. When the time-domain circuit contains induc-
tors and capacitors with initial stored energy, you need to decide whether 
to use the parallel or series s-domain equivalent circuit. With a little 
 forethought and some experience, the best choice is often evident.

13.2 Circuit Analysis in the s Domain
Before presenting a method for using the s-domain equivalent circuits in 
analysis, we make some important observations.
• If no energy is stored in the inductor or capacitor, the relationship 
between the s-domain voltage and current for each passive element is:

TABLE 13.1  Summary of the s-Domain Equivalent Circuits
where Z is the s-domain impedance of the element. Thus, a resistor 
has an impedance of R ohms, an inductor has an impedance of sL 
ohms, and a capacitor has an impedance of 
sC
1
 ohms. The relation-
ship contained in Eq. 13.4 also appears in Figs. 13.1(b), 13.5, and 13.9. 
Equation 13.4 is known as Ohm’s law in the s domain. The reciprocal 
of the impedance is admittance. Therefore, the s-domain  admittance 
of a resistor is 
R
1
 siemens, an inductor has an admittance of 
sL
1
 
siemens, and a capacitor has an admittance of sC siemens.

• The rules for combining impedances and admittances in the s 
domain are the same as those for frequency-domain circuits. Thus, 
 series- parallel simplifications and ∆-to-Y conversions also are appli-
cable to s-domain analysis.
• Kirchhoff’s laws apply to s-domain currents and voltages because an 
operational Laplace transform states that the Laplace transform of a 
sum of time-domain functions equals the sum of the Laplace trans-
forms of the individual functions (see Table 12.2). The algebraic sum 
of the currents at a node is zero in the time domain, so the algebraic 
sum of the Laplace-transformed currents is also zero. A similar state-
ment holds for the algebraic sum of the Laplace-transformed voltages 
around a closed path. The s-domain version of Kirchhoff’s laws is
 
∑
=
I
at every node in a circuit,
alg 
0,  
(13.5)
 
∑
=
V
around every closed path in a circuit,
alg 
0.  
(13.6)
Therefore, because Ohm’s law, KVL, and KCL hold in the s domain, 
all of the circuit-analysis techniques developed in Chapters 2–4 for resistive 
circuits can be used to analyze circuits in the s domain. These  techniques 
include combining impedances in series and parallel to find equivalent 
 impedances, voltage division and current division, the node-voltage method 
and the mesh-current method, source transformation, and Thévenin and 
Norton equivalent circuits. This leads us to the following step-by-step pro-
cedure for using Laplace transform techniques to analyze circuits.
Step 1 determines the initial current in each inductor and the initial volt-
age across each capacitor by analyzing the time-domain circuit for 
<
t
0.
Step 2 transforms each independent voltage or current source defined by 
time-domain functions into the s domain using the functional and opera-
tional transforms in Tables 12.1 and 12.2.
Step 3  transforms voltages and currents represented by time-domain sym-
bols such as v(t) and i(t) into corresponding s-domain symbols such as V 
and I.
Step 4 transforms any remaining components in the time-domain circuit 
into the s domain using the circuits in Table  13.1. When inductors and 
capacitors have nonzero initial values, calculated in Step 1, these initial 
conditions are represented by independent sources in series or parallel 
with the component impedances.
Step 5 analyzes the resulting s-domain circuit using the techniques devel-
oped for resistive circuits in Chapters 2–4. The analysis produces s-domain 
voltages and currents that should each be represented as a ratio of two 
polynomials in s.
Step 6 applies the initial- and final-value theorems to the s-domain functions 
from Step 5 to check the values of the corresponding time-domain functions 
at 
=
t
0 and 
= ∞
t
. Note that it might not be possible to apply one or both 
of these theorems, depending on the form of the s-domain function.
Step 7 represents each s-domain voltage and current of interest as a  partial 
fraction expansion and then uses Table 12.3 to  inverse-Laplace-transform 
the s-domain voltages and currents back to the time domain.
This analysis method yields the complete response to any circuit 
whose voltage and current sources have Laplace transforms. This method 
represents the most comprehensive circuit analysis technique presented in 
this text and is summarized in Analysis Method 13.1. Example 13.1 applies 
the first five steps in Analysis Method 13.1 to a time-domain circuit.

EXAMPLE 13.2  The Natural Response of an RC Circuit
The circuit in Fig. 13.11 was analyzed in Example 7.3  
using first-order circuit analysis techniques. Use the 
Laplace transform method to find vo(t) for 
≥

Solution
Apply the Laplace transform method using 
Analysis Method 13.1.
Step 1:  Determine the initial voltage across the 
capacitor by analyzing the circuit in Fig. 13.11 for 
<
t
0. Because the switch has been in position 
x for a long time, the capacitor behaves like an 
open circuit. The voltage across the open circuit 
=

Step 2:  For 
≥
t
0, there are no voltage or current 
sources in the circuit, so we can skip this step.
Step 3:  The voltage across the 
Ω
240 k  resistor 
is represented in the s domain as V, as shown in 
Fig. 13.12.
Step 4:  The impedance of the three resistors is 
their resistance. The impedance of the capacitor is

Because the capacitor has an initial condition,  
we must decide whether to represent it using a

Here we use the series-connected voltage source, 
whose value is

Apply the Laplace transform method using

Step 1:  Both initial conditions are given in the 
problem statement, so we can skip this step.

of the current source and the switch in Fig. 13.13 as 
24u(t) mA. The Laplace transform of this function 
is 
s

the s-domain circuit in Fig. 13.14.
Step 3:  The voltage across the 240 kΩ resistor

Both the inductor and capacitor have non-

to represent them as series-connected voltage 
sources or as parallel-connected current sources, 
as shown in Table  13.1. Here we use parallel- 
connected current sources because the resulting 
circuit has only parallel- connected components.

is behaving like a short circuit, and the capacitor 
is behaving like an open circuit in parallel with the

13.3 Applications

Next, we analyze a circuit with a sinusoidal source using Laplace meth-
ods. Phasor methods, presented in Chapter 9, were used to analyze circuits 
with sinusoidal sources but have an important limitation—they only pro-
duce the steady-state response of the circuit, not the complete response. 
Recall that the complete response consists of both the  steady-state and 
the transient response. Laplace methods do not have this limitation, so 
they produce a circuit’s complete response to a sinusoidal source, as seen 
in Example 13.4.

The first term in the expression for i(t) is the 
steady-state response. Its frequency matches the 
frequency of the source, and this term persists for 
all time. You should use the phasor methods from 
Chapter 9 to verify this result. The second term in 
the expression for i(t) is the transient response, or 
the natural response. Note that it decays to zero as 
→∞
t
. This part of the response is independent of 
the voltage source and is based only on the passive 
component values and their interconnections.

13.3 Applications 
493
Until now, we avoided analyzing circuits with inductors and capaci-
tors that have two or more meshes, or three or more essential nodes. Such 
circuits are described by two or more simultaneous differential equations, 
and the techniques for solving these systems of equations are beyond the 
scope of this text. However, using Laplace techniques, we can transform 
a circuit into the s domain and write a set of simultaneous algebraic equa-
tions, whose solution is much more manageable. Example 13.5 illustrates 
this by solving a circuit with two meshes.

age source and the switch can be described in the 
time domain as 336u(t) V. Using the functional and

We can use Thévenin and Norton equivalents to simplify circuits 
in the s domain. When one part of the circuit changes frequently while 
another part remains constant, we can find a simpler equivalent for the 
constant part of the circuit that makes analysis of the entire circuit eas-
ier. Example 13.6 creates a Thévenin equivalent to simplify part of an 
s-domain circuit.

EXAMPLE 13.6   Creating a Thévenin Equivalent in the s Domain
We want to find the capacitor current, iC, for the 
circuit in Fig. 13.20. The circuit has no initial stored 
energy, and at 
=
t
0, the switch closes. Find the 
Thévenin equivalent for the circuit to the left of the 
terminals a and b in the s domain, using Laplace 
methods. Then analyze the simplified circuit to find 
iC(t) for 
≥
t
0.
Solution
Apply the Laplace transform method using Analysis 
Method 13.1.
Step 1:  There is no initial stored energy, so both ini-
tial conditions are zero.
Step 2:  The series connection of the 480 V dc volt-
age source and the switch can be described in the 
time domain as 480u(t) V. Using the functional and 
operational transform tables (Tables 12.1 and 12.2), 
the Laplace transform of this voltage is

This is the value of the voltage source for the  
s-domain circuit in Fig. 13.21.
Step 3:  The capacitor current and voltage are rep-
resented in the s domain as IC and VC, as shown in 
Fig. 13.21.
Step 4:  The impedance of the resistors is their 
 resistance. The impedances of the inductor and

The Laplace Transform in Circuit Analysis
The s-domain circuit that results from Steps 1–4 is 
shown in Fig. 13.21.
Step 5:  The Thévenin voltage is the open-circuit 
voltage across terminals a and b. Under open- 
circuit conditions, there is no voltage across the 
60 Ω  resistor. Using voltage division,

Let’s calculate the initial capacitor current from the 
circuit in Fig. 13.20. The initial inductor current is zero 
and the initial capacitor voltage is zero, so the ini-
tial capacitor current is 
+
480 (20
60) or 6 A, which 
agrees with the prediction of the initial-value theorem. 
The final value of the capacitor current is zero because 
as

 in the circuit shown in Fig. 13.20, the capac-
itor behaves like an open circuit. This final capacitor 
current also agrees with the prediction of the final- 
value theorem.

EXAMPLE 13.7   Analyzing a Circuit with Mutual Inductance
Consider the circuit in Fig.  13.23. The make- 
beforebreak switch has been in position a for a long 
time. At 
=
t
0, the switch moves instantaneously to 
position b. Use Laplace methods to find i2(t) for ≥
t
0.
Solution
Apply the Laplace transform method using Analysis  
Method 13.1.
Step 1:  Because the switch has been in posi-
tion a for a long time, both inductors behave like 
short circuits. The current in the 2 H inductor is 
+
=
60 (9

5 A, and the current in the 8  H 
 inductor is zero. Therefore,

 and

Step 2:  For 
≥
t
0, there is no independent source 
in the circuit, so we can skip this step.
Step 3:  The currents in the two coils are repre-
sented in the s domain as I1 and I2.
Step 4:  Before calculating the impedance of the 
resistors and inductors, we replace the magnet-
ically coupled coils with a T-equivalent circuit.1 
Figure 13.24 shows the new circuit.
The impedance of the resistors is their resis-
tance, and the impedance of the inductors is sL. 
Because we plan to use the mesh-current method 
in the s domain, we use the series-equivalent cir-
cuit for inductors carrying initial current. We place 
a voltage source in the vertical leg of the tee, to 
represent the initial value of the current in that

13.3 Applications

Because we are analyzing linear lumped-parameter circuits, we 
can use superposition to divide the response into components that can 
be identified with particular sources and initial conditions. We need to 
identify these components in order to use the transfer function, which we 
introduce in the next section. Example 13.8 illustrates superposition in the 
s domain by revisiting the circuit from Example 13.3 and separating its 
output voltage, v, into three components, two associated with the circuit’s 
initial conditions and one associated with the circuit’s independent source.
EXAMPLE 13.8  Applying Superposition in the s Domain
Repeat the analysis of the s-domain circuit for 
Example 13.3, shown in Fig.  13.14. Use superpo-
sition to separate the time-domain voltage v into 
three components, each one being the response to 
one of the three sources in Fig. 13.14.
Solution
Since each source in Fig. 13.14 is a current source, 
we will use Ohm’s law to find each component of 
V, using the equivalent impedance of the three 
 parallel-connected impedances. This equivalent 
impedance, calculated in Example 13.3, is

13.4 The Transfer Function
The transfer function is defined as the s-domain ratio of the Laplace 
transform of the output (response) to the Laplace transform of the input 
(source). As we will see, the transfer function characterizes a circuit’s 
behavior in a single s-domain expression, without revealing what compo-
nents make up the circuit or how those components are interconnected. In 
computing the transfer function, we only consider circuits where all initial 
conditions are zero. If a circuit has multiple independent sources, we can 
find the transfer function for each source and use superposition to find the 
response to all sources.
The transfer function is

where Y s
( ) is the Laplace transform of the output signal, and X s
( ) is 
the Laplace transform of the input signal. Note that the transfer function 
depends on what is defined as the output signal. Consider, for example, 
the series circuit shown in Fig. 13.30. If the current is defined as the output 
signal of the circuit,

Thus, because circuits may have multiple sources and because the definition 
of the output signal of interest can vary, a single circuit can generate many 
transfer functions. Remember that when multiple sources are involved, no 
single transfer function can represent the total output; transfer functions 
associated with each source must be combined using superposition to yield 
the total response. Example 13.9 illustrates the computation of a transfer 
function for known numerical values of R, L, and C.
EXAMPLE 13.9   Deriving the Transfer Function of a Circuit

Fig. 13.31. The output signal is the voltage across 
the capacitor, v .

a)  Find the transfer function for this circuit.
b) Calculate the numerical values for the poles and 
zeros of the transfer function.
Solution
a) Use Analysis Method 13.1 to construct and ana-
lyze the s-domain circuit.
Step 1: The circuit in Fig.  13.31 has no initial 
stored energy, an assumption we always make 
when calculating a circuit’s transfer function. 
Therefore, we can skip this step.
Step 2: There are no independent sources des-
cribed by a time-domain function in this circuit, 
so we can skip this step.
Step 3: Represent the source and output voltages 
using Vg and Vo, respectively, as shown in  Fig. 13.32.
Step 4: The impedance of the resistors is their 
resistance. The impedances of the inductor and

The Location of Poles and Zeros of H(s)
For linear lumped-parameter circuits, H s
( ) is always a rational function of s. 
Complex poles and zeros always occur in conjugate pairs. The poles of H s
( ) 
must lie in the left half of the s plane if the response to a bounded source (one 
whose values lie within some finite bounds) is to be bounded. The zeros of 
H s
( ) may lie in either the right half or the left half of the s plane.
With these general characteristics in mind, we next discuss the role 
that H s
( ) plays in determining the circuit’s output.
13.5  The Transfer Function in Partial 
Fraction Expansions
Using the definition of a circuit’s transfer function (Eq. 13.7), we can find 
the circuit’s output by multiplying the transfer function and the circuit’s 
input:

13.5 The Transfer Function in Partial Fraction Expansions

We have already noted that H s
( ) is a rational function of s; X s
( ) also is 
a rational function of s for the time-domain functions of most interest in 
circuit analysis (see Table 12.1).
Expanding the right-hand side of Eq. 13.8 into a sum of partial frac-
tions produces a term for each pole of H s
( ) and X s
( ). The terms gener-
ated by the poles of H s
( ) correspond to the transient components of the 
total response. The terms generated by the poles of X s
( ) correspond to 
the steady-state components of the response, which exist after the tran-
sient components have become negligible. Example 13.10 illustrates these 
general observations.

Observations on the Use of H(s) in Circuit Analysis
Example 13.10 related the components that make up a circuit’s response 
to the poles of the transfer function, H(s), and the poles of the circuit’s 
input in the s domain, using a partial fraction expansion. However, the 
example raises questions about driving a circuit with an increasing ramp 
voltage that generates an increasing ramp response. Eventually, exces-
sive voltage will cause the circuit components to fail, and then our linear 
model is invalid. But some practical applications have input ramp func-
tions that increase to some maximum value over a finite time interval, 
so the response to a ramp input is important. If the time it takes for the 
ramp to reach its maximum value is long compared with the time con-
stants of the circuit, the solution assuming an unbounded ramp is valid for 
this finite time interval.
Here are some additional observations about a circuit’s transfer func-
tion, defined in Eq. 13.7.
• If the circuit’s input is delayed by a seconds,

Therefore, delaying the input by a seconds delays the output by a 
seconds. A circuit that exhibits this characteristic is time invariant.
• If the circuit’s input is a unit impulse, the circuit’s output equals the 
inverse transform of the transfer function. Thus, if
x t

then

and
( )

Hence,

h t
( )

so the inverse transform of the transfer function equals the unit 
impulse response of the circuit.
• A circuit’s unit impulse response is also its natural response because 
applying an impulsive source is equivalent to instantaneously storing 
energy in the circuit (see Section 13.8). The subsequent release of this 
stored energy is the circuit’s natural response (see Problem 13.87).
• A circuit’s unit impulse response, h t( ), contains enough information 
to compute the response to any source that drives the circuit. We can 
extract a circuit’s response to an arbitrary source from the circuit’s 
unit impulse response, using the convolution integral. This technique 
is demonstrated in the next section.

We are interested in the convolution integral for several reasons.
• We can find a circuit’s output for any input by working entirely in the 
time domain. This is beneficial when x t( ) and h t( ) are known only 
through experimental data. In such cases, using Laplace transform 
methods may be awkward or even impossible, as we would need to 
compute the Laplace transform of experimental data.
• The convolution integral introduces the concepts of memory and the 
weighting function into analysis. The concept of memory enables us 
to predict, to some degree, how closely the output waveform repli-
cates the input waveform, using the impulse response (or the weight-
ing function) h t( ).
• The convolution integral provides a formal procedure for finding the 
inverse transform of products of Laplace transforms.
To derive Eq. 13.9, we assume that the circuit is linear and time 
in variant. Because the circuit is linear, the principle of superposition is 
valid, and because it is time invariant, the response delay and the input 
delay are the same. Consider Fig.  13.34, in which the block containing 
h t( ) represents any linear time-invariant circuit whose impulse response

The Laplace Transform in Circuit Analysis
is known, x t( ) represents the input signal and y t( ) represents the output 
signal. We also assume the following:
• 
x t( ) is the general signal shown in Fig. 13.35(a).
• 
=
x t( )
0 for <
−
t

ing 
=
x t( )
0 for <

0 , extending the integral to include excitation 
functions that exist for all time is straightforward.
• A discontinuity in x t( ) at the origin (between 
−
0  and 
+
0 ) is permitted.

of the circuit represented by the box in Fig. 13.34 is the exponential decay

The integrals in Eq. 13.9 give the most general relationship for the 
convolution of two functions. However, when we apply the convolution 
integral, we can change the lower limit to zero and the upper limit to t. 
Then we can write Eq. 13.9 as

We change the limits for two reasons. First, for physically realizable cir-
cuits, h t( ) is zero for 
<
t
0 because there is no impulse response before 
you apply an impulse. Second, we start measuring time at the instant we 
turn on the input x t( ); therefore 
=
x t( )
0 for t

A graphic interpretation of the convolution integrals (Eq. 13.9) helps 
us use convolution as a computational tool. We begin with the first integral 
and assume that the circuit’s impulse response is the exponential decay 
function shown in Fig. 13.37(a) and its input function has the waveform 
shown in Fig. 13.37(b). In each of the plots, we replace t with λ, the symbol 

508

of integration. Replacing λ with λ
− folds the excitation function over the 
vertical axis, as shown in Fig. 13.37(c). The folding operation explains why 
Eq. 13.9 is called the convolution integral. Replacing λ
− with 
λ
−
t
 slides 
the folded function to the right, as shown in Fig. 13.37(d).
At any specified value of t, the output function y t( ) is the area under 
the product function 
λ
λ
(
) (
)
−
h
x t
, as shown in Fig. 13.37(e). This plot 
explains why we can set the lower limit on the convolution integral to 
zero and the upper limit to t. For λ < 0, the product 
λ

(
) (
)
−

 is 
zero because 
λ
(

h
 is zero. For λ > t, the product 
λ

−
h
x t
 is zero 
because 
λ

 is zero.
Figure 13.38 shows the second form of the convolution integral. Once 
again, the product function in Fig. 13.38(e) explains why we use zero for 
the lower limit and t for the upper limit.
Example 13.11 illustrates how to use the convolution integral and the 
unit impulse response to find a circuit’s output in response to a given input.

SELF-CHECK: Assess your understanding of convolution by trying Chapter Problems 13.64 and 13.65.
The Concepts of Memory and the Weighting 
Function
We mentioned at the beginning of this section that the convolution inte-
gral introduces the concepts of memory and the weighting function into 
circuit analysis. The graphical interpretation of the convolution integral 
is the easiest way to understand these concepts. We can view the folding 
and sliding of a circuit’s input function on a time scale divided into past, 
present, and future time intervals. The vertical axis represents the present 
value of x(t), with past values to the right of the vertical axis and future 
values to the left. Figure 13.43 shows this description of x(t), using the 
input function from Example 13.11.
When we combine the past, present, and future views of 
τ
(
)
−
x t
 
with the impulse response of the circuit, we see that the impulse response 
weights x t( ) according to present and past values. For example, Fig. 13.41 
shows that the impulse response in Example 13.11 gives less weight to 
past values of x t( ) than to the present value of x t( ). In other words, the 
circuit “remembers” less and less about past input values. Therefore, 
in Fig. 13.42, v o quickly approaches zero when the present value of the 
input is zero (that is, when 
>
t
10 s). Since the present value of the input 
receives more weight than the past values, the output quickly approaches 
the present value of the input.
Because the convolution integral uses the product of 
λ
(
)
−
x t
 and 
λ
(
)
h
, the impulse response is considered the circuit’s weighting function. 
The weighting function, in turn, determines how much memory the circuit 
has. Memory represents how accurately the circuit’s response matches 
its input. For example, if the impulse response, or weighting function, is 
flat, as shown in Fig. 13.44(a), it gives equal weight to all values of x t( ), 
past and present. Such a circuit has a perfect memory. However, if the 
impulse response is an impulse function, as shown in Fig. 13.44(b), it gives 
no weight to past values of x(t) and the circuit has no memory.

13.7 The Transfer Function and the Steady-State Sinusoidal Response 
511
The more memory a circuit has, the more distortion exists between 
the circuit’s input waveform and its output. We can demonstrate this by 
assuming that the circuit has no memory, that is, 
δ
=
h t
A

( )
( ), and then 
noting from the convolution integral that

The expression for y(t) shows that, if the circuit has no memory, the out-
put is a scaled replica of the input.
The circuit shown in Example 13.11 illustrates the distortion between 
input and output for a circuit that has some memory. This distortion is 
clear when we plot the input and output waveforms on the same graph, as 
in Fig. 13.45.
13.7  The Transfer Function and 
the Steady-State Sinusoidal 
Response
Once we have computed a circuit’s transfer function, we can use it to find 
the steady-state response to a sinusoidal input. To show this, we assume that
ω
φ
=
+
x t
A

and then we use Eq. 13.8 to find the steady-state solution of y t( ). To find 
the Laplace transform of x t( ), we first write x t( ) as

 But the terms corresponding to the poles 
of H s
( ) do not contribute to the steady-state response of y t( ), because 
all these poles lie in the left half of the s plane. Consequently, the corre-
sponding time-domain terms approach zero as t increases. Thus, only the 
first two partial fraction terms determine the steady-state response, so we 
only have to calculate a single partial fraction coefficient, K1:

The relationship between H s

H j
 provides a link between 
the time domain and the frequency domain. Using Eq. 13.11, we can find 
the sinusoidal steady-state response of a circuit by evaluating

Theoretically, we can reverse the process; instead of using H s

H j
 to find H s
( ). To do so, we determine

experimentally and then construct H s
( ) from the data. Once we know 
H s
( ), we can find the circuit’s response to other inputs. While this experi-
mental approach is not always possible, in some cases it does provide a way 
to find H(s) for a circuit whose components and their values are unknown.
The transfer function is also used to find a circuit’s frequency response,

The Laplace Transform in Circuit Analysis
13.8  The Impulse Function in Circuit 
Analysis
Circuit analysis uses impulse functions to represent a switching operation 
or because a circuit’s input is an impulsive source. We can use Laplace 
transform methods to determine the impulsive currents and voltages 
created during switching, and to find a circuit’s response to an impul-
sive source. To begin, we create an impulse function with a switching 
operation.
Switching Operations
We use two different circuits to create an impulse function with a switch-
ing operation: a capacitor circuit, and a series inductor circuit.
Capacitor Circuit
In the circuit shown in Fig. 13.47, the capacitor C1 is charged to an initial 
voltage of V0 at the time the switch is closed. The initial charge on C2 
is zero. We want to find the expression for i t( )  as

rent starts from a larger initial value and then drops off more rapidly. 
Figure 13.49 shows these characteristics of i.
As R approaches zero, the initial value of i approaches infinity and 
the duration of i approaches zero. If the area under the current function is 
independent of R, i approaches an impulse function. Physically, the total 
area under the i versus t curve represents the total charge transferred to 
C2 after the switch is closed. Thus

EXAMPLE 13.13   A Series Inductor Circuit with an Impulsive Response
The switch in the circuit shown in Fig.  13.50 has 
been closed for a long time. At 
=
t
0 it opens. Use 
Laplace methods to find the output voltage, vo, and 
the current in the 3 H inductor, i1.
Solution
Use Analysis Method 13.1 to construct and analyze 
the s-domain circuit.
Step 1:  For 
<
t
0, the switch is closed, and the 
inductors behave like short circuits. The current in 
the 2 H inductor is zero, since there is no source in 
that part of the circuit. The current in the 3 H inductor  
is 
=
100 10
10 A.
Step 2:  The combination of the dc voltage source 
and the switch is defined by the time-domain func-
tion 100u(t). The Laplace transform of this function 
is 100/s V-s, which labels the voltage source in the 
s-domain circuit in Fig. 13.51.
Step 3:  Represent the output voltage and current 
using Vo and I1, respectively, as shown in Fig. 13.51. 
Note that in the s-domain circuit, the current in 
both inductors is the same.
Step 4:  The impedance of the resistors is their resis-
tance. The impedance of the inductors is sL. We also 
need to represent the nonzero initial current in the 
3 H inductor using either a series-connected voltage 
source or a parallel-connected current source. Here, 
we choose the voltage source, so the resulting s- 
domain circuit has a single mesh. The voltage source 
has the value 
=
=
LI
3(10)

 V-s. The s-domain 
circuit resulting from Steps 1–4 is shown in Fig. 13.51.
Step 5:  From the circuit in Fig.  13.51, we find Vo 
using voltage division:

Do the solutions for the output voltage and current in the circuit of 
Fig. 13.50 make sense? Before the switch is opened, the current in the 
3 H inductor is 10 A, and the current in the 2 H inductor is 0 A. From 
the  equation for i1 derived in Example 13.13, we know that at 
=
+
t
0 , 
the current in both inductors is 6 A. This means the current in the 3 H 
inductor changes instantaneously from 10 to 6 A, while the current in the 
2 H inductor changes instantaneously from 0 to 6 A. Then, the current 
decreases exponentially from 6 A to a final value of 4 A. This final value 
is easily verified from the circuit; that is, it should equal 100 25, or 4 A. 
Figure 13.52 shows these characteristics of i1 and i .
2
Do these instantaneous jumps in the inductor current make sense in 
terms of the physical behavior of the circuit? First, note that when the 
switch opens in Fig.  13.50, the two inductors are in series. Any impul-
sive voltage appearing across the 3 H inductor must be exactly balanced 
by an impulsive voltage across the 2 H inductor because the sum of the 
impulsive voltages around a closed path must equal zero. Faraday’s law 
states that the induced voltage is proportional to the change in flux link-
age 
λ
=
v
d
dt
(
). Therefore, the change in flux linkage must sum to zero. 
In other words, the total flux linkage immediately after switching is the 
same as that before switching. For the circuit here, the flux linkage before 
switching is

Thus, the solution for i1 in Example 13.13 agrees with the principle of the 
conservation of flux linkage.
We now test the validity of vo from Example 13.13. First, we check 
the impulsive term 
δ t
12 ( ). The instantaneous jump of i2 from 0 to 6 A at 
=
t
0 means the derivative of i2 contains the impulse δ t

impulse results in a

tor. For t

This expression agrees with the last two terms of vo from Example 13.13. 
Thus, the expression for vo does make sense in terms of known circuit 
behavior.
We can also check the instantaneous drop from 10 to 6 A in the cur-
rent i .
1  This drop means the derivative of i1 contains the impulse 
δ
−
t
4 ( ). 
Therefore, the voltage across L1 includes the impulse 
δ
−
t
12 ( ). This 
impulse exactly balances the impulse included in the voltage across L ;
2  
that is, the sum of the impulsive voltages around a closed path equals zero.
Impulsive Sources
Impulse functions can appear in circuit sources as well as circuit outputs. 
These sources are called impulsive sources. An impulsive source creates a 
finite amount of energy in the circuit instantaneously. A mechanical anal-
ogy is striking a bell with an impulsive clapper blow. After the energy has 
been transferred to the bell, the natural response of the bell determines 
the tone emitted (that is, the frequency of the resulting sound waves) and 
the tone’s duration.
In the circuit shown in Fig. 13.53, an impulsive voltage source with a 
strength of V0 volt-seconds is applied to a series connection of a resistor 
and an inductor. When the voltage source is applied, the initial energy in 
the inductor is zero, so the initial current is zero. There is no voltage drop 
across R, so the impulsive voltage source appears directly across L. The 
impulsive voltage across the inductor creates an instantaneous current.

The Laplace Transform in Circuit Analysis
EXAMPLE 13.14    A Circuit with Both Internally Generated and Externally 
Applied Impulses
The switch in the circuit shown in Fig.  13.55 has 
been closed for a long time. At 
=
t
0 it opens. Use 
Laplace methods to find the output voltage, vo, and 
the current in the 3 H inductor, i1.
Solution
Note that the circuit in Fig. 13.55 was created from 
the circuit for Example 13.13 (Fig. 13.50) by add-
ing an impulsive voltage source of 
δ t
50 ( ) in series 
with the 100 V source. In Example 13.13, we found 
the s-domain circuit that corresponds to the time- 
domain circuit in Fig. 13.50. The s-domain circuit 
is shown in Fig. 13.51. To find the s-domain circuit  
corresponding to the circuit in Fig. 13.55, we add 
another voltage source in series, whose value is 
δ
{
} =

50 ( )
50 V-s. The s-domain equivalent cir-
cuit is shown in Fig. 13.56.

occurs as passive elements release or store energy. When a circuit is driven 
by an impulsive source, the total response is completely defined by the 
natural response; the duration of the impulsive source is so infinitesimal 
that it does not create a forced response.
We can also derive the inductor current using the Laplace transform 
method. Figure  13.54 shows the s-domain equivalent of the circuit in 
Fig. 13.53. From this circuit,

As before, we test the results of Example 13.14 to see whether they 
make sense. From the expression for i1, we see that the current in L1 and 
L2 is 16 A at 
=
+
t
0 . In Example 13.13, at the instant the switch opens, i1 
decreases from 10 to 6 A and i2  increases from 0 to 6 A. Superimposed on 
these changes is a 10 A current in L1 and L2, due to the impulsive voltage 
source; that is,

Therefore, i1 increases suddenly from 10 to 16 A, while i2  increases sud-
denly from 0 to 16 A. The final value of both currents is 4 A. Figure 13.57 
shows i1 and i2 graphically.
We can also find the abrupt changes in i1 and i2  without using super-
position. The sum of the impulsive voltages across the 3 H and 2 H induc-
tors equals 
δ t
50 ( ). Thus, the change in flux linkage must sum to 50; that is,

Practical Perspective 
Surge Suppressors
As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, voltage surges can 
occur in a circuit that is operating in the sinusoidal steady state. We 
use Laplace transform methods to see how a voltage surge is created 
between the line and neutral conductors of a household circuit when a 
load is switched off during sinusoidal steady-state operation.
Consider the phasor-transformed circuit shown in Fig. 13.59, which 
models a household circuit with three loads, one of which is switched off  
at 
=
t
0. To simplify the analysis, we assume that the  line-to-neutral 
voltage, Vo, is 
∠
(
)
120
0°  V rms , a standard household voltage, and that 
when the load is switched off at =
t
0, the value of Vg does not change. 
After the switch is opened, we can construct the s-domain circuit, as 
shown in Fig. 13.60. Note that because the phase angle of the voltage 
across the inductive load is 0°, the initial current through the inductive 
load is 0. Therefore, only the line inductance has a nonzero initial condi-
tion, which is modeled in the s-domain circuit as a voltage source with 
the value 
ℓ
L I 0, as seen in Fig. 13.60.
Just before the switch is opened at t
0
=
, each of the loads 
has a steady-state sinusoidal voltage with a peak magnitude of 
=
.
120 2
169 7 V. All of the current in the line from the voltage source 
divides among the three loads. When the switch is opened at 
=
t
0, all 
of the current in the line appears in the remaining resistive load because 
the inductive load current is 0 at 
=
t
0 and the inductor current cannot 
change instantaneously. Therefore, the voltage drop across the remain-
ing loads can experience a surge as the line current is directed through 
the resistive load.
For example, if the initial current in the line is 
(
)
25 A rms  and the 
impedance of the resistive load is 12 Ω, the voltage drop across the resis-
tor surges from 
.
169 7 V to 
=
(25)( 2)(12)
424.3 V when the switch is 
opened.  f the resistive load cannot handle this amount of voltage, it needs 
to be protected with a surge suppressor such as the one shown at the 
beginning of the chapter.

2  gives us 
δ t
50 ( ). Thus, the algebraic sum of the impul-
sive voltages around the mesh is zero.
To summarize, the Laplace transform will correctly predict the impul-
sive currents and voltages created by switching. However, the s-domain 
equivalent circuits must be based on initial conditions at 
=
−
t
0 , that 
is, on the initial conditions that exist prior to the switching. The Laplace 
transform will correctly predict the response to impulsive input sources by 
representing these sources in the s domain by their Laplace transforms.
SELF-CHECK: Assess your understanding of the impulse function in cir-
cuit analysis by trying Chapter Problems 13.89 and 13.93.

 
Summary

Summary
• We can represent each of the circuit elements as an 
s-domain equivalent circuit by Laplace-transforming 
the voltage-current equation for each element:
• Resistor: 
=
V
RI
• Inductor: 
=
−
V
sLI
LI 0
• Capacitor:

sC I

In these equations, 
{ }

,
L
 
{ }
= L
I
i , I 0 is the 
initial current through the inductor, and V0 is the initial 
voltage across the capacitor. (See pages 484–485.)
• Using Steps 1–4 in Analysis Method 13.1, we can trans-
form the  time-domain circuit into the s domain. Table 13.1 
summarizes the equivalent circuits for resistors, inductors, 
and capacitors in the s domain. (See page 486.)
• Solve the s-domain equivalent circuit in Analysis  Method 
13.1, Step 5, by writing algebraic equations using the 
circuit analysis techniques from resistive circuits. Step 6 
checks the resulting s-domain voltages and currents using 
the initial- and final-value theorems, where possible.  
Step 7 finds the partial fraction expansion for the s-domain 
voltages and currents, and uses Table  12.3 to find the 
inverse Laplace transforms. (See page 487.)
• Circuit analysis in the s domain is particularly advanta-
geous for solving transient response problems in linear 
lumped parameter circuits when initial conditions are 
known. It is also useful for problems involving multiple 
simultaneous mesh-current or node-voltage equations 
because it reduces problems to algebraic rather than 
differential equations. (See page 489.)
• The transfer function is the s-domain ratio of a circuit’s 
output to its input. It is defined as
=
H s
Y s
X s
( )
( )
( ),
where Y s
( ) is the Laplace transform of the output 
 signal, and X s
( ) is the Laplace transform of the input 
signal. (See page 500.)
• The partial fraction expansion of the product H s X s
( )
( ) 
yields a term for each pole of H s
( ) and X s
( ). The H s
( ) 
terms correspond to the transient component of the 
total response, while the X s
( ) terms correspond to the 
steady-state component. (See page 503.)
• If a circuit is driven by a unit impulse, 
δ
=
x t
t
( )
( ), then the 
response of the circuit equals the inverse Laplace trans-
form of the transfer function,

(See pages 504–505.)
• When a circuit is time-invariant, delaying the input by a 
seconds delays the output by a seconds. (See page 504.)
• The output of a circuit, y t( ), can be computed by con-
volving the input, x t( ), with the impulse response of the 
circuit, h t( ) :

A graphical interpretation of the convolution integral usu-
ally helps you to compute y t( ). (See pages 505 and 508.)
• We can use the transfer function of a circuit to compute 
its steady-state response to a sinusoidal source. To do so, 
make the substitution 
ω
=
s
j  in H s
( ) and represent 
the resulting complex number as a magnitude and phase 
angle. If

• Laplace transform analysis correctly predicts impulsive 
currents and voltages arising from switching and impul-
sive sources. You must ensure that the s-domain equiv-
alent circuits are based on initial conditions prior to the 
switching, that is, at 
=
−
t
0 . (See page 520.)

CHAPTER 
Introduction to Frequency-
Selective Circuits
Up to this point in our analysis of circuits with sinusoidal sources, 
the source frequency has been held constant. In this chapter, we 
analyze the effect of varying source frequency on circuit voltages 
and currents. The result of this analysis is the frequency response 
of a circuit.
We’ve seen in previous chapters that a circuit’s response 
depends on the types of elements in the circuit, the way the ele-
ments are connected, and the element impedances. Varying the 
frequency of a sinusoidal source does not change the element 
types or their connections, but it does change the capacitor and 
inductor impedances because these impedances are functions of 
frequency.
We can design circuits whose output signals reside within 
a desired frequency range, excluding all other frequen-
cies that appear in the circuit’s input. Such circuits are called 
 frequency- selective circuits. Many devices that communicate via 
electric signals, such as telephones, radios, televisions, and satel-
lites, employ frequency-selective circuits.
Frequency-selective circuits are also called filters because 
they filter out certain input signals on the basis of frequency. Note 
that no practical frequency-selective circuit can perfectly or com-
pletely filter out selected frequencies. Rather, filters attenuate— 
that is, weaken or lessen the effect of—any input signals with 
 frequencies outside the desired frequency band. For example, 
your home stereo system may have a graphic equalizer. Each band 
in the graphic equalizer is a filter that amplifies sounds  (audible 
frequencies) in the frequency range of the band and attenuates 
frequencies outside of that band. Thus, the graphic equalizer 
 enables you to change the sound volume in each frequency band.
We begin this chapter by analyzing circuits from each of the 
four major categories of filters: low pass, high pass, band pass, 
and band reject. The transfer function of a circuit is the starting 
point for the frequency response analysis. Pay close attention to 
the similarities among the transfer functions of circuits that per-
form the same filtering function. We will employ these similari-
ties when designing filter circuits in Chapter 15.

CHAPTER OBJECTIVES

Pushbutton Telephone Circuits
A pushbutton telephone produces tones that you hear 
when you press a button. You may have wondered about 
these tones. How are they used to tell the telephone sys-
tem which button was pushed? Why are tones used at 
all? Why do the tones sound musical? How does the 
phone system tell the difference between button tones 
and the normal sounds of people talking or singing?
The telephone system was designed to handle 
audio signals—those with frequencies between 300 Hz 
and 3 kHz. Thus, all signals from the system to the user 
have to be audible—including the dial tone and the busy 
signal. Similarly, all signals from the user to the system 
have to be audible, including the signal that the  user 
has pressed a button. It is important to distinguish but-
ton signals from the normal audio signal, so a dual- 
tone-multiple- frequency (DTMF) design is employed. When 
a number button is pressed, a unique pair of sinusoidal 
tones with very precise frequencies is sent by the phone 
to the telephone system. The DTMF frequency and timing 
specifications make it unlikely that a human voice could 
 produce the exact tone pairs, even if the person were try-
ing. In the central telephone facility, electric circuits moni-
tor the audio signal, listening for the tone pairs that signal a 
number. In the Practical Perspective example at the end of 
the chapter, we will examine the design of the DTMF filters 
used to determine which button has been pushed.

Introduction to Frequency-Selective Circuits
14.1 Some Preliminaries
Recall from Section 13.7 that a circuit’s transfer function provides an easy 
way to compute the steady-state response to a sinusoidal input. There, 
we considered only fixed-frequency sources. To study the frequency 
response of a circuit, we replace a fixed-frequency sinusoidal source with 
a varying-frequency sinusoidal source. The transfer function is still an 
immensely useful tool because the magnitude and phase of the output 
signal depend only on the magnitude and phase of the transfer function 
H j(
),
ω
 which vary as a function of the source frequency ω. Note that this 
method of analyzing the output of a circuit as its input frequency varies 
assumes that we can vary the input frequency without changing its mag-
nitude or phase angle.
To further simplify this first look at frequency-selective circuits, we 
will also restrict our attention to cases where both the input and out-
put signals are sinusoidal voltages, as illustrated in Fig. 14.1. Thus, the 
circuit’s transfer function will be the ratio of the Laplace transform 
of the output voltage to the Laplace transform of the input voltage, or 
=
H s
V
s
V s
( )
( )
( ).

i
 We should keep in mind, however, that for a partic-
ular application, a current may be either the input signal or output signal 
of interest.
The signals passed from the input to the output fall within a band 
of frequencies called the passband. Input voltages outside this band have 
their magnitudes attenuated by the circuit and are thus effectively pre-
vented from reaching the circuit’s output. Frequencies not in a circuit’s 
passband are in its stopband. Frequency-selective circuits are categorized 
by the location of the passband.
We can identify the type of frequency-selective circuit by examining 
its frequency response plot. A frequency response plot shows how a cir-
cuit’s transfer function (both amplitude and phase) changes as the source 
frequency changes. A frequency response plot has two parts.
• A graph of 
ω
H j(
)  versus frequency ω, called the magnitude plot.
• A graph of θ
ω
j(
) versus frequency ω, called the phase angle plot.
The ideal frequency response plots for the four major categories of fil-
ters are shown in Figs. 14.2 and 14.3. Figure 14.2 illustrates the ideal plots 
for a low-pass and a high-pass filter, respectively. Both filters have one 
passband and one stopband, which are defined by the cutoff frequency 
that separates them. The names low pass and high pass are derived from 
the magnitude plots: a low-pass filter passes signals at frequencies lower 
than the cutoff frequency from the input to the output, and a high-pass 
filter passes signals at frequencies higher than the cutoff frequency. Thus, 
the terms low and high as used here do not refer to any absolute val-
ues of frequency, but rather to relative values with respect to the cutoff 
frequency.
Note from the graphs for both these filters (as well as those for the 
bandpass and bandreject filters in Fig. 14.3) that the phase angle plot for 
an ideal filter varies linearly in the passband. It is of no interest outside the 
passband because there the magnitude is zero. Linear phase variation is 
necessary to avoid phase distortion.
The two remaining categories of filters each have two cutoff fre-
quencies. Figure  14.3(a) illustrates the ideal frequency response plot 
of a bandpass filter, which passes a source voltage to the output only 
when the source frequency is within the band defined by the two cut-
off frequencies. Figure  14.3(b) shows the ideal plot of a bandreject  
filter, which passes a source voltage to the output only when the source 
frequency is outside the band defined by the two cutoff frequencies.

The  bandreject filter thus rejects, or stops, the source voltage from 
reaching the output when its frequency is within the band defined by 
the cutoff frequencies.
In specifying a filter using any of the circuits from this chapter, it is 
important to note that the magnitude and phase angle characteristics are 
not independent. In other words, the characteristics of a circuit that result 
in a particular magnitude plot will also dictate the form of the phase angle 
plot and vice versa. For example, once we select a desired form for the 
magnitude response of a circuit, the phase angle response is also deter-
mined. Alternatively, if we select a desired form for the phase angle 
response, the magnitude response is also determined. Although there 
are some frequency-selective circuits for which the magnitude and phase 
angle behavior can be independently specified, these circuits are not pre-
sented here.
The next sections present examples of circuits from each of the four 
filter categories. These circuits represent only a few of the many circuits 
that act as filters. As you read, focus your attention on trying to identify 
what properties of a circuit determine its behavior as a filter. For exam-
ple, you should note the various forms of the transfer functions that per-
form the same filtering function. Identifying the form of a filter’s transfer 
function will ultimately help you in designing filter circuits for particular 
applications.
All of the filters in this chapter are passive filters because their behav-
ior depends only on passive elements: resistors, capacitors, and inductors. 
Usually, the largest output amplitude a passive filter can achieve equals 
the input amplitude. The only passive filter described in this chapter that 
can amplify its output is the series RLC resonant filter. Also, if you place 
an impedance in series with the source or in parallel with the load, the 
maximum output amplitude will decrease. Because many practical filter 
applications require amplification (a ratio of output-to-input amplitude 
greater than 1), passive filters have some significant disadvantages. Many 
active filter circuits, introduced in Chapter 15, provide amplification, and 
thereby overcome this passive filter disadvantage.
 14.2 Low-Pass Filters
Two circuits that behave as low-pass filters are the series RL circuit and 
the series RC circuit. Let’s investigate the circuit characteristics that affect 
the cutoff frequency.
The Series RL Circuit—Qualitative Analysis
A series RL circuit is shown in Fig. 14.4(a). The circuit’s input is a sinu-
soidal voltage source with varying frequency. The circuit’s output is the 
voltage across the resistor. Suppose the source frequency starts very low 
and increases gradually. We know that the behavior of the ideal resistor 
does not change because its impedance is independent of frequency. But 
consider how the behavior of the inductor changes.
Recall that the impedance of an inductor is ω
j L. At low frequen-
cies, the inductor’s impedance is very small compared with the resistor’s 
impedance, and the inductor effectively functions as a short circuit. The 
term low frequencies thus refers to any frequencies for which ωL
R
≪
. 
The equivalent circuit for ω = 0 is shown in Fig. 14.4(b). In this equiv-
alent circuit, the output voltage and the input voltage are equal both in 
magnitude and in phase angle.

Figure 14.5 ▲ The frequency response plot for the 
series RL circuit in Fig. 14.4(a).
As the frequency increases, the impedance of the inductor increases 
relative to that of the resistor. Increasing the inductor’s impedance causes 
a corresponding increase in the magnitude of the voltage drop across the 
inductor and a corresponding decrease in the output voltage magnitude. 
Increasing the inductor’s impedance also introduces a shift in phase angle 
between the inductor’s voltage and current, resulting in a phase angle dif-
ference between the input and output voltage. The output voltage always 
lags the input voltage, and as the frequency increases, this phase lag 
approaches 90°.
At high frequencies, the inductor’s impedance is very large compared 
with the resistor’s impedance, and the inductor thus functions as an open 
circuit, effectively blocking the flow of current in the circuit. The term 
high frequencies thus refers to any frequencies for which ωL
R
≫
. The 
equivalent circuit for ω = ∞ is shown in Fig. 14.4(c), where the output 
voltage magnitude is zero. The phase angle of the output voltage is 90° 
more negative than that of the input voltage, so the output lags the input 
by 90°.
Based on the behavior of the output voltage magnitude, this series RL 
circuit selectively passes low-frequency inputs to the output, and it blocks 
high-frequency inputs from reaching the output. The circuit’s response to 
varying input frequency is shown in Fig. 14.5, and these plots represent 
the frequency response of the series RL circuit in Fig. 14.4(a). The upper 
plot shows how 
ω
H j(
)  varies with frequency. The lower plot shows how 
θ
ω
j(
) varies with frequency. Appendix E presents a method for construct-
ing these plots.
We have also superimposed the ideal magnitude plot for a low-pass 
filter from Fig. 14.2(a) on the magnitude plot of the RL filter in Fig. 14.5 
(see the dashed line). There is an obvious difference between the magni-
tude plots of an ideal filter and an actual RL filter. The ideal filter exhibits 
a discontinuity in magnitude at the cutoff frequency, ω ,
c  which creates an 
abrupt transition between the passband and the stopband. While this is, 
ideally, how we would like our filters to perform, it is not possible to use 
real components to construct a circuit with an abrupt transition in mag-
nitude. Circuits acting as low-pass filters have a magnitude response that 
transitions gradually between the passband and the stopband. Hence, the 
magnitude plot of a real circuit requires us to define what we mean by the 
cutoff frequency, ω .
c
Defining the Cutoff Frequency
We need to define the cutoff frequency, ω ,
c  for realistic filter circuits 
because the magnitude plot does not allow us to identify a single fre-
quency that divides the passband and the stopband. The definition for 
cutoff  frequency widely used by electrical engineers is the frequency for 
which the transfer function magnitude is decreased by the factor 1
2  
from its maximum value:

where H max is the maximum magnitude of the transfer function. It follows 
from Eq. 14.1 that the passband of a filter is defined as the range of fre-
quencies for which the amplitude of the output voltage is at least 70.7% of 
the maximum possible amplitude.

 
14.2  ow-Pass Filters

Defining the cutoff frequency using the constant 1
2  is not an arbi-
trary choice. Examining another consequence of the cutoff frequency 
explains this choice. Recall from Section  10.5 that the average power 
delivered by any circuit to a load is proportional to V ,

amplitude of the voltage drop across the load:

If the circuit has a sinusoidal voltage source,

 then the load voltage 
is also a sinusoid, and its amplitude is a function of the frequency ω. We 
define Pmax as the value of the average power delivered to a load when the 
magnitude of the load voltage is maximum:

Now consider what happens to the average power when the frequency of

We see that, at the cutoff frequency ω ,
c  the average power delivered by 
the circuit is one half the maximum average power. Thus, ωc is also called 
the half-power frequency. In the filter’s passband, the average power 
delivered to a load is at least 50% of the maximum average power.

The Series RL Circuit—Quantitative Analysis
Now that we have defined the cutoff frequency for filter circuits, we can 
analyze the series RL circuit to find the relationship between the compo-
nent values and the cutoff frequency for this low-pass filter. We begin by 
constructing the s-domain equivalent of the circuit in Fig. 14.4(a), assum-
ing the initial conditions are zero. The resulting equivalent circuit is shown 
in Fig. 14.6. The voltage transfer function for this circuit is

Close examination of Eq. 14.4 provides the quantitative support for the 
magnitude plot shown in Fig. 14.5.
• When ω = 0, the denominator and the numerator are equal and 
=
H j( 0)
1. This means that at ω = 0, the input voltage is passed 
to the output terminals without a change in the voltage magnitude.
• As the frequency increases, the numerator of Eq. 14.4 is unchanged, 
but the denominator gets larger. Thus, 
ω
H j(
)  decreases as the fre-
quency increases, as shown in the plot in Fig. 14.5. Likewise, as the 
frequency increases, the phase angle changes from its dc value of 0°, 
becoming more negative.
• As ω →∞, the denominator of Eq. 14.4 approches infinity and 
ω
→
H j(

0, as seen in Fig.  14.5. As ω →∞
 
, the phase angle 
 approaches −90°, as seen from the phase angle plot in Fig. 14.5.
Using Eq. 14.4, we can compute the cutoff frequency, ω .

14.2  ow-Pass Filters 
543
Equation 14.5 provides an important result. The cutoff frequency, ω ,
c  
can be set to any desired value by appropriately selecting values for R and L. 
We can therefore design a low-pass filter with whatever cutoff frequency is 
needed. Example 14.1 demonstrates the design potential of Eq. 14.5.
 EXAMPLE 14.1     Designing a Low-Pass Filter
Electrocardiology is the study of the electric  signals 
produced by the heart. These signals maintain 
the heart’s rhythmic beat and are measured by an 
 instrument called an electrocardiograph. This instru-
ment must be capable of detecting periodic signals 
whose frequency is about 1 Hz (the normal heart 
rate is 72 beats per minute). The instrument must 
operate in the presence of sinusoidal noise consisting 
of signals from the surrounding electrical environ-
ment, whose fundamental frequency is 60 Hz—the 
frequency at which electric power is supplied.
Choose values for R and L in the circuit of 
Fig.  14.4(a) such that the resulting circuit could 
be used in an electrocardiograph to filter out any 
noise above 10  Hz and pass the electric signals 
from the heart at or near 1 Hz. Then compute the 
magnitude of Vo at 1 Hz, 10 Hz, and 60 Hz to see 
how well the filter performs.
Solution
The problem is to select values for R and L that 
yield a low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 
10 Hz. From Eq. 14.5, we see that R and L cannot 
be specified independently to generate a value for 
ω .
c  Therefore, let’s choose a commonly available 
value of L, 100 mH. Before we use Eq. 14.5 to com-
pute the value of R needed to obtain the desired 
cutoff frequency, we need to convert the cutoff fre-
quency from hertz to radians per second:
ω
π
π
=
=
2 (10)
20   rad s.

Now, solve for the value of R that, together with 
=
L
100 mH, will yield a low-pass filter, with a 
cutoff frequency of 10 Hz:

Table  14.1 summarizes the computed magnitude 
values for the frequencies 1 Hz, 10 Hz, and 60 Hz. 
As expected, the input and output voltages have 
the same magnitudes at the low frequency because 
the circuit is a low-pass filter. At the cutoff fre-
quency, the output voltage magnitude has been 
reduced by 1
2  from the unity passband magni-
tude. At 60 Hz, the output voltage magnitude has 
been reduced by a factor of about 6, achieving the 
desired attenuation of the noise that could corrupt 
the signal the electrocardiograph is designed to 
measure.
A Series RC Circuit
The series RC circuit shown in Fig. 14.7 also behaves as a low-pass fil-
ter. We can verify this via the same qualitative analysis used previously. 
In fact, such a qualitative examination is an important problem-solving 
step that you should get in the habit of performing when analyzing filters. 
Doing so enables you to predict the filtering characteristics (low pass, high 
pass, etc.) and thus also predict the general form of the transfer function. 
If the calculated transfer function matches the qualitatively predicted 
form, you have an important accuracy check.

EXAMPLE 14.2     Designing a Series RC Low-Pass Filter
For the series RC circuit in Fig. 14.7:
a) Find the transfer function between the source 
voltage and the output voltage.
b) Determine an equation for the cutoff frequency 
in the series RC circuit.
c) Choose values for R and C that will yield a low-
pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 3 kHz.
Solution
a) To derive an expression for the transfer function, 
we first construct the s-domain equivalent of the 
circuit in Fig.  14.7, as shown in Fig.  14.8. Using 
s-domain voltage division on the equivalent cir-
cuit, we find

 Given a choice, we will usually specify a 
value for C first, rather than for R, because the num-
ber of available capacitor values is much smaller than 
the number of resistor values. Remember that we have

Note that the circuit’s output is defined as the voltage across the 
capacitor. We again use three frequency regions to determine how the 
series RC circuit in Fig. 14.7 behaves:
• Zero frequency (ω = 0): The impedance of the capacitor is infinite, 
and the capacitor acts as an open circuit. The input and output volt-
ages are thus the same.
• Frequencies increasing from zero: The impedance of the capacitor 
decreases relative to the impedance of the resistor, and the source 
voltage divides between the resistive impedance and the capacitive 
impedance. The output voltage is thus smaller than the source voltage.
• Infinite frequency (ω = ∞): The impedance of the capacitor is zero, 
and the capacitor acts as a short circuit. The output voltage is thus zero.
Based on this analysis, the series RC circuit functions as a low-pass filter. 
Example 14.2 explores this circuit quantitatively.

 
14.3 High-Pass Filters 
545
Figure 14.9 summarizes the two low-pass filter circuits we have ana-
lyzed. Look carefully at the transfer functions and notice their similar 
form—they differ only in the terms that specify the cutoff frequency. We 
can therefore identify a general form for the transfer functions of these 
two low-pass filters:

(14.6)
Any circuit with a voltage ratio described by Eq. 14.6 would behave as a 
low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of ω .
c  The problems at the end of 
the chapter give you other examples of circuits with this voltage ratio.
Relating the Frequency Domain to the Time Domain
Finally, you might have noticed one other important relationship. Recall 
our discussion of the natural responses of the first-order RL and RC cir-
cuits in Chapter 7. An important parameter for these circuits is the time 
constant, τ, which characterizes the shape of the time response. For the 
RL circuit, the time constant has the value L R (Eq. 7.3); for the RC cir-
cuit, the time constant is RC (Eq. 7.8). Compare the time constants to the 
cutoff frequencies for these circuits and notice that
 
τ
ω
= 1
.
c  
(14.7)
This result is a direct consequence of the relationship between the 
time response of a circuit and its frequency response, as revealed by the 
Laplace transform. The discussion of memory and weighting as repre-
sented in the convolution integral of Section 13.6 shows that as ω →∞,
c
 
the filter has no memory, and the output approaches a scaled replica of the 
input; that is, no filtering has occurred. As ω →0,
c
 the filter has increased 
memory, and the output voltage is a distortion of the input because filter-
ing has occurred.

14.3 High-Pass Filters
Now we examine two circuits that function as high-pass filters. Once 
again, they are the series RL circuit and the series RC circuit. We will see 
that the same series circuit can act as either a low-pass or a high-pass filter, 
depending on where the output voltage is defined. We will also determine

The Series RC Circuit—Qualitative Analysis
A series RC circuit is shown in Fig. 14.10(a). In contrast to its low-pass 
counterpart in Fig. 14.7, the output voltage here is defined across the resis-
tor, not the capacitor. Because of this, the effect of the changing capaci-
tive impedance is different than it was in the low-pass configuration.
At ω = 0, the capacitor behaves like an open circuit, so there is 
no current in the resistor. This is illustrated in the equivalent circuit in 
Fig. 14.10(b). In this circuit, there is no voltage across the resistor and 
=
v
0.
o
 The circuit filters out the low-frequency input voltage before it 
reaches the circuit’s output.
As the frequency of the voltage source increases, the impedance of 
the capacitor decreases relative to the impedance of the resistor, and the 
source voltage is now divided between the capacitor and the resistor. The 
output voltage magnitude thus begins to increase.
When the frequency of the source is infinite (ω = ∞), the capacitor 
behaves as a short circuit, so the capacitor voltage is zero. This is illus-
trated in the equivalent circuit in Fig. 14.10(c). In this circuit, the input 
and output voltages are the same.
The phase angle difference between the input and output voltages 
also varies as the frequency of the source changes. For ω = ∞, the out-
put voltage is the same as the input voltage, so the phase angle difference 
is zero. As the frequency of the source decreases and the impedance of 
the capacitor increases, a phase shift is introduced between the voltage 
and the current in the capacitor. This creates a phase difference between 
the input and output voltages. The phase angle of the output voltage 
leads that of the source voltage. When ω = 0, this phase angle difference 
reaches its maximum of 
90°.
+
Based on our qualitative analysis, we see that when the output is 
 defined as the voltage across the resistor, the series RC circuit behaves 
as a high-pass filter. The components and connections are identical to the 
low-pass series RC circuit, but the choice of output is different. Thus, we 
have confirmed the earlier observation that the filtering characteristics of 
a circuit depend on the definition of the output as well as on circuit com-
ponents, values, and connections.
Figure  14.11 shows the frequency response plot for the series RC 
high-pass filter. For reference, the dashed lines indicate the magnitude 
plot for an ideal high-pass filter. We now turn to a quantitative analysis of 
this same circuit.

a low-pass filter in Fig. 14.7 or as a high-pass filter in Fig. 14.10(a). This 
is not a surprising result, as we have already discovered a connection 
between the cutoff frequency, ωc, and the time constant, τ, of a circuit.
Example 14.3 analyzes a series RL circuit, this time configured as a 
high-pass filter. Example 14.4 examines the effect of adding a load resistor 
at the output of the filter.
 EXAMPLE 14.3     Designing a Series RL High-Pass Filter
Show that the series RL circuit in Fig.  14.13 also 
acts like a high-pass filter:
a) Derive an expression for the circuit’s transfer 
function.
b) Use the result from (a) to determine an equation 
for the cutoff frequency in the series RL circuit.
c) Choose values for R and L that will yield a high-
pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 15 kHz.

the output voltage amplitude of a passive high-pass filter is maximum, it 
equals the amplitude of the filter’s input voltage. Placing a load across the 
filter, as we did in Example 14.4, decreases the output voltage amplitude. 
If we need to amplify signals in the passband, we must turn to active fil-
ters, such as those discussed in Chapter 15.
The effect of a load on a filter’s transfer function poses another 
dilemma in circuit design. We typically begin with a transfer function 
specification and then design a filter to meet that specification. We may 
or may not know what the load on the filter will be. Ideally, we want the 
filter’s transfer function to remain the same regardless of the load on it, 
but this is not possible for the passive filters presented here.
Figure  14.18 summarizes the high-pass filter circuits we have ana-
lyzed. Looking at the expressions for H(s), we see that they differ only in 
the denominator, which includes the cutoff frequency. As we did with the 
low-pass filters in Eq. 14.6, we state a general form for the transfer func-
tion of these two high-pass filters:

Any circuit with a voltage ratio described by Eq. 14.10 would behave 
as a high-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of ω .
c  The problems at the 
end of the chapter give you other examples of circuits with this voltage 
ratio.
We have drawn attention to another important relationship. We have 
discovered that a series RC circuit has the same cutoff frequency whether 
it is configured as a low-pass filter or as a high-pass filter. The same is 
true of a series RL circuit. Given the connection between the cutoff fre-
quency of a filter circuit and its time constant, we should expect the cut-
off frequency to be a characteristic parameter of the circuit whose value 
depends only on the circuit components, their values, and the way they 
are connected.

14.4 Bandpass Filters
The next filters we examine are those that pass voltages within a band 
of frequencies to the output while filtering out voltages at frequencies 
 outside this band. These filters are somewhat more complicated than the 
low-pass and high-pass filters of the previous sections. As we have already 
seen in Fig. 14.3(a), ideal bandpass filters have two cutoff frequencies, ωc1 
and ω ,
c2  which identify the passband. For realistic bandpass filters, these 
cutoff frequencies are again defined as the frequencies for which the mag-
nitude of the transfer function equals 
H

.
max
Center Frequency, Bandwidth, and Quality Factor
Besides the cutoff frequencies ωc1 and ω ,
c2  three other important param-
eters characterize a bandpass filter. The first is the center frequency, ω ,
o  
defined as the frequency for which a circuit’s transfer function is purely 
real. Another name for the center frequency is the resonant frequency. 
This is the same name given to the frequency that characterizes the nat-
ural response of the second-order circuits in Chapter 8 because they are 
the same frequencies! When a circuit is driven at the resonant frequency, 
we say that the circuit is in resonance because the frequency of the forcing 
function is the same as the natural frequency of the circuit. The center 
frequency is the geometric center of the passband; that is, ω
ω ω
=
.
o
c
c

2  
For bandpass filters, the magnitude of the transfer function is maximum at 
the center frequency (
ω
=
H
H j(
)
o
max
).
The second parameter is the bandwidth, β, which is the width of the 
passband. The final parameter is the quality factor Q, which is the ratio of 
the center frequency to the bandwidth. The quality factor describes the 
width of the passband, independent of its location on the frequency axis. It 
also describes the shape of the magnitude plot, independent of frequency.
Although five different parameters characterize bandpass filters—ω ,
c1   
ω ,
c2  ω ,
o  β, and Q—only two of the five can be specified independently. 
That is, once we specify any two of these parameter values, the other 
three can be calculated from the dependent relationships among them. 
We explore these relationships next, as we derive expressions for the five 
characteristic parameters in terms of the component values for two RLC 
circuits that act as bandpass filters.

The Series RLC Circuit—Qualitative Analysis
Figure  14.19(a) depicts a series RLC circuit. We want to consider the 
effect of changing the source frequency on the magnitude of the output 
voltage. As before, changes to the source frequency result in changes to 
the impedance of the capacitor and the inductor. This time, the qualitative 
analysis is somewhat more complicated because the circuit has both an 
inductor and a capacitor.
At ω = 0, the capacitor behaves like an open circuit, and the inductor 
behaves like a short circuit. The equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. 14.19(b). 
The open circuit representing the capacitor impedance prevents current 
from reaching the resistor, and the resulting output voltage is zero.
At ω = ∞, the capacitor behaves like a short circuit, and the induc-
tor behaves like an open circuit. The equivalent circuit is shown in 
Fig. 14.19(c). The inductor now prevents current from reaching the resis-
tor, and again the output voltage is zero.
But what happens in the frequency region between ω = 0 and 
ω = ∞? Between these two extremes, both the capacitor and the inductor 
have finite impedances. In this region, the source voltage divides among 
the capacitor, inductor, and resistor. Remember that the capacitor imped-
ance is negative, whereas the inductor impedance is positive. Thus, at some 
frequency, the capacitor impedance and the inductor impedance have 
equal magnitudes and opposite signs; the two impedances cancel out, so 
the output voltage equals the source voltage. This special frequency is the 
center frequency, ω .
o  On either side of ω ,
o  the output voltage is less than 
the source voltage. Note that at ω ,
o  the series combination of the inductor 
and capacitor behaves like a short circuit.
The frequency response plot for the circuit in Fig. 14.19(a) is shown 
in Fig. 14.20. The ideal bandpass filter magnitude plot is overlaid (as a 
dashed line) on the transfer function magnitude plot for comparison.
Now consider what happens to the transfer function phase angle. At 
the center frequency, ωo, the phase angles of the input and output volt-
ages are equal, so the phase angle of the transfer function is zero. As the 
frequency decreases, the capacitor phase angle is larger than the induc-
tor phase angle. Because the capacitor contributes positive phase shift, 
the transfer function phase angle is positive. At very low frequencies, the 
transfer function phase angle is 
90°.
+
Conversely, if the frequency increases from the center frequency, the 
inductor phase angle is larger than the capacitor phase angle. The induc-
tor contributes negative phase shift, so the transfer function phase angle 
is negative. At very high frequencies, the transfer function phase angle is 
90°.
−
 The plot of the transfer function phase angle is shown in Fig. 14.20.
The Series RLC Circuit—Quantitative Analysis

Introduction to Frequency-Selective Circuits
We now have five parameters that characterize the series RLC  
bandpass filter: two cutoff frequencies, ωc1 and ω ,
c2  which delimit the 
passband; the center frequency, ω ,
o  at which the magnitude of the transfer 
function is maximum; the bandwidth, β, a measure of the width of the 
passband; and the quality factor, Q, a second measure of passband width. 
Remember, only two of these parameters can be specified independently 
in a design. We have already observed that the quality factor is the ratio 
of the center frequency to the bandwidth. We can also rewrite the equa-
tions for the cutoff frequencies in terms of the center frequency and the 
bandwidth:

EXAMPLE 14.5     Designing a Bandpass Filter
A graphic equalizer is an audio amplifier that allows 
you to select different levels of amplification within 
different frequency regions. Using the series RLC 
circuit in Fig. 14.19(a), choose values for R, L, and 
C that yield a bandpass circuit able to select inputs 
within the 1 kHz–10 kHz frequency band. Such a 
circuit might be used in a graphic equalizer to select 
this frequency band from the larger audio band 
(generally 0–20 kHz) prior to amplification.
Solution
We need to compute values for R, L, and C that 
produce a bandpass filter with cutoff frequencies 
of 1 kHz and 10 kHz. There are many possible 
 approaches to a solution. For instance, we could use 
Eqs. 14.14 and 14.15, which specify ωc1 and ωc2 in 
terms of R, L, and C. Because of the form of these 
equations, the algebraic manipulations might get 
complicated. Instead, we will calculate the center 
frequency, 
,
o
ω
 from the cutoff frequencies and then 
use Eq. 14.13 to compute L and C from 
.
o
ω
 Next 
we will calculate the bandwidth, β, from the cutoff 
frequencies and finally, use Eq. 14.16 to compute R 
from β. While this approach involves several com-
putational steps, each calculation is fairly simple.
Any approach we choose will provide only 
two equations—insufficient to solve for the three 
unknowns—because of the dependencies among 
the bandpass filter characteristics. Thus, we need to 
select a value for either R, L, or C and use the two 
equations we’ve chosen to calculate the remain-
ing component values. Here, we arbitrarily choose 
µ
1  F  as the capacitor value.
We compute the center frequency as the geo-
metric mean of the cutoff frequencies:

To check whether these component values pro-

c1
ω
= 62,831.85  rad s  (10,000 Hz),

which are the cutoff frequencies specified for the 
filter.
This example reminds us that only two of the 
five bandpass filter parameters can be specified 
independently. The other three parameters can be 
computed from the two that are specified. In turn, 
these five parameter values depend on the three 
component values, R, L, and C, of which only 
two can be specified independently. It is almost 
always easiest to calculate the center frequency and  
bandwidth from whatever two parameters are spec-
ified, and then use Eqs. 14.13 and 14.16 to calculate 
the two unknown component values.
EXAMPLE 14.6     Designing a Parallel RLC Bandpass Filter
a) Show that the RLC circuit in Fig. 14.22 is also a 
bandpass filter by deriving an expression for the 
transfer function H s
( ). Note that this circuit is a 
parallel RLC circuit with the parallel-connected 
current source and resistor source-transformed to 
a series-connected voltage source and resistor. This 
permits us to continue defining the filter transfer 
functions as ratios of output to input voltages.

EXAMPLE 14.7      Determining the Effect of a Nonideal Voltage Source  
on a Series RLC Bandpass Filter
For each of the filters we have constructed, we 
have always assumed an ideal voltage source, that 
is, a voltage source with no series resistance. When 
we design with a filter using values of R, L, and C 
whose equivalent impedance has a magnitude close 
to the actual impedance of the voltage source, it is 
not valid to assume the voltage source is ideal. In 
this example, we determine the effect of the non-
zero source resistance Ri on the series RLC band-
pass filter characteristics.

• The bandwidth for the filter with

 Thus, the cutoff frequencies and the quality fac-
tors for the two circuits are also different.
Adding a nonzero source resistance to a series RLC bandpass filter leaves 
the center frequency unchanged but widens the passband and reduces the 
passband magnitude.

Figure 14.27 ▲ Two RLC bandpass filters, together 
with equations for the transfer function, center fre-
quency, and bandwidth of each.
Here we see the same design challenge we saw when adding a load 
resistor to the high-pass filter. We would like to design bandpass filters 
with filtering properties that are unchanged by the internal resistance 
of the voltage source. Unfortunately, this is not possible for filters con-
structed from passive elements. In Chapter 15, we will discover that active 
filters are insensitive to changes in source resistance and thus are better 
suited to designs in which this is an important issue.
Figure 14.27 summarizes the two RLC bandpass filters we have stud-
ied. Note that the expressions for the circuit transfer functions have the 
same form. As we have done previously, we can create a general form for 
the transfer functions of these two bandpass filters:

in the form

where the values for K and β depend on whether the series resistance of

Relating the Frequency Domain to the Time Domain
It should come as no surprise that the parameters characterizing the fre-
quency response of RLC bandpass filters and the parameters characterizing 
the time response of RLC circuits are related. Consider the series RLC cir-
cuit in Fig. 14.19(a). In Chapter 8 we discovered that the natural response 
of this circuit is characterized by the neper frequency α
( ) and the resonant 
frequency ω
(

components in Eqs. 8.29 and 8.30, which are repeated here for convenience:
 α =

We see that the same parameter ωo is used to characterize both the time 
response and the frequency response. That’s why the center frequency 
is also called the resonant frequency. The bandwidth and the neper fre-
quency are related by the equation

 14.5 Bandreject Filters
We turn now to the last of the four filter categories—the bandreject filter. 
This filter passes source voltages outside the band between the two cutoff 
frequencies to the output (the passband) and attenuates source voltages 
before they reach the output at frequencies between the two cutoff fre-
quencies (the stopband). Bandpass filters and bandreject filters thus per-
form complementary functions in the frequency domain.
Bandreject filters and bandpass filters have the same characteristic 
parameters: the two cutoff frequencies, the center frequency, the band-
width, and the quality factor. Again, only two of these five parameters can 
be specified independently.
We examine two circuits that function as bandreject filters and then 
derive equations relating the circuit component values to the characteris-
tic parameters for each circuit.
The Series RLC Circuit—Qualitative Analysis
Figure 14.28(a) shows a series RLC circuit. Although the circuit compo-
nents and connections are identical to those in the series RLC bandpass 
filter in Fig. 14.19(a), the output voltage is now defined across the inductor- 
capacitor pair. As we saw in the case of low- and high-pass filters, the 
same circuit may perform two different filtering functions, depending on 
the definition of the output voltage.
We have already noted that at ω = 0, the inductor behaves like a 
short circuit and the capacitor behaves like an open circuit, as shown in 
Fig. 14.28(b). At ω = ∞, these roles switch, as shown in Fig. 14.28(c). 
In both equivalent circuits, the output voltage is defined across an open 
circuit, so the output and input voltages have the same magnitude. This 
series RLC bandreject filter circuit then has two passbands—one below 
the lower cutoff frequency and the other above the upper cutoff frequency.

 
14.5 Bandreject Filters 
561
Between these two passbands, both the inductor and the capacitor 
have finite impedances of opposite signs. As the frequency is increased 
from zero, the inductor impedance increases and the capacitor impedance 
decreases. Therefore, the phase shift between the input and the output 
approaches −90° as ωL approaches 
C
1
.
ω
 As soon as ωL exceeds 
C
1
,
ω
 
the phase shift jumps to +90° and then approaches zero as ω  continues 
to increase.
At some frequency between the two passbands, the impedances of 
the inductor and capacitor are equal but have opposite signs, so their sum 
is zero. Thus, at this frequency, the series combination of the inductor 
and capacitor acts like a short circuit, and the output voltage magnitude is 
zero. This is the center frequency of the series RLC bandreject filter.
Figure 14.29 presents a sketch of the frequency response for the series 
RLC bandreject filter from Fig. 14.28(a). Note that the magnitude plot 
is overlaid with that of the ideal bandreject filter from Fig. 14.3(b). Our 
qualitative analysis has confirmed the shape of the magnitude and phase 
angle plots. We now turn to a quantitative analysis of the circuit to con-
firm this frequency response and to compute values for the parameters 
that characterize this response.

Note that the equations for the transfer function magnitude and phase

we developed from the qualitative analysis.
We use the circuit in Fig. 14.30 to calculate the center frequency. For 
the bandreject filter, the center frequency is still defined as the frequency 
for which the sum of the impedances of the capacitor and inductor is zero. 
In the bandpass filter, the magnitude at the center frequency was a max-
imum, but in the bandreject filter, this magnitude is a minimum. This is 
because in the bandreject filter, the center frequency is in the stopband, 
not in the passband. Because the sum of the capacitor and inductor imped-
ances is zero at the center frequency,

As you might suspect by now, another configuration that produces a

RLC circuit are left to Problem 14.35, and the results are summarized in 
Fig. 14.31, along with the series RLC bandreject filter. As we did for other 
categories of filters, we can state a general form for the transfer functions of 
bandreject filters, replacing the constant terms with β and ωo:

In the Practical Perspective at the start of this chapter, we described 
the dual-tone-multiple-frequency (DTMF) system used to signal that a 
button has been pushed on a pushbutton telephone. A key element of 
the DTMF system is the DTMF receiver—a circuit that decodes the tones 
produced by pushing a button and determines which button was pushed.
In order to design a DTMF receiver, we need a better understanding 
of the DTMF system. As you can see from Fig. 14.32, the buttons on the 
telephone are organized into rows and columns. The pair of tones gener-
ated by pushing a button depends on the button’s row and column. The 
button’s row determines its low-frequency tone, and the button’s column 
determines its high-frequency tone.1 For example, pressing the “6”  button 
produces sinusoidal tones with the frequencies 770 Hz and 1477 Hz.
At the telephone switching facility, bandpass filters in the DTMF 
receiver first detect whether tones from both the low-frequency and 
high-frequency groups are simultaneously present. This test rejects 
many extraneous audio signals that are not DTMF. If tones are present in 
both bands, other filters are used to select among the possible tones in 
each band so that the frequencies can be decoded, identifying a unique 
button. Additional tests are performed to prevent false button detection. 
For example, only one tone per frequency band is allowed; the high and 
low-band frequencies must start and stop within a few milliseconds of 
one another to be considered valid; and the high- and low-band signal 
amplitudes must be sufficiently close to each other.
You may wonder why bandpass filters are used instead of a  
high-pass filter for the high-frequency group of DTMF tones and a 
lowpass filter for the low-frequency group of DTMF tones. The reason 
is that the telephone system uses frequencies outside of the band 
from 300 Hz to 3 kHz for other signaling purposes, such as ringing 
the phone’s bell. Bandpass filters prevent the DTMF receiver from 
erroneously detecting these other signals.
SELF-CHECK: Assess your understanding of this Practical Perspective 
by trying Chapter Problems 14.51–14.53.
1 A fourth high-frequency tone is reserved at 1633 Hz. This tone is used infrequently and is not produced by a standard 12-button telephone.
Summary
• A frequency-selective circuit, or filter, enables signals at 
certain frequencies to reach the output, and it attenuates 
signals at other frequencies to prevent them from reach-
ing the output. The passband contains the  frequencies 
of those signals that are passed; the  stopband contains 
the frequencies of those signals that are attenuated. 
(See page 538.)

• Adding a load to the output of a passive fil-

again by altering the location and magnitude of 
the passband. (See pages 548 and 557.)

CHAPTER 
Active Filter Circuits
Active filter circuits, which employ op amps, can be config-
ured as low-pass filters, high-pass filters, bandpass filters, and 
bandreject filters, just like the passive circuits we analyzed in 
Chapter  14. Active filter circuits have several advantages over 
their passive counterparts.
• Active circuits can produce bandpass and bandreject filters  
without using inductors. This is advantageous because 
inductors are usually large, heavy, and costly, and they can 
introduce electromagnetic field effects that compromise the 
desired frequency response characteristics.
• Active filters provide control over passband amplification 
that is not available in passive filter circuits. Examine the 
transfer functions of all the filter circuits from Chapter 14 
and you will notice that the maximum magnitude does not 
exceed 1. This is not surprising, since most of the transfer 
functions in Chapter 14 were derived using voltage division. 
Active filters permit us to specify both the filtering char-
acteristics and a passband gain, an advantage over passive 
filters.
• Active filters can have resistive loads at their outputs whose 
presence does not alter the filter characteristics due to the 
properties of ideal op amps. This is another advantage of 
active filters, as both the cutoff frequency and the passband 
magnitude of passive filters can change when a resistive 
load is added at the output.
Thus, we can implement filter designs using active circuits when 
physical size, passband amplification, and load variation are 
important parameters in the design specifications.
In this chapter, we analyze a few of the many filter cir-
cuits that use op amps. You will see how these op amp circuits  
overcome the disadvantages of passive filter circuits. We will also 
combine basic op amp filter circuits to achieve specific frequency 
responses and to attain a more nearly ideal filter response. 
Note that throughout this chapter we assume that every op amp 
behaves as an ideal op amp.

CHAPTER OBJECTIVES

Practical Perspective
Bass Volume Control
The circuits we analyze in this chapter are frequency 
 selective, which means that the circuit’s behavior depends 
on its sinusoidal input frequency. These filter circuits play 
important roles in many audioelectronic applications.
Audioelectronic systems such as radios and home 
stereo systems often provide separate volume controls 
labeled “treble” and “bass.” These controls allow you to 
set the volume of high-frequency audio signals (“treble”) 
and the volume of low-frequency audio signals (“bass”) 
independently. Adjusting the amplification (boost) or 
attenuation (cut) in these two frequency bands allows you 
to customize the sound with more precision than you get 
using a single volume control.
The Practical Perspective example at the end of this 
chapter presents a bass volume control circuit composed 
of a single op amp together with resistors and capaci-
tors. An adjustable resistor controls the amplification in 
the bass frequency range.

15.1  First-Order Low-Pass  
and High-Pass Filters
Consider the circuit in Fig. 15.1. When the frequency of the source is var-
ied, only the impedance of the capacitor is affected. At very low frequen-
cies, the capacitor acts like an open circuit, and the op amp circuit acts like 
an inverting amplifier with a gain of −R
R .
2
1  At very high frequencies, 
the capacitor acts like a short circuit that connects the op amp’s output to 
ground. The op amp circuit in Fig. 15.1 thus functions as a low-pass filter 
with a passband gain of −R
R .

1  The op amp low-pass filter thus permits 
the passband gain and the cutoff frequency to be specified independently.
 A Note about Frequency Response Plots
Frequency response plots, introduced in Chapter  14, provide valuable 
insight into the way a filter circuit functions. Thus, we make extensive use 
of frequency response plots in this chapter, too. The frequency response 
plots in Chapter 14 have two components—a plot of the transfer func-
tion magnitude versus frequency and a plot of the transfer function phase 
angle, in degrees, versus frequency. The two plots are usually stacked on 
top of one another so that they can share the same frequency axis.
In this chapter, we use a special type of frequency response plot called 
the Bode plot. Bode plots are discussed in detail in Appendix E, which 
includes information about how to construct these plots by hand. You will 
probably use a computer to construct Bode plots, so here we summarize 
their special features. Bode plots differ from the frequency response plots 
in Chapter 14 in two important ways.
• A Bode plot uses a logarithmic axis for the frequency values instead 
of a linear axis. This permits us to plot a wider range of frequencies of 
interest. Normally, we plot three or four decades of frequencies, say from 
10
rad s
2
 to 10
rad s
6
, or 1 kHz to 1 MHz, choosing the frequency 
range where the transfer function characteristics are changing. If we plot 
both the magnitude and phase angle plots, they share the frequency axis.

• The Bode magnitude is plotted in decibels (dB) versus the log of the 
frequency, instead of plotting the absolute magnitude versus linear 
frequency. The decibel is discussed in Appendix D. Briefly, if the mag-

Recall that at a filter’s cutoff frequency the transfer function’s magni-
tude has been reduced from its maximum value by 1
2. Translating this 
definition to magnitude in dB, we find that a transfer function’s magnitude 
at its cutoff frequency has been reduced from its maximum magnitude by 3 
dB. For example, if the magnitude of a low-pass filter in its passband is 26 
dB, the magnitude used to find the cutoff frequency is 26

23 dB.

Example 15.1 illustrates the design of a first-order low-pass filter to 
meet desired specifications of passband gain and cutoff frequency; it also 
illustrates a Bode magnitude plot of the filter’s transfer function.
EXAMPLE 15.1     Designing a Low-Pass Op Amp Filter
Using the circuit shown in Fig. 15.1, calculate values 
for C and R2 that, together with R
1  ,
1 =
Ω produce 
a low-pass filter having a gain of 1 in the passband 
and a cutoff frequency of 1  rad s. Find the transfer 
function for this filter and use it to sketch a Bode 
magnitude plot of the filter’s frequency response.

Equation 15.2 gives the passband gain in terms of 
R1 and R ,

As we shall see in the next section, prototype fil-
ters provide a useful starting point for the design of 
filters that use more realistic component values to 
achieve a desired frequency response.

Figure 15.4 ▲ A first-order high-pass filter.
You may have recognized the circuit in Fig. 15.1 as the integrating 
amplifier circuit introduced in Chapter 7. They are indeed the same cir-
cuit, so integrating in the time domain corresponds to low-pass filtering in 
the frequency domain. This relationship between integration and low-pass 
filtering is also evident from the operational Laplace transform for inte-
gration derived in Chapter 12.
The circuit in Fig. 15.4 is an active first-order high-pass filter. This 
circuit also has the general form of the circuit in Fig. 15.2, only now the 
impedance in the input path is the series combination of R1 and 
sC
1
, and 
the impedance in the feedback path is the resistor R .

The form of the transfer function given in Eq. 15.4 is the same as that in 
Eq. 14.10, the equation for passive high-pass filters. Again, the active filter 
can have a passband gain greater than 1.
Example 15.2 designs an active high-pass filter that must meet fre-
quency response specifications from a Bode plot.
EXAMPLE 15.2     Designing a High-Pass Op Amp Filter
Figure  15.5 shows the Bode magnitude plot of a 
high-pass filter. Using the active high-pass filter cir-
cuit in Fig. 15.4, calculate values of R1 and R2 that 
produce the desired magnitude response. Use a 
0.1  F
μ
 capacitor. If a 10 kΩ load resistor is added to 
this filter, how will the magnitude response change?
 Solution
Begin by writing a transfer function that has the 
magnitude plot shown in Fig. 15.5. To do this, note 
that the gain in the passband is 20 dB; therefore, 
=
K
10. Also note that the 3 dB point is 500 rad/s,  
which must be the filter’s cutoff frequency. 
Equation 15.4 is the transfer function for a high-
pass filter, so the transfer function that has the mag-
nitude response shown in Fig. 15.5 is given by

Because we have made the assumption that the 
op amp is ideal, adding any load resistor, regardless of 
its resistance, has no effect on the filter circuit. Thus, 
the magnitude response of a high-pass filter with a 
load resistor is the same as that of a high-pass filter 
with no load resistor, which is depicted in Fig. 15.5.

simple. Unfortunately, these values are unrealistic for specifying practical 
components, and they result in filters with undesirable characteristics, like 
a cutoff frequency of 1 rad/s. But we can use scaling to transform the con-
venient component values into realistic values and transform undesirable 
filter characteristics into desirable ones. There are two types of scaling: 
magnitude and frequency.
Magnitude Scaling
We scale a circuit in magnitude by multiplying the impedance at a given 
frequency by the scale factor k .
m  Thus, we multiply all resistors and induc-
tors by km  and all capacitors by 
k
1
.
m  If we let unprimed variables rep-
resent the initial values of the parameters, and we let primed variables 
represent the scaled values of the variables, we have

Note that km is by definition a positive real number that can be either less 
than or greater than 1.
Frequency Scaling
We scale a circuit in frequency by changing the circuit’s component values 
so that at the new frequency, the impedance of each element is the same 
as it was at the original frequency. Because resistive impedance is inde-
pendent of frequency, resistors are unaffected by frequency scaling. If we 
let k f denote the frequency scale factor, inductor and capacitor values are 
both multiplied by

The Use of Scaling in the Design of Filters
When designing filters, follow these steps to use scaling:
• Select the cutoff frequency, ω ,
c  to be 1  rad s (if you are designing 
low- or high-pass filters), or select the center frequency, ω ,
o  to be 
1  rad s (if you are designing bandpass or bandreject filters).
• Select a 1 F capacitor and calculate the values of the resistors needed 
to give the desired passband gain (if you are designing an active fil-
ter) and the 1  rad s cutoff or center frequency.
• Use scaling to compute more realistic component values that give the 
desired cutoff or center frequency.
Example 15.3 illustrates the scaling process in general, and Example 15.4 
illustrates the use of scaling in the design of a low-pass filter.
EXAMPLE 15.3     Scaling a Series RLC Filter
The passive series RLC filter shown in Fig. 15.7 has 
a center frequency of 
=
LC
1
1  rad s, a band-
width of 
=
R L
1  rad s, and thus a quality factor 
of 1. Use scaling to compute new values of R and 
L that yield a circuit with the same quality factor 
but with a center frequency of 500 Hz. Use a 2  F
μ  
capacitor.

We now analyze and design op amp circuits that act as bandpass and 
band reject filters. Our initial approach is motivated by the Bode plot con-
struction shown in Fig. 15.9. We can see from the plot that the bandpass 
filter consists of three separate elements:

Figure 15.10 ▲ A cascaded op amp bandpass filter. (a) The block diagram. (b) The circuit.
This method of constructing an active bandpass filter and its corre-
sponding magnitude response assumes that the lower cutoff frequency 
(ωc1) is significantly smaller than the upper cutoff frequency (ωc2). The 
resulting filter is called a broadband bandpass filter because the band of 
frequencies passed is wide. The formal definition of a broadband filter 
requires that the two cutoff frequencies satisfy the equation
ω
ω
≥2.
c
c

As illustrated by the Bode plot construction in Fig. 15.9, we require that 
the magnitude of the high-pass filter be unity at the cutoff frequency of the 
low-pass filter and that the magnitude of the low-pass filter be unity at the 
cutoff frequency of the high-pass filter. Then the bandpass filter will have 
the cutoff frequencies specified by the low-pass and high-pass filters. We 
need to determine the relationship between ωc1 and ωc2 that will satisfy 
the requirements illustrated in Fig. 15.9.
We can construct a circuit consisting of three subcircuits by cascading a 
low-pass op amp filter, a high-pass op amp filter, and an inverting amplifier 
(see Section 5.3), as shown in Fig. 15.10(a). Figure 15.10(a) is called a block 
diagram. Each block represents a component or subcircuit, and the output 
of one block is the input to the next, in the direction indicated. We want to 
establish the relationship between ωc1 and ωc2 that will permit each sub-
circuit to be designed independently, without concern for the other subcir-
cuits in the cascade. This reduces the bandpass filter design to the design 
of a unity-gain first-order low-pass filter, a unity-gain first-order high-pass 
filter, and an inverting amplifier, each of which is a simple circuit.
The transfer function of the cascaded bandpass filter is the product of 
the transfer functions of the three cascaded subcircuits:

We can use a subcircuit approach when designing op amp bandre-
ject filters, too, as illustrated in Fig. 15.12. Like the bandpass filter, the  
band reject filter consists of three separate elements.
• A unity-gain low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of ω ,
c1  which is 
the smaller of the two cutoff frequencies.
•  A unity-gain high-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of ω
,
c2  which is 
the larger of the two cutoff frequencies.
• A summing amplifier that provides the desired gain in the passbands.
There are important differences between the three subcircuits that 
comprise the bandpass filter and those that comprise the bandreject filter. 
The cutoff frequencies of the low-pass and high-pass filters are obviously 
different—in the bandpass filter, the low-pass filter subcircuit has a cutoff 
frequency of ωc2, and in the bandreject filter, the low-pass filter subcir-
cuit has a cutoff frequency of ωc1. The cutoff frequencies for the high-
pass filter subcircuit are also reversed. The most important difference is

series because they do not combine additively on the Bode plot. Instead, 
the low-pass and high-pass filters act in parallel, and a summing ampli-
fier combines their outputs and provides the passband gain. Figure 15.13 
shows this design both in block diagram form and as a circuit.

near the center frequency but only if the specifications meet the require-
ments of a broadband filter.
Example 15.6 illustrates the design process for the parallel bandreject 
filter.
EXAMPLE 15.6     Designing a Broadband Bandreject Op Amp Filter
Design a circuit based on the parallel bandreject 
op amp filter in Fig. 15.13(b). The Bode magnitude 
plot of the desired filter is shown in Fig. 15.14. Use 
0.5  F

Solution
From the Bode magnitude plot in Fig. 15.14, we see 
that the bandreject filter’s cutoff frequencies are

low-pass filter from Example 15.1 and use scaling 
to meet the specifications for cutoff frequency 
and capacitor value. The frequency scale factor 
k f  is 100, which shifts the cutoff frequency from  
1rad s to 100  rad s. The magnitude scale factor km  
is 20,000, which, together with the frequency scale 
factor, scales the capacitor from 1 F to 0.5  F
μ . Using  
these scale factors results in the following scaled 
component values:

15.4 Higher-Order Op Amp Filters
None of the filter circuits we have examined so far, whether passive or 
active, are ideal. Remember from Chapter 14 that an ideal filter has a 
discontinuity at the cutoff frequency, which sharply divides the passband 
and the stopband. Although we cannot hope to construct a linear circuit 
with a discontinuous frequency response, we can construct circuits with a 
sharper, yet still continuous, transition at the cutoff frequency.
Cascading Identical Filters
How can we obtain a sharper transition between the passband and the 
stopband? One approach is suggested by the Bode magnitude plots in 
Fig. 15.16. This figure shows the Bode magnitude plots of a cascade of 
identical prototype low-pass filters and includes plots of a single filter, two 
in cascade, three in cascade, and four in cascade. You can see that the 
transition from the passband to the stopband becomes sharper as more 
filters are added to the cascade. The rules for constructing Bode plots 
(from Appendix E) tell us that with one filter, the transition occurs with 
an asymptotic slope of 20 decibels per decade (dB dec). Because circuits 
in cascade are additive on a Bode magnitude plot, a cascade with two fil-
ters has a transition with an asymptotic slope of 
+
=
20
20
40  dB dec; 
for three filters, the asymptotic slope is 60  dB dec, and for four filters, it 
is 80  dB dec, as seen in Fig. 15.16.

A cascade of first-order low-pass filters yields a higher-order filter. 
From Eq. 15.10, a cascade of n first-order filters produces an nth-order 
filter because the transfer function has n poles, and the filter has a final 
slope of 
n
20   dB dec in the transition band.
There is an important issue yet to be resolved, as you will see if you 
look closely at Fig. 15.16. As the order of the low-pass filter is increased 
by adding prototype low-pass filters to the cascade, the cutoff frequency 
changes. For example, in a cascade of two first-order low-pass filters, the  
magnitude of the resulting second-order filter at 1 rad/s, the cutoff frequency  
of the single prototype low-pass filter, is −6 dB. The cutoff frequency of the  
second-order filter is not 1 rad/s. In fact, the cutoff frequency is less than 
1 rad/s.
Therefore, we need to find the cutoff frequency of the nth-order filter 
formed in the cascade of n first-order filters. Then we can use frequency 
scaling to calculate component values that move the cutoff frequency to 
its specified location. The cutoff frequency, ωcn, satisfies the equation

Let’s use Eq. 15.11 to find the cutoff frequency of a fourth-order

low-pass filters:

Thus, we can design a fourth-order low-pass filter with the cutoff fre-
quency ωc by starting with a fourth-order cascade consisting of prototype 
low-pass filters and then scaling the components by 
ω

0.435

.
We can build a higher-order low-pass filter with a nonunity gain by 
adding an inverting amplifier circuit to the cascade. Example 15.7 illus-
trates the design of a fourth-order low-pass filter with nonunity gain.

Solution
Our design cascades four prototype low-pass fil-
ters. We have already used Eq. 15.11 to calculate 
the cutoff frequency for the resulting fourth-order

The Bode magnitude plot for this transfer function

By cascading identical low-pass filters, we can increase the asymptotic 
slope in the transition between passband and stopband, but our approach 
has a serious shortcoming: The gain of the filter is not constant between 
zero and the cutoff frequency ω .
c  Remember that in an ideal low-pass 

 
15.4 Higher-Order Op Amp Filters

filter, the passband magnitude is 1 for all frequencies below the cutoff fre-
quency. But in Fig. 15.16, we see that the passband magnitude is less than 
1 (0 dB), even for frequencies much less than the cutoff frequency.
We can understand why the passband magnitude is not ideal by look-
ing at the magnitude of the transfer function for a unity-gain low-pass 
nth-order cascade. Because

this nonideal behavior in the passband, other approaches are used when 
designing higher-order filters. One such approach is examined next.

where n is an integer that denotes the order of the filter.1
When studying Eq. 15.12, note the following:
• The cutoff frequency is ω   rad s

 for all values of n.
• If n is large enough, the denominator is always close to unity when 
ω
ω

c
• In the expression for 
ω
(

H j
, the exponent of ω ωc  is always even.
This last observation is important because only even exponents exist in cir-
cuits with resistors, inductors, capacitors, and op amps. (See Problem 15.37.)
Given an equation for the magnitude of the transfer function, how do 
we find H s
( )? We can simplify the derivation for H s
( ) by using a proto-
type filter, so we set ωc equal to 1  rad s in Eq. 15.12. As before, we will 
use scaling to transform the prototype filter to a filter that meets the given 
specifications.
To find H s

Butterworth Filter Circuits
Now that we know how to specify the transfer function for a Butterworth 
filter circuit (either by calculating the poles of the transfer function directly or 
by using Table 15.1), we need to design a circuit with such a transfer function. 
Notice the form of the Butterworth polynomials in Table 15.1. They are the 
product of first- and second-order factors; therefore, we can construct a cir-
cuit whose transfer function has a Butterworth polynomial in its denominator 
by cascading active filter circuits, each of which provides one of the needed 
factors. Figure 15.20 presents a block diagram of a cascade whose transfer 
function has a fifth-order Butterworth polynomial in its denominator.
All odd-order Butterworth polynomials include the factor (

s

so all odd-order Butterworth filter circuits must have a subcircuit with the 
transfer function 
(

=

prototype low-pass active filter from Fig. 15.1. So what remains is to find 
a circuit whose transfer function has the form

We have thus outlined the procedure for designing an nth-order 
Butterworth low-pass filter circuit with a cutoff frequency of ω
= 1  rad s
c
 
and a gain of 1 in the passband. We can use frequency scaling to calculate 
revised capacitor values that yield any specified cutoff frequency, and we 
can use magnitude scaling to provide more realistic or practical compo-
nent values in our design. Cascading an inverting amplifier circuit pro-
vides a passband gain other than 1.
Example 15.9 illustrates this design process.
EXAMPLE 15.9     Designing a Fourth-Order Low-Pass Butterworth Filter
Design a fourth-order Butterworth low-pass filter 
with a cutoff frequency of 500 Hz and a passband 
gain of 10. Use as many 
Ω
1 k
 resistors as possi-
ble. Compare the Bode magnitude plot for this 
Butterworth filter with that of the identical cascade 
filter in Example 15.7.

but the Butterworth filter is closer to an ideal low-
pass filter due to its flatter passband and steeper roll-
off at the cutoff frequency. Thus, the Butterworth 
design is preferred to the identical cascade design.

The Order of a Butterworth Filter
You have probably noticed that the higher the order of the Butterworth 
filter, the closer the transfer function magnitude is to that of an ideal low-
pass filter. In other words, as n increases, the magnitude stays close to unity 
in the passband, the transition band narrows, and the magnitude stays 
close to zero in the stopband. At the same time, as the order increases, 
the number of circuit components increases. Thus, when designing a filter, 
determining the smallest value of n that will meet the filtering specifica-
tions is an important first step.
The filtering specifications for a low-pass filter usually define the 
abruptness of the transition region, as shown in Fig.  15.24. Once A ,

The order of the filter must be an integer; hence, in using either

of Eqs. 15.15 and 15.16.

a) Determine the order of a Butterworth filter that 
has a cutoff frequency of 1000 Hz and a gain of 
no more than −50 dB at 6000 Hz.

Butterworth High-Pass, Bandpass, and Bandreject 
Filters
An nth-order Butterworth high-pass filter has a transfer function with 
the nth-order Butterworth polynomial in the denominator, just like the 
nth- order Butterworth low-pass filter. But in the high-pass filter, the 
numerator of the transfer function is s ,
n  whereas in the low-pass filter, 
the numerator is 1. Again, we use a cascade approach in designing the 
Butterworth high-pass filter. The first-order factor is achieved by includ-
ing a prototype high-pass filter (Fig.  15.4, with R

• The high-pass circuit in Fig. 15.25 was obtained from the low-pass 
circuit in Fig. 15.21 by interchanging resistors and capacitors.
• The prototype transfer function of a high-pass filter can be obtained 
from that of a low-pass filter by replacing s in the low-pass expression 
with 
s
1
 (see Problem 15.41).
These observations are important because they are true in general.
We can use frequency and magnitude scaling to design a Butterworth 
high-pass filter with practical component values and a cutoff frequency 
other than 1  rad s. Adding an inverting amplifier to the cascade will 
accommodate designs with nonunity passband gains. The problems at the 
end of the chapter include several Butterworth high-pass filter designs.
Now that we can design both nth-order low-pass and high-pass 
Butterworth filters with arbitrary cutoff frequencies and passband gains, 
we can combine these filters in cascade (as we did in Section 15.3) to pro-
duce nth-order Butterworth bandpass filters. We can combine these filters 
in parallel with a summing amplifier (again, as we did in Section 15.3) to 
produce nth-order Butterworth bandreject filters. Example 15.12 illus-
trates the design of a Butterworth bandpass filter.

EXAMPLE 15.12    Designing a Butterworth Bandpass Filter
Design the bandpass filter from Example 15.5 using 
a cascade of a fourth-order low-pass Butterworth 
filter, a fourth-order high-pass Butterworth filter, 
and an inverting amplifier. The filter should provide 
an amplification of 2 within the band of frequencies 
between 100 and 10,000 Hz and use as many 
Ω
2 k
 
resistors and 0.2  F
μ  capacitors as possible.
Solution
The circuit is shown in Fig.  15.26. The first two 
stages in the cascade form the fourth-order low-
pass Butterworth filter, which should have a cutoff 
frequency of 10,000 Hz. We have already designed

 15.5  Narrowband Bandpass  
and Bandreject Filters
We can only implement broadband or low-Q bandpass and bandreject fil-
ters when using the cascade and parallel subcircuit designs from the previous 
sections. This limitation is due principally to the form of the transfer func-
tions for cascaded bandpass and parallel bandreject filters—they only have 
discrete real poles. The largest quality factor we can achieve with discrete 
real poles arises when the cutoff frequencies, and thus the pole locations, 
are the same. As an example, consider the transfer function for a bandpass 
filter created from a cascade of a first-order low-pass filter and a first-order 
high-pass filter, where both filters have the same cutoff frequency:

EXAMPLE 15.13   Designing a High-Q Bandpass Filter
Design a bandpass filter, using the circuit in 
Fig. 15.27, that has a center frequency of 3000 Hz, 
a quality factor of 10, and a passband gain of 2. Use 
0.01  F
μ  capacitors in your design. Compute the 
transfer function of your circuit, and sketch a Bode 
plot of its magnitude response.

It is easy to see that this transfer function meets the 
specification of the bandpass filter defined in the 
example. A Bode plot of its magnitude response is 
sketched in Fig. 15.29.
The bandreject design that combines low-pass and high-pass filter 
components with a summing amplifier has the same low-Q restriction as 
the cascaded bandpass filter. The circuit in Fig. 15.30 is an active high-Q 
bandreject filter known as the twin-T notch filter because of the two 
T-shaped parts of the circuit at the nodes labeled a and b.

Bass Volume Control
We now look at an op amp circuit that can be used to control audio signal 
amplification in the bass range. Signals in the audio range have frequencies 
from 20 Hz to 20 kHz. The bass range includes frequencies up to 300 Hz.  
The volume control circuit and its frequency response are shown in 
Fig. 15.33. We can select a desired frequency response curve from the fam-
ily of curves in Fig. 15.33(b) by adjusting the potentiometer in Fig. 15.33(a).

•  The gain in dB can be either positive or negative. If the gain is posi-
tive, a signal in the bass range is amplified or boosted. If the gain is 
negative, the signal is attenuated or cut.
• It is possible to select a response curve that has unity gain (zero dB) 
for all frequencies in the bass range. As we shall see, if the potenti-
ometer is set at its midpoint, the circuit will have no effect on signals 
in the bass range.
• As the frequency increases, all frequency response curves approach 
zero dB or unity gain. Hence, the volume control circuit will have no effect 
on signals in the upper end, or treble range, of the audio frequencies.
We need to find the transfer function, V

s, for the circuit in 
Fig.  15.33(a) in order to analyze the circuit’s frequency response. To 
find the transfer function, we transform the circuit into the s domain as 
shown in Fig. 15.34. The node voltages Va and Vb have been labeled in 
the circuit to support node-voltage analysis. The position of the potenti-
ometer is determined by the numerical value of α, as noted in Fig. 15.34.
To find the transfer function, we write the three KCL equations at the 
nodes labeled Va and Vb, and at the inverting input of the op amp:

The volume control circuit can either amplify or attenuate its input sig-

The numerical values of R1, R2, and C1 are based on two design 
specifications. The first specification is the passband amplification or 
attenuation in the bass range (as ω →0). The second specification is 
the frequency at which this passband amplification or attenuation is 
changed by 3 dB. The component values that satisfy the specifications 
are calculated with α equal to either 1 or 0.

Active Filter Circuits
Summary
• Active filters consist of op amps, resistors, and capac-
itors. They can be configured as low-pass, high-pass, 
bandpass, and bandreject filters. They overcome many 
of the disadvantages associated with passive filters. (See 
page 572.)
• A prototype low-pass filter has component values of 
=
=
Ω
R
R
1

 and 
=
C
1 F, and it produces a unity 
passband gain and a cutoff frequency of 1  rad s. The 
prototype high-pass filter has the same component 
values and also produces a unity passband gain and a  
cutoff frequency of 1 rad s. (See pages 575 and 576.)
• Magnitude scaling can be used to alter component val-
ues without changing the frequency response of a circuit. 
For a magnitude scale factor of km, the scaled (primed) 
values of resistance, capacitance, and inductance are
′ =
′ =
′ =
R
k R
L
k L
C
C k
,
,
and
.
m

(See page 577.)
• Frequency scaling can be used to shift the frequency 
response of a circuit to another frequency region without 
changing the overall shape of the frequency response. For 
a frequency scale factor of k f , the scaled (primed) values 
of resistance, capacitance, and inductance are
′ =

• The design of active low-pass and high-pass filters can 
begin with a prototype filter circuit. Scaling can then be 
applied to shift the frequency response to the desired 
cutoff frequency, using component values that are com-
mercially available. (See page 578.)
• An active broadband bandpass filter can be constructed 
using a cascade of a low-pass filter with the bandpass 
filter’s upper cutoff frequency, a high-pass filter with the 
bandpass filter’s lower cutoff frequency, and (optionally) 
an inverting amplifier gain stage to achieve nonunity 
gain in the passband. Bandpass filters implemented in 
this fashion must be broadband filters 
≫
ω

(
)

1 , so 
that each op amp circuit in the cascade can be specified 
independently. (See page 579.)
•  An active broadband bandreject filter can be constructed 
using a parallel combination of a low-pass filter with the 
bandreject filter’s lower cutoff frequency and a  high-pass 
filter with the bandreject filter’s upper cutoff frequency. 
The outputs are then fed into a summing amplifier, which 
can produce nonunity gain in the passband.  Bandreject 
filters implemented in this way must be broadband filters 
≫
ω
ω
(
)
c
c

1 , so that the low-pass and high-pass filter 
circuits can be designed independently. (See page 585.)
• Higher-order active filters have multiple poles in their 
transfer functions, resulting in a sharper transition from 
the passband to the stopband and thus a more nearly 
ideal frequency response. (See page 588.)
• The transfer function of an nth-order Butterworth low-
pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 1  rad s can be 
determined from the equation

and second-order factors
(See pages 591–592.)
• The fundamental problem in the design of a Butterworth 
filter is to determine the order of the filter. The filter speci-
fication usually defines the sharpness of the transition band 
in terms of the quantities Ap, ω p, As, and ω s. From these 
quantities, we calculate the smallest integer larger than the 
solution to either Eq. 15.15 or Eq. 15.16. (See page 596.)
• A cascade of second-order low-pass op amp filters 
(Fig. 15.21) with 1 Ω resistors and capacitor values chosen 
to produce each factor in the Butterworth polynomial 
will produce an even-order Butterworth low-pass filter. 
Adding a prototype low-pass op amp filter will produce 
an odd-order Butterworth low-pass filter. (See page 593.)
• A cascade of second-order high-pass op amp filters 
(Fig. 15.25) with 1 F capacitors and resistor values cho-
sen to produce each factor in the Butterworth polynomial 
will produce an even-order Butterworth high-pass filter. 
Adding a prototype high-pass op amp filter will produce 
an odd-order Butterworth high-pass filter. (See page 598.)
• For both high- and low-pass Butterworth filters, fre-
quency and magnitude scaling can be used to shift the 

 
Problems

cutoff frequency from 1  rad s and to include realistic 
component values in the design. Cascading an inverting 
amplifier will produce a nonunity passband gain. (See 
page 598.)
• Butterworth low-pass and high-pass filters can be cas-
caded to produce Butterworth bandpass filters of any 
order n. Butterworth low-pass and high-pass filters can 
be combined in parallel with a summing amplifier to 
produce a Butterworth bandreject filter of any order n. 
(See page 599.)
• If a high-Q, or narrowband, bandpass or bandreject filter  
is needed, the circuits shown in Figs. 15.27 and 15.30 can 
be used with the appropriate design equations. Typically, 
capacitor values are chosen from those commercially 
available, and the design equations are used to specify the  
resistor values. (See pages 600 and 603.)

 15.52 The purpose of this problem is to guide you through 
the analysis necessary to establish a design procedure 
for determining the circuit components in a filter cir-

first glance, it appears we have two free choices 
among the five components. However, when 
we investigate the relationships between the 
circuit components and the transfer function 
constraints, we see that if C2 is chosen, there 
is an upper limit on C1 in order for R2(G2) to

Fourier Series
In this chapter, we find the steady-state response of circuits to 
periodic, nonsinusoidal, inputs. A periodic function repeats itself 
every T seconds, so T is the period of the function. For example, 
the function plotted in Fig. 16.1 on page 620 is a periodic wave-
form that is not a sinusoid.
A periodic function satisfies the relationship

time interval that a periodic function may be shifted (either left 
or right) to produce a function that is identical to itself.
Why are we interested in the response of circuits to inputs 
that are periodic but not sinusoids? One reason is that many elec-
trical sources of practical value generate such waveforms. Here 
are a few examples.
•  A nonfiltered electronic rectifier driven from a sinusoidal 
source produces a rectified sine wave that is not sinusoidal 
but is periodic. Figures 16.2(a) and (b) on page 620 show 
the waveforms of the full-wave and half-wave sinusoidal 
rectifiers, respectively.
• The sweep generator used to control the electron beam of 
a cathode-ray oscilloscope produces a periodic triangular 
wave like the one shown in Fig. 16.3 on page 620.
• Function generators, which are used to test equipment in 
a laboratory, are designed to produce nonsinusoidal peri-
odic waveforms, including square waves, triangular waves, 
and rectangular waves. Figure 16.4 on page 620 illustrates 
 typical waveforms output by a function generator.
• A power generator is designed to produce a sinusoidal 
waveform but cannot produce a pure sine wave. Instead,

CHAPTER OBJECTIVES

Practical Perspective 
Active High-Q Filters
An important characteristic of bandpass and bandre-
ject  filters is the quality factor, Q, as we discovered in 
Chapters 14 and 15. The quality factor provides a mea-
sure of how  selective the filter is at and near its center 
frequency. For example, an active bandpass filter with a 
large value of Q will  amplify signals at or near its center 
frequency and will attenuate signals at all other frequen-
cies. In contrast, a bandreject filter with a small value of 
Q will not effectively distinguish between signals at the 
center frequency and signals at frequencies quite differ-
ent from the center frequency.
We can test the quality factor of a bandpass or 
bandreject filter using a periodic signal. For example, 
to test the quality factor of a bandpass filter, input a 
square wave whose frequency is the same as the 
center frequency of the bandpass filter and analyze the 
output. In this chapter, we learn that any periodic sig-
nal can be represented as a sum of sinusoids. The fre-
quencies of the sinusoids include the frequency of the 
periodic signal and integer multiples of that frequency. 
So the input square wave, whose frequency is ω, con-
sists of a sum of sinusoids at the frequencies ω, 2ω, 3ω, 
and so on. If the bandpass  filter has a high quality  
factor, its output will be nearly sinusoidal because 
it filtered out all of the sinusoids that make up the 
square wave except the one at ω. If the filter has a low  
quality factor, its output will still look like a square wave 
because the filter passed many of the sinusoids that 
make up the input square wave to the output. We pres-
ent an example at the end of this chapter.

it produces a distorted sinusoidal wave that is still periodic. 
We can use the analysis techniques in this chapter to deter-
mine the consequences of a circuit with a slightly distorted 
sinusoidal voltage.
• Any nonlinearity in an otherwise linear circuit creates a  
nonsinusoidal periodic function. The rectifier circuit mentioned 
earlier is one example of this phenomenon. Magnetic saturation, 
which occurs in both machines and transformers, is another 
example of a nonlinearity that generates a nonsinusoidal peri-
odic function. An electronic clipping circuit, which uses transistor 
saturation, is yet another example.
Nonsinusoidal periodic functions are also important when ana-
lyzing nonelectrical systems. Problems involving mechanical vibra-
tion, fluid flow, and heat flow all make use of periodic functions. 
In fact, the study and analysis of heat flow in a metal rod led the 
French mathematician Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier (1768–1830) 
to the trigonometric series representation of a periodic function. 
This series bears his name and is the starting point for finding the 
steady-state response of a circuit to a periodic input.

16.1  Fourier Series Analysis:  
An Overview
A periodic function can be represented by an infinite sum of sine and 
 cosine functions that are harmonically related, as Fourier discovered while 
investigating heat-flow problems. Specifically, the frequency of every trig-
onometric term in the infinite series is an integer multiple, or harmonic, 
of the fundamental frequency, 
0
ω , of the periodic function. Thus, if f(t) is 
periodic, Fourier showed that it can be expressed as

Before learning how to find a circuit’s response to a periodic input 
using a Fourier series representation of that input, we first look at the pro-
cess in general terms. We can express all the periodic functions of interest 
in circuit analysis using a Fourier series. But not every periodic function 
has a Fourier series representation. The conditions on a periodic function 
f t( ) that ensure it can be expressed as a convergent Fourier series (known 
as Dirichlet’s conditions) are as follows:
1. f t( ) is single-valued.
2. f t( ) has a finite number of discontinuities in the periodic interval.
3. f t( ) has a finite number of maxima and minima in the periodic 
 interval.
4. The integral

exists.
All periodic functions encountered in circuit analysis satisfy Dirichlet’s condi-
tions. These are sufficient, not necessary conditions. Thus, if f t( ) meets these 
requirements, we know that we can express it as a Fourier series. However, if 
f t( ) does not meet these requirements, we still may be able to express it as a 
Fourier series. The necessary conditions on f t( ) are not known.
After we have determined f t( ) and calculated the Fourier coefficients 
(a
a
, 
,
n
v
 and bn), we replace the periodic source with a dc source a
(
)
v  and 
sinusoidal sources, all connected in series. Each source represents a term 
in the Fourier series representation of the periodic input. Then, we use 
superposition to calculate the response to each source. The sum of the 
individual responses gives us the total steady-state response. The s teady-
state response to each sinusoidal source is most easily found using the 
phasor methods of Chapter 9.
The procedure just outlined involves no new circuit analysis tech-
niques. It produces the Fourier series representation of the steady-state

response; consequently, the functional form of the response is unknown. 
Furthermore, the output waveform is expressed as an infinite sum, so 
we can only estimate its shape by adding a sufficient number of its terms 
 together. While the Fourier series method for finding the steady-state 
 response of a circuit to a periodic input does have some drawbacks, 
it introduces a way of thinking about a problem that is as important as 
getting quantitative results. In fact, the conceptual picture is even more 
important, in some respects, than the quantitative one.

Find the Fourier series for the periodic voltage

To find av, a ,

choose the starting time t .
0  For the periodic voltage 
of Fig. 16.5, the best choice for t 0 is zero. Any other

ASSESSMENT PROBLEMS
SELF-CHECK: Also try Chapter Problems 16.1, 16.3, and 16.4.
Finding the Fourier coefficients, in general, is tedious. Therefore, 
anything that simplifies the task is beneficial. Fortunately, when a periodic 
function possesses certain types of symmetry, we can find its Fourier coef-
ficients with fewer computations. In Section 16.3, we discuss how symme-
try affects the coefficients in a Fourier series.

 
16.3 The Effect of Symmetry on the Fourier Coefficients  
625
16.3  The Effect of Symmetry  
on the Fourier Coefficients
Four types of symmetry make the task of evaluating the Fourier coeffi-
cients easier:
• even-function symmetry,
• odd-function symmetry,
• half-wave symmetry,
• quarter-wave symmetry.
The effect of each type of symmetry on the Fourier coefficients is dis-
cussed in the following sections.

Figure 16.6 illustrates an even periodic function. Functions that satisfy 
Eq. 16.6 are said to be even because polynomial functions with only even 
exponents possess this characteristic.

Note that all the b coefficients are zero if the periodic function is even. 
This means that the Fourier series representation of an even periodic 
function consists only of the constant term and cosine terms—there are no 
sine terms. This is not surprising because the cosine function is even, but 
the sine function is not.
The derivations of Eqs. 16.7–16.9 follow directly from Eqs. 16.3–16.5. 
In each derivation, we select t
T 2
0 = −
 and then break the interval of 
integration into the range from T 2
−
 to 0 and 0 to T 2. For example,

the second integral and simplifying yields Eq. 16.8.

means that the average value of an odd function is always zero because 
the constant term, av, is always zero.
We use the same process to derive Eqs. 16.11–16.13 that we used to 
derive Eqs. 16.7–16.9. We leave the derivations to you in Problem 16.7.
If a periodic function has even or odd symmetry, the symmetry can 
be destroyed by shifting the function along the time axis. This also means 
that if a periodic function lacks even or odd symmetry, it may be possible 
to shift the function along the time axis to create this symmetry. For exam-
ple, the triangular function shown in Fig. 16.8(a) is neither even nor odd. 
However, we can make the function even by shifting it left, as shown in 
Fig. 16.8(b), or odd by shifting it right, as shown in Fig. 16.8(c).

(16.14)
Equation 16.14 states that a periodic function has half-wave symmetry if, 
after it is shifted one-half period and inverted, it is identical to the origi-
nal function. For example, the functions shown in Figs. 16.7 and 16.8 have 
half-wave symmetry, whereas those in Figs. 16.5 and 16.6 do not. Note that  
half-wave symmetry is not determined by where t
0
=
, as seen in Fig. 16.8.
If a periodic function has half-wave symmetry, both ak  and bk are 
zero for even values of k. Moreover, av  also is zero because the average 
value of a function with half-wave symmetry is zero. The expressions for 
the Fourier coefficients are

We leave it to you to verify that this same process can be used to 
 derive Eqs. 16.17 (see Problem 16.8).
We summarize our observations by noting that the Fourier series 
 representation of a periodic function with half-wave symmetry has zero 
average value and contains only odd harmonics.
 Quarter-Wave Symmetry
The term quarter-wave symmetry describes a periodic function that has 
half-wave symmetry and, in addition, symmetry about the midpoint of the 
positive and negative half-cycles. The function illustrated in Fig. 16.9(a)

has quarter-wave symmetry about the midpoint of the positive and nega-
tive half-cycles. The function in Fig. 16.9(b) does not have quarter-wave 
symmetry, although it does have half-wave symmetry.
A periodic function that has quarter-wave symmetry can always be 
made either even or odd by the proper choice of the point where =
t
0. 
For example, the function shown in Fig. 16.9(a) is odd and can be made 
even by shifting the function T 4 units either right or left along the  
t axis. However, the function in Fig. 16.9(b) can never be made either 
even or odd.
To take advantage of quarter-wave symmetry when calculating the 
Fourier coefficients, you must choose the point where =
t
0  to make the 
function either even or odd. If the function is made even, then

(16.18)
Equations 16.18 result from the function’s quarter-wave symmetry in 
addition to its being even. Remember that if a function has quarter-wave 
symmetry, it also has half-wave symmetry, so we can eliminate av  and ak  
for k even. Comparing the expression for a ,
k  k odd, in Eqs. 16.18 with 
Eqs. 16.16 shows that when an even function also has quarter-wave sym-
metry, we can shorten the range of integration from 0 to T 2 to 0 to T 4. 
We leave the derivation of Eqs. 16.18 to you in Problem 16.9.
If the quarter-wave symmetric function is made odd,

Equations 16.19 are a direct consequence of the function being both odd 
and quarter-wave symmetric. Again, quarter-wave symmetry allows us to 
shorten the interval of integration from 0 to T 2 to 0 to T 4. We leave the 
derivation of Eqs. 16.19 to you in Problem 16.10.
Example 16.2 shows how symmetry simplifies the task of finding the 
Fourier coefficients.

Fourier Series
Find the Fourier series representation for the cur-
rent waveform shown in Fig. 16.10.
 Solution
We begin by looking for symmetry in the waveform. 
We find that the function is odd and has half-wave 
and quarter-wave symmetry. Because the function 
is odd, all the a coefficients are zero; that is, a

16.4 An Alternative Trigonometric Form of the Fourier Series

16.4  An Alternative Trigonometric 
Form of the Fourier Series
When analyzing a circuit with a periodic input voltage, we could replace 
the input voltage with a collection of series-connected voltage sources, 
where each source corresponds to a term in the Fourier series represen-
tation of the periodic voltage. This would mean that for every harmonic 
frequency, there is a source for the sine term and a source for the cosine 
term at that frequency.
Instead, to simplify the circuit and our analysis of it, we combine the 
sine and cosine terms at the same harmonic frequency into a single term. 
Then, we can transform the circuit into the phasor domain for each har-
monic frequency, where the combined source is represented as a single 
phasor quantity. Thus, we write the Fourier series in Eq. 16.2 as

We derive Eqs. 16.20 and 16.21 using the phasor method to add the

tions as cosine functions; that is, we rewrite Eq. 16.2 as

16.5 An Application
Let’s use a Fourier series representation of a periodic input voltage to 
find the steady-state output voltage of a linear circuit, which is the RC 
circuit shown in Fig. 16.12(a). The circuit’s input voltage is the periodic 
square wave shown in Fig. 16.12(b). The output voltage is defined across 
the capacitor.
First, we represent the periodic voltage with its Fourier series. The 
waveform in Fig. 16.12(b) has odd, half-wave, and quarter-wave symme-
try, so the only nonzero Fourier coefficients are the bk coefficients for odd 
values of k:

The voltage source,

many series-connected sinusoidal sources. Each source is a sine function 
whose frequency is an odd multiple of the square wave’s frequency. We

to the output voltage.

output voltage is

The Fourier series representation of

some information about the steady-state output voltage, if we focus on the

Thus, Fourier series representation for

 predicts that the output 
will be a highly distorted replica of the input waveform if C is large, and a 
reasonable replica if C is small. In Chapter 13, we looked at the distortion 
between the input and output in terms of how much memory the system 
weighting function had. In the frequency domain, we look at the distortion 
between the steady-state input and output in terms of how the amplitude 
and phase of each harmonic component are altered as it is transmitted 
through the circuit. When the circuit significantly alters the amplitude and 
phase relationships among the harmonics at the output relative to that 
at the input, the output is a distorted version of the input. Thus, in the 
frequency domain, we speak of amplitude distortion and phase distortion.
For the RC circuit in Fig. 16.12(a), amplitude distortion is present 
because the amplitudes of the input harmonics decrease as

An Application of the Direct Approach to the Steady-
State Response
For the simple RC circuit shown in Fig. 16.12(a), we can find the 
 steady-state response without using the Fourier series representation 
of the periodic input voltage. Doing this extra analysis here adds to our 
understanding of the Fourier series approach.
To find the steady-state expression for 
o
v , we reason as follows. The 
square-wave input voltage alternates between charging the capacitor 
toward 
Vm
+
 and 
V .
m
−
 After the circuit reaches steady-state operation, 
this alternate charging becomes periodic. From our analysis of the first- 
order RC circuit in Chapter 7, we know that an abrupt change in the input 
voltage results in an output voltage that is exponential. Thus, the steady-
state waveform of the capacitor voltage for the RC circuit shown in 
Fig. 16.12(a) looks like the waveform shown in Fig. 16.13.

Equations 16.24 and 16.25 indicate that 
t( )
o
v
 has half-wave symme-
try, so the average value of 
o
v  is zero. This result agrees with the Fourier 
series solution for the steady-state response—namely, that because the 
input voltage has no dc component, the output voltage cannot have a dc 
component. Equations 16.24 and 16.25 also show the effect of changing 
the size of the capacitor. If C is small, the exponential functions quickly

Figure 16.14 summarizes the results. The dashed line in Fig. 16.14 is 
the input voltage, the solid colored line depicts the output voltage when C 
is small, and the solid black line depicts the output voltage when C is large.
Finally, we verify that the steady-state response of Eqs. 16.24 and 
16.25 is equivalent to the Fourier series solution in Eq. 16.22. To do so, we 
derive the Fourier series representation of the periodic function described 
by Eqs. 16.24 and 16.25. We have already noted that the periodic voltage 
response has half-wave symmetry. Therefore, the Fourier series contains 
only odd harmonics. For k odd,

You can verify Eqs. 16.26–16.29 in Problems 16.23 and 16.24. 
Equations 16.28 and 16.29 are used with Eqs. 16.20 and 16.21 to derive 
the Fourier series expression in Eq. 16.22; we leave the details to you 
in Problem 16.25.
With this illustrative circuit, we showed how to use the Fourier series 
in conjunction with the principle of superposition to find the steady-state 
response to a periodic input voltage. Again, the principal shortcoming 
of the Fourier series approach is the difficulty of ascertaining the out-
put waveform. However, by considering a circuit’s frequency response, 
we can deduce a reasonable approximation of the steady-state response, 
using a finite number of terms in the Fourier series representation. (See 
Problems 16.29 and 16.30.) Example 16.4 provides another example of the 
Fourier series circuit-analysis method.
EXAMPLE 16.4      Finding the Response of an RLC Circuit to a

voltage is input to the circuit in Fig. 16.15.
a) Find the first five nonzero terms in the Fourier 
series representation of the square-wave input 
voltage.
b) Find the output voltage, 
o
v , for the circuit in 
Fig. 16.15, using the five terms calculated in 
part (a).
c) Use the frequency response of the circuit in

you calculated in part (b).

16.6  Average-Power Calculations

Given the Fourier series representation of the voltage and current at a pair 
of terminals in a linear lumped-parameter circuit, we can express the aver-
age power at the terminals as a function of the harmonic voltages and cur-
rents. Using the trigonometric form of the Fourier series from Eq. 16.20, 
we find that the periodic voltage and current at the circuit’s terminals are

We assume that the current is in the direction of the voltage drop

To find the expression for the average power, we substitute the expres-

integrate. At first glance, this appears to be a formidable task because 
the product iv  requires multiplying two infinite series. However, the only 
terms to survive integration are the products of voltage and current at the 
same frequency. (See Problem 16.5.) Therefore, the equation for average 
power reduces to

Equation 16.30 states that the total average power delivered by a peri-
odic signal is the sum of the average powers associated with each har-
monic voltage and current. Currents and voltages of different frequencies 
do not interact to produce average power. Example 16.5 computes the 
average power delivered by a periodic voltage.
EXAMPLE 16.5      Calculating Average Power for a Circuit with a  
Periodic Voltage Source
Assume that the periodic square-wave voltage in 
Example 16.3 is applied across the terminals of 
a 15 Ω resistor. The value of Vm is 60 V, and the 
value of T is 5 ms.
a) Write the first five nonzero terms of the Fourier 
series representation of 
t( )
v
. Use the trigono-
metric form given in Eq. 16.20.
b) Calculate the average power associated with 
each term in (a).
c) Calculate the total average power delivered to 
the 15 Ω resistor.
d) What percentage of the total power is delivered 
by the first five terms of the Fourier series?

adding the square of the rms value of each harmonic to the square of the

16.9 Amplitude and Phase Spectra

16.9 Amplitude and Phase Spectra
As we have noted, we generally cannot visualize what a periodic  function 
looks like in the time domain from its Fourier series representation. 
Nevertheless, we recognize that the Fourier coefficients characterize the 
periodic function completely.
We can describe a periodic function by plotting the amplitude and 
phase angle of each term in its Fourier series versus frequency. The plot of 
each term’s amplitude versus the frequency is called the amplitude spec-
trum of f t( ), and the plot of each term’s phase angle versus the frequency 
is called the phase spectrum of f t( ). Because the amplitude and phase 
angle are defined at discrete frequency values (that is, at 
0
ω , 2
0
ω , ω
…
3
,
0
), 
these plots are also called line spectra.
Amplitude and phase spectra plots are based on either Eq. 16.20 (An 
and 
n
θ
−
) or Eq. 16.32 C
(
)
n . We focus on Eq. 16.32 and leave the plots 
based on Eq. 16.20 to the problems. For example, consider the periodic 
voltage in Fig. 16.16. From Example 16.7,

From the expression for Cn, we see that the amplitude spectrum is bounded 
by the envelope of the 
x
x
(sin )
 function. Figure 16.17 provides the plot 
of 
x
x
(sin )
 versus x, where x is in radians. It shows that the function’s 
value is zero whenever x is an integral multiple of .

We can therefore deduce that the amplitude spectrum goes through zero 
whenever n
T
τ
 is an integer. As the reciprocal of 
T
τ
 becomes an increas-
ingly larger integer, the number of harmonics between every π radians 
increases. If n
T
π
 is not an integer, the amplitude spectrum still follows 
the 
x
x
(sin  )
 envelope. However, the envelope is not zero at an inte-
gral multiple of 
.
0
ω  Because C n is real for all n, the phase angle associated 
with C n is either zero or 180°, depending on its algebraic sign.
Now, what happens to the amplitude and phase spectra if f t( ) is 
shifted along the time axis? To find out, we shift the periodic voltage in 
Example 16.6 t 0 units to the right. By hypothesis,

soids, one sinusoid at the same frequency as the square wave and all 
of the remaining sinusoids at integer multiples of that frequency. What 
effect will the filter have on this input sum of sinusoids?

The periodic waveform in Fig. 16.16 is important 
because it provides an excellent way to illustrate the tran-
sition from the Fourier series representation of a periodic 
function to the Fourier transform representation of a 
nonperiodic function. We discuss the Fourier transform 
in Chapter 17.

Multiply each term of the Fourier series representation of the square

makes the quality factor 2, and the resulting bandpass filter is less

Summary 
649
At the fundamental frequency, the output has the same 
 amplification factor, but the higher harmonic components have not 
been attenuated as significantly as they were when the filter with 
=
Q
20  was used. Figure 16.21 plots the first three terms of the 
Fourier series representations of the input square wave and the result-
ing output waveforms for the two bandpass filters. Note the nearly 
perfect replication of a sinusoid in the solid line plot of Fig. 16.21(b) 
and the distortion that results when using a less selective filter in the 
dashed line plot of Fig. 16.21(b).

Summary
• A periodic function is a function that repeats itself every 
T seconds. A period is the smallest time interval (T) that 
a periodic function can be shifted to produce a function 
identical to itself. (See page 618.)
• The Fourier series is an infinite series used to represent 
a periodic function. The series consists of a constant 
term and infinitely many harmonically related cosine 
and sine terms. (See page 621.)
• The fundamental frequency is the frequency determined 
by the fundamental period ( f
T
1
0 =
 or 
f
2
0
0
ω
π
=
). 
(See page 621.)
• The harmonic frequency is an integer multiple of the 
fundamental frequency. (See page 621.)
• The Fourier coefficients are the constant term and the 
coefficient of each cosine and sine term in the series. 
(See Eqs. 16.3–16.5, page 622.)
• Five types of symmetry are used to simplify the compu-
tation of the Fourier coefficients:
•  even, in which all sine terms in the series are zero;
• odd, in which all cosine terms and the constant term 
are zero;
• half-wave, in which all even harmonics are zero;
• quarter-wave, half-wave, even, in which the series 
contains only odd harmonic cosine terms;
• quarter-wave, half-wave, odd, in which the series con-
tains only odd harmonic sine terms.
(See page 625.)
• In the alternative form of the Fourier series, each 
harmonic represented by the sum of a cosine and 
sine term is combined into a single term of the form 
ω
θ
(
)
−
A
n
t
cos
n
n

. (See page 631.)
• For steady-state response, the Fourier series of the 
output signal is determined by first finding the out-
put for each component of the input signal. The indi-
vidual responses are added (superimposed) to form 
the Fourier series of the output signal. The response 

650 
Fourier Series
to the individual terms in the input series is found by 
either  frequency-domain or s-domain analysis. (See 
page 633.)
• The waveform of the output signal is difficult to obtain 
without the aid of a computer. Sometimes the frequency 
response (or filtering) characteristics of the circuit can 
be used to ascertain how closely the output waveform 
matches the input waveform. (See page 635.)
• Only harmonics of the same frequency interact to pro-
duce average power. The total average power is the sum 
of the average powers associated with each frequency. 
(See page 640.)
• The rms value of a periodic function can be estimated 
from the Fourier coefficients. (See Eqs. 16.31 and 16.35, 
page 641.)
• The Fourier series of a periodic signal may also be writ-
ten in exponential form by using Euler’s identity to 
replace the cosine and sine terms with their exponential 
equivalents. (See page 642.)
• An amplitude spectrum plots the amplitudes of a function’s 
Fourier series representation versus discrete frequencies. 
A phase spectrum plots the phase angles of a function’s 
Fourier series representation versus discrete frequencies. 
These plots help to visualize the transformation of a cir-
cuit’s input signal to its output signal. (See page 645.)

consider the function in Fig. P16.4(a). Observe that

CHAPTER 
The Fourier Transform
In Chapter  16, we represented periodic functions with a 
Fourier series. This series describes the periodic function using 
the frequency-domain attributes of amplitude and phase angle.  
The Fourier transform extends this frequency-domain represen-
tation to functions that are not periodic. But we have already 
transformed aperiodic functions from the time domain to the fre-
quency domain, using the Laplace transform. You may wonder, 
then, why yet another type of transformation is necessary.
Strictly speaking, the Fourier transform is not a new trans-
form. It is a special case of the bilateral Laplace transform, with 
the real part of the complex frequency set to zero. However, in 
terms of a physical interpretation, the Fourier transform is better 
viewed as a limiting case of a Fourier series. We present this point 
of view in Section 17.1, where we derive the Fourier transform 
equations.
The Fourier transform is more useful than the Laplace trans-
form in certain communications theory and signal-processing 
applications. Although we cannot pursue the Fourier transform 
in depth, its introduction here seems appropriate while the ideas 
underlying the Laplace transform and the Fourier series are still 
fresh in your mind.

CHAPTER OBJECTIVES

 Practical Perspective
Filtering Digital Signals
It is common to use telephone lines to communicate 
 information from one computer to another. As you may 
know, computers represent all information as collections 
of 1’s and 0’s. The value 1 is represented as a voltage, 
usually 5 V, and 0 is represented as 0 V, as shown below. 
The telephone line has a frequency response charac-
teristic that is similar to a low-pass filter. We can use 
Fourier transforms to understand the effect of transmit-
ting a digital value using a telephone line that behaves 
like a filter.

If the period T increases without limit, f(t) transitions from a periodic 
to an aperiodic function. In other words, if T is infinite, f(t) never repeats 
itself and hence is aperiodic. As T increases, the separation between adja-
cent harmonic frequencies becomes smaller and smaller. In particular,

transforms the time-domain expression f t( ) into its corresponding 
 frequency-domain expression

 operation, transforming

Compare Eqs. 17.5 and 17.6. Note that as the time-domain function 
goes from periodic to aperiodic, the amplitude spectrum goes from a dis-
crete line spectrum to a continuous spectrum. Furthermore, the envelope 
of the line spectrum has the same shape as the continuous spectrum. Thus, 
as T increases, the lines in the spectrum get closer together and their ampli-
tudes get smaller, but their envelope doesn’t change shape. The physical 
interpretation of the Fourier transform

17.2  The Convergence  
of the Fourier Integral
A function of time f t( ) has a Fourier transform if the integral in Eq. 17.3 
converges. If f t( ) is a well-behaved function that differs from zero over a 
finite interval of time, convergence is no problem. Well-behaved implies 
that f t( ) is single valued and encloses a finite area over the range of inte-
gration. In practical terms, all pulses of finite duration that interest us are 
well-behaved functions. The evaluation of the Fourier transform of the 
rectangular pulse discussed in Section 17.1 illustrates this point.
If f t( ) is different from zero over an infinite interval, the conver-
gence of the Fourier integral depends on the behavior of f t( ) as →∞
t
. 
A  single-valued function that is nonzero over an infinite interval has a 
Fourier transform if the integral
∫−∞
∞
f t
dt
( )
exists and if any discontinuities in f t( ) are finite. An example is the decay-
ing exponential function illustrated in Fig. 17.3. The Fourier transform of 
f t( ) is
frequency content of 
t( )
v
. Figure 17.2 illustrates these observations. The 
amplitude spectrum plot is based on the assumption that τ is constant and 
T is increasing.

A third important group of functions has great practical interest, but 
these functions do not, in a strict sense, have Fourier transforms. For 
 example, the integral in Eq. 17.3 doesn’t converge if f t( ) is a constant. 
The same can be said if f t( ) is a sinusoidal function, 
ω t
cos
,
0  or a step 
function, Ku t( ). These functions are very important in circuit analysis, 
but, to  include them in Fourier analysis, we must resort to the following 
 mathematical manipulations.
• Create a function in the time domain that has a Fourier transform 
and at the same time can be made arbitrarily close to the function of 
interest. Call the approximating function ′f t( ).
• Find the Fourier transform of the approximating function, 
ω
′
F ( ), and 
then evaluate the limiting value of 
ω
′
F ( ) as ′f t( ) approaches f t( ).
• Define the limiting value of 
ω
′
F ( ) as the Fourier transform of f t( ).
Example 17.1 illustrates this three-step process.

The Fourier Transform
In Section  17.4, we say more about Fourier transforms defined 
through a limit process. Before doing so, in Section  17.3, we use the 
Laplace transform to find the Fourier transform of functions for which the 
Fourier integral converges.
17.3  Using Laplace Transforms 
to Find Fourier Transforms
We can use a table of unilateral, or one-sided, Laplace transform pairs 
to find the Fourier transform for functions whose Fourier integral con-
verges. The Fourier integral converges when the poles of F(s) lie in the 
left half of the s plane. Note that if F(s) has poles in the right half of the  
s plane or along the imaginary axis, f t( ) does not satisfy the constraint 
that ∫−∞
∞
f t
dt
( )
 exists.
The following rules apply when using Laplace transforms to find the 
Fourier transforms of such functions.
1. If f t( ) is zero for 
≤
−
t
0 , replace s by ω
j
 in the Laplace transform 
of f t( ) to get the Fourier transform of f t( ). Thus

2. A negative-time function is nonzero for negative values of time 
and zero for positive values of time. The Fourier transform of a 
negative-time function exists because the range of integration on 
the Fourier integral goes from −∞ to +∞. To find the  Fourier 
 transform of such a negative-time function, reflect the function

the sum of the two transforms. Thus, if we let

The Fourier transform of

we leave for Problem 17.5. Table 17.1 presents a summary of the trans-
form pairs of the important elementary functions.
We now turn to the properties of the Fourier transform that help us 
describe aperiodic time-domain behavior in terms of frequency-domain 
behavior.

17.5 Some Mathematical Properties
We begin by noting that 
ω

in either rectangular or polar form. Thus, from the defining integral,

We can make the following observations about 
ω
F( ):
• The real part of 
ω
F( )—that is, 
ω
A( )—is an even function of ω, so 
ω
ω
=
−
A
A
( )
(

• The imaginary part of 
ω
F( )—that is, 
ω
B( )—is an odd function of ω, 
so 
ω

B

• The magnitude of 
ω
F( )—that is, 
ω

tion of ω.
• The phase angle of

—is an 
odd function of ω.
• Replacing ω  by 
ω

ω
F( ), so

Hence, if f t( ) is an even function, 
ω
F( ) is real, and if f t( ) is an odd 
function, 
ω
F( ) is imaginary. If f t( ) is even,

We leave the derivations for you as Problems 17.10 and 17.11.
If f t( ) is an even function, its Fourier transform is an even function, 
and if f t( ) is an odd function, its Fourier transform is an odd function. 
Moreover, if f t( ) is an even function, from the inverse Fourier integral,

Now compare Eq. 17.12 with Eq. 17.11. Note that, except for a factor of 
π
1 2 , these two equations have the same form. Thus, the waveforms of 
ω
A( ) and f t( ) become interchangeable if f t( ) is an even function.
For example, we have already observed that a rectangular pulse in 
the time domain produces a frequency spectrum of the form 
ω
ω
(sin  )
. 
Specifically, Eq. 17.5 expresses the Fourier transform of the voltage pulse 
shown in Fig. 17.1. Hence, a rectangular pulse in the frequency domain 
must be generated by a time-domain function of the form 
t
t
(sin  )
. We 
can illustrate this transform by finding the time-domain function f t( ) cor-
responding to the frequency spectrum shown in Fig. 17.8. From Eq. 17.12,

17.6  Operational Transforms
Fourier transforms, like Laplace transforms, can be classified as 
 functional and operational. So far, we have concentrated on the  functional 
transforms. We now discuss some of the important operational Fourier 
transforms, which are similar to the operational Laplace transforms in 
Chapter 12. Hence, we leave their proofs to you as Problems 17.12–17.19.

Thus, multiplication of f t( ) by a constant corresponds to multiplying 
ω
F( ) by that same constant.
 Addition (Subtraction)
Addition (subtraction) in the time domain translates into addition 
 (subtraction) in the frequency domain. Thus, if

The Fourier Transform

Dimensionally, time and frequency are reciprocals. Therefore, when time 
is expanded, frequency is compressed (and vice versa), as reflected in the 
functional transform

Note that when

time is compressed.
Translation in the Time Domain
Translating a function in the time domain alters the phase spectrum and 
leaves the amplitude spectrum unchanged. Thus
f t
a

( ).
j a

If a is positive in this equation, the time function is delayed (shifted to the 
right on the time axis), and if a is negative, the time function is advanced 
(shifted to the left on the time axis).
Translation in the Frequency Domain
Translation in the frequency domain corresponds to multiplication by the 
complex exponential in the time domain:

Modulation
Amplitude modulation varies the amplitude of a sinusoidal carrier. If the 
carrier signal is f t( ), the modulated carrier is 
ω
f t

( )cos
0 . The amplitude 
spectrum of the modulated carrier is one-half the amplitude spectrum of 
f t( ) and is centered at ω

form

ω

tionship in Section 17.7.

17.7 Circuit Applications
The Laplace transform is used more often than the Fourier transform 
when finding a circuit’s response to a nonperiodic input. This is because 
the Laplace transform integral converges for a wider range of input func-
tions and it accommodates initial conditions. We can also use the Fourier 
transform to find a circuit’s response to an input using Eq. 17.13, which 
relates the transform of the output 
ω
Y( ) to the transform of the input 
ω
X( ) and the transfer function 
ω
H( ) of the circuit. Note that 
ω
H( ) is the 
familiar H s

Figure  17.10 shows the response. Does the 
solution make sense in terms of known circuit 
 behavior? The answer is yes, based on the follow-
ing analysis. The current source delivers −20 A to 
the circuit  between −∞ and 0, and because the cur-
rent is  constant, the inductor behaves like a short 
circuit over this time interval. Therefore, the resis-
tance in each branch determines how the −20 A 
divides  between the two branches. One-fourth of

the −20 A appears in the io branch, so io is −5A 
for

−20 A to +20 A at 
=
t
0, io approaches its final 
value of +5 A exponentially. The equivalent resis-
tance with respect to the inductor’s terminals is

ASSESSMENT PROBLEMS
An important characteristic of the Fourier transform is that it gives 
us the steady-state response to a sinusoidal input. There is no transient 
component in the response because the Fourier transform of 
ω t
cos
0  
 assumes that the function exists over all time. Example 17.5 illustrates 
this feature.

17.8 Parseval’s Theorem
Parseval’s theorem relates the energy of a time-domain function having 
finite energy to the Fourier transform of that function. Imagine that the 
time-domain function f t( ) is either the voltage across or the current in a 
Ω
1 
 resistor. The energy of this function then is
∫
=
Ω
−∞
∞
W
f
t dt
( )
.

Parseval’s theorem says that we can also calculate this energy using a 
 frequency-domain integral:

(17.14)
Therefore, we can calculate the 
Ω
1 
 energy associated with f t( )  either by 
integrating the square of f t( ) over all time or by integrating the square of 
the magnitude of the Fourier transform of f t( ) over all frequencies and 
multiplying by 
π
1 2 . Parseval’s theorem is valid if both integrals exist.
The average power of time-domain signals with finite energy is zero 
when averaged over all time. Therefore, when comparing such signals, we 
use the energy content of the signals instead of their average power. Using 
a 
Ω
1 
 resistor when making the energy calculation is convenient and lets 
us compare the energy content of voltages and currents.
We begin deriving Eq. 17.14 by rewriting the left-hand side as f t( ) 
times itself and then expressing one f t( ) in terms of the inversion integral:

The Fourier Transform
We move f t( ) inside the interior integral because the integration is with 
respect to ω , and then we factor the constant

Then,

Therefore, approximately 90% of the energy associ-
ated with

v
 is contained in the dominant portion 
of the amplitude spectrum.
Note that the plots in Fig. 17.15 show that as 
the width of the voltage pulse τ
( ) becomes smaller, 
the dominant portion of the amplitude spectrum 
(that is, the spectrum from 
π τ
−2
 to π τ
2
) spreads 
out over a wider range of frequencies. This result 
agrees with our earlier comments about the oper-
ational transform involving a scale change—when 
time is compressed, frequency is expanded and vice 
versa. To transmit a single rectangular pulse with 
reasonable fidelity, the bandwidth of the system 
must be at least wide enough to accommodate the 
dominant portion of the amplitude spectrum. Thus, 
the cutoff frequency should be at least π τ

Practical Perspective
Filtering Digital Signals
To understand the effect of transmitting a digital signal on a  telephone 
line, consider a pulse that represents a digital value of 1, as shown 
in Fig.  17.15(a), with 
=
V
5 V
m
 and τ
µ
= 1  s.  The Fourier trans-
form of this pulse is shown in Fig.  17.15(b), where the amplitude 
τ
µ
=
V
5  V
m
 and the first positive zero-crossing on the frequency axis 
is π τ =
=
2
6.28  Mrad s
1 MHz.
Note that the digital pulse representing the value 1 is ideally a sum 
of an infinite number of frequency components. But the telephone line 
cannot transmit all of these frequency components. Typically, the line 
has a bandwidth of 10 MHz, meaning that it is capable of transmit-
ting only those frequency components below 10 MHz. This causes the

other end of the telephone line, as seen in Fig. 17.16.
Summary
• The Fourier transform gives a frequency-domain 
description of an aperiodic time-domain function. 
Depending on the nature of the  time-domain signal, 
one of three approaches to finding its Fourier transform 
may be used:
• If the time-domain signal is a well-behaved pulse of 
finite duration, the integral that defines the Fourier 
transform is used. (See page 664.)
• If the one-sided Laplace transform of f t( ) exists and 
all the poles of F s
( ) lie in the left half of the s plane, 
F s
( ) may be used to find 
ω
F( ). (See page 668.)
• If f t( ) is a constant, a signum function, a step func-
tion, or a sinusoidal function, the Fourier transform is 
found by using a limit process. (See page 670.)
• Functional and operational Fourier transforms that are 
useful in circuit analysis are tabulated in Tables 17.1 and 
17.2. (See pages 672 and 677.)
• The Fourier transform accommodates both negative- 
time and  positive-time functions and therefore is suited 
to problems whose signals start at 
= −∞
t
. In contrast, 
the unilateral Laplace transform is suited to problems 
with initial conditions and signals that exist for 
>
t
0. 
(See page 679.)
• The Fourier transform of a response signal y(t) is
ω
ω
ω
=
Y
X
H
( )
( )
( ),
where 
ω
X( ) is the Fourier transform of the input signal 
x(t) and 
ω
H( ) is the transfer function H(s) evaluated at 
ω
=
s
j . (See page 679.)
• The magnitude of the Fourier transform squared is 
a measure of the energy density (joules per hertz) in 
the frequency domain (Parseval’s theorem). Thus, the 
Fourier transform permits us to associate a fraction of 
the total energy contained in f t( ) with a specified band 
of frequencies. (See page 683.)

CHAPTER
Two-Port Circuits
We have frequently focused on the behavior of a circuit at 
a specified pair of terminals. We introduced the Thévenin and 
Norton equivalent circuits to simplify circuit analysis relative to 
one pair of terminals. But in some electrical systems, a signal is 
fed into one pair of terminals, processed by the system, and ex-
tracted at a second pair of terminals. We can simplify the analysis 
of such systems using two pairs of terminals, each representing 
the points, or ports, where signals are either input or output.
In this chapter, we present circuits that have one input port 
and one output port. Figure 18.1 on page 696 illustrates the basic 
two-port building block. We make several assumptions when 
using the two-port model in Fig. 18.1 to represent a circuit:
• There is no energy stored within the circuit.
• There are no independent sources within the circuit; depen-
dent sources, however, are permitted.
• The current into a given port equals the current out of that 
port; that is, i
i
1
1
= ′ and i
i
2
2
= ′.
• All external connections must be made to either the input 
port or the output port; no connections can be made 
between ports, that is, between terminals a and c, a and d, b 
and c, or b and d.
These assumptions limit the types of circuits that can be repre-
sented by a two-port model.
When we represent a circuit using a two-port model, we are 
only interested in the circuit’s terminal variables (i1, 
1v , i2, and 
2
v ). We cannot use the two-port model to find the currents and 
voltages inside the circuit. We have already used such terminal 
behavior when analyzing operational amplifier circuits. In this 
chapter, we formalize that approach by introducing the two-port 
parameters.

CHAPTER OBJECTIVES
1 Be able to calculate any set of two-port 
parameters with any of the following 
methods:
• Circuit analysis;
• Measurements made on a circuit;
• Converting from another set of two- 
port parameters using Table 18.1.
2  Be able to analyze a terminated two-
port circuit to find currents, voltages, 
impedances, and ratios of interest using 
Table 18.2.
3 Know how to analyze a cascade  
interconnection of two-port circuits.

Practical Perspective
Characterizing an Unknown Circuit
Up to this point, whenever we wanted to create a model of 
a circuit, we needed to know what types of components 
make up the circuit, the values of those components, and 
the interconnections among those components. But what 
if we want to model a circuit that is inside a “black box,” 
where the components, their values, and their intercon-
nections are hidden?
In this chapter, we will discover that by making two 
simple measurements on such a black box, we can 
 create a model consisting of just four values—the two-
port parameter model for the circuit. We can then use 
the two-port parameter model to predict the behavior  
of the circuit once we have attached a power source to 
one of its ports and a load to the other port.
In this example, suppose we have found a circuit, 
enclosed in a casing, with two wires extending from each 
side, as shown below. The casing is labeled “amplifier,” 
and we want to determine whether or not it would be safe 
to use this amplifier to connect a DVD player modeled as a  
2 V source to a speaker modeled as a 32 Ω resistor with 
a power rating of 100 W.

Two-Port Circuits
18.1 The Terminal Equations
When we consider a circuit to be a two-port network, we want to relate 
the current and voltage at one port to the current and voltage at the other 
port. Figure 18.1 shows the reference polarities of the terminal voltages 
and the reference directions of the terminal currents. The references at 
each port are symmetric with respect to each other; that is, at each port 
the current is directed into the upper terminal, and at each port the volt-
age rises from the lower to the upper terminal.
The most general two-port network describes the circuit in the  
s domain. For purely resistive circuits, we can analyze the time-domain 
circuit to find its two-port network description. Two-port networks used 
to find sinusoidal steady-state responses can be constructed by finding the 
appropriate s-domain expressions and then replacing s with j ,
ω  or by using 
phasor techniques directly. Here, we write all equations in the s domain; 
resistive networks and sinusoidal steady-state solutions become special 
cases. Figure 18.2 shows the basic building block in terms of the s-domain 
variables I ,
1  V ,
1  I ,
2  and V .
2
Only two of the four terminal variables are independent. Thus, for 
any circuit, once we specify two of the variables, we can find the two 
remaining unknowns. For example, knowing V1 and V2 and the circuit 
within the box, we can find I 1 and I .
2  The two-port network description 
consists of two simultaneous equations. However, there are six different 
ways in which to combine the four variables:

(18.6)
These six sets of equations may also be considered as three pairs of 
mutually inverse relations. The first set, Eqs. 18.1, gives the input and out-
put voltages as functions of the input and output currents. The second 
set, Eqs. 18.2, gives the inverse relationship, that is, the input and output 
currents as functions of the input and output voltages. Equations 18.3 and 
18.4 are inverse relations, as are Eqs. 18.5 and 18.6.
The coefficients of the current and/or voltage variables on the right-
hand side of Eqs. 18.1–18.6 are called the parameters of the two-port 
circuit. Thus, when using Eqs. 18.1, we refer to the z parameters of the 
circuit. Similarly, we refer to the y parameters, the a parameters, the b 
parameters, the h parameters, and the g parameters of the network.

18.2 The Two-Port Parameters
We can determine the parameters for any circuit by computation or 
 measurement. The computations or measurements we need come from 
the parameter equations. For example, suppose we want to find the z 
 parameters for a circuit. From Eqs. 18.1,

 Equations 18.7–18.10 reveal that the four z parameters can be described 
as follows:
• 
z11 is the impedance seen looking into port 1 when port 2 is open.
• 
z12 is a transfer impedance. It is the ratio of the port 1 voltage to the 
port 2 current when port 1 is open.
• 
z21 is a transfer impedance. It is the ratio of the port 2 voltage to the 
port 1 current when port 2 is open.
• 
z22 is the impedance seen looking into port 2 when port 1 is open.
Therefore, the impedance parameters may be either calculated or mea-
sured by first opening port 2 and determining the ratios V
I
1
1  and V
I ,
2
1  
and then opening port 1 and determining the ratios V
I
1
2  and V
I .

2
Equations 18.7–18.10 show why the parameters in Eqs. 18.1 are called 
the z parameters. Each parameter is the ratio of a voltage to a current and 
therefore is an impedance with the dimension of ohms.
We use the same process to determine the remaining two-port 
parameters, which are either calculated or measured. Finding a two-port  
parameter requires that a port be either opened or shorted. The  
two-port parameters are either impedances, admittances, or dimension-
less ratios. The dimensionless ratios are either ratios of two voltages or 
two currents. Equations 18.11–18.15 summarize these observations.

We also give descriptive names to the reciprocal sets of two-port 
parameters. The impedance and admittance parameters are grouped into 
the immittance parameters. An immittance is either an impedance or an 
admittance. The a and b parameters are called the transmission parame-
ters because they describe the voltage and current at one end of the two-
port network in terms of the voltage and current at the other end. The 
immittance and transmission parameters are the natural choices for relat-
ing the two-port variables because they relate either voltage to current 
variables or input to output variables. In contrast, the h and g parameters 
relate an input voltage and output current to an output voltage and input 
current. Therefore, the h and g parameters are called hybrid parameters.
 Example 18.1 calculates the z parameters for a resistive circuit by analyz-
ing the circuit. Example 18.2 illustrates how a set of measurements made at 
the terminals of a two-port circuit can be used to calculate the a parameters.

Relationships among the Two-Port Parameters
All six sets of two-port parameter equations relate to the same variables. 
Therefore, every set of two-port parameters must be related to every 
other set of these parameters. In other words, if we know one set of two-
port parameters, we can derive all the other sets from the known set. The 
equations used to calculate any single two-port parameter from any set of 
two-port parameters are given in Table 18.1.
We do not derive all the relationships listed in Table 18.1 because 
of the amount of algebra involved. To illustrate the general process, we 
derive the relationships between the z and y parameters and between the 
z and a parameters. To find the z parameters as functions of the y para-
meters, begin by solving Eqs. 18.2 for V1 and V .
2  We then compare the 
coefficients of I 1 and I 2 in the resulting expressions to the coefficients of 
I 1 and I 2 in Eqs. 18.1. From Eqs. 18.2,

Two-Port Circuits
EXAMPLE 18.3     Finding h Parameters from Measurements and Table 18.1
Two sets of measurements are made on a two-

short-circuited. The results are as follows:

of Eqs. 18.7–18.15 indicates that the four a para-

ments. Then, h12 and h22 can be obtained through 
the conversion table.  Specifically,

18.2 The Two-Port Parameters 
703
Reciprocal Two-Port Circuits
A two-port circuit is reciprocal if interchanging an ideal voltage source 
at one port with an ideal ammeter at the other port produces the same 
ammeter reading. A two-port circuit is also reciprocal if interchanging an 
ideal current source at one port with an ideal voltmeter at the other port 
produces the same voltmeter reading. Relationships exist among recipro-
cal two-port parameters, as shown in Table 18.2. For a reciprocal two-port 
circuit, only three calculations or measurements are needed to determine 
a set of parameters.
A reciprocal two-port circuit is symmetric if its ports can be inter-
changed without altering terminal current and voltage values. Figure 18.6 
shows four examples of symmetric two-port circuits. In these circuits, 
additional relationships exist among the two-port parameters, as shown 
in Table 18.2. If a circuit is both reciprocal and symmetric, then only two 
calculations or measurements are necessary to determine all the two-port 
parameters. Example 18.4 determines whether a circuit is reciprocal and 
symmetric.
EXAMPLE 18.4  Determining Whether a Circuit Is Reciprocal and Symmetric
Consider the resistive circuit shown in Fig. 18.7.
a) Attach a 15 V source to the terminals a and d 
and calculate the reading on an ideal amme-
ter  attached between terminals c and d. Then 
 attach a 15 V source to the terminals c and d 
and  calculate the reading on an ideal ammeter 
 attached between terminals a and d. Is the cir-
cuit  reciprocal?
b) Find the y parameters for the circuit and deter-
mine whether or not it is symmetric.

Solution
a) A 15 V source is attached between nodes a and 
d, and an ammeter is attached between termi-
nals c and d. The resulting circuit is shown in 
Fig.  18.8. To find the ammeter current, begin 
by writing a KCL equation at node b to deter-
mine the voltage between nodes b and d, Vbd.

18.3 Analysis of the Terminated Two-Port Circuit

18.3  Analysis of the Terminated  
Two-Port Circuit
A terminated two-port circuit usually has a source attached at port 1 and 
a load attached at port 2, as shown in the s-domain circuit of Fig. 18.10. In 
this circuit, Zg  is the internal source impedance, Vg  the internal source 
voltage, and ZL  is the load impedance. To analyze this circuit, we find the 
terminal currents and voltages as functions of the two-port parameters, 
V ,
g  Z ,
g  and Z .

nal behavior:

The Six Characteristics in Terms of the z Parameters
To illustrate how these six characteristics are derived, we find their 
expressions using the z parameters of the two-port portion of the cir-
cuit. Table 18.3 summarizes the expressions involving the y, a, b, h, and g 
parameters.
We find the expression for each characteristic using one set of two-
port equations, along with the two constraint equations imposed by the 
source applied at port 1 and the load applied at port 2. Using the z param-
eters, the circuit in Fig. 18.10 is described by the following four equations:

 18.4 Interconnected Two-Port Circuits
Synthesizing a large, complex system is usually made easier by first design-
ing subsections of the system and then interconnecting the subsections. If 
the subsections are modeled by two-port circuits, we will need to analyze 
interconnected two-port circuits to complete the system design.
Two-port subsystem circuits can be interconnected in five ways: (1) in 
cascade, (2) in series, (3) in parallel, (4) in series-parallel, and (5) in parallel- 
series. Figure 18.12 depicts these five basic interconnections.

We analyze and illustrate only the cascade connection in this section. 
The cascade connection is important because it occurs frequently in the 
modeling of large systems. The a parameters are best suited for describing 
the cascade connection. We analyze the cascade connection using the cir-
cuit shown in Fig. 18.13, where a single prime denotes a parameters in the 
first circuit and a double prime denotes a parameters in the second circuit. 
The output voltage and current of the first circuit are labeled V2′ and I ,
2′  
and the input voltage and current of the second circuit are labeled V1′ and 
I .
1′  The problem is to derive the a-parameter equations that relate V2 and 
I 2 to V1 and I .
1  In other words, we want to construct the equations

where the a parameters are given explicitly in terms of the a parameters of 
the individual circuits.

If more than two units are connected in cascade, the a parameters of 
the equivalent two-port circuit can be found by successively reducing the 
original set of two-port circuits one pair at a time.
Example 18.6 illustrates how to use Eqs. 18.31–18.34 to analyze a cas-
cade connection with two amplifier circuits.
EXAMPLE 18.6  Analyzing Cascaded Two-Port Circuits

Now we use the terminated two-port equations to determine 
whether or not it is safe to attach a 2 V(rms) source with a 100 Ω internal 
impedance to Port 1 and use this source together with the amplifier to 
drive a speaker modeled as a 32 Ω resistance with a power rating of 
100 W. Begin by finding the value of I 2 from Table 18.3:

Summary
• The two-port model is used to describe the performance 
of a circuit in terms of the voltage and current at its 
input and output ports. (See page 694.)
• The model is limited to circuits in which
• no independent sources are inside the circuit between 
the ports;
• no energy is stored inside the circuit between the ports;
• the current into the port is equal to the current out of 
the port; and
• no external connections exist between the input and 
output ports.
(See page 692.)
• Two of the four terminal variables V I
V
I
(
,
,
,
)
1
1
2
2  are 
independent; therefore, only two simultaneous equa-
tions involving the four variables are needed to describe 
the circuit. (See page 694.)
• The six possible sets of simultaneous equations involving  
the four terminal variables are called the z-, y-, a-, b-, h-, and 
g-parameter equations. See Eqs. 18.1–18.6. (See page 694.)
• The equations are written in the s domain. The dc values 
of the parameters are obtained by setting s
0,
=
 and 
the sinusoidal steady-state values are obtained by set-
ting s
jω
=
. (See page 694.)
• Any set of two-port parameters can be calculated or 
measured by invoking appropriate short-circuit and 
open-circuit conditions at the input and output ports. 
See Eqs. 18.7–18.15. (See pages 695 and 696.)
•  The relationships among the six sets of two-port param-
eters are given in Table 18.1. (See page 699.)
• A two-port circuit is reciprocal if interchanging an ideal 
voltage source at one port with an ideal ammeter at the 
other port produces the same ammeter reading. The 
effect of reciprocity on the two-port parameters is given 
in Table 18.2. (See page 701.)
• A reciprocal two-port circuit is symmetric if its ports 
can be interchanged without disturbing the values of the 
terminal currents and voltages. The added effect of sym-
metry on the two-port parameters is given in Table 18.2. 
(See page 701.)
• The characteristics of a terminated two-port circuit, 
which is connected to a Thévenin equivalent source 
and a load, are summarized by the relationships given 
in Table 18.3. (See page 704.)
• Large networks can be divided into subnetworks by 
means of interconnected two-port models. The cas-
cade connection was used in this chapter to illustrate 
the analysis of interconnected two-port circuits. (See 
page 709.)

APPENDIX 
The Solution of Linear 
Simultaneous Equations
 Circuit analysis frequently requires us to solve a set of linear simulta-
neous equations. We present several different solution methods here—
some that employ engineering calculators or personal computers, and 
others that require just a pencil and paper. Most of the methods begin 
by placing the system of equations in matrix form. You should review 
matrices and matrix arithmetic, topics found in most intermediate-level 
algebra texts.
A.1 Preliminary Steps
To solve a set of simultaneous equations, we begin by organizing the 
equations into a standard form. To do this, collect all terms containing 
an unknown variable on the left-hand side of each equation and place 
all constants on the right-hand side. Then, arrange the equations in a 
vertical stack such that each variable occupies the same horizontal po-
sition in every equation. For example, in Eqs. A.1, the variables i1, i2 , 
and i3 occupy the first, second, and third position, respectively, on the 
left-hand side of each equation:

We can abbreviate the set of equations in matrix form as

B, 
where A is the matrix of coefficients that multiply the variables, X is 
the vector of the variables, and B is the vector of constants from the 
right-hand side of the equations. When written in this abbreviated form, 
we can solve for the vector of unknowns by finding the inverse of the A 
matrix and multiplying it by the B vector:

A.2 Calculator and Computer Methods
Most calculators recommended for engineering students can solve a set of 
simultaneous algebraic equations. Because there are many different calcu-
lators, it is impractical to provide directions or an example here. Instead, 
we provide the general steps for using your calculator to solve equations; 
you should refer to the manual for your specific calculator or search for 
instructions on the web.
1. Input the problem dimension by specifying the number of un-
knowns.
2. Create the A matrix, which is the matrix of coefficients that multi-
ply the unknowns on the left-hand sides of the equations.
3. Create the B array, which is the array of constants on the right-hand 
sides of the equations.
4. Use the “solve” function (which has different names for different 
calculators) for the matrix A and the array B, to calculate the array 
X that contains the values of the unknowns.
Most calculators can solve simultaneous equations that have real number 
coefficients and complex number coefficients. Some can even solve simul-
taneous equations whose coefficients include symbols.
There are many different computer programs that can solve a set of  
algebraic equations. We present two examples: Excel, the spreadsheet appli-
cation, and MATLAB, the matrix-based programming language. You should 
explore the options available and pick the software that works best for you.
 Using Excel
Figure A.1 uses Excel to solve the simultaneous equations given in  
Eqs. A.1. Note that Excel can only solve simultaneous equations whose 
coefficients are real numbers. To begin, enter the A matrix in a square 
collection of cells and enter the B vector in a column of cells. You can 

722 
The Solution of Linear Simultaneous Equations
label the matrix and vector, as shown in the figure, but this is not required. 
Then highlight a column of cells for the vector X, which will contain the 
values of the unknowns. The number of cells in this column must equal 
the number of unknowns. Type the following function in the function box:
= MMULT(MINVERSE(start_cell, end_cell), b :b )
n
1
and simultaneously press the Ctrl-Shift-Enter keys. This will enter 
the values for the X vector into the highlighted cells and also will sur-
round the function with braces, as shown in Fig. A.1. The function 
MINVERSE(start_cell, end_cell) calculates the inverse of a matrix. The 
matrix values occupy square collection of cells whose upper left cell is 
start_cell and whose lower right cell is end_cell. The MMULT(R, S) mul-
tiplies two matrices, R and S, supplied as arguments.
Using MATLAB
There are several ways to solve a system of simultaneous equations using 
MATLAB. Figure A.2 illustrates one method to solve Eqs. A.1. It begins

by defining the three unknown variables and the three simultaneous equa-
tions. Then, the function equationsToMatrix(eq,  var) constructs 
the A matrix and the B vector from the equations supplied in the func-
tion’s first argument, using the variables specified in the function’s second 
argument. Finally, the function linsolve(A,  B) calculates the values of 
the unknowns by  inverting the matrix supplied in the function’s first argu-
ment and then multiplying by the vector supplied in the function’s second 
argument. Note that, unlike Excel, the simultaneous equations specified 
in MATLAB can have complex numbers as coefficients on the left-hand 
side and constants on the right-hand side.
A.3 Paper-and-Pencil Methods
We present two methods that do not require an engineering calculator or 
computer software: back-substitution and Cramer’s method. Both meth-
ods are easy to use when solving two or three simultaneous equations. If 
you have four or more simultaneous equations, you should solve them 
with your calculator or computer because the paper-and-pencil methods 
are quite complicated. Both back-substitution and Cramer’s method work 
for equations with real numbers, with complex numbers, or even with 
symbols as coefficients and constants.
Back-Substitution
The back-substitution method picks one equation and solves it for one 
unknown in terms of the remaining unknowns. The solution is used to 
eliminate that unknown in the remaining equations. This process is  
repeated until only one equation and one unknown remain. To illustrate, 
we will solve Eqs. A.2 using back-substitution. Begin by solving the third 
equation for 
3

There is another way to solve a set of simultaneous equations with 
the back-substitution method. Begin by picking any two equations, and 
multiply one or both equations by a constant such that when the resulting 

724 
The Solution of Linear Simultaneous Equations
equations are added together, one of the unknowns is eliminated. For ex-
ample, consider the first two equations in Eqs. A.3. If we multiply the first 
equation by the constant 4 and add the resulting equation to the second 
equation, we eliminate

We can substitute the value of 
1
v  back into the first equation in Eqs. A.3 to 
find v 2 and then substitute the value of 
2
v  back into the second equation in 
Eqs. A.3 to find 
3
v . You should complete these final steps to verify the values.
Cramer’s Method
We can also use Cramer’s method to solve a set of simultaneous equations. 
The value of each unknown variable is the ratio of two determinants. If we 
let N, with an appropriate subscript, represent the numerator determinant 
and ∆ represent the denominator determinant, then the kth unknown xk is
 
x
N .
k
k
=
∆
 
( A . 4 )
The denominator determinant ∆ is the same for every unknown variable 
and is called the characteristic determinant of the set of equations. The 
numerator determinant Nk varies with each unknown.
The characteristic determinant is the determinant of the A matrix. 
For example, the characteristic determinant of Eqs. A.3 is

A.4 Applications

Note that this shortcut method for finding a determinant works only for 
square matrices of dimension 3. To find the determinant for a matrix 
whose dimension is larger than 3, consult a reference on determinants.
To construct the numerator determinant Nk, replace the kth col-
umn in the characteristic determinant with the values in the B vector.

The shortcut for calculating the determinant for a 
matrix of dimension 3 does not work for matrices of 
dimension 2. Instead, there is a different shortcut for 
these matrices. Starting at the top of the first column, 
find the product along the left-to-right diagonal. Then 
subtract the product along the right-to-left diagonal 
that starts at the top of the second column. Thus,

used as the symbol for current, and hence in electrical engineering literature, j is used to 
denote −.

Complex numbers allow us to find the square root of negative numbers. For 
example, consider the equation x

Therefore, this equation has no solution in a number system that exclu­
des complex numbers. Complex numbers, and the ability to manipulate 
them algebraically, are extremely useful in circuit analysis.
B.1 Notation
There are two ways to designate a complex number: with the rectan­
gular (or cartesian) form or with the polar (or trigonometric) form. In 
 rectangular form, a complex number is written as a sum of a real compo­
nent and an imaginary component; hence
 
=
+
n
a
jb,
where a is the real component, b is the imaginary component, and j is, 
by definition, −1.1
In polar form, a complex number is written in terms of its magni­
tude (or modulus) and angle (or argument); hence
 
=
θ
n
ce j
where c is the magnitude, θ is the angle, e is the base of the natural log­
arithm, and, as before, 
=
−
j
1. The symbol ∠θ°  is frequently used in 
place of 
θ
e j , so the polar form can also be written as
 
n
c
.
∠θ
=
When we write a complex number in polar form, we typically use 
the angle notation. But when we perform mathematical operations 
using complex numbers in polar form, we use the exponential nota­
tion because the rules for manipulating an exponential quantity are 
well known. For example, because y

x

 then e

 and so forth.

Complex Numbers
Since there are two ways of expressing the same complex number, we 
need to relate one form to the other. The transition from polar to rectan­
gular form makes use of Euler’s identity:

The expression for tan θ does not specify the quadrant where the angle θ 
is located. We can determine the location of θ using a graphical represen­
tation of the complex number.
B.2  The Graphical Representation of 
a Complex Number
A complex number is represented graphically on a complex­number 
plane, where the horizontal axis represents the real component and the 
vertical axis represents the imaginary component. The angle of the com­
plex number is measured counterclockwise from the positive real axis. 
The plot of the complex number n
a
jb
c∠θ
=
+
=
, assuming that a 
and b are both positive, is shown in Fig. B.1.
This plot makes very clear the relationship between the rectangular and 
polar forms. Any point in the complex­number plane is uniquely defined by 
giving either its distance from each axis (that is, a and b) or its radial distance 
from the origin (c) and the angle with respect to the positive real axis, θ.
It follows from Fig. B.1 that θ is in the first quadrant when a and b are 
both positive, in the second quadrant when a is negative and b is positive, in 
the third quadrant when a and b are both negative, and in the fourth quad­
rant when a is positive and b is negative. These observations are illustrated 
in Fig. B.2, where we have plotted 
+ j

3, −
+ j

Note that we can also specify θ as a clockwise angle from the pos­
itive real axis. Thus, in Fig. B.2(c), we could also designate −
−j
4
3 as 
5
143.13
∠−
°. In Fig. B.2(d), we observe that 5
323.13

It is customary to express θ in terms of negative values when θ lies in the 
third or fourth quadrant, so that

Therefore, the conjugate of c∠θ is c∠θ
−. The conjugate of a complex 
number is designated with an asterisk, so n* is understood to be the con­
jugate of n. Figure B.3 shows two complex numbers and their conjugates 
plotted on the complex­number plane. Note that conjugation reflects a 
complex number about the real axis.
B.3 Arithmetic Operations
Addition (Subtraction)
When adding or subtracting complex numbers, we express the numbers in 
rectangular form. Addition involves adding the real parts of the complex 
numbers to form the real part of the sum and adding the imaginary parts 
to form the imaginary part of the sum. Thus, if we are given

Multiplication (Division)
When multiplying or dividing complex numbers, the numbers can be 
written in either rectangular or polar form. In most cases, polar form 
is more convenient. As an example, let’s find the product n n

If we use polar form, we find the product of two complex numbers by mul­
tiplying their magnitudes and adding their angles. For example,

The first step in dividing two complex numbers in rectangular form 
is to multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the  
denominator. This makes the denominator a real number. We then divide 
the real number into the new numerator. As an example, let’s calculate

C.1  Equivalent Circuits for 
Magnetically Coupled Coils
It is sometimes convenient to model magnetically coupled coils with an 
equivalent circuit that does not include magnetic coupling. Consider 
the two magnetically coupled coils shown in Fig. C.1. The resistances 
R1 and R2 represent the winding resistance of each coil. The goal is to  
replace the magnetically coupled coils inside the shaded area with a 
set of inductors that are not magnetically coupled. Before deriving the 
equivalent circuits, we must point out an important restriction: The 
voltage between terminals b and d must be zero. In other words, we 
must be able to short together terminals b and d without disturbing the 
voltages and currents in the original circuit. This restriction is  imposed 
because, while the equivalent circuits we develop have four termi-
nals, two of those four terminals are shorted together. Thus, the same  
requirement is placed on the original circuits.
We begin by writing the two equations that relate the terminal volt-
ages 1
v  and 
2
v  to the terminal currents i1 and i .

The T-Equivalent Circuit
How can we arrange uncoupled inductors in a circuit that can be 
described by Eqs. C.1 and C.2? If we regard Eqs. C.1 and C.2 as 
mesh-current equations with i1 and i2 as the mesh currents, we need 
one mesh with a total inductance of L1 and a second mesh with a total 
inductance of L2. Also, the two meshes must have a common induc-
tance of M. The T-equivalent circuit shown in Fig. C.2 satisfies these 
requirements.
You should verify that the equations relating 
1
v  and 
2
v  to i1 and 
i2 reduce to Eqs. C.1 and C.2. Note the absence of magnetic coupling  
between the inductors and the zero voltage between b and d.

Figure C.5 ▲ The π-equivalent circuit used for 
sinusoidal steady-state analysis.
Note that the initial values of i1 and i2  are explicit in the π-equivalent 
circuit but implicit in the T-equivalent circuit. If we want to find the 
 sinusoidal steady-state behavior of circuits containing mutual inductance, 
we can assume that the initial values of i1 and i2  are zero. We can thus 
eliminate the current sources in the π-equivalent circuit, and the circuit 
shown in Fig. C.4 simplifies to the one shown in Fig. C.5.
The mutual inductance carries its own algebraic sign in the T- and  
π- equivalent circuits. In other words, if the magnetic polarity of the cou-
pled coils is reversed from that given in Fig. C.1, the algebraic sign of M 
reverses. A reversal in magnetic polarity requires moving one polarity 
dot without changing the reference polarities of the terminal currents and 
voltages.
Example C.1 illustrates the application of the T-equivalent circuit.
EXAMPLE C.1
a) Replace the magnetically coupled coils shown in 
Fig. C.6 with a T-equivalent circuit. Then find the 
phasor currents I 1 and I 2. The source frequency 
is 400 rad s.

ondary winding moved to the lower terminal.

C.2  The Need for Ideal Transformers 
in the Equivalent Circuits
The inductors in the T- and π-equivalent circuits of magnetically cou-
pled coils can have negative values. For example, if L
3 mH,
1 =
 
L
12 mH,
2 =
 and M
5 mH,
=
 the T-equivalent circuit requires an  
inductor of 
2 mH
−
, and the π-equivalent circuit requires an inductor of 
5.5 mH.
−
 These  negative inductance values do not create a problem if 
you use the  equivalent circuits in computations. However, if you want 
to build the equivalent circuits using circuit components, the negative 
reactance can only be achieved using capacitors. But whenever the fre-
quency of the sinusoidal source changes, you must change the capacitor 
used to generate the negative reactance. For example, at a frequency of 
50 krad s, a 2 mH
−
 inductor has an impedance of 
j100 Ω
−
. This imped-
ance can be modeled with a 
µ
0.2
F capacitor. If the frequency changes to 
25 krad s, the 
2 mH
−
 inductive impedance changes to −j50 Ω and we 
need a 
µ
0.8
F capacitor. If the frequency is varied continuously, using a 
capacitor to simulate negative inductance is impractical.
Instead of using capacitors to create negative reactance, you can 
 include an ideal transformer in the equivalent circuit. This doesn’t 
 completely solve the problem because ideal transformers can only 
be  approximated. However, in some situations the approximation is 
 satisfactory, so knowing how to use an ideal transformer in the T- and  
π-equivalent circuits of magnetically coupled coils is an important tool.
An ideal transformer can be used in two different ways in either the 
T-equivalent or the π-equivalent circuit. Figure C.12 shows the two arrange-
ments for each type of equivalent circuit. To verify any of the equivalent 
circuits in Fig. C.12, we must show that the equations relating 
1
v  and 
2
v  to 
di
dt
1
 and di
dt
2
 are identical to Eqs. C.1 and C.2. To demonstrate, we val-
idate the circuit shown in Fig. C.12(a); we leave it to you to verify the circuits 
in Figs. C.12(b), (c), and (d).

These expressions for

the circuit shown in Fig. C.13 is equivalent to the magnetically coupled 
coils shown inside the box in Fig. C.1 because the terminal behavior of 
these two circuits is the same.
When we showed that the circuit in Fig. C.13 is equivalent to the mag-
netically coupled coils in Fig. C.1, we placed no restrictions on the turns 
ratio a. Therefore, an infinite number of equivalent circuits are possible. 
However, we can always find a turns ratio that makes all of the induc-
tances positive. Two values of a are of particular interest:

 to derive the inductor values in

reduce the number of inductances needed in the equivalent circuit and 
guarantee that all the inductances will be positive.
The values of a given by Eqs. C.7 and C.8 can be determined exper-
imentally from the magnetically coupled coils. To find the ratio M L1 , 
drive the coil with N1 turns using a sinusoidal voltage source and leave the

Example C.2 illustrates how to replace magnetically coupled coils 
with an equivalent circuit that includes an ideal transformer and positive 
inductor values.
EXAMPLE C.2
Consider the circuit we analyzed in part (b) of 
Example C.1, which replaced the magnetically cou-
pled coils in Fig. C.6 (with the polarity dot on the 
secondary winding moved to the bottom terminal) 
with a T-equivalent circuit. The equivalent circuit is 
shown in Fig. C.11 and must use a capacitor to rep-
resent the negative reactance. Repeat the analysis 
in Example C.1(b). but now replace the magneti-
cally coupled coils with the equivalent circuit in Fig. 
C.14(a).
 SOLUTION
From Example C.1(b) we know that L

1 =

 We need to calculate 
the coupling coefficient k, the turns ratio a, and the in-
ductor values for the equivalent circuit in Fig. C.14(a):

Note that in calculating the coupling coefficient, we 
ignore the sign of the mutual inductance because 
this sign represents the location of the polarity 
marks and has no effect on the amount of coupling 
between the coils.
Using the values we calculated, we can replace 
the magnetically coupled coils in Fig. C.6 with the 
equivalent circuit in Fig. C.14(a). Remember that 
the source frequency is 400 rad/sec. The result is the 
circuit in Fig. C.17. We have defined the currents 
and voltages for the ideal transformer, so we can 
write the equations for this circuit. There are three 
meshes, so we will write three KVL equations using 
the mesh currents I1, I a, and I b. Then we use the 
dot convention for ideal transformers to write the 
equations relating the phasor currents I a  and I b, 
and the phasor voltages Va and Vb:

The Decibel
The decibel was introduced by telephone engineers to characterize the 
power loss across the cascaded circuits used to transmit telephone sig-
nals. Figure D.1 defines the problem.
There, pi  is the power input to the system, p1 is the power output 
of circuit A, p2 is the power output of circuit B, and po is the power 
output of the system. The power gain of each circuit is the ratio of the 
power out to the power in. Thus

The log of a power ratio was named the bel, in honor of Alexander 
Graham Bell. Thus, we calculate the overall power gain, in bels, by 
summing the power gains, also in bels, of each segment of the trans-
mission system. In practice, the bel is an inconveniently large quantity. 
 One-tenth of a bel is a more useful measure of power gain—hence the 
decibel. The number of decibels equals 10 times the number of bels, so

When we use the decibel as a measure of power ratios, in some sit-

loading the circuit, as illustrated in Fig. D.2. When the input resistance 
equals the load resistance, we can convert the power ratio to either a 
voltage ratio or a current ratio:

The definition of the decibel used in Bode diagrams (see Appendix E) 
is borrowed from the results expressed by Eq. D.1, since these results 
apply to any transfer function involving a voltage ratio, a current ratio, 
a voltage-to-current ratio, or a current-to-voltage ratio. You should keep 
the original definition of the decibel firmly in mind because it is of funda-
mental importance in many engineering applications.
When you are working with transfer function amplitudes expressed in 
decibels, having a table that translates the decibel value to the actual value 
of the output/input ratio is helpful. Table D.1 gives some useful pairs. The 
ratio corresponding to a negative decibel value is the reciprocal of the 
positive ratio. For example, −3 dB corresponds to an output/input ratio 
of 1 1.41, or 0.707. Interestingly, −3 dB corresponds to the half-power 
frequencies of the filter circuits discussed in Chapters 14 and 15.
The decibel is also used as a unit of power when it expresses the ratio 
of a known power to a reference power. Usually, the reference power is 
1 mW, and the power unit is written dBm, which stands for “decibels rel-
ative to one milliwatt.” For example, a power of 20 mW corresponds to 
±13 dBm.
AC voltmeters commonly provide dBm readings that assume not only 
a 1 mW reference power but also a 600 Ω reference resistance (a value 
commonly used in telephone systems). Since a power of 1 mW in 600 Ω 
corresponds to 0.7746 V (rms), that voltage is read as 0 dBm on the meter. 
For analog meters, there usually is a 10 dB difference between adjacent 
ranges. Although the scales may be marked 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, and so on, in 
fact 3.16 V on the 3 V scale lines up with 1 V on the 1 V scale.
Some voltmeters provide a switch to choose a reference resistance (50, 
135, 600, or 900 Ω) or to select dBm or dBV (decibels relative to one volt).

APPENDIX 
Bode Diagrams
The frequency response plot is a very important tool for analyzing a 
circuit’s behavior. Up to this point, we have shown qualitative sketches 
of the frequency response without discussing how to create these plots. 
The best way to generate and plot the amplitude and phase data is to 
use a computer; we can rely on it to give us accurate numerical plots of 
ω
H j(
)  and θ
ω
j(
) versus ω . But we can create preliminary sketches of 
the frequency response using Bode diagrams.
A Bode diagram is a graphical technique that approximates a sys-
tem’s frequency response. These diagrams are named to recognize the 
pioneering work of H. W. Bode.1 They are most useful for systems 
whose transfer function poles and zeros are reasonably well separated.
A Bode diagram consists of two separate plots: One shows how the 
transfer function amplitude varies with frequency, and the other shows 
how the transfer function phase angle varies with frequency. The Bode 
diagram plots are constructed using semilog graph paper to accommo-
date a wide range of frequencies. In both the amplitude and phase plots, 
the frequency is plotted on the horizontal log scale. The amplitude and 
phase angle are plotted on the linear vertical scale.
 E.1  Real, First-Order Poles and Zeros

real and distinct. We introduce the procedure for constructing a Bode

 divide values associated with the poles and zeros of H s

form the multiplication and division into addition and subtraction if we

To construct a plot of Eq. E.3 versus frequency ω, we plot each term

cally. The terms in Eq. E.3 are easy to plot because they can be approxi-

Bode Diagrams
In these three equations, the plus sign applies to a first-order 
zero, and the minus sign applies to a first-order pole. The straight-line 
approximation of the amplitude plot is 0 dB at both the corner frequency 
and at one-half the corner frequency, and is ±6 dB at twice the corner  
frequency. Hence, the corrections are ±3 dB at the corner frequency and 
±1 dB at both  one-half the corner frequency and twice the corner fre-
quency. Figure E.6 summarizes these corrections.
If the poles and zeros of H s
( ) are widely separated, you can include 
these corrections into the overall amplitude plot and produce a reason-
ably accurate curve. However, if the poles and zeros are close together, 
the overlapping corrections are difficult to evaluate, so estimating the am-
plitude characteristic using the uncorrected straight-line plot is a better 
choice. Use a computer to create an accurate amplitude plot in the fre-
quency range of interest.
E.4 Straight-Line Phase Angle Plots
We can also use straight-line approximations to plot the transfer function 
phase angle versus frequency. Using the transfer function phase angle in 
Eq. E.2, we know that the phase angle associated with the constant Ko is 
zero, and the phase angle associated with a first-order zero or pole at the 
origin is a constant ±
°
90 . For a first-order zero or pole not at the origin, 
the straight-line approximations are as follows:
• For frequencies less than one-tenth the corner frequency, the phase 
angle is approximated by zero.
• For frequencies greater than 10 times the corner frequency, the 
phase angle is approximated by ±
°
90 .
• Between one-tenth the corner frequency and 10 times the corner 
frequency, the phase angle plot is a straight line with the value °
0  at 
one-tenth the corner frequency,  ±
°
45  at the corner frequency, and 
±
°
90  at 10 times the corner frequency.

Throughout, the plus sign applies to the first-order zero and the minus 
sign to the first-order pole. Figure E.7 depicts the straight-line approxima-
tion for a first-order zero and pole. The dashed curves show the exact plot 
of the phase angle versus frequency. Note how closely the straight-line 
plot approximates the actual phase angle plot. The maximum deviation 
between the straight-line plot and the actual plot is approximately °
6 .
We construct a phase angle plot using a straight-line approximation 
in Example E.2.

E.5  Bode Diagrams: Complex Poles 
and Zeros
We now consider how to construct a Bode diagram when the transfer 
function has complex poles and zeros. Let’s focus on constructing the am-
plitude and phase angle plots for a transfer function with a pair of com-
plex poles. Once you understand the rules for handling complex poles, 
you can apply these rules, with minor adjustments, to create plots for a 
pair of complex zeros.
The complex poles and zeros of H s
( ) always appear in conjugate 
pairs. When H s
( ) has complex poles, the first step in constructing a Bode 
diagram for H s
( ) is to combine the conjugate pair into a single quadratic 
term. Thus, for

The term ω n is the corner frequency of the quadratic term, and ζ  is the 
damping coefficient of the quadratic term. If ζ < 1, the roots of the qua-
dratic term are complex, and if ζ ≥1, the roots are real. Assuming that 
ζ < 1, we rewrite the transfer function as

E.7  Correcting Straig ht-Line Amplitude 
Plots for Complex Poles
Corrections to the straight-line amplitude plot for a pair of complex poles 
depend on the damping coefficient ζ . Figure E.10 shows the effect of ζ  on 
the amplitude plot. Note that when ζ  is very small, a large peak in the am-
plitude occurs in the neighborhood of the corner frequency ω
=
u
(

n
. 
When ζ ≥1
2, the corrected amplitude plot lies entirely below the 
straight-line approximation. The straight-line amplitude plot can be cor-
rected by locating four points on the actual curve. These four points cor-
respond to (1) one-half the corner frequency, (2) the frequency at which 
the amplitude reaches its peak value, (3) the corner frequency, and (4) the 
frequency at which the amplitude is zero.
At one-half the corner frequency (point 1), the actual amplitude is

Figure E.13 shows these four points, identified 
as follows:
• Point 1 has the coordinates (25rad s, 2.2 dB),
• Point 2 has the coordinates (47.96 rad s, 8.14 dB),
• Point 3 has the coordinates (50 rad s, 7.96 dB), 
and
• Point 4 has the coordinates (67.82 rad s, 0 dB).
Figure E.13 also shows the corrected plot, which 
is the dashed line that passes through these four 
points.
f) The amplitude plot in Fig. E.13 identifies the cir-
cuit as a low-pass filter. At the cutoff frequency, 
the magnitude of the transfer function, 
ω
H j(
)
c
, 
is 3 dB less than the maximum magnitude. From 
the corrected plot, the cutoff frequency appears 
to be about 80  rad s, almost the same as that 
predicted by the straight-line Bode diagram.

. The phase angle is zero at zero fre-
quency and is −
°
90  at the corner frequency. It approaches −
°
180  as ω  
(and, therefore, u) becomes large. As in the case of the amplitude plot, ζ   
determines the exact shape of the phase angle plot. Figure E.14 shows the 
effect of ζ  on the phase angle plot.
We can make a straight-line approximation of the phase angle plot for 
a pair of complex poles. We do so by drawing three line segments:
• For ω
ω
≤
ζ
−
(4.81
)
n, draw a horizontal line at 0°;
• For ω
ω
≥
ζ
(4.81 )

ζ

 degrees/decade (
ζ

Figure E.15 depicts the straight-line approximation for ζ = 0.3 and 
shows the actual phase angle plot. We see that the straight line is a good 
approximation of the actual curve near the corner frequency, but the 
error is quite large near the two points where the straight lines intersect. 
In Example E.4, we summarize our discussion of Bode diagrams.

e) Make a straight-line phase angle plot of

Figure E.17 shows the amplitude plot and includes the 
plots of the two terms that make up AdB.
c)  The straight-line amplitude plot in Fig. E.17 indicates 
that the circuit is a low-pass filter. At the cutoff fre-
quency, the amplitude of 
ω
H j(
) is 3 dB less than the 
amplitude in the passband. From the plot, we predict 
that the cutoff frequency is approximately 13rad s.
d)  To solve for the actual cutoff frequency, replace s with

line segment of θ ω

not have the same slope as the segment between 
2.5 and 100 rad s.
f) From the phase angle plot in Fig. E.18, we estimate 
the phase angle at the estimated cutoff frequency of 
13 rad s to be −
°
65 .

al cutoff frequency by substituting

Note the large error in the predicted angle. In general, 
straight-line phase angle plots do not give satisfactory 
results in the frequency band where the phase angle is 
changing. The straight-line phase angle plot is useful 
only in predicting the general behavior of the phase 
angle, not in estimating actual phase angle values at 
particular frequencies.

 Steps in the Node-Voltage Method and the Mesh-Current Method
Node-Voltage Method
Mesh-Current Method
Step 1
Identify nodes/meshes
Identify the essential nodes by circling them 
on the circuit diagram.
Identify the meshes by drawing directed 
arrows inside each mesh.
Step 2
Label node voltages/mesh currents
Recognize special cases
Pick and label a reference node; then label 
the remaining essential node voltages.
• If a voltage source is the only component 
in a branch connecting the reference 
node and another essential node, label 
the essential node with the value of the 
voltage source.
• If a voltage source is the only component 
in a branch connecting two  nonreference 
essential nodes, create a supernode that 
includes the voltage source and the two 
nodes on either side.
Label each mesh current.
• If a current source is in a single mesh, 
label the mesh current with the value of 
the current source.
• If a current source is shared by two 
adjacent meshes, create a supermesh by 
combining the two adjacent meshes and 
temporarily eliminating the branch that 
contains the current source.
Step 3
Write the equations
Write the following equations:
• A KCL equation for any supernodes;
• A KCL equation for any remaining 
essential nodes where the voltage is 
unknown;
• A constraint equation for each dependent 
able for the dependent source in terms of 
the node voltages;
• A constraint equation for each supernode 
that equates the difference between the 
two node voltages in the supernode to the 
voltage source in the supernode.
Write the following equations:
• A KVL equation for any supermeshes;
• A KVL equation for any remaining 
meshes where the current is unknown;
• A constraint equation for each dependent 
able for the dependent source in terms of 
the mesh currents;
• A constraint equation for each supermesh 
that equates the difference between the 
two mesh currents in the supermesh to 
the current source eliminated to form the 
supermesh.
Step 4
Solve the equations
Solve the equations to ﬁnd the node 
voltages.
Solve the equations to ﬁnd the mesh 
currents.
Step 5
Solve for other unknowns
Use the node voltage values to ﬁnd any 
unknown voltages, currents, or powers.
Use the mesh current values to ﬁnd any 
unknown voltages, currents, or powers.
