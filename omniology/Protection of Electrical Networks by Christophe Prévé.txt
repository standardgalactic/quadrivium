Definition 
 
Standard IEC 60038 defines voltage ratings as follows: 
– Low voltage (LV): for a phase-to-phase voltage of between 100 V and 1,000 V, 
the standard ratings are: 400 V - 690 V - 1,000 V (at 50 Hz). 
– Medium voltage (MV): for a phase-to-phase voltage between 1,000 V and  
35 kV, the standard ratings are: 3.3 kV - 6.6 kV - 11 kV - 22 kV - 33 kV. 
– High voltage (HV): for a phase-to-phase voltage between 35 kV and 230 kV, 
the standard ratings are: 45 kV - 66 kV - 110 kV - 132 kV - 150 kV - 220 kV. 
In this chapter we will look at: 
– types of HV and MV consumer substations; 
– structure of MV networks inside a site; 
– structure of LV networks inside a site; 
– structure of systems with a back-up power supply. 
Six standard examples of industrial network structures are given at the end of the 
chapter.  
Each structure is commented upon and divided up so that each functional aspect 
can be considered. 
(NC) means that the switch or circuit-breaker is closed in normal conditions. 
(NO) means that the switch or circuit-breaker is open in normal conditions.

Network Structures     13 
 
1.1. General structure of the private distribution network 
Generally, with an HV power supply, a private distribution network comprises 
(see Figure 1-1): 
– an HV consumer substation fed by one or more sources and made up of one or 
more busbars and circuit-breakers; 
– an internal generation source; 
– one or more HV/MV transformers; 
– a main MV switchboard made up of one or more busbars; 
– an internal MV network feeding secondary switchboards or MV/LV 
substations; 
– MV loads; 
– MV/LV transformers; 
– low voltage switchboards and networks; 
– low voltage loads. 
1.2. The supply source 
 
The power supply of industrial networks can be LV, MV or HV. The voltage 
rating of the supply source depends on the consumer supply power. The greater the 
power required, the higher the voltage must be. 
1.3. HV consumer substations 
 
The most usual supply arrangements adopted in HV consumer substations are: 
Single power supply (see Figure 1-2) 
 
 
Advantage: 
– reduced cost. 
 
 
Disadvantage:  
– low reliability. 
 
Note: the isolators associated with the HV circuit-breakers have not been shown.

Operating mode: 
 
– normal: 
- Both incoming circuit-breakers are closed, as well as the coupler isolator. 
- The transformers are thus simultaneously fed by two sources. 
 
– disturbed: 
- If one source is lost, the other provides the total power supply. 
 
 
Advantages: 
– Very reliable in that each source has a total network capacity. 
– Maintenance of the busbar possible while it is still partially operating. 
 
Disadvantages: 
 
– More costly solution. 
 
– Only allows partial operation of the busbar if maintenance is being carried out on it. 
 
Note: the isolators associated with the HV circuit-breakers have not been shown. 
Dual fed double bus system (see Figure 1-4) 
 
Operating mode: 
– normal: 
- Source 1 feeds busbar BB1 and feeders Out1 and Out2. 
- Source 2 feeds busbar BB2 and feeders Out3 and Out4. 
- The bus coupler circuit-breaker can be kept closed or open. 
– disturbed: 
- If one source is lost, the other provides the total power supply. 
- If a fault occurs on a busbar (or maintenance is carried out on it), the bus 
coupler circuit-breaker is tripped and the other busbar feeds all the outgoing lines. 
 
Advantages: 
– Reliable power supply. 
– Highly flexible use for the attribution of sources and loads and for busbar 
maintenance. 
– Busbar transfer possible without interruption. 
 
Disadvantage: 
– More costly in relation to the single busbar system. 
 
Note: the isolators associated with the HV circuit-breakers have not been shown.

1.4. MV power supply 
 
We shall first look at the different MV service connections and then at the MV 
consumer substation. 
1.4.1. Different MV service connections 
 
Depending on the type of MV network, the following supply arrangements are 
commonly adopted. 
Single line service (see Figure 1-5) 
 
The substation is fed by a single circuit tee-off from an MV distribution (cable 
or line). Transformer ratings of up to 160 kVA of this type of MV service is very 
common in rural areas. It has one supply source via the utility.

Figure 1-6: ring main service 

18     Protection of Electrical Networks 
 
Ring main units (RMU) are normally connected to form an MV ring main or 
loop (see Figures 1-20a and 1-20b).  
 
 
This arrangement provides the user with a two-source supply, thereby 
considerably reducing any interruption of service due to system faults or operational 
maneuvers by the supply authority. The main application for RMUs is in utility MV 
underground cable networks in urban areas.

Figure 1-7: duplicated supply service  
 
When an MV supply connection to two lines or cables originating from the same 
busbar of a substation is possible, a similar MV switchboard to that of an RMU is 
commonly used (see Figure 1-21).  
 
 
The main operational difference between this arrangement and that of an RMU 
is that the two incoming switches are mutually interlocked, in such a way that only 
one incoming switch can be closed at a time, i.e. its closure prevents that of the 
other. 
 
 
On loss of power supply, the closed incoming switch must be opened and the 
(formerly open) switch can then be closed. The sequence may be carried out 
manually or automatically. This type of switchboard is used particularly in networks 
of high load density and in rapidly expanding urban areas supplied by MV 
underground cable systems. 

Network Structures     19 
 
1.4.2. MV consumer substations 
 
The MV consumer substation may comprise several MV transformers and 
outgoing feeders. The power supply may be a single line service, ring main principle 
or parallel feeder (see section 1.4.1). 
 
 
Figure 1-8 shows the arrangement of an MV consumer substation using a ring 
main supply with MV transformers and outgoing feeders.

1.5. MV networks inside the site 
 
MV networks are made up of switchboards and the connections feeding them. 
We shall first of all look at the different supply modes of these switchboards, then 
the different network structures allowing them to be fed. 
1.5.1. MV switchboard power supply modes 
 
We shall start with the main power supply solutions of an MV switchboard, 
regardless of its place in the network. 
 
 
The number of sources and the complexity of the switchboard differ according 
to the level of power supply security required.

can be kept closed or open. If one source is lost, the coupler circuit-breaker is closed 
and the other source feeds both bus sections. If a fault occurs in a bus section (or 
maintenance is carried out on it), only one part of the outgoing feeders is no longer 
fed.

Operation: the power supply is normally provided by two parallel-connected 
sources. If one of these two sources is lost, the third provides a back-up supply. If a 
fault occurs on the busbar (or maintenance is carried out on it), the outgoing feeders 
are no longer fed.

Figure 1-13: 3 bus sections with couplers, 3 supply sources 
 
Operation: both bus coupler circuit-breakers can be kept open or closed. Each 
supply source feeds its own bus section. If one source is lost, the associated coupler 
circuit-breaker is closed, one source feeds two bus sections and the other feeds one 
bus section. If a fault occurs on one bus section (or if maintenance is carried out on 
it), only one part of the outgoing feeders is no longer fed. 
2 busbars, 2 connections per outgoing feeder, 2 supply sources (see Figure 1-14) 
 
Operation: each outgoing feeder can be fed by one or other of the busbars, 
depending on the state of the isolators which are associated with it, and only one 
isolator per outgoing feeder must be closed. 
 
 
For example, source 1 feeds busbar BB1 and feeders Out1 and Out2. Source 2 
feeds busbar BB2 and feeders Out3 and Out4. The bus coupler circuit-breaker can 
be kept closed or open during normal operation. If one source is lost, the other 
source takes over the total power supply. If a fault occurs on a busbar (or 
maintenance is carried out on it), the coupler circuit-breaker is opened and the other 
busbar feeds all the outgoing feeders.

24     Protection of Electrical Networks 
 
Operation: this arrangement is almost identical to the previous one (two busbars, 
two connections per feeder, two supply sources). The splitting up of the double 
busbars into two switchboards with coupler (via CB1 and CB2) provides greater 
operating flexibility. Each busbar feeds a smaller number of feeders during normal 
operation.

Figure 1-16: “duplex” distribution system 
 
Operation: each source can feed one or other of the busbars via its two drawout 
circuit-breaker cubicles. For economic reasons, there is only one circuit-breaker for 
the two drawout cubicles, which are installed alongside one another. It is thus easy 
to move the circuit-breaker from one cubicle to the other. Thus, if source 1 is to feed 
busbar BB2, the circuit-breaker is moved into the other cubicle associated with 
source 1. 
 
 
The same principle is used for the outgoing feeders. Thus, there are two drawout 
cubicles and only one circuit-breaker associated with each outgoing feeder. Each 
outgoing feeder can be fed by one or other of the busbars depending on where the 
circuit-breaker is positioned. 
 
 
For example, source 1 feeds busbar BB1 and feeders Out1 and Out2. Source 2 
feeds busbar BB2 and feeders Out3 and Out4. The bus coupler circuit-breaker can 

Network Structures     25 
 
be kept closed or open during normal operation. If one source is lost, the other 
source provides the total power supply. If maintenance is carried out on one of the 
busbars, the coupler circuit-breaker is opened and each circuit-breaker is placed on 
the busbar in service, so that all the outgoing feeders are fed. If a fault occurs on a 
busbar, it is put out of service. 
1.5.2. MV network structures 
 
We shall now look at the main MV network structures used to feed secondary 
switchboards and MV/LV transformers. The complexity of the structures differs, 
depending on the level of power supply security required. 
 
 
The following MV network supply arrangements are the ones most commonly 
adopted.

– The main switchboard is fed by 2 sources with coupler. 
– Switchboards 1 and 2 are fed by a single source, and there is no emergency 
back-up supply.  
– This structure should be used when service continuity is not a vital 
requirement and it is often adopted for cement works networks.

– Service continuity is good; the fact that there is no source coupler for 
switchboards 1 and 2 means that the network is less flexible to use.

– Switchboards 1 and 2 are fed by 2 sources with coupler. During normal 
operation, the bus coupler circuit-breakers are open. 
– Each bus section can be backed up and fed by one or other of the sources. 
– This structure should be used when good service continuity is required and it is 
often adopted in the iron and steel and petrochemical industries. 
Loop system  
 
This system should be used for widespread networks with large future 
extensions. There are two types depending on whether the loop is open or closed 
during normal operation.

– The main switchboard is fed by two sources with coupler. 
– The loop heads in A and B are fitted with circuit-breakers. 
– Switchboards 1, 2 and 3 are fitted with switches. 
– During normal operation, the loop is open (in the figure it is normally open at 
switchboard 2). 
– The switchboards can be fed by one or other of the sources. 
– Reconfiguration of the loop enables the supply to be restored upon occurrence 
of a fault or loss of a source (see section 10.1.7.1). 
– This reconfiguration causes a power cut of several seconds if an automatic 
loop reconfiguration control has been installed. The cut lasts for at least several 
minutes or dozens of minutes if the loop reconfiguration is carried out manually by 
operators.

– The main switchboard is fed by two sources with coupler. 
– All the loop switching devices are circuit-breakers. 
– During normal operation, the loop is closed. 
– The protection system ensures against power cuts caused by a fault 
(see section 10.1.8). 
 
This system is more efficient than the open loop system because it avoids power 
cuts. However, it is more costly since it requires circuit-breakers in each 
switchboard and a complex protection system.

– Switchboards 1, 2 and 3 can be backed up and fed by one or other of the 
sources independently. 
– The main switchboard is fed by two sources with coupler. 
– This structure should be used for widespread networks with limited future 
extensions and that require good supply continuity.

1.6. LV networks inside the site 
 
We shall first of all study the different low voltage switchboard supply modes. 
Next, we shall look at the supply schemes for switchboards backed up by generators 
or an uninterruptible power supply. 
1.6.1. LV switchboard supply modes 
 
We are now going to study the main supply arrangements for an LV 
switchboard, regardless of its place in the network. The number of supply sources 
possible and the complexity of the switchboard differ according to the level of 
supply security required.

Switchboards S1, S2 and S3 have only one supply source. The network is said to 
be of the arborescent radial type. If a switchboard supply source is lost, the 
switchboard is put out of service until the supply is restored.

During normal operation CB1 is closed and CB2 is open. Switchboard S2 is fed 
by the transformer. If the main source is lost, the following steps are carried out: 
1. The mains/standby changeover switch is operated and CB1 is tripped. 
2. Load shedding, if necessary, of part of the loads on the priority circuit in order 
to facilitate start-up of the generator. 
3. Start-up of the generator. 
4. CB2 is closed when the frequency and voltage of the generator are within the 
required ranges. 
5. Reloading of loads which may have been shed during step 2. 
Once the main source has been restored, the generator is stopped and the 
mains/standby changeover device switches the S2 supply to the mains.

Function 
Rectifier-
charger 
(1) 
Transforms the alternating voltage of a supply network into a 
direct voltage which will: 
– feed the inverter; 
– continually provide the charge for the storage battery.  
Storage 
battery 
(2) 
Provides a back-up supply to feed the inverter in case: 
– the supply network disappears (power cut); 
– the supply network is disturbed  
     (disturbances leading to insufficient quality). 
Inverter 
(3) 
Transforms the direct voltage from the rectifier-charger or storage 
battery into three-phase alternating voltage with more severe 
tolerances than those of the network (supplies an alternating 
current close to the theoretical sine curve). 
Static 
contactor 
(4) 
Switches over the load supply from the inverter to network 2 
(standby) without interruption (no cut due to mechanical 
switching device changeover time – the switchover is carried out 
using electronic components in a time < 1 ms). 
This switchover is performed if the inverter stops working for one 
of the following reasons: 
– switched off; 
– overload beyond the limiting capacities of the inverter; 
– internal anomaly. 
Manual 
by-pass  
(5) 
Manual switch which allows the user to be fed by network 2 
(standby), while maintenance is being carried out. 
Its presence is indispensable when the network frequencies 
upstream and downstream of the UPS are identical. 
Insulating 
transformer 
(6) 
Provides upstream and downstream insulation when the supply is 
via network 2. 
It is especially used when the upstream and downstream earthing 
systems are different.

Network incoming feeder(s) 
 
The terms network 1 and network 2 designate two independent incoming feeders 
on the same network: 
– network 1 (or mains) designates the incoming feeder usually supplying the 
rectifier-charger; 
– network 2 (or standby) is said to be a back-up feeder. 
 
The inverter’s frequency is synchronized with network 2, thereby allowing the 
load to be instantaneously fed by network 1 (in a time < 1 ms) via the static 
contactor. 
 
 
The connection of a UPS system to a second independent network is 
recommended since it increases the reliability of the system. It is nevertheless 
possible to have only one common incoming feeder. 
Example 1: LV switchboard backed up by an inverter, with a generator to 
eliminate the problem of the limited autonomy of the battery (usually about  
15 mn) (see Figure 1-30)

This configuration only allows an overall power capacity above that of a single 
rectifier/inverter unit. The power P  to be supplied is also divided between the two 
inverters. A fault in one of the units leads to the load being switched to network 2 
without interruption, except when the network is beyond its tolerance level.

Chapter 2 
Earthing Systems 
 
In any medium or low voltage three-phase system there are three single voltages 
measured between each phase and a common point called the “neutral point”. 
 
 
In actual fact, the neutral is the common point of three star-connected windings 
(see Figure 2-1). 
Ph1
Ph2
Ph3
neutral point
 
Figure 2-1: neutral point of a three-phase star system  
 
The neutral may or may not be accessible or distributed. Except in specific cases 
(e.g. networks in North America and Australia), the neutral is not distributed at 
medium voltage. However, the neutral is very often distributed at low voltage. 
 
 
In a medium or low voltage installation, the neutral may or may not be earthed. 
This is why we talk about the earthing system. 

54     Protection of Electrical Networks 
 
The neutral may be directly connected to earth or connected through a resistor or 
a reactor. In the first case, we say that the neutral is directly earthed and in the 
second case we say that it is impedance-earthed. 
 
 
When a connection has not been made between the neutral point and earth, we 
say that the neutral is unearthed. 
 
 
In a network, the earthing system plays a very important role. When an 
insulation fault occurs or a phase is accidentally earthed, the values taken by the 
fault currents, the touch voltages and overvoltages are closely linked to the type of 
neutral earthing connection. 
 
 
A directly earthed neutral strongly limits overvoltages but it causes very high 
fault currents, whereas an unearthed neutral limits fault currents to very low values 
but encourages the occurrence of high overvoltages. 
 
 
In any installation, service continuity in the event of an insulation fault is also 
directly related to the earthing system. An unearthed neutral permits service 
continuity during an insulation fault. Contrary to this, a directly earthed neutral, or 
low impedance-earthed neutral, causes tripping as soon as the first insulation fault 
occurs. 
 
 
The extent of the damage to some equipment, such as motors and generators 
presenting an internal insulation fault, also depends on the earthing system. 
 
 
In an earthed network, a machine affected by an insulation fault suffers 
extensive damage due to the large fault currents. 
 
 
However, in an unearthed or high impedance-earthed network, the damage is 
reduced, but the equipment must have an insulation level compatible with the level 
of overvoltages able to cope in this type of network. 
 
 
The choice of earthing system in both low voltage and medium voltage networks 
depends on the type of installation as well as the type of network. It is also 
influenced by the type of loads and service continuity required. 
2.1. Earthing systems at low voltage 
 
We shall first of all define the different low voltage earthing systems and then 
compare the advantages and disadvantages of each one. 

Earthing Systems     55 
 
2.1.1. Different earthing systems – definition and arrangements 
 
Earthing systems are governed by standard IEC 60364-3. There are three types 
of systems: IT, TT and TN. 
 
 
The first letter defines the neutral point in relation to earth: 
T 
directly earthed neutral

Specific characteristics: 
– Switching upon occurrence of a double fault is usually generated by phase-to-
phase fault protective devices (circuit-breakers, fuses, etc.). 
– If the short-circuit current is not large enough to activate protection against 
phase-to-phase faults, notably if the loads are far away, protection should be ensured 
by residual current devices (RCDs). 
– It is not advisable to distribute the neutral (see section 4.4.1.3). 
– It is compulsory to install an overvoltage limiter between the MV/LV 
transformer neutral point and earth. If the neutral is not accessible, the overvoltage 
limiter is installed between a phase and earth. It runs off external overvoltages, 
transmitted by the transformer, to the earth and protects the low voltage network 
from a voltage increase due to flashover between the transformer’s medium voltage 
and low voltage windings. 
– A group of individually earthed loads must be protected by an RCD.

Specific characteristics: 
– The installation of RCDs is compulsory. 
– All exposed conductive parts protected by the same protective device should 
be connected to the same earth. 
– The neutral earth and the exposed conductive part earth may or may not be 
interconnected or combined.

The neutral is directly earthed. 
Letter N 
 
The exposed conductive parts of the loads are connected to the neutral conductor. 
 
 
There are two types of systems, possibly depending on whether the neutral 
conductor and protective conductor (PE) are combined or not: 
– Case 1: The neutral and protective conductors are combined in a single 
conductor called PEN. The system is identified by a third letter C and is called TNC 
(see Figure 2-4). Earthing connections must be evenly placed along the length of the 
PEN conductor to avoid potential rises in the exposed conductive parts if a fault 
occurs. This system must not be used for copper cross-sections of less than 10 mm² 
and aluminium cross-sections of less than 16 mm², as well as downstream of a TNS 
system (see IEC 60364-5, section 546-2). Nor must it be used for moveable 
trunkings (see IEC 60364-4, section 413.1.3.2). 
– Case 2: The neutral conductor and protective conductor are separate. The 
system is identified by a third letter S and is called TNS (see Figure 2-5). Earthing 
connections must be evenly placed along the length of the protection conductor PE 
to avoid potential rises in the exposed conductive parts if a fault occurs. This system 
must not be used upstream of a TNC system.

Specific characteristics of TNS and TNC systems:

Note: both TNS and TNC systems can be used in the same installation. The TNC 
system (4 wires), however, must never be downstream of the TNS system (5 wires). 
2.1.2. Comparison of different earthing systems in low voltage 
 
The three earthing systems are different in the way they operate and afford 
protection. Each has its advantages and disadvantages which we shall now consider. 
2.1.2.1. Unearthed or impedance-earthed neutral (IT system) (see Figure 2-2) 
 
Operating technique: 
– Permanent insulation monitoring. 
– First insulation fault indication. 
– Compulsory fault location and clearance. 
– Switching if two insulation faults occur at the same time (double fault). 
 
Technique for protecting persons: 
– Interconnection and earthing of exposed conductive parts. 
– First fault monitoring by a permanent insulation monitor (see section 2.4.1). 
– Switching upon occurrence of the second fault by overcurrent protective 
devices (circuit-breakers or fuses). 
 
Advantages: 
– System providing the best service continuity during use. 
– When an insulation fault occurs, the short-circuit current is very low. 

Earthing Systems     59 
 
 
Disadvantages: 
– Requires maintenance personnel to monitor the system during use. 
– Requires a good level of network insulation (which means that the network 
must be broken up if widespread, and that loads with high leakage current must be 
supplied by insulating transformers). 
– Tripping checks for two simultaneous faults should be carried out if possible 
when the network is being designed using calculation, and must be performed 
during commissioning using measurement. 
– Overvoltage limiters must be installed. 
– Requires all the installation’s exposed conductive parts to be equipotentially 
bonded; if this is not possible RCDs must be installed. 
– Avoid distributing the neutral conductor. In the IT system, it is in fact 
recommended not to distribute the neutral for the following reasons: 
- if the neutral conductor is distributed, a fault affecting it will eliminate the 
advantages attached to the IT system; 
- if the neutral is distributed, it must be protected (except for specific cases); 
- the fact of not distributing the neutral facilitates the choice of overcurrent 
protective devices (see section 4.4.1.3) and fault location. 
– Locating faults is difficult in widespread networks. 
– When an insulation fault in relation to the earth occurs, the voltage of the two 
unaffected phases in relation to the earth takes on the value of the phase-to-phase 
voltage (see section 7.16). Equipment must therefore be selected with this in mind. 
2.1.2.2. Directly earthed neutral (TT system) 
 
Operating technique: 
– Switching upon occurrence of the first insulation fault. 
 
Technique for protecting persons: 
– Earthing of exposed conductive parts combined with the compulsory use of 
RCDs (at least one at the head of the installation). 
– All exposed conductive parts protected by the same RCD must be connected to 
the same earth. 
– Simultaneously accessible exposed conductive parts must be connected to the 
same earth. 
 
Advantages: 
– The simplest system to design, implement, monitor and use. 

60     Protection of Electrical Networks 
– Does not require permanent monitoring during use (only a periodic inspection 
test of the RCDs may be necessary). 
– Moreover, the presence of RCDs prevents the risk of fire when their sensitivity 
is below or equal to 500 mA (see standard IEC 60364-4, section 482.2.10). 
– Easy location of faults. 
– Upon occurrence of an insulation fault, the short-circuit current is small. 
 
Disadvantages: 
– Switching upon occurrence of the first insulation fault. 
– Use of an RCD on each outgoing feeder to obtain total selectivity. 
– Special measures must be taken for the loads or parts of the installation 
causing high leakage currents during normal operation in order to avoid spurious 
tripping (feed the loads by insulating transformers or use high threshold RCDs, 
compatible with the exposed conductive part earth resistance). 
2.1.2.3. Connecting the exposed conductive parts to the neutral (TNC – TNS systems) 
 
Operating technique: 
– Switching upon occurrence of the first insulation fault. 
 
Technique for protecting persons: 
– Imperative interconnection and earthing of exposed conductive parts. 
– Switching on occurrence of the first fault via an overcurrent protective device 
(circuit-breaker or fuse). 
 
Advantages: 
– The TNC system may be less costly upon installation (elimination of one 
switchgear pole and one conductor). 
– Use of overcurrent protective devices to ensure protection against indirect 
contact. 
 
Disadvantages: 
– Switching on occurrence of the first insulation fault. 
– The TNC system involves the use of fixed and rigid trunkings (see section 
413.1.3.2 of standard IEC 60364-4). 
– Requires earthing connections to be evenly placed in the installation so that the 
protective conductor remains at the same potential as the earth. 
– A tripping check on occurrence of the insulation fault should be carried out, if 
possible, when the network is being designed using calculations, and must be 
performed during commissioning using measurements; this check is the only 

Earthing Systems     61 
 
guarantee that the system operates both on commissioning and during operation, as 
well as after any kind of work on the network (modification, extension). 
– Passage of the protective conductor in the same trunkings as the live 
conductors of the corresponding circuits. 
– Often requires extra equipotential bonding. 
– Third and multiples of third harmonics circulate in the protective conductor 
(TNC system). 
– The fire risk is higher and, moreover, it cannot be used in places presenting a 
fire risk (TNC system). 
– Upon occurrence of an insulation fault, the short-circuit current is high and 
may cause damage to equipment or electromagnetic disturbance. 
2.2. Medium voltage earthing systems 
 
We shall first define the different medium voltage earthing systems and then 
compare the advantages and disadvantages of each one.

2.2.2. Comparison of different medium voltage earthing systems 
 
The various earthing systems in medium voltage systems are different in the way 
they operate and each has its advantages and disadvantages, which we shall now 
consider. 
2.2.2.1. Direct earthing (see Table 2-1(a)) 
 
Operating technique: 
 
– Compulsory switching on occurrence of the first insulation fault. 
 
Advantages: 
 
– Reduces the risk of overvoltages occurring. 
 
– Authorizes the use of equipment with a normal phase to earth insulating level. 
 
Disadvantages: 
 
– Compulsory tripping upon occurrence of the first fault. 
 
– Very high fault currents leading to maximum damage and disturbance 
(creation of induced currents in telecommunication networks (see section 5.7) and 
auxiliary circuits). 
 
– The risk for personnel is high while the fault lasts; the touch voltages which 
develop being high. 
 
– Requires the use of differential protection devices (see section 7.6) so that the 
fault clearance time is not long. These systems are costly. 
2.2.2.2. Unearthed (see Table 2-1(b)) 
 
Operating technique: 
 
– No switching on occurrence of the first insulation fault – it is thus compulsory: 
 
- to carry out permanent insulation monitoring; 
 
- to indicate the first insulation fault; 
 
- to locate and clear the first insulation fault; 
 
- to switch upon occurrence of the second insulation fault (double fault). 
 
Advantages: 
 
– Provides continuity of service by only tripping upon occurrence of the second 
fault, subject to the network capacity not leading to a high earth fault current that 
would be dangerous for personnel and loads on occurrence of the first fault. 
 

64     Protection of Electrical Networks 
 
Disadvantages: 
– The unearthed neutral involves: 
 
- the use of equipment whose phase-to-earth insulation level is at least equal to 
that of the phase-to-phase level; indeed, when a permanent phase-earth fault occurs, 
the voltage of both unaffected phases in relation to earth takes on the value of the 
phase-to-phase voltage if tripping is not triggered on occurrence of the first fault 
(see section 7.16); cables, rotating machines, transformers and loads must therefore 
be chosen with this in mind; 
 
- the risk of high internal overvoltages making it advisable to reinforce the 
equipment insulation; 
 
- the compulsory insulation monitoring, with visual and audible indication of 
the first fault if tripping is not triggered until the second fault occurs; 
 
- the presence of maintenance personnel to monitor and locate the first fault 
during use; 
 
- some difficulties implementing selective protection devices upon occurrence 
of the first fault (see section 7.4.3, directional earth fault protection); 
 
- the risk of ferro-resonance.  
2.2.2.3. Limiting resistance earthing (see Table 2-1(c)) 
 
Operating technique: 
 
– Switching upon occurrence of the first fault. 
 
Advantages: 
– Limits fault currents (reduced damage and disturbance). 
– Dampens overvoltages of internal origin in that the limiting current IA is twice 
as high as the capacitive current IC giving I

A > 2
. 
– Does not require the use of equipment, and in particular cables, having a 
special phase/earth insulation level. 
– Allows the use of simple selective protection devices. 
 
Disadvantages: 
– Tripping on the first fault. 
2.2.2.4. Limiting reactance earthing (see Table 2-1(d)) 
 
Operating technique: 
– Switching upon occurrence of the first insulation fault.

– The coil, being of low resistance, does not have to dissipate a high heat load. 
 
Disadvantages:

– Compulsory tripping upon occurrence of the first fault. 
2.2.2.5. Petersen coil earthing (see Table 2-1(e)) 
 
Operating technique: 
– No switching upon occurrence of the first fault. 
 
Advantages: 
 
– If the reactance is such that

current is zero: 
- spontaneous clearance of non-permanent earth faults; 
- the installation continues to operate in spite of there being a permanent fault, 
with tripping necessarily occurring on the second fault; 
- the first fault is indicated by the detection of the current flowing through the 
coil. The coil is dimensioned so that permanent operation is possible. 
 
Disadvantages: 
 
– Difficulties establishing the condition

 due to uncertain 
knowledge of the network’s capacity: the result is that throughout the duration of 
the fault, a residual current circulates in the fault. Care must be taken to make sure 
this current is not dangerous for personnel and equipment. 
 
– The risk of overvoltages occurring is high. 
 
– Requires the presence of monitoring personnel.

2.3. Creating neutral earthing  
2.3.1. MV installation resistance earthing 
Earthing when the neutral is accessible 
 
A resistor is inserted between the neutral outlet terminal and the earthing 
connection, either directly (see Figure 2-6(a)), or via a single-phase transformer 
connected to the secondary via an equivalent resistor (see Figure 2-6(b)). This 
system is applied when the network is fed by a transformer with a star-connected 
secondary and an accessible neutral, or by a generator with an accessible neutral.

Earthing by creating an artificial neutral 
 
When the source neutral is not accessible (delta winding), the system is earthed 
by creating an artificial neutral (also referred to as an earthing transformer). 
 
 
The artificial neutral can also be used when there are several parallel sources. 
 
 
The earthing transformer can be made in various ways: 
– using a star-delta transformer, the limiting resistor is connected between the 
primary neutral point and earth, the delta being closed in on itself (see Figure  
2-7(a)); 
– sing a star-delta transformer whose primary neutral point is directly earthed, a 
fault current limiting resistor is inserted in the secondary delta (see Figure 2-7(b)). 
This system is economically preferable in case (a) since the resistor is in LV and not 
in MV; 
– using a zig-zag coil, the limiting resistor being connected between the neutral 
point of the coil and earth (see Figure 2-7(c)); 

Earthing Systems     67 
 
– using a neutral point transformer, this type of earthing transformer includes an 
extra winding which creates a power outlet: for example, a primary star winding 
with earthed neutral, a secondary delta winding closed by a fault current limiting 
resistor and another secondary star winding allowing the loads as well as the 
auxiliaries of an HV/MV substation to be fed (see Figure 2-7(d)). 
– the systems adopted the most often are (b) and (c).

Problem of resistance earthing when several transformers operate in parallel on 
one busbar 
Case 1: Each transformer has a non-disconnectable earthing resistor. 
The earth fault current varies according to the number of transformers in service 
(see Figure 2-8a), which may pose difficulties for the motors or for setting the 
threshold of earth fault protection devices. Moreover, directional earth fault 
protection devices must be used (see section 7.4) to locate faults coming from 
connections linking the transformers to the busbars (see section 10.1.5.2). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2-8a: direct earthing of each neutral point 
Case 2: Each transformer has a disconnectable earthing resistor.  
A switching device makes it possible to have a single earthed neutral point 
whatever the number of transformers in service (see Figure 2-8b). The protective 
system is complex since it uses logical selectivity, taking into account the position 
of the switching devices and the state of the different earth fault protection devices. 
 
This system is used very little.

Case 3: No transformer has an earthing resistor. 
An artificial neutral point is created on the main switchboard busbar (see 
Figure 2-9). This method eliminates the problems of cases 1 and 2. Indeed, the fault 
current is constant, whatever the number of transformers in service; the protection 
devices to be implemented are simple since they do not require the use of directional 
or complex logic protection devices (see section 10.1.5.2).

Problem of resistance earthing when several transformers operate in parallel on 
two busbars 
 
The two busbars may or may not be coupled depending on the operating mode. 
It is therefore necessary to install an artificial neutral on each busbar. When the 
busbars are separate, the two neutral points are in service. When the two busbars are 
coupled, only one artificial neutral must be connected (see Figure 2-10) so that the 
fault current is not doubled. A control logic must then be installed to put one of the 
two artificial neutrals out of service when the coupler circuit-breaker is closed. This 
logic may be indispensable when some loads, especially motors, cannot withstand 
high fault currents.

2.3.2. Reactance or Petersen coil earthing of an MV installation 
 
The method of using an accessible neutral or creation of an artificial neutral is 
identical to that used for resistance earthing except that a reactor is used instead of a 
resistor (see Figures 2-6 and 2-7). 
2.3.3. Direct earthing of an MV or LV installation  
 
The neutral must be accessible and is directly earthed. 
2.4. Specific installation characteristics in LV unearthed systems 
 
As we saw in section 2.1.2.1, the LV unearthed system requires permanent 
insulation monitoring, first fault location and an overvoltage limiter. We shall now 
look at how this is done. 
When the coupler circuit-breaker is 
closed, one of the neutral points 
disappears 

Earthing Systems     71 
 
2.4.1. Installing a permanent insulation monitor (see Figure 2-11) 
 
In an unearthed system, a device must permanently monitor the insulation level 
so that a fault does not last indefinitely. This is necessary to avoid any partial 
deterioration of equipment over the course of time and avoid tripping if a second 
insulation fault occurs (this would constitute a phase-to-phase fault). The first fault 
must be located and cleared by operating personnel. 
 
 
The permanent insulation monitor ensures insulation monitoring. 
 
 
It applies a direct voltage between the neutral and earth, or on a phase if the 
neutral is not accessible, which creates a leakage current in the insulation resistors 
whatever the cable capacities (with direct current, the capacitors have an infinite 
impedance). If an insulation fault occurs, a direct current flows through the monitor 
and causes an alarm to go off. 
2.4.2. Installing an overvoltage limiter (see Figure 2-11) 
 
The job of an overvoltage limiter is to run off to earth dangerous overvoltages 
that are likely to occur, such as a lightning impulse or flashover between the MV 
and LV windings of a transformer. 
 
 
It is installed between the neutral and earth of a transformer or between a phase 
and earth if the neutral is not accessible.

2.4.3. Location of earth faults by a low frequency generator (2–10 Hz) 
 
This device allows earth faults to be located while energized (see Figure 2-12). 

72     Protection of Electrical Networks 
 
A low frequency generator between 2 and 10 Hz (1) injects a current between 
the network and the earth. When an insulation fault occurs on an outgoing feeder, a 
low frequency leakage current is run off to earth. This current can be detected: 
– manually using a clip-on ammeter (2) connected to a selective amplifier (3) 
tuned to the generator frequency. Each feeder is thus tested until the amplifier 
detects a current. 
– by Tore transformers (4) (see section 7.2) installed on each outgoing feeder. 
These are connected to a selective switch (5) which determines the faulty feeder. 
– The switch is connected to a selective amplifier (3) tuned to the generator 
frequency. 
 
Note: an injection of direct current cannot be used to locate an earth fault since a 
tore transformer or clip-on ammeter can only detect alternating current. The 
selective amplifier is generally able to discriminate between a resistive current due 
to an insulation fault and the capacitive current of a healthy feeder (if a fault occurs, 
the healthy feeders have a capacitive current proportional to the cable capacity 
(see section 4.3)). If the selective amplifier cannot perform this task, the capacitive 
currents of some healthy feeders (the longer ones) are likely to be as great as the 
fault current, thereby making it difficult to locate the fault. The Vigilohm range 
from Schneider can perform this task and furthermore it is insensitive to harmonic 
disturbances.

2.5. Specific installation characteristics of an MV unearthed system 
 
As shown in section 2.2.2.1, the MV unearthed system must be fitted with 
insulation monitoring and first insulation fault location. 
2.5.1. Insulation monitoring 
 
This can be done using residual overvoltage protection or an insulation monitor. 
 
Insulation monitoring via residual overvoltage protection (see section 7.16) 
 
This detects a rise in neutral point potential which is characteristic of an earth 
fault. 
Insulation monitoring via an insulation monitor 
 
The insulation monitor applies a direct voltage between the neutral and earth, or 
between a phase and earth if the neutral is not accessible. If an insulation fault 
occurs, a direct current goes through the monitor, causing an alarm to go off. 
 
 
The monitor is connected to the network via voltage transformers, so that the 
voltage applied to it is not too high. 
 
 
In the case of an accessible neutral, it is connected to the voltage transformer 
primary measuring the neutral potential (see Figure 2-13).

For Schneider equipment, a standard plate is connected in parallel and is made

– a capacitor allowing the neutral potential of the voltage transformers to be 
fixed to earth without the direct current injected by the monitor being shunted; 
– an overvoltage limiter allowing overvoltages to be run off to earth; 
– a resistor allowing the voltage withstood by the monitor to be reduced. 
Note: the voltage transformers must be loaded to avoid ferro-resonance phenomena 
from occurring in an unearthed system. This is what the secondary-connected r 
resistors are used for (see Figures 2-13 and 2-14). 

Earthing Systems     75 
 
 
If there are other star-connected voltage transformers in the same network, the 
following must be installed: 
– a capacitor between the neutral of the voltage transformers and earth so that 
the monitor does not deliver a direct current via the voltage transformers (if this was 
the case, it would continually detect a fault). The advisable value of the capacitor is 
2.5 µF with an insulation voltage of 1,600 V. 
– an overvoltage limiter allowing overvoltages to be run off to earth. 
 
When two networks with an insulation monitor can be coupled, a logic must be 
made so that the two monitors cannot operate in parallel because, if they did, one 
would deliver current into the other and they would continually detect a fault.  
2.5.2. Location of the first insulation fault 
 
This can be done in one of two of the following ways: 
– by an efficient selectivity system (see sections 10.1.4.2, 10.1.5.2 and 10.1.6.2); 
– by successive tripping of each feeder until the fault is cleared. 
 
 
The latter method is not recommended as it leads to switching on the healthy 
feeders and overvoltages able to generate a double fault.

3.1. Short-circuits 
3.1.1. Short-circuit characteristics 
 
Short-circuits can be defined according to three main characteristics: 
 
– Their origin: 
- they may be mechanical: breakdown of conductors or accidental electrical 
connection between two conductors via a foreign body such as a tool or animal; 
- they may be electrical: following the degradation of the insulation between 
phases, or between phase and frame or earth, or resulting from internal overvoltages 
(switching surges) or atmospheric overvoltages (stroke of lightning); 
- they may be due to an operating error: earthing of a phase, connection 
between two different voltage supplies or different phases or closing of a switching 
device by mistake. 
 
– Their location: 
- the short-circuit may be generated inside equipment (cable, motor, 
transformer, switchboard, etc.), and it generally leads to deterioration; 
- the short-circuit may be generated outside equipment (cable, motor, 
transformer, switchboard, etc.). The consequences are limited to disturbances which 
may, in the course of time, lead to deterioration of the equipment in question and 
thereby cause an internal fault. 
 

78     Protection of Electrical Networks 
 
– Their duration: 
- self-extinguishing: the fault disappears on its own; 
- fugitive: the fault disappears due to the action of protective devices and does 
not reappear when the equipment is started up again (the fault is “burnt out” after re-
energization); 
- permanent: these faults require de-energization of a cable, machine, etc., and 
intervention by the operating personnel.

3.1.3. Causes of short-circuits 
 
– Degradation of insulating materials due to: 
- degradation in surface quality (pollution); 
- excessive temperature; 
- partial discharge in the vacuoles (micropockets) inside the insulating 
materials. 
                                            
* The percentages given are for guidance only. They come from fault statistics on public 
distribution networks. The order of magnitudes must be approximately equivalent in 
industrial networks. It may be observed therefore that phase-to-earth short circuits are the 
ones most frequently occurring and that three-phase faults are fairly rare. 

80     Protection of Electrical Networks 
– Accidental reduction in electrical insulation (presence of animals, tree 
branches, tools left by carelessness on a busbar, etc.). 
– Destruction due to external causes (hit by a shovel, etc.). 
– Overvoltages causing a breakdown in equipment insulation (switching surges 
or lightning strike). 
3.2. Other types of faults 
 
– On motors: 
- too many successive start-ups leading to overheating and mechanical shocks 
on couplings; 
- excessive start-up time or rotor locking leading to the same result; 
 
– On generators: 
- loss of excitation due to a fault in the rotor circuit (cut, short-circuit, etc.), 
leading to overheating of the rotor and stator and loss of synchronism with the 
network; 
- variations in frequency due to an overload or faulty operation of a frequency 
regulator (for a generator operating cut-off from the utility network). 
– Phase opposition connection of a generator with the network or of two parts of 
a network coming from different sources. 
– Overvoltages due to a lightning strike. 
– Switching surges (of a switch or circuit-breaker). 
– Overloads on cables, transformers, motors or generators. 
– Reversal of the direction of energy flow in the absence of an electrical fault. In 
the event of a power cut or a drop in voltage caused by the utility, an internal 
generation plant may supply energy to the utility. 
– Variations in voltage due to faulty operation of the on-load tap changers of a 
transformer, or network under or overload. 
– The presence of a negative-phase component due to a non-symmetrical voltage 
source, a large single-phase consumer, a connection error or phase cutting leads to 
overheating of the motors or generators, and a loss in generator synchronism.  

Chapter 4 
Short-circuits 
All electrical installations must be protected against short-circuits every time there 
is an electrical connection, which is generally when there is a change in conductor 
cross-section. The short-circuit current value must be calculated at every stage of 
installation for different possible network configurations. This is done to determine the 
characteristics of the equipment that must withstand or switch the fault current. 
 
In order to choose the appropriate switching devices (circuit-breakers or fuses) 
and set the protection functions, four short-circuit values must be known: 
The root mean square value of the maximum short-circuit current (symmetrical 
three-phase short-circuit) 
This determines: 
– the breaking capacity of the circuit-breakers and fuses; 
– the temperature stress that the equipment must withstand. 
 
It corresponds to a short-circuit in the immediate vicinity of the downstream 
terminals of the switching device. It must be calculated to include a good safety 
margin (maximum value). 
The peak value of the maximum short-circuit current (value of the first peak of 
the transient period) 
This determines: 
– the making capacity of the circuit-breakers and switches; 
– the electrodynamic withstand of the trunkings and switchgear. 

82    Protection of Electrical Networks 
The minimum phase-to-phase short-circuit current 
This must be known in order to choose the tripping curve of the circuit-breakers 
or fuses or set the thresholds of the overcurrent protection devices, especially when: 
– the cables are long or when the source has a relatively high internal impedance 
(e.g. generators); 
– protection of persons relies on the phase overcurrent protective devices 
operating. This is essentially the case in low voltage for TN or IT earthing systems; 
– the network requires a study of protection selectivity. 
The value of the phase-to-earth short-circuit current 
It mainly depends on the earthing system and determines the setting of earth 
fault protections. 
4.1. Establishment of short-circuit currents and wave form 
The network upstream of a short-circuit can be shown in the form of an 
equivalent diagram having one constant alternating voltage source E  and a series 
impedance Zsc (see Figure 4-1). 
 
Zsc represents the sum of cable, line and transformer impedances through which 
the short-circuit current flows. Each impedance must be recalculated for voltage E  
basis.

The real short-circuit current Isc  is established according to a transient state 
having a non-periodic component and a higher amplitude than during the steady 
state. 
 
We shall consider two cases because the transient state differs according to 
whether the short-circuit is located on the power utility’s supply (in this case the 
generators are far enough apart for their effects to be ignored), or whether it is 
located at the terminals of a generator.

Conclusion 
When a short-circuit occurs in an installation fed by a distribution network (far 
from the generators), a transient current occurs which lasts for several periods, i.e. 
between 20 and 80 ms. However, when circuit-breakers are not time-delayed, they 
generally have a lower tripping time than the duration of the aperiodic current and 
should therefore be able to break the aperiodic component (see section 8.2 for MV 
circuit-breakers and section 8.1 for LV circuit-breakers). For LV circuit-breakers, 
the breaking capacity is defined in relation to 
2
2
cos
R
X
R
ϕ =
+
 (Table 8-2). 
The peak value of the transient current is 1.6 to 2.5 times higher than the short-
circuit current value in steady-state conditions. It determines the electrodynamic 
forces that the trunkings and switchgear must withstand and the making capacity of 
the switching devices (see section 5.2). 
4.1.2. Establishment of the short-circuit current at the terminals of a generator 
It is assumed that the short-circuit is close enough to the generator for the cable 
impedance to be ignored compared with the generator impedance. 
 
Calculations on transient states of synchronous machines show that the current is 
expressed by:

The aperiodic component has a high value but a very short duration, from 10 to 
60 ms (see Tables 4-3, 4-4 and 4-5 showing the aperiodic time constant values Ta ). 
 
For the damped sinusoidal component, the electrical variables evolve as if the 
machine reactance was variable and developed according to the three following 
periods: 
– subtransient ( Xd
" ): lasting 10 to 20 ms after the start of the fault; 
– transient ( Xd
' ): lasting up to 100 to 400 ms; 
– synchronous ( Xd ): synchronous reactance to be considered after the transient 
period. 
 
Let us note that in the order given, this reactance takes a higher value for each 
period:  
Xd
"  < Xd
'  < Xd  
This leads to a gradual decrease in the short-circuit current. 
 
The short-circuit current is thus the sum of four components (see Figure 4-4).

It should be noted that the decrease in generator reactance is faster than that of 
the aperiodic component. This rare case may raise switching difficulties for the 
circuit-breakers and saturation problems for the magnetic circuits as the current does 
not reach zero until after several periods.

Holding the short-circuit current at approximately 3 In  for several seconds 
 
When the subtransient and transient periods are over, i.e. after a time of 0.5 to 
1 second, the short-circuit current is lower than the nominal current, i.e. from 0.3 to  
0.5 In  (see Table 4-6). 
 
 
The values given above are design values. 
 
 
In practice, manufacturers like Leroy-Somer have methods for holding the short-
circuit current at approximately 3 In  for several seconds to allow the protective 
devices to operate when they are time-delayed, for selectivity reasons, for a time 
greater than Td
'  ≈ 100 ms. The holding value 3 In  is close to the current value 
during the transient period where: 
'
d
sc
X
E
I
≈
 where Xd
'  ≈ 30% 
Isc  is thus close to 3 In . 
 
When the current is not held at 3 In , protection against short-circuits may be 
provided by voltage restrained overcurrent protection (see section 7.24). 
 
 
Note: the method generally used to hold the short-circuit current at 3 In  is 
compound excitation, i.e. series-parallel excitation. The parallel voltage drops when 
a short-circuit occurs, leading to a drop in parallel excitation; the short-circuit 
current, however, is higher than the nominal current and the series excitation 
increases. Combined, the two phenomena lead to a short-circuit current held at 3 In  
for several seconds. 
4.2. Short-circuit current calculating method 
 
The short-circuit current calculating method presented in this document is the 
impedance method. It is applied to calculations by hand and produces sufficiently 
accurate results for most applications. 
 
 
It helps with the understanding of more accurate methods, such as IEC 60909, 
which are generally applied using computer software programs. 
 
 
The aim of this section is to give all the elements needed to calculate the 
following short-circuits:  
– symmetrical three-phase fault; 

Short-circuits     93 
– phase-to-earth fault; 
– phase-to-phase fault clear of earth; 
– two-phase-to-earth fault;  
 
 
at any point in a network.  
 
 
A detailed calculation of the symmetrical three-phase short-circuit at different 
points in a network is provided as an example at the end of section 4.2.1. 
4.2.1. Symmetrical three-phase short-circuit 
 
This fault corresponds to that shown in Figure 3-4. 
 
 
In general, it causes the greatest fault currents. It must therefore be calculated for 
the appropriate equipment to be chosen (maximum current and electrodynamic 
stress to be withstood). 
 
 
The three-phase short-circuit current calculation is simple due to the symmetrical 
nature of the short-circuit. The short-circuit current has the same value in each 
phase. A calculation can thus be made using an equivalent single-phase diagram of 
the network upstream of the short-circuit (see Figure 4-5), as can be done under 
normal operating conditions.

In practice, the equivalent supply source impedance is calculated first (power 
supply provided by the utility or generator), then the impedances of each 
transformer, cable or line through which the fault flows. 
 
 
Each impedance must be recalculated for the voltage level of the presumed fault 
(see section 4.2.1.1). 
 
Note: in medium and high voltage, standard IEC 60909 (Table 1) applies a 
coefficient of 1.1 to the nominal voltage in order to calculate the maximum short-
circuit current, thereby giving:

Instead of giving the impedance value of transformers in ohms, the manufacturer 
gives the short-circuit voltage U sc  expressed as a percentage.

Generator power supply impedance 
 
In section 4.1.2, we saw that the short-circuit current developed in the following 
three periods: 
i) subtransient ( Xd

ii) transient ( Xd
' ): lasting up to 100 to 400 ms; 
iii) synchronous ( Xd ): synchronous reactance to be considered after the 
transient period;

this value. If this is not the case, restrained voltage overcurrent protection is used 
(see section 7.24):

L: length of the link in m 
 
S : cross-section of the conductor in mm2 
 
ρ : resistivity of the conductor material 
 

Short-circuits     105 
 
In order to take into account the temperature of the conductor material during the 
short-circuit, the resistivity ρ  is taken to be equal to:  
 
– 1.25 times the resistivity of the conductors at 20°C when calculating the 
maximum 
short-circuit 
currents, 
i.e. 
0.0225 Ω mm2/m 
for 
copper 
and  
0.036 Ω mm2/m for aluminum. 
 
– 1.5 times the resistivity of the conductors at 20°C when calculating the 
minimum short-circuit currents, i.e. 0.027 Ω mm2/m for copper and 0.043 Ω mm2/m 
for aluminum.

4.2.1.5. Contribution of motors to the short-circuit current value 
 
When a short-circuit occurs, the motors feed the fault for a period corresponding 
to the flux clearance. The currents supplied by the motors are added to the current 
supplied by the source. The short-circuit current value is the algebraic sum of the 
currents supplied by the motors and sources (the phase angles between the currents 
are neglected and the algebraic sum maximizes the current value). 
Synchronous motors 
 
These contribute to the short-circuit current value in the same way as the 
generators since, upon occurrence of a short-circuit, they work as a generator. They 
are therefore equivalent to a voltage source with an internal impedance Xd
'  or Xd
"  
(see section 4.2.1.4, “generator power supply impedance”). 
Asynchronous motors 
 
When a short-circuit occurs, these motors have a current that decreases fairly 
rapidly, with a time constant of approximately: 
– 10 ms for single-cage motors up to 100 kW; 
– 20 ms for double-cage motors and motors over 100 kW; 
– 30 to 50 ms for very big slip ring rotor motors (1,000 kW). 
 
 
They are equivalent to a voltage source to which a transient impedance XM

The large number of LV motors in industrial networks and the difficulty of 
knowing the average number of motors in service and the link impedances to be 
taken into account make it difficult to calculate the contribution of motors. 
 
 
This is why it is usual to consider an overall motor contribution to the short-
circuit current. This equivalent current is taken to be equal to three times the sum of 
the nominal currents of all the motors installed, each current being recalculated for 
the voltage level considered. 
4.2.1.6. Example of a symmetrical three-phase short-circuit calculation 
 
Let us take an 11 kV utility network which supplies an MV/LV substation via a  
1.5 km overhead line. The substation has two 1,000 kVA transformers in parallel 
which feed the main low voltage switchboard (MLVS). 
 
 
A secondary LV switchboard feeds five 50 kW motors, all connected via 
identical cables. They are all operating when the fault appears. 
 
 
The installation diagram is shown in Figure 4-8. We shall calculate the value of 
the symmetrical three-phase short-circuit current at different points in the 
installation, i.e.: 
– at A on the MV busbar; 
– at B on the MLVS 10 m from the transformers; 
– at C on the secondary LV switchboard feeding the motors; 
– at D at the terminals of a motor. 
 
 
Next, we shall calculate the motor return current at points D, C, B and A. 
 
 
In Table 4-12, we determine the values of reactances X  and resistances R of 
each electrical element, at their supply voltage level. To determine the value of an 
impedance across a transformer, it must be multiplied by the square of the voltage 
ratio (see section 4.2.1.1).

The contribution of the LV motors can in general be neglected for a short-circuit 
on the MV side. On the other hand, for LV, it may be great and must therefore be 
taken into account when choosing switching devices and protection settings. 
4.2.2. Solid phase-to-earth short-circuit (zero fault impedance) 
 
This is the fault shown in Figure 3-1. The fault current value is strongly 
influenced by the earthing system (see section 4.3). 
 
 
The method for calculating the phase-to-earth short-circuit is more complex than 
that of symmetrical three-phase short-circuits. 
 
 
Indeed, the dissymmetrical nature of currents I
Isc

 and I
I

 means 
that an equivalent single-phase diagram can no longer be used. This is due to the 
mutual cable-to-cable and cable-to-earth impedances which are no longer balanced. 
 
 
The calculation method used is the symmetrical component method. 
Calculating using the symmetrical component method 
 
This consists of breaking down an unbalanced three-phase system into the sum 
of three balanced three-phase systems: positive-sequence, negative-sequence and 
zero-sequence (see Figure 4-9). 
 
 
For example, for a solid phase-to-earth fault on phase 1, at the fault location: 
V1
0
=
, 
2
0
≠
V
 and 
3
0
V ≠

Furthermore, in spite of the rather abstract nature of the method of calculation, 
these impedances can be easily measured and have a concrete physical nature: 
 
– To measure the positive-sequence impedance of an electrical element (cable, 
transformer, rotating machine, etc.), a positive-sequence three-phase voltage system 
is applied to the terminals of the three phases and the current is then measured. 
 
– To measure the negative-sequence impedance of an electrical element (cable, 
transformer, rotating machine, etc.), a negative-sequence three-phase voltage system 
is applied to the terminals of the three phases and the current is then measured. 
 
– To measure the zero-sequence impedance of an electrical element (cable, 
transformer, rotating machine, etc.), a phase-to-earth voltage is applied to the 
terminals of the three cables in parallel and the current is then measured. 
 
The method of calculation used to determine the phase-to-earth short-circuit 
current value is fairly long and complex, we shall therefore deal only with the result.

Z( )
1 is the positive-sequence impedance of a network element and it corresponds 
to the impedance measured when a positive-sequence three-phase voltage system is 
applied (voltage system under normal conditions) to this element. It is the same as 
the impedance Zsc  of the element when a symmetrical three-phase short-circuit 
occurs (a positive-sequence three-phase voltage system is applied upon occurrence 
of a symmetrical three-phase short-circuit).

– Zero-sequence: when a zero-sequence three-phase voltage system is applied to 
a stator, the flux induced in the rotor is zero (since there is no rotating field). This 
impedance only depends therefore on the stator winding, is thus low and considered 
to be a pure reactance (see Tables 4-13, 4-14 and 4-15 giving the standard zero-
sequence impedance values).

– Zero-sequence: as for synchronous motors, this impedance only depends on 
the stator winding and is thus low. For zero-sequence calculations, it is not used 
since the motor neutral is usually unearthed. It therefore appears as infinite. When 
the motor is fed by a delta-connected secondary transformer, limiting resistance 
earthing can be made at the point where the stator neutral is located (if it is star-
connected). The motor zero-sequence impedance is therefore equal to three times 
the limiting resistance. 
Zero-sequence impedance of transformers 
 
The zero-sequence impedance of transformers depends on whether it is possible 
to reclose earth fault currents.

Zero-sequence capacitance of cables 
 
This is difficult to determine as it depends on numerous parameters such as the 
type of insulating material, the voltage, the cable cross-section, and whether the 
cable is individually or collectively shielded. 
 
 
A cable is said to be collectively shielded when the shield surrounds all the 
conductors (see Figure 4-12), and to be individually shielded when each conductor 
is surrounded by a shield (see Figure 4-13). A single-core armored cable is 
obviously individually shielded.

Table 4-19: capacitance of individually PE shielded cables in µF/km 
Collectively shielded cables 
 
There is no simple formula that can be used to determine the capacitances of 
collectively shielded cables. As an example, for SILEC cables the following applies: 
– PR insulated low voltage cables 
- 16 mm2 ⇒ C = 0.2 µF/km 
- 35 mm2 ⇒ C = 0.16 µF/km 
– PVC insulated 3.2 kV phase-to-phase cables 
- 10 mm2 ⇒ C = 0.16 µF/km 
- 25 mm2 ⇒ C = 0.18 µF/km 
- 35 mm2 ⇒ C = 0.17 µF/km 
– PVC insulated 6 kV phase-to-phase cables 
- 16 mm2 ⇒ C = 0.14 µF/km 
- 50 mm2 ⇒ C = 0.21 µF/km 
- 95 mm2 ⇒ C = 0.30 µF/km 
 
In practice, to assess the maximum value of capacitive currents when the type of 
each cable is not known (which is generally the case), a maximum value of  
0.5 µF/km can be taken.

Zero-sequence capacitance of overhead lines 
 
This is approximately 5 nF/km. It is therefore much lower than the capacitance 
of cables (100 times lower). 
Zero-sequence impedance of the utility 
 
This is directly related to the utility’s earthing system: 
– if the neutral is earthed via a Petersen coil, the zero-sequence impedance is 
considered to be infinite since the earth fault current is zero (see section 4.3.3); 
– if the neutral is directly earthed, the zero-sequence impedance is more or less 
equal to the positive-sequence impedance (except if the HV/MV transformer 
primary is star-connected and unearthed) (see Table 4-16); 
– if the neutral is earthed via a resistance, the zero-sequence impedance is more 
or less equal to three times this resistance since the transformer and link impedances 
are negligible compared with the limiting resistance. Figure 4-11 explains the

4.3. Circulation of phase-to-earth fault currents 
 
Let us consider a low or medium voltage three-phase network (see Figure 4-14). 
The neutral may or may not be earthed. The earthing system depends on the value of 
the earthing impedance ZN .  
 
As indicated in Table 2-1: 
– if ZN  is approximately zero (several milliohms), the neutral is directly 
earthed; 
– if ZN  is very high, which may even include no connection between the neutral 
and earth, the neutral is unearthed or highly impedant; 
– if ZN  is different from zero, but of low value (several tenths to several 
hundredths of ohms depending on the voltage level and the type of network), the 
network is said to have limiting impedance earthing. 
– ZN  may be a resistance, a fixed reactance or a variable reactance (Petersen 
coil). 
 
 
In the absence of a fault, a balanced three-phase current circulates in the 
network’s capacitances and the symmetrical nature of these currents leads to zero 
current in the neutral earthing. 
 
 
When a phase is put in contact with earth, a current I f  is established between 
the faulty phase and earth. We can see that it is reclosed by impedance ZN  as well 
as the phase-earth capacitances of the healthy phases (see Figure 4-14):

To determine Z( )
0 , the equivalent zero-sequence diagram seen from the fault 
point must be determined (see section 4.2.2). As we saw previously, the fault 
current recloses via the neutral earthing impedance and healthy phase capacitances. 
The equivalent diagram is therefore that in Figure 4-15.

therefore be multiplied by factor of 3 (see Figure 4-11).

Note 2: the zero-sequence impedance upstream of the transformer is infinite, 
except in the case of a star-star transformer having an earthed neutral allowing 
primary earth current to be reclosed (see Table 4-16). In this case, the impedance 
must be taken into account by adding it in series to the equivalent zero-sequence 
diagram.

The fault current is therefore fairly small and only depends on the network 
phase-earth capacitance (or zero-sequence capacitance).

In public distribution networks, the reactance is necessarily variable due to the 
multiple network configurations possible. 
 
In practice, tuning is never entirely perfect and a current thus circulates while the 
fault lasts. This fault current may be maintained until the operating personnel 
intervenes (no switching upon occurrence of the first fault). Care must be taken to 
make sure that this current presents no danger to equipment or personnel 
(see section 2.2.2.5).

 (see Figure 4-15). 
The capacitive current is negligible compared with the current circulating in the 
neutral. 
 
The fault current is therefore only limited by the impedances of the transformer 
and links, and by fault resistance ρ  which in this case is not negligible. 
 
The equivalent zero-sequence diagram is shown in Figure 4-16.

The fault resistance is multiplied by a factor 3 because of the transformation of 
the three-phase diagram into a single-phase diagram. The demonstration is identical 
to that of the neutral earthing zero-sequence impedance (see Figure 4-11). 
 
This therefore gives a very high phase-earth current, close to the three-phase 
short-circuit current, especially if the fault resistance ρ is low:

It can be seen therefore that the phase-to-earth short-circuit current value is close 
to the three-phase short-circuit current value. 
4.3.5. Spreading of the capacitive current in a network with several outgoing 
feeders upon occurrence of an earth fault 
 
As we saw in sections 4.3.1, 4.3.2 and 4.3.3, knowing the total value of the 
capacitive current is important (except in the case of direct neutral earthing). It is 

134    Protection of Electrical Networks 
moreover useful to know how it spread and how it is detected by the measuring 
apparatus of different outgoing feeders and of the earthing connection. Knowing the 
current values detected by the measuring apparatus is important for choosing earth 
fault protective devices and setting them. 
 
 
Let us consider a low or medium voltage three-phase network made up of 
several outgoing feeders i - l, i, i + l, etc. (see Figure 4-17). 
 
 
A residual current measuring device is installed on each outgoing feeder, it 
measures the vectorial sum of the currents circulating in each of the phases (see 
section 7.2). The residual current corresponds to the current flowing through earth.

As we saw in section 4.3, the current flowing through the fault is the sum of the 
current reclosing via ZN  and reclosing via the capacitances of the healthy network 
phases.  
 
 
When the network has several feeders (which is generally the case), the fault 
current recloses via the capacitance of the healthy phases of each feeder.

A healthy feeder thus detects a current that is proportional to its capacitance. We 
can therefore see that a residual current measuring device will detect current in a 
healthy feeder. 
 
 
If the protection setting threshold is not greater than this capacitive current, the 
healthy feeder may trip when a fault occurs on another feeder. 
 
 
The way to overcome this problem is to install directional earth fault protection 
devices (see section 7.4). 
4.4. Calculation and importance of the minimum short-circuit current 
 
Whatever the type and location of short-circuit, the protection directly upstream 
of the short-circuit point must be activated by the minimum short-circuit current. 
 
 
Knowing the minimum short-circuit current is therefore important for setting the 
current thresholds of protective devices. Furthermore, the switching device must 
open in a time compatible with the protection of persons and equipment. 
 
 
The minimum short-circuit current must be calculated downstream of all the 
switching devices. 
 
 
The procedure is carried out in the following steps: 
– Step 1: determine the furthest point downstream of the switching device: load 
or switching device directly downstream. 

138    Protection of Electrical Networks 
– Step 2: determine the configuration upstream of the network leading to a 
minimum short-circuit: 
- determine the lowest short-circuit current supply source that can be 
configured in the network; 
- choose the configuration giving the longest link up to the source. 
– Step 3: determine the type of short-circuit giving the lowest value. 
– Step 4: determine the length of the longest fault loop. 
– Step 5: calculate the short-circuit, e.g. using the impedance method or 
conventional method. 
 
 
General note about the calculation: to calculate the minimum short-circuit 
current, the resistivity of the conductors is taken to be equal to 1.5 times the 
resisitivity at 20°C, i.e. 0.027 Ω mm2/m for copper and 0.043 Ω mm2/m for 
aluminum (in order to take into account the influence of the temperature of the 
conductor core during the short-circuit). 
4.4.1. Calculating the minimum short-circuit current in low voltage in relation to 
the earthing system 
 
The minimum short-circuit current must be calculated downstream of all the 
protection devices (circuit-breakers or fuses) for TN and IT systems because they 
guarantee the protection of people. 
 
 
For TT systems, protection of people is provided by residual current devices 
whose setting must satisfy the following condition (see IEC 60364-4-41, 
section 413.1.4.2): 
V
I
R
A
A
50
≤
 
 
A
R  : earth resistance of the exposed conductive parts 
 
AI  : rated residual current of the circuit-breaker 
 
 
If selectivity is judged to be necessary, an operating time of the residual 
protection at the most equal to 1 second is admissible in distribution circuits. 
 
To calculate the minimal short-circuit current, two methods can be applied: 
– the impedance method which can be used when all the characteristics of the 
fault loop are known, including that of the supply source; 
– the conventional method which can be used when neither the short-circuit 
current at the origin of the cable considered (at the location point of the switching 
device), nor the characteristics of the upstream power supply is known. 

Short-circuits     139 
4.4.1.1. Calculating the minimum short-circuit current in a TN system 
 
The procedure is carried out in the following steps: 
Step 1: see section 4.4. 
Step 2: see section 4.4. 
Step 3: the type of short-circuit giving the lowest value is the phase-to-neutral 
short-circuit. 
Step 4: the longest fault loop is the phase-to-neutral short-circuit at the location 
point of the load the furthest away (see Figure 4-19).

L  is the longest circuit length from the circuit-breaker. We can see that the fault 
current flows through the phase along a length L  and the neutral along a length L , 
then flows up to the source. The distance d of the circuit-breaker up to the circuit 
connection point is neglected. 
 
 
Step 5: the short-circuit current is calculated.

This method uses the following simplifications: 
– it is assumed that in the event of a short-circuit, the voltage at the point where 
the protective device is located is equal to 80% of the rated voltage. In other words, 
it is assumed that the part of the fault loop upstream of the switching device 
represents 20% of the total impedance of the fault loop; 
– the influence of the reactance of the conductors is negligible for cross-sections 
less than 150 mm2. The influence of conductor reactances is taken into account for 
large cross-sections by increasing the resistance by 15% for 150 mm2 cross-sections, 
by 20% for 185 mm2 cross-sections, by 25% for 240 mm2 cross-sections and by 
30% for 300 mm2 cross-sections; 
– the short-circuit is assumed to be solid, i.e. the arc resistances, contact and 
analogue resistances are not taken into account.

4.4.1.2. Calculating the minimum short-circuit current in an IT system without a 
distributed neutral 
 
The procedure is carried out in the following steps: 
Step 1: see section 4.4. 
Step 2: see section 4.4. 
Step 3: the type of short-circuit giving the lowest value is the double fault, the 
first being located in the phase of a circuit, the second being located in another 
phase of another circuit (see Figure 4-21). This is a phase-to-phase short-circuit 
clear of earth. 

Short-circuits     145 
Step 4: the fault loop is longest for the double fault occurring at the two loads 
the furthest away from the switching devices (see Figure 4-21).

L1 and L2 are the lengths of the two loads furthest away from the circuit-
breaker. We can see that the fault current flows through the following path: 
– length L2 on phase 1 
– length L2 on the earth conductor (PE) 
– length L1 on the earth conductor (PE) 
– length L1 on phase 3 
– up to the source 
 
 
Note: length “a” between the two connection points of the circuits is negligible. 
 
 
Step 5: the short-circuit current is calculated.

This method uses the following simplifications:

the protective device is located is equal to 80% of the rated voltage. In other words, 
it is assumed that the part of the fault loop upstream of the switching device 
represents 20% of the total impedance of the fault loop; 
– the influence of the reactance of the conductors is negligible for cross-sections 
less than 150 mm2. The influence of conductor reactances is taken into account for 
large cross-sections by increasing the resistance by 15% for 150 mm2 cross-sections, 
by 20% for 185 mm2 cross-sections, by 25% for 240 mm2 cross-sections and by 
30% for 300 mm2 cross-sections.

analogue resistances are not taken into account.

Let us consider the diagram in Figure 4-22, corresponding to the configuration 
giving the lowest short-circuit current at the point where the load is located. We 
shall calculate the minimum short-circuit current for a double fault, the first between 
a phase and the exposed conductive part at the point where load 1 is located, the 
second between another phase and the exposed conductive part at the point where 
load 2 is located.

We can see in this example that the conventional method minimizes the result of 
the minimum short-circuit current calculation by 12%. 
4.4.1.3. Calculating the minimum short-circuit in an IT system with distributed 
neutral 
 
The procedure is carried out in the following steps: 
– Step 1: see section 4.4. 
– Step 2: see section 4.4. 
– Step 3: the type of short-circuit giving the lowest value is the double fault, the 
first being located in the phase of a circuit, the second being located on the neutral 
of another circuit. 
– Step 4: the fault loop is as long as in the IT system without distributed neutral, 
the only difference being that for the second fault, the short-circuit current flows 
through the neutral instead of a phase. 
– Step 5: 
- the cross-section of the neutral conductor is less than or equal to the cross-
section of a phase which thus minimizes the short-circuit current value in relation to 
the IT system without distributed neutral; 
- the voltage applied to the fault loop is a single voltage, as opposed to the 
case of the IT system without distributed neutral for which the voltage applied is a 
phase-to-phase voltage. The short-circuit current is thus limited to a factor 
3 in 
relation to the system without distributed neutral:

Z

Short-circuits     151 
 
To conclude, we thus have a minimum short-circuit current at least 
3 times 
lower than the minimum short-circuit current in the case of the IT system without 
distributed neutral. 
 
 
This means that smaller maximum circuit lengths must be used which is why it is 
preferable not to distribute the neutral in an IT system. 
 
 
In the case where the length of the circuits does not ensure tripping upon 
occurrence of the second fault, residual current devices must be installed. 
4.4.1.4. Calculating the minimum short-circuit in a TT system 
 
The procedure is carried out in the following steps: 
– Step 1: see section 4.4. 
– Step 2: see section 4.4. 
– Step 3: single-phase short-circuits are detected by the residual current devices 
since the neutral and exposed conductive part are earthed. These residual current 
devices are compulsory in a TT system. The type of short-circuit (non-visible to the 
residual current device), giving the lowest value, is the phase-to-phase fault; this is a 
phase-to-phase fault clear of earth. 
– Step 4: the longest fault loop is the phase-to-phase short-circuit clear of earth 
at the point where the furthest away load is located (see Figure 4-23).

It can be seen that the fault flows through the two phases along length L . 
 
 
The distance d  of the circuit-breaker up to the circuit connection point is neglected. 
– Step 5: the short-circuit current is calculated.

We can see that in this example the conventional method minimizes the result of 
the minimum short-circuit current calculation by 4%. 
4.4.1.5. Influence of the minimum short-circuit current on the choice of circuit-
breakers or fuses 
Circuit-breaker protection  
Standard IEC 60364-4-43 (section 432) stipulates that the magnetic tripping 
threshold of the circuit-breaker must be lower than the minimum short-circuit 
current for TN and IT systems. For a given circuit length, and thus a stipulated 
minimum short-circuit current, a circuit-breaker with a suitable tripping threshold 
must be chosen. Or conversely, for a given circuit-breaker, a maximum circuit 
length respecting the magnetic tripping threshold can be used. 
This condition is stipulated so that problems relating to the protection against 
indirect contact may be overcome. 
Example 1 
Let us take the example considered for the TN system in section 4.4.1.1 (see 
Figure 4-20). 
A minimum short-circuit current value of 906 A was found using the impedance 
method and 850 A found using the conventional method. 
The magnetic tripping threshold of circuit-breaker CB should therefore be lower 
than 906 A or 850 A depending on the method of calculation used. 

Short-circuits     157 
In the same way, let us assume that the magnetic tripping threshold Im of 
circuit-breaker CB is 600 A. We can calculate the authorized maximum length of 
the circuit protected by the circuit-breaker in a TN system:

Example 2 
Let us take the example given for the IT system without distributed neutral in 
section 4.4.1.2 (see Figure 4-22). 
A minimum short-circuit current value of 1,192 A was found using the 
impedance method and of 1,054 A using the conventional method. 
The magnetic tripping threshold of circuit-breaker CB should therefore be lower 
than 1,192 A or 1,054 A depending on the method of calculation used. 
In the same way, let us assume that the magnetic tripping threshold Im of 
circuit-breaker CB is 600 A. We can therefore calculate the authorized maximum

in the IT system with distributed neutral. 
Fuse protection 
Standard IEC 60364-4-41 (section 413.1.1.1) stipulates that the fault current 
should be cleared in a time compatible with the protection of persons for TN and IT 
systems. 
This time is determined by a curve in relation to the presumed touch voltage 
which is based on the physiological effects of the electric current on the human 
body. To simplify matters, using this curve it is possible to determine an average 
switching time in relation to the nominal voltage of the installation (see Tables 4-20 
and 4-21).

The protection rule consists therefore in making sure that the fault current I f  
causes the fuse to blow in less than the time stipulated in Tables 4-20 and 4-21. 
 
In practice, for a given fuse blowing curve (see Figure 4-25):

t0 : specified switching time to ensure protection of persons 
t1 : fuse blowing time for fault current If 
Figure 4-25: protection of persons using a fuse 

160    Protection of Electrical Networks 
 
If t1 is less than or equal to t0, protection is ensured. 
 
Note 1: if t1 is higher than t0, but less than 5 seconds, protection is said to be 
ensured by IEC 60364-4-41, section 413.1.3.5 in the following cases: 
– in distribution circuits when the protective conductor at the downstream end of 
the circuit is linked directly to the main equipotential bonding; 
– in terminal circuits only supplying stationary equipment whose protective 
conductor is linked to the main equipotential bonding and which is located in the 
main equipotential bonding influence zone. 
 
Note 2: in a TT system, protection of people is generally provided by residual 
current devices whose setting must satisfy the following condition (see IEC 60364-
4-41, section 413.1.4.2):

RA : resistance of the earth of the exposed conductive parts 
 
IA : rated residual current of the circuit-breaker 
If selectivity is judged to be necessary, an operating time of the residual 
protection at the most equal to 1 second is admissible in distribution circuits. 
 
Note 3: in an IT system, when the exposed conductive parts are earthed 
individually or in groups, the TT system conditions given in Note 2 must be 
respected (see IEC 60364-4-41, section 413.1.5.3). 
4.4.2. Calculating the minimum short-circuit current for medium and high 
voltages 
The method applied is the impedance method. 
The procedure is carried out in the following steps: 
– Step 1: determine the furthest point downstream of the switching device 
giving the lowest short-circuit current for which protection must be in place. 
– Step 2: determine the upstream network configuration giving the minimum 
short-circuit current: 
- the lowest short-circuit current supply source which can be configured is 
determined. This is generally the standby generator if there is one; 
- the network configuration giving the longest link length up to the source is 
determined. 

Short-circuits     161 
– Step 3: the type of short-circuit giving the lowest value is determined. For 
medium and high voltages, phase-to-earth short-circuits are cleared by the earth 
fault or directional earth fault protective devices. The neutral is not distributed, 
which implies that the short-circuit is minimum for a phase-to-phase fault clear of 
earth. 
– Step 4: the length of the longest fault loop is determined, i.e. when a single 
phase-to-phase fault occurs at the point the furthest away in the protected zone, e.g. 
the furthest away load (see Figure 4-26).

Note 3: in the case where the network is fed by a generator, the minimum short-
circuit current may be the three-phase short-circuit (see section 7.24). 
Using the minimum short-circuit current calculation for protection setting 
The minimum short-circuit current calculation allows the opening of switching 
devices to be ensured in the event of a phase-to-phase short-circuit in the protected 
zone: 
– the phase overcurrent protection threshold (see section 7.1) must be such that

4.4.3. Importance of the minimum short-circuit calculation for protection selectivity 
For amperemetric type selectivity, the minimum and maximum short-circuit 
currents at the location point of each switching device must be known 
(see section 9.1). 
 

 
Chapter 5 
Consequences of Short-circuits 
5.1. Thermal effect 
When a short-circuit occurs, a much larger current than the nominal current 
flows (10 to 100 times its value). This results in cables overheating which may 
damage the insulating material. The current must therefore be switched by a circuit-
breaker or a fuse in a short enough time ts  for the cable temperature not to reach a 
critical value. 
The thermal losses per unit of length is proportional to the square of the current:

is 45 kA.

5.2. Electrodynamic effect 
The maximum peak value of the current creates the maximum electrodynamic 
force observed in the network equipment. 
This force, an electromagnetic effect, is referred to as the “Laplace force”. 
For example, the force per unit of length generated by two parallel conductors 
through which an identical current I  flows is (see Figure 5-1):

 through which an identical current I flows 
The forces are attractive if both currents flow in the same direction and repulsive 
if they do not. 

166     Protection of Electrical Networks 
In sinusoidal operating conditions, the equipment must be dimensioned in 
relation to the peak value of the short-circuit current. This is 1.6 to 2.5 times higher 
than the value of the steady-state short-circuit current (see section 4.1.1). 
Example 
Let us consider two bus sections of a low voltage switchboard, 10 cm apart, over 
a length of 30 cm and through which an identical short-circuit current

 is the peak value of the short-circuit current and 
corresponds, for example, to a steady-state short-circuit current of 50 kA for a 
coefficient K = 2 (see section 4.1.1). 
The maximum attractive force applied to each bus when a short-circuit occurs is:

If the bus sections are held by two supports, one on each side of the bus, the 
force applied to each support and to the bus connection system will be 300 daN. 
This may possibly result in parts being deformed or broken. 
Effect on switching devices (circuit-breakers, switches or contactors) 
The separable contacts of the switching devices tend to open under the effect of 
this so-called repulsive electrodynamic force. This is why it is necessary to define 
the short-circuit making capacity of circuit-breakers or switches (see sections 8.1 
and 8.2). 
According to section 4.1.1, for an installation fed by a distribution network, the 
peak value of the short-circuit current is equal to K  times the value of the steady-
state short-circuit current where1.41

. 
The circuit-breaker or switch must be able to withstand this peak current, which 
occurs if the device is closed on a solid symmetrical three-phase short-circuit. 
Low voltage circuit-breakers 
In low voltage, standard IEC 60947-2, section 8.3.2.2.4 stipulates that equipment 
must have a ratio n  between the short-circuit making capacity and the nominal 
short-circuit breaking capacity, in relation to the nominal short-circuit breaking

Note 1: the short-circuit making capacity is also referred to as the

Note 2: standard Schneider equipment complies with these standards, both in 
low voltage and high voltage. Any specific requirements must be checked for non-
standard equipment or equipment to be used in special conditions. 
5.3. Voltage drops 
A fault in the installation or on the utility network results in a voltage drop in the 
network’s healthy elements which is often less than the allowable load voltage. 
This voltage drop may lead to difficulties which do not necessarily disappear 
when the fault is cleared. 
 
 

168     Protection of Electrical Networks 
Effect on contactors 
For certain manufacturers, the coils designed to close the contacts of the circuit 
are directly fed by a voltage supply from the network; the contacts may open upon 
occurrence of the fault and may not close when normal operating conditions are 
restored. 
Effect on asynchronous motors 
The maximum torque of asynchronous motors is approximately proportional to 
the square of the supply voltage. A drop in voltage may therefore lead to the motor 
stopping if the fault lasts too long. 
Furthermore, if several motors have greatly slowed down or stopped, once the 
voltage is restored, these motors create a high pick-up current (same principle as for 
start-up), and may trigger the protective devices or cause a drop in voltage 
themselves. It is sometimes necessary to provide a load shedding and reloading 
program after a fault has occurred to prevent high pick-up currents from being 
generated. 
Effect on generators 
When a serious fault in the utility network or internal network occurs, the active 
power exchanges are disturbed. This results in modification of the internal angles of 
the machines and risk of loss of synchronism with the utility network. Indeed, while 
the short-circuit lasts, the generator does not supply any active power but receives 
the power from the driving machine thus forcing the rotor to accelerate. A dynamic 
stability study of the behavior of generators upon occurrence of a fault may show 
the need to separate them from the network if the fault is not quickly cleared. 
Abnormal operation of power electronics 
Rectifiers or inverters use thyristors which need a temporal reference allowing 
switching to take place at predetermined times. This temporal reference comes from 
the three-phase voltage system. 
If the voltage almost reaches zero during a fault, the reference disappears which 
may lead to disturbances upon re-initialization of the process. 
5.4. Transient overvoltages 
When a phase-to-earth fault occurs in an unearthed or limiting impedance 
earthed network (see section 2.2), the voltage between the healthy phases and earth 
becomes equal to the phase-to-phase voltage (see Figure 5-2). Consequently, so far 

Consequences of Short-circuits     169 
as earthing insulation is concerned, the network must be dimensioned for a phase-
to-phase voltage and be able to withstand transient overvoltages so that a phase-to-
phase fault is not generated. This problem is especially relevant in unearthed or 
Petersen coil earthed networks where, due to supply continuity requirements, phase-
to-earth faults are detected but not immediately cleared (see section 2.2).

5.5. Touch voltages 
When a fault occurs between a phase and an exposed conductive part or two 
phases and an exposed conductive part, a voltage coming from the current flowing 
in the earth conductor occurs between the exposed conductive part and earth or 
between two neighboring exposed conductive parts. 
This voltage must not be dangerous. To make sure of this, the specifications 
provided in IEC 60364-5-54 concerning earthing of exposed conductive parts and of 
the neutral conductor should be followed. In particular, equipotential bonding must 
be installed between two simultaneously accessible exposed conductive parts. 
5.6. Switching surges 
The clearance of a fault means that a current in a generally inductive circuit is 
switched. This causes overvoltages referred to as “switching surges”, the maximum 
peak value of which is generally estimated to be two or three times the r.m.s. value 
of the nominal voltage (see section 10.1.1). 

170     Protection of Electrical Networks 
5.7. Induced voltage in remote control circuits 
A high single-phase current in a power cable (a phase-to-earth fault, for 
example) induces a disturbing voltage on telecommunication lines located nearby. 
Owing to their symmetry, three-phase short-circuits induce a zero sum of 
voltage, except when the layout of the remote control circuits is dissymmetrical in 
relation to the different phases; the induced voltage in this case is only rarely a 
problem. 
Calculating the induced voltage on a remote control circuit

Note: when an earth conductor accompanies the power cable, the fault current 
circulates in this conductor rather than earth. This results in a decrease in mutual 
impedance and thus a reduction in induced voltage. The value of the reduction 
factor is difficult to determine and it is therefore difficult to take it into account.

Instrument Transformers 
 
Instrument transformer is the standard term used for current and voltage 
transformers. 
6.1. Current transformers 
 
They provide a current proportional to the current flowing through the cable in 
order to perform energy metering or to analyze this current through a protection 
device. 
6.1.1. Theoretical reminder 
 
Current transformers have similar compositions to “conventional” transformers. 
A magnetic circuit (generally made of an iron alloy) in the shape of a torroid is 
surrounded by n1 turns on the primary and n2  turns on the secondary (see 
Figure 6-1). 
 
 
The primary can be reduced to a simple conductor passing through the torroid 
( n1

=
) (see Figure 6-2).

6.1.2. Saturation of the magnetic circuit 
 
We previously saw that the quality of the CT was related to the relative 
permeability µr  of the magnetic circuit. 
 
 
Now, µr , which is approximately 1,000 for iron, becomes very small (several 
units) when B  rises above the magnetic saturation induction Bsat. The magnetizing 
current or magnetic field H  are related to induction B  as in the curve in  
Figure 6-4.

A time curve in the form of peaks (see Figure 6-5) can thus be observed for Is . 
 
 
The peaks represent the period during which the current transformer is not 
saturated. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 6-5: secondary current of a current transformer operating under saturated conditions  
 
The r.m.s. value of the current Is  formed of peaks is calculated in Appendix C. 
In spite of the saturation, the r.m.s. value of the secondary current increases when 
the primary current increases. Overcurrent protection, measuring the r.m.s. value, 
will thus be activated even if the current transformer saturates. 
 

180     Protection of Electrical Networks 
 
On the other hand, for an accurate measurement of the current, saturation must 
be avoided. This requires that:

Maximum load at the CT terminals 
– The value Bsat is determined by the construction of the magnetic circuit. 
– Let us take the nominal (primary) current Ipn for the CT. 
 
 
This gives us the condition: 
ˆ

since

It can thus be seen that for a CT with a nominal current Ipn, there is a maximum 
operating load that does not saturate the magnetic circuit and which produces an 
accurate measurement of the current. It can be observed that as a consequence, the 
CT has a maximum secondary voltage above which it becomes saturated. 
 
 
This is why CT manufacturers, in compliance with IEC 60044-1, specify an 
accuracy power P  in VA, which stipulates a maximum load by the relation 
P
I
Z
n =
2
max
. As for the British standard BS 3938, this gives a knee-point voltage 
VK characterizing the limit voltage before saturation. 
 
 
Zmax  is the maximum load of the CT. It includes the cable impedance linking 
the CT to the relay and the input impedance of the relay.  
 
 
It is thus obvious that the distance between the CT and the relay must not be too 
great and that the connecting cable cross-section must sometimes be made bigger in 
order to reduce the total load impedance Zl . This solution is generally less costly 
than increasing the accuracy power (IEC 60044-1) or the knee-point voltage 
(BS 3938). 

Instrument Transformers     181 
 
6.1.3. Using CTs in electrical networks 
6.1.3.1. General application rule 
 
Current transformers feed measuring, control and monitoring devices. Galvanic 
insulation electrically separates the primary circuit from the secondary circuit. It 
provides earthing of the electrical measuring device and thus ensures the safety of 
operating personnel. 
 
 
The current transformer is designed to give the secondary a current that is 
proportional to the primary current. The secondary is connected to a low impedance 
(used in practically short-circuited conditions). 
 
 
In a CT, the primary current/secondary current ratio is constant. 
 
 
The secondary current is thus independent of the load as long as saturation is not 
reached (see section 6.1.2). 
 
Let us consider the simplified electrical diagram of the current transformer (see 
Figure 6-6).

If Z  decreases, then P  decreases. 
 

182     Protection of Electrical Networks 
 
If we short-circuit the secondary of a CT, Z = 0, P = 0, Vs = 0 and there is no risk 
of destruction. 
 
 
We can short-circuit the secondary of a CT without any risk. 
 
On the other hand, if the secondary circuit remains open, Z  tends towards 
infinity and the power and voltage would be theoretically infinite but are fortunately 
limited by the magnetic and copper losses of the CT. 
 
 
Nevertheless, the voltage may reach peaks of several kV. It is therefore 
dangerous to leave a CT in an open circuit arrangement as this may generate 
overvoltages at its terminals which would be dangerous for both personnel and 
equipment under such conditions. 
 
 
Never leave the secondary circuit of a CT open. 
6.1.3.2. Composition of a current transformer 
 
The CT is made up of one or more primary windings around one or more 
secondary windings each having a magnetic circuit and the entire assembly being 
sealed in an insulating resin. 
 
 
To guarantee a given level of accuracy, the product of N
Ip

 (number of 
primary turns x primary current) must always be above a certain value. 
 
 
If N1 = 1, then the device is: 
– bushing type: the primary is reduced to a copper bar going through the 
secondary winding (see Figure 6-7). We find this type of CT in MV cubicles. 
 
 
 
Figure 6-7: bushing type transformer 

Instrument Transformers     183 
 
– Bar primary type: it is the compartment conductors of the MV cubicle that act 
as primary turns (see Figure 6-8). 
 
Figure 6-8: bar primary type transformer 
– Ring type: this is a CT though LV-designed to be installed on a medium 
voltage cable or on a bushing (see Figure 6-9). 
 
Figure 6-9: ring type transformer 
 
If N1 > 1, then the device is said to be of the wound type (see Figure 6-10). 
 
Figure 6-10: wound type current transformer 
6.1.3.3. Specifications and definitions of current transformer parameters 
 
The current transformer must meet requirements relating to protective, 
measuring and metering devices. 
 
 
The specified use of the current transformer will help to determine the rated 
primary and secondary currents, the power and accuracy class. 
 
 
The specifications of current transformers are only valid for normal conditions 
of use. A derating must be provided for in accordance with the ambient temperature 
and altitude. 

184     Protection of Electrical Networks 
Rated primary current: this is defined by the standard and it should be chosen 
from among the following values: 10 - 12.5 - 15 - 20 - 25 - 30 - 40 - 50 - 60 - 75 and 
their multiples or decimal factors. 
Rated secondary current: this is equal to 1 A or 5 A.

Accuracy power: this is the apparent power (in VA at a specified power factor)

The accuracy power will be chosen according to the actual requirement. 
Overcalibrating an accuracy power is costly and may be dangerous for the 
measuring device as the saturation voltage is higher. 
Accuracy class: this defines the guaranteed transformation ratio and phase 
displacement error limits under specific power and current conditions.

6.1.3.4. Current transformers used for measuring in compliance with standard IEC 
60044-1 
 
There are two requirements for measuring CTs. They must: 
– have a level of accuracy suitable to the application for the normal operating 
current; 
– protect the devices in the event of a fault current. 
 
The accuracy is defined by the accuracy class determining the permissible phase 
and current amplitude error over a range of 5% to 120% of the rated primary 
current 
 
The standardized IEC accuracy classes are: 0.1 - 0.2 - 0.5 - 1 - 3 - 5. 
Classes 0.5 and 1 are used in the majority of cases. 
Class 0.2 is only used for precision metering. 
Classes 0.1 - 3 - 5 are never used in medium voltage. 
 
Specific case: wide range current transformers are devices that can be used 
permanently with a primary current of 120, 150 or 200% of the rated current. The 
rise in temperature and transformer accuracy are guaranteed. 
 
Protection of metering devices in the event of a fault is defined by the safety 
factor SF 
 
This is the ratio between the rated primary limit current ( I pl ) and the rated 
primary current (Ipn). I pl  is the value of the primary current for which the 
secondary current error is equal to 10% (see Figure 6-11). 
 
 
The preferred SF values are 5 and 10.

6.1.3.5. Current transformers used for protection in compliance with standard IEC 
60044-1 
 
There are two requirements for protective current transformers: they must have 
an accuracy limit factor and an accuracy class suitable to the application. 
 
Accuracy limit factor (ALF) suited to the application 
 
The accuracy limit factor is the ratio between: 
– the accuracy limit current for which the error is guaranteed to be lower than 5 
or 10% as long as the accuracy class is 5P or 10P (see Table 6-2); 
– the rated primary current.

Accuracy suited to the application 
 
Accuracy is defined by the accuracy class. 
 
 
The IEC accuracy classes are 5P and 10P. The choice between one or the other 
will depend on the device connected; for an example, see Table 6-3.

Rated primary current (Ipn): 100 A. 
 
Rated secondary current (Isn): 1 A. 
 
Accuracy power: 15 VA. 
 
Accuracy class: 5P. 
 
Accuracy limit factor (ALF): 10. 
 
 
For a power supplied of 15 VA under 1 A, the maximum error on the secondary 
current will be: 
 
– less than 1% at Ipn = 100 A (see Table 6-2), 
thus (Isn× 1%) = 1 A × 1% = ± 0.01 A on the secondary; 
 
– less than 5% at (Ipn× ALF) = 100 A × 10 = 1,000 A (see Table 6-2), 
thus (Isn× 10 × 5%) = 1 A × 10 × 5% = ± 0.5 A on the secondary. 
 
 
The secondary current is thus between 9.5 and 10.5 A for a primary current of 
1,000 A (i.e. 10 times Ipn). 
6.1.3.6. Current transformers used for protection in compliance with BS 3938  
(class X) 
 
BS 3938 specifically defines current transformers designed for protection under 
the heading class X. 
 

Instrument Transformers     189 
 
 
According to the British Standard, class X is defined by the rated secondary 
current, the minimum knee-point voltage, the maximum resistance of the secondary 
winding and the maximum magnetizing current at the rated knee-point voltage. 
 
Rated knee-point voltage (VK): at the rated frequency this is the voltage value 
applied to the secondary terminals, which, when increased by 10%, causes a 
maximum increase of 50% in magnetizing current (see Figure 6-12). 
 
 
Maximum resistance of the secondary winding (Rct ): this is the maximum 
resistance of this winding, corrected at 75°C or at the maximum operating 
temperature if this is greater. 
 
Maximum magnetizing current (Im): this is the value of the magnetizing current 
at the rated knee-point voltage, or at a specified percentage of this current  
(see Figure 6-12).

It corresponds to a maximum load (connecting cable + protective relay input

The resistance Rn  is implicitly defined by IEC 60044-1.

Non-magnetic current sensors used by Schneider Electric operate according to 
the Rogowski principle and supply their secondary with a voltage that is 
proportional to the primary current derived. 
 
 
In the absence of a magnetic core, the coil winding technique gives the sensor 
the following properties: 
– absence of saturation, hysteresis and remnant flux; 
– perfect response in transient state operating conditions; 
– ideal linearity. 
 
 
All phenomena are faithfully reproduced. 
 
 
Non-magnetic current sensors are designed to form a coherent protection and 
measuring unit with the Sepam relay of Schneider. At present they cannot be used 
for rate metering. 
6.2. Voltage transformers 
 
The electrical operation theory of voltage transformers is analogous to that of 
power transformers. We shall not cover it in this discussion. 
6.2.1. General application rule 
 
The voltage transformer is a transformer connected to a very high impedance 
(used on an almost open circuit). 
 
 
A voltage transformer is designed to give the secondary a voltage proportional to 
that applied to the primary. For a VT, the primary voltage/secondary voltage ratio is 
constant. The secondary voltage is independent of the load.  
 
 
Let us consider the simplified electrical diagram of the voltage transformer  
(see Figure 6-17). 
 
Is

Z

Z
=
 
 
P  : power flowing to the secondary 
 
Is : secondary current 
 
Us : secondary voltage (imposed by the primary circuit) 
 
 
If Z  increases, then P  and Is decrease. 
 
 
At the terminals of a VT, it is thus possible to install an impedance with a value 
ranging between the VTs nominal impedance and infinity without any risk. 
 
 
A VT can thus be left in an open circuit arrangement without any risk. 
 
 
On the other hand, if Z  is reduced, the current supplied is too high and the VT 
will deteriorate. 
 
 
Never short-circuit a VT. 
 
 
IEC 60044-2 defines the requirements which voltage transformers must meet. 
 
 
The VT comprises a primary winding, a magnetic circuit, one or more secondary 
windings, the whole assembly being sealed in an insulating resin. 
6.2.2. Specifications and definitions of voltage transformer parameters 
 
The voltage transformer must comply with the network specifications. 
 
 
As with any device, the voltage transformer must meet requirements relating to 
the voltage, current and frequency. 
 
 
Voltage transformer specifications are only valid for normal conditions of use. A 
derating should be provided for in accordance with the ambient temperature and the 
altitude. 
Rated voltage factor: this is the factor by which the rated primary voltage must 
be multiplied in order to determine the maximum voltage for which the transformer 
must attain the required levels of heating and accuracy. 
 
The voltage factor is determined by the maximum operating voltage, which 
depends on the network earthing system and the way the VT’s primary winding is 

200     Protection of Electrical Networks 
connected. The voltage transformer must be able to withstand this maximum voltage 
for the time necessary to clear the fault (see Table 6-4).

The voltage transformer must be suited to requirements relating to protection 
and measuring devices. 
 
 
The foreseen application of the voltage transformer is used to determine the 
rated secondary voltage, the accuracy power, the accuracy class and the thermal 
power limit. 
 
Rated secondary voltage: this is equal to 100 or 110 V for phase/phase VTs. For 
single-phase transformers designed to be connected between a phase and earth, the 
rated secondary voltage is divided by 
3 . 
 
For example:  
100

Accuracy power: this is expressed in VA and it is the apparent power that the 
voltage transformer can supply to the secondary when it is connected under its rated 
primary voltage and connected to its accuracy load. It must not introduce an error in 
excess of the values guaranteed by the accuracy class. 
 
 
The standardized values are:  
 
10 - 15 - 25 - 30 - 50 - 75 - 100 - 150 - 200 - 300 - 400 - 500 - VA. 
 
Accuracy class: this defines the guaranteed transformation ratio and phase error 
limits in specified power and voltage conditions. 
 
 
Voltage ratio error: this is the error that the transformer introduces in the voltage 
measurement:

Phase or phase displacement error: this is the phase difference between the 
primary and secondary voltages and is expressed in minutes. 
 
Rated thermal limiting output: this is the apparent power that the transformer 
can permanently supply at its rated secondary voltage without exceeding the heating 
limits stipulated in the standards.

The accuracy class is guaranteed if the voltage is between 80 and 120% of the 
rated primary voltage and for any load between 25 and 100% of the rated accuracy 
power with an inductive power factor of 0.8. 
 
 
The standardized IEC accuracy classes are: 0.1 - 0.2 - 0.5 - 1 - 3. 
 
– Classes 0.1 and 0.2 are only used for laboratory devices.

Protection Functions and their Applications 
 
Protection functions are provided by relays or multifunctional devices like the 
Schneider Sepam. 
 
 
Protective relays (or multifunctional devices) are devices that permanently 
compare the electrical variables of networks (such as current, voltage, frequency, 
power, and impedances) with predetermined values, and then automatically emit 
orders for action (usually the opening of a circuit-breaker) or give off an alarm 
when the monitored value goes above the threshold. 
 
 
The role of protective relays is to detect any kind of abnormal phenomena that 
may arise in an electrical circuit, such as short-circuits, variation in voltage, machine 
faults, etc. 
 
 
The relay may be:  
– without auxiliary power (autonomous) when the energy required for it to 
operate is supplied directly by the monitored circuit (see Figure 7-1). The actuator 
must be sensitive because the energy supplied by the circuit is limited; 
– with auxiliary power supply when the energy required for it to operate is 
supplied by an auxiliary voltage source (AC or DC) independent of the circuit 
monitored (see Figure 7-2).

7.1. Phase overcurrent protection (ANSI code 50 or 51) 
 
The function of this protection is to detect single-phase, two-phase or three-
phase overcurrents. 
 

Protection Functions and their Applications     209 
 
 
Protection is activated when one, two or three of the currents concerned rise 
above the specified setting threshold. 
 
 
This protection can be time delayed and in this case will only be activated if the 
current monitored rises above the setting threshold for a period of time at least equal 
to the time delay selected. This delay can be an independent (definite) time or 
inverse time delay.

The current threshold and the time delay are generally set by the user. 
Inverse time protection 
 
The time delay depends on the ratio between the current measured and the 
operating threshold. The higher the current means the shorter the time delay (see 
Figure 7-4).

Inverse time protection operation is defined by standards IEC 60255-3 and 
BS 142. These standards define several types of inverse time protection that are 
distinguished by the gradient of their curves: standard inverse, very inverse or 
extremely inverse time protection. For example, the Schneider Sepam 2000 
proposes the curves in Figure 7-5 set for a time delay of 1 second (implies an 
operating delay of 1 second for

The protection is set so that it is as sensitive as possible in order to detect low 
earth fault currents. 
Residual current measurement 
 
The residual current characterizing the earth fault current is obtained in one of 
the following two ways: 
– by a core balance transformer through which the three phase conductors pass. 
The toroid turns encircle a magnetic flux φrsd such that

φ  (see 
Figure 7-6). φ1,φ2 and φ3 are proportional to the phase currents I1, I2 and I3, and φrsd 
is thus proportional to the residual current. 
 
The earthing strap shown in Figure 7-6 must go through the toroid so that an 
internal cable fault (core-shield) can be detected. Indeed, in the opposite case, the 
short-circuit current circulates in the cable core and comes back via the shield. It is 
therefore not detected by the toroid; 
 
– by three current transformers whose neutrals are connected, thus making the 
sum

Minimum threshold setting of earth protection 
 
There is a risk of spurious tripping of the protection due to measurement error of 
the residual current, specifically in the presence of transient currents. In order to 
prevent this risk, protection setting must be above: 
– approximately 12% of the nominal rating of the CTs when measurement is 
carried out using three current transformers; 

212     Protection of Electrical Networks 
– 1 A for a time delay of 0.1 second when measurement is carried out using a 
core balance. 
Making protection insensitive to third and multiples of third harmonics 
 
Protection must be made insensitive to third and multiples of third harmonics 
that may come from the network or from the saturation of the CTs during high pick-
up currents or transient operating conditions including aperiodic components. 
 
 
Indeed, third and multiples of third harmonics are detected by the protection as a 
residual current because they are in phase.

We can also see graphically that the third harmonics are in phase (see Figure

Protection Functions and their Applications     213 
 
 
In the absence of an earth fault, the residual current is equal to three times the 
sum of third and multiples of third harmonics that circulate in each phase. 
 
 
It is thus important to make protection insensitive to third and multiples of third 
harmonics so as not to cause spurious tripping.

7.3. Directional overcurrent protection (ANSI code 67) 
 
This has a phase overcurrent function defined in section 7.1 associated with a 
“current direction” detection function. It is used, for example, when a busbar is fed 
by two sources (see Figure 7-9).

When a fault occurs at A, the two short-circuit currents 
1
sc
I
 and 
2
sc
I
 are 
simultaneously established. A fault current flows through the four protection 
devices: P1, P2, P3 and P4. Now in order to clear the fault without interrupting th,e 
power supply to the feeders, only circuit-breakers CB1 and CB2 must trip. 
 
 
In order to do this, directional phase overcurrent protection devices are installed 
at P2 and P3: 
– Protection P3 is not activated when a current circulating in the opposite 
direction to its detection direction flows through it. 
– Protection P2 is activated when a current circulating in its detection direction 
flows through it. It causes the circuit-breaker CB2 to trip and the current Isc2  is 
interrupted. An inter-tripping system causes CB1 to trip and the current Isc1 is 
interrupted. 
– Protection P4, which is time delayed, is not activated. 
 
 
The faulty section is thus isolated. 
 
 
It is said that the protection detects the “direction of the current”; in reality it 
detects the sign of the active power. Thus, the phase displacement ϕ sc  between the 
voltage and the short-circuit current must be known. 
 
 
The directional protection at P3 detects a short-circuit current circulating from 
the transformer towards the busbar. The active power detected by the protection is

To determine the phase displacement 
sc
ϕ
, the current of one phase must be 
compared in relation to a polarizing voltage. 
 
 
For a current in phase 1, the most frequently applied polarizing voltage is the 
phase-to-phase voltage between phases 2 and 3, i.e. the voltage perpendicular to the 
current I1 for zero phase displacement (see Figure 7-10). 
 

216     Protection of Electrical Networks 
 
Similarly, for a current in phase 3, the polarizing voltage chosen is the phase-to-
phase voltage between phases 1 and 2 (see Figure 7-11).

The protection connection angle is said to be 90°. 
 
 
Two relays are sufficient for the balanced three-phase short-circuit and the three 
phase-to-phase short-circuits to show up, for example, on phase 1 and on phase 3. 
Indeed, whatever the phase-to-phase short-circuit, it will concern either phase 1  
or 3. 
 
 
The choice of polarizing voltage is explained as follows. 
 
 
For the current on phase 1: 
– when a three-phase short-circuit occurs, the voltage detected by the protection 
is low, so it is better to use a phase-to-phase voltage; 
– when a phase-to-phase short-circuit occurs between phases 1 and 2, the 
voltage U12  is very low, possibly zero, if the fault occurs close to the protection. 
Similarly, when a short-circuit between phases 1 and 3 occurs, the voltage U13 may 
be low and the phase-to-phase voltage U32 must therefore be taken to guarantee a 
sufficient voltage amplitude. 
 
 
For the current on phase 3: 
– using the same reasoning, the polarizing voltage is U21.

7.3.1. Operation 
Directional phase overcurrent protection is activated if the following two 
conditions apply to a time equal to the time delay chosen: 
– the current is higher than the setting threshold; 
– the current phase in relation to the polarizing voltage is in a range referred to 
as the tripping zone. 
 
The protection tripping zone is a half plane. This half plane is defined by a 
characteristic angle θ, which is the angle of the line perpendicular to the boundary line 
between the two zones and the polarization vector (see Figure 7-12 for θ  = 45°).

Why is a characteristic angle θ  introduced? 
This angle is related to the natural phase displacement of the current in relation 
to the voltage when a short-circuit occurs. We shall study this phase displacement 
for two types of possible short-circuits: the symmetrical three-phase, and the phase-
to-phase short-circuits. 
Phase displacement upon occurrence of a symmetrical three-phase short-circuit 
The network upstream of the short-circuit is equivalent to a resistor R in series 
with a reactor X  and the ratio R
X  is between 0.05 and 0.3 in MV (see section 
4.1.1). The natural phase displacement ϕ  between the voltage and the current for 
each phase is such that

7.4. Directional earth fault protection (ANSI code 67 N) 
This has an earth function defined in section 7.2 associated with a “current 
direction” detection function. 
 
The protection is activated when the amplitude of the residual current rises 
above the setting threshold and when its phase displacement in relation to a 
polarizing voltage is inside a pre-defined zone. 
 
The polarizing voltage used is the residual voltage.

7.4.1. Operation 
The directional earth fault protection is activated when the following two 
conditions apply for a period equal to the time delay chosen: 
– the residual current is higher than the setting threshold; 
– the residual current phase in relation to the residual voltage phase is in a range 
referred to as the tripping zone. 
 
The protection tripping zone is a half plane. 
 
This half plane is defined by a characteristic angle 
rsd
θ
, which is the angle of the 
line perpendicular to the boundary line between the two zones and the residual 
voltage (see Figure 7-17).

Use of directional earth fault protection 
This is used in one of the following two ways: 
– to detect the direction of the earth fault current; 
– to distinguish between a fault current and a capacitive current. This is 
necessary when the network is: 
- unearthed; 
- earthed with a limiting resistance when the network is fairly widespread, 
thus leading to high capacitive currents upon occurrence of a phase-to-earth fault 
(see section 4.3.5). 
 
It is not suitable for Petersen coil earthed networks. 
Polarization by measuring the current in the neutral earthing connection 
In the case of limiting resistance earthing, polarization can be affected using the 
measurement of the current in the neutral earthing connection. Indeed, we saw in 
section 4.3 that for a phase-to-earth fault, the current circulating in the neutral 
earthing resistor is:

 In what follows, 
rsd

 will be 
used to help clarify explanations. 
 
Polarization using the current circulating in the neutral earthing connection can 
be useful, especially in the following two cases: 
– when it is more economical to measure this current than the residual voltage (a 
toroid costs less than 3 VTs); 
– the neutral is earthed via a low impedance (fault current above 300 A), and the 
residual voltage is low in the event of a resistive fault. Polarization using the current 
circulating in the neutral earthing connection will therefore be more efficient than 
polarization by the residual voltage.

When a fault occurs at A, the two limiting currents 
1
IA  and 
2
IA  are simultaneously 
established. A fault current flows through protection devices P1 and P2.  
 
To clear the fault without cutting off the feeder power supply, only circuit-
breakers CB1 and CB3 must be tripped. To do this, directional earth fault protection 
devices must be installed at P1 and P2. They will allow circuit-breakers CB1 and 
CB3 to be tripped and circuit-breaker CB2 to remain closed.

For a network with two parallel incoming feeders, the length of the incoming 
links is generally fairly short. The capacitive currents of these links are therefore 
low compared with those of the feeders. Thus, it is not useful to install directional 
earth fault protection devices to obtain selectivity between the two incoming 
feeders: for example, see section 10.1.5.2, Figure 10-11. 
In the case of a network with two long parallel incoming feeders, directional 
earth fault protection must be installed. It allows the direction of capacitive currents 
to be detected and tripping on the healthy incoming feeder link to be avoided. The 
characteristic angle must therefore be set at 90° since the fault currents are only 
capacitive. 
Another case where it is used is for a network with two incoming feeders in a 
loop arrangement (see section 10.1.6.2, Figure 10-15). Directional protection 
devices are combined with a logical exchange system. The currents detected by the 
protection devices are only capacitive and the characteristic angle θ rsd  is thus set 
at ± 90°, depending on the detection direction required.

Whatever the network configuration, care must be taken to make sure that, for a

leads to a capacitive current that is higher than the setting threshold. 
 
Consequently, when the feeders are all short, it is not possible to select one 
feeder from the others owing to the minimum setting threshold (

Care must therefore be taken to make sure that, whatever the network 
configuration with N feeders, the length of N-1 feeders is above 670 m. This 
condition allows selectivity between feeders to be obtained. 
 
Note: when this condition is not met, an automatic device that successively trips 
each feeder and tests the PIM (Permanent Insulation Monitor; see section 2.4.1) or 
the residual overvoltage protection (see section 7.16) can be installed to determine 
the faulty feeder. However, this is not advisable because it leads to switching on 
healthy feeders and overvoltages that have the ability to cause a double fault. 
7.5. Directional earth fault protection for compensated neutral networks (ANSI 
code 67 N) 
 
Protection is activated when the following two conditions apply for a period 
equal to the time delay chosen: 
– the active component of the residual current is higher than the setting 
threshold; 
– this component is in the detection direction chosen. 
 
 
In Figure 7-24, the detection direction is the opposite direction to the residual 
voltage. 
 
The “active” component of the residual current is the projection of the residual 
current onto the line defined by the residual voltage.

The current Irsd2  activates protection whereas the current Irsd1 does not

This protection is used to protect feeders in a network with a Petersen coil 
earthing system (compensated neutral network). It enables the distinction between a 
current from a faulty feeder and a capacitive current from a healthy feeder. 
 
For detail about the residual current and residual voltage measuring method and 
the value of the residual voltage upon occurrence of a solid phase-to-earth fault, 
refer to sections 7.2 and 7.4.

The fault current does not have an “active” component and therefore the 
protection cannot be operational. 
 
In practice, in order to detect an “active” current component upon occurrence of 
a fault, a resistor is added in parallel with the coil (see Figure 7-25). 
 
The resistor has a high value so that the fault current can be held at several  
amps only.

The current Irsdf  may be located above or below the line defined by Vrsd and 
have a large amplitude that is greater or smaller according to the quality of tuning 
between the coil and network capacitance. 
 
Since the capacitance varies in accordance with the network configuration or 
implementation of new links, tuning is never perfect. 
 
To make it as good as possible, it is preferable to install a variable inductance 
coil. 
 
Current threshold setting: this is set as low as possible, in accordance with the 
minimum threshold (see section 7.2). 
 
Note: the possible Irsdf  zone is close to Irsdi  (see Figure 7-27), which is why 
directional earth fault protection cannot be used because it may cause spurious 
tripping. 
7.6. Differential protection 
 
The principle of differential protection consists of comparing two currents from 
the same phase that are normally equal. If the current entering into the protected 
zone is not equal to the current leaving this zone, the current differences at the ends 
of the protected zone give the fault current measurement (see Figure 7-28):

The current measured in the differential branch is approximately zero in normal

the fault current when this occurs inside the protected zone. 
 
This diagram can be used for phase-to-phase faults (two-phase or three-phase) 
and phase-to-earth faults with one differential branch per phase (see Figure 7-30), or 
it can be used only for phase-to-earth faults by connecting the three phases so that 
the summation of currents of each phase is affected (see Figure 7-31). The residual 
current Irsd  is the sum of the currents of the 3 phases and it corresponds to the 
current flowing through earth (see section 7.2, under the heading “Residual current 
measurement”).

7.6.1.1. Operation and dimensioning of elements 
 
The operation of high impedance differential protection would not be a problem 
if the secondary currents supplied by the currents’ transformers were exactly the 
same as the primary currents at every moment. 
 
 
However, current transformers can saturate when a short-circuit occurs outside 
the protected zone, even if the short-circuit current value is lower than the accuracy 
limit factor (see section 6.1.3.5) or if the secondary voltage corresponding to this 
currrent is lower than the knee-point voltage (see section 6.1.3.6). 
 
 
Indeed, the short-circuit current has an aperiodic component (see section 4.1.1), 
which has a maximum value of approximately 40 to 80% of the peak value of the 
AC component and lasts between 50 to 100 ms. This (decreasing exponential) 
aperiodic component favors saturation of the magnetic circuit. 
 
 
Indeed, the magnetic induction B(t) is proportional to 
( )
sc
I
t dt
∫
 (see section 
6.1.2). The aperiodic component integral will make B increase beyond the saturation 
limit (see Figure 6-4). 
 
 
Saturation may cause spurious tripping of the protection, as we shall see. 
 
 
When a fault occurs outside the protected zone, the current transformers at each 
end detect the fault and may be affected by the saturation. The current transformer 
specifications cannot be perfectly identical. One may be saturated more or less than 
the other or not be saturated at all, which leads to a difference of current

 flowing in the differential branch and may cause spurious activation of 
the protection. 
Incorporation of a stabilizing resistor in the differential branch 
 
To overcome the problem of spurious tripping, care must be taken to make sure 
that, in the event of saturation of one or both of the current transformers upon 
occurrence of a short-circuit outside the protected zone, the current flowing in the 
differential branch is lower than the protection setting threshold. To do this, a 
resistor Rs is incorporated in the differential branch (see Figure 7-32) to increase 
the circuit impedance. 
 
 
In the following calculations the relay resistance is included in the stabilizing 
resistance so that the equations are not too long. The relay resistance is generally 
negligible.

Let us consider the most problematic case: a fault appears outside the protected 
zone and one of the current transformers saturates, whereas the other does not. 
Let us assume, for example, that B is saturated and that A supplies a secondary 
current that has exactly the same value as the primary current. 
Let us look again at the diagram in Figure 7-32a, adding the equivalent diagram 
of the current transformers (see section 6.1.1) and resistance of the connecting wires 
linking the CT to the differential branch. The inductance of the connecting wires can 
be neglected because they have a small cross-sectional area dimensioned for a 
current lower than 5 A (

Let us simplify the electrical diagram using the following hypotheses:  
– transformer B is saturated; its magnetizing current is very high and therefore 
its magnetizing inductance tends towards zero (see section 6.1.2). We shall take it as 
being equal to zero; 
– transformer A is not saturated; its magnetizing current is very low and its 
magnetizing inductance is therefore very high. We shall take it as being infinite. 
 
 
Therefore, this gives us the simplified equivalent diagram shown in Figure 7-33.

Dimensioning current transformers 
 
Care must be taken to make sure that current transformers are dimensioned so 
that the voltage at the terminals of the differential branch is sufficient to activate 
protection in the event of a fault occurring in the protected zone. 
 
 
Let us now study the case of a solid fault inside the protected zone.

Limiting voltage peaks using a non-linear resistor 
 
When a short-circuit, with an approximate three-phase maximum 
sc
I
 value, 
occurs inside the protected zone, the CT is greatly saturated and very high voltage 
peaks occur (see CT saturation phenomenon at section 6.1.2). 
 
Indeed, the CT dimensioning condition shows that the knee-point voltage can be 
reached for a fault current equal to 2 set
I
. If we again look at the example of the 
short-circuit current equal to 100 set
I
, without saturation of the CT we would have 
a voltage equal to 50 times the knee-point voltage 
K
V .

For a CT knee-point voltage of 200 V, the voltage peak is 4,000 V. 
 
These voltage peaks may damage the current transformer, the secondary circuit 
wiring and the differential protection, which are not dimensioned to receive such 
voltage levels. Non-linear resistors in parallel with the differential branch are 
therefore used in order to limit the voltage at the CT terminals to between 1 and  
2 kV, which is the permissible voltage peak for low voltage equipment.

Let us assume that the fault current I f  causes a current Iset  in the differential 
branch. 
 
The voltage Vs created by the Iset  current flowing through the stabilizing 
resistor imposes the voltage at the terminals of the non-linear resistor and at the 
terminals of the two CT magnetizing inductances. 
 
This results in the three currents Ima , Imb , and IRN  flowing in the same 
direction. 
 
It is possible to check that the voltage at the terminals of the magnetizing 
inductances is close to Vs (voltage at the stabilizing resistor terminals).

The magnetizing current is thus the magnetizing current of the CTs when the 
secondary voltage is equal to half the knee-point voltage. 
 
This value can be obtained using the magnetizing current curves given by CT 
manufacturers. 
 
The order of magnitude of the magnetizing current for a voltage 2
K
V
 is 1.5% of 
the CT nominal current, which is 75 mA for a 5 A CT and 15 mA for a 1 A CT. 
 
The minimum protection setting threshold is 5% of the nominal current. The 
minimum fault current that can be detected is thus 2 × 1.5% + 5% = 8% of the 
nominal current (with the non-linear resistor leakage current being neglected). 
 
When differential protection is only used to detect phase-to-earth faults by 
connecting the CTs three phases so that the summation of the currents of each phase 
is affected (see Figure 7-31), the minimum fault current that can be detected is:

Indeed, a magnetizing current circulates in the six current transformers. 
 
Therefore, we may conclude that the magnetizing current limits protection

sensitive to low fault currents is required. 
7.6.1.2. Application of high impedance differential protection 
 
This is a question of determining the stabilizing resistance Rs, dimensioning the 
current transformers by calculating the minimum knee-point voltage required, and 
determining the minimum fault current that can be detected.

This assembly does not require a stabilizing resistor as there is no risk of the CTs 
saturating when the motor is started up. Indeed, each CT measures the difference 
between the current of the winding upstream and downstream links and is therefore 
only sensitive to a fault current. 
7.6.1.2.2. Generator differential protection (ANSI code 87 G) 
 
Generator differential protection can be used as long as the two terminals of each 
stator winding are accessible (see Figure 7-36). 
 
The maximum current for which protection must remain stable is the generator 
short-circuit current (see section 4.1.2).

The protection operating time is almost instantaneous (it is not time-delayed), 
and the short-circuit current to be taken into account is therefore the current 
occurring during the subtransient period which is approximately 5 to 10 In  (see 
section 4.1.2).

7.6.1.2.3. Busbar differential protection (ANSI code 87 B) 
 
Busbars can be protected by considering that the protected zone does not only 
have two ends but a number q of ends that is generally above 2. 
 
The differential protection will compare the sum of currents entering the busbar 
to the sum of currents leaving the busbar. If the two sums are equal the busbar is 
healthy, and if they are not, it is faulty. 
 
Let us consider, for example, the diagram in Figure 7-38.

If protection against phase-to-phase and phase-to-earth faults is required, this 
assembly must be reproduced for each phase. 
 
If phase-to-earth fault protection only is required, the summation of the currents 
of the three phases must be affected for each source and each feeder. The current 
sums of the three phases are then compared. 
 
The maximum current for which protection must remain stable is the short-
circuit current corresponding to the sum of the maximum short-circuit currents of 
each source.

7.6.1.2.4. Restricted earth fault differential protection (ANSI codes 87 N or REF) 
This is also abbreviated to REF (Restricted Earth Fault). 
This is used to protect a transformer against earth faults. 
Two different assemblies can be used depending on whether the transformer 
neutral is earthed or not.

Figure 7-40: restricted earth fault differential protection of a directly earthed  
or a limiting impedance earthed transformer 
The residual current Irsd  is the sum of the currents of the three phases. It is 
equal to the earth fault current flowing through the CTs (see section 7.2, under the 
heading “Residual current measurement”). 
If the earth fault is outside the transformer, the residual current is equal to the 
current that circulates in the earthing connection and there is no current in the 
differential branch. 

Protection Functions and their Applications     263 
 
If the fault is inside the transformer, the residual current flows in the opposite 
direction to the current circulating in the earthing connection. There is thus a current 
in the differential branch. In this case, the residual current, if there is one, is 
supplied by another transformer that is earthed (or an earthing transformer). 
The maximum current for which protection must remain stable is the secondary 
three-phase short-circuit current.

an earthing connection or an earthing transformer in the network.

7.6.1.3. Note about the application of high impedance differential protection

where: 
Rct  : resistance of current transformer windings. 
Rw  : resistance of wires linking the current transformers from one end of the 
protected zone to the other. Indeed, if the cables were very long the relay would be 
located at one end or the other. 
Rw  would therefore be high for a long cable length resulting in a very high 
knee-point voltage, which would mean using impossible current transformer 
dimensions. 
The way to establish differential protection for long lines or cables is to have a 
low CT burden impedance regardless of the length of the cable. An example of this 
is differential protection using pilot wires, which is explained in section 7.6.2 below. 
7.6.2. Pilot wire differential protection for cables or lines (ANSI code 87 L) 
 
This type of differential protection is biased for reasons that will be explained 
later on. It is activated when the differential current reaches a certain percentage of 
the through current.

n =   1

The maximum error at In  is ± 1% (see section 6.1.3.5).

Another serious problem exists because, with the pilot wire often being very

Figure 7-46: pilot wire capacitive current compensation 
 
The voltage Vin , which is proportional to the input current, is applied to the 
primary of a transformer whose secondary has a middle point. The secondary 
winding is connected to the pilot wire and a compensating dipole made up of the 
capacitance 2
C  that generates a current in Ra  in the opposite direction to the current 
generated by the pilot capacitance 2
*
C . 
 
In practice, compensation is not perfect and low current thus flows through the 
resistor Ra . 
 
 
Nevertheless, it is generally sufficient to solve the problem of pilot capacitive 
currents. 
Problem relating to overvoltage 
 
Then an earth fault occurs in a substation, a rise in the potential of the exposed 
conductive parts occurs owing to the passage of the fault current in the substation 
earth resistance. Since the exposed conductive parts of all the equipment are 
connected to the same earth, the rise in potential of all the parts does not create any 
local problems. However, the pilot link transmits this potential to the other end of 
the protected line, to a piece of equipment whose exposed conductive part is at the 
earth potential. The differential protective relay at one end may thus be submitted to 
high voltages applied between the pilot wire connection and the exposed conductive 
part. This is why isolating transformers are generally inserted on the pilot wires to 
allow the relay to withstand the voltage up to levels of approximately 15 kV.  

272     Protection of Electrical Networks 
 
For the capacitive current compensation to continue to work, it is necessary to 
attack the compensating dipole across an isolating transformer that is entirely 
identical to the previous one. 
This gives us the diagram in Figure 7-47.

Problem relating to the induced voltage on the pilot wire 
When a phase-to-earth fault occurs outside the protected zone with a high fault 
current  I f , the mutual impedance between the power cable and the pilot wire will 
induce a voltage (see section 5.7) that will generate a parasitic current in Ra  that 
might cause spurious tripping. 
 
It is impossible to discriminate between this parasitic current and the current 
circulating in the pilot wire in the event of an internal fault. 
 
One way of solving this problem is to twist the two pilot wires, thus greatly 
reducing the induced voltage. Indeed, when the wires are crossed, the induced 
voltage is in the opposite direction. 
 
If this does not work sufficiently, the pilot wire must be moved away from the 
power cable, which, from an economic point of view, is rarely possible since the 
cost of an extra trench would be too much. 
Problem related to monitoring the pilot wire 
The pilot wire is a vital part of the differential protection because it is this line 
which carries the information from one end of the cable to be protected to the other. 

Protection Functions and their Applications     273 
 
This pilot wire is a fairly vulnerable part of the protection, especially in urban 
supply networks where numerous roadworks may damage it. For this type of 
differential protection to be reliable, it is important to fit it with a monitoring device 
that is able to detect all kinds of pilot wire faults (cut, short-circuit, etc.) wherever 
they are located. 
 
To avoid the risk of spurious tripping when damage to the pilot wire occurs, the 
monitoring device must lock the protection. 
 
The differential protection therefore must be time delayed for a period equal to 
the transmission and locking order processing time. 
 
If this is not the case, damage to the pilot wire may activate the protection, which 
may jeopardize service continuity. 
Other solutions to the transmission of information problem 
First solution 
This consists of transmitting the information via currents with frequencies other 
than 50 Hz (or 60 Hz), in other words, by transmitting a coded message on the pilot 
wire using carrier frequencies between 400 and 2,400 Hz, for example. 
 
This solution immediately provides the following advantages: 
– with the carrier currents having very different frequencies from the current at 
50 Hz, overcoming the problem of induced voltages in the pilot wire in the event of 
a fault on the power line outside the protected zone is very easy using a filtering 
technique; 
– the coding of information allows the current measurement information to be 
transmitted regardless of the R* and C* pilot wire specifications. This results in 
accurate protection, which is not sensitive to the length of the link; 
– monitoring the state of the pilot wire is easy and the differential protection 
does not need to be time delayed. Indeed, the current equality information is 
supplied by a coded message. When damage to the pilot wire occurs, the 
information is absent but does not cause the protection to be activated. 
Second solution 
This consists of transmitting the information numerically via optical fiber links. 
This solution provides the same advantages as the previous solution. 
 
However, it is more costly as it requires an analog-digital conversion and a 
converter allowing the electrical signal to be converted to a “light” wave.

Method to establish economical three-phase protection 
To simplify and reduce the cost of a three-phase link protection, a summating 
transformer that produces the weighted sum of the CT currents of the three phases is 
used. 
 
This protection works well against all types of fault as long as the earthing 
system is direct or via a limiting impedance (with a high enough limiting current). 
 
This summating transformer is able to supply a single-phase secondary current 
whatever the type of fault. 
 
It produces the sum: I

This three-phase type protection, which requires a relatively low investment, 
therefore constitutes an interesting solution for three-phase cable protection. 
 
Note: manufacturers do not provide the protection operating curve. They only 
supply the protection sensitivity and guarantee that it will work for higher short-
circuit current values. 
7.6.3. Transformer differential protection (ANSI code 87 T) 
Transformer differential protection protects against short-circuits between turns 
of a winding and between windings that correspond to phase-to-phase or three-
phase type short-circuits. 
 
If there is no earthing connection at the transformer location point, this 
protection can also be used to protect against earth faults. If the earth fault current is 
limited by an impedance, it is generally not possible to set the current threshold to a 
value less than the limiting current. The protection must be then carried out by a 
high impedance differential protection. 
 
Transformer differential protection operates very quickly, roughly 30 ms, which 
allows any transformer deterioration in the event of a short-circuit between 
windings to be avoided. 
 
Transformers cannot be differentially protected using high impedance 
differential protection for phase-to-phase short-circuit due to the natural differential 
currents that occur: 
– the transformer inrush currents. The operating speed required means that a 
time delay longer than the duration of this current cannot be used (several tenths of 
a second); 
– the action of the on-load tap changer causes a differential current. 
 
The characteristics of transformer differential protection are related to the 
transformer specifications: 
– transformation ratio between the current entering Iin  and the current leaving 
Iout ; 
– primary and secondary coupling method; 
– inrush current; 
– permanent magnetizing current. 
 
The block diagram is shown in Figure 7-49.

278     Protection of Electrical Networks 
In order to prevent tripping upon occurrence of high fault currents of external 
origin, biased differential protection devices are used. This is because of: 
– the differential current due to the on-load tap changer; 
– the current transformer measurement errors, as for pilot wire differential 
protection for cables or lines (see section 7.6.2).

Problem relating to the transformation ratio and the coupling method 
The primary and secondary currents have different amplitudes owing to the 
transformation ratio and different phases depending on the coupling method (delta-
star transformer makes a phase displacement of 30°). Therefore, the current values 
measured must be readjusted so that the signals compared are equal during normal 
operation. This is done using matching auxiliary transformers whose role is to 
balance the amplitudes and phases. 
 
When one side of the transformer is star-connected with an earthed neutral, the 
matching transformers located on this side are delta-connected, so that the residual 
currents that would be detected upon occurrence of an earth fault outside the 
transformer are cleared. 
Problem relating to the transformer inrush current 
Transformer switching causes a very high transient current (from 8 to 15 In ), 
which only flows through the primary winding and lasts several tenths of a second 
(see section 10.3.1). It is thus detected by the protection as a differential current and 
it lasts far longer than the protection operating time (30 ms). Detection based only 
on the difference between the transformer primary and secondary currents would 
cause the protection to be activated. Therefore, the protection must be able to 
distinguish between a differential current due to a fault and a differential inrush 
current. 
Experience has shown that the inrush current wave contains at least 20% of 
second harmonic components (current at a frequency of 100 Hz), while this 
percentage is never higher than 5% upon occurrence of an overcurrent due to a fault 
inside the transformer. 
 
The protection must therefore simply be locked when the percentage of second 
harmonic component in relation to the fundamental harmonic component (current at 
50 Hz) is higher than 15%, i.e. I

Problem relating to the magnetizing current upon occurrence of an overvoltage of 
external origin 
The magnetizing current constitutes a difference between the transformer 
primary and secondary currents (see section 6.1.1). It is therefore detected as a fault 
current by the differential protection even though it is not due to a fault. In normal 
operating conditions, this magnetizing current is very low and does not reach the 
protection operating threshold. 
 
However, when an overvoltage occurs outside the transformer, the magnetic 
material saturates (in general the transformers are dimensioned to be able to operate 
at saturation limit for the nominal supply voltage), and the magnetizing current 
value greatly increases (see section 6.1.2). The protection operating threshold can 
therefore be reached. 
 
Experience has shown that the magnetizing current due to the magnetic 
saturation has a high rate of fifth harmonic components (current at a frequency of 
250 Hz). 
 
To prevent spurious tripping upon occurrence of an overvoltage of external 
origin, there are two solutions: 
– detect a rise in voltage that locks the protection; 
– detect saturation using the presence of fifth harmonic current that locks the 
protection. 
 
Transformer differential protection therefore requires fairly complex functions as 
it must be able to measure second and fifth harmonic currents or, in order to avoid 
measuring fifth harmonic currents, it must be able to detect overvoltages of external 
origin. 
7.7. Thermal overload protection (ANSI code 49) 
This is used to protect against machine overloads (motor, generator, transformer, 
etc.). It simulates the heat rise of the machine to be protected using the current 
measurement. 
Principle 
The protection determines the machine heat rise H using a thermal model

The thermal equilibrium equation must be calculated for a time dt (see Figure 7-51).

Note: thermal overload protection cannot be used against excessive motor start-
up time. Indeed, the motor start-up current is very high and its heat rise is 
approximately proportional to the square of the current, which means that it is very 
rapid. During start-up, the heat supply is not totally diffused in the motor and the 
local temperature at the location point of the windings and insulating material can be 
excessive.  
Thermal overload protection considers the overall heat capacity of the motor and 
an instantaneous heat diffusion and does not therefore take into account local heat 
rises. The result is that the thermal overload protection determines the heat rise 
caused by the start-up, but cannot protect a motor against excessive start-up time 
and rotor locking (see section 7.9). Therefore, it is particularly effective for 
protecting against slow overloads.

After a time τ corresponding to the time constant, the machine reaches 63% of 
its final overheating level, i.e. the heat rise of the machine if it had to withstand 
overheating for an infinite period of time (long enough for its temperature to 
stabilize). 
 
The thermal time constant of the machine is given by the manufacturers, or 
estimated or measured by the user. 
 
Thermal overload protection determines the development of the heat rise using 
knowledge of the time constant τ and the overload current Iol .

Specific properties of some thermal overload protective relays (example of the 
Sepam 2000) 
Influence of the negative sequence component 
To determine the heat rise of rotating machines, the relay takes into account the 
negative-sequence component. Indeed, the rotating field corresponding to the 
negative-sequence component induces a double frequency rotor current, which 

288     Protection of Electrical Networks 
causes considerable losses. This is why the Schneider Sepam 2000 thermal overload 
protection takes into account an equivalent current:

For an asynchronous motor, the choice is made in the following manner:

Time constant during cooling (motor stopped) 
For a motor, cooling takes place more efficiently when the motor is operating 
rather than when it is stopped because of the ventilation caused by the rotation.  
 
To take this phenomenon into account, the thermal time constant of the 
protection can take two values: 
– 
1τ  time constant during the heat rise (motor operating); 
– 
2
τ  time constant during cooling (motor stopped). 
7.8. Negative phase unbalance protection (ANSI code 46) 
This is used to protect a rotating machine (motor or generator) against current 
unbalances. 
 
This unbalance may come from: 
– the power source (transformer or generator), which does not supply a 
symmetrical three-phase voltage (for a motor, 1% of Vi  causes 7% of Ii ); 

Protection Functions and their Applications     289 
 
– other consumers who do not constitute a symmetrical load causing the power 
supply network to have a voltage unbalance; 
– from a two-phase power supply following a blown fuse or a phase being cut; 
– from an inversion of phases due to a connection error; 
– from the motor start-up. 
 
In a machine, the rotating field corresponding to the negative sequence 
component induces a double frequency rotor current, which causes considerable 
Joule losses. 
 
Negative phase unbalance protection makes it possible to prevent an excessive 
heat rise of the machine due to unbalance.

upon an earth fault in a machine. 
Setting indication for motors 
During the start-up time, the motor absorbs a negative-sequence current 
component of 20 to 30% of the nominal current. To prevent spurious tripping during 
start-up, and in order to have satisfactory settings, double threshold independent 
time protection or inverse time protection is used.

, time delay = 0.5 seconds. 
 
Using the high threshold, the cutting of a phase causing a major unbalance can 
be prevented. Switching must therefore be rapid so as not to damage the motor. 
Inverse time protection  
In order to prevent spurious tripping during start-up, the protection operating 
curve must be situated above the following co-ordinate point:

Setting indication for generators 
Generally, inverse time protection with a negative-sequence component current 
setting threshold fixed at 15% of In is used. 
 
The protection activation time must be several seconds at the setting threshold. 

292     Protection of Electrical Networks 
7.9. Excessive start-up time and locked rotor protection (ANSI code 51 LR) 
 
The principle is based on independent time overcurrent protection. 
Excessive start-up time 
When a machine is switched on, protection is activated if the current of one of 
the three phases is higher than the current threshold Iset for a time T (see Figure 7-
55). This time T must be above the maximum value of the normal start-up time Tst .

Figure 7-55: excessive start-up time  
 
The origin of start-up can be detected in one of the following two ways: 
– using the information that the switching device is closed; 
– when the current rises above a low threshold (for example, 5% of In ). 
Setting indications 
– the current setting threshold  Iset  is approximately 2

Protection Functions and their Applications     293 
 
– the time delay T  must be longer than the start-up time by several seconds for 
the lowest supply voltage. 
 
 
Note: some relays have a threshold fixed at 2.5 In  or 4 In . These thresholds are 
too high for motors fed by a start-up system limiting the current (e.g. an electronic 
starter). 
Rotor locking 
The protection is locked during start-up. 
 
In steady-state operating conditions, the protection is activated when the current 
of one of the three phases is higher than the current threshold Iset for a time 
exceeding the time delay Tlr. 
 
Figure 7-56 shows an example of rotor locking over a time exceeding the time 
delay.

Figure 7-56: rotor locking 
The locked rotor current Ilr  is equal to the start-up current of the motor without 
the start-up system. Indeed, the system is short-circuited after start-up. 
 
 
 

294     Protection of Electrical Networks 
Setting indications 
In most multifunctional relays, the threshold Is  of the excessive start-up and 
rotor locking functions is the same. Therefore, the two thresholds are identical. 
 
Iset  is approximately Ist
2  and must be higher than 1.3 In . 
 
The time delay Tlr  is between 0.5 and 1 second. 
 
 
Note 1: protection against excessive start-up time and rotor locking can be 
ensured by monitoring the motor speed. 
 
 
Note 2: to determine the time delay Tlr , the motor reacceleration time after a 
drop in voltage must be taken into account. Indeed, protection must not be activated 
due to an overcurrent caused by a voltage drop. 
7.10. Protection against too many successive start-ups (ANSI code 66) 
Too many successive start-ups may be due to: 
– the faulty operation of an automatic control device; 
– too many manual operations; 
– a series of reclosings when a fault occurs. 
 
The consequences are: 
– excessive rise in temperature; 
– a succession of mechanical shocks on the couplings. 
 
These problems can be avoided using a protection device that counts the number 
of start-ups carried out over a determined period of time. 
Principle 
During operating conditions in which the current is zero (motor inoperative), the 
protection counts a start-up every time the current rises above the setting threshold 
(for example, 5% of In ). 
 
The counter is reset at zero at the end of a period T1. T1 is the time interval for 
which the start-ups are considered to be successive. 
 
When the counter exceeds a fixed value, the protection prevents a new start-up 
for a time T2 . 

Protection Functions and their Applications     295 
 
Example (see Figure 7-57) 
 
The number of successive start-ups is limited to 4.

Specific features of the Schneider Sepam 2000 
– The Sepam offers the possibility of limiting the number of starts per hour, as 
well as limiting the number of successive starts. 
– It offers the possibility of limiting the number of hot starts. A hot start 
corresponds, for example, to the first thermal overload protection threshold being 
exceeded (see section 7.7). Operation is the same as for a cold start with a lower 
number of authorized starts. 
Setting indications 
The maximum amount of starts is generally given by the motor manufacturer. It 
does not only depend on the motor but on the load, the start-up system, and the 
short-circuit power at the motor connection point (voltage drop upon start-up). 
7.11. Phase undercurrent protection (ANSI code 37) 
This protection is used to protect pump unpriming or breaks in load coupling. 
 

296     Protection of Electrical Networks 
The unpriming of a suction pump can be due to the absence of liquid in the 
pump. 
 
Pump unpriming or a break in a coupling leads to off-load operation of the 
motor and therefore a drop in the current absorbed. 
 
Off-load operation of the motor can be detected using undercurrent protection. 
Principle 
The protection is activated when the current is lower than a threshold Iset . It is 
inactive when the motor is not operating, i.e. when the current is zero, for example, 
lower than 1.5%. 
 
It includes a definite time delay. 
 
The protection threshold is set between the motor off-load current and the 
minimum current normally absorbed (see Figure 7-58).

– no-load current < current threshold Iset  < minimum current normally 
absorbed; 
– the time delay setting is approximately 1 second. 

Protection Functions and their Applications     297 
 
7.12. Undervoltage protection (ANSI code 27) 
Voltage drops can be due to: 
– a network overload; 
– the faulty operation of a transformer tap changer; 
– a short-circuit. 
 
The consequences are an increase in motor Joule losses: 
– when switched on, the start torque and the maximum torque are proportional to 
the square of the voltage. A drop in voltage will lead to a longer start time and thus 
to considerable Joule losses, or, if the resistive torque is higher than the maximum 
torque, the rotor will stop; 
– during normal operation, the active power absorbed by the motor is

 The Joule losses equal to 3

The undervoltage protection will give the order for the motors to be tripped 
before they are damaged. 
 
This type of protection can also be used: 
– to monitor the operation of voltage regulators; 
– to load shed the non-priority consumer network when an overload occurs; 
– to monitor the voltage before sources are switched over. 
Principle 
The protection is activated when one of the voltages is lower than the threshold 
Uset . It includes a definite time delay. 
Setting indications 
Example for motor protection 
Voltage setting threshold from 0.75 to 0.8 Un . 
 
The time delay setting will be a compromise between: 
– the motor possibilities; 
– the load shedding program; 
– the protection scheme (the time delay required may be long). 

298     Protection of Electrical Networks 
7.13. Remanent undervoltage protection (ANSI code 27) 
After the opening of a circuit during an automatic switchover (or a short cut in 
the power supplied by the utility), the motors maintain a voltage for the time it takes 
for the flux to be extinguished. If the voltage supply is restored while the motors are 
operating as generators, this may lead to phase opposition coupling causing transient 
electrical and mechanical phenomena that might be damaging for the motor. 
 
The remanent undervoltage protection monitors the voltage of the busbar 
supplying the motors and authorizes the power supply to be restored if this voltage 
is lower than the threshold. 
Principle 
The protection is activated if the voltage is lower than the threshold Uset . It 
includes a definite time delay. 
 
It operates according to the same principle as the undervoltage protection (see 
section 7.12), but with a lower setting threshold. 
Setting threshold 
– voltage setting threshold from 20 to 25% of Un; 
– 0.1 second time delay. 
7.14. Positive sequence undervoltage and phase rotation direction protection 
(ANSI code 27 D - 47) 
 
This type of protection is used to protect motors. It performs two protection 
functions: 
– protects against positive-sequence voltage drops. The positive-sequence 
voltage accurately defines the motor torque value. It is therefore more accurate than 
the voltage measurement. The consequences of a drop in positive-sequence voltage 
are those indicated in section 7.12 (undervoltage protection); 
– protects against an inversion in phase rotation direction. An inverse phase 
rotation direction may be due to a cable connection error. This inversion leads to the 
motors operating in the opposite direction, which may be prejudicial to the 
mechanical load and, consequently, to the motor. 

Protection Functions and their Applications     299

Setting indications 
Against a drop in positive-sequence voltage 
 
Voltage setting threshold from 0.75 to 0.8 Vn . 
 
 
The time delay setting will be a compromise between: 
– the motor possibilities; 
– the load shedding scheme; 
– the protection scheme (the time delay required may be long). 
Against an inversion in phase rotation direction 
For the Schneider Sepam 2000, there is no setting and the protection decides that 
the phase rotation direction is inverse when both of the following conditions apply: 
– the positive sequence voltage calculated is lower than 10% of Vn ; 
– the voltage measured is higher than 80% of Vn . 
7.15. Overvoltage protection (ANSI code 59) 
This protection is used to protect equipment against an abnormally high voltage. 
 
It can also be used: 
– to check the presence of enough voltage to carry out a power supply transfer 
with, in this case, a threshold lower than Un; 
– to monitor the operation of voltage regulators. 
Principle 
The protection is activated when one of the phase-to-phase voltages is higher 
than the setting threshold Uset . 
 
Generally, it includes a definite time delay. 
Setting indications 
– For use against overvoltages, Uset  can be set at 1.1 Un  with a time delay of 
approximately 1 second. 

Protection Functions and their Applications     301 
 
– To check the presence of enough voltage, Uset  can be set at 0.95 Un  with a 
time delay of approximately 3 seconds to make sure that the voltage is stable before 
the power supply is switched over. 
7.16. Residual overvoltage protection (ANSI code 59 N) 
This protection is used to detect phase-to-earth faults. It notably allows the 
detection of the first fault in an unearthed neutral system. 
Principle 
The protection monitors the rise in neutral potential in relation to earth, which is 
the characteristic phenomenon of a phase-to-earth fault in the network. 
 
Let us assume there is a solid phase-to-earth fault (zero fault impedance) on 
phase 1 (see Figure 7-59).

Non-accessible neutral point

The residual voltage is therefore equal to three times the neutral potential in

Note: the residual voltage measurement can also be carried out via a voltage 
transformer with three windings whose tertiary is connected in an open delta 
arrangement (see Figure 7-15). 
Setting indications 
Measurement via single-phase voltage transformer: threshold set at 10% of Vn . 
 
Residual voltage measurement: threshold set at 30% of Vn  (10% of 3 Vn ). 
 
The time delay depends on the selectivity with the other network protection 
devices. 
7.17. Under or overfrequency protection (ANSI code 81) 
 
Variations in the power supply frequency may be due to: 
– overloads when the network is fed by a limited power source (internal 
generation plant operating while cut off from the utility network); 
– faulty operation of a generator frequency regulator; 
– cutting off of a generation plant from an interconnected network; 

Protection Functions and their Applications     303 
 
– power supply being cut off in an installation fitted with large motors. The 
motors then feed the installation the time it takes for the flux to be extinguished with 
a decreasing frequency. 
 
The consequences are: 
– the faulty operation of synchronous loads (recorders, clocks, etc.); 
– an increase in eddy current losses of the machines, these being proportional to 
the square of the frequency; 
– a variation in motor speed that may lead to the load being damaged. 
 
Under or overfrequency protection will allow: 
– loads to be shed by cutting off the power to non-priority consumers in the 
event of an overload; 
– the network to be cut up into several sub-networks in order to overcome 
problems relating to the stability of the machines. When this is the case, it is 
preferable to cut off the power supply to the motors; 
– micro-plants not fitted with synchronous control to be cut off; 
– the power supply to a plant fitted with large asynchronous motors to be cut off 
upon occurrence of a network micro-cut. 
Principle 
The protection compares the network frequency to a minimum or maximum 
threshold frequency. The protection is deactivated if the phase-to-phase voltage is 
lower than a predetermined threshold (for example 35% of Un). Generally, it 
includes a definite time delay. 
Setting indications 
– For internal generation: threshold set at ± 2 Hz of the nominal frequency. 
– For an interconnected network: threshold set at ± 0.5 Hz of the nominal 
frequency. 
– Time delay of several seconds. 
7.18. Protection against reversals in reactive power (ANSI code 32 Q) 
This protection is used to detect a loss in excitation of the synchronous machines 
connected to the network. 
 
Excitation of the synchronous machines is carried out by a direct current flowing 
through the rotor called the inductor and it is controlled by an excitation regulator. 

304     Protection of Electrical Networks 
The loss in excitation of a synchronous machine is due to a fault in the rotor 
circuit (cut, short-circuit, etc.). 
 
Upon occurrence of a loss in excitation, the machine compensates for the drop in 
magnetizing power by absorbing the reactive power on the network. The reactive 
power of the machine is thus negative. The protection detects the inversion of the 
sign of the machine’s reactive power. 
 
The loss in excitation of a generator previously connected to the network causes 
its resynchronization with the network. It then operates asynchronously at a slightly 
higher speed. This results in a temperature rise in the stator because the reactive 
current can be high, and a temperature rise in the rotor which is not dimensioned for 
induced currents. 
 
The loss in excitation of a synchronous motor will lead to a break in its 
synchronism resulting in it operating asynchronously. A high induced current will 
circulate in the rotor and cause it to heat up.

7.19. Protection against reversals in active power (ANSI code 32 P) 
This type of protection allows an inversion of the active power sign to be 
detected in the absence of an electrical fault. 
 
It is particularly used for: 
– preventing an internal generation plant from supplying the utility with power; 
– protecting a motor, which is cut off from its power supply, against generator 
operation when it is driven by its load; 

Protection Functions and their Applications     305 
 
– protecting a generator from working as a motor, which may damage the 
driving machine. 
Protection against reversals in active power from internal generation 
Reversals in active power can be due to a cut in the utility power supply or a 
high-speed or time-delayed automatic reclosing at the utility substation. 
 
When this happens, the internal generation plant feeds the other utility 
customers. 
 
Some of the consequences are: 
– an overload in the internal generation plant; 
– faulty selectivity if a fault occurs after the inversion of the active power sign. 
 
The protection determines the active power P  on the main busbar of the 
consumer substation and compares it to a threshold −Pset .

Protection against generator operation of asynchronous motors 
When there is a cut in the voltage supply, the synchronous motors, driven by the 
inertia of the load, operate as generators. They then feed the network for as long as 
it takes for the flux to be extinguished. 
 
When a short cut occurs, e.g. during a high-speed or time-delayed automatic 
reclosing, it is important to disconnect the motors from the network so that the 
motors are re-energized in optimal conditions. Any risk of phase opposition 
coupling must be avoided because this would cause transient electrical and 
mechanical phenomena that may damage the motor. 
 
The protection determines the active power P  of the motor and compares it to a 
threshold −Pset .

Protection of generators against motor operation 
When a failure occurs in the driving system of the generator (turbine, diesel set, 
etc.), the generator operates as a synchronous motor and may damage the driving 
system. 
 
The protection determines the active power P  of the generator and compares it 
to a threshold Pset  . 
 
It is activated if P

Setting indications

– between 1% and 5% of the nominal power for a turbine. 
 
The time delay is above or equal to 1 second. 
7.20. Tank earth leakage protection (ANSI code 50 or 51) 
This protection is designed to protect a transformer against internal faults 
between a winding and the frame. It is recommended when the transformer power 
reaches 5 MVA. 
Principle 
This type of protection is an overcurrent protection and it is installed on the 
transformer frame earthing connection. 
 
It requires the transformer to be insulated in relation to earth so that the fault 
current flows through the protection (see Figure 7-60).

It is selective because it is only sensitive to transformer frame-earth faults. 
 
Note: this protection can also be used to protect switchboards against frame-
earth faults (switchboard earth leakage protection). 
Setting indications 
The setting threshold of the current can be fixed at 20 A. 
 
For an earthing system using a limiting impedance, the threshold must be lower 
than or equal to 30% of the limiting current IA. 
 
For example, if 0.3

 the current threshold Iset  can be fixed at

The time delay is short if not zero. 
7.21. Protection against neutral earthing impedance overloads (ANSI code 50 N 
or 51 N) 
This protection allows the limiting impedance to be protected against the thermal 
effects of an overload. 
 
Indeed, when a phase-to-earth fault occurs on the network, the fault current is 
reclosed via the neutral earthing connection (see section 4.3). 
 
If the fault is resistive, the fault current may be lower than the earth fault 
protection thresholds and higher than the permanent current that the resistor can 

308     Protection of Electrical Networks 
withstand. A permanent current thus flows through the limiting impedance and may 
damage it. 
 
It can be protected using an overcurrent protection. 
Principle (see Figure 7-61)

7.22. Overall network earth fault protection by monitoring the current flowing 
through the earthing connection (ANSI code 50 N or 51 N, 50 G or 51 G) 
This protection allows network phase-to-earth faults to be detected. 
 
When a phase-to-earth fault occurs on the network, the fault current is reclosed 
via the neutral earthing connection (see section 4.3), and can be detected by the 
overall network earth fault protection.

It may be either of the definite time or inverse time type. 
Setting indications 
The threshold must be lower than the earth fault limiting current and depends on 
the selectivity system. 
 
The time delay must be longer than all the time delays of the other network earth 
fault protection devices (except when a logical selectivity scheme is installed: see 
section 9.3). 
7.23. Protection using temperature monitoring (ANSI code 38 – 49 T) 
This protection is used to monitor the internal temperature of a machine 
(transformer, generator, motor, etc.). It is associated with a platinum resistor type 
temperature probe inserted in the machine or on the bearings of a rotating machine. 
 
Temperature probes give excellent information for slow overloads. They are 
useful for operating machines that must, for a limited time period, withstand a load 

310     Protection of Electrical Networks 
current higher than the nominal current. Indeed, for slow variations in the load, it is 
quite permissible to accept a load current higher than the nominal current for as long 
as the temperature of the insulating material has not reached its permissible limit. 
The probes are, however, not very efficient at measuring rapid overloads because of 
the high value of the insulating material thermal time constant. Therefore, they 
should be used in association with overcurrent protection. 
 
The protection generally indicates the probe faults (probe disconnected or short-
circuited). 
 
It usually has an alarm threshold and a tripping threshold. 
 
Three-wire probes must be used to obtain correct measurement accuracy 
otherwise the measurement will be greatly falsified by the influence of the 
temperature on the resistance of the connecting wires (see Figure 7-63).

7.24. Voltage restrained overcurrent protection (ANSI code 50 V or 51 V) 
This protection is used to protect a generator against phase-to-phase faults 
downstream of the generator. It is particularly useful when the generator does not 
have a system for maintaining the short-circuit current at approximately 3 In  (see 
section 4.1.2). 
 
As described in section 4.1.2, the short-circuit current downstream of a generator 
develops according to the three following periods: 
– subtransient ( X d
'' ): lasting 10 to 20 ms after the start of the fault; 
– transient ( X d' ): lasting up to 100 to 400 ms; 
 – synchronous ( Xd ): steady-state or synchronous reactance to be considered 
after the transient period. 
 
The synchronous reactance occurs after a period of approximately 100 to  
400 ms. It has a value of roughly 200 to 350% (see Tables 4-3, 4-4 and 4-5). 
We therefore have a permanent three-phase short-circuit current

equal to between 0.3 and 0.5 In , as long as the generator is not fitted with a system 
allowing the short-circuit current to be held at approximately 3 In  (see section 
4.1.2). 
 
 
Note: the minimum permanent short-circuit current is obtained for a three-phase 
short-circuit and is, in this specific case, lower than the phase-to-phase short-circuit 
current clear of earth. Indeed, according to section 4.2.3, the phase-to-phase short-
circuit current clear of earth is:

The value of X ( )

Tables 4-3, 4-4 and 4-5), and can be neglected (Xd is 15 to 25 times higher than

This means that the permanent three-phase short-circuit current is lower than the 
permanent phase-to-phase short-circuit current downstream of a generator. 
 
Let us assume that, for reasons of selectivity, one wishes to protect the generator 
with a time delayed protection having a time longer than the transient period. The 
short-circuit current detected by the protection at the end of the time delay is lower 
than the nominal current (0.3 to 0.5In ), and it is therefore not possible to use 
conventional overcurrent protection. 
 
This is why voltage restrained overcurrent protection is used. 
Principle 
 
The current threshold is corrected by the voltage measurement (see Figure 7-64).

Due to the synchronous impedance being very high, the impedances of the 
cables and transformers downstream of the generator are negligible and do not 
therefore influence the value of the permanent short-circuit current. For the same 
reasons, upon occurrence of a short-circuit, the voltage measured at the location 
point of the generator is very low, i.e. lower than 0.2 Un . 
 
If the threshold Iso is set at 1.2 In , upon occurrence of a short-circuit 
downstream of the generator with the voltage dropping to a value lower than  
0.2 Un , the current threshold takes on the value

The protection is activated when one, two or three of the phase currents reach 
the current threshold corrected by the voltage.

This condition is met as long as the synchronous impedance Xd  is lower than 
415%, which is generally the case (see Tables 4-3, 4-4 and 4-5). 
 
The time delay, fixed by the selectivity system, can be longer than the duration 
of the transient period. 
 
 
Note: restrained voltage overcurrent protection is also referred to as minimum 
impedance protection. Indeed, according to Figure 7-64, we can see that the 
protection is activated for a constant ratio U
I
, i.e. a threshold impedance Zset. 
Physically, it can be said that the protection measures the impedance downstream 
and, when this is lower than the threshold Zset, the protection is activated. The low 
value of the downstream impedance is characteristic of a short-circuit or a high 
overload. 
7.25. Protection by gas, pressure and temperature detection (DGPT) 
The DGPT (detection of gas, pressure and temperature) is a protective device 
used for liquid-insulated transformers. 
 
It detects anomalies inside the liquid dielectric such as emission of gas, or a rise 
in pressure or temperature, and causes the transformer switching device (circuit-
breaker or switch-fuse) to trip. 
 
The relay units corresponding to these functions are mainly designed to protect 
“totally filled”, sealed and immersed transformers. 
 
This protection can carry out the following four functions. 
Detection of gaseous emission 
In a liquid-insulated transformer, an internal fault always causes a fairly large 
gaseous emission due to the decomposition of the insulating materials (liquids or 
solids) under the action of the electric arc. 
Detection of a sealing anomaly indicated by a drop in the dielectric level 
 
There are two levels of detection: 
– a visual indication of a drop in the level via a first red floater; 

Protection Functions and their Applications     315 
 
– electrical message to the switching device operating mechanism via a second 
floater when there is a large drop in the level. 
 
 
Note: the transformer can be easily refilled via the upper part of the relay unit. 
Detection of excessive pressure in the transformer tank using an electrical contact 
pressure switch 
This pressure switch is pre-set in the factory by the transformer manufacturer to 
between 0 and 500 millibars (normal value: 200 millibars). 
 
When an internal fault due to a high short-circuit current occurs, the gaseous 
emission causes the pressure switch to be activated in several tenths of a second. 
Detection of an abnormal temperature in the dielectric 
This detection is both visual (thermometer with 0 to 120°C graduations) and 
electrical (1 or 2 thermostats). These thermostats (liquid expansion-based) are 
independent and can be set to between 30 and 120°C (increments of 5°C), with one 
giving the alarm (normal setting: 95°C), and the other causing the switching device 
to trip (normal setting: 100°C). 
 
The sensitive part of the thermometer is located in the same pocket tube as that 
of the thermostat probes. 
 
 
Note: a Buchholz relay provides protection for a breathing transformer. For a 
fault that is not very serious, the gaseous emission is collected in an upper part of 
the relay and an alarm is activated when too much gas accumulates. For a serious 
fault, the large quantities of gas produced forcefully drives back part of the oil in the 
tank towards the conservator. A floater driven by the oil flux gives the order for the 
transformer to be put out of service. This principle leads to an operating time of 
several tenths of a second for a serious fault. 
7.26. Neutral to neutral unbalance protection (ANSI code 50 N or 51 N) 
This protection is designed to protect double star-connected capacitor banks (see 
Figure 7-65). 
 
The deterioration of the capacitor elements leads to an unbalance that causes a 
current to circulate between the two neutral points (see section 10.6.3). This current 
is detected by the protection, which causes the switching device to trip. 

316     Protection of Electrical Networks 
IN
 
Figure 7-65: protection of a double star-connected capacitor bank 
Principle

two neutral points rises above the setting threshold. 
 
The time delay may be either of the independent time or inverse time type.

Overcurrent Switching Devices 
Overcurrents in an electrical network may be caused by a short-circuit or an 
overload. The switching devices used to clear these overcurrents are circuit-breakers 
and fuses. 
 
In this chapter we will define the electrical specifications of fuses and circuit-
breakers. 
 
Since low and medium voltage specifications are different, they will be dealt 
with in separate sections. 
Definition 
 
Prospective short-circuit current: this is the short-circuit current in steady-state 
operating conditions that would occur if the impedance of the switching device was 
zero. 
8.1. Low voltage circuit-breakers 
Rated (1) operating voltage Ue 
This is, or these are, the voltage(s) at which the device can be used. 
Rated (1) current In  
This is the maximum value of the current that a circuit-breaker, fitted with a 
tripping relay, can withstand at an ambient temperature specified by the 
manufacturer and in compliance with the specified heating limits. 

318     Protection of Electrical Networks 
Nevertheless, a circuit-breaker can be used at higher ambient temperatures if it is 
derated. Thus, a circuit-breaker with a rated current of 125 A will only be able to 
withstand 117 A at 50°C and 109 A at 60°C. 
Frame-size rating of a circuit-breaker 
When a circuit-breaker is fitted with several tripping relays with different current 
ratings, the frame-size of the breaker matches the highest current rating of the 
tripping relays with which it can be fitted.

With the exception of small circuit-breakers (Multi 9 type for Schneider circuit-
breakers), which are easily replaced, industrial circuit-breakers are fitted with 
removable overcurrent-trip relays. Moreover, to adapt the circuit-breaker to the 
circuit specifications and to avoid the need to install oversized cables, the tripping 
relays are generally adjustable. 
 
The setting current Ir  (or Irth ) is the current that determines the protection 
conditions provided by the circuit-breaker. It also represents the maximum current 
that the circuit-breaker can withstand without tripping. 
 
This value must be greater than the operating current but less than the maximum 
current permitted in the trunking. The thermal-trip relays can generally be set 
between 0.7 and 1 × In , whereas in electronic devices the ranges are usually much 
wider (currently between 0.4 and 1 × In ). Setting is not continuous but is carried 
out in steps. This must be taken into account when studying the selectivity. 
Example (see Figure 8-1)

Short-circuit relay trip-current setting (Im)  
Short-circuit tripping relays (magnetic or slightly time delayed) are designed to 
cause high-speed opening of the circuit-breaker upon occurrence of high overcurrents. 
 
Their operating threshold Im is either fixed by standards (e.g. IEC 60898 for 
domestic circuit-breakers, or stipulated by the manufacturer for industrial circuit-
breakers governed by IEC 60947-2): 
– for the latter circuit-breakers, there is a wide variety of tripping relays allowing 
the user to adapt the protective functions of the device to the requirements of the 
circuit to be protected, even in the most specific cases; 
– for circuit-breakers with adjustable thresholds, setting is not continuous but 
carried out in steps. This must be taken into account when studying the selectivity. 
 
Table 8-1 gives the average circuit-breaker operating thresholds for overloads 
and short-circuits. Figures 8-2 and 8-3 give the standard operating curves for a 
thermal-magnetic circuit-breaker and an electronic circuit-breaker.

Breaking capacity (

) 
The breaking capacity is the highest short-circuit current (prospective current) 
that a circuit-breaker can interrupt under a given voltage. It is generally expressed in 
symmetrical r.m.s. kA and is designated by Icu  (ultimate breaking capacity) for 
industrial circuit-breakers, and Icn  (rated breaking capacity) for circuit-breakers for 
domestic or similar use. 

Overcurrent Switching Devices     321 
 
The conditions for determining the breaking capacity are stipulated by standards 
and they include the following: 
Operating sequence 
The circuit-breaker carries out a succession of switching manoeuvres: opening 
then closing/opening upon occurrence of a short-circuit (O-CO cycle). 
Current/voltage phase displacement 
When the voltage and current are in phase (cosϕ = 1), the short-circuit current 
is easier to interrupt. 
 
It is much more difficult when the cosϕ  is small. The standards define the 
cosϕ  to be used to determine the breaking capacity of a device. The higher the 
breaking capacity, the smaller the cosϕ , since the matching circuit-breakers are 
installed near the transformers and busbars, the impedance of which is essentially 
inductive. 
 
Table 8-2 gives the conditions for determining the breaking capacity of 
industrial circuit-breakers in relation to cosϕ .

Post breaking test 
After the O-CO cycle, the circuit-breaker should be checked to make sure that it 
is still able to provide a smaller number of operations (dielectric withstand 
capability, operation of trip relays, disconnectability). 
Rated insulation voltage (Ui )

Short-time withstand current (Icw) category (A or B) 
For industrial circuit-breakers (IEC 60947-2), there are two device categories: 
– those belonging to category A for which there is no tripping delay upon 
occurrence of a short-circuit (see Figure 8-4); 
– those belonging to category B for which, in order to ensure time-graded 
selectivity, it is possible to delay tripping upon occurrence of short-circuit currents 
that are lower than the short-time withstand current Icw (see Figure 8-5). Icw is the 
maximum current that a category B type circuit-breaker can thermally and 
electrodynamically withstand for a time specified by the manufacturer.

Making capacity (Icm) 
This is the highest current that the circuit-breaker can make under the rated 
voltage in specified conditions. In an alternating current, it is expressed by the peak 
value of the current (see section 4.1). The making capacity is equal to K times the 
breaking capacity, K being given in Table 8-3.

Rated service short-circuit breaking capacity (Ics) 
The breaking capacity (Icu  or Icn ) represents the maximum short-circuit current 
that the circuit-breaker may have to interrupt. The probability of such a fault 
occurring is extremely low and, during use, a circuit-breaker generally only has to 
interrupt much lower currents. 
 
However, it is important that these currents, which are much more likely to 
occur, are interrupted in extremely good conditions so as to guarantee that the 
installation is put back into service quickly and in complete safety once the cause of 
the fault has been cleared. 
 
This is why standards have defined a new specification, Ics, which is generally 
expressed as a percentage (25, 50, 75 or 100%) of Icu  for industrial circuit-breakers. 
 
Service breaking performance is checked as follows: 
– O - CO - CO (at Ics) test sequence; 
– post-breaking tests to check that the circuit-breaker is able to operate normally.

Fault-current limitation 
The fault-current limiting capacity of a circuit-breaker is its ability to only allow 
a current lower than the prospective fault current to flow upon occurrence of a 
short-circuit (see Figure 8-6). 
This specification is given by limitation curves that show: 
– the limited peak current in relation to the r.m.s. value of the prospective short-
circuit current; 

324     Protection of Electrical Networks 
– the limited thermal effect in relation to the r.m.s. value of the prospective 
short-circuit current. 
 
Manufacturers supply the limitation specifications for all circuit-breakers in the 
form of curves in relation to the r.m.s. value of the prospective short-circuit current. 
Figure 8-7 gives an example of the limitation curve of a circuit-breaker. 
 
LV circuit-breakers for domestic and similar use are classified in certain 
standards (notably European standard EN 60 898). If the limitation class is 
provided, the manufacturer does not supply the characteristic performance curves.

Advantages of current limitation 
The use of current-limiting circuit-breakers provides numerous advantages: 
– better network protection: limiting circuit-breakers greatly reduce all the 
harmful effects of short-circuit currents in an installation; 
– reduction of thermal effects: a smaller heat rise in the conductors leading to 
increased cable life; 
– reduction of mechanical effects: electrodynamic forces of repulsion (see 
section 5.2) are reduced, so there is less risk of elements being deformed or 
ruptured, especially the electrical contacts; 
– reduction of electromagnetic effects: less influence on measuring instruments 
located near an electrical circuit. 
 
These circuit-breakers contribute to improving the protection of: 
– cables; 
– prefabricated trunking; 
– electrical switchgear. 
 
 
This means that they slow down installation aging. 
Example 
For a prospective short-circuit current of 150 kA r.m.s., a circuit-breaker limits 
the peak current to less than 10% of the value calculated and the thermal effects 
(proportional to the square of the current; see section 5.1) to less than 1% of the 
calculated effects. 
8.2. MV circuit-breakers (according to standard IEC 62271-100) 
The rated short-circuit breaking capacity 
This is the highest short-circuit current that the circuit-breaker is able to 
interrupt. 
 
The rated short-circuit breaking capacity is characterized by two values (see 
IEC 62271-100, section 4.101): 
– the r.m.s. value of its AC component (see section 4.1), termed “rated short-
circuit breaking capacity” for short; 
– the DC component percentage (see section 4.1). 
 
The percentage of DC component is the ratio between the DC component and 
the AC component during the minimum opening time of the circuit-breaker, 

326     Protection of Electrical Networks 
increased by a half period, i.e. 10 ms at 50 Hz (see Figure 8-8). The half period 
corresponds to the minimum activation time of an overcurrent protection.

– the AC component is lower than or equal to the rated value; 
– the percentage of the DC component is lower than or equal to the specified 
value. 
 
IEC 62271-100 indicates the normal values of the percentage of the DC 
component in relation to a time interval τ from the moment the short-circuit occurs 
(see Figure 8-9).

time interval τ (ms) from the moment the short-circuit occurs 
Figure 8-9: percentage of the DC component in relation to the time interval τ  
from the moment the short-circuit occurs 
For a minimum circuit-breaker opening time of 40 ms to 60 ms increased by 
10 ms, i.e. a time τ of 50 to 70 ms, the percentage of DC component is 33% to 21%. 
 
A circuit-breaker with a minimum opening time of 40 ms must therefore be able 
to interrupt a DC component percentage of 33%. 
 
A circuit-breaker with a minimum opening time of 60 ms must therefore be able 
to interrupt a DC component percentage of 21%. 
 
 
Note: for a time interval τ greater than or equal to 80 ms, IEC 62271-100 does 
not stipulate the use of breaking tests including a DC component. Circuit-breakers 
with a minimum opening time greater than or equal to 70 ms (at 50 Hz) do not have 
a DC component specification. 
 
The percentage curve of the DC component defined by IEC 62271-100 
corresponds to a time constant of 45 ms, i.e. to the following equation: e
−τ
45  where 
τ is in ms. 
 
Indeed, for τ = 45 ms, the percentage value of the DC component measured on 
the curve is 37%, i.e. 1

This means that the normal percentage value of the DC component defined by 
IEC 62271-100 is suitable for a short-circuit current fed by the utility (far away 
from the generators), as the ratio R
X
 is normally higher than 0.071, thus giving a 
DC component percentage lower than the values defined by the standard. 
 
However, for circuit-breakers located near high power generators, the DC time 
constant is much greater than 45 ms. 
 
The DC component percentage at the moment the circuit-breaker opens 
(+ 1
2  period) is thus greater than the value defined in Figure 8-9. IEC 62271-100 
stipulates that, for these special applications, the percentage of DC component 
required is in theory specified in the tender document and tests are subject to 
agreement between the manufacturer and user. 
 
 
Note: the ratio R
X
 of the power supplied by the utility may be lower than 0.071 
for a short-circuit occurring near an HV/MV transformer. For example, for a 
Jeumont Schneider 90 kV/21 kV transformer of 36 MVA with a 17% short-circuit 
voltage, the ratio is as follows:
031
.0
=
X
R
. For a short-circuit occurring near this 
transformer, the ratio R
X
 is approximately 0.03. The DC component percentage is 
thus greater than the normal value defined by IEC 62271-100. According to section 
4.1.1, for 
50 ms
τ =
, the calculation gives 61% of DC component. In this case, it is 
necessary to check the circuit-breaker breaking capacity with the manufacturer. If 
the breaking capacity is too low, interruption of the short-circuit current can be 
time-delayed by the protection. In which case, interruption takes place when the DC 
component has been sufficiently reduced. In the example above, using a time delay 
of 100 ms,

for a minimum opening time of 40 ms). 

Overcurrent Switching Devices     329 
 
Rated short-circuit making capacity 
The circuit-breaker must be able to be closed upon occurrence of a short-circuit. 
The electrodynamic effect that it undergoes (see section 5.2) depends on the peak 
value of the short-circuit current. This peak value is defined by a coefficient K (see 
section 4.1.1), such that the peak value of the short-circuit current is equal to K 
times the r.m.s. value of the short-circuit current in steady-state operating 
conditions. 
 
IEC 62271-100, section 4.103, stipulates that the rated short-circuit making 
capacity must be 2.5 times the r.m.s. value of the AC component of its rated short-
circuit breaking capacity. 
 
This means that the circuit-breaker can be closed upon occurrence of a short-
circuit with a coefficient of K ≤ 2.5, having a value equal to its rated short-circuit 
breaking capacity.

Note 3: for circuit-breakers located near high power generators, the peak value

than the peak value of the short-circuit current. 
Rated allowable short-time withstand current 
IEC 62271-100, section 4.5, stipulates that the rated allowable short-time 
withstand current must be equal to the rated short-circuit breaking capacity. 
Rated short-circuit time 
This is the time interval during which the circuit-breaker, in closed position, can 
withstand a current equal to the rated allowable short-time withstand current. 
 
The normal value of the rated short-circuit time is 1 second (see IEC 60694, 
section 4.7). This time interval corresponds to the short-circuit time that the circuit-
breaker must be able to withstand for reasons of selectivity. 
 
This is the case, for example, when independent time phase overcurrent 
protection (see section 7.1) is time delayed by 1 second. 
 
When, for reasons of selectivity, the user requires a time delay T above 1 second, 
the allowable short-time current that the circuit-breaker can withstand can be 
determined by:

8.3. Low voltage fuses 
These are available with or without mechanical blown-fuse indicator lamps. 
 
Fuses are basically protective switchgear designed to trip all or part of a circuit 
by the blowing of one or more fuses when the current rises above a given value for a 
specified time. 
 
Standards define two types of fuses according to their application: 
– fuse for domestic use, which takes gG type cartridges (IEC 60269-3); 
– fuse for industrial use, which takes gG or gM type cartridges (IEC 60269-1  
and 2). 
 
 
Domestic and industrial fuses can be differentiated essentially by their operating 
voltages, size and breaking capacities. 
8.3.1. Fusing zones – conventional currents 
The fusing conditions of a fuse are defined by standards according to the fuse 
class. 
Class gG fuses 
These fuses ensure protection against overloads and short-circuits. 

332     Protection of Electrical Networks 
The conventional fusing and non-fusing currents are standardized (see Figure  
8-10 and Table 8-4): 
– The conventional non-fusing current Inf  is the current value that a fuse 
element can withstand for a specified time without melting. Example: a 32 A fuse 
through which a 1.3 In  current (i.e. 41.6 A) flows must not melt within the first 
hour. 
– The conventional fusing current I2 is the current value that causes the fuse to 
blow before the specified time is up. Example: a 32 A fuse through which a 1.6 In  
current (i.e. 52.1 A) flows must melt within the first hour. 
 
 
These two specifications explain why: 
– the fuses are not suitable for protection against low overloads (high 
conventional fusing current); 
– a cable cross-section able to carry a current that is higher than the operating 
current must be used in order to avoid damage to the cable upon occurrence of an 
overload current of long duration whose value is lower than the fuse specifications. 
 
 
By way of comparison, a circuit-breaker: 
– through which a 1.05 In  current flows must not be tripped within the first 
hour; 
– through which a 1.25 In  current flows must be tripped in less than an hour.

Class gM fuses (motor associated fuses) 
These fuses only ensure protection against short-circuits and are used especially 
in association with other devices (discontactor, circuit-breakers) to provide 
protection against any overload above 4 In . They are therefore not autonomous. 
Because gM fuses are not designed to protect against low overloads, the 
conventional fusing or non-fusing currents are not fixed. They are activated from 
approximately 4 In  (see Figure 8-11).

8.3.2. Breaking capacity 
Fuses are characterized by their excellent breaking capacity, which is extremely 
useful when considerable short-circuits occur. This is due to the fusing speed that 
enables the fault current to be cleared before it reaches its maximum value. 
 
This is what is referred to as limitation and it has the advantage of reducing 
thermal and mechanical effects caused by a short-circuit (see Figure 8-12).

8.4. MV fuses 
MV fuses are defined by standard IEC 60282-1. They are commonly used to 
protect transformers, motors and other loads. 
 
They have a number of advantages such as: 
– low cost; 
– limitation of the short-circuit current. 

Overcurrent Switching Devices     335 
 
This last feature means that the thermal and electrodynamic effects of short-
circuit currents are limited (see section 5.1 and 5.2), which is an advantage in 
relation to MV circuit-breakers. 
Definition 
 
The pre-arc: this is the fusing time of the fuse before the electrical arc occurs. 
 
Un : rated voltage: this is the highest phase-to-phase voltage (expressed in kV) 
in the network on which the fuse can be installed. In the MV range, preferential 
rated voltages have been fixed: 3.6 - 7.2 - 12 - 17.5 - 24 - 36 (kV). 
 
In : rated current (see Figure 8-13): this is the value of the current that the fuse 
can permanently withstand without overheating (usually 65°C for the contacts). 
 
I3: minimum breaking current (see Figure 8-13): this is the minimum current 
value that causes the fuse to fuse and break the current. The I3 values are usually 
between 2 and 6 In . 
 
 
Note: the melting of an MV fuse is not enough to cause interruption of the 
current flow. For current values below I3, the fuse melts but does not break the 
current. The arc remains until the current is interrupted by an external operation. It 
is thus essential to avoid a current of between In  and I3 flowing through the fuse. 
 
2I : current giving conditions close to the maximum arc energy (see Figure  
8-13): the value of 
2I  depends on the design of the fuse elements and is situated 
between 20 and 100 In . It ensures that breaking for the entire current zone between 
I3 and 1I  is guaranteed. 
 
I1: current giving a maximum breaking capacity (see Figure 8-13): this is the 
maximum prospective short-circuit current that the fuse can interrupt. It is the 
maximum testing value of the fuse: between 20 kA and 50 kA. 
 
 
Note: It is therefore necessary to ensure that the network short-circuit current is 
at the most equal to the current I1 of the fuse used.

Figure 8-13: definition of the operating zones of an MV fuse 
Breaking phenomenon (see Figure 8-14): when a short-circuit current occurs, 
the fuse element melts in a matter of milliseconds. An arcing voltage immediately 
occurs that is opposed to and higher than the supply voltage and therefore tends to 
reduce the current value. The fuse behaves like a variable resistance which, from 
being almost zero before fusion, increases to an infinite value when the current 
reaches zero causing the simultaneous modification of the current value and a phase 
displacement between this current and the supply voltage. 
 
 
Two values are derived from this process: 
– the maximum arcing voltage (Up); 
– the current Ip.  

Overcurrent Switching Devices     337 
 
 
The maximum arcing voltage, Up, or cut-off voltage, must be reduced in order 
to limit overvoltages on the network. The current Ip, which is the instantaneous 
short-circuit current actually flowing through the fuse, is called the cut-off current. 
It is lower than 1I . The parameters Up and Ip are associated since a low Ip can be 
easily obtained with a high Up. 
 
 
The co-existence of a low Ip (limiting the thermal and electrodynamic effects 
downstream of the fuse) and a low Up (limiting the overvoltages on the network 
during breaking) are proof that the design of MV fuses has been mastered.

Time/current characteristics of MV fuses: a time/current curve is associated with 
each fuse. This curve gives the fusing or pre-arcing time in relation to the r.m.s. 
current (see Figure 8-15). 
It is drawn on a logarithmic scale and can therefore be used to determine the pre-
arcing time for each current value. 
 
To obtain total operation, the arcing time must be added (5 to 50 ms). 
 
The part of the curve drawn as a dotted line represents the pre-arcing or fusing 
time for currents lower than I3. 
 
This curve, which extends until it reaches a pre-arcing period of 600 seconds, is 
given with a ± 10% tolerance.

Different Selectivity Systems 
Protective devices form a coherent whole in relation to the network structure and 
its earthing system. They should be looked upon as a system based on the principle 
of selectivity that consists of isolating the part of the network affected by the fault, 
and only that part, as quickly as possible, while all the other unaffected parts of the 
network remain energized. 
 
There are various ways of ensuring proper selectivity in electrical network 
protection: 
– amperemetric selectivity (using current); 
– time-graded selectivity (using time); 
– selectivity via information exchange, referred to as logic selectivity; 
– selectivity via use of directional or differential protection. 
9.1. Amperemetric selectivity 
This is based on the fact that, within a network, the further the fault is from the 
source, the weaker the fault current. 
 
Amperemetric protection is installed at the starting point of each section. Its 
threshold is set at a value lower than the minimum short-circuit current caused by a 
fault occurring on the monitored section, and higher than the maximum value of the 
current caused by a fault located downstream (beyond the monitored area). 
 

342     Protection of Electrical Networks 
Once set, each protection is only activated for faults located immediately 
downstream of its position (inside the monitored zone), and is insensitive to faults 
occurring beyond this point. 
 
Nevertheless, in practice, it is difficult to define the settings of two cascading 
protection devices (while continuing to ensure proper selectivity), when the current 
does not notably decrease between two neighboring zones. 
 
However, for line sections separated by a transformer, this system can be used 
advantageously as it is simple, economical and quick (tripping with no time delay). 
 
The most interesting application example is the case where two line sections are 
separated by a transformer: see Figure 9-1.

     Different Selectivity Systems     343 
 
 
Due to the high impedance value of the transformer, the short-circuit current at B 
recalculated for the upstream voltage level (see section 4.2.1.1) is generally much 
lower than the short-circuit current at A. 
 
 
This means that it is easy to meet the above condition.

Note: transformer protection is dealt with in section 10.3.4. Independent time 
double-threshold protection is used allowing tripping to be activated in the event of 
a fault occurring at the terminals downstream of the transformer or on the LV 
circuit-breaker. It is also activated in the event of the LV circuit-breaker failing. 

     Different Selectivity Systems     345 
 
9.2. Time-graded selectivity 
This consists of setting different time delays for the overcurrent protection 
devices distributed throughout the network. 
 
The closer the protection is to the source, the longer the time delay (see Figure 9-3a).

Figure 9-3a: time-graded selectivity 
Thus, in Figure 9-3a, the fault shown is detected by all the protection devices (at 
A, B, C and D). The time-delayed protection at D closes its contacts more quickly 
than the one installed at C, which in turn reacts more quickly than the one located at 
B. 
 
Once circuit-breaker D has been tripped and the fault current has been cleared, 
protection devices A, B and C, through which the current no longer passes, return to 
stand-by position. 

346     Protection of Electrical Networks 
The protection devices are activated when the current rises above the pre-defined 
setting. 
 
The threshold settings must therefore be coherent. 
 
The difference in operating times ∆t  between two successive protection devices 
is the selectivity interval. It takes into account: 
– circuit-breaker breaking time tc;  
– time delay tolerances δt; 
– upstream protection memory time tm; 
– a safety margin. 
 
 
∆t  must therefore satisfy the relation:

(see Figure 9-3b) 
 
Taking into account the present performances of switchgear and protection 
devices, ∆t  is assigned a value of 0.3 seconds (after detailed examination it is 
sometimes possible to take 0.25 seconds). 
 
For example, for the independent time phase overcurrent protection devices of

This selectivity system has two advantages: 
– it provides its own back-up. Indeed, the protection at C will be activated if the 
protection at D fails (a healthy part of the installation is cut off); 
– it is simple. 
 
However, when there are a large number of cascading relays, the fault clearing 
time is prohibitive and incompatible with the short-circuit current withstand of 
equipment, or with outside operating requirements, owing to the fact that the 
protection furthest upstream has the longest time delay (see section 10.1.3). 
 
Thus, the highest fault current is cleared after the longest time delay. 
 
Both types of overcurrent protection (independent and inverse time) can be used. 
Time-graded selectivity with independent time overcurrent protection 
 
The protection time delay is constant and independent of the current (see 
section 7.1).

9.3. Logic selectivity 
As we have just seen, amperemetric and time-graded selectivities have their 
weaknesses. 
 
The logic selectivity system has been designed to eliminate these drawbacks. 
With this system, perfect selectivity can be obtained when tripping occurs and, 
furthermore, the tripping time delay of the circuit-breakers located closest to the 
source is reduced considerably. 
 
When a fault occurs in a radial network, the fault current flows through the 
circuit located between the source and the fault point: 
– a current flows through the protection devices upstream of the fault; 
– a current does not flow through the protection devices downstream of the fault; 
– only the first protection directly upstream of the fault must be activated. 
 
A protective device able to send and receive a logic standby order is associated 
with each circuit-breaker. When a fault current flows through the protection, the latter: 
– sends a logic standby order to the protection directly upstream; 
– causes tripping of the associated circuit-breaker if it has not received a logic 
standby order from another protection.

can be as short as logic standby order transmission and reception time allows, i.e. 
0.1 to 0.2 seconds depending on the equipment. 
 
With the logic selectivity system, the fault clearance time can be reduced and is 
independent of the number of stages. It is possible to obtain selectivity between an 
upstream protection with a short time delay and a downstream protection with a 
long time delay, e.g. by setting a shorter time delay at the source than near the loads.

Note: to ensure safety, the logic standby time is limited, thus allowing an 
upstream protection to operate as back-up of a faulty downstream protection.

The logic link wire costs little since it connects the circuit-breakers or relays to 
the same switchboard. 
 
Between the switchboards, time-graded selectivity is set up, thus avoiding the 
necessity of installing long logic link wires. 
 
The logic standby time is limited to 200 ms after the time delay of the protection 
giving the standby order. This allows the protection upstream to operate as back-up 
for a faulty downstream protection. 
Fault at c 
The protection devices at F, D and B send a logic standby order to protection 
devices E, C and A, which may be time delayed to 0.1 second, respectively. 
 
The circuit-breaker F is tripped after its time delay of 0.1 second. 
 
The non-tripping of circuit-breakers D and B is ensured by time-graded

The 0.4 second time-delayed protection at D is also activated (there is no selectivity 
between E and D in the event of F failing, unless D’s time delay is increased).

The protection devices at D and B send a logic standby order to the protection 
devices at C and A respectively. 
 
The circuit-breaker E is tripped after its time delay of 0.1 second. 
Fault at e 
The protection devices at D and B send a logic standby order to the protection 
devices at C and A respectively. 
 
The circuit-breaker at D is tripped after its time delay of 0.4 seconds.

protection at C is activated after the logic standby time, i.e. 0.4

Therefore, using mixed selectivity the time delays can be reduced (roughly by a 
ratio of 2) without going to great expense, since logic link wires need only be 
installed between circuit-breakers or relays in the same switchboard.

9.4. Directional selectivity 
In a meshed network, in which a fault is fed by both ends, protection that is 
sensitive to the direction of the fault current flow must be used in order to be able to 
locate and clear the fault. To do this, directional overcurrent protection devices are 
used (see sections 7.3 and 7.4). 
 
We will give an example of directional selectivity for the phase-to-phase faults 
in a network with two incoming feeders (see Figure 9-8).

Circuit-breakers CB1 and CB2 are fitted with directional overcurrent protection 
devices, whereas CB3 and CB4 are fitted with phase overcurrent protection devices. 
 
 
For a fault at A:

 are established simultaneously; 
– the directional protection at CB2 is not activated because a current circulating 
in the opposite direction to its protection detection flows through it; 
– the directional protection at CB1 is activated because a current circulating in 
the same direction as its protection detection flows through it. This causes the 
circuit-breaker CB1 to be tripped and the current Isc2  is interrupted. An inter-
tripping system causes CB3 to open and the current Isc1 is interrupted; 
– the protection at CB4 is no longer activated. 
 
The selectivity between the directional protection at CB1 and the protection at 
CB4 is time-graded. 
 
Similarly, the selectivity between the directional protection at CB2 and the 
protection at CB3 is time-graded. 
 
For further details about the protection of a network with two parallel incoming 
feeders, see section 10.1.5. 
9.5. Selectivity by differential protection 
This type of protection compares the currents at the ends of the monitored 
network section (see Figure 9-9). Any difference between these currents indicates 
the presence of a fault. The protection reacts only to faults inside the monitored zone 
and is insensitive to any external fault. It is thus self-selective.

The equipment protected may be: 
– a motor;  
– a generator;  
– a busbar; 
– a cable or line;  
– a transformer.  
 
This type of protection has the following characteristics: 
– it can detect fault currents lower than the nominal current; 
– the time delay may be short, if not zero, since the selectivity is based on the 
detection and not on the time delay. 
 
A detailed explanation of differential protection operation is given in section 7.6. 
9.6. Selectivity between fuses and circuit-breakers 
There are two different selectivity problems, depending on whether the fuse is 
located upstream or downstream of the circuit-breaker. 
Fuse downstream of a circuit-breaker 
Let us consider an MV fuse and an MV circuit-breaker fitted with an overcurrent 
protection. The operating curves must meet the conditions shown in Figure 9-10 for 
an independent time protection or those in Figure 9-11 for an inverse time 
protection.

Fuse upstream of a circuit-breaker 
This is the case for a transformer between the upstream protection switch-fuse 
and the circuit-breakers of the LV switchboard located immediately downstream. 
 
Standard IEC 62271-105 concerning switch-fuse combinations stipulates that the 
three-phase short-circuit current at the secondary terminals of the transformer must 
cause the fuses to blow in a time less than the switch opening time caused by the 
fuses (40 ms – 10% = 36 ms for the SM6, see section 10.3.4.3.1).

As a result, for low voltage short circuits occurring near the transformer, the 
fusing time is less than roughly 36 ms. It is thus not possible to obtain selectivity 
between circuit-breakers of main switchgear downstream of the transformer and the 
upstream fuse. 
 
If LV circuit-breakers are delayed, only those located far enough from the 
transformer can be selective with the fuse. Indeed, the short-circuit current is then 
low enough so that fusing time is higher than time delay. In order that selectivity is 
total and without any risk of fuse damaging, fusing time must be higher than three 
times the circuit-breaker time delay for the maximal short-circuit at the terminals 
(see Figure 9-12). 
 
The non-selectivity of fuse with LV circuit-breakers near the transformer is an 
important disadvantage compared to the solution with MV circuit-breaker protection 
(see section 10.3.4.3.2).

We will first of all determine the requirements of the network and equipment for 
earth faults relevant to the earthing system, and then we will examine the 
requirements for phase-to-phase faults. 
10.1.1. Earth fault requirements for networks earthed via a limiting resistance 
(directly or by using an artificial neutral) 
Transient overvoltages occurring during phase-to-earth fault clearance by a circuit-
breaker 
Phase-to-earth fault clearance or successive arcing causes overvoltages to occur 
on the network that may lead to breakdown in equipment insulators. 
 
Experience has shown that when the condition

is met, the transient overvoltage does not exceed 240% of the peak value of the 
nominal single-phase voltage. It is difficult to obtain a transient overvoltage below 
240% even if the limiting current is increased. 
 
Efforts should always be made to meet the above condition. 
 
Furthermore, this condition facilitates detection and location of an earth fault.

Limiting earth fault currents in rotating machines 
So that rotating machines are not damaged when an earth fault occurs, the 
resistance limited current IA should satisfy the following condition:

Detection of internal phase-frame faults of three-phase machines 
When an insulation fault occurs between the winding of a machine (transformer, 
generator or motor) and the frame, the fault current value depends on the fault 
position in relation to the neutral point and the winding connection. 
Star-connected windings (see Figure 10-1) 
Before a fault occurs, the voltage between any point in a winding and the earth is 
equal to xV , where x is between 0 and 1, characterizing the position of the fault in 
the winding, and V  is a single-phase voltage. 
 
When a fault occurs at a distance x from the neutral point, the fault current 
value is:

The impedances of the machine and links are negligible in relation to the 
earthing impedance. 
 
Thus:

The current is therefore zero when the fault occurs at the neutral point (x = 0) 
and at its maximum value when the fault occurs at the machine terminals (x = 1).

Figure 10-2: fault current in relation to the position of the fault on the winding 
for a delta-connected machine 
When an insulation fault occurs inside a machine, the fault current may be much 
lower than the limiting current IA  obtained for a phase-to-earth solid fault in the 
network; it is close to zero for a fault occurring near the neutral point of a star-
connected machine. It is very difficult to detect this type of fault and it is therefore 
not possible to protect all the windings of a star-connected machine using earth fault 
protection. 
 
For example, setting the earth fault protection at 0.1 IA  provides 90% protection 
for the windings for a star-connected machine and 100% protection for the windings 
for a delta-connected machine.

When the capacitive currents are high and the network requirements do not 
allow this condition to be met, directional earth fault protection devices are used 
(see section 7.4.2) because they allow a fault current to be distinguished from the 
capacitive current of a healthy feeder. 
Selectivity with downstream protection 
The outgoing feeder protection must be compatible with the downstream 
protection devices. If the time delay required is too long, logic selectivity must be 
used (see section 9.3). 
Selectivity with the utility power supply 
The maximum time delay at the consumer substation may be stipulated by the 
utility. For example, in France, EDF (the French electricity authority), stipulates a 
time delay less than or equal to 0.2 seconds, which means that time-graded 
selectivity using a circuit-breaker located downstream cannot be used. Logic or 
differential selectivity must be used when the network is made up of several stages. 
Protection tripping 
To ensure earth fault protection tripping, the protection current threshold must 
be lower than the current limited by the earthing resistor.

To ensure a safety margin, the following condition must be met:

Dimensioning the earthing resistor 
The earthing resistor must withstand: 
– the permanent current I p that flows through it. This current may be caused by

unbalance in the capacitances of the network’s three phases. A permanent current

– the limiting current for the maximum fault clearance time. The resistor is 
usually required to withstand the current IA for 2 to 5 seconds so that eventual 
reclosings may take place upon occurrence of a fault. 
Earthing resistor protection 
The protection located on the neutral earthing connection (see Figure 10-5a) 
ensures protection against network faults and also provides earthing resistor 
protection. If the current threshold of this protection is higher than the permanent 
current I p that the resistor can withstand, a fault current that is between these two 
values may damage the resistor. In this case, it is necessary to add a second 
protection threshold, which must be lower than I p  and be time-delayed by several 
seconds. 
Minimum threshold setting of earth protection 
There is a risk of spurious tripping of the protection due to measurement error of 
the residual current, specifically in the presence of transient currents. 
 
In order to prevent this risk, protection setting must be above: 
– approximately 12% of the nominal rating InCT  of the CTs when measurement 
is carried out using three current transformers (see Figure 7-7). The condition b

– 1A for a time delay of 0.1 second when measurement is carried out using a 
core balance (see Figure 7-6). If exceptional installation precautions are used, it is 
possible to have a setting threshold lower than 1A. 
Thermal withstand of cable shields 
The limiting current IA must be lower than the maximum overcurrent that the 
cable shields can withstand for the duration of the maximum fault clearance time. 

368     Protection of Electrical Networks 
 
For example, the short-time withstand current allowable in a SPIRELEC 20 kV 
240 mm2 cable shield is 2,400A for 1 second.

10.1.2. Earth fault requirement for unearthed networks 
Transient overvoltages occurring during phase-to-earth fault clearance by a 
circuit-breaker 
 
The risk of overvoltages occurring is high and it is therefore advisable to 
reinforce equipment insulation. 
Earth fault currents in rotating machines 
These are due to the network capacitive currents. 
 
They must not be too great, if possible, so that the rotating machines are not 
damaged, i.e. they must be less than 20–30A. 
 
When the network is being designed, capacitive currents can be limited by 
breaking up the network using several transformers. 
Selectivity with downstream protection 
The protection of outgoing feeders must be compatible with the downstream 
protection devices. If the time delay required is too high, logic selectivity must be 
used (see section 9.3).

healthy feeder to be distinguished from the capacitive current of a faulty feeder. 
Limiting the risk of ferro-resonance  
The voltage transformer secondaries must be loaded via an impedance 
(see Figures 2-13 and 2-14) to dampen ferro-resonant phenomena that may appear 
with a phase-to-earth overvoltage. The value of the resistance must be weak enough 
to be effective. However, it must not be too weak so that VT are not overloaded and 

370     Protection of Electrical Networks 
 
their accuracy is preserved. A resistance value of 68Ω is recommended for a 
secondary voltage of 
V

100
. 
Another solution consists of using voltage transformers with three windings, the 
tertiary being used particularly for the VT load. Ferro-resonance occurs when there 
is a voltage displacement, which is why the tertiary is open delta-connected and 
loaded via the impedance (see Figure 10-3). There is no current in the impedance 
during normal operating conditions. Nevertheless, with phase-to-earth overvoltage, 
a current circulates in the load impedance, thus dampening, ferro-resonant 
phenomena. Experience has shown that it is necessary to dissipate a power higher 
than 50 W in the resistor upon an earth fault. For a tertiary voltage of

configuration minimizing the short-circuit current value (see section 4.4.2). (For a 
network fed by generators disconnected from the utility power supply, refer to 
section 7.24 to calculate the minimum short-circuit current.) 
 
In order to ensure a safety margin, the condition to be met for the phase 
overcurrent protection threshold setting is:

For safety reasons, back-up of the downstream protection should also be 
provided. 
Maximum short-circuit 
– The switching devices must be able to interrupt the maximum short-circuit 
current (see section 4.1 and 4.2). 
– The equipment must withstand the maximum short-circuit current for a 
maximum time determined by the selectivity system. The maximum time must take 
into account any eventual failure of the protection located directly upstream  
(1 safety level). 
Selectivity 
– The maximum time delay at the consumer substation may be stipulated by the 
manufacturer. In France, EDF (the French electricity authority), stipulates a time 
delay less than or equal to 0.2 seconds, which means that time-graded selectivity via 
a circuit-breaker located downstream cannot be used. Logic or differential 
selectivity must be used when the network is made up of several stages. 
– The equipment thermal withstand to the short-circuit current (see section 5.1) 
defined by the manufacturers is generally 1 second. 
– The protection devices must not be activated by normal overloads caused by 
motor starting or transformer inrush currents.

Resistance earthing is established by creating an artificial neutral (see

The outgoing feeders, the incoming feeder and the artificial neutral are fitted

Using the coefficient 0.3 overcomes problems relating to variations in network

If we apply the same reasoning to protection devices D2, D3 and D4 we can see 
that, in order to obtain selectivity between all the outgoing feeders, the capacitance 
of an outgoing feeder must be lower than 
23
.0
3.1
3.0
=
 times the sum of the 
capacitances of the other feeders. 
 
It is difficult to meet this condition, which is why directional earth fault 
protection devices are used (see section 7.4.3 and 10.1.2), allowing the capacitive 
current of a healthy feeder to be distinguished from the capacitive current of a faulty 
feeder. 
 
It is thus possible to set the directional earth fault protection to the minimum 
measurement accuracy (see section 10.1.2). 
 
In order to detect a fault at d on the busbar or transformer, residual overvoltage 
protection is used (see section 7.16). 
Operation for first fault tripping with directional protection on the outgoing feeders 
The selectivity between the protection of the busbar and outgoing feeders Di  is 
of the time-graded type. 
 
The protection at D1 detects the fault at c on the outgoing feeder and causes 
the circuit-breaker D1 to be tripped with a time delay tD. 
 
The residual overvoltage protection located at A detects the fault at d and 
causes circuit-breakers H  and A to be tripped with a time delay tA. 

Protection of Network Elements     381 
 
The residual overvoltage protection acts as back-up in case of failure of the

Figure 10-11: unearthed neutral 
Selective detection of the faulty outgoing feeder is identical to the case of the 
unearthed neutral of a network with one incoming feeder: see section 10.1.4.2. 
Directional earth fault protection devices are used on the outgoing feeders (see 
sections 7.4.3 and 10.1.2). 
 
The fault at d is not detected by the earth fault protection devices located at A1 
and A2 because the capacitance of the link connecting the busbar to the transformer 
is generally negligible. 
 
The residual overvoltage protection devices (see section 7.16) detect the fault at 
d on the busbar and cause circuit-breakers A1, H1, A2 and H2 to be tripped with a 
time delay tH. 

Protection of Network Elements     389 
 
The earth fault protection at A1 detects the fault at e and causes circuit-
breakers A1 and H1 to be tripped with a time delay t A. 
 
The residual overvoltage protection on T2 detects the fault at e and non-
tripping is ensured by time-graded selectivity where the time delays are set such that

The residual overvoltage protection protects the transformer (fault at e) when 
the circuit-breaker A is open. Furthermore, it acts as back-up in case the protection 
of an incoming or an outgoing feeder fails. 
 
Especially when no outgoing feeder is in service, a fault at e causes a very low 
capacitive current, which is unlikely to be detected by the protection at A; the 
residual overvoltage protection acts as back-up.

Note: the residual overvoltage protection devices may be replaced by a 
permanent insulation monitor (see section 2.5.1). In this case, logic selectivity must 
be used so that the two PIMs are not able to operate in parallel because, if they do, 
they flow into one another and permanently detect a fault. The neutral of the voltage 
transformers must therefore be earthed through a capacitor and an overvoltage 
limiter in parallel.

Note: the short-circuit current is split between both branches in relation to the

the short-circuit current is very low at A1, whereas it is high at H1 (the short-circuit 
current is split in proportion to the impedances of the two current circulation paths). 
The short-circuit current at A1 may be lower than the current threshold and the 
protection is only activated once the circuit-breaker H1 has been tripped (the entire

Note: the short-circuit current is split between the two branches in relation to the 
branch impedance and the position of the fault. Thus, for a fault at e, close to H1, the 
short-circuit current is very small at A1, whereas it is large at H1 (the short-circuit 
current is split in proportion to the impedances of the two current circulation paths). 
The short-circuit current at A1 may be smaller than the current threshold and 
protection is only activated once the circuit-breaker H1 has been tripped (the entire 
short-circuit current then circulates via A1). The fault clearance time is tH + tR and the 
protection located at K must be time-delayed as a consequence, i.e. tK ≥ tH + tR + ∆t.

Figure 10-15: unearthed neutral  
Selective detection of the faulty outgoing feeder is identical to the case of the 
unearthed neutral of a network with one incoming feeder (see section 10.1.4.2). 
Directional earth fault protection devices are used on the outgoing feeders 
(see sections 7.4.3 and 10.1.2). 
 
The fault at d is not detected by the directional earth fault protection devices 
located at A1, A2, D1 … D4 because the capacitive currents detected by these 
protection devices are not in the detection direction provided for. 

398     Protection of Electrical Networks 
 
The residual overvoltage protection (see section 7.16) detects the fault at d on 
the busbar and causes circuit-breaker K  to be tripped with a time delay tK. 
 
For a fault at e, the capacitive currents from the outgoing feeders are reclosed 
via the two parallel links, with the current values in each link depending on the 
position of the fault. These capacitive currents are thus detected by the protection 
devices located at A1, A2, H1 and H2. To obtain selectivity between the two links, 
directional earth fault protection devices must be installed (see section 7.4.3) with a 
logic exchange between the two ends of a link. If both protection devices are 
activated, the currents flow in the same direction and the tripping orders are locked. 
 
For a fault at e, the protection devices located A2 at and H2 see a current 
flowing in the same direction and the tripping orders are locked. 
 
The protection devices located at A1 and H1 see a current flowing in the 
opposite direction and a tripping order is given to circuit-breakers A1 and H1. 
 
The residual overvoltage protection (see section 7.16) detects the fault at f and 
causes the circuit-breaker K to be tripped with a time delay tK. 
 
Selectivity between the incoming protection K and the outgoing feeders Di is of 
the time-graded type.

10.1.7. Loop network 
In a distribution network comprising substations fed in a loop arrangement, 
protection may be provided in the following ways. 
At the head of the loop only 
The loop heads are fitted with circuit-breakers. The substations are fitted with 
switches. The network must be used in an open loop arrangement. Faults cause 
power cuts. 
By sections 
Each link end is fitted with a circuit-breaker. During normal operation, the 
network is used in a closed loop arrangement. Most faults do not cause a power cut. 
10.1.7.1. Protection at the head of the loop (see Figure 10-16) 
The loop heads at A1 and B1 are fitted with circuit-breakers, and phase and earth 
fault protection devices. The substations are fitted with switches.

Fault detectors are installed on each switch. They indicate the passage of a fault 
current. 
 
During normal operation, the loop is open. In the figure, it is assumed that it is 
open at B6.  
Operation in the event of a fault 
– The protection at A1 detects the fault at c, and causes the circuit-breaker A1 
to be tripped. 
– The link is de-energized from A1 to B6, and substations 1, 2 and 3 are no 
longer fed. 

Protection of Network Elements     401 
 
– The fault detectors located at A2 and A3 indicate the passage of a fault current. 
The other detectors do not send a signal. The fault is located. The user opens 
switches A3 and A4 in order to put the faulty link out of service. 
– The closing of the switch B6 enables substations 2 and 3 to be fed again. 
– The closing of the circuit-breaker A1 enables substation 1 to be fed again. 
 
After the faulty link has been repaired, switches A3 and A4 are closed and 
switch B6 is kept open so that the loop can be opened and initial operating 
conditions restored. 
 
This loop protection system enables a fault to be located but causes power cuts. 
These cuts last up to several seconds if an automatic loop reconfiguration system is 
installed. They last for several minutes or tens of minutes if the loop is reconfigured 
manually by the operating personnel. 
 
This protection system is often used in MV urban networks. 
10.1.8. Protection by section 
Each link end is fitted with a circuit-breaker. During normal operation, the loop is 
closed. The protection systems will allow power cuts to be avoided when a fault occurs.

Figure 10-17: solution using overcurrent and directional overcurrent protection devices 

402     Protection of Electrical Networks 
 
This solution can only be implemented when a loop is limited to two substations. 
 
Time-graded selectivity leads to time delays that are prohibitive for most 
substations. If the loop is extended in the future, this will lead to a change in the 
protection system. 
 
Fault at c: 
– The directional overcurrent protection at B detects the fault and causes the 
circuit-breaker B to be tripped with a time delay t1. 
– The overcurrent protection at A detects the fault and causes the circuit-breaker 
A to be tripped with a time delay t5. 
 
Fault at d: 
– The directional overcurrent protection at C detects the fault and causes the 
circuit-breaker C to be tripped with a time delay t2. 
– The overcurrent protection at B detects the fault and causes the circuit-breaker 
B to be tripped with a time delay t4. 
 
Fault at e: 
– The overcurrent protection devices C and D detect the fault and cause the 
circuit-breakers C and D to be tripped with a time delay t3. 
 
A fault is detected at each protection stage and the time-graded selectivity 
therefore requires that:

The time delay t5 of the circuit-breaker A is thus only just acceptable for the 
thermal withstand of equipment to the short-circuit current. 
 
 
Note: at each substation, the minimum tripping time t2  must be selective with 
the protection devices downstream of the substation. 
 
Selectivity between the protection of the source S  and the protection devices of 
the loop must be of the logic type (see section 10.2.1), so that the time delay of the 
protection at S  is not too large. Another solution consists of installing busbar 
differential protection (see section 10.2.2). 
 
This method does not require a remote link, is simple and is not very costly. It 
does, however, necessitate long time delays and its application is limited to two 
substations.

If we look at the figure, we see that for a fault at d, selectivity between points 
A and B is not absolutely essential because there is no consumer on the link between 
A and B. 
 
Similarly, for a fault at d, selectivity between points C and D is not absolutely 
essential. 
 
This situation allows us to split the number of protection functions in two. 
Furthermore, time-graded selectivity requires shorter time delays. 
 
Fault at c: 
– The directional overcurrent protection at B detects the fault and causes the 
circuit-breaker B to be tripped with a time delay t1. 
– The overcurrent protection at A detects the fault and causes the circuit-breaker 
A to be tripped with a time delay t3. 
 
Fault at d: 
– The overcurrent protection devices at C and D detect the fault and cause 
circuit-breakers C and D to be tripped with a time dely t2. 
– The overcurrent protection at A detects the fault and causes the circuit-breaker 
A to be tripped with a time delay t3. 
 
Fault at e: 
– The overcurrent protection devices at C and D detect the fault and cause 
circuit-breakers C and D to be tripped with a time delay t2. 
 
A fault is detected at each protection stage and the time-graded selectivity 
therefore requires that:

The time delay t3 of the circuit-breaker A is thus quite acceptable for the thermal 
withstand of the equipment in relation to the short-circuit current. 
 
 
Note: at each substation, the minimum tripping time t2  must be selective with 
the downstream protection devices of the substation. 
 
Selectivity between the protection of the source S  and the protection devices of 
the loop must be of the time-graded type or, preferentially, the logic type (see 
section 10.2.1), so that the time delay of the protection at S  is not too great. 
Another solution consists of installing busbar differential protection (see 
section 10.2.2). 
 
This method does not require a remote link, is simple and is not very costly. The 
disadvantage is that the time delays are too long when applied to more than two 
substations. If the loop is extended in the future, this will lead to a change in the 
protection system.

Logic selectivity allows this solution to be implemented with a large number of 
substations, and avoiding prohibitive time delays. 
 
Each circuit-breaker in the loop (except A and H) is fitted with two directional 
overcurrent protection devices, which detect currents flowing in opposite directions. 
 
Two opposite direction logic standby loops 1l  and 2
l  are installed: 
Fault at c: 
– The overcurrent protection at A detects the fault and causes the circuit-breaker 
A to be tripped. 
– The directional overcurrent protection at B, which is directed towards the fault, 
is activated, a logic standby order is given to the protection devices at C, D, E, F, G 
and H (loop 2
l ), and the circuit-breaker B is tripped. 
Fault at d: 
– The directional overcurrent protection at B, which is directed towards the fault, 
is activated, a logic standby order is given to the protection at A (loop 1l ), and the 
circuit-breaker B is tripped. 
– The directional overcurrent protection at C, which is directed towards the fault, 
is activated, a logic standby order is given to the protection devices at D, E, F, G 
and H (loop 2
l ), and the circuit-breaker C is tripped.  
Fault at e: 
– The directional overcurrent protection at C, which is directed towards the fault, 
is activated, a logic standby order is given to the protection at B and A (loop 1l ), 
and the circuit-breaker C is tripped. 
– The directional overcurrent protection at D, which is directed towards the 
fault, is activated, a logic standby order is given to the protection devices E, F, G 
and H (loop 2
l ), and the circuit-breaker D is tripped.  
 
The directional protection devices directed towards the substations protect the 
busbars and must be selective with the downstream protection devices. 
 
The directional protection devices directed towards the cables may have 
identical time delays. 
 
The protection time delays must be longer than the logic standby order 
transmission and reception times, i.e. 0.1 to 0.2 seconds, depending on the equipment. 
 
Selectivity between the protection of the source S and the loop protection 
devices may be of the time-graded or logic type (see section 10.2.1). Another 
solution consists of installing busbar differential protection (see section 10.2.2).

Two power sources are shown in Figure 10-19b. The protection system is 
nevertheless the same for a greater number of sources. 
 
Each circuit-breaker in the loop is fitted with directional overcurrent protection 
devices which detect currents flowing in opposite directions. 
 
Two opposite direction logic standby loops are installed. 
 
Fault at c: 
– The protection devices at A and B, which are directed towards the fault, are 
activated, a logic standby order is given to all the other protection devices (loops l1 
and l2), and circuit-breakers A and B are tripped. 
 
Fault at d: 
– The protection devices at B and C, which are directed towards the fault, are 
activated, a logic standby order is given to all the other protection devices (loops l1 
and l2), and circuit-breakers B and C are tripped. 
– The protection at S2 detects the fault and causes circuit-breaker S2 to be 
tripped. 
 
Fault at e: 
– The protection devices at C and D, which are directed towards the fault, are 
activated, a logic standby order is given to all the other protection devices (loops l1 
and l2), and circuit-breakers C and D are tripped. 
 
The directional protection devices directed towards the substations protect the 
busbars and must be selective with the downstream protection devices. 
 
The directional protection devices directed towards the cables may have 
identical time delays. 
 
The protection time delays must be longer than the logic standby order 
transmission and reception time, i.e. 0.1 to 0.2 seconds, depending on the 
equipment. 
 
Selectivity between the protection devices of the sources (S1 and S2) and the 
loop protection devices may be of the time-graded or logic type (see section 10.2.1). 
Another solution consists of installing busbar differential protection (see 
section 10.2.2).

Distance protection solution 
Distance protection devices are only used on long high voltage links (from 
several kilometers to 1,000 kilometers long). They are selective and do not require 
pilot wire links. The fault detection principle is based on the measurement of 
impedances. 
 
These protection devices are very costly and are not used in industrial networks 
and rarely in public distribution medium voltage networks.

10.2. Busbar protection

Logic selectivity is established between the incoming feeder A and outgoing 
feeders 
1
D  and 
2
D . It is assumed that selectivity with the downstream protection 
devices requires a time delay of 0.7 seconds on the outgoing feeders. 
 
The duration of the logic standby is limited to 200 ms after the outgoing feeder 
protection time delay. This enables the incoming feeder protection to operate as 
back-up if a downstream protection fails. 
 
Back-up protection is positioned at A and is activated when the logic standby 
order does not function normally. Its time delay is set so as to obtain time-graded 
selectivity with the outgoing feeders (it is included in the Sepam logic system). 

Protection of Network Elements     413 
 
 
Fault at c: 
– The protection at D1 sends a logic standby order to the protection at A. 
– The circuit-breaker D1 is tripped after its time delay of 0.7 seconds. 
– If the protection at D1 or the circuit-breaker D1 fails, the protection at A  is 
activated after the logic standby time is up, i.e. after 0.7 + 0.2 = 0.9 seconds
 
 
. 
 
Fault at d: 
– The circuit-breaker A is tripped after its time delay of 0.1 second. 
– When the logic standby signal operates abnormally (spurious activation), the 
back-up protection is activated after its time delay of 1 second. 
– This protection system is simple and not very costly.

The differential protection compares the current entering via the source to the 
sum of currents leaving via the outgoing feeders. 
 
If the difference is zero, the busbar is healthy. If not, it is faulty. 
 
The protection is activated instantaneously. 
 
Time-delayed overcurrent protection is installed at A  and will be activated 
when the differential protection fails. 
 
It is assumed that selectivity with downstream protection devices requires a time 
delay of 0.7 seconds on the outgoing feeders. 
 
The back-up protection at A  is thus time-delayed by 1 second so that the time-
graded selectivity interval is respected. 
 
In order to make the protection system reliable, specific current transformers 
must be installed for the differential protection. 
 
This protection system is fast-acting (instantaneous), but is, however, more 
costly than the logic selectivity system. 
 
For further details on the operation of high impedance differential protection 
applied to busbars, refer to section 7.6.1.2.3. 
10.3. Transformer protection 
We shall first of all study the transient currents that occur during transformer 
switching and the value of the LV short-circuit current detected by the HV side for a 
delta-star transformer. We shall then study the protection of transformers. 
10.3.1. Transformer energizing inrush current 
When the transformer is energized, a transient overcurrent is created, which 
depends on the moment that the voltage is applied and the remanent induction of the 
magnetic circuit. 
 
The asymmetry and the current value are maximum when the transformer is 
energized, at the moment the voltage reaches zero, and when the remanent induction 
on the same phase is maximum. 
 

Protection of Network Elements     415 
 
The overcurrent is due to the saturation of the magnetic circuit, which causes a 
very high magnetizing current. 
 
It is shown that: B

Tables 10-3 and 10-4 give the maximum values of the inrush currents and the

If the transformer is energized on the LV side, the ratio must be multiplied by 2 
and the time constant divided by 1.5.

Table 10-5a: value of the HV side current during an LV side short-circuit 
for a delta-star transformer 
Table 10-5a can be used to determine the HV side minimum and maximum 
short-circuit currents for an LV side short-circuit. The values indicated are valid 
whatever the transformation ratio. 
 
It is necessary to know these values in order to determine the setting thresholds 
of a transformer’s HV protection: 
– in order to protect the transformer against a short-circuit occurring directly at 
its downstream terminals or when the HV protection must act as back-up to the LV 
protection. In this case, the minimum short-circuit current must be known; 
– when the protection must be selective (of the amperemetric type) with the LV 
protection. In this case, the maximum short-circuit current must be known. 
 
 
Note: when only the HV protection monitors two phases (phases 2 and 3 in our 
example), the minimum short-circuit current detected by the HV protection

10.3.3. Faults in transformers 
The main faults that may affect a transformer are: 
– overload; 
– phase short-circuit (internal or external); 
– earth fault. 
Overload 
Most of the time, this is due to an increase in the number of simultaneously fed 
loads or an increase in the power demand for one or more loads. 
 
This causes an overcurrent of long duration, which causes a rise in temperature 
that is prejudicial to the withstand of insulators and the longevity of the transformer. 
Phase short-circuit 
This may occur inside or outside a transformer: 
– Internal: this is a fault between conductors with different phases or more often 
between the turns of the same winding. In an oil-insulated transformer, the arc 
causes a decomposition gas to be emitted from the liquid dielectric. If the fault is 
weak, a small amount of gas is discharged that, when accumulated, becomes 
dangerous. A strong short-circuit causes considerable damage that may destroy the 
coils, and also the tank if the fire on oil spreads. This gas causes an overpressure, 
which may lead to the destruction of the tank and effusion of oil with a risk of fire. 
– External: this is a phase-to-phase fault in the downstream links. The short-
circuit current causes electrodynamic effects in the transformer that may 
mechanically affect the coils and transform the short-circuit into an internal type of 
fault. 
Earth fault 
The earth fault is an internal fault. It may occur between the coils and tank or 
between the coils and magnetic core. For an oil-insulated transformer, it causes a 
gaseous discharge. Like the internal short-circuit, it may cause the destruction of the 
tank and a fire. 
 
The amplitude of the fault current depends on the earthing system of the 
upstream and downstream networks. For the fault current not to be close to zero, the 
zero-sequence impedance detected by the fault point must not be infinite (see Table 
4-16). The amplitude of the fault current also depends on the setting of the fault in 
the coils (see section 10.1.1).

10.3.4. Transformer protection 
This includes any type of transformer (except specific transformers for welding 
machines, arc furnaces, etc.).  
10.3.4.1. Specific protection against overloads 
This is ensured in one of the following ways: 
– by monitoring the temperature of the dielectric for liquid-insulated 
transformers (see section 7.23); the alarm threshold is generally set at 80°C. The 
off-loading or switch-off threshold of the transformer is generally set at 90°C; 
– by monitoring the temperature of the windings for dry type transformers (see 
section 7.23), using a thermal probe that detects an abnormal rise in temperature; 
– by a long time-delayed trip relay on the circuit-breaker installed on the low 
voltage side; 
– by thermal overload protection (see section 7.7). 
 
We can note that fuses and overcurrent protection devices do not protect against 
overload. 
 
 
Note: when the load specifications being fed exclude the possibility of overload, 
protection against overloads is not necessary. 
10.3.4.2. Specific protection against internal phase short-circuits 
– for liquid-insulated transformers: using a gas and pressure detector (see DGPT 
section 7.25) which is sensitive to a discharge of gas caused by a short-circuit. This 
type of protection is recommended for transformers with a power above 630 kVA. 
– using transformer differential protection (see section 7.6.3). 
10.3.4.3. Specific protection against earth faults 
This can be ensured in one of the following ways: 
– by protection against tank earth leakage faults (see section 7.20); 
– by earth fault protection (see section 7.2) located on the upstream network for 
a frame-earth fault affecting the transformer primary; 
– by earth fault protection located on the neutral earthing connection of a 
transformer with a star-connected secondary, for a frame-earth fault affecting the 
transformer secondary; 
– by earth fault protection located on the incoming busbar (see section 2.3.1) fed 
by the transformer if neutral earthing is made with an artificial neutral (see Figure 
10-26); 
– by restricted earth fault differential protection (see section 7.6.1.2.4).

Figure 10-26: protection against transformer earth faults when earthing is 
 on the downstream busbar 
 
Note: if there is no earthing on the transformer, biased transformer differential 
protection (see section 7.6.3) may be used to detect earth faults. The biased 
protection must, however, be sufficiently sensitive. This is not always the case, 
especially when the earth fault current is limited by an impedance. 
10.3.4.4. Switch-fuse protection 
To determine the fuse rating, the selection tables in equipment operating guides 
are generally referred to (see, for example, Table 10-5c for the Schneider SM6). 
 
For cases which do not correspond to the standard selection tables, the rules and 
criteria indicated below must be respected when choosing the fuse rating. 
Rated fuse voltage 
The rated fuse voltage Unf  must be higher than or equal to the network 
operating voltage (Un ): 
U

Note: a fuse with a rated voltage that is too high will, if fused, cause excessive 
overvoltages on the network. 
Maximum breaking capacity of the fuse 
The maximum breaking capacity of the fuse I1 (see section 8.4) must be higher 
than the maximum short-circuit current of the upstream network Iscup : 
I

1 ≥
. 
Short-circuit current on the transformer secondary 
The short-circuit current of a symmetrical three-phase fault I sc3  on the 
secondary must be higher than the minimum breaking current of the fuse I3  (see 
section 8.4):

located under the fusing curve.

Co-ordination between the fuses and the breaking capacity of the switch for 
combined fuse-switch cubicles (in compliance with IEC 62271-105, section 8.2.4) 
The fuses of combined fuse-switch cubicles are fitted with strikers which, when 
one or more fuses are fused, cause the switch to open, thus preventing single-phase 
or phase-to-phase operation. 
 
Upon occurrence of a three-phase short-circuit, the fastest-acting fuse melts, thus 
breaking the first phase. A reduced current then flows through the two other phases 
(0.87 times the three-phase current: see section 4.2.3) which will be interrupted 
either by the switch (via the strikers) or by the two other fuses. 
 
IEC 62271-105 defines the transfer current IT , obtained when the switch is 
opened and the two fuses are fused simultaneously. 
 
For a current lower than the transfer current, the switch takes over from the 
fuses, which thus defines its minimum breaking capacity. 
 
From a practical point of view, the transfer current is determined by 
superimposing a time equal to 0.9 times the duration of switch opening caused by 
the fuses (via the strikers), on the minimum time/current characteristic (based on a 
current tolerance of –6.5%). 
 
 
The switch breaking capacity must be higher than or equal to the transfer current

Transient recovery voltage upon occurrence of a fault at the secondary terminals 
of the transformer (in accordance with IEC 62271-105, section 8.2.6) 
Upon occurrence of a solid short-circuit at the secondary terminals of the 
transformer, the fuse which breaks a pole first creates high transient recovery 
voltages on the other poles. The switch would not be able to break these poles with 
such transient voltages. 
 
The fuses must therefore be chosen so that they alone clear such a fault without 
causing the switch to operate. 
 

Protection of Network Elements     429

10.3.4.5. Circuit-breaker protection 
This type of protection is recommended when the basic transformer current rises 
above 125 A. 
 
The inrush currents due to transformer energizing must not cause the circuit-
breaker to be tripped. 
 
The circuit-breaker can be fitted with a single threshold or rather with a double 
threshold independent time phase overcurrent protection. 
Single threshold independent time protection 
The setting threshold Iset must be such that the minimum HV short-circuit current 
(see section 4.4.2) causes the circuit-breaker to be tripped, i.e. Iset ≤ 0.8 Isc, min. 
 
Experience has shown that the following setting requirements can be used to 
avoid spurious tripping: 
– Iset > 5 Ib: transformer basic current (or nominal current) 
– time delay = 0.2 seconds 
 
The condition 5 Ib < 0.8 Isc2, min is normally satisfied. If it is not, a more detailed 
study must be carried out in order to find the best compromise between totally 
selective protection and the risk of spurious tripping during energization, or 
installing double threshold protection. 
 
Single threshold protection does not protect the transformer against short-circuits 
coming directly from its downstream terminals. It cannot act as back-up to the LV 
protection. This is why it is advisable to install a double threshold protection which 
overcomes this drawback. 
Double threshold independent time protection

Figure 10-27d: double threshold independent time protection 
The MV circuit-breaker is equipped with a double threshold independent time 
protection. Selectivity between MV circuit-breaker and main LV circuit-breaker is 
not useful. On the other hand, it is extremely worthwhile to obtain selectivity 
between MV circuit-breakers and secondary LV circuit-breakers. 
High threshold 
This protects against HV side short-circuits inside the transformer. 
 
Selectivity with the LV circuit-breaker is of the amperemetric type (see  
section 9.1). 
 
The high threshold Ihset HV
,
 must be set such that the HV minimum short-circuit 
current (see section 4.4.2) causes the circuit-breaker to be tripped. The protection 
must be checked to make sure that it is not activated during transformer energizing. 
The time delay must be zero in order to avoid any risk of explosion upon a very 
high current short-circuit. 
 
These conditions require the high threshold to comply with the following

Low threshold 
This protects against LV side short-circuits: 
– at the downstream terminals of the transformer or on the main LV circuit-
breaker; 
– as back-up to the main LV circuit-breaker. 
 
Selectivity with the secondary LV circuit-breakers is time-graded (see  
section 9.2).

10.4. Motor protection 
Motor protection is provided by the set of devices ensuring that deterioration due 
to abnormal supply, motor or load operating conditions is avoided. 
Main faults affecting an asynchronous motor 
– overload; 
– internal or external phase short-circuits; 
– phase cutting, inversion of two phases and phase unbalance; 
– stator frame fault; 
– excessive start-up time and locked rotor; 
– drop in supply voltage; 
 

440     Protection of Electrical Networks 
 
– closing of the switching device while motors still hold a considerable remanent 
voltage; 
– too many successive start-ups; 
– drop in current; 
– rotor frame fault (for slipring rotor motors). 
Main faults affecting a synchronous motor 
To the faults listed for asynchronous motors may be added: 
– loss of synchronism; 
– loss of excitation; 
– rotor frame fault; 
– prolonged asynchronous operation upon start-up; 
– overload and short-circuit in excitation windings; 
– generator operation. 
10.4.1. Protection of medium voltage motors 
Protection against overloads 
These are revealed by the occurrence of overcurrents which, if prolonged, cause 
excessive heating leading to accelerated ageing of the motor.  
 
Protection is ensured by the following methods: 
– either by a thermal overload protection (see section 7.7); 
– or by a temperature monitoring device (see section 7.23). 
Protection against internal or external phase short-circuits 
External faults may occur at the terminals or in the power cable between the 
switchboard and motor. Internal faults may occur between two turns of the same 
phase or different phases following the deterioration of the insulators. They produce 
considerable phase-to-phase overcurrents. 
 
Protection may be ensured by the following methods: 
– By independent time phase overcurrent protection devices for equipment with 
circuit-breaker. 
 
The current threshold must be set above the starting current, e.g. 
1.3
set

with a time delay of roughly 0.1 second. 

Protection of Network Elements     441 
 
– Using high impedance differential protection for internal short-circuits  
(see section 7.6.1.2.1). 
This type of protection is only used for motors above roughly 2 MW. 
 
– Using biased differential protection. 
This type of protection is only used for motors above roughly 2 MW. 
 
– By fuse for equipment with contactor + fuse. 
It must be remembered that fuses protect a motor against overcurrents above the 
starting current and do not therefore provide protection against overloads. 
 
The rating of fuses is determined in relation to the: 
– nominal current In ; 
– starting current Ist ; 
– start-up time Tst ; 
– maximum number of start-ups per hour; 
– maximum number of successive start-ups. 
Method for determining fuse rating

from numerous tests carried out:

The rating chosen is the value immediately to the right of this point. 
 
In Figure 10-33, the rating to be used is 250 A. 
 
This method of determination can be used to guarantee that the fuse does not 
deteriorate for a number of start-ups per hour less than or equal to 6 and a number of 
successive start-ups lower than or equal to 2.

In order to determine the fuse rating, the maximum value between Tvih  and

When the motor start up is not direct (electronic starter, auto-transformer, etc.) 
the starting current may be fairly low, e.g. 3 In  
Using this method a fuse rating lower than 13. In  can thus be determined. 
 
In this case, a fuse rating higher than or equal to 13. In  must be chosen. 
Protection against phase cutting, inversion of two phases and phase unbalance 
This is provided by a negative-phase sequence component protection (see 
section 7.8). The consequences of phase unbalances on motors is explained in this 
section. Protection against phase inversion of two phases may be carried out with a 
positive sequence undervoltage and phase rotation direction protection (see section 
7.14). 
Protection against stator frame faults 
This type of protection must be chosen in relation to the earthing system of the 
network feeding the motor. 
Motor fed by a network with direct or limiting impedance earthing 
Protection is established by an earth fault protection (see section 7.2). 
 
The current threshold may be set at 10% of the maximum earth fault current (i.e. 
10% of the limiting current for a limiting impedance earthing system). This 
threshold ensures protection of 90% of the windings of a star-connected motor and 
100% of the windings of a delta-connected motor (see section 10.1.1). 
 
The time delay may be fixed at 0.1 or 0.2 seconds. 
 

444     Protection of Electrical Networks 
 
It is preferable to perform the measurement by torroid. 
 
If the measurement is performed by 3 current transformers, a stabilizing resistor 
must be installed. This allows spurious tripping due to saturation of the CTs during 
motor start-up to be avoided. 
 
The method for determining the value of the stabilizing resistor is the same as 
for high impedance differential protection (see section 7.6.1.2.1). 
Motor fed by a network with unearthed neutral 
The fault current is made up of the network’s capacitive currents IC  only 
(see section 4.3.1). 
 
If IC  is low, i.e. less than or equal to the minimum threshold setting (1A for 
measurement by torroid: see section 10.1.2), earth fault protection cannot be used. 
The protection common to the entire network, a permanent insulation monitor (see 
sections 2.4.1 and 2.5.1) or a residual overvoltage protection is therefore used 
(see section 7.16). 
 
If IC  is high, i.e. much higher than the minimum threshold setting, earth fault 
protection can be used and set at the minimum threshold. 
 
If the cable between the protection and the motor is long, directional earth fault 
protection must be used so that spurious tripping upon occurrence of a fault on 
another outgoing feeder is avoided (see section 7.4.3 under the heading 
“Distinguishing between a fault current and a capacitive current”). 
Protection against excessive start-up time and rotor locking 
The starting current cannot be withstood for a period lasting longer than the 
normal start-up time. The allowable starting current time is between 5 and 20 
seconds, depending on the size of the motor and number of poles. Rotor locking 
causes a current which is very close to the direct starting current (6 to 8 times the 
nominal current). Operation of excessive start-up time and locked rotor protection is 
explained in section 7.9. 
Protection against a drop in supply voltage 
This is ensured by using undervoltage protection (see section 7.12) (the 
consequences of a drop in supply voltage on a motor are explained there). 
 

Protection of Network Elements     445 
 
Protection preventing the switching device from closing while the motors still hold 
a remanent voltage 
This is ensured by remanent undervoltage protection (see section 7.13, which 
discusses the consequences of remanent voltages when the motors are re-energized). 
Protection against too many successive start-ups 
The way this type of protection operates is explained in section 7.10 (the 
consequences of too many successive start-ups are explained there). 
Protection against a drop in current 
This protection is used to detect pump unpriming and breaks in load coupling. 
It is ensured by phase undercurrent protection (see section 7.11). 
Protection against loss of excitation 
This type of protection is used for synchronous motors. It is ensured by 
protection against reversals in reactive power (see section 7.18, which discusses the 
consequences of a loss of excitation of synchronous motors). 
Protection against generator operation 
This is ensured by protection against reversals in active power (see section 7.19, 
which discusses the consequences of synchronous motors operating as generators). 
Protection against rotor frame faults 
For synchronous motors: protection should be chosen in relation to the supply 
arrangement and DC generation method. If the entire DC excitation circuit is frame 
insulated, an insulation fault will not affect motor operation. 
 
On the other hand, if a second fault occurs, this may cause an overload or short-
circuit and damage the motor. 
 
Protection against this type of fault is usually ensured by a low frequency (2.5 to 
20 Hz) AC injection device. The rotor is put off voltage and the motor out of service 
as soon as the device detects an insulation fault. This is in order to avoid a double 
earth fault that may lead to the deterioration of the rotor. 
 
For asynchronous slipring rotor motors: if the rotor is unearthed, the protection 
is ensured by insulation monitoring (see section 2.5.1). The motor is put out of 
service as soon as the device detects an insulation fault. This is in order to avoid a 
double earth fault that may lead to the deterioration of the rotor.

The selection of fuses, circuit-breakers, contactors and thermal relays is defined 
in the catalogues in relation to the type of motor. 
 
 
For example: 
– gM fuses (motor-associated); 
– MA type magnetic trip relay with circuit-breaker. 
Other types of protection 
Large low voltage motors can be protected in a similar way to medium voltage 
motors using the following types of protection: 
– temperature monitoring (see section 7.23); 
– thermal overload (see section 7.7); 
– excessive starting time and rotor locking (see section 7.9); 
– phase cutting, inversion of two phases and phase unbalance (see section 7.8); 
– permanent insulation monitor (see section 2.4.1) or residual current device (for 
frame-phase faults). 
10.5. AC generator protection 
AC generator operation can be altered by faults occurring both within the 
machine and disturbances in the network to which it is connected. 
 
An AC generator protection system therefore has a dual purpose: protecting the 
machine and protecting the network. 
 
The main faults which may affect a generator are: 
– overload; 
– external phase-to-phase short-circuit; 
– internal phase-to-phase short-circuit; 
– internal phase-to-frame fault; 
– rotor frame fault; 
– phase cutting, inversion of two phases and phase unbalance; 
– loss in excitation; 
– motor operation; 
– under or overfrequency; 
– voltage too high or too low; 
– loss of utility power supply when generator is connected to it. 

Protection of Network Elements     453 
 
Protection against overloads 
Overcurrents point to the occurrence of overloads which, if they are prolonged, 
cause excessive heating, leading to accelerated ageing of the generator. 
 
Protection is ensured: 
– either by thermal overload protection (see section 7.7); 
– or by temperature monitoring (see section 7.23). 
Protection against external phase-to-phase short-circuits 
External phase short-circuits are faults appearing on the network fed by the 
generator. This type of protection depends on whether or not there is a system 
allowing the short-circuit current to be maintained at roughly 3 In  for several 
seconds (see section 4.1.2). 
Generator fitted with a system maintaining the short-circuit current at roughly 3 In  
for several seconds 
Protection is ensured by independent time phase overcurrent protection (see 
section 7.1). 
 
The current threshold must be coherent with dowstream protection devices. 
However, it may be set up to 2.5
nI . 
 
The time delay: as short as possible allowing selectivity with the downstream 
protection devices. 
Generator not fitted with a system maintaining the short-circuit current at roughly 
3 In  
Protection is ensured by voltage-restrained overcurrent protection (see section 
7.24). 
 
The current threshold may be set at 1.2
nI . 
 
The time delay: as short as possible allowing selectivity with the downstream 
protection. 
 
 
Note: installing a logic selectivity system (see section 9.3) may allow for a short 
time delay. The current detected by the protection is thus high (generator transient 
period: see section 4.1.2), and it is possible to install conventional phase overcurrent 
protection. 
 

454     Protection of Electrical Networks 
 
Specific case of small generators protected by circuit-breakers with a thermal-
magnetic tripping relay 
Let us consider the case of a generator directly feeding a low voltage switchboard. 
– Thermal threshold setting: this must be set at a higher value than the nominal 
current, e.g. at 1.2
nI . 
– Selection and setting of magnetic tripping relay: the magnetic relay tripping 
time is approximately between 10 and 20 ms. The minimum short-circuit current 
value on tripping is the phase-to-phase short-circuit current clear of earth for the 
transient period. 
 
In section 4.2.3 we saw that the phase-to-phase short-circuit current clear of

Protection against internal phase-to-phase short-circuits 
Internal phase-to-phase short-circuits may occur between turns of the same 
windings or of different windings following deterioration of the insulators. They 
generate high phase-to-phase overcurrents. 
 
Protection may be ensured: 
– using high impedance differential protection (see section 7.6.1.2.2); 
– using biased differential protection. 

Protection of Network Elements     455 
 
Protection against phase cutting, inversion of two phases and phase unbalance 
This is ensured using negative phase sequence component protection (see 
section 7.8). Protection against phase inversion of two phases may be carried out 
with a positive sequence undervoltage and phase rotation direction protection (see 
section 7.14). 
Protection against internal phase-to-frame faults 
This type of protection depends on the earthing system and the point where the 
earthing connection is installed for direct or limiting impedance earthing systems. 
Furthermore, the generator operates disconnected from the network during starting 
and stopping or during tests. The earthing system may thus be different according to 
whether the generator is connected or not to the network; the protection devices 
must therefore be suitable for both cases. 
 
 
Note: the direct earthing system, whether earthing is on the generator or on the 
network, is not advisable because in the event of an internal phase-to-frame fault the 
short-circuit current would be very high and would greatly damage the generator. 
The result is that if a generator directly feeds (without an isolating transformer) the 
low voltage network: 
– it is not advisable to install a TN earthing system; 
– for a TT earthing system, it is necessary to check that the earthing resistance 
limits are enough for the fault current; 
– the IT earthing system does not raise any particular difficulty for internal 
frame faults because the fault current is very low. 
Earthing at the neutral point of the generator stator 
Protection is: 
– either of the high impedance differential type as for transformers (see section 
7.6.1.2.4);  
– or the overcurrent protection type located on the neutral point earthing connection. 
Earthing in the network and not at the neutral point of the generator 
It is assumed that the neutral point of the generator is unearthed. Protection may 
be ensured either by: 
– earth fault protection located between the generator and the busbar. This 
causes tripping of the generator circuit-breaker when the generator is connected to 
the network. The current threshold may be set at 10% of the maximum earth fault 
current (i.e. 10% of the limiting current for a limiting impedance earthing system). 
This threshold allows 90% of the windings of a star-connected generator to be 
protected and 100% of the windings of a delta-connected generator to be protected 
(see section 10.1.1). The time delay may be set at 0.1 second; or by 

456     Protection of Electrical Networks 
 
– a permanent insulation monitor (see sections 2.4.1 and 2.5.1), or by a residual 
overvoltage protection (see section 7.16) when the generator is disconnected from 
the network and thus has an unearthed neutral system. 
Network with unearthed neutral system 
Protection is ensured by a permanent insulation monitor (see sections 2.4.1 and 
2.5.1) or by a residual overvoltage protection (see section 7.16). 
 
 
Note: if there is an insulation monitoring device on the network, it monitors the 
generator when it is connected to the network. On the other hand, it is necessary to 
install a monitoring device on the generator to protect it when it operates 
disconnected from the network. 
Protection against rotor frame faults 
Protection should be chosen in relation to the supply arrangement and DC 
generation method. If the entire DC excitation circuit is frame insulated, an 
insulation fault will not affect motor operation. 
 
On the other hand, if a second fault occurs, this may cause an overload or short-
circuit and damage the motor. 
 
Protection against this type of fault is usually ensured by a low frequency (2.5 to 
20 Hz) AC injection device. The rotor is put off voltage and the motor out of service 
as soon as the device detects an insulation fault. This is in order to avoid a double 
earth fault that may lead to deterioration of the rotor. 
Protection against a loss in excitation 
This is provided by a device protecting against reversals in reactive power (see 
section 7.18) (the causes and consequences of a loss of excitation are explained there). 
 
This type of protection does not work when the generator is cut off from the 
network. 
Protection against motor operation 
This is ensured by a protection against reversals in active power (see section 
7.19) (the causes and consequences of motor operation are explained there). 
Under or overfrequency protection 
This is ensured by an under or overfrequency protection (see section 7.17) (the 
causes and consequences of under or overfrequencies are explained there). 
 

Protection of Network Elements     457 
 
Undervoltage protection 
This is ensured by an undervoltage protection (see section 7.12) (the causes and 
consequences of an undervoltage are explained there). 
Overvoltage protection 
This is ensured by an overvoltage protection (see section 7.15). 
Protection against supplying active power to the utility  
This is ensured by a protection against reversals in active power (see 
section 7.19, which discusses the causes and consequences of supplying active 
power to the utility).

10.6.1. Electrical phenomena related to energization 
Capacitor bank energization causes current and voltage transient operating states. 
 
An overcurrent occurs, the amplitude and frequency of which depend on the 
specifications of the upstream network and the number of capacitor banks.

which corresponds to an impedance of 0.15 /km
Ω
 (see section 4.2.1.4).  
 
 
Note: we can consider that resistances are negligible in relation to inductances 
due to the high frequency of transient currents (see examples 1 and 2).

This very high current cannot be withstood by the capacitors and switching 
devices and reactors must therefore be installed to limit the inrush current (see 
section 10.6.3).

10.6.2. Protection of Schneider low voltage capacitor banks 
The characteristics of capacitors are specific to each manufacturer, so we will 
give as an example the case of Schneider capacitor protection. 
Thermal sizing of equipment (switching devices and cables) 
The allowable capacitor bank overload is 30% (standard range). Variations due 
to tolerances on capacitor values may lead to a current increase of 5% (IEC 60831-1 
allows a tolerance of 15%). 
 
The cumulated effect of both these phenomena means that the equipment must 
be sized for a current of 1.3 1.05
1.37
×
=
 times the capacitor bank nominal current. 
Selecting and calibrating protection devices for capacitor banks 
We saw previously that the value of the peak inrush current of a capacitor bank 
could be very high (especially for a switched steps bank). In practice, Schneider low 
voltage capacitor banks are fitted with contactors with an inrush current limiting 
resistor. 
 
This resistor prevents:

– the maximum making capacity of the switching devices (contactor, circuit-

It can be seen that the coefficient of increase of the switched steps bank fuse

is selected in relation to the nominal r.m.s. current (taking into account the 
harmonics). Reminder: the r.m.s. current is

10.6.3. Protection of Schneider Medium Voltage capacitor banks 
The characteristics of capacitors are specific to each manufacturer, so we will 
give as an example the case of Schneider capacitor protection. 

Protection of Network Elements     471 
 
Composition of high voltage capacitors 
High voltage capacitors are made up of elements connected in series to obtain 
voltage and connected in parallel to obtain the required capacitance. 
 
There are two types of capacitors: one having internal protection fuses and the 
other not. 
Capacitors without internal protection fuses 
A capacitor fails when an internal element breaks down. A fault on an element 
causes the shorting of a series-connected group and thus a rise in voltage in other 
series-connected groups (see Figure 10-44). 
 
Owing to the fact that there is no protective device inside the capacitor, the fault 
will only be cleared by the bank being disconnected due to the detection of an 
overcurrent.  
 
This type of capacitor is used in a delta-connected bank protected by fuses or 
overcurrent protection devices as an internal fault causes a high phase-to-phase 
current. 
 
This type of capacitor is also used in a double-star connected bank with neutral to 
neutral unbalanced protection which is activated upon occurrence of the first fault.

group short circuit
 
Figure 10-44: capacitor without internal protection fuses  

472     Protection of Electrical Networks 
 
Capacitors with internal protection fuses 
Each element is protected by a fuse. Any fault on an element will therefore be 
cleared and the faulty circuit isolated (see Figure 10-45). This is followed by a slight 
variation in the capacitance and an increase in the voltage applied to the parallel-
connected elements. 
 
This is why this type of capacitor is only used in a double star-connected bank 
(see Figure 10-47). The unbalance protection threshold is adjusted so that the loss of 
elements within the same series-connected group causes the bank to be tripped when 
the overvoltage on the parallel-connected elements becomes too high. 
 
Internal fuse protection increases capacitor bank reliability since the loss of an 
element does not systematically lead to the bank being tripped.

Figure 10-45: capacitors with internal protection fuses  
Capacitor bank layout 
Delta-connected bank (see Figure 10-46) 
 
Capacitors with internal fuses will never be used in this type of layout as their 
breaking capacity is not high enough for network short-circuit currents. 

Protection of Network Elements     473 
 
 
Figure 10-46: delta-connected bank 
Double star-connected bank (see Figure 10-47) 
The bank is divided into two star connections. When a capacitor is faulty an 
unbalance current appears in the neutral circuit. This current is detected by a 
suitable protection (see section 7.26). 
 
This type of bank can be used with capacitors with or without internal fuses. 
 
It can be designed for any type of network up to EHV networks. The assembly 
principle is always the same: to reach voltage levels of 100 kV and 200 kV a 
sufficient number of MV capacitors is connected in series.

High voltage capacitors do not have a contactor with a limiting resistor (unlike 
in low voltage).

When one of these conditions in not fulfilled, an impulse reactor A  is inserted 
between the capacitor and the switching device (see Figure 10-48). The inductance 
of the connection linking the switching device to the capacitor bank (0.5 µH/m) is 
negligible in relation to the value of the impulse reactor (approximately 100 µH: see 
example below).

Selection and settings of overcurrent protection devices 
Protection against overcurrents can be provided by a fuse or a circuit-breaker 
fitted with a double threshold independent time protection. 
Fuse protection 
The inrush current, even when limited by an impulse reactor, can lead to the 
fuses deteriorating. To determine the fuse rating, the peak inrush current must be 
calculated, as previously indicated, and the time constant of this transient current 
determined. The method is fairly complex and the upstream network resistance and 
fuse resistance must be known. 
 

478     Protection of Electrical Networks 
 
A software program exists which determines the fuse rating. 
 
In practice, ratings of 1.8 to 2.5 times the nominal current of the capacitor bank 
are used.

Using the calculation, it can be shown that the duration of the inrush current is 
short (especially for switched steps banks). It is less than 200 ms. 
 
The time delay Th  can therefore be set at 0.2 seconds. 
Protection against internal faults for double star-connected batteries 
As shown in Figure 10-49, a relay providing protection against unbalances 
between neutral points (see section 7.26) can be used to detect the circulation of a 
current in the link between the two neutral points. 
 
This current is caused by the deterioration of capacitor elements. 
 
The setting threshold is given by the manufacturer. 
 
The time delay is set at 0.1 second.

10.8. Protection of direct current installations 
Differences between AC and DC installations 
Although the basic design principles in each case are the same, there are 
nevertheless differences in: 
– the fault current calculations (short-circuit or insulation fault); 
– the choice of protective devices to be installed which must be suitable for the 
direct current.

characteristics:

10.8.3. Protection of persons 
The rules for protection are the same as those for AC networks. However, the 
conventional voltage limits and tripping times of protective devices are different: 
– all exposed conductive parts are therefore interconnected and earthed; 
– automatic tripping takes place in the time period specified. 
 
 
RCDs cannot be used.  
 
In practice, therefore, the following apply: 
– The principles of the TN scheme for cases 1 and 2 of Table 10-11. It is thus 
sufficient to check that, in the event of an insulation fault, the short-circuit current is 
large enough to cause the trip relays of the circuit-breakers providing overcurrent 
protection to operate. The checking methods are identical to those used for an AC 
network. 
– The principles of the IT scheme for case 3 in Table 10-11: 
- network insulation must be monitored and the occurrence of an insulation 
fault reported. A permanent insulation monitor must therefore be installed (see 
Figure 10-52); 
- the simultaneous presence of two faults on each polarity causes a short-
circuit which is cleared by the overcurrent protective devices. As for an AC system, 
it is sufficient to make sure that the current is large enough to cause the magnetic or 
short-time relays to be operated.

Table 10-11: line currents absorbed by GALAXY systems 
CB3 rating 
This is determined by the nominal current of each outgoing feeder. 
 
Section 10.9.3 shows the condition to be satisfied on the CB3 circuit-breaker 
rating to ensure selectivity with the CB2. 
10.9.2. Choice of circuit-breaker breaking capacity 
– Circuit-breakers CB1 and CB2 must have a breaking capacity greater than or 
equal to the maximum short-circuit current at the connection point of the UPS. This 
current is calculated using the usual method shown in section 4.2.1. 
– Circuit-breaker 
dc
CB
 must have a DC breaking capacity greater than the 
battery short-circuit current (see section 10.8.1 for how to calculate the short-circuit 
current of a storage battery). 
10.9.3. Selectivity requirements 
In the event of a fault on an outgoing feeder, selectivity is ensured by CB3 being 
tripped without CB2 being tripped or the inverter being tripped by self-protection. 
Case 1: selectivity only when network 2 is in service 
Let us assume that selectivity is not required when the load is fed by the inverter 
alone, i.e. when network 2 is out of service. 
 

486     Protection of Electrical Networks 
 
The selectivity study is none other than a conventional study between an 
upstream circuit-breaker CB2 and a downstream circuit-breaker CB3. 
 
Indeed, the static contactor controlled by the UPS automatic system allows 
switchover to network 2 to take place in a very short time ( 1
)
ms
<
 upon occurrence 
of a short-circuit downstream of an outgoing feeder. Circuit-breakers CB2 and CB3 
thus see the short-circuit on network 2. 
 
To ensure selectivity, check that the circuit-breakers CB3 are selective with the 
circuit-breaker CB2 for a short-circuit fed by network 2. 
 
When the fault is cleared by the circuit-breaker CB3, the static contactor 
controlled by the UPS automatic system allows switchover to network 1 with no cut 
in power. 
 
 
Note: there may be an LV/LV transformer on the network 2→ static contactor 
link (see section 1.6.3), which reduces the value of outgoing feeder short-circuit 
currents. Network 2 may have a back-up power supply provided by a generator set 
(see section 1.6.3). Selectivity must therefore be provided for both power supplies, 
by the generator set or by the network. 
Case 2: selectivity even when network 2 is out of service 
Let us assume that the selectivity is required even when the load is fed by the 
inverter alone, i.e. when network 2 is out of service. 
 
In this case, the inverter must be able to supply a short-circuit current able to trip 
circuit-breaker CB3 which has the highest current rating. When an overcurrent 
occurs, inverters operate as peak current limiters. For example, MGE UPS inverters 
limit the peak current at 
,
2.33
n inv
I
 for a period of one second. Beyond one second, 
the inverter is put out of service by self-protection. 
 
Thus, a short-circuit on an outgoing feeder will cause a current limited by the 
inverter, while the fault is being cleared by circuit-breaker CB3 (approximately 
20 ms). Once the fault has been cleared, the inverter returns to normal operation. 
 
Selectivity is ensured if this current is high enough to cause circuit-breaker CB3 
to be tripped. Its magnetic threshold (see section 8.1) must then be lower than the 
peak current limited by the inverter. Generally a low threshold must be chosen, for 
example, a B type according to IEC 60947-2. 
 
 
Note: when the inverter operates as limiter, it supplies a square signal, limited 
peak current value is thus equal to limited r.m.s. current value.

We shall demonstrate that the frequency of the transient current occurring upon 
energization is very high (see section 10.6.1, example 1; 
0

This results in justification of neglect of the network resistance in relation to the

Similarily, the resistance of the connection linking the switching device to the 
capacitor is negligible. 
 
 
The network frequency (50 Hz) is negligible in relation to the transient current 
frequency. We might therefore consider that we have a voltage step throughout the 
duration of the transient current. 
 
 
The value of the step, at worst, is the peak value of the sinusoidal voltage:

Voltage Peak Value and Current r.m.s Value, 
at the Secondary of a Saturated  
Current Transformer 
 
Let us consider a primary current with a peak value I p
1  at the CT saturation 
limit. 
 
 
Let I p
2
 be the peak value of a primary current greater than I p
1 , which is thus 
going to saturate the CT. 
 
 
Let I1 and I2  be the peak values of the currents at the CT secondary 
corresponding to I p
1  and I p
2
 through the transformation ratio. I2  is the design 
value that would be obtained if there was no saturation phenomenon. 
 
 
The current curves look like those in Figure C-1 (see Figure 6-5). 
 
 
According to section 6.1.2, the magnetic induction B  is proportional to 
I dt
∫
. 
The surface designed by the current is thus proportional to B. The current I1 being 
at the saturation limit, the surface S1 designed by I1 is proportional to the 
saturation magnetic induction.

Table C-1: comparison between the true r.m.s. value and the approximate value 
 
 
 
 
In spite of the saturation, the r.m.s. value of the current increases. An r.m.s. 
overcurrent relay will thus be activated even if the CT saturates. However, for a 
dependent time protection (see section 7.1), the real time delay may be higher than 
the forecasted value for the calculated current. Indeed, the saturation strongly 
reduces the r.m.s current value (power 1
4
).
