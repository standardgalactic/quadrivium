INTRODUCTION 
 
 
For solving the problems of study, analysis and quality management of the environment 
there is necessary operatively to treat great amount of measuring information on physical, 
chemical and biological parameters characteristic for them. To do it in a proper way, in 
conformity to the modern requirements, is possible only by wide use of modern mathematical 
methods and computers. For this purpose it is necessary to develop automated systems and 
universal program packages with developed mathematical methods consisting of self-learning 
algorithms requiring whenever it is possible minimum a prior information and having 
capability of adaptation to the most unexpected changes of the character of the investigated 
objects [1]. 
Among the most topical problems of monitoring of a natural water environment it is 
necessary to single out the following issues: simulation of pollutants transferring in water 
objects; methods of making decisions about condition of controlled objects and processes 
taking place in them; identification of sources of emergency pollution to take measures for 
their elimination. These problems are especially urgent in urban conditions because there 
exist great number of sources of pollution. Their solution is of great ecological and 
economical significance which makes possible to investigate the effect of different sources of 
pollution on ecological object separately from each other, as well as jointly, to predict out-
comes of such an impact and consequences of the nature protection measures against the 
sources of pollution. With their help, the minimization of technical means, in particular, those 
of measurements, indispensable for the control and management of each source of pollution is 
reached. They are also actual for large plants and factories having biochemical clearing of 
sewages, on their design and ecological safe operation, as well as for detection of sites and 
shops producing the excess of sewages pollution. 
Theoretical analysis of water pollution consequences, economic assessment of losses and 
creation of methodical principles on the basis of these investigations for the definition of effi-
ciency of capital investments in nature protection measures are impossible without knowledge 
of the processes of pollutants diffusion. Development of scientifically reasonable programs of 
long-term planning of measures, directed to the reduction of discharges of different sources, 
evaluation of ecological perfection of various technologies, development of methods and 
tools for monitoring, prediction and management of environmental quality are inextricably 
connected with mathematical modeling of processes of transfer and diffusion of harmful 
impurities. On the other hand, availability of modern automated environmental management 
and monitoring systems open wide possibilities for using mathematical methods during study

and rational utilization of natural resources. Success of application of mathematical methods 
in the solution of separate problems, in many respects depends on adequacy of models used 
for description of real processes, taking place in the studied environment. Mathematical 
models describing formation and development in time of a state of environmental objects, are 
used as at pre-design stage of design development for monitoring systems (selection of a 
system structure, site-installation of stations – auto-analyzers, time-space decidability of 
measurement tools, etc.), so during their exploitation (algorithms for the evaluation of a state, 
forecasting, identification of emergency discharge sources, etc [1]). 
A number of scientific works is dedicated to the development and application of 
mathematical models of water environment pollution (see chapters 1, 3). In general case 
depending on the studied problems through mathematical models, their structures, detailed 
study of the phenomenon, the volume of the used experimental information, mathematical 
models of the environmental pollution can be united in three large classes [1]: numerical 
(diffusive), statistical and imitative. Each of them has the advantages and disadvantages and 
in many respects depends on the rate of adequacy of conditions of studied process of 
pollution. 
Numerical models based on the solution of relevant differential equations of diffusion 
and transfer of pollutants are most widely spread (see chapter 1). However, due to the fact 
that environmental objects are rather complex systems with a huge number of interrelated 
parameters, the operating evaluation of which as a rule, is not easy, the accuracy of the 
deterministic models is limited. They are constructed on the basis of analysis of physical-
chemical and biological processes in the environment and reflect the development of these 
processes in time. Their advantage is the clearness of cause-effect relationship in these 
processes. The application is efficient at solving of particular, local in a space and time scale 
problems. The problem of application limits for these models has not been studied in detail 
till now, although in the work [2] is shown that of weather forecast-time interval by 
differential equations in principle cannot exceed 15 days. At appropriate selection of a 
structure and methods of identification, statistical models allow to predict with satisfactory 
accuracy during practically interesting time period at correct use of experimental data.  
Statistical models, or so-called models “of a black box”, differ by that their structure and 
the parameters are determined on the basis of the measurement information by minimization 
of given criterion (see chapter 3). Two basic groups of such models can be distinguished: the 
absence of a prior knowledge about structure of a model is characterized for the first one 
(researcher works it out in result of successive checking of several probable structures); for 
the second one - structure of a model can be partially or completely determined from the ratio 
of the material balance or on the basis of pre known descriptions of processes and 
phenomena. The advantage of the models of the given class is a simplicity and rather low 
sensitivity to random fluctuations of the researched objects. These models have been fast 
developed in connection with development of informational - measuring systems with real-
time data processing. 
In recent years imitative models have been widely applied in solving of many 
environmental protection problems (see paragraph 3.6). Their advantage implies capabilities 
of joint application of the first two types of models as interrelated units in general process of 
imitation. The ability to systematic development and perfection of imitative models in the 
process of accumulation of new knowledge through advancement separate units or adding 
new ones makes these models the most perspective ones among all other models of formation

of a state of environmental objects. Besides contrary to the models of the first two classes, 
imitative models allow to predict multi-version consequences of the future work-loads and 
strategies of control for the most different environmental objects. 
Depending on the available a prior information it is possible to consider different pro-
cedures of making decisions (see chapter 4). In the present work, the solution of a certain 
problem of making decisions is considered. In particular, a problem of testing statistical 
hypotheses on the condition of environmental object on the basis of results of measurement is 
considered. With an increase of a prior information it becomes possible to use more complex 
procedures of testing hypotheses ensuring higher reliability. Therefore in the present work 
there are brought the different procedures of testing hypotheses depending on the available a 
prior information and purposes for which they are used. 
There are brought mathematical bases of the solution (chapters 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) and 
software implementation (chapters 6 and 7) of most important problems of environmental 
monitoring: mathematical models of pollutants transfer in rivers and identification of sources 
of emergency pollution of the rivers. The results of investigation of developed software 
packages are given (see chapters 8). 
In the given work the authors aim to systematize the obtained results in the indicated 
directions during the last years and to set forth them compactly in the most accessible form 
for a wide range of possible users of the most different specialties and education levels. We 
would be glad if we managed to reach an objective even partially. All models, methods and 
algorithms described in the book are realized as software packages for IBM-compatible 
computers and have the complete off-the shelf packaging for practical application. There are 
two independent software packages attached to the present book envisaged for the modeling 
of diffusion of multi-sources water pollutants discharged to rivers and identification of 
sources of emergency pollutions. These packages are developed in accordance with the world 
standards of the similar products. Their abilities, user guides, i.e. instructions for input of 
initial information, making computations and perception of output results, are described in the 
book (see chapters 6 and 7). We hope that these packages will be the available for 
researchers, specialists and interested persons for solving problems started before them in 
respective fields. In case of interest they can address to authors of this book about conditions 
of acquisition of these packages on the address: kartlos5@yahoo.com. 
In conclusion the authors would like to express deep gratitude to the International 
Science and Technology Center (ISTC) and the U.S. Civilian Research and Development 
Foundation and its Georgian Branch (CRDF - GRDF), as the majority of results given in this 
book would not be obtained without financial assistance rendered by these funds within the 
framework of the project G-047 “Identification of River Water Pollution Sources by Means of 
Automated Control Systems” and the project GP2-3302 “Development and research of 
deterministic and stochastic mathematical models for control and management of pollution 
level of fluvial waters and their realization by application package”.

DETERMINISTIC MATHEMATICAL MODELS OF 
POLLUTANTS TRANSFER IN RIVERS 
 
 
1.1. MATHEMATICAL MODELING OF  
POLLUTANTS TRANSFER IN RIVERS 
 
Modeling water quality in freshwater ecosystems is considered to be a complex problem 
due to a high number of factors taking part on the process and the different forms in which 
pollution can be observed. In this chapter we will focus on water quality models aiming at 
describing processes of transfer, dilution and self-purification of harmful substances in 
freshwater ecosystems for rather small interval of time. 
Transfer of pollutants is a well know process in general described by the equation of 3D-
turbulent diffusion of non-conservative substances [1, 3-5, 25-27, 35]:

 requires is 
complex as it depends on sewage discharge conditions, the characteristics of the watercourse, 
the objective for which the model was developed and the model assumptions made. The 
combination of the above factors results in different kinds of the equation of three, two or 
one-dimensional turbulent diffusion equations . The solution of the latest is realized by 
numerical methods or analytically.  
For continuous coastal pollution sources the concentration of the pollutant is known to 
disseminate non-uniformly on the watercourse. If the non-uniformity of distribution of 
concentrations of pollutants on the depth of the watercourse is not taken into account, then it 
is possible to obtain the two-dimensional turbulent diffusion equation [1, 5-7, 12, 28-31]

Equation (1.2) defines the distribution of concentration of pollutant along and across of 
the stream taking into account non-uniformity of this distribution. The equation is solved 
using the method of grids with the transition to the corresponding difference scheme [6-8].  
The equation of one-dimensional turbulent diffusion is applied when the distribution of 
the concentration of the pollutant across the stream is homogeneous. It is also used when 
average indicators are used to represent pollution across the river. The one-dimensional 
equation is as follows [5, 9]

In works [4, 5] it is specified that the one-dimensional model of turbulent diffusion of 
non conservative pollutants satisfactorily describes processes of self-purification and 
transferring pollutants in small streams with small speeds of flow, and solutions obtained on 
the basis of this model are applicable on the sections located below of some cross-section, 
called the cross-section of full intermixing. However for solving the majority of considered 
problems for qualitative estimation of waters, the accuracy of one-dimensional model appears 
 insufficient. In this connection there is a necessity of developing the quantitative estimations 
which  would allow to define borders of action of one-dimensional model of turbulent 
diffusion  depending on the values of the parameters of the stream, characteristics of pollutant 
and the kind of its dropping. For solving this problem we shall consider the more in detail the 
equation of two-dimensional turbulent diffusion (1.2).

From the condition (1.12) follows that a case when the parameter of dropping

corresponds to the uniform  on width of a stream drop of pollutant. In this connection, the 
solution (1.16) of the equation of two-dimensional turbulent diffusion coincides with the

The analysis of (1.16) shows that at fixed value of the ratio

increases with increasing the value ; 2) the increase of the co-ordinate x , on the contrary, 
leads to the reduction of ; starting from some value 
x , the value becomes practically 
equal to 0 , i.e. the cross-section, being distant from the place of dropping by the distance 
x
, is the cross-section of full mixing; 3) the value 
x , which is the boundary of action of two-
dimensional model, depends on the value of the parameter of dropping , speed V , width 
H , coefficient 
x
K  and practically  does not depend on the coefficient of non-
conservativeness q .  
For more precise definition of the dependence of

K , the stationary mode of process of distribution of pollutant is considered at unit function

water;  is the area  of live section of the river-bed; K  is the module of the expense,

; C  is the coefficient of Shezy; R  is hydraulic radius. The problem (1.29), as 
well as (1.1), (1.2), solves by numerical methods, in particular, by the method of grids [8, 16]. 
In works [15, 17, 18], the multi-component models, considering transformation of one 
pollutant in another (for example, consecutive transformation of compounds of nitrogen), are 
considered; they are based on the equations of balance of pollutant and the equations of 
hydraulics of flows with corresponding initial and boundary conditions. Diffusion 
coefficients, speed of the flow of a stream, the characteristic of streams were supposed known 
in these models, which in a real situation are defined from hydraulic calculations on the basis 
of natural observations. Besides, in models the errors of measurement, essentially influencing 
results of calculations, were not considered. If the size of the measuring information is

11
significant (in the sense of mathematical statistics), then instead of similar enough difficult 
models much more effectively is to pass to more simple statistical models which, at the same 
time, are steadier against errors of measurements [1, 3, 19, 20]. Such models are considered in 
Chapter 3  of the present monograph. 
In work [21], models of eftrofication for modeling of seasonal change of concentration of 
sea seaweed depending on the use of fertilizers are given. These models were used for 
computer realization of the methodology developed in works [23, 24], and also for carrying 
out of numerical experiment. In work [22], the further development of these models in the 
form of three-dimensional eftroficating numerical model is given. The last, along with the 
quality of the water, describes also hydrodynamics and simultaneously unites requirement of 
oxygen and isolation of nutrients from sediments. 
In work [25], questions of hydrochemistry, hydrodynamics and hydrobiology, connected 
with so-called intra-reservoir processes are considered. The analysis of modern methods of 
studying the basic intra-reservoir processes is given and the necessity of the development of 
the methodology, methods and means of natural modeling of hydrodynamic  and chemical-
biological processes  is shown. 
In work [32], many processes proceeding in the environment which are solved by means 
of modeling, including processes of pollution and processing of sewage are described. Both in 
the book and on enclosed diskette many examples of modeling are resulted. They are realized 
in the language of modeling ISIM and are ready to use for  carrying out of calculations on the 
computer in operational system DOS. This possibility will allow  the reader to penetrate into 
the essence of mathematical models and modeling process more deeply. 
In the collective monograph [32], the problem of quality of water is considered from the 
uniform  system point of view. In the first part of the book, the technique of the system 
analysis which includes not only the use of this or that mathematical apparatus, but also  the 
basic concepts of their application is studied. The second part of the book contains examples 
of application of the offered methods  to the solution of concrete tasks of different level. 
Those  are: models of primary production in fresh-water reservoirs, models of nitrification 
process in real river system, models of transferring pollutants in the estuaries and open sea. 
The set of practical examples is given in the book. 
In the monograph [34], the deterministic-probability approach to the description and 
forecasting of polluting processes of superficial waters by using hardware-software means of 
mathematical modeling is offered; it includes: the method of electro-convective-diffusion 
analogy and its realization on analogue computers and on the hybrid computer complex; 
complex factor-cluster-taxonomy method and its realization on the computer; package of 
applied programs for the forecast of the field of concentration and computation of maximum 
permissible drop on the computer. 
In [41] are considered one-dimensional Saint-Venant classical equations and numerical 
algorithms for describing the processes of heat and mass transfer in river flows, the 
sedimentation and stirring-up of pollutants taken into account. Some results of numerical 
experiments are given. 
In [228] is presented a simple mathematical model for river pollution and is investigated 
the effect of aeration on the degradation of pollutant. The model consists of a pair of coupled 
reaction-diffusion-advection equations for the pollutant and dissolved oxygen concentrations, 
respectively. The coupling of these equations occurs because of reactions between oxygen 
and pollutant to produce harmless compound. There is considered the steady-state case in one

spatial dimension. For simplified cases the model is solved analytically. Also is presented a 
numerical approach to the solution in the general case. There is shown that for the Tha Chin 
River in Thailand simple models can provide decision support for planning restrictions to be 
imposed on farming and urban practices. 
 
 
1.2. MATHEMATICAL MODELS OF TRANSFER  
AND TURBULENT DIFFUSION 
 
Dynamics of transfer of pollutants in river water is described by the diffusion equations. 
Usually these equations should be solved numerically, with the help of difference schemes. 
Here are some questions, related to the choice of methods of solving various problems from 
which the practical realizability, the accuracy and the duration of obtaining the solution on the 
computer depend on. In particular: a) the analytical description of flat or spatial area for 
which the equations of diffusion and boundary conditions are investigated, i.e. the analytical -
description of coastal lines and a river bed; b) the analytical description of the dependence of 
coefficients of the equation from spatial co-ordinates; c) the analytical description of 
dependence on spatial co-ordinates and from time of non-uniform parts of the solved 
equations of diffusion, i.e. powers of pollution sources; d) the correct choice in difference 
scheme ratios between spatial steps of the grid, and also between them and the step of 
digitization of time.  
The listed questions are considered by authors of the presented work in [36–40]. The 
basic results are given below after formulation of the problem of dissemination of pollutants 
in the form of equation of transfer and diffusion with additional conditions, and review of 
known numerical methods of solving these equations. 
For clearness we shall introduce the following designations, used in future. 
Parameters defining geometry and dynamics of the considered section of the river: 
y
x,
 – horizontal Descartes co-ordinates (m);  – longitudinal co-ordinate (m);  – 
transverse co-ordinate (m); z  – vertical Descartes co-ordinate (m); t  – parameter of time 
(sec); 
)
(x
W
 – the width of the river (m); 
)
(x
E
 – the area of cross-section of the river (m2); 
)
,
(
y
x
H
 – the depth of the river (m); 
)
(r
v
 – the velocity of the flow (m/sec). 
Parametres of river water: s , S ,  – the concentration of the pollutant (mg/m3); 
)
,
( r
t
f
 – power of pollution sources (mg/m3); 
)
(t
Fj
 – integrated power of j th pollution 
source (mg/sec); 
)
(t
p j
 – the discharge of water by j th source of pollution (m3/sec); 
)
(r
K
 
– tensore of turbulent diffusion (m2/sec); 
)
(r

 – coefficient of non conservativeness (sec-1); 
q  – coefficient of self-purification; l  – the length of self-purification (m).  
Each of water parameters corresponds to some pollutant from the list of polluting 
components by which modeling is realized. By M  we shall designate the number of 
pollutants from the available list, common for all sections, and by R  – the number of sources 
of pollution from the list, corresponding to the considered section. The index j  is the number 
of the source of pollution operating on the considered –section of the river. 
For calculation of the power of sources of pollution we shall use the following formula:

Investigated equation is m-dimensional equation of diffusion. We shall consider 
following models: 1) one-dimensional model (

); 
3) three-dimensional model (
3

). Three-dimensional model is the most exact among 
considered. Other models should be considered as special cases of three-dimensional model. 
Concerning their practical use depending on characteristics of the rivers and solved problems 
see paragraph 8.4.

In given below two-dimensional and three-dimensional equations of diffusion 
independent variables are t , x , y , z . Here the given equations have the traditional form 
of record in which it is supposed that the considered section of the river lasts along the axis of 
abscess, not deviating aside. If the river on the considered section is twisting then in the 
equations horizontal Cartesian co-ordinates x  and y  should be replaced by appropriate -
curvilinear – longitudinal and transverse co-ordinates  and . Definition of these co-
ordinates and their relation to the Cartesian co-ordinates are described in paragraph 1.4.1.

1.3. SOME ANALYTICAL METHODS USING AT SOLVING 
MULTIDIMENSIONAL PROBLEMS 
 
At modeling, before and after numerical solution of the equations of diffusion, often  
there is expedient to apply, to these equations and their solutions, some  analytical  methods 
for simplification of algorithms of solution, for evidence and clearness of obtained results. 
Some of these methods are considered in the present paragraph. 
 
1. Replacement of variables in the diffusion equation. Let us consider m -dimensional

which is required to be solved for some area G  of m -dimensional space taking into account 
the set of initial and boundary conditions. 
For using the algorithm described in  paragraph  2.1 at solving the given equation, it is 
necessary, first of all, by replacement of independent spatial co-ordinates, to transform the 
area G  in the hyper-parallelepiped which co-ordinates of points satisfy inequalities

Sometimes (for example, at detection of emergency pollution sources of the river (see

make preliminary calculation of the concentration of pollutants in the rivers for different 
modes of drops from pollution sources, acting on the given section of the river. The results of 
the calculation will be repeatedly used further. In such cases, it is convenient to present 
required concentration in the form

1.4. DESCRIPTION OF RIVER  
BANKS BY SPLINES 
 
The question of analytical setting plane or spatial areas, for which the diffusion equation 
and boundary conditions are investigated, is considered [37]. This area is the part of the bed 
of the river on the considered section, filled by water.  
There is introduced the system of orthogonal curvilinear coordinates which serve for 
simplification analytical description of plane area, restricted by coastal lines of the river. Such 

Deterministic Mathematical Models of Pollutants Transfer in Rivers 
23
description is necessary for numerical solution of diffusion equation, describing the change of 
concentrations of pollutants in river water.  
For analytical description of plane curve, given in the form of the sequence of not 
coinciding points with certain Cartesian coordinates, which, in particular, can be one of the 
coastal lines of the river, the interpolation by splines is used. Algorithms of construction of 
two splines, having explicit forms and provided continuous dependence of tangential vector 
of the curve from its parameter, are described.  
 
 
1.4.1. The Contour of the River  
 
       For analytical setting of the bank lines, in order to simplify the calculations, it is 
expedient to use curvilinear coordinates instead of Cartesian coordinates, which are connected 
with some conditional curve, which stretches along the river between its banks. Hereinafter 
this curve we shall call contour of the river. This expediency is conditioned by two facts 
given below: the first is the relation of one of the Cartesian coordinates of points of the bank 
lines from other coordinate can be multiple valuted in connection with a veering of the river, 
while the lines can be specified in the explicit form in curvilinear coordinates if the river 
contour is selected properly and its banks are not hardly indented. Secondly, under certain 
conditions [5] the diffusion equations in curvilinear coordinates do not contain mixed 
derivative and, therefore, the problem of their numerical solution is essentially simplified. 
Suppose some curve is given in the parametric form

1.4.5. Final Remarks  
 
The approximation of the given contour by means of interpolating spline-curve from the 
reviewed above classes is good in such cases, when the number of available nodes of the 
contour is great enough, otherwise for large values of the parameter  the approximated 
curve can essentially differ from the given one. For example, if trigonometrical spline-
interpolation is being used for approximating the sinusoid, given for equidistant values of 
abscissa with the interval 0.8, the interpolating curve, introduced in Fig.1.4 will be obtained. 
In this figure the initial sinusoid is shown by the dotted line; the nodes are distinguished by 
their sizes. The similar picture is given by approximating this sinusoid using the interpolation 
by integrals of fractional rational functions. 
If the number of known coordinates of the contour points is not great enough, it is 
possible to solve the above mentioned problem in the following way. 
Let us represent the initial curve in the parametric form 
 
 
 
where 
 is the length of the polygon line connecting the current point of the curve with all 
previous nodes. The functions 
and 
can be approximated by cubical splines [16]. 
In this case 
 does not serve as a natural parameter of the curve and, therefore, assignment of 
the approximating curve by means of cubical splines does not give the capability to work with 
curvilinear coordinates, introduced in the section1.4.1. However such way of assignment of 
the approximating curve allows to compute approximate values of coordinates of initial curve 
in some additional points, thereby having increased number of available nodes, then 
approximating of an available contour by spline-curve by methods described in sections1.4.3 
and 1.4.4 is already possible. 
For example, if we increase the number of nodes of the reviewed above sinusoid using 
above described method, inserting three additional nodes between each adjacent points, the 
approximating curve practically will merge with the given sinusoid. 
The use of splines while approximating a plane curve has all advantages which are 
typical for splines used for approximating of ordinary numeric functions, namely: 
convergence, stability and relative simplicity of the mathematical expressions. In order to 
meet the requirement of the curve parameter’s being natural, we had to refuse conventional 
ways of determination of splines by means polynomials.

After we compare two offered methods of construction of splines: one - by means of 
trigonometrical functions and another - by means of integrals of fractional rational functions, 
it is possible to say, that advantage of the first method is the relative simplicity and reliability 
of calculations, its imperfection – more sensitivity to “rarefaction” of nodes. 
The description of offered algorithms contains everything required for their 
implementation in form of computer programs. Such programs are drawn up by the authors of 
this work and are tested on many control examples and are used in computer packages 
“Application package of realization of mathematical models of pollutants transfer in rivers 
(MMPT)” (Version 2.0) [227] and “Automatic Detection of River Water Excessive Pollution 
Sources (ADrweps)” (Version 2.0) [210] described in Chapters 6 and 7. 
 
 
1.5. ABOUT APPROXIMATION OF RIVER CURRENT SPEED 
 
The problem of correct determination of river current speed is very important for the 
problem of modeling the transfer of pollutants in rivers. Despite this, in general case, it is not 
solved till now because of complexity and variety of variants depending on features of the 
rivers. We reduce one of practical ways of its solution below. 
Geometrical characteristics of a channel of the river, on which the speed of a current 
depends, can strongly vary on a considered section, especially if the mountain river is 
investigated. From components of the vector of the current speed and their derivatives on 
spatial co-ordinates, in one’s turn, coefficients of turbulent diffusion depend on. It is clear, 
that, generally, for speed of the current it is impossible to use simple linear interpolation in 
which values of the speed only on the section ends are considered, except any special cases 
when, for example, water flows on the rectangular channel. Practical obtaining values of the 
speed of the current in many points of the section, in general case, are very difficult and 
expensive problem. Therefore it is necessary to solve this problem analytically especially as 
the geometry of the section of the river unequivocally defines the speed of the current in any 
point of this section.  
One of possible approaches to the solution of this problem consists in the following: to 
use linear interpolation for the dependence of the expense of water

(r

 on longitudinal co-
ordinate, and by

(r

(r

 is the area of cross-section of the river in point r . Namely such method is 
realized in packages of applied programs described in Chapters 6 and 7. This method is 
simple, but, unfortunately, rough since it allows to determine only average value of the speed 
on all cross-section of the river. 
For exact solution of this problem, apparently, it is impossible to go around solution of 
difficult equations of hydrodynamics – equations of Navier-Stokes or any simplified variant -
of this equation, but necessarily considering viscosity of the water. The problem considerably 
will become simpler, if it succeeds to be reduced to the solution of some linear differential 
equation which can be solved, for example, by numerical methods.

2.1.1. Boundary Problem 
 
At solution of the diffusion equation, a boundary problem is considered as auxiliary [38, 
40, 222, 223]. In this problem, unknown function 
x

 is defined at 
X
x 
, where X  is 
the interval (in a one-dimensional problem) or the region (in a multivariable problem). The 
problem contains the differential equation

operator; ˆ  is the first-order linear differential operator.     
At the solution of the boundary problem, the differential equation for internal points of 
the region X  is replaced with the difference equation

In the future, for the simplicity, in difference equations the index h  is omitted so far as it 
does not complicate understanding of the essence of the presented material.   
The accuracy of approximation of the differential operator ˆ  by difference operator

2. Reduction of the multi-dimensional diffusion equation to the one-dimensional. 
Described below algorithm of solution of diffusion equation is used in multi-dimensional 
problems and is an alternative to the considered above algorithms. In this algorithm solution 
of the multi-dimensional diffusion equation is presented as linear combination of solutions of 
some one-dimensional diffusion equations [30, 43]. This method is often called the method of 
splitting of operator or the method of decomposition of the multi-dimensional operator. 
Analogously of the above considered algorithm, the region X  transforms into the hyper 
parallelepiped and is accepted that after such transformation the operator

used in investigations of qualitative peculiarities of pollutants transfer and of efficiency and 
accuracy of calculation methods on the base of one-dimensional as well as two- and three-

absence of initial pollutions, is reduced to the known error probability integral and is 
calculated particularly simply. 
 
 
2.4. ALGORITHMS FOR SOLVING TWO-DIMENSIONAL 
MATHEMATICAL MODELS 
 
For approximate solution of the problem (1.33), (1.34), the suitable numerical methods 
were developed on the basis of finite-difference method. In particular, for numerical solution 
of the stated problems there were developed the explicit scheme, the method of splitting the 
operator and the method of approximate factorization. Each of these methods has its 
advantages and lacks which the most fully appear on the stage of algorithmization.   
Let us consider that the water course occupies region G  in space of points

 are coordinates of point M  in the orthogonal system of coordinates; 
axis x  is directed along the averaged water flow velocity, y  is directed from the surface 
level of water course downward, z  is directed transverse to water course, orthogonally to 
plane 
)
(xOy . 
The most general two-dimensional equation with the initial and boundary conditions is 
given in the previous paragraph. If pollutant concentration along transverse axis z  is assumed 
to be unchangeable, then, in equation (1.33), it must be stated that x

Thus, the scheme of splitting (2.30)-(2.34) approximates non-classical-non-local problem 
(1.33), (1.34), (2.25)-(2.27), (2.29).

then the problem (2.30)-(2.32), (2.34), (2.35) will approximate classical problem (1.33), 
(1.34), (2.25)-(2.28). Theoretical substantiation of such splitting exists [216]. 
Problems (2.30)-(2.34) and (2.30)-(2.32), (2.34), (2.35) may be solved by different 
methods. We have constructed effective finite-difference schemes for their solution [217, 
218]. 
In case of classical boundary conditions, the method of scrolling is used for solving the 
received tree-point equations [219]. In case of non-classical boundary conditions, the 
scrolling formulae of special type are derived [30, 221].

2.6. OPTIMIZATION PROBLEMS OF THE ALGORITHMS CONNECTED 
WITH DIFFERENCE SCHEMES 
 
Let us consider problems of optimum choice of the parameters of the algorithm at 
practical realization of difference schemes [38, 40]. As criterion of optimality, there is 
considered the necessity of maximum decreasing the computation time and error. Offered 
below algorithm is suitable for the case when the function describing the transfer of pollutants 
in water has derivatives including fourth order.  
 
 
2.6.1. Optimization, Used in Boundary Problem 
 
Let us consider the problem formulated in Item 2.1.1. Further are used designations 
introduced in appointed item.  
1. Estimation of the misclosure in one-dimensional difference schemes. In one 
dimensional case, the misclosure of approximation of the equation, corresponding to the 
difference operator

2. Estimation of the misclosure in multi-dimensional difference schemes. Let us 
consider m -dimensional boundary problem at the same conditions which were considered in 
Item 2 of Paragraph 1.3.1. In particular, tensor x
A
 is supposed to be diagonal. The latter 
condition means that the misclosure of the equation in this case can be presented in the form 
of the sum of m  misclosures corresponding to different coordinate axes:

3. Optimization of the choice of numbers 
m
n
n ,...,

. The total number of nodal points 
N  determines the time necessary for realization of the algorithm; the accuracy of the 
obtained result depends on it. Naturally, there arises the question: how it is necessary to pick 
up the numbers 
m
n
n ,...,
1
 at the given value N  so that the algorithm should be somewhat 
optimum. 
In conformity with the stated above, the upper bound of the module of the misclosure

Thus, at the optimum choice of spatial steps of the grid along different coordinate axes, 
the upper bound of the misclosure proves to be the sum of m  equal components, each of 
which is proportional to the square of the corresponding step 
kh . In other words, each of 
parameters 
kh  brings identical “contribution” to the error of the result. 
The main difficulty for practical realization of the described scheme of optimization is 
the necessity of estimation of the upper bound of partial derivatives of function 

x

 with 
respect to the spatial coordinates in terms of which parameters 
k
 are expressed (see Section 
2.6.3) without solving the differential equation.

2. Optimization of the choice of parameter  for the scheme of the 
2
 order. 
Similarly to the solution of boundary problems, at realization of difference schemes for the 
diffusion equation, the question arises: how to pick up the parameters of the algorithm in the 
optimum way. In this case, it is the question of the optimum choice of the parameter  at the 
given spatial steps of the grid.

We shall consider that the mean time it takes the computer to solve the set of N  linear 
equations at big values of N  is proportional to 
k
N , where k  is some positive constant.  
If the method of scrolling is used at solution of the set of equations, then 
1

k
. 
If the Seidel method is used at solution of the set of equations and the number of nonzero 
elements in each row of the matrix of the considered set is fixed and does not depend on N , 
then

 satisfy the same conditions as in the previous Section; in particular, the tensor 

should be diagonal. 
In conformity with the stated above in the present and previous Sections, when the 
symmetric difference scheme is used, the upper bound of the module of the misclosure

The optimization consists in that, at the given value of upper bound of the module of the 
misclosure of the equation which is equal to , there are defined such values  and N  for 
which the time of calculation assumes the minimum value:

In the case when

. This 
result is similar to the one obtained in Item 3 of the previous Section. 
The main difficulty in practical realization of the described scheme of optimization, as 
well as in realization of the similar scheme at solution of the boundary problem, is the 
necessity in estimation of the upper bound of partial derivatives of the function 


x

 by 
time and spatial coordinates in terms of which parameters 

 and

 are expressed (see 
Section 2.6.3) without solving the diffusion equation. 
 
3. Optimization of the choice of parameter  for the scheme of the  order. Let us 
consider the same problem as in the previous Item provided that the used difference scheme is 
not symmetric. In this case, the upper bound of the module of the misclosure |(t,x,,h)| of 
the considered diffusion equation can be presented in the form of

2.6.3. Estimation of Unknown Function Derivatives 
 
As already mentioned in the previous two sections, for practical realization the described 
optimization schemes, it is necessary to estimate somehow the upper bounds of the modules 

Calculation Schemata of Mathematical Models 
57
of partial derivatives of the unknown function with respect to independent variables without 
solving the boundary or the mixed problem.   
It should be borne in mind that the derivatives of these functions can be estimated up to 
the common constant multiplier. 
One of the ways of the solution of this problem consists in the following: for some values 
of the parameters 
kh  and  (at solution of diffusion equation), the values of the function  
are determined as a first approximation, then, by means of the numerical differentiation 
operations the required derivatives are determined and the values of the sought for the 
parameters are calculated. After that, using these values there are determined new values of 
the function  and so on until the difference between the neighbouring calculated values of 
the function are less than the given value. At the solution of the diffusion equation it is 
possible to use the explicit scheme at the first stage. Further it is necessary to determine the 
values of the sought function with higher accuracy.  
In this case, for calculation of the unknown function values, there is applied the iteration 
method similar to the one used in work [1, 44, 45] at calculation of the multidimensional 
integral by the Monte-Carlo method, at calculation of estimations of the polynomial 
regression on the basis of active experiment and at calculation of the covariance function with 
given accuracy.  
It is known that the operations of numerical differentiation are not steady, but this should 
not prevent the realization of the offered method which is effected in the package of 
realization of mathematical models of pollutants transfer in rivers (see Chapter 6) since it 
requires only the rough estimates of unknown derivatives. 
The obvious draw-back of the given method is necessity of performance of a plenty of 
additional actions.

The minimum and maximum values of the required function in the considered region are: 
 
ymin0.083 ; 
 
ymax299.0 . 
 
The numerical calculations are performed in two ways: without optimization and with 
optimization of the choice of numbers 
1n  and 
2
n , described in Item 3 of Section 2.6.1. In 

Calculation Schemata of Mathematical Models

both cases, the total number of nodal points is accepted equal to 
1000

N
. 
At carrying out the calculations without optimization, the numbers 
1n  and 
2
n  are 
selected so that spatial steps of the grid 
1h  and 
2h  were approximately equal. As a result we 
have: 
1
0.162

 ; 
2
0.167
h 
 ; 
1

n 
;

. 
 
In this case, the maximum deviation of the calculated values of the desired function from 
its exact values is equal to 
 


max

. 
 
At carrying out the calculations with optimization, at first we put

, 
determine the initial estimate of the values of the desired function, then we determine the 
optimum values of parameters 
1
 and 
2
 and carry out more exact calculations 
corresponding to the obtained values 
1
 and 
2
 and N1000. As a result, we have:

In this case, the maximum deviation of the calculated values of the desired function from 
its exact values is equal to 
 


max
1.018

The calculation time slightly increases at optimization. For the considered case – 
approximately 1.2 times (for example at using Pentium-IV, the calculation time of the given 
example without optimization is equal to 0.13 s, and with optimization – to 0.16 s). 
Thus, the use of optimization leads to a significant increase in the accuracy of the results 
at a slight increase in the time of calculation.

which is approximately equal to the upper bound of the parameter , at which the 
explicit scheme of the diffusion equation solution is stable, is considered as a “standard” of 
the step of digitization of the time; concrete values of the parameter  may be compared with 
0
. The choice of a smaller value of the “standard” accomplishes nothing except for a 
senseless increase in the calculation time. Especially, as it is evident from the further 
discussion the optimum value of the parameter  is much bigger than 
0
.  
The numerical calculations are performed in two ways: without optimization and with 
optimization of choosing the parameter , described in Section 2.6.2. In both cases, the total 
number of nodal points is accepted equal to

The specified values

of the choice of spatial and time steps of digitization in the difference scheme of the diffusion 
equation solution. The algorithm is given below. Thus, in both cases, in the difference 
schemes the values of spatial steps of the grid are identical, and the corresponding algorithms 
are compared with each other only by the effect of the choice of the step of the time 
digitization.  
At carrying out of calculations without optimization, we put 
; the given 
parameter proves to be equal to

different values of

At carrying out the calculations with optimization, at first we adopt

layers with numbers

optimum values of the parameters

calculations for different values of

As is evident from the tables, the use of optimization leads to that the accuracy of 
calculations remains practically the same, and the time of calculations is reduced 
significantly. 
Undoubtedly, there are also other methods of estimation of the parameters

This is the subject of further research, especially, as it is evident from the example, this 
considerably improves the calculation results of different schemes.

2.7. THE EFFECT OF SMOOTHNESS OF THE  
INHOMOGENEOUS PART OF THE DIFFUSION  
EQUATION ON THE ACCURACY OF THE RESULTS 
 
Let the dynamics of propagation of the concentration of polluting substances in some 
section of the river be investigated by means of models described in Paragraph 1.2. The 
considered section of the river contains the point sources of pollution functioning 
continuously or for the limited time interval. It means that inhomogeneous parts of the solved 
diffusion equations contain the impulse functions, which are linear combinations of Dirac’s 
delta-functions. These functions and their derivatives are not bounded. Therefore the 
difference schemes of the solution of diffusion equations are not correct in the vicinities of 
pollution source localization points.

Let us consider the problem of optimum choice of kinds of functions representing a non-
uniform parts of diffusion equation at practical realization of difference schemes [40]. In 
addition as  criteria of optimality, as well as in the previous paragraph, the necessity of 
maximum decrease in the error of calculation is considered. Furthermore chosen  functions 
should be simple enough for realization, and they should  correspond to real physical 
conditions as much as possible. 
For elimination of this drawback, it is necessary to consider a model, in which the delta 
function 

a
x 

 is replaced by the bounded numerical function 


a
x
u
D

,
, where u  is 
the additional parameter. It means that the point sources are replaced by extended ones the 
capacity of each of which has the maximum corresponding to the capacity of the source at the 
point of its localization. Such sources can be named quasi-point sources. 
The function 

x
u
D ,
 must satisfy the following requirements: it reaches the maximum 
value proportional to 
u
/
1
 at the point 
0

x
; it tends to zero at 


x
; its integral 
between the limits 


 and 


 is equal to unit; its plot represents a bell-shaped curve. The 
width of such a curve is naturally defined as the width of the rectangle which height is equal 
to the ordinate of the peak of the curve, and its area is equal to the area of the figure limited 
by the curve and the axis of abscissas. Thus, the parameter u  characterizes the width of the 
plot of the function 

x
u
D ,
, i.e. the sizes of the source. At 
0

u
, the function 

x
u
D ,
 
tends to x

. 
One of the elementary functional dependences satisfying the listed requirements is the 
rectangular dependence: 
 
1/       at  |

However, the use of such dependence in practice is inexpedient, because the result of 
calculation of the values of such a function in the vicinity of the discontinuity point may be 
any of two numbers differing much from each other; this results from inevitable round-off 
errors of the values of the argument of the function. As shows the operational experience, this 
can lead to a curious situation when, for example, the function 

x
u
D ,
 is distinct from zero 
only in one of the cells into which nodal points divide the area X , but the computer program 
also determines nonzero values of this function for the neighbouring cell. Therefore, the same 
source of pollution will be counted twice, and the obtained result will be twice as much as the 
value which it should have. 
It is possible to avoid the similar difficulty by means of using the continuous functional 
dependence for setting of 
x
u
D ,
, for example, it may be the trapezoid dependence:

In fact, the function

 defined by one of the two latter relations plays the part of a 
smoothing function, which allows us to transform any function from

differentiable function by means of the operation of convolution [46].  
If pollution sources do not operate continuous, but for a limited interval of time 
]

then the capacity of each source should be smoothed not only by spatial coordinates, but also 
by time. It means that this function should be proportional to 

T

, where v  is the 
additional parameter, and 


v

 is the function satisfying the following conditions: at

 it tends to unit, and at 


 - to zero. Its plot represents a quasi-stepped curve, 
which steepness is maximum at 
0

t
, and this maximum value of the steepness is 
proportional to 
v

. The parameter v  characterizes the time of diminution of the function of 
discharge. At



 tends to 
x

x

stepped function. In the developed software package (see Chapter 6), there is possible the 
choice of an explicit form of the function 

As shown the results of calculations (see below), the more smooth are the functions of

points of discharge. For given types of function

results increases at increasing of the values of parameters u  and v .

visible in the figures. Such oscillations, in particular, lead to that, at some points in the 
vicinities of the points of discharge, the obtained values of concentration proved to be 
negative, which is absurdity from the physical point of view. 
The Gaussian form of the function

, practically identical plots correspond to rectangular and Gaussian forms of the

x

. 
Considering this fact and comparing the corresponding plots in different figures, it is 
possible to draw the following conclusions: 
 
- 
the accuracy of calculations considerably increases as the values of the source sizes 
divided by the spatial step of the grid increase;  
- 
in the case of relatively small values n , the accuracy also increases at replacement of 
piece-smooth function 
x
u
D ,
 with the continuous-differentiable function;  
- 
the increase in the accuracy of solutions, in particular, leads to smoothing of their 
oscillations. 
 
For the two-dimensional model, the corresponding calculations give a similar results. 
Up to this point we have considered the case when the section of the river has the 
rectangular form, and the diffusion factor, the non-conservatism factor and the velocity of the 
flow are constant in all sections. As a result, the coefficients of the diffusion equation prove to 
be constants. If the river banks are indented, then the coefficients of the equation prove to be 
oscillating piece-smooth functions of spatial coordinates. In the plots, analogous to the ones 
shown in Figure 2.1-2.5, constructed for a section of the river with “saw-tooth” banks, the 
oscillations of the obtained solutions are more considerable, especially in the case of 
relatively small values n . 
The dependence of the accuracy of the solutions of the diffusion equation on the degree 
of smoothness of the coefficients of this equation and its inhomogeneous part can be 
explained as follows. It is known [47] that, if these functions are continuous (even if they are 
not continuous-differentiable), the solution of the equation is a two-time continuous-
differentiable function. However, as shown in Section 2.1.1, the misclosure of the difference 
scheme on which the accuracy of the obtained solution depends, is proportional to the 4-th 
derivative of the unknown function with respect to spatial coordinates for which, under the 
considered conditions, the continuity is not guaranteed at all. If the coefficients of the 
equation are constant, its solution is an infinitely differentiable function, and, hence, the 
accuracy of the calculated values proves to be higher.

STOCHASTIC MATHEMATICAL MODELS DESCRIBING 
POLLUTION OF THE RIVERS 
 
 
The developed by authors methods of identification of statistical models, used at solving 
problems of studying and analysis of the quality of river’s water and different problems of 
many areas of knowledge, are considered in this chapter.   
 
 
3.1. STATISTICAL MODELS OF POLLUTANTS TRANSPORT 
IN THE RIVERS  
 
The identification of statistical models as regression dependences is actual problem of 
mathematical statistics, arising at experimental data processing for quantitative description of 
unknown dependences among observed variables. It has numerous applications in many 
different areas of the science and practice, being irreplaceable means for quantitative 
description of cause and effect relations. Many activities are dedicated to the solution of this 
problem. Among them we shall note the following [1, 44, 45, 48-75, 131]. The problems of 
identification for different regression models are reviewed in these works: classical 
regression, regression at active and passive experiments. The algorithms with taking into 
account the stationarity or nostationarity of random components, presence or absence of 
correlation between them, the robustness of estimations are designed. The methods used in 
each of them are adapted to the features of a concrete problem and, despite of the optimality 
in a considered particular case, are poorly suitable in other conditions. 
 
 
3.1.1. Statistical Models of Propagation of Pollutants in the Rivers 
 
The essence of development of statistical models for description of transport of pollution 
substances in the rivers can be illustrated by such example [1, 76]. Let's split controled water

 and critera of their identification are considered in the algorithms, given 
below in this chapter. Statistical models are widely applied in the problems of simulation of 
the state of water objects due to simplicity, stability to random fluctuations, absence of the 
requirements of deep analysis of passing physico-chemical processes. 
For estimation of the quality of mathematical models, also their comparioson among 
themselves, there are necessary objective criteria of the effectiveness of these models. Such 
criteria are: accuracy of simulation, simplicity and visualization of developed models, 
requirements to the size and quality of necessary measurement information and so on. The 
most essential among them is the accuracy of simulation. The objective estimation of the 
accuracy of the developed models it is necessary to calculate of their quality by independent 
data which do not participate in the identification of models. In [76], as such criterion of 
effectiveness of models, is recommended the value

process. The value RR  is the relative measure of the quality of mathematical model to the 
characteristic of dispersion of real process. It is proportional to the information quantity, 
obtained by model about real process. When the variance of real process is unknown and also 
its estimation is connected to certain difficulties, for comparison of qualities of two models, it 
is possible to use the criterion

, indicated the ratio between root-mean-square 
deviations of considered models [77]. 
Let us concider some, from huge number of existed works, devoted to the development of 
regression models.  
In [51] are given the results of experimental comparison of accuracy of estimations of 
unknown parameters of the model by different methods. There are considered different 
regression models: classical regression, active regression experiments, passive observations. 
These methods are developed at fulfilment of the following suppositions: all variables have 
zero mean, the errors of independent variables do not correlate one another at different 
observations and have identical covariance matrix (in all observation points, errors of 
independent variables do not correlate with the error of dependent variable, errors of 
dependent variable do not correlate among themselves and their variance is equal to 
2

). 
The problems of restoration of polynomial regression with exact values of independent 
variables at varying variance of dependent variable and with random values of independent 
variables at varying variance of dependent variable are considered in [52]. 
The robust algorithm for construction of point and interval estimations of the parameters 
of non-linear models, belonging to the class of internally linear models, i.e. non-linear 
models, which one by the help of transformation of the variables are reduced to the linear 
model, is given in [53]. The case of classic regression with constant variance of the dependent 
variable is considered. 
The problem of obtaining robust estimations of coefficients of regression models is quite 
completely considered in [54, 55, 57]; the problem of restoration of linear regression at 
varying variance of dependent variable by the help of the method of weighed least squares is 
considered in [55]. In [57] is given a very wide range of statistical analysis methods - from 
exploratory analysis to causal inference to multi-level analysis. In particular, there also are 
described hierarchical models with a binary dependent variable. 
In [56] is proposed an intelligent regression analysis methodology which is suitable for 
modeling massive datasets. The basic idea there is to split the entire dataset into several 
blocks, applying the classical regression techniques for data in each block, and finally 
combaining these regression results via weighted averages. Theoretical justification of the 
goodness of the proposed method and empirical performance based on extensive simulation 
study are given.   
Steady autoregression models which are used for imitation of nonstationary, 
monotonically incrasing component in longitudinal data are given in [58]. 
General autoregression model has the following generalized form:

Bayes analysis for factor experiment is offered in [60]. There are given estimations of 
parameters and testing of hypothesis in a posterior analysis, using simple a priory conditions. 
Detailed formalization is realized for two factor models with replicae. Two illustrative 
applications on the basis of which author discuss realizability and representability of a 
posterior distributions, sensitivity and applicability of the methods of Monte Carlo for 
Markov chains are given. 

Stochastic Mathematical Models Describing Pollution of the Rivers 
77
Author of the work [61] uses Monte Carlo methods for discontinuous Markov chains [66] 
with the purpose of calculation of aposeriory distributions of hierarchical, graphical or 
decomposable log-linear models by high-dimensional tables of possible values. The choice of 
suitable prior distributions for the parameters of the model is also discussed in detail, and two 
examples are presented. The authors identify a lot of possible hierarchical, graphical and 
decomposable models and compare the obtained results with alternative approximations. 
In [62] are given answers on the questions: does a regression model correspond to the 
true outlines? Do two regression models have the same outlines? How it is possible to group 
regression functions, based on outlines? These questions appear at investigating 
monotonicity, at calculation of local maximum or at studying variations in the family of 
curves. One can solve these questions by considering the rank correlation coefficient between 
two functions. This correlation is the generalisation of the rank correlation between two finite 
sets of numbers and is equal to one if and only if the two functions have the same outlines. 
The rank correlation based on smoothed estimates of regression functions in reality estimates 
true correlation. This rank correlation can be used as a measure of similarity of functions in 
cluster analysis and as a measure of monotonicity or modality. 
The paper [63] propose a semiparametrical extension of the score method, offered in 
[67], for elimination of the shortage of the parameters. The procedure is developed for the 
cases when there are known the mean and the variance of the dependent variable and when 
average function contains both parameters: of benefity and of disparity. Important 
applications of semiparametric models include quasilikelihood models and models of error of 
the measurement [68]. The second important application is acceptance of the estimations for 
auxiliary functions [69] at solving simple linear systems which correspond to the true 
projection for the family canonical exponential distributions. Asymptotic properties and 
results of simulation show that the influance of peculiarities of the parameters is significantly 
reduced at using offered approach. 
In [64] is realized theoretical research of two estimations of the parameters of partially 
linear model for grouped longitudinal data

[85], i.e. estimations obtained by the second method are asymptotically more effective than 
the estimations obtained by the first method. The investigation of these methods is realized by 
imitative modeling of numerical experiments. 
In [65] is considered the problem of obtaining, with the help of simple and generalized 
methods of least squares, estimations of the parameters of linear regression model

Threshold autoregression models which are non linear models of time series, describing 
sudden changes in time, were considered in [87]. The most important parameters of these 
models are thresholds as they determine their nonlinear structures. Thresholds transform the 
models in different mode of operation, in each of which the structure of the model is linear. 
Hence, if thresholds are known, estimating other parameters, so as coefficients of regression, 
is relatively simple. However estimating thresholds is not simple task because, usualy, their 
number is not known and they are self-changeable points of the structure of the function. In 
[86] are considered the questions of estimating and testing of the thresholds in self-
stimulating threshold autoregression models with unknown number of thresholds. There is 
offered statistical test, based on the empirical small wavy coefficients. There is given 
asymptotical distribution of statistical test and estimation of values of thresholds and their 
quantities. The Monte-Carlo method and real example, for teating realizability of the offered 
method, are used.

3.2. METHODS OF IDENTIFICATION OF NON-LINEAR REGRETIONS BY 
MODIFIED LEAST SQUARES CRITERION 
 
General procedures of identification of non-linear regression relations is offered below, 
which one is developed with the purpose of overcoming two basic difficulties not only 
regression analysis but also all modern mathematics: non-linearity and multidimensionality of 
a problem [73-75]. The universal algorithm of optimum definition of regions of finding of 
unknown values of parameters of regression models, in which these unknown parameters 
with probability close to unit are contained, is developed.  The quality of working and 
obtained results of iteration algorithms of search of extremum of criterion of identification 
depend on successful finding of these regions. Given methods is suitable for the rather wide 
class of non-linear regression models at classical regression and passive experiment and at its 
qualified application, in despite of usual non-linear estimation of parameters, considerably 
reduces the time necessary for solving identification problem and provides the given 
reliability. At some hardening of imposed restrictions on the nature of noises, the obtained 
results are also correct at active experiment. 
The problem of identification of regression dependence is contained in the following. It is 
supposed that between observed variables x  and y  unknown functional dependence exists, 
which is approximated by the function of given class

optimization problem determines statistical estimations

 of the suitable parameters 
(estimation of the method of least squares). 
In case when restored relation is linear with respect to the parameters, searching their 
statistical estimations is not difficult: the problem is reduced to the solution of the system of 
m  linear equations [89]. If the dependence of approximating function on the parameters is 
not linear, then for the solution of the considered problem there are used different iteration 
methods, including, when approximating function

there are used iteration algorithms without using derivatives, including algorithm of Huk and 
Jivce [1, 90]. At application of these algorithms there are some difficulties, related to 
necessisity bound up with necessity of correct selection of the regions of seeking the 
parameters, since from it essentially depends the time of computation and reliability of 
obtained results. 
The noted complexities of using iteration algorithms, at definition of a minimum of the 
functional (3.2), appear the more essential, than more is the number of parameters from which 
f  function depends on non-linearly. A method is offered below, which one often allows to 
reduce the number of parameters, in relation to which the approximating function is non-

The better the value S approximates to S , the less is the value G , which one, from its

In each concrete case the function 

 so that as small as possible number of parameters, by which the functional S is 
minimized, was non-linearly contained in it. 
Finding estimations of the parameters, non-linearly contained in 

g
, realizes by 
minimization of the functional S by different iteration methods. For this methods is 
necessary to determine intervals, from domains of their definition, in which with unit 
probability are contained true values of the parameters. 
Let us designate defined vector of non-linearly entering parameters by 
, 
and search regions of given parameter - by 
. It is supposed that the given region is 
the hyperparallelepiped, bounded by coordinates of vectors 
. For convergence of the 
algorithm, and also for minimization of necessary search time of estimations, the search 
region should be as small as possible; at this time, the probability of including true value of 
 in it should be close to unit. 
One of universal, not dependent from a concrete kind of restored functional dependence, 
methods of definition of intervals of search of estimations of approximation parameters is 
offered below method, which is called method of trials. This method is universal and is 
applicable even when all parameters of the model are non-linearly included in it, i.e. when the 
estimations of the parameters are searched by direct minimization of the criterion (3.2). 
The set of all points

close

At

Some examples, illustrated the essence described modified method of trials are given 
below. The algorithms of identification of some noon-linear functional dependences and the 
results of investigation of their basic properties are given in Appendix 4 [106]. These 
algorithms are developed on the basis of offered in this paragraph modified method of trials. 
In summary we will consider one more modification of described above methods of 
determination of boundaries of parametres of approximation based on use of splines.  
In the trial method and the modified trial method the auxiliary problem of interpolation of 
the restored dependence is used. While, as it is shown below (see Section 3.4), this problem 
often is considerably simplified in the case of equidistant values of argument; it takes place 
for many concrete types of restored dependence containing limited quantity of parameters.  
In such cases it is possible to offer the following method of determination of boundaries: 
if there are given N  values of the investigated function 
jy  in points 
jx , not being 
equidistant from each other (
1,..,
j
N

), then  
 
 
for determination of approximate values of the investigated function in additional 
points the cubic spline ( )
s x  corresponding to available pairs of points [
,
]
j
j
x
y
   
(
1,..,
j
N

), is used;  
 
in the least interval containing all points 
jx , N  equidistant from each other values of 
the argument 
1x, 
2x, ..., 
N
x are determined and approximate values of the 
investigated function in these points 
1y, 
2y, ..., 
N
y; 
(
)
j

 are considered  
(
1,..,


);  
 
boundaries of search of approximation parameters are determined by the the modified 
trial method for N  pairs of points [
,
]
j

For illustration of modified trial method, as examples, we shall consider the following 
functional dependences: a)

. The values of the number and borders of the 
intervals of searching of the parameters of approximation are given in Table 3.3. They are 
obtained by unmodified and modified trial methods. The restored function depends on non-
linearly from these parameters. In each of three cases a)-c), the values of independent variable 
jx  are N  equidistant points from the interval 
min
max
[
,
]
x
x
; residuals 
ju  are independent 
normally distributed random variables with mathematical expectations equal to zero and 
variances

. The tables are composed for different values of

y
y

, where 
max
y
 and 
min

 are maximum and minimum values of the function 
(

, respectively. 
From obtained results is evident that in determined intervals of the search of true values 
of the parameters of the regression in reality are contained these values and the intervals are 
narrowed down at decreasing the mean square deviation of observation results of dependent 
variable of the regression.

The offered above methodology of identification of nonlinear regressions are widely used 
in developed by authors application package of processing experimental information for 
IBM-compatible computers [92-94, 101, 226], in section “Identification of functional 
dependences”. The application of this package at solving many practical problems from 
different domains of knowledge, including modeling pollution of rivers, was demonstrated 
the universality, the regularity and the reliability of the methodology [1, 74, 95-100]. 
 
 
3.3. RESTORATION OF POLYNOMIAL  
REGRESSION ON THE BASIS OF ACTIVE EXPERIMENT  
 
The algorithm of restoration of polynomial regression at varying variances both 
dependent and independent variables is offered below [1, 44]. Optimum properties of the 
offered algorithm are demonstrated experimentally. The polynomial regression finds broad 
application at restoration of functional dependences between observed quantities. Moreover, 
in considerable part of measurement devices, the restoration of calibration curves are realized 
on the basis of active experiment (for example, graduation of spectrometers of the energy of 
gamma-quantums, graduation of the spectrometer for the measurement of nuclear emission 
with inductively related plasma etc. [53]). 
 
Development of the algorithm. Polynomial regression at activ experiment looks like

Unfortunately, direct use of the algorithm (3.23), for calculation of estimations of 
coefficients of polynomial regression, is impossible, as the same coefficients are included in 
it. Therefore, the search of the coefficients is realized in two steps. On the first step, 
estimations of the coefficients are calculated by the formula (3.22), at supposition that 
ix  are 
nonrandom values. Weigh coefficients are determined as follows 






. On the second 
step, by the help of estimations of unknown coefficients, obtained on the first step by the 
formula (3.23), in which the suitable weights are determined by the ratio (3.21), 
approximations of unknown coefficients are iteratively calculated until the norm of the 
difference between vectors of coefficients of neighboring approachs will not be less than a 
given value. 
For illustration of properties of the algorithm (3.23) and its advantages by comparison 
with the algorithm (3.22), below are given the results of experimental investigation of these 
algorithms for concrete regression dependence

. Reduced in Figure 3.3-3.6 
dependences confirm the fact that the varience of restored regression decreases at increasing 
the number of observations in calibration points and it increases at increasing the variances 
both dependent and independent variables. 
Non monotonicity of the suitable dependences from the number of repeated observations 
for dependent variable (see Figure 3.3) are determined by randomness of obtained 
estimations. From Figure 3.6, it is seen that for each concrete regression there is optimum 
length of the region of its definition. Curves in Figure 3.5 confirm reduced above results 
about optimum choice of values of independent variable. From dependences, the fact of 
advantage of the algorithm (3.23) by comparison with the algorithm (3.22), is obvious. The 
results of operation of the algorithm (3.22) are designated by 
1

3.4. INTERPOLATION OF NONLINEAR  
FUNCTIONS OF CERTAIN CLASS 
 
The problem of interpolation of nonlinear functions arises at solving many different 
problems of sciences and practice. For example, at restoration of nonlinear functional 
dependences by the data, do not cantaned random errors; at solving approximation problems 
by methods of spline-analysis (see paragraph 1.4); at determination of initial intervals of 
domain of parameters in problems of identification of nonlinear regressions (see paragraph 
3.2) [1, 108] etc. Therefore, the development of optimum algorithms of interpolation of 
nonlinear functional dependences and their investigation are actual problems, having wide 
practical application. 
Algorithms of interpolation of one-parameter families of functions from polynomials and 
some nonlinear functions are given below. These functions are very often used at restoration 
of functional dependnces in many practical applications. These algorithms are used by 
authors in developed by them universal program package of processing experimental 
information for PC-compatible personal computers in section of restoration of functional 
dependences for finding optimum initial intervals of definition of unknown parameters of 
these dependences [1, 93, 94, 110] and at solving many practical problems concerning to the 
identification of regression models of pollutants transport in the rivers.

At the fixed value .  
 
For justification of Formula (3.27) it is enough to notice that the system of equations 
(3.29) at 
1,...,

N

 represents conditions of interpolation for the polynomial assuming 
given values in given points. According to conditions of the problem determinant of the given 
system of equations is nonzero, whence univalentity of its solution follows.  
For derivation of formulas (3.28) let's remark that system (3.29) represents the system of 
1

Natural domain of definition of the function

function ( )

If 
1u  and

f b  since in these intervals the function 
( )
f b  is monotone. But in the interval 
1
(

u

the function 
( )
f b  does not become zero owing to that it monotonically tends to zero at 
b . There remain two intervals

u u
 and 
2

u , one of which contains solution 
of the equation

f b 
 equal to zero, and the second one can contain nonzero solution of 
this equation if only on the boundaries of this interval the function ( )
f b  has different signs.  
Further all is obvious.  
After that the parameter b  is determined, the parameters a , c  and d  are determined by 
relations

In both cases it is possible to appropriate to the parameter s  the initial value equal to

inequality will be executed.  
 
b) Algorithm of determination of zeros. The offered below algorithm of determination of 
zeros of the function

3.5. CONSTRUCTION OF CONFIDENCE INTERVALS FOR 
MATHEMATICAL EXPECTATIONS OF RANDOM VARIABLES 
 
At solving many theoretical and applied problems, the broad applications have 
confidence intervals for parameters of probability distribution laws of the investigated 
phenomena. The quality of the confidence interval is determined by its width for the given 
coefficient of confidence. There are three basic methods of finding confidence intervals [102] 
which are based: 1) on the frequency theory of probability; 2) on fiducial distributions; 3) on 
the theorem of Bayes. The first method uses the asymptotic normality of the first derivative of 
the logarithm of likelyhood function. According to the theorem of Wilks, for large sampls, 
this method gives shortest on the average intervals for the certain class of distributions [102] 
(hereinafter we shall call this method classical). The second method uses fiducial 
distributions, corresponding to the considered distribution. In the third method, the bounds of 
the confidence interval are established on the basis of a posteriori distribution of probability 
of the considered parameter. 
  One of methods of determination of a confidence interval for mathematical expectation 
of a random variable below is offered, founded on utilization of serial statisticses [1, 111, 
112]. As against above described, this method does not demand the knowledge of other 
parameters of distribution laws (for example, variance at a normal probability distribution 
law) at construction of a confidence interval of mathematical expectation [113].

Let us consider the case when the graph of the distribution density of the variable x  
forms the trapezoid with the axis of abscissa, the divisionof the lengthes of upper and lower 
bases of which is equal to . Such kind of distribution we shall call generalized trapezoidal. 
The parameter , it is clear, satisfys the inequality

If it computs by summation of the hypergeometric series then at big N  the error of 
computation could be big, as neighbouring items of this series have different signs and their 
absolute values are considerably big than the sum.  
In Figure 3.9 and 3.10 are given the dependences of the length of the confidence interval, 
computed by classical and above brougth methods, respectively, on the sample size at fixed 
variance of observation results and on standard deviation at fixed size of sample for normal 
distribution. In Figure 3.11 and 3.12, 3.13 and 3.14, also 3.15 and 3.16 are given the 
analogous dependences, for lognormal, triangular and uniform laws of probability 
distribution, respectively.  
The computation of the length of one value of the confidence interval is realized by 
averaging triple computation of its value on the basis of three independent sampls of 
necessary sizes for given parameters. 
From these dependences it is seen that for normal, lognormal and triangular distributions 
the classical method gives the best result. For the normal distribution this must true in 
accordance with the theorem of Wilks [102], since in this case the likelyhood function is 
distributed normally. For the uniform distribution, the offered method, in which the

 is calculated by probability distribution laws of the random variables, 
gives much best result, than classical method. If draw the graphs, similar to the shown in 
Figure 3.9 -3.16 for generalized trapezoidal distributions at different values of the parameters 
, it is possible to reveal that at 
4.0

classical.

Thus, the offered method, except of simplicity of computation, gives the best result than 
the classical method for the construction of the confidence interval of mathematical

from normal. 
 
 
3.6. IMITATIVE MODELING OF FORMATION  
OF THE QUALITY OF SEWAGES 
 
The formation of quality of natural waters is rather complex problem. Among the 
numerous factors, stipulating their condition, it is necessary to single out industrial flows. In 
order to protect natural waters from the pollution by industrial lfows, they build expensive 
refining facilities and systems of monitoring of sewages. The efficiency of capital investment 
depends on the optimality of the accepted designing solutions, in particular, from the 
calculation of powers of refining facilities, from the rational selection of the equipment of 
monitoring and, also, from the quality of made decisions in the process of exploitation of 
refining facilities, from maximum application of their capabilities. For the successful solution 
of these problems, the large value has the knowledge of the process of formation of the 
quality of sewages, the ability to predict its development in time with taking into account all 
possible critical situations, arising in the process of operation of the enterprise [114]. 
Imitative models of formation of the quality of sewages enable to predict the quality of 
sewages in dynamics, depending on the given operational mode of the enterprise, not 
breaking a normal mode of its operation. The following initial information is necessary for 
their making [1]: the detailed scheme of inter disposition of pollution sources, connected by 
sewer system of the given enterprise; water expense for each pollution source and the 
concentration of dropping ingredients in all possible technological modes of operation; 
working models of transportation of polluting ingredients on considered section of sewer 
system; the kind and the character of the random component of the pollution process for 
sources of droppings. 

Karlos J. Kachiashvili and D. Y. Melikdzhanian 
132 
Imitative models of formation  of quality of sewages, except of indicated, enable us [1]: 
to control indirectly the activity of autoanalyzers of the water quality by comparison of 
simulation results and measured values of the same parameters; at temporary disabling any of 
measurement channel to fill the gaps in measurements of the given parameter, to calculate 
concentrations of controled ingredients in an uncotroled point of water object in accordance 
with the conditions of dropping of sewages by pollution sources (it allows to reduce up to the 
minimum the necessary number of measurement facilities, necessary for the control of water 
object with the given reliability); to calculate Maximum Allowable Discharge (MAD) for 
objects of pollution with the purpose of the maintenance of concentrations of controled 
ingredients in bounds of maximum allowable concentration (MAC); to predict concentrations 
of controled ingredients in a given point of water object depending on the conditions of 
discharge of sewages by dropping sources; to find out sources of emergency pollution; to test, 
to coordinate and to optimize of technical, informational-program and mathematical supports 
of the developed automated quality monitoring system of the natural water, which 
considerably increases the efficiency of such developments and reduces up to minimum the 
time for their introduction in real object. 
In order to unify algorithms and programs, imitative models should be developed by 
modular-modulus principle with optimum separation of functions among the blocks, 
permitting to imitate different processes of pollution by the rearrangement of the order of the 
fulfilment and minimum replacement of developed blocks. 
The existence in imitative models of the following basic blocks seems to be expedient 
[1]: generation of the technological operational modes of pollution sources, i.e. generation of 
the block of control; realization of mathematical models of the transport of pollutants in the 
water; generation of multidimensional stochastic processes, having the given nature; 
generation of random numbers by the given probability distribution law. 
Developed by the author of the present book imitative model of the pollution process of 
the sewage of Odessa Nitrogen Factory is given below [1, 115]. The simulation of pollution 
process is considered on the example of the most typical segment of the factory, for simplicity 
of presentation. In Figure 3.17 is given schematic view of the modeled segment of Odessa 
Nitrogen Factory. Here directions of arrows, connecting pollution sources (S1, ...,S5) and an 
autoanalyzer of water quality, correspond to the direction of the stream of water;

As almost any real process, the formation of the quality of sewages is a dynamic and 
stochastic system. As dynamic mathematical models of transportation of pollutants in water 
there are used the models which are taking into account only processes of the dilution and a 
self-purification [116]:

that it is also suitable for the data of the pollution of water. Realized by us investigation by 
natural data of Odessa Nitrogen Factory and the river Kura has confirmed this supposition. 
Therefore in offered below models, the stochastic component of concentration of

sources are two, and both either drop given quantities of pollutants or do not drop. The drop

The result of the work of the block, reduced in Figure 3.22, for one unit of time pass, are 
elements of 
-dimentional random vector 
 For their definition, the 
coefficients 
 
 
 
 
, with the 
help of auto- and intercovariation functions, are calculated. Because of the stochastic 
component of the concentration of pollutants is quasi-stationary, the values of auto- and 
intercovariation functions are necessary to re-calculate periodically. Accordingly, it is 
necessary to re-calculate unknown coefficients, and during stationarity of the process, it is 
necessary to use their earlier calculated values. With this purpose the elements of the set IND 
are used, which take on two values (0 or 1) depending on the necessity of recalculation of 
unknown coefficients. Normally distributed random numbers are used in simulation, which 
are calculated by simple transformation of standard, uniformly distributed random numbers 
generated by standard generator of pseudo-random numbers (see Appendix 1, 2, 3). 
The developed simulation models were used for generating measured values of controled 
parameters of sewages of the factory. On the basis of this information, the software of the 
automated quality monitoring system of these waters was tested and optimized [1, 118, 119]. 
 
 
3.7. SIMULATION OF REAL MULTIDIMENSIONAL STATIONARY 
GAUSS-MARKOV SERIES WITH GIVEN DEPTH OF CONNECTIVITY 
 
As a rule, the stochastic component of the process of formation of the condition of the 
environment approximates by Gauss-Markov series due to its limiting properties [83, 117, 
120]. The exhausting information about Markov processes are adduced in the works [121-
123]. As the objects of the environment are multydimensional with statistically inter-related 
parameters, we shall bound by consideration of the simulation of multidimensional Markov 
series. One-dimensional Markov series are their particular case. 
The simulation of multidimensional random series by computers is widely used at solving 
many applied problems. The methods of group simulation of inter-correlated time series are 
considered in the works [122, 124-125]. The methods of simulation of multidimensional 
Gauss-Markov series with single depth of connectivity is offered in [125, 126]. The problem 
of not equidistantness of the simulated results is automatically solved in it; the problem of 
selection of initial conditions becomes almost trivial, it excludes the transition process and the 
possibility of using of all elements of the simulated sequence. The method of the 
autoregression with integrated moving average (MAIMA) is described in the work [124]. The 
limitedness of the method is the following: it supposes the identity of conditional and 
unconditional distributions of the random series. Except for the described methods, in [122] is 
adduced the more general linear regression method at simulation of equidistant realization of 
multidimensional Gauss-Markov series. Its advantage is also in sufficient simplicity and 
convenience of realization of this method by comparison with other methods. 
All these methods of simulation of random series imply the availability of certain a prior 
information: multidimensional distribution function or spectral density, the vector of 
mathematical expectations and covariance function and so on, which one, as a rule, is given 
as observation results, by which the unknown characteristics of random series estimate. The 
errors made in estimations influence the accuracy of simulation results.

Let us consider now the general case, when in the model (3.39), the current values of the 
modelled series are allowed. At such case, the expressions (3.50), (3.51) take the forms,

 with given probability for the general case of the model (3.39). It 
is necessary to note that the estimations (3.50), (3.51), (3.54) do not depend on the time 
parameter, i.e. the error of simulation of multidimensional time series is determined by the 
error of calculation of the matrices 
p
B  and 
p
C , the elements of which are the values of 
covariance functions, and also by conditionality of the matrices 
p
B , by the norms of the 
vectors

p

, by the residual variance

p

 of the modelled series, by its dimensionality and 
the depth of connectivity. Therefore, before of beginning the simulation of the 
multidimensional series it is necessary, by the ratio (3.54), to estimate 
R
 - the error of 
calculation of values of covariance functions, ensuring the given error of simulation. 
By taking into account the error of calculation of the residual variance of the modelled 
series, the absolute error of simulation (3.47) takes the form:

divergent. The negativity of the calculated value of the variance by the ratio (3.41) means that 
Gauss-Markov series with given characteristics can not be modelled by the model (3.39).

METHODS OF MAKING DECISIONS IN MONITORING 
OF RIVER POLLUTION 
 
 
One of the basic sections of stochastic mathematics is the theory of decision making 
[132]. The given chapter is dedicated to problems of elaboration of new methods of making 
decisions in the systems of monitoring and control of pollution of objects of the environment. 
In particular, it is dedicated to the problem of acceptance of statistical hypothesis by results of 
experiment, founded on one of the classical approaches - the Bayesian approach [133]. 
Mathematical base of making decisions in recognition problems is the theory of games 
and, particularly, one of its concrete branch – the theory of statistical decisions, which one 
can be interpreted as the theory of acceptance of the optimum decisions on the basis of trials. 
The basic results of the theory of the statistical decisions were obtained by Wald [134, 
135]. Detailed study of the fundamentals of this theory is contained in the monography of 
Blackwell and Girshick [136], in the work of Lehmann [137]. The special attention is given to 
Bayesian criterion in the works of Wald, Blackwell and Girshick. Complete theory of 
statistical decisions is factual contained in these monographies. Fundamental aspects of 
classical theory are set forth in monographies of Wilks [138], Rao [139], Kendall and Stuart 
[102], De Groot [140], Cramer [141], Zacks [142], Aivazjan, Yenyukov and Meshalkin [143] 
etc. 
There are different classical criterions of testing hypotheses depending on selected 
criterion [102, 136-142, 144-149]: the Fisher’s criterion, the criterion of Neyman-Pearson, 
sequential criterion of Wald, Bayesian criterion, maximum of posterior probabilities, 
maximum likelihood criterion, mini-max test etc. A lot of works in theoretical and applied 
statistics are dedicated to the synthesis of optimum rules of making the decisions [146, 148–
165, 166–175 etc.]. However, in despite of variety of the works dedicated to the problem of 
statistical hypotheses test and, in particular, to Bayesian test, no one of these works do not 
consider Bayesian problem of many hypotheses testing from such point of view as in the 
works of the authors [1, 133, 176-182]. Some results of the author from these works are 
generalized in this chapter and a number of more perfect algorithms of their solution are 
designed. For the first time there are entered two loss functions allowing to pass from an 
unconditional optimization problem to a conditional problem which one allows by imposing 
of restrictions on probabilities of errors of the first and second kind to introduce a loss 
function indirectly when a priori it is difficultly to make [133, 183].

4.1. GENERALIZATION OF BAYESIAN RULE OF  
MANY HYPOTHESES TESTING 
 
The essence of the problem of statistical hypotheses testing may be formalized in the 
following way [133]. Let us consider n  independent identically distributed random quantities 
nx

1
, 
which 
have 
joint 
probability 
distribution 
density

experiment x  results. The assumption that parameter a  belongs to set

k

 is 
called “a statistical hypothesis” and is denoted by letter 
i
H . If set 
iA  consists of only one 
point, the hypothesis is simple, otherwise 
i
H  is a composite hypothesis. Hypothesis testing 
problem consists in accepting of one hypothesis out of the given set of hypotheses 



,
,...,
S

 on the basis of experimental results, so as to minimize the criterion 
defining the error probability. 
There are different methods of statistical hypotheses testing [102, 133, 137, 142]. Among 
them, the Bayesian approach has a special place. A generalization of Bayesian rule of many 
hypotheses testing is given below. It consists in increasing of decision rule dimensionality 
with respect to the number of tested hypotheses, which allows one to make decisions more 
differentially than in the classical case and to state, instead of unconditional optimization 
problem, conditional one that enables to make guaranteed decisions concerning errors of true 
decisions rejection, which is the key point when solving a number of practical problems. 
These generalizations are given both for a set of simple hypotheses, each containing one 
space point, and hypotheses containing a finite set of separated space points. 
Generally, when the hypotheses contain some spatial points and thus one and those points 
can enter into different hypotheses, the task of testing multiple hypotheses on a basis of the 
Bayesian approach looks as follows.  
Let 


1,...,

 are true. It is necessary to separate values of these true parameters. 
                                                           
1 The assumption of independence at normal probability distribution is not a rigid restriction, as by linear 
transformation of the vector of correlated normal random quantities, it is not difficult to obtain the vector of 
non-correlated random quantities. Performing of preliminary decorrelation does not affect hypotheses testing 
results, so called “information discrepancy of hypotheses” does not change in case of non-degenerate 
transformation [184].

4.2. GENERAL SOLUTIONS OF UNCONDITIONAL  
AND CONDITIONAL BAYESIAN TASKS 
 
The presented statement is generalization of the classical Bayesian problem of many 
simple hypotheses testing, as the latter is obtained from the above-described statement, when 
the number of points in hypothesis 
i
H , 
1

M
. Besides, unlike the classical statement, 
where dimensionality of decision function is equal to the number of tested hypotheses, in this 
statement the decision is made more differentially regarding not the hypotheses as a whole, 
but parameters that form these hypotheses. Therefore, decision rule dimensionality N  
exceeds the number of hypotheses S . This enables to impose restrictions on probabilities of 
falsely made decisions in more flexible way. 
Let us consider the case, when none of the hypotheses pairs contain common points. The 
set of hypotheses in this case is:

4.3. ALGORITHMS OF SOLVING UNCONDITIONAL BAYESIAN

Let us introduce algorithms of implementation of hypotheses testing rules (4.6) of 
unconditional Bayesian problem. For simplicity of representation, let us consider the case 
when none hypotheses pairs has common points, i.e. the case when function of risk looks like 
(4.3). 
Let us consider different cases of loss function

For its computation let us use Monte-Carlo method. Calculating time needed for this 
method depends on dimensionality of the integral. In hypotheses testing problem, as a rule, 
the number of tested hypotheses S  is considerably smaller than dimensionality of the vector 
of measured values m , as only a small number of most likely hypotheses is left for 
hypotheses testing after initial processing. Therefore, to reduce the time needed for 
computation of integrals (4.27), we do the following.

This enables to reduce substantially the time needed for the probability integral 
computation, when it considerably differs from 0.5. 
For calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix 
1

V
, matrix V  is required to 
be positively definite. A correlation matrix is always positively definite. Therefore, it is 
necessary to go over from covariant matrix V  to the correlation one by normalizing the 
elements of matrix V . Let us show the changes entailed by going over to the correlation 
matrix, when calculating integrals (4.31) by Monte-Carlo method.

Thus, for computation of integrals (4.31), it is necessary to simulate normally distributed

S 
-dimensional random vector z  with mathematical expectation 
iB and correlation 
matrix W , and if this vector satisfies (4.37), to consider that we are in the domain of 
integration and to increase the value of  by one. 
Let us give another more reliable from computational point of view, way of computation 
of integrals (4.27). By ''reliable'' we mean that, in this case, no inversion of covariant matrices 
and finding of their eigenvalues and eigenvectors is required. 
Let us rewrite hypotheses testing regions (4.25) in the following way

4.4. ALGORITHMS OF SOLVING CONDITIONAL BAYESIAN  
PROBLEM OF MANY SIMPLE HYPOTHESES TESTING 
 
One of generalizations of the classical statement of Bayesian problem of many 
hypotheses testing given in paragraph 4.1 consists in the solution of conditional optimization 
problem instead of unconditional one, which enables to make guaranteed decisions with 
respect to errors of true decision rejections. Below, the general solution of conditional 
Bayesian problem at restrictions on the averaged probability of omitted true parameters is 
brought up to the computational algorithms for the most common in practice, normal 
distribution of probabilities of measurement results. 
As an example of elaboration of algorithms of the decision of conditional Bayesian task 
of test of many hypotheses let us consider the task (4.9), (4.14). The solution of this problem 
is (4.15). Let us consider the case when measurement results 
m

 are distributed 
normally, i.e. looks like (4.21). Subject to (4.21), hypothesis 
i
H  acceptance region (4.15) 
may be rewritten in the following way

The integral values entering into

When solving practical problems, the following non-trivial situations are possible. When 
hypotheses are near to each other, the situation shown in Figure 4.1(a) may take place. This 
means that it is impossible to make decision in this situation with the specified power of 
. And when the measurement result falls into the interval between 
 and 
, it is 
impossible to make one decision. In that case, it is necessary to decrease power of criterion 
 until hypothesis acceptance regions are separated. The criterion power will be equal 
to the value to which correspond non-intersectional regions. 
On the other hand, when hypotheses are separated from each other, the situation shown in 
Figure 4.1(b) may take place. This means that, when the measurement result falls between 
1 
and 
2
, it is impossible to make a decision. In this case, it is necessary to increase power of

 until the measured value is found in one of the regions of hypothesis

4.5. SOLUTION OF UNCONDITIONAL BAYESIAN PROBLEM AT 
NUMBER OF HYPOTHESES EQUAL TO TWO 
 
The finding of optimum regions of hypotheses testing in unconditional and conditional 
Bayesian problems of testing many hypotheses and computation of suitable values of risk 
function is connected with complex problem of repeated computation of multidimensional 
probability integrals on the regions of complex configuration in iterative process of finding 
unknown Lagrange coefficients. The problem is considerably simplified if number of 
hypotheses

S 
. In this case, the finding of optimum regions of acceptance of hypotheses 
and computation of risk function is possible analytically. Therefore for those cases, when as a 
result of working of an algorithm of formation of hypotheses, the number of formed 
hypotheses is equal to two, below is offered simple algorithm.  
In this case, risk function (4.3) is of the following form:

4.7. QUASI-OPTIMAL METHOD OF  
MANY-HYPOTHESES TESTING 
 
Finding of regions of acceptance of hypotheses in conditional Bayesian problem of 
hypotheses testing and calculation of the corresponding values of a risk function is the 
difficult task requiring of iterative calculation of multidimensional normal integrals on the 
integrating areas of the complex configuration [133, 183]. At the solution of practical 
problems often it is necessary to have the simple, not optimum decision rules no requiring of 
large computer and computing resources for their calculation.  
Such quasi-optimal algorithms for solution of problems (4.8), (4.10), for intersectional 
and for non-intersectional hypotheses are given in [133]. Let us consider solution of problem 
(4.9), (4.14). 
For solution of problem (4.9), (4.14), let us consider

4.8. RATIO OF VALUES OF THE RISK-FUNCTIONS  
IN PUT PROBLEMS AND THEIR 
NUMERICAL RESEARCHES 
 
Analysis of relations of mean risk values corresponding to the stated conditional 
Bayesian problems is given in [133]. It is shown there that the mean risk value calculated for 
problem with restrictions (4.16) is always greater than the mean risk value calculated at 
restrictions (4.13), and the mean risk value at restrictions (4.10) is between the previous two 
values. The mean risk value calculated at restrictions (4.18) is always not greater than the 
mean risk values at restrictions (4.16). 
It is a fact that the mean risk value in unconstrained problem of many hypotheses testing 
is always lesser than the mean risk value calculated in conditional problems, and the mean 
risk value corresponding to quasi-optimal rule of hypotheses testing is always not less than 
the mean risk values corresponding to conditional Bayesian problems. This fact is a 
consequence of rigidity of restrictions corresponding to these problems. Really, 



1
 at 
number of hypotheses 
2
S 
, and for unconditional problems there are no restrictions at all. 
To demonstrate this fact, relations of mean risk values calculated for unconditional, 
conditional and quasi-optimal problems of hypotheses testing, depending on information 
distance between tested hypotheses, are shown in Figure 4.2. The problem with restrictions 
(4.13) is taken as unconditional Bayesian problem, since the minimum mean risk value 
among all the conditional Bayesian problems corresponds to it. 
To illustrate the above-stated, the following simple example is taken: the number of 
hypotheses 
5

m 
; coordinates of hypothetical 
points in initial state -

 and

and quasi-optimal problems of hypotheses testing, correspondingly. The first point on axis of 
abscissas corresponds to initial values of hypothetical points, the second point corresponds to 
the changed coordinates of the fifth hypothetical point 
5

a (5; 4); to the fifth point - changed 
hypothetical points

a (2; 4), 
4
a (6; 1), 
5
a (5; 6). 
Figures 4.3 and 4.4 show the mean risk of unconditional tasks plotted against the variance 
of measured parameters and the information distance between hypotheses, correspondingly. 
Calculations were made for the above given example. The figures illustrate the logical 
dependence of mean risk of variance of parameters and the information distance between 
hypotheses and confirm the fact of dependence of mean risk values, i.e. of quality of made 
decisions, on valid choice of penalty function. At differential choice of penalty function, 
mean risk value considerably diminishes as compared with the step loss function, when the 
price of any error is one and the same and doesn’t depend on the extent of its roughness.  
Let us give some results of the developed algorithms testing for conditional Bayesian 
rules. Calculations were made for the above given example. Figures 4.5-4.7 show 
dependencies of the risk function on: variance of measured parameters; information distance 
between tested hypotheses and probability of correct expecting of hypotheses, 
correspondingly. The figures illustrate the logical dependencies of the risk function on these 
parameters, i.e. the risk function increases with increasing of the variance of measured para-
meters, the risk function decreases with increasing of the information distance between tested 
hypotheses and the risk function, i.e. averaged probability of true decisions rejection, 
increases with increasing of the probability of making true decisions.

This chapter is dedicated to a problem of acceptance of the statistical decisions by results 
of experiment, founded on one of the classic approaches - the Bayesian approach. In it is used 
as the classical Bayesian formulation of a test of hypothesis encompassing by definition of the 
decision rule with the help of unconditional minimization of a risk function, so the new 
approach encompassing by definition of the decision rule by the solution of a problem of 
constrained optimization of a risk function at miscellaneous limitations on probability of 
acceptance of the incorrect solutions concerning the verity of hypothetical values of 
distribution parameters. The generalization of classical Bayesian formulation of test of many

hypotheses encompassing that the dimension of the decision rule and quantity of tested 
hypotheses do not coincide is made. In the given statement the solutions are born more 
differentiated, concerning not of hypotheses as a whole, but of each tested parameter. The 
classical Bayesian statement is a particular case of such statement, as at not intersected hypo-
theses, i.e. in a case, then they do not contain common parameters, the above-mentioned 
statement coincides with classical statement. Besides in the chapter are given the quasi-
optimum rule of test of many hypotheses. Are determined the optimum decision rules in all 
put problems of test of many hypotheses for a density of distribution of probability of a 
general view. These decision rules are rendered concrete up to working formulas and 
algorithms for such relevant distribution from the application of probability theory and 
mathematical statistics, what the normal distribution of probabilities is. At development of 
these algorithms some problems having independent concern are resolved. Such, as calculus 
of a multidimensional normal integral on area of the composite configuration by 
approximating these areas or by decomposing integrand density by the way of series, 
decreasing of dimension of a multidimensional normal integral without a loss of information. 
The outcomes of an experimental research of designed algorithms are adduced. 
The solution of many practical problems from miscellaneous areas of science and 
engineering under the contents and the object in views demand the approach, the essence 
which one is encompass in usage of the above-stated decision rules of test of many statistical 
hypotheses. For illustration we shall bring below some examples of technical problems at the 
solution which one will be used in the given chapter obtained outcomes.  
For control of condition of environmental objects, there are created the automated 
controlling systems, consisting from analyzers automatically measuring controlled parameters 
of an environment and transmitting their values to the Control Station by communication 
channels, where on the basis of processing of this information on the computer, the solutions 
on a condition of controlled object are born [1]. The problem of control of condition of an 
environment includes a problem of identification of emergency pollution sources for taking a 
step on their elimination. For the solution of this problem in question of making the decision 
there is used the above-stated algorithms which are realized in software “Identification of 
River Water Pollution Sources by  Means  of  Automated Control Systems” developed for 
IBM-compatible computers in the project G-047 of ISTC (International Science and 
Technology Center) (1998-2000) (see Chapters 5 and 7). The conditional approach of test of 
many hypotheses was utilized with the purpose of restriction of probability incorrectly 
accused in pollution of pollution sources, at minimization of probability of non-detection of 
the true initiators of pollution. 
Designed rules of test of many hypotheses also can be successfully applied at problem 
solving of detection and tracking of objects, driving in space, on the basis of the radar 
measuring information [133, 186]. At detection it is required to minimize a probability of 
incorrectly detected objects at restrictions on probability of the failed true objects.    
Above offered algorithms also can be used in seismology for solution of a problem of 
detection of geomagnetic surges stimulus source by results of measurement of several seismo-
logical stations. Also can be successfully used in pharmacology at manufacturing of poison 
keeping drugs for minimization of probability of no dosage at limitations of an over dosage 
especially dangerous for health of the people of components.

MATHEMATICAL BASES FOR SOLVING  
PROBLEM OF IDENTIFICATION OF THE  
SOURCES OF EXCESSIVE RIVER POLLUTION 
 
 
5.1. ESSENCE OF IDENTIFICATION PROBLEM 
 
One of the actual tasks of environmental condition monitoring problem is that of 
identification of the emergency release sources to take measures on their elimination. This 
task is especially actual for city conditions, because the large number of pollution sources 
doesn’t allow to control each of them. The solution of this task has not only an ecological, but 
a significant economical effect as well, which is reached by means of minimization of 
technical faculities, in particular, the measurement facilities needed for the stand-alone 
control of each pollution source. This task is also actual for large factories and plants with 
biochemical purification of waste water in order to identify those sections of shops which are 
guilty of waste water pollution over the norm (see section 3.6) [1, 179, 187]. 
In spite of such actuality this task is not solved in general form till present and previous 
works of the authors, though a lot of authors note its great importance for solving the problem 
of monitoring of the pollution of environmental water objects [189, 192-197]. In this chapter 
are described algorithms, developed by authors, for identification of emergency pollution 
sources in rivers between two controlled ranges by means of automated systems [180, 182, 
188, 180]. In chapter 7 is described the software of realization of these algorithms for IBM-
compatible computers [93, 94]. 
The developed program package for identification of emergency release sources may be 
included into any available or newly developed automated system for control of water object 
pollution level. The system is shown on Figure 5.1 as an illustration diagram. Some of 
developed under the guidance of one of the authors of this work the automated systems are 
described in [1]. The number and the types of water objects, for which the developed program 
package may be used, are limited by the mathematical models of pollutants transfer, included 
into the library of the developed package. The library is of open type, i.e. newly developed 
models may be included into it and thus the list of water objects for which this package is 
suitable can be expanded.

5.2. FORMALIZATION OF THE PROBLEM 
 
Let’s consider the problem of identification of the river water pollution sources located 
between two controlled ranges by means of automated systems [1, 187]. The proposed 
algorithms are built with the assumption that the pollution sources have either different 
composition of waste water or (at the same composition) different ratios of ingredients. 
Let the river water condition be controlled by M  automated stations on the section 
under consideration. Each of the stations controls m physicalchemical parameters. Let’s 
denote the water quality index at the j -th station, i.e. in the j -th controlled range of the 
river at Nt  moment, by

5.3. GENERALIZED BLOCK-DIAGRAM FOR  
SOLVING IDENTIFICATION PROBLEM 
 
For visualization of inter-consistency and sequence of fulfillment of separate problems in 
Fig. 5.2 is given the generalized block diagram of solving the problem of identification of 
emergency release sources. The arrows indicate the execution sequence of programs for the 
marked problems and the directions of information flows. To realize the problem of 
identification of emergency release sources it is necessary to solve, in accordance with the 
sequence indicated by the arrows in Figure 5.2, the following tasks: decorrelation of the 
vector of measured values (DVMV); formation of different combinations of pollution sources 
(FDCPS); calculation of hypothetical concentrations of pollutants in the lower controlled 
range according to mathematical models (CHCP); formation of hypotheses concerning 
emergency pollution sources (FH); calculation of a prior probabilities of the formed 
hypotheses (CPP); making a decision on the guiltiness of sources in the emergency pollution 
(MD).

In the library of mathematical models described the processes of the transport of 
pollution substances in rivers there are realized mathematical models and algorithms of their 
calculation described in Chapters 1 and 2, and in the library of the methods of making a 
decision concerning guilty in emergency dropping there are realized Bayesian methods and 
algorithms of testing many hypotheses described in Chapter 4. For simplification of the 
procedure of making decision there are described algorithms of cluster-analysis in section 5.6.  
 
 
5.4. ALGORITHM OF HYPOTHESES FORMATION 
 
The total number of m -dimensional points, which suppose different 
combinations of uncontrolled objects to be emergency release sources, at exhaustive 
search of all possible variants, is 
1
2

R
, where m is the number of parameters 
being measured, R  – the number of uncontrolled objects. For real values of m  
and R , to perform necessary computations for such a number of variants within 
practically acceptable period of time is impossible, even on modern powerful 
personal computers. It is necessary to develop an algorithm, allowing a significant 
reduction in the amount of searching of different combinations of uncontrolled 
objects, but still providing that the remained combinations would include the true 
combinations of uncontrolled objects. The algorithm given below allows to reduce 
significantly the exhaustive search of necessary variants and to solve the problem 
of identification of the sources of excessive pollution within practically acceptable period 
of time. 
Let the i -th uncontrolled object release some 
i
m  parameters out of m  
parameters controlled by the analyzer in the j –th range. Let pollution by some 
m
n 
 parameters be registered in the j –th range at 
Nt
 moment. Then, from the 
total number of uncontrolled objects R , are chosen only those objects 
R
R 
1
, 
which release n  parameters. 
Let 

ini
i
x

 denote the set of parameters released by the i -th uncontrolled 
object, 
m

R

; 

ini

 – the parameters exceeding the allowable 
limit of concentration (ALC) in the j –th range. Then, only those objects, for 
which 

 will remain as suspected in the emergency 
release. Let’s denote the number of such objects by 
R
R 
1
. 
Only n  parameters exceeding the allowable limit of concentration will be used 
for making decision on pollution sources, as the other parameters will be non-
informative for the problem under consideration. 
Thus, the number of parameters is reduced to 
1n , and the number of the 
objects suspected in emergency release – to 
1
R .

Only concentrations of

models. The parameters are calculated independently.

Those S  populations of uncontrolled objects, which fell into this set while

Concentrations of those parameters out of m, which were not calculated when

received m-dimensional points will constitute S  hypotheses, which must be tested 
for making the final decision.

If the objects have several emergency modes, each emergency mode will be recognized 
as a new object. Thus, the total number of uncontrolled objects R  will be equal to the 
number of all emergency modes of the uncontrolled pollution sources. 
After formation of hypotheses concerning guiltiness of sources of the emergency 
pollution, i.e. after defining the set of points of mathematical expectation of measurement 
vector, the a prior probabilities of hypotheses, corresponding to the chosen points of 
mathematical expectation, are found in the following way.

5.6. DECORRELATION OF THE MEASURED VALUES VECTOR 
 
According to the note made in paragraph 4.1, preliminary decorrelation of a vector of the 
measured values does not influence results of testing hypotheses. As components of a vector 
of the measured values of controllable components of river water, generally, are correlated, 
for direct use in Chapter 4 given algorithms in the process of making decisions concerning 
guilt in emergency pollution, there is preliminary carried out decorrelation of a vector of 
measurements [126, 133, 191].

5.7. ALGORITHMS OF CLUSTER-ANALYSIS FOR IDENTIFICATION OF 
EMERGENCY RELEASE SOURCES 
 
Depending on the available a priori information it is possible to consider different 
procedures of testing hypotheses (5.3). In process of increase of a priori information there is 
possible to use more complex procedures of making decision providing higher reliability (see 
Chapter 4). In those cases when a priori information is unknown or the probability 
distribution law of the vector of measured parameters (
)
x tN  is unknown or when operative 
obtaining the decision even lower reliability is necessary, the procedure of making the 
decision is based on the distance between points (

That uncontrolled objects or populations of uncontrolled objects to which corresponds the 
minimum distanced , is considered to be the pollution source. Algorithms making decision 
based on the distance d  refer to the algorithms of cluster analysis. In case, when, during the 
emergency release, one and the same object may release different concentrations, they should 

Karlos J. Kachiashvili and D. Y. Melikdzhanian 
192 
be considered as releases from different uncontrolled objects, and the algorithms making 
decisions should be used. 
Depending on the chosen measure of the distance d  there is a large number of the 
algorithms of cluster analysis [see, for example, 198 – 200, 201 – 209].   
Two simple algorithms of cluster analysis are given below based on the distances of 
Euclid and Makhalanobis. They are realized by authors in the package of identification of 
emergency pollution sources of rivers (see Chapter 7) side by side with Bayesian algorithms 
described in Chapter 4 [182, 187, 188].  
Veracity of the decision made in this algorithm depends on the noise level

In the absence of covariant matrix of the measurement vector (

distance is used as a distance measure

The advantages of this method are: simplicity of its realization and minimum of a priori 
information needed. However, even if a priori information is available, it is impossible to use 
it in this case. All pollution sources in this procedure are equally dangerous. That is why it is 
preferable to use Bayesian algorithms of making decision, described in chapter 4, free of 
these disadvantages. 
The described algorithms of the cluster analysis were used in the realized problem of 
identification of the shops guilty of emergency pollution of sewage of Odessa nitrogen 
factory in the computer-aided monitoring system of quality of sewage of this factory which 
has been developed and introduced at factory in 1985 – 1988 under the guidance of the 
authors of the given book. In the problem of identification as mathematical models (see 
paragraph 5.2) simulation models of formation of quality of sewage of this factory, described 
in paragraph 3.6, were used.

SOFTWARE OF MATHEMATICAL MODELS OF 
POLLUTANTS TRANSPORT IN RIVERS 
 
 
6.1. ASSIGNMENT AND POSSIBILITY  
OF THE PACKAGE 
 
The description of the applied program package created by the authors for realization of 
mathematical models of pollutants transport in rivers is given in this Chapter [226]. It is 
designed an up-to-date as convenient reliable tool for experts in different fields of knowledge 
(biology, ichthyology, ecology, hydrology, building, agriculture etc.), allowing them to 
calculate the polluting substance concentrations at any point of the river depending on the 
quantity and the conditions of discharging from several pollution sources. As the 
mathematical models of water quality formation in the river under the influence of several 
pollution sources, spatially one-, two- and three-dimensional advective-diffusion models at 
different initial and boundary conditions (see Chapter 1) are realized in the package: a) an 
advectivediffusion equation with non-local boundary condition at the end of the controlled 
section with account for the coefficient of natural selfpurification of the river; b) an advec-
tivediffusion equation with boundary condition of full mixing at the end of the controlled 
section; c) an advectivediffusion equation ignoring the vertical advection with non-local 
boundary condition at the end of the controlled section with account for the coefficient of 
natural self purification of the river; d) an advectivediffusion equation ignoring the vertical 
advection with boundary condition of full mixing at the end of the controlled section; e) a 
diffusion equation with non-local boundary condition at the end of the controlled section with 
account for the coefficient of natural selfpurification of the river; f) a diffusion equation with 
boundary condition of full mixing at the end of the river controlled section. For the 
abovementioned mathematical models, there are use computation schemes described in 
Chapter 2.  
In the package there are the options of inputting and editing the initial data describing the 
geographical, geometrical and hydrological features of the simulated section of the river, the 
condition and the specific features of pollution of the river, the quantity and the name of the 
pollutant of interest, the types of used models and restrictions, the ways of assignment of 
these data etc. There are the options of choosing the language of dialogue with the package, 
the conditions of computation realization, the desirable accuracy of computation, the type and

format of output of the results. At any stage of working with the package, there is an option of 
help concerning the methods which are realized in the package, the capabilities and specific 
features of the package, the parameters of tasks and obtained results. 
 
 
Figure 6.1. Sections of main menu of the package. 
The choice of these possibilities is carried out by means of appropriate options from the 
commands of the main menu of the package. The main menu includes the following 
commands and options (see Figure 6.1): File (Page setup, Printer setup, Exit), Tools 
(Language, Model, Save options, Autosave), Coordinates (Type of coordinates, Banks and 
bottom, Flow velocity, List of objects, Objects, Convert files), Water parameters (List of 
substances, Upper cross-section, Capacities of sources, Coefficients of diffusion, Coefficient 
of non-conservatism, Coefficient of decreasing), Run (Accuracy, Calculations) and Help 
(Contents, Algorithms). The desirable language of dialogue with the package and the type of 
diffusion equation are selected directly from two pull-down lists. The description of purposes 
and capabilities of these options is given below.  
 
 
6.2. INPUT AND EDITING OF THE INITIAL DATA  
 
The input of information necessary for operation of the package is performed in the form 
of separate constants, tables or the choice of the appropriate line from the pull-down. Let’s 
adduce the substantial description of this information.  
The data, which are not represented as tables. In the list given below, some 
parameters are common for all sections of the river, and some are specific for the chosen 
section; the latter are marked by the sign “d” in square brackets. The parameters marked by 
the sign “n” in square brackets are not saved in files.

6.3. MANAGEMENT OF WORK OF THE SOFTWARE 
 
6.3.1. Description of the Files used in the Software 
 

Karlos J. Kachiashvili and D. Y. Melikdzhanian 
202 
Purpose of the basic files of the software. The enumerate below files are necessary for 
run and work of the software. Either these files or the folders specified before their names 
should be placed in one main directory (folder).  
 
mdinare.exe is the file running the software;  
 
mdinare.num and mdinare.str are the binary and text files containing parameters of 
work of the software which are read out at its running; both of this files change at 
performance of the command Save options or (in the case of switched on the option 
Autosave) at exit from the software (see 6.3.4); if these files are absent they are 
created automatically, thus values of parameters by default are established;  
 
mdinare.dir is the text file containing full names of data files which are 
automatically loaded into tables of data editing for each task at opening of 
corresponding forms (initial loading); in the case of switched on the option Autosave 
it changes at exit from the software; if this file is absent it is created;  
 
*.dic are the files-dictionaries serving for translation of text messages from English 
(see 6.3.2);  
 
*.add are the auxiliary files necessary for use of dictionaries; if they are absent they 
can be created at performance of the command Language from the main menu (see 
6.3.2);  
 
*.hlp and *.pdf are the files containing the help information in different languages; 
the files sample.hlp and sample.pdf contain the help information in English;  
 
mdinare.bmp is the graphic file used by the software;     
 
\Fonts\ *.ttf are fonts used by the software; they are loaded into system at running of 
the software and unloaded at end of work of the software.  
 
Syntax of used text files. The files mdinare.str, mdinare.dir and *.dic may be created 
or changed by means of any text editor. Thus these files delivered together with the software 
may be used as samples for their creation.  
The file mdinare.str contains the following 3 lines (in view of the order of their 
arrangement in the file): 1) name of the chosen language (for example English, Russian, 
Georgian, etc.); 2) full name of working directory (for example C:\MSG\River\Data); 3) full 
name of the file running the program Acrobat Reader (for example C:\Program 
Files\Adobe\Acrobat5.0\Reader\Acro Rd32.exe).   
Syntax of the file mdinare.dir is determined by the following rules:  
 
 
each line of this file contains names of the files concerning a specific target of input 
of initial data used in the software; it is necessary to watch not mixing numbers of 
lines in this file;  
 
if any line of this file contains a blank the part of this line following this blank is 
considered as a comment and is not used by the software;  
 
each line of this file or (at presence of a blank in it) the part of this line before the 
comment should contain one name of a file or several names of files separated by a 
semicolon ”;”, in the latter case different files concern to different editing windows 
on one form.  
 

Software of Mathematical Models of Pollutants Transport in Rivers 
203
The files mdinare.str and mdinare.dir may be created or changed also during work of 
the software. Unlike them files-dictionaries *.dic may be created or changed only by means 
of a text editor.  
Syntax of files-dictionaries is determined by the following rules: if M  is the number of 
translated words and sentences then for each value 
1
,...,
0


M
k
:  
 
 
the line of this file with number 
1

k
 contains a word or sentence in English which 
is necessary for translating;  
 
the line of this file with number 
2

k
 contains the same word or sentence which 
was translated into chosen language;  
 
the line of this file with number 
3

k
 is not used and may contain any comments.  
 
Data files. Structure of a data file is determined by its extension in conformity with the 
following rules:  
 
 
First symbol of the extension always is ’$’; 
 
Second symbol of the extension is the first letter of name of type of the data which is 
written in the file; the letters ’b’, ’i’, ’w’, ’l’, ’s’, ’d’ correspond to the types byte, 
integer, word, longint, single, double;     
 
 
Next symbols of extension determine the number N  of columns of the table 
reserved for entered values; thus the real number of columns of the table which is 
visible on the screen at editing of data can be less N .  
 
If extension consists of three symbols then third symbol of extension is the letter of 
the Latin alphabet which serial number (beginning from ‘a’) is equal to the number 
N . 
 
If extension consists of four symbols then last two symbols of extension should form 
hexadecimal representation of the number N ; in this representation the letters ’z’, 
’a’, ’b’,..., ’o’ carry out a role of the digits having values accordingly 0, 1, 2... 15.  
 
A text file or RTF–file containing a note (see 6.3.3) may correspond to each data file. 
 
 
6.3.2. Working Language 
 
The working language of the package is the language in which all text messages will be 
displayed. A list of languages is determined by the existence of files-dictionaries, serving for 
translation of the messages from English, in the main directory. The user can add new or to 
remove the existing files-dictionaries (their total number should not exceed 16). 
For translation of text messages by the program, in the main directory, there should be a 
file with the name coinciding with the name of chosen language (Russian, Georgian etc.) and 
having the extension .dic (for example georgian.dic), containing a dictionary of translated 
lines, and also a file with the same name and with extension .add (for example 
georgian.add). For representation of the help information in the chosen language, in the main 

Karlos J. Kachiashvili and D. Y. Melikdzhanian 
204 
directory there should also be a file with the same name and with extension .hlp (for example 
georgian.hlp) or a file with the same name and with extension .pdf (for example 
georgian.pdf), containing this information. 
The working language can be chosen from the list on the ToolBar or by means of the 
option of the main menu Language (see Figure 6.2). In the first case, accessible languages 
are those for which there are both files – with extensions .dic and .add. In the second case, 
the presence only of the file with extension .dic is enough; thus the auxiliary file with 
extension .add is created by pressing the button Create. 
The file-dictionary with extension .dic can be created or changed as it is described in 
6.3.1 and is given in Help of the package. At each change in this file, it is also necessary to 
create the corresponding file with extension .add in the way described above. 
 
 
6.3.3. Help Service and Notes 
 
In the software help information of following types are used:  
 
 
help in a status line: in the moment of moving of the cursor of a mouse above some 
visual components (sections of menu, buttons, editing windows, etc.) a short 
information about these components appears in the Status Bar and in emerging 
label;  
 
display text from help files: it is carried out by means of commands of traditional 
section of menu Help;  
 
call of the context-dependent information: in the software as well as in all Windows-
programs pressing of the key F1 causes information for that mode in which is the 
program in that moment.  
 
The general form of the initial format Help is shown in Figure 6.9. 
 
 

Software of Mathematical Models of Pollutants Transport in Rivers 
205
Figure 6.9. 
The reference to “help” is not recommended during performance of the program i.e. 
when calculations are being done in the program.  
In all tasks in which initial data are read out from files or any data files are created (in 
particular they are tasks of data input in tables) the possibility of viewing and editing of notes 
that is any text corresponding to the used data file or, if there are several such files, to first of 
them is realized. The file containing a note has the same name and the same directory as 
corresponding data file and one of the following extensions – .tex, .txt, .rtf depending on its 
type.  
Call of the editor of notes is carried out by the command Help|Notes. During editing of 
the file containing a note its type can be changed. 
 
 
6.3.4. Parameters of the Package  
 
The change in the value of each parameter is carried out with the help of standard 
Windows components which allow editing the text, choosing the line from the list, setting the 
indicator etc. 
At working with each form containing the main menu, the assignment of parameters is 
carried out with the help of commands of the main menu from the groups File, Tools and 
Parameters. Most important parameters could also be determined with the help of the 
components located on the ToolBar. 
It is possible to split the parameters used in the package into several groups, which are 
considered below. 
The main parameters of the package which are not used in calculations: 
 
 
Sizes of pages for printing out; they are changed with the help of the option 
File|Page setup (see Figure 6.10); 
 
Working language (see Item 6.3.2); 
 
Working directory is the directory where data files are looked up at choosing them; it 
changes at each change of a folder in standard dialogue windows for opening and 
saving the files. 
 
These parameters are read from the files mdinare.num and mdinare.str at running of 
the package (see Item 6.3.1). The option of the menu Save options records the values of 
parameters changed during the operation of the package in this file. The item of the menu 
Autosave contains the indicator which, in the switched-on state, provides the record of 
changed values of parameters in the files mdinare.num and mdinare.str at exiting the 
package. 
The parameters of the package which are used in calculations and are not 
represented as tables: they are the parameters listed in paragraph 6.2. The parameters which 
are not marked by the sign ‘n’ in this list, as well as some parameters of the previous group, 
are read from the file mdinare.num and can be saved in this file. 

Karlos J. Kachiashvili and D. Y. Melikdzhanian 
206 
The type of the model, the type of the algorithm, the number of sections of the river and 
the number of polluting substances are changed by means of the option of the menu 
Tools|Model in the main form of the program. 
The type of coordinates is changed by means of the option of the menu 
Coordinates|Type of coordinates in the main form of the program. 
The number of polluting sources in each section is changed at editing the tables “List of 
objects”.  
The parameters determining the accuracy of calculations are changed by means of the 
option of the menu Parameters|Accuracy in the form of the task “Calculations”; the 
parameter n  also is changed by means of the option of the menu Run|Accuracy in the main 
form of the program. 
Other parameters are changed by means of the option of the menu Parameters|Task 
parameters and Parameters|Additional parameters in the form of the task “Calculations”, 
and also in the dialogue windows which appear on the screen before running of this task. 
The parameters of the package which are used in calculations and are represented 
as tables: they are sequences of the same elements, which are entered in tables and are saved 
in separate files (see Item 6.3.5). The data of the considered type which have been saved in 
files are used in calculations. The concrete tables of initial data used in the package are 
described in paragraph 6.2. 
The parameters of setting of the printer are parameters of Windows, which, in 
particular, are used by the package; they are changed by means of the option File|Printer 
setup (see Figure 6.10).  
The parameters determining the type of the diagram at representation of 
computation results (see paragraph 6.4). 
 
 
6.3.5. Data Input and Editing  
 
The entered data which form sequences of elements of the same type are represented in 
the form of tables. When there are several editing windows with tables on the screen, 
different windows correspond to different sections of the river. 
There are the possibilities of entering the data which have not been recorded anywhere, 
reading data from files and saving them in files by means of commands File|New, File|Open, 
File|Save, File|Save as, File|Save all standard for the text and graphic Windows editors (see 
Figure 6.11). 
The option File|Send records the data in a text file. The option File|Print performs 
printing of the table. 
The data files have quite a simple structure (see 6.3.1) and can be created outside of this 
package. 
The data of the package presented in the form of a table can be entered and edited by 
means of a mouse and a keyboard. There are the possibilities changing, deleting or adding the 
symbols into the record of the element; deleting or adding new elements in the necessary 
place; selecting a block of data; moving or copying the selected block to a new place;

There are two operating modes with a table of data – the mode of editing of cells and the 
operating mode with blocks. In the first mode, it is possible to edit the text in each cell of the 
table, but it is impossible to select a block from several cells. In the second mode, on the 
contrary, it is possible to select the block from several cells (for copying, removal, insertion 
etc.), but it is impossible to edit the text. 
The switching between these modes is carried out by the button Edit on the ToolBar.

6.4. REALIZATION OF COMPUTATION AND  
REPRESENTATION OF THE RESULTS 
 
The package uses curvilinear coordinates of the points of the river banks and polluting 
sources at solving the diffusion equations. Therefore, if the user has chosen Cartesian 
coordinates for data input, all these Cartesian coordinates should be transformed into 
curvilinear ones. Such transformation is carried out by the command of the main menu of the 
main form Convert files (see Figure 6.3). 
The algorithms and analytical methods are used at solving the diffusion equation. They 
are described in Chapters 1 and 2. For realization of two-dimensional and three-dimensional 
models, one of the two algorithms may be used depending on user’s choice:  
1) The classical algorithm in which the difference equation for layers is equivalent to a 
system of N  linear equations for N  values of unknown function at nodal points; this system 
is solved by the iteration method; 
2) The algorithm in which the solution of two-dimensional or three-dimensional diffusion 
equation is represented in the form of a linear combination of solutions of some one-
dimensional diffusion equations. 
As the experience shows, the second algorithm can be realized by computer much more 
quickly then the first one. 
The method of calculations is also determined by some other parameters listed in 
paragraph 6.2. 
The results of calculations are displayed in the form of text messages, tables, graphs, etc. 
For example, the formats of display of computation results as diagrams and tables are shown 
in Figure 6.12 and 6.13, respectively.

The option Print carries out printing of the text and/or the diagram. 
The option Send text carries out writing of the text in the file name of which is 
determined by default or indicated by the user. The user can choose one of the following 
types of files: file LaTeX (tex-file), a simple text file, text file MS DOS. If the saved file 
already exists on the disk, the user can also set the way of writing of the text by means of the 
indicator “Preserve existing text”: to add a new text to the available one or to remove the 
available text from the file. 
It is also possible to single out the text represented on the screen and, by means of 
combinations of keys Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V, to move it to the edited document Word or to the 
document of any other editor allowing to work with the text in the RTF format. 
The option Send graph carries out writing of the diagram into the file the name of which 
is determined by default or indicated by the user. The user can choose one of the following 
types of files: Metafile (wmf-file), Enhanced Metafile (emf-file), Windows Bitmap (bmp-
file) or JPEG (jpg-file). The user can also set the type of figure which will be drawn in a file 
– black-and-white or coloured, by means of the indicator. 
 
 
Figure 6.13. 
The listed options are called from the main menu or by means of fast buttons of the 
ToolBar, duplicating the corresponding items of the main menu. 
The results of calculations together with some initial data are split into groups, which are 
represented on the screen in various windows. By calling the options Print and Send text, the 

Karlos J. Kachiashvili and D. Y. Melikdzhanian 
210 
user can select which of the existing groups of data he wants to print or to write down in a 
file. 
In the task “Calculations”, it is possible to choose the mode of representation of the 
graph or the table: to represent the graph with a coordinate grid or without it, to increase or to 
decrease the thickness of lines of a graph, to increase or to decrease the scale of data 
presentation in the graph, to set the standard or maximum size of the window containing the 
graph and the table. The parameters determining the view of the screen are changed by means 
of the command of the menu Parameters|Graph view or by means of some components on 
the ToolBar.

SOFTWARE OF IDENTIFICATION OF THE SOURCES OF 
EXCESSIVE RIVER POLLUTION 
 
 
7.1. APPOINTMENT OF THE PACKAGE 
 
The package of applied programs of identification of emergency pollution sources of 
surface or sewage water created by authors is described in the offered chapter. Despite the 
urgency the considered problem, as far as we know, is solved by authors of the present work 
for the first time. They possess publications in which the given problem is theoretically 
proved and solved [1, 182, 187, 188, 210, 221]. The urgency of the given problem is noted in 
publications [192-197]. For detection of initiators of emergency pollution of sewage of 
Odessa nitrogen factory among possible five shops, the simple algorithms based on a method 
of the cluster analysis and using the elementary model, considering only transfer and dilution 
of polluting substances in sewage (see paragraph 5.2), have been developed and introduced in 
the automated monitoring system of sewage of factory under the guidance of author of the 
given work. 
The developed package is intended for automatic identification of sources of emergency 
dumping in the rivers between two controllable ranges. It is realized for IBM- compatible 
personal computers in operational systems MS DOS and WINDOWS. The description only 
WINDOWS-version is given below. 
Presence of such package is rather actual for solving the problem of objective control and 
acceptance of optimum decisions for the purpose of management of processes of formation of 
quality of river water and water use. For demonstration of its urgency it is enough to notice 
that work on creation of the given package is executed within the project G-047 ISTC 
(International Science and Technology Center), based by USA, Japan and the countries of 
EU. The basic result of the work is the solution of principle of most important task of the 
problem of monitoring of river water and working out of original working algorithms and the 
unified computer software for certain set of types of water objects and pollution processes. 
The technique realized in the package, methods of the solution of problems, algorithms 
and programs of their realization are original, belong to authors and have not analogues. In 
particular, the algorithms of identification based on methods of the cluster-analysis and the 
theory of acceptance decisions, used depending on the volume of the available a priori 
information, by increasing of which it is possible to apply more complex procedures of 

Karlos J. Kachiashvili and D. Y. Melikdzhanian 
212 
acceptance decisions, providing higher reliability, are developed. For latest case, i.e. in the 
presence of the sufficient a priori information, there are developed optimum (iterative) and 
quasi-optimum (analytical) algorithms of identification of emergency pollution sources of 
river water (see Chapter 4). Mathematical models of transferring polluting substances in the 
rivers taking into account their features and specificity of sources and pollution processes are 
created. In particular, one-, two- and three-dimensional diffusion models of transferring 
pollutants at different initial and boundary conditions depending on specificity of formation 
of quality of water stream (see Chapters 1, 2, 3). The quantitative estimations are obtained, 
allowing to define borders of action of the developed models depending on features of the 
water stream, the characteristic of polluting substances and the form of their dump (see 
Chapter 8). 
 
 
7.2. POSSIBILITY OF THE PACKAGE AND ITS APPLICATION 
 
The necessary initial information characterizing geographical and hydrological features 
of the considered section of water object, form and pollution process of this section from 
natural and artificial pollution sources is introduced in the package; methods of solution on 
the basis of afore-named features of water object and final goals for which achievement the 
given problem is considered are chosen and at occurrence of a situation of emergency 
pollution, by starting of the given package, the set of the most probable sources of this not 
authorized pollution is automatically found out. 
The input information for the developed package are: quantity of pollution sources and 
their spatial co-ordinates, spatial co-ordinates and the list of measured parameters on which 
the river control is carried out, the name and concentration of dumped substances by pollution 
sources in normal and possible emergency operation of functioning, the characteristic of 
features of the river and conditions of descent of sewage. Besides the aforesaid, service 
functions of input-output, editing, graphic representation of output data are realized in the 
package. There is a standard access to each program of the package (the detailed description 
is given in the instruction of the user in Help). All these functions are realized in the given 
package similarly to corresponding functions of the package of mathematical models of 
transportation of pollutants in the rivers, described in Chapter 6. Therefore here it is not 
resulted their detailed description. The names of the options realized in the package for 
introduction of input information and calculations are shown on Figure 7.1. They basically 
are similar to corresponding options of the previous package, except the options “Prelim. 
calculations” and “Decision making” of the section “Run” of the basic menu. The form of the 
format of the option “Decision making” is shown on Figure 7.2. The choice of a method of 
making the decision from described in Chapter 4 and in paragraph 5.7 is carried out in this 
mode. 
The graphic form of output information of the package on which on the scheme of the 
considered section of the river by red points are specified pollution sources of the given 
section by considered parameter is resulted on Figure 7.3. Among all pollution sources 
brightly red colour allocates the sources, guilty of emergency pollution. The list of all 
pollution sources with indication of the made decision about its guilt is given in the bottom 
right corner: Non guilty (it is not guilty), Guilty (it is guilty) and Controlled (supervised). 

Software of Identification of the Sources of Excessive River Pollution 
213
Along to each object two figures are specified: the first – number of the considered section of 
the river, the second – the serial number of object of pollution within the considered section. 
It is not guilty means that the given pollution source is not emergency polluter in the 
considered situation, it is guilty means that the given pollution source is emergency polluter 
in the considered situation and controllable means that sewage of the given source of 
pollution are supervised directly ahead of dump in considered water object and there is not 
any uncertainty concerning its role in the process of pollution. The table of the generated 
hypotheses concerning guilt in emergency pollution of sources of dumps with indication of 
corresponding concentrations of the considered component of pollution is given in the bottom 
left corner. 
Capacity of work of the software was tested in the diverse modes of operation; the 
received results confirm stability and reliability of algorithms and also high accuracy of 
computed values (see Chapter 8 (paragraph 8.2)).

There is the possibility of the choice of a language of dialogue with the package from the 
set of the languages realized in it. Besides for WINDOWS version, the user can, without 
special efforts, independently to add any, him interesting language to languages of dialogue 
with the package. For this purpose extremely simple instruction is given in Help. Concerning 
these possibilities see description of the previous package in Chapter 6. 
It is necessary to underline especially that the offered package (as well as previous) is 
completely original as all algorithms, programs, texts, graphs, drawings, tables, designs etc. 
realized in this package, are original, belong to authors, and have not analogues.

INVESTIGATION OF DEVELOPED  
ALGORITHMS AND PROGRAMS 
 
 
The results of experimental research, developed in Chapters 1 and 2 algorithms and 
appropriate programs, included in computer packages and described in Chapters 6 and 7, are 
given below. The results of research of algorithms of calculation  of concentration  of 
polluting  substances in the rivers with the help of diffusion equations and also  sensitivity  of 
models  of different dimensions to the geometrical sizes of a section of the river and  
dependence  of quality  of identification of emergency pollution sources on the level of the 
noise, deforming  results of measurement, are considered. The results of calculation of 
distribution of concentration of polluting substances in some rivers of the Western Georgia 
are reduced. By means of  computer modelling mid-annual  quantities of some polluting  
substances which have got on certain sections of the rivers of r. Khobistskali’s (Western 
Georgia) basin, between control sections  from  sources of pollution operating  on these 
sections, and  the mid-annual quantity of these  substances brought by them to Black sea are 
calculated. 
The results of research of algorithms of making decisions, developed in Chapter 4, are 
brought in the end of the same chapter in paragraph 4.6. They show truth and reliability both  
the created algorithms and programs of their realization. The results  of research of 
dependence of quality of algorithms of identification of emergency pollution sources from the 
level of the noise, imposed on the results of measurement, are reduced in the present chapter.  
 
 
8.1. STUDY OF ALGORITHMS FOR CALCULATION OF POLLUTANT 
CONCENTRATIONS IN RIVERS BY MEANS  
OF DIFFUSION EQUATIONS 
 
The program system for numerical realization of the problems of pollutants transport in 
water flows consist of three main parts: 1) the programs realizing one-dimensional problems; 
2) the programs realizing two-dimensional problems; 3) the programs realizing three-
dimensional problems. 

Karlos J. Kachiashvili and D.Y. Melikdzhanian 
216 
The programs were mainly developed on the base of finite-difference algorithms 
described in Chapter 2. For some problems of a specific character, the analytical method was 
used. 
The main program modules used in all the parts are: 1) the program realizing the run 
method – the factorization method; 2) the program for solution of two- and three- dimensional 
implicit finite difference equation; this program is based on the Gaussian-Zeidel iterative 
method. 
Testing of the program system was carried out for specially selected test problems. 
Numerical experiments were carried out in order to detect mechanical errors made during 
algorithmic presentation or programming; to test the robustness against the initial data, the 
accuracy of the results obtained, and the calculation time; to compare different algorithms, 
etc. 
Particular attention was given to carrying-out of computational experiments in the case of 
pollution sources of a special type (an instantaneous point or stretched source), oscillations in 
solutions of equations at peculiarities in the initial data, etc. 
The numerical experiments gave the following results: 
 
1) In the case of classical one-dimensional problems, certain computational capabilities 
were shown by the purely implicit scheme and the Crank-Nicolson scheme; in the 
case of special loads, it is preferable to use the purely implicit scheme, but in the case 
of smooth initial data – the Crank-Nicolson scheme. 
2) In the case of non-classical boundary conditions (non-local conditions), the used 
finite difference algorithms showed the same capabilities as in the classical case. 
3) In the two-dimensional case, the experiments were carried out on the base of the 
parallel calculating decomposition schemes and the two-dimensional implicit scheme 
as well as the two-dimensional Crank-Nicolson scheme; in terms of the calculation 
time, the decomposition scheme is more preferable; it should be noted that the 
paralleling feature of decomposition schemes was not used in the calculation; in 
terms of the accuracy, in the case of smooth initial data, the best capabilities were 
shown by the Crank-Nicolson algorithm with the use of the Gaussian-Zeidel iterative 
process, which quite agrees with the theoretical studies. 
4) In the case of non-classical two-dimensional problems, the experiments were only 
carried out by means of the decomposition schemes; in this case, all the theoretical 
predictions concerning the used algorithms were confirmed. 
5) When compared with each other, the used three-dimensional algorithms showed the 
same features and capabilities as the corresponding two-dimensional algorithms. 
Certainly the increase in the dimensionality of the problem affected the possibility of 
increasing the accuracy of calculations; the same holds true for the case of non-
classical (non-local) initial-boundary problems. 
 
To verify the above mentioned in Appendix 5 are given the graphs of realization of some 
specially selected tests. These tests are based on the exact solutions of the corresponding one-, 
two- and three- dimensional equations. By their character, the tests represent two types of 
solution classes: smooth non-oscillating functions and oscillating functions. Comparison of 
the presented graphs shows the influence of these features on the accuracy of calculations.

It should be noted that the exact solutions are shown on the graphs by points, while the 
approximate solutions – by full curves. For multidimensional cases, the graphs for different z 
and y are given in one and the same figure. For calculation, were used the tests described 
below.

8.2. COMPLEX TESTING OF THE DEVELOPED PACKAGE 
 
8.2.1. Sensitivity of the Models of Different Dimensionality to Geometric 
Sizes of the River Cross-Section 
 
It is known from the hydrology of rivers that, if one of the geometric sizes of the 
considered river section exceeds the other more than ten times, the latter may be neglected in 
computations as it does not affect the calculation results [5]. For checking this fact by means 
of the developed models, we calculated the transport of pollutant concentrations for different 
geometric sizes of the considered river section. There are seven pollution sources located

along the river section. The discharge points of these sources are located uniformly on the 
diagonal of the river section. The resultant concentration was calculated for the middle point 
of the lower cross-section of the controlled river section for different pollution sources 
separately. The diffusion coefficients are 
2.0

, non-conservative

K
. The cross-section area and the average river flow velocity in the lower 
cross-section were changed in accordance with the river width and depth at equal flow rates. 
At the river geometric sizes: length – 1000 m, width – 90 m, depth – 3 m, the one-, two- 
and three-dimensional models gave absolutely similar results. 
At the river geometric sizes: length – 1000 m, width – 150 m, depth – 3 m, two- and 
three-dimensional models gave similar results, different from those of the one-dimensional 
model. 
At the river geometric sizes: length – 1000 m, width – 150 m, depth – 50 m, all the three 
models gave different results. 
From these calculations, the following practical recommendation concerning the use of 
the developed models may be given. If geometric sizes, locations of pollution sources, 
hydrologic characteristics and pollution conditions of the river are such that full mixing of 
water takes place upstream of the lower controlled section, then it is enough to use the one-
dimensional river models, which are considerably faster and require less computer memory 
than the models of greater dimensionality. Otherwise it is necessary to use the models of 
greater dimensionality. 
When choosing a working model for a concrete section of a certain river, it is necessary 
to perform preliminary studies with due regard for the above factors. The proper choice of the 
model and its parameters ensures the qualitative modeling and identification of excessive 
discharge sources. 
 
 
8.2.2. Dependence of the Identification Quality on the Noise Level 
 
To illustrate the proper functioning of the developed program package for identification 
of river water pollution sources (see Chapter 7), let’s consider the following example [210]. 
There are five uncontrolled and two controlled pollution sources between the

and the j -th controlled sections. River water quality indices in these ranges, noise variance

- the maximum allowable 
concentration (MAC) of the i -th ingredient in the j -th section. The concentrations of 
chlorides, sulphates and ammonia nitrogen exceed the corresponding MACs, which shows 
that the pollution exists in the j -th section. The following characteristics of the river and 
pollution processes are taken: length, width and depth of the river – 1000 m, 50 m, and 3 m, 
respectively, i.e. the river within the considered section is one-dimensional by its nature. 
Therefore, the identification is carried out by means of the one-dimensional models. The 
diffusion and non-conservativity coefficients for pollutants are 
2.0

x
K
 and 
0

K
, 
respectively. The cross-section area and average river flow velocity in the lower cross-section 

Karlos J. Kachiashvili and D.Y. Melikdzhanian 
222 
are 150 
2
m
 and 1/3 
/
m s , respectively. The pollution sources are located along the 
considered river section at equal intervals, i.e. the interval between them is ~125 m . The 
duration of discharge from each source is an hour.  
For the lower cross-section measurement vector given in Table 8.1, hypothetical 
combinations of excessive pollution sources given in Table 8.2 were chosen. Of course, the 
change in the measurement vector involved the change in the hypothetical combinations of 
excessive pollution sources. 
Table 8.3 gives the identification results obtained by means of different algorithms of 
making decision at generation of five measurement results with identical variances according 
to the following formula

. For testing of the conditional and un conditional algorithms of testing 
hypotheses when the number of hypotheses is equal to two, the number of hypotheses was 
artificially reduced to two by choosing those two hypotheses that are the closest to the 
measurement point. The results of computations show that, at noise variances given in Table 
8.1, all the algorithms give true decisions (the 
1
H  hypothesis in the considered case) in 
100% of the cases. As the noise variance increases, the number of falsely made decisions 
increases. The conditional Bayesian algorithm of many-hypotheses testing works best of all, 
next is the unconditional Bayesian algorithm. 
The power of the hypotheses testing rule in the conditional and quasi-optimal Bayesian 
algorithms is 
95
.0
1


. As the noise variances increased, the mean risk values calculated 
in the Bayesian problems of many-hypotheses testing, naturally, increased.  
The same example was repeated for two- and three-dimensional cases of the river section 
(see section 8.1). The results of the package operation do not practically differ from those of 
the one-dimensional case.  
Multiple recurrence for different generated groups of normally distributed noise vectors 
did not change the qualitative relationship in the results of algorithms for identification of the 
excessive discharge sources. For the considered example, at using the algorithms based on 
Euclidean, Makhalanobis distances, quasi-optimal, unconditional and conditional Bayesian 
algorithms when the number of hypotheses is two, the time needed for identification of the 
sources guilty of the excessive discharges makes up several sec, while at using the 
unconditional and conditional optimal Bayesian algorithms, it makes up greater than 3 and 
10 times, respectively. 
When choosing hypotheses testing algorithm for a concrete section of a certain river, it is 
necessary to study the noise level preliminarily, because, at low noise level, simple algorithms 
requiring minimum calculation time and inconsiderable computer memory can be used.

8.3. MODELING OF POLLUTANTS  
TRANSPORT IN RIVERS 
 
The initial data and computation results for two rivers – the Chogha and the Khobistskali 
from the basin of the River Khobistskali flowing in Georgia located in the Caucasus are 
submitted below. The basin of the River Khobistskali is located in Western Georgia and 
includes four main rivers: the Chogha, the Ochkhomuri, the Chanistskali and the 
Khobistskali. The main of them is the River Khobistskali, an upstream tributary of which is 
the Ochkhomuri, and a downstream tributary is the Chanistskali. The Chogha flows into the 
Ochkhomuri. The Khobistskali is a river of a medium size, about 75 km in length and one 
meter in mean depth. The River Chogha is a small river: about 12 km in length and 20 
centimeters in mean depth. The map of the region of Western Georgia, on which the rivers of 
the Khobistskali basin and the sections, in where the monitoring in 2002 – 2004 years was 
executed are marked, is shown in Figure 8.1. On the map, those sections are marked only the 
observation results of which were used for modeling. As is obvious from the map, the 
Khobistskali flows into the Black Sea. Simulation of the spread of pollutants in the 
considered rivers was executed by pollution parameters NO3 and PO4. It should be borne in 
mind that the observation results for the considered rivers can vary considerably within a 
year. 
 
 
8.3.1. The Initial Data for Modeling 
 
Spread of pollution in the rivers is modeled for the Chogha between points 1 and 2 and 
for the Khobistskali between points 3 and 4 (see Figure 8.1). 
 
8.3.1.1. The River Chogha 
This river along its full length is fed by unpolluted underground waters. The model in 
which 10 point sources are evenly distributed lengthwise of the section is considered. Let’s 
cite the data according to which the spread of the above pollutants in the river was modeled.

Note: In the given Table are given the values of the velocity in two sections of the River 
Khobistskali – at the beginning and at the end of the section. Below, in the item “Geometry 
and dynamics of the section”, for the same river (item 4.2.2.) is given the average flow 
velocity for the whole section. In the models is used the linear interpolation for the water flow 
rate equal to the product of the flow velocity by the cross-cross-section area (see paragraph 
1.5). The flow velocity is calculated for each point of the section with account of the river 
width and depth, which can vary over a wide range within the section. Thus, if the cross-
section area in the middle of the section is smaller, than at its ends, the flow velocity in the 
middle of the section, i.e. the average velocity on the whole section, will be higher than the 
flow velocity at the ends of the section.

8.3.3. Results of Modeling and Discussion 
 
The above computations were carried out on the needs of the Ministry of Agriculture of 
Georgia, which was interested in the estimation of the effect of agricultural fields on the 
pollution level of the considered rivers. As the River Choga becomes polluted only by these 
pollution sources, at modeling actually all pollution sources were taken into account. Whereas 
at modeling the pollution of the River Khobistskali was taken into account the pollution 
brought in the river only the Ochkhomuri and the Chanistskali, because it is rather difficult to 
take into account all the pollution sources of the given river. By the difference between the 
measured and the simulated values of controlled components in the sections of the river, was 
estimated the effect of agricultural fields located along the banks of the river in the interval 
between two sections on the pollution degree of the Khobistskali (see below). In this sense, 
the example is schematic, as the number, the arrangement and the capacities of pollution 
sources of the River Khobistskali partially correspond to the real situation. Though, the 
geometry of the rivers, the arrangement of control sections, the concentrations of polluting

substances in the rivers completely correspond to the real data. The constantly operating 
pollution sources on the River Choga are considered.   
The results of modeling of the pollution of the River Choga for the NO3 component, and 
the River Khobistskali – for the PO4 component, are given above. The modeling was carried 
out with the help of one-, two- and three-dimensional models. Due to the river dimensions, 
the results of two- and three-dimensional models practically coincide. Therefore, below are 
discussed only the results of one- and two-dimensional models. The results of modeling allow 
the following conclusions. 
 
One-dimensional model. The River Choga (Figure 8.2). Because of the effect of 
unpolluted underground waters on the River Choga, which is taken into account in the model 
as a water source evenly distributed along its full length of the river, the concentration of NO3 
component in the upper section of the River Choga decreases to 3.698 from 3.78 
/
mg l  
through 343.75 m , and through 687.5 m  it decreases to 3.6257 
/
mg l . At the distance of 
1000 m  from the upper cross-section, the first pollution source operates. Under the effect of 
this source, the rate of reduction of the pollutant concentration decreases at the cost of 
dilution and at the distance 1031.3 m  from the upper cross-section, the concentration 
becomes equal to 3.5667 
/
mg l . Really, along the first 343.75 m , the concentration of NO3 
in the river water decreases by 0,082 
/
mg l , along the following 343.75 m  it decreases by 
0.0723 
/
mg l , and along the following 343.75 m it decreases by 0.059 
/
mg l , because on 
this section the pollution source operates. This pollution source could not affect more 
considerably the river water, as the volume of water from each source is less by a factor of 
6.
42

 than the volume of water in the river, and the concentration of the polluting 
substance is also less than the pollution of the river by a factor of 5. A similar effect of nine 
other equidistant sources of pollution is observed along the full length of the river. In 
 2 h  
and 13 minutes, the pollution from the upper section of the river spreads at the distance of 4 
500 - 4 800 m . Then the level of pollution in the river sharply falls because of their 
insignificant capacity the sources of pollution located below, do not render appreciable 
influence on the river. In 
 4 h  and 27 minutes the pollution from the upper section reaches 
the points located at the distance of 10 000 m, though the concentration appears, reduced by 
a factor of 
1.359 due to the effect of unpolluted underground waters and at the expense of 
total increase in the water flow rate in the river. In 
6 h h  and 40 minutes, at the distance of 
11 000 m  the pollution is less by a factor of 
1.635 than in the upper section (at the expense 
of the noted factor), and further the distribution of the pollution in the river remains 
practically at the same level, i.e. the process of pollution reaches the steady state (see the 
results of computation in 
8 h  and 54 minutes). 
Because the pollution sources are spaced widely (at 1000 m) and their influence on the 
river is weak enough (the volume of waste waters and the pollution level are small in 
comparison with the river). On the other hand, the increase in the water flow rate of the river 
is significant enough, the effect of these sources on the river is not accumulated (i.e. the total 
effect is not tangible), since at the distance of 1000 m , at the expense of the above

mentioned, in the river the pollution level brought in not only by a pollution source, but also 
from the upper section, decreases to the minimum level. 
The computation results for the two-dimensional model (Figure 8.3) practically 
coincide with the results for the one-dimensional model. Though the reduction of the 
concentration of the polluting substance in the lower section of the river, due to not reaching 
of the pollution from the upper section to the lower part of the river 2 h  and 11 minutes 
occurs more smoothly than in the case of the one-dimensional model (see the results of 
computations for the two-dimensional model at 
). On the basis of the analysis of 
the computation results for the two-dimensional model we can conclude that, for the river 
with the geometry similar to that of the Choga, the use of the two-dimensional model is 
unnecessary (concentrations calculated across the width of the river are practically identical). 
The computing results for the three-dimensional model practically do not differ from the 
two-dimensional model. Therefore, here we do not dwell on it. 
The measured values of the concentration of NO3 in the first and the second control 
sections of the River Choga (see Figure 8.2) are equal to 3.7 
/
mg l  and 2.44 
/
mg l , 
respectively, and the values calculated by the model in the same sections are equal to: by the 
one-dimensional model – 3.698 
/
mg l  and 2.342 
/
mg l ; by the two- dimensional model – 
3.7 
/
mg l  and 2.31 
/
mg l . By simple comparison of the measured values and the values 
obtained by modeling, we are easily convinced in high quality of the modeling results as the 
relative error of the worst result (the two-dimensional model in the second section) is less 
than 5.6 %. 
 
One-dimensional model. The River Khobistskali (Figure 8.4). A similar law is 
observed for the River Khobistskali by PO4 parameter. In 5 h  and 40 minutes the effect of 
the upper section is distributed downstream at the distance of 15 400 m  (
), in 11 h  
and 21 minutes the effect is distributed at the distance of 
40 000 m (
). The 
influence of the Ochkhomuri on the Khobistskali is not tangible because of small quantity of 
water in the Ochkhomuri (less than in the Khobistskali by a factor of 
42), the pollution 
level also is less than in the Khobistskali (0.01 
/
mg l  – the Ochkhomuri; 0.018 
/
mg l  – the 
Khobistskali). The influence of the Chanistskali is appreciable until the pollution from the 
upper section of the Khobistskali reaches the place of their confluence (see 
11 h  and 21 
minutes). After the pollution from the upper section of the Khobistskali reaches the place of 
confluence of the Chanistskali, the influence of the latter is not tangible any more, because of 
the insignificant volume of water in it (less by a factor of 
5,2) and a rather low level of 
pollution (0.051 
/
mg l  – the Chanistskali; 0.018 mg/l – the Khobistskali). See calculation 
results at 
17 h  and 02 minutes and 
22 h  and 43 minutes. 
The application of two- and three-dimensional models (Figure 8.5) for such a river, as 
the Khobistskali is, at consideration of the section of the length at 
45 km  and two 
pollution sources, located at the places of confluence of the Rivers Ochkhomuri and 
Chaniststkali, makes no sense since the calculation results of two- and three-dimensional 
models practically coincide with the one-dimensional model and are identical across the 
width and in the depth of the river. As was mentioned above, by the difference between the

measured and simulated values of the controlled components in the sections of the river of 
our interest, there was estimated the degree of the influence of the agricultural fields located 
along of the river banks in the interval between two sections on the pollution of the River 
Khobistskali. The results of calculations showed that in 2002 from agricultural fields 566.4 
kg  NO3 and 4.18 kg  PO4, act in the River Choga whereas in 2003 the amounts of the same 
pollutants were 276.4 kg  and 3.17 kg , respectively. In 2002 the River Khobistskali got 
62.8 tons NO3 and 673.5 kg  PO4, and in 2003 got 43.6 tons NO3 and 562.7 kg  PO4 
respectively. Such reduction of the pollution level in 2003 in comparison with 2002 was 
basically caused by large-scale introduction of new environment friendly technologies in the 
agriculture in the Khobistskali basin with the financial support of the World Bank.  
 
On the peculiarities of taking into account of pollution sources. In the considered 
models it was supposed that the considered section of the river contains constantly operating 
point sources of pollution. It means that the non-uniform parts of the diffusion equation under 
consideration contain impulse functions being linear combinations of Dirac deltas – functions. 
These functions and their derivatives are not limited therefore, in the vicinities of points of 
action of pollution sources, the difference schemes of the solution of the diffusion equations 
are not correct, which causes sharp oscillations of the obtained solutions, which are visible in 
Figure 8.2 – 8.5. 
For elimination of this drawback, in the package is realized an approach described in 
paragraph 2.7, in which delta-function 

a
x 

 is replaced by continuously-differentiated 
function 


a
x
D

,
. It means that the point sources are replaced by extended sources, the 
capacity of each of which has the maximum corresponding to the capacity of the source at the 
point of its location. It is possible to name such sources as quasi- pointwise. 
In the diagrams, similar to the ones shown in Figure 8.2 – 8.2, constructed for the given 
models of discharge of polluting components, oscillations of the obtained solutions are 
smoothed, as more considerably as the larger are the specified values of parameters  and , 
i.e. the smoother are the functions of discharge, the more accurate are the results of the 
solution of the equations in the vicinities of the points of discharge. 
 
About the accuracy of calculations. At computation of the concentration of polluting 
substances by the one-dimensional model, the accuracy of calculation was determined by 
setting number of central points along the full length of the river (11 000 m  of the Choga) 
equal to 1 000, and at calculation by the two-dimensional model the total number of central 
points was equal to 20 000 (1 000 along the length of the river and 20 across the width of the 
river). Let’s compare some concentrations of polluting substances calculated in these 
conditions from the Tables presented above for the river Choga. For example, compare the 
computed concentrations obtained with the help of the one- and two-dimensional models at 
the distance from the upper section equal to 343.75 m  (
), 3781.3 m  (
) and 10 
600 m (
). The corresponding concentrations obtained with the help of the one-
dimensional model are equal to 3.6980 
/
mg l , 3.1575 
/
mg l  and 0.0602 
/
mg l ; and with 
the help of the two-dimensional model – to 3.7016

The relative differences among these values are equal to 0,00097, 0,09178 and 0,0548, 
respectively. Thus, for the first point we obtained the relative difference between the 
calculation results by the one- and the two-dimensional models – 0,097 %, for the second 
point – 9,178 % and for the third point – 5,48 %. In our opinion, there is good agreement 
between the results for chosen accuracies of computation, as the step of time sampling was 
chosen so that the accuracy of the algorithm by the temporal coordinate approximately 
coincided with the accuracy of the algorithm by the spatial coordinates. The accuracy of 
concurrence of the models of different dimensionality is improved at increasing accuracy of 
the computation both by the spatial and temporal coordinates.   
The hatched zones on the first line (here and below on the other figures) show the river 
bed with pollution sources (the black dots with numbers). The first zone (between two 
vertical lines) corresponds to the modeling cross-section of the river. The second zone 
corresponds to the classical boundary condition.

8.4. RIVER POLLUTION COMPONENTS MEAN ANNUAL VALUES 
ESTIMATION BY COMPUTER MODELING 
 
With the help of described in Chapter 6 software of mathematical models of transport of 
pollution substances in the rivers we have carried out computation of quantities of polluting 
components dropped for 2002 and 2003 from pollution sources on separate sections of rivers 
the Choga, The Ochlhomuri, the Chanistskali and the Khobistskali, among cross-sections, 
included in the monitoring. On Figure 8.6 by red triangles are marked the monitoring cross-
sections dividing the rivers as sections. By the help of these meanings we can: 1) to estimate a 
share working on each of section of the river of pollution sources in total amount of pollution 
of the river; 2) to estimate a change dropped for 2002, 2003 of quantities of polluting 
components on separate sections of the river, i.e. the efficiency of those measures which were 
carried out in these years on the marked pollution sources; 3) within the framework of those 
opportunities which are given by division of the rivers into sections by existing control cross-
sections of monitoring, from each other to divide working on the river agricultural and others 
(for example, cities, located on the rivers; run other rivers) pollution sources; 4) to estimate 
the ecological load on the river from agricultural fields and cattle-breeding farms.

Let us bring the brief description of the obtained results.   
Modelling have carried out by basic biological parameters, nitrates (NO3) and phosphates 
(PO4), outgoing from agricultural fields and cattle-breeding farms. The results of monitoring 
of 2002 and 2003 were used for modelling. The idea of modelling consists in the following. 
On the basis of the monitoring results are known the mean annual concentrations of the 
marked components in each control cross-sections of the rivers. If we admit that on the given 
section of the river the pollution sources do not work, then existing in the top cross-section of 
the river the pollution level should decrease in the bottom cross-section at the expense of 
proceeding in the river of natural processes and ability of self purification. In reality for the 
Khobistskali’s basin rivers this fact does not take place, as on each section of the river the 
appropriate pollution sources work. Therefore, if with the help of the developed mathematical 
models, we shall compute the concentration of polluting components in the bottom cross-
section of the river by existing concentration in the top cross-section and after a condition that 
on this section of the river does not work any pollution source except of other river (if such 
runs in it on this section), then with a difference between measured and computed 
concentrations we shall easily compute the quantity of polluting components dropped in the 
river from pollution sources worked on this section.  
In considered concrete case for modelling was used one-dimensional mathematical model 
of diffusion and transfer of pollution (see paragraph 1.2) [1, 5, 42]. It is caused by the 
following circumstances: in first, on the geometrical sizes of the considered rivers (in a case, 
when length of that section of the river, which modelling is carried out, 10 times and more 
surpass its width, to provide width is not meaningful because of  full mixing of water of the 
river on a considered section of the river; also, if width of the river 10 and more time 
surpasses its depth, for the same reason, the account of depth loses of sense [5]), and in 
second because the average year data are used and the accuracy of model more high rank, in 
this case, loses of sense. The modelling results obtained by us for the Khobistskali’s basin 
rivers with the help of one, two and three dimensional models, precisely have confirmed the 
marked reason. I.e. two and three dimensional models on all width and depth were given 
identical results with one-dimensional model that completely corresponds to the above – 
mentioned.  
The concentrations of NO3 and PO4 on all the lengths of the rivers Choga, Ochkhomuri, 
Chanistskali and Khobistskali are calculated through the identical spatial steps. In case of the 
river Choga the length of the step is equal to 343,75 meters, in case of the r. Ochkhomuri the 
length of the step is equal to 1334,4 meters, in case of the r. Chanistskali the length of the step 
is equal to 1165,6 meters, and in case of the r. Khobistskali the length of the step is equal to 
2337,5 meters. For the r. Choga the time of full updating of water, i.e. that time, which is 
necessary for run of water from a source of the river up to its confluence in other river, is 
equal to 
15 h 36 min. For the rivers Ochkhomuri, Chanistskali and Khobistskali this time 
are accordingly equalled to 
39 h 12 min, 
20 h 25 min, 
9 h 27 min. Therefore, at 
modelling on time parameter of the river through the appropriate interval of time it is possible 
taking of computed meaning of concentration in any point of the river on all length, as it 
corresponds to the counted by the appropriate model meaning of concentration in initial 
section.  
In the tables 8.34, 8.35, 8.36, 8.37 are given the results of calculation of mean annual 
meanings of pollutants got from the appropriate sources in separate sections of the rivers 
during 2002, 2003.

model on the appropriate section; 
  
 is the charge of water in the appropriate section of the river.  
 
The results of computation by formulae (8.1) are given in the tables 8.34, 8.35, 8.36 and 
8.37. In the two last column of the tables are given by the considered rivers brought mean 
annual volumes of polluting components in places of them confluence, calculated as by di-
rectly results of measurement, and by direct summation of the computed by model the 
appropriate meanings in separate sections of the rivers. On the basis of these results is 
concluded:  
 
 
In 2002, 2003 r. Choga basically was polluted at sources by parameter NO3, up to 
first section. In 2002 the river was polluted in more to bottom part by parameter PO4, 
i.e. between the first and second sections. In 2003 the situation has changed and the 
river was polluted more up to the first section by parameter PO4. The pollution of the 
river by both considered parameters in 2003 is significant decrease after comparison 
with 2002: by parameter NO3 from 566,4 ton/years till 276,4 ton/years (
2 times), 
and by parameter PO4 from 4,18 kg/years till 3,17 kg/years (
1,32 times). A 
difference between measured and computed meanings defined by mean annual vo-
lumes of the polluting components brought by the river Choga in the r. Ochkhomuri, 
on our sight, specifies high quality of modelling, if we take into account that 
circumstance that the modelling was carried out on the basis of the defective initial 
data (because of absence of the better). For example, expenses of the river (as well as 
for other rivers of the Khobistskali’s basin) completely was measured only in 2003 
(in 2002 only three times were measured the water expenses); exactly are not known 
the coefficients of diffusion and non conservative etc. Despite of told the modelling 
and measurement results with acceptable accuracy coincide with each other that 
specifies accuracy of the used technique. 
 
The pollution of the river Ochkhomuri by parameter NO3 in 2002 in all control 
sections was carried out practically equally, except of last section, where the 
pollution 
1,9 times is surpassed of the pollution of other sections. In 2003 the river 
is most of all polluted with marked parameter on initial and final sections. In 2002 
the third section of the river is most of all polluted by parameter PO4, and in 2003 
namely this section is polluted less of all. The r. Choga runs in the r. Ochkhomuri in

this section. As we already have noted in 2002 the pollution of the r. Choga by 
parameter NO3 
2 times are surpassed the pollution of 2003, and by parameter PO4 
- 
1,32 times. The pollution of the r. Ochkhomuri on the last section (where the r. 
Choga runs in it) in 2002 
2,7 times are surpassed the pollution of 2003 by 
parameter NO3 and 
2,8 times - by parameter PO4. The mean annual volumes, 
computed by model and directly by measured meanings, brought in of polluting com-
ponents by the river Ochkhomuri in the river Khobistsksli practically are equal 
among themselves. Brought by the river Ochkhomuri in the river Khobistsksli the 
mean annual meanings of polluting components on both considered components 
considerably has decreased after comparison with 2002: by parameter NO3 from 
7,119 ton/years till 3,685 ton/years (
2 times), and by parameter PO4 from 36,212 
kg/years till 33,661 kg/years (
1,08 times).  
 
The r. Chanistskali by parameters NO3 and PO4 both in 2002, and in 2003 is more 
polluted in the second section than in the first. In this section the river pollute not 
only by agricultural fields and cattle-breeding farms, but by waste water of the city 
Tsalendjikha too. The pollution of the river by parameter NO3 in 2002 surpasses the 
pollution of 2003 and by parameter PO4 the pollution of 2002 lags from the pollution 
of 2003. In particular, at 2002 the mean annual volume of the component NO3 drop-
ped by r. Chanistskali in the river Khobistskali is equal to 18,026 ton/year, which on 
the volume of 2003, 11,197 ton/year, surpass 
1,6 times, and mean annual volume 
of the component PO4 in 2002 is equal to 88,515 kg / year, which lags from mean 
annual volume of 2003, 123,018 kg/years, 
1,4 times. Computed by mathematical 
models and directly by measured meanings brought by the river Chanistskali in the 
river Khobistskali volumes of polluting components coincide with each other by very 
high accuracy. In our opinion, one of the reasons of such good result consists that 
calculation of self purification coefficient of the river for considered components was 
possible for data of the river Chanistskali, which have taken advantage for other 
rivers too. 
 
The river Khobistskali in 2002 is most of all polluted in the first and in the last 
sections. On these sections, except of agricultural fields and cattle-breeding farms the 
river accordingly becomes polluted by waste water of the cities Chkhorotsku and 
Khobi. On the next place by pollution there is the fourth section of the river, where 
the river Chanistskali runs into it. In 2003 the river is almost equally polluted in the 
first and fourth sections, i.e. the sections on which work the city Chkhorotsku and the 
r. Chanistskali. The last section, where on the river work the city Khobi, is one of 
least polluted. This fact is very much interesting, which one more time confirms the 
reason that by the considered components the basic pollution sources of the rivers are 
agricultural fields and cattle -breeding farms. The pollution of the r. Khobistskali by 
the parameter NO3 in 2002 surpasses the pollution of 2003 and by parameter PO4 the 
pollution of 2002 lags behind pollution of 2003. In particular, by the river 
Khobistskali in the Black sea introduced the mean annual volume of the component 
NO3 is equal to 62,772 ton/year, which surpasses the volume of 2003 43,605 
ton/years 
1,4 times, and the mean annual volume of the component PO4 for 2002 
is equal 562,695 kg / year, which lag from the mean annual volume of 2003 673,473 
kg/year 
1,2 times. The computed by the mathematical model and in direct by 
measured meanings brought by the river Khobistskali in the Black Sea volumes of

CONCLUSION 
 
In the monograph from the single methodical point of view there are developed the 
mathematical models of diffusion of pollutants in the rivers and methods for marking 
decision. The problem of identification of emergency pollution sources in the rivers is 
formalized. The algorithms for the solution of stated problems are designed. Optimum and 
quasi-optimum algorithms of hypotheses testing are also developed. The one-, two- and three- 
dimensional mathematical models of pollutants transport and diffusion in the rivers are built 
under different initial and boundary conditions. The computation schemes of these models are 
optimized. The universal method of identification of nonlinear statistical models for the 
description of pollutants changes in the rivers is developed and the algorithms of its 
realization for the set of nonlinear functional dependences are given. The program packages 
of identification of excessive pollution sources and realization of mathematical models of

pollutants transport in the rivers are also developed. The designed methods and algorithms are 
incorporated into those packages, which are realized as the application software packages for 
IBM – compatible personal computers in accordance with generally accepted standards 
applicable to similar products through the world. They are loaded to the CD-ROM and are 
attached to this book. Users can exploit them as modern, convenient and reliable instruments 
at solution of the problems from the considered areas. Comprehensive experimental 
researches of designed software packages and algorithms realized in them have proved their 
high computing, operational and service qualities. 
We believe the results given in this work are interesting and useful for a wide range of 
specialists and scientists working as in the field of applied mathematics, as in modeling and 
monitoring of pollution of natural waters, ecology, hydrology, power engineering, building of 
different structures on water objects etc. Their importance and practical value is the applied 
nature of the obtained theoretical results, which are submitted in the friendly form for 
comprehension and are ready (appended software packages) for direct application for the 
solution of practical tasks. Advantages of the elaborated methods and algorithms are shown 
not only through theoretical judgements and calculations, but also through the demonstration 
of results of particular calculus and modeling. 
We believe the offered book will be of interest and useful not only for the experienced 
specialists and scientists, working in the relevant areas, but also for young, starting persons. It 
also will be useful for students and post-graduate students specializing in the respective areas. 
Interested persons can obtain working copies of the developed packages for their 
practical use addressing to authors to the address: kartlos5@yahoo.com.

In the program is realized the possibility of an automatic choice of the model’s power, i.e. 
identification not only the coefficients, but also a power of the polyinomial by the following 
algorithm. 
Let minimal variance corresponds to the model of power 
; 
, where 
 is 
possible greatest power of the model. Let's designate this variance by 
. Let's 
construct a confidence interval

As a restored dependence we shall accept the model with the minimal power from the set 
of identified models, the variances of which falled in the constructed confidentce interval. 
The choice of model’s power is similarly carried out at identification of other 
dependences for which it is necessary.

The consecutive values 
 of the independent variable should be equidistanced from each 
other with the step 
, where 
 - the number of the measured values in a period – is 
integer, greater than or equal to 3; the general number of measured values 
 should be 
greater than or equal to 
; moreover, the number 
 should be divided by 
 without a 
remainder. If the latest condition is broken, then for determition of the unknown parameters 
are only considered the first 
 values of 
 and 
, and other values are not taken into 
account; here 
 is integer component of the number 
. 
The considered dependence satisfies the condition

22. REGRESSION ANALYSIS  
 
At identification of the above-stated functional dependences, in developed by authors of 
this book software package SDpro is an opportunity of switching on of the mode of operation 
for testing of regression model on the adequacy [93, 94, 101, 226]. In this mode of operation, 
the hypothesis about conformity of restored dependence to experimental data is tested by the 
following algorithm. The interval of representation of independent variable 
 is 
divided into 
 groups and there is calculated

probability 
. Here 
 is confidence probability. 
If 
 then on the display is brought out the message “simplify regression”, i.e. for 
restoration of functional dependence it is necessary to choose more simple dependence among 
offered in the menu. If 
 then on the display is brought out the message 
“complicate regress” and we choose more complex regression dependence among offered in 
the menu. 
In the program of realization of this algorithm is an opportunity to set any allowable 
value of

the display) and 
 - the significance level of criterion.
