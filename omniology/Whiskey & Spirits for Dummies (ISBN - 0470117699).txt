About the Author
Perry Luntz has been involved in one way or another with the 
beverage alcohol business most of his adult life. For more than 
20 years he has been publisher and editor of Beverage Alcohol
Market Report, an international e-letter for marketing executives 
in beer, wine, and spirits.  He served as Director of Marketing
Communications for Seagram Distillers for a decade, worked on 
the creative side of several advertising agencies, including a spell
as a creative director of a Young & Rubicam division, and for sev-
eral years headed his own marketing communications agency. 
A consultant, lecturer, teacher, and news media source, Perry 
is frequently interviewed in newspapers, radio, and television,
including the BBC. He is chairman emeritus of the Wine Media
Guild, proving he knows his way around vineyards and breweries,
as well as distilleries. 
Like many native New Yorkers, Perry is a political junky. He served
several years as president of a highly regarded NYC political club.
For the past decade, Perry has been Senior Editor of the Beverage
Media Group, a network of trade magazines read by 140,000
licensed retailers. He also writes a weekly column for the group’s 
B-to-B Internet site.
He lives with his wife Carol Ann Rinzler in the Center of the Known
Universe — Midtown Manhattan — occasionally visiting his home
town of Brooklyn, where his son Russell lives with wife Lisa
Di Gennaro. In the winter, he and Carol often become “snow birds” 
to descend on the rest of their family, Ira, Jacky, and grandsons 
Ari and Eli, who live in Sarasota, Florida.


Dedication
For Lloyd, whose light is gone but whose spirit is always with us.
Acknowledgments
It’s impossible to say how much I owe to Carol Ann Rinzler, my wife,
confidant, love of my life, and a damned good editor as well as a
prolific and terrific author.  I’ll settle for saying just this: I couldn’t
have done it without you!
For my children, Ira and Jackie, Russell and Lisa, and my grand-
children Ari and Eli — my cheering section — most appreciation
and love.
On a professional level, my blessings are extended to the many
friends and mentors in the spirits business with whom I’ve worked
over the years. They are the most generous and forthcoming
people in the world, and I love them all. 
In particular, I want to thank Bill Slone, whose support made this
book possible. Special acknowledgment goes to my oldest and
wisest friends in the business, Gerry Slone, Ron Kapon, and Herbert
Silverman, as well as the two best mixologists in the world, Dale
De Grof and Ray Foley. 
Particular thanks to Lisa Hawkins of DISCUS and Chris Morris of
Brown-Forman, who helped make sure the chapter on distillation
was accurate. In all cases, any errors are mine, not those who
helped me.
And of course where would this book have been without the gentle
editorial ministrations of Wiley’s Michael Lewis, Tim Gallan, Sarah
Faulkner, and my guardian angel agent Phyllis Westberg. 
It was a long time coming, but I hope all who contributed to it enjoy
reading this book as much as I enjoyed writing it.

Whiskey & Spirits For Dummies

Introduction
F
or thousands of years man and womankind celebrated major
events — religious and secular — by having a taste or even
two of a fermented beverage that contained alcohol. Things got
even tastier around 800 CE — the height of development of the
Moorish culture. That’s when a brilliant alchemist in the perpetual
search for a way to turn lead into gold attempted to urge the
release of the “essence” of various fruits and grains. The result was
not only better than anything ever enjoyed before, but it also could
be repeated over and over again.
That brilliant alchemist had found distillation. The art of making
the most noble of beverages was created by nature and perfected
by men and women. This book is dedicated to giving you a full
explanation of distillation from the simplest and most popular
spirit (vodka) to the most complicated (whiskey and brandy).
No, Whiskey & Spirits For Dummies definitely won’t tell you how to
set up your very own still in the basement (or bathtub) so that you
can whip up a batch of your very own whiskey, gin, vodka, Tequila,
rum, cordial, or Cognac.
Instead, this book aims to increase your appreciation of the quali-
ties in fine distilled spirits, enabling you to make wise choices from
the myriad products on the shelves in your local liquor store or in
the literally hundreds of cocktails available for serving or drinking
on social occasions. Drinking alcohol beverages is indeed a social
thing to do. It’s also part of religious services, and its use as a psy-
chic benefit is unquestioned. There are other sides to these noble
beverages as well.
This book also presents some ways in which a measured drink or
two a day can create a more healthful way to live. I also talk about
how to avoid any of the unpleasant results that can come from
drinking too much.

For those readers who know absolutely nothing about distilled
spirits other than that these beverages enhance a social setting
and dining experience, this book is a good place to start to pick up
the basics.
More experienced connoisseurs will find this a refresher course
that can confirm their own good taste, introduce them to a few new
types and brands of distilled spirits, and provide the kind of odds
and ends — for example, why whiskey is spelled whiskey in Ireland
and whisky in Scotland — that enliven cocktail conversation. And,
yes, I give you several classic cocktail recipes in here, too.

To make the text consistent and easier to read, Whiskey & Spirits
For Dummies follows the usual Dummies style. For example:
 All Web addresses are printed in monofont.
 When this book was printed, some Web addresses may have
needed to break across two lines of text. If that happened, rest
assured that I didn’t put in any extra characters (such as
hyphens) to indicate the break. So, when using one of these
Web addresses, just type in exactly what you see in this book,
pretending that the line break doesn’t exist.
 New terms appear in italic type and are followed by an easy-
to-understand definition.
 Bold type is used to highlight the action parts of numbered
steps.
What You’re Not to Read
Imagine: An author telling you that you don’t have to read every
word that appears in his book. The truth is that some small parts
of this book are fun or provide information that you may not find
anywhere else, but they aren’t absolutely essential to your under-
standing of the basic facts about distilled spirits. For example:
 The text in sidebars: These shaded boxes are exactly that —
sidebars to the main event — a little anecdote here, a special
factoid there. Fascinating, but not essential.

 The text next to a Technical Stuff icon: Readers who want to
know every single fact about how things work will find these
paragraphs a delight. Readers who can do without the techni-
cal details can surf on by.
 The text on the copyright page: Really. This page is for pub-
lishers and libraries. If my editor put the dedication there to
save space, I think you should read about the people who
helped make this book possible, but the publisher’s address?
The number of editions? The Library of Congress identifica-
tion number? Nah.
Foolish Assumptions
If an author clicks the computer, hits typewriter keys, or pushes a
quill pen across the page, what’s in front of him or her is an image
of the person for whom the book is being written. These are some
of the assumptions I made about you:
 You know the names of the different types of distilled spirits,
but you may not be totally familiar with the characteristics
that differentiate a whiskey from a Tequila (you may even
know why Tequila is spelled with a capital letter and whiskey
is not).
 You’ve read conflicting reports about the risks and benefits of
spirits (and other kinds of alcohol beverages), and you want
to pin down the real facts.
 You want the basic information about these products and how
they’re made, but you have no intention of opening your own
distillery. That’s good, because a few paragraphs back you were
told that this book isn’t designed to tell you how to do that.
 Most important, you enjoy the flavor, aroma, and panache of
distilled spirits — but only and always in moderation.
How This Book Is Organized
The following is a brief summary of each part of Whiskey & Spirits
For Dummies. You can use this as a fast guide to check out the stuff
you want to go to first, because the best thing about a For Dummies
book is that no one expects you to start at Chapter 1 and work your
way straight through to the end. Each chapter here is a whole little
book of its own, which means that you can start anywhere and still
come out with a wealth of new information about distilled spirits.
Introduction
3

Part I: Entering the Spirits World
Chapter 1 is (what else?) a general introduction to the universe of
distilled spirits. Chapter 2 is more technical: A detailed description
of the distillation process in all its traditional glory. Chapter 3 tells
you how to serve, evaluate, and enjoy the products produced in
Chapter 2.
Part II: Whiskeys from 
Around the World
Chapter 4 is all about how the Irish introduced the first whiskeys.
Chapter 5 explains how the Scots adopted the Irish spirits — and
changed the spelling to “whisky,” thus confusing generation after
generation of whiskey (or is it whisky?) drinkers.
Chapter 6 salutes two quintessential Americans — Bourbon and
Tennessee whiskey. Chapter 7 describes the other great American
innovation, American blended whiskey, and tells you all about
upstarts from India, Japan, and New Zealand. Chapter 8 goes north
to talk about a Canadian contribution to New World whisky choices.
Part III: Surfing the White Waters: 
A Guide to “Clear” Spirits
Chapter 9 focuses on gin, from its birth in the Netherlands, toward
its perfection in London, through its Prohibition adolescence, to its
present presence. Chapter 10 is about vodka, the clear Russian
spirit now often enjoyed in totally unexpected flavors. Chapter 11
is all about Tequila, the Aztec contribution to your drinking pleas-
ure. Chapter 12 focuses on rum, the spirit made from sugar cane
first carried to the Western hemisphere by Christopher Columbus.
Yes, that Christopher Columbus.
Part IV: Enjoying the “After Dinner”
Specials
The subject of Chapter 13 is Winston Churchill’s favorite spirit,
brandy. Chapter 14 rewards the sweet tooth with info about the
sweet stuff: cordials and liqueurs.

Part V: The Part of Tens
This is the part of the book regular For Dummies readers never
skip. Chapter 15 pours recipes for ten classic cocktails (with an
extra from the bartender). Chapter 16 dishes out menu choices —
entrees, main dishes, veggies, and desserts — whose ingredients
include at least one type of spirit. Chapter 17 tells what nutrients
(!) are in one serving of each type of distilled spirits. Chapter 18
concludes with the actual health benefits of moderate spirits 
consumption.

Where to Go from Here
Now the question is where to begin reading. The real answer is any-
where your curiosity takes you in the Table of Contents. However,
one good starting point is Chapter 2, the one that explains how dis-
tilled spirits are made. A second good starting point is Chapter 3,
the one that shows you how to enjoy distilled products. Both chap-
ters have information that applies to all types of spirits.
Wherever you start, hopefully it will be a trip you’ll remember for a
long time. Good traveling.

Entering the 
Spirits World

In this part . . .
Just like that ﬁrst sip of your favorite spirit, this part 
is pure pleasure. Here I trace the history of distilled
spirits, right from the beginning in the 11th century. I also
explain the distillation process, and I offer tips on how to
serve and enjoy distilled spirits. I recommend reading the
chapters in this part if you’re new to the spirits world; this
information is bound to whet your appetite for the various
alcohol beverages you can read about in the rest of the
book. Pour yourself a glass of whiskey, settle into your
most comfortable chair, and start reading.

Chapter 1
Discovering Distilled Spirits
In This Chapter
 How distilled spirits were invented
 How distilled spirits became popular
 The foods from which spirits are made
 The varieties of distilled spirits
T
his chapter is called “Discovering Distilled Spirits,” but
“Distilled Spirits 101” would also do nicely because this is a
down-to-earth basic guide to the multicultural history of the won-
derful beverages human beings produce via distillation.
Naturally, the chapter includes some spirits history, starting with a
graceful bow to other types of alcohol beverages and how they
differ from the distilled varieties. The different types of spirits are
listed here, as are the foods from which they’re made. And just for
kicks, I give you a quiz about famous spirits (okay, famous ghosts)
in classic movies.
A Brief History of Distilled Spirits
The road to distilled spirits begins with those other beverages,
wine and beer.
The story starts one day back in the dim, distant past at a point
that most anthropologists peg between 5000 and 6000 BCE. A
goatherd in the Tigris-Euphrates valley (now Iraq), where human
beings created their first agricultural communities, noticed that his
flock was friskier than usual.

Part I: Entering the Spirits World 
10
Looking closely, he saw the goats feasting on rotting grapes fallen
from a nearby vine. Being a curious goatherd, he tasted a few
grapes himself. Then he tried a few more, and maybe another
handful after that, and soon goats and goatherd ambled happily
back to their village to share their discovery with others.
Of course, you know what that anonymous goatherd didn’t: Those
“rotten” grapes had fermented.
In other words, naturally occurring microorganisms in the air had
landed on the grapes and started feeding on the fruit, digesting the
grape sugars, and turning them into gas (carbon dioxide) and
liquid ethanol/ethyl alcohol, which is the same alcohol used in all
modern alcohol beverages.
Eureka! Wine! Beer!
Very quickly, the goatherd’s friends, neighbors, and acquaintances
far and near grasped the idea that squeezing rotten, sorry, 
fermented, fruit released a pleasantly intoxicating beverage called
wine (from the Greek vinos, the Latin vinum, the Old English win,
and the Germanic winam).
And then they discovered that fermenting grains released an
equally pleasant intoxicating beverage called beer (from the Latin
bibere [to drink], the German bier, and the Old English beor,
pronounced beer).
After that, a jolly good time was had pretty much everywhere fruits
and grains were grown. And it was a profitable time, as well: The
oldest known Sumerian tablet is a receipt for a shipment of beer
from Mesopotamia to some lucky merchant in Northern Greece.
This tablet is a hunk of clay that made it possible for modern
scholars to translate the language of Sumer, the nation of Middle
Eastern city-states that was one of the world’s earliest civilizations.
Advancing the art
At first, folks were content with wine and beer. But being human
and naturally inquisitive, they began to experiment with ways to
standardize the fermentation process because they wanted to
manage the production and improve the quality of alcohol 
beverages.

The first step was to take control of fermentation by adding spe-
cific microorganisms (yeasts) to the fruit and grains rather than
simply allowing miscellaneous little buggers to waft in and ferment
the fruit by accident.
The second step was to distill alcohol from the liquid released by
the fermented food.
Unlike the discovery of fermentation, which seems to have been a
happy coincidence, learning how to distill alcohol was the result of
a deliberate series of experiments conducted by an Arab scholar
named Abu Musa Jabir ibn Hayyam (?–803 CE). Most modern scien-
tists generally accept Jabir, known in the West as Geber, as the
Father of Modern Chemistry.
Sometime during the eighth century CE — these dates are never
quite as clear as one might like them to be — Geber was puttering
around with his al-ambiq, a round pot with a tall spout rising from
the top, sort of like an oversized tea kettle. When liquid was heated
in the pot, the vapors rose through the spout to be cooled, con-
densed, and collected as a liquid in a vessel conveniently posi-
tioned under the spout.
Chapter 1: Discovering Distilled Spirits 11
Not all alcohol is “alcohol”
Ethanol (ethyl alcohol) is the only alcohol used in food and beverages, but it isn’t
the only alcohol used in consumer products.
Other alcohols that may be sitting on the shelf in your bathroom or workshop are:
 Methyl alcohol (methanol): Methanol is a poisonous alcohol made from wood.
It’s used as a chemical solvent (a liquid that dissolves other chemicals). During
Prohibition, when the sale of beverage alcohol was illegal, some unscrupulous
illegal producers would substitute methanol for ethanol, thus leading to many
truly unpleasant results, such as blindness and even death, among people who
drank it.
 Isopropyl alcohol (isoproanol, “rubbing alcohol”): Isopropyl alcohol is a poi-
sonous alcohol made from propylene, a petroleum derivative. It’s denatured,
which means that it includes a substance that makes it taste and smell bad so
you won’t drink it by mistake.
 Denatured alcohol: When ethanol is used in cosmetics, such as hair tonic, it,
too, is treated to make it smell and taste bad. Treated ethanol is called dena-
tured alcohol. Some denaturants (the chemicals used to denature the alcohol)
are poisonous, so some denatured alcohol is also poisonous when taken inter-
nally. In other words, it’s definitely not a good idea to drink your hair tonic.

Part I: Entering the Spirits World 
12
The al-ambiq was standard equipment for alchemists, the medieval
practitioners who spent their lives trying to turn base metal into
gold and, as a sideline, looking for the magical “elixir of life” that
would make men immortal.
But Geber, who may have been a wine aficionado, took a different
tack. He wondered what would happen if he poured wine into the
al-ambiq and boiled it.
In other words — “Eureka!” will do nicely — the man was about to
invent distillation.
Distillation arrives
It’s a physical fact that alcohol boils at a lower temperature than
water, so when Geber poured his wine into his al-ambiq and set the
pot over a fire, the alcohol in the fermented grape juice or the fer-
mented grain and water mixture used to make beer vaporized
before the rest of the liquid in the pot.
The alcohol vapors rose through the spout on the al-ambiq, were
collected and condensed, and, just like that, Geber produced the
world’s first distilled spirit. And it needed a new name.
The solution was simple: While some alchemists were playing
around with longevity tonics, early cosmeticians used their 
al-ambiqs to boil up powdered antimony in water, producing a 
dark liquid called kohl or al-kohl.
Al-kohl became alcohol. The al-ambiq became the alembic still, also
known as the pot still, which is described in detail in Chapter 2.
And that’s how your favorite distilled spirit drink was born.
The secret gets out
Geber died in 803 CE, but his distillation process lived on among
his Arab compatriots who used the distillate they produced not as
a beverage but as a medicine.
The Arabs kept distillation to themselves for several centuries,
taking their secrets with them to the Iberian Peninsula when they
conquered Spain. When Spain expelled its non-Christian citizens in
1492 and Portugal followed suit in 1597, the secrets of how to make

grain and fruits into a potent medicine remained behind to be
taken in hand by those doctors of the Middle Ages — monastery
monks. Like the Arabs, the monks prescribed the distillates, includ-
ing some that they originated — such as Benedictine and
Chartreuse liqueurs — for medicinal purposes.
The missionary/medicine men met with enough successes to con-
vince the European pagans that these liquids carried the blessings
of God to assure a long, healthy life. Around the year 1300, Arnald
of Villanova, a professor of medicine at Montpellier (France), one
of the earliest European medical schools, compiled the first (hand)
written instructions for distilling alcohol from wine.
Arnald christened distilled alcohol aqua vitae (Latin for “water of
life”), which translated to eau de vie in French, uisege beatha
among the Celts, akavit in Scandinavia, and vodka/wodka (“dear
little water”) in Russia and Poland. By any name, the distillate was
reputed, in Villanova’s words, to “prolong life, clear away ill-
humors, revive the heart, and maintain youth.” Others claimed it
also alleviated diseases of the brain, nerves, and joints; calmed
toothaches; cured blindness, speech defects, and paralysis; and
warded off the Black Death.
Chapter 1: Discovering Distilled Spirits 13
Moderation is the message
In 1478, 48 years after Gutenberg invented the printing press, an Austrian physician
named Michael Puff von Schrick published the very first book on distillation. Puff’s
piece immediately hit the 15th-century bestseller list, going through 14 editions in 20
years.
Most readers probably bought the book to use as a medical reference, but a sig-
nificant number likely picked it up in order to learn how to make distilled spirits with
local fruits and other produce for pleasure.
The new distilled spirits were very popular, so much so that in 1496, a doctor in
Nuremberg, Germany, whose name is unfortunately lost to history, offered a word
to the wise imbiber: “In view of the fact that everyone at present has gotten into the
habit of drinking aqua vitae, it is necessary to remember the quantity one can permit
oneself to drink, and learn to drink it according to one’s capacity, if one wishes to
behave as a gentleman.”
Sounds as good today as it did then.

Part I: Entering the Spirits World 
14
Not surprisingly, nobody at all complained about having to take
Arnald’s medicine instead of the crushed leaves, boiled grains, and
pressed herbs it came from.
The process goes global
Serendipitously, the spread of distillation occurred just as
Europeans began to seriously explore and colonize the world,
establishing regular trade routes between Europe and the East and
Europe and the New World.
The Spanish and the Portuguese were leaders in the exploration
game, bringing back new products and taking their alcohol bever-
ages with them. Spirits, in particular, were a win-win trade-off
because they were
 Virtually unknown in the lands the explorers explored
 Easy to produce
 A really smart way to turn an excess crop, such as grain, into
a cash product rather than leaving it to rot in the field
 A stable beverage that resisted spoilage and turned tastier as
it aged in wooden barrels
Best of all, distilled spirits were a totally natural product that —
after distillation became common knowledge — could be produced
from virtually any local plant anywhere in the world. As a result, by
the 19th century, distilled spirits of one sort or another were avail-
able pretty much anywhere a traveler traveled.
Table 1-1 is a list of the plant foods that can be fermented to pro-
vide the base for making distilled spirits.

Setting Standards for Producing
Modern Distilled Spirits
Distilled spirits came to the United States just as they had every-
where else — with the explorers and the immigrants. The Irish
brought their own whiskey and so did the Scots. The Brits and
Dutch brought gin, the French brandy, and Slavic people vodka.
The only difference was that while religious objections led to 
forbidding the use of any alcohol beverages (including spirits) in
some countries, the United States stands alone in having once 
prohibited drinking for political reasons. (State legislatures under
pressure from their constituents passed bans of varying severity
on beverage alcohol production and distribution. So many states
had bans, in fact, that ultimately the federal government had to
follow suit or face interstate warfare.)
The not-so-noble experiment
In 1917, following years of agitation by anti-alcohol activists and
the passage of prohibition laws in a number of states, the United
States Congress passed the 18th Amendment to the Constitution
prohibiting distribution or sale of alcohol beverages nationally.
One exception: Medical purposes with a prescription only.
Chapter 1: Discovering Distilled Spirits 15

Part I: Entering the Spirits World 
16
Two years later, after ratification by the requisite three-fourths of
the states, Prohibition became the law of the land. Congress then
passed the Volstead Act (the National Prohibition Enforcement
Act) defining an alcohol beverage as any liquid containing more
than 0.5 percent alcohol.
The result was an increase in crime as Americans in general said,
“No way,” to what President Herbert Hoover called “the Noble
Experiment.” Americans did their drinking at home or in speakeasies
(nightclubs hidden behind locked doors, opened only to a secret
password such as “Joe sent me”). Alcohol was shipped in surrepti-
tiously by bootleggers sneaking across the country’s seacoasts or its
northern or southern borders. Worse yet, there was also an increase
in illness due to the fact that much of the alcohol making its way
into America’s drinking glasses and teacups was unregulated,
unsafe, and sometimes deadly.
By 1933, the country had had enough: On December 5, the 21st
Amendment to the Constitution was ratified, repealing the 18th,
and Americans could once again legally enjoy alcohol beverages,
including those of the distilled variety.
New rules for better times
The bad news about Prohibition is that it increased crime and
reduced the safety of alcohol beverages. The good news is that
after the country recovered from its dry spell, the federal govern-
ment sat down to write the Alcohol Administration Act on what
exactly constituted a specific spirit.
Since then, other countries and economic entities such as the
European Union have followed suit. As a result, when you buy
Scotch whisky or Bourbon or any other distilled spirit from a 
recognized distiller anywhere in the world, you know that you’re
getting a standardized, reliable product.
The American rules, known formally as Standards of Identity, are
contained in Title 27 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 1,
Part 5, Section 5.22.
If you want to know every single little detail about what makes a
distilled spirit a whiskey, say, or a vodka, every single fact is avail-
able online at www.atf.treas.gov/regulations/27cfr5.html. If
your eyes glaze at the very thought of making your way through

government-ese, you can find a slightly more user-friendly version
posted online by an organization called The Online Distillery
Network for Distilleries & Fuel Ethanol Plants Worldwide at
www.distill.com/specs/USA10.html.
Or you can read the clear descriptions in the next section, which
lays out the basics minus the boring factoids only distillers really
need to know to make sure their product meets U.S. standards.
And of course, each chapter in this book is devoted to a specific
spirit and presents the important facts about the drink.
In essence, the take-away points are:
 No, a distiller can’t just pour some ethanol into a bottle and
call it whiskey or one of the other popular distilled spirits.
 Yes, when you buy your favorite brand, you’re getting a 
standardized product that meets all the relevant government
standards.
The Types of Spirits
All distillates come off the still as clear liquids. How the distiller
processes the liquid determines the taste, smell, and appearance
of the final product.
As a rule, however, all spirits fall into one of two broad categories:
clear spirits and dark spirits. Put in the simplest terms, clear spirits
are the ones you can see though; dark spirits range in color from
warm amber to deep brown.
The clear spirits
All clear spirits are clear, but depending on the foods from which
they were distilled, some have a specific flavor.
 Gin comes in two basic styles. There’s the original Dutch
jenevre (which the French called genievre), a distillate of malt
spirits that include juniper berries. London dry gin is a clear
spirit that’s redistilled with juniper berries and further fla-
vored with aromatic botanicals (plant products).
Chapter 1: Discovering Distilled Spirits 17

Part I: Entering the Spirits World 
18
 Rum is distilled from molasses or sugar cane. All rums start
out as totally clear spirits; some are aged in barrels, a process
described in Chapter 2. Aging turns the rum golden, amber, or
very dark.
 Sake is a clear spirit distilled from rice wine.
 Tequila is distilled from the fruit of the blue agave plant. Like
rum, all tequilas start out clear, but some turn golden or
amber with aging.
 Vodka is a true neutral spirit, crystal clear, with no discernible
flavor or aroma. Modern vodka producers, however, may
flavor their vodkas, changing the taste and sometimes the
color to match the color of the fruit juice or synthetic 
flavoring.
The dark spirits
With the exception of brandy, which is distilled from wine (remem-
ber Geber from earlier in this chapter?), dark spirits are beverages
distilled from grains.
Like clear spirits, the dark spirits start out clear, but aging in 
barrels and the addition of coloring agents such as caramel (burnt
sugar) to maintain color consistency from year to year turns them
characteristically golden amber.
 Brandy is a spirit distilled from wine or a mash (fermented
mass) of any fruit, most commonly grapes.
 Whiskey is a spirit distilled from grain, such as barley, corn,
rye, or wheat. A straight whiskey is made from the distillate
produced by one operation of a still and added neutral spirits.
A blended whiskey contains several straight whiskeys and
added neutral spirits.
 Bourbon and Tennessee Whiskey are distilled spirits made
only in the United States; by law, they must be made of 
51 percent corn.
 Canadian Whisky is a distilled spirit made in Canada, gener-
ally from a mix of grains, primarily corn, plus rye, wheat, and
barley.
 Irish Whiskey is a distilled spirit made in Ireland from a mix
of grains dominated by barley.
 Scotch Whisky is a distilled spirit made in Scotland from a
mix of grains, primarily barley, plus “small grains” — so-called
because they’re used in limited amounts. The small grains
usually include oats.

A Word about the Words
Like other fine craftsmen, distillers cringe when folks describe
their products in derogatory terms.
Prime example: booze. The word comes either from the old 
English word blouse (to drink heavily) or, more likely as the Online
Etymology Dictionary suggests, from the name of early Philadelphia
distiller E.G. Booze. Either way, it’s a no-no in the company of 
serious spirits connoisseurs.
Another no-no is hooch, short for Hoochinoo, the name of a native
Alaskan Tlingit Indian tribe whose distilled spirits were a fave with
miners during the Alaskan Gold Rush. The Merriam Webster Online
Dictionary says this one first popped up around 1880. But it really
took off during Prohibition, possibly because someone discovered
that the tribe’s name comes from an Indian word for grizzly bear
fort and figured that the hooch packed the punch of a big, bad bear.
Or not.
Chapter 1: Discovering Distilled Spirits 19
For spirits, every year is a good year
Unlike wine and with the exception of some brandies, spirits aren’t classified by 
vintage.
For wine, quality and flavor depend to a great extent on the characteristics of the
grapes from which the wine is made. Specifically important is their sugar content,
which may vary from year to year along with the weather.
Distillation, on the other hand, produces a liquid (distillate) free of all sugars; it’s the
still master’s skill, not the weather, that determines the quality of the liquor.
Ditto for aging. Wines age in the bottle as active microorganisms continue to digest
and process residual sugars, maturing and mellowing the flavor of the wine. Spirits,
on the other hand, age only in barrels. After they’re bottled, they are what they are:
Time doesn’t change them.
Yes, some distillers, notably the Scots, promote high-priced specialty whiskies that
have been aged for more than 21 years and proudly display the year in which they
were bottled. But what matters isn’t the year they were bottled, but the time they
spent in the barrel.
Of course, a very old, very rare, and maybe very dusty bottle of whiskey may be
valuable to a collector, but before you plunk down multi-dollars for one of these bot-
tles, remember: Poor storage in varying temperatures, exposure to sunlight, or a
loose cap can turn even the very best spirit unpalatable.

By preventing Americans from enjoying safely made alcohol bever-
ages, Prohibition triggered the production of some fairly nasty
homemade substitutes with equally nasty names. One example is
rot gut, a pretty clear description of what happens to your innards
if you drink alcohol beverages made by careless amateurs.
As for bathtub gin, yes, people really did whip up this stuff in their
bathtubs using medical alcohols and flavorings. Unfortunately, as
the sidebar “Not all alcohol is ‘alcohol’” explains, the alcohols used
in medicinal products, such as rubbing alcohol, aren’t safe to
drink. Which brings us back to — you got it — rot gut, a term that’s
been pretty much discarded now that alcohol beverages are legal
and safe when consumed in moderation.

But that doesn’t stop people from calling spirits hard liquor to 
differentiate them from beer and wine. Actually, because no liquid
is either hard or soft, the more sensible terms are higher proof or
higher ABV (more about that in Chapter 2), descriptions based on
the alcohol content of the beverage.
Finally, the term alcoholic beverages (rather than alcohol beverages
or beverage alcohol) is just plain silly. Who ever heard of a whiskey,
gin, vodka, or whatever, that drank too much whiskey, gin, vodka,
or whatever? No one, that’s who.

How Distilled Spirits 
Are Created
In This Chapter
 Tracking spirits from distiller to consumer
 Exploring the chemistry of distillation
 Defining the still master’s job
 Showing the various stills used in distillation
N
o, this chapter doesn’t explain how to cook up spirits at
home. Even if the United States government didn’t frown on
moonshining (producing distilled spirits without having the
required licenses), you’d still find it difficult, not to mention costly,
to install a still in your basement or garden shed.
Instead, this chapter addresses the Real Deal: the multitudinous
steps a licensed distiller must take from start (“I think I’ll sell a new
vodka.”), to middle (“Wow! The marketing guy’s decision to put it
in a blue bottle is terrific!”), to end (“Here, dear customer, try my
product.”).
It’s a hard job, but somebody has to do it. Luckily, so many people
do it well enough to enable the rest of us to enjoy the fruits (and/or
grains) of their labor.
The Distillation Process 
in a Nutshell
All beverage alcohol — beer, wine, spirits — begins with the action
of microorganisms (yeasts) added to a food-and-water mix, such as
grains and water.

The microorganisms ferment carbohydrates in the food. Translation:
They convert the starches in food and produce a liquid (alcohol), a
gas (carbon dioxide), and flavoring agents (congeners).
For brewers and winemakers, the fermentation process ends when
the microorganisms have digested enough carbohydrates to pro-
duce a liquid that’s 25 percent alcohol, which is much higher than
the concentration of alcohol in most beers and just about right for
a lot of wines.
However, 25 percent alcohol is too low for most distilled spirits. To
obtain sufficient quantities of neutral spirits (the virtually pure alco-
hol used as a base for spirits products), the distiller must distill
the wash (the liquid drained from the food/yeast/water mix) to 
separate out the alcohol.
Distillation is a physical separation process that’s so simple, in
fact, that as you read this, it’s a good bet that somewhere in the
world a freshman student in a chemistry class is heating a liquid
until it boils and watching the steam rise into a collector where it
cools and condenses back into a liquid. But making the alcohol is
only one step in the process that yields distilled spirits.
There are only five steps needed to arrive at a distilled spirit. Here
they are:
 Step 1: Choosing the food from which to distill the alcohol
 Step 2: Preparing the food for distillation
 Step 3: Heating the prepared mixture to produce (distill) a
specific spirit type
 Step 4: Maturing the distilled spirit
 Step 5: Packaging (and shipping) the finished product
Steps 1, 2, 3, and 5 apply to all distilled spirits; some types, such as
vodka, aren’t aged — no Step 4 for them. (I talk about maturing,
called aging, in the “Aging Gracefully” section later in this chapter.)
At every step along the way — from carbs to spirits to you — the
process is monitored by a still master and his assistants (yes, it’s
still a very masculine profession) to make certain that the ethanol
the distiller turns out meets health and safety standards for use in
beverages. The still master totals every ounce of alcohol produced
during each distillation period so that the revenue agents have a
clear record for tax purposes.
Yay team.

Talking the distillation talk
Like all professionals — doctors, lawyers, chemists, wrestlers — distillers have a
language all their own. The following table lists some of the basic vocabulary.
ABV (alcohol by volume)
A measurement term used to describe the concentra-
tion of alcohol in a bottle of beer, wine, or spirits
Batch
Alcohol distilled in one limited run through the still;
also used to describe selecting barrels for use in
making a special product
Congeners
Flavoring agents and alcohols generated by reactions
and procedures in making spirits
Ethanol, ethyl alcohol
The chemical name for the alcohol used in food and
beverages
Fermentation
The process by which microorganisms digest and
convert carbohydrates (sugars and starches) to a
liquid (alcohol) and a gas (carbon dioxide)
Milling
Procedure to strip away the outer covering of grains
used in making distilled spirits
Mash
Soupy mass of fermenting food from which spirits are
distilled; the process of creating a mash is called
mashing
Mash bill
The recipe for amounts and types of foods used in the
mash
Neutral spirits
The ethanol collected and condensed during distilla-
tion at or above 190 proof
Proof
An increasingly outmoded measurement term used to
describe the concentration of alcohol in a bottle of
beer, wine, or spirits
Still
The container in which the alcohol/water liquid from
fermented food is distilled
Still master
The person who determines the “recipe” for a distilled
spirit and who watches over its creation
Wort
Soup of milled and soaked ingredients mixed with
water

The Basic Material for Distilling
Virtually any carbohydrate-rich food can be used as a base from
which to distill alcohol.
With the exception of milk — which contains lactose (milk sugar)
and is often used after it ferments to produce an alcohol beverage
called kumis — foods from animals don’t contain carbs, which is
why nobody’s ever made a chicken, fish, or hamburger whiskey,
gin, or vodka.
Plant foods, on the other hand, are carb rich; grains, fruits, nuts,
seeds, and at one time or another flowers have all been used as the
base for a distilled spirit.
Picking the right food(s) is the job of the still master, who, along
with other members of the distillery staff, is charged with creating
a shopping list called a mash bill, a recipe listing the food(s) to be
used in distilling a specific whiskey, gin, vodka, or other spirit.
In most countries, including the United States, the government
plays a role in drawing up the mash bill, laying down some basic
rules to govern how much of which foods go into what kinds of
spirits. For example, a Bourbon must be distilled from a minimum
of 51 percent corn with the remainder being other grains. What’s in
the balance is left up to the individual distiller, which is why all
Bourbons have a similar flavor with slightly different flavor notes,
depending on the “house style” of the source.
Distillers use neutral spirits in blending dark spirits, such as
whiskey, and to produce clear spirits, such vodka and gin. These
neutral spirits may be distilled from any of the following:
 Any grain, such as barley, corn, rice, rye, or wheat
 Any high carbohydrate food, such as potatoes, agave, sugar
cane, and others
 Fruits, such as grapes for brandy. Unfermented fruits, nuts,
herbs, and seeds are also used as flavoring agents.
Milling and Mashing
Milling and mashing may sound like the name of a really good law
firm, but they’re actually two processes used in creating distilled
spirits. In this example, I use grains because distilling from them is
basic to all other plant and vegetable products used to make
potable spirits.
Part I: Entering the Spirits World 
26

In the first process, the grains that are used as a base for distilling
go through a mill where mechanical rollers, hammers, and/or
grinders break and strip away the husk (outer covering) of the
grain to expose as much of the surface of the grain as possible.
In the second of these two processes, the grains are plunked into
water and mushed into a mash. The water pulls carbs out of the
grains into a solution so that those determined microorganisms
can get to work.
Before distillation can take place, the mash is heated and 
fermented by adding yeast.
Starting the fermentation process
After the grain is mixed into a mash, the mash is heated in a large
vat so that naturally occurring enzymes in the grains (malt
enzymes) soften the grains into a soupy mass called a wort.
Chapter 2: How Distilled Spirits Are Created 27
Warning: Yeasty beasties at work
Sailors crossing the Equator for the first time are often subject to an initiation that
ranges from the fun (being splashed with water) to the more rigorous (actually being
dunked in the ocean).
People visiting a distillery for the first time may also run into a rite of passage. When
they enter the mash room, the distillery guide may open the top of the fermentation
vat and invite the victim, sorry, visitor, to step closer and take a really deep breath.
Ooops.
Gases produced during fermentation collect right under the covering, so that really
deep breath may lead to sudden — but temporary — dizziness.
If the distillery folks offer a taste of the fermenting product, the smart answer is a
polite, “No, thank you.” Why? Because consuming the active yeasts in the vat has
been known to trigger certain gastric discomforts best left to the imagination. In all
fairness, you should know that the folks who work in distilleries do taste the fer-
menting mash without suffering any consequences. Perhaps repeated exposure
acclimates their tummies.
Of course, when the product is finished and bottled, the yeasty beasties are gone,
leaving a delicious and totally drinkable liquid. Pick up a bottle as you leave:
Sampling the finished spirit inside is far and away the best way to remember your
distillery visit.

The wort is then pumped into a large vat called a mash tun. The
mash tun may be either a wooden container with an open top or a
steel or copper container with a closed top. Either way, the bottom
of the tun is a strainer through which the liquid flows from the
mash into a separate container (the fermentation tank). Protein-
rich residue is left atop the strainer in the mash tun, and it’s 
compacted and used as animal feed.
Bringing on the micros
Now the still master adds microorganisms — the yeasts — to the
liquid in the fermentation tank. Two kinds of yeast work together
at this point:
 Cultivated yeast: Distillers guard their cultivated yeasts as
closely as Fort Knox to prevent the competition from stealing
the strain and preserving it in temperature-controlled splen-
dor for future growth for generations (of yeasts).
 Wild yeast: These yeasts enhance flavor differences even in
products from distilleries located within short distances
apart. Wild yeasts are a lot less trouble to handle than their
often richer relatives, cultivated yeasts. Leave the fermenta-
tion tank open and zap, you’ve got local yeasts dropping in to
help out. Although still masters don’t often talk about it,
there’s a difference in yeasts. It’s tough fitting these uncon-
trolled rascals into the ultimate taste profile desired, but
adding complexity is often worth the effort.
Almost immediately, the yeasts go to work digesting carbohydrates
in the liquid, emitting alcohol and carbon dioxide. As the carbon
dioxide rises to the surface, the solution bubbles. Poetic distillers
may describe this phenomenon as “the dance of life.” You can call
it — what else? — fermentation.
As the yeasts continue to digest the carbs, the amount of alcohol
in the liquid steadily rises. When the alcohol concentration
reaches 3 percent, the still master transfers the liquid — now
known as distiller’s beer — from the fermentation tank into the still
for the main event: distillation.
Distilling: The Main Event
In the distillery, the distiller pours or pumps the water/alcohol
mash from the fermentation tank into the still (a vessel used for
distillation) and heats the still until the liquid inside boils.
Part I: Entering the Spirits World 
28

Because alcohol boils at a lower temperature than water, vapors
from the alcohol rise first, to be collected and condensed as liquid
ethyl alcohol, the alcohol used in beverages. The alcohol produced
in the still is also known as neutral spirits because it’s free (or rela-
tively free) of flavoring and aroma compounds.
The modern still master works with two distinct types of stills:
|the pot still and the column still.
The pot still
The first pot still was the alembic still used by the Arabs who
invented distillation sometime during the 11th century CE (for
more on the historic discovery and the men who accomplished it,
turn to Chapter 1).
The classic alembic still is a simple copper pot with a rounded
bottom and an elongated spout (or swan’s neck) on top that tradi-
tionally ends in a twisted coil called the worm.
So perfect is the design that modern distillers still use the alembic
still centuries after it was designed. The process goes something
like this:
1. A distillers pours his mash into the pot still.
2. He heats the vessel over an open fire.
3. The fire sends the alcohol vapors up into the swan’s neck.
Chapter 2: How Distilled Spirits Are Created 29
Distillation: Up close and personal
Here’s a Mr. Wizard–like experiment for you:
Put 1 cup of plain water in a small (1-quart) pot with its own lid.
Put the lid on the pot, put the pot on the stove, and heat the pot until you can hear
the water boiling inside. (Yes, if you listen really carefully, you can hear the boil.)
Let the water boil for a minute or so.
Turn off the heat, and lift the lid off the pot.
See the drops of water on the underside of the pot lid? That water is steam that rose
from the boiling water to collect and condense as (huzzah!) distilled water.
Ain’t science grand?

4. The vapors go into a water-cooled condenser or jacket.
5. In the condenser, the vapors are condensed into liquid
alcohol.
6. The liquid alcohol runs out of the worm into a waiting 
container.
What pot stills are used for
The pot still turns out relatively small amounts of alcohol. As a
result, modern distillers most commonly reserve it for batch 
distilling, the distillation of limited amounts of alcohol to make
hand-crafted spirits. These spirits are small quantities of what the
still master considers unusual (read: unusually good) brandies,
Bourbons, Irish and Scotch whiskeys, vodkas, rums, and gins. You
can see the modern pot still in Figure 2-1.
Figure 2-1: The modern pot still.
With the increased interest in whiskey and other types of distilled
spirits, a growing number of small distilleries have sprung up
around the United States doing all their production on pot stills.
Pot stills also are used by mass market operations to produce spir-
its that offer a more complex or deeper flavor to particular brands.
Part I: Entering the Spirits World 
30

One example of this is Brown-Forman’s Woodford Reserve
Kentucky Bourbon, which is made exclusively on pot stills. As a
result, sampling craft whiskeys and other spirits — whether from
giant distilleries or limited production brewpubs or wineries — can
be an exciting experiment. Of course it can also be a waste of time
and money.
The American Distilling Institute is a good source of information
for fans of hand-crafted spirits. The Institute publishes its own
newsletter (American Distiller), runs conferences on craft distilling,
and maintains a list of reputable, fully licensed craft distillers. You

How pot stills work
To use a pot still, today’s distiller pumps the liquid from the fer-
mentation tank into the still; applies heat via piped-in steam, coils,
or an open fire under the still; and then collects the liquid that
forms as the alcohol vapors rise through the condenser (the
worm).
Actually, the distiller goes through this process twice: Distilling
alcohol with a modern pot still means distilling in two pot stills
(and sometimes three). They’re called wash stills and spirits stills
depending on when they’re used in the distillation process.
The trip through the first pot still
The liquid that comes off the first still, or wash still, is called 
low wine. Low wines are suitable for making spirit products
because they contain substantial amounts of compounds called
congeners, which are formed during fermentation.
The primary congeners are
 Aromatic esters: Aroma compounds formed by chemical reac-
tions between alcohol and acids
 Aldehydes: Flavor and aroma compounds formed by chemical
reactions between alcohol and oxygen
 Fusel oils (from the German word fusel, which translates to
the English rot gut): Highly flavored alcohols that can be found
in alcohol distilled at less than 190 proof and used only in
very small quantities, if at all
Chapter 2: How Distilled Spirits Are Created 31

To obtain the alcohol he needs to make a good-tasting, pleasant-
smelling, safe bottle of distilled spirits, the still master must elimi-
nate all or most of these congeners. The amount of congeners the
still master allows in the alcohol depends on the product in which
the alcohol will be used; whiskeys have some congeners, vodkas
have virtually none (and some claim no flavor at all).
The trip through the second pot still
The distiller pours or pumps the low wine from the wash still into a
smaller spirits still. Once again, the still is heated, and the alcohol
vapors rise to be collected and condensed into liquid alcohol
called the distillate.
The distillate comes off the still in three distinct phases:
 Phase 1: The foreshots (or heads) of the batch are low-boiling
compounds generally not fit to drink.
 Phase 2: The potable spirits (or mid-cut) of the batch is the
alcohol you can drink.
 Phase 3: The feints or tails of the batch are unpleasant, oily,
smelly, bad-tasting compounds that would make the product,
well, oily, smelly, and bad-tasting.
How the still master earns his big bucks
The still master’s job is to collect the distillate at exactly the right
moment. In other words, like Goldilocks and her Three Bears,
whose chairs, beds, and bowls were “too big, too small, and just
right,” the still master must contend with distillates that are too
early, too late, and just right.
These “just right” potable spirits are set aside to be bottled
unblended just as they are or blended with other spirits of the
same type. The too-early foreshots and too-late feints are poured
back into the spirits still and put through again with the next run of
low wines.
The three-phase process is repeated until the distiller has the
amount of potable spirits — with the precise amount of flavoring
and aroma congeners — that he needs to make his product. The
residue left in the still at the end, called spent lees, is discarded.
Then the pot still is cleaned, and soon enough the whole process
begins again.

32

The column still
Column stills were invented in the 19th century to enable distillers
to meet the growing demand for distilled spirits.
The column still’s greater capacity remains its greatest virtue. Its
second selling point is that, unlike the pot still, it doesn’t have to
be cleaned at the end of a distillation — a point that anyone who’s
ever wanted to throw out the dinner dishes rather than wash them
one more darned time will appreciate.
As a result, the column still predominates in large commercial dis-
tilleries in producing just about any type of mass-market spirit
from whiskey to rum and certainly vodka. Figure 2-2 shows a dia-
gram of a typical column still.
Working the column still
The column still itself is an enormous piece of equipment that has
two huge stainless steel or copper cylinders that may stand as
high as a three-story building.
Inside each cylinder are perforated, heated copper or steel plates
placed evenly apart. The plates at the top of the first column in the
still are cooler than the plates farther down the column. As a
result, when the alcohol/water wash from the fermentation tank is
pumped into the column, the alcohol — which has a lower boiling
point than water — boils first, producing vapors that collect near
the top of the column. The vapors at the top of the column move
into a cooled condenser tube where they turn back into liquid alco-
hol, spilling down the tube to an opening at the bottom of the
second column in the still.
If two columns are used, the second column also has heated, perfo-
rated copper or stainless steel plates that are hotter at the bottom
and cooler at the top. As the alcohol enters the second column, it’s
Chapter 2: How Distilled Spirits Are Created 33
Beauty is as beauty does
Copper pot stills with their graceful “swan necks” are often beloved by their still
masters, who are likely to give the pot a pet name such as “Old Bess” or “General
Lee.” Kinda makes ya feel warm all over, doesn’t it?

again heated. The alcohol vapors rise to an opening near the
middle of the second column and flow through the opening to a
cooling condenser tube. From there, they spill as distillate into a
holding vat. (As with the pot still, the still master must choose the
“just right” distillate with which to make his spirits product; see
the earlier section, “How the still master earns his big bucks,” for
more info.)
Figure 2-2: The column still.
And then the distiller pours more wash into the first column, and
the whole process continues without interruption. Remember:
There’s no need to clean the column still between distillation ses-
sions, which, of course, is why the column still is also known as the
continuous still.
Two columns or three?
Like the pot still, the column still produces foreshots, potable spir-
its, and feints. The potable spirits are drawn off for use in spirits
products. The flavor and aroma of the potable spirits can vary with
the amount of congeners remaining in the liquid.
Part I: Entering the Spirits World 
34

To remove as many congeners as possible, some distillers — 
usually those making vodkas — put their wash through a still with
three columns. This procedure makes it possible for them to label
the finished product as triple distilled, which is a fancy way of
saying, “Hey, our still has a third column and yours doesn’t.”
Does removing more congeners through the extra column make a
better product? If better means more flavorful or safer to drink, 
the answer is no. On the other hand, if better means less flavor and
virtually no aroma, the answer is yes. In other words, for a distiller
making vodka, triple distilling may make sense. For those making
whiskey, the two-column column still is just dandy.
Aging Gracefully
All neutral spirits flow colorless from the still, but they can still
have a lot of flavor — sometimes with a natural but unpleasant
“bite” that makes your mouth pucker (sort of like biting into a
lemon). Allowing the distillates to rest and age with others in a fin-
ished blend or alone for a while in wooden barrels and casks
smoothes away the bite caused by excessive tannins (bitter flavor
compounds found in plants). Because of the intimacy among 
the spirits in the barrel, it’s called marrying. Rarely is a divorce
necessary.
Aging in a wooden barrel or cask is a legal requirement for any
dark spirit such as whiskey or rum. A little aging — enough to
smooth the bite but not to add flavor, aroma, or color — may also
benefit vodka, but it isn’t a legal requirement.
Chapter 2: How Distilled Spirits Are Created 35
Coffey’s still
In Ireland the column still is often called the Coffey still in honor of Aneas Coffey. In
1832, as the Inspector General of the Irish Excise, he came up with the idea for a new
still large enough to increase production of whiskeys. Coffey went into partnership
with a Scottish engineer named Robert Stein, a member of the Haig family of the
Haig & Haig distillery. Together they patented their design for the column still, which
is why this still is also known as the patent still.
As a side note, when reading the previous paragraph, did you catch the fact that
the men who invented a new way to make alcohol were named Coffey and Stein, the
latter being the name for a beer mug?
What a small (and fascinating) world . . .

As the spirits age in the barrels, some alcohol and water evapo-
rates; distillers commonly call the alcohol lost to evaporation the
“angels’ share.”
Oxygen flowing through the porous barrel triggers chemical reac-
tions that promote the formation of flavor and aroma. The spirits
absorb specific flavor, aroma, and color compounds from the wood
itself or from the previous contents of the barrel. For example,
whiskeys aged in casks that once held sherry or port absorb some
of the sweetness of these wines.
This absorption of some flavors and aromas occurs immediately in
the barrel. But other compound extractions and oxidation take
place at various times, some early “in the wood,” and others later.
In the first two years of aging, the changes in the spirit depend to a
large extent on how much color, flavor, and aroma are in the wood
itself.
In the end, what goes into the barrels as a relatively sharp-tasting,
clear liquid emerges smooth, flavorful, and glowing amber to rich
dark brown in color.
The classic oak barrel
Distillers use different kinds of wood to form the barrels in which
they age their spirits. For example, in Japan, sake is sometimes
aged in cedar barrels to give the products an unusual piney flavor.
But the favorite wood by far is the noble oak — that is, the
American oak in the United States, Spanish oak (sherry) casks, and
Limousin oak from France.
No one knows for sure exactly why the Romans chose oak wood to
make the first spirit aging barrels or why early distillers decided to
think that was the only way to go. Maybe oak trees were the most
abundant and thus the best renewable source of wood. Maybe oak
was the easiest wood to work into barrels — flexible, strong, and
resilient. Or maybe someone noticed strictly by accident that 
spirits aged in plain oak barrels just plain tasted better.
Fancy oak is good, too. For making American whiskeys, the law dic-
tates that the inside of the barrel must be charred before use. The
depth of the char depends on the desired flavor profile. As you
might expect, the charred wood yields more flavor, aroma, and
color than bare wood does.
Part I: Entering the Spirits World 
36

Other distillers, notably the Scots, age their spirits in barrels once
used for sherry or American oak once used to age Bourbon. Aha,
you may say, the thrifty Scots are minding their pennies by reusing
the barrels. Well, yes. But as I note in the previous section — and
explain more fully in Chapter 5 — the sherry-impregnated barrels
also lend a certain flavor distinction to the new spirits.
In addition to contributing to flavor and smoothness, the distiller
must decide what kind of wood to use in light of its porosity (allow-
ing oxygen to join in the ceremony). Several other economic and
technical factors keep the interaction between barrel and its 
contents active for a specific period of time.
Is getting older always better?
Is getting older always better? To a point. A touch of aging benefits
most spirits, including clear spirits such as vodka, by reducing the
original bite. But aging a vodka is a distiller’s choice. Aging a
whiskey is mandatory. For example, in the U.S., Bourbon must be
aged for at least four years before it can be bottled. Scotch
whisky’s minimum aging is three years; however, tradition says
that the longer it rests in the barrel, the tastier it will be. Many
Scotch whisky distillers disagree. The common wisdom seems to
be that after 21 years, the whisky begins to lose some flavor notes.
If that supposition is true, then why is it that older whiskies have a
greater value in the marketplace? There’s a lesson there.
Blending Science with Art
The road to perfection in making a spirit product is long and some-
times difficult. Establishing a flavor profile is just the beginning.
Choices must be made all along the way, from the mash used to the
yeasts used to when to end the distillation to the type of barrel
used and then to the final taste in the bottle. With so many deci-
sions, it’s possible that tasting the spirit when it’s aging in the
barrel may convince a tasting panel that something is missing.
Whereas a chef may be asked to add a pinch of salt, in the case of
spirits, the suggestion is most likely to be, “How about adding
something from Barrel 1,234?”
Agreement is reached, and the product in one barrel is enhanced
by adding some of the contents of another barrel laid down on the
aging warehouse shelf in a different year, at a different time of year,
in different barrel wood, and even with a different still master tem-
perament that day.
Chapter 2: How Distilled Spirits Are Created 37

After the blend is decided on, the spirit is once again married to
make certain that the flavor is truly blended. And that’s the art
connected with the science of distillation.
Samuel Bronfman (1889–1971) is the man who created and built
The Seagram Company, Limited, which was once the world’s
largest maker and marketer of distilled spirits. Bronfman was
widely respected for introducing blended whiskeys to North
America after the repeal of National Prohibition in the United
States (for more on blending and other facets of a revolutionary
whiskey, turn to Chapter 7).
It wasn’t an accident. Bronfman’s mantra, repeated to every new
(and old) member of the Seagram team, was simple: “Distilling is a
science. Blending is an art.”
Even today, some still masters would disagree. They hold that the
only “artistic” spirit is unblended; that the real art is to create a
high quality spirit that needs no other spirit, color, or flavor to
make it consistent and to make it good. You decide who’s right.
Straight spirits
When the still master pumps his distillates into barrels for aging,
he pumps in one distillate from several runs of the still into each
barrel. If this distillate (plus water to lower the alcohol content) is
left to age on its own and is then bottled on its own, the product is
a straight spirit (by U.S. standards).
Straight spirits are products whose flavor and aroma may vary
subtly from batch to batch, depending on such variables as
 The grain from which the spirit was distilled
 The exact moment the distillates came off the still
 The barrel in which the spirit was aged
As a result, straight spirits from a reputable distiller can be an
exciting taste experience for those who appreciate trying some-
thing new and unusual, rather like tasting vintage wines. Blended
spirits are more consistent in flavor because they adhere to a set
recipe.
Blended spirits
The alternative to a straight spirit is a blended spirit, such as a
blended whiskey.
Part I: Entering the Spirits World 
38

To make a blended whiskey, the still master mixes together in one
barrel distillates from several runs of the still, several different 
barrels, or even barrels from other distilleries and allows them to
age together.
Blended spirits are designed to maintain a brand’s distinctive 
character by delivering the same flavor and aroma characteristics
batch after batch after batch.
Chapter 2: How Distilled Spirits Are Created 39
Proving the point
No alcohol comes off any still totally free of water, and all alcohol beverages are
alcohol plus water; wine and beer also contain some residue of the foods from
which they were made.
The label on every bottle of wine and spirits describes the alcohol content of the
liquid inside with the term alcohol by volume (ABV). (For reasons too complicated
to discuss in fewer than, say, 50 pages, beer containers may carry this information,
but U.S. law doesn’t require that they do.)
ABV measures the amount of alcohol as a percentage of all the liquid in the con-
tainer. For example, if the container holds 10 ounces of liquid and 1 ounce of that is
alcohol, the product is 10% ABV — the alcohol content (1 ounce) divided by the
total amount of liquid (10 ounces).
An older term for describing alcohol content is proof, which is a measurement equal
to two times ABV. For example, an alcohol beverage that’s 10 percent ABV is 
20 proof.
The word proof (in regard to alcohol beverages) derives from a series of experi-
ments sometimes credited to an unknown 17th or 18th century British naval officer
desirous of making sure British sailors got the full measure of alcohol in their daily
tot of rum. The officer, or maybe someone more scientifically credentialed, tried
dampening gunpowder with the beverage and then setting the stuff on fire. After
much trial and error (and several scorched walls), the naval officer or his scientific
alter ego determined that no flame meant no alcohol in the bottle, while a slow-
burning flame showed that the spirits were “at proof” (50 percent alcohol in the
liquid). If the flame sort of sputtered and died, the alcohol beverage was deemed
underproof; a bright yellow flame signified overproof.
That eyeballing way to measure alcohol content went out in the 19th century with
the invention of scientific instruments to measure the specific gravity of liquids.
Appearance of ABV on bottle labels is a recent innovation, with producers given
the option of using either proof, proof and ABV, or ABV alone for a few years until
2003 when ABV was made the totally official, absolutely standard label term. Of
course, distillers are allowed to also show the level of alcohol in the bottle in terms
of proof if they so desire.

The recipe the still master uses to create blended whiskey is 
(as you might expect) a very closed industrial secret, guarded with
the still master’s life. Or at least with serious discretion.
Bottle, Bottle, Who’s 
Got the Bottle?
The last step in the production of spirits is bottling.
Choosing a model bottle
According to the Food Marketing Institute, a trade organization for
the nation’s food markets, in 2005 the average American supermar-
ket carried 45,000 different products.
The average liquor store has fewer bottles than that, but you still
see plenty of brands in all different sized bottles vying for your
attention whenever you step into the spirits section. As a result,
the distiller’s job is to make sure his product yells “buy me” louder
than the next one on the shelf. And that means making his bottles
as attractive as possible.
To that end, a designer makes a clay model of the bottle for any
new product (older products are presumably as attractive as they
can be). If the distiller approves it, the designer makes a mold from
the model and produces test bottles. If the distiller approves again,
the designer sends the mold off to the glass factory to be manufac-
tured. The bottles come back and, at last, the end of the distilling
process is really in sight. Sometimes the bottle may even be tested
on a random sample of consumers called a focus group. The win-
ning bottle shows up down there at the end of the bottling line.
The bottling line
Pay attention, watch your fingers, and keep your eye on the moving
bottles. This part of the distillery-to-you process really zips along.
First, cases of empty bottles are delivered to the distillery. The
cases are opened and placed upside down on a conveyor belt so
that the bottles slip out (still upside down) while the cases go off
to wait for the filled bottles.
Part I: Entering the Spirits World 
40

Next, the upside-down bottles ride along the conveyor belt to be
cleaned and sanitized with a compressed air/vacuum/suction
device that swooshes out any stray particles.
After that, the cleaned bottles, now right side up, move along to
the part of the conveyor belt where jets above the conveyor belt
squirt spirits into the bottles, filling them to precisely the right
level. No muss, no fuss, no expensive waste.
Now the bottles move on to the capper, which is exactly what it
sounds like: the device that either corks the bottle, or, more likely,
screws on the top.
After they’re sealed, the bottles continue along to the label station,
where paper labels are applied with glue. (Sometimes a label is
already etched or silk screened onto the glass and this step is
skipped.) If the labels are glued on, the next step is a pass through
a machine that’s something like a carwash, where pads press the
label in place and swinging brushes clear away any excess glue.
Chapter 2: How Distilled Spirits Are Created 41
PET project
Glass is still the most popular material for spirits bottles, but within the last 20 years,
the U.S. government has also approved the use of bottles made of PET (polyethyl-
ene terephthalte). This is a plastic that doesn’t affect the flavor or quality of the spirit
inside, weighs less than glass, is less easily broken, and can be colored or frosted
or have the label printed right on the surface of the bottle.
Of course, governments being what they are, they didn’t just say “go for it” on PET.
In fact, they wrote strict regulations. According to Title 27 of the Code of Federal
Regulations, Alcohol, Tobacco Products, and Firearms, PET used for spirits bottles
in the U.S. must
 Be a molded rigid or semi-rigid material
 Have uniformly thick walls
 Be made in an approved process
 Meet U.S. Food and Drug Administration health and safety standards
 Permit the evaporation of no more than 0.25 percent alcohol by volume (ABV)
during bottling for spirits sold in 50 ml and 100 ml bottles
 Permit the evaporation of no more than 0.15 percent alcohol by volume (ABV)
during bottling for all other spirits

From there, it’s a short trip to the case-packer, where the appropri-
ate number of bottles (varying by size, of course) is packed 
into the appropriate cases (varying by size, of course).
And that’s it. Distilling’s done.
Part I: Entering the Spirits World 
42
Size matters
Old timers may still ask for a fifth or a quart or a mini — terms for spirit bottle sizes
used in the United States from Prohibition Repeal until the 1980s. At that time, the
Americans decided to join their British and Continental fellows in measuring their
foods and beverage products in metric terms.
Most food products continued to be sold in the familiar ounces, pounds, and quarts,
but in 1982 the Treasury Department’s Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms
(BATF), now called the Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB), specifically required distillers
to repackage their products in bottles conforming to metric sizes.
In 1994, the Food and Drug Administration amended the Fair Packaging and Labeling
Act to require dual units — ounces, pounds, or quarts plus metric — on all con-
sumer products. But distillers are still the only ones who absolutely have to use
metric.
Some consumers, believing that metric measures gave them less product for the
buck, were unhappy. Complaints to distillers rose for a while, but as the new meas-
ures settled into the national consciousness, the furor abated and a liter became as
cozy a term as a quart had been.
And surprisingly enough, consumers got an even better bargain, monetarily speak-
ing, because a liter is actually larger than a quart. Who knew?
The following table shows the comparisons.

In This Chapter
 Preparing for a tasting
 Discovering the rules of tasting
 Understanding your senses
 Evaluating distilled spirits
T
he basic rules for tasting spirits are pretty much the same as
those for tasting any food or drink: Choose your samples, taste
them, and decide which you like best.
Fine distilled spirits are a pleasure to the senses. To enjoy them,
you need to bring to the tasting table a set of tools — the product
you plan to sample; the perfect tasting glass; and, of course, your
body with its incredible sensory organs.
Novice or expert, this chapter lays out the “Rules of the Ritual” for
you to enjoy. These rituals include choosing spirits, picking
glasses, and creating a tasting sheet to record your impressions of
each product you sample.
Assembling the Accoutrements
Yes, assembling the accoutrements is a fancy French way of saying
“What follows is a list of the equipment you need to run a success-
ful tasting.” You need to select the spirits for tasting and present
them in an organized way to maximize your guests’ enjoyment. In
this section, I tell you what accoutrements you need and give you
tips on setting up a tasting to remember.

Choosing your spirit
Clearly, you’re the best authority on which spirit to feature at your
tasting. After you make that decision, the question is how many dif-
ferent types you want to try. That decision depends on the spirit
you’re tasting and the type of tasting you plan to run.
Selecting spirits by type
Tasting Irish whiskeys? Then you probably want one from each of
Ireland’s three major distilleries: Midleton, Bushmills, and Cooley
(for more on each, check out Chapter 4).
Aiming for Scotch? Clearly, you want at least one single malt
whisky and one blended whisky. More ambitious tasters may want
five single malts, one from each of the Scotch whisky-making
regions listed in Chapter 5, plus at least one blended Scotch. Or,
you may just want to compare blends of Scotch.
Similar rules apply to your choice of other types of distilled spirits;
for the details, check out the appropriate chapters.
When choosing spirits for your tasting, less may well be more. In
other words, pick three — or, at the most, five — rather than 
30. Your sense of smell and taste operate more efficiently when you
have fewer choices (I give you more details later in this chapter).
Save the others for your next tasting. And the one after that.
Selecting spirits by the type of tasting
Experts describe the tasting ritual as either a vertical tasting or a
horizontal tasting. No, a vertical tasting is not a tasting you do while
standing up. It’s a tasting that compares different products from
the same distillery. For example, Powers and Jameson are Irish
whiskeys from the Midleton distillery. But each has its own distinc-
tive character; comparing the two shows how one distiller can
vary his style.
A horizontal tasting, on the other hand, compares similar prod-
ucts, such as vodkas or single malt whiskeys, from different dis-
tillers. Once again using Irish whiskeys as an example, your choice
of unblended whiskeys may include Midleton (Midleton),
Bushmills Single Malt (Bushmills), and Connemara (Cooley).
Comparing these three whiskeys shows different styles from differ-
ent distilleries.

Tasting the very special stuff
Few whiskey aficionados have the pocket change required to plan
a tasting around unusual bottlings like these:
 The Macallan Fine and Rare Collection, 1926, 60 years 
old. Forbes magazine pegged this Scotch at $38,000 a bottle 
in 2004.
 Chivas Regal Royal Salute, 50 years old. At $10,000, this
Scotch costs less than a third of the price of the Macallan, but
it may still be out of your price range.
 Springbank, 32 years old. A bottle of this Campbletown single
malt Scotch has a three-digit price tag of $750.
Even if you decide that these whiskies are worth saving your pen-
nies, good luck finding a bottle.
But the hefty price tag of these bottles doesn’t mean that you can’t
taste some very special whiskeys at your favorite swanky bar or
plain old neighborhood tavern.
Walk in. Study the line-up of bottles on the back bar. Accept the
fact that you may not know which of them is the finest and ask the
barkeep to suggest, say, three for tasting. And be real about it: If
the whiskeys are very, very expensive — even by the drink —
settle for two. Then taste, savor, and dream of the day when you,
too, are a cyber-billionaire with all these very, very expensive 
bottles lined up in your very own living room.
Setting the tasting table
You wouldn’t sit guests down to dinner without plates, flatware,
and glasses, would you? Same thing goes for a tasting. Before your
tasting begins, put the following items in the center of the table
where everyone can reach them:
 The spirits bottles. Open each bottle, and remove the cork or
closure to allow the spirit to air out, or more correctly, to
allow air in for a while before you start the tasting. The air
enables the spirits to open, which is tasting talk for “the mole-
cules mix with air and bounce about, intensifying both the
flavor and aroma.”
Chapter 3: Enjoying Spirits 45

For a really sophisticated tasting — experts only need apply —
cover the original labels with stick-on labels numbered 1, 2, 3,
and so on, and then challenge the tasters to identify the 
products.
 Pitcher of fresh, cold water. The water, used for diluting the
spirits during the tasting, should be still (no bubbly, please)
and as mineral-free as possible to avoid compromising the
flavor of the spirits.
 Unflavored crackers. Plain Melba toast nicely cleanses your
palate — that is, it gets rid of the taste of one spirits sample
before you move on to the next.
 Spit bucket. An empty paper ice bucket is fine.
The communal spit bucket and crackers are okay; a small indi-
vidual spit bucket and stack of crackers at each place setting
is classy.
To continue setting the table for your tasting, put the following at
each place setting:
 A shot glass. Use this 1- to 1.5-ounce glass to measure the
spirits for tasting. No shot glass? Use your kitchen measuring
cup, which may be even more precise.
 A tasting glass. The ideal tasting glass is a snifter, a glass that
narrows toward the top, collecting the aroma molecules so
that you get a really good sample when you stick your nose
into the glass.
On the other hand, perfection sometimes must bow to reality:
If you don’t have snifters, 12-ounce lowball glasses (see the
“Avoiding glass warfare” section later in this chapter) will do.
But no plastic and no paper cups; these materials add aromas
and flavors of their own, compromising those of the spirits.
Note: Ordinarily, the taster rinses the glass between samples.
Lots of glasses make things easier.
 Napkins. For the inevitable spill or dribble, of course.
Creating the tasting sheet
The tasting sheet is a record of your personal evaluation of each
spirit you taste. Table 3-1 shows a sample tasting sheet that you
can copy or adapt as you see fit. The section “Getting to the Good
Part” delves into the elements you evaluate on the tasting sheet.

Getting to the Good Part
At least three of your five senses — sight, smell, and taste — play
an important role in your evaluation of the spirits. Some people
say that touch also plays a role, as in the pleasure of holding a
well-made crystal glass, and that the sound of the spirit flowing or
splashing into the glass may also set your senses a-jangle. Could
be. But, in truth, the eyes, nose, and tongue do most of the work.
Let the tasting begin!
Enjoying the view: Color and legs
Begin by pouring 1 ounce of one of the spirits into the tasting
glass. Let the glass sit quietly for a few minutes, once again to
allow the spirits to open (see the earlier section, “Setting the tast-
ing table,” for more information on letting the spirits open).
While you wait, observe the liquid. Your eyes may be the windows
to the soul, but they’re also the gateway to the stomach: If food
doesn’t look good, the body says, “Who me? Eat that? No way.” For
example, imagine a dish of creamy mashed potatoes, topped with a
dollop of butter. Yummy. Now imagine those potatoes colored dark
green. Yuck. Or, more on point, imagine a glass of warm, amber
whiskey. Lovely. Now imagine that dark green. Not!
In fact, various experiments with truly tolerant volunteers have
shown that simply seeing something that looks yummy can send
sensory messages to your brain that trigger the transmission of
similar messages to other parts of your body. Message to the sali-
vary glands: Start secreting saliva to dissolve the food or dilute the
drink. Message to the stomach: Start secreting gastric juices to
digest what’s coming.
In short, the first step toward tasting isn’t putting something into
your mouth: It’s seeing something you want to put into your mouth.
In distilled spirits, color is a guide to how long the product has
been aged. Most gins, rums, and vodkas are perfectly clear. The
exceptions are slightly aged gins, aged rums, and vodkas with
added flavor/coloring.
On the other hand, the color of whiskey ranges from warm gold to
amber to the dark brown the Yanks call molasses and the Brits call
treacle. As a general rule, the darker the color, the longer the
whiskey has aged in the barrel and the greater the malted grain
content of the mash from which the whiskey was distilled.
Part I: Entering the Spirits World 
48

Note the color of the spirit on your tasting sheet (check out Fig-
ure 3-1 for an example of a tasting sheet), and move on to the
second sight criterion: legs.
Body is defined as the consistency of the spirit. The best way to
evaluate body is to put the glass flat on the table and swirl it so that
the spirit spirals up the inside surface of the glass and then slides
down again, leaving a trail (known in the trade as legs) as it goes.
Watch how fast the liquid runs down the side of the glass to pool
again at the bottom. A spirit that runs down slowly is more viscous
(thicker) than one that runs down quickly. Viscosity is a product of
aging, so the slower the spirit runs down the sides of your glass,
the older it is.
I cover more about body in the upcoming section on how the 
spirits feel in your mouth.
The nose knows
When it comes to tasting, your nose is right up there with your
eyes. Simply inhaling the lovely aromas of food and drink sends
sensory messages to your brain to alert the rest of you that some-
thing good is coming.
The proof of the pudding, sorry, the tasting, is that when you can’t
smell, you can’t really taste. As anyone who’s ever had a cold
knows, when your nose is stuffed and your sense of smell is dead-
ened, almost everything tastes like plain cotton. Even if your taste
buds are working like gangbusters.
So go ahead, stick your nose right into the glass and take a deep
breath to inhale the aromas.
With the exception of most vodkas, whose claim to fame is no
aroma at all, good spirits smell, well, good. Each spirit has charac-
teristic aromas of its own. Take your time. With patience and prac-
tice, you can learn to identify the characteristics of each type of
spirit. (For a guide to the aromas associated with each spirit, check
out the appropriate chapter.)
Actually inhaling the liquid into your nose is a serious breach of
tasting etiquette — and it’s also physically unpleasant.
Chapter 3: Enjoying Spirits 49

The tasting technique
At last! You set up your tasting, poured your first spirit, and took
note of its color, legs, and aroma. Now it’s time to check out the
flavor. Take a small sip of the first spirit plus a little air. The best way

Budding tastes
Taste buds are tiny bumps on the surface of your tongue, sensory organs that enable
you to perceive different flavors in food — in other words, to taste the food and bev-
erages you eat and drink.
Each taste bud contains groups of receptor cells that anchor an antenna-like struc-
ture called a microvillus, which projects up through a gap in the center of the taste
bud, sort of like a thread sticking through the hole in a Lifesaver candy.
The microvilli in your taste buds transmit flavor signals from food along nerve fibers
to your brain. Then those nerve fibers translate the signals into perceptions: “Oh,
wow, that’s good,” or “Man, that’s awful.”
Taste buds recognize four basic flavors: sweet, sour, bitter, and salty. Some people
add a fifth basic flavor to this list: umami, a Japanese word used to describe rich-
ness or a savory flavor associated with soy products such as tofu.
Early on, scientists thought that everyone had specific taste buds for specific flavors:
sweet taste buds for sweets, sour taste buds for sour, and so on. Today, the pre-
vailing theory is that groups of taste buds work together so that flavor chemicals in
food link up with chemical bonds in taste buds to create patterns you recognize as
sweet, salty, bitter, sour, and umami. The technical term for this process is a cross
fiber pattern theory of gustatory coding.
Combining foods can short-circuit your taste buds’ ability to identify flavors cor-
rectly. For example, sip a brandy, Bourbon, Scotch, vodka, whatever, even an appar-
ently smooth and silky one, and your taste buds say, “Hey, that alcohol’s sharp.” But
take a bite of cheese first, and the spirits will taste smoother (less acidic) because
the cheese’s fat molecules coat the receptor cells in your taste buds so that the
acidic alcohol molecules can’t connect.
A similar phenomenon occurs in serial spirits tastings (tasting many spirits, one after
another). Try two equally acidic spirits and the second will seem mellower because
acid molecules from the first one have filled the space on the chemical bonds that
perceive acidity.
Here’s another way to fool your taste buds: Eat a globe artichoke. The “meat” at the
base of the artichoke leaves contains cynarin, a sweet-tasting chemical that dis-
solves in water, including your saliva. Any food you taste after the artichoke will
taste sweeter. Try it. You may like it.

do this is the classic slurp — a sort of sip-plus-inhale. And, yes, the
strange sounds you make while slurping are acceptable at tastings.
After you evaluate the spirit, spit it out in the provided spit bucket.
After spitting out the first taste, take a cracker, and move on to
tasting the spirits with water. Make note of the differences in fla-
vors between the plain spirits and the spirits-plus-water, and
decide which pleases your palate. Remember, there is no “correct”
decision — just your own personal preference. Not quite sure what
words to use? Table 3-2 is an expert’s guide.
When you’re done with spirits #1 and spirits #1-plus-water, take a
plain cracker and a sip of plain water to cleanse your palate and
move on to sample #2.
Sip. Evaluate. Spit. Note. Sip. Evaluate. Spit. Note . . . and so on.
Describing what you’re tasting
The taste of the spirit comprises two distinct characteristics,
mouthfeel and flavor. Mouthfeel is the texture of the liquid in your
mouth, an attribute similar to body (for more info on this quality,
refer to the “Enjoying the view: Color and legs” section, earlier in
this chapter).
Chapter 3: Enjoying Spirits 51
Your taste buds and your health
Your health (or lack thereof) may alter your sense of taste, causing partial or 
total ageusia, the medical term for loss of taste. Or you may experience flavor 
confusion — meaning that you mix up flavors, translating sour as bitter, or sweet as
salty, or vice versa.
The following factors may contribute to alterations in your sense of taste:
 A bacterial or viral infection of the tongue may produce secretions that block
your taste buds.
 An injury or radiation therapy affecting the nose, mouth, or throat may damage
nerves that transmit flavor and aroma signals.
 Dentures may cover (and block) taste buds.
 Some medicines block your ability to taste or change your perception of flavors.
The pharmacological miscreants include drugs to lower blood pressure, anti-
fungal products, some psychotropic medications, and some drugs used to treat
infectious illnesses such as tuberculosis.

The textures that you’re most likely to experience in tasting 
spirits are
 Smooth and “thick”
 Airy, or vaporous, with fog-like tendrils of flavor
 Astringent, also known as dry
Evaluate the flavor by letting the aerated whiskey rest in your
mouth for a second or two — one-one-thousand, two-one-thou-
sand. Now swirl it around your mouth and let a little bit drip down
the back of your mouth and into your throat. Notice the following:
 The overall impression. The first time you go through this
ritual, you may get an overall impression of the spirits, but
not be able to identify individual flavors. Take your time. Try
again. With practice, you may be able to pinpoint several dif-
ferent flavors.
 The special flavors. With the exception of vodka, which made
its marketing bones by having no flavor at all, the different
spirits do taste different from each other. The exact flavors
you find in spirits depend on the food from which the spirits
are made, the way the product is distilled, and — most 
importantly — the aging process. The longer the aging, the
more complex the flavors are likely to be.
I tell you about the distinct flavors found in individual spirits in
the chapters on each spirit. Eventually, with practice, you may
be able to identify sweet flavors and bitter (dry) ones. Some
spirits, such as Scotch whiskies, may have a salty or sour tang,
but salty and sour are far less common than sweet and bitter.
 The finish. How intense is the flavor you taste? What about
the finish (the length of time the flavor of the spirits remains
in your mouth; the longer the finish, the longer the aging)?
Does it linger in your mouth or disappear as soon as you spit?
Is there an aftertaste? If so, is it pleasant or not?
 The flavor with water. Note that the flavor is milder when the
spirit is mixed with water than when straight. But you
guessed that, didn’t you?

Serving Spirits Day to Day
Tastings are special events. Enjoying fine spirits is an everyday
pleasure: Select a product and serve it well, in moderation. When
you’ve chosen the type of spirits you want, the question is how to
differentiate among the apparently thousands of bottles on the
shelves. First, find a liquor store you trust. Second, learn how to
read a label. And after you make your purchases, store your pre-
cious spirits properly, and serve them in the right glasses. The fol-
lowing sections walk you through the process.
Choosing a liquor store
As you know, the best liquor store has (a) a really good selection of
products, and (b) salespeople whose suggestions pan out time
after time.
The store doesn’t have to be enormous to qualify. All you need is a
reasonably varied selection of types and products. To verify this,
do something radical: Walk down the aisles and look at the bottles.
If you find at least ten brands (in a variety of sizes) for the major
spirit types, the store makes the grade.
Finding a salesperson who consistently gives you good suggestions
is a bit trickier. It requires an investment of time and money. To
start, ask a trustworthy salesperson for a specific product (say,
single malt Scotch whisky); he or she should do the following:
Chapter 3: Enjoying Spirits 53

 Recommend at least five brands
 Be able to tell you exactly what makes each one unique
 Meet your price requirements, perhaps suggesting that you
try small bottles (0.50 ml/miniatures, or 375 ml bottles) first
When you go back to the store and tell your salesperson which
brands you liked best, he or she may repeat the process until you
get exactly what you’re seeking.
Surfing the Net
Can you buy spirits on the Internet? Yes. Do you want to? Maybe.
Keep in mind that you can run into a couple of problems when you
buy on the Internet. It’s necessary to be informed and work
through the following issues:
 Find out whether shipping to your home is legal in your state.
 If shipping spirits to your home isn’t legal, the online retailer
may have to first deliver your order to a nearby retailer (or
have a local distributor do that), and then you have to either
pick it up or arrange for delivery.
 If shipping spirits to your home is legal, the law says an adult
must be available to accept delivery. This can be a hassle if
you and your housemates work during the day.
 Evaluate the price. The initial price quoted on a Web site may
be lower than the price at your local retailer. True, the
Internet price is usually free of the federal, state, and local
taxes that can account for up to 50 percent of the local cost.
However, shipping and handling charges may actually bring
the real price right up to what you pay when buying locally.
 Because the Internet is global, be certain that the supplier is
located in the United States and therefore is licensed by all
the laws governing quality assurance.
If you do decide to try the Net, stick with nationally advertised
brands, at least until you establish that you’re dealing with a rep-
utable company that accepts the need to obey the laws governing
products and sale of all alcohol products.
Reading a spirits label
The multiple labels on a bottle of spirits sold in the United States
serve up multiple factoids about the product: the type of spirits,
Part I: Entering the Spirits World 
54

where it was made, who bottled or imported it, the amount of alco-
hol in the spirits, whether the spirit has any added coloring or fla-
voring agents, whether the spirit has any major allergens
(including sulfites), and, for those who want still more bottle read-
ing, a warning about who shouldn’t drink the spirit.
All this info — which may be more than you ever wanted to know —
must be stated in English. Exceptions: The brand name can be in
any language, and spirits bottled for sale only in Puerto Rico can
print everything in Spanish except the word “imitation” and the net
contents (exactly how much is in the bottle).
Figure 3-1 shows a typical set of labels on a typical bottle of spirits
sold in the United States.
Figure 3-1: Labeling pleasure.
Protecting your investment
Do you plan to reserve a bottle of very expensive Scotch or Cognac
for a special occasion — or a special tasting? Protect your invest-
ment with tender loving care by following these steps:
 Store the bottles in a cool, dry location. The traditional cellar
is fine; so is a cool room, preferably on a standard bottle rack.

Chapter 3: Enjoying Spirits 55

 Check the bottles from time to time. Be sure the top is still
tightly sealed. Some people suggest that if the bottle’s leaking,
you can reseal it with melted candle wax, but any leakage
means that air’s gotten in and the alcohol inside may be evap-
orating out. Best to drink it sooner rather than later.
 Turn each intact bottle slightly to keep the cork inside moist.
Dry corks crack, allowing air to enter and alcohol to escape.
And dust the bottle to keep it looking nice.
 Keep a notebook listing any rare (or very expensive) bottles.
Jot down the date of purchase and the cost to remind you
what’s awaiting your attention. And when the bottle is emp-
tied, soak off the label and put it in a scrapbook, adding the
occasion on which you finished it and what particular quality
you enjoyed the most.
Taking temperature into account
To chill or not to chill? Actually, that should be to warm or not to
warm?
Most dark spirits do well at room temperature; the temperature of
the tasting rooms at most Scotch distilleries is about 60 degrees
Fahrenheit (15 degrees Celsius). Whiskeys and brandies exude
stronger aromas and release deeper flavors when you warm them
by holding the glass in your hands before drinking.
The serious exception to warming is vodka. Warm, unflavored
vodka can smell like — how to put this delicately — gasoline.
Always serve vodka chilled. Maybe even straight from the freezer.
No kidding.
Avoiding glass warfare
Is a Martini a Martini if it’s not served in a Martini glass? The head
says yes, but the heart says no.
Serving spirits in the proper glasses often makes a drink look
better — imagine whiskey and soda in a cocktail glass rather than
a rocks glass. In addition, the physical shape and size of a specific
glass may actually enhance the flavor and aroma of the spirits.
The glasses commonly used to serve spirits are:
Part I: Entering the Spirits World 
56

 Shot glass: Holds exactly one serving of spirits, defined by the
United States Department of Agriculture/Health and Human
Services (USDA/HHS) Dietary Guidelines for Americans as 1.5
ounces. Perfect for whiskey taken neat (straight, no mixer);
also useful as a measuring cup.
 Lowball, rocks, or old-fashioned glass: This blocky, usually
straight-sided glass commonly holds 12 ounces. Used for serv-

Distilled wisdom
Moderation is the key to enjoying spirits.
Fine spirits deserve respect. Each sip should be a reward, not the warning of a mis-
erable morrow. In other words, “Cheers. Not tears.”
The morning after isn’t fiction. It’s miserable physical fact caused by carelessly
taking in more alcohol than your body can comfortably metabolize (digest) and flush
away.
Drink a glass of beer, wine, or spirits, and its alcohol flows down your gullet to your
stomach and small intestine and from there to your liver. In your stomach, an enzyme
called gastric alcohol dehydrogenase (GADH) begins to digest the alcohol, but the
heavy lifting occurs in the liver where a similar enzyme (liver alcohol dehydroge-
nase) completes the job.
Men generally produce more ADH than women do, and Caucasians produce more
than Asians and Native Americans, but every single body has its limits. Regardless
of your gender or ethnicity, if you take in more alcohol than you can metabolize in
one pass through the stomach and liver, the leftover unmetabolized alcohol contin-
ues to circulate through your bloodstream, making trouble everywhere it goes.
For example, alcohol is a diuretic, so you urinate a lot, losing fluids and vital miner-
als while piling up irritating uric acid. Alcohol dilates blood vessels, including those
in your head, so your head hurts. Alcohol irritates the lining of the stomach, caus-
ing it to secrete extra gastric acid, so your stomach aches and you feel queasy.
Finally, alcohol slows the exchange of electrical impulses among nerve cells in the
brain: Thinking slows, judgment slides away, and the tongue twists.
No magic potion will cure these ills. No tomato juice, no prairie oysters, no combi-
nation of vitamins and minerals, no teensy whiffs of oxygen will relieve the misery.
As for the hair of the dog: Put a leash on it. Yes, alcohol is an anesthetic, so a sip may
temporarily calm jangling nerves. But the additional sip must also be metabolized,
which means more time until recovery.
In truth, the only cure for overindulgence is time. As it passes, the body will whip up
some more ADH, metabolize more alcohol, and eventually clear the alcohol from
your blood, but not the memory of its effects from your mind.
The next time around, all that went before should convince any rational person that
enjoying alcohol in moderation is the only reasonable way to go. Cheers.

Whiskeys from
Around the World

In this part . . .
W
hiskey is the prince of distilled spirits, and the 
cold dark reaches of the Northern British Isles is
its ancestral home. From there, it set out to conquer the
world. This part covers the ﬁrst whiskeys, which came
from Ireland and Scotland. Let the Irish and Scots argue
about who invented whisk(e)y ﬁrst. (More about that “e”
in Chapter 5.) Then I examine what happened when Irish
and Scotch whiskeys traveled west and came to North
America with their emigrant distillers. I highlight those
distinctly American whiskeys, Bourbon and Tennessee
whiskey. If your personal preference veers to the north, I
haven’t left you out — Canadian whisky gets a chapter of
its own. I also tell you about American blended whiskey
and the whiskeys from fairly new markets, like Japan,
India, and New Zealand. All you really need to worry about
is how to enjoy all these wonderful spirits.

Entering the Emerald Isle
Ireland is truly special.
The warming Gulf Stream comes up from the tropics to kiss its
Atlantic shore, bringing with it abundant rainfall that rarely turns
to snow. On the other side of the island lies the wild Irish Sea,
where 10 to 15 miles of water separate Ireland from England and
Scotland.
Traveling along either coast, the visitor is dazzled by the rich
green of the foliage framing a nearly tropical blue sea, thus earning
Ireland the nickname the “Emerald Isle.” Despite its situation on
the northern part of the globe, Ireland is a fertile land with a tem-
perate climate that supports abundant crops of grains, primarily
barley, and low-lying mountains with clear mountain streams that
provide more than enough unpolluted water for a unique whiskey.

Part II: Whiskeys from Around the World

Tracking the origins of Irish whiskey
You probably know that St. Patrick chased the snakes out of Ireland,
but did you also know that he brought the “worm” in instead? At
least that’s the truth according to tales told over the bar in Irish
pubs.
After the human race discovered distillation, many missionaries,
commercial as well as religious, took the process with them as they
traveled, introducing to the world the worm, the coils atop a still
that condense alcohol vapors into neutral spirits, which is the first
product of distillation. (Lost in the language? For a refreshing,
sorry, refresher course in the distillation basics, bookmark this
page, turn to Chapter 2, and then return to this very spot.)
St. Patrick, the gentle but determined fourth-century son of a Roman
soldier and a British mother, was kidnapped as a child, sold as a slave
in Ireland, and sent by his masters to study in a French monastery,
where he was ordained and sent back to Ireland. In all likelihood, he
took with him the product of monasterial distillation.
Patrick and his fellows, sent to “civilize” the Gaels, called their dis-
tilled spirits aqua vitae, Latin for water of life. In Gaelic, the Latin
aqua vitae became uisege beatha (pronounced oosga bee-atha). Say
that fast, with an Irish brogue, and it comes out close to ushkey —
or at least, that’s what it sounded like to British troops sent every
now and then to conquer Ireland.
Well, to coin a phrase, how ya gonna keep ‘em down on the farm
once they’ve tasted uisege beatha? Naturally, the soldiers went
home to tell friends and family about the wonderful — all together
now! — ushkey, soon to be whiskey.
To “E” or not to “E”: How come?
No etymologist (that’s a word-derivation expert) knows exactly why the Irish spelled
the wine of their country with an “e” and why their neighbors across the Irish Sea
left the “e” out. It’s often used as an indication that the Irish had the spirits first and
because it sounded like a broad “e” in Gaelic, they started spelling whiskey with
an “e.” Under this theory, when the Scots started making aqua vitae, they wanted
to point out the difference between theirs and the Irish. Hence, no “e.” That’s as
good an explanation as any.

Sailing the Irish seas
The quickest way to stir up a fuss in an Irish pub is to suggest that
the Scots were the first to make whiskey. In fact, the Scots and the
Irish tied for first place in the distillation race. Sort of. Yes, the
Scottish farmers may have started distilling earlier, but the Irish
were the first to make the whiskey a commercial success.
Surrounded by the seas, the Irish were great sailors who had even
designed a wood-frame hide or skin-covered waterborne vessel
called a curragh. Julius Caesar first described the oval-shaped
boats when he became one of the multitudinous invaders of
Ireland and marveled at the craft’s stability in choppy waters.
The curraghs, still in use long after the Romans left, made it easy
for the Irish to cross the heaving Irish Sea to Scotland and deliver
their whiskey to the populace. They were probably on one of those
excursions to “civilize” the natives and increase Irish farmers’
incomes.
As a matter of course, many of the seamen sailing from Ireland to
Scotland saw the place as a land of new opportunity and settled
right in, bringing with them their distilling techniques. In fact, so
many made the trip east that modern genealogists may have a
hard time locating a Scottish still master whose family tree isn’t
rooted in the old sod of Ireland. But that’s a story for Chapter 5.
Beginning well: The early days 
of the Irish whiskey trade
What with the curraghs slipping back and forth through rain and
sleet to deliver the goods to thirsty Europeans who used the
whiskey not simply as a beverage but also as a purifier and flavor-
ing agent for the local drinking water, everything was going swim-
mingly for the Irish.
That is, until 1608, 50 years after Henry VIII formed a Protestant
state government in Ireland. That year, the British Crown issued
the first license to an Irish distillery, Bushmills at Antrim in
Northern Ireland.
Although the Irish had been making whiskey there for several hun-
dred years, the new license served notice to the world — and the
British treasury — that Irish whiskey was now a full fledged, legal
member of world commerce.
Chapter 4: Sipping the Irish Whiskeys 63

Part II: Whiskeys from Around the World 
64
Then, in 1661, the British sat up and took notice of all the buying
and selling back and forth, forthwith imposing a tax on all whiskey,
a move translated by the Irish into: “The King is taxing Irish
whiskey to benefit the Brits.”
The new whiskey tax dramatically slowed the legal whiskey trade,
encouraging the production of illegal poitin (pronounced po-cheen),
or “little pot still,” in honor of the type of stills used to make it. Still,
Irish whiskey sailed off to Europe, carried by bootleggers and smug-
glers sailing under the British tax radar.
The higher prices didn’t halt the British demand for good Irish
whiskey, and the Irish beverage took a sudden leap forward in favor.
Then, in the mid-18th century, a tiny insect called Daktulosphaira
vitifoliae (common name: phylloxera) infested and decimated nearly
all the wine grape vines in France. This decimation forced the thirsty
French elite, who until then had looked on whiskey as a drink for
the lower classes, to join the audience for Irish distillates.
Which left only the New World for the Irish to conquer.
Go west, young distiller
Crop failures are an unpleasant but familiar feature of farm life. For
example, a widespread barley crop failure originally led Irish farmers
to plant potatoes, a seemingly weatherproof and disease-resistant
food brought back to Europe from the Americas. So adaptable was
this multipurpose tuber that Irish farmers were soon labeled with
the not-entirely-complimentary name of “potato eaters.”
Potatoes, too, had been known to fall victim to a plant disease; over
the years, limited crop failures had caused limited losses. But, the
Great Hunger of 1845–1848 was a disaster of another magnitude
entirely, a nationwide crop failure during which nearly 25 percent
of the Irish people died from famine and more than 500,000 left for
North America.
And a cracking good time was had by all
One of the most popular Irish words is the Gaelic craic (pronounced crack). Nobody
has an exact, original definition, but in modern language, craic means having a good
time with other people by having fun, generally in a pub, with lots of conversation —
and plenty of good Irish whiskey.

Chapter 4: Sipping the Irish Whiskeys 65
Those who stayed uprooted the potatoes and planted in their
place grains to be used in distilling. The first whiskey they pro-
duced was less than perfect, but it was inexpensive and it sold 
well enough that soon an estimated 2,000 stills were in operation,
making Irish whiskey again very available.
Across the Atlantic, as the Irish settled in the New World, they
brought with them their distilling techniques and their special
whiskey. Soon, the beverage was popular enough to convince
American tavern owners to lay in a continuing stock, and once
again, Irish whiskey began to gain favor with a new audience.
And then the Americans changed the rules.
Losing — and again finding —
the luck of the Irish
As the 20th century began and Irish whiskey continued to make its
popular way in the world, American voters decided to amend their
Constitution to establish Prohibition, making it illegal to make, sell,
or drink alcohol beverages (except for medical reasons, of course),
thereby introducing millions of American and Canadian drinkers to
smuggled whiskey — much of it Irish.
As if that weren’t enough of a challenge, almost as soon as Prohibition
was repealed via a second amendment to the Constitution, a very new
American distilled spirit, blended whiskey, began to compete for the
loyalty of drinkers who preferred the light flavor of the Irish variety.
As if that weren’t trouble enough for Irish whiskey, during World
War II, most American GIs stationed in Britain had their first taste
of Scotch whisky and French wines, liked what they tasted, and
brought their newly sophisticated palates home with them. Sales
of the milder Irish (and American) whiskeys dropped to the point
where it soon became difficult to find Irish whiskey on the shelves
of many liquor stores.
Some Irish distillers tossed in the towel, cashed in their holdings,
closed their distilleries, and retired to the South of France (just kid-
ding on that last one). But the more faithful pulled up their distill-
ing socks, so to speak, held on, and rode out the revolution much
as they had the raids of Vikings and Goths.
Thanks to them, today’s Irish whiskeys are back in force, with sales
in the United States alone expected to cross the million case mark
by 2010. It’s been a hard road, but you can bet St. Patrick would be
proud of his progeny.

The Uniqueness of Irish Whiskey
Virtually all Irish whiskeys are triple distilled (sent through a still
three times), most often on pot stills (alembics), and aged a mini-
mum of three years. Even those products that make no age claim
on the label are likely to have aged in the barrel for between five
and eight years.
Irish whiskeys may be
 Single malts (a single distillate from one distillery)
 Vatted (a blend of distillates and/or neutral spirits from one
distillery or several distilleries)
 Vintage (a blend of whiskeys from a single year’s production
at one distillery)
 Limited bottling (single distillate or a blend from special aging
casks that impart special flavor and aroma notes)
Regardless of the type, the distinctive character of Irish whiskey is
determined chiefly by
 The grain (mostly barley)
 The water (mostly hard)
 The fire (coal or wood)
The following sections give you details on how grain, water, and
fire come together to create the Irish whiskey you know and love.
Beginning with barley
Ireland’s primary native grain crops are oats, wheat, and barley.
The latter is a versatile product that can be used as food for
human beings and animals, and as a base for fermented alcohol
products, such as beer, and distilled spirits, such as whiskey.
As a general rule, distillers require 22 pounds of grain to produce a
600-liter cask of mash (the grain-plus-water base from which alco-
hol is ultimately distilled), which may be expected to yield 21 to 23
liters of grain whiskey.
But the amount of alcohol produced during distillation rises with
the proportion of starch in the grain. A high-starch grain yields
more alcohol than a low-starch grain.
Part II: Whiskeys from Around the World 
66

Chapter 4: Sipping the Irish Whiskeys 67
Early on, Irish distillers used oats in their distilling, giving their
spirits a recognizable “oaty” taste. Then some smart cookie in the
distillery realized that barley has proportionately more starch than
oats, while some food chemist discovered that barley also has lots
of diastase, an enzyme that hastens yeast’s conversion of the
grain’s starches to sugar, a vital step in controlled fermentation
and distillation.
The smart cookie, having put one and one together, probably went
straightaway to tell the smart cookie’s boss to switch to the more
efficient barley, making it the predominant grain for making Irish
whiskey (and saving the company a bundle in the process).
Following the flow
The second component in the distinctive flavor of Irish whiskey is
the water used in making the mash and turning the plain alcohol
into a liquid that’s no more than 100 proof (50 percent alcohol by
volume). In other words, drinkable whiskey.
Most of the stream and spring water used in the distillation of Irish
whiskey is naturally filtered through limestone in the Irish soil. As
a result, the water is hard — that is, packed with minerals that
lend a special flavor to the finished product.
Firing the spirit
Before the grains for whiskey can be made into mash, they must
germinate (in other words, sprout). Heat speeds germination; in
Ireland, the source of the heat is usually a wood or coal fire.
Occasionally, the Irish may light their fire with peat, a compacted
moss most commonly used in Scotland. (The Scots traditionally
malt their whisky by spreading the barley on a floor, beneath
which burns a hot peat fire. The smoke and flavoring agents from
the peat fire are thrown into the grain. The Irish don’t particularly
go for that peaty taste and so burn theirs in bricks cut from the
native peat beds, all fired up in an enclosed oven.)
The material burned in heating the grains can impart a flavor of its
own; master distillers often have their own preferences in creating
a special whiskey and use the malting process to help them out.

Part II: Whiskeys from Around the World 
68
Fire also plays a role in developing the flavor of the whiskey in the
barrel because Irish whiskeys, some of which are aged in barrels
that once held Bourbon or sherry, are usually aged in charred bar-
rels (for more about that, check out Chapter 2 where barreling and
aging are discussed in complete detail).
The Leading Irish Whiskeys
Up until World War II, Ireland had dozens of distilleries, each pro-
ducing its own style of whiskey. However, as drinking preferences
changed and the demand for Irish whiskey fell, many of these facili-
ties closed. The majority of the remaining ones merged to form the
Irish Distillers Company, a conglomerate that held sway over the
entire Irish whiskey industry up to and for some time after the war.
Within the past 20 years, a series of corporate sales and mergers
ultimately brought almost all the Irish distilleries together under
the corporate umbrella of the Pernod Ricard, a French company
that is now the world’s leading producer of Irish whiskey — and
several other types of alcohol beverages.
The remaining distillers of Irish whiskey are
 Midleton
 Bushmills
 Cooley
You can see where they’re located on the map in Figure 4-1.
Each has its own take on how a superior Irish whiskey should look
and taste. Read on to quench your curiosity.
Cordially yours
Whiskeys are dandy but so are the candy, sorry, cordials made from Irish whiskeys.
The three Irish cordials best known and most generally available in the United States
are Bailey’s, a blend of Irish whiskey and fresh dairy cream; Bailey’s Mint (ditto, plus
mint flavor); and Irish Mist (whiskey plus honey and other flavors).
No, they don’t go well with Irish potatoes or boiled cabbage, but as an after dinner
treat? Terrific.

Chapter 4: Sipping the Irish Whiskeys 69
Figure 4-1: Ireland and its major distillers.
Midleton
Midleton is located in, well, Midleton, a town about 15 miles from
the southeast Irish coastal city of Cork. One of the world’s largest
and most complex distilleries, the company has enormous continu-
ous and pot stills capable of turning out 5.3 million gallons of
whiskey every single day for Midleton’s own brands and those of
other distillers.
Midleton is also home to the world’s largest pot still, constructed
in 1825, a short time after the original Midleton Distillery was built.
The “Big Still,” no longer in use, could accommodate more than 40
gallons of mash at a time, a big deal in its day. The still was shut
down after construction of the new Midleton plant in 1975.
Midleton’s leading export brands are Jameson, Powers, and
Redbreast.

Jameson
Jameson (80 proof/40 percent ABV — alcohol by volume) was orig-
inally made at the Jameson Distillery in Dublin (founded in 1780).
Its popularity increased until it became the world’s leading Irish
whiskey. At that time, Jameson production was moved to Midleton,
and its original Dublin plant was converted to a must-see visitor’s
center.
The pale gold whiskey is a blend of about 50 percent pot still spir-
its plus malted spirits from continuous stills, aged in sherry casks.
Its light, sweet taste not only makes it easy to drink neat but also
makes it a superb base for the cocktails Americans love.
You can find Jameson and Jameson 12 Year Old around the world.
Jameson Gold 18 Year Old may be harder to find.
Midleton
The Midleton offerings (80 proof/40 percent ABV) are most often
special bottlings, such as Midleton Very Rare 1994, and several
very costly single cask-aged whiskeys, each with a slightly different
and smoother flavor.
These are top of the line whiskeys, and the variety of flavor hints
provided by the different barrels make them exciting to track down.
Powers
Powers (80 proof/40 percent ABV) is another famous Dublin
whiskey, first made in 1791, whose original recipe has been faith-
fully preserved at Midleton.
Powers Gold Label carries no age statement, but like other Irish
whiskeys, it’s aged for a minimum of three years. Powers 12 Year
Old Millennium, with a higher percentage of malt spirits, is more
deeply flavored. The regular Powers is really designed as a mixing
whiskey and is most often the Irish whiskey used in taverns for
that purpose.
Redbreast
Redbreast (80 proof/40 percent ABV), an old-style pot still whiskey
in the Jameson line, is brighter in color than the traditional Jameson.
It has a deep body and a flavor that lingers on the palate, leading
some tasting experts to insist that “one can always identify
Redbreast, even in a blind comparison tasting.”
The whiskey, originally available primarily in Ireland, is now being
distilled at Middleton so that more is available for export.

Bushmills
Bushmills, the world’s oldest licensed distillery (1608), is located
in Antrim, Northern Ireland, near the famed Giant’s Causeway — a
spread of natural granite pillars in the sea that some consider the
ruins of a natural bridge to Scotland, less than 25 miles away.
Legend has it that the Irish giant Fingal (“Finn McCool”) walked
across the bridge to carry distillation from Ireland to Scotland.
Frankly, as Julius Caesar noted, the carraghs seem a better bet.
A fire destroyed the original Bushmills building in 1885; the “new”
distillery uses only pot stills to turn out several well-known
blended light whiskeys.
Bushmills Original
Bushmills Original (80 proof/40 percent ABV) has a distinct malty
flavor and an aroma reminiscent of toast or baking bread. This
blend of grain neutral spirits and whiskeys is distilled and aged for
up to seven years on the Bushmills grounds in eight “cellars” large
enough to hold a total of 175,000 quietly aging barrels.
Black Bush
Despite its name, Black Bush (80 proof/40 percent ABV) is a bril-
liant deep gold. The whiskey has an intense malt flavor and is a
favorite with those who prefer a stronger flavor than Bushmills
Original. Black Bush costs more; however, its fans say the price
reflects the quality and the heritage which in itself is worth the
money.
Bushmills Single Malts
This unusual group of whiskeys — the Bushmills Single Malts (80
proof/40 percent ABV) — includes 1608 Special Reserve 10 Year
Old, Bushmills 12 Year Old, and Bushmills 16 Year Old Madeira
Cask Aged.
Each has the characteristic Bushmills toasty flavor and aroma, but
the 16 Year Old is notable for its age-related smoothness and the
subtle flavor tones imparted by the casks that once held Madeira
wine (and if you’ve ever tasted an aged Madeira you won’t ever
forget it).
Cooley
Cooley, near the Cooley Mountains that span the northern side of
the border between Eire (The Irish Republic) and Northern Ireland
(Great Britain), is a rarity among Irish distillers.
Chapter 4: Sipping the Irish Whiskeys 71

Part II: Whiskeys from Around the World 
72
The company isn’t centuries old. In fact, it’s not even one century
old, having been established in 1987 by an investment group that
decided to reactivate Cooley’s existing plant. The plant had been
distilling ethanol to export in bulk to whiskey makers in other
countries or to ship off to people making gasohol, the lowered
emission auto fuel.
Despite powerful competition from the Irish Distillers Group, the
Cooley guys were cool enough to think they could fill a niche by
producing special Irish whiskeys made solely on pot stills and dis-
tilled only two times rather than three times, like other Irish
whiskeys.
Originally, Cooley resurrected Irish whiskey names no longer avail-
able and marketed them mostly in Great Britain, often as private
labels (or as the British call them, “store owned”), but as the dis-
tillery’s reputation grew, the company began to produce its own
branded products for the global market. Today, a few Cooley
whiskeys are available in the United States, but some are in 
limited supplies, so be prepared to hunt them down.
Connemara
Connemara (112 proof/59.6 percent ABV) is the only non-blended,
peated malt whiskey made in Ireland. Needless to say, it makes a
potent mouthful but also a very robust, tasty one. The best way to
try this is with water and slow sipping.
Connemara is also available in the more common 80 proof (40 per-
cent ABV) version. Connemara has created a buzz because the
peat fired under the still in Scotch-whisky-style lends it a flavor 
different from that of the usual, lighter Irish whiskeys.
Yes, this chapter is about Irish whiskeys. Yes, peat firing is usually
reserved for Scotch whiskies. So here’s a thought: How about 
comparing the flavor of Connemara (if you can find it) with your
favorite Scotch whisky and a more traditional Irish whiskey, such
as Bushmills?
Tyroconnel
The single malt Irish whiskey Tyroconnel (80 proof/40 percent
ABV) is aged in charred and recharred Bourbon barrels, which
gives it an interesting flavor that’s unlike the flavor of other Irish
whiskeys. It’s sweeter but not smoother, and it could make nice a
change for Bourbon fanciers.
By the by, the whiskey is named for a 19th century racehorse who
won the Irish Classic and paid 100 to 1. The event is memorialized
on the Tyroconnel bottle label.

Chapter 4: Sipping the Irish Whiskeys 73
Tasting Irish Whiskey
Time for the best part, a grand craic, and have a grand time tasting
whiskeys from Ireland.
Virtually all the whiskeys you’ll taste are
 80 proof (40 percent ABV)
 Blends of various malt whiskeys and grain neutral spirits
 Aged in a variety of wooden barrels or casks
Creating the tasting sheet
Before you start to put your tasting together, set up your tasting
sheet, a piece of paper on which you can record your very own
personal evaluation of each whiskey that you try.
In Chapter 3, you can find a sample tasting sheet that you can copy
or adapt as you see fit.
Setting up the tasting
The basic rules for setting up a tasting of Irish whiskeys are pretty
much the same as those for tasting any food or drink: Choose your
samples, smell and taste them, and decide which you like best.
Chapter 3 spells out the details of a general tasting, along with an
explanation of how your nose and palate transmit signals that your
brain interprets as, “Oh, boy that’s good,” or “Eeeeew. Take that
stuff away.”
To apply these details to a tasting of Irish whiskey, choose a mini-
mum of three whiskeys or a maximum of five, and then let the 
tasting begin.
Observing and tasting the whiskeys
As you go through the following steps, note your reactions on your
tasting sheet so that you can review them later:
1. Consider the color.
Pick up the glass of plain, unadulterated whiskey #1. With a
blank white sheet of paper behind it, hold the glass up to
the light and study the color. Irish whiskey color ranges

from light golden to rich brown, reflecting age and the grains
used to make the whiskey. As a general rule, the darker the
color, the older the whiskey and the higher the malted grain
content of the mash from which the whiskey was distilled.
2. Look for the “legs.”
Put the glass down on the table and swirl it clockwise so
that the liquid runs up the inside of the glass and then
slides down again, leaving a trail (legs) as it goes.
The legs indicate how long the whiskey was aged. Older
whiskeys are more viscous (thicker), so they slide down
more slowly than younger whiskeys. The slower the
whiskey runs down your glass, the older it is.
3. Use your nose.
Go ahead and stick your nose right into the glass and take 
a deep breath to inhale the aromas. Good whiskey smells
good. And each whiskey has characteristic aromas of its
own. Take your time. With patience and practice, you’ll be
able to identify those characteristics of Irish whiskey. For a
guide to what’s in the glass, check out Table 4-1.
4. Taste.
At last! Take a small sip of whiskey plus air. Yes, you have
permission to slurp at the tasting table. Let the whiskey/air
combo rest in your mouth for a second or two, and then
swirl it around your mouth, letting a little drip down your
throat. Performing these maneuvers makes it possible, with
practice, to perceive specific flavors, such as those I list in
Table 4-1.
5. Spit.
Chapter 3 tells you to have a spit bucket ready for your tast-
ing. Now’s your chance to use it. Spit out plain whiskey #1.
6. Taste with water.
Add water to the whiskey left in your tasting glass (about
as much water as there is whiskey). Repeat the aroma and
flavor tests to see whether the flavors hold up when the
whiskey is diluted.
7. Take notes and cleanse.
Note your experiences on your tasting sheet, and munch
on a cracker to cleanse your palate. Move on to whiskey #2.
Repeat all the steps for each whiskey.

couldn’t make the trip in one hop; they needed to stop to refuel.
So did the passengers.
To accommodate both, the airlines said to the Irish, “Build an airport and we will
come.” And that’s how Shannon, a gateway to Europe at the western edge of
Ireland, was born.
In keeping with Irish hospitality, Shannon barkeeps earned a place in food history
by creating Irish coffee to welcome travelers into Ireland or send them off satisfied
on the trip home. Eventually, of course, the coffee crossed the Atlantic — and the
rest of the world’s oceans — and arrived in San Francisco where it became a
celebrity and tourist favorite. Ultimately, Irish coffee has become a staple wherever
fine drink is served.
Without further ado, I present to you the original recipe:
Classic Irish Coffee
Warm a stemmed glass.
Add a generous serving of Irish whiskey (1.5 to 2 ounces).
Add strong, black coffee and sugar to taste; stir well.
Place a spoon upside down over the edge of the glass, just above the coffee, and
pour fresh whipping cream slowly over the spoon so that the cream lies atop the
coffee.
Or, for pure decadence, top the coffee with fresh whipped cream.
Then sip slowly while singing the praises of the Irish.

Planning a Blended Meal
Irish whiskey is light, so most devotees prefer to take it straight,
over ice, or with a splash of still or sparkling water as an aperitif (if
you’re talking like an expert, you may as well speak French), which
is a before-dinner drink intended to stimulate the appetite.
Sweet, light blended Irish whiskey is also perfect in most cocktails,
such as a classic Manhattan (sweet vermouth, bitters, a maraschino
cherry, a twist of orange, and some whiskey — in this case, the
Irish).
During dinner, Irish whiskey mixed with water, club soda, or bitter
lemon in a tall highball glass complements the sometimes salty tra-
ditional Irish dishes, such as grilled salmon, corned beef and cab-
bage, or a traditional Irish (read: lamb) stew.
Skip the Irish whiskey if you’re serving spicy food, such as some
Asian dishes. The strong flavors of the food may leave the mild
whiskey flavorless. Well, nothing’s perfect.
After dinner, try an Irish cordial or an Irish coffee, the perfect end
to an Irish whiskey dining experience.
Touring the Source
Modern Ireland definitely isn’t the bucolic Eire of literature, art, and
music. Today, the country is known far and wide as the “Celtic Tiger,”
a land powered by a booming economy powered by an equally
booming rush of immigrants who lend Ireland a truly international
character.
To plan your trip to Ireland, start with a copy of Ireland For Dummies,
4th Edition, by Elizabeth Albertson (Wiley).
Hit the high spots like Dublin and Cork, of course, but after you
hang upside down by your heels to kiss the Blarney Stone, take
time to visit one or more of the three major operating Irish distill-
eries and/or one of the two well-maintained Irish distillery muse-
ums: Old Jameson’s on the site of the original Jameson’s distillery
in Dublin, and Locke’s in the countryside of County Cork. Table 4-2

How the Irish say good job, congrats, 
bye-bye, and fare-thee-well
Common wisdom has it that the first to lift a glass to salute a fellow drinker were
the Danes, who are said to have hoisted a brew-filled bull’s horn to bid farewell to
a traveler or a lost comrade.
Several centuries later, the Brits made the ritual a bit more complex by dipping a
piece of toasted bread into the drink to lend a maltier flavor. Does it suggest a cer-
tain lack of originality to note that they called the ritual “toasting”? No matter: Soon
everybody and his brother used the term to describe a liquid salute.
Naturally, the poetic Irish turned the everyday toast (“Here’s to ya”) into memorable
poetry. Consider the toasts that follow:
 Here’s to the maiden of bashful fifteen,
Here’s to the widow of fifty.
Here’s to the flaunting extravagant queen,
And here’s to the housewife that’s thrifty.
I’ll warrant she’ll prove an excuse for the glass.
 May the road rise to meet you.
May the wind be always at your back.
May the sun shine warm on your face,
And rains fall softly on your fields.
And until we meet again
May God hold you in the hollow of His hand.
(And never close His fist too tight.)
You can add that last line from a similar toast.
 May your coffin have six handles of the finest silver.
May your coffin be carried by six young maidens.
And may your coffin be made of the finest wood
From 100-year-old trees
That I’m going to plant tomorrow.
 I used to know a clever toast.
But now I cannot think it.
So fill your glass to anything
And damn your souls, I’ll drink it.
After toasts like these, the only thing left to say is Slan (pronounced slawn), which
is the good Gaelic word for farewell.

A
s the old saying goes, “If it’s been around this long, it must be
good.” The Scots were among the world’s earliest distillers
and have had centuries to develop the flavors of whisky, grains to
make the flavors, and methods of bringing the essences of those
grains into liquid, otherwise called “distillation.”
It’s why Scotch whisky went from being the best in Northern
Europe to being synonymous with the word “whisky” throughout
the world. It’s also why after a few years of being ignored by the
elites of the United States, Scotch whisky is gaining in popularity
every year.
This chapter relays the history, production, and special pleasures
of the various types of Scotch whisky. I also explain the differences
between straight, blended, and “vatted” whiskies, and I present a
tasting plan guide to enable you to sample the differences. And I
say, as they do in Scotland, Slainte Mhath (pronounced slawncha’
va) — Good health!
Which Came First: Whiskey 
or Whisky?
Who made whisk(e)y first — the Irish or the Scots?
Patriotic pride aside, the facts say that either (a) the Irish sailors
carried their whiskey with them when they sailed across the Irish
Sea to trade in Scotland, or (b) the Scots — who christened their

Part II: Whiskeys from Around the World 
80
beverage whisky without the “e” — learned the art of distilling from
Christian missionaries who brought distilling to Scotland just as St.
Patrick had brought it to Ireland.
In other words, anyone who speaks with an Irish brogue or a Scottish
burr can stake a claim to have been first with the whiskey, er, whisky.
Just so long as he doesn’t do it on the other person’s turf.
From monastery to market
The first recorded indication of distilling in Scotland is an entry in
the Exchequer Records of 1494 showing that eight bolls (from bowls)
of malt were purchased by one Friar John Cor “to make aquavitae.”
Eight bolls, the equivalent of three bushels of grain, can be distilled
to produce about 1,500 bottles of whisky. So it may be deduced either
that the monks had a great thirst or that Father Cor had developed
an extensive market for his whisky. Which conclusion is true
remains an historical mystery.
What is known, however, is that small “cottage” distilleries were the
norm in Scotland until 1644 when, noting the large quantities of
whisky (and profits) being made up north, the British Parliament
decreed an excise tax of approximately two shillings per gallon on
all whisky made in the United Kingdom.
Over the next few hundred years, the excise tax was regularly
adjusted up or down depending on the price of the grain used to
make the whisky.
But in the process, a funny thing happened in Scotland. With the
government unwilling or unable to make up its mind on how high
or low the whisky tax should be, the Scots took things into their
own hands and hid their distilleries from the tax collectors.
Thus, the finest of the Scottish whisky distilleries came to be located
in secluded hidden valleys (glens), primarily in a section of Northeast
Scotland known as The Highlands.
The local farmers tucked their distilling equipment away, out of
sight of the revenue agents. These agents were known as gaugers
because their job was to check the gauges on the stills to make
sure that the government knew exactly how much alcohol was
being distilled and could tax it appropriately.
But as the business grew, distillers became creatively adept at
hiding their whisky-making apparatus. For example, one popular
legend tells of a smuggler (which is what the gaugers called the

distillers) who disguised his still as a bagpipe. (But maybe that’s
just a legend.)
The “smugglers” take 
to the high seas
The hidden Highland glens, dotted with hidden distilleries, became
centers for merchants who bought the whisky and sold it in the
surrounding towns and cities. Soon, the Highlanders were looking
for markets elsewhere in the world.
Surrounded as they are by water, the Scots — like the Irish — are
shipbuilders and sailors, so they quickly took to exporting their
whisky by sea. They set sail from cities on the eastern coast of
Scotland, such as Dundee, which soon became known as smuggler’s
ports. The British authorities could do little to stop the practice.
This kind of Wild West behavior continued until 1823 when the
British Parliament — learning of the tens of thousands of hidden
stills and salivating at the thought of the taxes lost to the secret
distillers — passed yet another Excise Act.
This time, the British Parliament took two steps forward by
 Licensing distillers so as to regulate production
 Lowering the taxes while streamlining tax collection
In other words, the legislators made distilling a legal business.
Initially, the Scots resisted, thinking that the Brits were about to
turn gauging into (forgive the pun) gouging. But the first distillery
license was issued in 1824 to a highly respected Scottish landlord,
George Smith, on a farm owned by the Duke of Richmond and
Gordon. Smith named his distillery Glenlivet for the Livet River 
on whose banks it sat, and he called his whisky The Glenlivet to 
distinguish it from all the others in the area.
He also carried two guns whenever he left home to take the prod-
uct to market. He made it through the early times well enough to
see his sons take over the distillery, which they in turn passed on
to their descendants.
As the distillers prospered, so did their reputation, especially in
the lands of the British Empire on which “the sun never set.” In 
taverns from New Zealand to the Caribbean, those who requested
whisky were handed one of the many Scotch varieties. And so it
continues until this very day.
Chapter 5: Saluting the Scots 81

Making Scotch Whisky
Geologically, Scotland is a fascinating and complex land mass.
 Some of the earth’s oldest rock formations jut up through the
rich top soil of Islay off the southwest coast.
 Twelve percent of the country’s total land area is composed of
peat-rich bogs.
 The country is surrounded by the sea on three sides — east,
west, and north; and the land itself glistens with clear deep
lakes and rushing streams left by melting glaciers.
As for the climate, Scotland experiences not only the Arctic chill
but also the Gulf Stream’s temperate breezes. John O’Groats, the
northernmost town on the Scottish mainland, lies within a shout 
of the Arctic Circle. And those Gulf Stream breezes blow
across the southwest coast, carrying invisible microorganisms
that feed the flavor and aroma of Scotland’s grains while distribut-
ing the heathery particles that enhance its water.
Together, these elements of geology and climate combine to pro-
duce the characteristic Scotch whisky flavor: heathery and slightly
briny with an occasional medicinal (actually mineral) tang.
The Scottish difference
Like all whisky, Scotch is a product of grains and water. In this
case, the predominant grain is Scottish barley, sometimes with an
added dash of Scottish oats. The water may come from a stream
rushing down from a granite hilltop, a quiet river, a deep well, or a
pond or loch (preferably one without a hidden monster). Each has
Part II: Whiskeys from Around the World

What’s in a name? Plenty
This chapter makes liberal use of the words Scots, Scotsmen, Scottish, and Scotch.
Although they seem similar, they really do have different meanings.
As any Scotsman will tell the visitor who accidentally calls him Scotch, “Laddy,
Scotch is what you’re drinking. We are the Scots who make it right here in
Scotland.”
To which the visitor may graciously reply: “Aye, Scotch is made only in Scotland by
Scots, which makes it Scottish in origin.”

its own specific combination of minerals (or lack thereof), and
each carries a hint of one or more of the three indigenous species
of Scottish heather, each with its own flavor and aroma notes.
As you can read in Chapter 2, in most cases, when grain arrives at
a distillery, it’s stripped of its outer covering, cleaned, and sent on
to be mixed with water into the mash from which whisky is distilled.
The Scots, however, add a step or two of their own design: First,
they malt the barley. Then they dry it over heat from fires fueled by
peat. And that makes all the difference.
Malting
In a Scottish distillery, after the barley is cleaned and soaked in
water, the damp grain is spread out on a large surface in a malt
barn to germinate (sprout). Originally, the distillery floor served
this purpose.
The germinating mass is stirred regularly, traditionally by men with
shovels who toss the stuff into the air to turn the grain and prevent
it from overheating. As the grain germinates, enzymes in the grains
are activated to convert its starches to sugars, making it easier for
the yeasts introduced later in the game to ferment the mash.
After a week of germinating, the malted barley is dried by a heat
source operating at a temperature of about 158 degrees Fahrenheit
(70 degrees Celsius). That temperature is warm enough to stop the
fermentation and dry the grain but low enough not to interfere
with the activated enzymes.
Perfect peat
In traditional Scottish distilling, the fuel that fires the heat is peat.
Peat is a natural material found in swamps or bogs where minerals
leached from decomposing plant matter over several thousand
years form a solid layer that prevents decomposing plants from
sinking into the muck.
The plant matter builds up layer after layer to create the high-carbon
peat. (How high is the carbon? Here’s a hint: Heat it under pressure,
boil away the liquid, and you get coal.)
Most peat is found in northern latitudes where it may cover as much
as 5 percent of the land. Many people have been smart enough to use
peat as fuel, but only in Scotland has peat assumed a leading role in
the production of whisky.
Each year, from April to September, the Scots harvest their peat,
which is to say they
Chapter 5: Saluting the Scots 83

1. Pull on their hip boots.
2. Go into the bogs.
3. Cut into the peat to a specified depth.
4. Lift out the peat.
5. Compress the peat into “bricks” that are approximately 
24-x-6 inches.
After they harvest the peat, they bundle the bricks, label the bundle
with the name of the bog from which it came, and ship the stuff off
to various distillers. Each of those distillers has his own require-
ments for the peat used to make his whisky. For example, one may
prefer peat from Glen Machrie, a bog in Islay noted for its salt air
tang, whereas another likes one from Scotch’s leading home near
the River Spey.
The peat used to fuel the fires that dry malted barley imparts its own
flavors and aroma. Like some wine enthusiasts who can taste a wine
and then identify the place where the grapes were grown, some
Scotch drinkers swear they can taste a Scotch and tell you where
the peat that heated the mash that made the spirit came from.
In any event, after the malted barley is dry, it goes off to be distilled,
a process that, in Scotland, is pretty much the same as everywhere
else whisky is made.
Distilling the whisky
After the grain is dried, it’s ground into coarse flour and mixed with
water to make a mash. The mash is heated to set those enzymes
humming to convert the grain starches to sugars so that when
yeasts are added, they can easily ferment the mash.
As Chapter 2 explains in excruciating detail, spirits are produced in
two kinds of stills: the pot still and the column still.
The chief virtue of the pot still is, surprisingly, its limited capacity,
which makes it possible for the still master to exercise tight con-
trol over the specific flavor and aroma composition of his spirits.
The column still, on the other hand, dramatically increases the
amount of spirits a single distiller can produce. At the same time,
the column still allows a still master to capture distillates with 
specific levels of flavor and aroma compounds.
Part II: Whiskeys from Around the World 
84

By a happy accident of history, the column still appeared just as
the population of Scotland grew and many of the local Scottish
crofts (farms) began to disappear. Those crofts had been growing
the barley used in Scottish distilleries, so their disappearance
required distillers to buy their grain from new vendors.
Using the new still made it possible for the distiller to minimize the
flavor and aroma discrepancies caused by using grains grown in
different soils. Individual single malt whiskies may not taste exactly
the same as they did when the distiller made them from the same
local grain time after time. But a skilled distiller could blend single
malt whiskies to produce a beverage whose quality remained con-
sistent time after time after time.
Stop! If your reaction to the preceding paragraph was, “Say what?”
do not pass go, and do not wait one minute more before turning to
Chapter 2. That chapter explains every single sentence you’ve just
read and everything else you need to know about distillation. Then
come back here to find out how Scotch whisky also benefits from a
classic selection of grains and water from which the initial mash is
made and the special fuel most often used to heat the mash.
To find out what’s in that Scottish glass, read on.
The Styles of Scotch Whisky
The Scots produce two broad categories of whisky: single malt
whiskies (one whisky from a single distillery) and blended whiskies
(a mixture of two or more whiskies from two or more distilleries).
The Scotch Whisky Association (SWA) is the trade organization
representing the people who distill, blend, and export Scotch
whisky. In 2005, the SWA issued a new set of names for five styles
of Scotch whiskies. According to the SWA:
 Single malt whisky is one whisky from one distillery, distilled
from 100 percent malted barley.
 Single grain whisky is one whisky from one distillery, distilled
from one grain or a mixture of grains, commonly up to 20 per-
cent malted barley and up to 80 percent other grains, such as
wheat or corn.
 Vatted or blended malt whisky is the traditional Scottish
blended whisky, consisting only of single malt whiskies, which
may come from more than one distillery.
Chapter 5: Saluting the Scots 85

 Blended grain whisky is made of a mixture of grain whiskies
from more than one distillery.
 Blended Scotch whisky, a more recent innovation, is a blend
of whiskies, commonly made of 20 to 40 percent single malt
whisky plus 60 to 80 percent grain whisky, usually from several
distilleries.
Although these categories are technically correct and so important
for distillers, most Scotch drinkers are just fine dividing their favorite
whisky into two broad groups: straight (single) malt whiskies and
blended whiskies.
Regardless of type, by law, Scotch whisky must be aged for three
years. However, many distillers age their whiskies for longer periods
of time to continue the smoothing process that adds flavor and
color to the product. For example, most single malts are aged from
8 to 15 years. Some special products may be aged as long as 21
years — old enough to be able to order a drink themselves at any
American tavern, bar, or watering hole.
The milder blended whiskies have become increasingly popular,
accounting for more than 90 percent of the Scotch whisky sold
worldwide. But the Scottish single malts remain distinctive prod-
ucts, valued by connoisseurs who recognize each as an individual
product of a specific whisky-making region in Scotland.
The whisky-making regions of
Scotland: Where the single 
malts come from and the 
blends are born
Early on, the Scots realized that the whiskies made in one distillery
in one glen differed in flavor and aroma from whiskies made even
in a neighboring distillery in the next glen.
As each distiller gathered a coterie of fans for his production, he
learned to keep his recipe of grains, water, yeast, and peat a closely
guarded secret. Considering the combative nature of the early
Scots, that was probably a good idea.
In 1784, the British tax collectors made the first stab at differentiat-
ing the Scottish whisky-making regions by drawing an imaginary line
through Scotland from near Dundee in the east to Greenock in the
west. Distilleries south of the line were said to be in The Lowlands;
those north of the line were in The Highlands.
Part II: Whiskeys from Around the World 
86

Eventually, to lower the tension and, more importantly, to identify
relatively similar products, the Scots themselves divided the coun-
try into five specific regions, a version of the “appellations” by
which the French first characterized their wines.
The whisky-making regions of Scotland are five broad geographic
areas: The Lowlands, The Highlands, Campbeltown, Islay, and
Speyside. Figure 5-1 is a map of Scotland showing these regions.
Figure 5-1: Where the Scots make their whisky.

Chapter 5: Saluting the Scots 87

Eventually, the SWA may (or may not) grant an appellation to a sixth
area, known as The Islands. This area includes locations such as
the Orkneys off the northern tip of Scotland, and Arran, Jura, Mull,
and the Isle of Skye off the west coast.
Table 5-1 shows which single malt whiskies are produced in the dif-
ferent Scottish whisky-making regions; you can find more than 100
distilleries in Scotland, so this list is only a sample of those most
likely to be readily available in U.S. liquor stores and bars. For a

The Lowlands
The identifying characteristic of Lowlands whiskies — which are
primarily grain whiskies — is their mild, pleasing flavor.
Originally, Lowlands whiskies were used primarily for blending
with the more robust whiskies from The Highlands. Today, the 
few remaining brands of Lowlands single malts are a fine entry
level beverage for folks just beginning to taste Scotch whiskies.
The Highlands
Highland whiskies are made as far north as the Orkney Islands (the
most northern point in the British Isles), as far south as the coun-
try around Glasgow, and in some of the islands off the west coast
of Scotland. If even one constituent of the whisky comes from The
Highlands, the whisky is a Highland whisky. For example, Glengoyne
is considered a Highland whisky because the water used to distill it
comes down from the north.
Part II: Whiskeys from Around the World 
88

The size of the area is so large that some experts divide it into 
the northern Highlands, the central Highlands, and the southern
Highlands. So, it isn’t surprising that when most people say “Scotch
whisky,” what they mean is the whisky from The Highlands, known
for its peaty flavor and the briny hints of seawater.
The single malts of The Highlands remain popular with connois-
seurs, but as consumers came to prefer milder whiskies, many of
the Highland distillers closed. Today, most whiskies from The
Highlands are used to lend strong flavors to blends made with
milder whiskies from other regions.
Campbeltown
One school of thought says that Campbeltown is the site of the
first distillation of Scotch whisky. In any event, at one point, more
than 30 licensed distilleries were working there; today only one —
Springbank — still makes and markets single malt whisky. The rest
of the Campbeltown production goes for blending.
Islay
Islay (pronounced eye-lay) is the most important of the coastal
islands. Several well-known brands of Scotch whisky are made
here, and Islay is historically significant for its contribution to 
the flavor and aroma of classic Scotch whisky.
Islay whiskies are quintessentially Scottish, briny with the sea
breezes and heavily peaty because the island is virtually one big
peat bog. Modern Islay still makes distinguished single malts, 
such as Laphroaig, but most Islay whiskies, like those from The
Highlands, go into blends.
Speyside
Speyside rightly bills itself as the distilling capital of the world. No
other Scottish region is as well known; more to the point, more than
half of all the malt whiskies distilled in the world are made in this
region. It stretches between Inverness on the west and Aberdeen
on the east, around the watershed of the Spey (Great Britain’s
longest river) and the legendary Livet.
Blended Scotch whiskies
In 1853, the Scots enacted a law making it permissible to vat
(blend) whiskies. The idea was to give small local distillers a way
to compete with the new, large distilleries. The smaller distilleries
were using pot stills to create relatively small quantities of single
Chapter 5: Saluting the Scots 89

malt whiskies. The large distilleries, on the other hand, were using
their new column stills to turn out humongous quantities of spirits
that could be blended to match the quality of the single malts.
Vatted whiskies produced by individual distillers are as distinctive
as single malts. As the popularity of the vatted whiskies grew, fans
of the new and unusual blends began to demand that their local
whisky merchants offer similar products for sale.
The merchants complied with alacrity, ordering single malts from
various distillers and blending them in unique combinations some-
times labeled with the merchant’s own name — or the name of a
very special customer who requested his own vatted blend.
The first of the locals to create a widely appreciated vatted brand
was Andrew Usher, a stillmaster who created Old Vatted Glenlivet
using whiskys from the Glenlivet distillery. By careful selection and
blending, other independent distillers were soon making and sell-
ing vatted blends.
The individual “recipes” were a closely guarded secret passed down
from generation to generation, sort of like the formula for that well-
known cola. But to the educated whisky drinker’s palate, the flavor
of the vatted blends was more complex and challenging than the
single malts, and that made them an increasing success.
To eliminate any confusion, the SWA is planning to add another
category to its listing of permissible whisky types — blended grain
whisky. This is a blend of grain whiskies from a number of different
distilleries; the more selective vatted whisky is a blend of malt
whiskies and grain whiskies.
Blended grain whiskies have a milder flavor and softer finish than
single malts. They also offer another advantage: Because blended
whiskies can be made in very large batches at very large distiller-
ies, they’re usually less costly to the distiller and less expensive for
the consumer. As a result, vatted whiskies are now a disappearing
specialty not widely available outside Scotland; blended whiskies
have become the most recognized global Scotch whisky names.
However, in the 1990s, some major distillers of blended whiskies
extended their offerings to include vatted malt whiskies. That
makes an interesting way of comparing the two types.
Table 5-2 lists some of the better-known vatted malt whiskies and
blended whiskies. In fact, the blended whiskies listed in Table 5-2
are the top ten most popular worldwide.

Tasting Scotch Whisky
No, you don’t have to put on a kilt or even a clan scarf or tie. But if
you want to taste Scotch whisky, you do have to be prepared for
some pretty intense flavors and aromas.
The following sections lay out the qualities you should expect to
find in a glass of good Scotch, along with guidelines for an intelli-
gent evaluation of the whisky.
Can’t wait? Don’t want to read through all those directions?
Okay: Indulge yourself with a quick and simple comparison of two
well-known, well-loved examples of the best Scotland has to offer.
The Glenlivet is a quintessential single malt whisky with a clean,
round flavor and aroma. Johnnie Walker Black holds the same
status among the blends.
So here goes:
1. Pour an ounce of The Glenlivet into a glass.
2. Pour an ounce of Johnnie Walker Black into a second glass.
3. Let the whiskies sit for a few minutes to “open up.”
4. Now sniff one. Taste one. Clean your palate with a piece of
white bread. Sniff the other. Taste the other.
5. Note the differences.

In general, most people find that The Glenlivet offers a pleasing but
less complex flavor and aroma than the Johnnie Walker Black. That
really isn’t surprising: The Glenlivet is a single whisky, and Johnnie
Walker Black is a blend of several.
But what about the rest of the brands on the shelf? Has this simple
comparison engaged your intellect as well as your sense of taste and
smell? If your answer is “No,” well, at least you’ve found two Scotch
whiskies you enjoy. That’s good. If your answer is “Yes,” you’ve dis-
covered the challenge in the Scotch. That’s better, so read on.
Creating the tasting sheet
Slow down: Before you start to put your tasting together, set up
your tasting sheet, a piece of paper on which you can record your
very own personal evaluation of each whisky you try. The tasting
sheet in Chapter 3 should suit your needs perfectly.
Choosing your samples
Blended Scotch whiskies may be the most popular worldwide, but
the prevailing opinion among serious Scotch drinkers is that the
only true Scotches are the single malts.
They have a point. After all, the single malts were the first Scotch
whiskies, and they remain distinctly individual to this day.
But your personal tastes may not agree with the experts (some
may call them “snobs”). To decide for yourself on which side of 
the Scotch divide you stand, sample some single malts, preferably
one from each of the regions listed in Table 5-1. Then move on to
the blends, choosing one relatively young brand with no age on the
label (minimum is three years) and one older (aged more than ten
years).
Sit down, pour your whisky, see what it looks like in the glass, swirl
it around for a couple of seconds, watch the “legs,” and then put
your nose into the glass to inhale its heady aromas. Finally, taste
its complex flavor profile while — between sniffs and sips — reciting
this traditional Scottish toast:
May the best ye’ve ivver seen be the worst ye’ll ivver see.
May the moose ne’er leave yer girnal wi a tear-drap in its ee.
May ye aye keep hail an hertie till ye’r auld eneuch tae dee.
May ye aye jist be sae happie as A wuss ye aye tae be.
Part II: Whiskeys from Around the World 
92

For those of you who don’t speak Scottish and are wondering what
that moose is doing tramping around the tasting table, this toast
translates to:
May the best you have ever seen be the worst you will ever see.
May the mouse never leave your grain store with a tear drop 
in its eye.
May you always be hale and hearty until you are old enough 
to die.
May you always be as happy as I always wish you to be.
Could na’ ha’ sayd it better meself.
Appreciating the appearance
The color of a single malt Scotch can range from perfectly clear as
it comes off the still, through pale to warm gold as it ages in the
barrel or cask, to the deep brown color of treacle, the British, sorry,
Scottish word for a type of fancy molasses.
Aging also makes the whisky more viscous. If you swirl the glass so
that the liquid runs up the sides and then slowly slides down again,
the amount of time it takes for the whisky to puddle in the bottom
of the glass gives a hint of how long it was aged: The longer the
aging, the slower the slide.
Inhaling the aromas
Two groups of aromas are characteristic of Scotch whisky. The first
group includes aromas associated with the distilling process: The
choice of grain and water and, for malt whiskies, the use of peat to
dry the grain. The second group includes aromas derived from the
barrels in which the whisky is aged.
Aromas associated with grain, water, and distillation are often
described as
 Leafy
 Flowery or floral
 Fruity or fragrant
 Grassy
 Leathery
Chapter 5: Saluting the Scots 93

 Tobacco scented
 Smoky (wood smoke, “peaty”)
 Iodine and seaweed scented
Aromas associated with aging in wooden barrels include:
 Bourbon and sherry scented (from previously used casks)
 Buttery
 Honey scented
 Nutty
 Piney
 Resinous (from the resins in the wood)
 Vanilla scented
 Woody (an undesirable aroma in very old whisky)
Tasting the flavors
Like the aromas of Scotch whisky, the flavors originate either with
the basic materials (grain and water) and the processing of the grain
(malting with peat) or in the barrel.
Some of the flavors most frequently identified in Scotch whisky are
 Fruity: apple, citrus fruits, and dried fruits, such as apricots,
prunes, and raisins
 Malty: cereal, grain
 Nutty: aniseed/licorice, walnuts
 Peaty: antiseptic, smoky
 Sweet: chocolate, treacle/molasses, vanilla
 Spicy: cinnamon, cloves, ginger, nutmeg
Don’t be discouraged if at first you fail to identify each of these fla-
vors and aromas in your glass.
The secret of expert tasting is practice. Sniff, sniff, sniff. Sip, sip, sip.
Eventually, with time, without your noticing, you become — ta da! —
an expert.
What could be more rewarding or delicious?
Part II: Whiskeys from Around the World 
94

As the tasting guide in Chapter 3 explains, adding water to spirits
changes the flavor (and the color, too, but you knew that). For a
complete Scotch tasting experience, add water — equal to the
amount of whisky in the glass — and go through the flavor tasting
steps again. Note the differences.
Planning a Scotch-Friendly Meal
Scotch whiskies range from sweet and light to medicinal and really
full and round (translation: strong stuff). Either variety is a fine
introduction to dinner, either straight, with a mixer, or in a cocktail
(such as a Whisky Sour, the recipe for which is in Chapter 15 along
with nine other classic spirits cocktails).
The Scots serve hearty soups, such as Cock-a-leekie (chicken and
leeks), followed by fine smoked salmon, good grouse, or other wild
fowl, world-class Aberdeen Angus beef, lovely cheese, perfect
scones, and heavily-buttered shortbreads.
But the absolutely, definitely, singularly Scottish dish is haggis, 
a mixture of minced sheep lungs, liver, and heart, plus oatmeal,
onions, spices, suet (hard fat from around a cow or sheep’s kid-
neys), and broth, stuffed into a sheep’s stomach, which is then
sewn up and boiled for many, many hours.
Haggis is traditionally served with neaps and tattles (mashed turnips
and potatoes) on Burns Night, January 25, which marks the birth-
day of the most beloved Scottish poet Robert Burns; or on Hofmann
(New Year’s Eve); or whenever else the Scots want it during the year.
Considering how difficult it may be to scare up sheep innards out-
side of Scotland, people wishing to try haggis often order directly
by mail from Scottish purveyors such as
 Scottish Food Overseas at www.scottishfoodoverseas.com
 Scottish Gourmet Food at www.scottishgourmetfood.co.uk
When dinner’s done, the perfect ending is a Scotch whisky liqueur,
such as Drambuie. With just 165 calories, no fat, no cholesterol, no
sodium, a delicious honey/Scotch taste, and only 13 grams of carbs,
it sure beats a slice of chocolate cake.

Traveling through Distillery Land
As any travel brochure plainly shows, Scotland is definitely pictur-
esque. Castles, including the one that inspired Shakespeare’s
Macbeth, stone bridges, woods, streams, rivers, and lush meadows
glowing with heather abound. And every single one of them is
wrapped in history and legend.
For specifics on traveling to Scotland, check out (what else?) Scotland
For Dummies, 4th Edition, by Barry Shelby (Wiley). And, of course,
the Scotland’s National Tourist Board offers info on everything
from travel to tastings at www.visitscotland.com.
Just be sure that after you trek through the classic tourist sites —
What? You were thinking about not visiting Dunsinane Wood? — you
make time for a tour of one of the famous distilleries.
Scotland is home to more than 100 distilleries — too many to list
here. Many offer elaborate visitors’ centers; some offer space for
you to linger overnight. You can locate the one you want to visit by
simply typing its name into your favorite search engine. Or you can
take the easier route and let your travel agent make the arrangements.
Either way, despite the scurrilous rumors about Scottish stinginess
and dour approach, probably circulated by Those People from The
South (you know, the Sassenachs), wherever you go, you’ll be met
with warm hospitality.
And, although only 2 percent of all the Scots in Scotland speak
Gaelic, most of them know and often use this phrase: Ceud Mille
Failte (cay-ut mell-uh falsh-uh), which is Gaelic for “100,000
Welcomes.”
To which one may honestly reply: “You, too.”

American Cousins: Bourbon
and Tennessee Whiskey

 Quashing the Whiskey Rebellion
 Discovering how Bourbon got its name
 Tracking the origins of Tennessee whiskey
 Enjoying the flavors
 Pairing the whiskeys with food
O
ne sounds French, the other definitely Southern, but both are
pure Americans, born in what President Lyndon Johnson used
to call “the good ole’ U.S. of A.”
Bourbon and Tennessee, the whiskeys, owe their allegiance to their
home country; to the early American hatred of “taxation without
representation”; and to the entrepreneurial aims of frontier farmers
looking to wring the highest profits from a surplus of very good
corn, rye, and other grains.
For generations, these whiskeys gained little attention either at home
or in foreign lands. Then the Japanese discovered their uniqueness
and their global businessmen introduced Bourbon and Tennessee
whiskey to more and more upscale drinkers around the world.
Today, American whiskey sales outpace those of any other type.
There must be some good reasons for that. Indeed there are, and
this chapter deals with many of them.

Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit 
of . . . Whiskey?
In 1791, as the infant United States was creating itself, economic
problems reared their ugly heads: The U.S. lacked the revenue nec-
essary to implement a Westward expansion. So, Alexander Hamilton,
the first U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, proposed to pay the cost of
defending settlers against the Native Americans by instituting the
country’s very first “sin tax” — 25 percent on the value of the total
output of every still in the country.
After all, who could complain about encouraging “temperance upon
the human body and mind”? Dr. Benjamin Rush (1745–1813), the first
Surgeon General of the United States, encouraged temperance, or
moderation, in drinking. Rush also quelled a yellow fever epidemic
in Philadelphia and said that alcohol could provide “nourishment,
when taken only at meals and in moderate quantities.” An excise tax
could help promote that ideal by making whiskey more expensive
and therefore driving it out of reach of the working class.
Because of the superb grain, soil, and climate in Pennsylvania, vir-
tually all early American farmer-distillers were located in that state.
As a result, Hamilton’s tax fell most heavily on Pennsylvania farmers,
particularly those in the least populous Western part of the state.
Most of the farmer-distillers believed passionately — and probably
correctly — that the new tariff would pretty much eliminate any
chance of turning a profit by converting their surplus grains to
their most valuable cash crop — whiskey.
In addition, the independent Pennsylvanians regarded a federal tax
on local produce a usurpation of the Commonwealth’s power to
tax its own — just one more in an increasingly growing list of the
federal government’s interventions in their daily lives.
At first, the farmers simply grumbled, hoping that Congress would
kill the tax plan. That didn’t happen, and Congress accepted
Hamilton’s proposal. When it went into effect in 1793, federal mar-
shals were sent to Western Pennsylvania to serve writs on every
farmer in the region who operated a still. The writ was to be heard
in the nearest court, which was located in Philadelphia, hundreds
of miles away. It ordered each of them to pay a tax of at least $250
or be shut down.
Whether or not the tax was justified, the Feds had picked the wrong
place to start.
Part II: Whiskeys from Around the World 
98

Rumbling to rebellion
Early on, Western Pennsylvania — sometimes nicknamed Tran-
sylvania by its residents because it was the boundary between 
the well-settled East and the still-wild territories over the Appalachian
Mountains — petitioned Congress to be recognized as the 14th
colony. Congress said, “No way,” and the Westerners never forgot
the slight.
In 1794, a presently unknown federal marshal walked onto the Oliver
Miller family farm in Allegheny County to serve his writ. Farmer Miller
said, “No way,” and told the law officer to take a hike.
The marshal stood his ground. Neighbors hearing the fuss came to
Miller’s aid. A shot was fired. The mob grew violent and the violence
quickly spread to other areas. In a nearby county, the tax assessor’s
home was burned, and thus began the conflict that came to be
known as The Whiskey Rebellion. This event made history as the
first time federal troops were used to quell an “insurrection” in 
the new nation.
In due course, Oliver Miller, scheduled to be tried for dissing the
federal marshal, was accidentally shot. The farmers got the idea
that the government wasn’t really heeding their grievance. Various
town meetings were held, including one in Bradford, where a local
voluntary militia formed to confront the attackers.
Back in Philadelphia, President Washington decided that, in order
to protect the issue of Federalism versus state’s rights, he had to
put the rebellion down with a show of real force. He ordered the
governor of Virginia to take charge of the federal troops. That gov-
ernor was Revolutionary War hero, General “Lighthorse” Harry Lee;
he was also the father of Robert E. Lee. To make the order to send
Lee to Pennsylvania, Washington used the Militia Law of 1792 for
the first time. This law still permits the president to “execute the
laws of the union and suppress insurrections.” Washington ordered
militia from four states bordering Pennsylvania to restore order in
the Western part of that state. Connecticut, New York, New Jersey,
and Virginia all responded by sending troops to carry out a
Constitutionally approved order.
One historical record reports that 13,000 troops (more than fought
the British in any single battle of the American Revolution) moved
into the Western Pennsylvania region. The rebellion ended swiftly
with only two fatalities reported (Miller and another rebel). When
it ended, two men were convicted of treason, but Washington par-
doned them. Some farmer-distillers grudgingly accepted the tax
and returned to making their rye whiskey.
Chapter 6: American Cousins: Bourbon and Tennessee Whiskey 99

But some of the more independent souls packed up and trekked
over the Allegheny Mountains to a whole new, wide-open, whiskey-
making region: the Ohio Territory. After all, the motto of their home
state proclaimed “Virtue, Liberty, Independence.” As far as they
were concerned, the move backed up that motto fully.
Over the mountains
At the time, much of the present states of Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio
were claimed by other states, such as Virginia and New York. In
addition, the territory had been the Algonquin tribes’ land until
they signed treaties with the United States after the defeat of their
French allies during the French and Indian Wars.
The new settlers from Pennsylvania discovered that their move 
to the “land beyond the mountains” was a way to escape what 
they perceived to be persecution by the federal government. It
also turned out to be the answer to farmer-distiller dreams.
The land was beautiful: rolling hills and gentle valleys with deep,
rich soil. In one direction, soft water streams and creeks flowed
through de-mineralizing limestone into rivers rushing to the ocean.
In the other direction was the Mississippi River and grass so green
it was nearly blue. As for farming the grains needed for whiskey
making, the weather was so perfect that all a farmer had to do was
put the corn and rye seed in the ground and get out of the way.
Best of all, the existing connections to Eastern markets and ship-
ping to other lands were remarkable. In Pennsylvania, farmers had
to ship their whiskey to the East in 60-gallon casks carried by pack-
horses — an inefficient and costly method. From the new territory,
they could ship their casks in much greater numbers by barges.
The barges traveled the Ohio River to Pittsburgh as well as down
the Mississippi River to New Orleans.
In other words, the Pennsylvanians had found a happy home in
what was to become Bourbon County, Kentucky.
Bourbon beginnings
Most people who know anything about Bourbon distilling know the
story of the Baptist Minister Elijah Craig who established a distillery
in Bourbon County, thus giving a name to his whiskey.
It’s a good story, but it’s not exactly true.
Part II: Whiskeys from Around the World 
100

Yes, a Reverend Craig was chased out of Virginia for religious reasons,
and he did move to Kentucky, where he set up a still. But this hap-
pened in 1780, and the place where he began turning out whiskey
was called Fayette County. In 1788, Fayette County became Woodford
County. In 1792, Woodford became Scott. However, it never meta-
morphosed into Bourbon County.
But, there was a Bourbon County for which a Kentucky whiskey
was named. In 1780, as the Ohio Territory was cut into smaller and
smaller units, the Virginians claimed a piece of it. They named it
Bourbon County after the then-current French ruling family. They
chose the name to honor the support of the French during the
American Revolution. (French troops, naval vessels, and General
Lafayette helped to blockade the British fleet at Yorktown, Virginia.)
Soon, dozens and then hundreds of small farmer-distillers were
busily making whiskey in the region. In 1792, when Kentucky became
a state, the really big Bourbon County was divided into 34 of the
present existing Kentucky counties. One of which, of course, was
Bourbon, with its famous whiskey.
The great schism: Bourbon gets 
its name, and Tennessee splits
For several decades, the still primarily rye whiskey made from the
larger Bourbon County region was called “Old Bourbon,” and served
as the area’s most important agricultural export.
Every barrel of whiskey shipped out of the area was marked on the
barrelhead as “Old Bourbon.” People in other parts of the country
saw that designation on hundreds of barrelheads and assumed
that the designation meant old (as in aged) whiskey. Of course,
inside was Old Bourbon Whiskey that was, more and more, being
made from corn. The acceptance of this designation was good for
recognition and sales, so no one was going to tell customers that
their assumption was wrong.
At some point around the mid-19th century, distillers stopped using
the designation. This decision helped consumers avoid the confu-
sion between the meaning of the name and what had become the
common practice of aging the whiskey in barrels. But almost every
corn-based whiskey made west of the Allegheny Mountains remained
“Bourbon” to distinguish it from the “rye” whiskeys made east of
the mountains. By the same token, even to this day there are
people in the East who call all whiskey “rye.”
Chapter 6: American Cousins: Bourbon and Tennessee Whiskey 101

Eventually, distillers in Tennessee sought to distinguish their spirits
from Bourbon. They added a few methods to make their whiskey
smoother and called it — no surprise — Tennessee whiskey.
Both whiskeys were well known for their sweet, smooth flavor. You
could hardly say that about the men who made them. Check out
the nearby sidebar, “The Bourbon and Tennessee whiskey boys,”
for the stories behind some of the early distillers.
Part II: Whiskeys from Around the World 
102
The Bourbon and Tennessee whiskey boys
As a profession, distilling has always attracted entrepreneurs, rogues, and wise
men. The hardy pioneers who produced whiskey in Kentucky and Tennessee all fit
somewhere in that description. But no matter where they fall on the personality
scale, they were hard-nosed, confident individuals dedicated to their choice of a
way of life.
Here are just a few of the early distiller families who remain active in making
Bourbon and Tennessee whiskey:
Colonel James Beauregard Beam (1864–1947) was the fourth generation of
Kentucky distillers. Shortly after joining the business in 1882, “Jim” Beam and his
brother-in-law Albert Hart built a new distillery that became famous for a brand they
called “Old Tub” whiskey. After Prohibition, 70-year-old Jim Beam reopened the
plant. The descendants of Jim Beam, his brother Park, and their uncle Joe are still
working in it and with Beam’s global operations. In the 20th century, the late Booker
Noe, who married into the Beam family, introduced “small batch” Bourbons to the
world.
R.B. Hayden built the original Old Grand-Dad distillery at the same time the Beam &
Hart Distillery was built, about two miles down the railroad tracks. The grandson of
a distiller who settled in Kentucky in 1796, R.B. named the brand after his grandfa-
ther and added the slogan “Handmade Sour Mash.” During Prohibition, his plant
was sold to the American Medicinal Spirits Company and was one of the few that
remained in operation, selling whiskey for medicinal and religious purposes.
George A. Dickel (c.1818–1896) was born in Darmstadt, Germany. He immigrated to
Tennessee and established a wholesale whiskey business in Nashville. In 1866, he
opened a retail liquor store. In 1888, he purchased Cascade Distillery and founded
the Dickel Company.
Jasper Newton “Jack” Daniel (1846–1911) was introduced to whiskey making as a
boy. As an adult, he moved the family still to Cave Spring, which was near
Lynchburg, Tennessee. Jack Daniel understood that if customers remembered him,
they would remember his whiskey. Therefore, he cultivated a distinctive image for
himself — he always wore a knee-length frock coat and a planter’s hat, and he grew
an elaborate mustache and goatee. Jack Daniel was active in the whiskey business
(continued)

Chapter 6: American Cousins: Bourbon and Tennessee Whiskey 103
from the Civil War until his death in 1911. He never married, so his nephew Lem
Motlow inherited the business.
Bill Samuels, Sr. was a sixth generation distiller who wanted to do things differ-
ently. To break with tradition, in 1943 he discarded his 1780 family recipe for distilling
whiskey in order to create something new. In the next few years, using local corn
and substituting winter wheat for rye, he developed Maker’s Mark. His wife Margie
created the bottle and the red wax seal. Bill, Jr. continues to run the company 
that created probably the earliest “premium” Bourbon.
James C. Crow (c. 1789–1856) was a Scottish physician who came to Kentucky in
about 1825. He emphasized sanitation and the biochemistry of fermentation in his
distilling. Oscar Pepper hired Crow as his master distiller, and their whiskeys (Old
Crow and Old Pepper) became big hits. Crow died suddenly at work and left no heirs.
Evan Williams (?–1810) was, according to Heaven Hill (which makes Evan Williams
Bourbon today), Kentucky’s “first commercial distiller.” Evan Williams established
a distillery in Louisville in 1783. A few years later, he was indicted for making whiskey
without a license. In 1797, he was elected to the town’s first Board of Trustees.
Despite (or because of) his presence, the Board’s rules included a requirement that
any “ardent or spirituous liquors” brought to meetings would be forfeited “for the
use of the Board after adjournment.”
The Pepper Family whiskey story started when Elijah Pepper came from Virginia to
be a Kentucky distiller. In 1879, Oscar’s son, James E. Pepper, moved to Lexington
and built a new distillery. He made a Bourbon carrying his name and created the
slogan “Born With The Republic” along with the trademark “Old 1776.” After James
died in 1908, the family sold the distillery and brands.
William LaRue Weller (?–1908) started a wholesale whiskey business in Louisville
in 1849. His offices were on “Whiskey Row,” a stretch of Main Street near the Ohio
River. Many of the offices there had warehouses that led directly to the paddle-
wheel steamboats that carried the whiskey to markets up and down the Ohio River.
When Weller died in 1908, two of his young salesmen bought the company. One of
those salesmen was Julian P. Van Winkle (1875–1963); during Prohibition, Van Winkle
merged the Weller Company with the Stitzel Brothers Distillery and ran Stitzel-
Weller until his death.
The Wathen Family patriarch was Henry Hudson Wathen, a distiller who came to
Kentucky in 1787. His grandson, John Bernard (J.B.), ran the family distillery from
1863 until his death in 1919 — just months before Prohibition went into effect. In
1875, J.B. and his brother Nick had built a large distillery in Lebanon, Kentucky. In
1899, they bought the Old Grand-Dad distillery and placed their younger brother
Nace in charge. They were all active in consolidating their existing whiskey inven-
tories into the American Medicinal Spirits Company (AMS), which was permitted
to produce spirits for “medicinal and religious purposes” during Prohibition. The
last of the active “Whiskey Wathens” was J.B.’s son Richard. After Repeal, he
became an executive with National Distillers, the successor to AMS.

Making Bourbon and
Tennessee Whiskey
Like all whiskeys, Bourbon and Tennessee whiskey are distilled from
grain and aged to perfection. By law, Bourbon whiskey must be
 Made in the United States
 Produced from a mash containing a minimum of 51 percent corn
 Distilled at less than 160 proof (80 percent ABV)
 Aged at least two years in new charred oak barrels (Most
Bourbons are aged longer, and any Bourbon whiskey aged 
less than four years must list its age on the label.)
Tennessee whiskey must be
 Made in Tennessee
 Produced from a mash made of 51 percent corn
 Distilled at less than 160 proof (80 percent ABV)
 Filtered through a column of charcoal made from Tennessee
sugar maple trees
 Aged for a minimum of two years in new charred barrels
Check out Figure 6-1 to see on the map where Bourbon and Tennessee
whiskey are produced.
Selecting the grain and
making the mash
The grain base for both Bourbon and Tennessee whiskey is prima-
rily corn plus small quantities of malted barely (see Chapter 2 for
more about malting), wheat, and perhaps some rye.
The grains are mixed with water, yeasts are added, and the mixture
is heated to form a mash, which is transferred to the fermenting vat.
Part II: Whiskeys from Around the World 
104

Chapter 6: American Cousins: Bourbon and Tennessee Whiskey 105
Figure 6-1: The homes of Bourbon and Tennessee whiskey.
Fermenting and producing distillate
Over a period of two to three days, the yeasts digest the sugars in
the grain, producing an alcohol distillate called distiller’s beer. The
distillers use yeasts that are either from cultured strains, which can
be many years old, or are “wild yeasts” that grow in the area and
are blown about by the wind.
The mash left after distillation is either discarded or, more likely,
made into nutritious animal feed. The acidic mash is believed to
inhibit the growth of bacteria naturally present in the air that
could possibly infect the animals.
As the yeasts do their work, they produce a watery alcohol liquid
that rises to the top of the vat. The used-up mash sinks to the bottom
and is transferred from the fermentation vat to the still for the next
step in making Bourbon and Tennessee whiskey.
Moore County
Bourbon County

Distilling the whiskey
In the still (usually a continuous or column still; see Chapter 2 for
more on these stills), the liquid is heated until the vapors rise to be
collected, condensed, and transferred to a second still. In the second
still, they’re once again heated, and the vapors are collected and con-
densed a second time.
During the second distillation “run,” the clear alcohol condenses at
120 to 130 proof (60 to 65 percent ABV). If necessary, distilled water
is added to reduce the alcohol content to 125 proof (62.5 percent
ABV) or less, depending on the amount of flavoring agents desired
in the final whiskey. The more distillation, the fewer the flavoring
agents (check out Chapter 10 for more details than you’ll probably
ever want on flavoring agents).
Changing the color and building 
the flavor: Aging
In the next distillation step, the distiller pumps the alcohol into
newly charred American oak barrels for controlled storage. After
the whiskey is deemed mature, and before bottling, it’s sent through
an activated charcoal (or similar substance) filter and can be called
“charcoal filtered” on the label.
Charring turns the clear whiskey into to a new color. Depending 
on the length of time the raw whiskey absorbs flavoring sugars
from the charred wood, the color can range from amber through
Part II: Whiskeys from Around the World 
106
The story of the wood
The sole use of American oak in aging Bourbon and Tennessee whiskey isn’t a
matter of nativism. Every type of wood used in making the barrels has a specific
hardness and porosity. In France, Limousin oak from the forests near Bordeaux is
preferred for aging wines; in other countries, Hungarian or Spanish oak is preferred
for locally made spirits.
Only the United States mandates charring the wood and the use of only new bar-
rels. When emptied, these charred oak barrels are often in great demand because
of the flavor constituents they can still impart to other whiskeys, such as Scotch. A
busy and profitable market has grown up in sale of the once-used barrels, which can
have a long second life. In order to get the perfect flavoring level, some of the old
char is often carefully scraped down to a thinner layer.

Chapter 6: American Cousins: Bourbon and Tennessee Whiskey 107
gold to as dark as bronze. The depth of the char also helps create
the final flavor because charring creates a layer of burnt wood and
a layer of caramelized sugars brought out of the wood by the heat
of burning.
Filtering
Although grain recipes may differ, the major difference between
Bourbon and Tennessee whiskey has to do with filtration. By law,
Bourbon must be charcoal filtered as described in the preceding
section. However, the regulations apply only to whiskey made in
Kentucky, allowing Tennessee distillers to come up with something
different. In the middle of the 19th century, they commissioned the
development of a different system of filtration. It was created by a
distiller named Alfred Eaton, and it’s called the Lincoln County
Process in honor of the county in which he lived.
On the distillery grounds, stacks of Tennessee sugar maples are
burned to charcoal. The charcoal is chopped into small pieces and
placed at the bottom of a vat about ten feet deep. The whiskey is
pumped from the second still into the vat, and it drips slowly over
and through the charcoal into an aging barrel. The whiskey is fur-
ther filtered in the usual manner just before bottling.
According to expert judges, the Tennessee whiskey gains a smokier,
sweeter taste than Bourbon because of the Lincoln County Process.
The Types of Bourbon
Several different terms are used to classify the types of Bourbon.
The following list cuts through the jargon:
 Sour mash whiskey: Bourbon and Tennessee whiskey aren’t
blended; they’re classified as “straight whiskey.” That makes
maintaining a consistency of flavor — and often color — 
difficult from one distillation to another. Color control is 
maintained by the addition of caramel, which has nothing to
do with the flavor. To maintain flavor consistency from year
to year, however, a distiller “saves” some of the mash from
one batch to use as a starter in the next batch. Like sourdough
bread that’s made with a starter from a previous batch of
dough, all straight whiskey is made using this starter and can
be called sour mash whiskey. The term is not an indicator of
better or lesser quality, just that the flavor and color will be
the same in one bottle as in another purchased weeks or
months later.

 Small batch Bourbons: These small batches are a modern
version of the old pot still method of making whiskey, akin to
craft distilling. The term was introduced in the 1980s by the
Jim Beam Company. A small batch Bourbon is bottled from a
small group of specially selected barrels that are blended
together in a manner similar to that of Reserve wines. These
batches are said to be “the best of the best,” but remember
that every distiller has his own interpretation of what consti-
tutes a “small batch.”
 Single barrel Bourbon: A single barrel Bourbon is bottled
from one specifically chosen cask. Obviously, the flavor de-
pends on the distiller’s ability to match the current preference
in whiskey tastes. Each bottle from the barrel should state the
barrel number on the label.
 Vintage Bourbon: The vintage is another means of moderniz-
ing Bourbon offerings. Similar to the small batch Bourbons,
these whiskeys are older than the mandated four years. As
with wines, vintage is a statement of superiority.
 Bottled-in-Bond: This method came into being in 1897 when
the federal government permitted distillers to keep their bar-
rels in government supervised warehouses for the four-year
minimum aging period. More than anything else, this was a
move to control taxation. After the minimum period, the dis-
tiller was allowed to remove his whiskey for bottling at 100
proof (50 percent ABV). Bottled-in-Bond came to be seen as a
mark of superior quality whiskey. Actually, it’s on the same
level as any straight whiskey bottled at 100 proof with no age
statement. Because of federal cost cutting, very few inspectors
are around today, so the process and the term aren’t often used.
Tasting Bourbons and
Tennessee Whiskeys
Chapter 3 explains “The Rules” of a spirit tasting. You can skip
back there for the details, or simply follow the simplified version
shown here. You can also use the tasting sheet in Chapter 3 for
Bourbons and Tennessee whiskeys.
Gentlemen, choose your whiskeys
You can find a large number of Bourbon whiskeys out there. When
you’re trying to select the one you prefer the most, pick out a few
brands to taste and do comparison evaluating as you go. This is
called a vertical tasting.
Part II: Whiskeys from Around the World 
108

Chapter 6: American Cousins: Bourbon and Tennessee Whiskey 109
Another system to try is a horizontal tasting. Choose among the
output of an individual distiller, such as Jim Beam or Heaven Hill,
and compare offerings in the different categories.
Because Tennessee whiskey has only two distillers, each producing
a limited line of offerings, choosing among them is easier.
What follows are my recommendations for a well-rounded selection.
If you intend to mix the whiskey with water, try to find distilled
water to make sure that you don’t inadvertently add additional
flavor, and use it in the form of ice cubes.
Kentucky straight Bourbon
The following Bourbons are all 80 proof (40 percent ABV) and four
years old:
 Basil Hayden’s
 Fighting Cock
 Four Roses
 Heaven Hill Old Style
 Henry McKenna
 Jim Beam
 Old Fitzgerald
 Old Forester
 Wild Turkey
 Woodford Reserve
Small batch Bourbons
If you’re looking for the “best of the best,” try one of these small
batch Bourbons:
 Baker’s Kentucky Straight Bourbon — 7 years old, 107 proof
 Booker’s Unfiltered Cask Strength — 6 to 8 years old, 125.3 proof
 Elijah Craig — 12 years old, 94 proof
 Knob Creek — 9 years old, 100 proof
Single barrel Bourbons
These bourbons are of excellent quality and can be found in better
taverns as well as a well-stocked liquor store:

 Basil Hayden’s — 8 years old, 80 proof
 Blanton’s — 12 to 14 years old, 96 proof
 Booker’s — unfiltered, undiluted, 121 to 127 proof
 Elijah Craig — 12 years old, 94 proof
 Hancock’s Reserve — 8 to 10 years old, 89 proof
 Knob Creek — 9 years old, 100 proof
 Maker’s Mark — no age given, 90 proof
 Wild Turkey Rare Breed — 6 to 12 years old, 108.9 proof
Note that Maker’s Mark is spelled “whisky,” honoring its Scotch
whisky tradition.
Tennessee whiskeys
As of this writing, Jack Daniel’s (Brown-Forman Beverages) is the only
fully operating distillery in Tennessee. The availability of George
Dickel is limited, although you may be able to find inventory remain-
ing in retail outlets. The following list goes up the ladder in price:
 George Dickel #12 — 12 years old, 90 proof
 Gentleman Jack — 4 years old, 80 proof
 Jack Daniel’s Old No. 7 Black Label — 4 years old, 80 proof
 George Dickel Special Barrel — 10 years old, 86 proof
 Jack Daniel’s Single Barrel — 4 plus years old, 94 proof
What your senses sense when you
taste Bourbon or Tennessee whiskey
The flavors and aromas of these whiskeys are similar, but Tennessee
whiskey may feel and taste smoother and smokier than Bourbon.
However, what you smell and taste when you sample whiskey (or
cheese or chocolate or lettuce, for that matter) depends to a large
degree on your own senses.
What you find smooth may not taste smooth to the person across
the table from you. In the end, what you like is what you like — and
that’s as good a guide as anything else.

Pairing Foods with Bourbon
and Tennessee Whiskey
Bourbon and Tennessee whiskeys have a mild sweet flavor that goes
well with usually salty before-dinner hors d’oeuvres and appetizers.
At the main meal, roasted meats and poultry do well with Bourbon,
but so do fruit and veggie side dishes (see Chapter 16 for recipes
of two terrific examples: Green Beans with Pine Nuts and Tennessee
Whiskey Candied Apples).
After dinner, you can pleasantly sip these whiskeys with sweet des-
serts; Bourbon is particularly good with chocolate. In fact, Bourbon
Balls — a sticky cookie made of crushed wafers, nuts, and syrup
and formed into, yes, balls before they’re rolled in cocoa — are an
old Southern favorite. To make these little wonders, type Bourbon
Balls into your favorite search engine and sit back as thousands —
okay, maybe tens — of different recipes rise up in front of your eyes.
Pick one and it’s off to the races. With a Mint Julep. The recipe for
that is in Chapter 15. Yum.

Touring the Bourbon and Tennessee
Whiskey Distilleries
You don’t need a passport or a lot of time — even a long weekend
will suffice. Several Bourbon and Tennessee whiskey distilleries

Branching out
Old-timers won’t drink Bourbon with anything other than “branch water.” This isn’t
a special water from some weird cave — it’s actually water from any swift flowing
creek. In Kentucky and its environs, a creek is often called a “branch” because it
runs into a larger stream and ultimately to the Ohio, Kentucky, or Mississippi Rivers.
There’s a reason behind this kind of aquatic devotion. The shallow creeks in the
whiskey-making regions are understandably close to the rock underneath them.
The rock around the distilleries and a good part of the region is limestone. Limestone
is a wonderful mineral for settling out aromas and flavors, and limestone water is
used almost exclusively during the distillation of Kentucky/Tennessee whiskeys.
If you’re not in the neighborhood of good limestone washed water, a reasonable
substitute is distilled water.

Pining for home
It seems that everyone in the world, from Queens to commoners, wants to see the
Kentucky Derby in Lexington’s magnificent 19th-century Churchill Downs. Before
every race, two songs are played and sung. One is the Star Spangled Banner. Guess
what the other is.
Yup, Kentucky’s national anthem, “My Old Kentucky Home,” by Stephen Foster.
Here’s a snippet:
Weep no more, my lady
Oh, weep no more, today
We will sing one song for the old Kentucky home
For the old Kentucky home far away.
Stephen Foster had it right on. So, for that matter, did Redd Stewart and Pee Wee
King when they penned “Tennessee Waltz,” the endearing country number Patti
Page and every bar in Tennessee made their theme song. Here’s a sampling:
I was waltzing with my darlin’ to the Tennessee waltz
When an old friend I happened to see.
I introduced him to my loved one,
And while they were waltzing,
My friend stole my sweetheart from me.
Those good ole’ boys and gals sure missed their homes. So sit down, hoist a glass
of the native juice, drink a toast to them, and think how lucky you are.

A
merican blended whiskey is the youngest type of all-American
distilled spirit, created after the Repeal of Prohibition in 1933.
This chapter tracks its quick rise to a place as the world’s best-
selling whiskey and its consequent fall from grace as Americans
developed a taste for global rather than homegrown spirits.
By the way, Chapter 6 is a companion to this chapter. It deals with
the two other made-in-America distilled spirits stars: Bourbon and
Tennessee whiskey. Ideally, you should have two copies of this book,
one open to Chapter 6 and one open to this chapter so that you can
read them side by side. On the other hand, you could just read one
chapter at a time. Your choice.
I end this chapter with a few tidbits about some interesting whiskeys
that are produced in other parts of the world.

The Character of American
Blended Whiskey
Six distinctive types of whiskey are made in North America:
 Bourbon
 Tennessee whiskey
 Rye whiskey
 Corn whiskey
 Wheat whiskey
 American blended whiskey
Each of these distilled spirits is made in America using methods
brought to the New World by Irish and Scottish farmer-distillers.
Because there were more of the former than the latter, Americans
spell the spirit they created whiskey (with an e) as the Irish do,
rather than whisky (without the e) like the Scots.
I tell that story in Chapter 6. Repeating the whole shebang here
would simply waste your time when you’re raring to get on with
the blended chapter. So if you need a refresher, take a minute, go
back one chapter, and read about how Americans first distilled
whiskeys. Then come back here to move ahead with the birth of
the blends, a phrase so felicitous that it’s the heading for the very
next section.
The birth of the blends
Through the advent of blended whiskeys, everything in the history
of distilled spirits seems to have happened by accident. Consider
the following:
 Accident #1: The discovery of distillation while Arab
alchemists were really looking for a way to turn base metals
into gold (check out Chapter 1)
 Accident #2: The creation of whiskey as a way to turn a profit
from surplus grain — shipping the grain to market in its origi-
nal form was more costly than using it as the base for a dis-
tilled spirit and then shipping the spirit
 Accident #3: The creation of blended whiskey to make use of
limited amounts of distilled spirits remaining in American dis-
tiller warehouses after national Prohibition began in 1919
Part II: Whiskeys from Around the World 
116

In the last half of the 19th century and the first decade of the 20th,
distilling was a booming and highly profitable business. If American
distillers wanted to (and they did), they could walk through enor-
mous warehouses — some as long as a half-mile — where hundreds,
and sometimes thousands of barrels of Bourbon sat quietly, maturing
on the racks, stacked often two stories high.
After Prohibition became the law of the land in 1919, some distillers
were permitted to sell some of their products for medicinal pur-
poses only. Others, faced with a product they couldn’t distribute
legally, simply sold off the inventory to whoever wanted it and left
the business they had worked so laboriously to build.
That changed in 1933 when Prohibition was repealed. Faced with
mostly empty warehouses, the wiser heads among the distillers
recognized that they wouldn’t be able to meet the expected new
demand for American whiskeys. But then — Eureka! They realized
they could blend the mature spirits they had left with grain neutral
spirits (the first, un-aged distillate off the still — Chapter 2 tells you
more).
Although Bourbon and Tennessee whiskey can be either straight
(made from a single grain whiskey) or blended (a whiskey from a
combination of several grains), rye, corn, and wheat whiskey are
straight. What makes American blended whiskey special is that it
was created specifically to deal with a business situation: the lack
of aged whiskeys after Prohibition ended.
A man with a plan
Actually, blended whiskeys had always been popular in North
America. From the first, Canadian distillers made blended as well
as straight whiskies. After Repeal, some canny Canadian distillers
had supplies of whiskies to sell to the United States to be used with
their young straight whiskeys. The canniest among them, with a
large inventory of aged Bourbon and rye whiskies, was a company
called Seagram.
In the words of that company’s founder, Samuel Bronfman,
“Quality Canadian and Scotch whiskies generally were blended.
I appreciated that by blending we could produce a better-tasting
product, the quality of which would be uniform year after year
and decided that we would produce blended whisky.”
Chapter 7: More Whiskeys from America and Other Parts of the World 117

The names of Bronfman’s blends were Seagram’s 5 Crown and
Seagram’s 7 Crown. (Some people thought the numbers reflected
years of aging. In fact, the “5” and “7” on the labels had been assigned
to those particular blends in a series of tastings involving a large
number different blends. These two were the winners.)
The brands were designed to enable the Seagram Company to offer
two whiskies of the “same character with slight variations.” One
(7 Crown) was priced slightly higher and thus was slightly more
profitable than the other (5 Crown).
To facilitate its move into the United States, Seagram purchased an
existing unused distillery in Lawrenceburg, Indiana. There, they
modernized the distilling equipment and renovated all the facilities
for storing, aging, and bottling the whiskeys. Within a six-month
period, they had also designed new bottles and labels for the
American market.
Then Seagram introduced its brands nationally through a new net-
work of distributors in every state. Or, as Bronfman (familiarly
known as “Mr. Sam”) reported to his Board, “In just sixty days, we
were able to tell the public that the Seagram whiskeys were out-
selling all others throughout the country.”
The sales success was buttressed with the first national spirits
advertising campaign, designed to introduce consumers to the new
whiskeys and assure them that Seagram — with more than 11 mil-
lion bottles in inventory — was not about to run out of product.
And they didn’t, in peace or in war, despite the World War II ban on
making alcohol for anything other than the war effort (such as gun-
powder). That ban did force Seagram to drop 5 Crown, but the
company made certain that its limited production of 7 Crown was
allocated evenly to its retail accounts, thus ensuring retailer loyalty
while maintaining the brand’s loyal customer base.

118
Regulating a new product
A new category of whiskey was born, and the Treasury Department, which is
responsible for taxation and trade regulations to protect consumers against bad
quality or mislabeled products, set the standards for that new whiskey.
Today, by law, American blended whiskeys are a combination of straight whiskeys
made from various grains (primarily corn, wheat, and rye) plus a minimum of 20 per-
cent grain neutral spirits — the flavorless, odorless, first distillate. Most commonly,
the whiskey is 86 proof (43 percent ABV).

When the war ended, Seagram’s 7 Crown came back with a roar,
eventually selling a total of 9 million cases a year, outpacing world-
wide sales of all Scotch whisky at the time.
Building a Blended Whiskey
Blended whiskeys don’t just happen — they’re built on the expert-
ise of experienced still masters. Those masters choose from a variety
of straight whiskeys and balance them perfectly so that what you
taste is a unified flavor in which no one whiskey overwhelms another.
Most blended American whiskeys contain fewer than ten different
spirits. But the most costly and sophisticated may have as many as
75 different straight whiskeys, plus neutral spirits, in a combination
carefully balanced to produce the same unique light, mellow, smooth
whiskey — year after year, bottle after bottle.
When first introduced, blended American whiskeys quickly came
to account for about half of all domestic whiskey sold in the United
States. Today, that’s no longer true. Over a 25-year period, starting
in the 1980s, the total market for blends was in continuous decline.
Still, their appeal and value as a mixing whiskey is so great that today
Seagram’s 7 Crown remains the leader of the category. It still sells
about 2 million cases of 7 Crown a year, and the second place brand,
Kessler, sells about 800,000 cases. And blended whiskeys can be
found “in the well” behind most North American bars where, because
of their lightness and inherent smoothness, they’re still an integral
part of almost every drink made with a whiskey.
Producing a unique American flavor
Americans didn’t invent the notion of blending whiskeys to create
a unique style of distilled spirits. The Irish and the Scots had already
done that. Quite successfully, too.
The American differences arose when Irish and Scottish immigrants
to North America began to experiment with grains native to America
and to process the grains in different ways. For example, Americans
started drying the grains in closed, smoke-free containers rather
than over hot smoking peat or other burning material.
These simple changes made a big difference. The American grains
and the smoke-free environment produced a robust but pleasant,
sweeter, and less smoky flavor that was pleasing to the American
palate. In addition, the new whiskey was great for mixing, and thus
a boon to the American preference for cocktails.
Chapter 7: More Whiskeys from America and Other Parts of the World 119

Choosing whiskeys for the blend
The spirits used in making American blended whiskeys are, to put
it simply, American whiskeys. In alphabetical order, these are
 Bourbon: Bourbon and Tennessee whiskeys (see Chapter 6),
both made from a mash containing at least 51 percent corn,
are the quintessential American spirits. By law, the only
whiskeys allowed to use these names are those made in the
United States.
 Corn whiskey: Straight corn whiskey, the predecessor to
Bourbon, was made exclusively from corn, an early marketing
ploy to use up surplus corn at a profit rather than letting it rot
in the field or storage barn.
Modern corn whiskey doesn’t have to be aged in wood, but if
it is, the barrels must be either uncharred wood (usually oak)
or used Bourbon barrels.
Straight corn whiskey, which has a strong corn taste and a
nearly clear color, is still available in limited markets in the
United States, made by local distillers. A few companies market
it by calling to mind the “moonshine” of an earlier time. One
company puts its corn whiskey into a wire-closed jar under the
name Moonshine; others use jugs similar to those that delivered
their product in old Ford flivvers straight from the backwoods
stills in the hills of various southern American states. Most
often, however, corn whiskey today is used in blending.
 Rye: Aficionados often said that anyone who liked rye bread
would love rye whiskey, but the whiskey itself has a slight 
bitterness not found in corn whiskey. As a result, rye whiskey
is less likely to be sold straight than to be used in blending
Canadian and American whiskeys. Even when it’s used in
blending, it’s used sparingly because of its higher alcohol
content and more intrusive flavor.
In Colonial days, rye was the most common grain, which is
why early American distillers, predominantly in Pennsylvania,
used it to make their whiskeys. As a result, even today
Easterners are likely to call any blended whiskey a “rye.”
Modern rye whiskey is commonly distilled at 160 proof (80
percent ABV) or less and aged in new charred barrels for a
minimum of two years.
 Wheat: Wheat whiskeys, distilled from, well, wheat, were
never very popular with American drinkers. Today, finding a
straight wheat whiskey is a near impossibility, but relatively
small amounts of wheat whiskeys are used in some American
Part II: Whiskeys from Around the World 
120

blended whiskeys as well as in a number of Canadian whisky
blends. Sometimes distillers use wheat to give a Bourbon a
flavor differentiation — Maker’s Mark is one such example.
Tasting American Blended
Whiskeys
You can find the basic rules for tasting distilled spirits in Chapter 3.
When you’re ready for an American blended whiskey tasting, you
can use the tasting sheet from that chapter as well.
Tasting Americans whiskeys is a three-part deal. To get the full
range of American flavors, you should taste American blended
whiskeys as well as rye whiskeys and, of course, Bourbon and
Tennessee whiskeys. The latter are covered in Chapter 6.
To fully appreciate the flavor of American blends, try them straight
(served cool but not cold), with water, and in a mixed drink.
 Straight: Pour about an ounce of whiskey into a wide-
mouthed old-fashioned glass. Let the whiskey sit (breathe) for
a few minutes, and then swirl and sip.
 With water: Mix the whiskey leftover from your first sip with
an equal amount of water (distilled water or branch water is
the classy version, but any plain water will do). Add ice cubes
made from pure water if you prefer. Let the whiskey and water
sit for a few minutes, and then sip.
 Mixed: The simplest American whiskey mixed drink is the
classic 7&7 (an ounce of Seagram’s 7 Crown in a tall glass plus
7-Up and ice). The classic American blended whiskey cocktail
is the Manhattan (see the original recipe in Chapter 15). In
tasting, the aim is to identify the whiskey underneath the
other fine ingredients. A fine blended whiskey should stand
up against the accoutrements.
Naturally, each of the steps listed for American blended whiskeys
works as well for rye whiskeys. The one difference: No matter
which rye whiskey you choose, the flavor will definitely carry a
bigger punch.
Choosing the whiskeys
Selecting a few from the many is part of the fun in exploring the var-
ious types of distilled spirits, including the commonplace blended
Chapter 7: More Whiskeys from America and Other Parts of the World 121

whiskey. Your local liquor store will have a number of blended
whiskeys, some flavorful enough to taste neat or with a couple of
ice cubes, and others that may be best used in mixed drinks.
Some brands are strictly regional or even local to a specific county.
Check with your knowledgeable liquor dealer to find out what’s
popular, or ask a friendly bartender what brand he finds most useful
for making cocktails (and why).
After all, tasting the whiskey made in the next town or county or
state can be just as exotic an experience as tasting one made
halfway around the world.
The list of the better-known American blended whiskeys includes
the following, all at 80 proof unless stated:
 Kessler American Blended Whiskey
 Barton 80 and 90 proof
 Calvert
 Carstairs
 Corby’s
 Guckenheimer
 Imperial
 Jim Beam 8 Star
 McCormick
 Schenley
 Seagram’s 7 Crown
The list of time-honored names in rye whiskeys — 80 proof (43 per-
cent ABV) unless indicated — are
 Jim Beam
 Michters Rye Whiskey
 Old Overholt 86 proof
 Rittenhouse Rye Whiskey 100 proof
 Sazerac Rye Whiskey 18 Years Old 90 proof
 Van Winkle Family Reserve Rye 13 Year Old
 Wild Turkey Straight Rye Whiskey
Part II: Whiskeys from Around the World 
122

Just in case you want to try a wheat whiskey, here’s one that’s
available in some markets:
 Bernheim 90 proof
Why no corn whiskey? Regional distillers make straight corn whiskey,
but it’s too costly and valuable to be put into a mass market straight
whiskey, so it’s primarily used for blending with the other whiskeys.
Blends and rye whiskeys, even the best of them, usually aren’t as
costly as other whiskeys. For example, if you’re looking at a really
good Scotch single malt whisky versus a value-priced blend, don’t
let the higher prices change your desires either way. Price isn’t an
indication of quality but of differences in the cost of production
and tariffs and such.
What you see, taste, and smell when
sampling American blended whiskey
As with all spirits, the distinctive characteristics of American blends
are their color, texture (also known as viscosity or mouthfeel), flavor,
and aroma. This list tells you more:
 Color: American blended whiskeys are traditionally a clear
amber, sometimes with an orange overtone. The darker the
color, the longer the whiskey has been aged, and — chances
are — the smoother it will taste.
 Texture (first impression): Swirl the whiskey in the glass so
that the whiskey rides up the side to the top — but not over,
please — and then runs down again. The finger-like runnels
coming down are called legs. The time it takes for the legs to
run down the side of the glass is an indication of the whiskey’s
viscosity, which is an indication of its age. The older the
whiskey, the slower the fall.
 Aroma: The aroma of American blended whiskey is slightly
sweet with an alcohol overtone. Some say it smells like
caramelized sugar (think caramels and toffee), tobacco, or
coffee.
 Texture (second impression): In your mouth, American
blends should be neither heavy nor oily, but should have a
definite mouthfeel (translation: presence in your mouth and
on your tongue).
 Flavor: American whiskeys have a pleasant, slightly sweet
flavor — no smokiness, remember — that makes them perfect
for sipping straight or mixing.

Planning an American 
Blended Meal
American whiskey is American-born, so it marries well with tradi-
tional, familiar, American foodstuffs. Here are just a few ideas:
 Bar-B-Q with a spoonful of American blended whiskey mixed
into the sauce
 Franks and beans with a spoonful of American blended
whiskey stirred into the beans before cooking
 Burgers with a spoonful of American blended whiskey mashed
into the meat before grilling
 Apple pie with a spoonful of American blended whiskey
stirred into the apples before baking
I’m sure you get the idea. Your spoon’s gonna be busy.

President George: Distiller-in-Chief
Yes, George Washington was the father of our country, “First in Peace and First in
War.” But he was also the first major American distiller.
Running a distillery requires a managerial spirit, and in the history of the United
States, few have been better managers than George Washington, the nation’s lead-
ing distiller in the later 1700s.
At its peak, his distillery at Mount Vernon turned out 11,000 gallons of whiskey a
year. The product was so popular that Washington made $7,500 in a single year 
(a lot of money back then) in sales. In 1709, the year before he died, Washington
ordered three additional copper stills and enlarged the distillery at Mount Vernon to
grow the business.
Unfortunately, after his death, his estate pulled down the distillery and put itself out
of business. But then, in 2001, using funds raised under the auspices of the Distilled
Spirits Council of the United States, the distillery was rebuilt and put back into oper-
ation using authentic 18th-century methods to make and sell souvenir bottles to 
visitors. (For the record, the retailer is the state of Virginia, which controls all sales
and distribution of all alcohol beverages within the state.)
As the gateway of the American Whiskey Trail, General Washington’s Mount 
Vernon Distillery also features a History Channel video story of the rebuilding effort,
“George Washington’s Liquid Gold,” and a museum exhibit, “Spirits of Independence:
George Washington and the Beginnings of the American Whiskey Industry.”

For those who like their spirits mixed, an interesting spot not yet on
the Trail is the Museum of the American Cocktail. The original is at
514 Chartres Street in New Orleans. Interestingly enough, it shares
the building with the Museum of Pharmacy, where the creator of
Peychaud’s bitters lived and worked in the 18th century. Another
branch operates at 3663 South Las Vegas Boulevard in Las Vegas.

Off the Beaten Whiskey Trails
Because of the global popularity of whiskeys, many other countries
in the world have been producing their own versions of blended,
single malt, and other types of grain spirits.
Some are good and some are not so good, but they’re worthy of
mention because four of these areas are getting high marks and
selling a lot of whisky in their particular regions.
Japan is the oldest producer among non-European countries where
whiskey is popular and made domestically.
India now ranks among the leading whiskey producers, and recently
an Indian conglomerate magnate bought a Scottish distillery to meet
that demand. Latest to join the party is New Zealand. The countries
“down under” have long been noted for their wines, and soon the
world will be talking about their spirits as well. And even Wales has
joined the party. Why should the Scots and Irish have all the fun?
Although many of the products made in these countries aren’t avail-
able in the U.S. or even in Europe, travelers to these lands should try
their offerings. Flying on one of the countries’ airlines should give
you at least a taste of what they have to offer.
Book the ticket. Try the whisky. It’s the only way to fly.
Japan
Initially, Japanese distillers called their whisky Scotch. But in 1988,
at the request of the U.K., the World Trade Organization ruled that
Scotch is a product of a specific geographical location and that no
other country can call its whiskey a Scotch or Scotch-type. By 1990,
this ruling was accepted throughout the world and enforced dili-
gently by U.K. authorities.
Part II: Whiskeys from Around the World 
126

However, starting as early as the 19th century, Japanese distillers —
no slouches at their trade — had learned the secrets to making
Scotch whisky. The small distilleries scattered throughout the
Japanese islands began to use pot stills to double distill their malt
whiskies using lightly peated barley. So, even though whiskies made
in Japan can’t call themselves Scotch, they do have a definite Scottish
character — smoky, rich, and aromatic.
In 1920, commercial whisky-making started when Masataka Taketsuru
returned to Japan after two years of studying chemistry and distil-
lation in Scotland. His time abroad gained him not only a Scottish
bride but also a burning determination to make Japan a factor in
the world whisky trade. His goal was to convince local distillers to
make real Scotch whisky rather than sweet-potato-based shochu
or tinted grain neutral spirits.
Eventually he convinced the company that was to become Suntory
that his idea was the way to go. When its new Scotch whisky became
popular with consumers, others soon followed. Among those prof-
iting from this burst of enthusiasm was Taketsuru himself who
formed his own company, Nikka Distillery, in 1934.
Following World War II, the sales of spirits soared and have continued
to grow. Whether the whisky is called Scotch or not, the business has
grown to the extent that Japanese corporations bought into the
Scottish distillery business. Today, they import their own Scotch
whisky brands to sell domestically.
Some leading malted grain brands now made in Japan include the
following:
 Blended whiskies: Karuizawa Master’s Blend, 10 Years Old;
Evermore 2004 Blend, 21 Years Old
 Blended malt whisky: Takesuru, 21 Years Old, Pure Malt
 Single cask whiskies: Yamazaki 119.2 proof, Japanese oak cask;
Hakushu 1982, sherry cask
 Single malt whiskies: Fuijigotenba 15 Years Old, Single Grain;
Golden Horse Chichibu 10 years old; Yamazaki 18 Years Old,
Single Malt
India
Despite the general impression, many Indian people enjoy their
whisky. Only Muslims prohibit alcohol; Hindus welcome it. The
Muslim population is only a few percentage points of the huge
Indian population. It’s not surprising then that Vijay Mallya, who
Chapter 7: More Whiskeys from America and Other Parts of the World 127

owns a $2 billion conglomerate, added to the holdings of his UB
group (for United Brewing) by purchasing one of Scotland’s top five
whisky makers, Whyte & Mackay, for $1.18 billion. In addition to
importing brands, including Dalmore and Isle of Jura brands, UB can
also import bulk whisky for sale in China to be used for blending.
Above all, he hopes to meet the demands of the Indian marketplace,
the biggest consumers of whisky in the world. In 2005, Indians drank
more than 70 million cases, and sales are growing at the rate of about
9 percent a year.
That’s big business even for a billionaire.
The only thorn in Mallya’s side is India’s high tariffs that are
presently applied to imported whiskeys (and now under adjudica-
tion by the World Trade Organization). It’s difficult to resolve this
problem because most of the whisky made in India is made from
molasses. (Chapter 12 tells you that sugar cane was first distilled
in India.) Because of that, all Indian-made whiskies must be labeled
Indian spirit or rum, according to WTO regulations. But Mallya is so
optimistic about the tariff war outcome that he’s expanding the
Whyte and Mackay distillery in Invergordon to make it the largest
in the world.
Brands to look for include McDowell’s No. 1 Brandy (said to be the
world’s best-selling brandy) and Bagpiper Whisky, India’s best-sell-
ing (more than 10 million cases a year), making it the largest selling
non-Scotch whisky in the world.
New Zealand
After many years of trying, New Zealand vintners finally started
producing some of the world’s finest white wines a few years back.
Demand now often outstrips supply. Now the self-nicknamed “kiwis”
have discovered that their low-pollution climate, soils made for
grain production, and the purest water in the world allow distillers
to make fine single malt and blended whiskies.
The distilling business is said to have been started in 1850 by one
Owen McShane who made a product called Chained Lightning.
McShane went on to produce a gin, a brandy, and a rum — all using
the root of the indigenous cabbage tree. Despite that, McShane’s
products must have been tasty because his non-tax-paying products
(moonshine) became extremely popular, bringing his activities to
the eyes of the government. In turn, the government passed the
New Zealand Distillation Act of 1865, banning all distillers making
Part II: Whiskeys from Around the World 
128

fewer than 5,000 gallons of spirits a year — in other words,
McShane and his buddies.
Over the years, New Zealand has permitted home distillation,
changed that to no home distillation, totally banned all distillation,
and finally relaxed most restrictions including those on home dis-
tillation. This naturally impeded the development of commercial
enterprises. However, today, with the assistance of investors from
Britain, the U.S., and France, the industry is slowly growing in pop-
ularity with its own people, and the word about the quality and
purity of their alcohol beverages is piquing lots of interest in the
global marketplace.
As for whiskies, Hokonui — which started life as moonshine —
sent its first shipment of single malt blends and liqueurs to France.
Other shipments followed to the U.K., Germany, and Norway. The
whiskies are distilled by the Southern Distilling Company.
It’s a definite sign of things to come. Drop in if you’re visiting New
Zealand’s South Island. It’s another reason to go to the paradise
where the population of sheep is greater than that of people and
the waters always sparkle.
Wales
Way back in the fourth century, a man named Reault Hir came to
an island off the coast of Wales and started distilling whisky. He
was the first to bring the art of making aqua vitae (or gwirod in the
local language) to Wales, probably from Ireland. The soil was per-
fect for his needs. Wales is divided geologically; the coal in the
north is separated from limestone by a range of hills. The first
whisky was made from barley, yeast, and honey distilled into a
basic raw spirit.
In 1705, a commercial distillery was started, owned by Evan
Williams’ family. That name became very familiar to Kentuckians
when the family later emigrated to the U.S. Around the same time,
another Welshman named Jack Daniel also moved across the
Atlantic, winding up in Tennessee.
In the 19th century, another distillery opened in Wales, but it was
forced to close in 1880 as a result of pressure from temperance
advocates. That was it for Welsh spirits until the current millen-
nium began with the first distillation in the new Welsh Whisky
Company’s Pendryn plant in Brecon Beacons National Park. Welsh
Whisky was the successor to a previous company, which, although
Chapter 7: More Whiskeys from America and Other Parts of the World 129

mandated to make pure and totally Welsh spirits, had cheated by
using Scotch whiskies bought in bulk for use in a blended product.
Pendryn produced a purely Welsh single malt — Welsh Gold (aur
cymru in Welsh) and, after aging, released it on Saint David’s Day
2004 to honor Wales’ patron saint. Welsh Gold is made from moun-
tain spring water that flows over peat and through porous red
sandstone and limestone caverns before coming directly into the
distillery. There it’s mixed with distilled malted barley spirits,
matured in Bourbon casks, and finished in Madeira barrels. It’s so
well regarded that Pendryn is now busily exporting it to other
nations.
Now you have yet another reason to visit this bastion of the United
Kingdom where it’s posited that once upon a time Arthur and his
court held sway at Camelot.

T
his chapter takes North American whiskeys to extremes — the
extreme North, that is — by detailing the origins of Canadian
whisky, outlining the country’s influence on worldwide whisky-
making, recommending products for tasting, and naming the foods
with which Canadians enjoy their spirits.
Starting at the Top 
(of the World)
The emergence of a special whisky from Canada is due almost entirely
to the accident of a young British orphan’s emigration across the
Atlantic in 1782 and the subsequent arrival of a family of four Russian
brothers in 1889.
Britain + Russia = Canadian whisky? In a word, yes.
Molson’s multitudinous 
accomplishments
John Molson (1763–1836), the British orphan I mention earlier in
this chapter, is best known to North Americans for the beer that
bears his name (today: Coors Molson), first brewed at a Montreal
brewery beside the St. Lawrence River. Molson bought the brewery
in 1785 by using a small inheritance left to him by his parents.

Part II: Whiskeys from Around the World 
132
Molson realized that the flat, mid-Canadian plains produced a
bountiful grain harvest — so bountiful, in fact, that the farmers
were being crushed by surplus crops year after year. Rye, in 
particular, was so plentiful that the prices kept dropping.
To get rid of the surplus, or at least find a way to profit from it, Molson
took a logical next step — the one that matters in this book. In 1799,
he opened the first grain-based distillery in Canada, thus becoming
the first commercial Canadian spirits producer and the leading
exporter of Canadian whisky.
For reasons that remain unknown, the spirits business didn’t pros-
per, so no record remains of how Molson’s whiskies may compare
with modern Canadian products.
But, this much is certain: Molson’s way of making Canadian whisky
set the pattern for an entire industry because he
 Hired a staff of (what else?) Scottish distillers
 Distilled the whisky from corn and rye
 Spelled its name the Scottish way, without an “e”: whisky
Entering the modern era with a bang
By the early 1900s, the distillation of Canadian style whisky was
standardized, but the distribution and marketing (moving the
whisky from the bottling line to the salesmen and on to the con-
sumer) wasn’t.
As in the United States, temperance groups waged a continuing
battle against “the demon rum” (or wine or whisky), so fierce that
eventually the Canadian Government decided to pass the matter
over to the various provincial (in America, “state”) legislatures for
their consideration.
John Molson was a man of many talents. Not only did he create a Canadian style
whisky, but he also went on to build the first steamship made entirely in North
America, develop a fleet of 22 steam driven vessels (including the first of its kind to
be used in war), finance the first Canadian railroad, serve as President of the Bank
of Montreal, and sit as a member (at different times) in both the Lower and Upper
Houses of the Canadian Parliament. Now that’s a busy life!
Molson’s many talents

A quick note on the birth of Prohibition in North America: As you’ll
see with other spirit types, governments were always willing to
either impose huge taxes on alcohol beverages or ban their sale
entirely (gin in England is one example). Much of that thinking
came to North America with the first European settlers.
Modern sociologists know that abstinence isn’t the same as tem-
perance. Alcohol was recognized and accepted as a medication
long before it was barred and long, long before it was recognized
as a mood-altering substance. Even though it couldn’t cure the
plague or other diseases, it worked well with pain — remember
the doctors in the Western movies who had no anesthetic?
However, the more mankind learned about this remarkable “gift
from the gods,” the better they learned how to deal with overuse
when a joyous mood turned sour. Dr. Benjamin Rush, the Philadelphia
doctor who was the first Surgeon General of the United States and
an early proponent of ways to prevent Yellow Fever, had great respect
for alcohol as a medicine, but strongly recommended temperance
in its use (or as you’d say today, moderate drinking).
When some stern moralists came to the New World, they brought
with them the belief that abstinence was the answer. Naturally they
also brought ways to bring about abstinence, the easiest of which
was a total prohibition against manufacture or distribution of the
alcohol carrying beverages.
Robert Benchley, who was a well-known fan of the Martini, once said:
“A Puritan is one who sits around all day worrying that someone
else is having a good time.”
The problem of prohibition
Having duly considered the matter of Prohibition, several provincial
legislatures chose to enact forms of enforcing abstinence. These acts
ranged from slight limitations, such as raising prices by higher tax-
ation and putting the state itself in charge of distribution through
ill-lit unappealing stores, all the way up to a total ban on the sale of
beer and spirits.
Then, in 1916, the Canadian Federal government — explaining that
all the alcohol produced in Canada was urgently needed for fighting
the “Great War” (World War I) — enacted nationwide Prohibition,
stopping the manufacture and sale of spirits and beer except for
religious and/or medical use. Not surprisingly, the number of pre-
scriptions issued for a glass of whisky every day rose astronomically.
Chapter 8: Channeling the Canadians 133

Within three years, the majority of Canadian Provincial Legislatures
declared Prohibition a failure. Every legislator didn’t agree right
away: Prince Edward Island, for example, didn’t toss out Prohibition
until 1940. Ah, well.
Governmental control of the industry
After they decided to end Prohibition, the Canadians got cracking
on a system and moved to set up rules for controlling the sale of
spirits and beer.
Each province was to control the distribution and sale of alcohol
beverages within its jurisdiction. The provinces would
 Act as a purchaser to buy the products from the makers
 Distribute products to state-owned retail stores
 Set prices at the wholesale and retail levels
 Create laws to ensure the quality of the spirits and the equally
important ethical performances of the distillers’ trade practices
The American bonus
As the Canadians were beginning to wind down their experience
with The Noble Experiment (also known as Prohibition), the
Americans were just winding up starting theirs.
The 18th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution went into effect in
1919, thus opening an incredible opportunity for enterprising
Canadians to open a huge market to the south, scooting in and out
of the coastline with real whisky, courtesy of a network of illegal
distributors called booties, short for, yes indeed, bootleggers.
The traffic was terrific until 1933 when the North Carolina became
the last of the two-thirds of the State Legislatures needed to ratify the
21st (Repeal) Amendment of the Constitution. Once again, the U.S.
was permitting the legal manufacture and sale of alcohol beverages.
After World War II, the Canadians, whose farmers were once more
growing more grain than they could profitably sell, once again turned
to converting the surplus corn and rye to whisky that they could
ship across the border. It went to an American population with a
great thirst for legal spirits and an appreciation for the fine
Canadian whiskies they had enjoyed illegally.
Part II: Whiskeys from Around the World 
134

Moving into the modern markets
Could the United States have had a successful distilling industry with-
out Canadian whisky? That may sound foolish given the fact that, as
Chapter 6 explains, Americans were making whiskey (with an “e”) for
almost a century before the Canadians entered the business.
In fact, the American whiskeys — eventually called Bourbon and
Tennessee whiskey — were rough, not very tasty, and certainly not
as pleasantly “mixable” as those made today are.
And that was America’s second gift to the Canadian distillers.
Enter the king of the Canadian whisky entrepreneurs
In 1889, four Russian immigrant brothers named Bronfman — Sam,
Allan, Abe, and Harry — opened a small inn located in what were
then the wilds of Saskatchewan.
Like so many young immigrants, the Bronfmans were ambitious.
Sam even set his sights on eventually being knighted by the King of
England, which is pretty hot stuff for a young Russian immigrant in
far-off Saskatchewan.
While operating a small hotel, Sam obtained a provincial license 
to distribute liquor. When Canada’s Prohibition dried up the local
whisky market, Sam turned his eyes to Joseph E. Seagram & Sons,
a small distillery located in Waterloo, Ontario. Banking on the even-
tual end of Prohibition both north and south of the Canadian border,
Sam purchased the company and went into the distilling business
with his brother Allan. They aimed to position themselves to fill
orders for whiskies made at the Seagram distillery, as well as imported
Scotch whiskies, first in Canada and then in the United States.
Creating a signature brand (or two)
The Bronfmans’ first big brand was Seagram’s 5 Crown, a blended
whiskey (with an “e” for the Americans who were used to seeing
their previously highly favored Irish whiskey spelled that way). It
was distilled from native American corn and bottled with a label
carrying a Seagram crest prominently featuring the words Integrity,
Craftsmanship, and Tradition.
“Mr. Sam,” as he came to be known in the trade, shied away from
personal publicity, but he believed strongly in promoting his brands
in an ethical and effective manner. For example, one widely praised
company advertisement during the Great Depression was headlined:
“We Don’t Want Your Bread Money.” The copy underneath explained
that spirits were a luxury and that basic needs came first.
Chapter 8: Channeling the Canadians 135

Seagram’s 5 Crown was so successful that the company introduced
a second signature brand, Seagram’s 7 Crown. It soon became the
most popular spirit in America, making Joseph E. Seagram & Sons
the world’s leading distiller with four of the best-selling products
of its type on the market (Calvert, Four Roses, Crown Royal, and
Seagram’s VO).
Having made their mark with American whiskeys, the Bronfmans
also scored with Canadian spirits. Seagram’s VO — the classic,
smooth, slightly sweet Canadian whisky — is still a mid-price best-
seller, while the even smoother Seagram’s Crown Royal is the 
leading premium-price Canadian.
Not bad for four guys from Russia.
What Makes a Whisky Canadian?
All Canadian distillers must follow four specific legal guidelines. As
with any whisky, it all starts with the grain:
 Canadian whisky must be distilled from a fermented mash of
wheat, corn, rye, and/or barley.
 Canadian whisky must be made entirely in Canada, but it doesn’t
necessarily have to be a single grain whisky. Canadian whisky
may be a blend of many different whiskies.
 Canadian whisky must be aged in oak casks for a minimum of
three years.
 Canadian whisky must use water that’s fresh and pure.
Part II: Whiskeys from Around the World 
136
Visiting Canada can be a wonderful tonic for the experienced traveler and an out-
standing adventure for the first time visitor. You can find much to see and do, from
Toronto’s high-spot international lifestyle and Montreal’s French culture, language,
and cuisine, all the way west to the Asian-flavored sophistication of British Columbia
and the rugged wilderness journeys into the Yukon Territory. Whether you want
skiing in the Laurentians in the winter, boating in the Great Lakes, or hunting for gold
up north, you’ll find something for everyone, and at reasonable prices too.
Traveling to Canada

Within these simple guidelines, distillers are permitted to apply
individual skills to the making of their whisky. One example: A single
Canadian whisky is often blended with others.
The guidelines not only led to the new type of whisky, but also
helped create a new culture for the blank slate that was Canada 
in the early days. Its huge land mass was lightly settled but highly
regarded for farming. The climate and topography dictate that
Canadian agriculture is most profitable when it concentrates on
growing grains such as corn, rye, and wheat. These were the 
grains to be used — with a little barley thrown in from time to 
time for variety. The new settler-farmers quickly learned that
making whisky was a wonderful way to turn surplus grains into
profits rather than burning them as rubbish.
Those farmers could often be found working in the fields with a
pottery jug filled with the glowing whisky they or a neighbor distilled.
When they rode into a nearby town for supplies, a cask filled with
local whisky was standing at the front door of the general store for
customers to dip into to clear the dust from their throats.
How Canadian Whisky Is Made
All Canadian whisky makers climb the same ladder to successful
whisky, making and arriving at the high quality alcohol beverage
that’s regarded by almost every objective expert as the smoothest
whisky made anywhere.
The distillation process that I describe here applies to the making
of all spirits, including Canadian. For a quick refresher, turn to
Chapter 2.
To create Canadian whisky, distillers follow these steps:
1. Select the grain.
The most abundant grain grown in Canada is corn, so that’s
the grain that forms the base for most individual whisky
recipes. However, each distiller uses a variety of different
types of corn, and each adds small amounts of barley, malt,
and rye so that each whisky has a different and distinctive
flavor.
Although rye is a very small part of the usual ingredient
menu, it’s the grain that adds the most flavor. When you
can smell more rye in a glass of Canadian whisky, the dis-
tiller has used more rye in the blend.
Chapter 8: Channeling the Canadians 137

2. Grind and malt the grain.
The grains that distillers use to make Canadian whisky may
first be malted (heated), much as those used in making
Scotch (see Chapter 5 for this and other similarities). Malted
or not, all grains for the mash are ground to a predetermined,
controlled level of fineness to permit the starches to reveal
all the sugars they hold.
3. Select the water.
For every gallon of spirit produced, a distillery uses as
much as 100 gallons of water. Outside of purity, the only
requirement is that the water should contain a specific
amount of lime, which is an essential element to making 
a quality whisky.
4. Cook the mash.
Under carefully controlled temperatures in sterile condi-
tions, the distiller mixes the milled grain and water into a
mash and cooks it to convert the starches into sugars as
rapidly and evenly as possible.
5. Add yeast.
Under carefully controlled temperatures and sterile condi-
tions, the distiller adds yeast (or several kinds of yeast) to
the cooked mash to start fermentation. Each distiller obtains
a number of yeasts and then uses them alone or in combi-
nation to gain the desired flavors. Those strains are then
cultivated from isolated yeasts and used for years to give
continuity of that flavor.
6. Allow for fermentation.
After about three or four days, the yeasts consume the
sugars of the cooked mash and convert them into a liquid
called distiller’s beer.
7. Distill the whisky.
The fermented mash is passed into a still and heated to boil-
ing. The alcohol vapors rising from the liquid are collected,
condensed, and cooled in a collecting vat. To reduce the
spirit to a required 86 proof (43 percent alcohol by volume
or ABV) strength alcohol, distillers add pure water.
8. Barrel the whisky.
The distiller pumps the diluted alcohol into carefully selected
wooden barrels — most often oak. (The unused mash is
drained, compressed, and generally used for domestic
animal feed.)
Part II: Whiskeys from Around the World 
138

9. Age the whisky.
The filled barrels are stacked in a temperature-controlled
warehouse for a minimum of three years. Many are aged
longer than that, some as long as 25 years. The wood of the
barrel imparts changes to the flavors of the whisky inside
for the length of time needed to provide the desired taste.
10. Blend.
Distillers blend whiskies from various barrels to create the
final taste that matches the permanent recipe of the distiller.
Canadian whisky may also be flavored with up to 9.09 per-
cent of imported whisky or spirit, or a domestic spirit other
than whisky or wine. Caramel is often used for flavoring or
coloring.
11. Marry the blend.
No preacher needed here. The distiller puts the blended
whisky into a single barrel and lays it aside to mature for a
short period of time, permitting the whiskies to marry, or,
in other words, to blend.
12. Package the whisky.
Just pour the whisky into bottles, seal them, and slap on
the labels.
The distiller removes the final blend and sends it to the bottling room
where it’s packaged for shipment to retail outlets all over the world.
Bottled Canadian whisky may legally be labeled “Canadian Whisky,”
“Canadian Rye Whisky,” or “Rye Whisky.” The last two give a dis-
tinct indication of the prime flavoring grain.
Tasting the Best of Canada
You can find the complete rules that turn tasting into an unforget-
table experience in Chapter 3. Remember the importance of Rule
Number One — always have a good, moderate time — and keep
the results of the tasting where you can reference them easily to
refresh your memory or help you discover something different.
You can use the tasting sheet in Chapter 3 when you taste
Canadian whiskies.
Chapter 8: Channeling the Canadians 139

Selecting the whiskies for your tasting
Unlike some other types of spirits, such as cordials, Canadian
whiskies are a relatively small group. As of this writing, Canada has
200 licensed distillers; some are craft distillers — small distilleries
producing a limited amount of whisky a year, generally on less costly,
small pot stills, and often without enough funding to buy grains
and other items needed for production in the quantity that would
put them up there with the big boys.
Licensed craft distillers are continuously overseen by government
authorities to assure purity and quality according to the regula-
tions. So, if you find a distiller in the woods of a small town in
Saskatchewan, he may turn out some sensational whisky that’s
worth buying a bottle or two. But, his whisky may turn out to be 
a dud the second time around.
The majority of distillers are large enough to be members of the
Association of Canadian Distillers, in operation since 1947. The output
from its current members can be found all around the world, and
their quality is unquestioned by a huge number of steady customers.
Table 8-1 lists the members and their Web sites where available.
Finding a whisky with any of these names on the label assures you
that the whisky was made by the producer under all laws and
inspections.

Although it’s true that Canadian whiskies are the third-most-loved
whiskies globally, it’s also true that the number of brands available
worldwide is limited. In looking for bottles to sample, decide in
advance how you’ll usually serve Canadian whiskies.
This is a whisky designed to be light in order to give it greater ver-
satility in mixing. So, in this case at least, price does matter: The top
priced brands have the cleanest and truest flavor.
To help you decide which brands to taste, the following sections
list the leading brands arranged by price. I don’t give exact prices
because taxation varies from state to state, province to province,
and retail outlet to retail outlet. However, I do give you three gen-
eral price ranges, which I refer to as premium, popular, and value.
Premium priced brands
For the purest flavor, take the premium brands — often called top
shelf brands because they’re never put below eye level on store
shelves (“eye level is buy level”) or on back bars where they can’t
be seen (“a full value brand never goes in the well”). These whiskies
are the brands that you’ll want to sip slowly in front of a roaring
fire, dreaming of days seeking gold in the Yukon.
I list them in approximate price order based on a 750-ml bottle,
starting with the most expensive.
The following whiskies are priced between $25 (U.S. dollars) and
$50. Newer brands may be even higher.
 Crown Royal Special Reserve: As in any other whisky cate-
gory, a reserve is made of the finest whiskies put aside for just
this brand. Crown Royal was named, blended, and given its
unusual crown-shaped bottle in 1939 to honor the first-ever
visit of a king and queen to Canada.
 Tangle Ridge 10 Year Old: This is called a double-casked whisky,
because the whisky is first aged in casks for ten years and then
blended with other whiskies for additional aging before bottling.
 Crown Royal (age unknown): The original premium Canadian
whisky that comes in the purple sack (very useful for storing
golf tees or golf balls). It’s made from a blend of whiskies
including some that are 21 years old and older.
 Canadian Club Reserve 6 Year Old: The second most popu-
lar premium Canadian whisky. The added age above the mini-
mum three years certainly makes it worth a taste or two.

Popular priced brands
Are you having a party and want to have a couple of bottles of a
good Canadian on hand for mixing those fancy new cocktails? This
is the price range for multiple purchases. All have that wonderful
Canadian flavor, but they’re a little heavier so that the taste can cut
through the clear soda or dark cola with which you mix them.
The following whiskies are priced from about $15 to $45:
 Canadian Club 6 Year Old: Made from “ordinary” 6 year old
whiskies, and it’s a little less robust than the reserve.
 Seagram’s VO Gold 8 Year Old: For many years in the 1960s
and 1970s the original VO was the best-selling Canadian
whisky in the United States. This more recent version adds
more aging, so it has a heartier flavor.
 Seagram’s VO 3 Year Old minimum: Light, pleasant, and
smooth. What more could anyone want for making a magnifi-
cent Manhattan?
 Black Velvet Reserve 8 Year Old: Probably the best value
among all the whiskies in this category. In fact, it’s probably
too good to use for mixing and should be enjoyed as an 
aperitif with a little water and ice cubes.
 Canadian Mist 3 Year Old minimum: This blend of Canadian
whiskies is extremely popular in some parts of the United
States because of its mild unobtrusive flavor in cocktails.
 Rich and Rare 3 Year Old minimum: Another outstanding
mixing whisky that lives up to its name — it’s not rare, but
the flavor is.
 McNaughton 3 Year Old minimum: Another regional neigh-
borhood favorite.
 Black Velvet 3 Year Old minimum: If your favorite bar has
this “in the well,” you know the drinks are going to be better
than average.
Value priced brands
Some people who drop in aren’t your best friends, but you do have
to show hospitality, so you whip out a bottle of what the trade calls
“value priced” Canadian whisky and offer to mix them a drink.
These are the brands almost always found in bar wells directly
underneath the bar and are used primarily for mixing. They’re
good, pleasant tasting brands — but they’re not quite the best.
The following whiskies are priced from less than $10 to $12:

Savoring the flavor of 
Canadian whisky
No matter which brands you select for your tasting experience, all
Canadian whiskies share a general taste profile. Your first sip tells
you that these whiskies are
 Smooth: Unlike some whiskies, these have little alcohol “bite.”
 Even-flavored: Because of the blending of various grains, the
flavor is consistent and easy to recognize as Canadian.
 Slightly spicy: The aftertaste may be slightly spicy, depending
on the amount of rye used.
 Rye-flavored: The flavor of rye bread may come through if
enough rye is used in the distillation.
 Full of other flavors: These whiskies can be light or wintery,
and they’re often compared to Scotch due to the use of oats
and barley.

Never underestimate the inventiveness of Canadian distillers. In addition to offer-
ing the world rums and vodkas, they have also created a world-famed cordial, Yukon
Jack. This drink is made on a flavored 100-proof Canadian whisky base. You can
find it either in the Canadian whisky section or with other liqueurs.
Although this book deals primarily with spirits, it’s difficult to mention Canada’s 
contribution to the world’s alcohol beverage pantry without calling attention to
Canadian Ice Wines. These marvelous dessert wines have just recently been made
available throughout Europe, thanks to a change in European Union import regula-
tions. Ice wines are made mostly in West Coast wineries, primarily in Vancouver,
but also in newer wineries on the Niagara plateau bordering the U.S. along the St.
Lawrence River.
The other Canadians

Overall, Canadian whisky has no single overwhelming flavor, so it
mixes well and evenly with almost any kind of mixer, including with
a judicious use of tropical fruit juices. The sweetness of the rye in
Canadian whisky remains even when the whisky is mixed with sweet
diet colas. Canadian whisky isn’t even upstaged when mixed with
dry vermouth and angostura bitters in a Manhattan.
Pairing Foods with 
Canadian Whisky
Canada is a really BIG country with a land mass of 3,851,800 square
miles (9,012,112 square kilometers), making it the second largest
country in the world. The population was estimated in January
2007 at about 33 million people, ranking the country 37th among
the world’s populous nations.
But in talking about the number of people living in this giant of a
country, one is reminded of the famous line Spencer Tracy said
about Katherine Hepburn in one of their early films together, “Not
much meat on her, but what’s there is cherce.”
Canada is a multicultural country with a young population. Many
Canadians brought with them to their new homeland the culture
and cuisine of their original homelands. And they all seem to love
Canadian whisky — that fact almost alone proves how well the
whisky blends with virtually any style cuisine.
As you can see in Table 8-2, the foods Canadians serve with this
universal whisky vary by province from the colder Atlantic side to
the warm Pacific Coast and into the far north of the Arctic Circle.

Chapter 8: Channeling the Canadians 145
Being one of the two neighbors to the United States has always been a bone of
discontent with Canadians. After all, the northernmost parts of the continent were
visited and settled by Europeans long before the rest of the continent. That alone
would make Canadians happy — but it was not to last.
They had one stroke of good fortune: They beat the French, who were trying to take
the vast land for their king, and they forced them into an enclave in Quebec and
onto two islands off the Canadian coast that France still controls — Pierre and
Miquelon.
Then they took on the upstart English colony to the south that had declared itself
free. They even burned that nation’s capitol, but they couldn’t beat its navy and they
had to settle on the 49th Parallel as the boundary line between them.

W
hat could be simpler than gin? The plain distillate comes off
the still, and presto! The distiller adds his own secret recipe
of botanicals — that is, substances derived from plants — primarily
juniper berries, plus other herbs and spices to make a mild and
pleasant spirit.
What’s amazing is how many complex and delicious drinks have
evolved from this simple spirit. This chapter explains who, what,
when, where, and how.
The Origins of Gin
In the beginning — or beGINning — alcohol beverages, especially
distilled spirits, were regarded more highly as medicines than as
beverages.
As Chapter 1 explains, the Christian missionaries who introduced
distillation to Europe early in the 12th century were also medicine
men who used their distillates to relieve an entire catalogue of ail-
ments and illnesses. In doing so, the missionaries and monks may
not have cured their patients, but they certainly left them happier.
But the imbibers weren’t necessarily happy because the stuff tasted
good. Most of the missionary meds were based on local plants
ground up and boiled in a tea or soup, which left them tasting pretty
much like, well, plants ground up and boiled in tea or soup.

Eventually, someone got the idea of making the medicines taste
good by adding fruits and sweeteners and distilling them, leading
to the introduction of liqueurs (cordials). One such liqueur was
Benedictine, introduced around the turn of the 16th century by
Dom Bernardo Vincelli at the Benedictine Abbey of Fécamp in
Normandy. (For more on liqueurs, check out Chapter 14.)
A second result of this flavor revolution: Gin.
Hello, Holland; welcome, jenevre
By the end of the 14th century, the lowly juniper bush had already
become famous as a flavoring. At that time, farmers in “The
Lowlands” (modern Holland and Belgium) were practicing the 
new art of distilling grains, such as barley and oats, to produce
alcohol beverages.
Farmers in Italy in the 11th century started using berries of the
juniper to “soften” the harsh flavor of plain alcohol. In Germany,
the problem of harshness was addressed by adding whole berries,
crushed berries, or oil pressed from the berries to wine to make
what they called brentwine. Today we recognize brentwine as the
German word for what we now know as brandy (see Chapter 13).
Equally important, juniper was said to prevent or cure stomach
problems and, for some unknown reasons, to even cure bubonic
plague. That, probably more than its flavor, ensured its popularity.
Fast forward now to the mid-1600s. Franciscus de la Boie, also
known as Dr. Sylvius, of Leiden University in the Netherlands, had
already discovered that juniper berries were diuretics (chemicals
that increase urination). Then he found that adding the berries to
alcohol made the harsh grain alcohol taste better and the medicine
easier to take. He called his new beverage jenevre, the Dutch word
for juniper. So unlike most other spirit products, gin has a real, live,
well-known historical originator: Dr. Sylvius. He’s gin’s father.
Dutch merchants, knowing a good thing when they tasted it, aggres-
sively promoted their new spirit, even renaming it genievre (French
for juniper) to make it more attractive on the Continent.
Holland’s balm for British soldiers
The real impetus to spreading the fame of gin was a really long war.
In 1568, the House of Orange — Holland’s ruling family — went to
war to seek independence from Spain. The war expanded into a
Part III: Surfing the White Waters: A Guide to “Clear” Spirits 
150

series of battles between Holland, France, and Sweden on one side
and Spain and the Hapsburg Empire on the other. The conflict, last-
ing from 1618 to 1648 (later known as the 30 Years War), eventually
drew Britain into the fray when England sent troops to join the
Netherlands’ side of the fight.
To offset the damp, cold climate of The Lowlands, the British troops
drank a glass or two a day of Dr. Sylvius’ wonderful juniper potion,
which gave them “Dutch Courage.” The result was so effective that
not only did the Boys in the Red Coats feel fine about fighting
alongside the Hollanders; but they also carried bottles of jenevre
home with them, leading directly to yet another episode in the
spread of gin’s popularity.
The Brits Take Charge
Almost immediately on arrival in Britain, jenevre became terrifically
popular both as beverage and medicine. But that created problems
for British brewers and Scotch distillers who had a hard time keep-
ing up with the new product from the other side of the Channel.
Protecting the home teams
King William III of Britain wanted to protect the home teams from
the Dutch invasion. So, in 1689, he banned all imported spirits, thus
making it much easier for local British distillers to produce jenevre —
now known as gin. Coincidentally, this ban offered British farmers
the opportunity to profitably dispose of surplus grains.
However, the new law failed to impose good quality control on the
new distillers and their products. The law merely required the gin
distillers to post a notice and wait ten days before doing business.
As a result, the first British gins were very inferior — and very
cheap. Not surprisingly, the inexpensive gin soon outsold other
beverages, including beer. By 1730 more than 7,000 shops in
London were selling only spirits; one in four of these shops 
primarily sold gin.
Records of the period suggest that Londoners bought 5,000 gallons
of gin in 1690. That amount ballooned to 5 million gallons by 1720
when per capita (male) consumption of gin reached 14 gallons
annually.
Chapter 9: Getting the Goods on Gin 151

The increased gin consumption led to unpleasant civic behavior
and street scenes, such as the one pictured in William Hogarth’s
famous etching, “Gin Lane.” The etching shows a gin shop sign
reading, “Drunk for a Penny/Dead Drunk for Twopence/Clean 
Straw for Nothing.”
To bring the public drunkenness and proletarian debauchery to a
halt, Parliament passed the infamous Gin Act of 1736. The legislation,
which quintupled the price of gin and limited sale to two gallons at a
time, led almost immediately to “gin riots” that grew so violent that
the authorities conceded that the law couldn’t be enforced. It was
repealed in 1742.
Ultimately, this huge loss of market made British brewers very
unhappy and led directly to the Beerhouse Act of 1830. This act
was a Parliamentary attempt to stem the tide of gin sales and also
to protect the beer business. The act allowed people to sell beer
without a specific license, thus lowering costs so that brewers
could better compete with distillers.
Spreading the gin gospel
The invention of the continuous still in 1831 (see Chapter 2 for
details) made it possible to produce large amounts of spirits for a
growing market. As a result, the modern gin business started
making products used for a number of medicinal purposes (Gin
and Tonic to help beat malaria in Britain’s tropical commonwealth
countries) as well as for simple taste pleasure (the Martini, for
example, among other mixed drinks).
Much like the end of Prohibition in the United States, the repeal of
the Gin Act brought about changes in perception. The spirit was no
longer associated with degradation and abusive behavior by the
poor working class when it was being consumed as medicine and
for pleasure all over the world.
The gin makers and retailers responded to these changes by trans-
forming their often shabby taverns into more inviting cabarets that
offered music and entertainment. These cabarets were nicknamed
“Gin Palaces.” One such edifice was described by Charles Dickens
as “[T]he gay building with a fantastically ornamental parapet, the
illuminated clock, the plast glass window surrounded by stucco
rosettes, and its profusion of gas lights in the richly gilt burners, is
perfectly dazzling when contrasted with the darkness and dirt [of
the street] where we had just left.” These places attracted an
entirely new class of drinker and turned gin into a fully acceptable
drink in all walks of society.

Riding out the rougher years
In the United States, similarly extravagant evening dining and
drinking places flourished — until 1919 when the 18th Amendment
to the Constitution made the production and sale of alcohol bever-
ages for anything other than medicinal or religious purposes illegal
in America. Canada had announced Federal prohibition a few years
earlier. That left alcohol beverage sales in the hands of illegal dis-
tillers, smugglers, and retailers.
Many Americans did their drinking in illicit establishments called
gin mills or speakeasies where the price of entry was a password
(“Joe sent me”) whispered to the guy eyeballing prospective patrons
through a spy-hole in the door.
Others relied on an inexpensive spirit, hand-crafted, so to speak, 
in North America. “Bathtub gin” isn’t an idle phrase; it perfectly
describes the potion whipped up in washing tubs and, yes, bathtubs
all across North America. People poured plain alcohol, distilled
water, and suitable botanicals — or “flavor bricks” (compressed
flavoring agents designed to “make medicine more palatable”) —
into a container, stirred the pot, and poured out a clear liquid to
use as a mixer in cocktail making, more often than not for Martinis.
The 21st Amendment to the Constitution (passed in 1933) made
liquor legal, but between 1919 and 1933, gin and its various mixers
drew a large audience of men and flappers. This generation had
discovered the soothing effects of the Martini. Even then, it took a
while for gin to recover from its nasty Prohibition reputation. But,
recover it did. Soon the clear spirit became a symbol of wealth and
Chapter 9: Getting the Goods on Gin 153
Alexander the Great (gin guy)
London gin distiller Alexander Gordon took a major step forward in 1763 when he
decided to remove sugar from the mixture used to flavor the raw spirit. He then
added flavorings such as orange rind and coriander to create an entirely unique
and less potent form of jenevre. The result was an unsweet gin, which, in the same
sense as Champagne, was called dry.
Gordon’s innovation, formally labeled London dry gin, eventually found its way
across the Atlantic to the United States, where it was welcomed with open cock-
tail glasses, sorry, open arms. The dry formulation is by far the most popular type of
gin all over the world. The gin can still be called London dry gin even if it isn’t made
in London. And, yes, Gordon also named the gin after himself, and Gordon’s Gin is
still among the world’s leading gin entries up to the present day.

sophistication and an icon of upper-class American living. This
reputation was perpetuated in movies, such as The Thin Man; in
popular fiction by writers F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway;
and even in gag lines, such as Robert Benchley’s classic on enter-
ing a room after walking through a rainstorm: “I must slip out of
these wet clothes and into a Dry Martini.” (Check out the Martini
recipe in Chapter 15.)
Making Modern Gin
London dry gin and its sweeter Dutch cousin jenevre are clear spir-
its distilled from grains and flavored with juniper berries plus a
variety of botanicals (herbs, spices, and other plant products)
from all over the world.
 London dry gins are distilled from a mixture of 75 percent
corn and 25 percent barley and other grains.
 Holland gins (jenevre) are made from fermented malt (malt
wine) redistilled with juniper berries; the jenevre gins are
aged in oak barrels for three months, so they’re sometimes
classified as “Old Gin.”
 German gins (steinhäger), by law, must be made with a triple-
distilled, 45 percent alcohol by volume (ABV) spirit and must
contain juniper berries.
Protecting the secret
Gin distillers may use as many as 15 different botanicals to produce
the distinctive flavor of a specific gin. The exact recipe for any one
gin is the major difference between that product and its competi-
tors, so the formula is always a well-kept secret, passed down from
one generation to another and generally shared with no more than
five or six people in distillery management.
Although modern distillers may create new recipes for new gin
products, many modern gins are still proudly made with recipes
dating back at least 300 years.
In America, by law, no matter what other flavorings are in the mix,
to call itself gin, a spirit must include juniper, and be bottled at 
45 percent ABV. It doesn’t have to be aged.
Part III: Surfing the White Waters: A Guide to “Clear” Spirits 
154

Creating the flavor
Regardless of the particular mix of botanicals they select, gin dis-
tillers use one of four methods to arrive at the flavor and aroma
demanded by the original recipe.
The first three methods in the upcoming list are used for gins made
on continuous column stills. Method #4 is used by makers of the
original jenevre with some modification for what was, in the United
States, called “Old Tom.”
Stop! Are the words “continuous column still” new to your vocabu-
lary? Then stick a pencil between this page and the next page, and
turn back to Chapter 2, which explains distillation — and the differ-
ence in stills.
 Method #1 is the simplest way to match the recipe’s desired
taste profile for compounding the gin. (Compounding, in this
use, is distiller talk for putting the two elements together.)
The distiller crushes the botanicals fine enough to release their
aroma and flavor, and then tosses the crushed botanicals into
a vat filled with the amount of neutral spirit recommended to
create the brand’s desired flavor/aroma profile. He allows the
mixture to “marry” by letting it sit together for at least a week
before removing it to go directly to the bottling line. This method
has no need for added filtration or alcohol proof dilution.
 Method #2 involves crushing the botanicals, putting them in a
mesh bag, and immersing the bag in the alcohol. This immer-
sion allows the botanicals to steep the alcohol as if it were a
tea, transfusing flavors directly into the liquid. The gin is fil-
tered and diluted before bottling.
 Method #3 is used for more expensive brands. The distiller
crushes the botanicals and adds them to the fermented grain
mash before distillation. He then heats and stills the entire
package — flavorings and all.
 Method #4 was first used by original gin distillers. It’s an
expensive process used only by those making the very top-
level gins. First, the neutral spirits are diluted with distilled
water in a pot still that’s fired up. As the liquid heats and the
vapors rise, they pass through a special “Gin Head,” invented
in the late 1800s by distiller James Burrough (who gave the
world Beefeater Gin). The vapors pass through a basketlike
device filled with crushed botanicals, where the botanical fla-
vors and aromas are collected, condensed, diluted with distilled
water to 60 percent ABV, filtered, and then sent directly to the
bottling line with no further processing or filtering needed.

Touring the World of Gin
Unlike spirits named for their countries or locale — think Scotch,
Irish whiskey, and Bourbon from Bourbon County, Kentucky —
gins are truly universal.
Gins from Britain are generally more potent than those from the
United States, while gins from Holland and Germany are heavier-
bodied and even slightly malty.
What they all have in common is quality and versatility. The follow-
ing is an abbreviated tour of the world of gins.
British gins
The Brits didn’t invent the cocktail, but they developed some of
the most popular uses for gin. Likewise, they didn’t make the very
first gin, but they did refine the process so well that today they
make most of the best and best-selling gins around the world.
London dry gin
The world’s most popular gin type is rarely made in London (only
one distiller remains in the city) and is dry only in the sense that it
lacks sugar to make it sweet. London dry gins, produced on column
stills, tend to be high in alcohol — 90 proof (45 percent ABV) —
with a characteristic citrus flavor and aroma due to the widespread
addition of dried lemon and/or orange peels to the botanical recipe.
Some fine examples of London dry gins are detailed in the follow-
ing sections.
Bombay distilled London dry gin and Bombay Sapphire 
distilled London dry gin
Despite having Queen Victoria’s picture and funky lettering, the label
was designed to give Bombay a feeling of age and great respectabil-
ity — necessary because it’s a recent product that was created by
an American in the 1960s. None of this should detract from the fact
that Bombay is a very smooth gin that can only be described as non-
juniperish — possibly because the botanical flavorings are steamed
as they’re redistilled with the grain neutral spirits.
To its credit, even though it isn’t required to do so, Bombay has
always listed its main ingredients on the label. But don’t read the
label until you taste the gin — that way, you get to test your palate
as well as the spirit.
Part III: Surfing the White Waters: A Guide to “Clear” Spirits 
156

Bombay Sapphire, introduced in 1988 in its distinctive blue bottle,
is a bit spicier than the original, but both Bombays have good
body. (Not sure what body is? Bookmark this page and turn to
Chapter 3 where I define tasting terms.) Bombay Sapphire is the
best-selling premium gin globally.
Beefeater London distilled dry gin
Beefeater is, as of this writing, the only distiller left in London.
Founded in 1820 on the banks of the Thames by James Burrough,
the distillery has since moved to larger quarters in Kensington. It
was one of the earliest British gins to be imported to the United
States (starting in 1918).
In making Beefeater, the botanicals are diffused in the spirit for a
full 24 hours before redistilling the gin. The result is a highly per-
fumed product with a touch of citrus and a desirably long finish.
Tourist note: Although the label was recently modernized, the pic-
ture of the actual Beefeater guardsman from the Tower of London
is still prominent; in fact, Beefeater uses it in its ads as well. He’s
still carrying that monstrous long lance, too.
Tanqueray Special Dry English Gin and Tanqueray No. TEN
Both Tanqueray types are made in pot stills that exactly replicate
the original Tanqueray gin still. The still, which has a unique shape,
was developed in 1830 by Tanqueray when it first created the recipe.
Botanicals are added to the spirit just before distillation, which
means no steeping time; the result is a fresh but complex herbal
flavor that has made Tanqueray a worldwide brand and the
number-two leading imported gin in the United States.
The latest member of the Tanqueray family, Tanqueray No. TEN,
has been breaking records for introductory sales. It’s more expen-
sive, presumably because its botanicals cost more, and the bottle
is a modernized version of the original — but it’s still green. By the
way, the Tanqueray bottle is known in the trade as “the fire hydrant.”
On the other hand, the company says the original bottle is meant
to be a replica of a cocktail shaker.
Old Tom gin
Old Tom Gin dates back to the 18th century. It’s heavy-bodied, about
80 proof (40 percent ABV), and sweetened with simple syrup. It was
introduced to the United States only in the early 1950s. It’s said to
have been the spirit used to make the very first Martini (see Chapter
15 for the recipe). Today, only a few British distillers produce Old
Tom, and although they import it to the United States, it’s not easy
to find.
Chapter 9: Getting the Goods on Gin 157

Some new arrivals
Quintessential Gin, just recently introduced, is already generally
available throughout the U.S. It’s creating a stir, possibly because
among its botanicals are lotus and lavender, which give it a distinc-
tive flavor and aroma.
Hendricks, introduced to the world in 2004, is a super-premium
brand of gin made in Scotland. It includes cucumbers and rose
leaves among its list of more than ten botanicals.
Whitely and Neill is made by the heirs to a centuries-old British
distilling family. What makes their gin different is an unusual bottle
and the addition of botanicals from Africa, including baobab tree
fruit and cape gooseberries. This gin is 42 proof (21 percent ABV).
Plymouth gin
Unlike London dry gins, which don’t have to be made in London,
Plymouth gin must be made in Plymouth, a city in southwest
England that was once Britain’s leading seaport and the point of
departure for the Puritans headed to the New World.
The gin, first distilled there in 1793, is a highly aromatic, slightly
fruit-flavored, very dry, wheat-based spirit. It’s made with water
from Dartmouth’s granite hills and the addition of seven botani-
cals. It’s also 94 proof (47 percent ABV). A great favorite with Royal
Navy seamen, Plymouth gin became the worldwide favorite for Gin
and Tonics because its fruit flavors nicely balance the bitter taste
of the quinine-flavored tonic water.
Today, Plymouth gin is still made at the original distillery from the
original 18th-century recipe. It’s the seventh most popular gin in
the United States.
Hayman’s 1820 gin liqueur
Here’s something very different: a gin liqueur, made to appeal to
consumers who enjoy highly flavored gin. Hayman’s 1820 gin
liqueur is the first of its kind. The 80 proof (40 percent ABV) sweet-
ened grain gin is made in London by the family-owned Hayman
Distillers, who also make the century-old British favorite Pimm’s
Cup Liqueur. The “1820” refers to the year in which the family
introduced Beefeater. Some experts have compared its flavor with
Old Tom.

American gins
The United States, the world’s largest gin market, prefers dry gins,
most of it in cocktails. All American-made gins are London dry style
and all, including Gilbey’s and Gordon’s (which are made in the U.S.
under license from the British owners), are lower in alcohol than
British-made London dry gins. As a result, American London drys
are sometimes called “soft gins.”
Some good examples of American-produced gins are included in the
next section. All are the 80 proof (40 percent ABV) unless otherwise
noted.
Chapter 9: Getting the Goods on Gin 159
A drink for a penny
In his 1755 autobiography, British sea captain Bradley Bradstreet tells of his inven-
tion to circumvent requirements that drinkers purchase only two gallons of gin at a
time. (This requirement made gin so expensive that few working class people could
afford it.) In order to keep his customers from drinking too much gin, the good cap-
tain figured out a way to offer them gin for one penny per ounce.
He drilled two holes in the wall of his pub, leading to the street outside. On the out-
side of his establishment (the Black Cat), he painted an illustration of a black cat.
Over the topmost hole, he painted an illustration of the cat putting a tube in a hole
between its paws that led to the tavern inside. The customer would speak through
the top hole and then insert his one, two, or three pennies. The bartender inside
would pour the proper amount of gin into the customers’ container and place it in
front of the bottom hole.
Then, Captain Bradstreet tells of how he shopped for the best distiller in London.
He bought gin from that distiller, and when the gin was in place, Bradstreet says, “I
got a person to inform the mob that gin would be served by the cat at my window
next day, provided they put money in his mouth, from whence there was a hole that
conveyed it to me. At last I heard the chink of money and a comfortable voice say,
‘Puss, give me two pennyworth of gin.’” At that moment, the Captain knew he had
a success.
In fact, he reported that he made “upwards of two and twenty pounds” in one
month. He didn’t know it, but in addition to naming the gin “Old Tom” after his cat,
he also invented the world’s first beverage vending machine.

Barton gin
This traditional made-in-the-U.S.A. brand is a “value” spirit of good
quality. This good mixer is primarily available in the Midwest where
people whose parents — grandparents? great-grandparents? —
have known the Barton name since it appeared right after the Repeal
of Prohibition.
Burnett’s London dry
It may be hard to believe, but this gin in a square green bottle is
made in Kentucky by Heaven Hill, one of the world’s leading
Bourbon distillers. The Americans make it using the same English
recipe developed by Sir Robert Burnett in 1769. It’s distilled by a
system of vacuums that evaporate the alcohol at a lower tempera-
ture. The full-bodied gin has a fairly long finish with an overlay of
anise. This flavor makes it perfect for drinking with a lemon twist
or tonic water.
If the term “finish” is new to you, bookmark this page and flip to
Chapter 3. Then come right back for more on American gins.
Gilbey’s London dry
Gilbey’s (a well-known British brand) is made for the American
market in the U.S. under license to Beam Global Wine & Spirits. Its
outstanding characteristic is balanced flavor in a medium body
with a mineral finish.
Gordon’s London dry
Gordon’s, like Gilbey’s, is a British brand also made in the U.S. by
Beam for the American market. The gin, produced from a recipe
dating back to the 17th century, has more of an “imported” style.
Translation: It has a well-balanced flavor but is somewhat harsher
than most domestic brands. As a result, Gordon’s is often found in
the “well” (where you find the perfectly acceptable brands bar-
tenders use to make a drink when the customer doesn’t specify a
brand).
Seagram’s distilled dry gin
Seagram’s is the leading American-made gin, slightly more expensive
than other domestic gins but considered a great value for the price
by its fans. The slightly golden color that differentiates Seagram’s
from other gins is the result of about three months of aging in oak
casks. This aging is said to make the gin “softer,” but it also
reduces some of the juniper tang.

Holland gins
The original gin (jenevre) is still made primarily in Holland and
Belgium. It’s made mostly in pot stills from malted grains — barley,
rye, or corn in equal proportions — at a lower proof than English
and American gins. Holland gins are usually fuller bodied than other
types. “Oude” (old) jenevres are aged for at least a year in oak bar-
rels; “jong” (young) jenevres aren’t aged.
Zuidam Dry Gin and Damrak Genever Gin, two higher-priced gins
from Holland, made their first appearance in the U.S. in 2004.
Zuidam is more aromatic and herbal, made with nine botanicals.
Damrak, made in the traditional Dutch style, is slightly sweeter
with a malt (grain-like) undertone.
Gins from other countries
A handful of other countries are in the gin business. The following
sections outline those countries.
French gins
Citadelle is a super-premium gin that’s making quite a stir among
gin aficionados all over Europe and now in the U.S. Aside from a
very handsome package, its main claim to fame is that it’s a wheat-
based spirit.
Another new French entry is the sibling of the hugely successful
Grey Goose Vodka, called (what else?) Blue Goose. Naturally, it
comes in a blue bottle.
Chapter 9: Getting the Goods on Gin 161
A Dutch treat trick
Jenevre is a really “full” (viscous) liquid. Pour it slowly into a glass and it will rise
over the top without spilling. Having astonished watchers, true Holland gin fans bet
on their ability to do it, and then pick up the glass and drink it without breaking the
protective “bubble” or spilling a drop of the precious liquid.
Warning: As it says on those car commercials where professional drivers zip their
autos up and down walls without turning a hair, do not try this one at home.
Unless you’re really, really practiced. And have a napkin handy.

German gins (steinhäger)
German gin is a jenevre-style spirit, lighter in body and more deli-
cate in flavor than Holland and London dry gins. The best-known
(and oldest) brand is Schlichte Steinhager Dry Gin — 80 proof (40
percent ABV) — a grain-based, slightly sweet gin with no flavoring
other than juniper berries. Unfortunately, Schilchte — which is
bottled in a brown clay crock — is rarely available in the U.S. On
the other hand, Doornkaat, often called “schnapps” in Germany, is
available on the Internet. A reasonably priced way to impress visi-
tors from Germany.
Spanish gins
Spanish gin is dry and has a style similar to London dry. The best-
selling gin in Spain, Larios Dry Gin, is also the best selling gin in
Continental Europe. In Spain, it’s consumed mostly with cola.

Sloe gin is no gin
Somewhere back in a time when gin was young, an unknown distiller ran out of
juniper, couldn’t find it in the first place, or determined it too expensive. So he decided
instead to use sloe berries, the fruit of blackthorne shrubs, which were commonly
used as hedges in parts of England. He took the berries, cured them, and infused
them in his gin — virtually cost free. The distillate was between 15 and 39 percent
alcohol by volume, so he felt justified in calling it sloe gin. That was a mistake.
To start with, sloes aren’t berries at all; they’re related to plums. They lack that je ne
sais quoi taste of juniper, and, when crushed, their juice is red. It probably wasn’t
very long before his customers started to complain that his gin just didn’t taste very
ginny anymore and asked, “Whoever heard of a red gin anyway?”
Trying to make a purse out of a plum’s ear, he added some cherry juice as flavoring
and also to give the drink more color. That worked for a while, but soon the British
government stepped in. They pronounced that henceforth all gin would be made
with juniper berries — the real ones.
That should have been the end of that, but in the time between introducing it and
being told to stop, the unknown distiller had built a following for sloe gin. So, he was
permitted to call it just that.
It entered the lexicon — and bartender mixing guides — and can still be found in
some establishments where it’s a liqueur used primarily as a flavoring for mixed
drinks that may or may not be made with gin.
So, go slow when you ask for sloe gin — you might get it.

Speak Spanish? Read more about Larios and the distinguished
family that made it famous at larios.com. Finding the gin itself is
more difficult. Although Larios is sold in 40 countries around the
world, and imported to the U.S. by Pernod Ricard, it isn’t widely
available on this side of the Atlantic.

What to look for when tasting gin
When you’re ready to taste gin, pour about an ounce of it into your
tasting glass. Then look at the gin. With rare exceptions, the liquid
should be crystal clear. (Those exceptions include Seagram’s, which
is slightly golden because it’s slightly aged, and any gin with an
added botanical that may affect the clarity.) The body, or viscosity,
is fairly uniform. An exception is the heavily viscous Holland jenevre.
Other than that, as the man says, when you’ve seen one, you’ve
pretty much seen ‘em all.

What to sniff and sip
The pleasure of gin is, in no small measure, derived from its intrigu-
ing aroma. Juniper is the primary botanical in gin, so when you’re
sampling gins, juniper should be the first thing you smell. And, of
course, the first thing you taste.
Which brings up an interesting question: How many people know
exactly what juniper smells like or tastes like? Not many. So the first
step in tasting gin may be to put down this book; go down to the
supermarket or health food store; pick up a packet, jar, or what-
ever of juniper; bring it home; and smell and taste it. It can always
be brewed as a tea. Who knew?
But juniper’s just the tip of the flavor and aroma iceberg. Table 9-4
lists some of the important flavoring agents used in making gin. In
addition, some distillers may include aloe, fennel, hyssop, oregano,
rosemary, star anise, turmeric, and any one of more than a thousand
different botanicals. Exactly which botanicals go into which gin
and in exactly what proportions is a secret.
Most, but not all, of the ingredients listed in Table 9-4 are familiar.
You probably know what orange peels smell and taste like. If you
see something on this list that you haven’t experienced, taste or
smell it before you start. 
Table 9-4
Flavoring Agents Found in Gins
Botanical
Description
Juniper 
These are the berries of an evergreen shrub. 
(Juniperus communis)
They’re the primary flavoring agent in gin 
and, by law, must be included in any product
labeled “gin.” Also used to flavor pork, sauer-
kraut, and root beer, and as a marinade.
Medical effect: A mild diuretic. The oil of the
juniper may relieve some types of gastric upset
stomach.
Angelica root 
This is the root of a plant belonging to the carrot 
(Angelica archangelica)
family. It’s also known as archangel, European
angelica, or dong quai. Its licorice flavored
seeds and stalks are also used in cordials.
Stems may be candied and used as garnish.
Native to North America.

Table 9-4 (continued)
Botanical
Description
Anise 
This annual plant is a member of the carrot 
(Pimpinella anisum)
family. The seeds have a slight licorice flavor
and aroma; used to flavor anisette and ouzo as
well as gin. Native to India, the Middle East, and
Southern Europe; cultivated in the United States.
Medical effects: Used to flavor cough syrups
and dentifrices; may relive some gastric upset
and respiratory congestion. 
Cardamom 
Whole and powdered seeds and seed pods. 
(Elettaria cardamom)
Cardamom has a flavor ranging from mild to
intense, and it’s used in curries. 
Cinnamon 
These are the powdered or rolled sticks of the 
(Cinnamomum verum)
dried inner bark of a tropical evergreen tree. It’s
called “true cinnamon” to distinguish it from
cassia, a similar spice with which true cinnamon
may be blended. Native to Sri Lanka, Sumatra,
and Borneo.
Coriander 
The leaves (cilantro) and seeds (coriander) of 
(Coriandrum sativum)
this plant are both used to flavor gin, as well as
sausages and chewing gum. Native to Morocco,
Rumania, and the Czech Republic. Medical
effects: Oil is a possible allergic sensitizer (a
substance that increases sensitivity to other
substances).
Orange peel 
This is the grated fresh rind of the sweet orange, 
(Citrus sinensis)
also known as orange zest. Native to China and
Northern India. Cultivated in the United States,
West Indies, and Israel.

Natural or artificial?
Artificially flavored gins, such as the newer fruit flavored versions, were designed
to keep up with vodka in the mixed drink derby. Tasting them can be, well, tasty, but
what you’re really tasting isn’t gin. It’s the essential oils or essences of the featured
flavor, such as strawberry. Nothing wrong with that, of course. In fact, flavored gins
can be a real timesaver at a party. However, when it comes to true tasting, stick to
the main event. The gin, the whole gin, and nothing but the gin. Cheers!

Serving Gin
Obviously, to get the true flavor of a gin, you must taste it neat —
that is, unadorned. But gin is so rarely served straight that it may
make more sense to serve it in a cocktail.
Right. And wrong.
In fact, some gins are tasty on their own. Others work better as
mixers. As a general, but definitely not a definitive guide, Table 9-5
suggests which gin to serve which way. If you decide to go with
cocktails, check out Bartending For Dummies, 3rd Edition, by Ray
Foley (Wiley).
Table 9-5
How to Serve Your Gin
Gin Type
Serving Tip
American London Dry
Serve it in cocktails. What cocktails? Martinis.
German
Serve it chilled and straight.
Holland
Serve it chilled and neat with a Dutch favorite fast
food snack — green herring.
English London Dry
Serve it with tonic water, as in a Gin and Tonic, or
with Italian Vermouth, as in a Gin and It, which 
could be considered an English Martini.
Old Tom
Serve it neat, as a rarity, just to experience the 
flavor of gins past.
Plymouth
Serve it chilled, in fruit flavored cocktails.
Spanish
Serve it in cocktails with cola.
A Martini made with vodka rather than gin is correctly a
“Vodkatini.” (See Chapter 10 for the scoop on vodka.)
However you serve it, “To your health!”

Vodka: Toasting the Russians
In This Chapter
 Identifying vodka’s origins
 Describing vodka’s unique characteristics
 Considering vodka’s flavors
 Comparing vodka with its siblings from different countries
T
his chapter describes the super-fast rise of vodka and its
European cousins (including Scandinavia’s aquavit) from their
humble origins as the oldest European distilled spirit to block-
buster status as the (current) most popular spirit in the world.
And, of course, I explain how to enjoy the drink. In moderation.
What Is Vodka, Anyway?
Early on in vodka’s history (as with all spirits), no local government
or global administration set standards defining alcohol beverages.
You call it vodka, I call it wodka — who’s to say who’s right?
Today, however, every country that produces a vodka agrees: Vodka
is diluted ethyl alcohol, the clear liquid produced when any plant
food (grains, fruits, potatoes) is distilled. And of course, ethyl alcohol
is the only alcohol used in alcohol beverages.
Do you need a refresher or a first run-through the distillation
process? Stick a pencil in this page, turn to Chapter 2, and then
come back when you’re done reading about the process in detail.
In Continental Europe, distillers and their governments are happy
with the definition of vodka. But in Eastern Europe, not so much.
Over there, the folks want to define vodka as a spirit distilled only
from grains or potatoes — not sugar cane, grapes, or other non-
traditional agricultural products.

Sooner or later, they’ll all agree. Meanwhile, you can consider a
brief history of the clear spirit.
The Birth of a “Breathless” Spirit
Who gets credit for vodka? Was it the Russians who first drank the
“breathless” spirit? Or did the “dear little water” first speak Polish?
Don’t forget the Scandinavians, specifically the Danes, and yes, the
Germans.
Each claims to have been first out of the gate with vodka, and lest
you think this is a passing quarrel, you should know that the argu-
ment has been raging since the 15th century.
Actually, no one knows for sure where vodka first saw the light of
day, but everyone knows the story of its name.
The name vodka comes from the Russian phrase zhizennia voda,
most commonly translated as “water of life,” or (in the shortened
form) voda, meaning “dear little water.” Either way, the Slavs clearly
recognized that they had something special with vodka (wodka to
the Poles). But they’re not absolutely certain about when it was
first produced.
Local histories suggest the first vodka was consumed during the
12th century or maybe the 14th century or — an outside guess —
the 16th century. One reason why nobody can pin down the date is
that nobody is actually sure what the original vodka was.
The monks move north
As you can read in Chapter 1, the original Johnny Appleseeds of
the spirits crowd came from the monasteries of Spain and Portugal.
There, Moorish alchemists — having failed to convert base metals,
such as lead, into gold — invented distilling, thus settling for con-
verting grains, fruits, herbs, and seeds into medicinal (and highly
potable) alcohol beverages.
The monks called their clear spirit aqua vitae, water of life. The
Scandinavians translated that to akavit. The Western Europeans
called it eau de vie. And the Eastern Europeans translated it as
vodka (or, in Poland, wodka). Whatever you call it, historians sug-
gest that an Ecumenical Council in Rome in 1430 decided that
using alcohol (rather than the often rancid local waters) to make
medicines palatable was a really good idea.

The Russians stake a claim
The Russians say vodka was first distilled at an abbey and/or fort
named Viatka in the 12th century. Unfortunately, many documents
dealing with the initial distillation of vodka were destroyed when
the Russian Orthodox Church labeled it a “tool of Satan” and
destroyed all documents detailing how to make the demon spirit.
That was the first time — but certainly not the last — that vodka
became part of a serious political debate. Peter the Great
(1672–1725) saw how popular vodka had become, so sometime 
in the 1700s, he decided to give all rights for making, selling, and
keeping the profits for that work to the royal family. That took it 
all away from the traditional owners, the Russian Orthodox Church.
Naturally, now that Satan was now out of the picture, the Church
administration objected and asked Peter to return some control
over the distillation and distribution of this marvelous medicine.
Peter had seen the possibility of getting great revenues from con-
trolling the manufacture and sale of vodka, so he turned down
their requests. The control rested with the czars until the state
took over after the 1917 revolution.
In 1936, while distillation remained a state-controlled product, the
ban against higher proof beverages meant the return of legal vodka.
After the overthrow of Communism, the state maintains an interest
in some of the distilleries. Almost all are located in Moscow, but
most of them are privately owned either by Russian national com-
panies or by French- and English-based global companies such as
Pernod Ricard and Diageo.
Huzzah for Ivan IV, the
not-so-terrible czar
The next time you sit at a table in a swank restaurant, sipping
Cosmopolitan, lift your glass to the man who came up with the
idea of having a social drink with friends in a friendly place away
from home: Ivan the Terrible (1530–1584), the first czar of the Rus,
which was made up of all the Russian tribes.
Nasty though Ivan may have been, he knew how to keep the oprich-
niny, his palace guards and secret police, happy.
Ivan IV’s predecessor, Ivan III, didn’t appreciate the fact that alcohol
consumption among the peasants was interfering with their work,
which was to keep the economy moving and his coffers full. So he
banned all drinking except during religious holidays.
Chapter 10: Vodka: Toasting the Russians 171

Ivan IV, who didn’t care much about the peasants but had a better
grasp of labor relations at home, rewarded his guards with a drink
when they were stressed — possibly from knocking those pesky
peasants about — and even established a place for them to go on
Christmas and Easter to drink all they wanted.
The places, called kabaks (translation: taverns) sold nothing 
but vodka. Not surprisingly, soon there were kabaks everywhere
throughout the land. The guards were happy, the people were
happy, the distillers and tavern owners were happy. And best of all,
Ivan was happy because the taverns soon became a steady source
of income as well as a place to socialize and relieve the tensions of
living in difficult surroundings.
Regulations, regulations, and more
If Ivan codified public drinking, Peter the Great (all 6 foot 8 inches
of him — constituting probably one of the world’s champion
drinkers) was the one who established a system of licensing pro-
duction and sales of spirits. He established this system near the
start of his reign, which lasted from 1682–1725.
Peter’s grand idea was to permit spirits to be produced by state-
owned distilleries for the benefit of the general populace (and
Peter) and by individual land owners for their personal use.
That system held until 1765. Catherine the Great, whose appetite
was for things of the flesh rather than the vodka bottle, made distill-
ing vodka illegal for anyone other than members of the aristocracy.
That situation continued for a while, but was eventually relaxed. By
the early 19th century, regulations had been put into place, setting
the standards for making vodka. Now the illegality was making a spirit
in a manner that wasn’t established by the state and calling it vodka.
Vodka Takes a Long Voyage
In the United States, until just after World War II, vodka was rarely
served outside of neighborhoods with a large Russo/Polish 
population.
But the War had taken millions of young Americans overseas, intro-
ducing them to new foods and drinks. Now, with the growth of
commercial air travel, ordinary folks could hop a plane to Europe,
visit the Old Country, and taste new pleasures, including vodka.

172

And then somebody mentioned the name Smirnoff.
“Why would people pay 
money for this stuff?”
Historians of distilled spirits are a tad wobbly on the exact date,
but one fine day sometime in the 1860s, a Russian distiller named
Piotr Smirnov set out to create the world’s finest vodka. His secret?
He was the first person in the whole wide world to filter his vodka
through charcoal, thus producing a spirit so well regarded that the
Smirnov distillery was soon named the official purveyor to the
Russian court.
Fast forward to 1917. Revolution. Confiscation. Vladmir Smirnov
(grandson of Piotr) was imprisoned and sentenced to death. But Our
Hero, ever resourceful, escaped to Constantinople, moved to Poland,
changed his name to Smirnoff, and — with success at hand — opened
a second distillery in Paris.
Then came The Great Depression. Facing economic disaster,
Smirnoff sold his company to Rudolph Kunett, another Russian
émigré. Kunett, even more resourceful than the Smirnovs, saw an
Chapter 10: Vodka: Toasting the Russians 173
Aquavit: The Scandinavian alternative
Aquavit (or akavit or akevit, depending on where in Scandinavia you’re drinking it)
is a clear spirit like vodka, but its character is different.
The Swedes, who were the first to produce the new spirit, didn’t like a flavorless
drink, so they tossed in some herbs and spices. The most popular turned out to be
caraway — yes, the same ingredient you find in rye bread.
And while other Europeans were distilling their clear spirits from grapes, the
Swedes — who lived too far north to grow the fruit — learned to make theirs from
hardier and less expensive grains.
That was sometimes problematic. From time to time, Scandinavian winters were so
cold that even the grain crops failed, and production of aquavit was banned. Luckily,
in 1763, after the potato had been introduced to Europe from the New World, a smart
Norwegian distiller promoted potatoes as a substitute for grains in making the spirit.
Perfection! The potato thrived in the northern climate. It was less expensive than
grain to grow and distill. So, since then, all aquavit has been made from a potato
base. Flavored with caraway, of course.

untapped market in the United States. So, posthaste, he moved
across the ocean to begin the search for an American distiller to
make and distribute his vodka.
Kunett’s first call was to Samuel Bronfman, founder and head of
Seagram’s Ltd., then the world’s best-selling distiller. But “Mr. Sam,”
as he was known to friend and foe alike, had a quick answer: “Why
should anyone pay good money for this liquor with no color,
aroma, and taste?”
Bronfman suggested that Kunnet go up the East Coast to Connecticut
and call on Heublein, Inc., a major importer of foods and bever-
ages. Heublein executive John Martin made a recommendation to
the company: buy the Smirnoff vodka recipe, trademarks, and
rights to sell everywhere in the world.
And thus was history made, one fortune won, and another lost.
With a kick like a Moscow mule
World War II halted most production of alcohol for beverage use,
but John Martin over at Heublein insisted that this Russian spirit
could find a place on America’s store shelves and back bars.
In due course, Martin visited his friend Jack Morgan, owner of 
Los Angeles’ Cock ’n’ Bull restaurant. In the course of a lunch,
Martin said that he didn’t know what to do with this new vodka.
Morgan said that he understood because his restaurant was 
overflowing with a surplus of ginger beer.
Just as in a cartoon, a light bulb lit up over their heads: They
decided to make a mixed drink from the two beverages, adding a
dash of lime for an extra touch of tartness.
The pair invited Heublein’s Los Angeles distributor to suggest a
name and serving style. At the time, the famous Young’s Market in
Los Angeles had a surplus of copper mugs. Vernon Young’s sugges-
tion was to create a drink to be served in the copper mugs that
could then be presented as souvenirs. So the mugs were engraved
with an illustration of a kicking mule and the drink name: the Moscow
Mule. The gifts were a big hit with Hollywood celebrities who visited
the Cock ’n’ Bull often and allowed the eatery to inscribe their names
on mugs and hang the endorsed mugs on a wall.
Once again, it was light bulb time. The success of the Moscow
Mule encouraged Heublein to promote its vodka and Smirnoff.
Heublein hired an advertising agency that came up with a simple

explanation of why Smirnoff should be on every drinking person’s
menu (especially drinking persons expected to return to the office
after lunch): “It leaves you breathless.”

Yesterday, the Cold War; 
today, the world
Every so often, while East and West were staring at each other over
the walls of the Cold War, Stolichnaya — the first Russian vodka to
be imported to Western Europe and the United States — became
the object of noisy, messy boycotts.
But it’s an ill wind that blows nobody any good, and newspaper
and television pictures of bartenders pouring Stoli down a sewer
opened the U.S. markets to vodkas from other countries, especially
those in Western Europe.
First the Swedes arrived with Absolut. Then the Finns delivered
Finlandia. And after that? A flood of vodka filled the nation’s drink-
ing glasses. Here’s some evidence:
 In 1935, when the first Old Mr. Boston, a classic drink recipe
book, was published, it contained not a single recipe made
with vodka. When the “Platinum Edition” came out in 2006,
there were 123.
 In 2005, 25 percent of all spirits sold in the United States were
vodka; more than 2.5 million cases of ultra-premium vodkas
were sold that year.
 In January 2007, New York state retail stores and bars had a
choice among 132 imported vodkas (from countries as far
apart as Iceland and Lithuania), and 163 domestic brands to
offer for sale.
And, boy, did those brands bring in the big bucks. In 2004, Bacardi
paid an enormous sum estimated to be around $2 billion to buy
Grey Goose, made in France, then the world’s best-selling vodka.
Just a single brand, not the entire company behind it.
Today, the world is awash in vodka. Spasibo, once again, Piotr.
Chapter 10: Vodka: Toasting the Russians 175

Distilling Vodka
Here’s today’s standard global definition of vodka: A neutral spirit
distilled from any material at or above 190 proof (95 percent alcohol
by volume, or ABV), if bottled at no less than 80 proof (40 percent
ABV). Filtered after distillation with charcoal or other material so
as to be without distinctive character, aroma, taste, or color.
The distinctive characteristic of vodka is that it not have any dis-
tinctive character. Go figure.
The basic steps for producing distilled spirits are spelled out in
detail in Chapter 2. What you read here is how to make vodka —
and how to make one vodka different from another while still
adhering to the definition of a product “without distinctive 
character, aroma, taste, or color.”
The drawback of that tasteless, aromaless, and colorless attribute
is the importance of brand differentiation. Making a new vodka
brand different from the thousands of other flavorless, aromaless,
and colorless vodkas available from all over the world brings with
it a new set of challenges for the vodka distiller.

176
The Japanese “vodka”
Shochu is a Japanese clear spirit distilled from a number of plant products, includ-
ing sweet potatoes (imo-jochu), rice, buckwheat (soba), barley, and other similar
so-called “small grains” such as oats, and even brown sugar and chestnuts.
Each plant food lends a specific flavor to the finished product, so shochu from one
area doesn’t taste entirely like that of another. The flavor depends on the climate
and type of agricultural product used.
The Japanese use two methods of distillation for this spirit. The oldest, in use since
the 14th century, most likely came to Japan from China. In this process, the mash is
distilled only one time and uses only one ingredient. This is called Otsu-rui or
Honkaku — “the real thing.”
The second type of distillation, legal only since 1949, is called Kou-rui. This process
requires multiple distillations of several ingredients, including the choice of differ-
ent types of sugars used to speed fermentation.
Shochu is also made in Korea (Soju), Okinawa (Awamori), and Southeast Asia.
Interestingly, despite the global popularity of vodka as vodka, more shochu than
vodka is sold throughout Asia, which earns it the title “world’s best-selling spirit.”

This challenge also flings wide the doors to a sacred temple.
Gaining entrepreneurial admittance to that temple is supposedly
reserved for those with the huge amounts of investment money
that are necessary for equipment. That challenge has brought
about new and often better variations of an old theme without
sacrificing the traditions of the old.
First comes the mash
The almost indiscernible differences between vodkas become more
obvious as you taste and evaluate them more carefully. Those differ-
ences begin with the choice of a recipe for the mash to be fermented.
Despite popular belief, not all vodkas are made from potatoes.
Even the ones that are made from that tuber may vary the type 
of potatoes used. The flavor and texture of an Idaho-grown baking
potato is vastly different from a Southern France-grown russet, just
as organically grown grain is different from ordinary grain.
Grains are used more than any other material in vodka distillation,
and this is where differentiation is first revealed. Distillers of vodka
use grains of all kind, primarily corn, wheat, and rye. They also use
touches of “small grains” — such as barley, oats, and rice — along
with other agricultural products, such as sweet potatoes, white
potatoes, sugar cane, molasses, and even fruits.
Next comes fermentation
Ingredients for vodka, just as those for any other spirit, must be
heated with water to speed up the fermentation to come. For that
purpose, distillers need either or both cultures and “wild” yeasts.
To speed the process even further and add another element of
flavor to the mash, distillers can use brick-shaped bars of white 
or brown sugar or a combination of both.
Don’t forget the water
Although going far away to find pure water to use in fermentation
isn’t necessary, some distillers have done just that to give their
particular vodka greater differentiation from others.
One brags that icebergs are towed to his distillery and melted
there for water that has been untouched for centuries. Another
uses melted water from a 12,000-year-old glacier. The ultimate is
Chapter 10: Vodka: Toasting the Russians 177

Icelandic vodka distilled in Scotland, and then shipped over water
to Iceland where glacial water is added to the clear vodka spirit in
order to lower the alcohol level before bottling.
Into the still
Vodka is usually made on column (continuous) stills. But the more
premium-priced the brand is, the more likely it is to have at least
one pot still involved, if for no other reason than for the sake of 
tradition.
No matter which method is used, in order to remove all the con-
geners (flavoring agents), the fermented mash must be heated. The
heat boils the liquid out of the mash and then turns the vapors
back into liquid.
In most cases, three distillations will do the desired work. Some
producers may make a “cleaner” product by using as many as six
distillations. But because no spirit is ever 100 percent free of flavor
(maybe 99 percent can be achieved), the number of distillations is
a choice that depends on which congeners the distiller wants to
leave in, and how often the alcohol must be distilled to remove all
the others.
Although it isn’t necessary, it sounds sexy to tell consumers that this
vodka has been distilled six times (unlike most of the competition).
Or that it uses the purest water in the world to make certain it has
no unwanted flavors. Alternatively, you may hear that the additive
used, such as glycerin or sweeteners, gives it enough taste to make
your cocktails brighter, newer, and more colorful (or tasteful).
And then into the bottle
Another way to create differentiation among vodkas is in packaging.
When Absolut was first introduced, competitors derisively called it
the “medicine bottle.” When it became the leading imported vodka,
they all rushed around finding designers to create new bottles (even
architect Frank Gehry designed the latest bottle for Wyborowa).
In 1992, Maurice Kanber, who had no experience in distilling but
had written a book titled Secrets From an Inventors Notebook, said
that he wanted to create a domestic U.S.-made vodka. And so he
did. He called attention to it by distilling it four times and filtering
it three times. Then he put it into a cobalt blue bottle. Skyy Vodka
got noticed, took off immediately, and is still going.

The Second Vodka Revolution: 
The Flavor Factor
As early as the 15th century, the vodka-drinking population of
Northern Europe recognized the need for some flavor in their
drinks — if for no other reason than to be able to tell a wodka from
an akavit. Therefore, they were the first to add flavor at the distillery.
To their clear, tasteless Zubrowka, the Poles added eight blades of
“Bison grass,” so named because the wild Bison of the time once
grazed on it in open fields. Russian distillers regularly added sweet
syrup to vodka for women to drink because, so the story goes,
women didn’t like their spirits unless they were sweet.
Fast forward to the 20th century when food technologists found
ways to make artificial flavors that sometimes tasted even better
than natural flavors. Borrowing the 400-year-old system of flavor-
ing their beloved vodka to hide some of the inconsistencies of taste,
they added lemon flavoring to Stolichnaya Límon. From then on, it
was off to the races as far as the Western world was concerned.
Not only did distillers use some of the traditional Russian flavor-
ings, but they also added many new ones. Traditional examples
include Pertsovka, black pepper and chili flavor; Limonaya, lemon
Chapter 10: Vodka: Toasting the Russians 179
How do consumers choose a vodka?
The goal of distilling vodka, as I say throughout this chapter, is to make it as flavor-
less as possible. With every brand trying to achieve this same goal, you have to
wonder how consumers latch onto one particular brand or another. What is the per-
ceived value of one vodka over another? The answer is clearly that value is in the
eye of every single beholder. Vodka enthusiasts seem to enjoy being experimental.
The distillers understand this enjoyment and are always trying to come up with new
and exciting vodkas to try, which contributes to the “Flavor Revolution” (discussed
in an upcoming section) that began in the U.S. and is now global.
Add to this mix packaging, advertising, and promotion. Because premium and ultra-
premium vodkas are highly profitable, a lot of money is available for all those exter-
nals. Believe it or not, developing all those beautiful bottles and the extra packaging
to protect them costs into the thousands of dollars. (Frank Gehry’s great talent doesn’t
come cheap.) Then the bottles have to be put on display in the most magnificent
way so that potential buyers can look on them with great favor. Marketing folks call
this perceived value, the extra value consumers get from the satisfaction of having
a beautiful or unusual bottle to call attention to their taste in the products they own.

with some sugar added; and Kubanskaya, dried lemon and orange
peels. The new flavors also include all kinds of berries and mixes of
berry flavors, citrus fruits, spices, and even chocolate. All thanks to
the wonders of science or nature. Whenever and however flavored,
the bottle label must say so and tell you how they were captured
for use in the spirit.
Seeing the success of flavored vodkas, now a major element in that
spirit’s highly successful growth, distillers of other spirits began to
brighten up their traditional unflavored products with flavors. Thus,
you can find Bacardi Límon, which began a revolution in rum, a
spirit type that would appear not to need additional flavoring. In
addition, distillers added berry flavorings to Alizè Cognac, where
tradition said that the brandy alone — not berries — was the taste
that people liked.
Although the purists may blanch at seeing something as bizarre as
a green appletini made with vodka, the younger generation loves it —
the more highly flavored, the better. And, as the revolution that
began in the U.S. caught fire, the rest of the world followed, adding
not only flavor, but also aroma (it doesn’t leave you breathless any-
more) and color (a white melon vodka would look odd to anyone,
young or old). The revolutionaries won in a walk.

Do-it-yourself flavored vodka
In the 1960s, Finlandia came up with an idea to help bolster its slipping sales: Give
bartenders a way to create flavored vodka right there on their bar. The Finlandians
provided an appropriately labeled five-gallon jug with a spigot and instructions on
how to create flavored vodkas.
It was a moderate success and once again brought Finlandia to the attention of those
bored with Absolut, which came out with its own flavored versions shortly afterward.
Today, some people want to create their own flavored vodka to make certain that
the flavors are real and come from organically grown sources and also to control
the amount of flavoring their vodka drinks have. Here’s a safe and sane way to do it
yourself. First check with local regulations on how much you can make without
paying taxes.
STRAWBERRY VODKA INFUSION
Purchase two one-liter glass Mason jars with airtight covers. It helps if one has a
spigot. Then follow these steps:
1. Get a 750 ml bottle of your favorite unflavored vodka and four pints of fresh straw-
berries. Best types: California and Alpine.

Tasting Vodkas
Chapter 3 provides basic information on how to set up a spirits
tasting. This section applies the rules to vodka.
Creating the tasting sheet
First, make a tasting sheet on which to note your personal evalua-
tion of every vodka you sample. Table 10-1 gives you a sample tast-
ing sheet that you can copy or adapt to your preferences.

2. Wash everything you’re using — from the berries to the Mason jar — so that it’s
all clean and free of any disinfectant.
3. Remove the green leafy hull and cut the berries in half using a sharp paring knife.
4. Add the berries and the vodka to one of the glass jars and allow them to infuse
for a few days in a cool, dark place.
5. To get the most out of the strawberries, line a strainer with layers of cheesecloth
and decant the initial mixture from one Mason jar into the second. Use a plastic
spoon to press every bit of juice from the berries through the cheesecloth into
the second jar. Make sure you add the entire mixture from the first bottle.
6. Let the mixture rest in its new home for a few hours. Sample it. If needed,
sweeten with simple syrup — 1 cup of refined sugar plus 1⁄2 cup of water; boil
them together until syrupy. Add to the jar when finished.

rials, and how-to information, click on www.infused-vodka.com.

Classifying vodkas
One practical way to simplify the long, long, really long list of vodkas
available is to group them into easy-to-handle categories. For
example, as an adventurous and discriminating drinker, you can
classify vodka by
 Price levels
 Country of origin
 Food from which the vodka was distilled
 Flavorings
You may choose to sample several vodkas from one category or
one vodka from each of several categories. But real experts testify
that the differences between vodkas are generally so subtle that it
makes tasting sense to compare like products — that is, all unfla-
vored vodkas or all flavored vodkas from, say, Sweden or among
those costing more than $20 a bottle.
Choosing vodkas by price
Is price the best guide to vodka quality? Yes. No. And, maybe. Some
expensive vodkas are excellent, but so are some lower-priced
brands. For example, in January 2005, a team of experts assembled
by The New York Times sampled ten different 80 proof (40 percent
ABV) vodkas, from various countries, made from various foods
(in other words, grains versus potatoes). And the winner was —
drumroll, please! — Smirnoff, made in the U.S., and the least 
expensive of the lot.
You can set up your own price-based tasting to see whether you
agree with the Times’ panel of men and women. Choose from a
range that includes the following:

182
Aquavits: A simple choice
There are dozens of vodkas but very few aquavits, which makes choosing the ones
to sample as easy as, well, one, two, three. The leading brands available practically
everywhere are the Danes’ Aalborg Akavit, the Swedes’ obvious Absolut and O.P.
Anderson, the Norwegians’ Linie, and the Finns Finlandia. If only all life’s choices
were that simple.

 Ultra-premium vodkas: These brands are priced higher than
$40 per 750 ml bottle. Examples of ultra-premium vodka
brands are:
• Belvedere
• Danaka
• Grey Goose
• Ketel One
• Tanqueray Sterling
 Premium vodkas: These brands are priced between $25 and
$40 per bottle. Examples of premium vodka brands are:
• Absolut
• Boru
• Fris
• Hangar One
• Level
• Three Olives
• Wyborowa Estate
 Popular priced vodka: These brands are priced between $15
and $25 per bottle. Examples of popular priced vodkas are:
• Effen
• Finlandia
• Seagram’s Extra Smooth
• Skyy
• Stolichnaya
• Teton
• Vincent Van Gogh
 Value brand vodkas: These brands are priced up to $15 per
bottle. Examples of value brand vodkas are:
• Fris
• Georgi
• Nikolai
• Smirnoff
• Svedka
• Tito’s Handmade

Choosing vodkas by country of origin
What countries make vodka? Chances are good that if you spin a
globe and stick a pin anywhere it stops, you’ve found a vodka
source. Table 10-2 is a representative list of products from a repre-
sentative list of countries. Note: No prices are shown because of
the differences in taxation between one state in the U.S. and
another and the differences of import excise taxes on goods from
one country to another.

Choosing vodkas by the base
Basically, the choice of the foods from which popular vodkas are
distilled boils down (that’s a joke, folks) to two: Grains and potatoes.
Examples of grain-based vodkas are:
 Absolut (Winter Wheat)
 Belvedere (Polish Rye)
 Skyy (Corn)
Examples of potato-based vodkas are:
 Chopin
 Spudka
 Teton
 Blue Ice
Pure foodies may be interested to know that the American-made
Square One boasts of being made from organic rye. The latest
organic to join the list is Rain, which is made from organic corn.
Hey, whatever floats your vodka Martini.
Choosing vodkas by flavor
Many regular vodkas also have fruit flavored versions. For exam-
ple, Smirnoff produces lemon and other flavored versions. Table
10-3 lists vodkas available in flavored versions.

Tasting vodka neat
To freeze or not to freeze, that is the question.
Nobody argues that warm vodka is good. In fact, warm vodka is
decidedly unpleasant to the nose and the palate. But how cold is
the right cold?
The Russians traditionally stick their vodka in the freezer. Some
wags suggest that this practice comes from the fact that the inside
of the freezer is warmer than the room temperature during a
Russian winter.
In fact, the vodka won’t freeze in your freezer because ethyl alco-
hol doesn’t freeze until the temperature hits –117 degrees Celsius.
That’s a tad lower than the freezer in your kitchen.
In other words, putting the vodka into the freezer is a pleasant but
meaningless affectation. Want it colder than room temperature?
Chill the bottle in the fridge, chill the glasses in the freezer, or add
ice cubes.
Sampling vodkas: What 
to see, sniff, and taste
If pressed, most people say that vodka is a truly neutral distilled
spirit — that is: no flavor, no aroma, no color.

186
Follow the leader
Are your eyes glazed? Does the incredible number of choices leave you, well,
breathless? For consumers looking for the easy way, here’s a list of the ten best-
selling domestic vodka brands and the ten best-selling imported vodka brands for
2005. These lists were compiled by The Adams Liquor Handbook, a seriously
respected liquor industry publication.
 Domestic best-sellers: Smirnoff, Skyy, McCormick (regional), Popov, Gordon’s,
Barton, Skol, Kamchatka, Fleischmann’s Royal, Seagram’s
 Imported best-sellers: Absolut, Grey Goose, Stolichnaya, Ketel One, Svedka,
Three Olives, Finlandia, Belvedere, Fris, Tanqueray Sterling
By the way, lest you think that Europeans have a lock on the market, Adams wants
you to know that domestic vodkas accounted for 70 percent of all vodka sales in
2005. Take that, you furriners.

“Most people,” as usual, aren’t absolutely right.
Vodka tasting experts — such as the people who make vodka —
can almost always tell one brand from another. They’ve been tast-
ing vodkas for a long time and have perfected the ability to detect
virtually undetectable flavor notes and degrees of smoothness (lack
of a harsh alcohol bite).
Can an ordinary everyday vodka drinker do that? Maybe. But it
takes practice. Lots of practice with one sip (no swallowing, please)
at a time. Some of the terms the experts use most often are “smooth,”
“creamy” and a “long finish,” which means that the taste stays in
the mouth for a while. The flavor most often identified is vanilla.
Occasionally a vodka may be “spicy,” particularly those vodkas
with a little more rye or wheat in the mash blend. Keep in mind that
while five distillations may remove all the flavor, some is put back
in through additives, such as glycerin, to help smooth the spirit.
Serving vodka after the tasting
After you taste vodkas neat and choose the one(s) you prefer, you
may wish to move on to vodka mixed drinks.
That may be as simple as adding an olive or a twist of lemon; if 
you have a sweeter palate, a pitted sweet cherry should do it.
Vodka purists, however, frown on salting (as with tequila) or put-
ting something with a hot flavor (such as a chili pepper) into the
glass. The pepper used in flavored vodkas is much milder than
those usually used in cooking. Whatever you add to the drink,
remember that vodka’s flavor is very subtle — learn how to find 
it, not smother it.
Ice, the common vodka companion, is best made with distilled
water — unless your town’s tap water is absolutely tasteless
(believe it or not, some are).
Mixers are a mixed bag. Fruit juices do well. The less acidic the
flavor (think peaches), the clearer the subtleties of the vodka. But
lemony vodka drinks are very popular. Go figure!
Colas are a no-no, even the diet versions, because they’re so
strongly flavored. But tonic — whose flavor is anything but shy —
is A-okay. That’s another “go figure.” Some bartenders frown on
loading the spices into a Bloody Mary, while others go for broke.
(Speaking of the Bloody Mary, see Chapter 15 for the recipe.)

Tequila: Unearthing 
the Aztecs
In This Chapter
 Discovering Tequila’s prehistoric history
 Exploring the agave
 Describing the difference between pulque, Tequila, and mezcal
 Mapping the Tequila regions
T
his chapter shatters the Euro-centric myth that the Western
hemisphere had no fermented beverages before the arrival of
the Europeans. In fact, virtually every group of Amerinds, natives
in the north and those in the south as well, had its own fermented
beverage. Primary among them was the Aztecs’ pulque.
The Europeans brought with them the art and science of distilla-
tion, which the Amerinds had never developed — much like the
Incans failing to invent the wheel but building a marvel of a road
system throughout their empire.
Because the northern natives were hunter/gatherers, they obvi-
ously had little time to further develop any type of beverage that
couldn’t be swallowed at the moment of thirst or distress. However,
the Incans and Mayans were another story. Witnessing their ancient
cities and seeing their pictograph language shows that these were a
highly organized and forward-thinking group of people.
But credit for creating and developing the present worldwide thirst
for Tequila, mezcal, and variants goes to the Spaniards. It was their
idea to bring the agave to a higher level by making it more accept-
able for Europeans and certainly ultimately for Norte Americanos.

The First North American Spirit
As North America’s first distilled spirit and first commercially pro-
duced alcohol beverage this side of the Atlantic, Tequila’s history
is long and rich. Its roots reach back into pre-Hispanic times when
the natives fermented sap from the local maguey plants (which the
Spanish conquistadores called agave) into a low-alcohol fermented
beverage they called pulque.
The history of Tequila’s development from that traditional beverage
to the modern spirit parallels the often turbulent, chaotic growth of
Mexico herself, and is often equally obscure to outsiders.
The history of Tequila is really the history of one plant and three
beverages. The plant, of course, is the maguey, which isn’t a cactus
but rather a succulent assigned to the amaryllis family and a cousin
to the century plant, also known as the American aloe.
The three beverages are:
 Pulque: First naturally fermented in Mexico almost two mil-
lennia before the arrival of Europeans
 Mezcal: A strong wine made from the maguey plant by the
invading Spanish
 Tequila: A distilled spirit so popular that it took on the name
of the city in northwest Mexico where it was first made — and
from there it was shipped to Europe and ultimately around the
world
Tequila is customarily spelled with a capital “T” as an indication of
its appellation status (a specific region of a specific country), simi-
lar to Burgundy wine produced in the Burgundy, France region or
Bourbon for the Kentucky whiskey.
Ancient history
When you’re dealing with the origins of Tequila, “ancient” doesn’t
mean before the founding of the Republic of Mexico (1921), or
before guitarist Don Gaspar Vargas created the first modern
Mariachi band in Tecalitlán (1897), or even before the Spaniards
landed in Mexico to take the land from Montezuma (1519).
No, in Tequila talk, “ancient” means r-e-a-l-l-y long ago, as in 100,000
BCE when — historians suggest — a volcano erupting in the north-
western part of that land near modern Jalisco tossed tons of 
Part III: Surfing the White Waters: A Guide to “Clear” Spirits 
192

mineral-rich ash into the air. The ash fell back to earth, creating a
rich soil on which the agave thrives.
And that pesky volcano did more. An Aztec legend has it that the
heat of the lava set fire to some maguey plants and filled the air with
a smoky sweet odor. When the residents went to learn what was
what, they found burnt plants with sap seeping from their hearts.
The Aztecs tasted the sap and yelled “Huzzah” or whatever their
word was. They were drunk with, and because of, their discovery.
Tasting it resulted in a feeling of euphoria that led them to say that
the juice — which they called pulque — was a gift from the gods.
As time went by, pulque was commandeered by Aztec priests for
their exclusive use; non-priestly folk caught with a bowl of pulque
were sentenced to death. The survival of the plants was so impor-
tant to their religious observances that the priests often offered
human sacrifices to defeat droughts or plant diseases — at which
point the designated donor was permitted a drink of pulque to
help ease the pain of the execution.
Chapter 11: Tequila: Unearthing the Aztecs 193
Agave, the mother of all Tequila
The Spanish renamed the maguey plant agave, a name accepted by later botanists.
Those botanists include Sweden’s Carolus Linnaeus (1707–1778), also known as Carl
von Linné, who first identified the maguey as a member of the amaryllis family, and
Germany’s Franz Weber, who recognized that the maguey from northern Mexico
wasn’t the same as the maguey in the south. In 1902 he put the stamp on his dis-
covery by naming it Agave Azul Tequiliana Weber after — who else? — himself.
The species name agave honors the original Agave, who, in the ancient myth, was
the mother of a Greek king, Pentheus of Thebes. Pentheus promoted himself as a
moral sort of guy, the man who banned festivals celebrating Bacchus, the god of
wine, because the parties were characterized by unseemly behavior. In a word or
two, drunken orgies.
Pentheus’ dictate was okay with Agave until she discovered her son having a high
old time at one such event. Straight away, Agave rounded up all the women in her
family and they dismembered Pentheus. That’s certainly a dramatic way of show-
ing that nobody loves a hypocrite.
Other than that rather tenuous connection with alcohol beverages, nothing ties
Agave to the plant that produces Tequila.
But it’s certainly a good story.

That’s the way it went, with the Aztecs planting and cultivating the
remarkable plant they named maguey (origin unknown) and 
cutting the plants to drink the sap that the Nahluatl Indians called
mezcal from mexcalil, which looks a lot like Mexico.
Then came the conquistadores, led by Hernando Cortez, who even-
tually conquered all of Mexico, including the region in the northwest
that they named New Galicia after the Spanish state. And along the
way, they discovered the maguey and its lovely powers.
Thus began the modern — or at least the middle — history of
Tequila.
Tequila’s middle ages
This era in Tequila history stretches roughly from the moment when
Hernando Cortez marched into Tenochtitlan (Mexico City) to be
greeted by Montezuma as the legendary white god who taught the
Aztecs how to farm. Befitting his status, Cortez got a glass, or a
bowl, of pulque and wanted more. With more kick to it. He immedi-
ately sent off to Spain for a still. When it arrived, he taught the
locals how to use it and so kicked pulque up a notch to mezcal.
In the mid 1500s, another Spanish explorer, Don Pedro Sanchez
Tagle, the Marquis de Altamira, established the first Mexican dis-
tillery on his maguey farm at the village of Tuiquila in the north-
western section known today as Jalisco. He started turning pulque
into mezcal and offering it as aguardiente (literally “fire water”) for
sale locally. Eventually, business boomed; the name of the village
was Spanish-ized to Tequila, and bingo! A center for exporting a
Mexican spirit was born.
By the 18th century, mezcal was selling so well that the taxes 
collected on the mezcal trade within Mexico as well as to Spain
were sufficient for the government to subsidize building much of
Guadalajara, the country’s second largest city. In fact, sales were
so good that they were cutting into Spanish spirit sales at home,
leading the then-king, Charles III, to prohibit importation of any
Mexican spirituous beverages.
Fortunately, the ban lasted only a decade until the next king
reversed it in 1795 and issued the first retail license to sell mezcal
(or mezcal brandy and agave brandy as it was also known) to José
Antonio Montaño y Cuervo. Immodestly, he named his place 
Part III: Surfing the White Waters: A Guide to “Clear” Spirits 
194

La Taberna de Cuervo. Shortly thereafter, the king issued the first
right to distill the spirit to José Jr. and so established a dynasty
that lasts into the 21st century.
Like all those who distilled the country’s favorite spirit, José Jr.
was no slouch at promotion, even to his putative enemies. People
from the United States got their first taste of mezcal in 1846 during
the Mexican-American war (also known as “The Fight For Texas”).
During the U.S. Civil War, enterprising Mexicans put the mezcal
into discarded whiskey barrels and sold it by the ladleful to sol-
diers along the border. When the French invaded Mexico in 1862
by winning a battle now memorialized by the Cinco de Mayo holi-
day, the Mexican civilians were there to greet them with rifles —
and mezcal.
Shortly thereafter, all spirits made in Jalsico were renamed Tequila,
and a good old high time was had by all.
Chapter 11: Tequila: Unearthing the Aztecs 195
Jose Cuervo: Hero of the Tequila revolution
The commercial Tequila business can trace its origins to the first land grant by a
Spanish king to a nobleman in the New World. The nobleman was José Antonio
Montaño y Cuervo. His family name means crow. And a crow is part of the family
heraldic shield that appears on every bottle of Cuervo, even to this day.
The grant was soon followed by the first license ever granted in Mexico to a planter
to sell his Tequila at retail. Don Cuervo took his thousands of acres and converted
them to a plantation for cultivated maguey. When the plants matured for cutting, his
son José Guadalupe, who inherited the family business, opened La Taberna Cuervo
in the former village of Tequila, then a city of more than 20,000.
But the family had many years of little wealth due to Spanish taxation and other
unresolved political questions. These came to an end in 1821 when Mexico gained
its independence from Spain. Cut loose from Spanish goods, the Mexicans started
to govern their own industries.
By the mid-19th century, the Cuervo family fields were growing more than three mil-
lion agave plants. When these plants matured, in 1880, Cuervo enjoyed annual sales
of an estimated 10,000 barrels of its Tequila in nearby Guadalajara alone.
Despite the invasion and occupation of Mexico by France, the family persevered
and stuck to its guns — or rather its plans for growth — so that in the 21st century,
Cuervo is the world’s leading Tequila producer, and the Cuervo descendants still
operate the plantation and the distilleries.

Tequila’s trek north
As it was for Canadians to the north of the United States (see
Chapter 8), the U.S. experiment of Prohibition was a boon to
Mexico and its Tequila on the southern border. Gringos traveled
to Mexico by the thousand to pick up a bottle or two or three or
more.
The end of Prohibition may have impeded the continued growth 
of the Mexican distilling business, but World War II — with its con-
sequent U.S. government request for local distillers to switch from
making alcohol for drinking to making it for gunpowder — was
enough to keep the Mexican industry booming. One expert esti-
mates that 21,000 liters of Tequila were produced in 1941, which
leaped to more than 4 million liters by the end of the war — most
for export to the U.S. After the war, several U.S. companies, such
as Heublein (now a division of the Diageo company), swung into
action by importing Jose Cuervo.
The rest, as they say, is history.
Defining Tequila: New Standards
for a New Global Spirit
In an effort to make Tequila into a more widely accepted and recog-
nized spirit type, in 1974 the Mexican government asked that
Tequila be granted an appellation of origin. The request was
granted in 1994. This term means that the product is named after a
specific geographical region — one that throughout time has been
devoted to the product’s production. The region gives the spirit its
special characteristics due to the climate, location, and cultural
tradition of the area.
This appellation of origin puts Tequila in the same class as
Champagne, Cognac, Roquefort cheese, Bourbon, Tennessee
Whiskey, and other similar products. The appellation carries with
it an assurance of compliance to a set standard as established by
the individual government.
The U.S. Standards of Identity, as set down in the Federal Register
by the former Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (now
known as the Alcohol and Tobacco Trade Bureau) define Tequila
as “a regional alcohol drink obtained by distillation and rectifica-
tion from musts originally made from ground ‘heads’ of ripe Agave
Tequiliana Weber Blue variety which were cooked or hydrolyzed
Part III: Surfing the White Waters: A Guide to “Clear” Spirits 
196

subject to alcohol fermentations with cultured or non-cultured
yeasts. These yeasts can be enriched with other sugars up to a
ratio of not more than 49 percent. Subsequent mixing of sub-
sequent mixing of the producer’s finished products is not allowed.”
Tequila is a colorless liquid that can turn a yellowish or caramel
color when aged in white or yellow oak containers, or with the
addition of permitted additives. The “Denomination of Origin” 
law of 1994 defined the area in which the blue agave is grown. It
includes the state of Jalisco (see Figure 11-1) and some regions in
other states that have similar reddish volcanic soil and climate.
 The original Tequila region located around the town of
Tequila, which is in Jalisco
 Guadalajara, which is Mexico’s second largest city and the
capital of Jalisco state
 The other best-known Tequila-producing towns: El Arenal and
Amatitán, which are a few miles west of Tequila
 The Los Altos highlands east of Guadalajara that include
Atotonilco, Tepatitlán, and Arandas
 Lowland towns Tesistán and Capilla de Guadalupe in Jalisco,
and Corralejo in Guanajuato

How Tequila Is Made
As with all distilled products, the process begins with choosing the
base and then slowly and deliberately converting it to a satisfying
beverage. Throughout the production of Tequila, representatives of
the Tequila Regulatory Council oversee activities to ensure that
standards of identification and quality regulated by Mexican law
are followed.
During the distillation process, some producers add cane sugar or
piloncillo (brown sugar cones) to speed up fermentation and save
money by permitting the distiller to produce the Tequila using
fewer mature agaves. Made this way, the Tequila is called mixto
and can be sold in bulk for export or bottling outside Mexico, but
it can’t be labeled 100 percent agave.
For more information on Tequila standards, e-mail the Tequila
Regulatory Council (CRI) at crt@crt.org.mx.
Choosing the base material
Tequila distillers have been trying for decades to dispel the idea
that Tequila is made from cactus, but the myth is still around.
Despite growing alongside cacti, agave isn’t a cactus. Tequila is
made of distilled sap from the root of a specific blue-green agave
succulent plant that’s called the Blue Weber agave.
Mexico has 136 species of agave, including 26 sub-species of which
only Tequiliana Azul Weber is allowed for use in making Tequila. A
mature agave has leaves that are 5 to 8 feet tall, is 7 to 12 feet in
diameter, and has a life span of 8 to 15 years depending on the 
climate and soil.
Agaves are grown in cultivated orchards called porteros (pastures,
also called campos de agave or huertas). These porteros often
resemble vineyards, and you’re likely to see corn or beans growing
between the rows of the 1,000 to 2,000 plants in a typical acre. The
agave plants are propagated from shoots (mecuates or hijuleos)
taken from adult plants four to six years after planting. At that time,
the shoots are at least a year old, and about the size of a leek or
small onion. They’re left to dry in the field for about a month and
then removed to a nursery for another year. Only then are they
planted in the field.
Part III: Surfing the White Waters: A Guide to “Clear” Spirits 
198

Pressing the agave
The part of the plant used for Tequila is the giant root called the
piña, also known as the head or cabeza. As the word piña suggests,
the root looks like a large pineapple. As it pushes its way upward
through the earth, the piña puts on weight; when it’s fully grown
after 8 to 12 years, it may weigh between 77 and 308 pounds.
Fortunately for the harvesters (or jimadores), most roots weigh
fewer than 200 pounds. The piña is ripe when the leaves develop 
a maroon coloration with red spots. Only then is the piña cut 
from the stalk to start its way through the distillery.

Each 15.4 pounds of piña yields about one liter of Tequila; the 
average piña yields 5 to 20 liters.
Preparing the mash
Traditionally, distillers let the piñas soften in steam rooms or slow-
bake ovens for 50 to 72 hours. The traditional stone or brick oven
is called a horno, which is where Sauza got the inspiration for its
Hornitos brand name.
This softening process bakes the agaves at around 60 to 80 degrees
Celsius. The slow baking softens the fibers and prevents the natu-
ral sugars from caramelizing, thus reducing the chances of bitter
flavors in the juice.
Some Tequila distillers precook the piñas to remove external wax
and solids to remove any possibility from adding bitterness to the
final juice.
After the piñas are precooked and then slow baked or steamed,
they’re cooled and then beaten with mallets. Finally, distillers
move them to a tahona, a giant grinding wheel or mechanical
crusher or shredder that presses out the juice while removing and
discarding waste. That waste may be used as animal foods or fertil-
izer, in a process similar to what occurs with the waste from grains
used in making whiskeys (see Chapter 6).
The piñas are minced and strained to remove juices called
aquamiel (honey water), and then mixed with water in large vats to
produce a mash (wort) that’s sprinkled with yeast — traditionally
Part III: Surfing the White Waters: A Guide to “Clear” Spirits 
200
Let’s hear it for the jimadores
The skill of harvesting is passed down from father to son, and some fields have three
generations of jimadores (harvesters) working in them. Methodical but efficient, a
good jimador can harvest more than a ton of piñas in a day. Full truckloads are car-
ried to the factory where the piñas are usually quartered or halved before baking.
Harvesting is done year-round because the plants mature at different stages in the
fields. Some large distillers pick young agaves, but others, like Herradura, use only
plants that are 10 years old or older.
Before the piñas can be processed, jimadores cut the 200 or more spiky thorn-covered
leaves (pencas) off them using a sharp, long-handled tool called a coa. They do this
process almost entirely by hand because of the softness of the piña.

a strain that grows naturally on the plant leaves. Some distillers
use cultivated yeasts or even a commercial brewer’s yeast.
Fermenting the wort
The wort is left to ferment in wooden or stainless steel tanks for
7 to 12 days. At this point, some producers add piña residue for
more flavor in the wort. When fermentation is complete — meaning
that the conversion of sugars in the wort have an alcohol concen-
tration of about 5 to 7 percent alcohol by volume — the wort may
be left standing for another 12 hours to let the flavor richen and
settle. Next, the distiller sends the fermented wort to the still, at
which point he may set some of it aside to be used as a starter in
the next mash very similar to the “sour mash” method used in
Bourbon (see Chapter 6).
Distilling not once but twice
The liquid strained from the wort is distilled twice, once each in
either a copper pot still or a stainless steel column still. Distillation
takes 4 to 8 hours. The first distillation (ordinario) takes 11⁄2 to 2
hours to produce a spirit that’s about 40 proof (20 percent alcohol
by volume, or ABV). The second distillation takes 3 to 4 hours to
reach a spirit that’s about 110 proof (55 percent ABV).
As in other spirit distillations, the process yields three distinct 
liquids:
 The cabeza (head) has more alcohol and more of the unpleas-
ant flavoring agent called aldehydes, and it’s discarded.
 The middle part of the distillation, called “el corazon” (the
heart), is put aside as the final spirit.
 The end of the run, called colos (tails), is either discarded or
re-distilled to add more flavor to triple distilled Tequila. Some
distillers believe that the third distillation actually causes the
spirit to lose flavor.
Aging the spirit
As with all spirits, Tequila is clear when it comes off the still. Aging
adds color and helps classify the type of Tequila into one of the 
following:
Chapter 11: Tequila: Unearthing the Aztecs 201

 Blanco (silver) is basically un-aged Tequila, bottled right after
distillation or after the distiller allows it to rest for no more
than two months in stainless steel vats.
 Joven (gold) is also known as suave or abocado. These terms
imply youth and freshness. Joven is un-aged Blanco with added
coloring or flavoring agents — such as oak tree extracts, glyc-
erin, or sugar — to soften the spirit. Joven may also be Blanco
blended with aged or extra-aged Tequilas.
 Reposado (aged) is Tequila that has been stored in barrels
made from charred American oak for a minimum of two
months but no more than 12 months.
 Añejo (vintage aged) has been aged in barrels with a capacity
of no more than 600 liters for at least one year and sometimes
as long as three.
 Extra Añejo (ultra-aged), the newest type of Tequila, was first
standardized in October 2005. It’s a distillate aged for a mini-
mum of four years in wooden barrels with a capacity of no
more than 600 liters.
Distillers age their Tequilas in barrels that may have been used
before to age other spirits — such as Bourbon, other whiskeys,
sherry, or Cognac — in order to get different flavoring agents from
the wood into their Tequila. Barrels may be used for 50 years or
more.
Another way to create different flavors than the competition is to
add actual fruit essences or even fruit juice. But those who love
the earthy undertones of Tequila say that flavored versions should
be used only for cocktail making.
Although aging does add color and certain flavor undertones to all
spirits, including Tequila, the color of the spirit itself may not be a
reliable guide to either its actual age or flavor. As more Tequila
drinkers go after the richer flavor, some less-than-perfect distillers
simply toss in a coloring agent, such as caramel. Honorable dis-
tillers, of course, lengthen the time spent in the barrel to deepen
the flavor, or they may practice the art of blending as allowed
under the regulations to produce a fuller flavor.
Blending and bottling
The contents of barrel-aged Tequila are usually blended with simi-
lar aged Tequilas from different barrels. This process enables a 
distiller to maintain a brand of consistent flavor, aroma, and color
from year to year.
Part III: Surfing the White Waters: A Guide to “Clear” Spirits 
202

Before bottling, the blended Tequila is filtered through activated
carbon or cellulose filters and diluted with distilled water to reduce
the alcohol content, most commonly to 80 proof (40 percent ABV).
The Different Brands of Tequila
The standards permit two different kinds of Tequila. The first is the
top level — Tequila 100 Percent Agave — that must be made from
100 percent Tequiliana Weber Blue Agave only. The second cate-
gory is Tequila made from a minimum of 51 percent of blue agave
sugars together with 49 percent other sugars, often called mixto, a
word that doesn’t appear on labels. However, both categories are
clearly identified.
Chapter 11: Tequila: Unearthing the Aztecs 203
Mezcal: The “other” Tequila
Tequila is globally recognized as the king of Mexican spirits, but some confusion
exists between Tequila and the “other” Tequila — mezcal. Tequila can be made only
from the blue agave grown in specific appellation areas, but several different
species of agave are permitted for use in mezcal, including tobala, a rare wild
species.
Although similar, the agaves used in mezcal are harvested younger than the Tequila
agave. This youth means a rawer, less complex flavor in the finished product, which
feels very “hot” on the back of the throat. Because of this heat, mezcal is often con-
sidered a more masculine drink than Tequila.
To make mezcal, the sugar-rich piñas are baked slowly in a rock-lined pit oven over
charcoal, and covered with layers of palm-fiber mats and earth. This process gives
mezcal a strong, smoky, and leathery flavor. Larger distillers often cook piñas in a
single day using steam pressure cookers. Distillers with a more limited production
may simply buy agave syrup to save still more time and cost.
Tequila is distilled twice or occasionally three times; mezcal goes through only a
single distillation. The result is that mezcal has more congeners (flavoring agents)
while Tequila achieves a more balanced, yet still complex, flavor.
Despite the difference in flavors, Tequila and mezcal contain about the same level
of alcohol — 38 to 40 percent ABV — partly because of Tequila’s careful blending
to keep the taste in balance.
Clearly the choice between mezcal and Tequila rests on a simple fact: More people
like the balanced earthiness of Tequila than prefer the rough edges of mezcal.
Currently you can find between 400 and 600 brands of Tequila and only about 100
brands of mezcal.

A number of outstanding Tequilas are available throughout the
world in the following ranges (all prices are U.S. dollars for a 
750ml bottle):
 Ultra-premium Tequilas run more than $40 a bottle.
 Premium Tequilas include a fine selection of $30 brands.
 Value-priced Tequilas cost $20 or less, and many of these
mass market products are mixto.
Of course, price alone shouldn’t be the final decision maker in
selecting a Tequila or mezcal brand favorite. Taste should always
be the ultimate factor. Some people prefer the rougher edge of the
young Blanco Tequilas or mezcal with its more distinct agave flavor.
Others like the sharper, almost peppery flavor of a mid-aged
Reposado. And some may prefer the smooth, woody aroma in an
even older Añejo. Like single-malt Scotches, or craft brews, Tequilas
vary according to the company making them, the process, and the
ingredient-growing environment. The temperature, soil, types of
equipment, age of the plants, means by which the plants are pre-
pared, and the blending and aging all affect the flavor and body.

Eeek! There’s a worm in my drink!
You may have heard an interesting urban legend related to a worm in a bottle of
Tequila. Some American-bottled brands of mezcal put a worm — usually made of
plastic — in their bottles. The object seems to be to impress the gringos and boost
sales with a legend that the worm was added to show that the beverage inside the
bottle was actually alcohol, and to show that the proof indicated was accurate. In
addition, the legend said that eating the worm was an aphrodisiac.
In actuality, the worm is far from being a Mexican tradition. It was a marketing ploy
in the 1940s, started by an importer whose name has been lost to history.
So, the worm in the bottle isn’t real — but you may find a bottle with a real moth
caterpillar inside. Two types of caterpillars are used — the red, gusano rojo, con-
sidered superior because it lives in the root of the maguey, and the less-prized white
or gold gusano de oro, which lives on the leaves. Both larvae are commonly eaten
as food and are still today sold in Zapotec markets.
Yes, the drinker is meant to eat the non-plastic worm. Don’t worry, it’s quite well
pickled and free of pesticides — these worms are often raised just for use in mezcal
and then pickled for a year. But, despite the fact that the word mezcal sounds like
it’s associated with the drug mescaline, it has no magical or psychotropic proper-
ties, as either an aphrodisiac or the key to an unseen world.
It’s merely protein and alcohol — but it’s very rich in imagery.

Fancy packaging, wooden boxes, and elegant bottles are now
common with ultra-premium Tequilas. They have become collec-
tor’s items in their own right. Although they don’t add to the basic
quality of the drink in the bottle, they do add to its charm and 
certainly its visual appeal.
For more information on Tequila standards, contact the Tequila
Regulatory Council (CRT) at crt@crt.org.mx.
Tasting Tequila and Mezcal
As usual, the tasting is the good part. So pull up a glass or two and
get going. The basic rules for setting up a Tequila tasting are much
the same as those for tasting any food or drink: Choose your sam-
ples, smell and taste them, and decide which you like best.
Chapter 3 lays out the details of a general tasting, along with an
explanation of how your nose and palate transmit signals that your
brain interprets as, “Oh, boy that’s good,” or “Eeeeew. Take that
stuff away.”
To apply these details to a Tequila tasting, try one of the following:
 Choose a minimum of three brands, each representing one
type of Tequila.
 Select three samples from one distiller, such as Jose Cuervo,
to experience the difference within a family of Tequila.

less than $20 (value brands) to $30 (premium brands) to as high as
$200 (ultra-premium brands). All price ranges are in U.S. dollars for
a 750 ml bottle.
In other words, you can sample a really well-made premium Tequila
for about the price of a mid-range single malt Scotch.

Tasting the Tequilas
As you go through the following steps, note your reactions on your
tasting sheet so that you can review them later.

First, look at the color. Pour about an ounce of Tequila into a tall,
wide-mouthed glass. Next, hold the glass against a clean white
sheet of paper with the light behind it. Depending on the type of
Tequila, the color should range from clear (blanco) to a deep rich
gold/amber (añejo).
As for body, swirl the glass so that the Tequila goes up the side.
Aged Tequila will roll back very slowly — the greater the viscosity,
the slower the legs give it up, and the older the Tequila.
Good Tequila smells and tastes good. If you notice an off aroma,
such as oil or gasoline, don’t even waste time tasting it. Check out
Table 11-2 for a guide to the aromas and flavors expert tasters find
in good Tequila. See how many you can actually identify.
Now add water to the Tequila in your next tasting glass (you want
to add about two-thirds water compared to one-third Tequila).
Repeat the aroma and flavor tests.
Finally, do as the Mexicans do, and have a bite or two of a taco or
some unsalted nachos to cleanse your palate. And move on to
brand or type #2.

Pairing Food with Tequila
North Americans have been voting with their feet when trying cui-
sine while dining out or making something relatively simple at
home. For many years, their first love was French, and then they
discovered Italian. Years ago, North Americans relished spaghetti
and red sauce (some people even used catsup) accompanied by
that height of sophistication — a bottle of Chianti covered with a
net that could, when empty, be used as a candle holder. The people
of this great continent have come a long way since then.
Chapter 11: Tequila: Unearthing the Aztecs 207

The same will happen with the present number two menu choice —
Mexican cuisine. Today, it’s still widely considered tacos and a
bottle of beer. But that’s all changing as Americans become more
familiar with the wonders and glories of the best meals that can
come from south of the border. What better beverage to wash a
Mexican meal down with than a fine Tequila or a cocktail made
with a tasty Blanco?
After all, most alcohol beverages were created to augment and
enhance the local style of cooking. So, although Tequila may go
well with virtually any spicy, earthy type of food (even Italian), it
does pair best with Mexican dishes.
Generally, Blancos are more food friendly than Añejos. The Blancos
need food to take the edge off their “peasant” flavor, while the aged
Tequilas can be sipped.
Of course, many Tequila fans say that you should never waste any
Tequila in a cocktail, and certainly not in a slammer. Sipping a well-
aged, balanced Extra Añejo is as pleasant as sipping a fine brandy —
and for some people maybe more so.
There’s a cultural reason for that too. Consider: The most popular
alcohol beverage today in Mexico is not Tequila but brandy.
Hmmm.
You’ve come to the end of this chapter on Tequila. As they say in
Mexico when hoisting a glass:
Salud, amor y pesetas y el tiemppara gustarios! (Health, love,
and money, and the time to enjoy them!)

Yo Ho Ho and a Bottle of Rum
In This Chapter
 Discovering the place where rum was born
 Tracking rum’s travels around the globe
 Tasting the basic rum types
 Naming popular brands of rum
T
his chapter explains how rum is made. It lists the various types
of rum made in countries from Australia to Antigua, and serves
up a splendid dish of rum history, including the fact that the Dutch
in New Amsterdam opened the first rum distillery in America in
1664. This proves again, as New Yorkers like to say, “If you can
make it here, you can make it anywhere.”
And, if any spirit ever did make it anywhere, rum certainly did. It
started as the juice from pressed sugar cane in New Guinea several
centuries ago. It traveled through India to Persia, to the Mediter
ranean, and it went with Columbus to the New World. There, it
turned the Caribbean into today’s global center of rum production.
Ever changing, today’s rum keeps up with the demand for greater
variety in spirits with more aged products, new flavorings, and new
drinks — but it never loses sight of “Rum and Coca-Cola.”
The History of Rum
The basic ingredient used in making rum is sugar cane, a tall reed
grass first cultivated in New Guinea an estimated 10,000 years ago
and much later in Indonesia, India, and the Philippines. How tall is
this reed grass? It can reach as high as 30 feet.
Europeans got their first glimpse of sugar cane around 327 BCE
when Nearchus, a general with Alexander the Great’s army in
Central Asia, reported finding “an Indian reed, which brings forth
honey without the need of bees, from which an intoxicating drink
is made.”

No fools they, Nearchus and Alexander toted cuttings of this mira-
cle grass back home. They planted the sugar cane in the northern
Mediterranean where it quickly became known for its ability to
give sweetness without stinging. This episode laid the groundwork
for millions of rum drinks in the centuries to come.
From arak to rum
By the seventh century, people were converting sugar cane in
northern Africa and the entire Mediterranean basin, including the
islands. Ultimately, the Moors brought the sugar produced there to
the Iberian Peninsula. In every place it was grown, the folks
 Crushed the cane to release a sweet liquid
 Put the liquid out to sit, enabling yeasts floating naturally in
the air to fall into and ferment the liquid
 Enjoyed the benefits in the form of arak, a fermented beverage
still made and enjoyed throughout the Middle East, India, and
Central and Southeast Asia
The Moors used crystallized cane juice to sweeten foods and make
medicines more palatable. Later on, Abu Musa Jabir ibn Hayyam
(for more on him, see Chapter 1) invented distillation. He (or one
of his assistants) poured the cane juice into a pot still, heated it,
collected the vapors and gave birth to — drumroll, please! — rum.
Hooray for Christopher Columbus
In 1493, on his second trip across the Ocean Sea (translation:
Atlantic Ocean), Admiral Christopher Columbus landed on an
island he named Hispaniola (now home to Haiti and the Dominican
Republic). On this island, he planted the first sugar to grow in the
Caribbean region.
The island was warm (not hot) and moist (not wet), the perfect
climate for sugar cane, which flourished like, well, the grass it is.
Soon the Spanish planted their flag (and sugar cane) on Cuba
(1511), Puerto Rico (1598), and Jamaica (1599). The Brits grabbed
Barbados; the French took Maritius and St. Kitts. The Portuguese
established their sugar cane production on plantations in Brazil,
where they had the dubious distinction of being the first to use
slave labor, keeping the workforce quiet by giving each a daily
glass of garapa doida (crazy sugar cane juice).
Part III: Surfing the White Waters: A Guide to “Clear” Spirits 
210

By 1625, Brazil had become Europe’s leading sugar mill, and the
entire Caribbean area became the world’s leading source of sugar
cane production, outstripping the Spanish Canary Islands and
Madeira, the refueling and restocking islands that were formerly
the sugar bowl for European ships traveling to the East.
The Caribbean was doing well, too. For example, by 1655, the sugar
crop on the island of Barbados alone was valued at $5 million
annually (in modern dollars).
And then came rum.
Rum rises
The invention of distillation and the creation of rum added tremen-
dous wealth to the “sugar colonies” in the Caribbean and South
America. And the American colonies, which carried the kegs back
and forth across the waters, did well too. In fact, the rum trade was
so profitable that some historians suggest that taxes on rum, not
tea, were what triggered the American Revolution.
Rum was also a pretty good business for privateers (privately
owned trading and raiding ships) and corsairs (outright pirates)
who roamed the seas under any flag that would hire them. These
“businessmen” were so powerful that one, Captain Henry Morgan,
bought a sugar plantation on Jamaica and eventually became
deputy governor of the island and a knight (as in Sir Henry
Morgan) as well.
Legend has it that Captain Morgan is the one who came up with the
single name — rum — for the distilled spirit made from cane sugar.
Certainly, no British “sir” would accept the Spanish name aguardi-
ente or the French eau de vie, and it’s unlikely he even heard of the
Portuguese designation cachaca. But the English rum, a translitera-
tion of the Spanish ron and the French rhum was just fine.
Thank you, Captain Morgan. Hey, isn’t that the name of a modern
brand of rum? Right-e-o, mate. Check out the later section, “Hola!
Rums from the Caribbean,” for more information.
Sugar into rum: A trade bonus
After its discovery, sugar was a culinary delight and an economic
boon to the Europeans. But it wasn’t until the 1700s that the
British realized that the real value of sugar was in distilling the
cane into an alcohol beverage.
Chapter 12: Yo Ho Ho and a Bottle of Rum 211

In 1690, Sir Dalby Thomas, the governor of Jamaica who just hap-
pened to own a sugar cane plantation on the island, sent a memo
to the British Colonial Office suggesting “the spirits arising from
melasses (sic) which is sent from the ‘Sugar Colonies’ to other
colonies and to England, if it were all turned into spirits would
amount annually to above $800,000, at half the price the like quan-
tity of brandy from France would cost.”
In other words, Sir Thomas realized what farmers in Scotland and
Ireland already knew and what Americans would soon learn: It’s
cheaper and more profitable to ship some foodstuffs, such as
grains and sugar, as a highly desirable liquid. That is, as alcohol
beverages.
Quick as a wink, farmers in many lands began turning their sugar
cane into a commercially acceptable alcohol beverage and export-
ing the spirits under a variety of names, all of which ultimately
translated to moneymaker.
And so it has been ever since.
How Rum Is Produced
As with other spirits, the process of making rum includes five basic
steps:
 Choose the base from which to make the spirit
 Distill the spirit
 Age the spirit
 Blend the spirit
 Bottle and sell it

Bay rum
No, you don’t drink this one. Bay rum is a simple distillate made in the Virgin Islands
and on nearby Granada by adding crushed bay leaves to a rum spirit straight off the
still. Originally used as a cure-all for skin and scalp conditions, bay rum evolved into
a male cosmetic when men started using a splash or two to “close the pores” after
a shave and a hot towel at the barber. The scent was grand and the shock of alco-
hol on a recently shaved face was exhilarating. With the advent of the electric razor,
bay rum lost its almost universal popularity, but many men still use it as an aftershave.

What could be more straightforward? (Well, flavored rums are an
additional wrinkle worth mentioning, and I discuss them later in
this section.)
Stop! If you’re reading this chapter before you’ve read Chapter 2,
some technical terms — such as fermentation, mash, or pot still —
may require definition. No problem: Just stick a bookmark here, go
back to read quickly through Chapter 2, and come back when
you’re done.
The base
Rum is made from one of three “starters” — fresh cane juice, cane
syrup, or molasses.
 Cane juice is the liquid extraction gained simply by crushing
one type of sugar cane (several types are listed under the
Latin genetic designation saccharum officinarum). After the
Chapter 12: Yo Ho Ho and a Bottle of Rum 213
The “Triangle Trade”
While Britain ruled the North American colonies, the Americans were required to
buy all their imported goods from either Merrie Olde England or other British
colonies, such as those in the Caribbean. No surprise, then, that as the Brits
expanded their cane growing and rum distillation in the Caribbean, rum became the
alcohol drink of choice from Virginia to Maine. Distilleries opened frequently in New
England where the merchant ships were built and docked. And casks of rum arrived
regularly in Newport, Rhode Island; Boston; and New York to be poured into
punches, toddies, flips, and other rum drinks. In addition, it was poured into medic-
inal concoctions, such as rum drinks (called cocktails for the first time), and in rum-
and-mustard, which was used to “cure” respiratory problems ranging from a mild
cold to tuberculosis.
To meet the demand, Caribbean plantation owners needed laborers willing or forced
to work 17 hours a day under the most horrible conditions. The result was an impor-
tation of ever-increasing numbers of African slaves. Soon a regular trade route was
established with the New Englanders sailing to Africa to bring slaves to the
Caribbean and then loading the now-empty slave ships with casks of rum for the
return trip to North America.
This route, soon dubbed the Triangle Trade, continued until the early 19th century
when Haitian slaves revolted against the French and took control of their island,
creating the first Caribbean republic. To avoid a similar revolt among the “workers,”
Britain abolished slavery in 1833, cutting the arms off the slave triangle.

juice is extracted, it’s strained; some distillers add a bit of
lime juice to clarify the cane juice.
 Cane syrup is the thick liquid produced by reducing cane
juice. As any cook knows, reducing means boiling the cane
juice so that some water escapes as steam, leaving behind a
more concentrated, thicker liquid.
 Molasses comes from the Latin word mellaceus and the Spanish
word melaza, both of which mean like honey. It’s the liquid left
behind when all sucrose (simple sugar) has been crystallized
and removed from the boiled sugar cane juice. To achieve a
deeper flavor, some rum distillers use blackstrap molasses, a
very dark liquid produced when the syrup is caramelized
(heated and darkened) during three rounds, rather than one
round of boiling-and-removing-the-sugar crystals. Fun fact: 
The word blackstrap comes from the Dutch word stroop, which
means syrup.
Occasionally, a distiller may use a base made of matter skimmed
from the tops of the liquid in the pans that are used to process the
sugar cane. This base, however, isn’t as common as cane juice,
cane syrup, or molasses.
Fermentation
The second step in making rum is to add water and yeasts to the
base, creating the mush known technically as a mash (more about
that in Chapter 2). As the mash sits in fermentation tanks for any-
where from one day for lighter rums to three weeks for the heavier
types, the yeasts convert the sugars in the liquid to alcohol in a
chemical reaction. This reaction also creates flavoring agents called
esters. As a rule, the longer the fermentation time, the more com-
plex the final flavor. As for the yeasts, some of the mass distillers
use their own yeast cultures; others rely on the local yeast popula-
tion to do the work.
Distillation
After the mash ferments, it moves on to the stills. Rum distillers
use both pot stills and column stills to distill the mash once, twice,
or even three times. As a general rule of thumb, darker, more fla-
vorful rums are distilled in pot stills. Those rums come off the still
at about 98 proof (45 percent alcohol by volume, or ABV), while
the lighter rums — made on column stills — emerge from the still
at higher alcohol rates (as high as 151 overproof or 75 percent
ABV). These higher rates are due to greater removal of flavoring
agents.

214

Aging
The benefits of aging rum were discovered by accident sometime
in the 17th century. That’s when a couple of barrels of rum bound
from the Caribbean for England were somehow left to stand on a
dock for a longer-than-usual period of time before being loaded
onboard. When the barrels were opened and the rum poured,
eureka! It tasted a whole lot better than the normal run-of-the-
still, sorry, run-of-the-mill, product.
That was then. This is now, and various governments have set
rules about what to call an aged rum:
 Silver rum (white rum) is rum as it comes off the still, usually
after two or three runs through a continuous still.
 Light rum (golden rum) is rum aged a minimum of one year,
either in oak barrels or stainless steel tanks.
 Dark rum (reposado) is rum aged three years or more in
charred oak barrels.
Often the barrels used for aging rum were formerly used for aging
whiskey, sherry, or brandy. Rums aged in these used barrels have
more complex flavors than rums aged in new barrels.
Some distillers darken their light rums with caramel (a sugar
syrup), but only aged rums can be legally labeled “dark rum.”
The color of aged rums may vary depending on how long they age.
For example, golden or amber-colored rums are usually aged at
least three years; the darker rums are usually aged for five years
or more.
Blending
Virtually every bottle of rum sold anywhere in the world is a blend
of rums from different locations, stills, or ages. The art of blending
rums, as with the art of blending whiskeys, rests with a person
with the skill and experience to produce a palate-pleasing flavor.
His (yes, this is a very male-dominated profession) intuition, tast-
ing ability, and knowledge of what’s expected of the product is the
“make or break” of success for any brand. At any time, a distiller’s
warehouse can have thousands of barrels sitting and quietly aging.
Sometimes this inventory can be valued in the hundreds of thou-
sands of dollars, which is a very big investment resting on the
blender’s shoulders. Or, more accurately, his palate.
Chapter 12: Yo Ho Ho and a Bottle of Rum 215

Now there’s an image for you: A man with barrels balanced on 
his tongue. Never say a For Dummies book fails to titillate your
imagination!
Flavoring a favorite
In 1983, a new element was added to the versatility of rum with the
introduction of Captain Morgan Spiced Rum. This Puerto Rican-
made blended rum ranks among the top five sold worldwide, and
its success spurred the creation of many other flavored rums.
The Captain Morgan line now includes a lighter flavored version
(Parrot Bay), plus Black Label Jamaican, Private Stock, and Tattoo
(a very dark rum with a berry/citrus flavor). Each of these rums is
distilled and blended in Puerto Rico, and then bottled in Baltimore,
Maryland.
Bacardi’s first flavored entry, Limon, sold so well that the company
now also produces Ciclon (rum plus 10 percent blue agave Tequila
and a touch of lime), Tropico (Bacardi Gold rum plus tropical fruit

Talking about rum
Wherever rum is made and whatever flavor it carries, the spirit has also added a
rich list of words to the English language. Rummy was once a synonym for one who
abused alcohol. Rum meant bad. Before Prohibition, America’s temperance queen,
Carrie Nation, cut straight to the chase, calling all beverage alcohol demon rum.
And the guys who ferried alcohol into the United States illegally during Prohibition
were called (what else?) rum runners.
But when it comes to inventing nicknames for rum itself, the all-out champs are the
Brits. A partial list culled from a report by the British Broadcasting Corporation lists
the following:
 Barbados water
 Demon water
 Kill-devil
 Navy neaters
 Pirate’s drink
 Rum bastion
 Rumbullion
Whew!

juices), Bacardi O (rum plus orange essence), Razz (rum plus rasp-
berries), Vanilla, Coco (coconut, of course), and Grand Melon
(watermelon).
Cruzan, made in the U.S. Virgin Islands, has eight different flavored
rums, including mango and banana. Presumably, by the time you
read this, you’ll be able to find even more.
Where That Rum Is From 
and Why It Matters
Just as Scotch whiskies from the Highlands taste different from
Scotch whiskies from the Islands (see Chapter 5) and London dry
gin is different from Dutch gins (see Chapter 9), a rum from, say,
Puerto Rico has a character and flavor different from one born
down under in Australia. In the following sections, I fill you in on
the most important information about rums from around the world.
Hola! Rums from the Caribbean
The epicenter of the rum world is still the Caribbean, where the
world’s oldest rum distillery — Mount Gay — continues to produce
rum good enough to rank in the top ten bestsellers in the United
States.
The following is a handy-dandy synopsis of the kinds of rum made
on the various Caribbean islands. For a quick look at some specific
brands from specific islands, check out Table 12-1.

ple, if your rum is made in Puerto Rico, you must say that right on

to find outside the countries in which they’re produced. That’s as
good a reason as any to book a trip to the Caribbean. So what are

local plantations. That changed early in the 1900s when a group of
rum shop owners banded together to create Antigua Distillery.
In the 1950s, the Antiguans introduced Muscovado, a molasses-
based rum. Ten years later, they switched to producing rums from
fresh cane juice. Their most recent introduction is English Harbor
5 Year Old, a brand that’s won awards in various countries. The
line has expanded to include a 25 year old and a 1981 Vintage
English Harbor.
Barbados
This island in the West Indies has a porous soil made of sandstone,
coral, and volcanic ash deposits, so it’s perfect for growing sugar
cane. The only drawback is a lack of surface water; all water used
for irrigation comes from an underground aquifer or from rain-
water captured in cisterns.
Most Barbados rums, made on both pot stills and column stills, 
are molasses-based, fairly light in both color and body, with a soft
smoky or “leathery” aroma and flavor. Some Barbados rums are
aged, giving them a depth comparable to a good brandy (the spirit
about which you can read more in Chapter 13).
Cuba
Rum exports from Cuba to the United States came to an abrupt
halt with the advent of the Castro Revolution. At that time, the
Cuban government appropriated the sugar cane lands, and the
United States banned trade with Cuba. Nonetheless, Cuba —
Bacardi’s original home — continues to distill and export rum
around the world.
Cuban rum is commonly made on column stills. The finished spir-
its are designated Carta Blanca (white label) or Carta Oro (gold
label). The white label is, naturally, a light rum. The gold label often
has caramel added to darken the color and add flavor to the run.
Modern Cuba’s primary export rum is Havana Club. The globally
popular brand is partially owned by the Cuban government, and to
protect its investment, the Cubans have filed World Trade
Organization action against any brands that describe themselves
as being Cuban-made or of Cuban origin when they aren’t.
The Dominican Republic
The Dominican Republic occupies two-thirds of the island of
Hispaniola, the place where Columbus landed in 1493 to plant the
first sugar cane cuttings in the Caribbean, effectively becoming the
Chapter 12: Yo Ho Ho and a Bottle of Rum 219

father of rum. (Flip to the earlier section “Hooray for Christopher
Columbus” for more info.)
Dominican rum is made from molasses, on column stills, and aged
for a minimum of eight months. Some brands are aged as long as
seven years.
Brugal, Ron Bermudez, Matusalem Grand Reserve, and Red Flame
(whose label says “spirit of Cuba,” but whose rum is now made in
the U.S.) date back to the 19th century. The Ron Barcelo brand-
name first appeared in 1929.
Haiti
Haiti, the country that shares the island of Hispaniola with the
Dominican Republic, was controlled by the French. The French
were eventually tossed out by a slave revolution, and those
former slaves started the first republic in the Caribbean in 1803.
However, the Haitians still speak French and they make their rhum
(not rum) with a French accent, producing a spirit by means simi-
lar to those used to make Cognac. That’s no surprise when you
consider that the soil in the area where Haitian sugar cane grows is
similar to the soil in the Cognac and Champagne regions of France.
Haitians press the cane, pasteurize the juice, and ferment it imme-
diately with local yeasts. The first run off the pot still is redistilled
and then aged in oak barrels for three years or more. The raw, un-
aged rum called clairin is commonly sold not for export but by
street vendors during local feast days, celebrations, or religious
voodoo rituals.
Aficionados often describe one Haitian brand in particular, Rhum
Barbancourt, as the world’s finest rum. Unfortunately, Haiti’s politi-
cal instability sometimes interferes with rum production, raising
export prices. This instability can make it difficult to find this
treasure outside of Haiti or duty free shops in Caribbean airports.
Jamaica
Traditionally, Jamaican rums were made on pot stills and were
darker and more aromatic than rums from many other Caribbean
islands. Today, Jamaica has joined the mainstream, and its distiller-
ies now make virtually every variety of rum.
Flavors range from light to dark. The best-known well-regarded light
Jamaican rums are those from Appleton Estate. Myers’s (originally
known as Planter’s Punch) is a standout among the dark rums.
Part III: Surfing the White Waters: A Guide to “Clear” Spirits 
220

Like other British-oriented islands, Jamaica sometimes ships its
rum to England in casks for aging and bottling, thus saving various
tariffs and creating a special category of rum appropriately called
London Dock.
Martinique
Martinique is still part of Metropolitan France, which means that
residents are French citizens with all appropriate rights and duties,
including the ability to vote in French elections. This island has
two claims to fame. First, it has the greatest number of distilleries
in the Eastern Caribbean. Second, it’s the place where the Empress
Josephine (Napoleon’s wife) was born.
Martinique produces two types of rum, rhum agricole and rhum
industriel. Rhum agricole, which is made in Martinique and in
nearby Guadaloupe, is distilled from just-pressed sugar cane juice.
Rhum industriel is distilled from molasses. Both are produced on
column stills and stored in steel vats or oak barrels. Both are aged
for a minimum of three years. To be called rhum vieux (aged rum),
the rum is aged for several years more.
All the island’s agricultural rums were granted a French appellation
designation in 1966, meaning that the cane fields and distilleries are
regularly inspected to make sure they meet government standards.
Puerto Rico
This one island is the world’s largest single rum distilling area, home
of the magnificent Bacardi facility. Bacardi is the world’s leading
rum distiller with nearly 50 percent of the export market and is dis-
tributed in virtually every country in the world. Other fine Puerto
Rican rum brands include Don Q, Ron Del Barrilito, and of course
Captain Morgan Spiced Rums. In addition, Puerto Rico distills over-
proof rums, which are sold primarily for use in cooking and in
flambé-ed cocktails — drinks the bartender lights with a match so
that it flames for a moment as most of the alcohol burns off.
Puerto Rican distillers produce two styles of rum, White Label (very
light) and Gold Label (slightly darker). The white label rums must
be aged a minimum of one year. Gold label rums must be aged
three years. The gold labels are the local favorites, as exemplified
by brands such as Palo Viejo and Ron Llave. Some Puerto Rican
distillers are aging their rums for even longer than three years; for
example, Bacardi now offers an 8-year-old rum.
All Puerto Rican rums are made from molasses, and each of the
island’s distillers cultivates its own yeasts, which are considered
the secret behind the light, dry, yet aromatic quality of the finished
Chapter 12: Yo Ho Ho and a Bottle of Rum 221

spirit. Remember that Puerto Rico is part of the United States, so
its products must meet the same standards as those made on the
mainland.
Trinidad and Tobago
The rums from the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago are made on
column stills. They’re primarily light, molasses-based spirits, simi-
lar to those from Puerto Rico. This similarity marks a move toward
a standard Caribbean flavor, which is indicative of how island rum
making is going.
Angostura, the same distiller that makes Angostura Bitters, offers
an 8-year-old rum in French-made, hand-blown, individually num-
bered glass bottles. Other brands from this island are Fernandes

Rum’s musical
During World War II, the United States Armed Forces established a base on Trinidad
where more than 100,000 servicemen were posted at one time or another and where
many got their first taste of, yes, rum.
The Caribbean spirit quickly became the beverage of choice among the itinerant
servicemen, especially when mixed into a Cuba Libra (the local rum plus Coca-Cola
and lime juice). The new cocktail was so famous that an island Calypso singer named
Lord Invader sang a song about it. In 1943, radio comedian Morey Amsterdam (later
to star as Buddy Sorrell on TV’s Dick Van Dyke Show) heard the song while on a USO
tour.
Amsterdam knew a winner when he heard one. He updated the lyrics, and brought
the music back to the U.S. As luck would have it, he played the Calypso-style ditty for
the popular Andrews Sisters the night before they were to record “One Meat Ball.”
The Sisters put “Rum and Coca-Cola” on the flip side of “One Meat Ball,” and the
rest is clearly history.
Eventually, the record sold nearly seven million copies, making it the third best-sell-
ing record of the 1940s, right behind Bing Crosby’s “White Christmas” and Patti Page’s
“Tennessee Waltz.”
Things didn’t turn out so well for Morey. In 1947, Lord Invader invaded the U.S., having
heard about the song’s success and learning that Amsterdam was taking full credit
for creating it. He brought with him the 70-year-old composer of the melody. They
sued, they won, and, after several trials, the courts awarded them all future royal-
ties, thus sending a very happy composer and lyricist back to Trinidad.
Happy drinkers around the world continued to enjoy “Rum and Coca-Cola” — the
cocktail and the song.

“19”, Royal Oak, and Ten Cane. The latter is rapidly growing in pop-
ularity in the U.S and is made from fresh pressed cane juice.
Virgin Islands
Even though the Virgin Islands are owned by Great Britain and the
United States, rum is made only in the U.S. territory. The molasses-
based spirits, made on column stills, are predominantly light rums.
The Islands’ major distiller, Cruzan, also produces more flavorful
darker rums designed for leisurely sipping. Maybe on a veranda
overlooking the blue, blue waters.
Chapter 12: Yo Ho Ho and a Bottle of Rum 223
The most famous saying about rum: 
“Yo ho ho”
Here’s some more fun with rum. It’s been said and heard many millions of times —
children sing it, movie pirates chant it, people growl it out. Before you read any fur-
ther, where did the saying “yo ho ho” come from? Think you know? No peeking.
The year was 1883, and British writer Robert Louis Stevenson (1850–1894) had just
published his most successful (and most enduring) novel, Treasure Island.It’s regarded
by many as a children’s book, but it deals with many adult situations and questions.
What most people don’t realize is that it’s a story based on a true occurrence — the
fate of the crew on a ship that wrecked on Dead Man’s Chest, a reef close to Tortola.
A contemporary of Stevenson’s, Young E. Allison, was so impressed with Treasure
Island that he wrote an epic poem based on the book. The poem was called
“Derelict,” and it started with the lines:
“Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum.
Drink and the devil had done for the rest.”
In 1901, the poem became a song in a Broadway musical, “Fifteen Men on a Dead
Man’s Chest.”
Six film adaptations of Treasure Island have been released since 1911. Those films
include the following:
 The more recent: Muppet Treasure Island, and an animated film from Japan.
 The most famous: The 1934 MGM blockbuster with Wallace Beery and Jackie
Cooper, followed by the Disney version of 1950 starring Bobby Driscoll and
Robert Newton.
 The strangest: A TV film in 1990 that was produced, directed, and written by
Fraser Clark Heston and starred his father Charlton as Long John Silver.

Other places, other rums
Rum is made in virtually every area where the sugar cane flour-
ishes, including the Philippines, India, South America, Mexico,
Hawaii, and even the U.S. mainland. Yes, some American bottlers
still package rum sent in from other countries and rectifiers (bot-
tlers who buy in bulk right off the still and dilute the distillate to
produce drinkable rum).
Asia
Asian distillers produce white and golden rums made on column
stills for sale primarily in the Philippines and Thailand. India has
begun making rums for its Hindu population (Hindus, unlike
Moslems, drink alcohol beverages).
Australia
The Aussies make their white and golden rums via a double distil-
lation on column and pot stills. The process must be effective: Rum
is the second most popular alcohol beverage in Australia, right
after beer.
Bermuda
Bermuda first made rum to satisfy the demands of sailors and ship
owners who stopped at the island to resupply on their way to the
U.S. Today, Bermuda’s claim to rum fame rests with Gosling’s Black

To your health, Aussie style
When Lachlan Macquarie arrived in Australia in 1819 as governor of New South
Wales (the state in which Sydney is located), he found a town hospital that was
nothing more than a collection of tents.
Macquarie immediately went about remedying the situation, putting aside land for
a new hospital. When the British government refused to fund the building,
Macquarie enlisted a group of local businessmen to build the hospital with convict
labor in exchange for a monopoly on importing 45,000 gallons of rum. When the con-
tractors complained about the price, Macquarie upped their compensation to the
rights to import 60,000 gallons.
Even so, the hospital — completed in 1816 and nicknamed the Rum Hospital —
turned out not to be profitable. Today, the building houses staff for the Sydney mint.
And that definitely makes money.

Label and Gosling’s Gold Label. These pot-stilled spirits are shipped
in bulk to the U.S. for bottling before being shipped back to (where
else?) Bermuda.
Brazil
Brazil’s sugar cane spirit isn’t rum, it’s cachaça (pronounced ca-
cha-cha), a medium-bodied cane-juice product that’s well-suited
for aging. Cachaça is growing in popularity because it serves as a
base for the caipirinha, a Brazilian cocktail made up of sugar, lime
juice, and cachaça.
Canada
The North American northerners have been importing rum for
more than 300 years, ever since sailing merchants first used it to
barter with Atlantic Maritime fishermen for dried fish.
Canadians don’t distill their own rums, but they do take bulk ship-
ments of Caribbean rums (rums shipped in barrels rather than in
bottles), and age the rum onshore for up to five years. This process
produces a spirit known to Nova Scotians as (no kidding) Screech.
Europe
Europe’s climate isn’t friendly to the sugar cane, but its business-
minded distillers are well aware of the profits to be made by aging
and bottling spirits that are shipped to them in bulk.
The French and British ship their finished product primarily to
their current and former colonies. The colony-bereft Germans
bring in heavy Jamaica rum and mix it with neutral spirits (yes,
you can read about neutral spirits in Chapter 2) to make Rum
Verchnitt. The Austrians do pretty much the same.
Guyana
This former Dutch, English, and French colony is on the northern
tip of South America. Its proper name is the Cooperative Republic
of Guyana, and it’s home to Demerara rum, a specific type (as well
as brand) that’s named for the river that runs through the region
where the sugar cane is grown.
The molasses-based, high-alcohol rum is fermented with local
yeasts and produced on pot stills as well as column stills. It starts
out dark and becomes even darker with the addition of caramel.
Despite its dark color, Demerara has a relatively mild flavor
because the base is fermented very quickly (from 36 to 40 hours
rather than over a period of days). This quick fermentation
reduces the incidence of the chemical reactions that produce
esters (flavor ingredients).
Chapter 12: Yo Ho Ho and a Bottle of Rum 225

Even though the flavor is relatively mild, Demerara rums have a
higher alcohol content than most other rums. The product line
includes overproof rums and rums aged for as long as 25 years.
Aged Demerara rum is often blended with lighter Caribbean rums.
An example is Pusser’s Rum, which was named for the purser, the
man who measured out the tots of rum on British Navy ships. (For
more on this topic, see the nearby sidebar “An ounce a day keeps
the mutiny away.”) This blend of Demerara plus rums from Jamaica
and Trinidad was served exclusively on British Navy ships until
1970, when Pusser’s was finally marketed to the public.
United States
No, the U.S. has no sugar cane fields used for making rum. But, as a
relic of earlier times, the U.S. still has bottlers and rectifiers
(people who add water or other ingredients to the distillate) who
process rum shipped into New England in bulk — that is, in the
original casks used for aging. Who knew?
Part III: Surfing the White Waters: A Guide to “Clear” Spirits 
226
An ounce a day keeps the mutiny away
What really made rum so popular? Forget flavor. Forget price. It was the British Royal
Navy.
On long voyages, even the best of the Brits became disruptive from time to time. To
keep order and prevent mutiny, the Brits came up with the tot, an ounce of rum
diluted with several ounces of water, and allowed one per man per day.
Edward Vernon, a British admiral, ruled that the tot should be measured out in full
view of the crew to prevent claims of one sailor’s getting less than another. Vernon
also decreed that the really good guys should get an extra dash of lime juice (the
natural anti-scurvy medicine) plus sugar to make the rum even tastier. It worked.
No more mutinous glares such as the ones Fletcher Christian handed Captain Bligh
aboard the Bounty.
While on duty, Admiral Vernon always wore a coat made of a waterproof fabric
called grogram. To honor his creating the drink-a-day practice, the navvies (Brit
speak for sailors) named the rum/water/lime juice/sugar combo “grog.”
Later, grog also became known as “Nelson’s Blood” in honor of the great British
naval hero — properly Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson, First Viscount Nelson, Duke of
Bronte, KB, RN (1758–1805) — whose body is said to have been preserved in a cask
of rum on its trip back to England after Nelson was killed in the Battle of Trafalgar.

Tasting the World’s Rums
Chapter 3 explains the rules of a spirits tasting. You can skip back
there for the details, or simply follow the simplified procedure here.
Prepping your tasting sheet
Create a tasting sheet so that you can jot down your impressions
as you sample each rum. Table 12-2 shows a typical tasting sheet.

Selecting the rums you 
want to sample
Which rums you choose depends on whether you want to try a
simple beginner’s tasting or a more advanced and adventurous one.
For the beginner’s tasting, the logical plan is to compare a white or
silver un-aged rum, a golden and slightly aged rum, and a reposado
(rum aged for several years). You may also want to add a very old
rum — that is, one aged for as long as 25 years or more.
For a slightly more sophisticated tasting, sample a variety of rum
styles from different parts of the Caribbean. If you’re working with
an especially knowledgeable (or well-stocked) spirits merchant,
you may also want to add rums from other countries, as available.
Chapter 12: Yo Ho Ho and a Bottle of Rum 227

Finally, consider a flavored rum tasting. You can compare several
brands with the same added flavor (say, vanilla) or a variety of brands
with different flavors (say, vanilla versus spices). This is definitely
a tasting that requires a cooperative storeowner, but the rewards
of working together can be dee-li-cious.

Gettin’ to tastin’
Start your engines, sorry, taste your rums. Your first taste should
be plain rum, no mixers. Here’s what you do:
1. Pour about an ounce of rum into your tasting glass.
2. Observe the color.
As with all spirits, the darker the color, the longer the
liquor has been aged.
3. Swirl the glass and watch how quickly the liquid flows
back down the sides.
Slow sliding is another sign of aging.
4. Inhale the aroma.
Part III: Surfing the White Waters: A Guide to “Clear” Spirits 
228

5. Taste the rum.
For plain rums, the predominant flavors are brown sugar,
caramel, leather, molasses, sugar, tobacco, and vanilla.
For flavored rums, the important point is that the flavor
tastes just as the flavor should — vanilla flavored rum
should taste like vanilla; a spiced rum should taste spicy.
And in all cases, they should taste clear and pleasant
rather than heavy or “off.”
Trying the rum with mixers
To get a real feel for the versatility of rum as a spirit, try the same
rums (minus the flavored ones) with mixers other than tap water.
Cola is by far the favorite, but other possibilities include sparkling
bottled water, club soda, lime juice, other citrus juices, and pine-
apple juice or similar not-so-sweet tropical fruit juices.

Cultivating Brandy
In This Chapter

 Appreciating brandy’s worldwide fame
 Deciphering the initials on a Cognac label
 Deciding how to drink your brandy
T
his chapter explores the wide world of brandy, the spirit many
people mistakenly consider to be a wine. It explains why brandy
is the most luxurious spirit and, some say, among the most complex
in flavor as well as production. I also identify the different types of
brandies and lay out standards for tasting and other matters that
make drinking brandy one of the more satisfying rituals in fine dining
(and fine living as well).
Brandy has always been one of the “luxury” spirits in terms of cost,
taste, and general reaction. Brandy snobs may believe that all
brandies are too expensive for a working class individual to pur-
chase. Tell that to the young people in the hip-hop culture and the
jazz buffs before them. Those snobs may consider the working class
the least likely to drink brandy regularly because of the cost, but
today they make up a good percentage of the total brandy market.
Obviously only a handful of individuals can afford to spend $1,200
for a bottle of Remy Martin Louis XIII — or even to purchase a single
drink. But all social boundaries have been broken by the use of fine
brandies in mixed drinks — one of the most popular for years in
many poorer neighborhoods was called “Yak and Coke,” referring
to Cognac and the well known cola, and more recently Hennessy
and orange juice has become popular.
Brandy snobs may mock this trend, but modern brandy makers
don’t. They’ve accommodated their markets by producing out-
standing new brandies in packages that break the stereotypical

brown bottle syndrome. Many outstanding brandies are made in
other lands, and you can try them at moderate prices. And if you
really want that bottle of Louis XIII, you can find it at a discount as
low as $1,150.
The “Champagne” of 
Distilled Spirits
The word brandy comes to English from the Dutch word brandewijn.
The direct translation is burnt wine, which is how the straightforward
Dutch traders described it to potential buyers when introducing their
distinctive alcohol beverage to Northern Europe. They carried it
through France and on to Germany sometime in the 16th century.
Italian vintners often take umbrage at the Dutch claiming credit for
naming this spirit. In Italy, the name brandy is said to be descended
from the Peidmontese word branda. But the Italians may be tread-
ing on thin etymological ice: The Italian-English dictionary at
www.freedict.com defines branda as a folding cot or hammock.
In fact, even the Italians don’t take the argument too seriously
because they prefer their own version of brandy: grappa, a harsher
distillation from the pomace (leftovers) of fruit fermented for brandy.
However, despite discussions about who invented the name, the
following generalizations about brandy are true:
 All brandies are distilled from fruit wines, most commonly
grape wines.
 All brandies are aged in wood, much like whiskeys (although
brandy may be called by different names, such as slivovitz in
Poland, metaxa in Greece, and pisco in Peru).
 All brandies, everywhere, are considered luxury products that
conjure up the world of paneled libraries, fragrant cigars, and
old-fashioned manners.
Where Do Brandies Come From?
Put a map of the world on the wall, toss a dart, and no matter
where it lands, you’ve probably hit a country that makes brandy.
Part IV: Enjoying the “After Dinner” Specials 
234

Yes, the Big Four — France, Spain, Italy, and the United States —
dominate the market, but other places off the beaten brandy path
make some interesting spirits.
France
Although France wasn’t the first nation to make brandy, the French
were the first to make their brandies a must-have in the salons of
France and later the world. French brandy became the distilled
spirit of royalty.
Today, French Cognac and Armagnac are the world’s most regu-
lated brandies, a situation that makes them the most expensive,
long-lasting, and presumably best tasting. Figure 13-1 shows you
where Cognac and Armagnac are located in France. Other French
brandies include Calvados (apple brandy) and a variety of less
serious fruit brandies.

Cognac
The vineyards of Cognac grow Ugni Blanc, Colombard, and Folle
Blanche grapes planted by the Roman Emperor Probus (232–282
CE). The wines made from them were first shipped to Northern
Europe in the 14th century.
By the 16th century the wines were distilled into eaux-de-vie (the
clear spirit that’s called by many other names, including vodka),
and today’s Cognac was born.
The Charentes region and six subdivisions were legally defined
specifically for production of Cognac only. The six subdivisions are
Grande Champagne and Petite Champagne (regarded as the two
finest and mentioned on the label when their eaux-de-vie are used)
as well as Bois Ordinaires, Borderies, Fins Bois, and Bons Bois
(which are all considered lesser subdivisions).
In the 20th century, the Charentes region was recognized world-
wide under agreements with the World Trade Organization. The
agreements decree that if the label says Cognac, the brandy inside
must have been made only in the Charentes region. Every Cognac
brand is made from a blend of eaux-de-vie from various subdivi-
sions during a specific year (read more about blending later in the
chapter).
The designation “Champagne” in the two subdivision names is
believed to arise from the fact that the place where Cognac is made
and the place where the bubbly wine is made share similar terroir
(translation: soil and climate) that produces low alcohol, highly
acidic wines.
Part IV: Enjoying the “After Dinner” Specials 
236
Brandy, Cognac, and Champagne
Regardless of the type or where it’s made, from time to time, aficionados describe
brandy as the Champagne of the distilled spirits family.
Not because it has bubbles — it doesn’t. Not because it’s made from grapes —
even though it is. Not because only the brandy made in Cognac, France, can be
called Cognac, just as only the sparkling wine made in the Champagne region of
France can be called Champagne. Brandy is the Champagne of distilled spirits
simply because brandy — in particular Cognac — takes the most time to produce
and requires the greatest skill to maintain consistency.
This brings up another brandy conundrum. Question: Is it brandy Cognac or is
Cognac brandy? Answer: All Cognac is brandy, but not all brandies are Cognac. Only
brandy made in the Cognac region of France is Cognac. Got it? Good.

Armagnac
The second-ranking French brandy in the world is Armagnac, first
documented and recognized as a brandy in the early 15th century.
It’s made in the Armagnac region of Gascony in Southwestern
France. As with the Charentes region where Cognac is made,
Gascony is divided into several districts: Bas-Armagnac, Haut-
Armagnac, and Tenareze.
Like Cognac, Armagnac is made from Ugni Blanc, Colombard, and
Folle Blanche grape wines. And like Cognac, if the bottle says
Armagnac, the brandy inside must have been made in that region.
So why is Armagnac usually ranked second to Cognac? One reason
is that Armagnac was historically made by local farmers for home
consumption. As a result, the brandy didn’t always have the same
consistency from batch to batch — Cognac did. And it was lacking
a certain sophistication in the flavor.
However, since 1970, the use of portable stills brought by cart to
the local vineyard by itinerant distillers (bouillers de cru) have been
banned by French law, thus leading individual farmers to bring their
goods to stills operated by more sophisticated cooperatives.
As a result, modern Armagnacs are more mellow than their prede-
cessors. The reputation, however, has yet to catch up with the
improved production.
Calvados
This well-loved brandy is made from Normandy’s tart apples simi-
lar to American crab apples. Calvados comes from several regu-
lated appellations. Contrôlée Pays d’Auge near Deauville is the top
grade, followed by ten nearby districts called Appellation
Reglementee.
All Calvados are aged a minimum of two years and have the same
alcohol content. Although most brands carry an aging statement,
unlike Cognacs, they’re not legally bound to do so.
Eaux-de-vie (fruit brandies)
Fruit growing regions along the upper Rhine River produce what
are generally considered the best brandy distillates (eaux-de-vie)
in Europe.
In France, the Alsace region is well-known for berry brandies (par-
ticularly strawberry and raspberry), cherry brandies, and pear
brandies (poire).
Chapter 13: Cultivating Brandy 237

Many mass produced brandies simply labeled French Brandy are
exported throughout the world. All are made on continuous stills,
aged for an unregulated period of time in oak casks, and labeled
with designations that have no meaning under French regulations.
These brandies, sometimes blended with grape juice, wines, oak
flavoring, and other brandies (including some Cognac), aren’t
unacceptable, but often the prices are obscenely high for what
they are, so watch out for that.
Part IV: Enjoying the “After Dinner” Specials 
238
Talking Cognac and Armagnac
The most often asked questions about Cognac have nothing to do with the brandy
itself. The questions, instead, are about the label. What in the world do all those
designations mean?
The labels tell you how old the Cognac inside really is, as dictated by the very strict
French laws governing such things. And you don’t even have to know how to speak
French. Just follow this handy guide:
 A.C.: Two years old. Aged in wood
 V.O., Very Old: Aged a minimum of four years
 V.S., Very Special: Three years of aging in wooden casks. Very often called
Three Star
 V.S.O.P., Very Superior Old Pale: Minimum aging is eight years in wood for the
youngest in the blend. Industry average is between 10 and 15 years old, which
is why it’s sometimes known as Five Star
 X. O., Extra Old: Also called Luxury. Has a minimum age of eight years. This class
also can include Napoleon and Vielle (“Reserve”)
 Napoleon/Extra/Vielle Reserve: Napoleon had nothing to do with it, except to
order this type of Cognac. At least four years old, but generally much older than
that
 Varietal: Made using only one type of varietal grape
 Vintage: Aged and was put into the bottle in the year of the vintage
 Hors d’Age: Too old to figure out the age. A true gem
Surprising consumer note: Armagnac is blended with older vintages than similarly
labeled Cognacs. Hence, a V.S.O.P. Armagnac could be considered a better value
than a similarly aged Cognac.

Spain
Quick now, globally, where do the most popular brandies in the
world come from? Chances are you said France. You’d be wrong.
It’s Spain, where the whole idea of differing spirits was born and
where those spirits were sent to all the nations around the world
conquered by the force of Spanish arms. Because of this, the world
has a lot more Spanish-speaking people than French-speakers. And
the Spanish-speakers in the many heavily populated parts of the
world are culturally used to brandy.
The best known type of brandy is produced in a unique way. It uses
the same system for aging, called solera, as port and the same
grapes, from Jerez, used in making sherry. (This aging method is
discussed in an upcoming sidebar.)
Spanish and French distillers use the same varietal white grapes
for making their brandies, proving that sometimes great good
grows out of disaster. In the late 19th century, Phylloxera, a grape-
vine destroying aphid, virtually destroyed almost all the carefully
tended grapevines in France. The Spanish vintners found some root
stock for Ugni Blanc — the most important grape used in making
brandy. That root stock hadn’t been infected, so the Spanish helped
their colleagues in France by sending the stock north.
Italy
Because the Italians are the third largest winemakers in the world,
they don’t particularly like to mess with brandies. The exception
was introducing their Trebbiano grape to the rest of Europe,
which, it turns out, is the same grape as the Ugni Blanc.
However, most of their wine brandies are made on column stills,
which naturally makes them lighter and less complex. So, they find
it hard to compete with the more artisanal types of French and
Spanish brandies.
But the Italians do make and sell a lot of grappa on the world
market. They make two types: the first is relatively raw, aged only
long enough to smooth it out without changing the just-made
flavor; the second is an expensive grappa made from a single grape
varietal, aged for a longer period of time, and usually comes in a
very fancy bottle.
Chapter 13: Cultivating Brandy 239

United States
Before Prohibition, brandy was a big item for California wineries,
dating back to 18th-century Spanish missionaries who introduced
winemaking to the region. It became such an important item in
world trade that for a time Leland Stanford (yes, the University
endower) was the leading brandy producer in the world.
The triple bogey of Phylloxera, Prohibition, and the Plague of
Worldwide War virtually destroyed the brandy business in the
United States. With the help of expert vintners at the University

The solera aging method
The distillers of the Iberian Peninsula had a jump on all those in other European
countries. Distillation came to Europe and the rest of the world from North Africa
when the Moors of that region conquered most of Spain. The Moors taught the
peninsula dwellers about their alchemic arts, including how to turn fermented fruit
into alcohol.
Initially brandy, much as other alcohol beverage types, was considered a medicine
and a casual accompaniment for religious and celebratory occasions. Few vintners
cared that their products tasted the same year after year. This meant that the pro-
ducer of brandy might lose a customer the following year because his beverage
didn’t taste the same.
The Spaniards and Portuguese found a way to offset this commercial problem by
aging their spirits using the solera method. The name solera either comes from the
word suelo, meaning ground or land, or solar, meaning the tradition that holds fam-
ilies together (“solidarity” in English).
In this system, a series of oak barrels are placed in tiers sometimes ten barrels high.
The bottom tier is called the solera. On top of that, the barrels range in age with the
youngest (called criadaras) at the top.
The first wine removed from the tier is the bottom row, which is replaced by those
on the next tier up. The solera barrels are used to fill the top tier barrels, which had
been left half empty. This goes on continually.
Wine isn’t allowed to be siphoned from one tier to the next one down, and by law,
no more than one-third of a barrel can be removed at a time.
The reason for all this up-and-down? The infusion of older wines can “tame” the
younger wines by taking away some of their original harshness. Removing the wine
from the bottom barrel into a sealed container also allows it to “breathe” for a while
in the open air.
Does it work? That’s for your taste to decide.

of California–Davis, a California-style brandy was created. It was
made on continuous stills, aged from 2 to 12 years in oak, and had
a light uncomplicated flavor thanks to the table grape varieties
(including Thompson seedless) that were used.
However, as the industry matured, some vintners started making
their brandies from the traditional French white varietal grapes.
They arrived at a brandy style ideal for drink making because of
its clean taste. Like American tastes in wine, the California-style
brandies have found wide acceptance in the mass global market.
Another brandy gaining popularity is Slivovitz, made in Oregon
and California from a black plum (called Mirabelle in France).
Another recent entry into the category is a number of brandies,
including grappa, that are made from New York state fruits. Most
are bottled in slender, very modern looking bottles at 80 proof (40
percent ABV). These brandies are beginning to get some serious
attention, particularly from restaurant owners and those who like
to try the latest “new thing.”
Probably the oldest spirit made in the U.S. isn’t from California,
which wasn’t even thought of in 1780 when Laird’s was founded in
New Jersey and issued distillery license #1 (see the nearby sidebar
for more information).
Other places, other brandies
Brandy is produced in plenty of places around the world. You may
not find the products listed in this section at your local tavern, but
they may be worth trying when traveling in the vicinity of the pro-
ducing country. You may even consider stopping at an airport
duty-free shop on the way home.
Australia
Aussies aren’t much for drinking brandy, but so much wine is avail-
able that it would be foolish not to use the excess for brandy. The
spirit of the grape from Oz is generally light and on the lower alco-
hol side — sort of like California-style brandy. It’s good for the
money, particularly in cocktail making.
Black Sea region
Georgia and Armenia both make good brandies, including some for
export. Drawing on their early teaching by monks, the brandies are
intensely flavored using local grapes along with imported grapes,
such as French Muscadine and Sercial and Verdelho from Madeira.
Chapter 13: Cultivating Brandy 241

Eastern Europe
The best-known plum brandy is Slivovitz, which is made through-
out the region of the Balkans and Eastern Europe and now in the
United States. Several brands are available in many countries.
Among them is Manastirka (“from the monastery”), a double dis-
tilled brandy made in Serbia from a black plum called Madjarka.
It’s aged for a minimum of ten years.
Germany
Using the German word weinbrand, German distillers have been
making brandy since the 14th century (they formed their distillers’
guild in 1588), primarily using imported wines.

U.S. Distillery License #1
When William Laird from Scotland’s County Fyfe landed in the New World in 1698,
he had no idea that he would establish a family dynasty that would introduce a
unique product that’s still popular more than 300 years later.
William was a farmer who had a knowledge of distilling. He was looking around for
a farm to develop in the new land of New Jersey, and he saw an abundance of apple
trees. “Eureka” (or the Scottish equivalent), he said: The apples would be easy to
distill into apple brandy, and so he did.
It’s estimated that his first sale of Laird’s Apple Brandy came in 1770 or thereabouts,
but the first record of a sale was found in an operations account book maintained
by his son Robert, who ran the Colts Neck Inn, in 1777. It recorded a sale at the price
of “four shillings, six pence per gallon of cyder spirits.” Later to be called Apple
Jack.
Robert joined General Washington in the fight to establish a new nation and also
played host to the army. He even found time to make the big boss feel better by
sending him a requested recipe for cider along with some to drink.
When the new republic began licensing the production of alcohol beverages, Laird’s
was granted Distillery License #1, and they remained in their Scobeyville, New
Jersey, location from then on. Laird’s became the “oldest native distilled beverage
in the United States,” according to a state legislature proclamation of 1980.
Even during Prohibition, Laird’s was given a special recognition and was permitted
to continue distilling and selling apple brandy for medicinal purposes only. They also
made nonalcohol sweet cider and applesauce.
The company is still prospering today under the guidance of William’s descendants.
Proving once again, quality and persistence pay off.

Today, most German brandies are made on pot stills and aged for a
minimum of six months. Those aged longer are identified as uralt,
which means older. The best of them resemble Cognac, only lighter
and with a sweeter finish.
Greece
The Greeks make a lot of brandies, the most globally famous of
which is Metaxa. It’s a wine with the herbal flavoring of a liqueur
that’s distilled two times, qualifying it as a brandy. The number of
stars on the label indicate the age (*** = 3 years old).
Another popular Greek spirit is Ouzo, which is similar to Absinthe.
It’s a brandy-based wine flavored with anise that turns milky white
when water is added.
Israel
Winemaking in Israel is as old as The Bible, but brandy only began
in the 1880s when Baron Edmond de Rothschild established the
modern Israeli wine industry. The brandies are made in the French
style, similar to Cognac.
Latin America
Because the Spanish were the first Europeans to open trade with
Latin America, brandy was introduced to the area in the 16th cen-
tury. It wasn’t generally taken to by the populations, except for
those in Mexico. There, nearly all the wine made from Mexican-
grown seedless Thompson, Ugni Blanc, and Palomino grapes is
used for the production of brandy. And brandy is the most 
popular spirit in the country, beating out Tequila and rum.
Other than that, almost all other brandies in Latin America are
made strictly for domestic consumption. The exception is the
Andean region’s Pisco, made primarily in Chile and Peru from
Muscat grapes. Pisco has a light, slightly sweet flavor that makes 
it ideal for cocktail mixing, especially in the popular Pisco Sour.
South Africa
Brandy production started in South Africa in the 17th century with
the arrival of the Dutch, but the spirit was so rough that it was
called witbits (white lightning). Modern brandies, first produced in
the 20th century, are made from the standard grape varieties plus
Palomino grapes. Aging for a minimum of three years makes them
far tamer than the original entries.
Chapter 13: Cultivating Brandy 243

Brandy by Type
Regardless of where they’re made, all brandies fall — more or less
comfortably — into one of these three broad general classifications:
 Wine brandy
 Fruit brandy
 Pomace brandy
And just to complicate things a bit, some are known as fine brandies,
while others, made with a different distilling method are called
mass produced. Both methods are explained later, in the section
“Distilling Brandies.”
Wine brandies
Wine brandies, distilled from fruit wines, are the brandies that are
most commonly available. They’re the ones the average consumer
is most likely to have tasted. More often than not, the wine from
which the brandy is distilled was made from grapes, but, in fact,
virtually every fruit wine — including oddities such as kiwi or pome-
granate — has been used somewhere, by someone, to make brandy.
Fruit brandies
Fruit brandies aren’t distilled from fruit wines; they’re made by
macerating (soaking) actual fruit, such as apples, in small amounts
of high alcohol distillates to extract the flavor of the fruit. The newly-
flavored alcohol is then used to produce the brandy.
Because fruit brandies are most commonly made from locally
grown fruits that ferment easily, they aren’t very expensive. As a
result, they’re very popular. Two well-known (and popular) fruit
brandies (both made from apples) are Calvados and Apple Jack. 
As you can tell from the names, the first was born in France, the
second in the United States.
Pomace brandies
When winemakers press the juice of fruit to make wine, what’s left
is pomace: skins, stems, seeds, and leaves. Not being folks who like
to waste anything, winemakers put this aside to use for distilling
(what else?) pomace brandies, high-proof spirits bottled with mini-
mal (if any) aging.
Part IV: Enjoying the “After Dinner” Specials 
244

The best-known and most popular of the pomace brandies is
grappa, named for the Italian town Bassano del Grappa in the
Veneto where it was first produced. Another Italian name for
pomace brandy is bagaceira.
Other countries have still different names for their pomace brandies:
 Aguardiente or ourip (Spain)
 Alcool blance, eau-de-vie, or marc (France)
 Dop (the Netherlands)
 Testerschnapps (Germany)
Whatever they call it, though, it’s definitely a brandy.
Distilling Brandies
The distillation of brandy is similar to the distillation of all other
spirits. For the complete process, check Chapter 2. For the particu-
lars on brandy, read on.
Choosing a base
The base for distilling brandy is a fermentable liquid, most com-
monly wine made from the traditional white varietal grapes.
However, virtually any plant or vegetable product containing
sugars may be used. From soft fruits, such as berries, to sugar
cane, honey, rice, milk, grains, and tubers (yes, potatoes too).
During World War II, Londoners who really must have wanted their
brandy, made wine out of cabbage leaves and carrot peels. They
then distilled what must have been strangely flavored wines, and
made equally strangely flavored brandies. And to be clear: There is
no record of Winston Churchill, patriot that he may have been,
ever dunking his cigar into a glass of cabbage brandy.
Bringing out the spirit
The initial step in brandy production is to allow the base to fer-
ment in a large vat for about five days as the sugars are converted
to alcohol. As a rule, white grape wines usually ferment to about 10
percent alcohol content.
Chapter 13: Cultivating Brandy 245

As in other distillations, the fermented liquid is pumped through a
series of filters into either a pot still or a continuous (column) still.
It’s then heated to boiling so that the alcohol (which boils at a lower
temperature than water) rises to be captured and condensed into a
liquid that’s about 52 to 64 proof (26 to 32 percent ABV).
A second distillation, which the French call la bonne chauffe, pro-
duces a liquid that’s about 72 proof (36 percent ABV).
When distilling other spirit types, such as whiskey, distillers strive
to produce a distillate free of most flavors and aromas. Not so with
brandy. Here, distillers prefer to hold as much flavor in the distil-
late as possible in order to qualify it as brandy.
Aging
Having reached a recommended level of alcohol, the brandy is then
pumped from the still into wooden casks/barrels (generally oak).
There, it rests for anywhere from 2 to more than 50 years, absorb-
ing flavor from the casks themselves and losing about 1 percent of
its alcohol a year through evaporation (called “the angel’s share”).
Even though they’re made from fruit wine, brandies don’t get mel-
lower with age after they’re bottled. The time in the barrel is what
counts here. When you take into account that percentage of alcohol
that’s lost while the brandy is in those barrels, you can understand
why connoisseurs relish a well-aged brandy. It has less alcohol but
a more pronounced fruit flavor.
Part IV: Enjoying the “After Dinner” Specials

Berry good, thank you
Every kind of fruit (except grapes) falls into the fruit brandy category. Not “fruit-fla-
vored,” which is another thing entirely. How come? Simple. Fruit-flavored brandies
are actually cordials to which sugar must be added to differentiate them from true
brandies. True brandies are sugary enough naturally. And grapes contain the most
sugar of any fruit used for distillation.
To make a fruit brandy, the fruit is first crushed, and then macerated (soaked) in a
high-proof spirit. The blended extract is then removed and distilled once at a low
proof. In this way, the flavor is preserved as fresh and natural.

Material that was filtered out of the wine before distillation is com-
pacted to concentrate the remaining juice. The entire mass is dis-
tilled again to make pomace brandy, which retains the taste of the
original wine used. While the other brandy types are then aged,
pomace brandies are filtered again and bottled to preserve that
original wine flavor, which can be lowered or even lost entirely
when aged in wood.
Blending
A fine brandy such as Cognac is actually a blend of various
Cognacs from various sections of the appellation district and aged
a varying length of time.
Before removal from the barrel and before bottling, distilled water
may be added to the oldest of the brandies. This addition keeps
the alcohol at around 80 proof (40 percent ABV). Sugar and caramel
may also be added to make the color of the brandy consistent from
year to year.
Chapter 13: Cultivating Brandy 247
How did that great big pear get 
into the little bottle?
One of the more unusual brandies is poire, made mostly in Austria and Switzerland.
It’s set apart from other fruit brandies because, instead of merely the fruit essence,
it actually has a fully ripe pear in every bottle. The pear is macerating in the pear
brandy.
Many people buy a bottle of poire not for the taste — which is terrific if you like
pears, and who doesn’t? — but to keep on the mantle for guests to marvel at and
ask, as practically everyone does, “How do they get the pear into the bottle?”
Easy: First the brandy-making fruit farmer culls through his pear trees — Anjou
pears for Poire William, the best-selling brand — to find one or more with pears
that have ripened just to the size of a grape. He gently manipulates the branch, with
the pear still growing on it, into a brandy bottle.
Then he waits until the pear is mature, cuts away the branch, washes the pear
(inside the bottle), and fills the bottle with pear brandy.
Voila, as the French might say — a big pear in a little bottle.

Tasting Brandy
Tasting is tasting.
The instructions on how to structure a tasting in Chapter 3 are as
valid for brandy as for any other spirit.
Of course, I do have some special adaptations. Right here. Read on.
But first, create your tasting sheet by copying this sample in Table
13-1 or drawing up your own.
Then read on.

Tasting by type
If you’re tasting by type, just follow these steps:
1. Decide which type of brandy you wish to taste.
2. Consult your favorite liquor store.
3. Choose two or three brands.
4. Taste.
Part IV: Enjoying the “After Dinner” Specials 
248

Most experts recommend beginning with the French Big Two,
Cognac and Armagnac. Just pick some bottles with the appropriate
type on the label. If they’re all from France, French law makes sure
that you’re getting the proper spirit.
Comparing Calvados with an American apple brandy such as Laird’s
is a more interesting experiment in the effects of geography and
culture on brandy.
Pomace brandies are an acquired taste, but if you sample two or
three, you may soon be able to distinguish different flavor notes in
brandies from different countries.
Tasting by country
Another way to taste brandies is to pick out an entry from several
countries and taste them all at one sitting (around the world on
brandy).
Use Spanish brandy as your baseline, and then move on to those
non-solera method aged brandies from California, noting the differ-
ences in flavor and aroma. Table 13-2 is full of selected examples
for this kind of tasting.
Table 13-2
Selected Examples of Brandies 
from Different Countries
Country
Brand-name Brandies
Armenia
One of the earliest brandy producing regions. Their best-
known brand-name is Ararat, which is currently being made
and distributed by Israel’s Carmel Wines because of the
problematic political situation in Armenia.
Australia
Virtually any reputable wine producer, such as Penfold’s,
makes a brandy or two as well as their usually well made
wines. The problem is getting them. Because the wineries
make so little brandy, most of it is consumed domestically.
Germany
One of the best-known modern German brandies is the well
known Asbach Uralt. It has a robust but very smooth taste
because of its cask aging (uralt means old) and French-
style blending.

Country
Brand-name Brandies
Israel
Winemaking in Israel is as old as, or older than, The Bible.
But French interests subsidized the making of kosher
brandy in the mid-19th century. Initially on the sweet side,
today the brandies, such as Yarden and Carmel, are based
on the French model and have found a non-kosher audience
as well.
Mexico
Mexicans vote with their money when it comes to selecting
a brandy. Among the many brands offered in the country is
their number-one favorite, Presidente, which is also the
best-selling brandy in the world. It’s made in the Spanish
style, and a solera-aged version is available too.
Peru
Peru and Chile have been actively battling in the courts for
decades about where Pisco originated. Until the argument
is settled, let’s just say it’s an Andean region style of brandy
that’s very popular. Now generally available anywhere in
the world is Capel Pisco.
Tasting by price
Price comparisons are probably the worst way to select brandies
for tasting. Unlike some other beverage types, brandy isn’t terribly
susceptible to wildly changing prices.
Rule of thumb? The older a brandy, the higher the price. Why?
Because the distiller has to recoup the investment he made while
the brandy sat quietly mellowing in his cellar.
Obviously then, a 50-year Cognac is exponentially more costly than
a virtual baby of only four years. But some people prefer the lighter
(younger) brandies — even if they aren’t the ones legends are built
around.
You won’t know until you try.
What you taste (and smell) 
when you sniff and sip
Table 13-3 tells you all about the flavors and aromas of the various
types of brandy. Incidentally, when you’re talking about how 
spirit affects your nose, use the word aroma rather than smell — 
particularly with an upscale product like brandy. And when you’re

discussing how it affects your palate, it’s always more sophisticated
to say flavor, referring to the sensual experience, rather than taste,
which makes it sound like a Twinkie (“My, that tastes good.”).

Serving Brandy: Neat or Mixed?
Warm or Cool?
What’s so great about drinking brandy? Here’s what Samuel Johnson
(1709–1784), the eminent British writer and philosopher, had to say:
“Claret is the liquor for boys, port for men, but he who aspires
to be a hero must drink brandy.”
Brandy works as an aperitif, as a cooler mixed with club soda, or,
in the traditional fashion: sipped in the drawing room as a substi-
tute for a really rich dessert.
Brandy should never be frozen. The flavor is too delicate to take
much ice, which is not to say that it has to be heated. Room tem-
perature is usually the right serving temperature. If someone wants
it chilled, drop in an ice cube or two. Let the aroma out before
drinking by letting the bottle stand open for a few minutes before
you start.
The final decision about the tasting is how to serve the brandy.
Some brandies are light enough and designed to be mixed with a
lot of other things, including colas. Other brandies turn up their
noses (and yours) against diluting their wonderful aged taste with
some upstart soft drink or even fresh fruit juice.
Chapter 13: Cultivating Brandy 251

The top brandies are the product of centuries of experience and
years of skilled work. The Cognac producers are highly honored in
France for their endeavors. The recommendation of all those who
appreciate the top of the spirits line is not to mix Cognac with any-
thing, but to save it for after the meal. Drinking good aged brandy,
seated in front of a roaring fire on a chilly winter’s eve following a
hearty meal while smoking a great cigar is a cliché, but it’s also
something that everyone should try at least once.
Modern brandy drinkers, however, accept the idea that a lighter,
California-style brandy makes the perfect base for fruit or fruit-
flavored cocktails. Examples of brandy in cocktails are the Brandy
Alexander or brandy as a substitute for Bourbon in a Mint Julep.
(See the classic drink recipes in Chapter 15).
For more brandy cocktails, check out the master source:
Bartending For Dummies, 3rd Edition, by Ray Foley (Wiley).
Pairing Brandy and Food
Brandy’s richness goes well with lush, high-fat, fully flavored foods
such as
 Pate de fois gras
 Roast meats and poultry (duck, goose, beef, lamb, venison)
 Whole milk cheeses
 Whole milk desserts (ice cream, crème caramel)
 Rich egg desserts (zabaglione)
 Dense, moist cakes (fruit cake, pound cake)
Brandy is also a welcome ingredient in an elegant sauce with pep-
percorns for duck à l’orange or steak. Or you can simply add a little
to your French onion soup, pour it over vanilla ice cream, or stir it
into your coffee. Sometimes, as architect Frank Lloyd Wright said,
“Less is more.”
Flambé — with care
Who enjoys the theatrical moment of a dessert or a cocktail that
bursts into brilliant flame right before his very eyes? Everyone.
Who totally hates to see the napkins go up in flames along with the
dessert or drink? Everyone.
Part IV: Enjoying the “After Dinner” Specials 
252

Flambé is an art not to be practiced by the unschooled. Profes-
sionals prevent conflagrations simply by remembering that every
80 proof (40 percent ABV) brandy burns easily at room temperature.
So first they chill the bottle, and then they pour the brandy into a
heated spoon or ladle over the serving bowl or glass, dropping 
a sugar cube in the brandy to serve as a “wick” for the flame.
Then they light the thing . . . very carefully, at a safe distance from
the drinker or diner.
If you’re moved to try this, don’t. Not without a really good lesson
from a really good teacher. That’s my fire prevention lesson for the
week.

Winston and brandy: A classic twosome
One of the truly great men of the 20th century, Winston Leonard Spenser Churchill
(1874–1965) served as Prime Minister of England during World War II. Even in times
of deepest crisis, he never missed his brandy and cigars.
Every evening Churchill took the time for a good cigar and a good glass of Cognac
(he preferred Hine). So seriously did he enjoy these nowadays guilty pleasures that
legend credits him with the notion of dipping a cigar into the brandy to give the cigar
a special richer flavor.
Not that Sir Winston invented the ritual of cigars-and-brandy for the guys after
dinner. Credit for that generally goes to the Prince of Wales who became King
Edward VII, and who drove his mother Queen Victoria to distraction because she
hated smoking.
The ritual has changed a lot since then. Today, where smoking is permitted (Sir
Winston would surely wince at that!), the ladies are likely to light up alongside the
gents as all lift their brandy glasses to toast one of those moments that makes life
just a little better.

Lining Up Liqueurs
In This Chapter
 The sweet side of alcohol
 How an alcohol beverage started as a medicine and ended up a dessert
 The difference between generic and proprietary
 Choosing what to taste among hundreds of types
I
n the 12th century came the discovery by alchemists of how to
bring out the essence of agricultural products to create al-kohl,
the medieval cure-all.
Next came teaching others the many ways to make and use this
remarkable “water of life.” It took about 800 years from the discov-
ery of distillation in the 9th century until monks in France learned
how valuable the sweet-tasting, health-giving benefits could be in
saving lives if they added flavors to alcohol.
So were born liqueurs in the form of two that taste so good they
remain popular to this very day: Chartreuse and Benedictine. Both
were named in honor of the monastic orders where they were first
created.
The further development of the most complex, colorful, tasteful,
and varied of all distilled spirit types has blossomed (like many of
the plants and flowers used in their production) since the 1600s.
These new products used combinations of so-called neutral spirits
(clear with little or no flavor) made from grain or wine or other
agricultural products with (or over) fruits, flowers, plants, their
juices, or other flavoring materials. And the monks used various
means to bring out the best of their flavors in a controlled and
standardized manner.

They turned these early pharmaceuticals into a tremendous vari-
ety of colorful, different-flavored, spirit products. And that led to
the huge industry known and enjoyed all over the world today as
cordials or liqueurs. The popularity of cordials has never dimmed;
popularity that lasts for 400 years must mean something. In the case
of these beauties, it means variety, reasonably low cost, generally
lower alcohol, and great use in drinks and in cooking.
The Birth of the Liqueur
Many historians attribute the first compounding of sweetened
herbs and alcohol to Italy’s Salerno University of Medicine and
Science. The art of turning medicine-taking from “ugh” to “wow!”
was ultimately obtained by Catherine de Medici, who was a member
of one of Italy’s ruling classes (and also one of the world’s great
poisoners). In 1536, she introduced her new husband, King Henry II
of France, and his French court to what is today called a cocktail.
The Rossoli was a varied mixture of everything from jasmine leaves
to chamomile and sugar steeped in alcohol by Italian peasants to
ward off “the Death” (the superstitious peasantry’s term for the
Bubonic Plague).
In very short time, this “medicine” became a favorite of the French
aristocracy. They most likely appreciated the mood altering capa-
bilities more than they did the effectiveness in warding off the
plague and other death-dealing ailments.
During the Renaissance, the practice of adding alcohol to well-
known medications became far more prevalent among the elite.
Many upper-class households had a dedicated “still room” for
making distilled spirits to be used in cosmetics as well as for 
drinking. Women of the house used the same distillation methods
to make rosewater to improve complexions, and water of ground
up cloves to relieve stomachache, obesity, and worms.
Further proof of the Italian origin of these remarkable variations on
an ancient theme arrived in London in 1749 in the person of Giacomo
Justerini. He brought with him a number of complex recipes for
making liqueurs. Signore Justerini’s name and his “apothecary” shop
have lived on. So has his partnership with Alfred Brooks, which made
J&B Scotch whisky a household name among the British Royal family
and today’s more moderate drinkers as well.
While people in many countries were creating more types of
medicinal liqueurs, innovative distillation was growing on a 
parallel track. It didn’t take too long for the two to join hands.
Part IV: Enjoying the “After Dinner” Specials 
256

The monks were the first to realize the potential benefits of adding
aqua vitae to a distillate of herbs, leaves, or even plant roots. They
quickly started using the new method to get patients to take their
medicine. In the 16th and 17th centuries, hundreds of concoctions
were born (naturally including “love” potions). In 1510, Benedictine
monk Dom Vincelli created the still-used recipe for Benedictine
Liqueur. Only in more recent times has scientific progress discovered
the chemical agents that made those homely plants and flowers a
preventive for heart attacks. Now they can be put into a simple pill
or capsule, eliminating the original bad taste as well as the alcohol.
Only in the last generation have the facts been learned about how
the healthful effects of these botanicals continue to operate even
in an alcohol base.
Today virtually hundreds of cordials/liqueurs use fruits and other
ingredients to add flavors undreamed of by the Moor Jabir, the
world’s first distiller. Modern liqueurs are the biggest category of
all spirits if you look at the number of brands, and it’s the third
best-selling category worldwide. Not surprising considering that
cordials come at a far lower cost than other, more heavily taxed
types of spirit.
The first “medicines”
Prior to World War I, the only “medicines” available were first con-
cocted as far back as prehistoric times by using plants and herbs
found in local regions. If you’re watching all the ads on TV today,
that’s hard to believe. But back then, botanicals were ground up
and water was added, and then, often over much protestation, they
were administered — foul tasting or not. The “medicine man” could
always blame the water — and he would generally be correct.
These initial attempts to provide sick people with some relief
through the wonders of chemistry may have worked, sort of, but
they were rarely taken as prescribed and they certainly weren’t
enjoyed.
As tastes grew more sophisticated to the point where meat was
cooked before eating, the flavor of these locally produced medicines
didn’t sit so well with the masses. They blamed the “doctors” for not
making the medicines more effective.
Then came the discovery of honey, and later, sugar cane (see
Chapter 12). Medicine men quickly realized that, as Mary Poppins
sang many centuries later, “a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine
go down.” In a desire to make their medicines more effective, the
pharmacists of the day added a little sweetness by adding honey,
dates, figs, or the ground up sugar cane to make their medical
selections more palatable.
Chapter 14: Collecting Cordials, Lining Up Liqueurs 257

When they mixed the powders with alcohol instead of water —
wow! — the difference in their patients’ moods and attitudes were
markedly less hostile.
Cordial? Liqueur? A tale 
of two words
Before I go any further, you should know that the words cordial
and liqueur refer to the same alcohol beverage type. The only dif-
ference is that cordial is more common in the United States, while
the Frenchification of the word liquor into liqueur belongs to the
Europeans.
Interestingly, both words have Latin roots. Cordial is from the Latin
word cor, which means heart in English. Liqueur is taken from the
English word liquefaction, which in turn is from the same word in
Latin that means the process of liquification, and that’s particularly
apt when applied to creating a liqueur made from ground up gin-
seng roots, for example.
The United States Standards of Identity originally gave the cate-
gory the designation of cordial. But liqueur has a more upscale
tone to it, so it became more common throughout the world.
According to every standard of identification worldwide, cordials
and liqueurs are made by “mixing or redistilling distilled spirits
with, or over, fruits, flowers, plants or [their] pure juices, or other
natural flavoring materials or with extracts derived from infusions,
percolation, or maceration.” They must contain sugar, dextrose, or
levulose not less than 2.5 percent by weight of the finished product.
A host of other controls factor into production, and are shown on
the label. Examples include the use of imitation flavors, the type of
spirit used as a base, and so on.
Cordially Yours: The Making
Cordials have a wide spectrum of flavors available from the poten-
tial basic flavoring ingredients. So, the tastes offered depend to a
large extent on the experience and skill of the distiller, the ways in
which the flavors are obtained, and the exact formulation of ingre-
dients. Making cordials is a skill and an art. It requires a wide
knowledge of the earth’s plants, flowers, fruits, herbs, vegetables,
and almost every other botanical product found even in the most
remote parts of the world.

As an example or two, consider the recent introduction of a pome-
granate cordial — a fruit mentioned lovingly in the Bible — or the
awareness of the fruit of an African tree, the marula. It was reborn
as a cordial called Amarula, which has a delightful taste when per-
colated into an unflavored spirit.
When someone goes to make a cordial, he or she takes this very
complex knowledge and puts it to use in basically the same way
that other distillers use their knowledge to create other spirit types.
Liqueurs are made by using many types of spirits for a base, ranging
from grain neutral spirits through brandy and rum and surprisingly
even to already-juniper-berry-flavored gin. To the base spirit, the
distiller adds the flavoring agents compiled from his secret recipe
and then mixes with care and attention.
Choosing the base spirit
Distillers select the base spirit of a cordial on the basis of flavor,
availability, and blending potential with the prime flavoring agent.
Each different spirit has a distinctive taste. Will the earthy notes of
Tequila go well with a scented flower? Alternatively, can the juniper-
laden gin blend in with a pomegranate flavor? Or, can a sweet
sugary rum match up with a sweet herb?
Economic choices are also involved. If brandy is the base, it doesn’t
make economic sense to use a vintage Cognac. Or does it? Should a
vodka made from low cost wheat or corn be used, or should the
more exotic vodkas from grapes make the flavor base?
Finally, a decision must be made on how high the final price of the
liqueur should be — value priced, premium, super-premium? That
too has a definite effect on how much the distiller pays for all the
ingredients.
Marking the differences
Years ago, the trade agreed that in order to keep order in the mar-
ketplace, various price ranges designating the quality level of the
liqueur inside should be set and given names. In a bow to the
French, they were Ordinair for the lowest quality, up the ladder
through Demi-fine to Fine, and ultimately to the top, Surfine. In
these days of global marketing, you rarely see these designations,
but they’re in the pricing if not on the label.
To further assist the consumer, however, all liqueurs are still classi-
fied as Crème when they’re thick and extra sweet; Balm, which has
a thick consistency; or Water, Extract, or Elixir, which are all lighter.
Chapter 14: Collecting Cordials, Lining Up Liqueurs 259

Today, liqueurs are also classified by the flavor type. Most confus-
ing of these are Crème and Cream. The first is a category generally
indicating a single flavoring agent, such as crème de cacao, which
is a sweeter, more heavily sugared liqueur with a cocoa flavor. Cream,
as in Bailey’s Irish Cream, is a category that came into being in the
1980s. These liqueurs are made by using a technology invented in
Holland to stabilize dairy cream and give it a shelf life of about two
months without refrigeration. Cream liqueurs are blends, usually of
a whiskey and fresh stabilized dairy cream. You can also find rum
creams and even an Amarula cream. The most common flavorings
come from chocolate, mint, and coffee. The best part of these
dessert liqueurs is that they last for a long time and still taste fresh.
But shelf life isn’t much of a worry in your refrigerator — the drinks
are so delicious that they don’t generally last two months.
Generic liqueurs are usually classified as non-descriptive Liqueurs.
This class includes Sloe Gin, which is made from sloe berries on a
neutral spirit base.
Another category of liqueurs are Fruit Brandies, which are a color-
less neutral brandy base to which a blending of similar fruit flavors
have been added. The use of flavored brandy most likely arose
years ago in the Cognac region of France where flavored Cognac
was often a preferred way to drink their native classic. Alizè is a 
flavored Cognac and therefore classified as a liqueur.
Finally, you have Schnapps, which is similar to a flavored eaux-de-
vie (the French version of vodka) but with no added sugar. In the
United States, even schnapps must adhere to the requirement that
all cordials have a given percentage of sugar added.
Adding the flavor
Having determined the spirit to use as a base, the next step in
making a liqueur is determining how to get the flavor into the 
finished product.
The most common methods for extracting flavor from a botanical
include the following:
 Maceration: The flavoring agents for the recipes are soaked in
the spirit and agitated. When the maximum flavor has been
leached from the botanicals, they’re removed, and the remain-
ing solids are filtered out. Maceration is generally used for 
delicate fruits, such as berries and bananas, where the flavor
can’t stand up to harsher methods.
Part IV: Enjoying the “After Dinner” Specials 
260

 Infusion: This method is similar to maceration, and it’s the
most inexpensive way to capture the essences of dried leaves
and plants. If you know how to “steep” tea, you know how to
infuse. The botanical material is moistened until it’s soft. Then
it’s covered with the base spirit and allowed to steep in that.
This results in much of the flavor being transferred to the base.
 Percolation: Have you ever brewed coffee? This is the same
thing. The heated spirit is pumped through the flavoring
ingredients over and over again. It’s generally used with
tough-covered flavorings, such as beans or pods.
 Distillation: This method is very similar to the way gin is made
except that juniper berries are rarely, if ever, used. Botanicals
are dried and put into a pot still. The base spirit goes directly
into the pot still with the botanicals, or into a special type of
tray placed at the “head” of the still. Then the material is put
through the still, which condenses the vapors from the alcohol
and the botanicals together. Generally, a second distillation is
used to make certain that objectionable flavors are totally
removed. This is the costliest way of getting the base spirit
and flavor together. Distillation is generally reserved for rinds,
flowers, and other more highly flavored botanicals.
The final touches
After going through one or more of the processes I describe in 
the previous section, the resulting flavored liqueur that comes 
off the still can be as high as 100 proof. Pure water is used to
reduce the proof. Most of the modern liqueurs are in the low-
alcohol range, between 25 proof (40 percent alcohol by volume, 
or ABV) and 70 proof (35 percent ABV). The mandated alcohol
level for fruit brandies is 70 proof. Some liqueurs, such as Chartreuse
and Curaçaos, are permitted to be bottled at a higher 110 proof 
(55 percent ABV).
Next, the mixture is sweetened with simple sugar, honey, dextrose,
or another type of natural sugar. Then the liqueur is aged for a short
time to help all the flavors “marry.” Blends in which distillers want
to avoid any additional accidental flavoring are aged in stainless
steel tanks. On the other hand, if the distiller wants more flavor,
the liqueur can be aged in wood casks to bring the wood’s extra
flavor agents into the blend. Some macerated liqueurs aren’t aged
at all.
After this, the distiller adds color — usually natural — if desired. A
few liqueurs are chilled before filtering to remove certain unwanted
oils that could cause clouding. If the liqueur contains colloidal
Chapter 14: Collecting Cordials, Lining Up Liqueurs 261

materials, they can be “fined” by being filtered through albumen or
milk that sinks to the bottom of the vat where it attracts particles
that are undesirable and makes it easier to remove them.
With the constant demand for new and improved flavor thrills in
liqueurs, many distillers have turned to food technology. Using
mixtures of natural and manmade flavors, for example, can pro-
duce flavors that taste cold when you take the first sip of a liqueur
and then turn hot in your mouth. Nothing is wrong with using this
technology, provided the ingredients have been approved for food
and drink consumption.
This kind of innovation, however, is frowned on by many high-end
producers. Marie Brizard, for example, has been making all natural
liqueurs since 1755 when, legend has it, nurse Marie brought a sailor
back to health. In appreciation, he gave her a recipe for an “elixir”
that could cure all ills. She and her nephew, Jean-Baptiste Roger,
set up a company to produce this remarkable product and called it
Anisette. The company is still making it the same way.
The two types of cordials
Not all cordials are equal.
Some are “generic,” made using a single commonly known and
commonly found flavoring agent. These cordials are used primarily
in cocktail making. About 40 are generally available, including such
standard items as banana, cassis (black currants), cherry, coffee,
kümmel, peppermint, sloe gin (sloe berry), spearmint, triple sec
(orange), and a back bar full of others.
The other types are called “proprietary” because they’re made
from exclusive recipes created and maintained by the brand pro-
ducer. Many of these cordials may use one of the generics as part
of their mixture, but they all add their own special secret ingredi-
ents. Some of the most famous proprietary cordials are listed in
Table 14-1.

Cordials by the Ingredients
Because of the already vast number of products called liqueurs,
some way to put them in order had to be established. The following
sections tell you about the general categorization used by cordial
producers. Please keep in mind that with the current rush to flavor,
questions arise as to whether (or even why) a gin should be fla-
vored with raspberry. And, if it is, is it a cordial or just another in 
a line of gins from one distiller? That conundrum gets even worse
when dealing with vodka because vodka has no flavor of its own —
that’s one of its major selling points. So, is it vodka when it tastes
like mangos?
All these questions are just a way of leading into the excuse that if
you get confused by the categories and the products that are in
them, think how you would feel if you had to deal with those ques-
tions every day of the week.
Chapter 14: Collecting Cordials, Lining Up Liqueurs 263

Fruit flavors
One of the most popular flavor families used in liqueurs are fruit
flavors. The offerings are expanding rapidly as tropical fruits, such
as mango, kiwi, marula, and maybe even some fruits yet to be
known are added to the arsenal.
Sometimes the distiller can use the entire fruit, including the pit
(as in apricots), and sometimes he can use only the flavorful part,
such as the peels of citrus fruits.
Eaux-de-vie (see Chapter 13) that’s on the shelves in the U.S. isn’t a
true brandy. Rather, these products are fruit-flavored brandies that
are generally at lower alcohol levels than the true eaux-de-vie. And
even fruit-flavored brandies may be flavored with something
unusual.
Table 14-2 lists a generic type of cordial, and then, where there are
any, gives a brand name or two of liqueurs made with that flavor in
bold face.
Table 14-2
Fruit-Flavored Cordials
Flavor Source
Generic Description (Brand(s) in Bold)
Apple
This is the alcohol version of apple cider, the all-
American drink. Low alcohol level. Not to be 
confused with Apple Jack, which is a true brandy.
Apricot
Another fruit that can be either a liqueur or a flavored
brandy. Made from the kernel. Marie Brizard Apry.
Banana
Sweet and heavy with a sometimes-overpowering
banana flavor. Inexpensive versions sometimes smell
like furniture polish. Pisang Ambon (Holland).
Blackberry
Made as a liqueur and a flavored brandy. The brandy is
a traditional liqueur with purported medicinal properties.
Cassis (Currant)
Crème de cassis made in the U.S. has a very berry
taste. When mixed with a good white wine, it makes a
very tasty Kir. The best drink and the best cassis come
from around Dijon in Burgundy, France, where both
originated.

Cherry
Made as a liqueur and a flavored brandy. Bright red
with a so-so cherry flavor. European cherry liqueurs
have a much brighter flavor. Maraschino is distinctive
liqueur made only from Marasca cherries from Italy
and the Dalmatian coast by distilling the pits and the
pomace left from cherry wine. Stock (Italy). Most
famous cherry liqueur: Cherry Heering from Denmark.
Cranberry
Bright red with an astringent taste. Made in the U.S.
Lemon
Growing in popularity throughout the world is
Limóncello, the low alcohol modern Italian liqueur
often found in European bars where no other 
liqueur is served. Pungent lemon-lime flavor is very
cooling. Made by many producers from local citrus.
Villa Massa is particularly good quality.
Lime
Light green; made with lime peel. Fairly sweet and 40
proof (80 percent ABV). Freezolime.
Melon
Light green with a pleasant honeydew flavor. Midori.
Orange
Two generic types. Curaçao, first made on the Dutch
Caribbean island of the same name uses peels of the
local bitter orange. Also available in blue. Triple Sec is
made from both bitter and sweet peels in the U.S. Grand
Marnier is a triple sec made on a base of Cognac.
Cointreau is double distilled to get a “dry” flavor said to
be three times drier than regular orange liqueurs, which
gave birth to the “triple sec” designation.
Peach
Made as a liqueur and as a brandy. Not very “peachy”
until Hiram Walker made Peachtree Schnapps, which
turned the whole peach business upside down.
Southern Comfort is made on a Bourbon base. It starts
as a 100 proof (50 percent ABV) whiskey that’s mixed
with peaches and peach liqueur to bring the alcohol
level down. Is it a liqueur or a whiskey? This purely
American drink can usually be found on the liqueur
shelves. It was originated by Louis Herron, a St. Louis
bartender who later moved to New Orleans and 
named it.
Pear
Wonderful pear aroma, but taste is hard to duplicate.
Marie Brizard and most other French labels are better.

Raspberry
Not many made in the U.S., and those from France are
rated as far superior. Chambord Royal black raspberry
is ranked among the best for color and aroma.
Sloe berry
Called sloe gin, but the sloe berry is actually a plum.
The liqueur is made with cherries and other flavorings
that give it a bright red color. Despite its name, it isn’t
made from a gin base.
Strawberry
Very tough to make liqueurs that taste like strawberries.
Best versions of strawberry flavor are from France and
made with wild berries.
Tangerine
Mandarine Napoleón is made on a Cognac base using
North African tangerines. Other versions are made
with South African tangerines, also on a brandy base.
Seeds and nuts
Fruits aren’t the only flavor bases for liqueurs. Other botanicals, like
seeds and nuts, also make for great beverages. Check out Table 14-3.

Absinthe
The famed French Fèe Verte (“Green Fairy”) was said to
cause madness and was ultimately banned from all
European countries and the U.S. It was made from anise
and wormwood, which was deemed to be poisonous.
Traditionally, the 72 proof (36 percent ABV) liqueur was
diluted with water, and poured over a sugar cube while it
turned pearly white. In the last few years, chemists deter-
mined that what made Absinthe so dangerous was a poi-
sonous substance called thujone. Removing that made
Absinthe once again legal, and it’s now available in the U.S.
Anise
One of the most widely used flavors — licorice — is from
this seed. Anisette includes some other flavorings to add
depth to the licorice-like taste. It’s usually clear but occa-
sionally tinted red. European versions are more complex
than those made in the U.S.

Generic Description (Brand(s) in Bold)
Anise Aperitifs
A broad range of liqueurs with a licorice-like taste were
made in imitation of the then-banned Absinthe. Usually
with an alcohol volume of 90 proof (45.5 percent ABV).
Clear, but when water is added, they turn pearly white.
Best examples of these: Pastis, a French generic (except
for one produced by Ricard), Ouzo (from Greece), Raki
(from Turkey), Herbsaint (from the U.S.). Generic types are
also made in Spain and Italy.
Caraway
Used in making Kümmel, which was originally made in
Holland in the 16th century. This liqueur also includes
cumin seed and has an aftertaste of anise. The Allash
Kümmel made in Germany is regarded as being top quality.
Chocolate
Crème de cacao is the primary liqueur that uses choco-
late. It can be either brown or clear, and it’s primarily for
use in making cocktails. A lot of generic types have
chocolate blended with coffee, mint, or fruits. Among the
proprietaries are: Droste Bittersweet, which tastes like a
Nestle chocolate bar; the Swiss Marmot, which has actual
pieces of chocolate floating in it; Sabra from Israel, which
is a chocolate-orange liqueur; from Holland, Vandermint,
which, as indicated, is a blend of chocolate and mint; and
CocoRibe, made with Virgin Islands rum. The most recent
famous chocolate names added to the liqueur lists are
Godiva Chocolate, White Chocolate, and a ready-to-drink
cocktail with vodka.
Coffee
Crème de café, crème de mocha, and coffee liqueur are
all names given to some generic types of coffee liqueur.
Coffee-flavored brandy has a higher proof and uses
brandy as a base. Finally, branded proprietaries include
the first coffee based liqueur, Kahlua, which possibly 
adds molasses for smoothness. Tia Marie, a product of
Jamaica, has a lighter body.
Elder Bush
The fruit of this bush has a unique flavor and is used in
making higher alcohol (80 proof or 40 percent ABV) and a
sweet slightly licorice flavor. Sambucca Romano is proba-
bly the best-known.

Herbal
Goldschlager is one of the more unusual liqueurs because
it has real flakes of gold — a mythical aphrodisiac — 
in its mixture of herbal flavors. Galliano, the liqueur that
started the rush to highly flavored products with the Harvey
Wallbanger after World War II, is made in Italy and is
named for an Italian war hero. The herbal vanilla flavor 
is less complex than similar liqueurs made in France and
gets very little aging. Jägermeister is a huge recent suc-
cess story in the U.S., although it’s been made in Germany
since 1878, where it’s designated as bitters. It’s best
enjoyed chilled and downed quickly. Licor 43 (“Cuarente
Tres”) is named for the 43 ingredients that go into its
making; it’s based on an ancient farmer-made drink. 
Tuaca Liquore has a lighter than typical herbal-vanilla
flavor and a light amber glow.
Pits and kernels
Fruit pit kernels, such as those found in peaches and 
cherries, give a bitter almond flavor to a number of nut-
flavored liqueurs and fruit-flavored types. Amaretto
Disaronno is the first and best example of a bitter almond
version. Frangelico is another favorite made from nuts, 
but this one is made from hazelnuts. The generic crème 
de noyaux and crème de almond are made from almond
and fruit pit kernels.
Mint
Crème de menthe is one of the most classic generic
liqueurs. It’s colorless but is sometimes tinted green, red,
or occasionally gold. Peppermint Schnapps is a colorless,
drier version.
Spices
Spices are generally used as accent flavors, but you can
find Cinnamon Schnapps and Ginger Schnapps as well as
a ginger-flavored brandy.
Tea
Suntory Green Tea is the best-known brand, but with the
increased interest in tea as a dinnertime beverage, new
types are coming onto the market nearly every month. Like
tea? You’ll love tea liqueur.
Branded, spirit-based
Some liqueurs are derived from a flavored whiskey base. These
liqueurs weren’t hugely successful until recently; their growth in
popularity could be due to the more accepted use of spirits in 
general, specifically whiskey.
Part IV: Enjoying the “After Dinner” Specials 
268

 Bourbon: The exact ingredients in Southern Comfort are still
a mystery, but it is known to be based on Bourbon, which is
logical given the name. Used as a mixer for many years, it’s
still a favorite among young adult drinkers.
 Canadian whisky: Yukon Jack has a citrus flavor blended with
herbs and a long Canadian whisky finish. It’s 72 proof (36 per-
cent ABV).
 Irish whiskey: Irish Mist was born in the mists of time when
warring clans ruled the land and the recipe for making “Heather
Wine” was closely guarded. The formula disappeared when
Ireland was invaded. In the 19th century, distillers tried to
fathom the recipe but failed. The story is that in 1948, an
Austrian refugee turned up at a distillery with his family’s
recipe for a heather liqueur known to be of Irish descent. It
was tried and the Heather Wine was discovered again — or
maybe that’s just a typical Irish yarn.
 Scotch whisky: Drambuie has a touch of honey to sweeten the
herb-spice blend, and it has a touch of Scottish peat. Drambuie
Cream adds stabilized fresh dairy cream to smooth things out.
This secret recipe was held by the McKinnon family from 1745
until 1906 when the liqueur finally went public. It started as a
gift, after the Scottish Rebellion of 1745, from Bonnie Prince
Charlie to Charles McKinnon, who had given him sanctuary.
The prince gave McKinnon the recipe, calling it an dram 
buidheach (the drink that satisfies). Everyone knows the 
name, but the recipe remains a secret.
Cream liqueurs
A number of attempts to produce liqueurs with a fresh cream taste
had failed to meet the shelf life test; they turned sour quickly while
waiting for a customer. The most public examples were the low-
priced, ready-to-drink cocktails called Heublein Cows — they tasted
wonderful but turned sour in a couple of weeks. This notable failure
turned most producers sour, too. Almost a decade later, Dutch
technicians finally found a way to stabilize fresh dairy cream.
The increased shelf life of at least two months opened the way to
an entirely new kind of cordial. A recipe was developed for Bailey’s
Irish Cream made on an Irish whiskey base with light chocolate,
coffee, and coconut flavors.
Bailey’s success encouraged others, and soon the market had a
number of cream cordials — enough to warrant a new category.
Today you can find a number of whiskey-based cream cordials 
as well as Myers’s Rum Cream; Droste Cream, flavored with 
Chapter 14: Collecting Cordials, Lining Up Liqueurs 269

bittersweet chocolate from Holland; Kahlua Cream with coffee and
cream; and even Venetian Cream, based on Italian brandy with
almond, butterscotch, and coconut. One of the latest cream liqueurs
is Tequila Rose, which, despite its name, is a strawberry-flavored
liqueur with a Tequila base.
Oh yes, Bailey’s now offers caramel and mint variations.
Bitters
Bitters aren’t really liqueurs in the popular sense, but they’re clas-
sified as such because they use the same kinds of ingredients.
Bitters, however, are more closely related to the era when concoc-
tions of known curative botanicals were added to alcohol. They
were intended, then and now, as a medicine to relieve stomachaches
and hangovers, and to aid digestion. And they really taste like
that’s what they’re meant to do.
All bitters are just what they’re called, and some of the most 
popular are:
 Amer Picon is made in France using cinchona bark and, thank
goodness, bitter orange to disguise the flavor. Cinchona bark
is also used to make quinine, which helps alleviate malaria.
French fans drink Amer Picon over ice and never mix it with
anything else.
 Angostura Bitters, now made in Trinidad, were originally con-
cocted in Angostura, Venezuela (now Ciudad Bolivar, Venezuela)
by a Dr. Sigert. The good doctor was intent on developing a
medicine to help ward off tropical diseases. With 45 percent
ABV, it was actually a pleasure to drink. Today, most important
is its contribution as a flavor enhancer for food and in cocktails.
 Cynar (pronounced chee’ nar) is a perfect trivia question
because it’s the only spirit made from artichoke leaves. In
Italy, it’s garnished with a slice of orange and served as an
aperitif. Cynar is also frequently used in cocktails where its
distinct herbal flavor is an addition.
 Campari is the world’s favorite bitter today. It was developed
in 1860 to celebrate Italy’s unification, and the same formula is
still in use. That consists of herbs and fruits “from four conti-
nents,” which are aged in oak. Campari is also the main ingre-
dient in two classic cocktails — the Americano and the
Negroni.
 Fernet Branca has been available since 1845. In the U.S., it
could be sold in food stores until about 1960 when the IRS
insisted that it be sold only in licensed liquor stores. It’s hard
Part IV: Enjoying the “After Dinner” Specials 
270

to believe that the combination of 40 herbs and spices could
be an effective digestif, but millions swear it is.
 Peychaud’s Bitters is a purely American product. It was first
made in New Orleans in 1793 by Antoine Peychaud, a refugee
Haitian apothecary. It’s no longer used for curing every tropi-
cal disease, but it lends its unique flavor — a few drops at a
time — to Creole cuisine or cocktails with Southern flair.
 Punt e Mes is a bitter vermouth with a recipe dating back to
the 1700s. The name means “point and a half,” and legend has
it that the name was given to the product by an Italian stock-
broker.
Two classic liqueurs
Chartreuse is called “the world’s most mysterious liqueur.” Its recipe
was recorded in the 16th century by an alchemist who gave it to
local Carthusian monks as a “health liqueur.” The monks perfected
it and protected it from hundreds of nefarious folk who wanted it
for themselves. Even in the face of torture during the French
Revolution, the monks never disclosed the recipe. In 1817, when
France was a little more hospitable, they resumed production of
the liqueur.
The recipe for Benedictine was first recorded in 1510 by its creator
Dom Bernardo Vincelli, a monk at the Benedictine abbey in Fècamp,
France. The abbey was destroyed during the French Revolution.
Seventy years after the Revolution was over, one M. LeGrand rein-
troduced the liqueur commercially. An arrangement with the
Benedictine order permits use of the name and the initials D.O.M.
The initials stand for Deo Optimo Maximus (to God, most good,
most great). Brandy was added in 1920 along with the two-headed
bottle and bottleneck that permitted mixing from a single source.
A Cordial Tasting
You can go to your favorite liquor store and enlist the clerk’s assis-
tance in selecting the kind of tasting you want to do. Here are the
two most common types:
 Horizontal: Try this kind of tasting if you want to sample the
entire output of a single producer.
 Vertical: For this kind of tasting, you select the type of liqueur
that most interests you and compare the flavor, color, and
general appeal of a liqueur from one distiller with the same
product from another distiller.
Chapter 14: Collecting Cordials, Lining Up Liqueurs 271

After you decide which liqueurs you want to taste, the next step is
to open the bottles to let them air for a short time. Then pour some
of the liquid into suitable cordial glasses, and use a tasting sheet
like the one in Chapter 3 to start recording your observations.
Liqueurs are probably the most versatile type of spirits that you
can possibly use. They’re occasionally enjoyed neat, or with car-
bonated nonalcohol beverages, or as an ingredient in either a 
cocktail of your own imagination or a replica of a classic.
In tasting, keep in mind that the products under scrutiny should
always be the center of attention. Some liqueurs should be chilled,
but none should be frozen. The objective is to taste the balance
and complexity of the blend. That’s hard to do when the bottle 
has been kept in the fridge for a day or two.
Just follow these steps for a successful tasting:
1. If the room is warm, chill the liqueur bottles slightly before
opening to hold down the alcohol bite, to tone down the
more strident flavors, and to let the fruit flavors shine.
2. Open the bottle and pour into one of the many lovely cor-
dial glasses that are available today.

Want to make your own liqueurs? 
Here’s how
Once upon a time, farmers and others made spirits as a hobby. Many of the liqueurs
shown in these pages originated that way. A peach farmer took some of his tasti-
est peaches, squeezed out the juice, and mixed it in with the local whiskey. Then
he aged it a little and put it in a bottle — voila, as they say in France — peach liqueur.
There’s a gentleman by the name of James A. Duke, PhD, who has four books 
published on the subject of turning regular garden herbs into tasty liqueurs and
healthful teas. Dr. Duke was a specialist in medicinal plants for the U.S. Department
of Agriculture Research Center for many years until his retirement.
His books mention that using homegrown materials to make liqueurs may or may
not help your health, but they can help your mood. The books, several of which are
available through Amazon.com, include Living Liqueurs, The Green Pharmacy,
Herbs of the Bible, Dr. Duke’s Essential Herbs, and The Handbook of Medicinal
Herbs.
The living ingredients in Living Liqueurs are identified by handsome pen and ink
illustrations. The book gives a complete history of every one of more than 175 
ingredients suitable for use in making your own liqueurs.

Using cordial glasses is important because they have a wide
mouth to let the aroma out. A cordial’s aroma sets the stage
for what’s to follow, the color provides the setting, and the
taste is the star.
3. Try the same liqueur three different ways. First, neat and
warm; next slightly chilled; and finally through a layer of
crushed ice in a taller glass.
Step three may seem to be a lot of trouble to go through for a taste
or two of one liqueur, but keep in mind the difficulties some of the
early distillers — such as the Benedictines — had. You may be
scorned, but you’ll never be beheaded for not doing it the 
“right” way.
That’s became there is no right way to serve liqueurs except to
enjoy them in their crazy variety and to remember the history of
the type, which adds to the romance of drinking them.
Here’s a toast to offer during the tasting:
May the roof above us never fall in, and may we friends gath-
ered below never fall out.
And if you really want to show off, check out the Pousse Café side-
bar for the most difficult cocktail ever conceived.
Pairing Foods with Cordials 
and Liqueurs
Clearly, liqueurs are meant to be enjoyed before, during, or after a
meal. Many liqueurs are specifically designed to be enjoyed before
dinner to whet the appetite for what’s to follow. Our suggestion is
to serve lightly flavored liqueurs as aperitifs, particularly if the
meal is to feature a robust entrée.
During the meal, choose a liqueur as a cooking accompaniment.
The flavor of the liqueur should go well with the foods being served.
For instance, 1⁄3 cup of Kahlua with 1⁄2 teaspoon of mustard stirred in
can be a basting syrup for ham that may have your guests asking
for the recipe. Pretend you’re a master chef who just invented a
new sauce and must keep it secret.
Fish soup for dinner? Why not add 1⁄4 cup of Irish Mist to the fish
soup? The heathery taste will add a grace note to the rest of your
seasoning.
Chapter 14: Collecting Cordials, Lining Up Liqueurs 273

Of course, it’s dessert time when liqueurs really shine. Dine out at
a top restaurant and watch for the cordial tray to come out with an
array of delectable flavors to try.
For a fancy dessert at home, try thin dessert pancakes. Add 2 ounces
of Grand Marnier to the pancakes and keep them thin, because
you’re going to pretend they’re crepes. When browned on both
sides, fold the pancakes, pour another 2 ounces of Grand Marnier
over the top, light a long fireplace match, and keep your hand away
from the pancakes: whoosh — flambé.
Always be careful where you set fire to your pancakes. If the flames
go too high, you could scorch a ceiling or your best table. Keep a
large plate on hand to smother any possible escaping flames. If all
goes well, just make yourself a certificate from the Cordon Black
and Blue — you earned it.
Liqueurs are fun no matter how you use them. So, have some fun
with them. They’ll cooperate.
Part IV: Enjoying the “After Dinner” Specials 
274
The Pousse Café
In French, the name Pousse Café literally means “push the coffee down.” In this
case, you’re pushing five types of liqueur and one base spirit. The name grew out
of the fact that this drink is served most often with dessert as an after-dinner diges-
tif, along with good, strong coffee. It’s pronounced “poose ka-FAY.”
Start making the drink in the most logical place, the bottom. That’s important
because if you do it correctly, you’ll wind up with several layers of different colors
(and densities, which is what keeps them separate).
First get a clean tall glass with straight sides, and start pouring with a very steady
hand. Grenadine goes on the bottom. Then take a small spoon and, with the bowl
side down, slowly drip one part Yellow Chartreuse over the spoon bowl so that it
drips on top of the Grenadine. Next, get a clean spoon and repeat the layering with
one part White Crème de Menthe. This ingredient should be followed by a layer of
one part Sloe Gin (tinted red), followed by one part Green Chartreuse. Finish it off
with one part Brandy.
This monster originated in New Orleans in the mid 19th century and became the
rage of cities around the U.S. in the early 1900s.

W
hen you’re dining out and everyone is reading the menu,
how often have you heard “I think I’ll have a cocktail 
before eating”?
Now for the quiz: What is a cocktail anyway? Whether you’re dining
out or at home, the modern cocktail is defined as any alcohol-based
drink with more than one ingredient — no umbrellas or pink cherries
required. Read on to learn where it all comes from.
This chapter, being one of the Part of Tens, serves up ten classic
spirits cocktails. Then, like any good barkeep, we add one more for
the road.
The majority of the recipes in this chapter come from Bartending
For Dummies, 3rd Edition, by Ray Foley (Wiley). Some recipes
come from the Mr. Boston Platinum Edition (Wiley).
Oops! Tomato Juice on My 
Blouse: The Bloody Mary
Vodka first saw the light of day in Russia, or maybe, as Chapter 10
explains, Poland. After World War I, the spicy morning-after pick-
me-up combination of vodka and tomato juice was whipped up by

American-born Fernand Petiot (ca 1900–1975) at the famed hangout
of American expatriates, Harry’s New York Bar in Paris. In the mid-
1920s, the drink made the clear spirit a favorite with his clientele.
Petiot may or may not have named his drink after a barmaid at
Chicago’s Bucket of Blood tavern, where he had served as a bar-
tender. And he may or may not have named it for a customer who,
having spilled some over her white blouse, noted that it made her
look like “Bloody Mary,” the beheaded Scottish Queen, sister of
Queen Elizabeth I.
For sure, when Petiot came to America in 1934 to become head
bartender at New York City’s St. Regis Hotel, the management at
that ritzy establishment considered “Bloody Mary” vulgar and
changed it to “Red Snapper.” But customers who had met the drink
in Paris insisted on the original name, and, just like that, a new bar
star was born.
Petiot’s own recipe was simplicity itself. Half vodka, half tomato
juice. Period. By the time he got back to America, he was tossing 
a bit of this, a little of that — black pepper, cayenne pepper,
Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco sauce, lemon juice — into the 
original half-and-half. Modern bartenders have taken it upon them-
selves to codify the quantities into something that looks like the
following.

What’s a cocktail?
According to the Online Etymology Dictionary, the word cocktail first surfaced
around the turn of the 19th century. No one knows for sure where it came from,
although H.L. Mencken, the eminent Baltimore journalist and essayist, lists no fewer
than seven possible points of linguistic origin, including a drink stirred with the tail
feather of a rooster.
Another legend has it that a barmaid in New York State used a rooster’s tail to stir
the hot toddies she provided to male visitors because folktales based on the virility
of roosters had it that the cock’s tail had aphrodisiac qualities.
Perhaps the most likely antecedent is the French word coquetier (eggcup). This 
proposal is bolstered by the fact that New Orleans apothecary Antoine Amédée
Peychaud (the man who created the still-famous Peychaud bitters in mid-
18th-century New Orleans) is reported to have held social gatherings in his 
drugstore, where he mixed brandy with bitters and served the drink in, yes, an
eggcup. In other words, the coquetier, which in English sounded like cocktay and
slid seamlessly into cocktail.
You pays your money and you takes your choice.

Bloody Mary (from Bartending For Dummies)
11⁄4 ounce vodka
21⁄2 ounces tomato juice
Dash Worcestershire sauce
Dash Tabasco sauce
Dash salt and pepper
Pour vodka over ice in a glass. Fill with tomato juice. Add a dash or
two of Worcestershire sauce and Tabasco sauce. To make it spicier,
add a little horseradish. Stir, garnish with a celery stalk, and serve.
Alexander! Another Brandy!
Brandy fans generally warm their spirit, holding the round glass in
their hands to “excite” the aroma molecules in the liquid so that
they dance above the surface of the brandy, their grapey scent
available to anyone who sticks his or her nose into the sniff.
However, in 1922, when the bartender at London’s Ciro Hotel was
asked to create an unusual and elegant after-dinner drink to serve
at the wedding of Princess Mary of England to Lord Alexander
Lascelles, he went another way. His innovation? The chilled Brandy
Alexander, a creamy delight that was soon a favorite with elegant
ladies in southern American cities, particularly New Orleans.
Their men may still warm their brandy and drink it the classic way,
while smoking a fragrant cigar. If, that is, they can find a place
where smoking is still legal!
Brandy Alexander (from Bartending For Dummies)
11⁄2 ounces brandy or Cognac
1⁄2 ounce Dark Crème de Cacao
1 ounce sweet cream or ice cream
Shake with ice. Strain into glass.

War Is Hell, so Pass the Rum — 
in a Daiquiri, if You Please
Remember the Maine? The newest and finest American battleship
of its day mysteriously exploded and burned on February 15, 1898
while docked in Havana harbor, and 300 crew members were lost.
However, the country gained a really good excuse to move into
aiding Cubans rebelling against the Spanish Empire.
The Spanish-American War began on April 25. Soon after, the mem-
bers of the U.S. army — not to mention the war correspondents and
Theodore Roosevelt — found themselves beating off not only the
Spanish but also malaria transmitted by billions of omnipresent
mosquitoes.
The victims had no effective medicine available, so they tended to
rely on a mixture of locally made rum and various flavorings for
relief. Eventually Jennings Cox, a member of the ever-resourceful
Corps of Engineers, christened the cocktail the Daiquiri after the city
on the east coast of Cuba where he and his troops were stationed.
Daiquiri (from Bartending For Dummies)
11⁄4 ounce light rum
1⁄2 ounce sweetened lemon juice
Shake or blend with ice.
The local rum was Bacardi, which created the drink in 1896 and
then spent until 1936 protecting it as a Bacardi Daiquiri. The New
York State Supreme Court ruled that the cocktail should be called
the Bacardi Daiquiri and that was the rum to be used. Here’s the
original recipe.
Bacardi Daiquiri (the original recipe)
2 ounces Bacardi Silver Rum
Juice of half a fresh lime
1⁄2 teaspoon of sugar or sugar syrup to taste
Club Soda
Mix all ingredients with cracked ice in a shaker or blender; shake
or blend until smooth. Strain into a chilled cocktail glass.

A Shipboard Romance: The Gimlet
In the late 18th century, Britannia ruled the waves — except when
the waves bit back and sailors developed scurvy. This potentially
fatal vitamin C deficiency disease laid them low on long voyages
and often killed them.
In 1747, while serving on the HMS Salisbury, a Scottish surgeon
named James Lind set up an experiment. He wanted to see whether
changing the sailors’ diet could protect them from scurvy’s weak-
ness and hemorrhages. Lind chose 12 Salisbury sailors suffering
from scurvy and divided them into six pairs. Each pair received a
different dietary supplement: cider; seawater; a garlic/mustard/
horseradish mush; vinegar; or one of two citrus fruits (oranges or
lemons).
You know which ones recovered: the sailors who ate the citrus
fruits. Lind’s discovery wasn’t exactly new — lime juice was already
recognized as an anti-scorbutic (a remedy for scurvy) — but it was
conclusive. Now the problem was getting the sailors to drink the
juice of bitter limes, the citrus fruit most likely to survive long voy-
ages intact.
The official Eureka! moment came when a British Naval Surgeon
named Gimlette recommended mixing the lime juice into the sailors’
daily tot (a ration generally of London dry gin). The unofficial, and
more likely, explanation is that the sailors took it upon themselves
to open the kegs filled with lime juice and add the juice to take
away the taste of the gin. The device used to open the keg was a
corkscrew-like shipboard tool called — you guessed it — a gimlet.
Naval etiquette has changed a lot since then, but the simple recipe
for a Gimlet has never been improved, except for those who don’t
particularly like gin. Today you can always substitute vodka.
Gimlet (from Mr. Boston Platinum Edition)
1 ounce fresh squeezed lime
1 teaspoon superfine sugar or simple syrup
11⁄2 ounces gin
Shake with ice and strain into a chilled cocktail glass.
Chapter 15: Ten (or so) Classic Spirits Cocktails 281

And here’s the vodka substitution recipe:
Vodka Gimlet (from Bartending For Dummies)
11⁄4 ounce vodka
1⁄2 ounce fresh lime juice
Mix vodka with lime juice in a glass with ice. Strain and serve in a
cocktail glass. Garnish with a lime twist.
Uptown, Downtown: 
The Manhattan
New York City prides itself on being the very center of the known
universe, and the center of New York City is the island called
Manhattan. There, in mid-Island, at the end of the 19th century, a
very special cocktail was born. The natives say that it was created
to please Jennie Jerome, the American beauty who later crossed
the Big Pond to marry Lord Randolph Churchill; she later became
the mother of Winston Churchill.
Jennie is said to have asked the bartender at the exclusive Manhat-
tan Club to create a drink to honor the election of Governor Samuel
J. Tilden — yes, the same man who lost the presidential election of
1876 in the Electoral College despite winning the popular vote.
That’s a recorded fact.
But, unfortunately, you can find dozens of different reports of
exactly what the bartender put into the glass. However, if you
order a Manhattan in a restaurant near the Empire State Building,
which stands on the spot that once housed the Manhattan Club,
this is probably what you’ll get:
The Manhattan (from Bartending For Dummies)
2 ounces American or Canadian (blended) whiskey
Splash sweet or dry vermouth
Dash Angostura bitters
Stir with ice; strain into cocktail glass. Garnish with a cherry.

If You Knew Margie Like I Know
Margie: The Margarita
During Prohibition, the Hollywood elite found an oasis in nearby
Mexico. The liquor was plentiful, cheap, and legal. Especially the
Tequila, served in a cocktail glass rimmed with salt and decorated
with a wedge of lime. The drink was a favorite with the young
Californians. They took it back to the States, where it became 
standard fare at cocktail hour — and at other times, as well.
As they say in Hollywood, flash forward now to several years later.
The story shows Margarita Soames, a Texas socialite, looking for a
new way to serve an old favorite at the annual holiday celebration
in her Acapulco villa. She carefully adds an extra ingredient to the
locally famous cocktail — the strong, clear, orange liqueur triple
sec. Margarita’s guests immediately vote her recipe Numero Uno
and name the drink in her honor. As they say in documentaries,
olé. The Margarita today is America’s most popular cocktail after
the Martini.
Margarita (from Bartending For Dummies)
1 ounce tequila
1 ounce Cointreau or triple sec
1 ounce sweet and sour mix or fresh lime juice
Blend with crushed ice. Serve in a salt-rimmed glass. Garnish with
a lime wheel.
Margarita (from Mr. Boston Platinum Edition)
11⁄2 ounces tequila
1⁄2 ounce triple sec
1 ounce lemon juice
Coarse (Kosher) salt
Mix liquid ingredients with ice in a shaker or blender. Rub rim of
chilled cocktail glass with a slice of cut lime. Rub the glass lip in a
plate of coarse salt. Strain and pour liquids into the glass. Garnish
with a lime slice.
Chapter 15: Ten (or so) Classic Spirits Cocktails 283

The World’s Most Famous 
Cocktail: The Martini
No one knows for sure who first decided to soften Dutch gin with
dry vermouth. But most people are pretty sure that the event
occurred on the U.S. West Coast, where the drink was created either
by a San Francisco bartender named Martinez or by a traveler on
his way to Martinez, California.
Others take a more jaundiced view, claiming the Italian winemakers
Martini developed the cocktail to promote sales of the company’s
vermouth. In fact, as early as 1890, Martini sold bottles of a pre-
mixed “American Drink” called the Martini, which rather suggests
that they, too, gave credit to the Yanks.
Finally, you have the New York claim to Martini fame: The tale says
that a Knickerbocker Hotel bartender named Martini mixed a drink
that was half gin, half dry vermouth, shook it with ice and strained
it into a chilled glass. He served the world’s first crystal clear, dry
Martini to (who else?) John D. Rockefeller.
If it was made with Old Tom, a popular Dutch gin, the original
Martinez was slightly pink. Today, it may be multicolored — blue
with added Curaçao, red with grenadine, yellow with citrus juice,
green with apple flavored mixes, or brownish with coffee. True afi-
cionados consider these an abomination, preferring them clear, the
Knickerbocker way.
Martinez (from multiple sources)
1 ounce sweet vermouth
1 ounce gin
Dash bitters
2 dashes Maraschino
1⁄4 teaspoon triple sec
Stir with “two small lumps of ice” and strain into chilled glass.
Martini (from Bartending For Dummies)
2 ounces gin
Dash extra dry vermouth
Part V: The Part of Tens 
284

Shake or stir gin and vermouth over ice. Strain and serve in a cock-
tail glass straight up or over ice. Garnish with a lemon twist or an
olive (even two).
A Cuban Cup of Cheer: The Mojito
Like the Bloody Mary, the Mojito (mo-HEE -to) is a drink whose 
origins are cloaked in legend. Its creation is variously attributed 
to pirates, slaves, and the scion of a very famous family distiller.
The pirate was Richard Drake, who mixed aguardiente (an unre-
fined rum), sugar, lime, and mint into a concoction he called El
Draque (the dragon), the nickname of Sir Francis Drake (no rela-
tion). Drake was the 16th century Cuban-based British explorer
who made his bones terrorizing ships in the Caribbean and ports
along the coast of South America where El Draque (the cocktail,
not the pirate) was enthusiastically welcomed.
A second story attributes the Mojito to African slaves working in
the Cuban sugar fields, although many drinks historians think this
tale confuses the Mojito with the Daiquiri, another Cuban-born
delight.
Modern distillers give credit for the Mojito to a 19th century Cuban
distiller named Don Segundo Bacardi. He is said to have mixed a
few naturally available ingredients — sugar, limes, and mint — into
his evening rum. This creation was a refreshing drink that was nec-
essary after a day in the field or after dinner in the warm Cuban
evening. When the Bacardis moved their distillery to Puerto Rico,
Don Segundo’s cooler became a favorite there, as well. Today, it
ranks among the four most popular cocktails in the United States,
along with the Martini in all its forms, the Margarita, and the
Cosmopolitan.
In other words, if you mix it, they will come. To drink. In droves.
The Mojito (from Bartending For Dummies)
2 ounces Bacardi light rum
Eight mint leaves
Juice of 1⁄2 lime
2 teaspoons sugar
4 ounces club soda
Chapter 15: Ten (or so) Classic Spirits Cocktails 285

In a Collins glass, place mint leaves and lime juice, crush with a
muddler or the back of a spoon, and add sugar. Fill glass with ice,
add rum, and top with club soda. Stir well and garnish with a sprig
of mint.
The Highland Fling: Rob Roy
The Scots aren’t given to diluting their fine whisky with anything
other than clear mountain water, if that. The Rob Roy is as close 
as they come to a national mixed drink. The drink was named for
Robert MacGregor (1871–1734), a Lowlands sort of Scottish Robin
Hood, who was celebrated in novel and poem by Sir Walter Scott
and William Wordsworth.
Some New York food writers and theater historians say the drink
was actually created in 1894 by a bartender at the original Waldorf
Astoria. The hotel was located near Herald Square, around the
corner, so to speak, from where a new operetta called “Rob Roy”
had taken the city by storm. What better way to pay tribute to the
show than to name a drink in honor of its hero?
Who’s right? As usual, who knows? But once again, the pleasure of
the drink is certain.
Rob Roy (from Bartending For Dummies)
2 ounces blended Scotch whisky
Dash sweet or dry vermouth

Simple Perfection: 
The Whiskey Sour
The very first recipe for a whisky sour appeared appropriately in
the very first book of drink recipes, compiled and published in
1862 by British-born bartender Jerry Thomas (1825–1885). Thomas
(also known as The Professor or The Father of the Cocktail) was as
much a showman as a barkeep. He traveled the U.S., putting on
stage demonstrations of his bartending skills. Ultimately, he wound
up for a while at San Francisco’s Hotel Occidental, where he’s also
credited with creating the Blue Blazer. He’s known as the first man
to create an organized system of drink families and categories.
The book is a 236-recipe soft cover called The Bartender’s Guide or
How To Mix Drinks. It’s still useful for its information on recipes for
homemade cocktails and cordials. Facsimile copies from New Day
Publishing aren’t available on Amazon.com at the moment, but you
can see an image of the cover. Other versions were revised by
Herbert Asbury, a New York newspaperman, in 1865 an d 1872.
Vintage Books, a French publisher, has a copies available (in
English) at www.vintagebook.net. You can also find it online at
www.theartofdrink.com/book.

Horses, Grass, and Mint: 
The Mint Julep
You can get a good, brisk discussion going among Bourbon versus
rum aficionados by asking which came first: the Mojito or the Mint
Julep. Each side is likely to consider the other’s candidate second
in line.
In fact, the Mojito probably wins the race. According to Famous
New Orleans Drinks and How to Mix ‘Em, published by New Orleans
bartender Stanley Clisby Arthur in 1937 and in print ever since, the
Mint Julep arrived in Louisiana around the turn of the 19th century.
It came to town along with aristocrats expelled from San Domingo,
where the Mojito was already a favorite. Not surprisingly, Arthur’s
recipe for the original Julep is made with rum.
Eventually, of course, the Julep spread across the American South
and north to Kentucky, where the Lords of the Land of Bourbon
recast it as an American drink, made with American Bourbon. After
the Julep was named the official drink of the Kentucky Derby, its
place in spirits history was assured. And well deserved.
Mint Julep (from Bartending For Dummies)
2 ounces Bourbon
1⁄4 ounce sugar syrup
Five mint leaves
In a silver cup, mash four mint leaves with sugar syrup. Fill the cup
with crushed ice. Add Bourbon and garnish with a mint leaf.

Shaker, shaker, who’s got the shaker?
Serving spirits is generally a breeze: Open bottle. Pour spirits into glass. Drink.
Serving cocktails is another thing entirely: Mash. Muddle. Crush. Shake. Strain. Pour.
Just getting to “drink” can be exhausting.
To make the job easier, the smart cocktail maker keeps several basic tools close at
hand.
 Blender: Use it to smooth some drinks. In a pinch, a blender with a “crush ice”
setting can be used to crush ice. No setting, no crushing. Unless you’re the do-
it-yourself type. If so, wrap the ice in a dishtowel, put the towel on a cutting
board, and whack away with a meat mallet.
 Cocktail shaker: A two-piece container that looks like two large stainless steel
or glass drinking glasses. Pour the ingredients into the larger half, clap on the
top, and shake away.
 Cocktail strainer: A strainer that fits over the larger half of the cocktail shaker
so that you can pour your cocktail into a glass minus pieces of ice and other
floating stuff.
 Long spoon: Similar to an ice teaspoon, this tool is long enough to reach into
the shaker and give everything a good stir.
 Measuring cup: A 11⁄2-ounce jigger is good; an 8-ounce measuring cup is more 
versatile.
 Muddler: Cooks call this a pestle; the wooden or marble bat used to crush herbs
and spices in the bowl is known as a mortar.

So the local supermarket is out of the goose livers you need to make
an authentic pâté de foie gras. Not to worry. Plain chicken livers
with a dash of this and that — particularly your favorite gin — will
do nicely. Serve the terrine with toast points, flash a mysterious
Mona Lisa smile when complimented on the dish, and who will
guess those livers aren’t duck? No one, that’s who.

3. Thoroughly butter a terrine dish and set aside.
4. Beat the egg and cream together, mix into the chilled ingre-
dients, and pack the mixture into the buttered terrine dish.
5. Scatter bits of butter on top of the mixture and bake for 45
minutes to 1 hour at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
6. Cool the baked terrine in the refrigerator. To serve, turn the
chilled terrine out on a platter and garnish with orange 
segments and watercress.

Marinated Salmon
This recipe melds Scotch whisky with another famous Scottish
export: salmon. The dish itself does double duty as the perfect
illustration of proverbial Scottish practicality. Translation: You can
serve it either as a cool appetizer in winter followed by a warm
entrée, or as a cool main event at a summer lunch or dinner.
Yield: 2 to 3 servings
Ingredients
2 tablespoons Scotch whisky
2 tablespoons lemon juice
8 ounce boned, tail fillet of salmon
Salt and pepper to taste
1⁄2 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon chopped chives
1 tablespoon chopped dill
Preparation
1. Mix the whisky and lemon juice together and set aside.
2. Place the salmon on a platter, cover, and chill in freezer for
1 hour.
3. Use a very sharp knife to slice the chilled fish as finely as
possible across the grain.
4. Lay the fish slices in a single layer on a plate.
5. Drizzle the whisky and lemon juice over the salmon; season
with salt and pepper; sprinkle on sugar and herbs.
6. Allow the salmon to marinate (covered) in the refrigerator
for least 1 hour or overnight, basting with the juices two or
three times before serving.

Penne à la Vodka
When you think of pasta, the alcohol beverages that spring most
quickly to mind are usually wines, red or white. This classic recipe,
however, eschews wine for a distilled spirit, a surprising but deli-
cious combination that goes well with white wine to match the color
of the white pasta and sauce, red wine for contrast, or a vodka and
tonic for consistency. Your choice.
Yield: 4 servings
Ingredients
1 pound penne, or other tubular pasta such as rigatoni
1⁄4 cup unsalted butter
3 tablespoons tomato paste, diluted with 1⁄4 cup hot water
1 hot pepper
2⁄3 cup fresh cream
1⁄4 to 1⁄3 cup vodka
1 teaspoon brandy
1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
Preparation
1. Cook the pasta according to the package instructions.
2. For the sauce, melt the butter in a large pot and stir in the
diluted tomato paste and the hot pepper.
3. Let the mixture simmer over a low flame for a couple of
minutes.
4. Stir in the cream.
5. When the sauce comes back to a boil, add the vodka and
brandy.
6. Fish out and discard the pepper, stir in the grated cheese,
and continue stirring gently until the sauce is well mixed
and creamy.
7. Drain the cooked pasta and transfer it into the sauce.
8. Cook the pasta and sauce over a brisk flame, stirring for
about 1 minute to help the pasta absorb the sauce.
9. Serve in warmed bowls.

Filet Mignon with Whiskey Sauce
The filet is generally considered the most tender cut of beef. But
while the filet has tenderness and silky smoothness in spades, it
lacks a little in the flavor department compared to other cuts of
beef such as sirloin or rib eye. That’s why it’s a great idea to sauce
up your filet, and that’s where this recipe comes in.
Yield: 4 servings
Ingredients
4 small filet mignons (4 ounce each)
2 tablespoons butter
1 clove garlic, diced
1 teaspoon finely diced shallots
11⁄2 cups mushrooms, chopped
1 teaspoon honey
1⁄2 teaspoon wholegrain mustard
1 ounce Jameson Irish Whiskey
3⁄4 cup beef stock
3⁄4 cup heavy (double) cream
Freshly ground black pepper to taste
Preparation
1. Melt the butter in a skillet over medium-high heat.
2. Add the filets and sauté until they’re done to your prefer-
ence. Transfer the filets from the pan to a heated platter,
and cover them with foil to keep warm.
3. To the skillet, add the garlic, shallots, and mushrooms, and
sauté over medium heat until soft.
4. Add honey and wholegrain mustard to the pan and stir.
5. Add the whiskey, and turn up the heat so that the sauce
boils for 1 minute as the alcohol evaporates.
Part V: The Part of Tens 
298

6. Turn down the heat and stir in the beef stock. Boil gently
until the amount of sauce in the pan is reduced by half.
7. Stir in the cream, and continuing stirring until the sauce
thickens.
8. Give the sauce a quick taste, and add salt and pepper as
needed.
9. To serve, slice the filets, put them on plate, and pour the
sauce over the top.
Green Beans with Toasted 
Pine Nuts
Never thought of adding spirits to veggies? Think again. The Bourbon
whiskey in this side dish adds a surprising but delicious sweetness
to the beans. Try this once, and you’ll never go back to plain
boiled string beans.
Yield: 4 servings
Ingredients
2 cups green beans
1 to 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1⁄4 cup pine nuts
2 tablespoons Wild Turkey Bourbon
Melted butter to taste
Salt and pepper to taste
Preparation
1. Immerse green beans in boiling water for 1 to 2 minutes.
Drain, and set aside.
2. Heat vegetable oil in a medium sauté pan, add pine nuts,
and toast until golden, about 1 to 2 minutes.
3. Remove the nuts from the pan (but don’t wash the pan).
Drain the pine nuts on a paper towel and set aside.
Chapter 16: Ten Spirited Dishes 299

4. Put the green beans in the sauté pan, add the Wild Turkey
Bourbon, and boil over high heat for 1 minute to cook off
the alcohol.
5. Turn the heat down to medium-low and add the nuts. Stir
the mixture over the heat for 1 to 2 minutes.
6. Serve hot with melted butter and salt and pepper.
Note: You can vary the recipe by substituting snow peas for the
green beans and slivered almonds or shelled pumpkin seeds for
the pine nuts.
Tennessee Whiskey 
Candied Apples
For a tart firm treat, use green or Granny Smith apples; Rome apples
hold their shape as well as green apples, but deliver a slightly
sweeter flavor. As you might guess, this dish goes particularly well
as a side with roasted meats and poultry, but you could also top it
with a dollop of unsweetened whipped cream and serve it as a
warm or chilled dessert.
Yield: 6 servings
Ingredients
6 cups peeled and sliced apples
1⁄4 cup butter
2 to 3 cups white sugar
Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey to taste
Preparation
1. Combine apples, butter, and sugar in a large skillet.
2. Cook slowly over low-to-medium heat until the apple slices
are tender but still hold their shape
3. Add the whiskey, and stir over high heat for 5 minutes to
cook off the alcohol. Serve while warm.

AppleJack Pound Cake
AppleJack, an apple brandy, adds a warm, rich flavor to this tradi-
tional pound cake. To make an even richer dessert, toast slices of
cake on a flat, nonstick pan, and top them with unsweetened
whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.
Yield: 8 to 10 servings
Ingredients
1 pound butter or margarine
3 cups sugar, divided
8 eggs, separated
3 cups sifted all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons vanilla
1⁄3 cup Laird’s AppleJack
1⁄2 cup chopped pecans
Preparation
1. Cream butter and 2 cups of sugar until light and fluffy.
2. Add the egg yolks one at a time, beating thoroughly after
each addition.
3. Add flour alternately with vanilla and AppleJack (beginning
and ending with flour), one third at a time, beating the mix-
ture smooth after each addition.
4. In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff but not
dry.
5. Stir the remaining sugar into the egg whites gradually and
gently.
6. Fold the butter mixture gently into the egg whites.
7. Sprinkle pecans in the bottom of a well-buttered 10-inch
tube pan.
8. Carefully pour the cake batter into the pan. Bake in a 350-
degree oven for 11⁄2 hours.
9. Turn the cake out onto cake rack to cool completely, and
then slide it onto a cake plate for slicing and serving.

 Introducing the USDA’s incredible online database
 Going beyond the basics to find out which beverages have more nutrients
A
re distilled spirits food? Yes. Do they provide any nutrients
other than calories? Sometimes. This chapter gives you basic
nutritional facts for ten distilled beverages. It’s enough info to sat-
isfy the moderately curious.
If you really want to know just about all there is to know about the
nutritional content of your favorite spirit, check out the USDA
National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, a long name 
for an incredibly handy database. It’s available online at www.nal.
usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search.
The entries listed here show you the basic nutrients — calories,
protein, fat, and carbs. But some alcohol beverages have other
goodies. For example, click onto the USDA site and call up coffee
liqueur with cream. Yes, it has caffeine. No surprise there. But it
also has a little calcium. Very little, to be sure, but there it is. Who
knew? Pull up some other alcohol beverage products on the data-
base to see what else is in your glass.
A note for cocktail fans: The cocktails listed in this chapter are the
ones sold in cans. True, they don’t provide the same delicate bal-
ance of flavors you get with a freshly made drink at your favorite
watering hole. However, the USDA chose these versions for its
database because they pour the same serving size and nutrients
every single time. Consider them simply a nutritional guide.

Ten (or so) Health Benefits 
of Moderate Drinking
In This Chapter
 Defining moderate drinking
 Evaluating alcohol’s effects on heart health
 Explaining the link between moderate drinking and longevity
 Listing some real risks of alcohol abuse
A
ccording to the experts at the U.S. Departments of Agriculture
(USDA) and Health and Human Services (HHS) — the authors
of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2005 — people who drink
in moderation have the lowest all-cause mortality (science speak
for d-e-a-t-h from all causes).
The guidelines define moderation as one drink a day for a woman
and two drinks a day for a man. One drink is equal to 1.5 ounces of
80 proof spirits, or 5 ounces of wine, or 12 ounces of regular (as
opposed to low-cal) beer.
Government stats, in the U.S. and around the world, show that
people who stick to these guidelines not only live longer, but they
also live healthier than people who either drink too much or avoid
alcohol altogether. Those in the Moderate Middle have fewer heart
attacks and strokes. They’re less likely to suffer from high blood
pressure, Alzheimer’s disease, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis,
broken or weakened bones, Parkinson’s disease, hepatitis A, pan-
creatic cancer, macular degeneration (a major cause of blindness),
duodenal ulcer, erectile dysfunction, hearing loss, gallstones, liver
disease, and — believe it or not — the common cold.
In addition, just feeling good may not be up there with avoiding a
heart attack or broken bones, but it’s nothing to sneeze at either.
One drink before or with a meal may improve digestion or offer a
soothing respite at the end of a stressful day, and the occasional

drink with friends can be a social pleasure. In other words, the
physical and psychological effects of moderate drinking are com-
ponents of a comfortable life.
Best of all, unlike some of life’s other pleasures, the health benefits
of moderate drinking actually seem to get more beneficial as a
person gets older. The British Medical Journal reports that among
men younger than 35 and women younger than 55, nondrinkers
have a lower risk of death than do moderate drinkers. But hit the
magic 65, and things change. Among senior citizens, moderate
drinking may save as many as 5,000 older lives a year, perhaps
because older drinkers have learned to avoid the risky behavior
that trips younger drinkers into potentially fatal accidents.
This chapter is an annotated list of ten (or so) good things associ-
ated with moderate drinking, from the well-known (improved heart
health) to the new and surprising (that increased resistance to the
common cold).
And remember: When one drinker toasts another with the words,
“To your health,” he or she is right on the mark.
Heartening News
The evidence that moderate drinking benefits the heart comes
from reliable studies funded and/or run by reliable organizations
like the American Cancer Society (ACS) and the American Heart
Association (AHA).
Part V: The Part of Tens 
308
Riding the curve
When scientists talk about the relationship between alcohol and heart health, the
term “J-curve” often pops up. What’s a J-curve? A statistical graph in the shape of
a J.
In terms of alcohol and your risk of heart attack, the lower peak on the left of the J
shows the risk among teetotalers, the high spike on the right shows the risk among
those who drink too much, and the curve in the center shows the risk in the mod-
erate middle. In other words, the J-curve says that people who drink moderately
have a lower risk of heart attack than do either people who drink too much or not
at all. Several studies say that the J-curve may also apply to a moderate drinker’s
risk of stroke.

The best known study may be the ACS Cancer Prevention Study 1,
a research project that followed more than one million Americans
in 25 states for 12 years. Analyzing the lifestyles of 276,802 middle-
aged men and the circumstances of those who died during the
study period, the researchers concluded that moderate alcohol
intake had an “apparent protective effect on coronary heart dis-
ease.” Translation: Men who drink moderately lower their risk of
heart attack. The risk is 21 percent lower for men who have one
drink a day than for men who never drink.
A similar analysis of the data for nearly 600,000 women in the same
study showed that, like men, women who drink occasionally or have
one drink a day are less likely to die of heart attack than women
who don’t drink at all.
The two most likely explanations for these facts are alcohol’s ability
to make blood less sticky, reducing the risk of an artery-clogging
blood clot, and its tendency to raise the level of HDL, the “good” fat
and protein particles that ferry cholesterol out of the body.
Lowering Bad Cholesterol,
Raising Good Cholesterol
Moderate amounts of any type of beverage alcohol lower blood
levels of low density lipoproteins (LDL), the “bad” fat and protein
particles that carry cholesterol into arteries, while raising the
blood levels of high-density lipoproteins (HDL), the “good” fat and
protein particles that ferry cholesterol out of the body.
To counter the idea that wine is the only alcohol beverage that
accomplishes this phenomenon, researchers at Hebrew University
Hadassah Medical School in Jerusalem divided 48 men with coro-
nary artery disease in two groups. The first got 12 ounces of Pale
Lager a day for a month; the second got mineral water. Both
groups ate a fruit-and-veggie-rich diet.
The results, released in 2003, showed that 21 of the 24 beer
drinkers had lowered their bad cholesterol, raised their good cho-
lesterol, and reduced the activity of fibrinogen, a natural clot-
maker in blood. None of these changes occurred among those
drinking mineral water, but, on the other hand, nobody in either
group had a heart attack during the study.
Chapter 18: Ten (or so) Health Benefits of Moderate Drinking 309

Busting Blood Clots
Cut yourself and you’ll bleed, but soon tiny particles in blood, called
platelets, glom onto a sticky net made of a naturally occurring sub-
stance, called fibrinogen, to form a scab. This series of events, most
visible when skin is cut, also occurs when the inside surface of a
blood vessel is injured, perhaps by a passing piece of cholesterol.
Forming a scab over a cut on the skin is good. Building a scab over
an injury inside a blood vessel isn’t. Inside an artery, the “scab”
can catch more particles that stick on, eventually creating a pile of
gunk that may be large enough to block the artery and cause a
heart attack.
Alcohol beverages reduce the risk of forming that pile of gunk by
temporarily lessening the stickiness of fibrinogen and other natu-
rally occurring clotting factors that normally make platelets stick
together.
As a result, blood clots are less likely to form in an artery, another
reason why moderate drinking appears to protect the heart.
Lowering the Pressure
When the alcohol from a (moderate) drink flows through the blood-
stream into the heart, the heart muscles relax, reducing the force
of their contractions (or beats). As a result, your heart pumps out
slightly less blood for a few minutes, blood vessels all over your
body relax, and your blood pressure goes down.
The contractions of your heart muscle soon return to normal, but
your blood vessels may remain relaxed and your blood pressure
may stay lower for as long as half an hour. How important is this
lowered blood pressure?
In 2002, researchers at the Nurses’ Health Study issued a new report
on 70,891 women who had been 25 to 42 years old when the study
began in 1989. According to this report, women in the study who
took one quarter to one half of a drink a day — in real life, two or
three drinks a week — were 15 percent less likely to develop high
blood pressure than were women who never drink. The results
applied to all kinds of alcohol — that is, beer, wine, and spirits.
The inevitable bad news — sorry about this — is that women who
take more than 10 drinks a week are 30 percent more likely to have
high blood pressure. Once again, moderation is the key.

Chapter 18: Ten (or so) Health Benefits of Moderate Drinking 311
Reviewing resveratrol
Resveratrol, found in grapes and peanuts, is a flavonoid, one of a group of plant
chemicals credited with lowering cholesterol and thus reducing your risk of heart
attack. It’s also linked to a lower risk of some forms of cancer, but that’s another book.
In 2001, two reports — one in the American Heart Association’s Circulation, the 
other in Atherosclerosis — confirmed earlier speculation that resveratrol powers
up antioxidants, such as vitamin E and vitamin C. These compounds prevent mole-
cule fragments from linking up to form rogue molecules that damage body cells.
Juice from purple grapes has more resveratrol than the juice from red grapes, which
has more resveratrol than the juice from white grapes (get the red wine connec-
tion?). To be even more specific, in 1998, a team of food scientists from the USDA
Agricultural Research Service and Mississippi identified a native American grape,
the muscadine, as an unusually potent source of resveratrol.
About half of all muscadines grown in the United States are used to make grape
juice. With that in mind, you can see that teetotalers can get their resveratrol from
grapes and grape juice. Don’t you love it when science serves up something for
everybody?
But suppose you also absolutely, positively hate grape juice. What to do? Easy: Just
pick a pack of peanuts.
A 1998 analysis from the USDA Agricultural Research Service in Raleigh, North
Carolina, shows that peanuts have 1.7 to 3.7 mcg (micrograms) of resveratrol per
gram versus the 0.6 to 8.0 mcg of resveratrol per gram in red wine. This fact may
explain data from the long-running Harvard University/Brigham and Women’s
Hospital Nurses Health Study, which shows that women who eat an ounce of nuts
a day have a lower risk of heart disease. To review: Wine, grape juice, peanuts —
all tools to lengthen life.
Wait. There’s more. Resveratrol pills may be looming on the health horizon.
The whole world knows by now that cutting calories is one way to lose weight, and
that cutting lots and lots of calories may lengthen life, at least in laboratory mice for
which seriously low-calorie diets appear to increase lifespan to the human equiva-
lent of 162 years. No jokes about the quality of that life, please.
In 2006, researchers at Harvard Medical School announced that feeding resveratrol
to the mice does the same thing, by “turning on long life genes shared by almost all
living organisms,” in the words of study coauthor and molecular biologist David
Sinclair.
Unfortunately, to get the amount of resveratrol needed to produce this effect in mice,
human beings would have to down gazillions of glasses of red wine a day. But one
can practically hear the hoof beats of drug companies in the distance rushing into
to find out how to pack the necessary resveratrol into a human size pill.
To which one can only say, “Get a move on, guy. The world is waiting.”

Staving Off Stroke
In 2006, scientists at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland fed lab-
oratory mice a moderate dose of resveratrol, a naturally occurring
compound in red grape skins and seeds. Then they induced stroke
in the mice and found that animals given the resveratrol experi-
enced about 40 percent less brain damage than mice that weren’t
treated with resveratrol before a stroke.
The suspicion is that resveratrol increases levels of heme oxygenase,
an enzyme in the brain that protects nerve cells. Naturally, more
studies are required before anyone can say that drinking red wine
prevents stroke damage, but, hey, it’s a start.
Beer and distilled spirits have no resveratrol, so right now this par-
ticular good news may (or may not) apply only to red wine. But an
any-type-of-alcohol-plus-caffeine cocktail may prevent additional
brain damage after a stroke strikes.
In 2004, neurologist James C. Grotta and a team of researchers at
the University of Texas-Houston Medical School whipped up an
experimental drug they named caffeinol. They designed one dose
to deliver as much caffeine as two cups of strong coffee plus the
alcohol in one drink of any type of alcohol.
The Texans induced stroke in laboratory rats and gave caffeinol to
half the injured rats within two hours of the stroke. The treated
animals had up to 80 percent less brain damage than the untreated
ones. Human tests say caffeinol is safe; future studies will tell
whether it’s effective. If so, look for Irish coffee on the menu in
every ER.
Just kidding.
Deterring Diabetes
In 2002, the Journal of the American Medical Association reported
the results of a study at the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s
Agricultural Research Service (ARS) Lab in Beltsville, Maryland,
designed to evaluate the effects of moderate drinking alcohol on
insulin resistance, a risk factor for both diabetes and heart disease.
The scientists randomly assigned 53 healthy, post-menopausal,
women volunteers to one of three once-a-day drink plans: Plain
orange juice or orange juice with half an ounce of alcohol (the
Part V: The Part of Tens 
312

equivalent of one standard drink), or orange juice with one ounce
of alcohol (the equivalent of two standard drinks).
Yes, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans say that one standard
drink is 1.5 ounces of distilled spirits, 5 ounces of wine, or 12
ounces of beer. But the actual amount of pure alcohol in that
amount of beer, wine, or spirits is 0.5 ounces of alcohol. Remember:
When spirits are distilled, and when wine and beer are fermented
and bottled, the alcohol is diluted with water.
The 51 women who completed the study took blood tests to meas-
ure their fasting insulin levels (the level of insulin in the blood after
12 hours without food or drink).
Among women who drank orange juice with one ounce of alcohol
each day, fasting insulin levels went down 19 percent versus no
change for those drinking less alcohol or none at all. Levels of
triglycerides, a form of fat found in blood that’s a risk factor for
both heart disease and diabetes, also fell among the women who
drank either one half or one ounce of alcohol a day.
Protecting Intelligence
MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) studies of the brain have clearly
shown that even moderate drinking knocks off some brain cells. The
surprise is that this loss may not correlate with a loss of intellect.
Typically, a human being’s score on tests for memory, reasoning,
and decision-making declines about one point per decade before
age 60 and two to three points every ten years after that.
But data from a 12-year, 1,488-person survey at Johns Hopkins
University in Maryland strongly suggests that moderate drinkers
score better than teetotalers over time on the Mini-Mental State
Examination (MMSE), a standard test of intelligence and cognition.
(In addition, a recent study among French senior citizens pinpointed
a 75 percent lower risk for Alzheimer’s disease and an 80 percent
lower risk for senile dementia among moderate drinkers versus
teetotalers. Vive la France.)
What makes this news fascinating is that MRI studies showing 
alcohol-related brain shrinkage and the new alcohol-and-intelligence
survey were both done at Johns Hopkins.
Talk about your left hand (or brain) not knowing what your right

Preserving the Brain
Can it be? Yes, it can. According to Monique M.B. Breteler and 
her colleagues at the Erasmus Medical Centre in Rotterdam, the
Netherlands, people who drink moderately as they grow older are
less likely than abstainers or heavy drinkers to develop Alzheimer’s
and other forms of dementia, including dementia triggered by
repeated small blood-clot-related strokes.
To reach that conclusion, from 1990 to 1999, the Dutch team col-
lected data for 5,395 healthy people age 55 and older with no signs
of dementia. After adjusting the data to account for gender, age,
weight, blood pressure, smoking, and all the other nasty factors
that affect the risk of dementia, the researchers discovered that
the people in the survey who took one to three drinks a day of any
kind of beverage alcohol were only half as likely as those who
drank more (or less) to develop dementia.
Anyone here know how to say “to your health” in Dutch?
Boosting Bones
Alcohol abuse is linked to an increased risk of fractures, not simply
to an intoxicated person’s higher risk of falling, but also to a docu-
mented alcohol-related loss of bone density (the concentration of
minerals such as calcium in bones), particularly in postmenopausal
women, a group at high risk of weakened bones.
But moderate drinkers don’t have the same problem. When re-
searchers at the Bone Metabolism Unit and the Cardiac Center of
Creighton University School of Medicine in Omaha, Nebraska,
measured bone density among 445 women ages 65 to 77, they
found that the women who drank moderately (about an ounce a
day) had higher total bone density, higher spinal bone density, and
higher forearm bone density than the women who drank more or
less or none at all.
How come? The body destroys old bone and builds new bone every
day. With age, the body continues to break down old bone at the
same rate but builds new bone more slowly. Hence, the character-
istic loss of bone called age-related osteoporosis.
The Creighton researchers suggest that alcohol may lower the con-
centration of anti-bone hormones, thus preserving existing bone.
Worth another study, doncha think?

Enhancing Appetite
Appetite is the desire for food, a psychological reaction (looks
good! smells good!) that stimulates hunger pangs, the involuntary
contractions triggered by the secretion of gastric acids in an empty
stomach that say, “Time to eat.”
In America, as any casual observer of bulging bodies knows, most
people have no trouble shoveling in the food even in the absence
of hunger pangs.
But for those whose weight is under control, a moderate drink
before dinner can enhance the pleasure of dining. In addition,
appetite declines with age so that older people often eat less than
they should, raising the possibility of malnutrition. Luckily, several
studies in nursing homes and hospitals have suggested that a mod-
erate amount of alcohol at dinnertime may benefit healthy seniors
who aren’t physically or mentally impaired or taking any medica-
tion that can interact with the alcohol.
Controlling Weight
Yes, a balanced diet is important. But so is balanced consumption
of beverage alcohol.
The figure comes from researchers at Texas Tech University Health
Sciences Center and the Mayo Clinic. Based on a detailed analysis
of the drinking habits and body mass index (BMI) for 8,236 non-
smokers, they concluded that moderate drinkers (up to five drinks
per week) are 46 percent less likely than either abstainers or alco-
hol abusers to end up obese.
Their final word, in their report in BMC Public Health, an online med-
ical journal that publishes original peer-reviewed research articles,
is this: “The evidence reported here argues against a strategy of
promoting complete abstention at least among those who regularly
consume alcohol.”
People who don’t already drink shouldn’t start drinking to control
their weight. But you know that.
Chapter 18: Ten (or so) Health Benefits of Moderate Drinking 315

Countering the Common Cold
Sometimes you have to wonder whether researchers really have
enough to do. With all the health problems humans face, did they
actually need to study the relationship between beverage alcohol
and the common cold?
Heck, why not.
Seeking to test the idea that smoking and/or drinking makes a
person more susceptible to viral infections, five scientists at the
Department of Psychology at Carnegie Mellon University in
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, exposed 391 volunteers to one of five 
different respiratory viruses (a control group of 26 volunteers was
exposed to plain saltwater). Then the researchers sat back to see
who got a cold.
Soon enough, they discovered that smokers had a higher risk of
getting a cold than did nonsmokers. But nonsmokers who drank
were less likely than smokers to end up sneezing. In the words of
the researchers, “moderate drinkers have been found to be more
resistant than abstainers to five strains of the common cold virus.”
Compared to abstainers, the resistance was lowered
 85 percent for people who consumed two to three drinks a day
 65 percent for people who consumed one to two drinks a day
 30 percent for people who consumed less than one drink a day

The other side of the glass
The term alcohol abuse usually means drinking so much so frequently that it 
interferes with the ability to live a normal, productive life. Alcohol abuse is also 
hazardous to your health because it’s a serious risk factor for liver damage, high
blood pressure, and cancer of the esophagus and stomach, not to mention injury,
violence, and death from accidents. In addition, for some people, even moderate
amounts of alcohol may be too much. The obvious examples are young people; preg-
nant women; people taking medicines, such as sedatives, that interact with alcohol;
and those who plan to participate in sports or an activity — such as filling out tax
forms — that requires really clear thinking. As for drinking and driving, fuggedab-
boudit. Period.
