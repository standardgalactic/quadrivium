addition, a number of problems can be found 
at the end of each chapter and solutions are 
provided at the end of the book. You can use 
these end-of-chapter problems to check your 
understanding and also to give you some 
experience of the ‘short answer’ questions 
used in most in-course assessments. For good 
measure, we have included 80 revision problems 
in Appendix 2. 
At the end of the book you will find 22 sample 
coursework assignments. These should 
give you plenty of ‘food for thought’ as 
well as offering you some scope for further 
experimentation. It is not envisaged that you 
should complete all of these assignments, and a 
carefully chosen selection will normally suffice. If 
you are following a formal course, your teacher or 
lecturer will explain how these should be tackled 
and how they can contribute to your course 
assessment. 
While the book assumes no previous knowledge 
of electronics, you need to be able to manipulate 
basic formulae and understand some simple 
trigonometry in order to follow the numerical 
examples. A study of mathematics to GCSE level 
(or equivalent) will normally be adequate to satisfy 
this requirement. However, for those who may 
need a refresher or have had previous problems 
with mathematics, Appendix 8 will provide you 
with the underpinning mathematical knowledge 
required. 
In the later chapters of the book, a number of 
representative circuits (with component values) 
have been included together with sufficient 
information to allow you to adapt and modify 
the circuits for your own use. These circuits can 
be used to form the basis of your own practical 
investigations or they can be combined together 
in more complex circuits. 
This is the book that I wish I had when I first 
started exploring electronics over half a century 
ago. In those days, transistors were only just 
making their debut and integrated circuits were 
completely unknown. Of course, since then much 
has changed but, despite all of the changes, the 
world of electronics remains a fascinating one. 
And, unlike most other advanced technological 
disciplines, electronics is still something that you 
can ‘do’ at home with limited resources and with 
a minimal outlay. A soldering iron, a multi-meter 
and a handful of components are all you need to 
get started. Except, of course, for some ideas to 
get you started – and that’s exactly where this 
book comes in! 
The book has been designed to help you 
understand how electronic circuits work. It 
will provide you with the basic underpinning 
knowledge necessary to appreciate the operation 
of a wide range of electronic circuits, including 
amplifiers, logic circuits, power supplies and 
oscillators. 
The book is ideal for people who are studying 
electronics for the first time at any level, including 
a wide range of school and college courses. It is 
equally well suited to those who may be returning 
to study or who may be studying independently 
as well as those who may need a quick refresher. 
The book has 19 chapters, each dealing with a 
particular topic, and ten appendices containing 
useful information. The approach is topic-based 
rather than syllabus-based and each major topic 
looks at a particular application of electronics. The 
relevant theory is introduced on a progressive 
basis and delivered in manageable chunks. 
In order to give you an appreciation of the solution 
of simple numerical problems related to the 
operation of basic circuits, worked examples 
have been liberally included within the text. In

This latest edition brings the book up to date 
with coverage of several important new topics, 
including the use of digital storage and sound 
card oscilloscopes, HDL/VHDL modelling of large-
scale logic systems and a completely new chapter 
devoted to the Raspberry Pi.
Finally, you can learn a great deal from building, 
testing and modifying simple circuits. To do 
this you will need access to a few basic tools 
and some minimal testing equipment. Your first 
purchase should be a simple multi-range meter, 
either digital or analogue. This instrument will 
allow you to measure the voltages and currents 
present so that you can compare them with the 
predicted values. If you are attending a formal 
course of instruction and have access to an 
electronics laboratory, do make full use of it!

Teachers can differentiate students’ work by 
mixing assignments from the two levels. In 
order to challenge students, minimal information 
should be given to students at the start of each 
assignment. The aim should be to give students 
‘food for thought’ and encourage them to 
develop their own solutions and interpretation of 
the topic.
Where this text is to be used to support formal 
teaching it is suggested that the chapters should 
be followed broadly in the order that they appear, 
with the notable exception of Chapter 13. Topics 
from this chapter should be introduced at an 
early stage in order to support formal lab work. 
Assuming a notional delivery time of 4.5 hours 
per week, the material contained in this book 
(together with supporting laboratory exercises 
and assignments) will require approximately two 
academic terms (i.e. 24 weeks) to deliver, in 
which the total of 90 hours of study time should 
be divided equally into theory (supported by 
problem solving) and practical (laboratory and 
assignment work). The recommended four or five 
assignments will require about 25–30 hours of 
student work to complete. 
When developing a teaching programme it is, of 
course, essential to check that you fully comply 
with the requirements of the awarding body 
concerning assessment and that the syllabus 
coverage is adequate.
The book is ideal for students following formal 
courses (e.g. GCSE, AS-, A-level, BTEC, City & 
Guilds, etc.) in schools, sixth-form colleges and 
further/higher education colleges. It is equally well 
suited for use as a text that can support distance 
or flexible learning and for those who may need a 
‘refresher’ before studying electronics at a higher 
level. 
While the book assumes little previous 
knowledge, students need to be able to 
manipulate basic formulae and understand 
some simple trigonometry to follow the numerical 
examples. A study of mathematics to GCSE level 
(or beyond) will normally be adequate to satisfy 
this requirement. However, an appendix has 
been added specifically to support students who 
may have difficulty with mathematics. Students 
will require a scientific calculator in order to 
tackle the end-of-chapter problems as well as 
the revision problems that appear at the end of 
the book.
We have also included 22 sample coursework 
assignments. These are open-ended and can be 
modified or extended to suit the requirements of 
the particular awarding body. The assignments 
have been divided into those that are broadly at 
Level 2 and those that are at Level 3. In order 
to give reasonable coverage of the subject, 
students should normally be expected to 
complete four or five of these assignments.

mains by removing the mains plug. If you have 
to make measurements or carry out adjustments 
on an item of working (or ‘live’) equipment, 
a useful precaution is that of using one hand 
only to perform the adjustment or to make the 
measurement. Your ‘spare’ hand should be placed 
safely away from contact with anything metal 
(including the chassis of the equipment which 
may, or may not, be earthed). 
The severity of electric shock depends upon 
several factors, including the magnitude of 
the current, whether it is alternating or direct 
current, and its precise path through the body. 
The magnitude of the current depends upon the 
voltage which is applied and the resistance of the 
body. The electrical energy developed in the body 
will depend upon the time for which the current 
flows. The duration of contact is also crucial in 
determining the eventual physiological effects of 
the shock. As a rough guide, and assuming that 
the voltage applied is from the 250 V, 50 Hz a.c. 
mains supply, the following effects are typical: 
When working on electronic circuits, personal 
safety (both yours and that of those around 
you) should be paramount in everything you do. 
Hazards can exist within many circuits – even 
those that, on the face of it, may appear to be 
totally safe. Inadvertent misconnection of a 
supply, incorrect earthing, reverse connection of 
a high-value electrolytic capacitor and incorrect 
component substitution can all result in serious 
hazards to personal safety as a consequence of 
fire, explosion or the generation of toxic fumes. 
Potential hazards can usually be easily recognized 
and it is well worth making yourself familiar with 
them, but perhaps the most important point to 
make is that electricity acts very quickly and you 
should always think carefully before working on 
circuits where mains or high voltages (i.e. those 
over 50 V or so) are present. Failure to observe 
this simple precaution can result in the very real 
risk of electric shock. 
Voltages in many items of electronic equipment, 
including all items which derive their power from 
the a.c. mains supply, are at a level which can 
cause sufficient current flow in the body to disrupt 
normal operation of the heart. The threshold will 
be even lower for anyone with a defective heart. 
Bodily contact with mains or high-voltage circuits 
can thus be lethal. The most critical path for 
electric current within the body (i.e. the one that is 
most likely to stop the heart) is that which exists 
from one hand to the other. The hand-to-foot path 
is also dangerous, but somewhat less so than the 
hand-to-hand path. 
So, before you start to work on an item of 
electronic equipment, it is essential not only to 
switch off, but to disconnect the equipment at the

It is important to note that the figures are 
quoted as a guide – there have been cases of 
lethal shocks resulting from contact with much 
lower voltages and at relatively small values of 
current. The upshot of all this is simply that any 
potential in excess of 50 V should be considered 
dangerous. Lesser potentials may, under unusual

Chapter summary
This chapter has been designed to provide you with the background 
knowledge required to help you understand the concepts introduced in the 
later chapters. If you have studied electrical science, electrical principles or 
electronics beyond school level then you will already be familiar with many 
of these concepts. If, on the other hand, you are returning to study or are a 
newcomer to electronics or electrical technology this chapter will help you 
get up to speed.

Example 1.2
The unit of electrical potential, the volt (V), is 
defined as the difference in potential between 
two points in a conductor which, when carrying a 
current of one amp (A), dissipates a power of one 
watt (W). Express the volt (V) in terms of joules (J) 
and coulombs (C).

Hence, one volt is equivalent to one joule per

Fundamental units
You will already know that the units that we now 
use to describe such things as length, mass and 
time are standardized within the International 
System of Units. This SI system is based upon 
the seven fundamental units (see Table 1.1).
Derived units
All other units are derived from these seven 
fundamental units. These derived units generally 
have their own names and those commonly 
encountered in electrical circuits are summarized 
in Table 1.2 together with the corresponding 
physical quantities.
If you find the exponent notation shown in Table 
1.2 a little confusing, just remember that V−1 is 
simply 1/V, s−1 is 1/s, m−2 is 1/m−2, and so on.
Example 1.1
The unit of flux density (the Tesla) is defined as 
the magnetic flux per unit area. Express this in 
terms of the fundamental units.
Solution
The SI unit of flux is the Weber (Wb). Area is 
directly proportional to length squared and, 
expressed in terms of the fundamental SI units, 
this is square metres (m2). Dividing the flux (Wb) 
by the area (m2) gives Wb/m2 or Wb m−2. Hence, 
in terms of the fundamental SI units, the Tesla is 
expressed in Wb m−2.

(b) There are 2π radians in one complete cycle. 
Thus there are 2π/4 or π/2 radians in one-quarter 
of a cycle.
Example 1.4
Express an angle of 215° in radians.
Solution
To convert from degrees to radians, divide by 
57.3. So 215° is equivalent to 215/57.3 = 3.75 
radians.
Example 1.5
Express an angle of 2.5 radians in degrees.
Solution
To convert from radians to degrees, multiply by 
57.3. Hence 2.5 radians is equivalent to 2.5 × 57.3 
= 143.25°.
Measuring angles
You might think it strange to be concerned with 
angles in electrical circuits. The reason is simply 
that, in analogue and a.c. circuits, signals are 
based on repetitive waves (often sinusoidal in 
shape). We can refer to a point on such a wave in 
one of two basic ways, either in terms of the time 
from the start of the cycle or in terms of the angle 
(a cycle starts at 0° and finishes as 360° (see 
Fig. 1.1)). In practice, it is often more convenient 
to use angles rather than time; however, the two 
methods of measurement are interchangeable 
and it’s important to be able to work in either of 
these units.
In electrical circuits, angles are measured in 
either degrees or radians (both of which are 
strictly dimensionless units). You will doubtless 
already be familiar with angular measure in 
degrees where one complete circular revolution 
is equivalent to an angular change of 360°. The 
alternative method of measuring angles, the 
radian, is defined somewhat differently. It is the 
angle subtended at the centre of a circle by an arc 
having length which is equal to the radius of the 
circle (see Fig. 1.2).
You may sometimes find that you need to 
convert from radians to degrees, and vice versa. 
A complete circular revolution is equivalent to 
a rotation of 360° or 2π radians (note that π is 
approximately equal to 3.142). Thus one radian is 
equivalent to 360/2π degrees (or approximately 
57.3°). Try to remember the following rules that 
will help you to convert angles expressed in 
degrees to radians and vice versa:
 
From degrees to radians, divide by 57.3.
 
From radians to degrees, multiply by 57.3.
Example 1.3
Express a quarter of a cycle revolution in terms of:
(a) degrees;
(b) radians.
Solution
(a) There are 360° in one complete cycle (i.e. one 
full revolution). Hence there are (360/4)° or 90° in 
one-quarter of a cycle.

Electrical units and symbols
Table 1.3 shows the units and symbols that are 
commonly encountered in electrical circuits. It is 
important to get to know these units and also be 
able to recognize their abbreviations and symbols. 
You will meet all of these units later in this 
chapter.
Multiples and sub-multiples
Unfortunately, many of the derived units are 
either too large or too small for convenient 
everyday use but we can make life a little easier 
by using a standard range of multiples and sub-
multiples (see Table 1.4).
Example 1.6
An indicator lamp requires a current of 0.075 A. 
Express this in mA.
Solution
You can express the current in mA (rather than 
in A) by simply moving the decimal point three 
places to the right. Hence 0.075 A is the same as 
75 mA.
Example 1.7
A medium-wave radio transmitter operates on a 
frequency of 1,495 kHz. Express its frequency in 
MHz.
Solution
To express the frequency in MHz rather than kHz 
we need to move the decimal point three places 
to the left. Hence 1,495 kHz is equivalent to 
1.495 MHz.
Example 1.8
Express the value of a 27,000 pF in μF.
Solution
To express the value in μF rather than pF we 
need to move the decimal point six places to the 
left. Hence 27,000 pF is equivalent to 0.027 μF 
(note that we have had to introduce an extra zero 
before the 2 and after the decimal point).

1  Electrical fundamentals

Solution
1 mA = 1 × 10−3 A thus 7.25 mA = 7.25 × 10−3 A.
Example 1.10
A voltage of 3.75 × 10−6 V appears at the input of 
an amplifier. Express this voltage in (a) V and (b) 
mV, using exponent notation.
Solution
(a) 1 × 10−6 V = 1 μV so 3.75 × 10−6 V = 3.75 μV.
(b) There are 1,000 μV in 1 mV so we must 
divide the previous result by 1,000 in order 
to express the voltage in mV. So 3.75 μV = 
0.00375 mV.
Multiplication and division using 
exponents
Exponent notation really comes into its own 
when values have to be multiplied or divided. 
When multiplying two values expressed 
using exponents, you simply need to add the 
exponents. Here’s an example:
(2 × 102) × (3 × 106) = (2 × 3) × 10(2+6) = 6 × 108
Similarly, when dividing two values which are 
expressed using exponents, you only need to 
subtract the exponents. As an example:
(4 × 106) ÷ ( 2 × 104) = 4/2 × 10(6−4) = 2 × 102
In either case it’s important to remember to 
specify the units, multiples and sub-multiples in 
which you are working (e.g. A, kΩ, mV, μF, etc.).
Example 1.11
A current of 3 mA flows in a resistance of 33 kΩ. 
Determine the voltage dropped across the 
resistor.
Solution
Voltage is equal to current multiplied by resistance 
(see page 7). Thus:
V = I × R = 3 mA × 33 kΩ
Expressing this using exponent notation gives:
V = (3 × 10−3) × (33 × 103) V
Separating the exponents gives:
V = 3 × 33 × 10−3 × 103 V
Thus V = 99 × 10(−3+3) = 99 × 100 = 99 × 1 = 99 V.
Exponent notation
Exponent notation (or scientific notation) is 
useful when dealing with either very small or very 
large quantities. It’s well worth getting to grips 
with this notation as it will allow you to simplify 
quantities before using them in formulae.
Exponents are based on powers of ten. To 
express a number in exponent notation the 
number is split into two parts. The first part is 
usually a number in the range 0.1 to 100 while the 
second part is a multiplier expressed as a power 
of ten.
For example, 251.7 can be expressed as 2.517 
× 100, i.e. 2.517 × 102. It can also be expressed 
as 0.2517 × 1,000, i.e. 0.2517 × 103. In both 
cases the exponent is the same as the number 
of noughts in the multiplier (i.e. 2 in the first case 
and 3 in the second case). To summarize:
251.7 = 2.517 × 102 = 0.2517 × 103
As a further example, 0.01825 can be expressed 
as 1.825/100, i.e. 1.825 × 10−2. It can also be 
expressed as 18.25/1,000, i.e. 18.25 × 10−3. 
Again, the exponent is the same as the number 
of noughts but the minus sign is used to denote a 
fractional multiplier. To summarize:
0.01825 = 1.825 × 10−2 = 18.25 × 10−3

north and south pole will attract. In the same way, 
the unlike charges of the negative electron and 
the positive proton experience a force of mutual 
attraction.
The outer shell electrons of a conductor can be 
reasonably easily interchanged between adjacent 
atoms within the lattice of atoms of which the 
substance is composed. This makes it possible 
for the material to conduct electricity. Typical 
examples of conductors are metals such as 
copper, silver, iron and aluminium. By contrast, 
the outer-shell electrons of an insulator are 
firmly bound to their parent atoms and virtually 
no interchange of electrons is possible. Typical 
examples of insulators are plastics, rubber and 
ceramic materials.
Voltage and resistance
The ability of an energy source (e.g. a battery) 
to produce a current within a conductor may 
be expressed in terms of electromotive force 
(e.m.f.). Whenever an e.m.f. is applied to a 
circuit a potential difference (p.d.) exists. Both 
e.m.f. and p.d. are measured in volts (V). In many 
practical circuits there is only one e.m.f. present 
(the battery or supply) whereas a p.d. will be 
developed across each component present in the 
circuit.
The conventional flow of current in a circuit is 
from the point of more positive potential to the 
point of greatest negative potential (note that 
Example 1.12
A current of 45 μA flows in a circuit. What charge 
is transferred in a time interval of 20 ms?
Solution
Charge is equal to current multiplied by time (see 
the definition of the ampere on page 4). Thus:
Q = I t = 45 μA × 20 ms
Expressing this in exponent notation gives:
Q = (45 × 10−6) × (20 × 10−3) coulomb
Separating the exponents gives:
Q = 45 × 20 × 10−6 × 10−3 coulomb
Thus Q = 900 × 10(−6−3) = 900 × l0−9 = 900 nC
Example 1.13
A power of 300 mW is dissipated in a circuit when 
a voltage of 1,500 V is applied. Determine the 
current supplied to the circuit.
Solution
Current is equal to power divided by voltage (see 
page 9). Thus:
I = P / V = 300 mW / 1,500 V amperes
Expressing this in exponent notation gives:
I = (300 × 10−3)/(1.5 × 103) A
Separating the exponents gives:
I = (300/1.5) × (10−3/103 ) A
I = 300/1.5 × 10−3 × 10−3 A
Thus, I = 200 × 10(−3−3) = 200 × 10−6 = 200 μA
Conductors and insulators
Electric current is the name given to the flow of 
electrons (or negative charge carriers). Electrons 
orbit around the nucleus of atoms just as the Earth 
orbits around the sun (see Fig. 1.3). Electrons 
are held in one or more shells, constrained to 
their orbital paths by virtue of a force of attraction 
towards the nucleus which contains an equal 
number of protons (positive charge carriers). 
Since like charges repel and unlike charges attract, 
negatively charged electrons are attracted to the 
positively charged nucleus. A similar principle 
can be demonstrated by observing the attraction 
between two permanent magnets; the two north 
poles of the magnets will repel each other, while a

The formula may be arranged to make V, I or R 
the subject, as follows:
V = I × R, I = V / R and R = V / I
The triangle shown in Fig. 1.5 should help you 
remember these three important relationships. 
However, it’s worth noting that, when performing 
calculations of currents, voltages and resistances 
in practical circuits it is seldom necessary to 
work with an accuracy of better than ±1% simply 
because component tolerances are usually 
greater than this. Furthermore, in calculations 
involving Ohm’s Law, it can sometimes be 
convenient to work in units of kΩ and mA (or MΩ 
and μA) in which case potential differences will be 
expressed directly in V.
Example 1.14
A 12 Ω resistor is connected to a 6 V battery. 
What current will flow in the resistor?
Solution
Here we must use I = V / R (where V = 6 V and R 
= 12 Ω):
I = V / R = 6 V / 12 Ω = 0.5 A (or 500 mA)
Hence a current of 500 mA will flow in the 
resistor.
Example 1.15
A current of 100 mA flows in a 56 Ω resistor. 
What voltage drop (potential difference) will be 
developed across the resistor?
electrons move in the opposite direction!). Direct 
current results from the application of a direct 
e.m.f. (derived from batteries or a d.c. power 
supply). An essential characteristic of these 
supplies is that the applied e.m.f. does not change 
its polarity (even though its value might be subject 
to some fluctuation).
For any conductor, the current flowing is directly 
proportional to the e.m.f. applied. The current 
flowing will also be dependent on the physical 
dimensions (length and cross-sectional area) and 
material of which the conductor is composed. 
The amount of current that will flow in a 
conductor when a given e.m.f. is applied 
is inversely proportional to its resistance. 
Resistance, therefore, may be thought of as 
an opposition to current flow; the higher the 
resistance the lower the current that will flow 
(assuming that the applied e.m.f. remains 
constant).
Ohm’s Law
Provided that temperature does not vary, the 
ratio of p.d. across the ends of a conductor to the 
current flowing in the conductor is a constant. 
This relationship is known as Ohm’s Law and it 
leads to the relationship:
V / I = a constant = R
where V is the potential difference (or voltage 
drop) in volts (V), I is the current in amperes (A), 
and R is the resistance in ohms (Ω) (see Fig. 1.4).

relationship between voltage (V ), current (I )

specific resistance). Resistivity is defined as the 
resistance measured between the opposite faces 
of a cube having sides of 1 cm.
The resistance, R, of a conductor is thus given by 
the formula:
R = ρ × l / A
where R is the resistance (ft), ρ is the resistivity 
(Ωm), l is the length (m) and A is the area (m2).
Table 1.5 shows the electrical properties of some 
common metals.
Example 1.17
A coil consists of an 8 m length of annealed 
copper wire having a cross-sectional area of 
1 mm2. Determine the resistance of the coil.
Solution
We will use the formula R = ρ l / A. 
The value of ρ for annealed copper given in Table 
1.5 is 1.724 × 10−8 Ωm. The length of the wire is 
4 m while the area is 1 mm2 or 1 × 10−6 m2 (note 
that it is important to be consistent in using units 
of metres for length and square metres for area). 
Hence the resistance of the coil will be given by:

Thus R = 13.792 × 10−2 or 0.13792 Ω.
Solution
Here we must use V = I × R and ensure that 
we work in units of volts (V), amperes (A) and 
ohms (Ω).
V = I × R = 0.1 A × 56 Ω = 5.6 V
(Note that 100 mA is the same as 0.1 A.)
This calculation shows that a p.d. of 5.6 V will be 
developed across the resistor.
Example 1.16
A voltage drop of 15 V appears across a resistor in
which a current of 1 mA flows. What is the value 
of the resistance?
Solution
R = V / I = 15 V / 0.001 A = 15,000 Ω = 15 kΩ
Note that it is often more convenient to work in 
units of mA and V, which will produce an answer 
directly in kΩ, i.e.
R = V / I = 15 V / 1 mA = 15 kΩ
Resistance and resistivity
The resistance of a metallic conductor is 
directly proportional to its length and inversely 
proportional to its area. The resistance is 
also directly proportional to its resistivity (or

P = I × P, I = P / V and V = P / I
The triangle shown in Fig. 1.6 should help you 
remember these relationships.
The relationship, P = I × V, may be combined 
with that which results from Ohm’s Law 
(V = I × R  ) to produce two further relationships. 
First, substituting for V gives:
P = I × (I × R  ) = I 2 R
Second, substituting for I gives:
P = (V / R  ) × V = V 2 / R
Example 1.19
A current of 1.5 A is drawn from a 3 V battery. 
What power is supplied? 
Solution
Here we must use P = I × V (where I = 1.5 A and 
V = 3 V).
P = I × V = 1.5 A × 3 V = 4.5 W 
Hence a power of 4.5 W is supplied.
Example 1.20
A voltage drop of 4 V appears across a resistor of 
100 Ω. What power is dissipated in the resistor?
Solution
Here we use P = V 2 / R (where V = 4 V and 
R = 100 Ω).
P = V 2 / R = (4 V × 4 V) / 100 Ω = 0.16 W
Hence the resistor dissipates a power of 0.16 W 
(or 160 mW).
Example 1.18
A wire having a resistivity of 1.724 × 10−8 Ωm, 
length 20 m and cross-sectional area 1 mm2 
carries a current of 5 A. Determine the voltage 
drop between the ends of the wire.
Solution
First we must find the resistance of the wire (as 
in Example 1.17):

The voltage drop can now be calculated using 
Ohm’s Law:

This calculation shows that a potential of 1.6 V will 
be dropped between the ends of the wire.
Energy and power
At first you may be a little confused about 
the difference between energy and power. 
Put simply, energy is the ability to do work 
while power is the rate at which work is done. 
In electrical circuits, energy is supplied by 
batteries or generators. It may also be stored in 
components such as capacitors and inductors. 
Electrical energy is converted into various other 
forms of energy by components such as resistors 
(producing heat), loudspeakers (producing sound 
energy) and light emitting diodes (producing light).
The unit of energy is the joule (J). Power is the 
rate of use of energy and it is measured in watts 
(W). A power of 1 W results from energy being 
used at the rate of 1 J per second. Thus:
P = W / t
where P is the power in watts (W), W is the 
energy in joules (J) and t is the time in seconds 
(s).
The power in a circuit is equivalent to the product 
of voltage and current. Hence:
P = I × V
where P is the power in watts (W), I is the current 
in amperes (A) and V is the voltage in volts (V).
The formula may be arranged to make P, I or V 
the subject, as follows:

Electric fields
The force exerted on a charged particle is a 
manifestation of the existence of an electric 
field. The electric field defines the direction and 
magnitude of a force on a charged object. The 
field itself is invisible to the human eye but can 
be drawn by constructing lines which indicate the 
motion of a free positive charge within the field; 
the number of field lines in a particular region is 
used to indicate the relative strength of the field 
at the point in question.
Figs 1.7 and 1.8 show the electric fields between 
charges of the same and opposite polarity while 
Fig. 1.9 shows the field which exists between 
two charged parallel plates. You will see more of 
this particular arrangement when we introduce 
capacitors in Chapter 2.
Electric field strength
The strength of an electric field (E ) is proportional 
to the applied potential difference and inversely 
proportional to the distance between the two 
conductors. The electric field strength is given by:
E = V / d
where E is the electric field strength (V/m), V is 
the applied potential difference (V) and d is the 
distance (m).
 
Example 1.21
A current of 20 mA flows in a 1 kΩ resistor. What 
power is dissipated in the resistor?
Solution
Here we use P = I 2 × R but, to make life a little 
easier, we will work in mA and kΩ (in which case 
the answer will be in mW).
P = I 2 × R = (20 mA × 20 mA) × 1 kΩ = 
400 mW
Thus a power of 400 mW is dissipated in the 1 kΩ 
resistor.
Electrostatics
If a conductor has a deficit of electrons, it will 
exhibit a net positive charge. If, on the other 
hand, it has a surplus of electrons, it will exhibit a 
net negative charge. An imbalance in charge can 
be produced by friction (removing or depositing 
electrons using materials such as silk and 
fur, respectively) or induction (by attracting or 
repelling electrons using a second body which is, 
respectively, positively or negatively charged).
Force between charges
Coulomb’s Law states that if charged bodies 
exist at two points, the force of attraction (if the 
charges are of opposite polarity) or repulsion 
(if the charges have the same polarity) will be 
proportional to the product of the magnitude 
of the charges divided by the square of their 
distance apart. Thus:

to have a very high value of resistivity (they must 
not conduct charge) coupled with an ability to 
withstand high voltages without breaking down. 
A more practical arrangement is shown in 
Fig. 1.10. In this arrangement the ratio of charge, 
Q, to potential difference, V, is given by the 
relationship:

where A is the surface area of the plates (in m2), 
d is the separation (in m) and ε is a constant for

referred to as the dielectric constant).
The absolute permittivity of a dielectric material 
is the product of the permittivity of free space (ε0) 
and the relative permittivity (εr) of the material.

The dielectric strength of an insulating dielectric

relative permittivity and dielectric strength for 
some common dielectric materials.
Electromagnetism
When a current flows through a conductor a 
magnetic field is produced in the vicinity of the 
conductor. The magnetic field is invisible but

Permittivity
The amount of charge produced on the two plates 
shown in Fig. 1.9 for a given applied voltage will 
depend not only on the physical dimensions 
but also on the insulating dielectric material that 
appears between the plates. Such materials need

Magnetic fields
The field surrounding a straight current-carrying 
conductor is shown in Fig. 1.11. The magnetic 
field defines the direction of motion of a free 
north pole within the field. In the case of Fig. 1.11, 
the lines of flux are concentric and the direction 
of the field (determined by the direction of current 
flow) is given by the right-hand rule.
Magnetic field strength
The strength of a magnetic field is a measure of 
the density of the flux at any particular point. In 
the case of Fig. 1.11, the field strength will be 
proportional to the applied current and inversely 
proportional to the perpendicular distance from 
the conductor. Thus:
=
B
kI
d
where B is the magnetic flux density (in tesla), I 
is the current (in amperes), d is the distance from 
the conductor (in metres) and k is a constant.
Assuming that the medium is vacuum or ‘free 
space’, the density of the magnetic flux will be 
given by:
its presence can be detected using a compass 
needle (which will deflect from its normal north–
south position). If two current-carrying conductors 
are placed in the vicinity of one another, the fields 
will interact with one another and the conductors 
will experience a force of attraction or repulsion 
(depending upon the relative direction of the two 
currents).
Force between two current-
carrying conductors
The mutual force which exists between two 
parallel current-carrying conductors will be 
proportional to the product of the currents in the 
two conductors and the length of the conductors, 
but inversely proportional to their separation. 
Thus:

Thus B = 80 × 10−6 T or B = 80 μT.
Example 1.24
A flux density of 2.5 mT is developed in free 
space over an area of 20 cm2. Determine the total 
flux.
Solution
Re-arranging the formula B = Φ / A to make Φ the 
subject gives Φ = B × A, thus:
Φ = (2.5 × 10−3) × (20 × 10−4) = 50 × 10−7 webers
from which B = 5 μWb.
Magnetic circuits
Materials such as iron and steel possess 
considerably enhanced magnetic properties. 
Hence they are employed in applications where it 
is necessary to increase the flux density produced 
by an electric current. In effect, magnetic 
materials allow us to channel the electric flux into 
a ‘magnetic circuit’, as shown in Fig. 1.14.

the magnetic core is analogous to the resistance

where B is the flux density (in tesla), μ0 is the 
permeability of ‘free space’ (4π × 10−7 or 12.57

distance from the centre of the conductor (in 
metres).
The flux density is also equal to the total flux 
divided by the area of the field. Thus:
B = Φ / A
where Φ is the flux (in webers) and A is the area 
of the field (in square metres).
In order to increase the strength of the field, a 
conductor may be shaped into a loop (Fig. 1.12) 
or coiled to form a solenoid (Fig. 1.13). Note, in 
the latter case, how the field pattern is exactly the 
same as that which surrounds a bar magnet.
Example 1.23
Determine the flux density produced at a distance 
of 50 mm from a straight wire carrying a current 
of 20 A.

present in the electric circuit shown in Fig. 1.14(a). 
We can make the following comparisons between 
the two types of circuit (see Table 1.7).
In practice, not all of the magnetic flux produced 
in a magnetic circuit will be concentrated within 
the core and some ‘leakage flux’ will appear in the 
surrounding free space (as shown in Fig. 1.15). 
Similarly, if a gap appears within the magnetic 
circuit, the flux will tend to spread out as shown 
in Fig. 1.16. This effect is known as ‘fringing’.
Reluctance and permeability

proportional to its length and inversely 
proportional to its area. The reluctance is 
also inversely proportional to the absolute 
permeability of the magnetic material. Thus:

path (in metres).
B–H curves
Fig. 1.17 shows four typical B–H (flux density 
plotted against permeability) curves for some 
common magnetic materials. If you look carefully 
at these curves you will notice that they flatten off 
due to magnetic saturation and that the slope of 
the curve (indicating the value of μ corresponding 
to a particular value of H ) falls as the magnetizing 
force increases. This is important since it dictates 
the acceptable working range for a particular 
magnetic material when used in a magnetic circuit.
Example 1.25
Estimate the relative permeability of cast steel 
(see Fig. 1.18) at (a) a flux density of 0.6 T and (b) 
a flux density of 1.6 T.
Solution
From Fig. 1.18, the slope of the graph at any 
point gives the value of μ at that point. We can 
easily find the slope by constructing a tangent at

Circuit diagrams
Finally, and just in case you haven’t seen them 
before, we will end this chapter with a brief word 
about circuit diagrams. We are introducing the 
topic here because it’s quite important to be able 
to read and understand simple electronic circuit 
diagrams before you can make sense of some of 
the components and circuits that you will meet 
later.
Circuit diagrams use standard symbols and 
conventions to represent the components and 
wiring used in an electronic circuit. Visually, they 
bear very little relationship to the physical layout 
of a circuit but, instead, they provide us with a 
‘theoretical’ view of the circuit. In this section 
we show you how to find your way round simple 
circuit diagrams.
To be able to understand a circuit diagram you 
first need to be familiar with the symbols that are 
used to represent the components and devices. 
A selection of some of the most commonly 
used symbols are shown later, in Fig. 1.24. 
It’s important to be aware that there are a few 
(thankfully quite small) differences between the 
symbols used in circuit diagrams of American and 
European origin. 
As a general rule, the input to a circuit should be 
shown on the left of a circuit diagram and the 
output shown on the right. The supply (usually 
the most positive voltage) is normally shown 
at the top of the diagram and the common, 
0 V, or ground connection, is normally shown 
at the bottom. This rule is not always obeyed, 
particularly for complex diagrams where many 
signals and supply voltages may be present. 
Note also that, in order to simplify a circuit 
diagram (and avoid having too many lines 
connected to the same point) multiple 
connections to common, 0 V, or ground may 
be shown using the appropriate symbol 
(see Fig. 1.24). The same applies to supply 
the point in question and then finding the ratio of 
vertical change to horizontal change.
(a)	The slope of the graph at 0.6 T is 0.6/800 = 
0.75 × 10−3
	
Since μ = μ0 × μr , μr = μ / μ0 = 0.75 × 10−3/ 
12.57 × 10−7, thus μr = 597 at 0.6 T.
(b)	The slope of the graph at 1.6 T is 0.2/4,000 = 
0.05 × 10−3
	
Since μ = μ0 × μr , μr = μ / μ0 = 0.05 × 10−3/ 
12.57 × 10−7, thus μr = 39.8 at 1.6 T.
NB: This example clearly shows the effect of 
saturation on the permeability of a magnetic 
material!
Example 1.26
A coil of 800 turns is wound on a closed mild steel 
core having a length 600 mm and cross-sectional 
area 500 mm2. Determine the current required to 
establish a flux of 0.8 mWb in the core.
Solution
Now B = Φ /A = (0.8 × 10−3) / (500 × 10−6) = 1.6 T
From Fig. 1.17, a flux density of 1.6 T will occur in 
mild steel when H = 3,500 A/m. The current can

connections that may be repeated (appropriately 
labelled) at various points in the diagram. 
A very simple circuit diagram (a simple resistance 
tester) is shown in Fig. 1.19. This circuit may be 
a little daunting if you haven’t met a circuit like 
it before, but you can still glean a great deal of 
information from the diagram even if you don’t 
know what the individual components do.
The circuit uses two batteries, B1 (a 9 V multi-cell 
battery) and B2 (a 1.5 V single-cell battery). The 
two batteries are selected by means of a double-
pole, double-throw (DPDT) switch. This allows the 
circuit to operate from either the 9 V battery (B1) 
as shown in Fig. 1.19(a) or from the 1.5 V battery 
(B2) as shown in Fig. 1.19(b), depending on the 
setting of S1. 
A variable resistor, VR1, is used to adjust the 
current supplied by whichever of the two 
batteries is currently selected. This current flows 
first through VR1, then through the milliammeter, 
and finally through the unknown resistor, RX. 
Notice how the meter terminals are labelled 
showing their polarity (the current flows into the 
positive terminal and out of the negative terminal).
The circuit shown in Fig. 1.19(c) uses a different 
type of switch but provides exactly the same 
function. In this circuit a single-pole, double-
throw (SPDT) switch is used and the negative 
connections to the two batteries are ‘commoned’ 
(i.e. connected directly together). 
Finally, Fig. 1.19(d) shows how the circuit can be 
re-drawn using a common ‘chassis’ connection 
to provide the negative connection between RX 
and the two batteries. Electrically this circuit is 
identical to the one shown in Fig. 1.19(c).

CHAPTER
Passive components
Chapter summary
This chapter introduces several of the most common types of electronic 
component, including resistors, capacitors and inductors. These are often 
referred to as passive components as they cannot, by themselves, generate 
voltage or current. An understanding of the characteristics and application 
of passive components is an essential prerequisite to understanding the 
operation of the circuits used in amplifiers, oscillators, filters and power 
supplies.

Preferred values
The value marked on the body of a resistor is 
not its exact resistance. Some minor variation in 
resistance value is inevitable due to production 
tolerance. For example, a resistor marked 100 Ω 
and produced within a tolerance of ±10% will 
have a value which falls within the range 90 Ω 
to 110 Ω. A similar component with a tolerance 
of ±1% would have a value that falls within the 
range 99 Ω to 101 Ω. Thus, where accuracy is 
important it is essential to use close tolerance 
components.
Resistors are available in several series of fixed 
decade values, the number of values provided 
with each series being governed by the tolerance 
involved. In order to cover the full range of 
resistance values using resistors having a ±20% 
tolerance it will be necessary to provide six basic 
values (known as the E6 series). More values 
will be required in the series which offers a 
tolerance of ±10% and consequently the E12 
series provides 12 basic values. The E24 series 
for resistors of ±5% tolerance provides no fewer 
than 24 basic values and, as with the E6 and E12 
series, decade multiples (i.e. × 1, × 10, × 100, × 
1 k, × 10 k, × 100 k and × 1 M) of the basic series. 
Fig. 2.3 shows the relationship between the E6, 
E12 and E24 series.
Power ratings
Resistor power ratings are related to operating 
temperatures and resistors should be derated at 
high temperatures. Where reliability is important 
Resistors
The notion of resistance as opposition to 
current was discussed in the previous chapter. 
Conventional forms of resistor obey a straight 
line law when voltage is plotted against 
current (see Fig. 2.1) and this allows us to use 
resistors as a means of converting current into a 
corresponding voltage drop, and vice versa (note 
that doubling the applied current will produce 
double the voltage drop, and so on). Therefore 
resistors provide us with a means of controlling 
the currents and voltages present in electronic 
circuits. They can also act as loads to simulate 
the presence of a circuit during testing (e.g. a 
suitably rated resistor can be used to replace a 
loudspeaker when an audio amplifier is being 
tested).
The specifications for a resistor usually include 
the value of resistance expressed in ohms (Ω), 
kilohms (kΩ) or megohms (MΩ), the accuracy or 
tolerance (quoted as the maximum permissible 
percentage deviation from the marked value) 
and the power rating (which must be equal to, 
or greater than, the maximum expected power 
dissipation).
Other practical considerations when selecting 
resistors for use in a particular application include 
temperature coefficient, noise performance, 
stability and ambient temperature range. Table 
2.1 summarizes the properties of five of the most 
common types of resistor. Fig. 2.2 shows a typical 
selection of fixed resistors with values from 15 Ω 
to 4.7 kΩ.

Figure 2.3  The E6, E12 and E24 series
resistors should be operated at well below their 
nominal maximum power dissipation.
Example 2.1
A resistor has a marked value of 220 Ω. 
Determine the tolerance of the resistor if it has a 
measured value of 207 Ω.
Solution
The difference between the marked and 
measured values of resistance (the error) is 
(220 Ω − 207 Ω) = 13 Ω. The tolerance is given by:

Tolerance

The tolerance is thus (13 / 220) × 100 = 5.9%.
Example 2.2
A 9 V power supply is to be tested with a 39 Ω 
load resistor. If the resistor has a tolerance of 
10% find:
(a)	the nominal current taken from the supply;
(b)	the maximum and minimum values of supply 
current at either end of the tolerance range for 
the resistor.

25
Example 2.4
A resistor is marked with the following coloured 
stripes: brown, black, red, silver. What is its value 
and tolerance?
Solution
See Fig. 2.6.
Solution
(a)  If a resistor of exactly 39 Ω is used the current 
will be:
I = V / R = 9 V / 39 Ω = 231 mA
(b)  The lowest value of resistance would be 
(39 Ω − 3.9 Ω) = 35.1 Ω. In which case the 
current would be:
I = V / R = 9 V / 35.1 Ω = 256.4 mA
 At the other extreme, the highest value would 
be (39 Ω + 3.9 Ω) = 42.9 Ω.
In this case the current would be:
I = V / R = 9 V / 42.9 Ω = 209.8 mA
The maximum and minimum values of supply 
current will thus be 256.4 mA and 209.8 mA, 
respectively.
Example 2.3
A current of 100 mA (±20%) is to be drawn from 
a 28 V d.c. supply. What value and type of resistor 
should be used in this application?
Solution
The value of resistance required must first be 
calculated using Ohm’s Law:
R = V / I = 28 V / 100 mA = 280 Ω
The nearest preferred value from the E12 series 
is 270 Ω (which will actually produce a current of 
103.7 mA (i.e. within ±4% of the desired value). If 
a resistor of ±10% tolerance is used, current will 
be within the range 94 mA to 115 mA (well within 
the ±20% accuracy specified). 
The power dissipated in the resistor (calculated 
using P = I × V ) will be 2.9 W and thus a 
component rated at 3 W (or more) will be required. 
This would normally be a vitreous enamel-coated 
wirewound resistor (see Table 2.1).
Resistor markings
Carbon and metal oxide resistors are normally 
marked with colour codes which indicate their 
value and tolerance. Two methods of colour 
coding are in common use; one involves four 
coloured bands (see Fig. 2.4) while the other uses 
five colour bands (see Fig. 2.5).

Series and parallel combinations of 
resistors
In order to obtain a particular value of resistance, 
fixed resistors may be arranged in either series or 
parallel as shown in Figs 2.10 and 2.11.
The effective resistance of each of the series 
circuits shown in Fig. 2.10 is simply equal to the 
sum of the individual resistances. So, for the 
circuit shown in Fig. 2.10(a):
R = R1 + R2
while for Fig. 2.10(b)
R = R1 + R2 + R3
Turning to the parallel resistors shown in Fig. 2.11, 
the reciprocal of the effective resistance of each 
circuit is equal to the sum of the reciprocals of the 
individual resistances. Hence, for Fig. 2.11(a):

Some types of resistor have markings based 
on a system of coding defined in BS 1852. 
This system involves marking the position of 
the decimal point with a letter to indicate the 
multiplier concerned, as shown in Table 2.2. A 
further letter is then ­app­ended to indicate the

Example 2.13
Determine the effective resistance of the circuit 
shown in Fig. 2.12.
Solution
The circuit can be progressively simplified 
as shown in Fig. 2.13. The stages in this 
simplification are:
(a) R3 and R4 are in series and they can be 
replaced by a single resistance (RA) of (12 Ω + 
27 Ω) = 39 Ω.
(b) RA appears in parallel with R2. These two 
resistors can be replaced by a single 
resistance (RB) of (39 Ω × 47 Ω)/(39 Ω + 47 Ω) = 
21.3 Ω.
(c) RB appears in series with R1. These two 
resistors can be replaced by a single 
resistance (R) of (21.3 Ω + 4.7 Ω) = 26 Ω.

The resistance of a carbon conductor falls with 
temperature and it is therefore said to exhibit a 
negative temperature coefficient (NTC).
The resistance of a conductor at a temperature, t, 
is given by the equation:
Rt = R0(1 + α t + β t2 + γ t3 ...)
where α, β, γ, etc. are constants and R0 is the 
resistance at 0 °C.
The coefficients, β, γ, etc. are quite small and 
since we are normally only dealing with a 
relatively restricted temperature range (e.g. 
0 °C to 100 °C) we can usually approximate the 
characteristic shown in Fig. 2.14 to the straight 
line law shown in Fig. 2.15. In this case the 
equation simplifies to:
Rt = R0(1 + αt )
where α is known as the temperature 
coefficient of resistance. Table 2.4 shows some 
typical values for α (note that α is expressed 
in Ω/Ω/°C or just /°C).

Example 2.15
A resistor has a temperature coefficient of 
0.001/°C. If the resistor has a resistance of 1.5 kΩ 
at 0 °C, determine its resistance at 80 °C.
Solution
Now
Rt = R0(1 + αt ) 
thus
Rt = 1.5 kΩ × (1 + (0.001 × 80)
Hence
Rt = 1.5 × 1.08 = 1.62 k Ω
resistors will satisfy this requirement? What 
power rating should each resistor have?
Solution
Two 100 Ω resistors may be wired in parallel to 
provide a resistance of 50 Ω as shown below:

Note from this that when two resistors of the 
same value are connected in parallel the resulting 
resistance will be half that of a single resistor.
Having shown that two 100 Ω resistors connected 
in parallel will provide us with a resistance of 50 Ω 
we now need to consider the power rating. Since 
the resistors are identical, the applied power will 
be shared equally between them. Hence each 
resistor should have a power rating of 1 W.
Resistance and temperature
Fig. 2.14 shows how the resistance of a metal 
conductor (e.g. copper) varies with temperature. 
Since the resistance of the material increases 
with temperature, this characteristic is said to 
exhibit a positive temperature coefficient 
(PTC). Not all materials have a PTC characteristic.

Thermistors
With conventional resistors we would normally 
require resistance to remain the same over a wide 
range of temperatures (i.e. α should be zero). On 
the other hand, there are applications in which 
we could use the effect of varying resistance to 
detect a temperature change. Components that 
allow us to do this are known as thermistors. The 
resistance of a thermistor changes markedly with 
temperature and these components are widely 
used in temperature sensing and temperature 
compensating applications. Two basic types 
of thermistor are available, NTC and PTC 
(see Fig. 2.16).
Typical NTC thermistors have resistances 
that vary from a few hundred (or thousand) 
ohms at 25 °C to a few tens (or hundreds) of 
ohms at 100 °C. PTC thermistors, on the other 
hand, usually have a resistance–temperature 
characteristic which remains substantially flat 
(typically at around 100 Ω) over the range 0 °C 
to around 75 °C. Above this, and at a critical 
temperature (usually in the range 80 °C to 120 °C) 
Example 2.16
A resistor has a temperature coefficient of 
0.0005/°C. If the resistor has a resistance of 680 Ω 
at 20 °C, what will its resistance be at 80 °C?

First we must find the resistance at 0 °C.

Light-dependent resistors
Light-dependent resistors (LDRs) use a 
semiconductor material (i.e. a material that is 
neither a conductor nor an insulator) whose 
electrical characteristics vary according to the 
amount of incident light. The two semiconductor 
materials used for the manufacture of LDRs are 
cadmium sulphide (CdS) and cadmium selenide 
(CdSe). These materials are most sensitive to light 
in the visible spectrum, peaking at about 0.6 µm 
for CdS and 0.75 µm for CdSe. A typical CdS LDR 
exhibits a resistance of around 1 MΩ in complete 
darkness and less than 1 kΩ when placed under a 
bright light source (see Fig. 2.17).
Voltage-dependent resistors
The resistance of a voltage-dependent resistor 
(VDR) falls very rapidly when the voltage across 
it exceeds a nominal value in either direction 
(see Fig. 2.18). In normal operation, the current 
flowing in a VDR is negligible; however, when 
the resistance falls, the current will become 
appreciable and a significant amount of energy 
will be absorbed. VDRs are used as a means 
of ‘clamping’ the voltage in a circuit to a pre-
determined level. When connected across the 
supply rails to a circuit (either a.c or d.c.) they 
are able to offer a measure of protection against 
voltage surges.
Figure 2.16 Characteristics of (a) NTC and 
(b) PTC thermistors
their resistance rises very rapidly to values of up 
to, and beyond, 10 kΩ (see Fig. 2.16).
A typical application of PTC thermistors is 
over-current protection. Provided the current 
passing through the thermistor remains below 
the threshold current, the effects of self-heating 
will remain negligible and the resistance of the 
thermistor will remain low (i.e. approximately the 
same as the resistance quoted at 25 °C). Under 
fault conditions, the current exceeds the threshold 
value by a considerable margin and the thermistor 
starts to self-heat. The resistance then increases 
rapidly and, as a consequence, the current falls to 
the rest value. Typical values of threshold and rest 
currents are 200 mA and 8 mA, respectively, for 
a device which exhibits a nominal resistance of 
25 Ω at 25 °C.

of preset resistor are commonly used including 
open carbon track skeleton presets and fully 
encapsulated carbon and multi-turn cermet types, 
as shown in Fig. 2.21.
Capacitors
A capacitor is a device for storing electric charge. 
In effect, it is a reservoir into which charge can 
be deposited and then later extracted. Typical 
applications include reservoir and smoothing 
capacitors for use in power supplies, coupling 
a.c. signals between the stages of amplifiers, 
and decoupling supply rails (i.e. effectively 
grounding the supply rails as far as a.c. signals are 
concerned).
A capacitor can consist of nothing more than 
two parallel metal plates as shown in Fig. 1.10 
on page 11. To understand what happens when 
a capacitor is being charged and discharged 
take a look at Fig. 2.22. If the switch is left open 
(position A), no charge will appear on the plates 
and in this condition there will be no electric field 
Variable resistors
Variable resistors are available in several forms 
including those which use carbon tracks and 
those which use a wirewound resistance 
element. In either case, a moving slider makes 
contact with the resistance element. Most 
variable resistors have three (rather than two) 
terminals and as such are more correctly known 
as potentiometers. Carbon potentiometers are 
available with linear or semi-logarithmic law tracks 
(see Fig. 2.19) and in rotary or slider formats. 
Ganged controls, in which several potentiometers 
are linked together by a common control shaft, 
are also available. Fig. 2.20 shows a selection of 
variable resistors.
You will also encounter various forms of preset 
resistors that are used to make occasional 
adjustments (e.g. for calibration). Various forms

in the space between the plates nor will there be 
any charge stored in the capacitor.
When the switch is moved to position B, 
electrons will be attracted from the positive plate 
to the positive terminal of the battery. At the 
same time, a similar number of electrons will 
move from the negative terminal of the battery 
to the negative plate. This sudden movement 
of electrons will manifest itself in a momentary 
surge of current (conventional current will flow 
from the positive terminal of the battery towards 
the positive terminal of the capacitor).
Eventually, enough electrons will have moved to 
make the e.m.f. between the plates the same as 
that of the battery. In this state, the capacitor is 
said to be fully charged and an electric field will 
be present in the space between the two plates.
If, at some later time, the switch is moved back 
to position A, the positive plate will be left with 
a deficiency of electrons while the negative 
plate will be left with a surplus of electrons. 
Furthermore, since there is no path for current 
to flow between the two plates the capacitor will 
remain charged and a potential difference will be 
maintained between the plates.
Now assume that the switch is moved to position 
C. The excess electrons on the negative plate will 
flow through the resistor to the positive plate until 
a neutral state once again exists (i.e. until there 
is no excess charge on either plate). In this state 
the capacitor is said to be fully discharged and 
the electric field between the plates will rapidly 
collapse. The movement of electrons during the 
discharging of the capacitor will again result in 
a momentary surge of current (current will flow 
from the positive terminal of the capacitor and 
into the resistor).
Fig. 2.23 shows the direction of current flow in 
the circuit of Fig. 2.22 during charging (switch in 
position B) and discharging (switch in position C). 
It should be noted that current flows momentarily 
in both circuits even though you may think that 
the circuit is broken by the gap between the 
capacitor plates!

10 V to 50 V in a period of 0.1 s. If this voltage

Charge, capacitance and voltage
The charge or quantity of electricity that can be 
stored in the electric field between the capacitor 
plates is proportional to the applied voltage and 
the capacitance of the capacitor. Thus:
Q = CV
where Q is the charge (in coulombs), C is the 
capacitance (in farads) and V is the potential 
difference (in volts).
Example 2.19
A 10 uF capacitor is charged to a potential of 
250 V. Determine the charge stored.
Solution
The charge stored will be given by:
Q = CV = 10 × 10−6 × 250 = 2.5 mC
Energy storage
The energy stored in a capacitor is proportional to 
the product of the capacitance and the square of 
the potential difference. Thus:
W = ½ C V 2
Capacitance
The unit of capacitance is the farad (F). A capacitor 
is said to have a capacitance of 1 F if a current of 
1 A flows in it when a voltage changing at the rate 
of 1 V/s is applied to it. The current flowing in a 
capacitor will thus be proportional to the product 
of the capacitance, C, and the rate of change of 
applied voltage. Hence:
i = C × (rate of change of voltage)
Note that we’ve used a lower case i to represent 
the current flowing in the capacitor. We’ve done 
this because the current is changing and doesn’t 
remain constant. 
The rate of change of voltage is often represented 
by the expression dν/dt where dν represents a 
very small change in voltage and dt represents the 
corresponding small change in time. Expressing 
this mathematically gives:

Capacitance and physical 
dimensions
The capacitance of a capacitor depends upon the 
physical dimensions of the capacitor (i.e. the size 
of the plates and the separation between them) 
and the dielectric material between the plates.

capacitor is given by:

Capacitor specifications
The specifications for a capacitor usually 
include the value of capacitance (expressed 
in microfarads, nanofarads or picofarads), the 
voltage rating (i.e. the maximum voltage which 
can be continuously applied to the capacitor under 
a given set of conditions) and the accuracy or 
tolerance (quoted as the maximum permissible 
percentage deviation from the marked value). 
Other practical considerations when selecting 
capacitors for use in a particular application 
include temperature coefficient, leakage current, 
stability and ambient temperature range. 
Table 2.5 summarizes the properties of five of 
the most common types of capacitor. Note that 
electrolytic capacitors require the application 
of a polarizing voltage in order to cause the 
chemical action on which they depend for their 
operation. The polarizing voltages used for 
electrolytic capacitors can range from as little 
as 1 V to several hundred volts depending upon 
the working voltage rating for the component in 
question.

Capacitor markings
The vast majority of capacitors employ written 
markings which indicate their values, working 
voltages, and tolerance. The most usual method 
of marking resin-dipped polyester (and other) 
types of capacitor involves quoting the value 
(μF, nF or pF), the tolerance (often either 10% 
or 20%), and the working voltage (often using _ 
and ~ to indicate d.c. and a.c., respectively). 
Several manufacturers use two separate lines 
for their capacitor markings and these have the 
following meanings (see Fig. 2.27):
First line: 
 capacitance (pF or μF) and 
tolerance (K = 10%, M = 20%)
Second line: 
 rated d.c. voltage and code for 
the dielectric material
A three-digit code is commonly used to mark 
monolithic ceramic capacitors. The first two digits 
of this code correspond to the first two digits of 
the value while the third digit is a multipler which 
gives the number of zeros to be added to give 
the value in picofarads. Other capacitors may use 
a colour code similar to that used for marking 
resistor values (see Fig. 2.28).
Example 2.23
A monolithic ceramic capacitor is marked with the 
legend ‘103K’. What is its value?
Solution
The value (pF) will be given by the first two digits 
(10) followed by the number of zeros indicated by 
the third digit (3). The value of the capacitor is thus 
10,000 pF or 10 nF. The final letter (K) indicates 
that the capacitor has a tolerance of 10%.
Example 2.24
A tubular capacitor is marked with the following 
coloured stripes: brown, green, brown, red, 
brown. What is its value, tolerance and working 
voltage?

Example 2.25
Determine the effective capacitance of the circuit 
shown in Fig. 2.32.
Solution
The circuit of Fig. 2.32 can be progressively 
simplified as shown in Fig. 2.33. The stages in this 
simplification are:
(a) C1 and C2 are in parallel and they can be 
replaced by a single capacitor (CA) of (2 nF + 4 
nF) = 6 nF.
(b) CA appears in series with C3. These two 
resistors can be replaced by a single capacitor 
(CB) of (6 nF × 2 nF)/(6 nF + 2 nF) = 1.5 nF.
(c) CB appears in parallel with C4. These two 
capacitors can be replaced by a single 
capacitance (C ) of (1.5 nF + 4 nF) = 5.5 nF.
Series and parallel combination 
of capacitors
In order to obtain a particular value of capacitance, 
fixed capacitors may be arranged in either series 
or parallel (Figs 2.30 and 2.31). The reciprocal of 
the effective capacitance of each of the series 
circuits shown in Fig. 2.30 is equal to the sum 
of the reciprocals of the individual capacitances. 
Hence, for Fig. 2.30(a):

You can remember this as the product of the

For a parallel arrangement of capacitors, the

to the sum of the individual capacitances. Hence, 
for Fig. 2.31(a):
C = C1 + C2
while for Fig. 2.31(b)

Variable capacitors
By moving one set of plates relative to the other, 
a capacitor can be made variable. The dielectric 
material used in a variable capacitor can be either 
air (see Fig. 2.34) or plastic (the latter tends to 
be more compact). Typical values for variable 
capacitors tend to range from about 25 pF to 
500 pF. These components are commonly used 
for tuning radio receivers.
Inductors
Inductors provide us with a means of storing 
electrical energy in the form of a magnetic field. 
Typical applications include chokes, filters and 
(in conjunction with one or more capacitors) 
frequency selective circuits. The electrical 
characteristics of an inductor are determined by 
a number of factors including the material of the 
core (if any), the number of turns and the physical 
dimensions of the coil. Fig. 2.35 shows the 
construction of a typical toroidal inductor wound 
on a ferrite (high permeability) core. 
In practice every coil comprises both inductance 
(L) and a small resistance (R). The circuit of Fig. 
2.36 shows these as two discrete components. 
In reality the inductance and the resistance (we 
often refer to this as a loss resistance because 
it’s something that we don’t actually want) are 
Example 2.26
A capacitance of 50 μF (rated at 100 V) is 
required. What series combination of preferred 
value capacitors will satisfy this requirement? 
What voltage rating should each capacitor have?

a capacitance of 50 μF, as follows:

Since the capacitors are of equal value, the 
applied d.c. potential will be shared equally 
between them. Thus each capacitor should be 
rated at 50 V. Note that, in a practical circuit, we 
could take steps to ensure that the d.c. voltage 
was shared equally between the two capacitors

Fig. 2.37(d), the magnetic field will suddenly 
collapse and the energy will be returned to the 
circuit in the form of an induced back e.m.f. which 
will appear across the coil as the field collapses. 
For large values of magnetic flux and inductance 
this back e.m.f. can be extremely large! 
Inductance
Inductance is the property of a coil which gives 
rise to the opposition to a change in the value of 
current flowing in it. Any change in the current 
applied to a coil/inductor will result in an induced 
voltage appearing across it. The unit of inductance 
is the henry (H) and a coil is said to have an 
inductance of 1 H if a voltage of 1 V is induced 
across it when a current changing at the rate of 
1 A/s is flowing in it.
The voltage induced across the terminals of an 
inductor will thus be proportional to the product 
of the inductance (L) and the rate of change of 
applied current. Hence:
e = −L × (rate of change of current)
Note that the minus sign indicates the polarity of 
the voltage, i.e. opposition to the change.
The rate of change of current is often represented 
by the expression di/dt where di represents a 
very small change in current and dt represents 
the corresponding small change in time. Using 
mathematical notation to write this we arrive at:
e
L i
t
d
d
= −
You might like to compare this with the similar 
relationship that we obtained for the current 
flowing in a capacitor shown on page 34.
Example 2.27
A current increases at a uniform rate from 2 A to 
6 A in a period of 250 ms. If this current is applied 
to an inductor of 600 mH, determine the voltage 
induced.
Solution
Now the induced voltage will be given by:
e = −L × (rate of change of current)
both distributed throughout the component 
but it is convenient to treat the inductance and 
resistance as separate components in the analysis 
of the circuit.
To understand what happens when a changing 
current flows through an inductor, take a look at 
the circuit shown in Fig. 2.37(a). If the switch is 
left open, no current will flow and no magnetic 
flux will be produced by the inductor. If the switch 
is closed, as shown in Fig. 2.37(b), current will 
begin to flow as energy is taken from the supply 
in order to establish the magnetic field. However, 
the change in magnetic flux resulting from the 
appearance of current creates a voltage (an 
induced e.m.f.) across the coil which opposes the 
applied e.m.f. from the battery. 
The induced e.m.f. results from the changing 
flux and it effectively prevents an instantaneous 
rise in current in the circuit. Instead, the current 
increases slowly to a maximum at a rate which 
depends upon the ratio of inductance (L) to 
resistance (R) present in the circuit. After a while, 
a steady state condition will be reached in which 
the voltage across the inductor will have decayed 
to zero and the current will have reached a 
maximum value determined by the ratio of V to R 
(i.e. Ohm’s Law). This is shown in Fig. 2.37(c).
If, after this steady state condition has been 
achieved, the switch is opened, as shown in 
Figure 2.35 A practical coil contains inductance 
and resistance

and a small amount of series loss resistance

Energy storage
The energy stored in an inductor is proportional to 
the product of the inductance and the square of 
the current flowing in it. Thus:
W = ½ L I 2
where W is the energy (in joules), L is the 
capacitance (in henries) and I is the current 
flowing in the inductor (in amperes).

Inductance and physical 
dimensions
The inductance of an inductor depends upon 
the physical dimensions of the inductor (e.g. the

of turns and the permeability of the material of the 
core. The inductance of an inductor is given by:

Inductor specifications
Inductor specifications normally include the value 
of inductance (expressed in henries, millihenries 
or microhenries), the current rating (i.e. the 
maximum current which can be continuously 
applied to the inductor under a given set of 
conditions), and the accuracy or tolerance (quoted 
as the maximum permissible percentage deviation 
from the marked value). Other considerations 
may include the temperature coefficient of 
the inductance (usually expressed in parts per 
million, p.p.m., per unit temperature change), 
the stability of the inductor, the d.c. resistance 
of the coil windings (ideally zero), the Q-factor 
(quality factor) of the coil and the recommended 
working frequency range. Table 2.6 summarizes 
the properties of four common types of inductor. 
Some typical small inductors are shown in Fig. 
2.38. These have values of inductance ranging 
from 15 μH to 1 mH.
Inductor markings
As with capacitors, the vast majority of inductors 
use written markings to indicate values, working 
current and tolerance. Some small inductors are 
marked with coloured stripes to indicate their 
value and tolerance (in which case the standard 
where L is the inductance (in henries), μ0 is 
the permeability of free space, μr is the relative 
permeability of the magnetic core, l is the mean 
length of the core (in metres) and A is the cross-
sectional area of the core (in square metres).
Example 2.29
An inductor of 100 mH is required. If a closed 
magnetic core of length 20 cm, cross-sectional 
area 15 cm2 and relative permeability 500 is 
available, determine the number of turns required.

colour values are used and inductance is normally 
expressed in microhenries).
Series and parallel combinations 
of inductors
In order to obtain a particular value of inductance, 
fixed inductors may be arranged in either series 
or parallel, as shown in Figs 2.39 and 2.40. The 
effective inductance of each of the series circuits 
shown in Fig. 2.39 is simply equal to the sum 
of the individual inductances. So, for the circuit 
shown in Fig. 2.39(a):
L = L1 + L2
while for Fig. 2.39(b)
L = L1 + L2+ L3
Turning to the parallel inductors shown in Fig. 
2.40, the reciprocal of the effective inductance of 
each circuit is equal to the sum of the reciprocals 
of the individual inductances. Hence, for Fig. 
2.40(a):

Since the inductors are identical, the applied 
current will be shared equally between them. 
Hence each inductor should have a current rating 
of 1 A.

Variable inductors
A ferrite-cored inductor can be made variable by 
moving its core in or out of the former onto which 
the coil is wound. Many small inductors have 
threaded ferrite cores to make this possible (see 
Fig. 2.43). Such inductors are often used in radio 
and high-frequency applications where precise 
tuning is required.
Surface-mounted components 
(SMCs)
Surface-mounting technology (SMT) is now widely 
used in the manufacture of printed circuit boards 
(PCBs) for electronic equipment. SMT allows 
circuits to be assembled in a much smaller space 
than would be possible using components with 
conventional wire leads and pins that are mounted 
using through-hole techniques. It is also possible 
to mix the two technologies, i.e. some through-
hole mounting of components and some SMCs 
present on the same circuit board. The following 
combinations are possible:
 
SMCs on both sides of a printed circuit board
 
SMC on one side of the board and 
conventional through-hole components (THCs) 
on the other
 
A mixture of SMCs and THCs on both sides of 
the printed circuit board.
SMCs are supplied in packages that are designed 
for mounting directly on the surface of a PCB. 
To provide electrical contact with the PCB, some 
SMCs have contact pads on their surface. Other 
Example 2.31
Determine the effective inductance of the circuit 
shown in Fig. 2.41.
Solution
The circuit can be progressively simplified 
as shown in Fig. 2.42. The stages in this 
simplification are as follows:
(a)  L1 and L2 are in series and they can be 
replaced by a single inductance (LA) of (60 + 
60) = 120 mH.
(b)  LA appears in parallel with L2. These two 
inductors can be replaced by a single inductor 
(LB) of (120 × 120)/(120 + 120) = 60 mH.
(c)  LB appears in series with L4. These two 
inductors can be replaced by a single 
inductance (L) of (60 + 50) = 110 mH.

devices have contacts which extend beyond 
the outline of the package itself but which 
terminate on the surface of the PCB rather than 
making contact through a hole (as is the case 
with a conventional THC). In general, passive 
components (such as resistors, capacitors and 
inductors) are configured leadless for surface 
mounting, while active devices (such as 
transistors and integrated circuits) are available in 
both surface mountable types as well as lead and 
leadless terminations suitable for making direct 
contact to the pads on the surface of a PCB.
Most SMCs have a flat rectangular shape rather 
than the cylindrical shape that we associate with 
conventional wire leaded components. During 
manufacture of a PCB, the various SMCs are 
attached using re-flow soldering paste (and in 
some cases adhesives) which consists of particles 
of solder and flux together with binder, solvents 
and additives. They need to have good ‘tack’ 
in order to hold the components in place and 
remove oxides without leaving obstinate residues. 
The component attachment (i.e. soldering!) 
process is completed using one of several 
techniques including convection ovens in which 
the PCB is passed, using a conveyor belt, through 
a convection oven which has separate zones 
for preheating, flowing and cooling, and infra-
red re-flow in which infra-red lamps are used to 
provide the source of heat.
SMCs are generally too small to be marked with 
colour codes. Instead, values may be marked 
using three digits. For example, the first two digits 
marked on a resistor normally specify the first two 
digits of the value while the third digit gives the 
number of zeros that should be added. 
Example 2.32
In Fig. 2.45, R88 is marked ‘102’. What is its 
value?
Solution
R88 will have a value of 1,000 Ω (i.e. 10 followed 
by two zeros).

on a printed circuit board. Note that components 
such as C38, R46, etc. have leads that pass 
through holes in the printed circuit board

Conclusion
Comment on the results. Did your measured 
values agree with the marked values? Were these 
within the tolerance range for the resistors used 
in the investigation? If the readings were not in 
agreement can you suggest why?
Practical investigation 
Objective
To investigate the resistance of series and parallel 
combinations of resistors.
Components and test equipment
Breadboard, digital or analogue meter with d.c. 
current ranges, 9 V d.c. power source (either a 9 V 
battery or an a.c. mains adapter with a 9 V 400 mA 
output), test leads, resistors of 100 Ω, 220 Ω, 
330 Ω, 470 Ω, 680 Ω and 1 kΩ, connecting wire.
Procedure
Connect the resistor network and power supply 
(or battery) as shown in Fig. 2.46. Select the 
20 V d.c. voltage range on the multimeter then 
measure and record the supply voltage (this 
should be approximately 9 V). Now break the 
positive connection to the circuit, change the 
range on the multimeter to the 20 mA d.c. current 
range and measure the current supplied to the 
circuit. 
Next, measure and record the voltage dropped 
across each resistor (don’t forget to change 
ranges on the multimeter when making each 
measurement). 
Finally, break the circuit at one end of each 
resistor in turn, then measure and record the 
current flowing. Repeat the procedure for the 
other two resistor network circuits shown in Figs. 
2.47 and 2.48.
Measurements and calculations
Record your results in a table for each network. 
Use the recorded values of current and voltage for 
each resistor to calculate the value of resistance 
and compare this with the marked value. Check 
that the measured value lies within the tolerance 
band for each resistor. 
Calculate the resistance of each network (looking 
in at the supply terminals) and compare this with 
the resistance calculated by dividing the supply 
voltage by the supply current.

Chapter summary
In many cases, Ohm’s Law alone is insufficient to determine the magnitude 
of the voltages and currents present in a circuit. This chapter introduces 
several techniques that simplify the task of solving complex circuits. It also 
introduces the concept of exponential growth and decay of voltage and 
current in circuits containing capacitance and resistance and inductance 
and resistance. It concludes by showing how humble C–R circuits can be 
used for shaping the waveforms found in electronic circuits. We start by 
introducing two of the most useful laws of electronics.

away from the junction (obvious because I1 
and I2 both flow towards the junction) we 
arrive at the following Kirchhoff’s Current Law 
equation:
+I1 + I2 −I5 = 0
From which:
I5 = I1 + I2 = 1.5 + 2.7 = 4.2 A
(b) Moving to Node B, let’s assume that I3 flows 
outwards so we can say that:
+I4 + I5 −I3 = 0
From which:
I3 = I4 + I5 = 3.3 + 4.2 = 7.5 A
Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law states that the algebraic 
sum of the potential drops in a closed network (or 
‘mesh’) is zero (see Fig. 3.3).
Example 3.2
In Fig. 3.4, use Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law to 
determine:
(a) the value of V2
(b) the value of E3. 
Kirchhoff‘s Laws
Kirchhoff’s Laws relate to the algebraic sum 
of currents at a junction (or node) or voltages 
in a network (or mesh). The term ‘algebraic’ 
simply indicates that the polarity of each current 
or voltage drop must be taken into account by 
giving it an appropriate sign, either positive (+) or 
negative (–).
Kirchhoff’s Current Law states that the algebraic 
sum of the currents present at a junction (node) in 
a circuit is zero (see Fig. 3.1).
Example 3.1
In Fig. 3.2, use Kirchhoff’s Current Law to 
determine:
(a) the value of current flowing between A and B
(b) the value of I3. 
Solution
(a) I1 and I2 both flow towards Node A so, applying 
our polarity convention, they must both be 
positive. Now, assuming that current I5 flows 
between A and B and that this current flows

By applying Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law in Loop B we 
obtain:

and:

Solution
(a) In Loop A, and using the conventions shown in  
Fig. 3.3, we can write down the Kirchhoff’s  
Voltage Law equations:
E1 − V2 − E2 = 0
From which:
V2 = E1 − E2 = 6 – 3 = 3 V
(b) Similarly, in Loop B we can say that:
E2 − V1 + E3 = 0
From which:
E3 = V1 − E2 = 4.5 − 3 = 1.5 V

Determine the currents and voltages in the circuit 
of Fig. 3.5.
Solution
In order to solve the circuit shown in Fig. 3.5, it is 
first necessary to mark the currents and voltages 
on the circuit, as shown in Figs 3.6 and 3.7.
By applying Kirchhoff’s Current Law at Node A 
that we’ve identified in Fig. 3.5:
+I1 + I2 − I3 = 0
Therefore:
I1 = I3 − I2

By applying Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law in Loop A we

Since the left- and right-hand sides of the equation 
are equal we can be reasonably confident that our 
results are correct.

(Fig. 3.9) the output voltage is given by:

It is, however, important to note that the output

Example 3.5
A moving coil meter requires a current of 1 mA 
to provide full-scale deflection. If the meter coil 
has a resistance of 100 Ω and is to be used as a 
milliammeter reading 5 mA full-scale, determine 
the value of parallel shunt resistor required.
Solution
This problem may sound a little complicated so 
it is worth taking a look at the equivalent circuit 
of the meter (Fig. 3.12) and comparing it with the 
current divider shown in Fig. 3.11.
We can apply the current divider formula, 
replacing Iout with Im (the meter full-scale 
Example 3.4
The potential divider shown in Fig. 3.10 is used 
as a simple voltage calibrator. Determine the 
output voltage produced by the circuit:
(a) when the output terminals are left open-circuit 
(i.e. when no load is connected); and
(b) when the output is loaded by a resistance of 
10 kΩ.

A Wheatstone bridge is based on the circuit 
shown in Fig. 3.14. If R1 and R2 can each be 
switched so that they have values of either 100 Ω 
or 1 kΩ and RV is variable between 10 Ω and 
10 kΩ, determine the range of resistance values 
that can be measured. 
Solution
The maximum value of resistance that can be 
measured will correspond to the largest ratio of 
R2:R1 (i.e. when R2 is 1 kΩ and R1 is 100 Ω) and 
the highest value of RV (i.e. 10 kΩ). In this case:

The Wheatstone bridge
The Wheatstone bridge forms the basis of a 
number of useful electronic circuits including 
several that are used in instrumentation and 
measurement. 
The basic form of Wheatstone bridge is shown in 
Fig. 3.13. The voltage developed between A and 
B will be zero when the voltage between A and 
Y is the same as that between B and Y. In effect, 
R1 and R2 constitute a potential divider, as do R3 
and R4.
The bridge will be balanced (and VAB = 0) when 
the ratio of R1:R2 is the same as the ratio R3:R4. 
Hence, at balance:

A practical form of Wheatstone bridge that can 
be used for measuring unknown resistances is 
shown in Fig. 3.14. 
In this practical form of Wheatstone bridge, R1 
and R2 are called the ratio arms while one arm 
(that occupied by R3 in Fig. 3.13) is replaced by a 
Figure 3.13 Basic Wheatstone bridge circuit

Hence the voltage at B relative to Y, VBY, will be 
4.444 V.
The voltage VAB will be the difference between VAY 
and VBY. This, the open-circuit output voltage, VAB, 
will be given by:
VAB = VAY −VBY = 5.454 − 4.444 = 1.01 V
Next we need to find the Thévenin equivalent 
resistance looking in at A and B. To do this, we 
can redraw the circuit, replacing the battery 
(connected between X and Y) with a short-circuit, 
as shown in Fig. 3.17.
The Thévenin equivalent resistance is given by 
the relationship:

Thévenin’s Theorem
Thévenin’s Theorem allows us to replace 
a complicated network of resistances and 
voltage sources with a simple equivalent circuit 
comprising a single voltage source connected in 
series with a single resistance (see Fig. 3.15).
The single voltage source in the Thévenin 
equivalent circuit, Voc, is simply the voltage that 
appears between the terminals when nothing is 
connected to it. In other words, it is the open-
circuit voltage that would appear between A 
and B.
The single resistance that appears in the Thévenin 
equivalent circuit, R, is the resistance that would 
be seen looking into the network between A 
and B when all of the voltage sources (assumed 
perfect) are replaced by short-circuit connections. 
Note that if the voltage sources are not perfect 
(i.e. if they have some internal resistance) the 
equivalent circuit must be constructed on the 
basis that each voltage source is replaced by its 
own internal resistance.
Once we have values for Voc and R, we can 
determine how the network will behave when 
it is connected to a load (i.e. when a resistor is 
connected across the terminals A and B).
Example 3.7
Fig. 3.16 shows a Wheatstone bridge. Determine 
the current that will flow in a 100 Ω load 
connected between terminals A and B.
Solution
First we need to find the Thévenin equivalent 
of the circuit. To find Voc we can treat the bridge 
arrangement as two potential dividers. 
The voltage across R2 will be given by:

Norton’s Theorem
Norton’s Theorem provides an alternative 
method of reducing a complex network to a 
simple equivalent circuit. Unlike Thévenin’s 
Theorem, Norton’s Theorem makes use of a 
current source rather than a voltage source. The 
Norton equivalent circuit allows us to replace 
a complicated network of resistances and 
voltage sources with a simple equivalent circuit 
comprising a single constant current source 
connected in parallel with a single resistance (see 
Fig. 3.20).
The constant current source in the Norton 
equivalent circuit, Isc, is simply the short-circuit 
current that would flow if A and B were to be 
linked directly together. The resistance that 
appears in the Norton equivalent circuit, R, is the 
resistance that would be seen looking into the 
network between A and B when all of the voltage 
sources are replaced by short-circuit connections. 
Once again, it is worth noting that if the voltage 
sources have any appreciable internal resistance, 
the equivalent circuit must be constructed on the 
basis that each voltage source is replaced by its 
own internal resistance.
As with the Thévenin equivalent, we can 
determine how a network will behave by 
obtaining values for Isc and R.

C–R circuits
Networks of capacitors and resistors (known as 
C–R circuits) form the basis of many timing and 
pulse-shaping circuits and are thus often found in 
practical electronic circuits.
Charging
A simple C–R circuit is shown in Fig. 3.26. In this 
circuit C is charged through R from a constant 
voltage source, Vs. The voltage, νc, across the 
(initially uncharged) capacitor voltage will rise 
exponentially as shown in Fig. 3.27. At the same 
time, the current in the circuit, i, will fall, as shown 
in Fig. 3.28.
The rate of growth of voltage with time (and 
decay of current with time) will be dependent 
upon the product of capacitance and resistance. 
This value is known as the time constant of the 
circuit. Hence:
Time constant, t = C × R
where C is the value of capacitance (F), R is the 
resistance (Ω) and t is the time constant (s).
The voltage developed across the charging 
capacitor, νc, varies with time, t, according to the 
relationship:
n =

t
CR
where νc is the capacitor voltage, Vs is the d.c. 
supply voltage, t is the time and CR is the time 
constant of the circuit (equal to the product of 
capacitance, C, and resistance, R).
The capacitor voltage will rise to approximately 
63% of the supply voltage, Vs, in a time interval 
equal to the time constant. 
At the end of the next interval of time equal to the 
time constant (i.e. after an elapsed time equal to 
2CR  ) the voltage will have risen by 63% of the 
remainder, and so on. In theory, the capacitor will 
never become fully charged. However, after a 
period of time equal to 5CR, the capacitor voltage 
will to all intents and purposes be equal to the 
supply voltage. At this point the capacitor voltage 
will have risen to 99.3% of its final value and we 
can consider it to be fully charged.

electronics. In this oscilloscope, for example, 
a rotary switch is used to select different C–R

1 μs/cm). Each C–R time constant corresponds to 
a different timebase range

Discharge
Having considered the situation when a capacitor 
is being charged, let’s consider what happens 
when an already charged capacitor is discharged. 
When the fully charged capacitor from Fig. 3.24 
is connected as shown in Fig. 3.30, the capacitor 
will discharge through the resistor, and the 
capacitor voltage, νC, will fall exponentially with 
time, as shown in Fig. 3.31. 
The current in the circuit, i, will also fall, as shown 
in Fig. 3.32. The rate of discharge (i.e. the rate 
of decay of voltage with time) will once again 
be governed by the time constant of the circuit, 
C × R.
The voltage developed across the discharging 
capacitor, νC, varies with time, t, according to the 
relationship:
c
s
V e
t
CR
ν =
−
where Vs, is the supply voltage, t is the time, C is 
the capacitance and R is the resistance.
The capacitor voltage will fall to approximately 
37% of the initial voltage in a time equal to the 
time constant. At the end of the next interval 
of time equal to the time constant (i.e. after an 
elapsed time equal to 2CR) the voltage will have 
fallen by 37% of the remainder, and so on.
In theory, the capacitor will never become fully 
discharged. However, after a period of time equal 
to 5CR, the capacitor voltage will to all intents and 
purposes be zero. 
At this point the capacitor voltage will have fallen 
below 1% of its initial value. We can consider it to 
be fully discharged.
As with charging, the current in the capacitor, i, 
varies with time, t, according to the relationship:
=
−
i
V

where Vs, is the supply voltage, t is the time, C is 
the capacitance and R is the resistance.
The current will fall to approximately 37% of the 
initial value of current, Vs /R, in a time equal to the 
time constant. 
At the end of the next interval of time equal to the 
time constant (i.e. after a total time of 2CR has

when t/CR = 0.2, the ratio of instantaneous value 
to final value (k in Table 3.1) is 0.8187.
Thus
νc / Vs = 0.8187
or
νc = 0.8187 × Vs = 0.8187 × 150V = 122.8 V
elapsed) the voltage will have fallen by a further 
37% of the remainder, and so on.
Example 3.11
A 10 μF capacitor is charged to a potential of 20 V 
and then discharged through a 47 kΩ resistor.

In order to simplify the mathematics of

Example 3.12
A 150 μF capacitor is charged to a potential 
of 150 V. The capacitor is then removed from 
the charging source and connected to a 2 MΩ 
resistor. Determine the capacitor voltage 1 minute 
later.
Solution
We will solve this problem using Table 3.1 rather 
than the exponential formula.
First we need to find the time constant:
C × R = 150 μF × 2 MΩ = 300 s
Next we find the ratio of t to CR:
After 1 minute, t = 60 s therefore the ratio of 
t to CR is 60/ 300 or 0.2. Table 3.1 shows that

Example 3.13
A circuit is required to produce a train of 
alternating positive and negative pulses of short 
duration from a square wave of frequency 1 kHz. 
Devise a suitable C–R circuit and specify suitable 
values.
Solution
Here we require the services of a differentiating 
circuit along the lines of that shown in Fig. 3.35. 
In order that the circuit operates effectively 
as a differentiator, we need to make the time 
constant, C × R, very much less than the periodic 
time of the input waveform (1 ms).
Assuming that we choose a medium value for 
R of, say, 10 kΩ, the maximum value which 
Waveshaping with C–R networks
One of the most common applications of C–R 
networks is in waveshaping circuits. The circuits 
shown in Figs 3.33 and 3.35 function as simple 
square-to-triangle and square-to-pulse converters 
by, respectively, integrating and differentiating 
their inputs.
The effectiveness of the simple integrator circuit 
shown in Fig. 3.33 depends on the ratio of time 
constant, C × R, to periodic time, t. The larger 
this ratio is, the more effective the circuit will be 
as an integrator. The effectiveness of the circuit 
of Fig. 3.33 is illustrated by the input and output 
waveforms shown in Fig. 3.34.
Similarly, the effectiveness of the simple 
differentiator circuit shown in Fig. 3.35 also 
depends on the ratio of time constant C × R, to 
periodic time, t. The smaller this ratio is, the more 
effective the circuit will be as a differentiator.
The effectiveness of the circuit of Fig. 3.35 is 
illustrated by the input and output waveforms 
shown in Fig. 3.36.

L–R circuits
Networks of inductors and resistors (known as 
L–R circuits) can also be used for timing and 
pulse shaping. In comparison with capacitors, 
however, inductors are somewhat more difficult 
to manufacture and are consequently more 
expensive.
Inductors are also prone to losses and may 
also require screening to minimize the effects 
of stray magnetic coupling. Inductors are, 
therefore, generally unsuited to simple timing and 
waveshaping applications.
Fig. 3.37 shows a simple L–R network in which 
an inductor is connected to a constant voltage 
supply. When the supply is first connected, the 
current, i, will rise exponentially with time, as 
shown in Fig. 3.38. At the same time, the inductor 
voltage, VL, will fall, as shown in Fig. 3.39. The 
rate of change of current with time will depend 
upon the ratio of inductance to resistance and is 
known as the time constant. Hence:
Time constant, t = L/R
where L is the value of inductance (H), R is the 
resistance (Ω), and t is the time constant (s). 
The current flowing in the inductor, i, varies with 
time, t, according to the relationship:

L
where Vs is the d.c. supply voltage, R is the 
resistance of the inductor and L is the inductance.
The current, i, will initially be zero and will rise to 
approximately 63% of its maximum value (i.e. 
Vs/R) in a time interval equal to the time constant. 
At the end of the next interval of time equal to the 
time constant (i.e. after a total time of 2L/R has 
elapsed) the current will have risen by a further 
63% of the remainder, and so on.
In theory, the current in the inductor will never 
become equal to Vs /R. However, after a period of 
time equal to 5L/R, the current will to all intents 
and purposes be equal to Vs /R. At this point the 
current in the inductor will have risen to 99.3% of 
its final value.

very narrow width.
Example 3.14
A circuit is required to produce a triangular 
waveform from a square wave of frequency 
1 kHz. Devise a suitable C–R arrangement and 
specify suitable values.
Solution
This time we require an integrating circuit like 
that shown in Fig. 3.33. In order that the circuit 
operates effectively as an integrator, we need to 
make the time constant, C × R, very much less 
than the periodic time of the input waveform 
(1 ms).
Assuming that we choose a medium value for 
R of, say, 10 kΩ, the minimum value which 
we could allow C to have would be that which 
satisfies the equation:

wave which has a very small amplitude. To put 
this in simple terms, although the waveform 
might be what you want there’s not a lot of it!

Measure and record the capacitor voltage at 25 s 
intervals over the range 0 to 250 s from removing

capacitor voltage against time. Repeat with 
R = 220 kΩ and R = 47 kΩ.
Solution
We will solve this problem using Table 3.1 rather 
than the exponential formula.
First we need to find the time constant:
L/R = 0.1 H/10 Ω = 0.01 s
Next we find the ratio of t to L/R.
When t = 20 ms the ratio of t to L/R is 0.02/0.01 
or 2. Table 3.1 shows that when t/(L/R) = 2, the 
ratio of instantaneous value to final value (k) is 
0.8647. Thus
νL/ Vs = 0.8647
or
νL = 0.8647 × Vs = 0.8647 × 5 V = 4.32V

9 V battery or an a.c. mains adapter with a 9 V 
400 mA output), digital multimeter with test leads, 
resistors of 100 kΩ, 220 kΩ and 47 kΩ, capacitor 
of 1,000 μF, insulated wire links (various lengths), 
assorted crocodile leads, short lengths of black, 
red and green insulated solid wire. A watch or 
clock with a seconds display will also be required 
for timing.
Procedure
Connect the charging circuit shown in Fig. 3.40 
with R = 100 kΩ and C = 1,000 μF. Place a 
temporary shorting link across the capacitor. Set 
the meter to the 20 V d.c. range and remove the 
shorting link. Measure and record the capacitor 
voltage at 25 s intervals over the range 0 to 250 s 
after removing the shorting link. Record your 
result in a table showing capacitor voltage against 
time. Repeat with R = 220 kΩ and R = 47 kΩ.
Connect the discharging circuit shown in Fig. 3.41 
with R = 100 kΩ and C = 1,000 μF. Leave the link 
in place for a few seconds after the supply voltage

resistors, capacitors and inductors when an alternating current is applied to 
them. The chapter concludes by introducing another useful component, the

4 Alternating voltage and current
72
Alternating versus direct current
Direct currents are currents which, even though 
their magnitude may vary, essentially flow only 
in one direction. In other words, direct currents 
are unidirectional. Alternating currents, on the 
other hand, are bidirectional and continuously 
reverse their direction of flow. The polarity of the 
e.m.f. which produces an alternating current must 
consequently also be changing from positive to 
negative, and vice versa.
Alternating currents produce alternating potential 
differences (voltages) in the circuits in which they 
flow. Furthermore, in some circuits alternating 
voltages may be superimposed on direct voltage 
levels (see Fig. 4.1). The resulting voltage may be 
unipolar (i.e. always positive or always negative) 
or bipolar (i.e. partly positive and partly negative).
Waveforms and signals
A graph showing the variation of voltage or 
current present in a circuit is known as a 
waveform. There are many common types of 
waveform encountered in electrical circuits, 
including sine (or sinusoidal), square, triangle, 
ramp or sawtooth (which may be either positive 
or negative going), and pulse.
Complex waveforms, like speech and music, 
usually comprise many components at different 
frequencies. Pulse waveforms are often 
categorized as either repetitive or non-repetitive 
(the former comprises a pattern of pulses that 
repeats regularly while the latter comprises pulses 
which constitute a unique event). Some common 
waveforms are shown in Fig. 4.2.
Signals can be conveyed using one or more of 
the properties of a waveform and sent using 
wires, cables, optical and radio links. Signals 
can also be processed in various ways using 
amplifiers, modulators, filters, etc. Signals are 
also classified as either analogue (continuously 
variable) or digital (based on discrete states).
Frequency
The frequency of a repetitive waveform is the 
number of cycles of the waveform which occur 
in unit time. Frequency is expressed in hertz, Hz, 
and a frequency of 1 Hz is equivalent to one cycle 
per second. Hence, if a voltage has a frequency of 
400 Hz, 400 cycles of it will occur in every 
second.

wave (superimposed on a d.c. level)

The equation for the voltage shown in Fig. 4.1(a) 
at a time, t, is:
ν = Vmax sin (2πft)
while that in Fig. 4.1(b) is:
ν = Vd.c. + Vmax sin (2πft)
where ν is the instantaneous voltage, Vmax is the 
maximum (or peak) voltage of the sine wave, 
Vd.c. is the d.c. offset (where present) and f is the 
frequency of the sine wave.
Example 4.1
A sine wave voltage has a maximum value of 
20 V and a frequency of 50 Hz. Determine the 
instantaneous voltage present (a) 2.5 ms and 
(b) 15 ms from the start of the cycle.
Solution
We can find the voltage at any instant of time 
using:
ν = Vmax sin (2πft)
where Vmax = 20 V and f = 50 Hz.
In (a), t = 2.5 ms, hence:
ν = 20 sin (2π × 50 × 0.0025) = 20 sin (0.785)
   = 20 × 0.707 = 14.14 V
In (b), t = 15 ms, hence:
ν = 20 sin (2π × 50 × 0.0015) = 20 sin (4.71)
   = 20 × −1 = −20 V
Periodic time
The periodic time (or period) of a waveform is the 
time taken for one complete cycle of the wave 
(see Fig. 4.3). The relationship between periodic 
time and frequency is thus:
t = 1 / f or f = 1 / t
where t is the periodic time (in s) and f is the 
frequency (in Hz).
Example 4.2
A waveform has a frequency of 400 Hz. What is 
the periodic time of the waveform?
Solution
t = 1 / f = 1/400 = 0.0025 s (or 2.5 ms)

Average, peak, peak–peak, and 
r.m.s. values
The average value of an alternating current which 
swings symmetrically above and below zero 
will be zero when measured over a long period 
of time. Hence average values of currents and 
voltages are invariably taken over one complete 
half-cycle (either positive or negative) rather than 
over one complete full-cycle (which would result 
in an average value of zero).
The amplitude (or peak value) of a waveform is 
a measure of the extent of its voltage or current 
excursion from the resting value (usually zero).
The peak-to-peak value for a wave which is 
symmetrical about its resting value is twice its 
peak value (see Fig. 4.4).
The r.m.s. (or effective) value of an alternating 
voltage or current is the value which would 
produce the same heat energy in a resistor as a 
direct voltage or current of the same magnitude. 
Since the r.m.s. value of a waveform is very 
much dependent upon its shape, values are only 
meaningful when dealing with a waveform of 
known shape. Where the shape of a waveform is

Ir.m.s. = 0.353 × Vpk-pk = 0.353 × 0.05 = 0.0177 A
(or 17.7 mA).
Example 4.6
A sinusoidal voltage of 10 V pk–pk is applied to a 
resistor of 1 kΩ. What value of r.m.s. current will 
flow in the resistor?
Solution
This problem must be solved in two stages. First 
we will determine the peak–peak current in the 
resistor and then we shall convert this value into a 
corresponding r.m.s. quantity.

r.m.s.) is 0.353. Thus:
Ir.m.s. = 0.353 × Ipk-pk = 0.353 × 10 = 3.53 mA
Reactance
When alternating voltages are applied to 
capacitors or inductors the magnitude of the 
current flowing will depend upon the value of 
capacitance or inductance and on the frequency 
of the voltage. In effect, capacitors and inductors 
oppose the flow of current in much the same 
way as a resistor. The important difference is 
that the effective resistance (or reactance) of the 
component varies with frequency (unlike the case 
of a resistor where the magnitude of the current 
does not change with frequency).
Capacitive reactance
The reactance of a capacitor is defined as the ratio 
of applied voltage to current and, like resistance, it 
is measured in ohms. The reactance of a capacitor 
is inversely proportional to both the value of 
capacitance and the frequency of the applied 
voltage. Capacitive reactance can be found by 
applying the following formula:
not specified, r.m.s. values are normally assumed 
to refer to sinusoidal conditions.
For a given waveform, a set of fixed relationships 
exist between average, peak, peak–peak, and 
r.m.s. values. The required multiplying factors are 
summarized for sinusoidal voltages and currents 
in Table 4.1.
Example 4.4
A sinusoidal voltage has an r.m.s. value of 240 V. 
What is the peak value of the voltage?
Solution
The corresponding multiplying factor (found from 
Table 4.1) is 1.414. Hence:
Vpk = 1.414 × Vr.m.s. = 1.414 × 240 = 339.4 V
Example 4.5
An alternating current has a peak–peak value of 
50 mA. What is its r.m.s. value?
Solution
The corresponding multiplying factor (found from 
Table 4.1) is 0.353. Hence:

and current, Ic, flowing in a pure capacitive 
reactance will differ in phase by an angle of 90°

shown in Fig. 4.7.

Inductive reactance
The reactance of an inductor is defined as the 
ratio of applied voltage to current and, like 
resistance, it is measured in ohms. The reactance 
of an inductor is directly proportional to both the 
value of inductance and the frequency of the 
applied voltage. Inductive reactance can be found 
by applying the formula:
XL = 2π f L
where XL is the reactance in Ω, f is the frequency 
in Hz and L is the inductance in H.
Inductive reactance increases linearly with 
frequency as shown in Fig. 4.8. The applied 
voltage, VL, and current, IL, developed across a 
pure inductive reactance will differ in phase by 
an angle of 90° or π/ 2 radians (the current lags 
the voltage). This relationship is illustrated in 
the current and voltage waveforms (drawn to a 
common time scale) shown in Fig. 4.9 and as a 
phasor diagram shown in Fig. 4.10.

Power factor
The power factor in an a.c. circuit containing 
resistance and reactance is simply the ratio of true 
power to apparent power. Hence:
=
power factor
true power
apparent power
The true power in an a.c. circuit is the power 
which is actually dissipated in the resistive 
component. Thus:
true power = IS
2 × R    (watts)
The apparent power in an a.c. circuit is the 
power which is apparently consumed by the 
circuit and is the product of the supply current and 
supply voltage (note that this is not the same as 
inductor is negligible by comparison with its 
reactance. Where this is not the case, it will be 
necessary to determine the impedance of the 
component and use this to determine the voltage 
drop.
Impedance
Fig. 4.11 shows two circuits which contain both 
resistance and reactance. These circuits are said 
to exhibit impedance (a combination of resistance 
and reactance) which, like resistance and 
reactance, is measured in ohms. 
The impedance of the circuits shown in Fig. 4.11 
is simply the ratio of supply voltage, VS, to supply 
current, IS. The impedance of the simple C–R and 
L–R circuits shown in Fig. 4.11 can be found by 
using the impedance triangle shown in Fig. 4.12.
In either case, the impedance of the circuit is

ohms).
The phase angle (between the supply voltage and 
current) will be +π/2 rad (i.e. +90°) when XL > XC 
(above resonance) or −π/2 rad (or −90°) when XC > 
XL (below resonance).
At a particular frequency (known as the series 
resonant frequency) the reactance of the 
capacitor, XC, will be equal in magnitude (but of 
opposite sign) to that of the inductor, XL. Due to 
this effective cancellation of the reactance, the 
impedance of the series resonant circuit will be 
zero at resonance. The supply current will have a 
maximum value at resonance (infinite in the case 
of a perfect series resonant circuit supplied from 
an ideal voltage source!).

where f0 is the resonant frequency (in hertz), 
L is the inductance (in henries) and C is the 
capacitance (in farads).
Typical impedance-frequency characteristics for 
series and parallel tuned circuits are shown in 
Figs 4.14 and 4.15. 
The series L–C–R tuned circuit has a minimum 
impedance at resonance (equal to R) and 
thus maximum current will flow. The circuit is 
consequently known as an acceptor circuit. 
The parallel L–C–R tuned circuit has a maximum 
impedance at resonance (equal to R) and 
thus minimum current will flow. The circuit is 
consequently known as a rejector circuit.
Quality factor
The quality of a resonant (or tuned) circuit is 
measured by its Q-factor. The higher the Q-factor, 
the sharper the response (narrower bandwidth), 
conversely the lower the Q-factor, the flatter the 
response (wider bandwidth), see Fig. 4.16. In 
the case of the series tuned circuit, the Q-factor 
At a particular frequency (known as the parallel 
resonant frequency) the reactance of the 
capacitor, XC, will be equal in magnitude (but 
of opposite sign) to that of the inductor, XL. At 
resonance, the denominator in the formula for 
impedance becomes zero and thus the circuit has 
an infinite impedance at resonance. The supply 
current will have a minimum value at resonance 
(zero in the case of a perfect parallel resonant 
circuit).
L–C–R circuits
Two forms of L–C–R network are illustrated in 
Figs 4.13; Fig. 4.13(c) is series resonant while 
Fig. 4.13(d) is parallel resonant. As in the case of 
their simpler L–C counterparts, the impedance

Transformers
Transformers provide us with a means of coupling 
a.c. power or signals from one circuit to another. 
Voltage may be stepped-up (secondary voltage 
greater than primary voltage) or stepped-
down (secondary voltage less than primary 
voltage). Since no increase in power is possible 
(transformers are passive components like 
resistors, capacitors and inductors) an increase 
in secondary voltage can only be achieved at 
Figure 4.18 A selection of transformers with 
power ratings from 0.1 VA to 100 VA
the expense of a corresponding reduction in 
secondary current, and vice versa (in fact, the 
secondary power will be very slightly less than 
the primary power due to losses within the 
transformer). Typical applications for transformers 
include stepping-up or stepping-down mains 
voltages in power supplies, coupling signals in AF 
amplifiers to achieve impedance matching and

components. 
The electrical characteristics of a transformer 
are determined by a number of factors including 
the core material and physical dimensions. The 
specifications for a transformer usually include 
the rated primary and secondary voltages 
and currents, the required power rating (i.e. 
the maximum power, usually expressed in 
volt-amperes, VA) which can be continuously 
delivered by the transformer under a given 
set of conditions, the frequency range for the

Voltage and turns ratio
The principle of the transformer is illustrated in 
Fig. 4.21. The primary and secondary windings 
are wound on a common low-reluctance magnetic 
core. The alternating flux generated by the 
primary winding is therefore coupled into the 
secondary winding (very little flux escapes due 
to leakage). A sinusoidal current flowing in the 
primary winding produces a sinusoidal flux. At any 
instant the flux in the transformer is given by the 
equation:

Measurements and calculations
Record your results in a table showing values 
of IC, IL and IS at each frequency from 100 Hz 
to 1 kHz. Plot graphs showing how the current 
in each circuit varies over the frequency range 
100 Hz to 1 kHz using the graph layout shown in 
Fig. 4.27. Calculate the resonant frequency of the 
L–C circuit shown in Fig. 4.26.
Conclusion
Comment on the shape of each graph. Is this 
what you would expect (recall that the current 
flowing in the circuit will be proportional to 
the reciprocal of the reactance)? Compare the 
measured resonant frequency with the calculated 
value. If they are not the same, suggest reasons 
for any difference.

Semiconductors
Chapter summary
This chapter introduces devices that are made from materials that are 
neither conductors nor insulators. These semiconductor materials 
form the basis of diodes, thyristors, triacs, transistors and integrated 
circuits. We start this chapter with a brief introduction to the principles of 
semiconductors before going on to examine the characteristics of each of 
the most common types of semiconductor.

In Chapter 1 we described the simplified structure 
of an atom and showed that it contains both 
negative charge carriers (electrons) and positive 
charge carriers (protons). Electrons each carry 
a single unit of negative electric charge while 
protons each exhibit a single unit of positive 
charge. Since atoms normally contain an equal 
number of electrons and protons, the net charge 
present will be zero. For example, if an atom 
has 11 electrons, it will also contain 11 protons. 
The end result is that the negative charge of the 
electrons will be exactly balanced by the positive 
charge of the protons. 
Electrons are in constant motion as they orbit 
around the nucleus of the atom. Electron orbits 
are organized into shells. The maximum number 
of electrons present in the first shell is 2, in 
the second shell 8, and in the third, fourth and 
fifth shells it is 18, 32 and 50, respectively. In 
electronics only the electron shell furthermost 
from the nucleus of an atom is important. It is 
important to note that the movement of electrons 
only involves those present in the outer valence 
shell.
If the valence shell contains the maximum 
number of electrons possible the electrons are 
rigidly bonded together and the material has 
the properties of an insulator. If, however, the 
valence shell does not have its full complement 
of electrons, the electrons can be easily loosened 
from their orbital bonds, and the material has the 
properties associated with an electrical conductor. 
An isolated silicon atom contains four electrons 
in its valence shell. When silicon atoms combine 
to form a solid crystal, each atom positions itself 
between four other silicon atoms in such a way 
that the valence shells overlap from one atom 
to another. This causes each individual valence 
electron to be shared by two atoms, as shown 
in Fig. 5.1. By sharing the electrons between 
four adjacent atoms each individual silicon atom 
appears to have eight electrons in its valence 
shell. This sharing of valence electrons is called 
covalent bonding.
In its pure state, silicon is an insulator because 
the covalent bonding rigidly holds all of the 
electrons, leaving no free (easily loosened) 
electrons to conduct current. If, however, an 
atom of a different element (i.e. an impurity) is 
introduced that has five electrons in its valence 
shell, a surplus electron will be present, as shown 
in Fig. 5.2. These free electrons become available 
for use as charge carriers and they can be 
made to move through the lattice by applying an 
external potential difference to the material.
Similarly, if the impurity element introduced into 
the pure silicon lattice has three electrons in its 
valence shell, the absence of the fourth electron 
needed for proper covalent bonding will produce 
a number of gaps into which electrons can fit, 
as shown in Fig. 5.3. These gaps are referred 
to as holes. Once again, current will flow when 
an external potential difference is applied to the 
material.
Figure 5.1 Lattice showing covalent bonding
Figure 5.2 Free negative charge carriers 
(electrons) produced by introducing a pentavalent 
impurity

5 Semiconductors
91
Regardless of whether the impurity element 
produces surplus electrons or holes, the material 
will no longer behave as an insulator, neither will 
it have the properties that we normally associate 
with a metallic conductor. Instead, we call the 
material a semiconductor – the term simply 
indicates that the substance is no longer a good 
insulator or a good conductor but is somewhere in 
between!
The process of introducing an atom of another 
(impurity) element into the lattice of an otherwise 
pure material is called doping. When the pure 
material has been doped with an impurity 
with five electrons in its valence shell (i.e. a 
pentavalent impurity) it will become an N-type 
material. If, however, the pure material is doped 
with an impurity having three electrons in its 
valence shell (i.e. a trivalent impurity) it will 
become a P-type material. N-type semiconductor 
material contains an excess of negative charge 
carriers, and P-type material contains an excess of 
positive charge carriers.
Semiconductor diodes
When a junction is formed between N-type and 
P-type semiconductor materials, the resulting 
device is called a diode. This component offers 
an extremely low resistance to current flow in 
one direction and an extremely high resistance 
to current flow in the other. This characteristic 
allows the diode to be used in applications that 
require a circuit to behave differently according to 
the direction of current flowing in it.
An ideal diode would pass an infinite current in 
one direction and no current at all in the other 
direction. In addition, the diode would start to 
conduct current when the smallest of voltages 
was present. In practice, a small voltage must 
be applied before conduction takes place. 
Furthermore, a small leakage current will flow 
in the reverse direction. This leakage current is 
usually a very small fraction of the current that 
flows in the forward direction.
If the P-type semiconductor material is made 
positive relative to the N-type material by an 
amount greater than its forward threshold 
voltage (about 0.6 V if the material is silicon and 
0.2 V if the material is germanium), the diode 
will freely pass current. If, on the other hand, 
the P-type material is made negative relative 
to the N-type material, virtually no current will 
flow unless the applied voltage exceeds the 
maximum (breakdown) voltage that the device 
can withstand. Note that a normal diode will be 
destroyed if its reverse breakdown voltage is 
exceeded.
A semiconductor junction diode is shown in 
Fig. 5.4. The connection to the P-type material is 
referred to as the anode while that to the N-type 
material is called the cathode. With no externally 
applied potential, electrons from the N-type 
material will cross into the P-type region and fill 
some of the vacant holes. This action will result 
in the production of a region either side of the 
junction in which there are no free charge carriers. 
This zone is known as the depletion region.

trivalent impurity
Figure 5.4 A P–N junction diode

92
the negative potential applied to the N-type 
material will cause the free negative charge 
carriers to move away from the negative potential 
towards the junction.
When the positive and negative charge carriers 
arrive at the junction, they will attract one 
another and combine (recall that unlike charges 
attract). As each negative and positive charge 
carrier combine at the junction, a new negative 
and positive charge carrier will be introduced 
to the semiconductor material from the voltage 
source. As these new charge carriers enter the 
semiconductor material, they will move towards 
the junction and combine. Thus, current flow is 
established and it will continue for as long as the 
voltage is applied.
As stated earlier, the forward threshold voltage 
must be exceeded before the diode will conduct. 
The forward threshold voltage must be high 
enough to completely remove the depletion 
layer and force charge carriers to move across 
the junction. With silicon diodes, this forward 
threshold voltage is approximately 0.6 V to 0.7 V. 
With germanium diodes, the forward threshold 
voltage is approximately 0.2 V to 0.3 V.
Fig. 5.6 shows typical characteristics for small 
germanium and silicon diodes. It is worth noting 
Fig. 5.5(a) shows a junction diode in which the 
anode is made positive with respect to the 
cathode. In this forward-biased condition, the 
diode freely passes current. Figure 5.5(b) shows 
a diode with the cathode made positive with 
respect to the cathode. In this reverse-biased 
condition, the diode passes a negligible amount 
of current. In the freely conducting forward-biased 
state, the diode acts rather like a closed switch. 
In the reverse-biased state, the diode acts like an 
open switch.
If a positive voltage is applied to the P-type 
material, the free positive charge carriers will 
be repelled and they will move away from the 
positive potential towards the junction. Likewise,

The characteristic shown in Fig. 5.8 refers to a

and (b) when the forward voltage is 0.65 V.
Solution
(a) When IF = 2.5 mA the corresponding value of 
VF can be read from the graph. This shows that 
VF = 0.43 V. The resistance of the diode at this

This example shows how the resistance 
of a diode does not remain constant but 
instead changes according to the point on the 
characteristic at which it is operating. 
that diodes are limited by the amount of forward 
current and reverse voltage they can withstand. 
This limit is based on the physical size and 
construction of the diode.
In the case of a reverse-biased diode, the 
P-type material is negatively biased relative to 
the N-type material. In this case, the negative 
potential applied to the P-type material attracts 
the positive charge carriers, drawing them 
away from the junction. Likewise, the positive 
potential applied to the N-type material attracts 
the negative charge carriers away from the 
junction. This leaves the junction area depleted; 
virtually no charge carriers exist. Therefore, the 
junction area becomes an insulator, and current 
flow is inhibited. The reverse bias potential may 
be increased to the reverse breakdown voltage 
for which the particular diode is rated. As in the 
case of the maximum forward current rating, the 
reverse breakdown voltage is specified by the 
manufacturer. The reverse breakdown voltage 
is usually very much higher than the forward 
threshold voltage. A typical general-purpose diode 
may be specified as having a forward threshold 
voltage of 0.6 V and a reverse breakdown voltage 
of 200 V. If the latter is exceeded, the diode 
may suffer irreversible damage. It is also worth 
noting that, where diodes are designed for use 
as rectifiers, manufacturers often quote peak 
inverse voltage (PIV) or maximum reverse 
repetitive voltage (VRRM) rather than maximum 
reverse breakdown voltage. 
Fig. 5.7 shows a test circuit for obtaining diode 
characteristics (note that the diode must be 
reverse connected in order to obtain the reverse 
characteristic).

negligible current flowing below the avalanche 
voltage and an increasingly large current flowing 
once the avalanche voltage has been reached. 
For avalanche diodes, this breakdown voltage 
usually occurs at voltages above 6 V. In practice, 
however, both types of diode are referred to as 
zener diodes. A typical characteristic for a 12 V 
zener diode is shown in Fig. 5.10. 
Whereas reverse breakdown is a highly 
undesirable effect in circuits that use conventional 
diodes, it can be extremely useful in the case 
of zener diodes where the breakdown voltage 
is precisely known. When a diode is undergoing 
reverse breakdown and provided its maximum 
Diode types
Diodes are often divided into signal or rectifier 
types according to their principal field of 
application. Signal diodes require consistent 
forward characteristics with low forward voltage 
drop. Rectifier diodes need to be able to cope 
with high values of reverse voltage and large 
values of forward current, consistency of 
characteristics is of secondary importance in 
such applications. Table 5.1 summarizes the 
characteristics of some common semiconductor 
diodes while a selection of diodes are shown in 
Fig. 5.9.
Zener diodes
Zener diodes are heavily doped silicon diodes 
which, unlike normal diodes, exhibit an abrupt 
reverse breakdown at relatively low voltages 
(typically less than 6 V). A similar effect occurs 
in less heavily doped diodes. These avalanche 
diodes also exhibit a rapid breakdown with

which, in turn, varies with the reverse voltage 
applied to the diode. This allows a diode to be 
used as a voltage controlled capacitor. Diodes 
that are specially manufactured to make use of 
this effect (and which produce comparatively 
large changes in capacitance for a small change 
in reverse voltage) are known as variable 
capacitance diodes (or varicaps). Such diodes are 
used (often in pairs) to provide tuning in radio and 
TV receivers. A typical characteristic for a variable 
capacitance diode is shown in Fig. 5.12. Table 
5.3 summarizes the characteristics of several 
common variable capacitance diodes.
Thyristors
Thyristors (or silicon controlled rectifiers) are 
three-terminal devices which can be used for 
switching and a.c. power control. Thyristors can 
switch very rapidly from a conducting to a non-
conducting state. In the off state, the thyristor 
exhibits negligible leakage current, while in the on 
state the device exhibits very low resistance. This 
ratings are not exceeded the voltage appearing 
across it will remain substantially constant (equal 
to the nominal zener voltage) regardless of the 
current flowing. This property makes the zener 
diode ideal for use as a voltage regulator (see 
Chapter 6).
Zener diodes are available in various families 
(according to their general characteristics, 
encapsulation and power ratings) with reverse 
breakdown (zener) voltages in the E12 and E24 
series (ranging from 2.4 V to 91 V). Table 5.2 
summarizes the characteristics of common zener 
diodes.
Figure 5.11 shows a test circuit for obtaining 
zener diode characteristics. The circuit is shown 
with the diode connected in the forward direction 
and it must be reverse connected in order to 
obtain the reverse characteristic. Finally, it is 
important to note that, when used as a voltage 
regulator, the cathode connection is the more 
positive terminal.
Variable capacitance diodes
The capacitance of a reverse-biased diode junction 
will depend on the width of the depletion layer

Triacs
Triacs are a refinement of the thyristor which, 
when triggered, conduct on both positive and 
negative half-cycles of the applied voltage. Triacs 
have three terminals known as main-terminal one 
(MT1), main-terminal two (MT2) and gate (G), 
as shown in Fig. 5.14. Triacs can be triggered 
by both positive and negative voltages applied 
between G and MT1 with positive and negative 
voltages present at MT2, respectively. Triacs 
thus provide full-wave control and offer superior 
performance in a.c. power control applications 
when compared with thyristors which only 
provide half-wave control. Table 5.5 summarizes 
results in very little power loss within the thyristor 
even when appreciable power levels are being 
controlled. Once switched into the conducting 
state, the thyristor will remain conducting (i.e. it is 
latched in the on state) until the forward current is 
removed from the device. In d.c. applications this 
necessitates the interruption (or disconnection) 
of the supply before the device can be reset into 
its non-conducting state. Where the device is 
used with an alternating supply, the device will 
automatically become reset whenever the main 
supply reverses. The device can then be triggered 
on the next half-cycle having correct polarity to 
permit conduction. Like their conventional silicon 
diode counterparts, thyristors have anode and 
cathode connections; control is applied by means 
of a gate terminal (see Fig. 5.13). The device 
is triggered into the conducting (on state) by 
means of the application of a current pulse to this 
terminal. The effective triggering of a thyristor 
requires a gate trigger pulse having a fast rise 
time derived from a low-resistance source. 
Triggering can become erratic when insufficient 
gate current is available or when the gate current 
changes slowly. Table 5.4 summarizes the 
characteristics of several common thyristors.

In order to limit the forward current of an LED 
to an appropriate value, it is usually necessary 
to include a fixed resistor in series with an LED 
indicator, as shown in Fig. 5.16. The value of the 
resistor may be calculated from:
F

R
V

where VF is the forward voltage drop produced by 
the LED and V is the applied voltage. Note that it 
is usually safe to assume that VF will be 2 V and 
choose the nearest preferred value for R.
Example 5.2
An LED is to be used to indicate the presence of 
a 21 V d.c. supply rail. If the LED has a nominal 
forward voltage of 2.2 V, and is rated at a current 
of 15 mA, determine the value of series resistor 
required.

the characteristics of several common triacs. In 
order to simplify the design of triggering circuits, 
triacs are often used in conjunction with diacs 
(equivalent to a bi-directional zener diode). A 
typical diac conducts heavily when the applied 
voltage exceeds approximately 30 V in either 
direction. Once in the conducting state, the 
resistance of the diac falls to a very low value and 
thus a relatively large value of current will flow. 
The characteristic of a typical diac is shown in 
Fig. 5.15.
Light emitting diodes
Light emitting diodes (LEDs) can be used as 
general-purpose indicators and, compared with 
conventional filament lamps, operate from 
significantly smaller voltages and currents. LEDs 
are also very much more reliable than filament 
lamps. Most LEDs will provide a reasonable level 
of light output when a forward current of between 
5 mA and 20 mA is applied.
LEDs are available in various formats, with the 
round types being most popular. Round LEDs are 
commonly available in the 3 mm and 5 mm (0.2 
inch) diameter plastic packages; LEDs are also 
available in a 5 mm × 2 mm rectangular format. 
The viewing angle for round LEDs tends to be in 
the region of 20° to 40°, whereas for rectangular 
types this is increased to around 100°. Table 
5.6 summarizes the characteristics of several 
common types of LED.

circuit is determined by the current flowing in the 
input circuit. Since transistors are three-terminal 
devices, one electrode must remain common to 
both the input and the output.
The nearest preferred value is 1.2 kΩ. The power 
dissipated in the resistor will be given by:
P = I × V = 15 mA × 18.8 V = 280 mW
Hence the resistor should be rated at 0.33 W, or 
greater.
Diode coding
The European system for classifying 
semiconductor diodes involves an alphanumeric 
code which employs either two letters and three 
figures (general-purpose diodes) or three letters 
and two figures (special-purpose diodes). Table 
5.7 shows how diodes are coded. Note that the 
cathode connection of most wire-ended diodes is 
marked with a stripe.
Example 5.3
Identify each of the following diodes:
(a)	AA113
(b)	BB105
(c)	BZY88C4V7.
Solution
Diode (a) is a general-purpose germanium 
diode. Diode (b) is a silicon variable capacitance 
diode. Diode (c) is a silicon zener diode having 
±5% tolerance and 4.7 V zener voltage.

5 Semiconductors

Transistors fall into two main categories: bipolar 
junction transistors (BJTs) and field effect 
transistors (FETs), and are also classified 
according to the semiconductor material 
employed (silicon or germanium) and to their field 
of application (e.g. general-purpose, switching, 
high-frequency, etc.). Various classes of transistor 
are available according to the application 
concerned (see Table 5.8).
BJT operation
Bipolar junction transistors generally comprise 
NPN or PNP junctions of either silicon (Si) or 
germanium (Ge) material (see Figs 5.17 and 
5.18). The junctions are, in fact, produced in 
a single slice of silicon by diffusing impurities 
through a photographically reduced mask. Silicon 
transistors are superior when compared with 
germanium transistors in the vast majority of 
applications (particularly at high temperatures) 
and thus germanium devices are very rarely 
encountered. 
Figures 5.19(a) and 5.19(b), respectively, show 
a simplified representation of NPN and PNP 
transistors together with their circuit symbols. In 
either case the electrodes are labelled collector, 
base and emitter. Note that each junction within 
the transistor, whether it be collector–base or 
base–emitter, constitutes a P–N junction. Figures 
5.20(a) and 5.20(b), respectively, show the normal 
bias voltages applied to NPN and PNP transistors. 
Note that the base–emitter junction is forward 
biased and the collector–base junction is reverse 
biased. The base region is, however, made very

audio and radio frequency types)

Transistors that operate at medium power and voltage levels and which are often used to 
precede a final (power) stage which operates at an appreciable power level
narrow so that carriers are swept across it from 
emitter to collector and only a relatively small 
current flows in the base. To put this into context, 
the current flowing in the emitter circuit is 
typically 100 times greater than that flowing in the 
base. The direction of conventional current flow 
is from emitter to collector in the case of a PNP

transistor, and collector to emitter in the case of 
an NPN device. The equation that relates current 
flow in the collector, base and emitter currents is:
IE = IB + IC
where IE is the emitter current, IB is the base 
current and IC is the collector current (all 
expressed in the same units).
Bipolar transistor characteristics
The characteristics of a transistor are often 
presented in the form of a set of graphs relating 
voltage and current present at the transistor’s 
terminals. 
A typical input characteristic (IB plotted 
against VBE) for a small-signal general-purpose 
NPN transistor operating in common-emitter 
mode (see Chapter 7) is shown in Fig. 5.21. 
This characteristic shows that very little base 
current flows until the base–emitter voltage 
(VBE) exceeds 0.6 V. Thereafter, the base current 
increases rapidly (this characteristic bears a 
close resemblance to the forward part of the 
characteristic for a silicon diode, see Fig. 5.6).
Fig. 5.22 shows a typical output characteristic 
(IC plotted against VCE) for a small-signal general-
purpose NPN transistor operating in common-
emitter mode (see Chapter 7). This characteristic

NPN and (b) PNP bipolar junction transistors

5 Semiconductors
101
Finally, a typical transfer characteristic (IC plotted 
against IB) for a small-signal general purpose 
NPN transistor operating in common-emitter 
mode (see Chapter 7) is shown in Fig. 5.23. This 
characteristic shows an almost linear relationship 
between collector current and base current (i.e. 
doubling the value of base current produces 
double the value of collector current, and so on). 
This characteristic is reasonably independent of 
the value of collector-emitter voltage (VCE) and 
thus only a single curve is used.
Current gain
The current gain offered by a transistor is a 
measure of its effectiveness as an amplifying 
device. The most commonly quoted parameter is 
that which relates to common-emitter mode. In 
this mode, the input current is applied to the base 
and the output current appears in the collector 
(the emitter is effectively common to both the 
input and output circuits).
The common-emitter current gain is given by:
FE
C
B
=
h
I
I
where hFE is the hybrid parameter which 
represents large signal (d.c.) forward current 
gain, IC is the collector current and IB is the base 
current. When small (rather than large) signal 
operation is considered, the values of IC and IB are 
incremental (i.e. small changes rather than static 
values). The current gain is then given by:
fe
C
B
D
D
=
h
I
I
where hfe is the hybrid parameter which 
represents small signal (a.c.) forward current 
gain, DIC is the change in collector current which 
results from a corresponding change in base 
current, DIB. 
Values of hFE and hfe can be obtained from the 
transfer characteristic (IC plotted against IB) as 
shown in Figs 5.23 and 5.24. Note that hFE is 
found from corresponding static values while 
hfe is found by measuring the slope of the graph. 
Also note that, if the transfer characteristic is 
linear, there is little (if any) difference between hFE 
and hfe. 
Figure 5.22 Typical family of output (collector) 
characteristics for a small-signal NPN BJT 
operating in common-emitter mode
Figure 5.23 Typical transfer characteristic for 
a small-signal NPN BJT operating in common-
emitter mode
comprises a family of curves, each relating to 
a different value of base current (IB). It is worth 
taking a little time to get familiar with this 
characteristic as we shall be putting it to good use 
in Chapter 7. In particular, it is important to note 
the ‘knee’ that occurs at values of VCE of about 
2 V. Also, note how the curves become flattened 
above this value, with the collector current (IC) not 
changing very greatly for a comparatively large 
change in collector–emitter voltage (VCE).

Example 5.4
A transistor operates with IC = 30 mA and 
IB = 600 μA. Determine the value of IE and hFE.
Solution
The value of IE can be calculated from IC + IB, thus:
IE = 30 + 0.6 = 30.6 mA
The value of hFE can be found from hFE = IC /IB, 
thus:
hFE = IC /IB = 30/0.6 = 50
Example 5.5
A transistor operates with a collector current of 
97 mA and an emitter current of 98 mA. 
Determine the value of base current and 
common-emitter current gain.
Solution
Since IE = IC + IB, the base current will be given by:
IB = IE − IC = 98 − 97 = 1 mA
The common-emitter current gain (hFE) will be 
given by:
hFE = IC /IB = 97/1 = 97
Example 5.6
An NPN transistor is to be used in a regulator 
circuit in which a collector current of 1.5 A is to be 
controlled by a base current of 50 mA. What value 
of hFE will be required? 
If the device is to be operated with VCE = 6 V, 
which transistor selected from Table 5.10 would 
be appropriate for this application and why?
It is worth noting that current gain (hfe) varies 
with collector current. For most small-signal 
transistors, hfe is a maximum at a collector current 
in the range 1 mA and 10 mA. Furthermore, 
current gain falls to very low values for power 
transistors when operating at very high values 
of collector current. Another point worth 
remembering is that most transistor parameters 
(particularly common-emitter current gain, hfe) are 
liable to wide variation from one device to the 
next. It is, therefore, important to design circuits 
on the basis of the minimum value for hfe in order 
to ensure successful operation with a variety of 
different devices.
Transistor parameters are listed in Table 5.9, 
while Table 5.10 shows the characteristics of 
several common types of bipolar transistor. 
Finally, Fig. 5.25 shows a test circuit for obtaining 
NPN transistor characteristics (the arrangement 
for a PNP transistor is similar but all meters and 
supplies are reversed). A typical BJT data sheet is 
shown in Fig. 5.26.

small-signal values of current gain (hFE and hfe

The required current gain can be found from:

The most appropriate device would be the BD131. 
The only other device capable of operating at a 
collector current of 1.5 A would be a 2N3055. 
The collector power dissipation will be given by: 
PC = IC × VCE = 1.5 A × 6 V = 9 W
However, the 2N3055 is rated at 115 W 
maximum total power dissipation and this is more 
than ten times the power required.

A transistor is used in a linear amplifier 
arrangement. The transistor has small and large

and bias is arranged so that the static value of 
collector current is 10 mA. Determine the value 
of base bias current and the change of output 
(collector) current that would result from a 10 μA 
change in input (base) current.
Solution
The value of base bias current can be determined
from:
IB = IC /hFE = 10 mA / 200 = 50 μA

the input resistance of a bipolar transistor 
operating in common-emitter mode (see Chapter 
7) is usually around 2.5 kΩ whereas a JFET device 
operating in equivalent common-source mode 
(see Chapter 7) would typically exhibit an input 
resistance of 100 MΩ. This feature makes JFET 
devices ideal for use in applications where a very 
high input resistance is desirable.
FET characteristics
As with bipolar transistors, the characteristics of 
a FET are often presented in the form of a set 
of graphs relating voltage and current present 
at the transistor’s terminals. A typical mutual 
characteristic (ID plotted against VGS) for a small-
signal general-purpose N-channel JFET operating 
in common-source mode (see Chapter 7) is 
shown in Fig. 5.29. This characteristic shows that 
the drain current is progressively reduced as the 
gate–source voltage is made more negative. At a 
certain value of VGS the drain current falls to zero 
and the device is said to be cut-off.
Fig. 5.30 shows a typical output characteristic 
(ID plotted against VDS) for a small-signal general-
purpose N-channel JFET operating in common-
source mode (see Chapter 7). This characteristic 
Field effect transistors
Field effect transistors (FETs) comprise a channel 
of P-type or N-type material surrounded by 
material of the opposite polarity. The ends of 
the channel (in which conduction takes place) 
form electrodes known as the source and drain. 
The effective width of the channel (in which 
conduction takes place) is controlled by a charge 
placed on the third (gate) electrode. The effective 
resistance between the source and drain is thus 
determined by the voltage present at the gate.
FETs are available in two basic forms; junction 
gate and insulated gate. The gate-source 
junction of a junction gate field effect transistor 
(JFET) is effectively a reverse-biased P–N 
junction. The gate connection of an insulated 
gate field effect transistor (IGFET), on the other 
hand, is insulated from the channel and charge 
is capacitively coupled to the channel. To keep 
things simple, we will consider only JFET 
devices in this book. Fig. 5.27 shows the basic 
construction of an N-channel JFET while Fig. 5.28 
shows its symbol and simplified model. 
JFETs offer a much higher input resistance when 
compared with bipolar transistors. For example,

different devices. JFET parameters are shown in 
Table 5.11.
The characteristics of several common 
N-channel field effect transistors are shown in 
Table 5.12. Figure 5.31 shows a test circuit for 
obtaining the characteristics of an N-channel FET 
(the arrangement for a P-channel FET is similar 
but all meters and supplies must be reversed). 
A typical N-channel JFET data sheet is shown in 
Fig. 5.32.
Example 5.8
A FET operates with a drain current of 50 mA and 
a gate–source bias of −2 V. If the device has a gfs 
of 0.025 S, determine the change in drain current 
if the bias voltage increases to −2.5 V.
comprises a family of curves, each relating to 
a different value of gate-source voltage (VGS). It 
is worth taking a little time to get familiar with 
this characteristic as we shall be using it again 
in Chapter 7 (you might also like to compare this 
characteristic with the output characteristic for 
a transistor operating in common-emitter mode 
(see Fig. 5.22).
Once again, the characteristic curves have a 
‘knee’ that occurs at low values of VDS. Also, 
note how the curves become flattened above 
this value with the drain current (ID) not changing 
very greatly for a comparatively large change in 
drain–source voltage (VDS). These characteristics 
are, in fact, even flatter than those for a bipolar 
transistor. Because of their flatness, they are 
often said to represent a constant current 
characteristic.
JFET parameters
The gain offered by a FET is normally expressed 
in terms of its forward transfer conductance (gfs 
or Yfs) in common-source mode. In this mode, 
the input voltage is applied to the gate and the 
output current appears in the drain (the source is 
effectively common to both the input and output 
circuits).
The common-source forward transfer 
conductance is given by:
=

V
fs
D
GS
D
D
where DID is the change in drain current resulting 
from a corresponding change in gate–source 
voltage (DVGS). The units of forward transfer 
conductance are siemens (S).
Forward transfer conductance (gfs) varies with 
drain current collector current. For most small-
signal devices, gfs is quoted for values of drain 
current between 1 mA and 10 mA. It’s also worth 
noting that most FET parameters (particularly 
forward transfer conductance) are liable to 
wide variation from one device to the next. It 
is, therefore, important to design circuits on the 
basis of the minimum value for gfs in order to 
ensure successful operation with a variety of

characteristics for an N-channel JFET operating in

Solution
The change in gate-source voltage (DVgs) is −0.5 V 
and the resulting change in drain current can be 
determined from:
DID = DVGS × gfs = 0.025 S × −0.5 V = −0.0125 A
This DID = −12.5 mA 
The new value of drain current will thus be 
(50 mA − 12.5 mA) or 37.5 mA.
The mutual characteristic shown in Fig. 5.33 
illustrates this change in drain current. Note how 
the drain current falls in response to the change in 
gate–source voltage.
Transistor packages
A wide variety of packaging styles are used for 
transistors. Small-signal transistors tend to have 
either plastic packages (e.g. TO92) or miniature 
metal cases (e.g. TO5 or TO18). Medium- and 
high-power devices may also be supplied in 
plastic cases but these are normally fitted with 
integral metal heat-sinking tabs (e.g. TO126, 
TO218 or TO220) in order to conduct heat away

diodes). With the exception of a few specialized 
applications (such as amplification at high power 
levels) integrated circuits have largely rendered 
a great deal of conventional discrete circuitry 
obsolete. 
Integrated circuits can be divided into two 
general classes, linear (analogue) and digital. 
Typical examples of linear integrated circuits are 
operational amplifiers (see Chapter 8) whereas 
typical examples of digital integrated are logic 
gates (see Chapter 10). 
A number of devices bridge the gap between the 
analogue and digital world. Such devices include 
Transistor coding
The European system for classifying transistors 
involves an alphanumeric code which employs 
either two letters and three figures (general-
purpose transistors) or three letters and two 
figures (special-purpose transistors). Table 5.13 
shows how transistors are coded.
Example 5.9
Identify each of the following transistors:
(a) AF115
(b) BC109
(c) BD135
(d) BFY51.
Solution
(a) Transistor (a) is a general-purpose, low-power, 
high-frequency germanium transistor. 
(b) Transistor (b) is a general-purpose, low-power, 
low-frequency silicon transistor. 
(c) Transistor (c) is a general-purpose, high- 
power, low-frequency silicon transistor. 
(d) Transistor (d) is a special-purpose, low-power, 
high-frequency silicon transistor.
Integrated circuits
Integrated circuits (ICs) are complex circuits 
fabricated on a small slice of silicon. Integrated 
circuits may contain as few as 10 or more 
than 100,000 active devices (transistors and

analogue-to-digital converters (ADCs), digital-
to-analogue converters (DACs) and timers. For 
example, the ubiquitous 555 timer contains two 
operational amplifier stages (configured as voltage 
comparators) together with a digital bistable 
stage, a buffer amplifier and an open-collector 
transistor.
IC packages
As with transistors, a variety of different packages 
are used for integrated circuits. The most popular 
form of encapsulation used for integrated circuits 
is the dual-in-line (DIL) package which may be 
fabricated from either plastic or ceramic material 
(with the latter using a glass hermetic sealant). 
Common DIL packages have 8, 14, 16, 28 and 
40 pins on a 0.1 inch matrix. 
Flat package (flatpack) construction (featuring 
both glass–metal and glass–ceramic seals and 
welded construction) are popular for planar 
mounting on flat circuit boards. No holes are 
required to accommodate the leads of such 
devices which are arranged on a 0.05 inch pitch 
(i.e. half the pitch used with DIL devices). Single-
in-line (SIL) and quad-in-line (QIL) packages are 
also becoming increasingly popular while TO5, 
TO72, TO3 and TO220 encapsulations are also 
found (the latter being commonly used for three-
terminal voltage regulators). Fig. 5.36 shows a 
variety of common integrated circuit packages 
while Fig. 5.37 shows a modern LSI device.

CHAPTER 6
Power supplies
Chapter summary
This chapter deals with the unsung hero of most electronic systems, 
the power supply. Nearly all electronic circuits require a source of well-
regulated d.c. at voltages of typically between 5 V and 30 V. In some cases 
this supply can be derived directly from batteries (e.g. 6 V, 9 V, 12 V) but 
in many others it is desirable to make use of a standard a.c. mains outlet. 
This chapter explains how rectifier and smoothing circuits operate and 
how power supply output voltages can be closely regulated. The chapter 
concludes with a brief description of some practical power supply circuits.

Figure 6.2 Block diagram of a d.c. power supply showing principal components
Figure 6.3 A simple d.c. power supply
Figure 6.1 Block diagram of a d.c. power supply
The block diagram of a d.c. power supply is 
shown in Fig. 6.1. Since the mains input is at a 
relatively high voltage, a step-down transformer of 
appropriate turns ratio is used to convert this to a 
low voltage. The a.c. output from the transformer 
secondary is then rectified using conventional 
silicon rectifier diodes (see Chapter 5) to produce 
an unsmoothed (sometimes referred to as 
pulsating d.c.) output. This is then smoothed and 
filtered before being applied to a circuit which will 
regulate (or stabilize) the output voltage so that 
it remains relatively constant in spite of variations 
in both load current and incoming mains voltage. 
Fig. 6.2 shows how some of the electronic 
components that we have already met can be 
used in the realization of the block diagram in 
Fig. 6.1. The iron-cored step-down transformer 
feeds a rectifier arrangement (often based on 
a bridge circuit). The output of the rectifier is 
then applied to a high-value reservoir capacitor. 
This capacitor stores a considerable amount of 
charge and is being constantly topped-up by the 
rectifier arrangement. The capacitor also helps to 
smooth out the voltage pulses produced by the 
rectifier. Finally, a stabilizing circuit (often based 
on a series transistor regulator and a zener 
diode voltage reference) provides a constant 
output voltage. We shall now examine each stage 
of this arrangement in turn, building up to some 
complete power supply circuits at the end of the 
chapter.
Rectifiers
Semiconductor diodes (see Chapter 5) are 
commonly used to convert alternating current 
(a.c.) to direct current (d.c), in which case they 
are referred to as rectifiers. The simplest form 
of rectifier circuit makes use of a single diode 
and, since it operates on only either positive or 
negative half-cycles of the supply, it is known as a 
half-wave rectifier.
Fig. 6.4 shows a simple half-wave rectifier circuit. 
Mains voltage (220 to 240 V) is applied to the 
primary of a step-down transformer (T1). The 
secondary of T1 steps down the 240 V r.m.s. 
to 12 V r.m.s. (the turns ratio of T1 will thus 

6 Power supplies
119
be 240/12 or 20:1). Diode D1 will only allow 
the current to flow in the direction shown (i.e. 
from cathode to anode). D1 will be forward 
biased during each positive half-cycle (relative to 
common) and will effectively behave like a closed 
switch. When the circuit current tries to flow in 
the opposite direction, the voltage bias across the 
diode will be reversed, causing the diode to act 
like an open switch (see Figs 6.5(a) and 6.5(b), 
respectively).
The switching action of D1 results in a pulsating 
output voltage which is developed across the load 
resistor (RL). Since the mains supply is at 50 Hz, 
the pulses of voltage developed across RL will 
also be at 50 Hz even if only half the a.c. cycle is 
present. During the positive half-cycle, the diode 
will drop the 0.6 V to 0.7 V forward threshold 
voltage normally associated with silicon diodes. 
However, during the negative half-cycle the peak 
a.c. voltage will be dropped across D1 when it is 
reverse biased. This is an important consideration 
when selecting a diode for a particular application. 
Assuming that the secondary of T1 provides 
12 V r.m.s., the peak voltage output from the 
transformer’s secondary winding will be given by:

The peak voltage applied to D1 will thus be 
approximately 17 V. The negative half-cycles are 
blocked by D1 and thus only the positive half-
cycles appear across RL. Note, however, that the 
actual peak voltage across RL will be the 17 V 
positive peak being supplied from the secondary 
on T1, minus the 0.7 V forward threshold voltage 
dropped by D1. In other words, positive half-cycle 
pulses having a peak amplitude of 16.3 V will 
appear across RL.

is connected to a 220 V r.m.s. mains supply. If

Fig. 6.6 shows a considerable improvement to the 
circuit of Fig. 6.4. The capacitor, C 1, has been 
added to ensure that the output voltage remains 
at, or near, the peak voltage even when the diode

Fig. 6.7 shows the secondary voltage waveform 
together with the voltage developed across RL 
with and without C1 present. This gives rise to a 
small variation in the d.c. output voltage (known 
as ripple). Since ripple is undesirable we must 
take additional precautions to reduce it. One 
obvious method of reducing the amplitude of the 
ripple is that of simply increasing the discharge 
time constant. This can be achieved either by 
increasing the value of C1 or by increasing the 
resistance value of RL. In practice, however, the 
latter is not really an option because RL is the 
effective resistance of the circuit being supplied 
and we don’t usually have the ability to change 
it! Increasing the value of C1 is a more practical 
alternative and very large capacitor values (often 
in excess of 4,700 μF) are typical.
Fig. 6.8 shows a further refinement of the simple 
power supply circuit. This circuit employs two 
additional components, R1 and C1, which act 
as a filter to remove the ripple. The value of 
C1 is chosen so that the component exhibits a 
negligible reactance at the ripple frequency (50 Hz 
for a half-wave rectifier or 100 Hz for a full-wave 
first applied to T1, the first positive half-cycle 
output from the secondary will charge C1 to the 
peak value seen across RL. Hence C1 charges 
to 16.3 V at the peak of the positive half-cycle. 
Because C1 and RL are in parallel, the voltage 
across RL will be the same as that across C1.
The time required for C1 to charge to the 
maximum (peak) level is determined by the 
charging circuit time constant (the series 
resistance multiplied by the capacitance value). In 
this circuit, the series resistance comprises the 
secondary winding resistance together with the 
forward resistance of the diode and the (minimal) 
resistance of the wiring and connections. Hence 
C1 charges very rapidly as soon as D1 starts 
to conduct.
The time required for C1 to discharge is, in 
contrast, very much greater. The discharge time 
constant is determined by the capacitance value 
and the load resistance, RL. In practice, RL is very 
much larger than the resistance of the secondary 
circuit and hence C1 takes an appreciable time 
to discharge. During this time, D1 will be reverse 
biased and will thus be held in its non-conducting 
state. As a consequence, the only discharge path 
for C1 is through RL.
C1 is referred to as a reservoir capacitor. 
It stores charge during the positive half-
cycles of secondary voltage and releases it 
during the negative half-cycles. The circuit of 
Fig. 6.6 is thus able to maintain a reasonably 
constant output voltage across RL. Even so, 
C1 will discharge by a small amount during the 
negative half-cycle periods from the transformer 
secondary.

Example 6.3
The L–C smoothing filter in a 50 Hz mains 
operated half-wave rectifier circuit consists of 
L1 = 10 H and C2 = 1,000 μF. If 1 V of ripple 
appears at the input of the circuit, determine the 
amount of ripple appearing at the output.
Solution
Once again, the reactance of the capacitor, C1, is 
3.18 Ω (see Example 6.2). The reactance of L1 at 
50 Hz can be calculated from:
XL = 2πfL = 2 × 3.14 × 50 × 10 = 3,140 Ω

(i.e. appearing across C1) will be approximately

Hence the ripple produced by this arrangement 
(with 1 V of 50 Hz a.c. superimposed on the 
rectified input) will be a mere 1 mV. It is worth 
comparing this value with that obtained from the 
previous example! 
Finally, it is important to note that the amount of 
ripple present at the output of a power supply will 
increase when the supply is loaded.
Full-wave rectifiers
Unfortunately, the half-wave rectifier circuit is 
relatively inefficient as conduction takes place 
only on alternate half-cycles. A better rectifier 
arrangement would make use of both positive and 
negative half-cycles. These full-wave rectifier 
circuits offer a considerable improvement over 
their half-wave counterparts. They are not only 
more efficient but are significantly less demanding 
in terms of the reservoir and smoothing 
rectifier – see later). In effect, R1 and C1 act like a 
potential divider. The amount of ripple is reduced 
by an approximate factor equal to:

Improved ripple filters
A further improvement can be achieved 
by using an inductor, L1, instead of a resistor 
in the smoothing circuit. This circuit also 
offers the advantage that the minimum 
d.c. voltage is dropped across the inductor 
(in the circuit of Fig. 6.7, the d.c. output voltage 
is reduced by an amount equal to the voltage 
drop across R1).
Fig. 6.9 shows the circuit of a half-wave power 
supply with an L–C smoothing circuit. At the 
ripple frequency, L1 exhibits a high value of 
inductive reactance while C1 exhibits a low value 
of capacitive reactance. The combined effect is 
that of an attenuator which greatly reduces the 
amplitude of the ripple while having a negligible 
effect on the direct voltage.

Furthermore, this current is derived alternately 
from the two secondary windings.
As with the half-wave rectifier, the switching 
action of the two diodes results in a pulsating 
output voltage being developed across the load 
resistor (RL). However, unlike the half-wave circuit 
the pulses of voltage developed across RL will 
occur at a frequency of 100 Hz (not 50 Hz). This 
doubling of the ripple frequency allows us to 
use smaller values of reservoir and smoothing 
capacitor to obtain the same degree of ripple 
reduction (recall that the reactance of a capacitor 
is reduced as frequency increases).
As before, the peak voltage produced by each 
of the secondary windings will be approximately 
17 V and the peak voltage across RL will be 16.3 V 
components. There are two basic forms of full-
wave rectifier; the bi-phase type and the bridge 
rectifier type.
Bi-phase rectifier circuits
Fig. 6.10 shows a simple bi-phase rectifier circuit. 
Mains voltage (240 V) is applied to the primary of 
the step-down transformer (T1) which has two 
identical secondary windings, each providing 12 V 
r.m.s. (the turns ratio of T1 will thus be 240/12 or 
20:1 for each secondary winding).
On positive half-cycles, point A will be positive 
with respect to point B. Similarly, point B will be 
positive with respect to point C. In this condition 
D1 will allow conduction (its anode will be positive 
with respect to its cathode) while D2 will not 
allow conduction (its anode will be negative with 
respect to its cathode). Thus D1 alone conducts 
on positive half-cycles.
On negative half-cycles, point C will be positive 
with respect to point B. Similarly, point B will be 
positive with respect to point A. In this condition 
D2 will allow conduction (its anode will be positive 
with respect to its cathode) while D1 will not 
allow conduction (its anode will be negative with 
respect to its cathode). Thus D2 alone conducts 
on negative half-cycles.
Fig. 6.11 shows the bi-phase rectifier circuit with 
the diodes replaced by switches. In Fig. 6.11(a) 
D1 is shown conducting on a positive half-cycle 
while in Fig. 6.11(b) D2 is shown conducting. The 
result is that current is routed through the load 
in the same direction on successive half-cycles.

Bridge rectifier circuits
An alternative to the use of the bi-phase circuit 
is that of using a four-diode bridge rectifier (see 
Fig. 6.14) in which opposite pairs of diodes 
conduct on alternate half-cycles. This arrangement 
avoids the need to have two separate secondary 
windings.
A full-wave bridge rectifier arrangement is shown 
in Fig. 6.15. Mains voltage (240 V) is applied to 
the primary of a step-down transformer (T1). 
The secondary winding provides 12 V r.m.s. 
(approximately 17 V peak) and has a turns ratio 
of 20:1, as before. On positive half-cycles, point 
A will be positive with respect to point B. In this 
condition D1 and D2 will allow conduction while 
D3 and D4 will not allow conduction. Conversely, 
on negative half-cycles, point B will be positive 
with respect to point A. In this condition D3 and 
D4 will allow conduction while D1 and D2 will not 
allow conduction.
Fig. 6.16 shows the bridge rectifier circuit 
with the diodes replaced by four switches. In 
Fig. 6.16(a) D1 and D2 are conducting on a 
positive half-cycle while in Fig. 6.16(b) D3 and 
(i.e. 17 V less the 0.7 V forward threshold voltage 
dropped by the diodes).
Fig. 6.12 shows how a reservoir capacitor (C1) 
can be added to ensure that the output voltage 
remains at, or near, the peak voltage even when 
the diodes are not conducting. This component 
operates in exactly the same way as for the 
half-wave circuit, i.e. it charges to approximately 
16.3 V at the peak of the positive half-cycle and 
holds the voltage at this level when the diodes 
are in their non-conducting states. The time 
required for C1 to charge to the maximum (peak) 
level is determined by the charging circuit time 
constant (the series resistance multiplied by 
the capacitance value). In this circuit, the series 
resistance comprises the secondary winding 
resistance together with the forward resistance 
of the diode and the (minimal) resistance of 
the wiring and connections. Hence C1 charges 
very rapidly as soon as either D1 or D2 starts to 
conduct. The time required for C1 to discharge is, 
in contrast, very much greater. The discharge time 
contrast is determined by the capacitance value 
and the load resistance, RL. In practice, RL is very 
much larger than the resistance of the secondary 
circuit and hence C1 takes an appreciable time 
to discharge. During this time, D1 and D2 will be 
reverse biased and held in a non-conducting state. 
As a consequence, the only discharge path for C1 
is through RL. Fig. 6.13 shows voltage waveforms 
for the bi-phase rectifier, with and without C1 
present. Note that the ripple frequency (100 Hz) 
is twice that of the half-wave circuit shown 
previously in Fig. 6.7.

holds the voltage at this level when the diodes are 
in their non-conducting states. This component 
operates in exactly the same way as for the 
bi-phase circuit and the secondary and rectified 
output waveforms are shown in Fig. 6.18. Once 
again note that the ripple frequency is twice that 
of the incoming a.c. supply.
Finally, R–C and L–C ripple filters can be added 
to bi-phase and bridge rectifier circuits in exactly 
the same way as those shown for the half-wave 
rectifier arrangement (see Figs 6.8 and 6.9).
Voltage regulators
A simple voltage regulator is shown in Fig. 6.19. 
RS is included to limit the zener current to a safe 
value when the load is disconnected. When a 
load (RL) is connected, the zener current (IZ) will 
fall as current is diverted into the load resistance 
(it is usual to allow a minimum current of 2 mA to 
5 mA in order to ensure that the diode regulates). 
The output voltage (VZ) will remain at the zener 
voltage until regulation fails at the point at 
which the potential divider formed by RS and RL 
D4 are conducting. Once again, the result is that 
current is routed through the load in the same 
direction on successive half-cycles. As with the 
bi-phase rectifier, the switching action of the two 
diodes results in a pulsating output voltage being 
developed across the load resistor (RL). Once 
again, the peak output voltage is approximately 
16.3 V (i.e. 17 V less the 0.7 V forward threshold 
voltage).
Fig. 6.17 shows how a reservoir capacitor (C1) 
can be added to maintain the output voltage when 
the diodes are not conducting. This component 
operates in exactly the same way as for the 
bi-phase circuit, i.e. it charges to approximately 
16.3 V at the peak of the positive half-cycle and

Output resistance and voltage 
regulation
In a perfect power supply, the output voltage 
would remain constant regardless of the current 
taken by the load. In practice, however, the 
output voltage falls as the load current increases. 
To account for this fact, we say that the power 
supply has internal resistance (ideally this should 
be zero). This internal resistance appears at the 
output of the supply and is defined as the change 
in output voltage divided by the corresponding 
change in output current. Hence:

Ideally, the value of regulation should be very

of the type shown in Fig. 6.19 are capable of

components produce values of between 1% and

determine a suitable value of series resistor for

that TR1’s dissipation increases as the output 
voltage is reduced).

Practical power supply circuits
Fig. 6.20 shows a simple power supply circuit 
capable of delivering an output current of up to  
250 mA. The circuit uses a full-wave bridge 
rectifier arrangement (D1 to D4) and a simple 
C–R filter. The output voltage is regulated by the 
shunt-connected 12 V zener diode.
Fig. 6.21 shows an improved power supply in 
which a transistor is used to provide current gain 
and minimize the power dissipated in the zener 
diode (TR1 is sometimes referred to as a series-
pass transistor). The zener diode, D5, is rated at 
13 V and the output voltage will be approximately 
0.7 V less than this (i.e. 13 V minus the base-
emitter voltage drop associated with TR1). Hence 
the output voltage is about 12.3 V. The circuit is 
capable of delivering an output current of up to  
500 mA (note that TR1 should be fitted with

arrangement shown in Fig. 6.26. Here C1 charges 
to the positive peak secondary voltage, while 
C2 and C3 charge to twice the positive peak 
secondary voltage. The result is that the output 
voltage is the sum of the voltages across C1 
and C3 which is three times the voltage that 
would be produced by a single diode. The ladder 
arrangement shown in Fig. 6.25 can be easily 
extended to provide even higher voltages but 
the efficiency of the circuit becomes increasingly 
impaired and high-order voltage multipliers of 
this type are only suitable for providing relatively 
small currents.
Switched mode power supplies
Power supplies can be divided into two principal 
categories, linear and non-linear types. Linear 
power supplies make use of conventional 
circuit voltage regulator. These devices are 
available in standard voltage and current ratings 
(e.g. 5 V, 12 V, 15 V at 1 A, 2 A and 5 A) and they 
provide excellent performance in terms of output 
resistance, ripple rejection and voltage regulation.
In addition, such devices usually incorporate 
overcurrent protection and can withstand a direct 
short-circuit placed across their output terminals. 
This is an essential feature in many practical 
applications!
Voltage multipliers
By adding a second diode and capacitor, we 
can increase the output of the simple half-wave 
rectifier that we met earlier. A voltage doubler 
using this technique is shown in Fig. 6.25. In this 
arrangement C1 will charge to the positive peak 
secondary voltage while C2 will charge to the 
negative peak secondary voltage. Since the output 
is taken from C1 and C2 connected in series the 
resulting output voltage is twice that produced by 
one diode alone.
The voltage doubler can be extended to 
produce higher voltages using the cascade

arrangement is part of a high-voltage d.c. supply.

positive and negative. When S1 is closed, the 
voltage dropped across the inductor (from left to 
right in the diagram) will be equal to +(Vin − Vout). 
When S1 is open, the voltage across the inductor 
will be equal to −Vout (less the small forward 
voltage drop of the switching diode, D). The 
average current through the inductor, IL , is equal 
to the load current, Iout. Note that a small amount 
of ripple voltage appears superimposed on the 
steady output voltage, Vout. This ripple voltage can 
be reduced by using a relatively large value for the 
capacitor, C.
In order to control the voltage delivered to the 
load, Vout, it is simply necessary to adjust the ratio 
analogue control techniques – the regulating 
device operates through a continuous range of 
current and voltage according to the input and 
load conditions prevailing at the time. Non-
linear power supplies, on the other hand, use 
digital techniques where the regulating device 
is switched rapidly ‘on’ and ‘off’ in order to 
control the mean current and voltage delivered 
to the load. These non-linear power supplies are 
commonly referred to as switched mode power 
supplies or just SMPS. Note that SMPS can be 
used to step-up (boost) or step-down (buck) the 
input voltage.
Compared with their conventional linear 
counterparts, the advantages of SMPS are:
X
X ability to cope with a very wide input voltage 
range
X
X very high efficiency (typically 80% or more)
X
X compact size and light weight.
The disadvantages of SMPS are:
X
X relatively complex circuitry
X
X appreciable noise generated (resulting from 
the high switching frequency switching 
action).
Fortunately, the principle of the basic step-
down type switched mode regulator is quite 
straightforward. Take a look at the circuit diagram 
shown in Fig. 6.27. With S1 closed, the switching 
diode, D, will be reverse biased and will thus be in 
a non-conducting state. Current will flow through 
the inductor, L, charging the capacitor, C, and 
delivering current to the load, RL.
Current flowing in the inductor, IL, produces 
a magnetic flux in its core. When S1 is 
subsequently opened, the magnetic flux within 
the inductor rapidly collapses and an e.m.f. is 
generated across the terminals of the inductor. 
The polarity of the induced e.m.f. is such that 
it opposes the original potential and will cause 
current to continue to flow in the load (i.e. 
clockwise around the circuit). In this condition, the 
switching diode, D, will become forward biased, 
completing the circuit in order to provide a return 
path for the current.
Waveforms for the circuit of Fig. 6.27 are shown 
in Fig. 6.28. The inductor voltage, VL, is alternately

operation. The frequency of the internal current 
controlled oscillator is set by the value of 
the capacitor connected to pin 12. Oscillator 
frequencies of between 100 Hz and 100 kHz are 
possible but most practical applications operate 
at frequencies between 20 kHz and 50 kHz. The 
oscillator duty cycle is internally set to 6:1 but can 
be varied by means of the current-sensing circuit 
which normally senses the current in an external 
resistor connected between pins 12 and 13.
An internal band-gap voltage reference provides 
a stable voltage reference of 1.3 V at pin 8. The 
internal reference voltage source is capable of 
providing a current of up to 10 mA drawn from 
pin 8. The output transistor, Q2, is capable of 
carrying a peak current of up to 1.5 A and has 
of ‘on’ to ‘off’ time of the switch. A larger ratio of 
‘on’ to ‘off’ time (i.e. a larger duty cycle or mark 
to space ratio) produces a greater output voltage, 
and vice versa.
In a practical switched mode power supply, 
the switch, S1, is replaced by a semiconductor 
switching device (i.e. a bipolar switching transistor 
or a MOSFET device). The switching device 
must have a low ‘on’ resistance and a high ‘off’ 
resistance and must be capable of switching from 
the ‘on’ state to the ‘off’ state in a very short time.
Regardless of whether it is a bipolar transistor 
or a MOSFET, the switching device is controlled 
by a train of rectangular pulses applied to its 
base or gate terminal. The output voltage can 
be controlled by varying the width of the pulses 
in this train. In a practical switched mode power 
supply, a closed-loop feedback path is employed 
in which the output voltage is sensed and fed 
back to the control input of a pulse generator. 
The result is pulse width modulation (PWM) of 
the pulse train to the switching device. This pulse 
width modulation can be achieved using a handful 
of discrete components or, more usually, is based 
on a dedicated switched mode controller chip.
The job of controlling a switched mode power 
supply is an ideal task for an integrated circuit 
and Fig. 6.30 shows the internal arrangement 
of a typical example, the LM78S40. This device 
contains two operational amplifiers (IC1 and IC2) 
designed to work as comparators, and a two-
stage Darlington transistor switch comprising an 
emitter-follower driver, Q1, and output switch, 
Q2. The LM78S40 is supplied in a 16-pin dual-in-
line (DIL) package.
The LM78S40 can be configured to provide 
step-up (boost), step-down (buck) and inverting

Chapter summary
This chapter introduces the basic concepts of amplifiers and amplification. 
It describes the most common types of amplifier and outlines the basic 
classes of operation used in both linear and non-linear amplifiers. The 
chapter also describes methods for predicting the performance of an 
amplifier based on equivalent circuits and on the use of semiconductor 
characteristics and load lines. Once again, we conclude with a selection of

Types of amplifier
Many different types of amplifier are found 
in electronic circuits. Before we explain the 
operation of transistor amplifiers in detail, we shall 
briefly describe the main types of amplifier.
a.c. coupled amplifiers
In a.c. coupled amplifiers, stages are coupled 
together in such a way that d.c. levels are isolated 
and only the a.c. components of a signal are 
transferred from stage to stage.
d.c. coupled amplifiers
In d.c. (or direct) coupled amplifiers, stages are 
coupled together in such a way that stages are not 
isolated to d.c. potentials. Both a.c. and d.c. signal 
components are transferred from stage to stage.
Large-signal amplifiers
Large-signal amplifiers are designed to cater for 
appreciable voltage and/or current levels (typically 
from 1 V to 100 V or more).
Small-signal amplifiers
Small-signal amplifiers are designed to cater for 
low-level signals (normally less than 1 V and often 
much smaller). Small-signal amplifiers have to be 
specially designed to combat the effects of noise.
Audio frequency amplifiers
Audio frequency amplifiers operate in the band of 
frequencies that is normally associated with audio 
signals (e.g. 20 Hz to 20 kHz).
Wideband amplifiers
Wideband amplifiers are capable of amplifying a 
very wide range of frequencies, typically from a 
few tens of hertz to several megahertz.
Radio frequency amplifiers
Radio frequency amplifiers operate in the band of 
frequencies that is normally associated with radio 
signals (e.g. from 100 kHz to over 1 GHz). Note 
that it is desirable for amplifiers of this type to 
be frequency selective and thus their frequency 
response may be restricted to a relatively narrow 
band of frequencies (see Fig. 7.9 on page 139).
Low-noise amplifiers
Low-noise amplifiers are designed so that they 
contribute negligible noise (signal disturbance) to 
the signal being amplified. These amplifiers are 
usually designed for use with very small signal 
levels (usually less than 10 mV or so).
Gain
One of the most important parameters of an 
amplifier is the amount of amplification or gain 
that it provides. Gain is simply the ratio of output 
voltage to input voltage, output current to input 
current, or output power to input power (see 
Fig. 7.2). These three ratios give, respectively, 
the voltage gain, current gain and power gain.

Class of operation
An important requirement of most amplifiers is 
that the output signal should be a faithful copy 
of the input signal, albeit somewhat larger in 
amplitude. Other types of amplifier are non-linear, 
in which case their input and output waveforms 
will not necessarily be similar. In practice, the 
degree of linearity provided by an amplifier can 
be affected by a number of factors including 
the amount of bias applied (see later) and the 
amplitude of the input signal. 
It is also worth noting that a linear amplifier will 
become non-linear when the applied input signal 
exceeds a threshold value. Beyond this value the 
amplifier is said to be overdriven and the output 
will become increasingly distorted if the input 
signal is further increased. 
Amplifiers are usually designed to be operated 
with a particular value of bias supplied to the 
active devices (i.e. transistors). For linear 
operation, the active device(s) must be operated 
in the linear part of their transfer characteristic 
(Vout plotted against Vin). In Fig. 7.3 the input and 
output signals for an amplifier are operating in 
linear mode. This form of operation is known 
as Class A and the bias point is adjusted to 
the mid-point of the linear part of the transfer 
characteristic. Furthermore, current will flow in 
the active devices used in a Class A amplifier 
during a complete cycle of the signal waveform. 
At no time does the current fall to zero.
Fig. 7.4 shows the effect of moving the bias point 
down the transfer characteristic and, at the same 
time, increasing the amplitude of the input signal. 
From this, you should notice that the extreme 
negative portion of the output signal has become 
distorted. This effect arises from the non-linearity 
of the transfer characteristic that occurs near the 
origin (i.e. the zero point). Despite the obvious 
Figure 7.2 Block diagram for an amplifi er 
showing input and output voltages and currents
Figure 7.3 Class A (linear) operation

7 Amplifiers
137
The output signal will only comprise a series of 
positive-going half-cycles and the active device(s) 
will only be conducting during half-cycles of the 
waveform (i.e. they will only be operating 50% of 
the time).
This mode of operation is known as Class B and 
is commonly used in high-efficiency push–pull 
power amplifiers where the two active devices in 
the output stage operate on alternate half-cycles 
of the waveform. 
Finally, there is one more class of operation to 
consider. The input and output waveforms for 
Class C operation are shown in Fig. 7.7. Here, 
the bias point is set at beyond the cut-off (zero) 
point and a very large input signal is applied. The 
output waveform will then comprise a series of 
quite sharp positive-going pulses. These pulses 
of current or voltage can be applied to a tuned 
circuit load in order to recreate a sinusoidal signal. 
In effect, the pulses will excite the tuned circuit 
non-linearity in the output waveform, the active 
device(s) will conduct current during a complete 
cycle of the signal waveform.
Now consider the case of reducing the bias 
even further while further increasing the 
amplitude of the input signal (see Fig. 7.5). Here 
the bias point has been set at the projected 
cut-off point. The negative-going portion of the 
output signal becomes cut-off (or clipped) and the 
active device(s) will cease to conduct for this part 
of the cycle. This mode of operation is known as 
Class AB.
Now let’s consider what will happen if no bias 
at all is applied to the amplifier (see Fig. 7.6).

input signal amplitude (the output waveform is no 
longer a faithful reproduction of the input)

projected cut-off)

this chapter. Finally, it’s important to note that, 
although these resistances are meaningful in 
terms of the signals present, they cannot be 
measured using a conventional meter!
Frequency response
The frequency response characteristics for 
various types of amplifier are shown in Fig. 7.9. 
Note that, for response curves of this type, 
frequency is almost invariably plotted on a 
logarithmic scale.
The frequency response of an amplifier is usually 
specified in terms of the upper and lower cut-off 
frequencies of the amplifier. These frequencies 
are those at which the output power has dropped 
to 50% (otherwise known as the −3 dB points) or 
where the voltage gain has dropped to 70.7% of 
its mid-band value. 
Figs 7.10 and 7.11, respectively, show how the 
bandwidth can be expressed in terms of either 
power or voltage (the cut-off frequencies, f1 and 
f2, and bandwidth are identical). 
and its inherent flywheel action will produce 
a sinusoidal output waveform. This mode of 
operation is only used in RF power amplifiers that 
must operate at very high levels of efficiency. 
Table 7.1 summarizes the classes of operation 
used in amplifiers.
Input and output resistance
Input resistance is the ratio of input voltage to 
input current and it is expressed in ohms. The 
input of an amplifier is normally purely resistive 
(i.e. any reactive component is negligible) in the 
middle of its working frequency range (i.e. the 
mid-band). In some cases, the reactance of the 
input may become appreciable (e.g. if a large 
value of stray capacitance appears in parallel with 
the input resistance). In such cases we would 
refer to input impedance rather than input 
resistance.
Output resistance is the ratio of open-circuit 
output voltage to short-circuit output current and 
is measured in ohms. Note that this resistance 
is internal to the amplifier and should not be 
confused with the resistance of a load connected 
externally.
As with input resistance, the output of an 
amplifier is normally purely resistive and we 
can safely ignore any reactive component. If this 
is not the case, we would once again need to 
refer to output impedance rather than output 
resistance.
Fig. 7.8 shows how the input and output 
resistances are ‘seen’ looking into the input 
and output terminals, respectively. We shall be 
returning to this equivalent circuit a little later in

Solution
The mid-band voltage gain corresponds with the 
flat part of the frequency response characteristic. 
At that point the voltage gain reaches a maximum 
of 35 (see Fig. 7.12). 
The voltage gain at the two cut-off frequencies 
can be calculated from:
Av cut-off = 0.707 × Av max = 0.707 × 35 = 24.7
This value of gain intercepts the frequency 
response graph at f1 = 57 Hz and f2 = 590 kHz (see 
Fig. 7.12).
Bandwidth
The bandwidth of an amplifier is usually taken 
as the difference between the upper and 
lower cut-off frequencies (i.e. f2 − f1 in Figs 
7.10 and 7.11). The bandwidth of an amplifier 
must be sufficient to accommodate the range 
of frequencies present within the signals 
that it is to be presented with. Many signals 
contain harmonic components (i.e. signals at 
2f, 3f, 4f, etc. where f is the frequency of the 
fundamental signal). To reproduce a square 
wave, for example, requires an amplifier with a 
very wide bandwidth (note that a square wave 
comprises an infinite series of harmonics). Clearly 
it is not possible to perfectly reproduce such a 
wave, but it does explain why it can be desirable 
for an amplifier’s bandwidth to greatly exceed 
the highest signal frequency that it is required 
to handle!
Example 7.2

and lower cut-off frequencies for the amplifier 
whose frequency response is shown in Fig. 7.12.

feedback determines the overall (or closed-loop) 
gain. Because this form of feedback has the effect 
of reducing the overall gain of the circuit, this form 
of feedback is known as negative feedback. An 
alternative form of feedback, where the output 
is fed back in such a way as to reinforce the 
input (rather than to subtract from it) is known as 
positive feedback. This form of feedback is used 
in oscillator circuits (see Chapter 9). 
Fig. 7.13 shows the block diagram of an amplifier 
stage with negative feedback applied. In this 
circuit, the proportion of the output voltage fed 
back to the input is given by β and the overall 
voltage gain will be given by:

Phase shift
Phase shift is the phase angle between the input 
and output signal voltages measured in degrees. 
The measurement is usually carried out in the 
mid-band where, for most amplifiers, the phase 
shift remains relatively constant. Note also that 
conventional single-stage transistor amplifiers 
provide phase shifts of either 180° or 360°.
Negative feedback
Many practical amplifiers use negative feedback 
in order to precisely control the gain, reduce 
distortion and improve bandwidth. The gain can be 
reduced to a manageable value by feeding back 
a small proportion of the output. The amount of

Transistor amplifiers
Regardless of what type of transistor is employed, 
three basic circuit configurations are used. These 
three circuit configurations depend upon which 
one of the three transistor connections is made 
common to both the input and the output. In the 
case of bipolar transistors, the configurations 
are known as common emitter, common 
collector (or emitter follower) and common 
base. Where field effect transistors are used, 
the corresponding configurations are common 
source, common drain (or source follower) and 
common gate.
The three basic circuit configurations (Figs 7.14 
to 7.19) exhibit quite different performance 
Now Vin' = Vin − βVout (by applying Kirchhoff’s 
Voltage Law) (note that the amplifier’s input 
voltage has been reduced by applying negative 
feedback) thus:
Vin =Vin' + βVout
and
Vout = Av × Vin (note that Av is the internal gain 
of the amplifier)

Hence, the overall gain with negative feedback

applied will be given by:
G = 1/β (when Av is very large) 
Note, also, that the loop gain of a feedback 
amplifier is defined as the product of β and Av.

An amplifier with negative feedback applied has 
an open-loop voltage gain of 50, and one-tenth 
of its output is fed back to the input (i.e. β = 0.1).

Equivalent circuits
One method of determining the behaviour of an 
amplifier stage is to make use of an equivalent 
circuit. Fig. 7.20 shows the basic equivalent circuit 
of an amplifier. The output circuit is reduced to its 
Thévenin equivalent (see Chapter 3) comprising 
a voltage generator (Av × Vin) and a series input 
resistance, resistance (Rout). This simple model 
allows us to forget the complex circuitry that 
might exist within the amplifier box!

In practice, we use a slightly more complex 
equivalent circuit model in the analysis of a 
transistor amplifier. The most frequently used 
equivalent circuit is that which is based on 
hybrid parameters (or h-parameters). In this 
form of analysis, a transistor is replaced by four 
components; hi, hr, hf and ho (see Table 7.4). 
In order to indicate which one of the operating 
modes is used we add a further subscript letter 
to each h-parameter; e for common emitter, b for 
common base and c for common collector (see 
Table 7.5). However, to keep things simple, we 
will only consider common-emitter operation here.
Common-emitter input resistance 
(hie) 
The input resistance of a transistor is the 
resistance that is effectively ‘seen’ between 
its input terminals. As such, it is the ratio of the 
voltage between the input terminals to the current 
flowing into the input. In the case of a transistor 
operating in common-emitter mode, the input 
voltage is the voltage developed between the

Fig. 7.22 shows how the small-signal input

it is inside the transistor. From the foregoing we

The transistor’s input characteristic can be used 
to predict the input resistance of a transistor 
amplifier stage. Since the input characteristic is 
non-linear (recall that very little happens until the 
base-emitter voltage exceeds 0.6 V), the value 
of input resistance will be very much dependent 
on the exact point on the graph at which the 
transistor is being operated. Furthermore, we 
might expect quite different values of resistance 
according to whether we are dealing with larger 
d.c. values or smaller incremental changes 
(a.c. values). Since this can be a rather difficult 
concept, it is worth expanding on it. 
Fig. 7.23 shows a typical input characteristic 
in which the transistor is operated with a base 
current, IB, of 50 μA. This current produces a 
base-emitter voltage, VBE, of 0.65 V. The input

to 120 μA). Fig. 7.24 shows that this produces a

It is worth comparing this value with the steady 
(d.c.) value. The appreciable difference is 
entirely attributable to the shape of the input 
characteristic!
Common-emitter current gain (hfe)
The current gain produced by a transistor is the 
ratio of output current to input current. In the 
case of a transistor operating in common-emitter 
mode, the input current is the base current, Ib, 
while the output current is the collector current, Ic.
Fig. 7.25 shows the small-signal input and output 
currents and voltages for a common-emitter 
amplifier stage. The magnitude of the current 
produced at the output of the transistor is equal to 
the current gain, Ai, multiplied by the applied base 
current, Ib. Since the output current is the current 
flowing in the collector, Ic, we can deduce that:
Ic = Ai × Ib
where Ai = hfe (the common-emitter current gain).
Fig. 7.26 shows how this current source appears 
between the collector and emitter. Once again, 
the current source is not a discrete component – 
it appears inside the transistor.
The transistor’s transfer characteristic can be 
used to predict the current gain of a transistor 
amplifier stage. Since the transfer characteristic 
is linear, the current gain remains reasonably 
constant over a range of collector current. Fig. 
7.27 shows a typical transfer characteristic in 
which the transistor is operated with a base 
current, IB, of 240 μA. This current produces a 
collector current, IC, of 12 mA. The current gain 
corresponding to these steady (d.c.) values will be

(note that this is similar to the expression for hfe).

that varies above and below this value, swinging 
through a total change of 220 μA (i.e. from 120 μA 
to 360 μA). Fig. 7.28 shows that this produces a 
collector current swing of 10 mA. 
The small-signal a.c. current gain is given by:

This value of current is shared between the 
internal resistance between collector and emitter 
(i.e. 1/hoe) and the external load, RL. To determine 
the value of collector current, we can apply the

Once again, it is worth comparing this value with 
the steady state value (hFE). Since the transfer 
characteristic is reasonably linear, the values are 
quite close (45.45 compared with 50). However, 
if the transfer characteristic was perfectly linear 
the value of hfe would be exactly the same as that 
for hFE.
h-parameter equivalent circuit for 
a transistor in common-emitter 
mode
A complete h-parameter equivalent circuit for a 
transistor operating in common-emitter mode is 
shown in Fig. 7.29. We have already shown how 
the two most important parameters, hie and hfe, 
can be found from the transistor’s characteristic 
curves.
The remaining parameters, hre and hoe, can, in 
many applications, be ignored. A typical set of 
h-parameters for a BFY50 transistor is shown in 
Table 7.6. Note how small hre and hoe are for a real 
transistor!
Example 7.6
A BFY50 transistor is used in a common-emitter 
amplifier stage with RL = 10 kΩ and IC = 1 mA. 
Determine the output voltage produced by an 
input signal of 10 mV. (You may ignore the effect 
of hre and any bias components that may be 
present externally.)
Solution
The equivalent circuit (with hre replaced by a short 
circuit) is shown in Fig. 7.30. The load effectively 
appears between the collector and emitter while 
the input signal appears between the base and 
emitter. First we need to find the value of input

saturated nor should it be cut-off (i.e. the state in 
which no collector current flows). 
In order to ensure that a static value of collector 
current flows in a transistor, a small current must 
therefore be applied to the base of the transistor. 
This current can be derived from the same voltage 
rail that supplies the collector circuit (via the load). 
Fig. 7.31 shows a simple Class A common-emitter 
amplifier circuit in which the base bias resistor, 
R1, and collector load resistor, R2, are connected 
to a common positive supply rail.
The signal is applied to the base terminal of 
the transistor via a coupling capacitor, C1. This 
capacitor removes the d.c. component of any 
signal applied to the input terminals and ensures 
that the base bias current delivered by R1 is 
unaffected by any device connected to the input. 
C2 couples the signal out of the stage and also 
prevents d.c. current appearing at the output 
terminals. 
In order to stabilize the operating conditions 
for the stage and compensate for variations in 
transistor parameters, base bias current for the 
transistor can be derived from the voltage at the 
collector (see Fig. 7.32). This voltage is dependent 
on the collector current which, in turn, depends 
upon the base current. A negative feedback loop 
thus exists in which there is a degree of self-
regulation. If the collector current increases, the 
collector voltage will fall and the base current will 
be reduced. The reduction in base current will 
produce a corresponding reduction in collector 
current to offset the original change. Conversely, 
if the collector current falls, the collector voltage 
will rise and the base current will increase. This,

In the case of a common-emitter amplifier stage,

Bias
We stated earlier that the optimum value of bias 
for a Class A (linear) amplifier is that value which 
ensures that the active devices are operated at 
the midpoint of their transfer characteristics. In 
practice, this means that a static value of collector 
current will flow even when there is no signal 
present. Furthermore, the collector current will 
flow throughout the complete cycle of an input 
signal (i.e. conduction will take place over an 
angle of 360°). At no stage will the transistor be

a potential divider that determines the d.c. base 
potential, VB. The base-emitter voltage (VBE) is 
the difference between the potentials present 
at the base (VB ) and emitter (VE). The potential 
at the emitter is governed by the emitter current 
(IE). If this current increases, the emitter voltage 
(VE) will increase and, as a consequence, VBE will 
fall. This, in turn, produces a reduction in emitter 
current which largely offsets the original change. 
Conversely, if the emitter current decreases, the 
emitter voltage (VE) will decrease and VBE will 
increase (remember that VB remains constant). 
The increase in bias results in an increase in 
emitter current compensating for the original 
change.
Example 7.8

collector voltage in the circuit shown in Fig. 7.35.
in turn, will produce a corresponding increase in 
collector current to offset the original change.
The negative feedback path in Fig. 7.32 provides 
feedback that involves an a.c. (signal) component 
as well as the d.c. bias. As a result of the a.c. 
feedback, there is a slight reduction in signal gain. 
The signal gain can be increased by removing the 
a.c. signal component from the feedback path 
so that only the d.c. bias component is present. 
This can be achieved with the aid of a bypass 
capacitor, as shown in Fig. 7.33. The value of 
the bypass capacitor, C 1, is chosen so that the 
component exhibits a very low reactance at the 
lowest signal frequency when compared with the 
series base bias resistance, R1. The result of this 
potential divider arrangement is that the a.c. signal 
component is effectively bypassed to ground.
Fig. 7.34 shows an improved form of transistor 
amplifier in which d.c. negative feedback is 
used to stabilize the stage and compensate for 
variations in transistor parameters, component 
values and temperature changes. R1 and R2 form

where RL is the value of collector or drain load 
resistance.
Fig. 7.36 shows a load line superimposed on a set 
of output characteristics for a bipolar transistor 
operating in common-emitter mode. The 
quiescent point (or operating point) is the point on 
the load line that corresponds to the conditions 
that exist when no-signal is applied to the stage. 
In Fig. 7.36, the base bias current is set at 
20 μA so that the quiescent point effectively sits 
roughly halfway along the load line. This position 
ensures that the collector voltage can swing 
both positively (above) and negatively (below) its 
quiescent value (VCQ). 
The effect of superimposing an alternating 
base current (of 20 μA peak–peak) to the d.c. 
bias current (of 20 μA) can be clearly seen. The 
corresponding collector current signal can be 
determined by simply moving up and down the 
load line.

Next we should determine the base current. 
This is a little more difficult. The base current is 
derived from the potential divider formed by R1 
and R2. The potential at the junction of R1 and 
R2 is 2.6 V, hence we can determine the currents 
through R1 and R2. The difference between these 
currents will be equal to the base current.

Finally we can determine the collector voltage by

Hence VC = 9 V − 4.43 V = 4.57 V
Predicting amplifier performance
The a.c. performance of an amplifier stage can 
be predicted using a load line superimposed on 
the relevant set of output characteristics. For a 
bipolar transistor operating in common-emitter 
mode the required characteristics are IC plotted 
against VCE. One end of the load line corresponds 
to the supply voltage (VCC ) while the other end 
corresponds to the value of collector or drain 
current that would flow with the device totally 
saturated. In this condition:

Note that the maximum and minimum values of 
base current will be (30 μA + 20 μA) on positive 
peaks of the signal and (30 μA − 20 μA) on 
negative peaks of the signal. The maximum and 
minimum values of VCE are, respectively, 14.8 V 
and 3.3 V. Hence the output voltage swing will be 
(14.8 V − 3.3 V) or 11.5 V peak–peak.
Practical amplifier circuits
The simple common-emitter amplifier stage 
shown in Fig. 7.38 provides a modest voltage 
gain (80 to 120 typical) with an input resistance of 
approximately 1.5 kΩ and an output resistance of 
around 20 kΩ. The frequency response extends 
from a few hertz to several hundred kilohertz.

produced by an input signal of 40 μA peak–peak.
Solution
First we need to construct the load line. The 
two ends of the load line will correspond to VCC 
(18 V) on the collector-emitter voltage axis and 
(18V/1.2 kΩ or 15 mA) on the collector current 
axis. Next we locate the operating point (or 
quiescent point) from the point of intersection of 
the IB = 30 μA characteristic and the load line. 
Having located the operating point we can read off 
the quiescent (no-signal) values of collector-emitter 
voltage (VCQ) and collector current (ICQ). Hence:
VCQ = 9.2 V and ICQ = 7.3 mA
Next we can determine the maximum and 
minimum values of collector-emitter voltage 
by locating the appropriate intercept points on 
Fig. 7.37.

Two practical emitter-follower circuits are shown 
in Figs 7.41 and 7.42. These circuits offer a 
voltage gain of unity (1) but are ideal for matching 
a high-resistance source to a low-resistance load. 
It is important to note that the input resistance 
varies with the load connected to the output of 
the circuit (it is typically in the range 50 kΩ to 
150 kΩ). The input resistance can be calculated 
by multiplying hfe by the effective resistance of R2 
in parallel with the load connected to the output 
terminals.
Fig. 7.42 is an improved version of Fig. 7.41 
in which the base current is derived from the 
potential divider formed by R1 and R2. Note, 
however, that the input resistance is reduced 
since R1 and R2 effectively appear in parallel with 
the input. The input resistance of the stage is thus 
typically in the region of 40 kΩ to 70 kΩ.
Multi-stage amplifiers
In order to provide sufficiently large values of 
gain, it is frequently necessary to use a number 
of interconnected stages within an amplifier. The 
Fig. 7.40 shows a practical common-emitter 
amplifier with bias stabilization. This stage 
provides a gain of 150 to well over 200 
(depending upon the current gain, hfe, of the 
individual transistor used). The circuit will operate 
with supply voltages of between 6 V and 18 V.

The most commonly used method is that of 
R–C coupling as shown in In Fig. 7.43(a). In this 
coupling method, the stages are coupled together 
using capacitors having a low reactance at the 
signal frequency and resistors (which also provide 
a means of connecting the supply). Fig. 7.44 
shows a practical example of this coupling 
method. 
A similar coupling method, known as L–C 
coupling, is shown in Fig. 7.43(b). In this method, 
the inductors have a high reactance at the signal 
frequency. This type of coupling is generally only 
used in RF and high-frequency amplifiers.
Two further methods, transformer coupling and 
direct coupling, are shown in Figs 7.43(c) and 
7.43(d), respectively. The latter method is used 
where d.c. levels present on signals must be 
preserved. 
Power amplifiers
The term ‘power amplifier’ can be applied to any 
amplifer that is designed to deliver an appreciable 
level of power. There are several important 
considerations for amplifiers of this type, including 
the ability to deliver current (as well as voltage) 
to a load, and also the need to operate with 
a reasonable degree of efficiency (recall that 
conventional Class A amplifiers are inefficient).
In order to deliver sufficient current to the load, 
power amplifiers must have a very low value of 
output impedance. Thus the final stage (or output 
stage) is usually based on a device operating 
in emitter-follower configuration. In order to 
operate at a reasonable level of efficiency, 
the output stage must operate in Class AB or 
overall gain of an amplifier with several stages 
(i.e. a multi-stage amplifier) is simply the product 
of the individual voltage gains. Hence:
AV = AV1 × AV2 × AV3, etc.
Note, however, that the bandwidth of a multi-
stage amplifier will be less than the bandwidth of 
each individual stage. In other words, an increase 
in gain can only be achieved at the expense of a 
reduction in bandwidth.
Signals can be coupled between the individual 
stages of a multi-stage amplifier using one of a 
number of different methods shown in Fig. 7.43.

interstage coupling

Class B mode (see page 137). One means of 
satisfying both of these requirements is with 
the use of a symmetrical output stage based on 
complementary NPN and PNP devices.
A simple complementary output stage is shown 
in Fig. 7.45. TR1 is a suitably rated NPN device 
while TR2 is an identically rated PNP device. Both 
TR1 and TR2 operate as emitter followers (i.e. 
common-collector mode) with the output taken 
from the two emitters, coupled via C2 to the 
load. In order to bias TR1 and TR2 into Class AB 
mode two silicon diodes (D1 and D2) are used to 
provide a constant voltage drop of approximately 
1.2 V between the two bases. This voltage drop 
is required between the bases of TR1 and TR2 in 
order to bring them to conduction. Since D1 and 
D2 are both in forward conduction (with current 
supplied via R1 and R2) they have little effect on 
the input signal (apart from shifting the d.c. level).
Fig. 7.46 shows an improvement of the basic 
complementary output stage with the addition 
of a driver stage (TR1) and a means of adjusting 
the bias (i.e. operating point) of the two output 
transistors. VR1 is typically adjusted in order 
to produce an output stage collector current of 
between 15 mA and 50 mA (required for Class AB 
operation). With VR1 set to minimum resistance, 
the output stage will operate in Class B (this will 
produce significantly more cross-over distortion 
because the two devices may both be cut-off for 
a brief period of each cycle). Fig. 7.47 shows how 
negative feedback bias (via R2) can be added in 
order to stabilize the output stage. Practical power 
amplifiers are shown in Figs 7.48 and 7.49.

CHAPTER 8
Operational amplifiers
Chapter summary
Operational amplifiers are analogue integrated circuits designed for linear 
amplification that offer near-ideal characteristics (virtually infinite voltage 
gain and input resistance coupled with low output resistance and wide 
bandwidth).
Operational amplifiers can be thought of as universal ‘gain blocks’ to which 
external components are added in order to define their function within 
a circuit. By adding two resistors, we can produce an amplifier having a 
precisely defined gain. Alternatively, with two resistors and two capacitors 
we can produce a simple band-pass filter. From this you might begin to 
suspect that operational amplifiers are really easy to use. The good news is 
that they are!

8 Operational amplifiers
Symbols and connections
The symbol for an operational amplifier is shown 
in Fig. 8.2. There are a few things to note about 
this. The device has two inputs and one output 
and no common connection. Furthermore, we 
often don’t show the supply connections – it 
is often clearer to leave them out of the circuit 
altogether!
In Fig. 8.2, one of the inputs is marked ‘−’ and the 
other is marked ‘+’. These polarity markings have 
nothing to do with the supply connections – they 
indicate the overall phase shift between each 
input and the output. The ‘+’ sign indicates zero 
phase shift while the ‘−’ sign indicates 180° phase 
shift. Since 180° phase shift produces an inverted 
waveform, the ‘−’ input is often referred to as the 
inverting input. Similarly, the ‘+’ input is known 
as the non-inverting input.
Most (but not all) operational amplifiers require 
a symmetrical supply (of typically ±6 V to ±15 V) 
which allows the output voltage to swing both 
positive (above 0 V) and negative (below 0 V). 
Fig. 8.3 shows how the supply connections would 
appear if we decided to include them. Note that 
we usually have two separate supplies; a positive 
supply and an equal, but opposite, negative 
supply. The common connection to these two 
supplies (i.e. the 0 V supply connection) acts as 
the common rail in our circuit. The input and 
output voltages are usually measured relative to 
this rail. 
Operational amplifier parameters
Before we take a look at some of the 
characteristics of ‘ideal’ and ‘real’ operational 
amplifiers it is important to define some of the 
terms and parameters that we apply to these 
devices.
Open-loop voltage gain
The open-loop voltage gain of an operational 
amplifier is defined as the ratio of output voltage 
to input voltage measured with no feedback 
applied. In practice, this value is exceptionally 
high (typically greater than 100,000) but is liable to 
considerable variation from one device to another. 
Open-loop voltage gain may thus be thought of as 
the ‘internal’ voltage gain of the device, thus:
A
V
V
=
V(OL)
OUT
IN
where AV(OL) is the open-loop voltage gain, 
VOUT and VIN are the output and input voltages, 
respectively, under open-loop conditions.
Figure 8.1 A typical operational amplifi er. This 
device is supplied in an eight-pin dual-in-line (DIL) 
package. It has a JFET input stage and produces a 
typical open-loop voltage gain of 200,000

amplifi er

8  Operational amplifiers
162
In linear voltage amplifying applications, a large 
amount of negative feedback will normally be 
applied and the open-loop voltage gain can be 
thought of as the internal voltage gain provided by 
the device. 
The open-loop voltage gain is often expressed in 
decibels (dB) rather than as a ratio. In this case: 
A
V
V
= 20log
V(OL)
10
OUT
IN
Most operational amplifiers have open-loop 
voltage gains of 90 dB or more.
Closed-loop voltage gain
The closed-loop voltage gain of an operational 
amplifier is defined as the ratio of output 
voltage to input voltage measured with a small 
proportion of the output fed-back to the input 
(i.e. with feedback applied). The effect of 
providing negative feedback is to reduce the loop 
voltage gain to a value that is both predictable 
and manageable. Practical closed-loop voltage 
gains range from one to several thousand but 
note that high values of voltage gain may make 
unacceptable restrictions on bandwidth (see later). 
Closed-loop voltage gain is once again the ratio of 
output voltage to input voltage but with negative 
feedback applied, hence:
A
V
V
=
V(CL)
OUT
IN
where AV(CL) is the open-loop voltage gain, VOUT and 
VIN are the output and input voltages, respectively, 
under closed-loop conditions. The closed-loop 
voltage gain is normally very much less than the 
open-loop voltage gain.
Example 8.1
An operational amplifier operating with negative 
feedback produces an output voltage of 2 V when 
supplied with an input of 400 μV. Determine the 
value of closed-loop voltage gain.

Input resistance
The input resistance of an operational amplifier 
is defined as the ratio of input voltage to input 
current expressed in ohms. It is often expedient 
to assume that the input of an operational 
amplifier is purely resistive, though this is not the 
case at high frequencies where shunt capacitive 
reactance may become significant. The input 
resistance of operational amplifiers is very much 
dependent on the semiconductor technology 
employed. In practice values range from about 
2 MΩ for common bipolar types to over 1012 Ω for 
FET and CMOS devices.
Input resistance is the ratio of input voltage to 
input current: 
R

I

where RIN is the input resistance (in ohms), VIN 
is the input voltage (in volts) and IIN is the input 
current (in amps). Note that we usually assume 
that the input of an operational amplifier is purely 
resistive though this may not be the case at high 
frequencies where shunt capacitive reactance 
may become significant. 
The input resistance of operational amplifiers 
is very much dependent on the semiconductor 
technology employed. In practice, values range 
from about 2 MΩ for bipolar operational amplifiers 
to over 1012 Ω for CMOS devices. 
Example 8.2
An operational amplifier has an input resistance of 
2 MΩ. Determine the input current when an input 
voltage of 5 mV is present.

Output resistance
The output resistance of an operational amplifier 
is defined as the ratio of open-circuit output 
voltage to short-circuit output current expressed 
in ohms. Typical values of output resistance range 
from less than 10 Ω to around 100 Ω, depending 
upon the configuration and amount of feedback 
employed. 
Output resistance is the ratio of open-circuit 
output voltage to short-circuit output current, 
hence: 
R

OUT(OC)
OUT(SC)
where ROUT is the output resistance (in ohms), 
VOUT(OC) is the open-circuit output voltage (in volts) 
and IOUT(SC) is the short-circuit output current (in 
amps).
Input offset voltage
An ideal operational amplifier would provide zero 
output voltage when 0 V difference is applied to 
its inputs. In practice, due to imperfect internal 
balance, there may be some small voltage present 
at the output. The voltage that must be applied 
differentially to the operational amplifier input in 
order to make the output voltage exactly zero is 
known as the input offset voltage. 
Input offset voltage may be minimized by applying 
relatively large amounts of negative feedback 
or by using the offset null facility provided by a 
number of operational amplifier devices. Typical 
values of input offset voltage range from 1 mV 
to 15 mV. Where a.c. rather than d.c. coupling 
is employed, offset voltage is not normally a 
problem and can be happily ignored.
Full-power bandwidth
The full-power bandwidth for an operational 
amplifier is equivalent to the frequency at which 
the maximum undistorted peak output voltage 
swing falls to 0.707 of its low-frequency (d.c.) 
value (the sinusoidal input voltage remaining 
constant). Typical full-power bandwidths range 
from 10 kHz to over 1 MHz for some high-speed 
devices.
Slew rate
Slew rate is the rate of change of output voltage 
with time, when a rectangular step input voltage 
is applied (as shown in Fig. 8.4). The slew rate of 
an operational amplifier is the rate of change of 
output voltage with time in response to a perfect 
step-function input. Hence: 
Slew rate
OUT
V
t
= D
D
where DVOUT is the change in output voltage (in 
volts) and Dt is the corresponding interval of time 
(in seconds). 
Slew rate is measured in V/s (or V/μs) and typical 
values range from 0.2 V/μs to over 20 V/μs. Slew 
rate imposes a limitation on circuits in which large 
amplitude pulses rather than small amplitude 
sinusoidal signals are likely to be encountered.

characteristics
Having defined the parameters that we use to 
describe operational amplifiers we shall now

consider the desirable characteristics for an ‘ideal’ 
operational amplifier. These are:
(a)	The open-loop voltage gain should be very high 
(ideally infinite). 
(b)	The input resistance should be very high 
(ideally infinite). 
(c)	The output resistance should be very low 
(ideally zero). 
(d)	Full-power bandwidth should be as wide as 
possible. 
(e)	Slew rate should be as large as possible. 
(f)	 Input offset should be as small as possible.
The characteristics of most modern integrated 
circuit operational amplifiers (i.e. ‘real’ operational 
amplifiers) come very close to those of an ‘ideal’ 
operational amplifier, as witnessed by the data 
shown in Table 8.1.

(c) a low-frequency amplifier for audio signals. 
Solution
(a) AD548 (this operational amplifier is designed 
for use in instrumentation applications and it 
offers a very low input offset current which 
is important when the input is derived from a 
piezoelectric transducer).
(b) CA3140 (this is a low-noise operational 
amplifier that also offers high gain and fast 
slew rate).
(c) LM348 or LM741 (both are general-purpose 
operational amplifiers and are ideal for non-
critical applications such as audio amplifiers).
Gain and bandwidth
It is important to note that the product of gain 
and bandwidth is a constant for any particular 
operational amplifier. Hence, an increase in 
gain can only be achieved at the expense of 
bandwidth, and vice versa. 
Fig. 8.5 shows the relationship between voltage 
gain and bandwidth for a typical operational 
amplifier (note that the axes use logarithmic 
rather than linear scales). The open-loop voltage 
gain (i.e. that obtained with no feedback applied) 
is 100,000 (or 100 dB) and the bandwidth 
obtained in this condition is a mere 10 Hz. The 
effect of applying increasing amounts of negative 
feedback (and consequently reducing the gain 
to a more manageable amount) is that the 
bandwidth increases in direct proportion.
The frequency response curves in Fig. 8.5 show 
the effect on the bandwidth of making the closed-
loop gains equal to 10,000, 1,000, 100, and 10. 
Table 8.3 summarizes these results. You should 
also note that the (gain × bandwidth) product for 
this amplifier is 1 × 106 Hz (i.e. 1 MHz).
We can determine the bandwidth of the amplifier 
when the closed-loop voltage gain is set to 46 dB 
by constructing a line and noting the intercept 
point on the response curve. This shows that 
the bandwidth will be 10 kHz (note that, for this 
operational amplifier, the (gain × bandwidth) 
product is 2 × 106 Hz (or 2 MHz).

Inverting amplifier with 
feedback
Fig. 8.6 shows the circuit of an inverting amplifier 
with negative feedback applied. For the sake 
of our explanation we will assume that the 
operational amplifier is ‘ideal’. Now consider what 
happens when a small positive input voltage is 
applied. This voltage (VIN) produces a current (IIN) 
flowing in the input resistor R1.
Since the operational amplifier is ‘ideal’ we will 
assume that: 
(a) the input resistance (i.e. the resistance that 
appears between the inverting and non-
inverting input terminals, RIC) is infinite 
(b) the open-loop voltage gain (i.e. the ratio of VOUT 
to VIN with no feedback applied) is infinite.
As a consequence of (a) and (b): 
Figure 8.5 Frequency response curves for an 
operational amplifi er

(i) the voltage appearing between the inverting 
and non-inverting inputs (VIC) will be zero, and 
(ii) the current flowing into the chip (IIC) will be 
zero (recall that IIC = VIC /RIC and RIC is infinite) 
Applying Kirchhoff’s Current Law at node A 
gives: 
IIN = IIC + IF but IIC = 0 thus IIN = IF 
(1)
(this shows that the current in the feedback 
resistor, R2, is the same as the input current, IIN ).
Applying Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law to loop A gives: 
VIN = (IIN × R1) + VIC 
but VIC = 0 thus VIN = IIN × R1 
(2)
Using Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law in loop B gives:
VOUT = –VIC + (IF × R2) 
but VIC = 0 thus VOUT = IF × R2 
(3)
Combining (1) and (3) gives: 
VOUT = IIN × R2 
(4)
The voltage gain of the stage is given by:

To preserve symmetry and minimize offset

From this point onwards (and to help you 
remember the function of the resistors) we 
shall refer to the input resistance as RIN and 
the feedback resistance as RF (instead of the 
more general and less meaningful R1 and R2, 
respectively).
Operational amplifier 
configurations
The three basic configurations for operational 
voltage amplifiers, together with the expressions 
for their voltage gain, are shown in Fig. 8.7. 
Supply rails have been omitted from these 
diagrams for clarity but are assumed to be 
symmetrical about 0 V.
All of the amplifier circuits described previously 
have used direct coupling and thus have 
frequency response characteristics that extend 
to d.c. This, of course, is undesirable for many 
applications, particularly where a wanted a.c. 
signal may be superimposed on an unwanted 
d.c. voltage level or when the bandwidth of the 
amplifier greatly exceeds that of the signal that it 
is required to amplify. In such cases, capacitors 
of appropriate value may be inserted in series 
with the input resistor, RIN, and in parallel with the 
feedback resistor, RF, as shown in Fig. 8.8. 
The value of the input and feedback capacitors, 
CIN and CF respectively, are chosen so as to roll-
off the frequency response of the amplifier at 
the desired lower and upper cut-off frequencies, 
respectively. The effect of these two capacitors 
on an operational amplifier’s frequency response 
is shown in Fig. 8.9.
By selecting appropriate values of capacitor, the 
frequency response of an inverting operational 
voltage amplifier may be very easily tailored to 
suit a particular set of requirements.
The lower cut-off frequency is determined by 
the value of the input capacitance, CIN, and input 
resistance, RIN. The lower cut-off frequency is 
given by:

where f1 is the lower cut-off frequency in hertz,

Example 8.6
An inverting operational amplifier is to operate 
according to the following specification: 
Voltage gain = 100 
Input resistance (at mid-band) = 10 kΩ 
Lower cut-off frequency = 250 Hz 
Upper cut-off frequency = 15 kHz 
Devise a circuit to satisfy the above specification 
using an operational amplifier. 
Solution
To make things a little easier, we can break 
the problem down into manageable parts. We 
shall base our circuit on a single operational 
amplifier configured as an inverting amplifier with 
capacitors to define the upper and lower cut-off 
frequencies, as shown in Fig. 8.9. 
The nominal input resistance is the same as the 
value for RIN. Thus: 
RIN = 10 kΩ 
To determine the value of RF we can make use of 
the formula for mid-band voltage gain:

thus R2 = Av × R1 = 100 × 10 kΩ = 100 kΩ

Operational amplifier circuits
As well as their application as a general-purpose 
amplifying device, operational amplifiers have a 
number of other uses, including voltage followers, 
differentiators, integrators, comparators and 
summing amplifiers. We shall conclude this section 
by taking a brief look at each of these applications.
Voltage followers
A voltage follower using an operational amplifier 
is shown in Fig. 8.11. This circuit is essentially an 
inverting amplifier in which 100% of the output 
is fed back to the input. The result is an amplifier 
that has a voltage gain of 1 (i.e. unity), a very high 
input resistance and a very high output resistance. 
This stage is often referred to as a buffer and is 
used for matching a high-impedance circuit to a 
low-impedance circuit. 
Typical input and output waveforms for a voltage 
follower are shown in Fig. 8.12. Notice how the 
input and output waveforms are both in-phase 
(they rise and fall together) and that they are 
identical in amplitude.
Figure 8.10 See Example 8.6. This operational 
amplifi er has a mid-band voltage gain of 10 over 
the frequency range 250 Hz to 15 kHz

8 Operational amplifiers
Differentiators
A differentiator using an operational amplifier 
is shown in Fig. 8.13. A differentiator produces 
an output voltage that is equivalent to the rate 
of change of its input. This may sound a little 
complex but it simply means that if the input 
voltage remains constant (i.e. if it isn’t changing) 
the output also remains constant. The faster the 
input voltage changes the greater will the output 
be. In mathematics this is equivalent to the 
differential function. 
Typical input and output waveforms for a 
differentiator are shown in Fig. 8.14. Notice how 
the square wave input is converted to a train of 
short duration pulses at the output. Note also 
that the output waveform is inverted because the 
signal has been applied to the inverting input of 
the operational amplifier.
Integrators
An integrator using an operational amplifier is 
shown in Fig. 8.15. This circuit provides the 
Figure 8.13 A differentiator
Figure 8.14 Typical input and output waveforms 
for a differentiator
Figure 8.15 An integrator
opposite function to that of a differentiator (see 
earlier) in that its output is equivalent to the area 
under the graph of the input function rather than 
its rate of change. If the input voltage remains 
constant (and is other than 0 V) the output voltage 
will ramp up or down according to the polarity of 
the input. The longer the input voltage remains 
at a particular value the larger the value of output 
voltage (of either polarity) will be produced. 
Typical input and output waveforms for an 
integrator are shown in Fig. 8.16. Notice how the 
square wave input is converted to a wave that 
has a triangular shape. Once again, note that the 
output waveform is inverted.
Comparators
A comparator using an operational amplifier is 
shown in Fig. 8.17. Since no negative feedback 
has been applied, this circuit uses the maximum 
gain of the operational amplifier. The output 
voltage produced by the operational amplifier will

for an integrator

170
thus rise to the maximum possible value (equal 
to the positive supply rail voltage) whenever the 
voltage present at the non-inverting input exceeds 
that present at the inverting input. Conversely, 
the output voltage produced by the operational 
amplifier will fall to the minimum possible 
value (equal to the negative supply rail voltage) 
whenever the voltage present at the inverting 
input exceeds that present at the non-inverting 
input. 
Typical input and output waveforms for a 
comparator are shown in Fig. 8.18. Notice how 
the output is either +15 V or –15 V depending on 
the relative polarity of the two inputs. A typical 
application for a comparator is that of comparing 
a  signal voltage with a reference voltage. The 
output will go high (or low) in order to signal the 
result of the comparison.

for a comparator
Figure 8.19 A summing amplifi er
Summing amplifiers
A summing amplifier using an operational 
amplifier is shown in Fig. 8.19. This circuit 
produces an output that is the sum of its two 
input voltages. However, since the operational 
amplifier is connected in inverting mode, the 
output voltage is given by:
VOUT = – (V1 + V2)
where V1 and V2 are the input voltages (note that 
all of the resistors used in the circuit have the 
same value). Typical input and output waveforms 
for a summing amplifier are shown in Fig. 8.20. 
A typical application is that of ‘mixing’ two input 
signals to produce an output voltage that is the 
sum of the two.

Practical investigation
Objective
To measure the voltage gain and frequency 
response of an inverting operational amplifier. 
Components and test equipment
Breadboard, AF signal generator (with variable-
frequency sine wave output), two AF voltmeters 
(or a dual-beam oscilloscope), ±9 V d.c. power 
supply (or two 9 V batteries), TL081 (or similar 
operational amplifier), 22 pF, 2.2 nF, 47 nF and 
220 nF capacitors, resistors of 10 kΩ and 100 kΩ 
5% 0.25 W, test leads, connecting wire.
Procedure
Connect the circuit shown in Fig. 8.22 with CIN = 
47 nF and CF = 2.2 nF, set the signal generator to 
produce an output of 100 mV at 1 kHz. Measure 
and record the output voltage produced and 
repeat this measurement for frequencies over the 
range 10 Hz to 100 kHz (see Table 8.4).
Replace CIN and CF with 220 nF and 22 pF 
capacitors and repeat the measurements, this 
time over the extended frequency range from 
1 Hz to 1 MHz, recording your results as shown in 
Table 8.5.
Measurements and graphs
Use the measured value of output voltage at 
1 kHz for both sets of measurements, in order 
to determine the mid-band voltage gain of the 
stage. For each set of measurements plot graphs 
Figure 8.21 A multi-stage amplifi er (both stages 
have tailored frequency responses)
Positive versus negative 
feedback
We have already shown how negative feedback 
can be applied to an operational amplifier in 
order to produce an exact value of gain. Negative 
feedback is frequently used in order to stabilize 
the gain of an amplifier and also to increase the 
frequency response (recall that, for an amplifier 
the product of gain and bandwidth is a constant). 
Positive feedback, on the other hand, results in 
an increase in gain and a reduction in bandwidth. 
Furthermore, the usual result of applying positive 
feedback is that an amplifier becomes unstable 
and oscillates (i.e. it generates an output without 
an input being present!). For this reason, positive 
feedback is only used in amplifiers when the 
voltage gain is less than unity.
The important thing to remember from all of 
this is that, when negative feedback is applied 
to an amplifier the overall gain is reduced and 
the bandwidth is increased (note that the gain × 
bandwidth product remains constant). When 
positive feedback is applied to an amplifier the 
overall gain increases and the bandwidth is 
reduced. In most cases this will result in instability 
and oscillation.
Multi-stage amplifiers
Multi-stage amplifiers can easily be produced 
using operational amplifiers. Coupling methods 
can be broadly similar to those described earlier 
in Chapter 7 (see page 152). As an example, 
Fig. 8.21 shows a two-stage amplifier in which 
each stage has a tailored frequency response. 
Note how C1 and C3 provide d.c. isolation 
between the stages as well as helping to 
determine the low-frequency roll-off.

showing the frequency response of the amplifier 
stage (see Fig. 8.23). In each case, use the 
graph to determine the lower and upper cut-off 
frequencies.

Positive feedback
In Chapter 7 we showed how negative feedback 
can be applied to an amplifier to form the basis of 
a stage which has a precisely controlled gain. An 
alternative form of feedback, where the output is 
fed back in such a way as to reinforce the input 
(rather than to subtract from it), is known as 
positive feedback.
Fig. 9.1 shows the block diagram of an amplifier 
stage with positive feedback applied. Note that 
the amplifier provides a phase shift of 180° and 
the feedback network provides a further 180°. 
Thus the overall phase shift is 0°. The overall 
voltage gain, G, is given by:

Now consider what will happen when the loop 
gain, βAv, approaches unity (i.e. when the loop 
gain is just less than 1). The denominator (1 − βAv) 
will become close to zero. This will have the 
effect of increasing the overall gain, i.e. the overall 
gain with positive feedback applied will be greater 
than the gain without feedback. 
It is worth illustrating this difficult concept using 
some practical figures. Assume that you have an 
amplifier with a gain of 9 and one-tenth of the 
output is fed back to the input (i.e. β = 0.1). In this 
case the loop gain (β × Av) is 0.9.

Now assume that you have an amplifier with

This simple example shows that a loop gain of 
unity (or larger) will result in infinite gain and an 
amplifier which is unstable. In fact, the amplifier 
will oscillate since any disturbance will be 
amplified and result in an output. 
Clearly, as far as an amplifier is concerned, 
positive feedback may have an undesirable 
effect – instead of reducing the overall gain the 
effect is that of reinforcing any signal present and 
the output can build up into continuous oscillation 
if the loop gain is 1 or greater. To put this another 
way, oscillator circuits can simply be thought of as 
amplifiers that generate an output signal without 
the need for an input!
Conditions for oscillation
From the foregoing we can deduce that the 
conditions for oscillation are:
(a) the feedback must be positive (i.e. the signal 
fed back must arrive back in-phase with the 
signal at the input); 
(b) the overall loop voltage gain must be greater 
than 1 (i.e. the amplifier’s gain must be 
sufficient to overcome the losses associated 
with any frequency selective feedback 
network). 
Hence, to create an oscillator we simply need 
an amplifier with sufficient gain to overcome 
the losses of the network that provide positive 
feedback. Assuming that the amplifier provides 
180° phase shift, the frequency of oscillation will 
be that at which there is 180° phase shift in the 
feedback network.
A number of circuits can be used to provide 180° 
phase shift, one of the simplest being a three-
stage C–R ladder network that we shall meet 
next. Alternatively, if the amplifier produces 
0° phase shift, the circuit will oscillate at the 
frequency at which the feedback network 
produces 0° phase shift. In both cases, the 
essential point is that the feedback should be 
positive so that the output signal arrives back 
at the input in such a sense as to reinforce the 
original signal.
Ladder network oscillator
A simple phase-shift oscillator based on a three- 
stage C–R ladder network is shown in Fig. 9.2. 
TR1 operates as a conventional common-emitter 
amplifier stage with R1 and R2 providing base 
bias potential and R3 and C1 providing emitter 
stabilization. 
The total phase shift provided by the C–R ladder 
network (connected between collector and 
base) is 180° at the frequency of oscillation. The 
transistor provides the other 180° phase shift in 
order to realize an overall phase shift of 360° or 0° 
(note that these are the same).
The frequency of oscillation of the circuit shown 
in Fig. 9.2 is given by:

The loss associated with the ladder network is 29, 
thus the amplifier must provide a gain of at least 
29 in order for the circuit to oscillate. In practice 
this is easily achieved with a single transistor.

Wien bridge oscillator
An alternative approach to providing the phase 
shift required is the use of a Wien bridge 
network (Fig. 9.3). Like the C–R ladder, this 
network provides a phase shift which varies with 
frequency. The input signal is applied to A and B 
while the output is taken from C and D. At one 
particular frequency, the phase shift produced by 
the network will be exactly zero (i.e. the input and 
output signals will be in-phase). If we connect the 
network to an amplifier producing 0° phase shift 
which has sufficient gain to overcome the losses 
of the Wien bridge, oscillation will result.
The minimum amplifier gain required to sustain 
oscillation is given by:

the sufficient base current will be available to 
completely saturate the respective transistor. The 
values of the collector load resistors, R1 and R2, 
are very much smaller than R3 and R4. When 
power is first applied to the circuit, assume that 
TR2 saturates before TR1 when the power is first 
applied (in practice one transistor would always 
saturate before the other due to variations in 
component tolerances and transistor parameters).
As TR2 saturates, its collector voltage will fall 
rapidly from +VCC to 0 V. This drop in voltage will 
be transferred to the base of TR1 via C1. This 
negative-going voltage will ensure that TR1 is 
initially placed in the non-conducting state. As 
long as TR1 remains cut-off, TR2 will continue to 
be saturated. During this time, C1 will charge via 
R4 and TR1’s base voltage will rise exponentially

Multivibrators
There are many occasions when we require a 
square wave output from an oscillator rather than 
a sine wave output. Multivibrators are a family of 
oscillator circuits that produce output waveforms 
consisting of one or more rectangular pulses. The 
term ‘multivibrator’ simply originates from the fact 
that this type of waveform is rich in harmonics 
(i.e. ‘multiple vibrations’).
Multivibrators use regenerative (i.e. positive) 
feedback; the active devices present within the 
oscillator circuit being operated as switches, being 
alternately cut-off and driven into saturation.
The principal types of multivibrator are:
(a) astable multivibrators that provide a 
continuous train of pulses (these are 
sometimes also referred to as free-running 
multivibrators);
(b) monostable multivibrators that produce a 
single output pulse (they have one stable state 
and are thus sometimes also referred to as 
‘one-shot’);
(c) bistable multivibrators that have two stable 
states and require a trigger pulse or control 
signal to change from one state to another.
The astable multivibrator
Fig. 9.6 shows a classic form of astable 
multivibrator based on two transistors. Fig. 9.7 
shows how this circuit can be redrawn in an 
arrangement that more closely resembles a two-
stage common-emitter amplifier with its output 
connected back to its input. In Fig. 9.6, the values 
of the base resistors, R3 and R4, are such that

TR2 is high (T2) will be determined by the time 
constant, R3 × C1.
The following approximate relationships apply:
T1 = 0.7 C 2 R4   and  T 2 = 0.7 C1 R 3
Since one complete cycle of the output occurs 
in a time, T = T1 + T 2, the periodic time of the 
output is given by:
T = 0.7 (C 2 R4 + C1 R3)
Finally, we often require a symmetrical square 
wave output where T 1 = T 2 . To obtain such an 
output, we should make R 3 = R4 and C 1 = C 2, in 
which case the periodic time of the output will be 
given by:
T = 1.4 C R
where C = C 1 = C 2 and R = R 3 = R 4. Waveforms 
for the astable oscillator are shown in Fig. 9.8.
Example 9.3
The astable multivibrator in Fig. 9.6 is required 
to produce a square wave output at 1 kHz. 
Determine suitable values for R 3 and R 4 if C 1 
and C 2 are both 10 nF.
Solution
Since a square wave is required and C 1 and C 2 
have identical values, R 3 must be made equal 
to R 4. Now:

Other forms of astable oscillator

form of astable oscillator which produces a 
triangular output waveform. Operational amplifier

connected with positive feedback to ensure that 
oscillation takes place.
from −VCC towards +VCC. However, TR1’s base 
voltage will not rise much above 0 V because, 
as soon as it reaches +0.7 V (sufficient to cause 
base current to flow), TR1 will begin to conduct. 
As TR1 begins to turn on, its collector voltage will 
rapidly fall from +VCC to 0 V. This fall in voltage 
is transferred to the base of TR2 via C1 and, as 
a consequence, TR2 will turn off. C1 will then 
charge via R3 and TR2’s base voltage will rise 
exponentially from −VCC towards +VCC. As before, 
TR2’s base voltage will not rise much above 0 V 
because, as soon as it reaches +0.7 V (sufficient 
to cause base current to flow), TR2 will start to 
conduct. The cycle is then repeated indefinitely.
The time for which the collector voltage of TR2 
is low and TR1 is high (T1) will be determined by 
the time constant, R4 × C1. Similarly, the time 
for which the collector voltage of TR1 is low and

make a very simple square wave source with 
a frequency that can be made adjustable by 
replacing  R with a variable or preset resistor.
Assume that C is initially uncharged and the 
voltage at the inverting input is slightly less than 
the voltage at the non-inverting input. The output 
voltage will rise rapidly to +VCC and the voltage at 
the inverting input will begin to rise exponentially 
as capacitor C charges through R. 
Eventually the voltage at the inverting input will 
have reached a value that causes the voltage 
at the inverting input to exceed that present at 
the non-inverting input. At this point, the output 
voltage will rapidly fall to −VCC. Capacitor C will 
then start to charge in the other direction and 
the voltage at the inverting input will begin to fall 
exponentially. 
Eventually, the voltage at the inverting input will 
have reached a value that causes the voltage at 
the inverting input to be less than that present at 
the non-inverting input. At this point, the output 
voltage will rise rapidly to +VCC once again and the 
cycle will continue indefinitely.

Assume that the output from IC2 is initially at,

voltage at the output of IC2 will be passed, via R, 
to IC1. Capacitor, C, will start to charge and the 
output voltage of IC1 will begin to fall.
Eventually, the output voltage will have fallen to a 
value that causes the polarity of the voltage at the 
non-inverting input of IC2 to change from positive 
to negative. At this point, the output of IC2 will 
rapidly fall to −VCC. Again, this voltage will be 
passed, via R, to IC1. Capacitor C will then start 
to charge in the other direction and the output 
voltage of IC1 will begin to rise.
Some time later, the output voltage will have 
risen to a value that causes the polarity of the 
non-inverting input of IC2 to revert to its original

Single-stage astable oscillator
A simple form of astable oscillator that produces

circuit employs positive feedback with the output 
fed back to the non-inverting input via the potential

operation from 20 MHz to well over 100 MHz. 
Fig. 9.12 shows a simple crystal oscillator circuit 
in which the crystal provides feedback from the

Practical oscillator circuits
Fig. 9.13 shows a practical sine wave oscillator 
based on a three-stage C–R ladder network. The 
circuit provides an output of approximately 1 V 
peak–peak at 1.97 kHz.
A practical Wien bridge oscillator is shown in 
Fig. 9.14. This circuit produces a sine wave output 
at 16 Hz. The output frequency can easily be 
varied by making R1 and R2 a 10 kΩ dual-gang 
potentiometer and connecting a fixed resistor of 
680 Ω in series with each. In order to adjust the 
loop gain for an optimum sine wave output it may 
be necessary to make R3/R4 adjustable. One way 
of doing this is to replace both components with 
a 10 kΩ multi-turn potentiometer with the sliding 
contact taken to the inverting input of IC1.

Crystal controlled oscillators
A requirement of some oscillators is that they 
accurately maintain an exact frequency of 
oscillation. In such cases, a quartz crystal can 
be used as the frequency determining element. 
The quartz crystal (a thin slice of quartz in a 
hermetically sealed enclosure, see Fig. 9.11) 
vibrates whenever a potential difference is applied 
across its faces (this phenomenon is known 
as the piezoelectric effect). The frequency of 
oscillation is determined by the crystal’s ‘cut’ and 
physical size. 
Most quartz crystals can be expected to 
stabilize the frequency of oscillation of a circuit 
to within a few parts in a million. Crystals can 
be manufactured for operation in fundamental 
mode over a frequency range extending from

MHz to about 12 MHz).

Logic circuits
Chapter summary
This chapter introduces electronic circuits and devices that are associated 
with digital rather than analogue circuitry. These logic circuits are used 
extensively in digital systems and form the basis of clocks, counters, shift 
registers and timers. 
The chapter starts by introducing the basic logic functions (AND, OR, 
NAND, NOR, etc.) together with the symbols and truth tables that describe 
the operation of the most common logic gates. We then show how these 
gates can be used in simple combinational logic circuits before moving 
on to introduce bistable devices, counters and shift registers. The chapter 
concludes with a brief introduction to the two principal technologies used 
in modern digital logic circuits, TTL and CMOS.

We can now rewrite the truth table in terms of

AND logic
Now consider the circuit with two switches 
shown in Fig. 10.3. Here, the lamp will only 
operate when switch A is closed and switch B is 
closed. However, let’s look at the operation of the 
circuit in a little more detail. 
Since there are two switches (A and B) and there 
are two possible states for each switch (open or 
closed), there is a total of four possible conditions 
for the circuit. We summarize these conditions in 
Table 10.2.
Since each switch can only be in one of the two 
states (i.e. open or closed) at any given time, 
the open and closed conditions are mutually 
exclusive. Furthermore, since the switches cannot 
exist in any other state than completely open or 
completely closed (i.e. there are no intermediate 
states) the circuit uses binary logic. We can thus 
represent the logical states of the two switches 
by the binary digits, 0 and 1.
Once again, if we adopt the convention that 
an open switch can be represented by 0 and a 
closed switch by 1, we can rewrite the truth table 
Logic functions
Electronic logic circuits can be used to make 
simple decisions like:
If dark then put on the light.
and
If temperature is less then 20 °C then connect 
the supply to the heater.
They can also be used to make more complex 
decisions like:
If ‘hour’ is greater than 11 and ‘24 hour clock’ 
is not selected then display message ‘pm’.
All of these logical statements are similar in form. 
The first two are essentially:
If {condition} then {action}.
while the third is a compound statement of the 
form:
If {condition 1} and not {condition 2} then 
{action}.
Both of these statements can be readily 
implemented using straightforward electronic 
circuits. Because this circuitry is based on discrete 
states and since the behaviour of the circuits can 
be described by a set of logical statements, it is 
referred to as digital logic.
Switch and lamp logic
In the simple circuit shown in Fig. 10.1 a battery 
is connected to a lamp via a switch. There are two 
possible states for the switch, open and closed, 
but the lamp will only operate when the switch is 
closed. We can summarize this using Table 10.1. 
Since the switch can only be in one of the two 
states (i.e. open or closed) at any given time, 
the open and closed conditions are mutually 
exclusive. Furthermore, since the switch cannot 
exist in any other state than completely open or 
completely closed (i.e. there is no intermediate 
or half-open state) the circuit uses binary or ‘two-
state’ logic. The logical state of the switch can 
be represented by the binary digits, 0 and 1. For 
example, if logical 0 is synonymous with open (or 
‘off’) and logical 1 is equivalent to closed (or ‘on’), 
then:

OR logic
Fig. 10.5 shows another circuit with two 
switches. This circuit differs from that shown 
in Fig. 10.3 by virtue of the fact that the two 
switches are connected in parallel rather than in 
series. In this case the lamp will operate when 
either of the two switches is closed. As before, 
there is a total of four possible conditions for the 
circuit. We summarize these conditions in Table 
10.3.
Once again, adopting the convention that an open 
switch can be represented by 0 and a closed 
switch by 1, we can rewrite the truth table in 
terms of the binary states as shown in Fig. 10.6.

AND gates (Fig. 10.11)
AND gates will only produce a logic 1 output 
when all inputs are simultaneously at logic 1. Any 
other input combination results in a logic 0 output. 
The Boolean expression for the output, Y, of an 
AND gate with inputs, A and B, is:
Y = A ∙ B
OR gates (Fig. 10.12)
OR gates will produce a logic 1 output whenever 
any one, or more, inputs are at logic 1. Putting 
this another way, an OR gate will only produce 
a logic 0 output whenever all of its inputs are 
simultaneously at logic 0. The Boolean expression 
for the output, Y, of an OR gate with inputs A and 
B is: 
Y = A + B
Solution
In order to operate the lamp, switch A and either 
switch B or switch C must be operated. The truth 
table is shown in Fig. 10.8.
Logic gates
Logic gates are circuits designed to produce the 
basic logic functions, AND, OR, etc. These circuits 
are designed to be interconnected into larger, 
more complex, logic circuit arrangements. Since 
these circuits form the basic building blocks of all 
digital systems, we have summarized the action 
of each of the gates in the next section. For each 
gate we have included its British Standard (BS) 
symbol together with its American Standard (MIL/
ANSI) symbol. We have also included the truth 
tables and Boolean expressions (using ‘ + ’ to 
denote OR, ‘·’ to denote AND, and ‘−’ to denote 
NOT). Note that, while inverters and buffers each 
have only one input, exclusive-OR gates have two 
inputs and the other basic gates (AND, OR, NAND 
and NOR) are commonly available with up to eight 
inputs.
Buffers (Fig. 10.9)
Buffers do not affect the logical state of a digital 
signal (i.e. a logic 1 input results in a logic 1 output 
whereas a logic 0 input results in a logic 0 output). 
Buffers are normally used to provide extra current 
drive at the output but can also be used to 
regularize the logic levels present at an interface. 
The Boolean expression for the output, Y, of a 
buffer with an input, X, is:
Y = X
Inverters (Fig. 10.10) 
Inverters are used to complement the logical 
state (i.e. a logic 1 input results in a logic 0 
output and vice versa). Inverters also provide 
extra current drive and, like buffers, are used 
in interfacing applications where they provide a 
means of regularizing logic levels present at the 
input or output of a digital system. The Boolean 
expression for the output, Y, of a buffer with an 
input, X, is:
Y = X

Combinational logic
By using a standard range of logic levels (i.e. 
voltage levels used to represent the logic 1 and 
logic 0 states) logic circuits can be combined in 
order to solve complex logic functions.
Example 10.2
A logic circuit is to be constructed that will 
produce a logic 1 output whenever two or more 
of its three inputs are at logic 1.
Solution
This circuit could be more aptly referred to as a 
majority vote circuit. Its truth table is shown in 
Fig. 10.16. Fig. 10.17 shows the logic circuitry 
required.
Example 10.3
Show how an arrangement of basic logic gates 
(AND, OR and NOT) can be used to produce the 
exclusive-OR function.
NAND gates (Fig. 10.13)
NAND (i.e. NOT-AND) gates will only produce a 
logic 0 output when all inputs are simultaneously 
at logic 1. Any other input combination will 
produce a logic 1 output. A NAND gate, therefore, 
is nothing more than an AND gate with its output 
inverted! The circle shown at the output denotes 
this inversion. The Boolean expression for the 
output, Y, of a NAND gate with inputs A and B is:
Y = A ∙ B
NOR gates (Fig. 10.14)
NOR (i.e. NOT-OR) gates will only produce a logic 
1 output when all inputs are simultaneously at 
logic 0. Any other input combination will produce 
a logic 0 output. A NOR gate, therefore, is simply 
an OR gate with its output inverted. A circle is 
again used to indicate inversion. The Boolean 
expression for the output, Y, of a NOR gate with 
inputs, A and B, is:
Y = A + B
Exclusive-OR gates (Fig. 10.15)
Exclusive-OR gates will produce a logic 1 output 
whenever either one of the inputs is at logic 1 and 
the other is at logic 0. Exclusive-OR gates produce 
a logic 0 output whenever both inputs have the 
same logical state (i.e. when both are at logic 0 or 
both are at logic 1). The Boolean expression for 
the output, Y, of an exclusive-OR gate with inputs 
A and B is:
Y = A ∙ B + B ∙ A

is applied to it in order to change its state (or until 
the supply is disconnected).
R-S bistables
The simplest form of bistable is the R-S bistable. 
This device has two inputs, SET and RESET, 
and complementary outputs, Q and Q . A logic 1 
applied to the SET input will cause the Q output 
to become (or remain at) logic 1 while a logic 
1 applied to the RESET input will cause the Q 
output to become (or remain at) logic 0. In either 
case, the bistable will remain in its SET or RESET 
state until an input is applied in such a sense as to 
change the state.
Two simple forms of R-S bistable based on cross-
coupled logic gates are shown in Fig. 10.19. 
Fig. 10.19(a) is based on NAND gates while 
Fig. 10.19(b) is based on NOR gates.
Solution
In order to solve this problem, consider the 
Boolean expression for the exclusive-OR function:
Y
A B
B A
=
⋅
+
⋅
This expression takes the form:
Y = P + Q where P = A B
⋅
 and Q = B A
⋅
A B

 and Q = B A
⋅
 can be obtained using 
two two-input AND gates and the result (i.e. P 
and Q) can then be applied to an OR gate with 
two inputs. A  and B  can be produced using 
inverters. The complete solution is shown in 
Fig. 10.18.
Bistables
The output of a bistable has two stable states 
(logic 0 or logic 1) and, once set in one or other 
of these states, the device will remain at a 
particular logic level for an indefinite period until 
reset. A bistable thus constitutes a simple form 
of ‘memory cell’ because it will remain in its 
latched state (whether set or reset) until a signal

J-K bistables
J-K bistables have two clocked inputs (J and K), 
two direct inputs (PRESET and CLEAR), a CLOCK 
(CK) input, and outputs (Q and Q). As with R-S 
bistables, the two outputs are complementary 
(i.e. when one is 0 the other is 1, and vice versa). 
Similarly, the PRESET and CLEAR inputs are 
invariably both active low (i.e. a 0 on the PRESET 
input will set the Q output to 1 whereas a 0 on 
the CLEAR input will set the Q output to 0). 
Tables 10.4 and 10.5 summarize the operation of 
a J-K bistable, respectively, for the PRESET and 
CLEAR inputs and for clocked operation.
The simple cross-coupled logic gate bistable has 
a number of serious shortcomings (consider what 
would happen if a logic 1 was simultaneously 
present on both the SET and RESET inputs!) and 
practical forms of bistable make use of much 
improved purpose-designed logic circuits such as 
D-type and J-K bistables.
D-type bistables
The D-type bistable has two inputs: D (standing 
variously for ‘data’ or ‘delay’) and CLOCK (CLK). 
The data input (logic 0 or logic 1) is clocked 
into the bistable such that the output state only 
changes when the clock changes state. Operation 
is thus said to be synchronous. Additional 
subsidiary inputs (which are invariably active 
low) are provided which can be used to directly 
set or reset the bistable. These are usually 
called PRESET (PR) and CLEAR (CLR). D-type 
bistables are used both as latches (a simple form 
of memory) and as binary dividers. The simple 
circuit arrangement in Fig. 10.20 together with the 
timing diagram shown in Fig. 10.21 illustrate the 
operation of D-type bistables.

J-K bistables are the most sophisticated and 
flexible of the bistable types and they can be 
configured in various ways including binary 
dividers, shift registers and latches. 
Fig. 10.22 shows the arrangement of a four-stage 
binary counter based on J-K bistables. The timing 
diagram for this circuit is shown in Fig. 10.23. 
Each stage successively divides the clock input 
signal by a factor of two. Note that a logic 1 input 
is transferred to the respective Q-output on the 
falling edge of the clock pulse and all J and K 
inputs must be taken to logic 1 to enable binary 
counting. 
Fig. 10.24 shows the arrangement of a four- stage 
shift register based on J-K bistables. The timing 
diagram for this circuit is shown in Fig. 10.25. 
Note that each stage successively feeds data to

The most common family of TTL logic devices is 
known as the 74-series. Devices from this family 
are coded with the prefix number 74. Variants 
within the family are identified by letters which 
follow the initial 74 prefix, as shown in Table 10.7.
The most common family of CMOS devices is 
known as the 4000-series. Variants within the 
family are identified by the suffix letters given in 
Table 10.8.
Example 10.5
Identify each of the following integrated circuits:
(i) 4001UBE;
(ii) 74LS14.
Solution
Integrated circuit (i) is an improved (unbuffered) 
version of the CMOS 4001 device. Integrated 
circuit (ii) is a low-power Schottky version of the 
TTL 7414 device. 
Date codes
It is also worth noting that the vast majority of 
logic devices and other digital integrated circuits 
are marked with a four-digit date code. The code 
often appears alongside or below the device code. 
The first two digits of this code give the year of 
manufacture while the last two digits specify the 
week of manufacture.

An integrated circuit is marked ‘4050B 9832’. 
What type of device is it and when was it 
manufactured?
Integrated circuit logic devices
The task of realizing a complex logic circuit is 
made simple with the aid of digital integrated 
circuits. Such devices are classified according 
to the semiconductor technology used in their 
fabrication (the logic family to which a device 
belongs is largely instrumental in determining 
its operational characteristics, such as power 
consumption, speed and immunity to noise).
The relative size of a digital integrated circuit 
(in terms of the number of active devices that 
it contains) is often referred to as its scale of 
integration and the terminology in Table 10.6 is 
commonly used.
The two basic logic families are CMOS 
(complementary metal oxide semiconductor) 
and TTL (transistor transistor logic). Each of 
these families is then further sub-divided. 
Representative circuits for a two-input AND gate 
in both technologies are shown in Figs 10.29 and

Logic levels
Logic levels are simply the range of voltages 
used to represent the logic states 0 and 1. The 
logic levels for CMOS differ markedly from those 
associated with TTL. In particular, CMOS logic 
levels are relative to the supply voltage used while 
the logic levels associated with TTL devices tend 
to be absolute (see Table 10.9).
Noise margin
The noise margin of a logic device is a measure 
of its ability to reject noise and spurious signals;

the larger the noise margin the better is its ability 
to perform in an environment in which noise is 
present. Noise margin is defined as the difference 
between the minimum values of high-state output 
and high-state input voltage and the maximum 
values of low-state output and low-state input 
voltage. Hence:

state of the outputs. Replace the RESET link (to 
make RESET = 0) and check that the bistable does 
not change state. Now remove the SET link (to 
make SET = 1). Once again, observe and record 
the state of the outputs. Replace the SET link 
(to make SET = 0) and once again check that the

both links (to make SET = 1 and RESET = 1) 
and observe the state of the outputs in this 
disallowed state. 
Conclusion
Comment on the truth table produced. Is this 
what you would expect? What happened when 
both SET and RESET inputs were at logic 1? 
Suggest a typical application for the circuit. 
Procedure
Connect the circuit shown in Fig. 10.33 (see 
also Fig. 10.34 for the corresponding breadboard 
layout). Note that the green LED should become 
illuminated when the bistable is in the SET 
condition (i.e. when Q is at logic 1) and the red 
LED should become illuminated when the bistable 
is in the RESET condition. Note also that the 
47 kΩ resistors act as pull-up resistors. They are 
used to ensure that the respective input goes to 
logic 1 when the corresponding link is removed. 
With both links in place (i.e. SET = 0 and 
RESET = 0) observe and record (using a truth 
table) the state of the outputs. 
Remove the RESET link (to make RESET = 1) 
while leaving the SET link in place (to keep

CHAPTER11
Microprocessors
Chapter summary
Many of today’s complex electronic systems are based on the use of a 
microprocessor or microcontroller. Such systems comprise hardware 
that is controlled by software. If it is necessary to change the way that 
the system behaves it is the software (rather than the hardware) that is 
changed. 
In this chapter we provide an introduction to microprocessors and explain, 
in simple terms, both how they operate and how they are used. We shall 
start by explaining some of the terminology that is used to describe 
different types of system that involve the use of a microprocessor or a 
similar device.

Microprocessor systems
Microprocessor systems are usually assembled 
on a single PCB comprising a microprocessor 
CPU together with a number of specialized 
support chips. These very large-scale integrated 
(VLSI) devices provide input and output to the 
system, control and timing, as well as storage for 
programs and data. 
Typical applications for microprocessor systems 
include the control of complex industrial 
processes. Typical examples are based on 
families of chips such as the Z80CPU plus 
Z80PIO, Z80CTC, and Z80SIO.
Single-chip microcomputers
A single-chip microcomputer is a complete 
computer system (comprising CPU, RAM and 
ROM, etc.) in a single VLSI package. A single-
chip microcomputer requires very little external 
circuitry in order to provide all of the functions 
associated with a complete computer system (but 
usually with limited input and output capability). 
Single-chip microcomputers may be programmed 
using in-built programmable memories or via 
external memory chips. Typical applications of 
single-chip microcomputers include computer 
printers, instrument controllers, and displays. A 
typical example is the Z84C.
Microcontrollers
A microcontroller is a single-chip microcomputer 
that is designed specifically for control rather than 
general-purpose applications. They are often used 
to satisfy a particular control requirement, such 
as controlling a motor drive. Single-chip micro-
computers, on the other hand, usually perform 
a variety of different functions and may control 
several processes at the same time. 
Typical applications include control of peripheral 
devices such as motors, drives, printers, and 
minor sub-system components. Typical examples 
are the Z86E, 8051, 68705 and 89C51.
PIC microcontrollers
A PIC microcontroller is a general-purpose 
microcontroller device that is normally used in a 
stand-alone application to perform simple logic, 
timing and input/output control. PIC devices 
provide a flexible low-cost solution that very 
effectively bridges the gap between single-chip 
computers and the use of discrete logic and timer 
chips, as explained in Chapter 17.
A number of PIC and microcontroller devices 
have been produced that incorporate a high-level 
language interpreter. The resident interpreter 
allows developers to develop their programs’ 
languages such as BASIC rather than having to 
resort to more complex assembly language. This 
feature makes PIC microcontrollers very easy 
to use. PIC microcontrollers are used in ‘self-
contained’ applications involving logic, timing and 
simple analogue-to-digital and digital-to-analogue 
conversion. Typical examples are the PIC12C508 
and PIC16C620.
Programmed logic devices
While not an example of a microprocessor 
device, a programmed logic device (PLD) is a 
programmable chip that can carry out complex 
logical operations. For completeness, we have 
included a reference to such devices here. 
PLDs are capable of replacing a large number of 
conventional logic gates, thus minimizing chip-
count and reducing PCB sizes. Programming is 
relatively straightforward and simply requires 
the derivation of complex logic functions using 
Boolean algebra (see Chapter 10) or truth tables. 
Typical examples are the 16L8 and 22V10.
Programmable logic controllers
Programmable logic controllers (PLCs) are 
microprocessor-based systems that are used for 
controlling a wide variety of automatic processes, 
from operating an airport baggage handling 
system to brewing a pint of your favourite lager. 
PLCs are rugged and modular and they are 
designed specifically for operation in the process 
control environment. 

11 Microprocessors
205
The control program for a PLC is usually stored 
in one or more semiconductor memory devices. 
The program can be entered (or modified) by 
means of a simple hand-held programmer, a 
laptop controller, or downloaded over a local area 
network (LAN). PLC manufacturers include Allen 
Bradley, Siemens and Mitsubishi. 
Microprocessor systems
The basic components of any microprocessor 
system (see Fig. 11.1) are:
(a) a central processing unit (CPU);
(b) a memory, comprising both ‘read/write’ and 
‘read only’ devices (commonly called RAM and 
ROM, respectively);
(c) a means of providing input and output (I/O). 
For example, a keypad for input and a display 
for output.
In a microprocessor system the functions of the 
CPU are provided by a single VLSI microprocessor 
chip (see Fig. 11.2). This chip is equivalent 
to many thousands of individual transistors. 
Semiconductor devices are also used to provide 
the read/write and read-only memory. Strictly 
speaking, both types of memory permit ‘random 
access’ since any item of data can be retrieved 
with equal ease regardless of its actual location 
within the memory. Despite this, the term ‘RAM’ 
has become synonymous with semiconductor 
read/write memory.
The basic components of the system (CPU, 
RAM, ROM and I/O) are linked together using a 
multiple-wire connecting system know as a bus 
(see Fig. 11.1). Three different buses are present; 
these are:
(a) the address bus used to specify memory 
locations;
(b) the data bus on which data are transferred 
between devices; and
(c) the control bus which provides timing and 
control signals throughout the system.
The number of individual lines present within 
the address bus and data bus depends upon 
the particular microprocessor employed. Signals 
on all lines, no matter whether they are used 
for address, data or control, can exist in only 
two basic states: logic 0 (low) or logic 1 (high). 
Data and addresses are represented by binary 
numbers (a sequence of 1s and 0s) that appear 
respectively on the data and address bus.

a $ symbol before a hexadecimal number or add 
an H to the end of the number. For example, 64 
means decimal ‘sixty-four’; whereas $64 means 
hexadecimal ‘six-four’, which is equivalent to 
decimal 100. Similarly, 7FH means hexadecimal 
‘seven-F’, which is equivalent to decimal 127.
Example 11.1
Convert hexadecimal A3 into binary.
Solution
From Table 11.1, A = 1010 and 3 = 0011. Thus 
A3 in hexadecimal is equivalent to 10100011 in 
binary.
Example 11.2
Convert binary 11101000 binary to hexadecimal.
Solution
From Table 11.1, 1110 = E and 1000 = 8. Thus 
11101000 in binary is equivalent to E8 in 
hexadecimal.
Many microprocessors designed for control and 
instrumentation applications make use of an 8-bit 
data bus and a 16-bit address bus. Others have 
data and address buses which can operate with 
as many as 128-bits at a time.
The largest binary number that can appear on an 
8-bit data bus corresponds to the condition when 
all eight lines are at logic 1. Therefore the largest 
value of data that can be present on the bus at 
any instant of time is equivalent to the binary 
number 11111111 (or 255). Similarly, the highest 
address that can appear on a 16-bit address 
bus is 1111111111111111 (or 65,535). The full 
range of data values and addresses for a simple 
microprocessor of this type is thus:
Data

to	
11111111
Addresses	 from	 0000000000000000
	
to	
1111111111111111
Data representation
Binary numbers – particularly large ones – are 
not very convenient. To make numbers easier 
to handle we often convert binary numbers to 
hexadecimal (base 16). This format is easier 
for mere humans to comprehend and offers the 
advantage over denary (base 10) in that it can be 
converted to and from binary with ease. The first 
16 numbers in binary, denary and hexadecimal 
are shown in Table 11.1. A single hexadecimal 
character (in the range zero to F) is used to 
represent a group of four binary digits (bits). This 
group of four bits (or single hex character) is 
sometimes called a nibble.
A byte of data comprises a group of eight bits. 
Thus a byte can be represented by just two 
hexadecimal (hex) characters. A group of 16 
bits (a word) can be represented by four hex 
characters, 32 bits (a double word by eight hex 
characters, and so on).
The value of a byte expressed in binary can be 
easily converted to hex by arranging the bits in 
groups of four and converting each nibble into 
hexadecimal using Table 11.1.
Note that, to avoid confusion about whether a 
number is hexadecimal or decimal, we often place

alive by means of a small battery. This battery-
backed memory is used to retain important data, 
such as the time and date.
When expressing the amount of storage provided 
by a memory device we usually use Kilobytes 
(Kbyte). It is important to note that a Kilobyte of 
memory is actually 1,024 bytes (not 1,000 bytes). 
The reason for choosing the Kbyte rather than the 
kbyte (1,000 bytes) is that 1,024 happens to be 
the nearest power of 2 (note that 210 = 1,024).
The capacity of a semiconductor ROM is usually 
specified in terms of an address range and 
the number of bits stored at each address. 
For example, 2 K × 8 bits (capacity 2 Kbytes), 
4 K × 8 bits (capacity 4 Kbytes), and so on. Note 
that it is not always necessary (or desirable) for 
the entire memory space of a microprocessor to 
be populated by memory devices. 
The microprocessor
The microprocessor central processing unit 
(CPU) forms the heart of any microprocessor 
or microcomputer system computer and, 
consequently, its operation is crucial to the entire 
system. 
The primary function of the microprocessor is that 
of fetching, decoding and executing instructions 
resident in memory. As such, it must be able to 
transfer data from external memory into its own 
internal registers and vice versa. Furthermore, 
it must operate predictably, distinguishing, for 
example, between an operation contained within 
an instruction and any accompanying addresses 
of read/write memory locations. In addition, 
various system housekeeping tasks need to be 
performed including being able to suspend normal 
processing in order to respond to an external 
device that needs attention.
The main parts of a microprocessor CPU are:
(a)	registers for temporary storage of addresses 
and data;
(b)	an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) that performs 
arithmetic and logic operations; 
(c)	a unit that receives and decodes instructions; 
and
(d)	a means of controlling and timing operations 
within the system.
Data types
A byte of data can be stored at each 
address within the total memory space of a 
microprocessor system. Hence one byte can be 
stored at each of the 65,536 memory locations 
within a microprocessor system having a 16-bit 
address bus. 
Individual bits within a byte are numbered from 0 
(least significant bit) to 7 (most significant bit). In 
the case of 16-bit words, the bits are numbered 
from 0 (least significant bit) to 15 (most significant 
bit). 
Negative (or signed) numbers can be represented 
using two’s complement notation where the 
leading (most significant) bit indicates the sign 
of the number (1 = negative, 0 = positive). For 
example, the signed 8-bit number 10000001 
represents the denary number −1.
The range of integer data values that can be 
represented as bytes, words and long words are 
shown in Table 11.2.
Data storage
The semiconductor ROM within a microprocessor 
system provides storage for the program code as 
well as any permanent data that requires storage. 
All of these data are referred to as non-volatile 
because they remain intact when the power 
supply is disconnected.
The semiconductor RAM within a microprocessor 
system provides storage for the transient data 
and variables that are used by programs. Part of 
the RAM is also used by the microprocessor as 
a temporary store for data while carrying out its 
normal processing tasks.
It is important to note that any program or data 
stored in RAM will be lost when the power 
supply is switched off or disconnected. The only 
exception to this is CMOS RAM, which is kept

the microprocessor, one at time, through the data 
bus. 
On the first part of each machine cycle, 
the instruction is fetched and decoded. The 
instruction is executed on the second (and 
subsequent) machine cycles. Each machine 
cycle takes a finite time (usually less than a 
microsecond) depending upon the frequency of 
the microprocessor’s clock.
Data bus (D0 to D7)
The external data bus provides a highway for data 
that links all of the system components (such as 
random access memory, read-only memory and 
input/output devices) together. In an 8-bit system, 
the data bus has eight data lines, labelled D0 (the 
least significant bit) to D7 (the most significant 
bit) and data are moved around in groups of eight 
bits, or bytes. With a 16-bit data bus the data 
lines are labelled D0 to D15, and so on.
Fig. 11.3 shows the principal internal features 
of a typical 8-bit microprocessor. We will briefly 
explain each of these features in turn.
Accumulator
The accumulator functions as a source and 
destination register for many of the basic 
microprocessor operations. As a source register 
it contains the data that will be used in a particular 
operation, while as a destination register it will 
be used to hold the result of a particular operation. 
The accumulator (or A-register) features in a 
very large number of microprocessor operations, 
consequently more reference is made to this 
register than any others.
Instruction register
The instruction register provides a temporary 
storage location in which the current 
microprocessor instruction is held while it is being 
decoded. Program instructions are passed into 
Figure 11.3  Internal architecture of a typical 8-bit microprocessor CPU

11  Microprocessors
209
Program counter
Programs consist of a sequence of instructions 
that are executed by the microprocessor. These 
instructions are stored in external random access 
memory (RAM) or read-only memory (ROM). 
Instructions must be fetched and executed 
by the microprocessor in a strict sequence. 
By storing the address of the next instruction 
to be executed, the program counter allows 
the microprocessor to keep track of where it 
is within the program. The program counter is 
automatically incremented when each instruction 
is executed.
Address bus buffer
The address bus buffer is a temporary 
register through which addresses (in this case 
comprising 16 bits) pass on their way out of the 
microprocessor. In a simple microprocessor, the 
address buffer is unidirectional with addresses 
placed on the address bus during both read 
and write operations. The address bus lines 
are labelled A0 to A15, where A0 is the least 
significant address bus line and A15 is the most 
significant address bus line. Note that a 16-bit 
address bus can be used to communicate with 
65,536 individual memory locations. At each 
location a single byte of data is stored.
Control bus
The control bus is a collection of signal lines 
that are both used to control the transfer of data 
around the system and also to interact with 
external devices. The control signals used by 
microprocessors tend to differ with different 
types: however the following are commonly 
found:
READ	
an output signal from the microprocessor 	
that indicates that the current operation is 	
a read operation.
WRITE	 an output signal from the microprocessor 
that indicates that the current operation is 
a write operation.
RESET	 a signal that resets the internal registers 
and initializes the program counter so 
that the program can be re-started from 
the beginning.
Data bus buffer
The data bus buffer is a temporary register 
through which bytes of data pass on their way 
into, and out of, the microprocessor. The buffer 
is thus referred to as bi-directional with data 
passing out of the microprocessor on a write 
operation and into the processor during a read 
operation. The direction of data transfer is 
determined by the control unit as it responds to 
each individual program instruction.
Internal data bus
The internal data bus is a high-speed data highway 
that links all of the microprocessor’s internal 
elements together. Data are constantly flowing 
backwards and forwards along the internal data 
bus lines.
General-purpose registers
Many microprocessor operations (for example, 
adding two 8-bit numbers together) require the 
use of more than one register. There is also a 
requirement for temporarily storing the partial 
result of an operation while other operations 
take place. Both of these needs can be met by 
providing a number of general-purpose registers. 
The use to which these registers are put is left 
mainly up to the programmer.
Stack pointer
When the time comes to suspend a particular 
task in order to briefly attend to something else, 
most microprocessors make use of a region of 
external random access memory (RAM) known as 
a stack. When the main program is interrupted, 
the microprocessor temporarily places in the stack 
the contents of its internal registers together 
with the address of the next instruction in the 
main program. When the interrupt has been 
attended to, the microprocessor recovers the data 
that have been stored temporarily in the stack 
together with the address of the next instruction 
within the main program. It is thus able to return 
to the main program exactly where it left off and 
with all the data preserved in its registers. The 
stack pointer is simply a register that contains the 
address of the last used stack location.

11  Microprocessors
210
shift left, shift right, etc. The result of most ALU 
operations appears in the accumulator.
Flag register (or status register)
The result of an ALU operation is sometimes 
important in determining what subsequent action 
takes place. The flag register contains a number 
of individual bits that are set or reset according 
to the outcome of an ALU operation. These bits 
are referred to as flags. The following flags are 
available in most microprocessors:
ZERO	
the zero flag is set when the result 
of an ALU operation is zero (i.e. a 
byte value of 00000000).
CARRY	
the carry flag is set whenever the 
result of an ALU operation (such 
as addition) generates a carry bit 
(in other words, when the result 
cannot be contained within an 8-bit 
register).
INTERRUPT	 the interrupt flag indicates whether 
external interrupts are currently 
enabled or disabled.
Clocks
The clock used in a microprocessor system 
is simply an accurate and stable square wave 
generator. In most cases the frequency of the 
square wave generator is determined by a quartz 
crystal. A simple 4 MHz square wave clock 
oscillator (together with the clock waveform that 
is produced) is shown in Fig. 11.4. Note that one 
complete clock cycle is sometimes referred to as 
a T-state.
Microprocessors sometimes have an internal 
clock circuit, in which case the quartz crystal (or 
other resonant device) is connected directly to 
pins on the microprocessor chip. In Fig. 11.5(a) 
an external clock is shown connected to a 
microprocessor, while in Fig.11.5(b) an internal 
clock oscillator is used.
Microprocessor operation
The majority of operations performed by a 
microprocessor involve the movement of 
data. Indeed, the program code (a set of 
instructions stored in ROM or RAM) must itself 
IRQ	
interrupt request from an external device 
attempting to gain the attention of the 
microprocessor (the request may be 
obeyed or ignored according to the state 
of the microprocessor at the time that 
the interrupt request is received).
NMI	
non-maskable interrupt (i.e. an interrupt 
signal that cannot be ignored by the 
microprocessor).
Address bus (A0 to A15)
The address bus provides a highway for 
addresses that links with all of the system 
components (such as random access memory, 
read-only memory and input/output devices). 
In a system with a 16-bit address bus, there are 
16 address lines, labelled A0 (the least significant 
bit) to A15 (the most significant bit). In a system 
with a 32-bit address bus there are 32 address 
lines, labelled A0 to A31, and so on.
Instruction decoder
The instruction decoder is nothing more than an 
arrangement of logic gates that acts on the bits 
stored in the instruction register and determines 
which instruction is currently being referenced. 
The instruction decoder provides output signals 
for the microprocessor’s control unit.
Control unit
The control unit is responsible for organizing the 
orderly flow of data within the microprocessor 
as well as generating, and responding to, signals 
on the control bus. The control unit is also 
responsible for the timing of all data transfers. 
This process is synchronized using an internal or 
external clock signal (not shown in Fig. 11.3).
Arithmetic logic unit (ALU)
As its name suggests, the ALU performs 
arithmetic and logic operations. The ALU has 
two inputs (in this case these are both 8 bits 
wide). One of these inputs is derived from the 
accumulator while the other is taken from the 
internal data bus via a temporary register (not 
shown in Fig. 11.3). The operations provided by 
the ALU usually include addition, subtraction, 
logical AND, logical OR, logical exclusive-OR,

microprocessor to a memory location involves a 
write operation – see Fig. 11.6.
Each cycle of CPU operation is known as a 
machine cycle. Program instructions may require 
several machine cycles (typically between two 
and five). The first machine cycle in any cycle 
consists of an instruction fetch (the instruction 
code is read from the memory) and it is known as 
the M1 cycle. Subsequent cycles M2, M3 and so 
on depend on the type of instruction that is being 
executed. This fetch–execute sequence is shown 
in Fig. 11.7.
Microprocessors determine the source of data 
(when it is being read) and the destination of data 
(when it is being written) by placing a unique 
address on the address bus. The address at which 
the data are to be placed (during a write operation) 
or from which they are to be fetched (during a 
read operation) can either constitute part of the 
memory of the system (in which case it may be 
within ROM or RAM) or it can be considered to be 
associated with input/output (I/O).
Since the data bus is connected to a number of 
VLSI devices, an essential requirement of such 
chips (e.g. ROM or RAM) is that their data outputs 
should be capable of being isolated from the bus 
be fetched from memory prior to execution. 
The microprocessor thus performs a continuous 
sequence of instruction fetch and execute cycles. 
The act of fetching an instruction code (or operand 
or data value) from memory involves a read 
operation while the act of moving data from the

of as a simple pigeon-hole arrangement that can 
store as many bits as there are holes available. 
Generally, these devices can store groups of 16 
or 32 bits. Additionally, some registers may be 
configured as either one register of 16 bits or two 
registers of 32 bits.
Some microprocessor registers are accessible to 
the programmer, whereas others are used by the 
microprocessor itself. Registers may be classified 
as either general purpose or dedicated. In the 
latter case a particular function is associated 
with the register, such as holding the result of an 
operation or signalling the result of a comparison. 
A typical microprocessor and its register model is 
shown in Fig. 11.8.
whenever necessary. These chips are fitted with 
select or enable inputs that are driven by address 
decoding logic (not shown in Fig. 11.7). This logic 
ensures that ROM, RAM and I/O devices never 
simultaneously attempt to place data on the bus!
The inputs of the address decoding logic are 
derived from one, or more, of the address bus 
lines. The address decoder effectively divides the 
available memory into blocks corresponding to a 
particular function (ROM, RAM, I/O, etc). Hence, 
where the processor is reading and writing to 
RAM, for example, the address decoding logic will 
ensure that only the RAM is selected while the 
ROM and I/O remain isolated from the data bus.
Within the CPU, data are stored in several 
registers. Registers themselves can be thought

shift register. Here data are loaded in serial form, 
each bit shifting further into the register until it 
becomes full. Data are then placed simultaneously 
on the parallel output lines. The basic principles 
of parallel-to-serial and serial-to-parallel data 
conversion are illustrated in Fig. 11.9.
An example program
The following example program (see Table 11.3) 
is written in assembly code. The program 
transfers 8-bit data from an input port (Port A), 
complements (i.e. inverts) the data (by changing 
0s to 1s and 1s to 0s in every bit position) and 
then outputs the result to an output port (Port B). 
The program repeats indefinitely.
Just three microprocessor instructions are 
required to carry out this task together with a 
fourth (jump) instruction that causes the three 
instructions to be repeated over and over again. 
A program of this sort is most easily written in 
assembly code which consists of a series of easy 
The arithmetic logic unit
The ALU can perform arithmetic operations 
(addition and subtraction) and logic 
(complementation, logical AND, logical OR, etc). 
The ALU operates on two inputs (16 or 32 bits 
in length depending upon the CPU type) and it 
provides one output (again of 16 or 32 bits). In 
addition, the ALU status is preserved in the flag 
register so that, for example, an overflow, zero or 
negative result can be detected.
The control unit is responsible for the movement 
of data within the CPU and the management 
of control signals, both internal and external. 
The control unit asserts the requisite signals to 
read or write data as appropriate to the current 
instruction.
Input and output
The transfer of data within a microprocessor 
system involves moving groups of 8, 16 or 32 bits 
using the bus architecture described earlier. 
Consequently it is a relatively simple matter to 
transfer data into and out of the system in parallel 
form. This process is further simplified by using 
a Programmable Parallel I/O device (a Z80PIO, 
8255 or equivalent VLSI chip). This device 
provides registers for the temporary storage of 
data that not only buffer the data but also provide 
a degree of electrical isolation from the system 
data bus.
Parallel data transfer is primarily suited to 
high-speed operation over relatively short 
distances, a typical example being the linking of 
a microcomputer to an adjacent printer. There 
are, however, some applications in which parallel 
data transfer is inappropriate, the most common 
example being data communication by means 
of telephone lines. In such cases data must be 
sent serially (one bit after another) rather than in 
parallel form.
To transmit data in serial form, the parallel data 
from the microprocessor must be reorganized into 
a stream of bits. This task is greatly simplified by 
using an LSI interface device that contains a shift 
register that is loaded with parallel data from the 
data bus. This data are then read out as a serial 
bit stream by successive shifting. The reverse 
process, serial-to-parallel conversion, also uses a

immediately to the interrupt. In the case of a 
maskable interrupt, the processor’s response 
will depend upon whether interrupts are currently 
enabled or disabled (when enabled, the CPU 
will suspend its current task and carry out the 
requisite interrupt service routine). 
The response to interrupts can be enabled 
or disabled by means of appropriate program 
instructions. In practice, interrupt signals may be 
generated from a number of sources and since 
each will require its own customized response a 
mechanism must be provided for identifying the 
source of the interrupt and calling the appropriate 
interrupt service routine. In order to assist in this 
task, the microprocessor may use a dedicated 
programmable interrupt controller chip.
A microcontroller system
Fig. 11.11 shows the arrangement of a typical 
microcontroller system. The sensed quantities 
(temperature, position, etc.) are converted to 
corresponding electrical signals by means of 
a number of sensors. The outputs from the 
sensors (in either digital or analogue form) are 
passed as input signals to the microcontroller. 
The microcontroller also accepts inputs from the 
user. These user-set options typically include 
target values for variables (such as desired room 
temperature), limit values (such as maximum 
shaft speed) or time constraints (such as ‘on’ time 
and ‘off’ time, delay time, etc.).
The operation of the microcontroller is controlled 
by a sequence of software instructions known as 
a control program. The control program operates 
continuously, examining inputs from sensors, user 
settings and time data before making changes to 
the output signals sent to one or more controlled 
devices.
The controlled quantities are produced by the 
controlled devices in response to output signals 
from the microcontroller. The controlled device 
generally converts energy from one form into 
energy in another form. For example, the 
controlled device might be an electrical heater 
that converts electrical energy from the AC mains 
supply into heat energy, thus producing a given 
temperature (the controlled quantity).
to remember mnemonics. The flowchart for the 
program is shown in Fig. 11.10(a).
The program occupies a total of eight bytes of 
memory, starting at a hexadecimal address of 
2000 as shown in Fig. 11.10(b). You should also 
note that the two ports, A and B, each have 
unique addresses; Port A is at hexadecimal 
address FF and Port B is at hexadecimal 
address FE.
Interrupts
A program that simply executes a loop indefinitely 
has a rather limited practical application. In most 
microprocessor systems we want to be able to 
interrupt the normal sequence of program flow 
in order to alert the microprocessor to the need 
to do something. We can do this with a signal 
known as an interrupt. There are two types of 
interrupt; maskable and non-maskable.
When a non-maskable interrupt input 
is asserted, the processor must suspend 
execution of the current instruction and respond

The output port signals can be connected to a 
number of devices, including:
X
X LED indicators (both individual and multiple bar 
types);
X
X LED seven-segment displays (via a suitable 
interface);
X
X motors and actuators (both linear and 
rotary types) via a suitable buffer/driver or a 
dedicated interface;
X
X relays (both conventional electromagnetic 
types and optically couple solid-state types);
X

switching devices.
Input devices
Input devices supply information to the computer 
system from the outside world. In an ordinary 
personal computer, the most obvious input device 
is the keyboard. Other input devices available on 
a PC are the mouse (pointing device), scanner, 
and modem. Microcontrollers use much simpler 
input devices. These need be nothing more 
than individual switches or contacts that make 
and break, but many other types of device are 
also used including many types of sensor that 
provide logic-level outputs (such as float switches, 
proximity detectors, light sensors, etc.).
In most real-world systems there is a requirement 
for the system to be automatic or self-regulating. 
Once set, such systems will continue to operate 
without continuous operator intervention. The 
output of a self-regulating system is fed back 
to its input in order to produce what is known 
as a closed-loop system. A good example of a 
closed-loop system is a heating control system 
that is designed to maintain a constant room 
temperature and humidity within a building 
regardless of changes in the outside conditions.
In simple terms, a microcontroller must produce 
a specific state on each of the lines connected 
to its output ports in response to a particular 
combination of states present on each of the 
lines connected to its input ports (see Fig. 11.11). 
Microcontrollers must also have a central 
processing unit (CPU) capable of performing 
simple arithmetic, logical and timing operations.
The input port signals can be derived from a 
number of sources, including:
X
X switches (including momentary action 
push-buttons);
X
X sensors (producing logic-level compatible 
outputs);
X
X keypads (both encoded and unencoded types).

microcontroller systems often use much simpler 
output devices. These may be nothing more than 
LEDs, piezoelectric sounders, relays and motors. 
In order to be connected directly to the output 
port of a microcontroller, an output device must, 
once again, be able to accept a logic compatible 
signal.
Where analogue quantities (rather than simple 
digital on/off operation) are required at the 
output a digital-to-analogue converter (DAC) will 
be needed. All of the functions associated with 
a DAC can be provided by a single integrated 
circuit. As with an ADC, the output resolution of a 
DAC depends on the number of bits and 8, 10 and 
12 bits are common in control applications. 
Interface circuits
Finally, where input and output signals are not 
logic compatible (i.e. when they are outside the 
range of signals that can be connected directly 
to the microcontroller) some additional interface 
circuitry may be required in order to shift the 
voltage levels or to provide additional current 
drive. Additional circuitry may also be required 
when a load (such as a relay or motor) requires 
more current than is available from a standard 
logic device or output port. For example, a 
common range of interface circuits (solid-state 
relays) is available that will allow a microcontroller 
to be easily interfaced to an a.c. mains-connected 
load. It then becomes possible for a small 
microcontroller (operating from only a 5 V d.c. 
supply) to control a central heating system 
operating from 240 V a.c. mains.
It is important to note that, in order to be 
connected directly to the input port of a 
microcontroller, an input device must provide 
a logic compatible signal. This is because 
microcontroller inputs can only accept digital 
input signals with the same voltage levels as 
the logic power source. The 0 V ground level 
(often referred to as VSS in the case of a CMOS 
microcontroller) and the positive supply (VDD in the 
case of a CMOS microcontroller) is invariably 5 V 
± 5%. A level of approximately 0 V indicates a logic 
0 signal and a voltage approximately equal to the 
positive power supply indicates a logic 1 signal.
Other input devices may sense analogue 
quantities (such as velocity) but use a digital 
code to represent their value as an input to the 
microcontroller system. Some microcontrollers 
provide an internal analogue-to-digital converter 
(ADC) in order to greatly simplify the connection 
of analogue sensors as input devices, but where 
this facility isn’t available it will be necessary to 
use an external ADC which usually takes the form 
of a single integrated circuit. The resolution of the 
ADC will depend upon the number of bits used 
and 8-, 10- and 12-bit devices are common in 
control applications.
Output devices
Output devices are used to communicate 
information or actions from a computer system 
to the outside world. In a personal computer 
system, the most common output device is the 
flat-screen display. Other output devices include 
printers and modems. As with input devices,

Outputs (Port 82H)
Logic 1 = LED ‘off’
Logic 0 = LED ‘on’
Note that in order to illuminate an LED the logic 1 
input must be inverted in order to produce a logic 
0 output. Hence it will be necessary to read the 
byte from port 80H, invert (i.e. complement) it, 
and then output it to port 82H.
The program is to continue to run, detecting 
the state of the input switches and turning the 
appropriate LEDs on, until such a time as all of the 
input switches are set to the ‘off’ position. If this 
situation is detected the program is to halt.

The 555 timer
Chapter summary
The 555 timer is without doubt one of the most versatile integrated circuit 
chips ever produced. Not only is it a neat mixture of analogue and digital 
circuitry, but its applications are virtually limitless in the world of timing 
and digital pulse generation. The device also makes an excellent case study 
for newcomers to electronics because it combines a number of important 
concepts and techniques.

12 The 555 timer
223
Internal features
To begin to understand how timer circuits operate, 
it is worth spending a few moments studying the 
internal circuitry of the 555 timer (see Fig 12.1). 
Essentially, the device comprises two operational 
amplifiers (used as comparators – see page 169) 
together with an R–S bistable element (see 
page 192). In addition, an inverting buffer (see 
page 190) is incorporated so that an appreciable 
current can be delivered to a load. The main 
features of the device are shown in Table 12.1.
Unlike standard TTL logic devices, the 555 timer 
can both source and sink current. It’s worth 
taking a little time to explain what we mean by 
these two terms:
(a)	When sourcing current, the 555’s output 
(pin 3) is in the high state and current will then 
flow out of the output pin into the load and 
down to 0 V, as shown in Fig. 12.2(a). 
(b)	When sinking current, the 555’s output (pin 3) 
is in the low state in which case current will 
flow from the positive supply (+Vcc) through 
the load and into the output (pin 3), as shown 
in Fig. 12.2(b).
Returning to Fig. 12.1, the single transistor 
switch, TR1, is provided as a means of rapidly 
discharging an external timing capacitor. Because 
the series chain of resistors, R1, R2 and R3, all 
have identical values, the supply voltage (VCC) is 
divided equally across the three resistors. Hence 
the voltage at the non-inverting input of IC1 is 
one-third of the supply voltage (VCC) while that 
at the inverting input of IC2 is two-thirds of the 
supply voltage (VCC). Hence if VCC is 9 V, 3 V will 
appear at each resistor and the upper comparator 
will have 6 V applied to its inverting input while 
the lower comparator will have 3 V at its non-
inverting input.
The 555 family
The standard 555 timer is housed in an eight-pin  
dual-in-line (DIL) package and operates from 
supply rail voltages of between 4.5 V and 15 V. 
This, of course, encompasses the normal range 
for TTL devices (5 V ± 5%) and thus the device is 
ideally suited for use with TTL circuitry.
Table 12.1  Internal features of the 555 timer
Feature
Function
A
A potential divider comprising R1, R2 and R3 
connected in series. Since all three resistors 
have the same values the input voltage (VCC) 
will be divided into thirds, i.e. one-third of VCC 
will appear at the junction of R2 and R3 while 
two-thirds of VCC will appear at the junction of 
R1 and R2.
B
Two operational amplifiers connected as 
comparators. The operational amplifiers are 
used to examine the voltages at the threshold 
and trigger inputs and compare these with the 
fixed voltages from the potential divider (two-
thirds and one-third of VCC, respectively).
C
An R–S bistable stage. This stage can be either 
set or reset depending upon the output from 
the comparator stage. An external reset input 
is also provided.
D
An open-collector transistor switch. This stage 
is used to discharge an external capacitor by 
effectively shorting it out whenever the base 
of the transistor is driven positive.
E
An inverting power amplifier. This stage is 
capable of sourcing and sinking enough 
current (well over 100 mA in the case of a 
standard 555 device) to drive a small relay or 
another low-resistance load connected to the 
output.
Several versions of the 555 timer are available, 
including low-power (CMOS) and dual versions, as 
follows.
Low-power (CMOS) 555
This device is a CMOS version of the 555 timer 
that is both pin and function compatible with 
its standard counterpart. By virtue of its CMOS 
technology the device operates over a somewhat 
wider range of supply voltages (2 V to 18 V) and 
consumes minimal operating current (120 mA 
typical for an 18 V supply). Note that, by virtue 
of the low-power CMOS technology employed, 
the device does not have the same output 
current drive as that possessed by its standard 
counterparts. It can, however, supply up to two 
standard TTL loads.
Dual 555 timer (e.g. NE556A)
This is a dual version of the standard 555 timer 
housed in a 14-pin DIL package. The two devices

output is high (b) current sunk by the timer when the output is low
may be used entirely independently and share 
the same electrical characteristics as the standard 
555. 
Low-power (CMOS) dual 555 (e.g. ICM75561PA)
This is a dual version of the low-power CMOS 555 
timer contained in a 14-pin DIL package. The two 
devices may again be used entirely independently 
and share the same electrical characteristics as 
the low-power CMOS 555. 
Pin connecting details for the above devices can 
be found in Appendix 4.
Monostable pulse generator
Fig. 12.3 shows a standard 555 timer operating 
as a monostable pulse generator. The 
monostable timing period (i.e. the time for which 
the output is high) is initiated by a falling edge 
trigger pulse applied to the trigger input (pin 2) 
(see Fig. 12.4).
When this falling edge trigger pulse is received 
and falls below one-third of the supply voltage, 
the output of IC2 (Fig. 12.1) goes high and the 
bistable will be placed in the set state. The 

12 The 555 timer
225
The period of the 555 monostable output can be 
changed very easily by simply altering the values 
of the timing resistor, R, and/or timing capacitor, 
C. Doubling the value of R will double the timing 
period. Similarly, doubling the value of C will 
double the timing period. 
Values for C and R can be selected over 
quite a wide range but it is worth noting that 
the performance of the timer may become 
unpredictable if the values of these components 
are outside the recommended range:
C = 470 pF to 470 μF
R = 1 kΩ  to 3.3 MΩ
For any particular monostable timing period, the 
required values for C and R can be determined 
from the formula shown earlier or by using the 
graph shown in Fig. 12.5. The output period can 
be easily adjusted by making R a preset resistor 
with a value of about twice that of the calculated 
value.
Example 12.1
Design a timer circuit that will produce a 10 ms 
pulse when a negative-going trigger pulse is 
applied to it.
Solution
Using the circuit shown in Fig. 12.4, the value of 
monostable timing period can be calculated from 
the formula:
ton = 1.1 C R
We need to choose an appropriate value for C that 
is in the range stated earlier. Since we require a 
fairly modest time period we will choose a mid-
range value for C. This should help to ensure that 
the value of R is neither too small nor too large. A

inverted Q output of the bistable then goes low, 
TR1 is placed in the off (non-conducting) state and 
the output voltage (pin 3) goes high.
The capacitor, C, then charges through the series 
resistor, R, until the voltage at the threshold input 
reaches two-thirds of the supply voltage (Vcc). At 
this point, the output of the upper comparator 
changes state and the bistable is reset. The 
inverted Q output then goes high, TR1 is driven 
into conduction and the final output goes low. 
The device then remains in the inactive state until 
another falling trigger pulse is received.
The trigger and output waveforms produced by 
the circuit of Fig. 12.3 are shown in Fig. 12.4. The 
waveform has the following properties:

We need to choose an appropriate value for 
C that is in the range stated earlier. Since we 
require a fairly long time period we will choose 
a relatively large value of C in order to avoid 
making the value of R too high. A value of 100 μF

In practice 560 kΩ (the nearest preferred value –

The ‘start’ button needs to be connected between 
pin 2 and ground while the ‘stop’ button needs to 
be connected between pin 4 and ground. Each of 
the inputs requires a pull-up resistor to ensure 
that the input is taken high when the switch is not 
being operated. The precise value of the  ‘pull-up’ 
resistor is unimportant and a value of 10 kΩ will 
be perfectly adequate in this application. The 
complete circuit of the 60 s timer is shown in 
Fig. 12.6.
Astable pulse generator
Fig. 12.7 shows how the standard 555 can be 
used as an astable pulse generator. In order to 
understand how this circuit operates, assume that 
Example 12.2
Design a timer circuit that will produce a +5 V 
output for a period of 60 s when a ‘start’ button is 
operated. The time period is to be aborted when a 
‘stop’ button is operated. 
Solution
For the purposes of this question we shall 
assume that the ‘start’ and ‘stop’ buttons both 
have normally open (NO) actions.
The value of monostable timing period can be 
calculated from the formula:
ton = 1.1 C R

and R for a 555 operating in monostable mode. 
The dotted line shows how a 10 ms pulse will be

The p.r.f. of the 555 astable output can be 
changed very easily by simply altering the values 
of R1, R2 and C. The values chosen for R1, R2 and 
C should normally be selected from within the 
following ranges in order to provide satisfactory 
performance:
C = 10 nF to 470 μF
R1 = 1 kΩ to 1 MΩ
R2 = 1 kΩ to 1 MΩ
The required values of C, R1 and R2 for any 
required p.r.f. and duty cycle can be determined 
the output (pin 3) is initially high and that TR1 
(Fig. 12.1) is in the non-conducting state. The 
capacitor, C, will begin to charge with current 
supplied by means of series resistors, R1 and R2.
When the voltage at the threshold input (pin 6) 
exceeds two-thirds of the supply voltage the 
output of the upper comparator, IC1, will change 
state and the bistable will become reset due to 
voltage transition that appears at R. This, in turn, 
will make the inverted Q output go high, turning 
TR1 at the same time. Due to the inverting action 
of the buffer, IC4, the final output (pin 3) will go 
low.
The capacitor, C, will now discharge, with current 
flowing through R 2 into the collector of TR1. At a 
certain point, the voltage appearing at the trigger 
input (pin 2) will have fallen back to one-third 
of the supply voltage, at which point the lower 
comparator will change state and the voltage 
transition at S will return the bistable to its original 
set condition. The inverted Q output then goes 
low, TR1 switches off (no longer conducting), 
and the output (pin 3) goes high. Thereafter, 
the entire charge/discharge cycle is repeated 
indefinitely. 
The output waveform produced by the circuit of 
Fig. 12.7 is shown in Fig. 12.8. The waveform has 
the following properties:
Time for which output is high:  
ton = 0.693 C (R1 + R2) 
Time for which output is low:

which ton = toff. However, by making R2 very much 
larger than R1, the timer can be made to produce 
a reasonably symmetrical square wave output 
(note that the minimum recommended value for 
R2 is 1 kΩ – see earlier).

that the value of R is neither too small nor too 
large. A value of 1 μF should also be easy to 
obtain. Making R the subject of the formula and

Square wave generators
Because the high time (ton) is always greater 
than the low time (toff), the mark to space ratio 
produced by a 555 timer can never be made equal 
to (or less than) unity. This could be a problem 
if we need to produce a precise square wave in

where R2 >> R1 (i.e. for a square wave output).

We shall use the minimum recommended value 
for R1 (i.e. 10 kΩ) and ensure that the value of 
R2 that we calculate from the formula is at least 
ten times larger in order to satisfy the criteria 
that R2 should be very much larger than R1. When 
selecting the value for C we need to choose 
a value that will keep the value of R2 relatively 
large. A value of 100 nF should be about right 
and should also be easy to locate. Making R2 the 
subject of the formula and substituting for C =

good square wave output.

R (in MΩ). Plot a graph showing corresponding 
values of monostable time plotted against 
corresponding values of C × R using the graph 
layout shown in Fig. 12.13.
Conclusions
Comment on the shape of the graph. Is this what 
you would expect? Measure the slope of the 
graph and use this to confirm the relationship 
for the monostable timing period quoted on 
page 225. If the graph is not linear can you 
suggest any reasons for this?
p.r.f. generated by IC1 is adjustable by means of 
switch selected capacitors, C1 to C3, together with 
variable resistor, VR1. The output from IC1 (pin 3) 
is fed via C5 to the trigger input of IC2 (pin 2). 
The monostable period of IC2 is adjustable by 
means of switch selected capacitors, C6 to C8, 
together with variable resistor, VR2. The output 
from IC2 (pin 3) is fed to the output via VR3.
The p.r.f. is adjustable over the range 10 Hz  to 
10 kHz while pulse widths can be varied from 
50 μs to 50 ms. The output voltage is adjustable 
from 0 V to 10 V. Finally, R5 is included in order to 
limit the output current and provide a measure of 
protection in the event of a short-circuit present at 
the output.
Practical investigation
Objective
To investigate the operation of a 555 monostable 
timer circuit. 
Simulator
Breadboard, 5 V d.c. power supply, 555 timer, 
resistors of 10 kΩ (two required), 220 Ω,
100 kΩ and 1 MΩ 5% 0.25 W, capacitors of 10 μF 
and 100 μF 16 V, LED, two normally open (NO) 
pushbutton switches, stopwatch or wristwatch 
with seconds display.
Procedure
Connect the circuit as shown in Fig. 12.12 with 
C = 10 μF and R = 100 kΩ. Connect the supply 
and press the ‘stop’ button. The LED should be 
off (indicating that the output is at 0 V).
Observe the time display and, at a convenient 
point, press the ‘start’ button. The LED should 
become illuminated after a period of about 1 s 
(this will probably be too short an interval to be 
measured accurately). Record the monostable 
time period (i.e. the time between pressing the 
‘start’ button and the LED becoming illuminated) 
(see Table 12.2).
Repeat the procedure for each of the remaining 
C–R values shown in Table 12.2. Note that you

Test equipment and 
measurements
Chapter summary
This chapter is about making practical measurements on real electronic 
circuits. It describes and explains the use of the basic items of test 
equipment that you will find in any electronics laboratory or workshop. 
We begin the chapter by looking at how we use a moving coil meter to 
measure voltage, current and resistance and then quickly move on to 
more complex multi-range analogue and digital instruments and the 
oscilloscope. To help you make use of these test instruments we have 
included some DOs and DON’Ts. If you intend to become an electronic 
engineer these will become your ‘tools of the trade’. Being able to use 
them effectively is just the first step on the ladder!

Meters
Straightforward measurements of voltage, current 
and resistance can provide useful information 
on the state of almost any circuit. To get the 
best from a meter it is not only necessary to 
select an appropriate measurement function and 
range, but also to be aware of the limitations of 
the instrument and the effect that it might have 
on the circuit under investigation. When fault 
finding, it is interpretation that is put on the meter 
readings rather than the indications themselves.
Figs 13.2(a) and 13.2(b), respectively, show 
the circuit of a simple voltmeter and a simple 
ammeter. Each instrument is based on the 
moving coil indicator shown in Fig. 13.1. The 
voltmeter consists of a multiplier resistor 
connected in series with the basic moving coil 
movement while the ammeter consists of a 
shunt resistor connected in parallel with the basic 
moving coil instrument. When determining the 
value of multiplier or shunt resistance (Rm and 
Rs, respectively, in Fig. 13.2) it is important to 
remember that the coil of the moving coil meter 
also has a resistance. We have shown this as 
a resistor, r, connected with the moving coil in 
Fig. 13.3. In both cases, the current required 
to produce full-scale deflection of the meter 
movement is Im.
In the voltmeter circuit shown in Fig. 13.3(a):
V = Im Rm + Im r

The circuit of a simple ohmmeter is shown in 
Fig. 13.4. The battery is used to supply a current 
that will flow in the unknown resistor, Rx, which 
is indicated on the moving coil meter. Before use, 
the variable resistor, RV, must be adjusted in order 
to produce full-scale deflection (corresponding 
to zero on the ohm scale). Zero resistance thus 
corresponds to maximum indication. Infinite 
resistance (i.e. when the two terminals are left 
open-circuit) corresponds to minimum indication. 
The ohm scale is thus reversed when compared 
with a voltage or current scale. The scale is also 
non-linear, as shown in Fig. 13.5. 
Multi-range meters
For practical measurements on electronic circuits 
it is often convenient to combine the functions 
of a voltmeter, ammeter and ohmmeter into 
a single instrument (known as a multi-range 
meter or simply a multimeter). In a conventional 
multimeter as many as eight or nine measuring 
functions may be provided with up to six or eight 
ranges for each measuring function. Besides 
the normal voltage, current and resistance 
functions, some meters also include facilities for 
checking transistors and measuring capacitance. 
Most multi-range meters normally operate from 
internal batteries and thus they are independent 
of the mains supply. This leads to a high degree 
of portability which can be all-important when 
measurements are to be made away from a 
laboratory or workshop.
Displays
Analogue instruments employ conventional 
moving coil meters and the display takes the form 
of a pointer moving across a calibrated scale. 
This arrangement is not so convenient to use as 
that employed in digital instruments because the 
position of the pointer is rarely exact and may 
require interpolation. Analogue instruments do, 
however, offer some advantages, not the least 
of which lies in the fact that it is very easy to 
make adjustments to a circuit while observing 
the relative direction of the pointer; a movement 
in one direction represents an increase and in 
the other a decrease. Despite this, the principal 
disadvantage of many analogue meters is the 
rather cramped, and sometimes confusing, 
scale calibration. To determine the exact reading 
requires first an estimation of the pointer’s 
position and then the application of some mental 
arithmetic based on the range switch setting.

Figure 13.5 A typical ohmmeter scale

13 Test equipment and measurements
236
Digital meters, on the other hand, are usually 
extremely easy to read and have displays that 
are clear, unambiguous and capable of providing 
a very high resolution. It is thus possible to 
distinguish between readings that are very 
close. This is just not possible with an analogue 
instrument. Typical analogue and digital meters 
are shown in Fig. 13.6.
The type of display used in digital multi-range 
meters is either the liquid crystal display (LCD) 
or the light emitting diode (LED). The former 
type requires very little electrical power and 
thus is to be preferred on the grounds of low 
battery consumption. LCD displays are, however, 
somewhat difficult to read under certain 
light conditions and, furthermore, the display 
response can be rather slow. LED displays can 
be extremely bright but unfortunately consume 
considerable power and this makes them 
unsuitable for use in battery-powered portable 
instruments.
Loading
Another very significant difference between 
analogue and digital instruments is the input 
resistance that they present to the circuit under 
investigation when taking voltage measurements. 
The resistance of a reasonable quality analogue 
multi-range meter can be as low as 50 kΩ on 
2.5 V. With a digital instrument, on the other 
hand, the input resistance is typically 10 MΩ on 
the 2 V range. The digital instrument is thus to be 
preferred when accurate readings are to be taken. 
This is particularly important when measurements 
are to be made on high-impedance circuits, as 
illustrated by the following:
Two multi-range meters are used to measure the 
voltage produced by the two potential dividers 
shown in Fig. 13.7. One of the meters is an 
analogue type having an internal resistance of 
10 kW on the 10 V range. The other is a digital 
type that has the much higher internal resistance 
of 10 MW.  The two potential dividers each 
consist of resistors or identical value. However, 
the potential divider of Fig. 13.7(b) has a much 
lower resistance than that of Fig. 13.7(a). In 
both cases the ‘true’ voltage produced by the 
potential divider should be half the supply, i.e. 
exactly 5 V. The actual readings obtained from the 
instruments are shown in Table 13.1.
The large difference in the case of Fig. 13.7(b) 
illustrates the effect of voltmeter loading on a 
high-resistance circuit. An appreciable current is 
drawn away from the circuit into the measuring 
instrument. Clearly this is a very undesirable 
effect!

Sensitivity
The sensitivity of an analogue meter may be 
expressed in several ways. One is to specify 
the basic full-scale deflection (f.s.d.) current 
of the moving coil meter. This is typically 50 μA 
or less. An alternative method is that of quoting 
an ­ohms-per­-volt rating. This is, in effect, 
the resistance presented by the meter when 
switched to the 1 V range.
The ohms-per-volt rating is inversely proportional 
to the basic full-scale sensitivity of the meter 
movement and, to determine the resistance of 
a meter on a particular voltage range, it is only 
necessary to multiply the range setting by the 
‘ohms-per-volt’ rating. Table 13.2 shows how 
meter f.s.d. and ohms-per-volt are related. From 
this we can conclude that:
Meter f.s.d. =
1
Ohms-per-volt
or

Digital multi-range meters
Low-cost digital multi-range meters have been 
made possible by the advent of mass-produced 
LSI devices and liquid crystal displays. A 3½-digit 
display is the norm and this consists of three 
full digits that can display ‘0’ to ‘9’ and a fourth 
(most significant) digit which can only display ‘1’. 
Thus, the maximum display indication, ignoring 
the range switching and decimal point, is 1999; 
anything greater over-ranges the display. 
The resolution of the instrument is the lowest 
increment that can be displayed and this would 
normally be an increase or decrease of one unit 
in the last (least significant) digit. The sensitivity 
of a digital instrument is generally defined as the 
smallest increment that can be displayed on the 
lowest (most sensitive) range. Sensitivity and 
resolution are thus not quite the same. To put this 
into context, consider the following example:
A digital multi-range meter has a 3½-digit display. 
When switched to the 2 V range, the maximum 
indication would be 1.999 V and any input of 
2 V, or greater, would produce an over-range 
indication. On the 2 V range, the instrument has a 
resolution of 0.001 V (or 1 mV). The lowest range 
of the instrument is 200 mV (corresponding to

a maximum display of 199.9 mV) and thus the 
meter has a sensitivity of 0.1 mV (or 100 μV).
Nearly all digital meters have automatic zero and 
polarity indicating facilities and some also have 
autoranging. This feature, which is only found 
in the more expensive instruments, automatically 
changes the range setting so that maximum 
resolution is obtained without over-ranging. 
There is thus no need for manual operation 
of the range switch once the indicating mode 
has been selected. This is an extremely useful 
facility since it frees you from the need to make 
repeated adjustments to the range switch while 
measurements are being made.
Example 13.5
A digital multi-range meter has a 4½-digit display. 
When switched to the 200 V range, determine:
(a)	the maximum indication that will appear on the 
display
(b)	the resolution of the instrument.
Solution
(a)	The maximum indication that will appear on 
the display is 199.99 V
(b)	The resolution of the instrument will be 0.01 V 
or 10 mV.
Using an analogue multi-range 
meter
Fig. 13.8 shows the controls and display provided 
by a simple analogue multi-range meter. The 
range selector allows you to select from a total of 
20 ranges and six measurement functions. These 
functions are:
X
X d.c. voltage (DC, V)
X
X d.c. current (DC, mA)
X
X a.c. voltage (AC, V)
X
X Resistance (OHM)
X
X Continuity test (BUZZ)
X
X Battery check (BAT)
Note that more complex instruments may have 
several more ranges.
D.C. voltage measurement
Fig. 13.9 shows how to make d.c. voltage 
measurements. In both cases, the red and black 
test leads are connected to the ‘+’ and ‘−’ sockets, 
respectively. In Fig. 13.9, the range selector is 
set to DCV, 50 V. The pointer is reading just less 
than 45 on the range that has 50 as its full-scale 
indication (note that there are three calibrated 
voltage scales with maximum indications of 
10 V, 50 V and 250 V, respectively. The reading 
indicated is approximately 45 V. 
D.C. current measurement
Fig. 13.10 shows how to make a d.c. current 
measurement. Once again, the red and black 
test leads are connected to the ‘+’ and ‘−’ 
sockets, respectively. The range selector is set 
to DC, 5 mA. In Fig. 13.10, the pointer is reading 
between 35 and 40 (and is actually a little closer 
to 35 than it is to 40) on the range that has 50 
as its full-scale indication. The actual reading 
indicated is thus approximately 3.7 mA.
D.C. high-current measurement
In common with many simple multi-range meters, 
both analogue and digital, the high current range 
(e.g. 10 A) is not only selected using the range 
selector switch but a separate input connection 
must also be made. The reason for this is simply 
that the range switch and associated wiring is not 
designed to carry a high current. Instead, the high-
current shunt is terminated separately at its own  
‘10 A’ socket.
Fig. 13.11 shows the connections and range 
selector settings to permit high-current d.c. 
measurement. The range selector is set to 
DC 10 A and the red and black test leads are 
connected to ‘10 A’ and ‘−’, respectively. The 
pointer is reading mid-way between 9 and 10 on 
the range that has 10 as its full-scale indication. 
The actual reading indicated is thus 9.5 A.
A.C. voltage measurement
Fig. 13.12 shows how to make a.c. voltage 
measurements. Once again, the red and black 
test leads are connected to the ‘+’ and ‘−’  
sockets, respectively. In Fig. 13.12, the range 
selector is set to AC, 10 V. The pointer is reading

the ohm scale). In Fig. 13.14 the range selector is 
set to OHM, ×1. The pointer is reading mid-way 
between 0 and 10 and the resistance indicated is 
approximately 5 Ω.
DOs and DON’Ts of using an analogue 
multimeter
DO ensure that you have selected the correct 
range and measuring function before attempting 
to connect the meter into a circuit.
DO select a higher range than expected and then 
progressively increase the sensitivity as necessary 
to obtain a meaningful indication.
DO remember to zero on the ohm range before 
measuring resistance.
DO switch the meter to the ‘off’ position (if one 
is available) before attempting to transport the 
meter.
DO check and, if necessary, replace the internal 
batteries regularly.
DO use properly insulated test leads and prods.
DON’T attempt to measure resistance in a circuit 
that has the power applied to it.
mid-way between 2 and 3 and the indicated 
reading is approximately 2.5 V.
Output level measurement
Fig. 13.13 shows how to make output level 
measurements. The red and black test leads 
are respectively connected to ‘OUT’ and ‘−’. 
The range selector is set to AC, 10 V (note that 
the output level facility is actually based on a.c. 
voltage measurement).
Output level indications are indicated in 
decibels (dB) where 0 dB (the reference level) 
corresponds to a power level of 1 mW in a 
resistance of 600 Ω. The pointer is reading 
mid-way between +18 and +20 on the dB scale 
and the indicated reading is +19 dB.
Resistance
Fig. 13.14 shows how to make resistance 
measurements. In all three cases, the red and 
black test leads are connected to the ‘+’ and 
‘−’ sockets, respectively. Before making any 
measurements it is absolutely essential to zero 
the meter. This is achieved by shorting the test 
leads together and adjusting the ZERO ADJ

242
the ½ simply indicates that the first digit is either 
blank (zero) or 1. Consequently, the maximum 
indication on the 2 V range will be 1.999 V and 
this shows that the instrument is capable of 
offering a resolution of 1 mV on the 2 V range 
(i.e. the smallest increment in voltage that can 
be measured is 1 mV). The resolution obtained 
from a comparable analogue meter would be 
of the order of 50 mV or so, and thus the digital 
instrument provides a resolution that is many 
times greater than its analogue counterpart.
Fig. 13.15 shows the controls and display 
provided by a simple digital multi-range meter. 
The mode switch and range selector allow you 
to select from a total of 20 ranges and eight 
measurement functions. These functions are:
X
X d.c. voltage (DC, V)
X
X d.c. current (DC, A)
X
X a.c. voltage (AC, V)
X
X a.c. current (AC, A)
X
X Resistance (OHM)
X
X Capacitance (CAP)
X
X Continuity test (buzzer)
X
X Transistor current gain (hFE)
DON’T rely on voltage readings made on high-
impedance circuits (the meter’s own internal 
resistance may have a significant effect on the 
voltages that you measure).
DON’T rely on voltage and current readings made 
on circuits where high-frequency signals may be 
present (in such cases an analogue meter may 
produce readings that are wildly inaccurate or 
misleading).
DON’T subject the instrument to excessive 
mechanical shock or vibration (this can damage 
the sensitive meter movement).
DON’T leave the instrument for very long periods 
without removing the batteries (these may leak 
and cause damage).
Using a digital multi-range meter
Digital multi-range meters offer a number of 
significant advantages when compared with 
their more humble analogue counterparts. The 
display fitted to a digital multi-range meter usually 
consists of a 3½-digit seven-segment display −

d.c. measurement. The mode switch and range 
selectors are set to DC, 2,000 mA (2 A) and the 
red and black test leads are connected to ’10 A’ 
and ‘COM’, respectively. The display indicates a 
reading of 2.99 A.
A.C. voltage measurement
Fig. 13.19 shows how to make a.c. voltage 
measurements. Once again, the red and black test 
leads are connected to the ‘V-OHM’ and ‘COM’ 
sockets, respectively. In Fig. 13.19 the mode 
switch and range selectors are set to AC, 10 V, 
and the display indicates a reading of 1.736 V.
Resistance measureme nt
Fig. 13.20 shows how to make resistance 
measurements. As before, the red and black test 
leads are respectively connected to ‘V-OHM’ and 
‘COM’. In Fig. 13.20 the mode switch and range 
selectors are set to OHM, 200Ω, and the meter 
indicates a reading of 55.8 Ω. Note that it is not 
necessary to ‘zero’ the meter by shorting the test

Fig. 13.16 shows how to make d.c. voltage

the ‘V-OHM’ and ‘COM’ sockets, respectively. 
In Fig. 13.6 the mode switch and range selector 
are set to DCV, 200 V, and the display indicates a 
reading of 124.5 V.
D.C. current measurements
Fig. 13.17 shows how to make a d.c. current 
measurement. Here, the red and black test 
leads are connected to the ‘mA’ and ‘COM’ 
sockets, respectively. The mode switch and range 
selectors are set to DC, 200 mA, and the display 
indicates a reading of 85.9 mA.
D.C. high-current measurement
In common with simple analogue multi-range 
meters, the meter uses a shunt which is 
directly connected to a separate ‘10 A’ terminal.

(as would be the case with an analogue meter).
Capacitance measurement
Many modern digital multi-range meters 
incorporate capacitance measuring although 
this may be limited to just one or two ranges. 
Fig. 13.21 shows how to carry out a capacitance 
measurement. The capacitor on test is inserted 
into the two-way connector marked ‘CAP’ while 
the mode switch and range selector controls are 
set to DC, 2,000 pF. The display indication shown 
in Fig. 13.21 corresponds to a capacitance of 
329 pF. 
Transistor current gain (hFE) measurement
Many modern digital multi-range meters also 
provide some (fairly basic) facilities for checking 
transistors. Fig. 13.22 shows how to measure 
the current gain (hFE) of an NPN transistor (see 
page 101). The transistor is inserted into the 
three-way connector marked ‘EBC’, taking care 
to ensure that the emitter lead is connected to 
‘E’, the base lead to ‘B’ and the collector lead to 
‘C’. The mode switch and range selector controls 
are set to DC, NPN respectively. The display 
indication in Fig. 13.22 shows that the device 
has a current gain of 93. This means that, for the 
device in question, the ratio of collector current 
(IC) to base current (IB) is 93.
Connecting a meter into a circuit
Fig. 13.23 shows how a meter is connected to 
read the voltages and currents present at various 
points in a simple transistor audio amplifier. 
(a) At A, the supply current is measured by 
removing the supply rail fuse and inserting 
the meter in its place. A suitable meter range 
is 2 A, DC. 
(b) At B, the collector current for TR4 is measured 
by removing the service link and inserting the 
meter in its place. A suitable meter range is 
2 A, DC. 
(c) At C, the emitter current for TR4 can be 
measured by connecting the meter across 
the emitter resistor, R11, and measuring the 
voltage drop across it. The emitter current 
can then be calculated using Ohm’s Law. This 
can be much quicker than disconnecting the 
emitter lead and inserting the meter switched 
to the current range. A suitable range for the 

13 Test equipment and measurements
248
Figure 13.22 Digital multimeter set to the transistor current gain, NPN range
meter is 2 V, DC (note that 2 V is dropped 
across 1 Ω when a current of 2 A is flowing).
(d) At D, the voltage at the junction of R11 and 
R12 is measured by connecting the meter 
between the junction of R11 and R12 and 
common/ground. A suitable meter range is 
20 V, DC.
(e) At E, the base-emitter voltage for TR2 is 
measured by connecting the meter with 
its positive lead to the base of TR2 and its 
negative lead to the emitter of TR2. A suitable 
meter range is 2 V, DC. 
DOs and DON’Ts of using a digital multimeter 
DO ensure that you have selected the correct 
range and measuring function before attempting 
to connect the meter into a circuit. 
DO select a higher range than expected and then 
progressively increase the sensitivity as necessary
to obtain a meaningful indication. 
DO switch the meter to the ‘off’ position in order 
to conserve battery life when the instrument is 
not being used.
DO check and, if necessary, replace the internal 
battery regularly.
DO use properly insulated test leads and prods. 
DO check that a suitably rated fuse is used in 
conjunction with the current ranges (if the current 
ranges aren’t working it’s probably the fuse that’s 
blown!).
DON’T attempt to measure resistance in a circuit 
that has the power applied to it.
DON’T rely on voltage and current readings made 
on circuits where high-frequency signals may be 
present (as with analogue instruments, digital 
meters may produce readings that are wildly 
inaccurate or misleading in such circumstances). 
DON’T rely on measurements made when 
voltage/current is changing or when a significant 
amount of a.c. may be present superimposed on 
a d.c. level.
The oscilloscope
An oscilloscope is an extremely comprehensive 
and versatile item of test equipment which can 
be used in a variety of measuring applications, 
the most important of which is the display of 
time-related voltage waveforms.

13 Test equipment and measurements
249
Figure 13.23 Connecting a meter to display currents and voltages in a simple audio amplifi er
Figure 13.24 Using an oscilloscope graticule
The oscilloscope display is provided by a cathode 
ray tube (CRT) that has a typical screen area of 
8 cm × 10 cm. The CRT is fitted with a graticule 
that may either be integral with the tube face 
or a separate translucent sheet. The graticule is 
usually ruled with a 1 cm grid to which further 
bold lines may be added to mark the major axes 
on the central viewing area. Accurate voltage and 
time measurements may be made with reference 
to the graticule, applying a scale factor derived 
from the appropriate range switch.
A word of caution is appropriate at this 
stage, however. Before taking meaningful 
measurements from the CRT screen it is 
absolutely essential to ensure that the front 
panel variable controls are set in the calibrate 
(CAL) position. Results will almost certainly be 
inaccurate if this is not the case!
The use of the graticule is illustrated by the 
following example: 
An oscilloscope screen is depicted in Fig. 13.24. 
This diagram is reproduced actual size and the 
fine graticule markings are shown every 2 mm 
along the central vertical and horizontal axes. 

13 Test equipment and measurements
250
Figure 13.25  Front panel controls and displays on a typical dual-channel oscilloscope
The oscilloscope is operated with all relevant 
controls in the ‘CAL’ position. The timebase 
(horizontal deflection) is switched to the 1 ms/
cm range and the vertical attenuator (vertical 
deflection) is switched to the 1 V/cm range. The 
overall height of the trace is 4 cm and thus the 
peak–peak voltage is 4 × 1 V = 4 V. Similarly, 
the time for one complete cycle (period) is 2.5 × 
1 ms = 2.5 ms. One further important piece of 
information is the shape of the waveform that, in 
this case, is sinusoidal.
The front panel layout for a typical general-purpose 
two-channel oscilloscope is shown in Figs 13.25 
and 13.26. The controls and adjustments are 
summarized in Table 13.3.
Using an oscilloscope
An oscilloscope can provide a great deal of 
information about what is going on in a circuit. 
In effect, it allows you to ‘see’ into the circuit, 
displaying waveforms that correspond to the 
signals that are present. The procedure and 
adjustments differ according to the type of 
waveform being investigated and whether 
the oscilloscope is being used to display a 
single waveform (i.e. single-channel operation) 
or whether it is being used to display two 
waveforms simultaneously (i.e. dual-channel 
operation).
Sinusoidal waveforms (single-channel 
operation)
The procedure for displaying a repetitive sine 
wave waveform is shown in Fig. 13.27. The 
signal is connected to the Channel 1 input (with 
‘AC’ input selected) and the mode switch in the 
Channel 1 position. ‘Channel 1’ must be selected 
as the trigger source and the trigger level control 
adjusted for a stable display. Where accurate 
measurements are required it is essential to 
ensure that the ‘Cal’ position is selected for both 
the variable gain and time controls.

Control	
	
	
Adjustment
Cathode ray tube display
Focus	
Provides a correctly focused display on the CRT screen.
Intensity 	
Adjusts the brightness of the display.
Astigmatism	
Provides a uniformly defined display over the entire screen area and in both x and y 
directions.The control is normally used in conjunction with the focus and intensity 
controls.
Trace rotation	
Permits accurate alignment of the display with respect to the graticule.
Scale illumination	
Controls the brightness of the graticule lines.
Horizontal deflection system
Timebase (time/cm)	
Adjusts the timebase range and sets the horizontal time scale. Usually this control 
takes the form of a multi-position rotary switch and an additional continuously variable 
control is often provided. The ‘CAL’ position is usually at one, or other, extreme setting 
of this control.
Stability	
Adjusts the timebase so that a stable displayed waveform is obtained.
Trigger level	
Selects the particular level on the triggering signal at which the timebase sweep 
commences.
Trigger slope	
This usually takes the form of a switch that determines whether triggering occurs on 
the positive- or negative-going edge of the triggering signal.
Trigger source	
This switch allows selection of one of several waveforms for use as the timebase 
trigger. The options usually include an internal signal derived from the vertical amplifier, 
a 50 Hz signal derived from the supply mains, and a signal which may be applied to an 
external trigger input.
Horizontal position	
Positions the display along the horizontal axis of the CRT.
Vertical deflection system
Vertical attenuator (V/cm)	
Adjusts the magnitude of the signal attenuator (V/cm) displayed and sets the vertical 
voltage scale. This control is invariably a multi-position rotary switch; however, an 
additional variable gain control is sometimes also provided. Often this control is 
concentric with the main control and the ‘CAL’ position is usually at one, or other, 
extreme setting of the control.
Vertical position	
Positions the display along the vertical axis of the CRT.
a.c.-d.c.-ground	
Normally an oscilloscope employs d.c. coupling throughout the vertical amplifier; 
hence a shift along the vertical axis will occur whenever a direct voltage is present 
at the input. When investigating waveforms in a circuit one often encounters a.c. 
superimposed on d.c. levels; the latter may be removed by inserting a capacitor in 
series with the signal. With the a.c.-d.c.-ground switch in the a.c. position a capacitor 
is inserted in the input lead, whereas in the d.c. position the capacitor is shorted. If 
ground is selected, the vertical input is taken to common (0 V) and the oscilloscope 
input is left floating. This last facility is useful in allowing the accurate positioning of 
the vertical position control along the central axis. The switch may then be set to d.c. 
and the magnitude of any d.c. level present at the input may be easily measured by 
examining the shift along the vertical axis.
Chopped-alternate	
This control, which is only used in dual-beam oscilloscopes, provides selection of the 
beam splitting mode. In the chopped position, the trace displays a small portion of 
one vertical channel waveform followed by an equally small portion of the other. The 
traces are, in effect, sampled at a relatively fast rate, the result being two apparently 
continuous displays. In the alternate position, a complete horizontal sweep is devoted 
to each channel alternately.

level control adjusted for a stable display (which 
can be triggered on the positive- or negative-going 
edge of the waveform according to the setting of 
the trigger polarity button). Any d.c. level present 
on the input can be measured from the offset 
produced on the y-axis. To do this, you must first 
select ‘GND’ on the input selector then centre 
the trace along the y-axis before switching to 
‘DC’ and noting how far up or down the trace 
moves (above or below 0 V). This may sound a 
little difficult but it is actually quite easy to do! The 
same technique can be used for measuring any 
d.c. offset present on a sinusoidal signal.
Sine/square waveforms (dual-channel 
operation)
The procedure for displaying two waveforms 
(either sine or square or any other repetitive 
signal) simultaneously is shown in Fig. 13.29. 
The two signals are connected to their respective 
inputs (Channel 1 and Channel 2) and the mode 
switch set to the ‘Dual’ position. The oscilloscope 
can be triggered by either of the signals (Channel 
1 or Channel 2) as desired. Once again, the 
display can be triggered on the positive- or 
negative-going edge of the waveform depending 
upon the setting of the trigger polarity button. 
Dual-channel operation can be invaluable when it 
is necessary to compare two waveforms, e.g. the 
input and output waveforms of an amplifier.
Connecting an oscilloscope into a 
circuit
Fig. 13.30 shows how an oscilloscope can be 
connected to display the waveforms present 
at various points in a simple transistor audio 
amplifier. To reduce the likelihood of picking up 
hum and noise, the input to the oscilloscope is via 
a screened lead fitted with a probe. The ground 
(outer screen) is connected to the common 0 V 
rail while the probe is simply moved around the 
circuit from point to point. Note that, because of

NOT usually possible to display a waveform that

base and emitter of a transistor). For this reason, 
waveforms are nearly always displayed relative to

of an amplifier or other electronic system. 
Instead of using a sine wave as an input 
signal, a square wave input is used. Different 
frequency response produces a different effect 
on a waveform and thus it is possible to assess 
whether the frequency response is good or poor 
(a perfect square wave output corresponds to a 
perfect frequency response). Fig. 13.32 shows 
waveforms that correspond to different frequency 
response characteristics.
Measuring pulse parameters
When dealing with rectangular waveforms and 
pulses it is often necessary to be able to use an 
oscilloscope to measure parameters such as:
Checking distortion
Oscilloscopes are frequently used to investigate 
distortion in amplifiers and other electronic 
systems. Different forms of distortion have a 
different effect on a waveform and thus it is 
possible to determine which type of distortion 
is present. A ‘pure’ sine wave is used as an 
input signal and the output is then displayed on 
the oscilloscope. Fig. 13.31 shows waveforms 
that correspond to the most common forms of 
distortion.
Checking frequency response
An oscilloscope can also be used to provide a 
rapid assessment of the frequency response

positions before attempting to make accurate 
measurements based on the attenuator/timebase 
settings and graticule.
DO check that you have the correct trigger 
source selected for the type of waveform under 
investigation.
DO remember to align the trace with the x -axis of 
the graticule with the input selector set to ‘GND’ 
prior to taking d.c. offset measurements. 
DO make use of the built-in calibrator facility to 
check the accuracy of the attenuator and the 
‘CAL’ setting of the variable gain control.
DO use properly screened leads and a suitable 
probe for connecting to the circuit under 
investigation.
DO check that you have made a proper 
connection to ground or 0 V prior to taking 
measurements.
DON’T leave the intensity control set at a high 
level for any length of time. 
DON’T leave a bright spot on the display for even
the shortest time (this may burn the phosphor 
coating of the screen).
DON’T rely on voltage measurements on circuits 
where high-frequency signals may be outside the 
bandwidth of the oscilloscope.
DON’T forget to set the a.c.-d.c.-gnd switch to the 
d.c. position when making measurements of the 
d.c. offset present on a.c. signals.
DON’T place the oscilloscope where there is 
a strong local magnetic field. This may cause 
unwanted deflection of the electron beam!
Periodic time, t
This is the time (measured at the 50% amplitude 
points) for one complete cycle of a repetitive 
pulse waveform. The periodic time is sometimes 
referred to as the period (see page 73). Note also 
that the pulse repetition frequency (p.r.f.) is the 
reciprocal of the periodic time.
On time, ton
This is the time for which the pulse amplitude 
exceeds 50% of its amplitude. The on-time is 
sometimes referred to as the high time.
Off time, toff
This is the time for which the pulse amplitude 
falls below 50% of its amplitude. The off time is 
sometimes referred to as the low time.
Rise time, trise
This is the time measured between the 10% and 
90% points on the rising (or positive-going) edge 
of the pulse.
Fall time, tfall
This is the time measured between the 90% and
10% points on the falling (or negative-going) 
edge of the pulse.
These pulse parameters are shown in Fig. 13.33.

with a small computer than a conventional CRT-
based oscilloscope, but which is eminently 
portable and software configurable. 
The simplified block schematic diagram of a 
typical DSO is shown in Fig. 13.36. The two input 
channels (Ch. 1 or A and Ch. 2 or B) are fed via a 
high-impedance JFET amplifier to a multiplexer 
that allows the two input signals to be combined 
in various ways (A, B, A + B, A − B, etc.). The 
analogue output of the two multiplexers is fed a 
variable gain amplifier and from there, via a low-
pass filter (LPF) to a dual high-speed analogue-
to-digital converter (ADC). The multi-bit digitally 
encoded output of the ADC is then fed to a field 
programmable gate array (FPGA). This high-speed 
application-specific integrated circuit provides the 
necessary hardware logic to process the sampled 
digital signals and store them in static random 
access memory (SRAM). The captured data is 
also made accessible to the CPU, which provides 
further signal processing as well as the ability 
to accept commands via the keyboard interface 
and output data for display on the LCD panel. A 
USB interface is also provided for connection to 
an external computer for data logging and further 
data analysis.
Digital storage oscilloscopes
In recent years digital storage oscilloscopes 
(DSOs) have provided an increasingly cost-
effective alternative to the use of conventional 
analogue CRT-based oscilloscopes. DSOs use 
digital signal processing to capture analogue 
waveforms and save them for later analysis and 
colour liquid crystal displays (LCD) to replace the 
CRT displays fitted to analogue oscilloscopes. The 
result is an instrument that has more in common

so that, for example, a portion of the display can 
be magnified to make fine detail more easily 
visible. The front panel controls and displays of 
a typical low-cost DSO are shown in Fig. 13.38. 
A typical screen grab of a DSO’s LCD display is 
shown in Fig. 13.39.
Basic operation of a DSO
The basic operation of a DSO is extremely 
straightforward and all of the instrument’s 
controls are accessed through a control keypad 
and menu system. It is worth comparing this 
interface with the controls and adjustments 
provided on a conventional analogue oscilloscope 
(see Fig. 13.37).
The settings for data collection or the parameters 
used for the display of any view can be easily 
changed using the instrument’s menu system. 
As with a conventional instrument, the time base 
control is marked in terms of ‘time per division’; 
however, it may also be possible to configure 
a DSO in terms of ‘time per scan’, which may 
make more sense in the case of certain types of 
measurement.
For dual-channel DSOs you can select which 
of the two channels (or both) to display on the 
screen. With two channels, each channel has 
The ability to store waveforms for later analysis 
is extremely valuable as it permits a detailed 
comparison of system performance over time 
(typically before and after a fault condition occurs). 
Digital oscilloscopes can usually also display a 
variety of waveform parameters such as average, 
maximum and r.m.s. values and frequencies of 
repetitive waveforms. In addition, the displayed 
trace can often be manipulated after acquisition

provides waveform storage and digital readout 
of parameters such as voltage and frequency, a 
good CRT-based instrument can often outperform 
a low-cost DSO. In the end the choice is yours, 
but if cash is limited there are two alternative 
solutions, one of which could involve no cash 
outlay at all!
PC with external hardware
The first low-cost alternative to a dedicated DSO 
instrument is that of using external hardware 
(effectively a high-speed, multi-channel ADC) 
connected to a PC via a USB port. The necessary 
DSO software is usually supplied on CD-ROM 
or can be downloaded from the manufacturer’s 
website. It is important to note that although the 
DSO hardware cannot usually be used without the 
appropriate software, some manufacturers supply 
software drivers that will allow you to control the 
DSO and capture data into your own applications. 
However, for most of us this isn’t an option since 
the supplied software will usually outperform 
anything that we can write ourselves!
Several types of external hardware-based DSO 
are currently available. These can be conveniently 
arranged into three different basic categories 
according to their application:
X
X low-cost DSO
X
X high-speed DSO
X
X high-resolution DSO.
Unfortunately, there is often some confusion 
between the last two categories. A high-speed 
DSO is designed for examining waveforms that 
are rapidly changing. Such an instrument does not 
necessarily provide high-resolution measurement. 
Similarly, a high-resolution DSO is useful for 
displaying waveforms with a high degree of 
precision, but it may not be suitable for examining 
fast waveforms. The difference between these 
two types of DSO should become a little clearer 
later on, but first it is worth explaining how the 
sampling rate of a DSO impacts on the frequency 
range over which it can be reliably used.
Sampling rate and bandwidth
The upper signal frequency limit of a DSO is 
determined primarily by the rate at which it can 
a separate axis and each trace and its axis can 
usually be displayed in a different colour (unlike a 
conventional oscilloscope).
Voltage ranges are selected in much the same 
way as for a conventional oscilloscope (i.e. 
in terms of ‘volts per division’), but an auto 
ranging facility may also be included. The auto 
ranging option can be particularly useful if you 
are switching between different, but consistent, 
signals. You may also be able to add custom 
ranges so that the values are displayed in some 
other units, for example pressure or acceleration.
Spectrum analysis
The technique of Fast Fourier Transformation 
(FFT) of the data captured by a DSO makes 
it eminently possible to produce frequency 
spectrum displays. Such displays can be used to 
investigate the harmonic content of waveforms as 
well as the relationship between several signals 
within a composite waveform. This type of display 
is just not possible with a conventional analogue 
oscilloscope, where only voltage/time displays are 
available.
Cost considerations
Today, the cost of an entry-level DSO is 
comparable with that of a good second-hand 
CRT-based analogue oscilloscope and, while 
there is much to be said for an instrument that

d.c. to 50 MHz
The general rule is that for sinusoidal signals the 
bandwidth should ideally be at least double that 
of the highest signal frequency, while for square 
wave and pulse signals the bandwidth should 
be at least ten times that of the highest signal 
frequency.
It is worth noting that most manufacturers define 
the bandwidth of an instrument as the frequency 
at which a sine wave input signal will fall to 0.707 
of its true amplitude (i.e. the −3 dB point). To put 
this into context, at the cut-off frequency any 
displayed trace at the −3 dB point will be in error 
by a whopping 29%!
Resolution and accuracy
The relationship between resolution and signal 
accuracy (not bandwidth) is simply that the more 
bits used in the conversion process the more 
discrete voltage levels can be resolved by the 
DSO. The relationship is as follows:
x = 2n
where x is the number of discrete voltage levels 
and n is the number of bits. Thus, each time we 
use an additional bit in the conversion process 
we double the resolution of the DSO, as shown 
below:
Number of bits, n
Number of discrete voltage 
levels, x
  8-bit
 
256
10-bit
  1,024
12-bit
  4,096
16-bit

DSO stores its captured waveform samples in a 
buffer memory. Hence, for a given sampling rate, 
the size of this memory buffer will determine for 
how long the DSO can capture a signal before 
its buffer memory becomes full. The relationship 
between sampling rate and buffer memory 
capacity is important. A DSO with a high sampling 
rate but small memory will only be able to use its  
full sampling rate on the top few time base ranges. 
To put this into context, it’s worth considering a 
simple example. Assume that we need to display 
10,000 cycles of a 10 MHz square wave. This 
sample an incoming signal. Typical sampling rates 
for different types of DSO are:
In order to display waveforms with reasonable 
accuracy it is normally suggested that the 
sampling rate should be at least twice, and 
preferably more than five times, the highest signal 
frequency. Thus, in order to display a 10 MHz 
signal with any degree of accuracy a sampling rate 
of 50 M samples per second will be required. 
The five times rule merits a little explanation. 
When sampling signals in a digital-to-analogue 
converter we usually apply the Nyquist criterion 
that the sampling frequency must be at least 
twice the highest analogue signal frequency. 
Unfortunately, this no longer applies in the case 
of a DSO, where we need to sample at an even 
faster rate if we are to accurately display the 
signal. In practice we would need a minimum 
of about five points within a single cycle of a 
sampled waveform in order to reproduce it with 
approximate fidelity. Hence the sampling rate 
should be at least five times that of the highest 
signal frequency for a DSO to be able to display a 
waveform reasonably faithfully.
A special case exists with dual-channel DSOs. 
Here the sampling rate may be shared between 
the two channels. Thus an effective sampling 
rate of 20 M samples per second might equate 
to 10 M samples per second for each of the two 
channels. In such a case the upper frequency limit 
would not be 4 MHz but only a mere 2 MHz! 
The approximate bandwidth required to display 
different types of signals with reasonable 
precision is given below:

with the added advantage that captured data 
can be stored for subsequent processing and 
analysis). These instruments have all the features 
associated with a conventional oscilloscope, 
including trigger selection, time base and voltage 
ranges, and an ability to operate in X–Y mode. 
Additional features available with a computer-
based instrument that are not usually available 
from conventional bench-top oscilloscopes include 
the ability to capture transient signals (as with a 
storage oscilloscope) and save waveforms for 
future analysis. The ability to analyse a signal in 
terms of its frequency spectrum is yet another 
feature that is only possible with a DSO. 
Auto ranging is another very useful feature that 
is often provided with a DSO. If you regularly 
use a conventional oscilloscope for a variety of 
measurements you will know only too well how 
many times you need to make adjustments to the 
vertical sensitivity of the instrument. To have this 
adjustment performed for you automatically is an 
absolute boon!
High-resolution DSOs are used for precision 
applications where it is necessary to faithfully 
reproduce a waveform and also to be able to 
perform an accurate analysis of noise floor and 
harmonic content. Typical applications include 
small-signal work and high-quality audio. 
Unlike the low-cost DSOs which typically have 
8-bit resolution and poor d.c. accuracy, high-
resolution DSOs are usually accurate to better 
than 1% and have either 12-bit or 16-bit resolution. 
This makes them ideal for audio, noise and 
vibration measurements. The increased resolution 
also allows the instrument to be used as a 
spectrum analyser with very wide dynamic range 
(up to 100 dB). This feature is ideal for performing 
noise and distortion measurements on low-level 
analogue circuits and high-fidelity equipment 
generally (such as CD and MP3 players).
Bandwidth alone is not enough to ensure that 
a DSO can accurately capture a high-frequency 
signal. The goal of manufacturers is to achieve 
a flat frequency response. This response is 
sometimes referred to as a Maximally Flat 
Envelope Delay (MFED). A frequency response 
of this type delivers excellent pulse fidelity with 
minimum overshoot, undershoot and ringing. 
signal will occur in a time frame of 1 ms. If we 
are applying the five times rule we would need a 
bandwidth of at least 50 MHz to display this signal 
accurately. 
To reconstruct the square wave we would 
need a minimum of about five samples per 
cycle so a minimum sampling rate would be 
5 × 10 MHz = 50 M samples per second. To 
capture data at the rate of 50 M samples per 
second for a time interval of 1 ms  requires a 
memory that can store 50,000 samples. If each 
sample uses 16 bits we would require 100 kbyte 
of extremely fast memory!
The measurement resolution or measurement 
accuracy of a DSO (in terms of the smallest 
voltage change that can be measured) depends 
on the actual range that is selected. So, for 
example, on the 1 V range an 8-bit DSO is able to 
detect a voltage change of one 256th of a volt, or 
1/256 V or about 4 mV. For most measurement 
applications this will prove to be perfectly 
adequate as it amounts to an accuracy of about 
0.4% of full scale. 
Low-cost DSOs are primarily designed for low-
frequency signals (typically signals up to around 
20 kHz) and are usually able to sample their 
signals at rates of between 10 K and 100 K 
samples per second. Resolution is usually limited 
to either 8 or 12 bits (corresponding to 256 and 
4,096 discrete voltage levels, respectively). 
Such instruments may be either single or dual 
channel units and, by virtue of their low cost and 
simplicity, they are ideal for educational purposes 
as well as basic measurements. Most low-cost 
DSOs provide all of the functionality associated 
with a conventional oscilloscope but with many 
additional software-driven features at a fraction 
of the price of a comparable conventional test 
instrument. That said, there are two important 
limitations of low-cost DSOs:
1.	 Their bandwidth is generally limited so they 
are only suitable for examining low-frequency 
and audio signals.
2.	 Their resolution is generally limited to 8 bits or 
256 discrete steps of voltage.
High-speed DSOs are usually dual-channel 
instruments that are designed to replace 
conventional general-purpose oscilloscopes (but 

13 Test equipment and measurements
262
Most DSOs have two different sampling rates 
(modes) depending on the signal being measured: 
real time and equivalent time sampling (ETS) – 
often called repetitive sampling. However, since 
this mode works by building up the waveform 
from successive acquisitions, ETS only works if the  
signal you are measuring is stable and repetitive.
Sound card oscilloscopes
If cash is limited and if you only need to display 
waveforms over a relatively low range of 
frequencies, the most cost-effective solution 
might be that of making use of the sound card 
fitted to a PC. 
Any PC with a standard sound card (or equivalent 
interface integrated with the motherboard) 
It is important to remember that if the input signal 
is not a pure sine wave it will contain a number 
of higher-frequency harmonics. For example, 
a square wave will contain odd harmonics that 
have levels that become progressively reduced 
as their frequency increases. Thus, to display a 
1 kHz square wave accurately you need to take 
into account the fact that there will be signal 
components present at 3 kHz, 5 kHz, 7 kHz, 
9 kHz, 11 kHz and so on. 
As mentioned earlier, it is wise to purchase a 
DSO with a bandwidth that is five times higher 
than the maximum frequency of any signal you 
wish to measure. Note, however, that with 
some instruments the specified bandwidth is not 
available on all voltage ranges, so it is worth  
checking the manufacturer’s specification carefully.

for private (non-commercial) and public educational use. The excellent software will work with any 16-bit

can be used to record and playback analogue 
signals. In order to do this, the sound card 
interface incorporates 16-bit or 24-bit analogue-
to-digital and digital-to-analogue converters (ADC 
and DAC). 
Sound cards can usually be configured for stereo 
or mono operation with either 16 or 24 bits and 
sampling rates of 44.1 kHz (CD quality) up to 192 
kHz. Note that more expensive plug-in (e.g. PCI 
cards) and external (professional quality) sound 
systems can usually achieve higher sample 
rates than those provided by integrated sound 
cards. The stereo capability makes it possible 
to have two independent channels (as with 
most conventional oscilloscopes). In addition, 
the output capability of a PC sound card can be 
used to provide test signals within the audio 
and ­low-frequency spectrum and sound card 
oscilloscope software usually provides this 
function in addition to waveform display of signals 
applied to the stereo input channels.
Sound card oscilloscope limitations
As mentioned earlier, the upper signal frequency 
limit of a DSO is determined primarily by the 
rate at which it can sample an incoming signal. 
Using a maximum sound card sampling rate of 
44.1 kHz, a sinusoidal signal at 20 kHz can be 
displayed with acceptable accuracy (the Nyquist 
criterion). However, in order to display non-
sinusoidal signals faithfully, we need to sample at 
an even faster rate if we are to accurately display 
the signal. In practice we would need a minimum 
of about five points within a single cycle of a 
sampled waveform in order to reproduce it with 
approximate fidelity. Hence the sampling rate 
should be at least five times that of the highest 
signal frequency for a DSO to be able to display 
a waveform with reasonable accuracy. With a 
fixed 44.1 kHz sampling rate this would suggest 
that audio frequency signals of up to 4 kHz will be 
faithfully displayed using a sound card; however, 
it is also necessary to take into account the fact

X
X the usual input impedance of a sound card 
(typically around 50 kΩ) is too low for use with 
conventional oscilloscope probes, which are 
usually designed to work with standard 1 MΩ 
oscilloscope inputs;
X
X the sensitivity of most sound cards varies 
according to software gain settings and the 
size/resolution of PC displays also tends to 
vary widely, hence some method of calibration 
is essential if accurate measurements are to 
be made.
The foregoing limitations can be overcome by 
means of a simple interface of the type shown 
in Fig. 13.43. This circuit incorporates two 
identical channels for the Y1 and Y2 inputs. The 
input signal is fed to a switched potential divider 
attenuator (R10 to R15 and R20 to R25) which has 
a constant input impedance of 1 MΩ. Junction 
gate field effect transistors (TR10 and TR20) are 
connected as unity gain source followers with the 
output voltage developed across the two variable 
gain controls (VR10 and VR20). Capacitors, C10 
and C20, are used to provide d.c. isolation at the 
input while C11 and C21 provide d.c. isolation at 
the output. 
The sound card input interface incorporates its 
own a.c. mains supply, which also provides a 1 V 
peak–peak calibration signal at 50 Hz. Diodes, D1 
and D2, provide full-wave bi-phase rectification 
with an output of approximately 8.5 V appearing 
across the reservoir capacitor, C1. Secondary 
current from T1 is also fed to the anti-parallel 
diode clamp, D3 and D4. A potential divider, R2 
and R3, provides the 1 V peak–peak calibration 
signal, which is applied to the input attenuator 
when switch S2 is set to the ‘calibrate’ position. 
Light emitting diodes, D5 and D6, indicate 
whether S2 the instrument is set to the ‘calibrate’ 
or the ‘operate’ position. If the calibration facilities 
are not required, a 9 V PP3 battery can be used to 
supply the unit. Just connect the battery (in series 
with a suitable on/off switch) across C1. 
Finally, it is important to note that one side of the 
oscilloscope input is connected to ground/earth 
and because of this it is essential to ensure that 
the ground connection is not connected directly 
to any point in a circuit that is at other than true 
ground potential!
that a sound card interface is a.c. coupled and 
therefore is unable to respond to d.c. levels!
Provided you are willing to accept the bandwidth 
limitation (typically 20 Hz to no more than about 
9 kHz with a 44.1 kHz sampling rate) the ability 
to convert an analogue signal into digital stored 
data makes it possible to use a sound card as 
the ADC component of a very basic DSO. With 
the aid of appropriate software (available either 
for free download or at minimal cost) the stored 
data produced by a sound card can be made 
to display on a screen in much the same way 
as it appears on the screen of a conventional 
DSO. Furthermore, the use of Fast Fourier 
Transformation (FFT) software makes it possible 
to produce a frequency domain display as well as 
the more conventional time domain display. 
While it is possible to use a sound card without 
any external interface (most sound cards have 
ample sensitivity so additional gain from a pre-
amplifier stage is unlikely to be required) there are 
several good reasons for using purpose-designed 
probes (see Fig. 13.42) or some other form of 
input interface:
X
X the usual input impedance of a sound card

Procedure
Connect the circuit as shown in Fig. 13.44. With 
the signal generator disconnected, connect the 
d.c. supply and use the digital multimeter on the 
20 V d.c. range to measure the d.c. voltage at the 
junction of R6 and R7. Adjust RV1 so that this 
voltage is exactly half that of the supply (i.e. 8.5 V).
Now remove the link and use the digital 
multimeter set to the 200 mA d.c. range to 
measure the collector current for TR3. Adjust 
RV2 for a current of exactly 24 mA. Repeat these 
two adjustments until no further change is noted. 
Replace the link and set the digital multimeter to 
the 20 V d.c. range. Measure the d.c. voltages 
present at the collector, base and emitter of TR1, 
TR2 and TR3. Also measure the d.c. voltage 
at the anode and cathode of D1. Record your 
measurements in a table.
Connect the AF signal generator to the input 
of the amplifier and set the output to 200 mV 
peak–peak at 1 kHz sine wave. Set the Channel 1 
and Channel 2 inputs of the oscilloscope to 100 
mV/cm with the a.c.-d.c.-ground switches in the 
a.c. position. Set the trigger to internal and the 
timebase to 1 ms/cm. Display the waveforms at 
the input and output of the amplifier and sketch 
these using the layout shown in Fig. 13.45.

Fault finding
Chapter summary
Fault finding is a disciplined and logical process in which ‘trial fixing’ 
should never be contemplated. The generalized process of fault finding 
is illustrated in the flowchart of Fig. 14.1. First you need to verify that the 
equipment really is faulty and that you haven’t overlooked something 
obvious (such as a defective battery or disconnected signal cable). This 
may sound rather obvious but in some cases a fault may simply be 
attributable to maladjustment or misconnection. Furthermore, where 
several items of equipment are connected together, it may not be easy to 
pinpoint the single item of faulty equipment.

14  Fault finding
271
Start fault finding by getting all of the relevant 
information. This process involves asking 
questions such as:
X
X In what circumstances did the circuit fail?
X
X Has the circuit operated correctly before and 
exactly what has changed?
X
X Has the deterioration in performance been 
sudden or progressive?
X
X What fault symptoms do you notice?
The answers to these questions are crucial and, 
once the information has been analysed, the 
next stage involves separating the ‘effects’ from 
the ‘cause’. Here you should list each of the 
possible causes. Once this has been done, you 
should be able to identify and focus upon the 
most probable cause. Corrective action (such as 
component removal and replacement, adjustment 
or alignment) can then be applied before further 
functional checks are carried out. It should then 
be possible to determine whether or not the fault 
has been correctly identified. Note, however, that 
the failure of one component can often result in 
the malfunction or complete failure of another. 
As an example, a short-circuit capacitor will often 
cause a fuse to blow. When the fuse is replaced 
and the supply is reconnected the fuse will once 
again blow because the capacitor is still faulty. 
It is therefore important to consider what other 
problems may be present when a fault is located.
Safety considerations
Before we outline the basic steps for fault finding 
on some simple electronic circuits, it is vitally 
important that you are aware of the potential 
hazards associated with equipment which uses 
high voltages or is operated from the a.c. mains 
supply.
Whereas many electronic circuits operate from 
low-voltage supplies and can thus be handled 
quite safely, the high a.c. voltages present in 
mains operated equipment represent a potentially 
lethal shock hazard. The following general rules 
should always be followed when handling such 
equipment:
1.	 Switch off the mains supply and remove the 
mains power connector whenever any of the 
following tasks are being performed:
	
(a)	 dismantling the equipment
	
(b)	 inspecting fuses
	
(c)	
disconnecting or connecting internal 
modules
	
(d)	 de-soldering or soldering components
	
(e)	 carrying out continuity tests on switches, 
transformer windings, bridge rectifiers, 
etc.

2. When measuring a.c. and d.c. voltages present 
within the power unit take the following 
precautions:
 
(a)  avoid direct contact with incoming mains 
wiring
 
(b)  check that the equipment is connected 
to an effective earth
 
(c) 
use insulated test prods
 
(d)  select appropriate meter ranges before 
attempting to take any measurements
 
(e)  if in any doubt about what you are doing, 
switch off at the mains, disconnect the 
mains connector and think.
Approach to fault finding
Fault finding on most circuits is a relatively 
straightforward process. Furthermore, and 
assuming that the circuit has been correctly 
assembled and wired, there is usually a limited 
number of ‘stock faults’ (such as transistor 
or integrated circuit failure) that can occur. 
To assist in this process, it is a good idea to 
identify a number of test points at which the 
voltages present (both a.c. and d.c.) can be used 
as indicators of the circuit’s functioning. Such 
test points should be identified prior to circuit 
construction and marked with appropriate terminal 
pins.
Readers should note that the most rapid method 
of fault diagnosis is not necessarily that of 
following voltages or signals from one end to the 
other. Most textbooks on fault finding discuss the 
relative methods of the so-called end-to-end and 
half split methods. The former method involves 
tracing the signal and measuring voltages from 
the input to the output (or vice versa) while the 
latter method involves dividing the circuit into 
two halves and then eliminating the half that is 
operational before making a further sub-division of 
the half in which the fault resides.
Transistor faults
As long as a few basic rules can be remembered, 
recognizing the correct voltages present at the 
terminals of a transistor is a fairly simple process. 
The potentials applied to the transistor terminals 
are instrumental in determining the correct bias 
conditions for operation as an amplifier, oscillator 
or switch. If the transistor is defective, the usual 
bias voltages will be substantially changed. 
The functional state of the transistor may thus 
be quickly determined by measuring the d.c. 
potentials present at the transistor’s electrodes 
while it is still in circuit.
The potential developed across the forward-
biased base–emitter junction of a silicon transistor 
is approximately 0.6 V. In the case of an NPN 
transistor, the base will be positive with respect 
to the emitter while, for a PNP transistor, the base 
will be negative with respect to the emitter, as 
shown in Fig. 14.2. The base–emitter voltage drop 
tends to be larger when the transistor is operated 
as a saturated switch (and is in the ‘on’ state) or 
when it is a power type carrying an appreciable 
collector current. In these applications, base–
emitter voltages of between 0.65 V and 0.7 V 
are not unusual. Small-signal amplifiers, on the 
other hand, operate with significantly lower values 
of collector current and values of base–emitter 
voltage in the range 0.55 V to 0.65 V are typical.
A measured base–emitter voltage greatly in 
excess of 0.6 V is an indication of a defective 
transistor with an open-circuit base–emitter 
junction. A measured base–emitter potential very 
much less than 0.6 V indicates that the transistor 
is not being supplied with a base bias and, while 
this may be normal for a switching transistor in 
the ‘off’ state, it is indicative of a circuit fault in 
the case of a linear small-signal amplifier stage. In 
the case of oscillators and medium-high-power r.f. 
amplifiers operating in Class C little or no bias will 
usually be present and, furthermore, the presence 
of r.f. drive during measurement can produce 
Figure 14.2 Base–emitter voltages for NPN and 
PNP silicon transistors

14 Fault finding
273
some very misleading results. In such cases it is 
probably worth removing a transistor suspected 
of being defective and testing it out of circuit.
Unfortunately, it is not so easy to predict the 
voltage present at the collector–base junction of a 
transistor. The junction is invariably reverse biased 
and the potential present will vary considerably 
depending upon the magnitude of collector 
current, supply voltage and circuit conditions. 
As a rule-of-thumb, small-signal amplifiers using 
resistive collector loads usually operate with a 
collector–emitter voltage which is approximately 
half that of the collector supply. The collector–
base voltage will be slightly less than this. Hence, 
for a stage that is operated from a decoupled 
supply rail of, say, 8.5 V a reasonable collector–
base voltage would be somewhere in the range 
3 V to 4 V. Tuned amplifiers having inductive 
collector loads generally operate with a somewhat 
higher value of collector–emitter voltage since 
there is no appreciable direct voltage drop 
across the load. As a result, the collector–base 
voltage drop is greater (a typical value being 6 V). 
Fig. 14.3 shows the electrode potentials normally 
associated with transistors operating as linear 
small-signal amplifiers.
Where a transistor is operated as a saturated 
switch, the junction potentials depend upon 
whether the transistor is in the ‘on’ or ‘off’ state. 
In the ‘off’ condition, the base–emitter voltage will 
be very low (typically 0 V) whereas the collector–
base voltage will be high and, in many cases, 
almost equal to the collector supply voltage. In 
the ‘on’ state, the base–emitter voltage will be 
relatively large (typically 0.7 V) and the collector–
base voltage will fall to a very low value (typically 
0.5 V). It should be noted that, in normal saturated 
switching, the collector–emitter voltage may fall 
to as low as 0.2 V and thus the base–emitter 
voltage will become reversed in polarity (i.e. base 
positive with respect to collector in the case of an 
NPN transistor). The junction potentials associated 
with transistors operating as saturated switches 
are shown in Fig. 14.4.
Transistors may fail in a number of ways. 
Individual junctions may become open-circuit or 
short-circuit. In some cases the entire device may 
become short-circuit or exhibit a very low value of 
Figure 14.4 Typical voltages found in a transistor 
switching circuit (polarities will be reversed in the 
case of a PNP transistor)

internal resistance. The precise nature of the fault 
will usually depend upon the electrical conditions 
prevalent at the time of failure. Excessive reverse 
voltage, for example, is likely to cause a collector–
base or base–emitter junction to become open-
circuit. Momentary excessive collector current 
is likely to rupture the base–emitter junction 
while long-term over-dissipation is likely to cause 
an internal short-circuit or very low-resistance 
condition which may, in some cases, affect all 
three terminals of the device.
In order to illustrate the effects of various 
transistor fault conditions consider the circuit 
of a typical tuned amplifier stage shown in 
Fig. 14.5. The transistor is operated in Class A

current to be drawn from the supply and hence 
the supply voltage falls slightly.
Fault 4
Perhaps the most obvious fault condition is when 
a short-circuit condition affects all three terminals. 
The voltages are, naturally, identical and, as with 
fault 3, more current than usual is taken from the 
supply and, as a consequence, the supply voltage 
falls slightly.
Fault 5
With the base–emitter junction open-circuit, the 
base–emitter voltage rises well above the 0.6 V 
which would normally be expected. No collector 
or emitter current is flowing and thus the collector 
voltage rises, while the emitter voltage falls.
Fault 6
No collector current flows when the collector–
base junction is open-circuit and, as with fault 2, 
the collector voltage rises towards the supply. 
Note that, since the base–emitter junction is 
intact, the normal forward bias of 0.6 V is present 
and this condition distinguishes this fault from 
that described in fault 2.
Integrated circuit faults
Integrated circuits may fail in various ways. 
Occasionally, the manifestation of the fault is 
simply a chip which is chronically overheated –
the judicious application of a finger tip to the 
centre of the plastic package will usually help 
you to identify such a failure. Any chip that is 
noticeably hotter than others of a similar type 
should be considered suspect. Where integrated 
circuits are fitted in sockets, it will be eminently 
possible to remove and replace them with 
known functional devices (but do remember to 
switch ‘off’ and disconnect the supply during the 
process).
In the case of digital circuitry, the task of 
identifying a logic gate which is failing to perform 
its logical function can be accomplished by various 
means but the simplest and most expedient 
is with the aid of a logic probe (see page 279). 
with conventional base bias potential divider 
and a tuned transformer collector load. Normal 
working voltages are shown in the circuit diagram. 
Note that the junction potentials (0.6 V and 
4.7 V for the base–emitter and collector–base 
junctions, respectively) are in agreement with the 
voltages given in Fig. 14.4. The circuit voltages 
corresponding to six different transistor fault 
conditions are shown in Table 14.1.
Each fault will now be discussed individually.
Fault 1
The collector–base short-circuit gives rise to 
identical base and collector voltage. The base–
emitter junction is still intact and thus the normal 
forward voltage drop of 0.6 V is present. In this 
condition a relatively high value of current is 
drawn by the stage and thus the supply voltage 
falls slightly.
Fault 2
The base–emitter short-circuit produces identical 
base and emitter voltages. No collector current 
flows and the collector voltage rises to almost the 
full supply voltage. The base and emitter voltages 
are relatively low since the emitter resistor 
effectively appears in parallel with the lower 
section of the base bias potential divider, thus 
pulling the base voltage down.
Fault 3
Identical voltages at the collector and emitter 
result from a collector–emitter short-circuit. The 
emitter voltage rises above the base voltage and 
the base–emitter junction is well and truly turned 
off. The short-circuit causes a higher value of

Conversely, if the voltage at the inverting input is 
negative with respect to that at the non-inverting 
input, the output voltage will be high (positive if 
the operational amplifier is operating from a dual 
supply). 
Finally, if both inputs are at 0 V and there is 
virtually no difference in the input voltages, the 
output should also be close to 0 V. If it is high 
or low (or sitting at one or other of the supply 
voltages) the device should be considered suspect.
The detection of faults within other linear 
integrated circuits can be rather more difficult. 
However, a good starting point is that of 
disconnecting the supply and inserting a meter 
to determine the supply current under quiescent 
conditions. The value should be compared with 
that given by the manufacturer as ‘typical’. Where 
there is a substantial deviation from this figure the 
device (or its immediate circuitry) should be 
considered suspect.
Diode testing
Go/no-go checks provide you with a very 
rapid method of assessing whether a junction 
semiconductor device, such as a diode or bipolar 
transistor, is functional. The basic principle is 
simply that of checking the forward and reverse 
resistance of each P–N junction that may be 
present. The source of current for the resistance 
checks is simply the internal battery in your 
analogue multimeter.
Fig. 14.6 shows the simplified internal circuit of 
an analogue multimeter on the resistance (ohms) 
range. This circuit consists of a battery (usually  
1.5 V, 3 V, 4.5 V or 9 V) connected in series with 
a preset ‘set-zero ohms’ control and a fixed, 
current-limiting resistor, and a sensitive moving 
coil meter movement. There is one important 
thing to note from this arrangement and it relates 
to the polarity of the meter leads – the red meter 
test lead will have a negative polarity while the 
black meter test lead will exhibit a positive polarity 
when the instrument is switched to the ‘ohms’ 
range. (Note that the same does not apply to 
digital multimeters). 
Unfortunately, simple go/no-go checks are 
unreliable when using a digital multimeter. 
This invaluable tool comprises a hand-held probe 
fitted with LEDs to indicate the logical state of its 
probe tip. 
In use, the logic probe is moved from point to 
point within a logic circuit and the state of each 
node is noted and compared with the expected 
logic level. In order to carry out checks on more 
complex logic arrangements a logic pulser may 
be used in conjunction with the logic probe. The 
pulser provides a means of momentarily changing 
the state of a node (regardless of its actual state) 
and thus permits, for example, the clocking of a 
bistable element (see page 193).
Operational amplifiers can usually be checked 
using simple d.c. voltage measurements. The 
d.c. voltages appearing at the inverting and non-
inverting inputs should be accurately measured 
and compared. Where the voltage at the inverting 
input is more positive with respect to that at the 
non-inverting input, the output voltage will be high 
(positive if the operational amplifier is operated 
from a dual supply rail).

various transistor faults on the d.c. voltages

side is connected to the cathode, the diode under 
test is forward-biased, and the ohmmeter will 
indicate a low-resistance reading. When the leads 
are reversed, the diode will be reverse-biased, and 
the ohmmeter indicates a very high, or infinite, 
resistance. The ohmmeter should be switched to 
one of the middle resistance ranges (×10, ×100 
or ×1 k) for testing diodes.
A zener diode may usually be tested in the same 
manner as is a general-purpose diode. If it tests 
the same as does a general-purpose diode, it is 
probably good. However, the most rapid method 
of checking a zener diode is to apply power to 
the circuit it is used in and measure the voltage 
across it. If this voltage reading is the correct 
zener voltage (as rated by the manufacturer), the 
zener is good. If the voltage across the zener is 
incorrect, either the supply to the zener is low, or 
not present, or the zener itself has failed.
Typical meter indications for silicon diodes 
are shown in Fig. 14.7 (forward bias is applied 
in Fig. 14.7(a) and reverse bias is applied in 
Fig. 14.7(b)). Corresponding indications for 
germanium diodes will be somewhat lower than 
those shown for silicon diodes.
Encapsulated bridge rectifiers are supplied with 
all four diode connections accessible. It is thus 
possible to check each individual diode for both 
forward and reverse resistance. It is also possible 
to check that the bridge as a whole is neither 
short-circuited nor open-circuited.
Indeed, some instruments sometimes fail to 
provide any meaningful indication when carrying 
out resistance checks on diodes and transistors! 
However, if you have a more sophisticated 
digital instrument, you may find that it already 
has a built-in diode or transistor checker – in 
which case you should use this facility to make 
measurements rather than attempt to use 
simple go/no-go checking based on resistance 
measurements.
Because the output of the analogue multimeter 
is polarity conscious, it can be used to check 
the ability of a component to conduct in both 
directions. Thus it can, for example, be used to 
distinguish between a resistor and a diode. The 
former will exhibit the same resistance whichever 
way it is connected to the multimeter. The diode, 
on the other hand, will have a resistance which 
will vary significantly depending upon which way 
round it is connected.

Fig. 14.10. For an NPN transistor this is achieved 
by measuring the resistance between collector 
and emitter, as shown in Fig. 14.10(a), before 
applying a small amount of base current via a 
100 kΩ resistor, as shown in Fig. 14.10(b). The 
application of base current should have the effect 
of producing a significant increase in collector 
current and this, in turn, will result in a much 
Bipolar transistor ‘go/no-go’ 
checks
Typical meter indications for silicon NPN 
transistors are shown in Fig. 14.8 (reverse bias is 
applied in Fig. 14.8(a) and forward bias is applied 
in Fig. 14.8(b)). Corresponding indications for 
germanium NPN transistors will be somewhat 
lower. Note also that the ×100 resistance range 
should be used for measurements below 20 kΩ, 
and the ×1 k resistance range should be used for 
measurements above 20 kΩ.
Typical meter indications for silicon PNP 
transistors are shown in Fig. 14.9 (forward 
bias is applied in Fig. 14.9(a) and reverse 
bias is applied in Fig. 14.9(b)). As for NPN 
transistors, corresponding indications for 
germanium PNP will be somewhat lower. 
Once again, the ×100 resistance range should 
be used for measurements below 20 kΩ, and 
the ×1 k resistance range should be used for 
measurements above 20 kΩ.
Bipolar transistor current gain 
checks
Simple go/no-go checks can also be used to 
determine whether a transistor is providing 
current gain. The principle is illustrated in

Logic circuit faults
While multimeters can be used for checking the 
voltages present on the supply rails within digital 
logic circuits they are generally unsuitable for 
measuring the logic states of the points or nodes 
within a circuit. There are several reasons for this, 
including the fact that logic states are represented 
by voltage levels that vary according to the 
integrated circuit technology employed. However, 
the principal reason for misleading indications is 
that the logic levels can be rapidly changing or 
may take the form of short-duration pulses that 
simply cannot be detected by a conventional 
voltage measuring instrument. That said, where 
logic levels do remain static for periods of several 
seconds, a multimeter may be used on the d.c. 
voltage ranges to detect the presence of either 
a logic 0 or logic 1 state. In the case of standard 
TTL devices (which operate from a +5 V supply) 
the following voltage levels apply:
reduced resistance measured between the 
collector and emitter. It is, of course, not possible 
to provide an accurate indication of current gain 
by this method; however, it will tell you whether 
or not a transistor is producing current gain. The 
method will also let you compare the current 
gain of one (known) transistor with another. 
The equivalent arrangement for testing a PNP 
transistor is shown in Fig. 14.11. 
A transistor/diode checker
A simple transistor/diode checker can make an 
excellent project for the beginner to electronic 
circuit construction. The instrument shown in 
Fig. 14.14 measures current gain for NPN and 
PNP transistors up to 1,000 and leakage current 
up to 100 µA. It also has a diode check facility 
which can be useful for rapid testing of signal, 
rectifier and zener diodes. The values of R1, R2 
and R3 can be made from series combinations 
of preferred value resistors (for example, R2 can 
be made from a 150 kΩ resistor connected in 
series with an 18 kΩ resistor) while the meter 
shunt resistor, R5, should be calculated in order 
to provide a full-scale deflection on the meter of 
10 mA whenever any of the current gain ranges 
are selected (see page 279). Typical front panel 
layouts and meter scales are shown in Figs 14.12 
and 14.13.

Logic probes
The simplest, and by far the most convenient, 
method of tracing logic states involves the use 
of a logic probe. This invaluable tool comprises a 
compact hand-held probe fitted with LEDs that 
indicate the logical state of its probe tip.
Unlike multi-range meters, logic probes can 
distinguish between lines which are actively 
pulsing and those which are in a permanently 
tri-state condition. In the case of a line which is 
being pulsed, the logic 0 and logic 1 indicators will 
both be illuminated (though not necessarily with 
the same brightness) whereas, in the case of a tri-
state line neither indicator should be illuminated.
Logic probes usually also provide a means of 
displaying pulses having a very short duration 
which may otherwise go undetected. This 
is accomplished by the inclusion of a pulse

It should be noted that an ‘indeterminate’ logic 
level may result from a tri-state condition where 
several logic devices place their outputs on a 
shared signal (or bus) line. To prevent a conflict 
occuring between the devices, the outputs of any 
inactive devices are placed in a high-impedance 
state in which the voltage at the output can 
safely take any value within the logic range 
without causing damage to the inactive device. 
Modern high-impedance instruments will usually 
produce a misleading fluctuating indication in 
such circumstances and this can sometimes be 
confused with nodes that are actually pulsing.

Logic probes invariably derive their power supply 
from the circuit under test and are connected 
by means of a short length of twin flex fitted 
with insulated crocodile clips. While almost any 
convenient connecting point may be used, the 
positive supply and ground terminals make ideal 
connecting points which can be easily identified.
A typical logic probe circuit is shown in Fig. 14.16. 
This circuit uses a dual comparator to sense the 
logic 0 and logic 1 levels and a timer that acts 
as a monostable pulse stretcher to indicate 
the presence of a pulse input rather than a 
continuous logic 0 or logic 1 condition. Typical 
logic probe indications and waveforms are shown 
in Fig. 14.18.
Fig. 14.19 shows how a logic probe can be 
used to check a typical combinational logic 
arrangement. In use, the probe is simply moved 
from node to node and the logic level is displayed 
and compared with the expected level.
Logic pulsers
We sometimes need to simulate the logic levels 
generated by a peripheral device or a sensor. A 
permanent logic level can easily be generated 
by pulling a line up to +5 V via a 1 kΩ resistor or 
by temporarily tying a line to 0 V. However, on 
other occasions you may need to simulate a pulse 
rather than a permanent logic state and this can 
be achieved by means of a logic pulser.
A logic pulser provides a means of momentarily 
forcing a logic level transition into a circuit 
regardless of its current state and thus it 
overcomes the need to disconnect or de-solder 
any of the devices. The polarity of the pulse 
(produced at the touch of a button) is adjusted so 
that the node under investigation is momentarily 
forced into the opposite logical state. During the 
period before the button is depressed and for 
the period after the pulse has been completed, 
the probe tip adopts a tri-state (high impedance) 
condition. Hence the probe does not permanently 
affect the logical state of the point in question.
Logic pulsers derive their power supply from the 
circuit under test in the same manner as logic 
probes. Here again, the supply and ground 
stretching circuit (i.e. a monostable). This 
elongates short-duration pulses so that a visible 
indication is produced on a separate ‘pulse’ LED.

Fig. 14.21 shows an example of the combined 
use of a logic probe and a logic pulser for testing 
a simple J–K bistable. The logic probe is used 
to check the initial state of the bistable outputs 
(see Fig. 14.21(a) and (b)). Note that the outputs 
should be complementary. Next, the logic pulser 
is applied to the clock (CK) input of the bistable 
(Fig. 14.21(c)) and the Q output is checked using 
the logic probe. The application of a pulse (using 
the trigger button) should cause the Q output of 
the bistable to change state (see Fig. 14.21(d)).

CHAPTER15
Sensors and interfacing
Chapter summary
Sensors provide us with a means of generating signals that can be used 
as inputs to electronic circuits. The things that we might want to sense 
include physical parameters such as temperature, light level and pressure. 
Being able to generate an electrical signal that accurately represents these 
quantities allows us not only to measure and record these values but also 
to control them.
Sensors are, in fact, a subset of a larger family of devices known as 
transducers so we will consider these before we look at sensors and how 
we condition the signals that they produce in greater detail. We begin, 
however, with a brief introduction to the instrumentation and control 
systems in which sensors, transducers and signal conditioning circuits are 
used.

Instrumentation and control 
systems
Fig. 15.1 shows the arrangement of an 
instrumentation system. The physical quantity 
to be measured (e.g. temperature) acts upon 
a sensor that produces an electrical output 
signal. This signal is an electrical analogue of the 
physical input but note that there may not be a 
linear relationship between the physical quantity 
and its electrical equivalent. Because of this 
and since the output produced by the sensor 
may be small or may suffer from the presence 
of noise (i.e. unwanted signals) further signal 
conditioning will be required before the signal will 
be at an acceptable level and in an acceptable 
form for signal processing, display and recording. 
Furthermore, because the signal processing 
may use digital rather than analogue signals 
an additional stage of analogue-to-analogue 
conversion may be required. 
Fig. 15.1(b) shows the arrangement of a control 
system. This uses negative feedback in order 
to regulate and stabilize the output. It thus 
becomes possible to set the input or demand 
(i.e. what we desire the output to be) and leave 
the system to regulate itself by comparing it with 
a signal derived from the output (via a sensor and 
appropriate signal conditioning).
A comparator is used to sense the difference 
in these two signals and where any discrepancy 
is detected the input to the power amplifier is 
adjusted accordingly. This signal is referred to as 
an error signal (it should be zero when the output 
exactly matches the demand). The input (demand) 
is often derived from a simple potentiometer 
connected across a stable d.c. voltage source 
while the controlled device can take many forms 
(e.g. a d.c. motor, linear actuator, heater, etc.).
Transducers
Transducers are devices that convert energy 
in the form of sound, light, heat, etc., into an 
equivalent electrical signal, or vice versa. 
Before we go further, let’s consider a couple of 
examples that you will already be familiar with. 
A loudspeaker is a transducer that converts low-
frequency electric current into audible sounds. A 
microphone, on the other hand, is a transducer 
that performs the reverse function, i.e. that of 
Figure 15.1 Instrumentation and control systems

15  Sensors and interfacing
287
converting sound pressure variations into voltage 
or current. Loudspeakers and microphones 
can thus be considered as complementary 
transducers. 
Transducers may be used both as inputs to 
electronic circuits and outputs from them. From 
the two previous examples, it should be obvious 
that a loudspeaker is an output transducer 
designed for use in conjunction with an audio 
system. A microphone is an input transducer 
designed for use with a recording or sound 
reinforcing system.
There are many different types of transducer and 
Tables 15.1 and 15.2 provide some examples 
of transducers that can be used to input and 
output three important physical quantities; sound, 
temperature and angular position.
Sensors
A sensor is a special kind of transducer 
that is used to generate an input signal to a 
measurement, instrumentation or control system. 
The signal produced by a sensor is an electrical 
analogy of a physical quantity, such as distance, 
velocity, acceleration, temperature, pressure, light 
level, etc. The signals returned from a sensor, 
together with control inputs from the user or 
controller (as appropriate) will subsequently be 
used to determine the output from the system. 
The choice of sensor is governed by a number of 
factors including accuracy, resolution, cost and 
physical size.
Sensors can be categorized as either active or 
passive. An active sensor generates a current or 
voltage output. A passive transducer requires a 
source of current or voltage and it modifies this 
in some way (e.g. by virtue of a change in the 
sensor’s resistance). The result may still be a 
voltage or current but it is not generated by the 
sensor on its own.
Sensors can also be classed as either digital or 
analogue. The output of a digital sensor can exist 
in only two discrete states, either ‘on’ or ‘off’,

Switches
Switches can be readily interfaced to electronic 
circuits in order to provide manual inputs to the 
system. Simple toggle and push-button switches 
are generally available with normally open (NO), 
normally closed (NC) or changeover contacts. In 
the latter case, the switch may be configured as 
either an NO or an NC type, depending upon the 
connections used.
Toggle, lever, rocker, rotary, slide and push-button 
types are all commonly available in a variety of 
styles. Illuminated switches and key switches are 
also available for special applications. The choice 
of switch type will obviously depend upon the 
application and operational environment.
An NO switch or push-button may be interfaced 
to a logic circuit using nothing more than a single 
pull-up resistor as shown in Fig. 15.11.
The relevant bit of the input will then return 0 
when the switch contacts are closed (i.e. when 
the switch is operated or where the push-button 
is depressed). When the switch is inactive, the 
logic input will return 1.
Unfortunately, this simple method of interfacing 
has a limitation when the state of a switch is 
being sensed regularly (e.g. during program 
execution). However, a typical application which 
is unaffected by this problem is that of using 
one or more PCB-mounted switches (e.g. a DIL 
switch package) to configure a logic system 
in one of a number of preset modes. In such 
cases, the switches would be set once only 
and the software would read the state of the 
Figure 15.10 Contactless joystick

or push-button to a digital input port
Figure 15.12 Interfacing a DIL switch input to a 
digital input port
switches and use the values returned to initially 
configure the system. Thereafter, the state of the 
switches would then only be changed in order to 
modify the operational parameters of the system 
(e.g. when changing input sensors or output 
transducers). A typical DIL switch input interface 
to a digital input port is shown in Fig. 15.12.
As mentioned earlier, the simple circuit of 
Fig. 15.11 is unsuitable for use when the state of 
the switch is regularly changing. The reason for 
this is that the switching action of most switches 
is far from ‘clean’ (i.e. the switch contacts make 
and break several times whenever the switch is 
operated). This may not be a problem when the 
state of a switch remains static during program 
execution but it can give rise to serious problems 
when dealing with, for example, an operator 
switch bank or keypad.

The contact ‘bounce’ that occurs when a switch 
is operated results in rapid making and breaking 
of the switch until it settles into its new state. 
Fig. 15.13 shows the waveform generated by the 
simple switch input circuit of Fig. 15.11 as the 
contacts close. The spurious states can cause 
problems if the switch is sensed during the 
period in which the switch contacts are in motion, 
and hence steps must be taken to minimize the 
effects of bounce. This may be achieved by using 
some extra circuitry in the form of a debounce 
circuit or by including appropriate software delays 
(of typically 4 to 20 ms) so that spurious switching 
states are ignored. We shall discuss these two 
techniques separately.
Immunity to transient switching states is generally 
enhanced by the use of active-low inputs (i.e. 
a logic 0 state at the input is used to assert the 
condition required). The debounce circuit shown 
in Fig. 15.14 is adequate for most toggle, slide 
and push-button type switches. The value of the 
100 Ω resistor takes into account the low-state 
sink current required by IC1 (normally 1.6 mA for 
standard TTL and 400 μA for LS-TTL). This resistor 
should not be allowed to exceed approximately 
470 Ω in order to maintain a valid logic 0 input 
state. The values quoted generate an approximate 
1 ms delay (during which the switch contacts will 
have settled into their final state). It should be 
noted that, on power-up, this circuit generates a 
logic 1 level for approximately 1 ms before the 
output reverts to a logic 0 in the inactive state. 
The circuit obeys the following state table:
Switch condition

An alternative, but somewhat more complex, 
switch debouncing arrangement is shown in 
Fig. 15.15. Here a single-pole double-throw 
(SPDT) changeover switch is employed. This 
arrangement has the advantage of providing 
complementary outputs and it obeys the following 
state table:

bistable
Rather than use an integrated circuit R–S bistable 
in the configuration of Fig. 15.15 it is often 
expedient to make use of ‘spare’ two-input NAND 
or NOR gates arranged to form bistables using 
the circuits shown in Figs 15.16(a) and 15.16(b), 
respectively. Fig. 15.17 shows a rather neat 
extension of this theme in the form of a touch-
operated switch. This arrangement is based on a 
4011 CMOS quad two-input NAND gate (though 
only two gates of the package are actually used in 
this particular configuration).
Finally, it is sometimes necessary to generate a 
latching action from a NO push-button switch. 
Fig. 15.18 shows an arrangement in which a 
74LS73 JK bistable is clocked from the output of 
a debounced switch.

Pressing the switch causes the bistable to change 
state. The bistable then remains in that state 
until the switch is depressed a second time. If 
desired, the complementary outputs provided 
by the bistable may be used to good effect by 
allowing the unused output to drive an LED. This 
will become illuminated whenever the Q output is 
high.
Semiconductor temperature 
sensors
Semiconductor temperature sensors are ideal for 
a wide range of temperature-sensing applications. 
The popular AD590 semiconductor temperature 
sensor, for example, produces an output current 
which is proportional to absolute temperature 
and which increases at the rate of 1 μA/K. 
The characteristic of the device is illustrated

order to minimize errors, it is usually necessary 
to connect thermocouples to appropriate 
signal conditioning using compensated cables 
and matching connectors. Such cables and 
connectors are available from a variety of 
suppliers and are usually specified for use with 
type K thermocouples. A selection of typical 
thermocouple probes for high temperature 
measurement was shown earlier in Fig. 15.2.
Threshold detection
Analogue sensors are sometimes used in 
situations where it is only necessary to respond 
to a pre-determined threshold value. In effect, a 
two-state digital output is required. In such cases 
a simple one-bit analogue-to-digital converter 
based on a comparator can be used. Such an 
arrangement is, of course, very much simpler 
and more cost-effective than making use of a 
conventional analogue input port!
Simple threshold detectors for light level and 
temperature are shown in Figs 15.21, 15.22 and 
15.24. These circuits produce TTL-compatible 
outputs suitable for direct connection to a logic 
circuit or digital input port.
Fig. 15.21 shows a light-level threshold detector 
based on a comparator and light-dependent 
resistor (LDR). This arrangement generates a 
logic 0 input whenever the light level exceeds 
the threshold setting, and vice versa. Fig. 15.22 
shows how light level can be sensed using a 
in Fig. 15.19. The AD590 is laser trimmed to 
produce a current of 298.2 μA (±2.5 μA) at a 
temperature of 298.2 K (i.e. 25 °C). A typical 
interface between the AD590 and an analogue 
input is shown in Fig. 15.20. The Practical 
Investigation (page 299) makes further use of this 
device.
Thermocouples
Thermocouples comprise a junction of dissimilar 
metals which generate an e.m.f. proportional to 
the temperature differential which exists between 
the measuring junction and a reference junction. 
Since the measuring junction is usually at a 
greater temperature than that of the reference 
junction, it is sometimes referred to as the hot 
junction. Furthermore, the reference junction 
(i.e. the cold junction) is often omitted, in which 
case the sensing junction is simply terminated 
at the signal conditioning board. This board is 
usually maintained at, or near, normal room 
temperatures.
Thermocouples are suitable for use over 
a very wide range of temperatures (from 
−100 °C to +1,100 °C). Industry standard ‘type 
K’ thermocouples comprise a positive arm 
(conventionally coloured brown) manufactured 
from nickel/chromium alloy while the 
negative arm (conventionally coloured blue) is 
manufactured from nickel/aluminium.
The characteristic of a type K thermocouple is 
defined in BS 4937 Part 4 of 1973 (International 
Thermocouple Reference Tables) and this 
standard gives tables of e.m.f. versus 
temperature over the range 0 °C to +1,100 °C. In

the BPX48 can also be supplied with an integral 
daylight filter (BPX48F).
Fig. 15.24 shows how temperature thresholds 
can be sensed using the AD590 sensor described 
earlier. This arrangement generates a logic 0 input 
whenever the temperature level exceeds the 
threshold setting, and vice versa.
Outputs
Having dealt at some length with input sensors, 
we shall now focus our attention on output 
devices (such as relays, loudspeakers and LED 
indicators) and the methods used for interfacing 
them. Integrated circuit output drivers are 
available for more complex devices, such as 
LCD displays and stepper motors. Many simple 
applications will, however, only require a handful 
of components in order to provide an effective 
interface.
LED indicators
Indicators based on light-emitting diodes (LEDs) 
are inherently more reliable than small-filament 
lamps and also consume considerably less power. 
They are thus ideal for providing visual status and 
warning displays. LEDs are available in a variety of 
styles and colours and ‘high brightness’ types can 
be employed where high-intensity displays are 
required.
photodiode. This circuit behaves in the same 
manner as the LDR equivalent but it is important 
to be aware that circuit achieves peak sensitivity 
in the near infra-red region. Fig. 15.23 shows 
how the spectral response of a typical light-
dependent resistor (NORP12) compares with that 
of a conventional photodiode (BPX48). Note that

I/O ports, external circuitry will normally be 
required to drive anything other than the most 
modest of loads. Fig. 15.27 shows some typical 
arrangements for operating various types of 
medium- and high-current load. Fig. 15.27(a) 
shows how an NPN transistor can be used to 
operate a low-power relay. Where the relay 
requires an appreciable operating current 
(say, 150 mA or more), a plastic encapsulated 
Darlington power transistor should be used as 
shown in Fig. 15.27(b). Alternatively, a power 
MOSFET may be preferred, as shown in 
Fig. 15.27(c). Such devices offer very low values 
of ’on’ resistance coupled with a very high ‘off’ 
resistance. Furthermore, unlike conventional 
bipolar transistors, a power FET will impose 
a negligible load on an I/O port. Fig. 15.27(d) 
shows a filament lamp driver based on a plastic 
Darlington power transistor. This circuit will drive 
lamps rated at up to 24 V, 500 mA. Finally, where 
visual indication of the state of a relay is desirable 
it is a simple matter to add an LED indicator to the 
driver stage, as shown in Fig. 15.28.
Audible outputs
Where simple audible warnings are required, 
miniature piezoelectric transducers may be used. 
Such devices operate at low voltages (typically in 
the range 3 V to 15 V) and can be interfaced with 
the aid of a buffer, open-collector logic gate or 
transistor. Figs 15.29(a)–(c) show typical interface 
circuits which produce an audible output when 
the port output line is at logic 1.
Where a pulsed rather than continuous audible 
alarm is required, a circuit of the type shown in 
A typical red LED requires a current of around 
10 mA to provide a reasonably bright display 
and such a device may be directly driven from a 
buffered digital output port. Different connections 
are used depending upon whether the LED is to 
be illuminated for a logic 0 or logic 1 state. Several 
possibilities are shown in Fig. 15.25.
Where drive current is insufficient to operate an 
LED, an auxiliary transistor can be used as shown 
in Fig. 15.26. The LED will operate when the 
output from a logic circuit card is taken to logic 1 
and the operating current should be approximately 
15 mA (thereby providing a brighter display than 
the arrangements previously described). The 
value of LED series resistance will be dependent 
upon the supply voltage and can be determined 
from the equation shown on page 97 or it can be 
selected from the data shown in Table 15.4.

Finally, the circuit shown in Fig. 15.32 can be used 
where a conventional moving-coil loudspeaker 
is to be used in preference to a piezoelectric 
transducer. This circuit is again based on the 
555 timer and provides a continuous output at 
approximately 1 kHz whenever the port output is 
at logic 1.
Motors
Circuit arrangements used for driving d.c. 
motors generally follow the same lines as those 
described earlier for use with relays. As an 
example, the circuits shown in Fig. 15.30 show 
how a Darlington driver and a power MOSFET can 
be used to drive a low-voltage d.c. motor. These 
circuits are suitable for use with d.c. motors rated 
at up to 12 V with stalled currents of up to 3 A. 
In both cases, a logic 1 from the output port will 
operate the motor.

pulsed audio output.

Driving mains-connected loads
Control systems are often used in conjunction 
with mains-connected loads. Modern solid-state 
relays (SSRs) offer superior performance and 
reliability when compared with conventional relays 
in such applications. SSRs are available in a variety 
of encapsulations (including DIL, SIL, flat-pack and

are shown in Fig. 15.33. Finally, it is important 
to note that, when an inductive load is to be 
controlled, a snubber network should be fitted, 
as shown in Fig. 15.34.

Objective
To investigate the operation of an AD590 
semiconductor temperature sensor and its 
interface/signal conditioning circuit.
Components and test equipment
Breadboard, d.c. power supply with ±5 V output 
at 100 mA (or more), 10 kΩ linear variable resistor 
(preferably multi-turn type), fixed resistors of 
10 kΩ (two required) and 100 kΩ 0.25 W 5%, 
AD590 temperature sensor, TL081 operational 
amplifier, digital multimeter, thermometer, test 
leads and probes, small hand-held hair drier.

Connect the circuit, set VR1 to mid-position, and 
measure the output voltage produced by the 
circuit. Adjust VR1 for an output voltage reading 
of exactly zero at a temperature of 20 °C. Place 
the temperature sensor in close proximity to the 
thermometer in the air flow from the hair drier.

between 1 A and 40 A.
In order to provide a high degree of isolation 
between input and output, SSRs are optically 
coupled. Such devices require minimal input 
currents (typically 5 mA or so when driven from 
5 V) and they can thus be readily interfaced with 
an I/O port that offers sufficient drive current. 
In other cases, it may be necessary to drive 
the SSR from an unbuffered I/O port using an

Circuit simulation
Chapter summary
Computer simulation provides you with a powerful and cost-effective tool 
for designing, simulating and analysing a wide variety of electronic circuits. 
In recent years, the computer software packages designed for this task 
have not only become increasingly sophisticated but also have become 
increasingly easy to use. Furthermore, several of the most powerful and 
popular packages are now available at low cost either in evaluation, ‘lite’ 
or student versions. In addition, there are several excellent freeware and 
shareware packages (see Appendix 9).

Whereas early electronic simulation software 
required that circuits were entered using 
a complex netlist that described all of the 
components and connections present in a 
circuit, most modern packages use an on-screen 
graphical representation of the circuit on test. 
This, in turn, generates a netlist (or its equivalent) 
for submission to the computational engine 
that actually performs the circuit analysis using 
mathematical models and algorithms. In order 
to describe the characteristics and behaviour 
of components such as diodes and transistors, 
manufacturers often provide models in the form 
of a standard list of parameters.
Most programs that simulate electronic circuits 
use a set of algorithms that describe the 
behaviour of electronic components. The most 
commonly used algorithm was developed at 
the Berkeley Institute in the United States and 
it is known as SPICE (Simulation Program with 
Integrated Circuit Emphasis). 
Results of circuit analysis can be displayed in 
various ways, including displays that simulate 
those of real test instruments (these are 
sometimes referred to as virtual instruments). 
A further benefit of using electronic circuit 
simulation software is that, when a circuit design 
has been finalized, it is usually possible to export a 
file from the design/simulation software to a PCB 
layout package. It may also be possible to export 
files for use in screen printing or CNC drilling. This 
greatly reduces the time that it takes to produce a 
finished electronic circuit.
Types of analysis
Various types of analysis are available within 
modern SPICE-based circuit simulation packages 
(see Appendix 9). These usually include:
D.C. analysis
D.C. analysis determines the d.c. operating 
point of the circuit under investigation. In this 
mode any wound components (e.g. inductors 
and transformers) are short-circuited and 
any capacitors that may be present are left

open-circuit. In order to determine the initial 
conditions, a d.c. analysis is usually automatically 
performed prior to a transient analysis. It is also 
usually performed prior to an a.c. small-signal 
analysis in order to obtain the linearized, small-
signal models for non-linear devices. Furthermore, 
if specified, the d.c. small-signal value of a 
transfer function (ratio of output variable to input 
source), input resistance, and output resistance is 
also computed as a part of the d.c. solution. The 
d.c. analysis can also be used to generate d.c. 
transfer curves in which a specified independent 
voltage or current source is stepped over a user-
specified range and the d.c. output variables are 
stored for each sequential source value.

A.C. small-signal analysis
The a.c. small-signal analysis feature of SPICE 
software computes the a.c. output variables 
as a function of frequency. The program first 
computes the d.c. operating point of the circuit 
and determines linearized, small-signal models 
for all of the non-linear devices in the circuit 
(e.g. diodes and transistors). The resultant linear 
circuit is then analysed over a user-specified 
range of frequencies. The desired output of

a function of time over a user-specified time 
interval. The initial conditions are automatically 
determined by a d.c. analysis. All sources that are 
not time dependent (for example, power supplies) 
are set to their d.c. value. 
Pole-zero analysis
The pole-zero analysis facility computes the 
poles and/or zeros in the small-signal a.c. 
transfer function. The program first computes 
the d.c. operating point and then determines the 
linearized, small-signal models for all the non-
linear devices in the circuit. This circuit is then 
used to find the poles and zeros of the transfer 
function.
Two types of transfer functions are usually 
supported. One of these determines the voltage 
transfer function (i.e. output voltage divided by 
input voltage) and the other usually computes 
the output transimpedance (i.e. output voltage 
divided by input current) or transconductance 
(i.e. output current divided by input voltage). 
These two transfer functions cover all the cases 
and one can make it possible to determine the 
poles/zeros of functions like impedance ratio (i.e. 
input impedance divided by output impedance) 
and voltage gain. The input and output ports are 
specified as two pairs of nodes. Note that, for 
an a.c. small-signal analysis is usually a transfer 
function (voltage gain, transimpedance, etc.). If 
the circuit has only one a.c. input, it is convenient 
to set that input to unity and zero phase, so 
that output variables have the same value as 
the transfer function of the output variable with 
respect to the input.
Transient analysis
The transient analysis feature of a SPICE package 
computes the transient output variables as

analysed using the Tina Pro package

third harmonics are determined at every point in 
the circuit. If there are signals of two frequencies 
input to the circuit, the analysis finds out the 
complex values of the circuit variables at the sum 
and difference of the input frequencies, and at 
the difference of the smaller frequency from the 
second harmonic of the larger frequency.
Sensitivity analysis
Sensitivity analysis allows you to determine 
either the d.c. operating-point sensitivity or the 
a.c. small-signal sensitivity of an output variable 
with respect to all circuit variables, including 
model parameters. The software calculates the 
difference in an output variable (either a node 
voltage or a branch current) by perturbing each 
complex circuits it can take some time to carry 
out this analysis and the analysis may fail if there 
is an excessive number of poles or zeros.
Small-signal distortion analysis
The distortion analysis facility provided by SPICE-
driven software packages computes steady 
state harmonic and inter-modulation products 
for small input signal magnitudes. If signals of 
a single frequency are specified as the input to 
the circuit, the complex values of the second and

(this has the benefit of reducing what is usually a 
very large amount of data).
Noise analysis
The noise analysis feature determines the amount 
of noise generated by the components and 
devices (e.g. transistors) present in the circuit that 
is being analysed. When provided with an input 
source and an output port, the analysis calculates 
the noise contributions of each device (and each 
noise generator within the device) to the output 
port voltage. It also calculates the input noise to 
the circuit, equivalent to the output noise referred 
to the specified input source. This is done for 
every frequency point in a specified range. After 
calculating the spectral densities, noise analysis 
integrates these values over the specified 
frequency range to arrive at the total noise 
voltage/current (over this frequency range). 
Thermal analysis
Many SPICE packages will allow you to determine 
the effects of temperature on the performance of 
a circuit. Most analyses are performed at normal 
ambient temperatures (e.g. 27 °C) but it can be 
advantageous to look at the effects of reduced 
parameter of each device independently. Since 
the method is a numerical approximation, the 
results may demonstrate second-order effects in 
highly sensitive parameters, or may fail to show 
very low but non-zero sensitivity. Further, since 
each variable is perturbed by a small fraction of 
its value, zero-valued parameters are not analysed

chip comprising many hundreds of thousands 
of individual logic elements which need to be 
connected in a particular way in order to fulfil the 
requirements of the system. However, as logic 
systems become increasingly more complex, a 
number of problems arise, including the need:
X
X to be able to simulate, thoroughly test and 
verify the logic prior to manufacturing the 
device in which the logic will eventually be 
embedded;
X
X to be able to describe the logic in a manner 
that is both understandable and unambiguous;
X
X to take into account the limitations (particularly 
those related to speed and propagation delay) 
of the logic elements that will be employed in 
the target system; and
X
X to be able to create logical components suitable  
for reuse in other complex logic systems.
HDL enables the logic designer to model a device, 
simulate it and then refine its performance before 
committing the design to physical hardware. 
The first major implementation of HDL was 
in 1985 with the advent of Verilog. Two years 
later, with the increasing use of very high-
speed integrated circuits (VHSICs), a request 
from the US Department of Defense led to the 
development of VHDL (VHSIC HDL). Since then, 
VHDL and Verilog have dominated among the 
array of software-based design tools available to 
the advanced digital designer. 
Finally, Fig. 16.19 shows how a simple 
combinational logic circuit can be rapidly 
‘assembled’ and tested and its logical function 
checked. This circuit arrangement provides a 
solution to Question 10.20 on page 202 and it 
shows how the exclusive-OR function can be 
realized using only two-input NAND gates.
Modelling large-scale logic 
systems
Modern LSI and VLSI-based systems can be 
extremely complex. Being able to describe the 
logical function of such systems can be a very 
demanding task as conventional techniques 
(such as truth tables, logic diagrams and Boolean 
algebra) quickly become cumbersome and error-
prone. In the design process there’s also a need 
to take into account internal propagation delays 
and other limitations of real-world logic devices. 
This is just not possible using the conventional 
logic visualization techniques (such as Boolean 
algebra and truth tables) that we met earlier in 
this book.
Hardware description language (HDL) seeks to 
remedy this problem by providing a formal and 
rigorous description of a digital logic circuit. HDL 
provides a means of describing the operation 
and logical function of a circuit as well as its 
architecture and behaviour. By forming an HDL 
description of a circuit we are able to exhaustively 
test and verify the circuit without having to 
manufacture any physical hardware.
Not only does HDL use standard text-based 
constructs to describe the operation of logic 
elements, but it can also take into account the 
timing (and more particularly the time delays) 
associated with real logic devices. This becomes 
invaluable when logic circuits are required to 
operate at high speed or when the appearance 
of unwanted transient logic states may have 
an undesirable or unpredictable effect on the 
behaviour of a logic system, the hardware to 
which it is connected or the systems in which it 
is used. 
Large-scale logic systems are now used in a 
wide variety of modern electronic equipment 
and they are usually fabricated on a single silicon

Entities and entity declarations
In a complex logic system where many 
components and logical sub-systems can 
be present it is essential for each individual 
component to be seen (and can thus be interacted 
with) by all of the other components present. 
Thus a primary requirement of any logic system 
description language is a construct that provides 
us with a rigorous definition of the component’s 
interface. In VHDL this is referred to as an entity.
A VHDL entity must be declared before it can be 
used. This declaration must begin with a unique 
name for the entity and then must specify the 
entity’s input and output ports. For example, the 
following code fragment is an entity declaration of 
a basic half-adder (see Fig. 16.21):
ENTITY half_adder IS
	
PORT( x, y: IN bit;
	
	
sum, carry: OUT bit);
END half-adder;
The code fragment provides us with the following 
information:
1.	 The name of the entity is half_adder.
2.	 The entity has two inputs named x and y.
3.	 The entity has two outputs named sum and 
carry.
4.	 The inputs and outputs are all bit (binary digit) 
type (see later).
The PORT statement specifies the interface to 
the entity in terms of both the direction of data 
flow and the type of signal. Notice also that, at 
this stage, we have not provided any clues as to 
the behaviour or the entity. We need to do this 
separately with some further code statements. 
Note that VHDL allows for both concurrent and 
sequential signal assignment.
Behavioural declarations
Other than the names that we chose for our 
entities, the declaration that we met in the 
previous section provides no clues as to the 
underlying logic function. In order to do this 
we need some additional code to specify the 
behaviour of our entity. Here is how this could be 
done for the half-adder entity:
ARCHITECTURE half_adder_behaviour OF half_adder IS
	
BEGIN 
	
PROCESS (x; y)
	
BEGIN
	
sum <= x XOR y;
	
	
carry <= x AND y;
	
END PROCESS;
	
END half_adder_behaviour;
Notice how we have used standard logical 
expressions XOR and AND in the code (see 
Chapter 10). Now let’s consider a slightly more 
complicated arrangement like the one shown 
in Fig. 16.23. This half-adder has an additional 
enable (EN) input which is taken ‘high’ to enable 
the logic, but when taken low both of the outputs 
(SUM and CARRY) remain in the ‘low’ state. Here 
is the new entity declaration and its associated 
behavioural code:

in Figure 16.21

and implementation. Typical stages in the design 
flow are:
1.	 Conception. Based on an objective needs 
analysis, the initial stage involves developing a 
comprehensive understanding of the required 
function of the logic system. It will help you 
to arrive at a detailed specification as well as a 
definitive list of signals with which the system 
will be able to interact with external hardware. 
Because complex logic designs are invariably 
hierarchical in nature, VHDL provides an 
excellent framework for defining modules and 
their interfaces.
2.	 Coding. The next stage is that of actually 
developing the VHDL code. This involves 
describing each of the VHDL components 
in terms of how they will interact with 
other components. The stage also involves 
specifying the required library modules as well 
as any existing code that can be re-used and 
incorporated into the new design. 
3.	 Compilation. Having completed the coding, 
the next stage is that of analysing the code 
for syntax errors and compatibility with other 
modules. If no errors are identified, the 
compilation process will continue to produce 
to the point at which the VHDL component 
ENTITY half_adder IS
	
PORT( x, y, en: IN bit;
	
sum, carry: OUT bit);
END half-adder;
ARCHITECTURE half_adder_behaviour OF half_adder IS
	
BEGIN 
	
PROCESS (x; y)
	
BEGIN
	
IF en = ‘1’ THEN
	
sum <= x XOR y;
	
carry <= x AND y;
	
ELSE
	
sum <= ‘0’;
	
carry <= ‘0’;
	
END IF;
	
END PROCESS;
	
END half_adder_behaviour;
Note how the IF ... THEN ... ELSE ... END IF construct 
is used to make a logical decision based on the 
state of the enable (EN) input.
VHDL design flow
When designing with VHDL as an aid it is 
essential to adopt a structured approach. This 
usually involves a series of stages starting with a 
detailed specification and ending with verification 
Figure 16.23  A half-adder with an enable (EN) 
input

in Figure 16.23

16  Circuit simulation
313
providing all of the necessary ‘hooks’ for other 
logic modules to connect to it and make use of it. 
The following points are worth noting in relation 
to the structure of a VHDL program:
X
X In the source text of a VHDL program, the 
entity declaration and architecture definition 
must be separated.
X
X VHDL uses a number of reserved  keywords 
such as ENTITY, PORT, IS, IN, OUT, END, 
ARCHITECTURE, BEGIN, WHEN, ELSE and NOT. 
Note that, for clarity, we have shown these 
capitalized in the code examples but they 
could be equally used in lower case.
X
X Comments in VHDL must begin with two 
hyphens (--) and end at the end of a line.
X
X Identifiers begin with a letter and may contain 
letters, digits and underscores (but note that 
two underscores may not be used together or 
be the last character in an identifier).
X
X Keywords and identifiers in VHDL code are not 
case sensitive.
Finally, because VHDL is not usually case 
sensitive and white space is neglected, you may 
encounter some minor variations in style, layout 
and presentation when examining samples of 
VHDL code from different sources.
VHDL signal modes and types
As explained in the previous section, a VHDL 
entity is simply a declaration of a component’s 
inputs and outputs so that it can be ‘seen’ from 
the outside world and thus be interacted with. At 
the same time, the inner workings of the entity 
(i.e. its behaviour and architecture) are completely 
hidden from the external view. This is a powerful 
concept: once an entity has been designed and 
tested it can be easily incorporated into many 
other logic systems. Because we have no need 
to concern ourselves with what goes on inside an 
entity, we are only interested in what the entity 
does and how to connect to it!
There are a few more signal modes than the 
simple IN (input) and OUT (output) that we met 
in the earlier VHDL examples. Here is a list of 
allowed modes:
X
X IN – the signal is an input to the entity.
X
X OUT – the signal is an output of the entity (note 
that this signal is only available to external 
can be simulated using a test-bench 
procedure.
4.	 Simulation. Simulation will allow you to check 
that a VHDL design works as originally planned 
without actually committing the design to 
hardware. The VHDL simulator allows you to 
define and apply inputs to the design and to 
check that the required outputs are produced. 
It will also allow you to experiment with the 
timing delays that are inherent in real-world 
logic devices and ensure that the component’s 
logical operation is independent of timing 
considerations and internal gate delays.
5.	 Synthesis. Synthesis involves converting the 
intermediate VHDL code into components that 
can be assembled using the target technology. 
With ASIC devices, for example, the VHDL 
programming environment will export a net list 
that specifies how the individual gates should 
be interconnected in order to realize the 
desired logic function.
6.	 Fitting, placement and routing. This 
penultimate step in the process involves 
the physical realization of the component in 
hardware rather than software. The process 
differs according to the semiconductor 
technology and may lead to a production-scale 
run of devices.
7.	 Verification. Finally, the design needs to 
be tested within the system into which it 
will be connected. This involves assembly 
onto the target avionics platform as well as 
carrying out further tests in order to assess 
the performance of the component when 
subjected to real-world circuit delays caused 
by stray reactances, electrical loading and 
other factors (including being able to continue 
to perform to specification at the extreme 
limits of temperature and supply voltage).
VHDL programs
VHDL programs must conform to a well-
defined structure. This structure describes the 
architecture of a device at several different levels, 
notably its internal structure or behaviour as well 
as how it appears to the outside world. The notion 
of an entity that we met earlier is important. You 
might like to think of it as a ‘wrapper’ for the 
architecture, hiding the internal details but yet still 

16  Circuit simulation

X
X ‘W’	–	a weak unknown;
X
X ‘L’	 –	a low state (or weak logic 0);
X
X ‘H’	–	a high state (or weak logic 1);
X
X ‘–’	 –	don’t care.
VHDL operators
Like most conventional programming languages, 
VHDL supports a variety of operators divided 
into different classes in order of precedence. 
These operators include those that are associated 
with many of the logic functions that we have 
introduced in this book, such as AND, OR and 
NOT.  Others allow us to perform conventional 
arithmetic operations, such as +, – and /. The list 
below shows how these (and other) operators 
are arranged in order of precedence (the highest 
order of precedence is for the miscellaneous 
operators in Class 7 while the lowest is for the 
logical operators in Class 1):
Class 1 (logical operators)
AND  OR  NAND  NOR  XOR  XNOR
Class 2 (relational operators)
=  /=  <  <=  >  >=
Class 3 (shift operators)
SLL  SRL  SLA  SRA  ROL  ROR
Class 4 (addition operators)
+  =  &
Class 5 (unary operators)
+  –
Class 6 (multiplying operators)
*  /  MOD  REM
Class 7 (miscellaneous operators)
**  ABS  NOT
As examples of the use (and importance) of 
precedence, consider the following expressions, 
when p and q are both std_ulogic_vector data types 
with values 1010 and 0110, respectively:
p AND q 	
evaluates to 0010 
NOT p AND q 	
evaluates to 0100
p AND NOT q	
evaluates to 1000
p AND SLA q 	
evaluates to 1000  (SLA 
means ‘shift left arithmetic’)
NOT p AND ROR q	
evaluates to 0001  (ROR 
means ‘rotate right logical’)
VHDL logic decisions and program flow
VHDL incorporates structures that support logical 
decisions and aid program flow. Since many 
entities and it has no meaning inside the 
entity’s architecture).
X
X BUFFER – the signal is an output of the entity 
and its value can also be read and used inside 
the entity’s architecture (unlike OUT).
X
X INOUT – the signal can be used as an input or 
an output of the entity. This mode is typically 
used for tri-state signal lines which can be 
used both for input and output (but not at the 
same time!).
In VHDL, all signals, variables and constants must 
have an associated type which specifies the 
permissible range of values for the object. VHDL 
provides several predefined types, including the 
following:
X
X bit – a binary digit having the value 0 or 1.
X
X bit_vector – the signal is a vector of bit values 
(e.g. bits 0 to 7 of a byte). Bit vectors help to 
simplify the VHDL code when dealing with 
groups of bits.
X
X std_logic and std_ulogic – these are logic signals 
that can have one of nine different properties, 
including unknown, uninitialized, forcing and 
weak logic states (see below).
X
X std_logic_vector and std_ulogic_vector – as 
above but for vectors of bit values.
X
X boolean – a logic signal that can exist in two 
states, true and false.
X
X integer – a number that can take one of a range 
of integer values.
X
X real – a number that can take one of a range of 
real values.
X
X character – a printable character, such as ‘@’.
X
X time – a value that indicates the time.
In a real-world logic system the logic levels are 
rarely perfect representations of the ideal logic 0 
and logic 1 levels. VHDL takes this into account 
with its std_logic and std_ulogic data types that are 
defined in the relevant IEEE library. Thus std_logic 
and std_ulogic (and their bit vector counterparts) 
are preferred over the more basic bit types. The 
range of real-world logic conditions that are 
catered for include:
X
X ‘U’	–	an un-initialized value;
X
X ‘X’	 –	a forcing unknown;
X
X ‘0’	 –	a forcing logic 0;
X
X ‘1’	 –	a forcing logic 1;
X
X ‘Z’	 –	high impedance (tri-state);

ELSEIF, part of the statement examines the state 
of the clock. On a rising edge of the clock (this 
is when the clock is changing and goes to logic 
1) the state of the d input is transferred to the 
q output. If d is at logic 1 the q output will go to 
logic 1. If d is at logic 0 the q output will go to 
logic 0. If this isn’t clear I suggest you look again 
at the example, on a line-by-line basis.
The VHDL std_logic uses arrays to cater for 
multiple data lines. For example, here is the code 
for the four-bit D-type bistable data latch shown 
in Fig. 16.26 (note that the device has four data 
bit inputs and four data bit outputs together with 
common clock and clear inputs):
LIBRARY ieee;
USE ieee.std_logic_1164.all;
ENTITY d_bistable IS
	
port(clk, clr, : IN std_logic;
	
	
d : IN bit_vector(3 down to 0);
	
	
q : OUT bit_vector(3 down to 0);
END d_bistable;
ARCHITECTURE d_bistable_behaviour OF d_bistable IS
	
BEGIN 
	
	
d_bistable_process (clk, clr)
	
	
      BEGIN
	
	
	
	
IF (clr = ‘1’) THEN
	
	
	
	
   q <= ‘0’;
	
	
	
	
ELSEIF (clk’event 
AND clk = ‘1’) THEN
	
	
	
	
   q <= d;
	
	
	
	
END IF;
	
	
	
END d_bistable_process; 
	
END d_bistable_behaviour;
readers will already be familiar with constructs 
such as IF ... THEN and BEGIN ... END and since 
their action should be reasonably self-explanatory, 
we will not explain these further other than to 
illustrate their use with the aid of some examples. 
The first example shows the VHDL code for the 
positive-edge triggered D-type bistable data latch 
shown in Fig. 16.25. This code fragment uses the 
std_logic data type:
LIBRARY ieee;
USE ieee.std_logic_1164.all;
ENTITY d_bistable IS
port(clk, clr, d : IN std_logic;
	
q : OUT std_logic);
END d_bistable;
ARCHITECTURE d_bistable_behaviour OF d_bistable IS
BEGIN 
	
d_bistable_process (clk, clr)
	
BEGIN
	
IF (clr = ‘1’) THEN
	
q <= ‘0’;
	
ELSEIF (clk’event AND clk = 
‘1’) THEN
	
q <= d;
	
END IF;
	
END d_bistable_process;  
END d_bistable_behaviour;
In the foregoing example the D-type bistable has 
inputs, clk, clr and d. There is only one output, q. 
This information can be gleaned from the ENTITY 
declaration (and the PORT statement in particular).
The architecture statement tells us about the 
behaviour of the D-type bistable. The first part of 
the compound IF ... THEN statement examines the 
state of the clr input and resets the q output (to 
logic 0) if the clr input is as logic 1. The second,

occurring precisely as and when dictated by the 
test-bench code. 
An HDL simulator will usually provide you with 
a comprehensive display which shows how 
signals change with time and from which the time 
dependency of output and intermediate signals 
can be observed. You will normally be able to 
start or stop the display at any desired time or by 
adding break points that will allow you to halt 
the simulation so that you can examine the logic 
states.
It is a mistake to think of HDL as simply another 
programming language. Despite some obvious 
similarities (e.g. the use of a compiler) there 
are some very significant differences. The most 
important of these differences is that most 
programming languages are inherently procedural 
(single-threaded) and incapable of handling a 
Notice how the  IN bit_vector() keyword defines four 
data-input lines (corresponding to bits 3, 2, 1 and 0) 
while the corresponding four data lines are defined 
by the OUT bit_vector() keyword. This greatly 
simplifies the VHDL code when dealing with 
groups of bits, bytes and complete data words.
VHDL simulation and the test bench
Simulation (see Fig. 16.27) is critical in 
establishing the performance of an HDL model 
under a range of different conditions. To simulate 
an HDL component, the designer makes use of 
a top-level simulation environment known as a 
test bench. The test-bench code must be written 
separately from the component’s declaration and 
it should include precise definitions of all signal 
and clock waveforms that will be applied to the 
component during the simulation process. The 
test-bench code is event-driven, with events

Timing
An important aspect of VHDL is its ability to 
accurately model the timing delays that are 
inherent in real-world logic devices. To illustrate 
this important point Fig. 16.28 shows the digital 
timing analysis of a simple half-adder arrangement 
number of events at the same time. HDLs, on 
the other hand, need to be able to model a large 
number of parallel processes, all of which could 
potentially occur at the same instant in time. An 
HDL therefore needs to have the characteristics 
of a concurrent, multi-threaded language.

16  Circuit simulation
318
This delay results from the propagation delay 
associated with the standard 7404 and 7408 gates 
(approximately 15 ns each). 
Propagation delay can be easily modelled in 
VHDL by defining a constant gate delay within 
an architecture declaration. The following code 
fragment (see also Fig. 16.29) shows how this 
can be done using:
ARCHITECTURE dataflow OF xor_gate IS
CONSTANT gate_delay : time := 15ns;
based on standard logic devices. In less-critical 
low-speed applications the delay in a signal 
passing through the half-adder arrangement can 
be tolerated, but for high-speed applications the 
delay, due to the finite time taken for a change 
in logic level to reach the output of the half-
adder, can produce spurious logical states that 
could in some circumstances prove problematic. 
Notice how, in Fig. 16.30, the Sum output is 
delayed by 45 ns following the change to Input_A.

The PIC microcontroller
Chapter summary
Earlier, in Chapter 11, we introduced the PIC microcontroller as a device 
that is normally used in stand-alone (or embedded) applications to perform 
simple logic, timing and input/output control. In recent years such devices 
have become increasingly sophisticated in terms of both the variety of I/O 
peripheral facilities provided and the ability to connect to other devices 
in bus and networked configurations. This latter feature makes it possible 
to have several microcontrollers working together, exchanging data and 
control information, in distributed systems that can be of virtually any size.

PIC architecture
PIC microcontrollers first became popular in 
the mid-1990s. Since then the range of devices 
available has increased dramatically. Nowadays 
a PIC device exists for almost any embedded 
application, from small six-pin devices ideal for 
simple control applications, through to powerful 
high-speed devices packed with I/O features and 
large amounts of memory. 
PICs are based on RISC (Reduced Instruction Set 
Computer) architecture and, as a consequence, 
they use a relatively small number of instructions. 
In fact, some PIC chips have as few as 33 
instructions, compared with some general-
purpose microprocessors (such as the Z80) 
that may have several hundred. Because it is 
only necessary to remember a relatively small 
number of commands, it is relatively easy to 
learn to program a PIC using its own assembly 
language (note, however, that it may take several 
instructions to achieve on a PIC what can be 
done in a single instruction using a fully-fledged 
microprocessor). And, if you don’t like the idea of 
having to learn assembly code programming you 
can can make use of C, BASIC or Flowcode (a 
language based almost entirely on flowcharts).
Another feature of PIC devices is that they use 
Harvard architecture. This means that they 
contain completely separate memory and buses 
for program instructions and data memory. 
Program memory can be ROM, EPROM or 
Flash, whereas data memory must be read/write 
memory (commonly known as RAM).
Mainstream microprocessors (like the Z80 that 
we met in Chapter 11) are categorized in terms of 
the number of data bits that they can manipulate 
(i.e. the ‘width’ of the data bus). They can be 
8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, 64-bit and 128-bit devices. PIC 
microcontrollers, by contrast, are all based on an 
8-bit data bus and, because of this, they can only 
operate on 8 bits of data at a time (despite this, 
you will sometimes encounter instructions that 
reference more data bits, i.e. 12 bits, 14 bits and 
16 bits). Furthermore, although the data memory 
is 8 bits wide for all PIC microcontrollers, the 
program memory varies from 12 bits to 16 bits. 
PIC families
In the early 1990s, PIC microcontrollers were 
grouped in three families, often referred to as 
‘Base-Line’, ‘Mid-Range’ and ‘High-End’. Many 
of these devices are incompatible with the latest 
development platforms and software tools. 
Despite this, it is usually possible to locate a 
modern device that is compatible with (and will 
generally out-perform) one of these early devices.
The base-line family comprised just four 
devices, which all featured 12-bit instructions. 
The PIC16C54 and PIC16C56 were both 18-pin 
devices having 12 digital I/O lines. The PIC16C54 
had 512 × 12-bit words of EPROM program 
memory, while the PIC16C56 had 1 K × 12-bit 
words. Both of these devices had just 32 bytes 
of RAM data memory (ample for most simple 
control applications). The larger PIC16C55 and 
PIC16C57 28-pin devices had 20 digital I/O lines. 
The PIC16C55 had 512 × 12-bit words of EPROM 
program memory and 32 bytes of RAM data 
memory, while the PIC16C57 had 2 K × 12-bit 
words of EPROM program memory and 80 bytes 
of RAM data memory. All of these devices also 
featured an 8-bit real-time clock/counter and a 
watchdog timer.
The mid-range family of PIC devices contained 
a number of devices that expanded on the 
capabilities of the base-line devices. Of particular 
note are the PIC16C71, which added A/D inputs 
capable of reading analogue signals, and the 
popular PIC16C84, which featured EEPROM 
program and data memory. Because of the fact 
that the PIC16C84 could be erased electronically 
(without the need for the ultraviolet eraser 
required for EPROM erasure), it soon became a 
favourite with hobbyists and must have been the 
most popular PIC for many years.
The high-end device was the PIC17C42. This 
device came in a 40-pin package and featured 
16-bit wide instructions. It also allowed for 
external memory to be interfaced and supported 
up to 64 K × 6-bit addressable program memory 
space. The device provided 33 digital I/O pins, 
EEPROM data memory, a serial port (USART), 
three 16-bit timers/counters and two high-speed 
pulse width modulation (PWM) outputs.

17 The PIC microcontroller
324
There are now more than 200 different PIC 
chips available and the ‘Base-Line’, ‘Mid-Range’ 
and ‘High-End’ classification has now been 
replaced by several different ranges of PIC 
families such as the PIC-10, PIC-12, PIC-16 and 
PIC-18. Generally speaking, the higher the family 
number, the more powerful the device in terms 
of processing capabilities, memory sizes and I/O 
features. Another feature of many of the devices 
is Flash program memory. These devices can 
be erased and reprogrammed electrically, as 
with the previously popular PIC16C84. These 
Flash memory devices are signified by a letter 
‘F’ in their part number (e.g. PIC16F877A). Note 
that Flash devices are much easier to work with 
for one-off prototyping because erasure and 
reprogramming is greatly simplified.
Choosing a PIC device
When choosing a PIC device for a particular 
project it is important to select a device that is 
well supported, both in terms of being a member 
of one of the current PIC families but also in 
terms of the programming and environment that 
you intend to use for software development. 
It is also important to ensure that the device 
incorporates all of the peripheral I/O facilities that 
you will need. Such facilities might include:
X
X Bus and communication interfaces (such as 
RS232/RS485, I2C, CAN, LIN, USB, TCP/IP)
X
X Display peripheral interfaces (such as LED or 
LCD drivers)
X
X Capture/compare facilities
X
X Pulse Width Modulators (PWMs)
X
X Counters/timers
X
X Watchdog facilities
X

amplifiers
X
X Brown-out detectors
X

Features of the PIC16F84
The PIC16F84 is an excellent choice for most 
simple microcontroller projects. This device is 
used in many current PIC designs and it has the 
following features:
X
X 35 single-word instructions (see Table 17.3)
X
X 1 k × 14-bit EEPROM (Flash) program memory
X
X 68 × 8-bit general purpose SRAM registers

PIC family
Characteristics
PIC10F
The PIC10F range features just a few 
6-8-pin microcontrollers. These chips are 
supplied in DIP packages.
PIC12F
The PIC12F devices include the PIC12F629, 
PIC12F675 and PIC12F683. They are 
all 8-pin devices featuring six digital I/O 
lines and differ in the amount of program 
and data memory that they provide. The 
PIC12F683 also provides analogue inputs.
PIC16F
The PIC16F family is very large and 
includes devices in 14-, 18-, 28- and 40-pin 
packages. The chips vary in terms of the 
amount of memory they provide and also 
in their I/O features. Some devices worth 
noting include the PIC16F630, PIC16F676, 
PIC16F684 and PIC16F688, which are 
14-pin equivalents to the PIC12F devices 
mentioned above, the PIC16F84A, which is 
the most current equivalent to the popular 
PIC16C84, and the PIC16F877A, which is 
a powerful 40-pin device that has become 
extremely popular. The PIC16F877A 
features 8192 × 14-bit Flash program 
memory, 368 bytes of RAM data memory, 
256 bytes of EEPROM data memory, 33 
digital I/O lines, eight 10-bit A/D channels, 
three counters/timers and a serial port 
(USART).
PIC18F
The PIC18F devices form the new high-end 
range. One feature that they all share is 
that their instruction set is optimized for C 
compilers. Many feature large amounts of 
memory and special I/O features including 
Universal Serial Bus (USB) and Controller 
Area Network (CAN) interfaces. One 
interesting device is the 40-pin PIC18F452, 
which is similar in many respects and pin-
compatible with the PIC16F877A. It is also 
worth noting that some PIC18F devices are 
supplied in 80-pin packages and provide 
more than 70 digital I/O lines. However, 
these are in surface-mount packages and 
so are difficult to experiment with!

In Fig. 17.8(a) a dedicated PIC programmer is 
used while in Fig. 17.8(b) the PIC is programmed 
while resident in the target system. In either 
case, the programming software and source 
code is resident on a PC and downloaded as hex 
code into the PIC. The process of generating 
the source code, compiling and/or assembling 
it into hex code (see Fig. 17.10) is invariably 
performed by software known as an Integrated 
Development Environment (IDE), as shown in 
Fig. 17.9. Software is also available that can be 
used to simulate a PIC (see Figs 17.11 to 17.13) 
and full development systems are also available 
(see Figs 17.14 and 17.15).

PIC programming
PIC programming can be carried out using 
assembly language, C (see Table 17.2), BASIC 
and Flowcode (see page 328) or a mixture of 
these languages. Software and a programmer 
(see Figs 17.6 and 17.7) will be required to do 
this. The two most commonly used methods of 
programming a PIC chip are shown in Fig. 17.8.

(S1–S4) to control three relays (RL1–RL3). The program is automatically reset at power-up

328
Figure 17.5  A simple microcontroller application based on the 16F877A device. This application uses 
eight LED outputs (D0 to D7). Note that the circuit must be manually reset at power-up
Flowcode
Flowcode is a novel programming system that is 
designed to allow those new to PIC programming 
to develop complete applications with little or 
no knowledge of any higher-level languages. 
However, it is possible to embed code written in 
other languages into Flowcode programs. 
Programs written in C and Assembly code can be 
easily embedded in Flowcode. This will allow you 
to incorporate more complex and sophisticated 
code in applications where this might become 
necessary. Note, however, that the embedded 
code cannot be checked or simulated by 
Flowcode but instead it will be passed on to the 
C compiler when the flowchart is compiled. It 
is therefore important to verify that the C code 
entered is correct, as syntax errors will cause the 
compilation of the whole flowchart to fail.
To access Flowcode variables, macro functions 
and connection points, it is necessary to colour 
the variable in your C code with the prefixes 
FCV_, FCM_ and FCC_MacroName_, respectively. 
For example, to use a Flowcode variable called 
DELAY in your C code, you must refer to it using 
FCV_DELAY. Note that all Flowcode defined 
variables must be entered in upper case.
To call a Flowcode macro called TEST in your C 
code, you must call FCM_TEST();. To jump to a 
connection point called A, defined in a Flowcode 
macro called TEST, your C code must be goto 
FCC_TEST_A;. Connection points defined in the 
main flowchart of a Flowcode file are prefixed 
FCC_Main_. 
Assembly code (see Table 17.3) can be added into 
the code field in a C assembly code wrapper. For 
a single line of code you can use the asm operator 
in front of each instruction (e.g. asm movlw 5) 
or you can enclose several statements within an 
asm block. This makes adding assembly language 
routines very simple.

simply dragged and dropped into the main program window from the toolbar on the left
(shown in Table 17.4) is available for downloading 
from the companion website (see page 461). 
Procedure 
Start the PIC Simulator (see Fig. 17.17), click 
on Options and then Select Microcontroller. 
Select the ‘PIC16F877’ from the list and click 
on the Select button. Next click on File and 
Load Program. Select the file named adc.hex 
(generated as a result of compiling the BASIC 
source code shown in Table 17.4) and click on 
Open. This will load the program into the PIC’s 
program memory. 
Click on Tools and Microcontroller View in order 
to open the window shown in Fig. 17.18). If 
necessary, reposition the windows on the screen 
so that you can see both of them, then Select 
the Rate and Extremely Fast before clicking on

pin then use the slider to change the analogue 
value on this pin and click on Accept button to 
accept the value. The state of the PORTB pins 
should immediately reflect this value. Repeat 
with several different analogue input values and 
at reduced simulation speeds in order to examine 
the effect of each program instruction. 
A further program 
If you have been able to run the simple ADC 
program successfully you might like to try your 
hand at entering, compiling and running a program 
that will loop continuously reading the state of the 
switches on Port A and output the result to Port B 
(see Fig. 17.12).

CHAPTER
Electronic applications 
and the Raspberry Pi
Chapter summary
The inexpensive and immensely popular Raspberry Pi microcomputer 
(Fig. 18.1) can be a very cost-effective platform for developing a huge 
variety of electronic projects that need programmed control. With its 
impressively small form factor of just 86 × 56 mm, the Raspberry Pi utilizes 
a Broadcom ARM-based SoC (system on chip) processor running at a 
default speed of 700 MHz. An integral Videocore 4 video-processing unit 
caters for hardware decoding of high-definition video at high bit rates and 
this makes the unit ideal for a wide variety of multimedia applications 
as well as embedded projects. Although both models have the same 
processor hardware, Model B does benefit from an increased 512 Mb 
of RAM compared with the 256 Mb fitted to the Model A. The newly 
introduced Model B+ (shown in Fig. 18.1) offers an enhanced specification 
with four USB ports (compared with two on the Model B), lower power 
consumption, improved audio quality and a 40-pin I/O connector which 
retains pin-out compatibility with the first 26 pins on the Model B.

Figure 18.2 shows the main components present 
on the Pi's circuit board as well as the non-volatile 
secure digital (SD) memory card which connects 
to the rear of the circuit board (see Fig. 18.3).
One of the features that makes the Raspberry 
Pi ideal for use by enthusiasts and hobbyists is 
the computer's General Purpose Input Output 
(GPIO) port. This allows the connection of all 
manner of additional inputs and outputs that can 
be accessed from a program running on the Pi. 
Couple this with the connectivity, networking 
and processing capabilities (see Fig. 18.4) and 
you have an excellent microcomputer-based 
development system capable of supporting some 
highly sophisticated electronic projects!

Linux-based operating system manages the

representing either a low or high state. In practice, 
this means that the range of voltage between 
about +0.8 V and +2.0 V is indeterminate in terms 
of the logic state that it represents and thus needs 
to be avoided!
The acceptable range of signal voltage for the 
Raspberry Pi's GPIO port is shown in Table 18.1. 
Thus, for example, an input voltage of +0.4 V 
would be interpreted as a low (or logic 0) state, 
while an output voltage of +3.0 V would be 
equivalent to a high (or logic 1) state.

Output low voltage, VOL
0 V to +0.6 V
Output high voltage, VOH
+2.4 V to +3.3 V
Output source current
The current sourced by the GPIO is derived from 
the Pi's +3.3 V regulator (see Fig. 18.3). The 3.3 V 
regulator is rated for a maximum continuous 
current drain of 50 mA and therefore the total 
current supplied by the GPIO signal pins must not 
be allowed to exceed this value. So, for example, 
it would be possible to source 8 mA to each of 
five light emitting diodes (total 40 mA), but if 
eight devices were to be driven the current to 
be supplied to each individual LED would need 
to be reduced to no more than 6 mA. Thus the 
limitation of the 3.3 V supply needs to be kept 
in mind when designing an interface board! 
Alternatively, it can often be advisable to use 
an external +3.3 V power supply and use the 
Raspberry Pi's increased sink current capability 
(see next section).
Output sink current
The current that can be sunk by the GPIO is 
appreciably greater than that which can be 
sourced. Each of the Raspberry Pi's GPIO lines 
are capable of sinking a current of up to 16 mA. 
Furthermore, provided that the 16 mA maximum 
is observed, the total current limitation no longer 
applies. 
interface between one or more user application 
programs and the hardware components of 
the microprocessor system together with any 
peripheral devices (such as keyboards, displays 
and printers) that are connected to it. The 
operating system operates at both high level, 
providing a variety of system services such as 
those needed to operate a file system, and at low 
level, using a number of drivers that allow the 
microcomputer system to interact with specific 
items of hardware such as displays and printers.
Using the Raspberry Pi's GPIO
In Chapter 11 we mentioned that, in order to fulfil 
any useful function, a microprocessor system 
needs to have links with the outside world and 
that these connections are provided by means of 
one or more programmable VLSI devices. These 
input/output (I/O) devices fall into two general 
categories; parallel (where one byte is transferred 
at a time along eight wires), or serial (where one 
bit is transferred after another along a single wire). 
Thanks to the versatility of the Raspberry Pi's 
GPIO the system is able to cater for both serial 
and parallel data transfer.
At this point, and before attempting to make 
use of the Raspberry Pi's GPIO port, it is 
essential to be aware that the chip that drives 
the GPIO port can be very easily damaged by 
misconnection or the application of voltages 
outside the manufacturer's specified range. In 
particular, the voltage applied to the signal pins 
must never exceed +3.3 V or fall below 0 V. An 
inadvertent connection to the +5 V rail must be 
avoided at all cost!
Logic levels
The logic levels used to represent the digital 
signals on the GPIO connector are normally 
quoted as low (or logic 0) represented by voltages 
'near 0 V' and high (or logic 1) represented by 
voltages 'near +3.3 V'. This definition can be a 
little problematic as both low and high states 
are actually represented by a range of voltages. 
However, what is more important is that any 
voltage outside the acceptable range (for example, 
a voltage level of +1.5 V) is not misconstrued as 

18  Electronic applications and the Raspberry Pi

aside) the insulation so that an effective electrical 
connection is made between a tiny pair of jaws 
and the respective stranded copper wires inside 
the insulation provided by the ribbon cable.
Note that the pin numbering used by the 
Raspberry Pi foundation for the Pi's GPIO 
connector is a little unconventional as the even-
numbered pins are located along the board edge 
and this suggests that the ribbon cable should 
exit the header towards the centre of the printed 
circuit board rather than more neatly away from 
the board edge. Also note that on a conventional 
IDC connector pin-1 is usually marked with 
a triangular symbol and the corresponding 
conductor on the ribbon cable is marked with a 
red stripe (Fig. 18.7). 
Which version?
Some of the GPIO connector's pin functions 
have changed between different versions, so it is 
important to know which version of the Raspberry 
Pi board you are dealing with! Of particular 
interest when dealing with the default chip 
configuration is that the signal carried on pin 13 of 
the GPIO connector was changed from GPIO21 
in Version 1 of the board to GPIO27 in Version 2. 
Capacitive loads
So far we have assumed that the GPIO lines 
operate with purely resistive loads (e.g. a series 
combination of a resistor and an LED). However, 
when driving a capacitive load there is a need 
to ensure that the transient current supplied to 
the capacitor does not exceed the source or 
sink current limitations mentioned earlier. This 
can be achieved by means of some additional 
series resistance to limit the capacitor's charging 
current. For example, a series resistance of 220 Ω 
will limit the transient current to +3.3 V/220 Ω 
or about 15 mA, regardless of the amount of 
capacitance present. Note that the additional 
resistance will tend to act as a low-pass filter 
and so this will impose a limit on the speed 
of operation, depending on the value of shunt 
(parallel) capacitance present in the load.
GPIO configuration
Many of the GPIO pins can be reconfigured to 
provide alternate functions such as a simple 
serial interface for external devices compatible 
with the SPI or I2C interface standards. Following 
initialization the GPIO pins are placed in their 
default state and the GPIO channels become 
immediately available on the GPIO header (P1) for 
use as general purpose input or output lines. 
Depending on the particular application that you 
are dealing with, the GPIO pins are extremely 
versatile and can be configured in a variety of 
different ways. We will be explaining how this 
is achieved later, but for now we will simply be 
dealing with the default configuration that loads 
when the Raspberry Pi is initialized at boot time. 
The GPIO port lines on the Raspberry Pi are 
brought out to a 26-way header. This comprises 
two rows of 13 pins spaced 0.1" apart, as shown 
in Fig. 18.6. The header is designed to be used 
with an insulation displacement connector (IDC) 
which uses a 26-way flat ribbon cable. This greatly 
simplifies circuit construction and helps keep the 
wiring between the Raspberry Pi and any external 
boards neat and tidy. 
The contact between the female cable socket 
and the conductors within the ribbon cable is 
made by 'displacing' (i.e. piercing and pushing 
Figure 18.6  GPIO signals and their pin 
connections on the GPIO header (P1)

This will display the board's revision number. A 
revision number of 0002 or 0003 will be displayed 
for a Version 1 board. Higher numbers correspond 
to a Version 2, or later, board. As well as 
information on the processor, a typical response 
to the command might include the following lines:
Hardware      :  BCM2708
Revision        :  0003
This indicates that you are dealing with a Version 
1 board. Note that if the revision number is 
preceded by '1000' this will indicate that the 
processor has been overclocked by raising its core 
voltage so, for example, the following indicates 
a Version 2 board that has been overclocked (the 
overclocked status is preserved in an internal 
write-once memory):
Hardware      :  BCM2708
Revision        :  10000004
The Python GPIO library
The Python GPIO library module provides easy 
access to the features of the GPIO port from 
within your Python code. Before the library 
module can be used it needs to be imported using 
a statement of the form:
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
The name of the file that we are going to import 
is RPi.GPIO and the 'as GPIO' means that we can 
simply refer to the port as 'GPIO' from that point 
onwards.
Note that if you don't have sufficient privileges 
the library import will fail and a runtime error 
will be generated. To overcome this problem 
you need to execute your Python script as a 
'superuser', but you can set this privilege level 
by simply using sudo before the script name. For 
example, if your script has the name 'control.py' 
you would execute it using the command:
sudo control.py
Next, we need to deal with another potential 
cause of potential confusion! When programming 
the GPIO port it is possible to refer to the signals 
in two different ways. We can either use the 
GPIO signal name or the name given by the 
Some other pin functions also changed between 
these two versions. Fortunately, it seems 
unlikely that the GPIO connector will change in 
any subsequent versions of the Raspberry Pi, 
but it could be well worth checking if you have 
a newer board version. Note that the Model B+ 
has 40 pins on the GPIO connector, with the first 
26 pins having identical functions as those on the 
Models A and B, described here.
You can check your board version by examining 
the CPU data stored in the system. To do this 
you can make use of the cat command entered 
directly from the command prompt:
cat /proc/cpuinfo

examining the status LEDs. Note also that the

Reading and writing to the GPIO
Having configured the GPIO and having defined 
the pins/channels to be used for input and output 
it is very easy to read from and write to the port 
lines. As an example, after having configured 
the port for header pin numbering (rather than 
Broadcom channels) the following fragment of 
code reads the state of pin 11 (with the result 
appearing as the input_value variable) before 
setting the output from pin 12 in the high state:
# input from pin 11
input_value = GPIO.input(11)
# output to pin 12
GPIO.output(12, GPIO.HIGH)
Now here's the equivalent code based on the 
Broadcom channels:
# input from channel 17
input_value = GPIO.input(17)
# output to channel 18
GPIO.output(18, GPIO.HIGH)
Note that the state of a GPIO line can be 
described in different ways. GPIO.LOW can also be 
described as 0 or False, while GPIO.HIGH can also 
be described as 1 or True. For example, all three 
of the following lines of code have exactly the 
same effect:
GPIO.output(18, GPIO.HIGH)
GPIO.output(18, GPIO.1)
GPIO.output(18, GPIO.True)
Finally, at the end of any program, and before 
the program makes an exit back to the operating 
manufacturers of the Broadcom chip. Fortunately, 
there is a solution to this problem since the GPIO 
library can be configured to use either of these 
two conventions.
The Python statement GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BOARD) 
sets the use of the Pi's board numbers, while 
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM) sets the use of the 
Broadcom signal numbering.
To configure the individual GPIO signals as inputs 
or outputs you can use the GPIO.setup command. 
For example, GPIO.setup(11, GPIO.IN) sets GPIO 
channel 11 as an input based on the numbering 
system that you previously specified using the 
GPIO.setmode command. If this is beginning to 
sound a little complicated, here's a fragment of 
Python code that sets GPIO channel 17 as an 
input and GPIO channel 18 as an output using the 
Broadcom pin numbering convention:
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
# use the BCM pin numbering convention
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
# setup channel 17 as an input and 18 as an output
GPIO.setup(17, GPIO.IN)
GPIO.setup(18, GPIO.OUT)
Now here's some code that would have exactly 
the same effect but using the Raspberry Pi board 
numbering. This code uses pin 11 of the GPIO 
header as an input and pin 12 as an output:
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
# use the BCM pin numbering convention
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BOARD)
# set up the pin-11 as an input and pin-12 as an output
GPIO.setup(11, GPIO.IN)
GPIO.setup(12, GPIO.OUT)
The relationship between the header pin 
numbers for Rev.0 and Rev.1 boards and their 
corresponding general-purpose Broadcom GPIO 
channels is shown in Table 18.2. Which method 
of configuring the GPIO via the setmode command 
you use is largely a matter of personal choice. 
There are advantages and disadvantages either 
way, but the Broadcom channel numbering is 
likely to be more future-proof in the possible 
situation that the header pin numbers might 
change in a future revision (note that there has 
been a change in some of the pin functions 
between the Rev.0 and Rev.1 Raspberry Pi 
boards).

system, it is good practice to clean up by setting 
the mode of all the I/O channels you've used to 
their default input state. This could help prevent 
damage in the event that any of the I/O lines 
should become inadvertently short-circuited, 
and can be very easily achieved by adding GPIO.

Controlling an LED with a switch
As a very simple example of using the Pi's GPIO 
let's assume that we need to operate a single 
LED output from a momentary action push-button 
input. The circuit and breadboard wiring is shown

analogue input. The simplified block schematic 
of an eight-channel analogue input board is 
shown in Fig. 18.11. The circuit is based on a 
single MCP3008 eight-channel analogue-to-
digital converter (ADC). This handy chip from 
Microchip Technology uses a serial (rather 
than parallel) interface for connection to a host 
computer or microprocessor-based system. The 
pin connections for an MCP3008 are shown 
in Fig. 18.12. Note that there are two ground 
connections; one for analogue ground and one for 
digital ground. 
The MCP3008 is a 10-bit ADC with on-board 
sample and hold circuitry. The chip is 
programmable to provide either four pseudo-
differential input pairs or eight single-ended 
inputs. The chip is capable of conversion rates of 
up to 200,000 samples per second and it requires 
a supply of between 2.7 V and 5.5 V. Low-current 
design permits operation with typical standby 
currents of only 5 nA and typical active currents of 
320 µA. 
The range of analogue voltages that can be 
converted by the MCP3008 is determined by 
the voltage that appears at the reference voltage 
present at pin 15 of the device. Note that, as the 
reference input is reduced, the least significant bit 
(LSB) size is reduced. The size of the LSB can be 
calculated from:

in Figs 18.9 and 18.10, respectively, but do make 
sure that you power down the Raspberry Pi 
before building and connecting the circuit!
In the LED control circuit we will be using GPIO17 
(pin 11 of the GPIO connector) as an output and 
GPIO27 (pin 13 of the GPIO connector) as an 
input (note that if you are using a Version 1 board 
the signal at pin 13 will actually be GPIO21 – as 
discussed earlier!). Also note the use of a 10 kΩ 
pull-down resistor, R2, and a 1 kΩ input current 
limiting resistor, R3. This latter component 
ensures that the input current can never exceed 
3.3 mA under any circumstances.
In order to test the circuit you will need some 
simple Python code. Start your Raspberry Pi in 
the normal way and the use startx to begin a 
session with the GUI and then start the Python 
shell program by clicking on the IDLE icon. When 
the shell program has been initialized you will be 
presented with the usual >>> prompt. Now enter 
the following Python code as one long string of 
text:
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
import time
# Configure GPIO
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BOARD)
GPIO.setup(11, GPIO.OUT)  # LED as output
GPIO.setup(13, GPIO.IN)   # Switch as input
while True:
    # Read switch status
    switch_state = GPIO.input(13)
    if switch_state:
        # Switch contacts closed
        GPIO.output(11, True)
    else:
        # Switch contacts closed
        GPIO.output(11, False)
To exit from the program you will need to briefly 
press the Ctrl and C keys at the same time to exit.
Analogue-to-digital conversion 
and the SPI bus
Having demonstrated the ease by which digital 
inputs and outputs can be controlled by the 
Pi, it's time to quickly move on and take a look 
at the additional external circuitry needed in 
order to implement one or more channels of 

18  Electronic applications and the Raspberry Pi

This code will be sent via the SPI interface to 
the Raspberry Pi when the MCP3008's chip 
select line is taken low. The simplified internal 
block schematic of the MCP3008 is shown in 
Fig. 18.13. 
The SPI bus
Communication with the ADC is accomplished 
using a simple serial interface compatible with the 
Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) protocol. SPI is a 
communication bus that is used to interface one 
or more peripheral devices (known as slaves) to 
the computer, microprocessor or microcontroller 
(referred to as the master). A large number of 
SPI devices are available, including ADCs, digital-
to-analogue converters (DACs), GPIO expansion 
chips, temperature sensors and accelerometers. 
The bus is capable of operating at high speed 
(faster than the I2C bus) but it normally requires a

four-wire connection with one additional wire for 
each peripheral chip.
The SPI bus (sometimes also known as 
Synchronous Serial Interface or SSI) is a 
synchronous serial clocked bus capable of 
supporting data transfer in both directions (master 
to slave and slave to master) at the same time 
(this is referred to as 'full duplex' operation). The 
Raspberry Pi's SPI implementation uses four 
signal wires (plus ground). The signals are referred 
to as:
X
X SCLK (serial clock output from the master)
X
X MOSI (master output/slave input)
X
X MISO (master input/slave output)
X
X CSn (chip select output from the master).
The Raspberry Pi's two active-low chip select 
signals (CS0 and CS1) allow it to control up to 
two slave devices (the SPI bus is capable of 
supporting more than two devices but it requires 
a chip select line for each device). This should be 
contrasted with the Raspberry Pi's I2C interface 
Figure 18.13  Simplified internal block schematic of the MCP3008
that permits up to 127 devices to be connected 
using a two-wire (plus ground) interface. Finally, 
it is important to note that there is some variation 
in the naming of the SPI bus signals. In particular, 
the Humble Pi prototyping board (see Fig. 18.14) 
shows the two chip select lines, CS0 and CS1, as 
SPI0 and SPI1, respectively.
Eight-channel analogue input board
The complete circuit of the eight-channel 
analogue board is shown in Fig. 18.14. The 
reference voltage is derived from the 3.3 V 
supply rail (pins 14 and 15 on IC1 are linked 
together) while the analogue and digital ground 
connections (AGND and DGND) are connected 
to the common 0 V/ground rail. The 3.3 V supply 
is derived from a low-dropout voltage regulator, 
IC2. Note that when ordering a power supply kit 
for this particular application it is essential to use 
a 3.3 V regulator (such as an LD33V or equivalent) 
not a TTL-standard 5 V device. The four additional 
power supply components can be quickly and

Fig. 18.16). 
The eight analogue inputs to IC1 are taken to an 
18-way connector (P2). Two of the pins on this 
connector are connected to the 3.3 V positive

The eight-channel input board can be built using a 
low-cost prototyping board such as that available 
from Ciseco PLC and marketed as the Humble 
Pi. This board can be fitted with the 26-way 
connector (supplied with the board) so that the 
finished eight-channel analogue board sits piggy-
back style immediately above the Raspberry Pi.

analogue input board is shown in Fig. 18.16. 
Testing
The eight-channel analogue input board should be 
tested before use. The prototype can be tested 
using a potentiometer to provide a variable input 
voltage, as shown in Fig. 18.19. Depending on the 
setting of the slider of VR1 this arrangement will 
produce an input voltage in the range 0 V to 3.3 V 
(which should correspond to digital codes in the 
range 0 to 1023). Note that the allowable range of 

18  Electronic applications and the Raspberry Pi

input voltage for the circuit shown in Fig. 18.14 is 
0 V (minimum) to 3.3 V (maximum). To avoid the 
risk of damage to the MCP3008 it is essential that 
the input voltages present on IP1 to IP7 do not 
stray outside this range. The circuit of a simple 
input protection circuit (based on zener diodes) is 
shown in Fig. 18.21.
You will need to enter your code editor (or an 
IDE such as IDLE) before saving it to the folder 
in which you are currently storing your Python 
files. You might find it convenient to create a 
folder called Work_files on the desktop for storing 
your files, but you can save them in any other 
convenient location. To test the code you can 
start LXTerminal (or an equivalent terminal utility) 
and enter the appropriate command (using sudo to 
gain root privileges, as explained earlier).

while True:
    sensor_value = readadc(sensor_adc, SPICLK, SPIMOSI,

    print("Analogue input voltage = %5.3f V" % (sensor_voltage))
    time.sleep(0.5)
There are a few important things to note here. 
First, it is important to indent the code that 
forms the body of the loop which, in this case, 
will repeat indefinitely (you can easily break out 
of a loop by pressing the Ctrl and C keys at the 
same time). Second, the readadc() function is 
part of the gpiospiadc library module that we 
imported at the start of the code. If you forget to 
import modules (such as this one) the program 
will not run and you will be presented with a 
message warning you that the module cannot 
be found. Third, notice how we have to perform 
a little mathematics in order to convert the code 
returned from the ADC into a voltage. Fourth, 
because the sensor_voltage string can be rather 
long we have used some of Python's powerful 
string formatting features in order to produce a 
reading with just three decimal places (this is the 
function of the %5.3f in the penultimate line of 
code). Last, we need to update the display on a 
regular basis just in case the input voltage has 
changed. To do this we have used one of the 
time module's functions, i.e. time.sleep(0.5). The 
complete code for testing IP1 (the other channels 
can be tested by changing the value of sensor_
adc) of the eight-channel analogue interface is as 
follows:
#!/usr/bin/env python
import time
import os
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
from gpiospiadc import *
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BOARD)
DEBUG = 1
# Define pins on the GPIO connector
SPICLK = 23
SPIMISO = 21
SPIMOSI = 19
SPICS = 24
Programming the MCP3008 ADC
The GPIO SPI ADC library module provides  
access to the features of the MCP3008 ADC 
chip when connected through the GPIO port. 
The Python code is (not surprisingly) a little more 
complicated than when using the GPIO as a 
basic parallel port. As usual, we need to begin by 
importing the necessary library modules before 
we can configure the GPIO port lines and set 
up the SPI port. The following Python code (or 
something equivalent) will be required: 
import time
import os
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
from gpiospiadc import *
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BOARD)
DEBUG = 1
# Define pins on the GPIO connector
SPICLK = 23
SPIMISO = 21
SPIMOSI = 19
SPICS = 24
# Set up the SPI
GPIO.setup(SPIMOSI, GPIO.OUT)
GPIO.setup(SPIMISO, GPIO.IN)
GPIO.setup(SPICLK, GPIO.OUT)
GPIO.setup(SPICS, GPIO.OUT)
Note that the tricky job of handling the 
MCP3008's SPI interface to the Pi is covered by 
the gpiospiadc library module. Next, we need to 
specify the required input channel before entering 
a loop that will read the digital code from the 
selected ADC, convert this to a corresponding 
voltage string, and then print the results on the 
screen. The code that will do this can be written 
along the following lines:
Figure 18.19  Using a potentiometer to test the 
8-channel analogue input board

18  Electronic applications and the Raspberry Pi
352
This reads the value returned from Channel 
0 (IP1) of the ADC and then converts it to a 
corresponding voltage (sensor_voltage). It then 
converts the sensor voltage into a format that will 
produce a sensible display using the meter.config() 
function. The entire loop is repeated every 200 ms 
until the user closes the display window (at which 
point the program terminates). The code is shown 
below:

def measure():

    # get the current voltage from the SPI device
    sensor_value = readadc(sensor_adc, SPICLK, SPIMOSI,  
SPIMISO, SPICS)
    sensor_voltage = (sensor_value * 3.3)/1024
    voltage2 = sensor_voltage
    sv = '%.3f' % sensor_voltage
    # if the voltage has changed, update it
    if voltage2 != voltage1:
        voltage1 = voltage2
        meter.config(text=sv)
    # update the display every 200ms
    meter.after(200, measure)

while True:
    sensor_value = readadc(sensor_adc, SPICLK, SPIMOSI,

    sensor_voltage = (sensor_value * 3.3)/1024
    print("Analogue input voltage = %5.3f V" % (sensor_voltage))
    time.sleep(0.5)
Finally, don't forget that you will need to run this 
code as a superuser (SUDO will give you access 
to the root privileges that are needed in order to 
make use of the GPIO library module). 
Raspberry Pi application: a simple 
voltmeter
Now, to put this into practice let's look at a simple 
(but nevertheless useful) real-world application in 
the form of a simple digital voltmeter based on 
the eight-channel analogue input board. In addition 
to the Humble Pi board, all we need is a few 
lines of Python code using TkInter as a means of 
providing a friendly graphical user interface. 
At the start of the code we need to import 
the required library modules (in this case we 
need access to five of them, including TkInter). 
Next we've defined a root window (every GUI 
program must have one of these) and given it 
a title (VOLTS). This makes it look a bit more 
impressive than just the default (tk). Within the 
root window, and so that our voltmeter display is 
easily readable, we've increased the font size to 
36 and used Arial font (in black) against a green 
background (as shown in Fig. 18.20).
In the main loop of the program we've used a 
user-defined function (UDF) called measure(). 
Figure 18.20  Digital voltmeter display

18  Electronic applications and the Raspberry Pi
353
The simple digital voltmeter caters for input 
voltages ranging from a few tens of millivolts up 
to about 3.3 V but, where necessary, a simple 
potential divider can be used at the input in order 
to extend the range. It might also be sensible to 
provide some protection at the input of the ADC 
by connecting a 3.3 V zener diode across the 
input, as shown in Fig. 18.21.
Raspberry Pi application: 
resistance measurement
Now let's move on to look at a slightly more 
complex application in the form of a digital 
ohmmeter. In this application we need to be able 
to produce a reasonably accurate indication of the 
resistance of an unknown component. In order 
to do this we need to apply a known value of 
current (and keep this constant) to the unknown 
component. If we can do this we can use the 
voltage drop that appears across the unknown 
component in order to determine its resistance 
value. This principle is illustrated in Fig. 18.22.
A simple but effective constant current source 
can be built using just two transistors, as shown 
in Fig. 18.23. The circuit delivers a nominal 
current of 1 mA (adjustable by means of RV1). 
To calibrate the digital ohmmeter a resistor with 
an accurately known resistance (e.g. 1 kΩ ± 1%) 
should be connected to the input terminals and 
RV1 should be adjusted for a resistance indication 
of exactly 1,000 Ω. The pin connections for

the two 2N5401 PNP transistors are shown in 
Fig. 18.24.
The range of resistance that can be measured 
reasonably accurately with this arrangement 
extends from less than 100 Ω to around 2.5 kΩ. 
Outside this range there will be a need to make 
a corresponding change to the value of the

constant current. For example, a current source of 
10 mA would be required in order to extend the 
measuring range from around 10 Ω to 250 Ω.
The Python code for a simple ohmmeter is shown 
below. This follows along the same lines as the 
digital voltmeter application that we described 
earlier and once again it uses the TkInter library 
module as a means of providing a friendly GUI. 
At the start of the code we need to import 
the required library modules (in this case we 
need access to five of them, including TkInter). 
Next, we define a root window (every GUI 
program must have one of these) and give it 
a title (kOHM). This makes it look a bit more 
impressive than just the default, tk. Within the 
root window, and so that our voltmeter display is 
easily readable, we've increased the font size to 
36 and used Arial font (in black) against a green 
background (as shown in Fig. 18.25).
As for the voltmeter code described earlier, we've 
used a UDF called measure() in the main body of 
the loop. This UDF reads the value returned from 
Channel 0 (IP1) of the ADC and then converts it 
to a corresponding resistance (sensor_resistance). 
It then converts the sensor voltage into a format 
that will produce a sensible display using the 
meter.config() function. The entire loop is repeated 
every 200 ms until the user closes the display 
window (at which point the program terminates). 
The code is shown below:

with an accuracy better than ±2 °C and typically 
±1 °C at +25 °C. Usefully, each of the sensors 
in the range produces an output voltage that is 
linearly proportional to the Celsius (centigrade) 
temperature, as illustrated by Fig. 18.26. All three 
devices are available in low-cost three-lead TO-92, 
eight-lead SOIC_N and five-lead SOT-23 surface-
mount packages and they are thus ideal for 
building into miniature probes.
The TMP35 is intended for single-supply operation 
from 2.7 V to 5.5 V maximum and it is thus 
eminently suitable for operation from the Pi's 
+3.3 V supply. To avoid the risks associated with 
Raspberry Pi application: 
temperature measurement and 
data logging
Now let's look at how we can very easily 
interface a temperature sensor to the eight-
channel analogue input port. This will allow you 
to sense temperatures with a reasonable degree 
of accuracy and then either display the current 
temperature or save it to a file for later analysis.
The TMP35 chip that we will be using for 
temperature sensing is one of a family of 
devices that together are capable of covering 
a temperature range from −40 °C to +125 °C

self-heating, the chip requires only a very small 
supply current (well below 50 μA). In addition, 
a shut-down function is provided that limits the 
residual supply current to less than 0.5 μA. 
The TMP35 provides an output of 250 mV at 
25 °C and is suitable for sensing temperatures 
in the range +10 °C to +125 °C. Other devices in 
the series are specified from −40°C to +125°C 
(TMP36) and +5 °C to +100 °C (TMP37). The 
TMP36 provides an output voltage of 750 mV 
output at +25 °C while the TMP37 produces 
500 mV at the same temperature (see Fig. 18.26). 
Just in case you need to use a different sensor 
we've summarized the characteristics of all three 
of these useful temperature sensors in Table 18.4. 
The interface to the eight-channel analogue 
port (see Fig. 18.27) is extremely simple and no 
other components are required apart from the 
temperature sensor. The pin connections for 
TMP35, TMP36 and TMP37 temperature sensors 
are shown in Fig. 18.28. 
Some typical Python code for temperature 
indication is shown below:

sensor_voltage, sensor_temperature))
    time.sleep(0.5)
Data logging
Finally, here's a complete data-logging application 
in which we capture and store temperature data 
and save it in a comma-separate values (CSV) 
file for later analysis. We've provided prompts 
to request a filename from the user (and then 
added a .CSV extension) as well as the number 
of samples to take and the interval between the

to monitor the temperature every minute for one 
hour would require 60 samples with an interval of

to eliminate false and/or rapidly changing readings 
the program waits for two identical sensor values 
to be returned before appending them to the data 
in the CSV file. Fig. 18.29 shows some typical 
captured data displayed in graphical form using a 
popular spreadsheet program.

specialized DAC chips, such as the Microchip 
MCP4725. This is a single-channel, low-power 
12-bit DAC which uses an I2C interface to a host 
controller. The MCP4725 incorporates an internal 
non-volatile EEPROM memory, allowing the 
chip to retain its digital input when the power 
is turned off. This feature makes it possible for 
the analogue output voltage to be retained so 
that it becomes immediately available without 
reprogramming each time the power is turned 
on. The simplified internal arrangement of the 
MCP4725 is shown in Fig. 18.30. 
The MCP4725 is supplied in a tiny SOT-23-6 
package and it uses the pin connections 
shown in Fig. 18.31. Since the chip is rather 
small and designed for surface mounting we 
recommend that you make use of the MCP4725 
daughter board supplied by Adafruit Industries 
(see Fig. 18.32). This board can be fitted with 
a standard 0.1" spaced PCB header and this 
will make connection much easier and with 
significantly reduced chance of misconnection. 
    sensor_voltage = (sensor_value * 3.3)/1024
    sensor_temperature = (sensor_voltage - 0.5) * 100

        writer.writerow([count] + [sensor_data])
    time.sleep(int(interval))
    count = count + 1
print('Finished - ' + str(count - 1) + ' samples collected')
Finally, don't forget that you will need to run all 
of the code described with superuser privileges. 
For example, if your Python3 program code is 
saved as temperature.py in a folder called Work_
files on your desktop, the command to execute 
the program from the terminal program (e.g. 
LXTerminal) would be:
sudo python3 /home/pi/Desktop/Work_files/temperature.py

The interface circuit and pin connections for the 
Adafruit board are shown in Figs. 18.33 and 18.34, 
respectively.
The MCP4725 is designed for operation over 
the voltage range 2.7 V to 5.5 V and thus will be 
comfortable with the 3.3 V supply available from 
the Raspberry Pi's GPIO connector. 
The I2C bus
In addition to SPI that we used earlier for the ADC 
application, the Raspberry Pi provides you with 
an alternative method of connecting to external 
devices by means of its 'Inter-Integrated Circuit' 
interface (abbreviated variously as IIC, I2C, I2C 
or I-squared-C) and communication with the 
MCP4725 is accomplished using this two-wire 
protocol. 
I2C is a very simple bus system where 
bidirectional data appear on a single line (SDA) 
and a clock signal is sent on a second bus line 
(SCL). SPI, on the other hand, offers a point-to-
point connection where the data are passed in 
and out on separate lines (MOSI and MISO). SPI 
is faster and generally easier to use than I2C but 
there can often be situations like this in which I2C 
is preferred simply because this is the interface 
that's built into the chip that you need to use.
I2C was the brainchild of Philips, but several of 
its competitors (including Motorola/Freescale, 
NEC, Siemens, STM and Texas Instruments) 
have developed their own I2C-compatible 
products. In addition, Intel's SMBus provides 
a stricter definition of I2C intended to improve 
the interoperability of I2C devices from different 
manufacturers. 
Since the data line is shared between multiple 
devices, I2C uses a system of addressing in 
order to identify the device that it needs to 
communicate with. Communication is initiated by 
means of a unique start sequence. This involves 
pulling the data line (SDA) low while the clock 
line (SCL) is high. This can be achieved by using 
very simple bus interface logic where each of the 
bus lines are normally pulled high and driven low 
when activated by a device connected to the bus 
(see Fig. 18.36). 
Fig. 18.37 shows a simple bus transaction which 
begins with a start condition, S, and ends with a 
stop condition, P. Note how the transaction starts 
and ends with the bus lines in their quiescent high 
state.

Figure 18.37  I2C bus transaction showing how 
first address and then data is placed on the bus
Following the start sequence, transmitted data 
is only allowed to change when the clock is in 
its low state. In its basic form, and by virtue 
of the seven bits available for addressing, the 
I2C protocol caters for a total of 127 devices. In 
addition to the seven bits used for addressing, 
the first byte of an I2C transfer generated 
by a master includes a bit that indicates the 
direction of the data transfer. The address is 
transferred with the most significant bit first (see 
Fig. 18.37).
The analogue output voltage can vary over the 
full supply voltage range (0 V to +3.3 V with the 
arrangement shown in Fig. 18.33). The output 
current should be limited to a few mA, but we 
will later show how this limitation (as well as the 
limited voltage range) can be easily overcome 
with the aid of a simple external amplifier).
Since the MCP4725 is a 12-bit DAC it will operate 
with digital codes over the range 000000000000 
to 111111111111 (corresponding to denary 
values extending from 0 to 4095). With a 3.3 V 
supply, the smallest code (000000000000) will 
correspond to an analogue output voltage of 
0 V while the largest code (111111111111) will 
correspond to an analogue output of 3.3 V. This 
relationship yields the following:

Note that, as explained earlier, for a Rev.2 board 
you will need to enter this command as:
sudo i2c detect –y 1
A typical display produced by this command 
is shown in Fig. 18.38. The display shows the 
mapping of 128 addresses within the I2C space 
(but note that a few addresses are reserved 
for special purposes so that not all of the 128 
possible addresses can be mapped to I2C 
devices). If you look carefully at the display you 
will see that address 62 (hex.) has been mapped 
to the MCP4725 device and so we are now ready 
to start using it!
I2C from the command line
The i2c-tools package provides you with a handy 
command that allows you to send data to an I2C 
device. The command is i2cset and it is followed 
by three bytes of data. The first of these bytes 
is the address of the I2C device, while the 
second and third bytes are the data to be sent in 
conventional order (high-byte followed by low-
byte). Here is a brief walkthrough that shows 
how you can use the i2cset command. For the 
purposes of this exercise we've assumed that 
you have the MCP4725 DAC connected to your 
Pi as shown in Fig. 18.33 and that you have a d.c. 
voltmeter connected to the two analogue output 
terminals.

DAC register in Fig. 18.30. 
Programming the MCP4725 DAC
In order to make use of the I2C interface you 
will need to have the i2c-tools package installed 
in your Raspberry Pi. In most current Debian 
distributions the package will already be installed, 
but if you do need to install the package you can 
use sudo apt-get install i2c-tools from the system 
prompt. Then, following installation, you should 
add a new user to the i2c group using sudo 
adduser pi i2c before rebooting the system using 
sudo shutdown –r now. Note that you will not need 
to do any of this if you already have i2c-tools 
installed.
Now, to check for I2C devices connected to your 
Raspberry Pi you will need to use i2cdetect from 
within LXTerminal (or equivalent) as follows:
sudo i2c detect –y 0

I2C and Raspberry Pi board revisions
The Raspberry Pi supports two I2C channels, 0 
and 1. However, on the more recent Raspberry 
Pi revision (Rev.2) the primary and secondary 
I2C channels have been reversed. On Rev.1 (and 
earlier) boards the physical connections to the I2C 
channels are as shown in Table 18.5 but on the 
Rev.2 boards they are as shown in Table 18.6. 
To facilitate the additional I/O present on Rev.2 
boards a new connector, P5, can be fitted. The 
connecting pads for P5 are located immediately 
adjacent to the GPIO connector, P1. P5 makes 
available four additional GPIO signals, together 
with power. The pin assignment for P5 is shown 
in Table 18.7.
If you are unsure of which revision you have 
you can determine a board's revision status by 
entering the following at the command line: cat 
/proc/cpuinfo. This will show you the hardware 
revision code for the board in question and this 
can be used to determine the board's revision 
number (see Tables 18.5 and 18.6).
First, it's worth checking that the I2C device is 
connected and verifying the address that has 
been allocated to it:
i2cdetect –y 0
This should show you the address of the 
MCP4725 within the I2C address range (see 
Fig. 18.38). In our case this appeared as 62 hex. 
(i.e. 0x62). If your address is not the same (e.g. 
0x60) you will need to change the first byte of 
data in each of the commands that follow. Note 
also that if you are using a Rev.2 Raspberry Pi the 
command should be changed to:
i2cdetect –y 1
Now we will set the DAC output to its maximum 
value of 3.3 V. To do this we will need to use a 
digital code of 4095 denary, 111111111111 binary 
or 0FFF hexadecimal:
i2cset –y 0 0x62 0x0f 0xff
Next we will set the DAC output back to 0 V and 
check that the voltage has returned to zero. To 
do this we will need a digital code of 0 denary, 
000000000000 binary or 0000 hexadecimal:
i2cset –y 0 0x62 0x00 0x00
Finally, let's set the DAC to 1 V (or as near 
as we can get). To do this we can calculate 
the value using the relationship that we 
introduced earlier. The required data are 
1232 denary, 010011010000 binary or 04D0 
hexadecimal:
i2cset –y 0 0x62 0x04 0xd0
Important note: the use of the i2cset command 
in each of the foregoing fragments of code 
assumes that you are dealing with the use of a 
Rev.1 board. If you are using a Rev.2 board the 
I2C channel numbers should be changed from 
0 to 1 (as mentioned earlier for the i2cdetect 
command). 
If you've managed to follow these steps you are 
well on the way to making good use of the I2C 
interface. Next we will show you how to use 
Python to do the job in a much more elegant 
manner!
In order to access the features of the I2C bus from 
within Python you can use one of the I2C libraries 
such as that available from Adafruit Industries 
(Adafruit_I2C). These libraries are designed to 
support the generic framework for an I2C device

but need to be augmented by supplementary 
libraries for specific I2C devices, such as I2C_DAC.
PY from Adafruit. Another complication is that 
many of these libraries are designed to run with 
Python 2.7 and may currently not be compatible 
with version 3.x. All of this makes life rather 
difficult so we've decided to opt for a more simple 
approach that makes use of operating system 
sub-process calls directly from our Python code. 
Here is a fragment of code (written using Python 
3.x) that uses a sub-process call to set the 
analogue output from the DAC to approximately 
1.86 V:
import subprocess
return_code = subprocess.call(["i2cset –y 0 0x62 0x09 0x00"],  
shell = True)
print(return_code)
This code is somewhat cryptic and needs an 
explanation. Before we can make use of the 
subprocess.call() function we need to import 
the subprocess library. The call requires several 
parameters, the first of which is the i2cset 
command from the i2c-tools library. Note how 
this command is enclosed in quotation marks (it 
is a literal string). The subprocess.call() generates 
a return code that can be used to let the Python

code know whether the command has executed 
successfully. If the return code is 1 this tells 
us that an error has occurred, but if it is 0 the 
command has been successfully executed. 
We've used the print() function at the end of the 
code fragment just to check that no errors have 
occurred, but in a practical application we would, 
of course, need to provide a more meaningful 
error message.
Raspberry Pi application: 
a stepped voltage generator
Now let's look at a practical example of using the 
DAC. Let's suppose that we need to generate a 
voltage that rises in ten steps of 0.3 V, from 0 V 
to 3 V, remaining at each step for two seconds 
before moving on to the next. Because the digital 
code is stored in the DAC's internal memory we 
need to ensure that the output voltage goes back 
to 0 V at the end of the cycle. The required digital 
codes are as shown in Table 18.9.
One possible solution might be to incorporate 
the digital codes from Table 18.9 into a list and 
then use the subprocess.call() function in ten 
separate lines of code, but this would be rather 
cumbersome. A more elegant solution would 
be to use a loop in which Python calculates the 
required digital code for each step and then 
builds a command string that can be sent via the 
subprocess.call() function. Fortunately, this isn't 
quite as difficult as it might sound and here's

voltage = 0
while True:
    value = input("Output voltage: ")
    voltage = float(value)
    while voltage >= 0 and voltage < 3.3:
        volts = voltage *  4096 / 3.3
        code = int(volts)
        first = int(code / 255)
        second = code - (first * 256)
        value1 = format(first, '#04x')
        value2 = format(second, '#04x')

        return_code = subprocess.call([command_string], 
shell=True)
        if return_code == 0:
            print("Success - output now set to ", value + " V")
        else:
            print("Error setting DAC - output not changed!")
        voltage = -1   
The main points of the program are as follows:
1.	 Prompt the user for the required output 
voltage and convert the input to a floating 
point number.
2.	 Check that the user's input is within the 
acceptable range (0 V to +3.3 V).
3.	 Convert the floating point value into two 
hexadecimal bytes.
4.	 Insert the two hexadecimal bytes into the 
i2cset() command string.
5.	 Make the subprocess.call(0).
6.	 Check the return code and warn the user if an 
error is detected.

easily it can be done:
# Import the required libraries

import subprocess
# Initial voltage = 0V
voltage = 0

while step < 10:
    voltage = step * voltage
    # Calculate the digital code
    volts = voltage *  4096 / 3.3
    # Convert the digital code to two bytes
    code = int(volts)
    first = int(code / 255)
    second = code - (first * 256)
    # Format the two hexadecimal values
    value1 = format(first, '#04x')
    value2 = format(second, '#04x')
    # Build the command string
    command_string = "i2cset -y 0 0x62 " + value1 + " " + value2
    # Make the sub-process call
    return_code = subprocess.call([command_string], shell=True)
    # Hold the voltage steady for two seconds
    time.sleep(2)  
    # Increment the step counter
    step = step + 1
# After exiting the loop set the output back to 0V
command_string = "i2cset -y 0 0x62 0x00 0x00"
return_code = subprocess.call([command_string], shell=True)
The voltage waveform generated by the Python 
ramp generator code is shown in Fig. 18.39.

Practical investigation 
Objective 
To build a simple two-way traffic-light controller 
based on a Raspberry Pi microcomputer. The 
traffic lights are to represent those at a UK cross-
roads and must show the correct sequence of 
lights (red, amber and green) at suitable intervals. 
Components and test equipment
Raspberry Pi with display, a.c. power supply, 
keyboard and mouse. Breadboard. Six light 
emitting diodes (two red, two amber and two 
green) and six 270 Ω 0.25 W resistors. Assorted 
jumper wires. 
Getting started
After constructing the breadboard components 
(six LEDs and series resistors) a good starting 
point is to construct a state diagram and/or flow 
chart in order to illustrate the correct sequence 
of lights, then assign each of the six lights to a 
different GPIO line. To help with the software 
development, the following fragment of Python 
code shows how a single set of three LED traffic 
lights can be operated in an endless loop. Note 
how the time library module is imported at the 
outset and then used to produce the necessary 
timing delays by means of time.sleep(). The 
sample code fragment can be easily modified 
and extended in order to operate a second set of 
lights.

CHAPTER19
Circuit construction
Chapter summary
This chapter deals with the techniques used to produce a working circuit 
from an initial ‘paper design’ to a working circuit ready for testing and 
performance measurement. Various methods are used for building 
electronic circuits. The method that’s actually chosen for a particular 
application depends on a number of factors, including the available 
resources and the scale of production.

use tag strips and group boards, point-to-point 
wiring is not a particularly attractive construction 
method these days!
Breadboard construction
Breadboard construction is often used for 
assembling and testing simple circuits prior 
to production of a more permanent circuit 
using a stripboard or printed circuit board. The 
advantage of this technique is that changes can 
be quickly and easily made to a circuit and all of 
the components can be re-used. The obvious 
disadvantages of breadboard construction are 
that it is unsuitable for permanent use and also 
unsuitable for complex circuits (i.e. circuits with 
more than half a dozen or so active devices or 
integrated circuits). Fig. 19.2 shows the simple 
bistable circuit that you met in Chapter 10 
assembled and ready for testing.
Matrix board construction
Fig. 19.3 shows matrix board construction. 
This low-cost technique avoids the need for a 
printed circuit but is generally only suitable for 
one-off prototypes. A matrix board consists of 
an insulated board into which a matrix of holes 
are drilled with copper tracks arranged as strips 
on the reverse side of the board. Component 
leads are inserted through the holes and soldered 
into place. Strips (or tracks) are linked together 
with a short length of tinned copper wire (inserted 
through holes in the board and soldered into 
place on the underside of the board). Tracks 
can be broken at various points as appropriate. 
The advantage of this technique is that it avoids 
the need for a printed circuit board (which may 
be relatively expensive and may take some 
time to design). Disadvantages of matrix board 
construction are that it is usually only suitable for 
one-off production and the end result is invariably 
less compact than a printed circuit board. The 
matrix board shown in Fig. 19.3 is a simple 
oscilloscope calibrator based on a PIC16F84.
Printed circuit boards
Printed circuit board construction (see Fig. 19.4) 
technique is ideal for volume manufacture of 
electronic circuits where speed and repeatability 
of production are important. Depending on the 
Techniques used for large-scale electronic 
manufacture generally involve fully automated 
assembly using equipment that can produce 
complex circuits quickly and accurately and at 
very low cost with minimal human intervention. 
On the other extreme, if only one circuit is to be 
built then a hand-built prototype is much more 
appropriate. It’s also worth noting that, when a 
circuit is designed for a commercial application 
it will invariably be tested using computer 
simulation techniques before a prototype is 
manufactured (see Chapter 16). It’s also possible 
for the computer simulation to output data that 
can be used by CNC equipment to manufacture 
a printed circuit board on which the real circuit 
will be assembled. These techniques have been 
instrumental in significantly reducing the time 
taken to get a prototype electronic circuit off the 
computer screen and into production.
We begin with a quick introduction to the different 
methods of circuit construction before looking in 
greater detail at the stages involved in the layout 
and manufacture of stripboards and printed circuit 
boards. Consideration is also given to the correct 
choice of enclosure and connectors as this is 
crucial in making the finished equipment both 
functional and attractive. The chapter also deals 
with soldering and desoldering techniques and 
the selection of heatsinks.
Circuit construction methods
There are several different ways of building an 
electronic circuit. The method that you choose 
depends on a number of factors, including the 
resources available to you and whether you are 
building a ‘one-off’ prototype or a large number of 
identical circuits. The methods that are available 
to you include:
Point-to-point wiring
With the advent of miniature components, printed 
circuit boards and integrated circuits, point-to-
point wiring construction is a technique that is 
nowadays considered obsolete. The example 
shown in Fig. 19.1 is the underside of a valve 
amplifier chassis dating back to the early 1960s. 
Unless you are dealing with a very small number 
of components or have a particular desire to 

19  Circuit construction

tinned copper wire (of appropriate gauge) or short 
lengths of PVC-insulated ‘hook-up’ or equipment 
wire.
Like their matrix board counterparts, stripboards 
are also pierced with a matrix of holes which, 
again, are almost invariably placed on a 0.1 in 
pitch. The important difference, however, is 
that stripboards have copper strips bounded to 
one surface which link together rows of holes 
along the complete length of the board. The 
result, therefore, is something of a compromise 
between a ‘naked’ matrix board and a true printed 
circuit. Compared with the matrix board, the 
stripboard has the advantage that relatively few 
wire links are required and that components can 
be mounted and soldered directly to the copper 
strips without the need for terminal pins. 
Conventional types of stripboard (those with 
parallel runs of strips throughout the entire board 
surface) are generally unsuitable for relatively 
complex circuitry of the type associated with 
microprocessor systems. Fortunately, several 
manufacturers have responded with special- 
purpose stripboards. These have strips arranged 
in groups which not only permit the mounting 
of DIL integrated circuits (including the larger 
28-pin and 40-pin types) but are also available in 
a standard range of ‘card’ sizes (both single and 
double-sided and with and without plated through 
holes). Boards designed for prototyping using 
integrated circuits also tend to have sensibly 
arranged strips for supply distribution together 
with edge connectors (either direct or indirect 
types) for use with microprocessor bus systems.
Stripboard layout techniques
The following steps are required when laying out 
a circuit for stripboard construction:
  1.	 Carefully examine a copy of the circuit 
diagram. 
  2.	 Mark all components to be mounted ‘off-
board’ and identify (using appropriate letters 
and/or numbers, e.g. SK, pin-2) all points 
at which an ‘off-board’ connection is to be 
made.
  3.	 Identify any multiple connections required 
between integrated circuits or between 
complexity of a circuit, various types of printed 
circuit board are possible. The most basic form 
of printed circuit (and one which is suitable for 
home construction) has copper tracks on one side 
and components mounted on the other. More 
complex printed circuit boards have tracks on 
both sides (they are referred to as ‘double-sided’) 
while boards with up to four layers are used for 
some of the most sophisticated and densely 
packed electronic equipment (for example, 
computer motherboards). The double-sided 
printed circuit board shown in Fig. 19.4 is part 
of an instrument landing system (ILS) fitted to a 
passenger aircraft. A further example of printed 
circuit construction is shown in Fig. 19.5. This 
shows ‘zig-zag’ inductive components fabricated 
using the copper track surface together with 
leadless ‘chip’ capacitors and a leadless transistor 
which is soldered directly to the surface of the 
copper track.
Surface mounting
Fig. 19.6 shows an example of surface mounting 
construction. This technique is suitable for 
sub-miniature leadless components. These are 
designed for automated soldering directly to pads 
on the surface of a printed circuit board. This 
technique makes it possible to pack the largest 
number of components into the smallest space 
but, since the components require specialized 
handling and soldering equipment, it is not 
suitable for home construction nor is it suitable 
for hand-built prototypes. The example shown in 
Fig. 19.6 is part of the signal processing circuitry 
used in a computer monitor.
Using matrix boards and 
stripboards
Matrix boards and stripboards are ideal for 
simple prototype and one-off electronic circuit 
construction. The distinction between matrix 
boards and stripboards is simply that the former 
has no copper tracks and the user has to make 
extensive use of press-fit terminal pins which 
are used for component connection. Extensive 
inter-wiring is then necessary to link terminal pins 
together. This may be carried out using sleeved

integrated circuits and connectors. Arrange 
such components in physical proximity and 
with such orientation that will effectively 
minimize the number of links required.
 4. Identify components that require special 
attention (such as those which require 
heatsinks or have special screening 
requirements). Ensure that such components 
are positioned sensibly bearing in mind their 
particular needs.
 5. Keep inputs and outputs at opposite ends of 
the stripboard. This not only helps maintain a 
logical circuit layout (progressing from input 
to output) but, in high gain circuits, it may 
also be instrumental in preventing instability 
due to unwanted feedback.
 6. Use standard sizes of stripboard wherever 
possible. Where boards have to be cut to 

19  Circuit construction

(or within the same package) in order to 
minimize strip usage and links. (If you have to 
resort to this dodge, do not forget to amend 
the circuit diagram!)
When the stripboard layout is complete, it is 
important to carefully check it against the circuit 
diagram. Not only can this save considerable 
frustration at a later stage but it can be 
instrumental in preventing some costly mistakes. 
In particular, one should follow the positive supply 
and 0 V (or ‘ground’) strips and check that all chips 
and other devices have supplies. The technique 
employed by the author involves the use of 
coloured pencils that are used to trace the circuit 
and stripboard layout; associating each line in the 
circuit diagram with a physical interconnection on 
the stripboard. Colours are used as follows:
	
Positive supply rails	
Red
	
Negative supply rails	
Black
	
Common 0 V rail	
Green
	
Analogue signals	
Yellow/pink
	
Digital signals	
White/grey
	
Off-board connections	
Orange/violet
	
Mains wiring	
Brown and blue
Assembly of the stripboard is happily a quite 
straightforward process. The sequence used 
for stripboard assembly will normally involve 
mounting IC sockets first followed by transistors, 
diodes, resistors, capacitors and other passive 
components. Finally, terminal pins and links 
should be fitted before making the track breaks. 
On completion, the board should be carefully 
checked, paying particular attention to all 
polarized components (e.g. diodes, transistors 
and electrolytic capacitors). Fig. 19.7 shows a 
typical stripboard layout together with matching 
component overlay.
Using printed circuits
Printed circuit boards (PCBs) comprise copper 
tracks bonded to an epoxy glass or synthetic resin 
bonded paper (SRBP) board. The result is a neat 
and professional-looking circuit that is ideal for 
prototype as well as production quantities. Printed 
circuits can easily be duplicated or modified 
from original master artwork and the production 
size, it is usually more efficient to align the 
strips along the major axis of the board.
  7.	 Consider the means of mounting the 
stripboard. If it is to be secured using bolts 
and threaded spacers (or equivalent) it will 
be necessary to allow adequate clearance 
around the mounting holes.
  8.	 Produce a rough layout for the stripboard first 
using paper ruled with squares, the corners 
of the squares representing the holes in the 
stripboard. This process can be carried out 
‘actual size’ using 0.1 inch graph paper or 
suitably enlarged by means of an appropriate 
choice of paper. For preference, it is wise 
to choose paper with a faint blue or green 
grid as this will subsequently disappear after 
photocopying, leaving you with a ‘clean’ 
layout.
  9.	 Identify all conductors that will be handling 
high currents (i.e. those in excess of 1 A) and 
use adjacent strips connected in parallel at 
various points along the length of the board.
10.	 Identify the strips that will be used to convey 
the supply rails: as far as possible these 
should be continuous from one end of the 
board to the other. It is often convenient 
to use adjacent strips for supply and 0 V 
(or ‘ground’) since decoupling capacitors 
can easily be distributed at strategic points. 
Ideally, such capacitors should be positioned 
in close proximity to the positive supply input 
pin to all integrated circuits which are likely to 
demand sudden transient currents (e.g. 555 
timers, comparators, IC power amplifiers).
11.	 In high-frequency circuits, link all unused 
strips to 0 V at regular points. This promotes 
stability by ensuring that the 0 V rail is 
effective as a common rail.
12.	 Minimize, as far as possible, the number of 
links required. These should be made on the 
upper (component) side of the stripboard. 
Only in exceptional cases should links be 
made on the underside (foil side) of the 
board.
13.	 Experiment with positioning of integrated 
circuits (it is good practice, though not 
essential, to align them all in the same 
direction). In some cases, logic gates may 
be exchanged from package to package

 5. Use the minimum board area consistent with 
a layout which is uncramped. In practice, and 
to prevent wastage, you should aim to utilize 
as high a proportion of the PCB surface area 
as possible. In the initial stages, however, it 
is wise to allow some room for manoeuvre 
as there will doubtless be subsequent 
modifications to the design.
 6. Unless the design makes extensive use of 
PCB edge connectors, try to ensure that a 
common 0 V foil is run all round the periphery 
of the PCB. This has a number of advantages, 
not the least of which is the fact that it will 
then be relatively simple to find a route to the 
0 V rail from almost anywhere on the board.
 7. Consider the means of mounting the PCB 
and, if it is to be secured using bolts and 
threaded spacers (or equivalent) you should 
ascertain the number and location of the 
holes required. You may also wish to ensure 
that the holes are coincident with the 0 V foil; 
alternatively where the 0 V rail is not to be 
taken to chassis ground, it will be necessary 
to ensure that the PCB mounting holes occur 
in an area of the PCB that is clear of foil.
 8. Commence the PCB design in rough 
first using paper ruled with squares. This 
process can be carried out ‘actual size’ using 
0.1 inch graph paper or suitably enlarged by 
means of an appropriate choice of paper. 
techniques are quite simple and should thus not 
deter the enthusiast working from home.
The following steps should be followed when 
laying out a PCB:
 1. Carefully examine a copy of the circuit 
diagram. Mark all components which are to 
be mounted ‘off-board’ and, using appropriate 
letters and/or numbers (e.g. SK1, pin-2), 
identify all points at which an ‘off-board’ 
connection is to be made.
 2. Identify any multiple connections (e.g. bus 
lines) required between integrated circuits 
or between integrated circuits and edge 
connectors. Arrange such components in 
physical proximity and with such orientation 
that will effectively minimize the number of 
links required.
 3. Identify components that require special 
attention (such as those that require 
heatsinks or have special screening 
requirements). Ensure that such components 
are positioned sensibly, bearing in mind their 
particular needs.
 4. Keep inputs and outputs at opposite ends 
of the PCB wherever possible. This not 
only helps maintain a logical circuit layout 
(progressing from input) but, in high gain 
circuits, it may also be instrumental in 
preventing instability due to unwanted 
feedback.

page 281

14.	 Fill unused areas of PCB with ‘land’ (areas 
of foil which should be linked to 0 V). This 
helps ensure that the 0 V rail is effective as a 
common rail, minimizes use of the etchant, 
helps to conduct heat away from heat-
producing components, and furthermore, 
is essential in promoting stability in high-
frequency applications.
15.	 Lay out the 0 V and positive supply rails first, 
then turn your attention to linking to the pads 
or edge connectors used for connecting the 
off-board components. Minimize, as far as 
possible, the number of links required. Do not 
use links in the 0 V rail and avoid using them 
in the positive supply rail.
16.	 Experiment with positioning of integrated 
circuits (it is good practice, though not 
essential, to align them all in the same 
direction). In some cases, logic gates may 
be exchanged from package to package 
(or within the same package) in order to 
minimize track runs and links. (If you have to 
resort to this dodge, do not forget to amend 
the circuit diagram.)
17.	 Be aware of the pin spacing used by 
components and try to keep this consistent 
throughout. With the exception of the larger 
wirewound resistors (which should be 
mounted on ceramic stand-off pillars) axial 
lead components should be mounted flat 
against the PCB (with their leads bent at right 
For preference, it is wise to choose paper 
with a faint blue or green grid as this will 
subsequently disappear after photocopying, 
leaving you with a ‘clean’ layout.
  9.	 Using the square grid as a guide, try to 
arrange all components so that they are 
mounted on the standard 0.1 inch matrix. 
This may complicate things a little but is 
important if you should subsequently wish 
to convert the design using computer-aided 
design (CAD) techniques (see later). 
10.	 Arrange straight runs of track so that they 
align with one dimension of the board or 
another. Try to avoid haphazard track layout.
11.	 Identify all conductors that will be handling 
significant current (i.e. in excess of about 
500 mA) and ensure that tracks have 
adequate widths. Table 19.1 will act as a 
rough guide. Note that, as a general rule, the 
width of the 0 V track should be at least twice 
that used for any other track.
12.	 Identify all conductors that will be handling 
high voltages (i.e. those in excess of 150 V 
d.c. or 100 V r.m.s. a.c.) and ensure that 
these are adequately spaced from other 
tracks. Table 19.2 provides you with a rough 
guide.
13.	 Identify the point at which the principal 
supply rail is to be connected. Employ 
extra wide track widths (for both the 0 V 
and supply rail) in this area and check 
that suitable decoupling capacitors are 
placed as close as possible to the point 
of supply connection. Check that other 
decoupling capacitors are distributed at 
strategic points around the board. These 
should be positioned in close proximity 
to the positive supply input pin to all 
integrated circuits that are likely to demand 
sudden transient currents (e.g. 555 timers, 
comparators, IC power amplifiers). Ensure 
that there is adequate connection to the 
0 V rail for each decoupling capacitor that 
you use. Additional decoupling may also 
be required for high-frequency devices 
and you should consult semiconductor 
manufacturers’ recommendations for 
specific guidance.

page 376).
Methods (a) and (b) have the obvious limitation 
that they are a strictly one-off process. Method 
(a) is also extremely crude and only applicable 
to very simple boards. Method (c) is by far the 
most superior and allows one to re-use or modify 
the master artwork transparency and produce 
as many further boards as are required. The 
disadvantage of the method is that it is slightly 
more expensive in terms of materials (specially 
coated copper board is required) and requires 
some form of ultraviolet exposure unit. This 
device normally comprises a light-tight enclosure 
into the base of which one or more ultraviolet 
tubes are fitted. Smaller units are available 
which permit exposure of boards measuring 
250 mm × 150 mm while the larger units are 
suitable for boards of up to 500 mm × 350 mm. 
The more expensive exposure units are fitted with 
timers which can be set to determine the actual 
exposure time. Low-cost units do not have such 
a facility and the operator has to refer to a clock 
or wristwatch in order to determine the exposure 
time.
angles). Axial lead components should not be 
mounted vertically.
18. Do not forget that tracks may be conveniently 
routed beneath other components. Supply 
rails in particular can be routed between 
opposite rows of pads of DIL integrated 
circuits; this permits very effective supply 
distribution and decoupling.
19. Minimize track runs as far as possible and 
maintain constant spacing between parallel 
runs of track. Corners should be radiused and 
acute internal and external angles should be 
avoided. In exceptional circumstances, it may 
be necessary to run a track between adjacent 
pads of a DIL integrated circuit. In such 
cases, the track should not be a common 0 V 
path, neither should it be a supply rail.
Fig. 19.8 shows examples of good and bad 
practice associated with PCB layout while 
Fig. 19.9 shows an example of a PCB layout and 
matching component overlay that embodies most 
of the techniques and principles discussed.
As with stripboard layouts, it is well worth 
devoting some time to checking the final draft 
PCB layout before starting on the master 
artwork. This can be instrumental in saving much 
agony and heartache at a later stage. The same 
procedure should be adopted as described on 
page 370 (i.e. simultaneously tracing the circuit 
diagram and PCB layout). 
The next stage depends upon the actual PCB 
production. Four methods are commonly used for 
prototype and small-scale production. These may 
be summarized as follows:
(a) Drawing the track layout directly on the 
copper surface of the board using a special 
pen filled with etch resistant ink. The track 
layout should, of course, conform as closely as 
possible with the draft layout.
(b) Laying down etch resistant transfers of tracks 
and pads on to the copper surface of the PCB 
following the same layout as the draft but 
appropriately scaled.
(c) Producing a transparency (using artwork 
transfers of tracks and pads) conforming to the 
draft layout and then applying photographic 
techniques.

practice in PCB layout

be stored in a cool place at a temperature of 
between 2 °C and 10 °C. Shelf-life at 20 °C will 
only be around 12 months and thus boards should 
be used reasonably promptly after purchase.
Note that it is not absolutely essential to have 
access to an ultraviolet light-box as we all have at 
least occasional access to an entirely free source 
of ultraviolet light. Provided one is prepared to 
wait for a sunny day and prepared to experiment 
a little, the exposure process can be carried out 
in ordinary sunlight. As a guide, and with the full 
sun present overhead, exposure will take around 
15 minutes. Alternatively, one can make use of a 
sun-ray lamp. Again, some experimentation will be 
required in order to get the exposure right. With a 
lamp placed approximately 300 mm from the sun 
ray source (and arranged so that the whole board 
surface is evenly illuminated) an exposure time of 
around four minutes will be required. Note that, 
In use, the 1:1 master artwork (in the form 
of opaque transfers and tape on translucent 
polyester drafting film) is placed on the glass 
screen immediately in front of the ultraviolet 
tubes (taking care to ensure that it is placed so 
that the component side is uppermost). The 
opaque plastic film is then removed from the 
photo-resist board (previously cut roughly to size) 
and the board is then placed on top of the film 
(coated side down). The lid of the exposure unit is 
then closed and the timer set (usually for around 
four minutes but see individual manufacturers’ 
recommendations. The inside of the lid is lined 
with foam which exerts an even pressure over the 
board such that it is held firmly in place during the 
exposure process.
It should be noted that, as with all photographic 
materials, sensitized copper board has a finite 
shelf-life. Furthermore, boards should ideally

foil layout is shown on the left and the matching component overlay is shown on the right

temperature and concentration of the developer 
and on the age of the sensitized board. Normal 
development times are in the region of 30 to 
90 seconds and after this period the developed 
image of the track layout (an etch-resist positive) 
should be seen.
After developing the board it should be carefully 
washed under a running tap. It is advisable not 
to rub or touch the board (to avoid scratching the 
surface) and the jet of water should be sufficient 
to remove all traces of the developer. Finally, 
the board should be placed in the etchant which 
is a ferric chloride solution (FeCl3). For obvious 
reasons, ferric chloride is normally provided 
in crystalline form (though at least one major 
supplier is prepared to supply it on a ‘mail order 
basis’ in concentrated liquid form) and should 
be added to tap water (at 20 °C) following the 
instructions provided by the supplier. If no 
instructions are given, the normal quantities 
involved are 750 ml of water to 500 g of ferric 
chloride crystals. Etching times will also be 
very much dependent upon temperature and 
concentra tion but, for a fresh solution warmed to 
around 40 °C the time taken should typically be 10 
to 15 minutes. During this time the board should 
be regularly agitated and checked to ascertain the 
state of etching. The board should be removed 
as soon as all areas not protected by etch resist 
have been cleared of copper; failure to observe 
this precaution will result in ‘undercutting’ of the 
resist and consequent thinning of tracks and pads. 
Where thermostatically controlled tanks are used, 
if you use this technique, it is important to follow 
the sun-ray lamp manufacturer’s instructions 
concerning eye protection. A pair of goggles or 
dark sunglasses can be used to protect the eyes 
during the exposure process. However, one 
should never look directly at the ultraviolet light 
source even when it is ‘warming up’.
Finally, one can easily manufacture one’s own 
light-box (using low-power ultraviolet tubes) 
or make use of a standard ultraviolet bulb (of 
between 150 W and 300 W) suspended above 
the work area. If this technique is used, the bulb 
should be hung approximately 400 mm above the 
table on which the sensitized board, artwork and 
glass sheet have been placed. A typical exposure 
time for a 300 W bulb is in the range of 10 to 
15 minutes. A pair of dark sunglasses can again 
be used to protect the eyes during the process. 
Where one is using an ‘alternative’ technique, 
a frame should be constructed along the lines 
shown in Fig. 19.10. This can be used to hold the 
transparency in contact with the coated copper 
board during the exposure process.
Whichever method of exposure is used some 
experimentation may be required in order to 
determine the optimum exposure time. After this 
time has elapsed, the board should be removed 
and immersed in a solution of sodium hydroxide 
that acts as a developer. The solution should 
be freshly made and the normal concentration 
required is obtained by mixing approximately 
500 ml of tap water (at 20 °C) with one tablespoon 
of sodium hydroxide crystals. A photographic 
developing tray (or similar shallow plastic 
container) should be used to hold the developer. 
Note that care should be taken when handling the 
developer solution and the use of plastic or rubber 
gloves is strongly recommended. This process 
should be carried out immediately after exposure 
and care should be taken not to allow the board to 
be further exposed under room lights.
The board should be gently agitated while 
immersed in the developer and the ensuing 
process of development should be carefully 
watched. The board should be left for a 
sufficiently long period for the entire surface to be 
developed correctly but not so long that the tracks 
lift. Development times will depend upon the

(a) Mains connectors. These connectors are 
intended for use with an a.c. mains supply. 
Standard three-pole IEC types should be 
employed wherever possible.
(b) Single-pole connectors. These are available 
in ranges having diameters of 4 mm, 3 mm, 
2 mm and 1 mm and are ideal for use with 
test-leads (i.e. as input and output connectors 
in test equipment) and for low-voltage power 
supplies. Plugs and sockets are available in 
various colours to permit identification.
(c) Multi-pole connectors. A huge range of multi- 
pole connectors is currently available and the 
following types are worthy of special note:
 
(i)  DIN standard connectors of the type 
commonly used in audio equipment
 
(ii)  DIN 41612 indirect stripboard and PCB 
edge connectors with 32-, 64- or 96-ways
 
(iii)  DIN 41617 low-cost indirect edge 
connectors 
times of five minutes or less can be achieved 
when using fresh solution.
It should go without saying that great care should 
be exercised when handling ferric chloride. Plastic 
or rubber gloves should be worn and care must be 
taken to avoid spills and splashes. After cooling, 
the ferric chloride solution may be stored (using a 
sealed plastic container) for future use. In general, 
750 ml of solution can be used to etch around six 
to ten boards of average size; the etching process 
taking longer as the solution nears the end of its 
working life. Finally, the exhausted solution must 
be disposed of with care (it should not be poured 
into an ordinary mains drainage system).
Having completed the etching process, the 
next stage involves thorough ly washing, cleaning 
and drying the PCB. After this, the board will be 
ready for drilling. Drilling will normally involve 
the services of a 0.6 mm or 1 mm twist drill 
bit for standard component leads and IC pins. 
Larger drill bits may be required for the leads 
fitted to some larger components (e.g. power 
diodes) and mounting holes. Drilling is greatly 
simplified if a special PCB drill and matching 
stand can be enlisted. Alternatively, provided it 
has a bench stand, a standard electric drill can 
be used. Problems sometimes arise when a 
standard drill or hand drill is unable to adequately 
grip a miniature twist drill bit. In such cases one 
should make use of a miniature pin chuck or a drill 
fitted with an enlarged shank (usually of 2.4 mm 
diameter).
PCB CAD packages
The task of laying out a PCB and producing 
master artwork (both for the copper foil side of a 
board and for the component overlay) is greatly 
simplified by the use of a dedicated PCB CAD 
package. Some examples of the use of these 
packages are shown in Figs 19.11 to 19.14.
Connectors
Various forms of connectors may be required 
in any particular item of electronic equipment. 
These may be categorized in various ways but the 
following should serve as a guide:

power supply module based on a 78L05 three-

equipment. Not only will the enclosure provide 
protection for the equipment but it should also 
be attractive and add to the functionality of the 
equipment. Enclosures can be divided into five 
main types:
1.	 Instrument cases. These are ideal for small 
items of test gear (e.g. meters and signal 
generators) and are available in a wide variety 
of styles and sizes. One of the most popular 
low-cost ranges of instrument cases is that 
manufactured by BICC-Vero and known as 
Veroboxes. This enclosure comprises plastic 
top and bottom sections with anodized 
aluminium front and back panels. Other 
ranges of instrument cases feature steel and 
aluminium construction and are thus eminently 
suited for larger projects or those fitted with 
larger mains transformers (such as heavy-duty 
power supplies).
2.	 Plastic and diecast boxes. These low-cost 
enclosures comprise a box with removable 
lid secured by means of four or more screws. 
Boxes are available in a range of sizes and 
the diecast types (which are ideal for use in 
relatively hostile environments) are available 
both unpainted and with a textured paint 
finish.
3.	 Rack systems. These are designed to accept 
standard cards and are ideal for modular 
projects. The outer case comprises an 
aluminium framework fitted with covers and 
a series of connectors at the rear from which 
the modules derive their power and exchange 
signals. Individual circuit cards (which may 
be stripboard or PCB) are fitted to a small 
supporting chassis and anodized aluminium 
front panel (available in various widths). The 
card assembly slides into the rack using 
appropriately positioned clip-in guides. Rack 
systems are expensive but inherently flexible.
4.	 Desk consoles. These enclosures are ideal for 
desktop equipment and generally have sloping 
surfaces that are ideal for mounting keyboards 
and keypads.
5.	 Special-purpose enclosures. Apart from the 
general-purpose types of enclosure described 
earlier, a variety of special-purpose enclosures 
are also available. These include such items 
as clock and calculator housings, enclosures 
	
(iv)	D-connectors. These are available with 
9-, 15-, 25- and 37-ways and are popularly 
used in microcomputer applications
	
(v)	 IEEE-488 connectors. These 14, 24, 36 
and 50-way connectors are commonly 
used with equipment which uses the 
popular IEEE-488 instrument bus system.
	
Note that insulation displacement connectors 
(IDCs) provide a means of terminating multi- 
way ribbon cables without the need for 
soldering. Simple tools are used to assemble 
the connector and strain relief clamp onto the 
cable, the insulation of which is pierced by the 
tines of the connector pins.
(d)	Coaxial connectors. These connectors are 
used for screened test leads and also for r.f. 
equipment. The following three types are most 
popular:
	
(i)	 BNC. These are available in both 50 Ω and 
75 Ω series and are suitable for operation 
at frequencies up to 4 GHz. 
	
(ii)	 PL259/SO239 (popularly known as UHF). 
These 50 Ω types are suitable for use at 
frequencies up to 250 MHz. 
	
(iii)	Belling-Lee (popularly known as TV). These 
low-cost connectors are suitable for use 
at frequencies up to 800 MHz with an 
impedance of 75 Ω.
The process of choosing a connector is usually 
very straightforward. It will first be necessary 
to ensure that an adequate number of ways are 
catered for and that the connector is suitably 
rated as far as current and voltage are concerned 
(one should consult individual manufacturers’ 
ratings where any doubt arises). It is advisable 
to maintain compatibility with equipment of 
similar type and one should avoid using too wide 
a range of connectors and cables. In addition, a 
common pin-usage convention should be adopted 
and strictly adhered to. This will help to avoid 
problems later on and will make interwiring of 
equipment and exchange of modules a relatively 
straightforward process.
Enclosures
An appropriate choice of enclosure is vitally 
important to the ‘packaging’ of any electronic

clockwise direction. Indicators should operate 
with adequate brightness and should be viewable 
over an appropriate angle. Indicators and controls 
should be arranged so that it is possible to 
ascertain the status of the instrument at a glance. 
If necessary, a number of opinions should be 
sought before arriving at a final layout for the front 
panel; one’s own personal preferences are unlikely 
to coincide exactly with those of the ‘end user’.
Solder and soldering technique
Most solders are an alloy of two metals: tin (Sn) 
and lead (Pb). The proportion of tin and lead is 
usually expressed as a percentage or as a simple 
ratio. For example, the term 60/40 solder refers 
to an alloy which comprises 60% tin and 40% 
lead by weight. The proportion of tin and lead 
is instrumental in determining the melting point 
of the solder alloy and the proportion of the 
constituents is usually clearly stated. 
In the past, solder was often categorized by its 
intended application and the terms radio solder, 
electronic solder, general-purpose solder and 
silver bearing solder. The difference between 
these types of solder can be briefly summarized 
as follows:
Radio solder
A medium melting point temperature (typically 
230 °C) solder used for making joints in point-
to-point wiring as typically found in radios and 
early TV receivers. Typical joints would be quite 
substantial based on tag strips, group boards, 
valve bases, etc., and each joint might involve 
several wires or component leads of substantial 
diameter.
Electronic solder
A low melting point temperature (typically 
185 °C) used for making joints on PCBs. A joint 
would normally involve a single component lead 
and its associated copper pad and excessive 
temperature would have to be avoided in order to 
prevent damage both to the component (whose 
connecting lead might be of a very short length) 
and the PCB itself (where copper pads and tracks 
might lift due to the application of excessive heat).
for hand-held controllers, and cases for in-line 
mains power supplies (including types having 
integral 13 A plugs).
Having decided upon which of the basic types 
of enclosure is required, the following questions 
should be borne in mind when making a final 
selection of enclosure:
X
X Is the size adequate?
X
X Will the enclosure accommodate the 
stripboard or PCB circuitry together with the 
‘off-board’ components (including, where 
appropriate, the mains transformer)? 
X
X Will the enclosure be strong enough? 
X
X Will other equipment be stacked on top of the 
enclosure? 
X
X Can the mains transformer be supported 
adequately without deforming the case? 
X
X Is the front panel of sufficient size to permit 
mounting all of the controls and displays? 
X
X Is any protection (in the form of handles or a 
recessed front panel) necessary for the front 
panel mounted components? 
X
X Is there any need for ventilation?
X
X How much heat is likely to be produced within 
the equipment? 
X
X Can heat-producing components be mounted 
on the rear panel? 
X
X Will a cooling fan be required? 
X
X Is the style of the equipment commensurate 
with other equipment of its type and within 
the same range?
X
X Is there a need to include screening or filtering 
in order to minimize incoming or outgoing 
noise or stray electric/magnetic fields?
When laying out the front panel of the equipment, 
it is important to bear in mind the basic principles 
of ergonomic design. All controls should be 
accessible. They should be logically arranged 
(grouping related functions together) and clearly 
labelled. Consideration should be given to the 
type of controls used (e.g. slider versus rotary 
potentiometers, push-button versus toggle 
switches).
It is also important to wire controls such that their 
action follows the expected outcome. Rotary 
‘gain’ and ‘volume’ controls, for example, should 
produce an increase in output when turned in a

they are formed. In turn, this can result in the 
lifting of pads and tracks and permanent damage 
can result.
Flux
Flux has two roles in soldering. First, it helps with 
the removal of any oxide coating that may have 
formed on the surfaces that are to be soldered; 
and second, it helps to prevent the formation 
of oxides caused by the heat generated during 
the soldering process itself. Flux is available in 
both paste and liquid form. However, in the case 
of solder for electronic applications, it is also 
available incorporated within the solder itself. In 
this case, the flux is contained within a number of

designed for general electrical repair work (and 
unsuitable for use with electronic equipment).
Silver bearing solders
Silver bearing solders tend to flow more smoothly 
and form stronger joints. Unfortunately they 
generally require higher soldering and de-soldering 
temperatures and this can make component 
removal and replacement difficult. In particular, 
the higher temperatures involved may cause 
damage to the bond between copper pads and 
tracks and the printed circuit substrate on which

cores that permeate through the solder material 
rather like the letters that appear on a piece of 
souvenir seaside rock.
Safety when soldering
While soldering is not a particularly hazardous 
operation, there are a number of essential safety 
and other precautions that should be observed. 
These are listed below:
Fumes
Solder fumes are an irritant and exposure, 
particularly if prolonged, can cause asthma 
attacks. Because of this it is essential to avoid the 
build up of fumes, particularly so when a soldering 
iron is in continuous use. The best way to do this 
is to use a proprietary system for fume extraction. 
In addition, many professional quality irons can 
be fitted with fume extraction facilities which are 
designed to clear fumes from the proximity of the 
soldering iron bit. 
Even when a soldering iron is only used 
intermittently it is essential to ensure that the 
equipment is used in a well-ventilated area where 
fumes cannot accumulate. Fume extraction 
should be fitted to all soldering equipment that is 
in constant use. Most good-quality soldering irons 
that are designed for professional use can be 
fitted with fume extraction equipment. Fig. 19.16 
shows a modern soldering station equipped with 
fume extraction.
Damage to eyes
Molten solder or flux additives can cause 
permanent eye damage. Some means of eye 
protection is essential. This can take the form of 
safety glasses or the use of a bench magnifier. 
Ordinary reading or prescription glasses will also 
offer a measure of protection and may also be of 
benefit when undertaking close work.
Static hazards
Many of today’s electronic devices are 
susceptible to damage from electric fields and 
stray static charges. Unfortunately, simply 
earthing the tip of a soldering iron is not sufficient 
to completely eliminate static damage and

382
Soldering guns
Soldering guns (where the bit is effectively a 
short-circuited turn) can become extremely hot 
and continuous operation of this type of iron can 
be extremely dangerous as the mains transformer 
fitted into the handle of the gun can easily 
become overheated. This can cause the insulation 
to reach a dangerously high temperature which 
can result in melting and short-circuits which will 
cause permanent damage to the gun. Because 
of their rather clumsy nature and high power, 
soldering guns should be avoided for all general 
electronic work.
Soldering and de-soldering 
techniques
Soldered joints effectively provide for both 
electrical and mechanical connection of 
components with pins, tags, stripboards, and 
PCB. Before a soldering operation is carried 
out, it is vitally important that all surfaces to 
be soldered are clean and completely free of 
grease and/or oxide films. It is also important to 
have an adequately rated soldering iron fitted 
with an appropriate bit. The soldering iron bit is 
the all-important point of contact between the 
soldering iron and the joint and it should be kept 
scrupulously clean (using a damp sponge) and 
free from oxide. To aid this process, and promote 
heat transfer generally, the bit should be regularly 
‘tinned’ (i.e. given a surface coating of molten 
solder).
The selection of a soldering bit (see Figs 19.18 
and 19.19) depends on the type of work 
undertaken. Fig. 19.20 shows a number of 
popular bit profiles, the smaller bits being suitable 
for sub-miniature components and tightly packed 
boards. The procedures for making soldered 
joints to terminal pins and PCB pads are shown in 
Figs 19.21 and 19.22, respectively. In the case of 
terminal pins, the component lead or wire should 
be wrapped tightly around the pin using at least 
one turn of wire made using a small pair of long-
nosed pliers. If necessary, the wire should be 
trimmed using a small pair of side cutters before 
soldering. Next, the pin and wire should then be 
simultaneously heated by suitable application of 
additional precautions may be required to avoid 
any risks of electro-static damage (ESD). These 
may involve using a low-voltage supply to feed 
the heating element fitted in the soldering iron, 
incorporating low-zero-voltage switching, and 
the use of conductive (antistatic) materials in the 
construction of the soldering iron body and the 
soldering station itself. 
Burn, melt and fire hazards
The bit of a soldering iron is usually maintained at 
a temperature of between 250 °C and 350 °C. At 
this temperature, conventional plastic insulating 
materials will melt and many other materials (such 
as paper, cotton, etc.) will burn. It should also 
go without saying that personal contact should 
be avoided at all times and the use of a properly 
designed soldering iron stand is essential.
Shock hazards
Mains voltage is present in the supply lead to 
a mains operated soldering iron and also in the 
supply lead to any soldering station designed for 
use with a low-voltage iron. If the soldering iron 
bit comes into contact with a mains lead there can 
be a danger that the insulation will melt, exposing 
the live conductors. In such situations, heatproof 
insulation is highly recommended both for the 
supply to the iron itself and also to any power 
unit.

the soldering iron bit and then sufficient solder 
should be fed on to the pin and wire (not via the 
bit) for it to flow evenly around the joint, thus 
forming an airtight ‘seal’. The solder should 
then be left to cool (taking care not to disturb 
the component or wire during the process). The 
finished joint should be carefully inspected and 
re-made if it suffers from any of the following 
faults:
(a) Too little solder. The solder has failed to flow 
around the entire joint and some of the wire 
turn or pin remains exposed.
(b) Too much solder. The solder has formed into 
a large ‘blob’, the majority of which is not in 
direct contact with either the wire or the pin.
(c) The joint is ‘dry’. This usually occurs if either 
the temperature of the joint was insufficient to 
permit the solder to flow adequately or if the 
joint was disturbed during cooling.
In the case of a joint to be made between a 
component and a PCB pad, a slightly different 
technique is used (though the requisites for 
cleanliness still apply). The component should be 
fitted to the PCB (bending its leads appropriately 
at right angles if it is an axial lead component) 
such that its leads protrude through the PCB to 
the copper foil side. The leads should be trimmed 
to within a few millimetres of the copper pad then 
bent slightly (so that the component does not fall 
out when the board is inverted) before soldering 
in place. Opinions differ concerning the angles 
through which the component leads should be 
bent. For easy removal, the leads should not be 
bent at all, while for the best mechanical joint, 
the leads should be bent through 90 °. A good 
compromise, and that preferred by the author, 
involves bending the leads through about 45 °. 
Care should again be taken to use the minimum 
of solder consistent with making a sound 
electrical and mechanical joint.
Finally, it is important to realize that good 
soldering technique usually takes time to develop 
and the old adage ‘practice makes perfect’ is 
very apt in this respect. Do not despair if your 
first efforts fail to match with those of the 
professional!

joint to a terminal pin

Component removal and 
replacement
Care must be exercised when removing and 
replacing printed circuit mounted components 
(see Figs 19.23 to 19.28). It is first necessary to 
accurately locate the component to be removed 
on the upper (component) side of the PCB and 
then to correctly identify its solder pads on 
the underside of the PCB. Once located, the 
component pads should be gently heated using 
a soldering iron. The soldering iron bit should be 
regularly cleaned using a damp sponge (a small 
tin containing such an item is a useful adjunct to 
any soldering work station). The power rating of 
the iron should be the minimum consistent with 
effective removal of the components and should 
therefore not normally exceed 20 W for types 
which do not have tempera ture control since 
excessive heat can not only damage components 
but may also destroy the bond between the 
copper track and the board itself. This latter effect 
causes lifting of pads and tracks from the surface 
of the PCB and should be avoided at all costs.
Once the solder in the vicinity of the pad has 
become molten (this usually only takes one or two 
seconds) a de-soldering suction pump should be 
used to remove the solder. This will often require 
only one operation of the de-soldering pump; 
however, where a large area of solder is present 
or where not all of the solder in the vicinity of the 
pad has become molten, a second application of 
the tool may be required. If the de-soldering tool 
has to be repeatedly applied this usually indicates 
that either the tool is clogged with solder or 
that the soldering iron is not hot enough. With 
practice only one application of the soldering 
iron and de-soldering pump should be required. 
Once cleared of solder, the component lead 
should become free and a similar process should 
be used for any remaining leads or pins. Special 
tools are available for the rapid removal of IC and 
SMD devices and these permit the simultaneous 
heating of all pins (see Figs 19.29 and 19.30).
When de-soldering is complete, the component 
should be gently withdrawn from the upper 
(component) side of the board and the 
replacement component should be fitted, taking 
care to observe the correct polarity and orientation

inverted) before soldering in place. Care should 
be taken to use the minimum of solder consistent 
with making a sound electrical and mechanical 
joint. As always, cleanliness of the soldering iron 
bit is extremely important if dry joints are to be 
avoided.
Finally, a careful visual examination of the joint 
should be carried out. Any solder splashes or 
bridges between adjacent tracks should be 
removed and, if necessary, a sharp pointed 
instrument should be used to remove any surplus 
solder or flux which may be present.
In some cases it may be expedient (or essential 
when the PCB has been mounted in such a 
position that the copper foil side is not readily 
accessible) to remove a component by cutting 
its leads on the upper (component) side of 
the board. However, care should be taken to 
ensure that sufficient lead is left to which the 
replacement component (with its wires or pins 
suitably trimmed) may be soldered. During this 
operation, extra care must be taken when the 
soldering iron bit is placed in close proximity to 
densely packed components on the upper side 
of the PCB. Polystyrene capacitors and other 
plastic encapsulated components are particularly 
vulnerable in this respect. Fig. 19.31 and 19.32 
show some typical arrangements used with SMD 
and conventional components.
Heatsinks
The electronic equipment designer is often faced 
with the task of designing circuits that will operate 
within a range of temperatures that will ensure 
safe and reliable operation. This task is normally 
carried out with the aid of a comprehensive set 
of manufacturers’ data and a number of simple 
formulae. The symbols shown in Table 19.3 are 
commonly used in heatsink calculations:
Determining temperature rise
The ability of a heatsink and transistor mounting 
arrangement to dissipate heat can be measured 
in terms of the amount by which the junction 
temperature exceeds the ambient (or surrounding 
air) temperature. A perfect heatsink and 
mounting arrangement would keep the junction

where appropriate. The leads should protrude 
through the PCB to the copper foil side and 
should be trimmed to within a few millimetres 
of the copper pad, then bent slightly (so that the 
components do not fall out when the board is

temperature the same as that of the surrounding 
air. In practice, the junction temperature will rise 
under operational conditions. 
In practice, a rise in junction temperature is 
unavoidable. What is important, however, is that 
the maximum junction temperature, TJmax, must 
never be exceeded. Furthermore, manufacturers 
provide a de-rating characteristic that must be 
used to determine device rating (percentage 
of full power rating at 25 °C) when the junction 
temperature exceeds its normally specified value 
(see Fig. 19.33).
The temperature rise, ΔT, above ambient will be 
given by:
ΔT = PT × θT 
(1)
where PT is the total power dissipated by the 
semiconductor device(s) and θT is the total 
thermal resistance of the heatsink and mounting 
arrangement.

389
Applying equation (3) gives:
TJ = (PT × θT) + TA = (5 × 8) + 30 = 70 °C
Determining thermal resistance
Fig. 19.34 shows a typical TO3 case style 
transistor mounted on a finned heat dissipator 
(i.e. heatsink). Heat is conducted away from the 
semiconductor junction to the outer case of the 
TO3 package and then, via an insulating washer, 
to the surface of the heatsink. From this point, 
heat is conducted to the extremities of the fins 
where it is radiated into the surrounding air space.
The total thermal resistance, θT, present in any 
heatsink arrangement is actually the sum of 
several individual thermal resistances. Consider 
the case of a transistor bolted directly to a metal 
heat radiator (see Fig. 19.35). The total thermal 
resistance, θT, is the sum of the following thermal 
resistances:
1. The thermal resistance that exists between 
the semiconductor junction and the case of 
the transistor (i.e. the thermal resistance inside 
the transistor package), θJC
Determining the junction temperature
The temperature rise is simply the difference 
between the actual junction temperature and 
the surrounding (or ambient) temperature. 
Ultimately, the operating junction temperature is 
vitally important since exceeding the maximum 
operating junction temperature (TJmax) can result in 
the destruction of the semiconductor device!
Now ΔT = TJ − TA 
(2)
Combining equations (1) and (2) gives:
TJ − TA = PT × θT
From which:
 TJ = (PT × θT) + TA 
(3)
It is worth using an example to explain the use of 
this formula in helping us to determine just how 
hot a semiconductor junction actually gets!
Example 19.1
A TO220 transistor dissipates a total power of 
5 W. If the total thermal resistance is 8 °C/W and 
the ambient temperature is 30 °C, determine the 
junction temperature.

actually appear ‘in series’ and we can use a 
simple electrical analogy to represent the thermal 
‘circuit’ in electrical terms (see Fig. 19.37).
From Fig. 19.37 we can conclude that the total 
thermal resistance, θT, is given by:
θT = θJC + θCS + θSA 
(4)
Note that the total thermal resistance is actually 
the same as the thermal resistance between the 
junction and ambient.
Thus: 
θT = θJC + θCS + θSA = θJA 
(5)
The complete electrical equivalent circuit of the 
heatsink arrangement is shown in Fig. 19.37. 
Note that the source of power (PTOT) is the 
semiconductor device and the ‘potentials’ at the 
two extreme ends of the series chain of thermal 
resistances are TJ (junction temperature) and TA 
(ambient or surrounding air temperature).
Example 19.2
A transistor has a thermal resistance from 
junction to case of 1.5 °C/W. If the transistor is 
fitted with a washer and mounting kit having a 
thermal resistance of 1.75 °C/W, and a heatsink of 
2.25 °C/W, determine the total thermal resistance 
that exists between junction and ambient.
Applying equation (5) gives:
θJA = θJC + θCS + θSA = 1.5 + 1.75 + 2.25 
 
= 5.5 °C/W
2. The thermal resistance between the case of 
the transistor and the heat radiator (i.e. the

it (i.e. the thermal resistance between the 
surface and ambient), θSA

point in the arrangement shown in Fig. 19.35. The

higher rating to allow for a margin of safety.

power dissipation. Since the device is a FET, the 
gate dissipation can be neglected. Thus the total 
power dissipation will be:

Worst case conditions
In the design of electronic equipment we often

ensuring that the absolute maximum junction 
temperature, TJmax, is not exceeded when the total

reach their maximum working values.

Example 19.3
A transistor has an absolute maximum junction 
temperature rating of 150 ° and a thermal 
resistance from junction to case of 1.0 °C/W. If 
the device is fitted with a washer and mounting 
kit having a thermal resistance of 1.25 °C/W and 
a heatsink of 2.75 °C/W, determine whether the 
maximum ratings are exceeded when the total 
power dissipation reaches a maximum of 25 W at 
a maximum ambient temperature of 40 °C.
Applying equation (6) gives:
TJmax = (25 × (1.0 + 1.25 + 2.75) + 40 = 165 °C
The absolute maximum junction temperature 
rating (150 °C) is exceeded and the designer 
should either reduce the power dissipation to 
a safe value or reduce the thermal resistance 
present (or both!). 
Determining heatsink specifications
The electronic equipment designer often has to 
determine the required heatsink specifications 
given the absolute maximum junction 
temperature, thermal resistance from junction to 
case, maximum expected ambient temperature, 
etc. To do this, we need to re-arrange equation (6)

many cases, the tab of the device is connected to 
one of three terminals (often the collector or drain) 
in which case a mica or thermally conductive 
plastic washer must be fitted. Note also that an 
insulated bush must be used in order to prevent 
the mounting bolt shorting the metal tab to the 
heatsink. Fig. 19.39 shows a similar mounting 
arrangement used for a TO218 packaged device
while Fig. 19.40 shows how a TO3 device is 
fitted.
The thermal resistance of the mounting kit used 
with a semiconductor device can have a major 
effect on the efficiency of the heat conduction 
from the surface of the case to the heat radiator. 
Special thermally impregnated washers have 
significantly lower thermal resistance than simple 
mica washers. Thermally conductive silicone 
grease should NOT be used with this type of 
washer.
All of the previous calculations assume that 
the heatsink is subject to natural convection. 
Increasing the airflow across the surface of 
the heatsink can dramatically increase the 
amount of heat radiated and consequently it will 
also significantly reduce the effective thermal 
resistance of the heatsink.
Practical heatsink arrangements
Having explained some of the theory behind the 
design of heat dissipators, we shall move on to 
describe some practical heatsink and mounting 
arrangements. Typical thermal resistance 
for several common case styles are listed in 
Table 19.4.
A selection of heatsink cross-sections is shown 
in Fig. 19.41. These range from a simple folded 
U-section metal plate with a thermal resistance of 
20 °C/W to a complex aluminium alloy extrusion 
with a thermal resistance of 1.2 °C/W. Lower 
values of thermal resistance can be obtained with 
the use of forced air cooling.
Natural convection airflow can be enhanced by 
the proper placement of heatsinks and other heat- 
producing components. Since warm air rises, 
vertical surfaces tend to transmit heat to the air 
better than comparable horizontal surfaces. The 
hottest devices should be located on the upper 
side of a horizontally mounted PCB or close to the 
upper edge of a vertically mounted PCB.

A practical example
We conclude this chapter with an example of 
circuit construction based on a simple bench 
power supply. The requirement was for a small 
adjustable d.c. power supply that could be used 
for general-purpose bench testing of electronic 
circuits. After some preliminary investigation the 
following basic requirements were established:
 1. It should be mechanically and electrically 
rugged.
 2. It should use proven and reliable technology.
 3. It should be low-cost and easy to maintain.
 4. It should comply with appropriate European 
legislation (e.g. the EMC and low-voltage 
directives).

Prototype manufacture
The next stage in the development of the power 
supply was that of examining a range of solutions 
before deciding on the particular solution that 
formed the basis of a prototype. Since the product 
has both electrical/electronic and mechanical 
aspects it was possible to consider these 
separately. 
Research was needed to find a suitable electronic 
circuit and to identify the components that 
would be needed to build it. Various sources 
of information were available including books, 
magazines, data sheets (see Fig. 19.42) 
from manufacturers and suppliers as well as 
the internet. After carrying out some initial 
investigations a suitable circuit design was located 
(see Fig. 19.43). This circuit was based on two 
low-cost readily available integrated circuit devices 
(see requirements 2 and 3) and the data sheets 
were obtained for each (see Fig. 19.42). 
The initial prototype was constructed on 
stripboard and tested after fitting into the 
enclosure (as shown in Fig. 19.47). A further 
prototype (see Fig. 19.48) was developed using 
a printed circuit board (PCB), the track layout for 
which was designed using a PCB CAD package 
which had an autorouting facility. 
In order to satisfy requirements 1 and 4, a fully 
screened metal enclosure was used. This was 
based on a simple two-part construction (see 
requirement 3). An internal EMC filter was 
fitted in order to comply with the EMC directive 
(see requirement 4). Before manufacturing the 
enclosure it was necessary to produce some 
general arrangement and detail drawings showing 
how the sheet metal should be drilled, punched, 
cut and bent. These drawings had to be accurately 
  5.	 It should have one variable (3 V to 15 V) 
output and one fixed (+ 5 V) accessory 
output and both outputs should be protected 
against a short-circuit connected to the 
output.
  6.	 With the exception of the accessory output 
and the a.c. mains input, all controls, 
connectors and switches should be made 
available on the front panel.
  7.	 It should have colour-coded output terminals 
that will accept standard 4 mm plugs. The 
terminals should also allow wires that have 
not been fitted with plugs to be clamped 
directly using a screw action.
  8.	 It should operate from a standard 220 V a.c. 
mains supply which should be connected 
using a standard 3-pin IEC connector.
  9.	 It should be ‘tamper-proof’ (it should not 
be possible to remove the knobs or the 
enclosure without having to resort to the use 
of special tools).
10.	 It should be lightweight and portable.
11.	 It should have LED indicators to show that 
the power supply is switched on and that the 
outputs are present.
Design specification
Having determined a need for our product and 
obtained a detailed list of requirements, the next 
stage was that of firming up the design brief 
and producing a detailed specification for the 
power supply. This design specification was a 
detailed performance specification that included 
numerical values for relevant parameters (such as 
output voltage and output current). The detailed 
design specification was important because we 
returned to it when we needed to confirm that our 
prototype power supply met our requirements. We 
did this by comparing the measured performance 
specification with the original design specification. 
Taking into account the requirements listed above, 
we arrived at the following design specification:
Fixed output:
X
X Output voltage adjustable from 3 V to 15 V
X
X Output current adjustable from 50 mA to  
1 A max.
X
X 4 mm binding post connectors (red and black).

Performance measurement
The measured performance specifications for 
the power supply (obtained from the load tests) 
were as follows (figures from the original design 
specification are shown in square brackets): 
Variable output
X
X Minimum output voltage = 2.85 V [3 V]
X
X Maximum output voltage = 15.23 V [15 V]
X
X Maximum output current = 1.2 A [1 A]
Fixed output
X
X Output voltage (no load) = 4.94 V [5 V]
X
X Output voltage (1 A load) = 4.77 V [4.75 V] 
X
X Output current = 1.2 A [1 A]
These results provide confirmation that the 
prototype conformed closely with the original 
design specification.
Evaluation and modification
Having carried out detailed testing of the 
prototype power supply and having verified that 
the design specification had been met, the next 
stage was that of finalizing the prototype and 
carrying out any modifications prior to passing the 
design for production. 
dimensioned in order to accommodate the 
components used. The drawings were produced 
using a simple 2D CAD package. One drawing 
was produced to show the enclosure top and 
front panel detail (see Fig. 19.44) while a second 
drawing was used to show the enclosure bottom 
and rear panel detail.
The material selected for the enclosure was 
1.22 mm (18 SWG) aluminium sheet. The reasons 
for this choice of material were that it was 
reasonably lightweight (see requirement 10), low-
cost (see requirement 3) and easy to process. It 
could also be attractively paint finished. Figs 19.49 
and 19.50 show the assembled prototype.
Testing to specification
Having assembled a working prototype the next 
stage was that of measuring its performance in 
order to ensure that it fully conformed with the 
requirements set down in the design brief. 
Prototype testing was carried out by applying 
a variable load to the output of the power 
supply and measuring corresponding values of 
output voltage and output current. To simplify 
the analysis, the test data were entered into a 
spreadsheet and graphs of each load test were 
generated  (see Figs 19.45 and 19.46).

output. Note how the output voltage begins to fall

Chapter summary
Decibels (dB) are a convenient means of expressing gain (amplification) 
and loss (attenuation) in electronic circuits. In this respect, they are used 
as a relative measure (i.e. comparing one voltage with another, one current 
with another or one power with another). In conjunction with other units, 
decibels are sometimes also used as an absolute measure. Hence dBV are 
decibels relative to 1 V, dBm are decibels relative to 1 mW, etc.

The decibel is one-tenth of a bel which, in turn, is 
defined as the logarithm, to the base 10, of the 
ratio of output power (Pout) to input power (Pin).
Gain and loss may be expressed in terms of 
power, voltage and current, such that:

where Ap, Av or Ai is the power, voltage or current 
gain (or loss) expressed as a ratio, Pin and Pout are 
the input and output powers, Vin and Vout are the 
input and output voltages, and Iin and Iout are the 
input and output currents. Note, however, that the 
powers, voltages or currents should be expressed 
in the same units/multiples (e.g. Pin and Pout should 
both be expressed in W, mW, µW or nW).
It is often more convenient to express gain in 
decibels (rather than as a simple ratio) using the 
following relationships:

Note that a positive result will be obtained 
whenever Pout, Vout or Iout is greater than Pin, Vout 
or Iout, respectively. A negative result will be 
obtained whenever Pout, Vout or Iout is less than Pin, 
Vin or Iin. A negative result denotes attenuation 
rather than amplification. A negative gain is thus 
equivalent to an attenuation (or loss). If desired, 
the formulae may be adapted to produce a 
positive result for attenuation simply by inverting 
the ratios, as shown below:

where Ap, Av or Ai is the power, voltage or current 
gain (or loss) expressed in decibels, Pin and Pout are 
the input and output powers, Vin and Vout are the 
input and output voltages, and Iin and Iout are the 
input and output currents. Note, again, that the 
powers, voltages or currents should be expressed 
in the same units/multiples (e.g. Pin and Pout should 
both be expressed in W, mW, µW or nW).
It is worth noting that, for identical decibel 
values, the values of voltage and current gain 
can be found by taking the square root of the 
corresponding value of power gain. As an 
example, a voltage gain of 20 dB results from a 
voltage ratio of 10 while a power gain of 20 dB 
corresponds to a power ratio of 100.
Finally, it is essential to note that the formulae 
for voltage and current gain are only meaningful 
when the input and output impedances (or 
resistances) are identical. Voltage and current 
gains expressed in decibels are thus only valid for 
matched (constant impedance) systems. Table 
A7.1 gives some useful decibel values.
Example A7.1
An amplifier with matched input and output 
resistances provides an output voltage of 1 V for 
an input of 25 mV. Express the voltage gain of the 
amplifier in decibels.

Appendix 7  Decibels
435
Solution
The voltage gain can be determined from the 
formula:
Av = 20 log10(Vout/Vin)
where Vin = 25 mV and Vout = 1 V. 
Thus:
Av = 20 log10(1 V/25 mV) 
= 20 log10(40) = 20 × 1.6 = 32 dB
Example A7.2
A matched 600 Ω attenuator produces an output 
of 1 mV when an input of 20 mV is applied. 
Determine the attenuation in decibels.
Solution
The attenuation can be determined by applying 
the formula:
Av = 20 log10(Vout/Vin)
where Vin = 20 mV and Vout = 1 mV.
Thus:
Av = 20 log10(20 mV/1 mV) 
= 20 log10(20) = 20 × 1.3 = 26 dB
Example A7.3
An amplifier provides a power gain of 33 dB. 
What output power will be produced if an input of 
2 mW is applied?
Solution
Here we must re-arrange the formula to make Pout 
the subject, as follows:
Av = 10 log10(Pout/Pin)
thus
Ap/10 = log10(Pout/Pin)
or
antilog10(Ap/10) = Pout/Pin
Hence
Pout = Pin × antilog10(Ap/10)
Now Pin = 2 mW = 20 × 10−3 W and Av = 33 dB, 
thus:
Pout = 2 × 10−3 antilog10(33/10) 
= 2 × 10−3 × antilog10(3.3) 
= 2 × 10−3 × 1.995 × 10−3 = 3.99 W

The value of a square root is the value of the 
base which when multiplied by itself gives the 
number. Since 3 × 3 = 9, then √9 = 3. However, 
(−3) × (−3) = 9, so we have a second possibility, 
i.e. √9 = ±3. There are always two answers when 
finding the square root of a number and we can 
indicate this is by placing a ± sign in front of the 
result meaning ‘plus or minus’. Thus:

Variables and constants
Unfortunately, we don’t always know the value 
of a particular quantity that we need to use in 
a calculation. In some cases the value might 
actually change, in which case we refer to it as 
a variable. In other cases, the value might be 
fixed but we might prefer not to actually quote 
its value. In this case we refer to the value as a 
constant.
An example of a variable quantity is the output 
voltage produced by a power supply when 
the load current is changing. An example of a 
constant quantity might be the speed at which 
radio waves travel in space.
In either case, we use a symbol to represent the 
quantity. The symbol itself (often a single letter) 
is a form of shorthand notation. For example, in 
the case of the voltage from the power supply 
we would probably use v to represent voltage. 
Whereas, in the case of the speed of travel of a 
radio wave we normally use c to represent the 
speed of radio waves in space (i.e. the speed of 
light). 
We can use letters to represent both variable and 
constant quantities in mathematical notation. For 
example, the statement:
voltage is equal to current multiplied by 
resistance
can be written in mathematical notation as 
follows:
V = I × R
where V represents voltage, I represents current 
and R represents resistance.
Notation
The standard notation used in mathematics 
provides us with a shorthand that helps to 
simplify the writing of mathematical expressions. 
Notation is based on the use of symbols that you 
will already recognize. These include = (equals), 
+ (addition), − (subtraction), × (multiplication) and 
÷ (division). Other symbols that you may not be so 
familiar with include < (less than), > (greater than), 
∝ (proportional to) and √ (square root).
Indices
The number 4 is the same as 2 × 2, that is, 2 
multiplied by itself. We can write (2 × 2) as 22. 
In words, we would call this ‘two raised to the 
power two’ or simply ‘two squared’. Thus:
2 × 2 = 22
By similar reasoning we can say that:
2 × 2 × 2 = 23
and
2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 24
In these examples, the number that we have used 
(i.e. 2) is known as the base while the number 
that we have raised it to is known as an index. 
Thus, 24 is called ‘two to the power of four’, 
and it consists of a base of 2 and an index of 4. 
Similarly, 53 is called ‘five to the power of 3’ and 
has a base of 5 and an index of 3. Special names 
are used when the indices are 2 and 3, these 
being called ‘squared’ and ‘cubed’, respectively. 
Thus 72 is called ‘seven squared’ and 93 is called 
‘nine cubed’. When no index is shown, the power 
is 1, i.e. 21 means 2.
Reciprocals
The reciprocal of a number is when the index is 
−1 and its value is given by 1 divided by the base. 
Thus the reciprocal of 2 is 2−1 and its value is ½ 
or 0.5. Similarly, the reciprocal of 4 is 4−1 which 
means ¼ or 0.25.
Square roots
The square root of a number is when the index 
is ½. The square root of 2 is written as 2½ or √2.

It’s useful to illustrate these important concepts 
using some examples:
Example 1
The power in a loudspeaker is proportional to the 
square of the r.m.s. output voltage and inversely 
proportional to the impedance of the speaker. 
Write down an equation for the power, P, in terms 
of the voltage, V, and impedance, Z. Obtain a 
formula for P in terms of V and Z.
From the information given, we can say that 
‘power is proportional to voltage squared’ hence:
∝
P
V 2 
(1)
and ‘power is inversely proportional to impedance’ 
thus:
∝
P
Z
1 
(2)
We can re-write this expression using a negative 
index, as follows:
∝
−
P
Z
1
We can go one stage further and combine these 
two relationships to obtain a formula for power 
that involves both variables, i.e. V and Z:
Z
1
Example 2
In Example 1, determine the power delivered to 
the loudspeaker if the r.m.s. voltage, V, is 8 V and 
the loudspeaker has an impedance, Z, of 4 W.

Example 3
The equipment manufacturer in Example 2 
recommends testing the amplifier at a power of 
10 W. Determine the r.m.s. voltage at the output 
that corresponds to this power level.
Here we must re-arrange the formula in order to 
make V the subject. If we multiply both sides of 
the equation by Z we will have P and Z on one 
side of the equation and V 2 on the other:
×

Similarly, the statement:
resistance is equal to voltage divided by 
current
can be written in mathematical notation as 
follows:
=
R
V
I
where R represents resistance, V represents 
voltage and I represents current.
Proportionality
In electronic circuits, when one quantity changes 
it normally affects a number of other quantities. 
For example, if the output voltage produced by 
a power supply increases when the resistance 
of the load to which it is connected remains 
constant, the current supplied to the load will 
also increase. If the output voltage doubles, 
the current will also double in value. If, on the 
other hand, the output voltage falls by 50% the 
current will also fall by 50%. To put this in a 
mathematical way we can say that (provided that 
load resistance remains constant):
load current is directly proportional to 
output voltage 
Using mathematical notation and symbols to 
represent the quantities, we would write this as:
∝
I
V
where I represents load current, V represents 
output voltage and ∝ means ‘is proportional to’.
In some cases, an increase in one quantity will 
produce a reduction in another quantity. For 
example, if the frequency of a wavelength of a 
radio wave increases, its wavelength is reduced. 
To put this in a mathematical way we say that 
(provided the speed of travel remains constant):
wavelength is inversely proportional to 
frequency 
Using mathematical notation and symbols to 
represent the quantities, we would write this as 
follows:
∝
T
f
1
where T represents periodic time and f represents 
frequency.

When a number is written in standard form, the 
first factor is called the mantissa and the second 
factor is called the exponent. Thus the number 
6.8 × 103 has a mantissa of 6.8 and an exponent 
of 103.
Numbers having the same exponent can be 
added or subtracted in standard form by adding 
or subtracting the mantissa and keeping the 
exponent the same. Thus: 
2.3 × 104 + 3.7 × 104 = (2.3 + 3.7) × 104 
	
= 6.0 × 104,
and
5.7 × 10−2 − 4.6 × 10−2 = (5.7 − 4.6) × 10−2 
	
= 1.1 × 10−2
When adding or subtracting numbers it is quite 
acceptable to express one of the numbers in non-
standard form, so that both numbers have the 
same exponent. This makes things much easier 
as the following example shows:
2.3 × 104 + 3.7 × 103 = 2.3 × 104 + 0.37 × 104
	
= (2.3 + 0.37) × 104
	
= 2.67 × 104 
Alternatively, 
2.3 × 104 + 3.7 × 103 = 23,000 + 3700 
	
= 26,700 = 2.67 × 104
The laws of indices are used when multiplying 
or dividing numbers given in standard form. For 
example,
(22.5 × 103) × (5 × 102) = (2.5 × 5) × (103+2)
	
     = 12.5 × 105 or 1.25 × 106

Laws of indices
When simplifying calculations involving indices, 
certain basic rules or laws can be applied, called 
the laws of indices. These are listed below:
(a)	When multiplying two or more numbers 
having the same base, the indices are added. 
Thus 22 × 24 = 22+4 = 26.
(b)	When a number is divided by a number having 
the same base, the indices are subtracted. 
Thus 25/22 = 25−2 = 23.
(c)	When a number which is raised to a power 
is raised to a further power, the indices are 
multiplied. Thus (25)2 = 25×2 = 210.
(d)	When a number has an index of 0, its value is 
1. Thus 20 = 1.
(e)	When a number is raised to a negative power, 
the number is the reciprocal of that number 
raised to a positive power. Thus 2−4 = 1/24. 
(f)	 When a number is raised to a fractional power 
the denominator of the fraction is the root of 
the number and the numerator is the power. 
Thus 25½ = √251 = ±5
Standard form
A number written with one digit to the left of the 
decimal point and multiplied by 10 raised to some 
power is said to be written in standard form. 
Thus: 1234 is written as 1.234 × 103 in standard 
form, and 0.0456 is written as 4.56 × 10−2 in 
standard form.

equation as long as the equality of the equation is 
maintained. In other words, the same operation 
must be applied to both the left-hand side (LHS) 
and the right-hand side (RHS) of the equation.
Example 6 
A current of 0.5 A flows in the 56 Ω shown in 
Fig. A8.2. Given that V = I R, determine the 
voltage that appears across the resistor.
It’s a good idea to get into the habit of writing 
down what you know before attempting to solve 
an equation. In this case:
I = 0.5 A
R = 56 Ω
V = ?
Now 
V = IR = 0.5 × 56 = 28 V
Example 7
The current present at a junction in a circuit is 
shown in Fig. A8.3 where I1 = 0.1 A, I2 = 0.25 A 
and I3 = 0.3 A. Determine the value of the 
unknown current, Ix. 
From Kirchhoff’s Current Law, the algebraic sum 
of the current at a junction in a circuit is zero. 
Adopting the convention that current flowing 
towards the junction is positive and that flowing 
away from the junction is negative we can 
construct a formula along the following lines:
0 = −Ix + I1 −I2 −I3
Thus
t = 4 × 10−7 s
Example 5
Resistors of 3.9 kΩ, 5.6 kΩ and 10 kΩ are 
connected in parallel as shown in Fig. A8.1. 
Calculate the effective resistance of the circuit.

Finally, evaluate the result using your calculator:
a = 5,160 × 10−3 = 5.16
Don’t forget the units! Since we have been 
working in mm, the result, a, will be in mm2. 
Hence  a = 5.16 mm2
It’s worth noting from the previous example that 
we have used the laws of indices to simplify 
the powers of ten before attempting to use 
the calculator to determine the final result. The 
alternative to doing this is to make use of the 
exponent facility on your calculator. Whichever 
technique you use it’s important to be confident 
that you are correctly using the exponent notation 
since it’s not unknown for students to produce 
answers that are incorrect by a factor of 1,000 or 
even 1,000,000 and an undetected error of this 
magnitude could be totally disastrous! 
Before attempting to substitute values into an 
equation, it’s important to be clear about what 
you know (and what you don’t know) and always 
make sure that you have the correct units. The 
values marked on components can sometimes 
be misleading and it’s always worth checking 
that you have interpreted the markings correctly 
before wasting time solving an equation that 
doesn’t produce the right answer!
Example 9
The reactance, X, of a capacitor is given by the 
relationship:

We can re-arrange the equation to make Ix the 
subject by adding Ix to both sides:
0 + Ix = −Ix + Ix+ I1 − I2 − I3
From which:
Ix = I1 −I2 −I3
Now I1 = 0.1 A, I2 = 0.25 A and I3 = 0.3 A
Thus:
Ix = 0.1 − 0.25 − 0.3 = −0.45 A
Hence Ix = 0.45 A flowing towards the junction.
It is important to note here that our original 
‘guess’ as to the direction of Ix as marked on 
Fig. A8.3 was incorrect and the current is actually 
flowing the other way!
Note that it is always a good idea to check 
the solution to an equation by substituting the 
solution back into the original equation. The 
equation should then balance such that the LHS 
can be shown to be equal to the RHS.
In many cases it can be more convenient to 
change the subject of a formula before you insert 
values. The next few examples show how this is 
done:
Example 8
A copper wire has a length, l, of 1.5 km, a 
resistance, R, of 5 Ω and a resistivity, ρ, of  
17.2 × 10−6 Ω mm. Find the cross-sectional area, 
a, of the wire, given the following relationship:
R
a
ρ
=
l
Once again, it is worth getting into the habit of 
summarizing what you know from the question 
and what you need to find. Also, don’t forget to 
include the units for each one of the quantities 
that you know.
R = 5 Ω
ρ = 17.2 × 10−6 Ω mm
l = 1500 × 103 mm
a = ? 
Now since

then

Finally, it would be sensible to express the

need to multiply the result by 109, as follows:
C = 0.398 × 10−7 × 109 = 0.398 × 109−7

Once again, LHS = RHS.
The reason for this apparent anomaly is simply 
that the result of squaring a negative number will 
be a positive number (i.e. (−2)2 = (−2) × (−2) = +4). 
Hence, a correct answer to the problem in 
Example 11 would be:
X = ±43.3 Ω 
Don’t panic if the ambiguity of this answer is 
worrying you! Reactance in an a.c. circuit can 
be either positive or negative depending upon 
whether the component in question is an inductor 
or a capacitor. In this case, the numerical value of 
the impedance is the same regardless of whether 
the reactance is inductive or capacitive.
Graphs
Graphs provide us with a visual way of 
representing data. They can also be used to show, 
in a simple pictorial way, how one variable affects 
another variable. Several different types of graph 
are used in electronics. We shall start by looking 
at the most basic type, the straight line graph.
Straight line graphs
Earlier we introduced the idea of proportionality. 
In particular, we showed that the current flowing 
in a circuit was directly proportional to the 
voltage applied to it. We expressed this using the 
following mathematical notation:
i
ν
∝
where i represents load current and ν represents 
output voltage.
We can illustrate this relationship using a simple 
graph showing current, i, plotted against voltage, ν. 
Determine the reactance, X, of the circuit when 
R = 25 Ω and Z = 50 Ω.
Here we know that: 
R = 25 Ω
Z = 50 Ω
X = ? 
First we will re-arrange the formula in order to 
make X the subject:
=

Z
R
X

Squaring both sides gives:

Re-arranging gives: 
X 2 = Z 2 − R 2
Taking the square root of both sides gives:

We can now replace Z and R by the values that 
we know:

thus
X = 43.3 Ω
In the previous example we arrived at a solution 
of 43.3 Ω for X. This is not the only solution as we 
will now show:
As before, we can check that we have arrived at 
the correct answer by substituting values back 
into the original equation, as follows:

i, and voltage, ν, are taken and used to construct 
the graph shown in Fig. A8.7

Figure A8.7 Graph of i plotted against ν
Let’s assume that the voltage applied to the 
circuit varies over the range 1 V to 6 V and the 
circuit has a resistance of 3 W. By taking a set of 
measurements of v and i (see Fig. A8.6) we would 
obtain the following table of corresponding values 
shown below:
Voltage, ν (V)

The resulting graph is shown in Fig. A8.7. To 
obtain the graph, a point is plotted for each pair 
of corresponding values for ν and i. When all 
the points have been drawn they are connected 
together by drawing a line. Notice that, in this 
case, the line that connects the points together 
takes the form of a straight line. This is always the 
case when two variables are directly proportional 
to one another.
It is conventional to show the dependent variable 
(in this case it is current, i ) plotted on the vertical 
axis and the independent variable (in this case it 
is voltage, ν ) plotted on the horizontal axis. If you 
find these terms a little confusing, just remember 
that what you know is usually plotted on the 
horizontal scale while what you don’t know (and 
may be trying to find) is usually plotted on the 
vertical scale. In fact, the graph contains the same 
information regardless of which way round it is 
drawn!
Now let’s take another example. Assume that 
the following measurements are made on an 
electronic component:
Temperature, t (oC)

The results of the experiment are shown plotted 
in graphical form in Fig. A8.8. Note that the graph 
consists of a straight line but that it does not 
pass through the origin of the graph (i.e. the point 
at which t and V are 0 °C and 0 V, respectively). 
The second most important feature to note (after 
having noticed that the graph is a straight line) is 
that, when t = 0 °C, R = 100 W.
By looking at the graph we could suggest a 
relationship (i.e. an equation) that will allow us to 
find the resistance, R, of the component at any 
given temperature, t. The relationship is simply:

If you need to check that this works, just try 
inserting a few pairs of values from those given 
in the table. You should find that the equation 
balances every time!
Earlier we looked at equations. The shape of a 
graph is dictated by the equation that connects its 
two variables. For example, the general equation 
for a straight line takes the form:
y = m x + c
where y is the dependent variable (plotted on the 
vertical or y-axis), x is the independent variable 
(plotted on the horizontal or x-axis), m is the slope 
(or gradient) of the graph and c is the intercept 
on the y-axis. Fig. A8.9 shows this information 
plotted on a graph.
The values of m (the gradient) and c (the 
y-axis intercept) are useful when quoting the 
specifications for electronic components. In the 
previous example, the electronic component (in 
this case a thermistor ) has:
(a) a resistance of 100 W at 0 °C (thus c = 100 Ω)
(b) a characteristic that exhibits an increase 
in resistance of 0.5 W per °C (thus 
m = 0.5 W/°C).

length of the triangle (expressed in V). From 
Fig. A8.10 we can see that the vertical height 
of the triangle is 2 mA while its horizontal 
length is 1 V. The slope of the graph is thus 
given by 2 mA/1 V = 2 mA/V.
Square law graphs
Of course, not all graphs have a straight line 
shape. In the previous example we saw a graph 
that, while substantially linear, became distinctly 
curved at one end. Many graphs are curved rather 
than linear. One common type of curve is the 
square law. To put this into context, consider 
the relationship between the power developed 
in a load resistor and the current applied to 
it. Assuming that the load has a resistance of 
15 W we could easily construct a table showing 
corresponding values of power and current, as 
shown below: 
Current, I (A)

Plot a graph showing how drain current (ID) varies 
with gate-source voltage (VGS) and use the graph 
to determine:
(a) the value of ID when VGS = 0 V, and
(b) the slope of the graph (expressed in mA / V) 
when VGS = −2 V.
The data have been shown plotted in Fig. A8.10. 
Note that, since the values of VGS that we have 
been given are negative, we have plotted these to 
the left of the vertical axis rather than to the right 
of it.
(a) We can use the graph to determine the 
crossing point (the intercept) on the drain 
current (ID) axis. This occurs when ID = 10 mA.
(b) The slope (or gradient) of the graph is found 
by taking a small change in drain current and 
dividing it by a corresponding small change 
in gate-source voltage. In order to do this we 
have drawn a triangle on the graph at the point 
where VGS = −2 V. The slope of the graph is 
found by dividing the vertical height of the 
triangle (expressed in mA) by the horizontal

Figure A8.11 Power, P, plotted against current, I, showing a square law graph
Figure A8.12 The fi rst, second, third and fourth 
quadrants of a graph
We can plot this information on a graph showing 
power, P, on the vertical axis plotted against 
current, I, on the horizontal axis. In this case, P is 
the dependent variable and I is the independent 
variable. The graph is shown in Fig. A8.11.
It can be seen that the relationship between P and 
I in Fig. A8.11 is far from linear. The relationship 
is, in fact, a square law relationship. We can 
actually deduce this from what we know about 
the power dissipated in a circuit and the current 
flowing in the circuit. You may recall that:
P = I 2 R 
where P represents power in watts, I is current in 
amps and R is resistance in ohms.
Since R remains constant, we can deduce that:
∝
P
I 2
In words, we would say that ‘power is 
proportional to current squared’.
Many other examples of square law relationships 
are found in electronics.
More complex graphs
Many more complex graphs exist and Fig. A8.13 
shows some of the most common types. Note 
that these graphs have all been plotted over the 
range x = ±4, y = ±4. Each graph consists of four 
quadrants. These are defined as follows (see 
Fig. A8.12):
First quadrant 
 Values of x and y are both 
positive 
Second quadrant 
 Values of x are negative while 
those for y are positive
Third quadrant 
 Values of x and y are both 
negative
Fourth quadrant 
 Values of x are positive while  
those for y are negative.

right-angled triangle shown in Fig. A8.14. This 
triangle has three sides; a, b and c. The angle that 
we are interested in (we have used the Greek 
symbol θ to denote this angle) is adjacent to side 
a and is opposite to side b. The third side of the 
triangle (the hypotenuse) is the longest side of the 
triangle. 
In Fig. A8.14, the theorem of Pythagoras states 
that ‘the square on the hypotenuse is equal to 
the sum of the squares on the other two sides’. 
Writing this as an equation we arrive at:
c 2 = a 2 + b 2
where c is the hypotenuse and a and b are the 
other two sides.
Taking square roots of both sides of the equation 
we can see that:
=
+
c
a
b

Thus if we know two of the sides (for example, a 
and b) of a right-angled triangle we can easily find 
the third side (c).
The ratios a /c, b /c and a /b are known as the 
basic trigonometric ratios. They are known as 
sine (sin), cosine (cos) and tangent (tan) of 
angle θ, respectively. Thus:

Trigonometrical equations
Equations that involve trigonometrical expressions 
are known as trigonometrical equations. 
The straight line relationship, y = x, is shown in 
Fig. A8.13(a). This graph consists of a straight line 
with a gradient of 1 that passes through the origin 
(i.e. the point where x = 0 and y = 0). The graph 
has values in the first and third quadrants.
The relationship y = x 2 is shown in Fig. A8.13(b). 
This graph also passes through the origin but its 
gradient changes, becoming steeper for larger 
values of x. As you can see, the graph has values 
in the first and second quadrants.
The graph of y = x 3 is shown in Fig. A8.13(c). This 
cubic law graph is steeper than the square law of 
Fig. A8.13(b) and it has values in the first and third 
quadrants.
Fig. A8.13(d) shows the graph of y = x4. This 
graph is even steeper than those in Figs. A8.13(b) 
and A8.13(c). Like the square law graph of 
Fig. A8.13(b), this graph has values in the first and 
second quadrants.
The graph of y = x5 is shown in Fig. A8.13(e). Like 
the cubic law graph of Fig. A8.13(c), this graph 
has values in the first and third quadrants.
Finally, Fig. A8.13(f) shows the graph of y = 1/x 
(or y = x−1). Note how the y values are very large 
for small values of x and very small for very large 
values of x. This graph has values in the first and 
third quadrants.
If you take a careful look at Fig. A8.13 you should 
notice that, for odd powers of x (i.e. x1, x 3, x 5 and 
x −1) the graph will have values in the first and third 
quadrant while for even powers of x (i.e. x2 and x 4) 
the graph will have values in the first and second 
quadrants.
Trigonometry
You might be wondering what trigonometry has 
to do with electronics. It’s just that a familiarity 
with some basic trigonometry is fundamental to 
developing an understanding of signal, waveforms 
and a.c. circuits. Indeed, the most fundamental 
waveform used in a.c. circuits is the sine wave 
and this wave is a trigonometric function. 
Basic trigonometrical ratios
Trigonometrical ratios are to do with the way in 
which we measure angles. Take a look at the 
Figure A8.14 Right-angled triangles

The circumference, l, of a circle is related to its 
radius, r, according to the formula:
l = 2 π r 
Thus 
2
r
π
= l
Now, since there are 360 degrees in one 
complete revolution we can deduce that one 
radian is the same as 360°/2π = 57.3°. In other 
words, to convert:
(a) degrees to radians multiply by 57.3
(b) radians to degrees divide by 57.3
It is important to note that one complete cycle 
of a periodic function (i.e. a waveform) occurs in 
a time, T. This is known as the periodic time or 
just the period. In a time interval equal to T, the 
angle will have changed by 360°. The relationship 
between time and angle expressed in degrees is 
thus:
θ =
×
°
T
t
360
 
and
 
θ
=

Thus, if one complete cycle (360°) is completed 
in 0.02 s (i.e. T = 20 ms) an angle of 180° will 
correspond to a time of 0.01 s (i.e. t = 10 ms). 
Conversely, if we wish to express angles in 
radians:
θ
π
=

 and

T
Thus, if one complete cycle (2π radians) is 
completed in 0.02 s (i.e. T = 20 ms) an angle of 
θ radians will correspond to a time of 0.01 (i.e. 
t = 10 ms). It should be apparent from this that, 
when considering waveforms, time and angle 
(whether expressed in degrees or radians) are 
interchangeable. Note that the general equation

Graphs of trigonometrical functions
To plot a graph of y = sin θ we can construct a 
table of values of sin θ as θ is varied from 0o to 
360o in suitable steps. This exercise (carried out 
Fortunately they are not quite so difficult to 
understand as they sound! Consider the equation:
sin θ = 0.5
This equation can be solved quite easily using a 
calculator. However, before doing so, you need to 
be sure to select the correct mode for expressing 
angles on your calculator. If you are using a 
‘scientific calculator’ you will find that you can 
set the angular mode to either radian measure 
or degrees. A little later we will explain the 
difference between these two angular measures 
but for the time being we shall use degrees.
If you solve the equation (by keying in 0.5 and 
pressing the inverse sine function keys) you 
should see the result 30° displayed on your 
calculator. Hence we can conclude that:
sin 30° = 0.5
Actually, a number of other angles will give the 
same result! Try pressing the sine function key 
and entering the following angles in turn:
30°, 210°, 390° and 570°
They should all produce the same result, 0.5! This 
should suggest to you that the graph of the sine 
function repeats itself (i.e. the shape of the graph 
is periodic). In the next section we shall plot the 
sine function but before we do we shall take a 
look at using radian measure to specify angles.
The radian is defined as the angle subtended 
by an arc of a circle equal in length to the radius 
of the circle. This relationship is illustrated in 
Fig. A8.15.

(c) the maximum and minimum values of voltage

(e) the equation for the voltage.
All of the above can be obtained from the graph of

given by the equation:

Determine the voltage when:

We can easily solve this problem by substituting 
values into the expression.

Thus ‘A AND B’ can be written (A ⋅ B) whereas ‘A 
OR B’ is written (A + B). The bar symbol,  , used 
above a variable (or over a part of an expression) 
indicates inversion (the NOT function). Thus ‘NOT 
A’ is written A and ‘NOT (A AND B)’ is written 
A ⋅ B. Note that A ⋅ B is not the same as A ⋅ B.
It is important to note that a logic variable (such 
as A or B) can exist in only two states variously 
(and interchangeably) described as true or false, 
asserted or non-asserted, 1 or 0, etc. The two 
states are mutually exclusive and there are no ‘in 
between’ conditions. 
Truth tables
We often use tables to describe logic functions. 
These tables show all possible logical 
combinations and they are called truth tables. The 
columns in a truth table correspond to the input 
variables and an extra column is used to show 
the resulting output. The rows of the truth tables 
show all possible states of the input variables. 
Thus, if there are two input variables (A and B) 
there will be four possible input states, as follows:
A = 0, B = 0
A = 0, B = 1
A = 1, B = 0
A = 1, B = 1
(d) νav. = 0 V (the positive and negative cycles of 
the voltage are equal)
(e) ν = 20 sin 314 t (the maximum value of the 
voltage, V max, is 20 V and T = 0.02 s).
Boolean algebra
Boolean algebra is the algebra that we use 
to describe and simplify logic expressions. 
An understanding of Boolean algebra can be 
extremely useful when troubleshooting any circuit 
that employs digital logic. It is, for example, very 
useful to be able to predict the output of a logic 
circuit when a particular input condition is present.
Boolean notation
Just as with conventional algebra, we use letters 
to represent the variables in these expressions. 
The symbols used in Boolean algebra do not, 
however, have the same meanings as they have 
in conventional algebra:

Venn diagram. This diagram consists of a number 
of overlapping areas that represent all of the 
possible logic states.
A simple Venn diagram with only one variable is 
shown in Fig. A8.22. The shaded area represents 
the condition when variable A is true (i.e. logic 
1). The non-shaded area represents the condition 
when variable A is false (i.e. logic 0). Obviously, 
variable A cannot be both true and false at the 
same time hence the shaded and non-shaded 
areas are mutually exclusive.
Fig. A8.23 shows Venn diagrams for the basic 
logic functions: AND, OR, NAND and NOR. You 
should note that these diagrams convey exactly 
the same information as the truth tables in 
Fig. A8.20 but presented in a different form.
Karnaugh maps
A Karnaugh map consists of a square or 
rectangular array of cells into which 0s and 
1s may be placed to indicate false and true, 
respectively. Two alternative representations of 
a Karnaugh map for two variables are shown in 
Fig. A8.24.
Basic logic functions
The basic logic functions are: OR, AND, NOR 
and NAND. We can describe each of these 
basic logic functions using truth tables as shown 
in Fig. A8.20 (for two input variables) and in 
Fig. A8.21 (for three input variables).
In general, a logic function with n input variables 
will have 2n different possible states for those 
inputs. Thus, with two input variables there will be 
four possible input states, for three input variables 
there will be eight possible states, and for four 
input variables there will be 16 possible states.
Take a look at Figs A8.20 and A8.21 and compare 
the output states for AND with those for NAND 
as well as OR with those for NOR. In every case, 
you should notice that the output states are 
complementary – in other words, all of the 0s in 
the AND column have been inverted to become 
1s in the NAND column, and vice versa. The same 
rule also applies to the OR and NOR columns.
Venn diagrams
An alternative technique to that of using a truth 
table to describe a logic function is that of using a

Once again note how the overscore character is 
used to indicate the inverting function.
This important relationship is known as De 
Morgan’s theorem.
Karnaugh maps can be drawn showing two, 
three, four or even more variables. The Karnaugh 
map shown in Fig. A8.28 is for three variables – 
note that there are eight cells and that each 
cell corresponds to one of the eight possible 
combinations of the three variables; A, B and C.
The technique of grouping cells together is an 
extremely powerful one. On a Karnaugh map 
showing three variables, if two adjacent cells 
both contain 1s they can be grouped together 
to produce an expression containing just two 
variables. Similarly, if four adjacent cells can be 
grouped together, they reduce to an expression 
containing only one variable.
It is also important to note that the map is a 
continuous surface which links edge to edge. 
This allows cells at opposite extremes of a row 
or column to be linked together. The four corner 
cells of a four (or more) variable map may likewise 
be grouped together (provided they all contain 1s).
The relationship between Boolean logic 
expressions for two variables and their Karnaugh 
maps is illustrated in Fig. A8.25 while Fig. A8.26 
shows how the basic logic functions, AND, OR, 
NAND and NOR, can be plotted on Karnaugh 
maps.
Adjacent cells within a Karnaugh map may be 
grouped together in rectangles of two, four, 
eight, etc. cells in order to simplify a complex 
logic expression. Taking the NAND function, for 
example, the two groups of two adjacent cells

The Commutative Law shows us that:
A + B = B + A
and also that:
A ⋅ B = B ⋅ A
The Associative Law shows us that:
A + (B + C ) = (A + B) + C = A + B + C
and also that:
A ⋅ (B ⋅ C ) = (A ⋅ B ) ⋅ C = A ⋅ B ⋅ C
The Distributive Law shows us that:
A ⋅ (B + C ) = A ⋅ B + B ⋅ C
and also that:
A + (B ⋅ C) = (A + B) ⋅ (A + C)
All of the above laws can be proved using the 
various techniques that we met earlier.
Boolean simplification
Using the laws of Boolean algebra and De 
Morgan’s theorem, A ⋅ B = A + B (see earlier), 
we can reduce complex logical expressions in 
order to minimize the number of variables and the 
number of terms. For example, the expression 
that we met earlier can be simplified as follows:

Here we have eliminated the variable C from the 
first and second pair of terms and then eliminated 
B from the result. You might like to compare this 
with the Karnaugh map that we drew earlier in 
Fig. A8.30!

Part of the control logic for an intruder alarm is 
shown in Fig. A8.31. Determine the logic required 
to select the Y4 output and verify that the Y3 
output is permanently selected and unaffected by 
the states of S1 and S2.

Fig. A8.29 shows how this function is plotted on 
the Karnaugh map.
As before, we have placed a 1 in each cell. Then 
we can begin to link together adjacent cells –
notice how we have reduced the diagram to a 
group of four cells equivalent to the logic variable, 
A. In other words, the value of variables B and C, 
whether 0 or 1, will have no effect on the logic 
function. From Fig. A8.30 we can conclude that:

Boolean algebra

from those of ordinary algebra. For example:

10 dB = 1 B
It is important to note that the Bel is derived from 
the logarithm of a ratio – it‘s not a unit like the volt 
(V) or ampere (A).
The logarithm (to the base 10) of a number is 
defined as the power that 10 must be raised to 
in order to equal that number. This may sound 
difficult but it isn’t, as a few examples will show:
Because 10 = 101, the logarithm (to the base 10) 
of 10 is 1.
Because 100 = 102, the logarithm (to the base 10) 
of 100 is 2.
Because 1,000 = 103, the logarithm (to the base 
10) of 1,000 is 3, and so on.
Writing this as a formula we can say that:
If x = 10n, the logarithm (to the base 10) of x is n.
You might like to check that this works using the 
examples that we just looked at!
You may be wondering why we keep writing 
‘to the base 10’. Logarithms can be to any base 
but 10 just happens to be the most obvious and 
useful.
Logarithmic notation
The notation that we use with logarithms is quite 
straightforward:
If x = 10n we say that log10(x ) = n.
The subscript that appears after the 'log' reminds 
us that we are using base 10 rather than any other 
(unspecified) number. Re-writing what we said 
earlier using our logarithmic notation gives:
log10(10) = log10(101) = 1
log10(100) = log10(102) = 2
log10(1,000) = log10(103) = 3
and so on.
So far we have used values (10, 100 and 1,000) in 
our examples that just happen to be exact powers 
of 10. So how do we cope with a number that 
isn’t an exact power of 10? If you have a scientific 
calculator this is quite easy! Simply enter the 
number and press the ‘log’ button to find its 
logarithm (the instructions provided with your 
calculator will tell you how to do this). 
Each logic gate shown in Fig. A8.31 is a two-input 
NAND gate. We can construct the truth table for 
the control circuit (see Fig. A8.32) by placing all 
four possible combinations of 0 and 1 on the S1 
and S2 inputs and tracing the logic states through 
the circuit. We have shown the first stage of this 
process (the logic conditions that produce the first 
line of the truth table) in Fig. A8.32.
From Fig. A8.32 it can be seen that the Y4 output 
corresponds to the AND logic function:
Y4 = S1 ⋅ S2
You can also see from Fig. A8.32 that the Y3 
output remains at logic 1 regardless of the states 
of S1 and S2.
Logarithms
Many of the numbers that we have to deal with in 
electronics are extremely large while others can 
be extremely small. The problem of coping with 
a wide range of numbers is greatly simplified by 
using logarithms. Because of this, we frequently 
employ logarithmic scales, Bels (B) and decibels 
(dB), when comparing values. Note that a decibel 
(dB) is simply one-tenth of a Bel (B). Hence:

Appendix 8  Mathematics for electronics

The overall power gain can be calculated from the 
following:
Overall power gain (expressed as a ratio)
output power
input power
4W
1mW
4,000
=
=
=
Converting this gain to decibels gives:
10 log10 (4,000) = 36 dB
Adding the power gains from the right-hand 
column gives: 19 − 6 +23 = 36 dB
Example 16
An amplifier has a power gain of 27,000. Express 
this in Bels (B) and decibels (dB).
In Bels, power gain = log10(27,000) = 4.431 B
In decibels, power gain 
= 10 x log10(27,000) = 10 × 4.431 = 44.31 dB
Example 17
An amplifier has a power gain of 33 dB. What 
input power will be required to produce an output 
power of 11 W?
Now power gain expressed in decibels will be 
given by:

You might like to practice with a few values, for 
example:
log10(56) = 1.748
log10(1.35) = 0.1303
log10(4,028) = 3.605
log10(195,891) = 5.292
log10(0.3175) = −0.4983
Finally, there’s another advantage of using 
logarithmic units (i.e. Bels and decibels) in 
electronics. If two values are multiplied together 
the result is equivalent to adding their values 
expressed in logarithmic units. 
To put all of this into context, let’s assume that 
the following items are connected in the signal 
path of an amplifier (see Fig. A8.33):
Pre-amplifier; input power = 1 mW, output power 
= 80 mW
Tone control; input power = 80 mW, output power 
= 20 mW
Power amplifier; input power = 20 mW, output 
power = 4 W

set to 1. 
The name given to the constant, e, is the 
exponential constant and it has a value of 
approximately 2.713. The value of the constant 
is normally accessible from your calculator (in 
the same way that the value of π is stored as a 
constant in your calculator).
Finally, let’s take a look at a practical example of 
the exponential function involving the discharge of 
a capacitor.

Note that the antilog or ‘inverse log’ function can 
be found using your calculator. This sometimes 
appears as a button marked ‘10x‘ or is obtained 
by pressing ‘shift’ (to enable the inverse function) 
and then ‘log’. In any event, you should refer 
to your calculator’s instruction book for more 
information on the keystrokes required!
Exponential growth and decay
In electronics we are often concerned with how 
quantities grow and decay in response to a 
sudden change. In such cases the laws that apply 
are the same as those that govern any natural 
system. The formula that relates to exponential 
growth takes the form:
(
)
=
−
y
Y
e x
1
max
while that which relates to exponential decay 
takes the form:
=
−
y
Y
e x
max
In the case of exponential growth, the value 
Ymax is simply the maximum value for y. In other 
words, it is approximately the value that y will 
reach after a very long time (note that, even 
though y gets very close in value to it, Ymax is 
never quite reached).
In the case of exponential decay, the value Ymax 
is the initial value of y. In other words, it is the 
value of y before the decay starts. After a very 
long period of time, the value of y will reach 
approximately zero (note that, even though y 
gets very close in value to zero, it is never quite 
reached).
Fig. A8.34 shows a graph showing exponential 
growth while Fig. A8.35 shows a graph showing

Fig. A8.36 illustrates this relationship.
Example 18
A capacitor is charged to a potential of 100 V. It is 
then disconnected from its charging source and 
left to discharge through a resistor. If it takes 10 s 
for the voltage to fall to 50 V, how long will it take 
to fall to 10 V?
Here we are dealing with exponential decay. If 
we use y to represent the capacitor voltage at 
any instant, and since the initial voltage is 100 V, 
we can determine the value of x (i.e. x1) when 
the voltage reaches 50 V by substituting into the 
formula:
￼

A surplus ATX computer power supply can 
provide the basis of an excellent low-cost fixed-
voltage bench power unit. Such a unit can be 
removed from a scrapped PC and will only 
require a few external components and a suitable 
enclosure in order to operate as a versatile stand-
alone power supply (see Fig. A10.1). The standard 
wiring of the 20-way ATX power connector is 
shown in Fig. A10.2 and the maximum output
