Preface
Since 1994 when the last edition of the present monograph was published, the ﬁeld of Nonlin-
ear Science has developed tremendously. It is nowadays no longer possible to give a compre-
hensible introduction into, and a balanced overview of the different branches within this ﬁeld.
Following the general practice of the previous editions it is the scope of this fourth augmented
edition to introduce aspects of Nonlinear Dynamics at a level which is accessible to a wide
audience. We have intensiﬁed and added three new topics:
– Control of chaos is one of the most popular branches of Nonlinear Science. As a partic-
ular new aspect we have included a comprehensive discussion of time-delayed feedback
control which is widely used in applications.
– Topics in synchronization became recently quite popular from a fundamental as well as
an applied point of view. We introduce basic concepts as well as novel notions like phase
synchronization or strange nonchaotic, attractors, at an elementary level.
– Spatiotemporal chaos covers a wide range of topics, from classical ﬁelds in physics such
as hydrodynamics to current research topics in theoretical biophysics, which are com-
monly related with the nonlinear dynamics of a large number of degrees of freedom. We
introduce here basic features of relevant model systems as well as selected concepts for
quantitative analysis. But our exposition is far from complete.
The fourth edition beneﬁts from data and ﬁgures that have been provided by several col-
leagues, in particular by R. Klages, J. Kurths, A. Pikovski, H. Posch, and M. Rosenblum. It
is a pleasure to thank E. Sch¨oll for his kind hospitality during a stay at Berlin University of
Technology, where parts of the new edition were written. We are indebted to the publisher, in
particular to Dr. M. B¨ar and R. Schulz, for their continual help in preparing the manuscript.
Despite the remarkable support from various people the present edition could still contain
mistakes. We apologize in advance for such inconsistencies and we invite the reader to report
to us any deﬁciencies.

Preface
Preface to the Third Edition
Since the last edition of this book in 1989 the ﬁeld of deterministic chaos has continued to
grow. Within the wealth of new results there are three major trends.
– Unstable periodic orbits have been rediscovered as building blocks of chaotic dynamics,
especially through the work of Cvitanovich et al. (1990). They developed an expansion
of physical averages in terms of primitive cycles (see also Appendix H).
– Exploiting the concept of unstable periodic orbits, Ott, Grebogi and Yorke demonstrated
in 1990 that deterministic chaos can be controlled. They found that small time-dependent
changes in the control parameter of the system can stabilize previously unstable periodic
cycles in such a way that the system becomes nonchaotic (see Chapter 10).
– There are new theoretical and experimental results in the ﬁeld of quantum chaos which
are described excellently in the new books by Gutzwiller (1990), Haake (1991) and Re-
ichl (1992).
During the preparation of the new edition, J. C. Gruel helped with the pictures of the new
chapter, Mrs. H. Heimann typed the new text, M. Poulson and R. Wengenmayr from VCH
Publishers took care of the editorial work. H. J. Stockmann and H. J. Stein contributed the
fascinating pictures of simulations of quantum chaos in microwave resonators. I would like to
thank all these people for their cooperation and patience.

Preface to the Second Edition
This is a revised and updated version of the ﬁrst edition, to which new sections on sensitive
parameter dependence, fat fractals, characterization of attractors by scaling indices, the Farey
tree, and the notion of global universality have been added. I thank P. C. T. de Boer, J. L.
Grant, P. Grassberger, W. Greulich, F. Kaspar, K. Pawelzik, K. Schmidt, and S. Smid for
helpful hints and remarks, and Mrs. Adlﬁnger and Mrs. Boffo for their patient help with the
manuscript.

Preface to the First Edition
Daily experience shows that, for many physical systems, small changes in the initial condi-
tions lead to small changes in the outcome. If we drive a car and turn the steering wheel only
a little, our course will differ only slightly from that which the car would have taken without
this change. But there are cases for which the opposite of this rule is true: For a coin which is
placed on its rim, a slight touch is sufﬁcient to determine the side on which it will fall. Thus

Preface

the sequence of heads and tails which we obtain when tossing a coin exhibits an irregular or
chaotic behavior in time, because extremely small changes in the initial conditions can lead
to completely different outcomes. It has become clear in recent years, partly triggered by the
studies of nonlinear systems using high-speed computers, that a sensitive dependence on the
initial conditions, which results in a chaotic time behavior, is by no means exceptional but is
a typical property of many systems. Such behavior has, for example, been found in period-
ically stimulated cardiac cells, in electronic circuits, at the onset of turbulence in ﬂuids and
gases, in chemical reactions, in lasers, etc. Mathematically, all nonlinear dynamical systems
with more than two degrees of freedom, i. e.,, especially many biological, meteorological or
economic models, can display chaos and, therefore, become unpredictable over longer time
scales. “Deterministic chaos” is now a very active ﬁeld of research with many exciting results.
Methods have been developed to classify different types of chaos, and it has been discovered
that many systems show, as a function of an external control parameter, similar transitions
from order to chaos. This universal behavior is reminiscent of ordinary second-order phase
transitions, and the introduction of renormalization and scaling methods from statistical me-
chanics has brought new perspectives into the study of deterministic chaos. It is the aim of
this book to provide a self-contained introduction to this ﬁeld from a physicist’s point of view.
The book grew out of a series of lectures, which I gave during the summer terms of 1982 and
1983 at the University of Frankfurt, and it requires no knowledge which a graduate student
in physics would not have. A glance at the table of contents shows that new concepts such
as the Kolmogorov entropy, strange attractors, etc., or new techniques such as the functional
renormalization group, are introduced at an elementary level. On the other hand, I hope that
there is enough material for research workers who want to know, for example, how deter-
ministic chaos can be distinguished experimentally from white noise, or who want to learn
how to apply their knowledge about equilibrium phase transitions to the study of (nonequilib-
rium) transitions from order to chaos. During the preparation of this book the manuscripts,
preprints and discussion, the remarks of G. Eilenberger, K. Kehr, H. Leschke, W. Selke, and
M. Schmutz were of great help. P. Berge, M. Dubois, W. Lauterborn, W. Martienssen, G.
Pﬁster and their coworkers supplied several, partly unpublished, pictures of their experiments.
H. O. Peitgen, P. H. Richter and their group gave permission to include some of their most
fascinating computer pictures in this book (see cover and Section 6.4). All contributions are
gratefully appreciated. Furthermore, I want to thank W. Greulich, D. Hackenbracht, M. Heise,
L. L. Hirst, R. Liebmann, I. Neil, and especially I. Procaccia for carefully reading parts of the
manuscript and for useful criticism and comments. I also acknowledge illuminating discus-
sions with V. Emery, P. Grassberger, D. Grempel, S. Grossmann, S. Fishman, and H. Horner.
It is a pleasure to thank R. Hornreich for the kind hospitality extended to me during a stay
at the Weizmann Institute, where several chapters of this book were written, with the support
of the Minerva foundation. Last but not least, I thank Mrs. Boffo and Mrs. Knolle for their
excellent assistance in preparing the illustrations and the text.

I. Biperiodic ﬂow in a B´enard experiment. Figs. 1–8 show interferometric pictures of a
B´enard cell in the biperiodic regime; that is, there are two incommensurate frequencies
in the power spectrum (see also pages 2.1.2–2.1.2). The time between successive pictures
is 10 s. The ﬁrst period lasts 40 s after which the “mouth” in the middle of the pictures

a subharmonic route f0 →f0/2 →f0/4 →chaos. This picture is the colored version of

1 Introduction
Ante mare et terras et, quod tegit omnia,
caelum Unus erat toto naturae vultus in
orbe, Quem dixere Chaos, rudis
indigestaque moles Nec quicquam nisi
pondus iners congestaque eodem Non
bene iunctarum discordia semina rerum.
Ovid
It seems appropriate to begin a book which is entitled “Deterministic Chaos” with an expla-
nation of both terms. According to the Encyclopaedia Britannica the word “chaos” is derived
from the Greek “χαoσ” and originally meant the inﬁnite empty space which existed before
all things. The later Roman conception interpreted chaos as the original crude shapeless mass
into which the Architect of the world introduces order and harmony. In modern usage which
we will adopt here, chaos denotes a state of disorder and irregularity.
In the following, we shall consider physical systems whose time dependence is determin-
istic, i. e., there exists a prescription, either in terms of differential or difference equations, for
calculating their future behavior from given initial conditions. One could assume naively that
deterministic motion (which is, for example, generated by continuous differential equations) is
rather regular and far from being chaotic because successive states evolve continuously from
each other. But it was already discovered at the turn of the century by the mathematician H.
Poincar´e (1892) that certain mechanical systems, whose time evolution is governed by Hamil-
ton’s equations, could display chaotic motion. Unfortunately, this was considered by many
physicists as a mere curiosity, and it took another 70 years until, in 1963, the meteorologist
E. N. Lorenz found that even a simple set of three coupled, ﬁrst-order, nonlinear differential
equations can lead to completely chaotic trajectories. Lorenz’s paper, the general importance
of which is recognized today, was also not widely appreciated until many years after its publi-
cation. He discovered one of the ﬁrst examples of deterministic chaos in dissipative systems.
In the following, deterministic chaos denotes the irregular or chaotic motion that is gen-
erated by nonlinear systems whose dynamical laws uniquely determine the time evolution of
a state of the system from a knowledge of its previous history. In recent years – due to new
theoretical results, the availability of high speed computers, and reﬁned experimental tech-
niques – it has become clear that this phenomenon is abundant in nature and has far-reaching
consequences in many branches of science (see the long list in Table 1, which is far from
complete).

We note that nonlinearity is a necessary, but not a sufﬁcient condition for the generation
of chaotic motion. (Linear differential or difference equations can be solved by Fourier trans-
formation and do not lead to chaos.) The observed chaotic behavior in time is neither due to
external sources of noise (there are none in the Lorenz equations) nor to an inﬁnite number
of degrees of freedom (in Lorenz’s system there are only three degrees of freedom) nor to
the uncertainty associated with quantum mechanics (the systems considered are purely clas-
sical). The actual source of irregularity is the property of the nonlinear system of separating
initially close trajectories exponentially fast in a bounded region of phase space (which is,
e. g., three-dimensional for Lorenz’s system).
It becomes therefore practically impossible to predict the long-time behavior of these sys-
tems, because in practice one can only ﬁx their initial conditions with ﬁnite accuracy, and
errors increase exponentially fast. If one tries to solve such a nonlinear system on a computer,
the result depends for longer and longer times on more and more digits in the (irrational) num-
bers which represent the initial conditions. Since the digits in irrational numbers (the rational
numbers are of measure zero along the real axis) are irregularly distributed, the trajectory
becomes chaotic.
Lorenz called this sensitive dependence on the initial conditions the butterﬂy effect, be-
cause the outcome of his equations (which describe also, in a crude sense, the ﬂow of air in the
earth’s atmosphere, i. e., the problem of weather forecasting) could be changed by a butterﬂy
ﬂapping wings. This also seems to be conﬁrmed sometimes by daily experience.
The results described above immediately raise a number of fundamental questions:
– Can one predict (e. g., from the form of the corresponding differential equations) whether
or not a given system will display deterministic chaos?
– Can one specify the notion of chaotic motion more mathematically and develop quanti-
tative measures for it?
– What is the impact of these ﬁndings on different branches of physics?
– Does the existence of deterministic chaos imply the end of long-time predictability in
physics for some nonlinear systems, or can one still learn something from a chaotic
signal?

Figure 1: Classiﬁcation of systems which display deterministic chaos. (We consider in the following
only classical dissipative systems, i. e., no quantum systems with dissipation.)
The last question really goes to the fundaments of physics, namely the problem of predictabil-
ity. The shock which was associated with the discovery of deterministic chaos has therefore
been compared with that which spread when it was found that quantum mechanics only allows
statistical predictions.
Those questions mentioned above, to which some answers already exist, will be discussed
in the remainder of this book. It should be clear, however, that there are still many more
unsolved than solved problems in this relatively new ﬁeld.
The rest of the introduction takes the form of a short survey which summarizes the con-
tents of this book. Figure 1 shows that one has to distinguish between deterministic chaos
in dissipative systems (e. g., a forced pendulum with friction) and conservative systems (e. g.,
planetary motion which is governed by Hamilton’s equations).
The ﬁrst six chapters are devoted to dissipative systems. We begin with a review of some
representative experiments in which deterministic chaos has been observed by different meth-
ods. As a next step, we explain the mechanism which leads to deterministic chaos for a simple
model system and develop quantitative measures to characterize a chaotic signal. This allows
us to distinguish different types of chaos, and we then show that, up to now, there are at least
three routes or transitions in which nonlinear systems can become chaotic if an external con-
trol parameter is varied. Interestingly enough, all these routes can be realized experimentally,
and they show a fascinating universal behavior which is reminiscent of the universality found
in second-order equilibrium phase transitions. (Note that the transitions to chaos in dissipative
systems only occur when the system is driven externally, i. e., is open.) In this context, univer-
sality means that there are basic properties of the system (such as critical exponents near the
transition to chaos) that depend only on some global features of the system (for example, the
dimensionality).
The most recent route to chaos has been found by Grossmann and Thomae (1977), Feigen-
baum (1978), and Coullett and Tresser (1978). They considered a simple difference equation
which, for example, has been used to describe the time dependence of populations in biology,
and found that the population oscillated in time between stable values (ﬁxed points) whose
number doubles at distinct values of an external parameter. This continues until the number
of ﬁxed points becomes inﬁnite at a ﬁnite parameter value, where the variation in time of the

4

Introduction
population becomes irregular. Feigenbaum has shown, and this was a major achievement, that
these results are not restricted to this special model but are in fact universal and hold for a large
variety of physical, chemical, and biological systems. This discovery has triggered an explo-
sion of theoretical and experimental activity in the ﬁeld. We will study this route in Chapter 4
and show that its universal properties can be calculated using the functional renormalization
group method.
A second approach to chaos, the so-called intermittency route, has been discovered by
Manneville and Pomeau (1979). Intermittency means that a signal which behaves regularly (or
laminarly) in time becomes interrupted by statistically distributed periods of irregular motion
(intermittent bursts). The average number of these bursts increases with the variation of an
external control parameter until the motion becomes completely chaotic. It will be shown in
Chapter 5 that this route also has universal features and provides a universal mechanism for
1/ f-noise in nonlinear systems.
Yet a third possibility was found by Ruelle and Takens (1971) and Newhouse (1978). In
the seventies they suggested a transition to turbulent motion which was different from that
proposed much earlier by Landau (1944, 1959). Landau considered turbulence in time as the
limit of an inﬁnite sequence of instabilities (Hopf bifurcations) each of which creates a new
basic frequency. However, Ruelle, Takens, and Newhouse showed that after only two instabil-
ities in the third step, the trajectory becomes attracted to a bounded region of phase space in
which initially close trajectories separate exponentially, such that the motion becomes chaotic.
These particular regions of phase space are called strange attractors. We will explain this con-
cept in Chapter 6, where we will also discuss several methods of extracting information about
the structure of the attractor from the measured chaotic time signal. The Ruelle–Takens–
Newhouse route is (as are the previous two routes) well veriﬁed experimentally, and we will
present some experimental data which show explicitly the appearance of strange attractors in
Chapter 7.
To avoid the confusion which might arise by the use of the word turbulence, we note that
what is meant here, is only turbulence in time. The results of Ruelle, Takens, and Newhouse
also concern the onset of turbulence or chaotic motion in time. It is in fact one of the aims (but
not yet the result) of the study of deterministic chaos in hydrodynamic systems, to understand
the mechanisms for fully developed turbulence, which implies irregular behavior in time and
space.
We now come to the second branch in Fig. 1, which denotes chaotic motion in conservative
systems. Many textbooks give the incorrect impression that most systems in classical mechan-
ics can be integrated. But as mentioned above, Poincar´e (1892) was already aware that, e. g.,
the nonintegrable three-body problem of classical mechanics can lead to completely chaotic
trajectories. About sixty years later, Kolmogorov (1954), Arnold (1963), and Moser (1967)
proved, in what is now known as the KAM theorem, that the motion in the phase space of
classical mechanics is neither completely regular nor completely irregular, but that the type of
trajectory depends sensitively on the chosen initial conditions. Thus, stable regular classical
motion is the exception, contrary to what is implied in many texts.
A study of the long-time behavior of conservative systems, which will be discussed in
Chapter 8, is of some interest because it touches on such questions as: Is the solar system
stable? How can one avoid irregular motion in particle accelerators? Is the self-generated
deterministic chaos of some Hamiltonian systems strong enough to prove the ergodic hypoth-

5
esis? (The ergodic hypothesis lies at the foundation of classical statistical mechanics and
implies that the trajectory uniformly covers the energetically allowed region of classical phase
space such that time averages can be replaced by the average over the corresponding phase
space.)
In Chapter 8 we consider the behavior of quantum systems whose classical limit displays
chaos. Such investigations are important, for example, for the problem of photodissociation,
where a molecule is kicked by laser photons, and one wants to know how the incoming energy
spreads over the quantum levels. (The corresponding classical system could show chaos be-
cause the molecular forces are highly nonlinear.) For several examples we show that the ﬁnite
value of Planck’s constant leads, together with the boundary conditions, to an almost-periodic
behavior of the quantum system even if the corresponding classical system displays chaos.
Although the difference between integrable and nonintegrable (chaotic) classical systems is
still mirrored in some properties of their quantum counterparts (for example in the energy
spectra), many problems in this ﬁeld remain unsolved.
As already mentioned in the preface, the ﬁeld of deterministic chaos continued to grow
after the last edition of this book in 1989. Especially the concept of unstable periodic orbits
has been rediscovered and developed further by Cvitanovich et al. (1990). Unstable periodic
orbits are the building blocks of chaotic dynamics, and their importance was already known
by Poincar´e (1892) and Ruelle (1978).
Exploiting this concept, Ott, Grebogi and Yorke showed in 1990 that deterministic chaos
can be controlled. As we will show in Chapter 10, unstable periodic orbits, which are con-
tained in all chaotic systems, can be stabilized by small time-dependent changes of the control
parameter of the system in such a way that the dynamical behavior becomes non-chaotic. Con-
trol of chaos is, because of its possible technical applications, an extremely active ﬁeld where
one would hope to make interesting new progress, especially for spatially coupled chaotic
systems.
Synchronization phenomena are related to control problems as, in very simple cases, a
desired state can be reached by external periodic modulation. But synchronization includes
much richer phenomena, especially when nonlinear and chaotic dynamical systems are con-
sidered. Chapter 11 presents a brief introduction into this ﬁeld.
The study of spatiotemporal chaotic motion is still in its infancy. In Chapter 12 we present
a selection of phenomena and approaches which may turn out to be among the cornerstones on
which a consistent and systematic exposition of this topic may be based. However, an ultimate
answer is currently not available.

2 Experiments and Simple Models
In the ﬁrst part of this chapter, we review some experiments in which deterministic chaos
has been detected by different methods. In the second part, we present some simple systems
which exhibit chaos and which can be treated analytically.
2.1
Experimental Detection of Deterministic Chaos
In the following section, we will discuss the appearance of chaos in four representative sys-
tems.
2.1.1
Driven Pendulum
Let us ﬁrst consider the surprisingly simple example of a periodically driven pendulum. Its
equation of motion is
¨θ+γ ˙θ+sinθ = Acos(ωt)
(2.1)
where the dot denotes the derivative with respect to time t, γ is the damping constant, and the
right hand side describes a driving torque with amplitude A and frequency ω. (The coefﬁcients
of ¨θ and sinθ have been normalized to unity by choosing appropriate units for t and A). This
equation has been numerically integrated for different sets of parameters (A, ω, γ), and Fig. 2
shows that the variation of the angle θ with time simply “looks chaotic” if the amplitude A of
the driving torque reaches a certain value Ac. This is a possible, but rather imprecise criterion
for chaos.
Before we proceed to improvements, three comments are in order. First, we would like
to recall the well-known fact that the linearized version of the pendulum equation can be
integrated exactly and does not lead to chaos. The emergence of chaos in the solutions of
eq. (2.1) is, therefore, due to the nonlinear term sinθ. Second, it follows from Fig. 2b and
2d that chaos sets in if the pendulum is driven over the summit where the system displays
sensitive dependence on initial conditions (a tiny touch determines, at θ = π, whether the
pendulum makes a left or right turn). Third, we would like to point out that as a function of
the parameters A and ω, the behavior of the pendulum switches rather wildly between regular
and chaotic motion, as shown in Fig. 2e.

2.1.2
Rayleigh–B´enard System in a Box
Chaotic motion means that the signal displays an irregular and aperiodic behavior in time. To
distinguish between multiply periodic behavior (which can also look rather complicated) and
chaos, it is often convenient to Fourier-transform the signal x(t):
x(ω) = lim
T→∞
Z T
0
dt eiωt x(t) .
(2.2)
For multiply periodic motion, the power spectrum
P(ω) ≡|x(ω)|2
(2.3)
consists only of discrete lines of the corresponding frequencies, whereas chaotic motion
(which is completely aperiodic) is indicated by broad noise in P(ω) that is mostly located at
low frequencies. Such a transition from periodic motion to chaos is presented in the second
line of Table 2 which shows the power spectrum of the velocity of the liquid in the x-direction
for a B´enard experiment.
In the B´enard experiment, a ﬂuid layer (with a positive coefﬁcient of volume expansion) is
heated from below in a gravitational ﬁeld, as shown in Fig. 3. The heated ﬂuid at the bottom
“wants” to rise, and the cold liquid at the top “wants” to fall, but these motions are opposed by
viscous forces. For small temperature differences ∆T, viscosity wins; the liquid remains at rest
and heat is transported by uniform heat conduction. This state becomes unstable at a critical
value Ra, of the Rayleigh number R (which is proportional to ∆T, see Appendix A), and a
state of stationary convection rolls develops. If R increases, a transition to chaotic motion is
observed beyond a second threshold Rc.
In order to avoid the appearance of complex spatial structures, actual experiments to de-
tect chaos (in time) in a Rayleigh–B´enard system are usually performed in a small cell (see
Fig. 3c). The boundary conditions limit the number of rolls, that is the number of degrees
of freedom that are counted by the number of Fourier components needed to describe the
spatial structure of the ﬂuid pattern. Besides ∆T, the observed dynamical behavior depends
sensitively on the liquid chosen and on the linear dimensions (a, b, c) of the box (see, for
example, Libchaber and Maurer, 1982). Table 2 shows the power spectrum of the velocity in
Figure 3: The Rayleigh–B´enard instability. a) and b) Transition from heat conduction to convection
rolls in an inﬁnitely extended two-dimensional ﬂuid layer. c) Experiments to detect deterministic chaos
in time are performed in a “match box”.

chemicals, and c1 ...cN(t) are the output concentrations.
where σ and b are dimensionless constants which characterize the system, and r is the control
parameter which is proportional to ∆T. The variable X is proportional to the circulatory ﬂuid
ﬂow velocity, Y characterizes the temperature difference between ascending and descending
ﬂuid elements, and Z is proportional to the deviations of the vertical temperature proﬁle from
its equilibrium value. A numerical analysis of this apparently simple set of nonlinear differ-
ential equations shows that its variables can exhibit chaotic motion above a threshold value
rc (see Appendix B). It should be noted, however, that the Lorenz equations describe the
B´enard experiment only in the immediate vicinity of the transition from heat conduction to
convection rolls because the spatial Fourier coefﬁcients retained by Lorenz only describe sim-
ple rolls. The chaos found by Lorenz in eqs. (2.4a–c) is, therefore, different from the chaos
seen in the experimental power spectrum in Table 2. To describe the experimentally observed
chaos, many more spatial Fourier components have to be retained.
2.1.3
Stirred Chemical Reactions
Another system in which chaotic motion has been studied experimentally in great detail is the
Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction. In this chemical process, an organic molecule (e. g., malonic
acid) is oxidized by bromate ions; the oxidation is catalyzed by a redox system (Ce4+/Ce3+).
The reactants, which undergo 18 elementary reaction steps (see Epstein et al., 1983), are:
Ce2(SO4)3, NaBrO3, CH2(COOH)2, and H2SO4.
It is not our aim to describe these reactions in detail but to demonstrate that stirred chemical
reactions provide convenient model systems to study the onset of chaos. Figure 4 shows how
a chemical reaction is maintained in a steady state away from equilibrium by continuously
pumping the chemicals into a ﬂow reactor where they are stirred to ensure spatial homogeneity.
For example, the reaction
A+B
k1⇌
k2
C
(2.5)
is described by the equations:
˙cA
=
−k1cAcB +k2cC −r[cA −cA(0)]
(2.6a)
˙cB
=
−k1cAcB +k2cC −r[cB −cB(0)]
(2.6b)
˙cC
=
k1cAcB −k2cC −r
(2.6c)

Experiments and Simple Models
where eq. 2.6a can be interpreted as follows. The concentration cA decreases due to colli-
sions between A and B (which generate C), increases due to decays of C (into A and B),
and decreases if the ﬂow rate r increases since for k1 = k2 = 0, eq. 2.6a can be integrated to
cA(t)−cA(0) ∼exp(−rt).
Generalizing, the reactions of M chemicals of concentrations ci can be described by a set
of ﬁrst-order nonlinear differential equations
˙ci = gi{c j}−r[ci −ci(0)] ≡Fi{c j, λ}
(2.7)
where the function gj{c j} involves nonlinear terms of the form c2
i and cicj if three-body colli-
sions are neglected. The reactions can be studied as a function of the set of control parameters
λ ≡{ci(0),k j,r} that involves the initial concentrations {ci(0)}, the temperature dependent
reaction velocities {k j} and the ﬂow rate r. Since r inﬂuences all individual reactions and can
be easily manipulated by changing the pumping rate of the chemicals, it is usually used as the
only control parameter.
Let us now come back to the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction. The variable which signals
chaotic behavior in this system is the concentration c of the Ce4+ ions. It is measured by the
selective light absorption of these ions. The mean residence time of the substances in the open
reactor (i. e., r−1) acts as an external control parameter corresponding to ∆T in the previous
experiment.
Table 2 shows a transition to chaos in this system which is detected via the change in the

This function measures the correlation between subsequent signals. It remains constant or
oscillates for regular motion and decays rapidly (mostly with an exponential tail) if the signals
become uncorrelated in the chaotic regime (Roux et al., 1981).

H´enon–Heiles System
Let us ﬁnally have a look at a simple nonintegrable example from classical mechanics that dis-
plays chaotic motion. In 1964 H´enon and Heiles numerically studied the canonical equations
of motion of the Hamiltonian
H = 1

Figure 5: Equipotential lines V(r,θ) = const. of the H´enon–Heiles system [eq. (2.12)] in polar coordi-
nates.
This equation describes, in Cartesian coordinates q1 and q2, two nonlinearly coupled harmonic
oscillators and, in polar coordinates (r,θ), a single particle in a noncentrosymmetric potential
V(r,θ) = r2

(2.12)
that is obtained from 1/2(q2
1 +q2

1q2 −1/3 q3
2 via q1 = rcosθ and q2 = rsinθ (see Fig. 5).
Their investigation was motivated by empirical evidence that a star moving in a weakly
disturbed cylindrically symmetric potential should have, in addition to the energy E, another
constant of the motion I. This would imply that, for bounded motion, the trajectory of the
H´enon–Heiles system in phase space
⃗x(t) = [p1(t), p2(t), q1(t), q2(t)]
(2.13)
where p1, p2 are the momenta, is conﬁned (via E[⃗x(t)] = const. and I[⃗x(t)] = const.) to a
two-dimensional closed surface. In order to check this proposal, H´enon and Heiles followed
a method introduced by Poincar´e (1893) and plotted the points in which the trajectory ⃗x(t)
cuts the (p2,q2) plane. If the motion would be conﬁned to a two-dimensional manifold, these
points should form closed curves corresponding to the cut of the two-dimensional closed sur-
face with the (p2,q2) plane. The last line in Table 2 shows that, at low energies, different
initial conditions in the H´enon–Heiles system indeed lead to closed curves in the Poincar´e
map. However, for high enough energy (which acts as control parameter for this system) the
lines decay, and the points in the Poincar´e map of the H´enon–Heiles model become plane-
ﬁlling. This indicates, according to Fig. 6, highly irregular chaotic motion in phase space and
the absence of an additional constant of the motion I.
To summarize:
1. We have presented four possible criteria for chaotic motion:
– The time dependence of the signal “looks chaotic”.
– The power spectrum exhibits broadband noise.
– The autocorrelation function decays rapidly.
– The Poincar´e map shows space-ﬁlling points.
In all four criteria, chaos is indicated by a qualitative change. Later, we will introduce
some more quantitative measures to characterize deterministic chaos.

Experiments and Simple Models
Figure 6: Qualitatively different trajectories can be distinguished by their Poincar´e sections: a) chaotic
motion; b) approach of a ﬁxed point; c) cycle; d) cycle of period two.
2. A common feature of the systems listed in Table 2 is that they can be characterized by
low-dimensional ﬁrst-order differential equations
˙⃗x = ⃗F(⃗x,λ);
⃗x = (x1 ...xd)
(2.14)
that are autonomous (i. e., ⃗F does not contain the time explicitly) and nonlinear (⃗F is a
nonlinear function of the {xj}).
These equations lead to chaotic motion if an external control parameter λ (which can be the
amplitude of the driving torque for the pendulum or the temperature difference ∆T in the
Lorenz model, etc.) is varied. One distinguishes between conservative systems, for which a
volume element in phase space {⃗x} only changes its shape but retains its volume in the course
of time (an example is the H´enon–Heiles Hamiltonian system for which the Liouville theorem
holds) and dissipative systems, for which volume elements shrink as time increases (see also
Chapter 7).
It is often convenient to study the ﬂow described by the equations of motion (2.14) via the
corresponding (d −1)-dimensional Poincar´e map
⃗x(n+1) = ⃗G[⃗x(n), λ];
⃗x(n) = [x1(n),...xd−1(n)]
(2.15)
that is generated by cutting the trajectory in d-dimensional phase space with a (d −1)-dimen-
sional hyperplane (see Fig. 6) and by denoting the points which are generated with increasing
time by ⃗x(1), ⃗x(2)... etc. The classiﬁcations “conservative” and “dissipative” can then be
generalized from ﬂows to maps [see Chapter 6, eqs. (6.6a, b)].

Figure 7: Hierarchy for the levels of description of dynamical systems
Let us ﬁnally comment on the way in which we shall proceed with our description of
real physical systems. One can generally distinguish several levels of description as shown in
Fig. 7.
A typical example of such a reduction process is given in Appendix A where the Navier–
Stokes equations (which already represent a coarse grained description of molecular motion)
are, for the boundary conditions of a B´enard experiment, reduced to the three differential
equations of the Lorenz model which lead in turn to different Poincar´e maps (see Figs. 49,
67) corresponding to different parameter values. Another example has been given by Haken
(1975) who reduced the quantum mechanical equations for a single mode laser to a system of
three rate equations (which is equivalent to the Lorenz system) by concentrating on macro-
scopic photon densities and using the adiabatic approximation (“Slaving principle”).
In the following, we shall not be concerned with the details of this reduction process since
the step from microscopic equations to differential equations for macroscopic variables has
already been covered in several excellent books (Haken 1982, 1984), and the reduction of
differential equations to Poincar´e maps can be done numerically. It should also be clear that
this reduction of a many-constituent system to a map, which describes only a few degrees of
freedom, is not always possible; a counterexample would be fully developed spatio-temporal
turbulence. Nevertheless, since it has been found experimentally effective for many physical
systems (see the following chapters), we shall in the remainder of this book concentrate mostly
on the last level in Fig. 7 where the dynamics of a system has been reduced to a one- or two-
dimensional Poincar´e map. We shall use these maps as starting points for our description of
chaotic systems in the same sense as one uses the (coarse grained) Ginzburg–Landau Hamil-
tonian to derive universal properties of second-order phase transitions (Wilson and Kogut,
1974). It will then be shown that only some general features of these maps (such as, for exam-
ple, the existence of a simple maximum) determine how chaos emerges. The various “routes
to chaos” differ in the way in which the signal behaves before becoming completely chaotic.

16

Experiments and Simple Models
Although universal features of several routes to chaos have been discovered and veriﬁed
experimentally it should be stated explicitly that it is presently practically impossible to theo-
retically predict, for example, from the Navier–Stokes equations with given boundary condi-
tions, the route to chaos for a given experimental hydrodynamic system. This situation could
be compared to ordinary second-order phase transitions where one knows a lot about univer-
sality classes and critical exponents (for example, of magnetic systems) but where it is still a
formidable and often unsolved problem to predict the transition temperature of a given magnet
(Ma 1976). However, this limitation should not disappoint us. The beauty of physics reveals
itself only after asking the right questions, and it seems, from the results summarized in this
book (see especially Table 12 on page 158) that it is equally so for dynamical systems where
the question about universal features has led to the discovery of a beautiful unifying pattern
behind different phenomena in this ﬁeld.
2.2
The Periodically Kicked Rotator
One of the simplest dynamical systems which displays chaotic behavior in time is the period-
ically kicked damped rotator shown in Fig 8. Its equation of motion is
¨ϕ+Γ˙ϕ = F ≡K f(ϕ)
∞
∑
n=0
δ(t −nT),
ninteger
(2.16)
where the dot denotes the time derivatives; Γ is the damping constant, T is the period between
two kicks, and we normalize the moment of inertia to unity. If we make the substitutions
x = ρ, y = ˙ρ, z = t, eq. (2.16) can be rewritten as a system of ﬁrst-order nonlinear autonomous
differential equations
˙x

(2.17c)
These can be reduced to a two-dimensional map for the variables (xn,yn) = limε→0[x(nT −
ε),y(nT −ε)] by integration. The general solution of (2.17b) for (n+1)T −ε > t > nT −ε is

This yields
yn+1 = e−ΓT[yn +K f(xn)]
(2.18a)
and by integrating (2.17a) using (2.18a) we obtain:
xn+1 = xn + 1−e−ΓT
Γ
[yn +K f(xn)] .
(2.18b)
Equations (2.18a) and (2.18b) are the main results of this section. They reduce the initial set
of three-dimensional differential equations to a two-dimensional discrete map, which yields
a stroboscopic picture of the variables. Below, we list several important limits of this two-
dimensional map which will be discussed in some detail in the following sections.
2.2.1
Logistic Map
This is a one-dimensional quadratic map deﬁned by
xn+1 = rxn(1−xn)
(2.19)
where r is an external parameter, and the range of xn is changed from a circle to the interval
[0, 1]. It can be obtained from (2.18b) in the strong damping limit (Γ →∞) if K →∞, so that
Γ/K = 1 and f(xn) = (r −1)xn −rx2
n.
2.2.2
H´enon Map
This can be considered as a two-dimensional extension of the logistic map (H´enon, 1976):
xn+1
=
1−ax2
n +yn
(2.20a)
yn+1
=
bxn
(2.20b)
where a and |b| ≤1 are external parameters.
To obtain this map from (2.18a) and (2.18b), we rewrite these equations as
yn+1
=
e−ΓT[yn +K f(xn)]
(2.21a)
xn+1
=
xn + eΓT −1
Γ
yn+1
(2.21b)
and solve (2.21b) for yn+1:
yn+1 = (xn+1 −xn)Γ/(eΓT −1) .
(2.22)
If we put yn+1 and yn back into (2.21a), this becomes for T = 1:
xn+1 + e−Γxn−1 = (1+ e−Γ)xn + 1−e−Γ
Γ
K f(xn) .
(2.23)
Choosing
1−e−Γ
Γ
K f(xn) ≡−(1+ e−Γ)xn −1+ax2
n;
b ≡−e−Γ ,
(2.24)
eq. (2.23) yields
xn+1 = 1−ax2
n +bxn−1
(2.25)
which is equivalent to (2.20a–b). (Our derivation holds only for b < 0, but the map is mathe-
matically deﬁned for −1 ≤b ≤1.)

2.2.3
Chirikov Map
This is simply the map of an undamped (Γ →0) rotator that is kicked by an external force
K f(xn) = −K sinxn (Chirikov, 1979). In this limit eq. (2.18a) and (2.18b) reduce to
pn+1
=
pn −K sinθn
(2.26a)
θn+1
=
θn + pn+1
(2.26b)
where we have chosen T = 1 and introduced the conventional notation xn = θn and yn = pn.
We shall see in the following chapters that, despite the apparent simplicity of all three
maps, their iterates exhibit extremely rich and physically interesting structures.

3 Piecewise Linear Maps and Deterministic Chaos
The nonlinear Poincar´e maps introduced in the previous chapter still lead to a rather compli-
cated dynamical behavior (as we shall see in Chapter 4). In this section, we therefore study
some simple one-dimensional piecewise linear maps. Although these maps are not directly
connected to physical systems, they are extremely useful models which, in part one of this
section, allow us to explain the mechanism which leads to deterministic chaos. In the second
part, we will introduce three quantitative measures which characterize chaotic behavior and
calculate these quantities explicitly for a triangular map. Finally, in Section 3.3 we show that
the iterates of certain one-dimensional maps can display deterministic diffusion.
3.1
The Bernoulli Shift
Let us consider the one-dimensional map
xn+1 = σ(xn)−2xn mod1;
n = 0, 1, 2...
(3.1)
which is shown in Fig 9. If we start with a value x0 the map generates a sequence of iterates x0,
x1 = σ(x0), x2 = σ(x1) = σ(σ(x0)). .. In order to investigate the properties of this sequence
we write x0 in binary representation:
x0 =
∞
∑
ν=1
aν2−ν ˆ=(0, a1 a2 a3 ...)
(3.2)
where aν has the values zero or unity. For x0 < 1/2, we have a1 = 0, and x0 > 1/2 implies
a1 = 1. Therefore, the ﬁrst iterate σ(x0) can be written as
σ(x0) =

2x0
for
a1 = 0 →
2x0 −1
for
a1 = 0 →
= (0, a2 a3 a4 ...)

Figure 10: Emergence of ergodicity by a Bernoulli shift in irrational numbers.
i. e., the action of σ on the binary representation of x is to delete the ﬁrst digit and shift the
remaining sequence to the left. This is called the Bernoulli shift.
The Bernoulli property of σ(x) demonstrates:
1. The sensitive dependence of the iterates of σ on the initial conditions. Even if two points
x and x′ differ only after their nth digit an, this difference becomes ampliﬁed under the
action of σ, and their nth iterates σn(x) and σn(x′) already differ in the ﬁrst digit because
σn(x) = (0,an ...) where σ2(x) = σ[σ(x)], etc.
2. The sequence of iterates σn(x0) has the same random properties as successive tosses of
a coin. To see this, we attach to σn(x0) the symbol R or L depending on whether the
iterate is contained in the right or left part of the unit interval. If we now prescribe an
arbitrary sequence RLLR..., e. g., by tossing a coin, we can always ﬁnd an x0 for which
the series of iterates x0, σ1(x0), σ2(x0) ... generates this sequence. This follows because
σn(x0) = (0, anan+1 ...) corresponds to R or L if and only if an = 1 or an = 0; i. e., the
sequence RLLR...is isomorphous to the binary representation of x0
x0

(0,

(3.4)
Thus, the prescription of a sequence by tossing a coin becomes equivalent to choosing a
special value of x0.
3. The mechanism by which ergodicity emerges in a deterministic system. Let us ﬁrst
note that we can approximate each point x in the unit interval arbitrarily well by a ﬁnite
sequence of binary digits 0, a1, a2 ...an up to a difference ε = 2−n, say. It will now
be shown that the images σr(x0) (r = l, 2, 3. .. ) of an “arbitrary” irrational number
x0 ∈[0, 1] approach x to an order ε an inﬁnite number of times; i. e., the system behaves
ergodically.
This follows because a) almost all irrational numbers in [0, 1] (with the exception of a set
of measure zero) in their binary representation contain any ﬁnite sequence of digits inﬁnitely
often (see References on page 261) and b) the Bernoulli property of σ(x) shifts these sequences
to the initial position as depicted in Fig. 10. This argument goes right to the heart of the
problem of chaotic motion in deterministic systems, and it shows how chaos arises from the
ampliﬁcation of the intrinsic “numerical noise” of irrational numbers.
This mechanism of generating deterministic chaos is also quite universal. Its two basic
ingredients are the stretching and backfolding property of the map.

3.2
Characterization of Chaotic Motion
21
Figure 11: Stretching and folding of the unit interval under the action of σ(x).
Initially, for x0 < 1/2 say, x0 becomes stretched after each iteration by a factor 2 (see
Fig. 11). But for n > n0 with 2n0 ·x0 ≥1, the second branch of σ(x) becomes important, and
xn is folded back to the unit interval as shown in Fig. 11. For a general nonlinear map of the
unit interval onto itself, the combination of stretching and backfolding (due to the restriction
to [0, 1]) drives the iterates of an initial point repeatedly over the unit interval and leads to
chaotic motion.
Let us brieﬂy comment on the possible physical consequences of this stretching property
of nonlinear maps. The initial conditions (i. e., the x0) of a physical system can only be de-
termined with ﬁnite precision. This “arbitrarily” small but ﬁnite error becomes exponentially
ampliﬁed (σn(x0) = 2nx0 mod1) via the nonlinear evolution equation. Such an equation thus
acts like a microscope which makes the limits of our precision in physical measurements vis-
ible. Can we, therefore, anticipate that the concept of the continuum with its distinction of
rational and irrational numbers is non-physical and that all physical variables will be quan-
tized? (The Heisenberg uncertainty relation, which limits the precision of our observations
for conjugate variables, has also been found in a gedanken experiment in which one tries to
measure the location and the momentum of an electron via a light microscope with arbitrary
accuracy.) This and related questions, and speculations, are discussed in an interesting article
by J. Ford in Physics Today, April 1983.
3.2
Characterization of Chaotic Motion
In this section, we introduce the Liapunov exponent as well as the invariant measure and
the correlation function as quantitative measures to characterize the chaotic motion which is
generated by one-dimensional Poincar´e maps.
3.2.1
Liapunov Exponent
We have already seen in the previous section that adjacent points become separated under the
action of a map
xn+1 = f(xn)
(3.5)
which leads to chaotic motion. The Liapunov exponent λ(x0) measures this exponential sep-
aration as shown in Fig. 12. From Fig. 12 one obtains:
εeNλ(x0) = |f N(x0 +ε)−f N(x0)|
(3.6)

.
This means that eλ(x0) is the average factor by which the distance between closely adjacent
points becomes stretched after one iteration.
The Liapunov exponent also measures the average loss of information (about the position
of a point in [0, 1]) after one iteration. In order to see this, we use in eq. (3.7) the chain rule

(3.9)
As a next step, we discuss the loss of information after one iteration with a linear map. We
separate [0, 1] into n equal intervals and assume that a point x0 can occur in each of them with
equal probability 1/n. By learning which interval contains x0, we gain the information
I0 = −
n
∑
i=1
1
n ld1
n = ldn
(3.10)
where ld is the logarithm to the base 2 (see Appendix F). If we decrease n, the information I0 is
reduced, and it becomes zero for n = 1. It is shown in Fig. 13 that a linear map f(x) changes
the length of an interval by a factor a = |f ′(0)|. The corresponding decrease of resolution
leads to a loss of information after the mapping:
∆I = −

Generalizing this expression to a situation where |f ′(x)| varies from point to point and, aver-
aging over many iterations, leads to the following expression for the mean loss of information:
∆I = −lim

which is, via eq. (3.9), proportional to the Liapunov exponent:
λ(x0) = (log2)·|∆I| .
(3.13)
This relation between the Liapunov exponent and the loss of information is a ﬁrst step towards
characterization of chaos in a coordinate-invariant way, as will be explored on a deeper level
in Chapter 6.
By way of an example, we now calculate the Liapunov exponent for the triangular map,
∆(x) = r

(3.14)
shown in Fig. 14. The function ∆(x) serves as a useful model because, for r > 1/2, it gen-
erates chaotic sequences x0, ∆(x0), ∆[∆(x0)]..., and due to its simple form, all quantities that
characterize the chaotic state can be calculated explicitly.
In order to get acquainted with this map, we ﬁrst consider its ﬁxed points and their stability
for different values of r.
Generally, a point x∗is called a ﬁxed point of a map f(x) if
x∗= f(x∗)
(3.15)
i. e., the ﬁxed points are the intersections of f(x) with the bisector.
A ﬁxed point is locally stable if all points x0 in the vicinity of x∗are attracted to it, i. e., if

Figure 15 a shows that for r < 1/2 the origin x = 0 is the only stable ﬁxed point to which all
points [0, 1] are attracted. For r > 1/2 two unstable ﬁxed points emerge. Figure 15b shows
how, for r = l, the iterates of x0 and x′
0 move away from the “ﬁxed points” x1 = 0 and x2 = 2/3,
respectively. In the following, we shall consider only the case r = 1, which is representative
for r > 1/2.
What can we say about a sequence of iterates if there are no stable ﬁxed points? First of
all we notice that points which are close together, become more and more separated during
the ﬁrst iterations, as shown in Fig. 16. If we plot the nth iterate ∆n(x), we see from Fig. 16
that again it is piecewise linear and has the slope

x0, x0 + ε grows exponentially with n after n iterations, and the Liapunov exponent becomes
(independent of x0):
λ = log2 .
(3.19)
For the general triangular map, eq. (3.14), the Liapunov exponent simply becomes λ = log2r,
and for r > 1/2 we have λ > 0; i. e., we lose information about the position of a point in [0, 1]
after an iteration, whereas r < 1/2 implies λ < 0, and we gain information because all points
are attracted to x∗= 0.
The Liapunov exponent changes sign at r = 1/2 and, therefore, acts like an “order param-
eter”, which indicates the onset of chaos, as shown in Fig. 17. To make the analogy to critical
phenomena even closer, we observe that λ = log2r scales with a power law near the “critical
point” rc = 1/2.
λ ∝(r −rc) .
(3.20)
This shows that even the simple transition to chaos in the triangular map displays some fea-
tures that are reminiscent of an equilibrium phase transition. As we have already mentioned
before, we will investigate this aspect more generally in Chapter 4. It should also be noted
here that the deﬁnition of the Liapunov exponent can be extended to higher dimensional maps.
This will be treated in Chapter 6, where we will also discuss the relation between the Liapunov
exponent and the Kolmogorov entropy and its possible connection to the Hausdorff dimension.
But before we come to these problems, we will ﬁrst investigate the question of how the iterates
of a one-dimensional map are distributed over the unit interval.

The invariant measure ρ(x) determines the density of the iterates of a unimodular map
xn+1 = f(xn),
xn ∈[0, 1],
n = 0, 1, 2,...
(3.21)
over the unit interval and is deﬁned via

Piecewise Linear Maps and Deterministic Chaos
If ρ(x) does not depend on x0, the system is called ergodic (see also Section 8.2.2). For this
case, eq. (3.22) allows us to write “time averages” over a function g(x) as averages over the
invariant measure,

(3.23)
This is the one-dimensional analog of the thermodynamic average in classical statistical me-
chanics which allows us (if the motion in phase space is ergodic) to replace the time average
by an ensemble average over a stationary distribution ρ:
lim
T→∞

dt A[⃗x(t)] =
Z
d⃗x ˜ρ(⃗x)A(⃗x) .
(3.24)
Here A is a function of the time-dependent vector ⃗x = [⃗p(t), ⃗q(t)] which is composed of the
coordinates⃗q and momenta ⃗p which follow Hamilton’s equations,
˙qi = ∂H
∂pi
,
˙pi = −∂H
∂qi
(3.25)
and ˜ρ is, for example, the microcanonical distribution ˜ρ = δ[H(⃗x)−E] for an isolated system
of energy E. Note, however, that our one-dimensional example corresponds to a dissipative
system [see e. g., Chapter 2, eq. (2.15)] whereas Hamilton’s equations (3.25) describe a con-
servative model.
For Hamiltonian systems, the dynamical behavior of a general density distribution ρ(⃗x,t)
in phase space is described by Liouvilles’s equation:
˜ρ(⃗x,t) = −iLρ(⃗x,t)
(3.26)
where
L = i
	∂H
∂⃗p
∂
∂⃗q −∂H

∂⃗p

(3.27)
is the Liouville operator.
The corresponding evolution equation for our one-dimensional model whose time evolu-
tion is given by the map (3.21) can be derived as follows. If we have a point x0, it evolves to
f(x0) after one iteration. This means that a delta-function distribution δ(x−x0) evolves after
one time step to δ[x−f(x0)] which can be written as
δ[x−f(x0)] =
Z 1
0 dyδ[x−f(y)]δ(y−x0) .
(3.28)
Generalizing this to the evolution of an arbitrary density ρn(x) at time n we obtain the so-called
Frobenius–Perron equation
ρn+1(x) =
Z
dyδ[x−f(y)]ρn(y)
(3.29)
which governs the time evolution of ρn(x). The invariant measure ρ(x) has to be station-
ary because eq. (3.23) makes sense only if ρ(x) is independent of time n, that is, ρ(x) is an
eigenfunction of the Frobenius–Perron operator with eigenvalue 1:
ρ(x) =
Z 1
0 dyδ[x−f(y)]ρ(y) .
(3.30)

Characterization of Chaotic Motion

Formally, this equation has many solutions (e. g., δ(x −x∗) where x∗= f(x∗) is an unstable
ﬁxed point). But fortunately, only one of the solutions is physically relevant, namely that one
which is, for example, obtained by solving eq. (3.30) on a computer. In the presence of weak
random noise (which is caused by rounding errors in the computer or physical ﬂuctuations in
real systems), the probability to hit an unstable repelling ﬁxed point x∗is zero, and therefore
such spurious solutions are automatically eliminated (Eckmann and Ruelle, 1985). In the
following, the invariant measure ρ(x), always means the physically relevant invariant measure
which is stable if a small random noise is added to the system.
Let us consider again, as an example, the triangular map at r = 1:
∆(x) =

2x
for
x ≤1
2
2(1−x)
for
x > 1

(3.31)
In this case, eq. (3.30) becomes:
ρ(x) = 1


(3.32)
which has the obvious normalized solution ρ(x) = 1.
We can also show that this solution is unique. Starting from an arbitrary normalized dis-
tribution ρ0(x), and operating on it n times with (3.29), yields
ρn(x) = 1

= 1 .
(3.34)
This means that, for the triangular map at r = 1, the chaotic sequence of iterates x0, f(x0),
f(f(x0)) ...uniformly covers the interval [0, 1], and the system is ergodic. As in the case of
the Liapunov exponent, we will later study invariant density for more complicated maps and
show that it is not always a constant.
3.2.3
Correlation Function
The correlation function C(m) for a map (3.21) is deﬁned by
C(m) = lim
N→∞
1
N
N−1
∑
i=0
ˆxi+m ˆxi
(3.35)
where
ˆxi = f i(x0)−¯x;
¯x = lim
N→∞
1
N
N−1
∑
i=0
f i(x0) .
(3.36)
From this deﬁnition follows that C(m) yields another measure for the irregularity of the se-
quence of iterates x0, f(x0), f 2(x0)... It tells us how much the deviations of the iterates from
their average value,
ˆxi = xi −¯x
(3.37)
that are m steps apart (i. e., ˆxi+m and ˆxi) “know” about each other, on the average.

Figure 18: The ﬁrst and second iterates ∆1, 2(y + 1/2) are symmetric about y = 0; the triangular areas
are independent of m = 1, 2.
If the invariant measure ρ(x) for a given map f(x) is known, C(m) can be written in the
following form:
C(m) =
Z 1
0 dxρ(x)x f m(x)−
	Z 1
0 dxρ(x)x

(3.38)
Here, we used the commutative property of the iterates,
xi+m = f i+m(x0) = f i f m(x0) = f m f i(x0) .
(3.39)
We, therefore, ﬁnd for the example of the triangular map:

i. e., the sequence of iterates is delta-correlated.
This result follows because a) ∆n(y + 1/2) is symmetric about y = 0; therefore, the ﬁrst
integral in (3.40b) vanishes for m > 0, and b) the second integral is independent of m, as shown
in Fig. 18. To summarize:
We have found for a general one-dimensional map that a sequence x0, f(x0).. . f n(x0). . .
can be characterized a) by a Liapunov exponent, which tells us how adjacent points become
separated under the action of f; b) by the invariant density, which serves as a measure of how
the iterates become distributed over the unit interval; and c) by the correlation function C(m),
which measures the correlation between iterates that are m steps apart.
For the triangular map, the Liapunov exponent is λ = log2r, which changes its sign at
r = 1/2. It therefore serves as an order parameter for the onset of chaos. For r = 1, the chaotic
state is characterized by a constant stationary density ρ(x) = 1 and delta-correlated iterates,
i. e., C(m) = (1/12) δm,0.

3.3
Deterministic Diffusion
29
3.3
Deterministic Diffusion
In this section, we show that the iterates of certain one-dimensional periodic maps diffuse.
This diffusion indicates that the reduced map generates chaotic motion.
One normally associates diffusion with the Brownian motion of a particle in a liquid.
Its equation of motion, in the case of high friction where the acceleration term ∝¨x can be
neglected, is
˙x ∝ξ(t) .
(3.41)
The ξ(t) are random forces, which are generated by the thermal agitation of the molecules. If
one assumes, as usual, that the ξ(t) are Gaussian-correlated,
⟨ξ(t)⟩= 0;
⟨ξ(t)ξ(t′)⟩∝δ(t −t′)
(3.42)
one obtains from eqs. (3.41) and (3.42):
⟨x(t)⟩= 0
and
⟨x2(t)⟩∝t .
(3.43)
This means that the squared distance from the origin increases linearly with time if the particle
is kicked by random forces (in contrast to x2 ∝t2 for a constant force k ∝˙x). One can show,
with a little more effort, that (3.43) also remains valid (for t →∞) if the acceleration term is
retained [see, for example, Haken’s book on Synergetics (1982)].
Let us now have a look at the piecewise linear periodic map
xτ+1 = F(xτ) = xτ + f(xτ);
τ = 0, 1, 2,...
(3.44)
where f(xτ) is periodic in xτ,
f(xτ +n) = f(xτ),
n = 0, ±1, ±2...,
(3.45)
shown in Fig. 19.
Figure 19: Piecewise linear periodic map with a diffusive trajectory (after Grossmann, 1982).

Piecewise Linear Maps and Deterministic Chaos
Figure 20: Decomposition of a piecewise linear map.
One sees that the trajectory moves slowly away from the origin. Now we will show that
this motion is in fact diffusive. However, this diffusion is not generated by random forces (as
in the case of Brownian motion discussed above), but rather because the trajectory loses its
“memory” within one or several boxes due to chaotic motion. To substantiate this statement,
we calculate ⟨x2⟩explicitly for the map (3.44).
We decompose the coordinate of a trajectory into the box number Nτ and the position
yτ ∈[0, 1] within a box (Grossmann, 1982):
xτ = Nτ +yτ .
(3.46)
The map (3.44) then becomes
Nτ+1 +yτ+1 = F(Nτ +yτ) = Nτ +yτ + f(yτ)
(3.47)
which is equivalent to the coupled dynamical laws:
Nτ+1 −Nτ = [yτ + f(yτ)] ≡∆(yτ)
(3.48a)
yτ+1 = yτ + f(yτ)−[yτ + f(yτ)] ≡g(yτ)
(3.48b)
where [z] denotes the integer part of z. Figure 20 shows the function ∆(yτ), which is an integer
number, describing the magnitude of the jump, and g(xτ) gives the remaining part of the
coordinate at τ+1 .
Using (3.48a), the distances to the origin can be written as
Nt =
t−1
∑
τ=0
(Nτ+1 −Nτ) =
t−1
∑
τ=0
∆(yτ),
for
N0 = 0 .
(3.49)
This yields for the mean squared distance:

where the average ⟨...⟩is over all initial conditions y0, and we assumed for simplicity ⟨Nt⟩= 0.
For the case when the motion generated by g(y) is so chaotic that there are no correlations
among the yτ, i. e.,
⟨∆(yλ)∆(yτ)⟩∝δλ,τ
(3.51)
one ﬁnds from (3.47):

(3.53)
The step from (3.52) to (3.53) is only possible if g(y) has an invariant density that obeys
ρ(y) =
Z
dxδ[g(x)−y]ρ(x) .
(3.54)
Equation (3.53) means that ⟨N2
t ⟩increases linearly with t, i. e.,
⟨N2

for
t ≫1
(3.55)
with a diffusion coefﬁcient
D ≡1
2
Z
dyρ(y)∆2(y) .
(3.56)
It should be clear from the derivation that diffusion occurs as long as the yτ’s are sufﬁciently
uncorrelated such that the two sums in (3.50) contract to a single sum. (For completely corre-
lated motion of the yτ’s, ⟨N2
t ⟩becomes proportional to t2.) This means that the mere presence
of diffusion for a periodic map indicates chaotic motion which destroys correlations within
one box. We will generalize and use this characterization of chaos to some extent in Chap-
ter 9, where we discuss area-preserving maps.
Let us ﬁnally derive a simple scaling law for the diffusion coefﬁcient that has a purely
geometric origin. If the intervals δ, through which the trajectories can move from cell to cell,
are small enough (such that one can neglect the variation of ρ in this region, i. e., ρ(x ∈δ) = ¯ρ),
then eq. (3.56) can be written as
D ≈1
2 ¯ρδ
(3.57)
because ∆2 has only the values zero or unity. Figure 21 shows that D scales like
D ∝(a−1)1/z
(3.58)
if the map f(x) has a maximum (and minimum) of order z.

4 Universal Behavior of Quadratic Maps
In this chapter, we study the logistic map
xn+1 = fr(xn) = rxn(1−xn)
(4.1)
shown in Fig. 22. It has already been shown in Chapter 2 that eq. (4.1) describes the angles
xn of a strongly damped kicked rotator. But the logistic map, which is, arguably, the simplest
nonlinear difference equation, appears in many contexts.
It has already been introduced in 1845 by P. F. Verhulst to simulate the growth of a pop-
ulation in a closed area. The number of species xn+1 in the year n + 1 is proportional to the
number in the previous year xn and to the remaining area, which is diminished, proportionally,
to xn, i. e., xn+1 = rxn(1−xn) where the parameter r depends on the fertility, the actual area of
living, etc.
Another example is a savings account with a self-limiting rate of interest (Peitgen and
Richter, 1984). Consider a deposit z0 which grows with a rate of interest ε as zn+1 = (1 +
ε)zn = ...(1 + ε)n+1z0. To prohibit unlimited wealth, some politician could suggest that the
rate of interest should be reduced proportionally to zn+1, i. e., ε →ε0(1−zn/zmax). Then the
account develops according to zn+1 = [1+ε0(1−zn/zmax)]zn which becomes equal to eq. (4.1)
for xn = znε0/zmax(1+ε0) and r = 1+ε0.
One could expect for both examples that due to the feedback mechanism the quantities
of interest (population and bank account) develop towards mean values. But as found by
Grossmann and Thomae (1977), by Feigenbaum (1978), and by Coullet and Tresser (1978),
and many others (see May, 1976, for earlier references) the iterates x1, x2, ... of eq. (4.1)
display, as a function of the external parameter r, a rather complicated behavior that becomes
chaotic for large r (see Fig. 23).

Universal Behavior of Quadratic Maps
Once can, therefore, understand the conclusion that May (1976) draws at the end of his
article in Nature: “Perhaps we would all be better off, not only in research and teaching, but
also in everyday political and economical life, if more people would take into consideration
that simple dynamical systems do not necessarily lead to simple dynamical behavior.”
However, chaotic behavior is not tied to the special form of the logistic map. Feigenbaum
has shown that the route to chaos that is found in the logistic map, the “Feigenbaum route”,
occurs (with certain restrictions which will be discussed below) in all ﬁrst-order difference
equations xn+1 = f(xn) in which f(xn) has (after a proper rescaling of xn) only a single maxi-
mum in the unit interval 0 ≤xn ≤1. It was found by Feigenbaum that the scaling behavior at
the transition to chaos is governed by universal constants, the Feigenbaum constants α and δ,
whose value depends only on the order of the maximum (e. g., quadratic, i. e., f ′(xmax) = 0,
f ′′(xmax) < 0, etc.). Because the conditions for the appearance of the Feigenbaum route are
rather weak (it is practically sufﬁcient that the Poincar´e map of a system is approximately
one-dimensional and has a single maximum), this route has been observed experimentally in
many nonlinear systems.
The following sections of this chapter contain a rather detailed derivation of the universal
properties of this route. We begin with a summary, which is intended to be a guide through
the more mathematical parts.
Section 4.1 gives an overview of the numerical results for the iterates of the logistic map.
It shows that the number of ﬁxed points of fr(x) (towards which the iterates converge) doubles
at distinct, increasing values of the parameter rn. At r = rn the number of ﬁxed points becomes
inﬁnite; and beyond this (ﬁnite) r-value, the behavior of the iterates is chaotic for most values
of r.
In Section 4.2, we investigate the pitchfork bifurcation, which provides the mechanism for
the successive doubling of ﬁxed points. It is shown that the doubling can be understood by ex-
amining the image of even iterates (f[f(x)], f[f[f[f(x)]]], . .. ) of the original map f(x). This
relates the generation of new ﬁxed points to a law of functional composition. We, therefore,
introduce the doubling transformation T that describes functional composition together with
simultaneous rescaling along the x- and y-axis (T f(x) = −αf[f(−x/α)]) and show that the
Feigenbaum constant α (which is related to the scaling of the distance between iterates) can be
calculated from the (functional) ﬁxed point f ∗of T (T f ∗= f ∗). This establishes the universal
character of α. The other Feigenbaum constant δ (which measures the scaling behavior of the
rn-values) then appears as an eigenvalue of the linearized doubling transformation.
After having provided a method of calculating universal properties of the iterates, we con-
sider several applications in Section 4.3. As a ﬁrst step, we determine the relative separations
of the iterates and show that the iterates form (at the accumulation point r∞) a self-similar
point set with a fractal dimensionality. We then Fourier-transform the distribution of iterates
to obtain the experimentally measurable, and therefore important, power spectrum.
In any real dissipative nonlinear system, there are, due to the coupling to other degrees of
freedom, also ﬂuctuating forces, which when they are incorporated explicitly into the differ-
ence equations, tend to wash out the ﬁne structure of the distribution of iterates. We determine
the inﬂuence of this effect on the power spectrum and show that the rate at which higher
subharmonics become suppressed, scales via a power law with the noise level.
Up to this point, we have only considered the behavior of the iterates near the transition
to chaos. It will be shown next that in the chaotic region (r∞≤r ≤4) periodic and chaotic

4.1
Parameter Dependence of the Iterates
35
r values are densely interwoven and one ﬁnds a sensitive dependence on parameter values.
We also discuss the concept of structural universality and calculate the invariant density of the
logistic map at r = 4.
Finally, in Section 4.5 we present a summary that explains the parallels between the
Feigenbaum route to chaos and ordinary equilibrium second-order phase transitions. This
chapter ends with a discussion of the measurable properties of the Feigenbaum route and a
review of some experiments in which this route has been observed.
4.1
Parameter Dependence of the Iterates
To provide an overview in this section, we present several results for the logistic map obtained
by computer iteration of eq. (4.1) for different values of the parameter r. Figure 23 shows the
accumulation points of the iterates {f n
r (x0)} for n > 300 as a function of r together with the
Liapunov exponent λ obtained via eq. (3.9).

Figure 24: Distances dn of the ﬁxed points closest to x = 1/2 for superstable 2n-cycles (schematically).
We distinguish between a “bifurcation regime” for 1 < r < r∞where the Liapunov ex-
ponent is always negative (it becomes only zero at the bifurcation points rn) and a “chaotic
region” for r∞< r ≤4, where λ is mostly positive, indicating chaotic behavior. The “chaotic
regime” is interrupted by r-windows with λ < 0 where the sequence {f n
r (x0)} is again peri-
odic.
The numerical results can be summarized as follows:
1. Periodic regime
(a) The values rn where the number of ﬁxed points changes from 2n−1 to 2n, scale like
rn = r∞−const.δ−n
for n ≫1 .
(4.2)
(b) The distances dn of the point in a 2n-cycle that are closest to x = 1/2 (see Fig. 24)
have constant ratios:
dn
dn+1
= −α
for n ≫1 .

(4.5)
furthermore
R∞= r∞= 3.5699456...

Pitchfork Bifurcation and the Doubling Transformation

2. Chaotic regime
(a) The chaotic intervals move together by inverse bifurcations until the iterates become
distributed over the whole interval [0, 1] at r = 4.
(b) The r-windows are characterized by periodic p-cycles (p = 3, 5, 6...) with succes-
sive bifurcations p, p·21, p·22 etc. The corresponding r-values scale like eq. (4.2)
with the same δ but different constants.
(c) Also, period triplings p·3n and quadruplings p·4n, etc. occur at ¯r = ¯r∞−const. δ−n
with different Feigenbaum constants ¯δ, which are again universal (e. g., ¯δ= 55.247...
for p·3n).
4.2
Pitchfork Bifurcation and the Doubling
Transformation
In this section, we show that the “Feigenbaum route” in Fig. 23 is generated by pitchfork
bifurcations that relate the emergence of new branches to a universal law of functional com-
position. By introducing the doubling transformation T (which describes this law), we show
that the Feigenbaum constants α and δ are indeed universal. They appear as the (negative
inverse) value of the eigenfunction of T at x = 1 and as the only relevant eigenvalue of the
linearized doubling operator, respectively.
4.2.1
Pitchfork Bifurcations
As a ﬁrst step, we investigate the stability of the ﬁxed points of fr(x) and f 2
r (x) = fr[fr(x)] as
a function of r. Figure 25 shows that fr(x) has, for r < 1, only one stable ﬁxed point at zero,
which becomes unstable for 1 < r < 3 in favor of x∗= 1−1/r.
For r > 3 = r1 we have |f ′
r(x∗)| = |2−r| > 1; i. e., x∗also becomes unstable according to
criterion (3.17). What happens then?

via a pitchfork bifurcation. (The bifurcation diagram looks like a pitchfork, see p. 159)
Figure 26 shows fr(x) together with its second iterate f 2
r (x) for r > r1. We note four
properties of f 2 (the index r is dropped for convenience):
1. It has three extrema with f 2′ = f ′[f(x)]f ′(x) = 0 at x0 = 1/2, because f ′(1/2) = 0, and
at x1,2 = f −1(1/2), because f ′[f[f −1(1/2)]] = f ′(1/2) = 0.
2. A ﬁxed point x∗of f(x) is also a ﬁxed point of f 2(x) (and all higher iterates).
3. If a ﬁxed point x∗becomes unstable with respect to f(x), it becomes also unstable
with respect to f 2 (and all higher iterates) because |f ′(x∗)| > 1 implies |f 2′(x∗)| =
|f ′[f(x∗)]f ′(x∗)| = |f ′(x∗) <2> 1.
4. For r > 3, the old ﬁxed point x∗in f 2 becomes unstable, and two new stable ﬁxed points
¯x1, ¯x2 are created by a pitchfork bifurcation (see Fig. 26b).
The pair ¯x1, ¯x2 of stable ﬁxed points of f 2 is called an attractor of f(x) of period two
because any sequence of iterates which starts in [0, 1] becomes attracted by ¯x1, ¯x2 in an
oscillating fashion as shown in Fig. 27.
It is easy to see that f(x) maps these new ﬁxed points of f 2 onto each other, i. e.,
f(¯x1) = ¯x2 and f(¯x2) = ¯x1
(4.6)
because f 2(¯x1) = ¯x1 implies
f f[f(x,)] = f[f[(x,)] = f(x,)
(4.7)
i. e., f(¯x1) is also a ﬁxed point of f 2, and ¯x2 is the only possible choice. (f(¯x1) = 0 or x∗are
at variance with f f(¯x1) = ¯x1.)

If we now increase r beyond a value r2 the ﬁxed points of f 2 also become unstable. Be-
cause the derivative is the same at ¯x1 and ¯x2
f 2′(¯x1) = f ′[f(¯x1)]f ′(¯x1) = f ′(¯x2)f ′(¯x1) = f 2′(¯x2)
(4.8)
they even become unstable simultaneously.
Figure 28 shows that after this instability the fourth iterate f 4 = f 2 · f 2 displays two more
pitchfork bifurcations which lead to an attractor of period four; i. e., one observes period
doubling. These two examples can be generalized as follows:
1. For rn−1 < r < rn there exists a stable 2n−1-cycle with elements x∗

2n−1−1, that is
characterized by

that, for rn < r < rn+1, lead to a new stable 2n-cycle.
Our last conclusion represents a ﬁrst step towards universality because it connects the mecha-
nism of subsequent bifurcations to a general law of functional composition.
Let us add as a caveat that not all quadratic maps of the unit interval onto itself display an
inﬁnite sequence of pitchfork bifurcations, but only those which have a negative Schwarzian
derivative (see Appendix C).
4.2.2
Supercycles
To progress further, we now consider the so-called supercycles. A 2n-supercycle is simply a
superstable 2n-cycle deﬁned by
d
dx∗
0
f 2n
Rn(x∗
0) = ∏
i
f ′
Rn(x∗
i ) = 0
(4.11)
which implies that it always contains x∗
0 = 1/2 as a cycle element because this is the only
point where f ′
r = 0. Referring to Fig. 24, we can see that the distances dn are just the distances
between the cycle elements x∗= 1/2 and x1 = f 2n−1
Rn

dn = f 2n−1

(4.12)
In the following it is convenient to perform a coordinate transformation that displaces x = 1/2
to x = 0 such that (4.12) becomes
dn = f 2n−1
Rn
(0) .
(4.13)
From the previous section, we see that eq. (4.3) implies
lim
n→∞(−α)ndn+1 = d1
(4.14)
i. e., the sequence of scaled iterates f 2n
Rn+1(0) converges:
lim
n→∞(−α)n f 2n
Rn+1(0) = d1 .
(4.15)
Figure 29 suggests that (4.15) can be generalized to the whole interval, and the rescaled
functions (−α)n f 2n
Rn+1(0)[x/(−α)n] converge to a limiting function g1(x):
lim
n→∞(−α)n f 2n
Rn+1

x
(−α)n

= g1(x)
(4.16)
Equation (4.16) shows that g1(x) is determined only by the behavior of f 2n
Rn+1 around x = 0 (see
also Fig. 28) and should, therefore, be universal for all functions f with a quadratic maximum.

By taking the limit i →∞in (4.18), the function

(4.21)
This equation determines α universally by
g(0) = −αg[g(0)] .
(4.22)
It can easily be shown that µg(x/µ) is also a solution of the ﬁxed-point equation (4.21) with
the same α. Thus, the theory has nothing to say about absolute scales, and we ﬁx µ by setting
g(0) = 1 .
(4.23)
Although a general theory for the solution of the functional equation (4.21) is still lacking,
we can obtain a unique solution if we specify the nature of the maximum of g(x) at x = 0
(for example quadratic) and require that g(x) is a smooth function. If we use for g(x) in the
quadratic case the extremely short power law expansion
g(x) = 1+bx2
(4.24)
the ﬁxed point equation (4.21) becomes
1+bx2 = −α(1+b)−

4.2.4
Linearized Doubling Transformation and δ
What can we say about the scaling along the r-axis? The values r = Rn for which a 2n-
cycle becomes superstable, are determined by the condition that x = 1/2 is an element of the
supercycle (see eq. (4.11), i. e., x = 1/2 is a ﬁxed point of f 2n
Rn (x):

(4.28)
which after translation by 1/2 becomes [see eqs. (4.12–4.13)]:
f 2n
Rn(0) = 0 .
(4.29)
This equation has a large number of solutions because it also yields the 2n-supercycles that oc-
cur in the windows of the chaotic regime. In order to single out the Rn-values in the bifurcation
region with
r1 < R1 < r2 < R2 < r3 ...,
(4.30)
Equation (4.29) is solved starting from n = 0, and the Rn are ordered as in eq. (4.30).
The Rn tell us how R∞is approached. In order to prove the scaling relation (4.5),
Rn −R∞∝δ−n ,
(4.31)
we expand fR(x) around fR∞(x):
fR(x) = fR∞(x)+(R−R∞)δf(x)+...
where
δf(x) ≡∂fR(x)

(4.32)
Let us now apply the doubling operator T to this equation. A straightforward linearization in
δf yields
T fR = TfR∞+(R−R∞)L fR∞δf +O[(δf)2]
(4.33)
where Lf is the linear operator

Repeated application of T yields
Tn fR = Tn fR∞+(R−R∞)LT n−1 fR∞...LfR∞δf +O[(δf)2] .
(4.35)

Lgϕv = λvϕv;
δf = ∑

v = 1, 2 ...

and assume that only one of the eigenvalues λν is larger than unity, i. e.,
λ1 > 1 ;

for v ̸= 1 .
(4.40)
We then obtain only the contribution from λ1 in (4.39),
Ln
gδf ∼= c1λn

(4.41)
and (4.37) reduces to
Tn fRn(x) ∼= g(x)+(R−R∞)·δn ·a·h(x)
for n ≫1
(4.42)
where we introduced c1 ≡α, ϕ1 ≡h, λ1 ≡δ.
The eigenvalue λ1 ≡δ is identical with Feigenbaum’s constant because for R = Rn and
x = 0, (4.42) yields
Tn fRn(0) = g(0)+(Rn −R∞)·δn ·a·h(0)
(4.43)
and from (4.29) we have the condition
Tn fRn(0) = (−α)n f 2n
Rn(0) = 0 .
(4.44)
This leads to the desired result (note g(0) = 1)
lim
n→∞(Rn −R∞)·δn =

a·h(0) = const .

(4.47b)
is again a universal function of µ.
At the bifurcation points, rn, the slopes always have the same value µ = 1 (see Fig. 30).
Therefore, the rn scale according to (4.47) with the same δ as the Rn of the superstable cycles
(with µ = 0):
rn −r∞∝δ−n
for n ≫1 .
(4.48a)
Note that the accumulation point is the same for all µ:
lim
n→∞Rn,µ = R∞= r∞
(4.48b)
because rn ≤Rn,µ ≤rn+1 and rn+1 −rn →0 for n →∞.

such that (4.49) becomes an algebraic equation for δ:
−α

g′ [g(0)]+1


(4.50a)
The value g′[g(0)] = g′(1) follows for functions with a quadratic maximum (i. e., g′′(0) ̸= 0)
by differentiating the ﬁxed-point equation (4.21) twice:

(4.50b)
Thus (4.50a) becomes
δ = α2 −α .
(4.50c)
(For functions with a maximum of order 2z one ﬁnds δ = α1+z −α.)
Using our previously determined value α = 2.73, we obtain δ = 4.72 from (4.50), i. e., an
accuracy of about 1% with respect to Feigenbaum’s numerical result δ = 4.6692016... This
is not so bad if one considers the crudeness of our approximation.
It is of course much more laborious to show that δ is indeed the only eigenvalue of Lg
which is larger than unity. Extensive computer calculations by Feigenbaum and the analytical
results of Collet, Eckmann, and Lanford (1980) have proven this assumption.
Summarizing, the two main results of this section are,
1. the ﬁxed-point equation for the doubling operator (4.21)
Tg(x) = −αg

g

−x
α


(4.51)
which establishes the universality of α;

2. the linearized doubling transformation (4.42)
Tn fR(x) = g(x)+(R−R∞)·δn ·a·h(x)
for n ≫1
(4.52)
which shows that δ is universal and determines the way in which a function is repelled
from the ﬁxed-point function g(x).
Universality emerges here because the linearized doubling operator Lg has only one rele-
vant eigenvalue λ1 > 1 such that all functions f(x) – with the exception of ϕ1(x) – renormal-
ize, after several applications of T, to the ﬁxed-point function g(x) because the eigenvalues
belonging to f −g = ∑ν̸=1 cνϕν are smaller than unity, i. e., are irrelevant.
4.3
Self-Similarity, Universal Power Spectrum, and the
Inﬂuence of External Noise
In this section, we calculate the distances between the elements of a 2n-cycle and determine its
power spectrum. It is then shown that external noise changes the power spectrum drastically
and destroys higher subharmonics. Finally, we discuss the bifurcation diagram for r > r∞and
show that the chaotic behavior of the iterates (of the logistic map) at r = 4 is related to the
chaos of a triangular map.
The power spectrum is an important tool for characterizing irregular motion. In order to
calculate this quantity for a system that exhibits the Feigenbaum route to chaos, we identify the
time variable with n and determine as a ﬁrst step the relative positions of the cycle elements.
4.3.1
Self-Similarity in the Positions of the Cycle Elements
All we know up to now about the positions of the cycle elements is that according to eqs. (4.3)
and (4.13) the distances dn(0) of the supercycle elements closest to x = 0 scale with α, i. e.,
dn+1(0)
dn(0)
= −1
α
for dn(0) = f 2n−1
Rn
(0), n ≫1 .
(4.53)
It is now our aim to generalize these equations. We will calculate for all m the distance dn(m)
of the mth element xm of a 2n-supercycle to its nearest neighbor f 2n−1
Rn
(xm),
dn(m) ≡xm −f 2n−1
Rn
(xm)
(4.54)
and the change of dn(m) if one increases n,
σn(m) ≡dn+1(m)
dn(m)
.
(4.55)
The function σ(m) changes sign after 2n cycle steps,
σn(m+2n) = −σn(m)
(4.56)
because
dn+1(m+2n)
=
f 2n
Rn+1(xm)−f 2n
Rn+1[f 2n
Rn+1(xm)]
=
f 2n
Rn+1(xm)−xm = −dn+1(m)
(4.57)
and dn(m) is left invariant (f 2n
Rn(xm) = xm).

4.3
Self-Similarity, Universal Power Spectrum, and the Inﬂuence of External Noise
47
Let us now consider the values m = 2n−1, i = 0...n, and evaluate σ(m) in the limit n ≫1.
The deﬁnitions (4.54), (4.55) yield
σn[2n−i]

Rn+1[f 2n−i

Rn+1(0)]
f 2n−i
R(n−i)+i(0)−f 2n−i
R(n−i)+i[f 2n−1
R(n−1)+1(0)]
and because
f 2l
Rl+j(x) ∼= (−α)−lgj[(−α)lx]
for l = n−i →∞
(4.59)
this becomes
σn[2n−i] = gi+1(0)−gi+1[(−α)−ig1(0)]
gi(0)−gi([(−α)−i+1g1(0)]
for n ≫1 .
(4.60)
We note that the functions gi(x) can be obtained from (4.17) and (4.43) for i ≫1:
gi(x) = lim
n→∞Tn fRn+1(x) = g(x)−δ−i ·h(x) .
(4.61)
For smaller i one uses the recursion eq. (4.18),
gi−1(x) = Tgi(x) .
(4.62)
If we introduce, for convenience, the new variable x =
m
2n+1 and drop the index n, the sym-
metry relation (4.56) reads
σ

x+ 1



(4.63)
This generates from our familiar scaling relation (4.53) the value of σ at x = 1/2:
σ(0) = −1


= −σ(0) = 1

(4.64)
But starting instead from (4.60) we obtain

=
lim
i→∞
g(0)−g[(−α)−ig1(0)]
g(0)−g[(−α)−i+1g1(0)] = 1

because
g[(−α)−ig1(0)] ≈g(0)+ 1

(4.66)
and from there and (4.63):
1
2 +0+

= −σ(0+) = −1
α2 .
(4.67)
This means that σ(x) is discontinuous at x = 0 and x = 1/2.
More elaborate calculations show that σ(x) jumps at all rationals as depicted in Fig. 31.
Fortunately, the discontinuities decrease rapidly as the number of terms in the binary expan-
sion of the rational increases, and it is therefore often sufﬁcient to consider only the jumps at
x = 0, 1/4, 1/2.

Universal Behavior of Quadratic Maps
Figure 31: The function σ(x) = σm (m = 2n ·x), n ≫1 [see eq. (4.55)] indicates how distances between
adjacent points change if one passes, for n ≫1, from a 2n- to a 2n+1-superstable cycle (after Feigenbaum,
1980).
4.3.2
Hausdorff Dimension
According to Fig. 31, the distances between nearby points in a supercycle change with univer-
sal ratios after each bifurcation. The self-similarity of this pattern can be characterized by the
Hausdorff dimension of the attractor.
If, for a set of points in d dimensions, the number N(l) of d-spheres of diameter l needed
to cover the set increases like
N(l) ∝l−D
for l →0
(4.68)
then D is called the Hausdorff dimension of the set. [The quantity deﬁned in eq. (4.68) is
actually the capacity dimension which agrees for our purposes with the Hausdorff dimension
whose rigorous deﬁnition is, e. g., elaborated in Falconer’s book on the Geometry of Fractal
Sets (1985)]. For the self-similar sets shown in Fig. 32, D can be calculated from
D = −log[N(l)/N(l′)]
log(l/l′)
(4.69)
We note that the length L of the Cantor set shown in Fig. 32 is indeed zero:

The Hausdorff dimension D∗of a 2n-cycle can be calculated in the limit n →∞as follows. If
for a 2n-supercycle we need N(l) = 2n segments of length l to cover all its points, then from
Fig. 31 it is found that the mean minimum length l′ to cover all N(l′) = 2n+1 cycles is given

This value differs only by 5 % from Grassberger’s (1981) analytical and numerical result

sively smaller segments l and counting N(l)).
Figure 33 demonstrates the typical Cantor-set structure of the attractor. We will now show
that this leads to a remarkably simple change in the measurable power spectrum after each
bifurcation step.

(4.74)
i. e., after each bifurcation step from n →n+1, 2n new subharmonics with frequencies k/2n+1
(k = 1, 3, 5, ...) are obtained, as shown in Fig. 34. The corresponding change in the an
k’s can
be calculated from σ(m).

differ by a factor µ−1 (after Collet and Eckmann, 1980).
Therefore, the amplitudes of the odd subharmonics, which appear after each bifurcation step,
are “in the mean” just the averaged amplitudes of the old odd components reduced by a con-
stant factor µ−1. (The many approximations which have been made in deriving (4.84) require
this cautious restriction to averages.) The universal pattern

found for the quadratic map f(x) = 1−1.401155x2 depicted in Fig. 35.
4.3.4
Inﬂuence of External Noise
The full details of this power spectrum cannot be observed experimentally because there will
always be some external noise due to the coupling to other degrees of freedom (see Fig. 36).
In order to discuss this perturbation quantitatively, we add a noise term ξn, to the logistic
equation:
xn+1 = fr(xn)+ξn
(4.86)
and calculate its inﬂuence on the cascade of bifurcations.
Here, ξn are Gaussian-distributed variables with averages
⟨ξnξn′⟩= σ2δn,n′
(4.87)
(similarly their Fourier components ξk are Gaussian-distributed), and σ measures the intensity
of the white noise. We recall that the new Fourier components |an+1
k
| of a 2n+1-cycle are a
factor of µ−1 smaller than the old components |an
k|. This means that any ﬁnite external noise
eventually suppresses all subharmonics above a certain n, as shown in Fig. 36c.
In fact the values R, (above which all subharmonics become unobservable because they
have merged into the chaos provided by the external noise) and the corresponding amplitude
σn are related by a power law
(R∞−Rn) ∝σγ
h
(4.88)
where γ = logδ/logµ.

corresponding quantities in the presence of external noise with amplitude σ = 10−3 (after Crutchﬁeld,

there is still a sharp transition to chaos which is indicated by the change of sign of λ in b). c) Suppression
of subharmonics in the presence of white noise σ. Note that the subharmonic amplitudes are reduced by
a factor µ−1 for n →n+1 (schematically).
This can be derived as follows: If at R1 a noise level σ1 is just sufﬁcient to suppress the
ﬁrst subharmonic |a1
k| then all |an
k| = µ−n|a1

The decrease of Rn with increasing noise amplitude as in (4.88) has been veriﬁed numeri-
cally as shown in Fig. 37.
The external noise, which produces chaos for Rn < R∞plays a similar role as a magnetic
ﬁeld which causes a ﬁnite magnetization above the critical point of a magnet. This analogy
has been worked out by Shraiman, Wayne, and Martin (1981) who have shown, for example,
that the Liapunov exponent scales in the presence of external noise like
λ = rβλ0[r−1/γσ] ;
β = log2/logδ ;
r = R∞−R
(4.90a)
or equivalently
λ = σθλ1[rσ−γ] ;
θ = log2/logµ

Feigenbaum and Hasslacher (1982) using a decimation of path integrals. Their method, which
has a wide range of potential applications, is explained in Appendix E. Equation (4.90a) is
reminiscent of the scaling behavior of the magnetization M at a second-order phase transition:
M = rβ f(r1/γh)
(4.91)
where r = |T −Tc| is the temperature distance to the critical point, and h is the magnetic ﬁeld.
For the onset of chaos, where λ changes sign, eq. (4.90a) yields
0 = λ0[r−1/γσ] →r−1/γ ·σ = const.
(4.92)
i. e., our equation (4.88).
4.4
Behavior of the Logistic Map for r∞≤r
Let us now discuss the behavior of the logistic map for r ≥r∞. We have already seen above
that at r∞the sequence of bifurcations ends in a set of inﬁnitely many points, the so-called
Feigenbaum attractor, which has a Hausdorff dimension D = 0.548... Figure 23 shows that
the Liapunov exponent λ of the logistic map at r∞is still zero, i. e., the Feigenbaum attractor is
no strange attractor (see Chapter 6 for the deﬁnition of this object). But according to Fig. 23,
λ becomes mostly positive for r > r∞, and it is therefore reasonable to say that chaos starts
at the end of the bifurcation region. Although the detailed behavior of the iterates (of the
logistic map) appears rather complicated in this region, it shows regularities which are again
dictated by the doubling operator and therefore universal. It will be shown in the ﬁrst part of
this section that for r∞< r, periodic and chaotic regions are densely interwoven, and one ﬁnds
a sensitive dependence on the parameter values. Next we discuss the structural universality
discovered by Metropolis, Stein and Stein (1973) which preceeded the work of Feigenbaum
(1978). Finally we calculate the invariant density at r = 4 and explain the scaling of the reverse
band-splitting bifurcations.
4.4.1
Sensitive Dependence on Parameters
Figure 32 shows that for r∞< r ≤4 “chaotic parameter values” r with λ > 0 and non-chaotic
r with λ < 0 are densely interwoven. Close to every parameter value where there is chaos,
one can ﬁnd another r value which corresponds to a stable periodic orbit, that is, the logistic
map displays a sensitive dependence on the parameter r. The practical implications of this
behavior are worse than those of sensitive dependence on initial conditions. When chaos
occurs, the only alternative is to resort to statistical predictions. But for sensitive dependence
on parameters, statistical averages become unstable under variations in parameters because the
average behavior of the system may be completely different in the periodic and in the chaotic
case.
Although there is a rigorous proof (Jacobson, 1981) that the total length of chaotic param-
eter intervals in r∞≤r ≤4 is ﬁnite, there remain the following questions:
– Which fraction of parameter values is chaotic?
– What is the probability that a change in the parameter values will lead to a change in
qualitative behavior. Since it is no longer possible to distinguish experimentally (i. e.,

µ(0) because only those holes that are bigger than the resolution l are deleted.
when one has ﬁnite precision) between chaotic and nonchaotic parameter values, one
can only make statistical predictions for the parameter dependence of the system.
An answer to these questions has been given by D. Farmer (1985) who calculated numer-
ically the coarse grained measure (i. e., total length) µ(l) of all chaotic parameter intervals for
f(x) = rx(1−x) and g(x) = rsin(πx). Coarse grained means that all nonchaotic holes on the
r axis, with a size larger than l, were deleted (see Fig. 39).
Figure 40 shows that µ(l) scales like
µ(l) = µ(0)+Alβ
(4.93)
where β = 0.45±0.05 is numerically the same for both maps, whereas µ(0) = 0.8979 (0.8929)
for f(x) and g(x) respectively.
The set of chaotic parameter values with a scaling behavior described by eq. (4.93) is an
example of a “fat” fractal. Fat fractals have, in contrast to the “thin” fractals considered on
page 49, a ﬁnite measure (i. e., volume). A typical example of a fat Cantor set is shown in
Fig. 41 which is obtained by deleting from the unit interval the central 1/3, 1/9, 1/27.. .of each
piece.
The remaining lengths scale like ln = 1/2[1−(1/3)n]ln−1. Using Nn = 2n, the Hausdorff
dimension D of this fat Cantor set becomes D = 1 via eq. (4.69). However, its volume scales

Via ln ∝(1/2)n for n →∞then follows:
µ(l)−µ(0) ∝lβ
with
β = log3/log2 .
(4.95)
Let us now come back to the physical meaning of eq. (4.93). It answers both questions
raised above. The measure µ(0) gives the fraction of chaotic parameter values in r∞< r < 4.
The exponent β determines the probability p that a variation in r will change the qualitative
behavior of the iterates. If one is sitting on a chaotic parameter value, p is proportional to the
probability of ﬁnding a nonchaotic hole of size l, that is, p ∝µ(l)−µ(0) ∝lβ.
This situation means, for numerical computations of the logistic map (which are usually
done with a precision l ∼10−14) that the odds of a mistake (i. e., that a trajectory believed to
be chaotic is actually periodic) are, for β ∼= 0.45, of the order 10−6, which is acceptable.
According to Farmer (1985), one speaks only then of sensitive dependence on parameters,
if β < 1 (i. e., if the odds of a mistake are larger than in the trivial case where one has p ∼l−1).
It has been found (Farmer, 1986) that the set of parameter values where quasiperiodic be-
havior occurs in the subcritical circle map is also a fat fractal (see Chapter 7). This implies sen-
sitive dependence on parameters which distinguish between quasi-periodic and mode-locked
behavior (i. e., sensitive parameter dependence is not necessarily tied to chaos). Let us ﬁnally
note that the fact that the exponent β is numerically the same for the logistic map f(x) and
the sine map g(x) indicates a sort of global universality which is different from that originally
found by Feigenbaum since it applies to a set of positive measure (volume) rather than just
special points as period-doubling transitions.
4.4.2
Structural Universality
Structural universality in unimodal maps was discovered by Metropolis, Stein and Stein
(1973). They considered the iterates of the logistic map f(x) in the periodic windows. Start-
ing from x0 = 1/2, i. e., from the x value which corresponds to the maximum of f(x), the

sequence of iterates f n(x0) on a periodic attractor can be characterized by a string RL...
where R or L indicates whether f n+1(x0) is to the right or left of x0 (see e. g., Fig. 42). Table 3,
which has been computed by Metropolis et al. (1973), shows that the sequence of strings is
(up to cycles of length 7) the same for f(x) = rx(1 −x) and g(x) = qsinπx. This numerical
result (which has actually been calculated for cycles up to length 11 and for other unimodal

maps) suggests that the ordering of the sequence of RL... strings is universal for all maps on
the [0, 1] interval which have a differentiable maximum and fall off monotonically on both
sides. This so-called structural universality has been put on a rigorous footing by Gucken-
heimer (1980). It does not depend on the order of the maximum as the metric universality
of Feigenbaum (1978) (a “metric” is needed there to measure the distances which scale).
But it should be noted that structural universality seems to be restricted to one-dimensional
maps because in higher dimensions, up to now, no ordering has been found, and one can have
coexisting cycles of different length with different basins of attraction (see also Section 6.4).
From the mathematical point of view, the sequence of cycles in an unimodal map f(x) is
completely described by Sarkovskii’s theorem (1964). It states that if f(x) has a point x which
leads to a cycle of period p then it must also have a point x′ which leads to a q-cycle for every
q ←p where q and p are elements in the following sequence:
1 ←2 ←4 ←8 ←16 ...2m ... ←
...2m ·9 ←2m ·7 ←2m ·5 ←2m ·3 ... ←
...22 ·9 ←22 ·7 ←22 ·5 ←22 ·3 ... ←
...2 ·9 ←2 ·7 ←2 ·5 ←2 ·3 ... ←
...
9 ←
7 ←
5 ←
3 ... ←
(4.96)
where the symbol ←means “precede” (for a proof, see references of this chapter). It should
be emphasized that Sarkovskii’s theorem is only a statement concerning different x values at a
ﬁxed parameter value. It says nothing about the stability of the periods nor about the range of
parameter values for which it could be observed. It follows, from the sequence in eq. (4.96),
that if f(x) has period three, then this implies that it must also have all periods n where n is
an arbitrary integer. This is the famous theorem of Li and Yorke (1975) “Period three implies
chaos”. But it should be noted that “chaos” in this theorem means only aperiodic behavior
and does not imply automatically a positive Liapunov exponent.
4.4.3
Chaotic Bands and Scaling

xn+1 = 4xn(1−xn) ≡f4(xn) ,
(4.97)
can actually be solved by the simple change of variables:
xn = 1

(4.98)
Then eq. (4.97) can be converted into

2[1−cos(2πyn+1)] = [1−cos(2πyn)][1+cos(2πyn)] =
1
2[1−cos(4πyn)]
(4.99)
which has one solution:

or
yn = 2ny0 mod1 .

These results show that the map fr(x) becomes ergodic for r = 4 and that the invariant
density of a chaotic map need not always be a constant.
For the Liapunov exponent eq. (4.104) yields at r = 4:
λ =
Z 1
0 dxρ4(x)|f ′(x)| = log2
(4.105)
i. e., the same value as for the map in eq. (4.100) which demonstrates that the Liapunov expo-
nent is indeed invariant under a change of the coordinates.
Figure 44 makes it plausible that the r-values for the inverse cascade (in which the chaotic
regime at r = 4, which extends from 0 ≤x ≤1, is decomposed into ﬁner and ﬁner subintervals
In that merge into the Feigenbaum attractor) are again determined by the law of functional
composition.

Parallels between Period Doubling and Phase
Transitions
In the ﬁrst part of this section we present a dictionary of the corresponding terms used in
the bifurcation route to chaos and in the renormalization-group theory for second-order phase
transitions. In the second part we summarize the measurable properties that characterize the
Feigenbaum route and discuss some representative experiments.
We have already seen in Chapter 3 that the Liapunov exponent corresponds to the order
parameter near a second-order phase transition. Table 4 shows that for the bifurcation route
to chaos the analogy to a magnetic phase transition can be worked out in more detail. Both
phenomena show a certain self-similarity (in the bifurcation pattern and in the pattern of spin-
up/spin-down clusters near a critical point) which forms the basis for a renormalization-group
treatment. Universality emerges then because there are only a few relevant eigenvalues (see
also Appendices E and D).

Experimental Support for the Bifurcation Route
After a preponderance of theory, let us now present some experimental support for the Feigen-
baum route. First, we summarize its measurable ﬁngerprints:
– There exists an inﬁnite cascade of period doublings which leads to subharmonics in the
power spectrum at frequencies 2−n · f0 where f0 is the basic frequency.
– Each subharmonic lies below the preceeding level by a factor µ−1 = 0.1525 (10log10 µ =
8.17 dB).
– The control parameter r scales for subsequent subharmonics n like rn −r∞∝δ−n.
– External noise destroys the ﬁne structure of the power spectrum, and the noise level must
decrease by a factor µ−1 to make one more subharmonic observable.
– The Poincar´e map of the system is one-dimensional and shows a single quadratic maxi-
mum.
Following Feigenbaum’s work, the bifurcation route to chaos has been found in many ex-
perimental systems, from the kicked pendulum and chemical reactions. .. to optically bistable
devices. Below we discuss three representative examples in more detail.
Figures 45 and 46 show the power spectra for a B´enard experiment and for a nonlinear
driven electrical RCL-oscillator.
The experimental set up for the B´enard experiment has already been described in Chap-
ter 2. (We note that depending on the parameters of the liquid, the size of the cell, etc., the
B´enard system exhibits different routes to chaos.) Libchaber and Maurer (1980) found the
following properties of the Feigenbaum route in a B´enard experiment with liquid helium:
1. With increasing temperature difference (which is proportional to the control parameter r)
there appear subharmonics of frequencies f/2, f/4, f/8 and f/16 where f is the basic
frequency.
2. Subsequent subharmonics differ by about 10 dB in qualitative agreement with theory
(µ ˆ=8.2 dB).
Higher subharmonics are probably suppressed by external noise.
Although these results leave little doubt that the Feigenbaum route is involved, the explicit
reduction of the hydrodynamic equations, which describe the system to a one-dimensional
Poincar´e map with a single quadratic maximum, has still not been demonstrated.
The situation is somewhat better for the nonlinear RCL-oscillator shown in Fig. 46. The
nonlinear element in this circuit is, according to Linsay (1981), the capacitor-diode, which
leads to the following nonlinear relation between charge q and voltage V:
V(g) =

1+ V(q)

(4.119)
The differential equation for the time dependence of q is
L ¨q+R ˙q+V(q) = V0 sin(2π f1t)
(4.120)

and the circuit acts like an analog computer for a driven nonlinear oscillator. Figure 46 shows
that for special values of V, (which is proportional to the control parameter r) the sequence
of current signals In = I(t0 + nT), where the time T = 1/f1, can indeed be generated from
a one-dimensional map with a quadratic maximum. (The current is related to the charge via
I = ˙q, and In corresponds to xn). The corresponding power spectrum exhibits, as expected,
all the features of the bifurcation route and yields an estimate for δ which deviates by 10 %
from Feigenbaum’s asymptotic value. See also the phase portraits (I(t) versus V(t)) for the
nonlinear RCL-oscillator of Lauterborn et al. (1984) in Plate I at the beginning of the book.
We note also that there exists theoretical (Rollins and Hunt, 1982) and experimental (S. Mar-

tin, priv. comm.) evidence that the chaotic behavior of RCL-oscillators with Varactor diodes
(which were used in the experiments above) is not caused by the nonlinearity of the diode but
by its large recovery time. But, this situation can again be described by a one-dimensional
noninvertible map.
To demonstrate that the Feigenbaum route indeed occurs in quite different systems, we
ﬁnally describe an experiment by Lauterborn and Cramer (1981) in which this route has been
observed in acoustics (Fig. 47a). They irradiated water with sound of high intensity and
measured the sound output of the liquid. The nonlinear elements in this system are cavitations,
i. e., bubbles ﬁlled with water vapor which are created by the pressure gradients of the initial
sound wave and whose wall oscillations are highly nonlinear.
Figure 47 shows a sequence of power spectra that is obtained experimentally (b) and from
a numerical calculation (c) (in which only a single spherical bubble was considered). With
increasing input pressure (which is the external control parameter), one observes a subhar-
monic route to chaos that, besides the sequence f0 →f0/2 →f0/4... →chaos, also contains
f0/3. Moreover, the system shows signs of reverse bifurcations where it returns from chaotic
behavior to a line spectrum.

5 The Intermittency Route to Chaos
By intermittency we mean the occurrence of a signal that alternates randomly between long
regular (laminar) phases (so-called intermissions) and relatively short irregular bursts. Such
signals have been detected in a large number of experiments. It has also been observed that the
number of chaotic bursts increases with an external parameter, which means that intermittency
offers a continuous route from regular to chaotic motion. In the ﬁrst section of this chapter,
we present mechanisms for this phenomenon proposed by Pomeau and Manneville (1979)
and discuss type-I intermittency which is generated by an inverse tangent bifurcation. It is
shown in the second section that the transition to chaos via intermittency has in fact universal
properties and represents one of the rare examples where the (linearized) renormalization-
group equations can be solved exactly. These results will be used in Section 5.3 to demonstrate
that intermittency provides a universal mechanism for 1/f-noise in nonlinear systems. In the
ﬁnal section, we summarize typical properties of the intermittency route and discuss some
experiments.
5.1
Mechanisms for Intermittency
The intermittency route to chaos has been investigated in a pioneering study by Pomeau and
Manneville (1979). They solved numerically the differential equations of the Lorenz model,
˙X
=
σ(X −Z)
(5.1a)
˙Y
=
−XZ +rX −Y
(5.1b)
˙Z
=
XY −bZ
(5.1c)
and for the Y-component they found the behavior shown in Fig. 48.
For r < rc, Y(t) executes a stable periodic motion. Above the threshold rc the oscillations
are interrupted by chaotic bursts, which become more frequent as r is increased until the
motion becomes truly chaotic.
Pomeau and Manneville gave the following interpretation for this behavior: The stable
oscillations for r < rc correspond to a stable ﬁxed point in the Poincar´e map (see also Fig. 6).
Above rc this ﬁxed point becomes unstable. Because there are essentially three ways in which
a ﬁxed point can lose its stability (in all of them the modulus of the eigenvalues of the lin-
earized Poincar´e map becomes larger than unity), Pomeau and Manneville distinguished the
three types of intermittency shown in Table 5. (See also Table 7, p. 85, for the form of the
signal.)

Type-I Intermittency
Figure 49 shows a Poincar´e map for the Lorenz model, after Pomeau and Manneville who
plotted the values yn where y(t) crossed the plane x = 0. If this ﬁgure is compared with
Table 5, it is seen that the Lorenz model displays intermittency of type I.
This transition to chaos is characterized by an inverse tangent bifurcation in which two
ﬁxed points (a stable and an unstable one) merge as depicted in Fig. 50.
For r > rc the map has no stable ﬁxed points. However, a sort of “memory” of a ﬁxed
point is displayed since the motion of the trajectory slows down in the vicinity of xc and
numerous iterations are required to move through the narrow channel between the map and
the bisector. This leads to the long laminar regions for values of r just above rc in Fig. 48.

The Intermittency Route to Chaos
Figure 51: Window with period three in the chaotic regime.
After the trajectory has left the channel, the motion becomes chaotic until reinjection into the
vicinity of xc starts a new regular phase. The theory of Pomeau and Manneville explains only
the laminar motion but gives no information about the mechanism which generates chaos.
Another example for type-I intermittency appears in the logistic map
xn+1 = f(xn) = rxn(1−xn) .
(5.2)
Numerically, it is found that for rc = 1+
√
8 this map exhibits a cycle of period three with
subsequent bifurcations, i. e., there is a window in the chaotic regime as shown schematically
in Fig. 51. The iterates for r-values larger and smaller than rc are shown in Fig. 52. There is a
regular cycle of period three slightly above rc; but below rc laminar regions occur interrupted
by chaos.

73
Figure 53: The threefold iterated map f 3r (x) for r = rc
An explanation of this peculiar behavior follows from Fig. 53, which shows the third
iterate of fr(x) at r = rc. There are three ﬁxed points that become unstable for r < rc and
lead to intermittency of type I. It should be noted that inverse tangent bifurcations provide
(in contrast to pitchfork bifurcations in which the number of ﬁxed points is doubled) the only
mechanism by which an uneven number of ﬁxed points can be generated in the logistic map.
5.1.2
Length of the Laminar Region
As the next step, we calculate the average length ⟨l⟩of a laminar region (as a function of the
distance ε = r −rc from the critical point) for the logistic map. It will become clear from
our derivation that the result for ⟨l⟩(ε) is not conﬁned to this special map but holds for any
Poincar´e map that leads to type-I intermittency.
Expanding f 3
r (x) around the points xc and rc that are determined by
d
dx f 3
rc(xc) = 1 ,
f 3
rc(xc) = xc
(5.3)
we obtain
f 3
r (x) = f 3
r [xc +(x−xc)] = xc +(x−xc)+ac(x−xc)2 +bc(r −rc)

(A similar equation holds for all three ﬁxed points of f 3
rc(x), but we choose the middle point
for convenience as the result is independent of the constants).
With y ≡(x−xc)/bc and ac ≡ac ·bc > 0 the recursion for the map
xn+1 = f 3
r (xn)
(5.6)
transforms via (5.4) in the vicinity of xc into
yn+1 = yn +ay2

ε = r −rc .
(5.7)

74

The Intermittency Route to Chaos
(A similar map is obtained if the Poincar´e map in Fig. 49 is expanded around the point of
tangency). The laminar regions are now deﬁned by the requirement that subsequent iterates
change only very little; i. e., their distance to xc should be smaller than a threshold value c:
|yn| < c ≪1 .
(5.8)
In this region we can therefore safely replace the difference equation (5.7) by the differential
equation,
dy
dl = ay2 +ε
(5.9)
(l counts the iterations in the laminar region) which after integration yields

To ﬁnd the average length ⟨l⟩of a laminar region, we assume that after having left the laminar
region at yout = c, the point becomes, after some irregular bursts, reinjected to |y| < c at yin,
with a probability function P(yin), which is symmetric about xc, i. e., P(yin) = P(−yin).

For c/

⟨l⟩∝ε−1/2 .
(5.12)
This characteristic variation was ﬁrst derived by Pomeau and Manneville (1980) and is valid
numerically for the logistic map as shown in Fig. 54.

5.2
Renormalization-Group Treatment of Intermittency
The intermittency phenomenon has also been investigated by the renormalization-group meth-
od using the doubling operator which we encountered previously for the Feigenbaum route.
The idea is as follows: One considers a generalization f(x) of the map (5.7) for ε = 0 to
arbitrary exponents z > 1 which for x →0 has the form
f(x →0) = x+u|x| .
(5.13)
Its second iterate f 2(x) shows (because of the linear term in x), after proper rescaling, the same
asymptotic behavior (see Fig. 55). This is reminiscent of Fig. 29 for the logistic map. It could,
therefore, be asked whether repeated application of the doubling operator T to a function of
type (5.13) could also lead to a ﬁxed point f ∗(x) of T:
T f ∗(x) = αf ∗
f ∗ x
α

= f ∗(x)
(5.14)
but with the boundary conditions (5.13), i. e., f ∗(0) = 0 and f ∗′(0) = 1 instead of f ∗(0) = 1
and f ∗′(0) = 0 for the Feigenbaum bifurcations.
It has been shown by Hu and Rudnick (1982) that together with the new boundary con-
dition (.5.13) the ﬁxed-point equation (5.14), which is characteristic for intermittency, can be
solved exactly.

76
5
The Intermittency Route to Chaos
Here, the trick is to write the recursion relation
x′ = f(x)
(5.15)
in implicit form
G(x′) = G(x)−a
(5.16)
i. e.,
x′(x) = G−1[G(x)−a] = f(x)
(5.17)
where a is a free parameter. The ﬁxed-point equation
αf ∗[f ∗(x)] = f ∗(αx)
(5.18)
then becomes
αx′′(x) = x′(αx)
(5.19)
or by operating on this with G:
G(αx′′) = G[x′(αx)] = G(αx)−a .
(5.20)
Next, eq. (5.16) is used to obtain
G(x′′) = G(x′)−a = G(x)−2a
(5.21)
i. e.,
1
2G(x′′) = 1
2G(x)−a .
(5.22)
Comparison of (5.20) and (5.22) indicates that to solve the ﬁxed-point equation, G must have
the property
1
2G∗(x) = G∗(αx) .
(5.23)
The simple choice G∗(x) = |x|−(z−1) with α = 2
1
(z−1) yields the desired result.
The ﬁxed-point function therefore becomes
f ∗(x) = G∗−1[G∗(x)−a] = [|x|−(z−1) −a]−1/(z−1)
(5.24)
which for a = (z−1)u fulﬁls boundary condition (5.13). This derivation shows that the ﬁxed-
point map for intermittency is mathematically related to a translation G(x′) = G(x)−a; how-
ever, a simple physical explanation for this connection is not clear.
It is of course enough to ﬁnd the ﬁxed-point function f ∗(x) but one wants to classify the
perturbations to f ∗according to their relevance (see, e. g., Table 4). We investigate, therefore,
how the doubling transformation T acts (to linear order in ε) on a function
fε(x) = f ∗(x)+εhλ(x)
for
ε ≪1 .
(5.25)
Using the deﬁnition (5.14) for T we ﬁnd:

5.2
Renormalization-Group Treatment of Intermittency
77
The last equation holds only if hλ(x) is an eigenfunction, with the eigenvalue λ, of the lin-
earized doubling operator Lf ∗:
L f ∗[hλ(x)] ≡α{f ∗′[f ∗(x)]hλ(x)+hλ[f ∗(x)]} = λhλ(αx)
(5.27)
by analog to eq. (4.49) for the Feigenbaum route.
We now show that the method used above (to ﬁnd the ﬁxed-point function f ∗) allows us
also to ﬁnd the spectrum of eigenvalues λ and the corresponding eigenfunctions hλ. First we
write fε(x) in implicit form using eq. (5.17):
fε(x) = f ∗(x)+εhλ(x) = x′ = G−1
ε [Gε(x)−a] .
(5.28)
If we expand
Gε(x) = G∗(x)+εHλ(x)
(5.29)
then hλ(x) can be expressed in terms of Hλ(x) (and vice versa) by comparing the factors linear
in ε on both sides of (5.28).
Next we consider the second iterate,
x′′(x) = fε[fε(x)]
(5.30)
and apply Gε to this. This yields
Gε(x′′) = Gε(x′)−a = Gε(x)−2a
(5.31)
or more explicitly:
G∗(x′′)+εHλ(x′′) = G∗(x)+εHλ(x)−2a .
(5.32)
Because G∗(x) has the form of a simple power of x we try a similar ansatz for Hλ(x):
Hλ(x) = |x|−ρ .
(5.33)
Using the property (5.23) of G∗(x), (5.32) then becomes
G∗(αx′′ +λεHλ(αx′′) = G∗(αx)+λεHλ(αx)−a
(5.34)
or
Gλε(αx′′) = Gλε(αx)−a
(5.35)
→αx′′ = G−1
λε [Gλε(αx)−a]
(5.36)
where
λ = 2
p+1−z
z−1
.
(5.37)
With (5.28) this translates into
αfε[fε(x)] = fλε(αx) = f ∗(αx)+λεhλ(αx) .
(5.38)
By comparing this result with eq. (5.26) we see that λ is indeed the eigenvalue of hλ, which is
determined by
f ∗(αx)+λεhλ(αx) = G−1
λε [Gλε(αx)−a] .

eqs. (5.37) and (5.40) represent the main results of this section. They provide the information
as to how T acts (to linear order in the deviation f −f ∗) on a function f that obeys the boundary
condition (5.13), because we obtain by expanding f(x)−f ∗(x) into hλ(x):
Tn f(x)
=
Tn(f ∗(x)+ f(x)−f ∗(x))
(5.41)
=
Tn(f ∗(x)+∑
λ
cλhλ(x)) = f ∗(x)+∑
λ
λncλhλ(x)
The intermittency route therefore represents – in contrast to the Feigenbaum route – one of the
rare examples where the linearized renormalization-group equations can be solved exactly.
As an application, we now calculate the dependence of the duration ⟨l⟩of a laminar region
on the shift ε of the map from tangency shown in Fig. 56.
The eigenfunction hλ in eq. (5.40) has been normalized, so that its lowest order term in x
is |x|2z−1−p. We therefore see that a constant shift ε from tangency corresponds to a relevant
perturbation with p = 2z−1. The eigenvalue λε, that corresponds to this is
λε = 2
z
z−1
(5.42)
With this information we can determine ⟨l⟩(ε) by a simple scaling procedure.
Because ⟨l⟩is related to the number of iterates of x0, and f 2(x) = f[f(x)] only requires
half as many steps as f(x), we arrive at the scaling relation
⟨l⟩[Tf(x0)] = 1
2⟨l⟩[f(x0)] .
(5.43)
Using (5.26) this becomes after many iterations
⟨l⟩[f(x0)] = 2n⟨l⟩[Tn f(x0)] = f ∗(x0)+ελn
εhλ(x0)
from which for ελn
ε = 1 we obtain with (5.42):
⟨l⟩∝ε−v
with
v = z−1
z
.
(5.44)

5.3
Intermittency and 1/f-Noise
79
For z = 2 this agrees with our previous result (5.12). One can show with the same method that
a perturbation which is linear in x, i. e.,
f(x) = f ∗(x)+εx
(5.45)
leads to
⟨l⟩∝ε−1
(5.46)
and perturbations εxm with m > z are irrelevant.
Finally, we mention that the effect of external noise with amplitude σ on intermittency has
been treated by Hirsch, Nauenberg, and Scalapino (1982) with the net result that ⟨l⟩scales
like
⟨l⟩= ε−vg(σµε)
with
µ = z−1
z+1
(5.47)
where g is a universal function.
5.3
Intermittency and 1/f-Noise
It has been observed experimentally that the power spectra Sf of a large variety of physical
systems (see Table 6) diverge at low frequencies with a power law 1/f δ(0.8 < δ < 1.4). This
phenomenon is called 1/f-noise. Despite considerable theoretical efforts, a general theory
encompassing 1/f δ-divergencies in several experiments is still lacking.
In the following, we show that a class of maps which generates intermittent signals also
displays 1/f δ-noise, and we link the exponent δ to the universal properties of the map using the
renormalization-group approach. Although the intermittency mechanism for 1/f-noise is – as
we shall demonstrate below – well veriﬁed numerically for maps, it still remains unresolved,
whether it also provides an explanation for the experiments shown in Table 6. (We do not
think that the intermittency mechanism which is very sensitive to external perturbations could
explain the robust 1/f-noise found in resistors, cf. Fig. 57. But there is a good chance to ﬁnd
this mechanism in chemical reactions and in the B´enard convection; see Manneville (1980),
and Dubois et al. (1983).)

The Intermittency Route to Chaos
Figure 57: Example for 1/f-noise in the current of a bipolar transistor (after D. Wolf, 1978).
Figure 58: The map f(x) has the limiting behavior f(x →0) = x+uxz and is arbitrary beyond x = c with
the only requirement that this part of the map produces random reinjection into the region 0 ≤x0 ≤c
with a probability ˆP(x0).
We want to calculate the power spectrum S f for the map
Xn+1 = f(xn)
(5.48)
in Fig. 58 where xn ≥0. In other words, we only use that part of the map where the “ghost
of the ﬁxed point” is repulsive (compare Figs. 50 and 65). Therefore our mechanism for 1/f-
noise only works for type-III (and type-II) intermittency (Ben-Mizrachi et al., 1985). It is
useful to express S f via the correlation function C(m):

(This result follows by Fourier transformation from the deﬁnitions in eqs. (5.49) and (5.50).)
To evaluate C(m), we idealize the signal as shown in Fig. 59b, i. e., we assume that xn is
practically zero in the laminar regions and replace the short burst regions by lines of height
one. C(m) then becomes proportional to the conditional probability of ﬁnding a signal at time
m, given that there occurred a signal at time zero.
Next, we express C(m) in terms of the probability P(l) of ﬁnding an intermission of length
l, which we shall calculate below in a universal way. Figure 60 shows that

We now use eq. (5.24) to calculate the probability P(l) of ﬁnding a laminar region of
length l for (5.48).

(5.54)
and since it follows from Fig. 58 that
f l(x0) = c →x0 = x0(l)
(5.55)
x0(l) can be calculated by using the doubling operator. In the absence of relevant perturbations
(which will be discussed later), we have
Tn f(x0) = αn f 2n(x0/αn) ≈f ∗(x0) ,
for
n ≫1
(5.56)
i. e., the function is driven to the ﬁxed point. This yields
f 2n(x0) = α−n f ∗(αnx0) .

Here both α = 2

z−1 and f ∗(x) = |x|[1−(z−1)u|x|z−1]−1

the universality class. If we use (5.57) in (5.55), we obtain for l = 2n):
x0(l) ∝l

(5.58)
and with (5.54) this yields the desired universal result for P(l),

Here we assumed that ˆP(x0) varies only slowly with x0, i. e., ˆP(x0) ∝l−1

l ≫1.
We pass on to continuous time variables since we are only interested in the long-time limit,
and solve (5.52) by Laplace transformation using the convolution theorem. This yields

Let us now brieﬂy discuss the effect of perturbations. The low frequency divergence of the
power spectrum arises because arbitrarily long laminar regions [P(l) ∝l−z/(z−1)] occur with
ﬁnite probability in the (unperturbed) map in Fig. 58. But we also showed in Section 5.2 that
in the presence of relevant perturbations (as, e. g., a shift ε from tangency) the average duration
of an intermission becomes ﬁnite:
⟨l⟩∼ε−v .
(5.65)
This yields a cutoff
fc ∼⟨l⟩−1 ∼εv

Experimental Observation of the Intermittency Route
Table 7 summarizes some measurable characteristic properties of the intermittency route to
chaos. The different types of intermittency can be distinguished by the form of the signal
and by the distribution P(l) of the laminar lengths. Below we present a derivation of P(l)
and describe two representative experiments in which type-I intermittency has been detected.
Type-II intermittency has (to the best of our knowledge) not yet been found in a real exper-
iment. This section closes with brief report on the ﬁrst experimental observation of type-III
intermittency.
5.4.1
Distribution of Laminar Lengths

Type-I Intermittency
Figure 63 shows the vertical velocity as a function of time for a B´enard experiment. The signal
shows a behavior which is typical for type-I intermittency.
The nonlinear RCL-oscillator described on page 66 also displays the intermittency route.
Type-I intermittency is indicated in Fig. 64 by the Poincar´e map, the scaling behavior of the
lengths of the laminar regions, and the maximum in P(l) for l > 0.
5.4.3
Type-III Intermittency
Type-III intermittency has ﬁrst been observed by M. Dubois, M. A. Rubio and P. Berge (1983)
in B´enard convection in a small rectangular cell. They measured the local horizontal temper-
ature gradient via the modulation of a light beam that was sent through the cell.
Figure 65 (on p. 88) shows the time dependence of the light intensity that is characteristic
for type-III intermittency. The intermittency appears simultaneously with a period-doubling
bifurcation. One observes the growth of a subharmonic amplitude together with a decrease in
the fundamental amplitude. When the subharmonic amplitude reaches a high value, the signal
loses its regularity, and turbulent bursts appear.

By plotting subsequent maxima In of both the subharmonic mode (even n, crosses) and the
fundamental mode (odd n, squares), the Poincar´e map shown in Fig. 65b is obtained. Its form
can be described by

where b is a constant and ε ∝(R−Rc) measures the distance to the critical Rayleigh number

6 Strange Attractors in Dissipative Dynamical Systems
In the ﬁrst part of this chapter we show that nonlinear dissipative dynamical systems lead
naturally to the concept of a strange attractor. In Section 6.2, the Kolmogorov entropy is in-
troduced as the fundamental measure for chaotic motion. Section 6.3 deals with the problem
of how much information about a strange attractor can be obtained from a measured random
signal. We discuss the reconstruction of the trajectory in phase space from the measured time
series of a single variable and introduce generalized dimensions and entropies. It is demon-
strated how these quantities can be obtained from a measurement and how one can extract
from them the distribution of singularities in the invariant measure that characterizes the static
structure of a strange attractor and the ﬂuctuation spectrum of the Kolmogorov entropy, which
describes the dynamical evolution of the trajectory on the attractor. Finally we present, in the
last section, a collection of pictures of strange attractors and fractal boundaries.
6.1
Introduction and Deﬁnition of Strange Attractors
In this section, we consider dissipative systems that can be described either by ﬂows or maps.
Let us begin with dissipative ﬂows.
These are described by a set of autonomous ﬁrst-order
differential equations,
˙⃗x = ⃗F(⃗x),
⃗x = (x1, x2, ... xd)
(6.1)
and the term dissipative means that an arbitrary volume element V enclosed by some surface
S in phase space {⃗x} contracts. The surface S evolves by having each point on it follow an
orbit generated by (6.1). This yields, by the divergence theorem,

and dissipative systems are deﬁned by dV/dt < 0.

i. e., the volume element contracts exponentially in time:
V(t) = V(0) e−(σ+1+b)t
(6.5)
If, on the other hand, the trajectory generated by the equations of the Lorenz model for r = 28,
σ = 10, b = 8/3 is considered (see Fig. 66), one ﬁnds that it is: a) attracted to a bounded
region in phase space; b) the motion is erratic, i. e., the trajectory makes one loop to the right,
then a few loops to the left, then to the right, etc.; and c) there is a sensitive dependence
of the trajectory on the initial conditions, i. e., if instead of (0, 0.01, 0) an adjacent initial
condition is taken, the new solution soon deviates from the old, and the number of loops is
different. Figure 67 shows a plot of the nth maximum Mn of Z versus Mn+1. The resulting
map is approximately triangular, which corresponds, according to the material discussed in
Chapter 3, to a chaotic sequence of Mns.

Introduction and Deﬁnition of Strange Attractors

Figure 68: Self-trapping of a ﬂow line in a bounded region of the plane. Exponential separation of
points is at variance with continuity (note the opposing arrows).
Summarizing: The trajectory depends sensitively on the initial conditions; it is chaotic;
it is attracted to a bounded region in phase space; and [according to eq. (6.4)] the volume
of this region contracts to zero. This means that the ﬂow of the three-dimensional Lorenz
system generates a set of points whose dimension is less than three; i. e., its volume in three-
dimensional space is zero. At ﬁrst sight, one might think of the next lower integer dimension,
two. However, this is forbidden by the Poincar´e—Bendixson theorem which states that there
is no chaotic ﬂow in a bounded region in two-dimensional space. We refer, e. g., to the mono-
graph by Hirsch and Smale (1965) for a rigorous proof of this theorem. However, Fig. 68
makes it plausible that both the continuity of the ﬂow lines and the fact that a line divides a
plane into two parts restrict the trajectories in two dimensions so strongly that the only possi-
ble attractors for a bounded region are limit cycles or ﬁxed points. The solution to this problem
is that the set of points to which the trajectory in the Lorenz system is attracted, the so-called
Lorenz attractor, has a Hausdorff dimension which is noninteger and lies between two and
three (the precise value is D = 2.06). This leads, in a natural way, to the concept of a strange
attractor which appears in a large variety of physical, nonlinear systems.
A strange attractor has the following properties (a more formal deﬁnition can be found in
the review articles by Eckmann and Ruelle, 1985):
a) It is an attractor, i. e., a bounded region of phase space {⃗x} to which all sufﬁciently
close trajectories from the so-called basin of attraction are attracted asymptotically for
long enough times. We note that the basin of attraction can have a very complicated
structure (see the pictures in Section 6.4). Furthermore, the attractor itself should be
indecomposable, i. e., the trajectory should visit every point on the attractor in the course
of time. A collection of isolated ﬁxed points is no single attractor.
b) The property which makes the attractor strange is the sensitive dependence on the initial
conditions, i. e., despite the contraction in volume, lengths need not shrink in all direc-
tions, and points, which are arbitrarily close initially, become exponentially separated at
the attractor for sufﬁciently long times. This leads to a positive Kolmogorov entropy, as
we shall see in the next section.
All strange attractors that have been found up to now in dissipative systems have fractal
Hausdorff dimensions. Since there exists no generally accepted formal deﬁnition of a strange
attractor (Ruelle, 1980; Mandelbrot, 1982), it is not yet clear whether a fractal Hausdorff di-
mension follows already from a)–b) or should be additionally required for a strange attractor.
A strange attractor arises typically when the ﬂow contracts the volume element in some direc-
tions, but stretches it along the others. To remain conﬁned to a bounded domain, the volume

Strange Attractors in Dissipative Dynamical Systems

element is folded at the same time. By analogy to the broken linear maps in Chapter 3, this
stretching and backfolding process produces a chaotic motion of the trajectory at the strange
attractor (see also Fig. 69).
Because the deﬁnition given above describes the properties of a set of points, the concept
of a strange attractor is not conﬁned to ﬂows, and dissipative maps can also generate strange
attractors. A map
⃗x(n+1) = ⃗G[⃗x(n)];
⃗x1(n) = [x1(n), ... xd(n)]
(6.6a)
is called dissipative if it leads to a contraction of volume in phase space, i. e., if the absolute
value of its Jacobian J, by which a volume element is multiplied after each iteration, is smaller
than unity:
|J| =
det
∂Gi
∂xj
 < 1 .
(6.6b)
The Poincar´e—Bendixson theorem that restricts the dimension of strange attractors gener-
ated by ﬂows to values larger than two does not hold for maps. This is because maps generate
discrete points and the restrictions imposed by the continuity of the ﬂow are lifted. Dissipative
maps can therefore lead to strange attractors that also have dimensions smaller than two. Let
us consider two illustrative examples which, because of their lower dimensionality, are easier
to visualize than the Lorenz attractor.
6.1.1
Baker’s Transformation
Figure 70 shows the usual baker’s transformation, which is an area-preserving map (reminis-
cent of a baker kneading dough), and the non-area preserving, dissipative baker’s transforma-
tion. The mathematical expression for the latter is

Figure 70: a) Baker’s transformation; b) dissipative baker’s transformation.
The ﬁrst equation (6.7a) is our old friend from Chapter 3: the transformation σ which leads
to the Bernoulli shift. It has a Liapunov exponent (in the x-direction), λx = log2 > 0, which
leads to the sensitive dependence on the initial conditions, and makes the object resulting
from repeated applications of this map to the unit square, a strange attractor. The attractor is
an inﬁnite sequence of horizontal lines, and its basin of attraction consists of all points within
the unit square. The Liapunov exponent in the y-direction is λy = loga < 0, and lengths are
contracted in this direction such that the net result (of stretching in the x- and shrinking in the
y-direction) is a volume contraction, as required for a dissipative map.
The Hausdorff dimension DB of this strange attractor can be calculated as follows: In
the x-direction the attractor is simply one-dimensional (as the map σ(x) of Chapter 3). The
Hausdorff dimension in the y-direction follows from its deﬁnition
lim
l→0N(l) ∝l−Dy
(6.8)
and from the self-similarity of the attractor in the vertical direction, shown in Fig. 70b. This

(After Farmer, 1982a, b.)
Let us now examine its iterates for, e. g., b = 0.3, a = 1.4. Figure 72 a shows the result of an
iteration with 104 steps, and we have indicated the dynamics by enumerating some successive
points on the attractor that looks like a very tangled curve. Figures 72b–c show details of
the regions inside the box of the previous ﬁgure and reveal the self-similar structure of the
attractor. The Hausdorff dimension of the H´enon attractor is: D(a = 1.4,b = 0.3) = 1.26. This
result was obtained by placing a square net of width l over the diagram, counting the number
N(l) of squares occupied by points, and forming D = −liml→0 logN(l)/logl. If Fig. 72c is
resolved into six “leaves”, then the relative probability of each leaf can be estimated by simply
counting its number of points. The height of each bar in Fig. 72d is the relative probability,
and the width is the thickness of the corresponding leaf.
The different heights of the bars in Fig. 72d show that the H´enon attractor is inhomoge-
neous. This inhomogeneity cannot be described by the Hausdorff dimension alone and in the
following we shall therefore introduce an inﬁnite set of dimensions which characterize the
static structure (i. e., the distribution of points) of the attractor. However, before this step, it is
useful to discuss the Kolmogorov entropy that describes the dynamical behavior at the strange
attractor.

6.2
The Kolmogorov Entropy
The Kolmogorov entropy (Kolmogorov, 1959) is the most important measure by which chaotic
motion in (an arbitrary-dimensional) phase space can be characterized.
Before we introduce this quantity, it is useful to recall that the thermodynamic entropy S
measures the disorder in a given system. A simple example, for a system where S increases, is
that of gas molecules that are initially conﬁned to one half of a box, but are then suddenly al-
lowed to ﬁll the whole container. The disorder in this system increases because the molecules
are no longer separated from the other half of the box. This increase in disorder is coupled
with an increase in our ignorance about the state of the system (before the conﬁnement was
lifted, we knew more about the positions of the molecules).
More precisely, the entropy S, which can be expressed as
S ∝∑
i
Pi logPi
(6.13)
where {[Pi} are the probabilities of ﬁnding the system in states {i}, measures, according to
Shannon et al. (1949) (see Appendix F), the information needed to locate the system in a
certain state i∗, i. e., S is a measure of our ignorance about the system.
This example from statistical mechanics shows that disorder is essentially a concept from
information theory. It is therefore not too surprising that the Kolmogorov entropy K which
measures “how chaotic a dynamical system is”, can also be deﬁned by Shannon’s formula in
such a way that K becomes proportional to the rate at which information about the state of the
dynamical system is lost in the course of time.
6.2.1
Deﬁnition of K
K can be calculated as follows (Farmer, 1982a, b): Consider the trajectory ⃗x(t) = [x1(t),
...xd(t)] of a dynamical system on a strange attractor and suppose that the d-dimensional
phase space is partitioned into boxes of size ld. The state of the system is now measured at
intervals of time τ. Let Pi0...in be the joint probability that⃗x(t = 0) is in box i0,⃗x(r = τ) that it
is in box i1, ..., and⃗x(t +nτ) that it is in box in. According to Shannon, the quantity
Kn = −∑
i0 ...in
Pi0 ...in logPi0 ...in
(6.14)
is proportional to the information needed to locate the system on a special trajectory i∗
0, ...i∗
n
with precision l (if one knows a priori only the probabilities Pi0...in ). Therefore, Kn+1 −Kn is
the additional information needed to predict in which cell i∗
n+1 the system will be if we know
that it was previously in i∗
0 ...i∗
n. This means, that Kn+1 −Kn; measures our loss of information
about the system from time n to time n+1.
The K-entropy is deﬁned as the average rate of loss of information:

Random motion
Initially adjacent points are distributed with equal
probability over all newly allowed intervals
Pi0 = l, Pi0i1 ∝l2
K ∝−logl →∞
Here we assumed for simplicity that a) Pi0i1 factorizes into Pi0 ·(1/N) where N is the number
of possible new intervals which evolve from i0 and b) Kn+1 −Kn = K1 −K0 for all n.
The limit l →0 (which has to be taken after N →∞) makes K independent of the particular
partition. For maps with discrete time steps τ = 1, the limit τ →0 is omitted. Table 8 shows
that K is indeed a useful measure of chaos. K becomes zero for regular motion, it is inﬁnite in
random systems, but it is a constant larger than zero if the system displays deterministic chaos.
6.2.2
Connection of K to the Liapunov Exponents
For one-dimensional maps, K is just the positive Liapunov exponent [see Table 8 and eq.
(3.11)]. In higher dimensional systems, we loose information about the system because the
cell in which it was previously located spreads over new cells in phase space at a rate which is

to this exponent, no new cells are covered after one time step.
determined by the positive Liapunov exponents (see Fig. 73). It is therefore plausible that the
rate K at which information about the system is lost is equal to the (averaged) sum of positive
Liapunov exponents (Pesin, 1977):
K =

(6.16)
Here ρ(⃗x) is the invariant density of the attractor. In most cases, the λs are independent of⃗x;
the integral then becomes unity, and K reduces to a simple sum.

Note that the eigenvalues {λi} of the Jacobian matrix are invariant under coordinate trans-
formations in phase space, i. e., from (6.16), K is also invariant, as one would expect for such
an important physical quantity.

Figure 74: Exponential separation of nearby trajectories in phase space (schematically).
Let us brieﬂy comment on the computation of Liapunov exponents for ﬂows. First, there
is a difference in the calculation of Liapunov exponents for maps λM and ﬂows (λF) which
can be explained by the following trivial example.
The Liapunov exponent λM of the map
xn+1 = axn →xn = enlogax0
(6.20)
is obviously λM = loga. Whereas one obtains for the ﬂow
˙x = ax →x(t) = eat x(0) ,
(6.21)
the result that nearby trajectories separate with rate a, i. e., the Liapunov exponent λF is simply
λF = a. (Both examples show no chaos, of course, because backfolding is missing).
For general ﬂows described by an autonomous differential equation
˙⃗x = ⃗f(⃗x) ,
(6.22)
the difference⃗ε(t) of inﬁnitesimal neighbored trajectories (see Fig. 74) develops according to
˙⃗ε = M(t)⃗ε
(6.23)
where
Mij(t) = ∂fi
∂x j
{⃗x[t,⃗x(0)]}
(6.24)
is the Jacobian matrix taken at the point⃗x(t). Therefore, in order to integrate eq. (6.23) one has
to integrate eq. (6.22) ﬁrst to know ⃗x[t,⃗x(0)]. However, eq. (6.23) can be integrated formally
yielding
⃗ε(t) =

⃗ε(0) ≡L(t)⃗ε(0)
(6.25)
where the time ordering operator ˆT has to be introduced because the matrices M(t) and M(t′)
usually do not commute at different times t and t′. The Liapunov exponents λ1 ...λd of the
ﬂow are, in analogy to eq. (6.18), deﬁned as
(eλ1, eλ2, ... eλd) = lim
t→∞(magnitude of the eigenvalues of L(t))1/t .
(6.26)
The Liapunov exponents in eq. (6.26) generally depend on the choice of the initial point⃗x(0).
Even if ⃗x(t) moves on a strange attractor, a change in ⃗x(0) could place the system into the
basin of attraction of another attractor with a different set of λi’s (see, e. g., Fig. 69).

We will not discuss all numerical methods which have been developed in order to extract
the Liapunov exponents from eqs. (6.22–6.24) (see the References of this section for some ex-
amples), but only explain the simplest method which yields the largest Liapunov exponent λm.

Here, ψj denotes the phase angle of the jth eigenvalue of L(t), which can be complex, and
eλmt dominates the sum in eq. (6.29) because the remaining terms decay as exp[−|λm −λj|t].
In order to obtain λm, one could therefore start with any randomly chosen value for ⃗ε(0),
calculate⃗ε(t) by numerical integration of eqs. (6.22–6.24), and extract λm via eq. (6.29). To
avoid overﬂow in the computer, this is usually done in steps as shown in Fig. 75.
Plate XVII, at the beginning of this book, and Fig. 76 display the parameter dependence of
λm for the driven pendulum with an additional torque and for the Lorenz model, respectively.
In both cases, one observes a sensitive dependence of order λm < 0 and chaos λm > 0 on the
parameter values.
6.2.3
Average Time over which the State of a Chaotic System can be
Predicted
The K-entropy also determines the average time over which the state of a system, displaying
deterministic chaos, can be predicted. Consider, e. g., the simple one-dimensional triangular
map in Fig. 15b, which is conﬁned to the unit square. After n time steps, an interval l increases

to L = l eλn. If L becomes larger than 1, we can no longer locate the trajectory in [0, 1], and
all we can say is that the system has a probability
ρ0(x) dx
(6.30)
of being in an interval [x, x+ dx] ∈[0, 1], where ρ0(x) is the invariant density of the system.
In other words, precise predictions about the state of this system are only possible for times n
that are smaller than Tm:

(6.31)
Above Tm one can only make statistical predictions. Equation (6.31) can be generalized to
higher dimensional dynamical systems by replacing λ by the K-entropy (Farmer, 1982a):
Tm ∝1
K log
1
l

.
(6.32)
Note that the precision l, with which the initial state is located, only inﬂuences Tm logarithmi-
cally. Let us summarize our results about the K-entropy:
– It measures the average rate at which information about the state of a dynamical system
is lost with time.
– For one-dimensional maps, it is equal to the Liapunov exponent. In higher dimensional
systems, K measures the average deformation of a cell in phase space and becomes equal
to the integral over phase space of the sum of the positive Liapunov exponents.
– It is inversely proportional to the time interval over which the state of a chaotic system
can be predicted.
Furthermore, in the next section, we shall show that K can be directly obtained by measur-
ing the time dependence of one component of a chaotic system. These results show that the
K-entropy is the fundamental quantity by which chaotic motion can be characterized, and we
deﬁne a strange attractor as an attractor with a positive K-entropy.

6.3
Characterization of the Attractor by a Measured Signal
Having experimentally observed a seemingly chaotic signal, one wants to know what infor-
mation it contains about the strange attractor. To provide an answer, we proceed in several
steps.
First, we will explain the result of Takens (1981) who has shown that, after the transients
have died out, one can reconstruct the trajectory on the attractor (the whole time dependent
vector⃗x(t) = [x1(t), x2(t) ...] in phase space) from the measurement of a single component,
say x1(t). A knowledge of the time series of one variable is therefore sufﬁcient to reconstruct
the statical and dynamical properties of the strange attractor.
Since the whole trajectory contains too much information, we then follow a series of pa-
pers by Grassberger, Hentschel and Procaccia (1983), Halsey et al. (1986), Eckmann and
Procaccia (1986) and introduce a set of averaged coordinate invariant numbers (generalized
dimensions, entropies, and scaling indices) by which different strange attractors can be distin-
guished. For this purpose, we divide the attractor into boxes of linear dimension l, and denote
by pi the probability that the trajectory on the strange attractor visits box i. By averaging
powers of the pi’s over all boxes, we obtain the generalized dimensions Dq, deﬁned by
Dq = −lim

(6.34)
where Ei are the energy levels of the system, N is its particle number, and β is the inverse
temperature. Since ∑i pq
i , which appears in eq. (6.33), is for q > 1 the total probability that
q points of the attractor are within one box, it is obvious that the Dq measure correlations
between different points on the attractor and are therefore useful in characterizing its inhomo-
geneous static structure.
But, it will be shown below that the (negative) Legendre transform f(α) of the Dq (more
precisely of (q−1)Dq):
f(α)
=
−(q−1)Dq +qα
(6.35a)
α
=
∂
∂q[(q−1)Dq]
(6.35b)
is more appropriate to describe universal properties of strange point sets.
Let us brieﬂy explain the meaning of f(α) (its connection to the Dq’ s will be shown
below). Assuming ergodicity, the probabilities pi are, by construction, related to the invariant
density ρ(⃗x) of the attractor:
pi =

the invariant density has, according to eq. (6.36), at ⃗xi a singularity whose strength is char-
acterized by αi. Since different points ⃗xi on the attractor can have different strengths αi, it
is useful to introduce a function f(α) which measures the Hausdorff dimension of the set of
points {⃗xi} on the attractor which have the same strength of singularity α. f(α) characterizes
the static distribution of points on the attractor and can therefore also be used for point sets
which are not generated dynamically (see Fig. 77).
In order to describe the dynamical behavior of the trajectory on the attractor, we use the
quantities Pi0...in which we have introduced already to deﬁne the K-entropy via eq. (6.14). The
Pi0...in measure the probability that the trajectory visits a certain sequence i0 ...in of boxes of
size l in time n. By playing with these variables the same game as with the Pi, we introduce
generalized entropies K, via:

and show that their Legendre transform g(λ) is connected to the ﬂuctuations of the K-entropy
around its mean value K, given by eq. (6.15).
It will also be demonstrated that both quantities, the Dqs and the Kqs (and therefore f(α)
and g(λ)) can be extracted from a time series of a single variable. Two further important
quantities, which can be obtained in this way, are the embedding dimension of the attractor,
that is, the dimension of the space with the lowest integer dimension, which contains the
attractor, and the amplitude of white noise on the signal. Thus irregularities originating from
deterministic motion on the attractor can be separated from disturbing white noise.
6.3.1
Reconstruction of the Attractor from a Time Series
It is not always possible to measure all components of the vector ⃗x(n) simultaneously. This
clearly holds for an inﬁnite-dimensional system. If we deﬁne the dimension of a system by the
number of initial conditions, then the so-called Mackey–Glass equation (Mackey and Glass,
1977)
˙x =
ax(t −τ)
1+{x(t −τ)}10 −bx(t)
(6.39)
(which describes the regeneration of blood cells) obviously provides a simple example of an
inﬁnite-dimensional system, because all the x(t)-values in the interval t,t −τ have to be known

104

Strange Attractors in Dissipative Dynamical Systems
(as initial conditions) to solve it. How do we proceed in this, or the less difﬁcult case, where
we have an attractor embedded in d-dimensional space, but measure only one component of
the signal?
It has been shown by Takens (1981) that one can reconstruct certain properties of the
attractor in phase space from the time series of a single component. Instead of the rather
cumbersome proof, we present the following simpliﬁed argument. As an example, consider a
two-dimensional ﬂow generated by
d
dt⃗x = ⃗F(⃗x)
⃗x = {x, y}
(6.40)
Every point {x(t + τ),y(t + τ)} then originates uniquely from a point {x(t),y(t)}, and the
relation between both points is one-to-one because the trajectories do not cross (otherwise the
trajectory would not be determined uniquely by the initial conditions). Next, we construct a
sequence of vectors
⃗ξ(t) = {x(t), x(t +τ)}
(6.41)
⃗ξ(t +τ) = {x(t +τ), x(t +2τ)] .
Since the components of⃗ξ are related to {x(t),y(t)} via the one-to-one relationships
ξ1(t)
=
x(t)
(6.42a)
ξ2(t)
=
x(t +τ) =
t+τ
Z
t
dt′ F1{x(t′), y(t′)}+x(t)
∼=
τF1{x(t), y(t)}+x(t)
(6.42b)
with a Jacobian |τ(∂F1/∂y)| ̸= 0, it is plausible that the information contained in the time
sequences ⃗x(ti) and⃗ξ(ti))(ti = iπ) is the same, and both sequences should lead to the same
characteristic dimensions. A simple example for which ⃗x(ti) and⃗ξ(ti) are indeed completely
equivalent is a circle:

(6.43)
But we should be aware that arguments are only heuristic and can only be applied “cum grano
salis” to situations where strange attractors appear. What Takens (1981) actually proved is the
following: “If ˙⃗x = ⃗F(⃗x) generates a d-dimensional ﬂow, then eq. (6.44),
⃗ξ(t) = {xj(t), xj(t +τ), ..., x j[t +(D−1)τ]}
(6.44)
where x j(t) is an arbitrary component of ⃗x, provides a smooth embedding for this ﬂow, if
D = 2d +1. The metric properties in both spaces (the d-dimensional {⃗x(t)} and the (2d +1)-
dimensional {⃗ξ(t)}) are the same in the sense that distances in {⃗x(t)} and {⃗ξ(t)} have a ratio
which is uniformly bounded and bounded away from zero”.
The relation between the dimension of the original ﬂow, d, and the embedding dimension
D may be understood in terms of a simple topological argument. Consider, e. g., a closed orbit

in the original phase space, i. e., a limit cycle in the ⃗x-space (cf. Fig. 78). Clearly, its dimen-
son is d = 1. Equation (6.44) yields a transformation to new coordinates. If one considers
one-dimensional embeddings, D = 1, then the new coordinate is a scalar and the limit cycle is
mapped onto a line. Of course this mapping is not invertible since self intersections occur in
the⃗ξ-space. If we choose D = 2 then still self intersections may appear and these intersection
points are structurally stable, i. e., one cannot remove the intersection by a small perturbation.
If we take a three-dimensional embedding, D = 3 = 2d + 1, then the image curve in⃗ξ-space
is typically free of any self intersection, so that eq. (6.44) yields the desired invertible trans-
formation. A similar argument may be applied to objects of higher dimension, e. g., invariant
manifolds and even to fractal attractors.

from about 6 × 105 points for different choices of the delay time τ. Although for an inﬁnite
amount of noise-free data, τ could be chosen almost arbitrary (Takens, 1981), it can be seen
from Fig. 79 that for a ﬁnite time series the quality of the reconstruction depends on τ. If
τ is too small, x(t) and x(t + τ) become practically indistinguishable and one obtains a lin-
ear dependence that is not present for the coordinates of the real trajectory. It is, therefore,
reasonable to choose the decay time of the autocorrelation function C(t) of the signal xn for

Generalized Dimensions and Distribution of Singularities in the
Invariant Density
In this section, we discuss the meaning of the generalized dimensions Dq for special values
of q and demonstrate explicitly the connection of Dq to the distribution f(α) of singularities
in the invariant density of a strange attractor. Proceeding in a similar way as in Section 6.2,
we chop the trajectory⃗x(t) = [x1(t)...xd(t)] of a dynamical system on a strange attractor into
a sequence of points ⃗x(t = 0), ⃗x(t = τ) ...x(t = Nτ) and partition the d-dimensional phase
space into cells ld. The probability pi of ﬁnding a point of the attractor in cell number i
(i = 1, 2, ...M(l)) is then given by

For a homogeneous attractor where all pi are the same, i. e., pi = 1/M(l), we have
S(l) = −

M(l) = logM(l) .
(6.52)
Furthermore, the information dimension is always less or equal to the Hausdorff dimension,
that is,
D1 ≤D0 .
(6.53)
This can be proven by maximizing S(l) under the constraint ∑i pi = 1:

from which eq. (6.53) follows after division by logl.
The inequality (6.53) has been generalized to (Hentschel and Procaccia, 1983):
Dq′ ≤Dq
for
q′ > q
(6.57)
where the equality sign holds if the attractor is uniform.
In order to explain the connection between the Dqs and the singularities in the invariant
density of an attractor, we calculate Dq for a one-dimensional system which has a power law
singularity in its invariant density ρ(x) at x = 0, i. e.,
ρ(x) = 1
2x−1/2
for
x ∈[0, 1] .
(6.58)
This is just the behavior of ρ(x) near x = 0 for the logistic map at r = 4 [see eq. (4.104)] where
we ignored the singularity at x = 1 to simplify our argument. (The Dqs will be the same for
both systems).

The interpretation of eqs. (6.59–6.63) is as follows. Associated with different singularities for
the density of states ρ(x) (e. g., ρ(x →0) ∼x−1/2, ρ(x) ∼const. otherwise) which gives rise to
different singularities for pi(l) ∼lαi in eq. (6.59), are different exponents f(α) which measure
the fractal dimension of the density of these singularities on the attractor. The singularity with
exponent α = 1/2 occurs just at one point, that is, f(α = 1/2) = 0, whereas α = 1 occurs in a
whole one-dimensional interval, that is f(α = 1) = 1. This concept of a distribution f(α) of

6.3

fractal dimensions which are associated with a whole set of singularities of strength a can be
generalized to strange attractors, and it turns out that the functions f(α) are again universal, for
example, for the Feigenbaum attractor or the attractor, which is associated with the transition
from quasiperiodicity to chaos. This type of universality, which is again associated with a
whole set of singularities and not just a single exponent, is also called global universality. (It
should be noted that the term global universality is also used if a whole range of parameter
values has universal properties as will be explained in Chapter 7).
By way of generalizing our example, we now make the scaling hypothesis that
pi(l) ∼lαi
(6.64)
(where i denotes the box i of linear dimension l) occurs in ∑i pq
i with a density
ρ(α)l−f(α) dα
(6.65)
such that the sum can be estimated as:
Zq ≡∑
i
pq
i ∼=
Z
dαρ(α)l−f(α)lαq =
Z
dαρ(α)e[−f(α)+αq]logl
(6.66)
i. e., we wrote Zq as an integral over the singularities α. In the limit l →0, the integral can be
evaluated using the saddle point approximation [see Appendix E, eq. (E.7)] and becomes:
Zq ∝e−[f(α)−αq]logl
(6.67)
where the dominating value of α is determined by:
∂
∂α[qα−f(α)] = 0 →f ′(α) = q
(6.68a)
∂2
∂α2 [qα−f(α)] > 0 →f ′′(α) < 0 .
(6.68b)
This yields via eqs. (6.33) and (6.66–6.67) for Dq:
Dq = {[qα(q)−f[α(q)]}/(q−1)
(6.69)
and after differentiation
α(q) = ∂
∂q[(q−1)Dq] .
(6.70)
By eliminating, via eq. (6.70), the variable q in favor of α and using eq. (6.69), one obtains
f(α) as (negative) Legendre transformation of (q−1)Dq:
f(α) = q(α)−[q(α)−1]Dq(α) .
(6.71)
For our example with ρ(x) = x−1/2, we ﬁnd from eqs. (6.69–6.71):

i. e., the α-spectrum consists of two points, as calculated above [see eq. (6.63)].

Numerical determination of the dimensions Dq, by covering the phase space with a set of
boxes of volume ld and counting the number of iterates which lie in a certain cell, is rather
cumbersome and in fact impossible for attractors of higher dimensions. However, we can
replace the sum over the uniformly distributed boxes in ∑i pq
i by a sum over nonuniformly
distributed boxes around the points xj of a time series which results, e. g., from a map xn+1 =
f(xj).

Here xi is an element of box i and ˜p[f j(x0)] ≡˜pj, is the probability of the trajectory to be

mathematical rigor is not attempted, that the change from pq
i to ˜pjq−1 is due to the fact that
the points xj of the time series (and the boxes around them) are nonuniformly distributed. We
next generalize eq. (6.72) to higher dimensional systems and write the probability ˜pj, that an
element of the time series falls into an interval l around the element⃗x j as:
˜pj = 1

ment of a single variable (Takens, 1983) works for the computation of C(l) for the Lorenz
attractor.

⃗ξ(ti) = {x(ti),x(ti +τ),x(ti +2τ)}. The slopes of both curves are the same, i. e., the correlation dimension
D2 = 2.05 obtained by both methods is the same, as stated above (Grassberger and Procaccia, 1983a).

Figure 83: D2 = 1.95±0.03 determined from a single-variable time series for the Mackey–Glass equa-
tion with parameter values τ = 17, a = 0.2, b = 0.1 for different embedding dimensions d (Hentschel
and Procaccia, 1983).
– The embedding dimension d:
Figure 83 shows the l dependence of the correlation integral for the Mackey–Glass sys-
tem. Although this system has an inﬁnite dimension, its correlation dimension is ﬁnite
and smaller than 3. It is therefore sufﬁcient to use a simple time series with a three-
dimensional vector⃗ξ(ti) = {x(ti),x(ti +τ),x(ti +2τ)} to determine D2. The dimension d
in⃗ξ(t) = {x(ti)...x(ti +(d −1)τ)}, above which D2 no longer changes, is the (minimal)
embedding dimension of the attractor.
– Separation of deterministic chaos and external white noise:
The correlation integral can also be used as a tool to distinguish between determinis-
tic irregularities, which arise from intrinsic properties of the strange attractor, and ex-
ternal white noise. Suppose we have a strange attractor embedded in d-dimensional
space and we add an external white noise. Each point on the attractor then becomes sur-
rounded by a uniform d-dimensional cloud of points. The radius of this cloud is given
by the noise amplitude l0. For l ≫l0, eq. (6.74) counts these clouds as points, and
the slope of a plot of logC(l) versus logl yields the correlation exponent of the attrac-
tor. For l ≪l0, most of the points counted lie within the uniformly ﬁlled d-dimensional
cells, and the slope crosses over to d, as shown in Fig. 84 for the noisy H´enon attrac-
tor.
Finally, let us brieﬂy comment on the intuitive meaning of the variable q and then present
two examples of Dq and f(α) curves.

6.3

Figure 84: logC(l) as a function of logl for the H´enon map embedded in three dimensions. Curve 1
is for the map without noise and yields D2 = 1.25. Curve 2 is for the map with random noise with
amplitude 5·10−3. Curve 3 is for the map with noise amplitude 5×10−2. Curve 2 and 3 break at length
scales that are determined by the noise level below which the slope is approximately 3 (Ben-Mizrachi et
al., 1983.)
If one replaces, in the deﬁnition of Dq via eq. (6.33), the pi by the probabilities ˜pj, for a
trajectory to fall in a box around an iterate (see eq. 6.72) then the resulting expression

a temperature T = β−1:
Fβ = −lim

(6.78)
The variable |logl| corresponds to the number of particles and q−1 corresponds to the inverse
temperature β. It follows already from eq. (6.77) that, for q →+∞, the most concentrated
parts of the measure (large ˜pi’s) are being stressed; whereas for q →−∞, the most rariﬁed
parts (small ˜pis) become dominant. In this sense, q indeed serves as the (inverse) temperature
in statistical mechanics where at every temperature a different set of energy levels Ei (i. e.,
probabilities exp(−βEi)) becomes dominant in the free energy.
Fig. 85 shows the Dq and f(α) curves for the Feigenbaum attractor that is generated by
the iterates of the logistic map xn+1 = rxn(1−xn) at r = r∞= 3.5699... (see Section 4.4). The
function f(α) must be concave because eq. (6.68b) requires f ′′(α) < 0, and the maximum of
f(α) at α = αm is equal to the Hausdorff dimension D0 because at the maximum f ′(αm) = 0
which yields via eqs. (6.68a–6.68b)
f ′(αm) = qm = 0
(6.79)
and
D0 = f(αm) .
(6.80)

Figure 85: The functions Dq and f(α), computed from eqs. (6.33), (6.71), and (6.74), for the Feigen-
baum attractor (after K. Pawelzik, priv. comm.).
Furthermore, we see from eq. (6.69) that, as long as f(α) remains bounded, the limiting
dimension D+∞becomes equal to the corresponding α values, i. e., D+∞= α(+∞) which
implies via eq. (6.59) f[α(+∞)] = 0. Thus, the zeros of f(α) are equal to D±∞, and the slope
of f(α) is inﬁnite at these points because of eq. (6.68a).
The dimension D−∞which is associated with the most rariﬁed regions of the Feigenbaum
attractor can be calculated as follows. The size ln, of the most rariﬁed region on the 2n attrac-
tor, which approaches the Feigenbaum attractor for n →∞, decreases as α−n where α is the
Feigenbaum constant. This is due to the fact that the function σ(x) from Section 4.3 which
measures the ratio of the distances between the elements of subsequent supercycles, has its
maximum at α−1 (see Fig. 31); i. e., the largest distance decreases like α−n. The probability
pn of a point on the 2n cycle to lie within the interval ln, is just pn = 2−n because only one
point of the cycle is contained in ln. Putting everything together, D−∞becomes:
D−∞= lim

(6.81)
which is in excellent agreement with the numerical result in Fig. 85 obtained from the time
series of the logistic map. Figure 85 shows that Dq converges very slowly against its limits
D+∞, but α(q = +∞) = D+∞can be easily extrapolated from the corresponding f(α) curves.
Thus, the transformation to f(α) leads to better estimates of D+∞than the direct calculation
of the Dqs. Another advantage of the f(α) spectrum is the fact that it represents (e. g., for
the Feigenbaum attractor) a smooth universal curve which yields the global density of scaling
indices. The universal function σ(x) of Feigenbaum, which everywhere describes the local
scaling (see Section 4.3), contains in principle the same (and even more) information as f(α),
but it is nowhere differentiable and is, therefore, a function that is difﬁcult to use. A further
example where the merits of the f(α) representation of experimental data become obvious
is given in Chapter 7 where we investigate the question whether an experimental orbit ob-
tained from a forced Rayleigh–B´enard experiment is in the same universality class as the orbit
generated from a circle map.

and we show, by way of an example, that their Legendre transformation is related to the

If we introduce a variable T = e−n, eq. (6.83) can be rewritten as
Kq = lim

q−1 log ∑

(6.84)
which looks – apart from the fact that we have a whole series of indices, instead of just one
– similar to eq. (6.23) for the Dqs with l replaced by T. It is, therefore, reasonable to try, in
analogy to eq. (6.64) the scaling ansatz
Pi0 ...in−1 ∝T λ(i0 ...in−1)
(6.85)
where the number of λ(i0, ...in) in the interval λ, λ+ dλ is [in analogy to eq. (6.65)] propor-
tional to
ρ(λ)T −g(λ) dλ .
(6.86)
Using the same arguments as in eq. (6.86), we arrive at the limit T →0 at
Kq =

q−1[λq−g(λ)]
(6.87)
where λ is determined by the saddle point conditions:
g′(λ) = q
(6.88a)
and
g′′(λ) < 0 .

where we used the fact that the invariant density ρ(x) = 1 for f(x). (This can be checked by
using eq. (6.89) in the Frobenius–Perron equation (3.29).
Next, we compute λ(q) and g(λ) via eqs. (6.87, 6.92):

−[pq log p+(1−p)q log(1−p)]/[pq +(1−p)q]

equal to
λ = λ(x) = −[xlog p+(1−x)log(1−p)] .
(6.97)
Similarly, we obtain from (6.87) and (6.96):
g[λ(q)]

(q−1)Kq −qλ(q) =

−log[pq +(1−p)q]+
+[pq log pq +(1−p)q log(1−p)q]/[pq +(1−p)q]

(6.98)
Equation (6.98) yields g(λ) as shown in Fig. 89 if we eliminate x in favor of λ via eq. (6.97).
The quantity λ(x), which appears in eq. (6.97), has a very simple interpretation. It is just the
“Liapunov exponent” of a ﬁnite series of iterates of length n which visits r times the interval

where y = r/n. The probability ˆP of ﬁnding it λ(y) is equal to the probability of ﬁnding in a
series of iterates, r times a point which is in [0, p] and (n−r) times a point which is located
in [p, 1], that is,

where we can again replace y by λ via eq. (6.90) to obtain ˆP(λ).
By comparing eqs. (6.97–6.98) and (6.100, 6.102), we see that eng(λ) is (apart from a factor
eλ) equal to the probability ˆP(λ) of seeing in a ﬁnite series of iterates the “Liapunov exponent”
λ. The Legendre transformation from the variable q in Kq to the variable λ yields, therefore,
the distribution g(λ) which describes the ﬂuctuations of the Liapunov exponent for a time
series of length n. Note that we used for our interpretation a map which is piecewise expanding
(i. e., |f ′(x)| ≥1 for all x ∈[0, 1]) and which yields, therefore, only positive expansion rates
λ. For general systems (which can also be higher dimensional), our results generalize to the
statement that eng(λ) describes the ﬂuctuation spectrum of the (sum of the) positive Liapunov
exponents, i. e., of the Kolmogorov entropy for ﬁnite time series (see Fig. 87).

which can be calculated from a measured signal. The condition K > 0 provides, of course, a
sharper condition for chaos than K2 > 0 (see also Cohen and Procaccia, 1985).
Let us ﬁnally summarize our results by a single formula which demonstrates that all gen-
eralized dimensions Dq and entropies Kq can be extracted from experimental data. Equa-
tions (6.83) and (6.104) yield for n →∞and l →0:
logCq
n(l) ∝n(q−1)Kq .
(6.108)
If we watch the sequence of limits (ﬁrst n →∞then l →0), we can combine eqs. (6.33, 6.54,
6.74, 6.83, 6.104) and obtain the compact expression
lim
l→0 lim
n→∞logCq
n(l) = (q−1)Dq logl +n(q−1)Kq .
(6.109)
Therefore, a plot of logCq
n(l) – which can be determined from an observed time series via
eq. (6.104) – versus logl yields, for ﬁxed q and different values of n, straight lines, with
slopes (q −1)Dq whose separations along the y-axis converge for n →∞to (q −1)Kq (see,
e. g., Fig. 88 for q = 2). The spectra f(α) and g(λ) can be obtained by Legendre transforma-
tion from these quantities. Figure 89 shows examples of Kq and g(λ) curves that have been
obtained by this method from a numerically generated time series of the tent map (6.89).

Let us ﬁnally add a word of caution. It is by no means completely straightforward to
obtain, from an experimentally measured time series, the Dq and Kq curves, because the signal
is noisy, the length of the series is ﬁnite, and the delay time which is needed to reconstruct
the attractor [see eq. (6.44)] is generally unknown. All this adds a good deal of ambiguity to
the application of the procedures described by eq. (6.109). We would like to call attention to
the Proceedings of a conference on “Dimensions and Entropies in Chaotic Systems” (edited
by Mayer-Kress, 1986) where merits and limits of different numerical procedures to extract
dimensions, entropies, and Liapunov exponents from a time series are discussed.
6.3.4
Kaplan–Yorke Conjecture
Although we above made a distinction between dynamic properties of a strange attractor, such
as the Liapunov exponents, and static properties measured by the Dqs, both quantities are in
fact connected. For example, if we have a ﬂow in three-dimensional phase space with two
negative Liapunov exponents, we know that the attractor contracts to a line with Dq = 1 for
all q (see Fig. 90).
Another example is the attractor which belongs to the non-area preserving baker’s trans-
formation (6.7). Its Hausdorff dimension DB [see eq. (6.10)] can be expressed in terms of the
Liapunov exponents λ1 = log2, λ2 = loga:
DB = 1+ λ1
|λ2| .

phase space and the signs of their three Liapunov exponents given in the brackets. (Zero means that the
Liapunov exponent has this value.) (After Shaw, 1981.)
Kaplan and Yorke (1979) conjectured the following more general formula for arbitrary strange
attractors:
DKY = j + ∑j
i=1 λi
|λj+1| .
(6.111)
Here DKY is the Hausdorff dimension according to Kaplan and Yorke, and the Liapunov expo-
nents are ordered λ1 > λ2 > ... > λd, such that j is the largest integer for which ∑j
i=1 λi > 0.
Although this formula has been checked numerically and shown to hold for some cases by
Russel et al. (1980) (see Table 9), it seems to be rigorously valid only for homogenous attrac-
tors, and its range of applicability is still an active ﬁeld of research.

Pictures of Strange Attractors and Fractal Boundaries
D. Ruelle writes at the end of his article on strange attractors in The Mathematical Intelli-
gencer (1980): “I have not (yet) spoken of the aesthetic appeal of strange attractors. These
systems of curves, these clouds of points suggest sometimes ﬁreworks or galaxies, sometimes
strange and disquieting vegetal proliferations. A realm lies here to explore and harmonies to
discover”. Figure 91 shows several examples of strange attractors that support this statement.
But we will see in the following that already the boundaries of attraction of simple rational
maps of the complex plane onto itself can have very complicated structures. If these objects
are plotted in color they show striking parallels to some of the self-similar pictures of M. C.
Escher.
Let us begin with a study of the basins of attraction for the ﬁxed points z∗= (1, e2πi/3,
e4πi/3) of the map
zn+1 = zn −(z3
n −1)/(3z2
n)
(6.112)
in the complex plane. (Equation (6.112) is just Newton’s algorithm for the solution of f(z) =
z3 −1 = 0 (0 = f(z) ≈f(z0)+ f ′(z0)(z−z0) →z1 = z0 −f(z0)/f ′(z0), etc.).)
One could think that the different basins of attraction for the roots z∗on the unit circle
would be separated by straight lines, But, if one runs eq. (6.112) on a computer and colors
starting points, which move to 1, e2πi/3, e4πi/3, in red, green and blue, respectively (and
black if the starting point does not converge), one sees from the results in Plate VIII (the
color Plates I–XX are shown at the beginning of the book) that the boundary of the different
basins forms highly interlaced self-similar structures (see also Fig. 92). This fractal boundary
solves the nontrivial problem of how to paint a plane with three colors in such a way that each
boundary point of a colored region (e. g., red) is also a boundary point of the other regions
(green, blue).
The boundary of a basin of attraction of a rational map is nowadays called the Julia set
(Julia, 1918) (for a more precise deﬁnition see, e. g., Brolin, 1965). “Usually” Julia sets are
fractals (for f(z) = z2 the Julia set is the unit circle), and the motion of iterates on these sets
is chaotic.
Next we consider the map
zn+1 = fc(zn) = z2
n +c
(6.113)
in the complex plane for complex parameter values c. Equation (6.113) is the logistic map
xn+1 = rxn(1−xn) in new variables x = 1/2−z/r; c = (2r −r4)/4.
The boundary of the basin of attraction of z∗= ∞forms a Julia set c of fc(z), which
depends on c:
Jc = boundary of {z| lim
n→∞f n
v (z) →∞} .
(6.114)
Figure 93 shows several examples of these sets. An important theorem by Julia (1981) and
Fatou (1919) states that Jc is connected, if and only if, limn→∞f n
c (0)
/→∞. Since this limit
depends only on c, one is led to consider the set M of parameter values c in the complex plane
for which Jc is connected, i. e.,
M = {c|Jc is connected = [c| lim
n→∞f n
c (0)
/→∞} .

ture of bifurcations of the (transformed) logistic map xn+1 = x2n + c along the real c-axis (after Peitgen
and Richter, 1984).
The set M is called “Mandelbrot’s set” after B. B. Mandelbrot who ﬁrst published (1980) a
picture of M (see Fig. 94). It shows that M has also a fractal structure (but it is no Julia
set). This study was extended by Peitgen and Richter (1984). If c does not belong to M,
then limn→∞f n
c (0) →∞. Therefore, they deﬁne “level curves” in the following way: color
a starting point according to the number of iterations it needs to leave a disk with a given
radius R. As shown by Douady and Hubbard (1982), lines of equal color can be interpreted
as equipotential lines if the set M is considered to be a charged conductor. Plates VIII–XV
show the fascinating results of this procedure which brings us back to Ruelles’ remark at the
beginning of this section.

7 The Transition from Quasiperiodicity to Chaos
In the ﬁrst section of this chapter, we shall discuss the emergence of a strange attractor in the
Ruelle–Takens–Newhouse route to turbulence (in time) and present some experimental sup-
port for this route. The subsequent section contains a study of the universal properties of the
transition from quasiperiodicity to chaos via circle maps and we introduce two renormaliza-
tion schemes, which are appropriate to describe local and global universality. In Section 7.3,
we present experimental evidence that circle maps indeed provide a useful description of the
transition from quasiperiodicity to chaos in real systems. The chapter ends with a critical
review of different transition scenarios that lead to a chaotic behavior.
7.1
Strange Attractors and the Onset of Turbulence
We come now to one of the most fascinating and difﬁcult questions; namely, how the onset
of ﬂuid turbulence in time (we will not consider the distribution of spatial inhomogeneities) is
related to the emergence of a strange attractor.
To understand what has been undertaken in this area, we ﬁrst introduce the Hopf bifurca-
tion (Hopf, 1942).
7.1.1
Hopf Bifurcation
A simple Hopf bifurcation generates a limit cycle starting from a ﬁxed point. For example,
consider the following differential equations in polar coordinates:
dr
dt = −(Γr +r3);
Γ = a−ac
(7.1a)
dθ
dt = ω .
(7.1b)
Their solutions are
r2(t) =
Γr2
0 e−2Γt
r2
0(1−e−2Γt)+Γ
with
r0 = r(t = 0)
(7.2a)
θ(t) = ωt
with
θ(t = 0) = 0 .
(7.2b)
For Γ ≥0 the trajectory approaches the origin (ﬁxed point), whereas for Γ < 0 it spirals
towards a limit cycle with radius r∞= |(a−ac)|1/2, as shown in Fig. 95.

with eigenvalues λ± = −Γ ± iω. This means that at a Hopf bifurcation a pair of conjugate
eigenvalues crosses the imaginary axis, as indicated in Fig. 95c.
7.1.2
Landau’s Route to Turbulence
A Hopf bifurcation introduces a new fundamental frequency ω into the system. As early as
1944 Landau therefore suggested a route to turbulence (in time) in which the chaotic state is
approached by an inﬁnite sequence of Hopf instabilities, as shown in Fig. 96.
Although this route leads to a time dependence which becomes more and more compli-
cated as more and more frequencies appear, the power spectrum always remains discrete and
approaches the continuum limit only after an inﬁnite sequence of Hopf bifurcations.

Strange Attractors and the Onset of Turbulence

Figure 96: Landau’s route to chaos. As the parameter R increases, more and more fundamental (i. e.,
incommensurate) frequencies are generated by Hopf bifurcations.
Figure 97: Power spectrum of the convection current for a B´enard experiment (after Swinney and Gol-
lub, 1978). With increasing (relative) Rayleigh number R∗= R/Rc the following states are observed:
a) periodic movement with one frequency and its harmonics, b) quasiperiodic motion with two incom-
mensurate frequencies and their linear combinations, c) nonperiodic chaotic motion with some sharp
lines, d) chaos.
7.1.3
Ruelle–Takens–Newhouse Route to Chaos
Figure 97 shows that this is not the case for the B´enard experiment. After the appearance of
two fundamental frequencies, the power spectrum becomes continuous.
This experiment was in fact performed, after the theoretical work of Ruelle, Takens, and
Newhouse (1978) who had suggested a route to chaos which is much shorter than that pro-
posed by Landau (1944). They showed that, after three Hopf bifurcations, regular motion
becomes highly unstable in favor of motion on a strange attractor (see Fig. 98).

130
7
The Transition from Quasiperiodicity to Chaos
Figure 98: The Ruelle–Takens–Newhouse route to chaos.
To be precise, we quote their theorem verbatim (Ruelle, Takens, Newhouse) (1978): “Let
v be a constant vector ﬁeld on the n-torus T n = Rn/Zn. If n > 3, every C2 neighborhood
of v contains a vector ﬁeld v′ with a strange Axiom A attractor. If n > 4, we may take C∞
instead of C2.” (Here C2 means that the neighborhood of the vector ﬁeld is twice continuously
differentiable, an Axiom A attractor (see Smale, 1967) is essentially our strange attractor, and
we ﬁnally mention that the original work of Ruelle and Takens (1971) described the decay of
a four-torus instead of a three-torus as in the theorem above.)
This means practically that if a system undergoes three Hopf bifurcations, starting from
a stationary solution as a parameter is varied, then it is “likely” that the system possesses a
strange attractor after the third bifurcation. The power spectrum of such a system will exhibit
one, then two, and then possibly three independent frequencies. When the third frequency
is about to appear, some broad band noise will simultaneously appear if there is a strange
attractor. Practically, the three torus can decay (into a strange attractor) immediately after the
critical parameter value for its existence has been reached, such that one observes in the power
spectrum only two independent frequencies, that is, two Hopf bifurcations and then chaos as
shown in Fig. 97.
It is understandable that chaotic motion only becomes possible after two Hopf bifurca-
tions, when the trajectory can explore additional dimensions, because doubly periodic motion
corresponds to a trajectory on a torus (i. e., on a two-dimensional manifold), on which chaos is
forbidden by the Poincar´e–Bendixson theorem. However, Ruelle and Takens (1978) showed
that a strange attractor is not only possible, but that there exist certain perturbations which
deﬁnitely convert quasi-periodic motion on a three torus into chaotic motion on a strange
attractor. The subtle point is that these perturbations can be inﬁnitesimal; however, not all
inﬁnitesimal perturbations will lead to a destruction of the three torus such that the probability
for the appearance of a strange attractor nevertheless can be small. The resulting attractor is,
in contrast to the three-torus, robust with respect to small changes in the parameters of the
system.
The proof of this theorem is mathematically too involved to be presented here. Instead, we
will proceed as follows. First we will present the results of a numerical experiment by Gre-
bogi, Ott and Yorke (1983) who investigated the strength of the perturbation which is needed
to destroy a three-torus in favor of a strange attractor. Basically, they conﬁrmed numerically
the theorem of Ruelle, Takens and Newhouse (1978), which had been obtained analytically,
but their calculations suggest that smooth perturbations must have a ﬁnite strength in order to
generate a strange attractor from a three-torus. Next, we describe two experimental examples
where three independent frequencies have been observed together with broadband noise in the

7.1
Strange Attractors and the Onset of Turbulence
131
power spectrum, and two experiments in which the destruction of a two-torus into a strange
attractor has been observed by reconstruction of the Poincar´e map. Since, in the last two
experiments, the third frequency has not been observed, one could ask whether there exists
a direct transition from a two-torus to a strange attractor that is independent of the Ruelle–
Takens–Newhouse (1978) mechanism. We leave this question open, because such a transition
could be interpreted as an example of the Ruelle–Takens–Newhouse scenario in which the
three-torus becomes destroyed by an inﬁnitesimal perturbation at the very moment as it is
about to appear, so that one practically observes the decay of a two-torus into a strange attrac-
tor (see, however, Curry and Yorke, 1978, for another interpretation). Finally, we discuss, in
the next section, universal features of the transition from (two-frequency) quasiperiodicity to
chaos in terms of simple circle maps, and describe some relevant experiments.
7.1.4
Possibility of Three-Frequency Quasiperiodic Orbits
Newhouse, Ruelle and Takens (1978) showed that, in a system with a phase-space ﬂow con-
sisting of three incommensurate frequencies, arbitrarily small changes to the system convert
the ﬂow from a quasiperiodic three-frequency ﬂow to chaotic ﬂow.
One might naively conclude that three-frequency ﬂow is improbable since it can be de-
stroyed by small perturbations. However, it has been shown numerically by Grebogi, Ott and
Yorke (1983) that the addition of smooth nonlinear perturbations does not typically destroy
three-frequency quasiperiodicity. (In the proof by Newhouse et al., the small perturbations
required to create chaotic attractors have small ﬁrst and second derivatives, but do not neces-
sarily have small third- and higher-order derivatives, as expected for physical applications.)
The calculation by Grebogi et al. (1983) can be summarized as follows: According to
Section 7.2, the Poincar´e map associated with a ﬂow having two incommensurate frequencies
(perturbed by ε f(θ)) can be described by the map (7.13):
θn+1 = θn +Ω+εf(θn)
(7.6)
where f(θ) is periodic in θ, and θn is taken modulo 1. By analogy, a ﬂow with three incom-
mensurate frequencies corresponds to a map:
θn+1
=
θn +ω1 +εP1(θn, ϕn)
(7.7a)
ϕn+1
=
ϕn +ω2 +εP2(θn, ϕn)
(7.7b)
where θn and ϕn are again taken modulo 1, and P1, 2 are periodic in θn and ϕn. The parameters
ω1, and ω2 are incommensurate with each other and with unity; that is, integers p, r, q do not
exist for which pω1 +qω2 +r = 0. By expressing P1, 2 as a Fourier sum of terms
Ar,s sin[2π(rθ+sϕ+Br,s)]
(7.8)
and retaining (somewhat arbitrarily) only the terms (r, s) = (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, −1),
Grebogi et al. calculated the Liapunov exponents λ1, λ2 for the map (7.7) for random values
of ω1, ω2, Ar,s and Br,s. Their results are summarized in Table 10, which shows that for a
ﬁxed typical choice of P1, 2 the measure of (ω1, ω2) yielding chaos approaches zero as ε →0.
Three-frequency quasiperiodicity is possible only when ε < εc, where the map is invertible.
The data in this table were computed using 256 random values of (ω1, ω2). The Liapunov
exponents have been determined to the order 10−4 (Grebogi et al., 1983a).

A transition from quasiperiodicity to chaos which still exhibits three-frequency quasiperi-
odicity (i. e., the decay of this state to a strange attractor is not complete) has been observed
by Libchaber, Fauve, and Laroche (1983) in a B´enard experiment with mercury in a magnetic
ﬁeld (see Fig. 99) and by Martin, Leber and Martienssen (1984) in the voltage spectrum of a
ferroelectric Barium-Sodium-Niobate (BSN) crystal (see Fig. 100).
In the ﬁrst case, the horizontal ﬁeld serves as a second control parameter and additionally
increases the viscosity of the electrically conducting ﬂuid. In the second, the Ba2NaNb5O15

crystal, which displays a nonlinear current–voltage characteristic, is placed into a heating
oven through which a constant ﬂow of humidiﬁed oxygen is maintained (part of the conduc-
tion mechanism is due to oxygen vacancies). A stabilized dc current is applied along the c-axis
of the sample and one measures the voltage across the crystal together with the birefringence
pattern. With increasing voltage, “domains” emerge from the cathode and disperse gradually
through the crystal (see Plate IV at the beginning of the book). Since there are three con-
trol parameters (temperature, current density and oxygen ﬂow), BSN provides an interesting
system for experimental studies of chaos.
7.1.5
Break-up of a Two-Torus
It has been mentioned above that the conversion of quasiperiodic motion into chaotic motion
on a strange attractor could occur apparently from a two-torus if the three-torus is so unstable
that the third incommensurate frequency cannot be observed. Such transitions belong in prin-
ciple also to the Ruelle–Takens–Newhouse scenario (see, however, Curry and Yorke, 1978)
and have been seen in two hydrodynamic experiments.

The Transition from Quasiperiodicity to Chaos

d) experiments showing with increasing Rayleigh number a transition form quasiperiodic motion (b) to
substructures indication the destruction of the torus (c) and then to a strange attractor (d). (After Dubois,
Berge and Croquett, 1982.)
Dubois and Berge (1982) observed experimentally the emergence of a strange attractor in
a B´enard experiment. They measured the time series of temperature T(t) and reconstructed a
two-dimensional Poincar´e section by plotting [T(t), ˙T(t)] at intervals t = nτ, where ω0 = 2π/τ
was determined from an independent measurement of the velocity. (This is another method
of reconstructing an attractor from the measurement of one variable; note that in our example
from chapter 6.3⃗x(t) = [sin(2πt), cos(2πt)] [eq. (6.43)] the y component y = cos(2πt) could
be obtained by differentiation, i. e., y ∝˙x.) Figure 101 shows how the Poincar´e section, which
consists of a closed loop (as expected for a section of a torus), develops into a strange attractor.
Another example for the emergence of chaos after two Hopf bifurcations has been ob-
served after a Taylor instability by Swinney and Gollub (1978). The Taylor instability occurs
in a ﬂuid layer between an inner cylinder rotating with an angular velocity Ωand a stationary
outer cylinder (see Fig. 102 and Plate III at the beginning of the book). For small Ω, angular
momentum fed to the inner cylinder is transported outside by viscosity (a). Above a critical
angular velocity Ωc, this state becomes unstable, and momentum is transported by annular
convection cells (b). At still higher Ωs, periodic and multiply periodic oscillations of these
cells occur which merge into chaos after two Hopf bifurcations.
The following results in Fig. 103 have been obtained by reconstructing the phase space
for a Taylor experiment from a time series of the radial velocity {v(tk), ..., v(tk +mτ)} with
tk = k ·τ0, k = 0, 1, 2, ..., (τ0 < τ):
a) The Poincar´e section shows the break-up of a torus similar to Fig. 101.

The Transition from Quasiperiodicity to Chaos
7.2
Universal Properties of the Transition from
Quasiperiodicity to Chaos
The transition from quasiperiodic motion on a two-torus to chaotic motion has also been
investigated by studying simple maps (Feigenbaum and Kadanoff, 1982; Rand et al., 1982,
1983; Jensen et al., 1984).
Figure 104 shows that the motion on an unperturbed unit torus can be described in polar
coordinates by the Poincar´e map
θn+1 = f(θn) ≡θn +Ωmod1 .
(7.9)
The parameter Ω= ω1/ω2 determines the winding number
w = lim
n→∞
f n(θ0)−θ0
n
(7.10)
which measures the average shift of the angle θ per iteration in eq. (7.10), the modulo in f has
to be omitted. We ﬁnd from eqs. (7.9–7.10) w = Ω. But it should be noted that the deﬁnition
of the winding number w given in eq. (7.10) holds for all maps of the unit circle onto itself.
In order to obtain an idea of how eq. (7.9) should be modiﬁed to describe the break-up
of a torus in a physical system, we reconsider our kicked rotator from Chapter 2, eq. (2.18),
for the case when a constant torque ΓΩhas been added to the driving force. If we make, in
eqs. (2.18a,b), the following simplifying substitutions for T = 1:
xn →θn ;
eΓ −1
Γ
yn −Ω→rn ;
e−Γ = b
(7.11a)
K f(θn) →
Γ

(7.11b)
we obtain

rn+1 = brn −K
2π sin(2πθn) ,

Figure 104: Motion on a unit torus. For rational ω1/ω2 = p/q, the trajectory closes after q-cycles. This
is called a mode-locked state. For irrational ω1/ω2, the motion is called quasiperiodic; the trajectory
never closes and covers the whole torus.

Figure 105: Break-up of a torus as described by the dissipative circle map [eqs. (7.12a,b)] (after Bauer,
priv. comm.).
where θn is the angle of the kicked rotator at time n, rn = yn[(eΓ −1)/Γ]−Ωis – apart from
a constant shift – proportional to the angular velocity yn = ˙θ(t = n). Equations (7.12a–7.12b)
deﬁne the so-called dissipative circle map.
For vanishing nonlinearity (K = 0) and ﬁnite
damping rate b = e−Γ < 1, eqs. (7.12a–7.12b) reduce to the unperturbed map eq. (7.9) where
Ωsets the rate of rotation.
Figure 105 shows that the dissipative circle map indeed describes the break-up of a torus
if the parameter K which measures the strength of the nonlinearity sin(2πθn) is increased
from K = 0.814 to K = 1.2. In both pictures, we plotted yn = (1 + 4rn)sinθn versus xn =
(1+4rn)cosθn with θn and rn from eq. (7.12) and Ω= 0.612, b = 0.5.
These pictures should be compared to Figs. 101 and 103 which show the destruction of a
torus in experimentally measured Poincar´e maps. For strongly dissipative systems (b →0),
the radial motion of the trajectory disappears in eqs. (7.12a, b), and they reduce to the one-
dimensional circle map:
θn+1 = f(θn) ≡θn +Ω−K
2π sin(2πθn)mod1 ,
(7.13)
which describes the transition from quasiperiodicity to chaos only by the motion of the angles
θn. Here θn is again understood modulo 1; K provides, in analogy to the Reynold’s number, a
measure for the nonlinearity sin(2πθn) (which must be added to obtain a transition to chaos),
and Ωagain sets the rate of rotation [see eq. (7.10)]. In the following section, we study the
break-up of the torus into a strange attractor via this map. It will be shown below that (by
analogy to the logistic map for the period-doubling route) the special form of f(θ) is rather
unimportant, and, of more importance, are the following general features of f(θ):
– f(θ) has the property f(θ+1) = 1+ f(θ).
– For |K| < 1, f(θ) (and its inverse) exists and is differentiable (i. e., f(θ) is a diffeomor-
phism).
– At K = 1, f −1(θ) becomes nondifferentiable, and for |K| > 1, no unique inverse to f(θ)
exists.
To obtain an overview of the behavior of the circle map (7.13), we show in Plate XVI (at

the beginning of this book) its Liapunov exponent λ depicted in colors as a function of the two
control parameters K and Ω. We distinguish three regimes (cf. Fig. 106):
– For |K| < 1, one ﬁnds the so-called Arnold’s tongues (Arnold, 1965) where the motion
is mode-locked; that is, the winding number w [see eq. (7.10)] is rational. Between these
tongues, the winding number is irrational. Both areas in the K −Ωplane, the mode-
locking and the non-mode-locking one, are ﬁnite (see Fig. 107).
– At K = 1, the Arnold’s tongues moved together in such a way that the non-mode-locked
Ωintervals form a self-similar Cantor set with zero measure.
– For |K| > 1, the map becomes noninvertible, chaotic behavior becomes possible, but
chaotic and nonchaotic regions are densely interwoven in parameter space (i. e., the K −
Ωplane).
In the following section, we will investigate these different regimes in more detail. In
the ﬁrst part of this section, we study the nonchaotic mode-locking behavior. Mode locking
means, according to eq. (7.10), that the ratio between the number of cycles, which the system
executes divided by the number of oscillations of the driving force (think of a kicked rotator),
is a rational number. Thus, mode locking with winding number w = 1 corresponds to complete
synchronization between the external force and the system. Since this phenomenon occurs
very often in nature – already in the 17th century the Dutch physicist Ch. Huyghens observed

7.2
Universal Properties of the Transition from Quasiperiodicity to Chaos
139
synchronization between two clocks hanging back-to-back on a wall – the understanding of
mode locking in nonlinear systems is of considerable interest.
In the second part of this section, we investigate universal properties at the transition from
quasiperiodicity to chaos using different renormalization group formalisms. Since one has
two control parameters K and Ωone has to distinguish between local scaling behavior, which
occurs near a point in the K −Ωplane, and global scaling behavior, which occurs for a whole
set of Ωvalues and describes the merging together of the Arnold tongues as the line K = 1, is
approached in Fig. 107.
It will be shown that the local transition from quasiperiodicity to chaos near an irrational
winding number displays, as a function of the control parameter Ωin its renormalization group
description, some formal analogies to the period-doubling route. In contrast, the numerically
found global scaling requires a different normalization group approach, and we will only
calculate the universal Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor set which is formed by the non-
mode-locked Ωintervals at K = 1 (see Fig. 107).
7.2.1
Mode Locking and the Farey Tree
In this subsection, we investigate the mode locking which occurs in the iterates of the circle
map. It will be shown that for ﬁxed K the width of an Arnold tongue decreases if the de-
nominator q in the corresponding rational winding number w = p/q increases. The resulting
hierarchy of tongues at K = 1 can be conveniently represented by a Farey tree which orders all
rationals in [0, 1] according to their increasing denominators (see Hardy and Wright, 1938).
For a general mode-locked state with w = p/q, the corresponding Ωinterval Ω= Ω(K)
can be calculated from the condition that a q-cycle with elements θ∗
1, ..., θ∗
q occurs in the
circle map (7.13):
f q
Ω,K(θ∗
i ) = p+θ∗
i
(7.14)
which is stable, i. e.,
f q′
Ω,K(θ∗

 < 1 .
(7.15)
(Here the indices K and Ωindicate that the left hand side in eqs. (7.14, 7.15) is still a function
of both variables.) Equations (7.13–7.15) yield, e. g., for w = 1:

and

For |K| < 1, the boundaries |f ′

eq. (7.16), that the ﬁrst Arnold tongue is a triangle with a width Ω

The Transition from Quasiperiodicity to Chaos
Figure 108: The mode-locking structure of the circle map, eq. (7.13) at K = 1. The devil’s staircase is
complete; the numbers denote the rational winding numbers (after Jensen at al., 1984).
The general eqs. (7.13–7.15) have been solved numerically by P. Bak and T. Bohr (1984)
who found that for 0 < K < 1 a whole interval ∆Ω(p/q, K) of Ωvalues is associated to
every rational winding number. For K = 1, these intervals form a complete self-similar devil’s
staircase as shown in Fig. 108. The staircase for K = 1 is termed complete because the sum S
of all Ωintervals is equal to 1, i. e.,
S = ∑
p,q
∆Ω(p/q, 1) = 1 .
(7.19)
For 0 < K < 1, the staircase becomes incomplete, i. e., S < 1.
Figure 108 shows that the widths of the steps become smaller if the denominator in the
corresponding winding number increases. Furthermore, if we have two steps with winding
numbers p/q and p′/q′, then the largest step in between has a winding number (p+ p′)/(q+
q′). If we list a few examples: 0/1 < 1/2 < 1/1; 1/2 < 2/3 < 1/1; 1/2 < 3/5 < 2/3, etc.,
we see that (p+ p′)/(q+q′) is the rational number with the smallest denominator which lies
between p/q and p′/q′. Thus the Farey tree, shown in Fig. 109, which orders all rationals p/q
in [0, 1] with increasing denominators q, orders also all mode-locking steps with w = p/q in
the circle map according to their decreasing widths.
Up to now, our observations were only based on numerical evidence shown in Fig. 108;
however, there exists also a simple analytical result that establishes the relation between the
devil’s staircase and the Farey tree.
The monotony of the circle map (and its iterates) in Ωimplies that to every winding num-
ber in the Farey tree belongs exactly one mode-locking step in the devil’s staircase. Suppose
one has a superstable q-cycle f q
Ω(p,q)(θ) = p + θ and a q′-cycle f q′
Ω(p′,q′(θ′). If we combine
both iterations we obtain:
f q
Ω(p,q)[f q′
Ω(p′,q′)(θ)] = p+ p′ +θ
(7.20)
that is, a cycle with the winding number (q + q′)/(p + p′). Increasing Ω(p,q) in f q
Ω(p,q)
overshoots this cycle. This can be compensated by reducing Ω(p′,q′) in f q′
Ω(p′,q′). Due to the
fact that both iterates are monotonous in Ω, one can repeat this procedure until both Ωvalues

Figure 109: The Farey tree orders all rationals in [0, 1] with increasing denominators according to the
rule that the largest rational between p/q and p′/q′ is (p+ p′)/(q+q′) (after Cvitanovic and Soderberg,
1985a).
coincide. Hence, the Ωinterval between the p/q and p′/q′ cycles, always contains an Ωvalue
which corresponds to a (p+q′)/(q+q′) cycle as claimed above.
The Farey tree construction has a universal importance because it orders not only the
mode-locking regions for the circle map, but also for real systems such as a driven pendu-
lum, Josephson junctions, and sliding charge density waves. This of course means that the
dynamics of these systems can be reduced to circle maps as will be shown in Section 7.3.
7.2.2
Local Universality
The transition from quasiperiodicity to chaos is characterized by two types of universality.
One is associated with the transition from quasiperiodicity to chaos for a special, that is, local
winding number, and it shows close parallels to the period-doubling route. Its experimental
veriﬁcation is difﬁcult because minute changes in winding numbers lead to large changes in
scaling behavior. The second type is called global universality and pertains to a whole range of
winding numbers. It describes the scaling behavior of the set of Ωvalues, complementary to
the Arnold tongues on which the dynamical system is mode-locked, and it has been observed
experimentally in several systems.
We begin with an investigation of the transition from quasiperiodicity to chaos for the
golden mean winding number, because it also forms the basis for the investigation of the
global universality for the circle map. In order to observe a transition from quasiperiodicity to
chaos in the iterates of (7.13), two parameters have to be adjusted. If we increase, for example,
the nonlinearity via K, Ωmust always be balanced to keep the winding number w ﬁxed to a
given irrational value (this guarantees quasiperiodicity). But how can this be performed for a
winding number which still gives the average shift of θ per iteration, and which, however, for
general maps has to be deﬁned as the limit [see eq. (7.10)]:
w = lim
n→∞
f n(θ0)−θ0
n
(7.21)
(where the modulo in f has to be omitted)? We use the following method which has been
suggested by Greene (1979) (in a similar context for Hamiltonian systems). One calculates

142
7
The Transition from Quasiperiodicity to Chaos
for ﬁxed K the value Ωp,q(K) which a) belongs to a q-cycle of the map f(θ), b) contains θ = 0
as an element, and c) provides a shift by p. Thus, Ωp,q which generates a rational winding
number w = p/q, is deﬁned by
f q
K,Ω(0) = p .
(7.22)
Next, the irrational winding number is approximated by a sequence of truncated continued
fractions, i. e., rationals. If we consider, for example, the winding number w∗= (
√
5 −1)/2
which has as a continued fraction of the simple form
w∗=
1
1+ 1
...
(7.23)
then the so-called Fibonacci numbers Fn which are deﬁned by
Fn+1 = Fn +Fn−1 ;

F1 = 1 ;

w∗=
1
1+w∗→w∗2 +w∗−1 = 0 →w∗= (
√
5−1)/2 .
(7.27)
This number is the so-called golden mean, which is deﬁned in geometry by sectioning a
straight line segment in such a way that the ratio of the longer segment l to the total length
L equals the ratio of the shorter segment to the longer segment, i. e., w∗= l/L = (L −l)/l.
In the following, we conﬁne ourselves to this special winding number w∗= (
√
5 −1)/2 =
0.6180339, which is the “worst” irrational number in the sense that it is least well approxi-
mated by irrationals [see eqs. (7.23–7.25)]. Although any given irrational number has a unique
representation by continued fractions, the renormalization scheme has, up to now, only been
applied to the so-called quadratic irrationals, which are the solutions of a quadratic equation
with integer coefﬁcients, and for which the continued fraction representation is periodic.

Using the procedure described above, Shenker (1982) obtained the following numerical
results for the circle map (7.13):
a) The values of the parameters Ωn(K) (7.13) which via (7.22) generate the winding num-
bers wn in (7.25), geometrically tend to a constant, i. e.,
Ωn(K) = Ω∞(K)−const· ˜δ−n
(7.28a)
where
˜δ =

(Note, that f Fn+1
Ωn (0)−Fn = 0).
c) Figure 110 shows the periodic function
u(t j) = θn(tj)−t j ;
j = 0, 1, 2, ...
(7.30)
that measures the time dependence of the cycle elements
θn(tj) = θ(j ·wn) ≡f j(0)
(7.31)
for times t j ≡j · wn in the limit n →∞. (Here, f j(0) is taken at Ωn(K), and u(tj) is
periodic since the property f(θ + 1) = f(θ) + 1 leads to θ(t j + 1) = θ(tj) + 1). For
|K| < 1 and Ωn →Ω∞, the variable u(t) varies smoothly with t, but its behavior becomes
“bumpy” for |K| = 1, which signals the transition from quasiperiodicity to chaos.

for ω = 0, ... Fn+1 is shown for n →∞in Fig. 110e. It displays self-similarity (the major
structure between any two adjacent peaks is essentially the same), and the main peaks
occur at powers of the Fibonacci numbers reﬂecting the fact that the motion is almost
periodic after Fn iterations.

The Transition from Quasiperiodicity to Chaos
Figure 110: a) u(t) for K = 0.5 (after Shenker, 1982); b) the map (6.57) at K = 0.5 and w = w∗is a
diffeomorphism (after Jensen et al., 1983a); c) u(t) becomes bumpy for K = 1 (after Shenker, 1982);
d) the map (6.57) at K = 1 and w = w∗becomes noninvertible f ′(0) = 0 (after Jensen et al., 1983a);
e) the power spectrum for K = 1 (after Rand et al., 1983). Note that indeed for n →∞, u(t j) converges
to a function in 0 ≤t ≤1 because the periodicity of u implies that its argument is taken mod 1 and j ·w∗
mod 1, j = 0, 1, 2, ... n covers [0, 1].
These results [especially a) and b)] appear very similar to those found for the period-
doubling route, and it is therefore natural to attempt a renormalization-group treatment of this
transition which establishes its universal features. The formal parallels between the transitions
to chaos via period doubling and quasiperiodicity are summarized in Table 11. (Note, that
˜α and ˜δ in eqs. (7.28–7.29) are different from the Feigenbaum constants.) To derive the
corresponding functional equations, we deﬁne [see eq. (7.29b)] the functions
fn(x)

˜αn f n(˜α−nx)

As in the case of period doubling [see eq. (4.14)], this relation indicates that the sequence
{fn(x)} converges towards a universal function
lim
n→∞fn(x) = f ∗(x)
(7.36)
where f ∗(x) is again the solution of a ﬁxed-point equation which we shall now derive. More
precisely, we consider fn at Ω= Ω∞, which corresponds to i →∞in eq. (4.20).
The function f n+1 can be obtained from f n and f n−1 by a rule which is dictated by the
recursion of the Fibonacci numbers (7.24) and the property f(x+1) = f(x)+1:
f n+1(x)
=
f Fn+2(x)−Fn+1
=
f Fn+1[f Fn(x)]−(Fn+1 +Fn)
(7.37)
=
f n[f n−1(x)] .
Because the operation of iteration is commutative, we also have
f n+1(x) = f n−1[f n(x)] .
(7.38)

146
7
The Transition from Quasiperiodicity to Chaos
According to eqs. (7.37–7.38), there are now two ways of calculating fn+1(x):
f n+1(x) = ˜αfn[˜αfn−1(˜α−2x)]
(7.39a)
and
fn+1(x) = ˜α2 fn−1[˜α−1 fn(˜α−1x)] .
(7.39b)
Both equations become equivalent for the initial conditions
f0[˜α−1 f1(˜αx)] = ˜α−1 f1[˜αf0(x)] .
(7.40)
Taking the limit n →∞in (7.39a), we obtain for the ﬁxed point function
f ∗(x) = ˜αf ∗[˜αf ∗(˜α−2x)] .
(7.41)
One can immediately verify that
¯f ∗(x) = −1+x
(7.42)
is a rigorous solution to this equation. If we substitute ¯f ∗(x) into (7.41), we obtain
−1+x = −˜α2 −˜α+x →˜α = −w∗−1 .
(7.43)
This value for ˜α [which is equal to the second solution of eq. (7.27)] agrees with the numerical
result for |K| < 1 [see eq. (7.29c)].
For |K| = 1, we expect that (7.41) has a different solution because the linear term is then
absent in our model equation (7.13):
f(0) = Ω+θ3 ·const. ,
for
θ →0 ;
|K| = 1 .
(7.44)
If for |K| = 1 we try the ansatz
f ∗(x) = 1+ax3 +bx6 ...
(7.45)
a value for ˜α is found which is consistent with eq. (7.29c). This establishes the universality of
the αs for |K| ≤1.
By analogy to period doubling, the ˜δs appear as eigenvalues of the linearized ﬁxed-point
equation. These equations are somewhat more complicated than in the Feigenbaum route
because the recursion relations are of second order; that is, fn and fn−1 are required to produce
fn+1 (for more details see, e. g., the article of Feigenbaum, Kadanoff and Shenker, 1982).
7.2.3
Global Universality
Let us now consider the globally universal properties of the set of Ωvalues that is comple-
mentary to the Arnold tongues and corresponds to irrational winding numbers. The following
numerical results have been obtained by Jensen, P. Bak and T. Bohr (1984):
– For K →0 (from below), the complement C of the total length of the steps in the (incom-
plete) devil’s staircase, i. e., C = 1 −∑p,q ∆Ω(p/q, K), decreases to zero with a power
law
C ∝(1−K)β
where the exponent β ∼= 0.34 is the same for all f(θ) in eq. (7.13) which have a cubic
inﬂection point at K = 1.

Figure 111: a) Self-similarity of the bifurcation tree; b) stability intervals of 2n, 2n+1, and 2n+2 cycles

– At K = 1, the Ωvalues belonging to irrational winding numbers form a self-similar thin
cantor set (of zero measure) whose Hausdorff dimension D∗= 0.87 is again universal.
Whereas there exists up to now no theoretical explanation for the value of β, we will
follow the work of Cvitanovich et al. (1985b) and calculate D∗by introducing a whole family
of universal functions that maintains a dependence on Ω[which was lost in the previous R.G.
formulation where we put Ω= Ω∞in eq. (7.36)]. For simplicity, we explain this method ﬁrst
for the period-doubling route and transfer it then to the circle map. Figure 111 shows again
the self-similar structure of the bifurcation tree from Section 4.1.
In order to capture the change in x and r, we follow the procedure of Cvitanovic (1984)
and introduce the modiﬁed doubling operator ˆT. It denotes the operation of iteration twice,
rescaling x by α, shifting r to the corresponding values (with the same slope at the cycle
points) at the next bifurcation, and rescaling it by δ:
ˆT fRn+p∆n(x)
≡
−αf n+1
Rn+1+p∆n+1(−x/α
(7.46)
=
−αf (n)
Rn+∆n(1+p/δn)[f (n)
Rn+∆n(1+p/δn)(−x/α)]
where
f (n)(x) = f 2n(x)
∆n = Rn+1 −Rn ,
δn = ∆n/∆n+1
(7.47)
and 0 ≤p ≤1 is a parameter which interpolates the rs between a 2n and a 2n+1 cycle. If we
call limn→∞δn = δ and
lim
n→∞
ˆTn fR0+p∆0(x) ≡gp(x) ,
(7.48)
we obtain from the deﬁnitions (7.46–7.48) an equation for the universal family of functions
gp(x):
gp(x) = ˆTgp(x) = −αg1+p/δ[g1+p/δ(−x/α)]
(7.49)
with boundary conditions:
g0(0) = 0
and
g1(0) = 1 .
(7.50)
The ﬁrst condition means that the origin of p corresponds to the superstable ﬁxed point. The
second condition sets the scale of x and p by the superstable two-cycle (see Fig. 112).

The Transition from Quasiperiodicity to Chaos
Figure 112: Boundary conditions for the functions g(x) and g1(x) deﬁned in the text (after Cvitanovic,
1984).
Note that our ﬁxed-point equation (4.21) for the usual doubling operator can be obtained
by choosing p = p∗such that gp∗= g1+p∗/δ, i. e., p∗= δ/(δ −1). The family of universal
functions gp(x) in eq. (7.49) is called the unstable manifold (Vul and Khanin, 1982) because
operation with ˆT drives gp(x) away from the ﬁxed-point values gp∗(x).
The advantage of eq. (7.49) with respect to the usual ﬁxed-point equation (4.21) is twofold.
First, one could obtain both Feigenbaum constants α and δ from eq. (7.49) by expanding gp(x)
into a double power series in p and x and comparing the coefﬁcients of equal powers, that is
one needs no linearization around the ﬁxed point.
Since we have calculated their values already in Section 4.2, we now concentrate on the
second aspect of eq. (7.49), namely its stability interpretation. It follows from Fig. 111b
and eq. (7.49) that if gp(x) has a stable 2n cycle (with n “arbitrarily high”) in the interval
−p0 < p < p0, then g1+p/δ(x) has a stable 2n+1 cycle in the p-interval around 1 whose width
is reduced by a factor of 1/δ.
This somewhat trivial looking statement becomes rather powerful if we translate eqs.
(7.46–7.49) to the circle map where they will allow us to obtain some insight into the
self-similarity of the width of the mode-locking regions.
The period-doubling operation
[eq. (4.21)] translates according to eqs. (7.37–7.39) into:
T[f n−1, f n−2] = ˜αf n−1[f n−2(x/˜α2)]
(7.51)
where f n(x) ≡f Fn+1(x)−Fn. Accordingly, the doubling plus x, r rescaling transformation ˆT
from eq. (7.46) changes into:
˜T[f n−1
Ωn−1+p∆n−1(x), f n−2
Ωn−2+p∆n−2(x)] ≡˜αf n−1
Ωn+p∆n[˜αf n−2
Ωn+p∆n(x/˜α2)]
(7.52)
= ˜αf n−1
Ωn−1+(1+p/δn)∆n−1[˜αf n−2
Ωn−2+(1+p/δn−1+p/δn−1δn)∆n−2(˜x/α2)]
where
∆n = Ωn−1 −Ωn ;
˜δn = ∆n/∆n +1
and 0 ≤p ≤1 interpolates the Ωs between an Fn and an Fn+1 cycle. Calling
lim
n→∞
ˆTn[fΩ0+p∆n−1

, f n−2
Ω−1+p∆−1] = ˜gp(x)
(7.53)

7.2
Universal Properties of the Transition from Quasiperiodicity to Chaos
149
Figure 113: Three steps in the universal devil’s staircase as generated by the stability intervals of ˜gp(x)
and eq. (7.54). The widths of the steps are p∗, p∗/˜δ and p∗/˜δ2 for Fn/Fn+1, Fn+1/Fn+2, Fn+2/Fn+3,
respectively, where n is “arbitrarily high”. Also indicated are the widths of the “holes” used in eq. (7.55)
(after Cvitanovic et al., 1985).
eqs. (7.52–7.53) yield [in analogy to eq. (7.49)]:
˜gp(x) = ˜α ˜g1+p/˜δ[α ˜g1+p/˜δ+p/˜δ2(x/˜α2)]
(7.54)
where the normalization conditions are again ˜g0(0) = 0, ˜g1(0) = 1.
One could again determine from eq. (7.54) the parameters α and δ for the route from
quasiperiodicity to chaos. But we will use here the universal object ˜gp(x) to investigate the
structure of mode lockings. For p = 0, ˜gp(x) has, by construction, a superstable ﬁxed point at
x = 0. Our arguments are now closely parallel to those which we used to interpret eq. (7.49) in
connection with Fig. 107. The range of p around zero, for which ˜gp(x) still has a ﬁxed point,
is the range of parameters for which the original map is locked (in some winding number wn
with “inﬁnitely large” n (see Fig. 113). However, around p = 1, there is another locked state
which corresponds to the next locked region in the sequence, and the width of this region
is scaled down by a factor of 1/˜δ compared to the ﬁrst (note ˜δ < 0 for the transition from
quasiperiodicity to chaos). Around p = 1 + 1/˜δ, there is another mode-locked region scaled
down by 1/˜δ2 compared to the ﬁrst, etc. Thus, by studying the stability of the ﬁxed point of
˜gp(x), one can ﬁnd an inﬁnity of mode-locked states which are universally located. Although
these are not all mode-locked regions (see Cvitanovic et al., 1985b), they are sufﬁcient to yield
an estimate for the Hausdorff Dimension D∗of the “holes” in the devil’s staircase at K = 1.
Generally, the Hausdorff Dimension of a self-similar fractal can be computed from the
equation (Hentschel and Procaccia, 1983):
∑
i
	si
¯s

D
= 1
(7.55)
where ¯s is the length of a box that covers the whole set of points and si are the linear dimension
of smaller boxes that also provide a complete coverage. Equation (7.55) can be derived by

150
7
The Transition from Quasiperiodicity to Chaos
noting that the number N of points of a fractal, which can be partitioned into boxes of size si
containing Ni points, can be written as
N = ∑
i
Ni .
(7.56)
Dividing this by N and using (Ni/N) = (si/¯s)D (which generalizes the formula that the number
of points in a ordinary cube of linear dimension l grows like l3), one obtains eq. (7.55). The
values si and ¯s, which are needed to compute D∗, can be read from Fig. 113. The range of
parameter values, for which ˜gp(x) has a stable ﬁxed point, follows from ˜gp∗(x∗) = x∗and
| ˜g′
p∗(x∗)| = 1. Since ˜gp(x) is universal, so is p∗and, therefore, D∗, which is computed from
the universal quantities p∗and ˜δ. If we estimate p∗crudely by p∗= 1/2π [which is just the
width of the ﬁrst Ωstep in the circle map, see eq. (7.17)], we obtain from eq. (7.55) and
Fig. (113) the value D∗∼= 0.92 which is less than 10% off the numerical result D∗= 0.87
found by Jensen et al. (1983b). More accurate theoretical values for D∗can be obtained by
considering better approximations to ˜gp(x) and p∗(see Cvitanovic et al., 1985b).
7.3
Experiments and Circle Maps
There exists a large variety of real systems (see below) whose dynamical behavior can be
modeled by circle maps. Usually an analysis to detect circle-map behavior proceeds as fol-
lows:
– The power spectrum of the (Fourier transformed) measured signal shows two or three
incommensurate frequencies before the onset of broadband noise. This indicates a tran-
sition from quasiperiodicity to chaos.
– A reconstruction of the trajectory in phase space, from the measurement of a single vari-
able, shows the destruction of a torus in favour of a strange attractor. By choosing a
proper plane in phase space, the torus section appears (before the transition to chaos) as
a closed curve which can be parametrized by θn. A plot of θn+1 versus θn reveals the
existence (or nonexistence) of a circle map θn+1 = f(θn) with f(θ+1) = f(θ)+1.
• An analysis of the time series of the measured angles θn as a function of the exper-
imental control of parameters reveals universal properties near the transition such
as:
• Devil’s staircase for the mode-locking intervals which is ordered by the Farey tree.
• Hausdorff dimension D0 = 0.87 for the unlocked intervals at the critical line which
corresponds to K = 1 in the circle map.
• Nontrivial scaling (˜α = −1.289) near the golden mean winding number.
In the following examples, we will show how this program actually works.

7.3
Experiments and Circle Maps
151
7.3.1
Driven Pendulum
One of the simplest physical systems whose dynamical description has been reduced to a
circle map (Jensen et al., 1983a, 1984) is a periodically driven pendulum with an additional
constant external torque B which is described by the differential equation:
¨θ+γ˙θ+sinθ = Acos(ωt)+B
(7.57)
Naive discretization of the time derivative in eq. (7.57) yields for θn = θ(t = (2π/ω)·n):
θn1+ −2θn +θn +(1−b)(θn −θn−1)+K sinθn = (1−b)Ω
(7.58)
where
(1−b) = γ2π
ω ;
Ω= 2π
ω (A+B)/γ ;
K = 2π
ω .
This is, for rn = θn −θn−1 +Ω, equivalent to the dissipative circle map:
θn+1
=
θn +Ω−K sinθn +brn
(7.59a)
rn+1
=
brn −K sinθn .
(7.59b)
Equations (7.58–7.59) make it plausible that the pendulum has something to do with the cir-
cle map, but they do not, of course, establish a rigorous connection. A numerical proof has
been given by Jensen et al. (1983a, 1984) who solved eq. (7.57) by using a computer. Fig-
ure 114 shows that subsequent values of the angles θn = θ(t = (2π/ω)n); n = 0, 1, 2 ...
taken at integer multiples of the driving period 2π/ω yield, for special parameter values, a
one-dimensional circle map.
Let us brieﬂy comment on how mode locking shows up in the solutions of eq. (7.57).
Mode locking implies:
θ(t0 +qT)−θ(t0) = 2π· p
(7.60)
where T = 2π/ω. This yields
⟨˙θ⟩≡1
qT
t0+qT
Z
t0
dt ˙θ = p
q ·ω
(7.61)
i. e., the mode locking state of the pendulum is characterized by the fact that its averaged
angular velocity ⟨˙θ⟩is a rational multiple of the external driving frequency ω.
Furthermore, the universal Hausdorff dimension D = 0.87 of the Cantor set derived from
the space between mode-locked plateaus has also been measured directly in an electronic
simulation of a driven pendulum by Yeh et al. (1984). They evaluated the following quantities:
S(l)
=
total length of all mode-locking steps larger than l
[1−S(l)]/l = N(l)
=
number of intervals of size l needed to cover the unlocked holes.
From N(l) they obtained, via liml→0 N(l) ∝l−D, the Hausdorff dimension D0 shown in Fig-
ure 115.

an enlargement around the inﬂection point. c) γ = 1.081, Ω= 1.094, the map develops a local minimum
and wiggles (insets) indicating chaotic behavior. (After Jensen et al., 1984.)

1/5 < B < 1/3 yields D0 = 0.92 based on 45 steps. (After Yeh et al., 1984.)

7.3
Experiments and Circle Maps
153
Let us also call attention to the colored plates, XVI and XVII, at the beginning of this
book which show the parameter dependence of the largest Liapunov exponents of a driven
pendulum and the corresponding quantity for the circle map. One sees how, in both cases, the
Arnold tongues develop and ﬁnally merge together as the nonlinearity parameter is increased.
Since eq. (7.57) also describes externally driven Josephson junctions and charge-density
waves under the inﬂuence of a dc and ac electric ﬁeld (Jensen et al., 1984), one expects that
the dynamical behavior of these systems can also be modeled by one-dimensional circle maps.
This has indeed been partly conﬁrmed experimentally (see References to this section).
7.3.2
Electrical Conductivity in Barium Sodium Niobate
Another ﬁne example, where the circle map and the devil’s staircase (associated to mode
locking) have been observed experimentally, is the Barium Sodium Niobate crystal that we
already described on page 132 (Martin and Martienssen, 1986). The voltage across the crystal
displays, under the inﬂuence of a constant dc current, spontaneous oscillations that can be
modulated by an additional ac current as shown in Fig. 116.
Figure 116: a) BSN crystal in humidiﬁed oxygen atmosphere at a temperature of 535 ◦C with an ac
current density jac superimposed onto a constant dc current density jdc. Also indicated are the “domains”
shown in plate V at the beginning of this book. b) Poincar´e map constructed from the measured voltage
signal. c) and d): the circle map (c) constructed from the measured voltage (a) becomes nonlinear (d) if
the dc current density is increased. e) Mode-locked states, measured by varying the driving frequency,
display a devil’s-staircase behavior near the transition to chaos. (After Martin and Martienssen, 1986.)

spontaneous-state period τ is shifted to a new value T. (From Guevara et al., 1981; copyright 1981 by
the AAAS.)
7.3.3
Dynamics of Cardiac Cells
It has been found by M. R. Guevara, L. Glass, and A. Shrier (1981) that circle maps are also
relevant for explaining the dynamics of cardiac cells. Figure 117 shows the temporal behavior
of the transmembrane electric potential from an aggregate of embryonic chick heart cells,
which beat spontaneously. If the system is periodically stimulated via a current pulse through
a microelectrode, the nature of the response depends on the interstimulus interval. The main
idea is to reduce this response to a single stimulus by constructing an appropriate circle map.
Figure 118 shows that the inﬂuence of a single pulse changes the period of the spontaneous
beats from τ to T. The assumption is now that their ratio T/τ depends only on the phase shift
θ = δ/τ of the stimulus with respect to the natural signal, that is,
T/τ = g(θ) .
(7.62)
This assumption is supported by the experimentally determined function g(θ) displayed in
Fig. 119.
Next we consider a train of stimuli separated by a uniform time interval ts. Consultation
of Fig. 120 leads to the relation
δi+1 +Ti = δi +ts .
(7.63)

cell aggregates. This graph is obtained by using g(θ) from Fig. 119 in eq. (7.64). (From Guevara et al.,

Division by τ, and assuming that the inﬂuence of a single stimulus decays sufﬁciently fast
such that eq. (7.62) holds for every i, yields the phase relationship:
θi+1 = θi +Ω−g(θi) ;
Ω≡ts/τ
(7.64)
which has the form of a circle map (see Fig. 121) where the rate of rotation Ω= ts/τ is set by
the interstimulus distance ts.

Figure 123: Human electrocardiogram showing one 3:2 Wenckebach cycle followed by ﬁve 2:1 cycles
(after Glass et al., 1981).
Using g(θ) from Fig. 119, eq. (7.64) has been used to successfully predict the response to
a train of stimuli as a function of ts (see Fig. 122). The so-called Wenckebach phenomenon in
Fig. 117c (i. e., the gradual prolongation of the time between a stimulus and the subsequent ac-
tion potential until an active potential is skipped either irregularly or in a phase-locked pattern)
occurs also in human electrocardiograms (Fig. 123). There the external stimulus is replaced by
the stimulus provided by the sinoatrial node. It appears, therefore, from the results in Fig. 122
that circle maps provide a promising tool for the investigation of human cardiac dysrhythmia.
7.3.4
Forced Rayleigh–B´enard Experiment
Another example where the global metric properties of the attractor which occurs at the tran-
sition from quasiperiodicity to chaos at the golden mean winding number have been measured
in some detail is a forced Rayleigh–B´enard experiment by Jensen et al. (1985). One uses
mercury as a ﬂuid in a small Rayleigh–B´enard cell that supports two convection rolls. The
Rayleigh number is chosen in a range where the convection is oscillatory in time. A second
frequency is introduced by passing an ac current through the ﬂuid whose amplitude and fre-
quency serve as control parameters. Figure 124 a shows the reconstructed experimental orbit
obtained at the point of the breakdown of the torus, which has a golden mean winding number.
The dots in Fig. 124 b are the experimental points derived from the data shown in Fig. 124 a,
and the full line is the f(α) curve obtained from the time series of the circle map at K = 1,
w∗= (
√
5−1)/2.

Figure 124: a) The experiment attractor of a forced Rayleigh–B´enard system in two dimensions.
2500 points are plotted. Note the variation in the density of points on the attractor. Part of this vari-
ation is, however, due to the projection of the attractor onto the plane. The attractor is nonintersecting in
three dimensions, in which it was embedded for the numerical analysis. In the absence of experimental
noise, the points should fall on a single curve. The smearing of the observed data set is mostly due to the
slow drift in the experimental system during the run over about 2 hours. b) full line: f(α) curve obtained
from the iterates of the circle map eq. (7.13) at K = 1 and the golden mean winding number; dots: f(α)
values obtained from the experimental data in a). (After Jensen et al., 1985.)
The agreement between both sets of data is rather obvious and leads to the conclusion that
the experimental data in Fig. 124 a, which look not at all like a smooth circle, and the iterates
of the circle map (7.13) belong, from the metric point of view, to the same universality class.
We note that this experiment yields also via D−∞the ﬁrst measurement of the nontrivial
scaling parameter ˜α of the circle map. D−∞has, at the transition from quasiperiodicity to
chaos, the value
D−∞= −logw∗
log ˜α = 1.8980...
(7.65)
which is obtained for circle maps, in analogy to eq. (6.81), by replacing the ratio in the number
of subsequent cycles (which is 2 for period doubling) by Fn+1/Fn = 1/w∗and using ˜α instead
of α.
7.4
Routes to Chaos
Table 12 summarizes the three different routes to chaos which we have discussed up to now.
But this table should only be considered as a ﬁrst approximation to the true variety of transition
scenarios. (Let us only recall that we have already discussed three types of intermittency).
While it is natural to focus on common features, it would be premature to make sweeping
generalizations about routes to chaos, and it should be emphasized that the range of dynamical
behavior observed is quite large.
This situation arises, on the one hand, because experiments on hydrodynamic systems
(B´enard and Taylor instability) depend sensitively on the aspect ratios (i. e., the ratio of the
cell dimensions in the B´enard experiment, and the ratio of the width between the inner and
outer cylinder and the height of the cylinder in the Taylor experiment) such that, for a given set
of control parameters, one can have more than one stable state. On the other hand, new types
of transitions are possible when one has more than one control parameter (Swinney, 1983).
Let us ﬁnally present a transition to chaos not mentioned above.

Crises
Crises are collisions between a chaotic attractor and a coexisting unstable ﬁxed point or peri-
odic orbit. Grebogi, Ott and York (1983b) were the ﬁrst to observe that such collisions lead to
sudden changes in the chaotic attractor. A simple example occurs in the period-three window
of the logistic map in Fig. 51, where three stable and three unstable ﬁxed points are generated
by tangent bifurcations. Figure 125 shows that the unstable ﬁxed points, having entered the
chaotic regions, immediately repel the trajectory out of the sub-band in such a way that the
regions between the bands are also ﬁlled chaotically. Similar crises also occur in two- and
three-dimensional maps and in three-dimensional ﬂows.
As the discontinuity is approached, one often ﬁnds transient chaos, i. e., seemingly chaotic
orbits which decay exponentially towards periodic orbits with a decay rate that follows a
power law of the distance (in parameter space) from the discontinuity. It has been conjectured
by Grebogi et al. (1983b) that “almost all” sudden changes in chaotic attractors are due to
crises.

8 Regular and Irregular Motion in Conservative Systems
Up to now we have exclusively studied dissipative systems for which volume elements in
phase space shrink with increasing time. Although there are many physical realizations of dis-
sipative systems, which range from the onset of turbulence in ﬂuids to electronic circuits, there
exists another large class of physical systems for which chaotic motion has been found (by
Poincar´e, 1982) before the discovery of the strange attractor for dissipative systems (Lorenz,
1963): These are the conservative systems which encompass all dynamical systems of classi-
cal mechanics.
Because there already exist excellent review articles by Berry (1978) and Helleman (1980)
and a recent book by Lichtenberg and Liebermann (1982) on this subject, our presentation will
be rather brief (as compared with six chapters on dissipative systems).
In the following, conservative systems are considered to be either systems that follow
Hamilton’s equations of motion,
˙⃗q = ∂H
∂⃗p ,
˙⃗p = −∂H
∂⃗q
(8.1)
and for which, volume elements in phase space are conserved because of Liouville’s theorem,

or, in a more general sense, volume preserving, discrete maps.
The fact that volumes do not change in conservative systems implies immediately that
they display (in contrast to dissipative systems) no attracting regions in phase space, i. e., no
attracting ﬁxed points, no attracting limit cycles, and no strange attractors (see Fig. 126 and
Appendix G). Nevertheless, in conservative systems one also ﬁnds chaos with a positive K-
entropy, i. e., there are “strange” or “chaotic” regions in phase space, but they are not attractive
and can be densely interweaved with regular regions.
We now present some motivation for the study of conservative systems and then give an
overview of the rest of this chapter.
For some time, attention has shifted from the calculation of individual orbits to consider-
ation of the qualitative properties of families of orbits, as shown in Fig. 127. Today, we are
mainly interested in the long-time behavior of conservative systems. There are several reasons
for this:

Regular and Irregular Motion in Conservative Systems
Figure 126: a) In dissipative systems trajectories are attracted to a ﬁxed point, and the volume shrinks.
b) In conservative systems the points rotate around an elliptic ﬁxed point, and the volume is conserved.

a) We should, for example, be able to answer the question whether the solar systems and
the galaxy are stable under mutual perturbations of their constituents, or whether they
will eventually collapse or disperse to inﬁnity. The long-time limit involved here is of
the order of the age of the universe. But “long” times are much shorter in the storage
rings used for high-energy physics or in fusion experiments, where the particles make
many revolutions in fractions of a second. In such systems irregular or chaotic motion
is to be avoided at all costs, and this is only possible if the long-time behavior of these
(conservative) systems is known.
b) Another point concerns the foundations of statistical mechanics, where no attempt is
made to follow the detailed motion of all constituents of a complicated many-body prob-
lem. Instead, the ergodic hypothesis is made, i. e., one assumes that in the course of time
the system explores the entire region of phase space allowed (the energy surface) and
eventually covers this region uniformly. Time averages can then be replaced by simpler
phase-space averages. But is the ergodic hypothesis correct? To answer this question,
the long-time behavior of Hamiltonian systems with N degrees of freedom in the limit
N →∞(and N/volume = constant) must be known.

8.1
Coexistence of Regular and Irregular Motion
163
In the ﬁrst part of this section, we consider the classical mechanics of simple Hamiltonian
systems with a few degrees of freedom and show that in most cases their motion in phase
space is extremely complicated and neither regular nor simply ergodic. In other words, it
will be shown that the regular motion treated in most textbooks on classical mechanics is an
exception and rather uncommon.
In the second part, we discuss some simple model systems which behave ergodically al-
though they have only a few degrees of freedom. Finally, a classiﬁcation scheme for chaotic
behavior in conservative systems is described.
8.1
Coexistence of Regular and Irregular Motion
In the following, we investigate the stability of the trajectories of a nonintegrable Hamiltonian
system in the long-time limit. For this purpose, we start from an integrable Hamiltonian and
consider the effect of a small nonintegrable perturbation.
8.1.1
Integrable Systems
A Hamiltonian H′
0(⃗p,⃗q) is called integrable if one can ﬁnd a canonical transformation S(⃗q,⃗J)
to new variables⃗θ, ⃗J:
⃗q, ⃗p = ∂S(⃗q, ⃗J)
∂⃗q
↔⃗J, ⃗θ = ∂S(⃗q, ⃗J)
∂⃗J
(8.3)
such that in the new coordinates the Hamiltonian depends only on the new momenta ⃗J, i. e.,
S(⃗q,⃗J) is a solution of the Hamilton–Jacobi equation (see, e. g., Arnold, 1978):
H′
0 =

⃗q, ∂S(⃗q, ⃗J)
∂⃗q

= H0(⃗J)
(8.4)
and the equations of motion in the action-angle variables ⃗J and⃗θ
˙⃗J = −∂H0
∂⃗θ

(8.5)
˙⃗θ = −∂H0
∂⃗J
=⃗ω(⃗J)
(8.6)
can easily be integrated to
⃗J = const.
⃗θ =⃗ω·t +⃗δ .
(8.7)
One of the simplest examples for an integrable system is a harmonic oscillator that has
the Hamiltonian
H′
0 = 1
2(p2 +ω2q2) .

The corresponding trajectory in phase space is an ellipse that becomes a circle with polar
coordinates

J and θ after proper rescaling. Comparing eqs. (8.7) and (8.13) one sees that
the equations of motion (in action-angle variables) of any integrable system with n degrees of
freedom are practically the same as those of a set of n uncoupled harmonic oscillators. The
only difference is that in a general integrable system the frequencies ωi are still functions of
the actions Ji whereas they are independent of Ji for harmonic oscillators. The existence of n
integrals of the motion (J1, ... Jn) conﬁnes the trajectory in the 2n-dimensional phase space
(q1 ... qn, p1 ... pn) of an integrable system to an n-dimensional manifold which has – in
analogy to a circle for a harmonic oscillator with n = 1 and a torus for two harmonic oscillators
with n = 2 – the topology of an n-torus.
In the following, we will conﬁne ourselves to n = 2, but most results can be extended
to more degrees of freedom. Figure 128 shows the motion of an integrable system with two
degrees of freedom (i. e., with a four-dimensional phase space) on a torus. Closed orbits occur
only if
n∆θ2 = 2π·m ,
i. e.,

m, n = 1, 2, 3 ...

Figure 128: Torus in phase space.
For irrational frequency ratios, the orbit never repeats itself but approaches every point on
the two-dimensional manifold inﬁnitesimally close in the course of time. In other words, the
motion is ergodic on the torus. (Note that the dimension 2 of the torus is different from the
dimension 3 of the manifold deﬁned by H(⃗p,⃗q) = E = const.)
8.1.2
Perturbation Theory and Vanishing Denominators
Let us now add to H0 a perturbation εH1 and see how it affects the previously regular motion;
that is, we consider the Hamiltonian
H(⃗J, ⃗θ) = H0(⃗J)+εH1(⃗J, ⃗θ)
(8.18)
(where we expressed H1 in the action-angle variables ⃗J = (J1, J2),⃗θ = (θ1, θ2) of the unper-
turbed system), and we try to solve the Hamilton–Jacobi equation
H
∂S
∂⃗θ
, ⃗θ

= H00(⃗J′) .
(8.19)
Writing the generating function S as
S(⃗J′, ⃗θ) =⃗θ· ⃗J′ +εS1(⃗J′, ⃗θ)
(8.20)
and expanding M to order ε, we obtain
H0(⃗J′)+ε∂H0
∂⃗J
· ∂S1(⃗J′, ⃗θ)
∂⃗θ
+εH1(⃗j′, ⃗θ)+O(ε2) = H00(⃗J′)
(8.21)
S1 is determined by requiring that the left-hand side in (8.21) is independent of θ, i. e.,
⃗ω· ∂S1(⃗J′, ⃗θ)
∂⃗θ
= −H1(⃗J′, ⃗θ)
(8.22)

166
8
Regular and Irregular Motion in Conservative Systems
where ⃗ω = ∂H0/∂⃗J′ are the frequencies of the unperturbed system. Equation (8.21) can be
solved by expanding S1 and H1 (both being periodic in the components of ⃗θ) into Fourier
series:
S1(⃗J′, ⃗θ) = ∑
k̸=0
S1,⃗K(⃗J′) ei⃗K·⃗θ
(8.23a)
H1(⃗J′, ⃗θ) = ∑
k̸=0
H1,⃗K(⃗J′) ei⃗K·⃗θ
(8.23b)
with ⃗K = 2π(n1, n2); n1, n2 integers.
Using both expressions in (8.22) and comparing equal Fourier components, ﬁnally yields
S(⃗J′, ⃗θ) =⃗θ· ⃗J′ +iε ∑
⃗K̸=0
H1,⃗K(⃗J′)
⃗K ·ω(⃗J′)
ei⃗K·⃗θ .
(8.24)
Equation (8.24) shows that S diverges for
ω1n1 +ω2n2 = 0 ,
i. e.,
ω1
ω2
= −n2
n1
= rational .
(8.25)
This is the famous problem of vanishing denominators. It shows that the system cannot be
integrated by perturbation theory for rational frequency ratios because of strong resonances,
and it seems that it can at most be integrated for irrational values of ω1/ω2 if the perturbation
series in ε converges.
In the following we consider two problems:
– What happens if an integrable system with ω1/ω2 close to an irrational value is perturbed
by εH1?
– What happens under a perturbation εH1 to the tori of a system for which ω1/ω2 has a
rational value?
8.1.3
Stable Tori and KAM Theorem
The ﬁrst question is answered by a celebrated theorem of Kolmogorov (1954), Arnold (1963),
and Moser (1967), the so-called KAM theorem which we quote here for n = 2, without proof.
(The theorem holds for an arbitrary number n of degrees of freedom and proofs can be found
in the quoted references.) The theorem states that if, among other technical conditions, the
Jacobian of the frequencies is nonzero, i. e.,
				
∂ωi
∂Jj
				 ̸= 0
(8.26)
then those tori, whose frequency ratio ω2/Ω1 is sufﬁciently irrational such that
				
ω1
ω2
−m
s
				 > k(ε)
s2.5
(k(ε →0) →0)
(8.27)
holds (m and s are mutually prime integers), are stable under the perturbation εH1 in the limit
ε ≪1.

8.1
Coexistence of Regular and Irregular Motion
167
Figure 129: Intervals of lengths k(ε)/s2.5 contributing to L.
It is important to note that the set of frequency ratios, for which (8.27) holds and for which
the motion is therefore regular, even after the perturbation, has a nonzero measure. This
follows because the total length L of all intervals in 0 ≤ω1/ω2 ≤1, for which (8.27) does not
hold can be estimated as
L <
∞
∑
s=1
k(ε)
s2.5 ·s = k(ε)
∞
∑
s=1
s−1.5 = const.·k(ε) →0
for
ε →0 .
(8.28)
Here k(ε)/s2.5 is the length of an interval around the rational m/s where (8.27) does not apply,
and s is the number of m values with m/s ≤1 (see Fig. 129).
Equation (8.28) means that the set of frequency ratios, for which (under a perturbation by
εH1) the original motion on the torus is only slightly disturbed into the motion of a deformed
torus, has the ﬁnite measure 1−const.·k(ε). But, on the ω1/ω2 axis, this set has holes around
every rational ω1/ω2.
For large enough ε the perturbation εH1 destroys all tori. The last KAM torus which will
be destroyed is the one for which the frequency ratio is the “worst irrational number“ ω1/ω2 =
(
√
5 −1)/2 (see Section 7.2). The destruction of this KAM torus shows some similarity to
the Ruelle–Takens route to chaos in dissipative systems. It has indeed been found by Shenker
and Kadanoff (1982) and McKay (1983) who studied the conservative version (b = 1) of the
map (7.12) of the annulus onto itself that the decay of the last KAM trajectory shows scaling
behavior and universal features.
8.1.4
Unstable Tori and Poincar´e–Birkhoff Theorem
Let us now discuss the situation when ω1/ω2 is rational. We will show that in this case the
original torus decomposes into smaller and smaller tori. Some of these newly created tori
are again stable according to the KAM theorem. But, between the stable tori, the motion is
completely irregular.
It is convenient to visualize what happens (to H0 under a perturbation εH1) in a Poincar´e
map that is, in general, deﬁned by the intersection points of the orbit with a hyperplane in
phase space. For the case in hand, we consider the intersections with the q1, p1 plane S shown
in Fig. 130, which deﬁne an area-preserving two-dimensional map
ri+1 = ri ;
ri = r

since the point in phase space hits S after a period 2π/ω2 during which θ changes by 2πω1/ω2.

This is Moser’s twist map (Moser, 1973).

where f and g depend on H1. As a consequence of Liouville’s theorem (which also holds for
the Hamiltonian H0 +εH1), the map Tε is area-preserving.
What can we say now about the ﬁxed points of Tε? Consider two circles C+ and C−
between which lies the circle C on which a = r/s. On C+, a > s and on C−, a < r/s. T s
therefore maps C+ anti-clockwise, C−clockwise, and C not at all (see Fig. 131).
Under the perturbed map T s
ε these relative twists are preserved if ε is small enough. Thus,
on any radius from 0 there must be one point whose angular coordinate is unchanged by T s
ε .
These radially mapped points make up a curve Rε close to C.

Figure 132 shows the curve Rε formed by these points, and its image T s

Rε in an even number of points because the area enclosed by Rε and T s
ε (Rε) must be the same.
The points common to Rε and T s
ε (Rε) are the ﬁxed points of T s
ε and we can see in Fig. 133
that an alternating sequence of elliptic and hyperbolic ﬁxed points emerges.
This means
that the original torus with rational frequency ratio is not completely destroyed under a per-
turbation, but there remains an even number of ﬁxed points. This is the “Poincar´e–Birkhoff
theorem” (Birkhoff, 1935).

Figure 134: Tori with rational frequency ratio decay into smaller and smaller tori, and the pattern of
newly created elliptic and hyperbolic ﬁxed points shows self-similarity.
Let us ﬁrst consider the elliptic ﬁxed points which are surrounded by rotating points (see
Figs. 126, 133). The corresponding orbits are the Poincar´e sections of smaller tori for which
all our arguments can be repeated; that is, some of these smaller tori are again stable according
to the KAM theorem and other tori decompose into smaller ones according to the Poincar´e–
Birkhoff theorem. This gives rise to the self-similar structure in Fig. 134.
8.1.5
Homoclinic Points and Chaos
Which role do the hyperbolic ﬁxed points play? Fig. 135 shows that, near a hyperbolic ﬁxed
point H, the motion becomes unstable, and orbits are driven away from it, in contrast to the
stable rotational motion around an elliptic ﬁxed point.
The stable (Ws) and unstable (Wu) lines which lead to or emanate from H behave highly
irregularly since:
a) They cannot intersect themselves (otherwise the motion on a trajectory in phase space
would not be unique for a given set of initial conditions),
b) but Wu can intersect Ws at a so-called homoclinic point (see Fig. 136).
Because the map T s
ε is continuous, and a homoclinic point is not a ﬁxed point, repeated
application of T s
ε produces new homoclinic points. Furthermore, T s
ε must be applied an inﬁnite
number of times to approach the hyperbolic ﬁxed point H along Ws (Appendix G). Between
each homoclinic point H0 and H1 there is, therefore, an inﬁnite number of other homoclinic
points; that is, the curves Wu and Ws form an extremely complex network.

Figure 136: Homoclinic points H0 are the intersections of Wu and Ws.
Figure 137: Regular and irregular motion in the phase space of a nonintegrable system.
Summarizing: If we disturb the regular orbits of an integrable system on a torus in phase
space by adding a nonintegrable perturbation, then, depending on the different initial condi-
tions [different ⃗J, ⃗δ in (7.7) imply different ω1/ω2, since ⃗ω = ⃗ω(⃗J)], regular or completely
irregular motion results. Although the measure of initial conditions, which lead to regular
motion, is nonzero due to the KAM theorem, for every rational frequency ratio (which are
densely distributed along the real axis) one obtains smaller and smaller stable tori and irreg-
ular orbits due to the hyperbolic ﬁxed points. Thus, an arbitrarily small change in the initial
conditions leads to a completely different long-time behavior; and for the motion in phase
space, one obtains the complicated pattern in Fig. 137. It shows that in conservative systems
regular and irregular motion are densely interweaved.
Finally, we also mention that for area-preserving maps one ﬁnds “period doubling”, i. e., a
successive creation of new pairs of elliptic ﬁxed points (Greene et al., 1981). We shall discuss
this scenario in Appendix G and show that the corresponding Feigenbaum constants are larger
than in the dissipative case.
8.1.6
Arnold Diffusion
So far in this section we have only dealt with systems having two degrees of freedom for which
the two-dimensional tori stratify the three-dimensional energy surface SE. The irregular orbits
which traverse regions where rational tori have been destroyed are therefore trapped between
irrational tori. They can only explore a region of the energy surface which, while three-
dimensional, is nevertheless restricted and, in particular, disconnected from other irregular
regions, as shown in Fig. 138.

Regular and Irregular Motion in Conservative Systems
Figure 138: Trapping of irregular orbits between stable KAM tori for a system with two degrees of
freedom.
Figure 139: Arnold diffusion for Hamiltonian systems with more than two degrees of freedom (schemat-
ically).
For more degrees of freedom, however, the tori do not stratify SE (e. g., for three degrees
of freedom the tori are three-dimensional, and the energy surface is ﬁve-dimensional). The
gaps then form one single connected region. This offers the possibility of so-called “Arnold
diffusion“ of irregular trajectories (Arnold, 1964). The existence of invariant tori for perturbed
motion is, therefore, not a guarantee of stability of motion for systems with more than two
degrees of freedom because irregular wandering orbits that are not trapped exist arbitrarily
close to the tori (cf. Fig. 139).
8.1.7
Examples of Classical Chaos
Finally, we present some experimental evidence for the coexistence of regular and irregular
motion. Figure 140 shows the Poincar´e map in S for the nonintegrable H´enon–Heiles system,

terms (H´enon, Heiles, 1964). The left-hand column shows the surfaces of section generated
by eighth-order perturbation theory for various energies (after Gustavson, 1966). The right-
hand side are the computed intersections of the trajectory with S. For E = 1/24 and E =
1/12, the mapping plane is covered with the intersections of (somewhat deformed) tori which
signal regular motion and which are identical with those given by perturbation theory. Above
E = 1/9, however, most, but not all, tori are destroyed, and all the dots which appear to be

random are generated by one trajectory as it crosses S. The ﬁgure for E = 1/8 clearly shows
the coexistence of regular and irregular motion. As a further example, we consider the motion
of an asteroid around the sun, perturbed by the motion of Jupiter, as shown in Fig. 141.
This three-body problem is nonintegrable, and according to eqs. (8.24–8.25) we expect
that the asteroid motion becomes unstable if the ratio of the unperturbed frequency of the

Berry, 1978).
asteroid motion ω and the angular frequency of Jupiter ωj becomes rational. Figure 142
illustrates that, in fact, gaps occur in the asteroid distribution for rational ω/ωj. On the other
hand, the existence of stable asteroid orbits (f ̸= 0) can be considered as a conﬁrmation of the
KAM theorem.
A second sort of solar-system gap occurs in the rings of Saturn. In this system Saturn is the
attractor; the perturber is any of the inner satellites, and the rest masses are the ring particles.
One major resonance occurs within the “Cassini division” shown on Plate VII at the beginning
of the book.
8.2
Strongly Irregular Motion and Ergodicity
In the previous section, we linked the origin of irregular motion in Hamiltonian systems to
hyperbolic ﬁxed points in the associated area-preserving maps. If we, therefore, want to con-
struct models for strongly irregular motion, it is natural to search for maps for which all ﬁxed
points are hyperbolic.
8.2.1
Cat Map
One example of such a system is Arnold’s cat map on a torus which is deﬁned by
xn+1
=
xn +yn mod1
yn+1
=
xn +2yn mod1

≡T
xn
yn

(8.35)
This map is area-preserving because the Jacobian of T is unity, and it has the eigenvalues
λ1 = (3+
√
5)/2 > 1
and
λ2 = λ−1
1
< 1
(8.36)
so that all ﬁxed points of T n (n = 1, 2, 3 ...) are hyperbolic. Any point on the torus for which
x0 and y0 are rational fractions is a ﬁxed point of T n for some n (e. g., (0, 0) is a ﬁxed point of
T, and (2/5, 1/5) and (3/5, 4/5) are ﬁxed points of T 2, etc.), and these are the only ﬁxed points
because T has integral coefﬁcients. The action of the cat map is illustrated in Fig. 143. After
just one iteration the cat is wound around the torus in complicated ﬁlaments; its dissociation
arises from the hyperbolic nature of T which causes initially close points to map far apart.

Strongly Irregular Motion and Ergodicity

b). ˆT is the map T without restriction to the torus. (After Arnold and Avez, 1968.)
Figure 144: Motion of Wu and Ws under the cat map.
The axes of stretch (Wu) and compression (Ws) from (0, 0) lie along irrational directions
and so wrap densely around the torus, never intersecting themselves but intersecting one an-
other inﬁnitely often, as shown in Fig. 144.
Since any set of iterates [which starts from a point (x0, y0) with x0/y0 = irrational] eventu-
ally covers the torus, “time” averages over the iterates are equal to “space” averages over the
torus, and the motion generated by the cat map is ergodic.
However, the cat map has even a stronger property – mixing. In other words, the map
distorts any area element so strongly, that it is eventually spread over the whole torus, just as
a drop of ink (its volume corresponds to an area element in the cat map) is homogeneously
distributed throughout a glass of water after it has been stirred (see Fig. 145).

8.2.2
Hierarchy of Classical Chaos
Table 13 gives an overview of the hierarchy of properties which indicates increasingly chaotic
motion.
The ﬁrst entry in Table 13 contains the well-known Poincar´e recurrence theorem for
Hamiltonian systems. It is simply a consequence of area-preserving motion in a ﬁnite re-
gion. We can draw an analogy to what happens if we take a walk in a snow-covered ﬁnite
square: eventually the area will be covered with footprints; and after some time, one is forced
to walk on one’s own prints (again and again).
Recurrence does not imply ergodicity because the allowed areas need not be connected
(there could be two squares). If the phase space is divided, the trajectory is conﬁned to the
region in which it started and does not cover the whole phase space.
More formally, a map f is called mixing, if
lim
n→∞ρ[f n(A)∩B] = ρ(A)ρ(B)
(8.37)
for every pair of measurable sets A and B. Here ρ is the invariant measure of f. We used the
abbreviation
ρ(A) ≡
Z
A dxρ(x)
(8.38)
and assumed that the measure of the allowed phase space Γ, on which f acts, is normalized to
unity, i. e.,
R
Γ dxρ(x) = 1.

i. e., mixing means that the autocorrelation function ⟨(xn −⟨x0⟩)(x0 −⟨x0⟩)⟩= ⟨xnx0⟩−⟨x0⟩2
decays to zero and “the system relaxes to thermal equilibrium”. (The general proof can be
found in the book by Arnold and Avez (1968) who actually show that a system is mixing
if, and only if, limn→∞⟨F∗[f n(x)]G(x)⟩= ⟨F∗(x)⟩⟨G(x)⟩for any square integrable complex-
valued functions F and G.)
Although ergodicity (of course) implies recurrence, it does not imply mixing. Consider,
for example, the map
xn+1 = xn +bmod1 ≡f(xn)
(8.40)
which shifts a point x0 on a unit circle by b.
The map is ergodic for irrational values of b, because then a given starting point x0 never
returns to itself, as it does for rational b = p/q, (p, q integers) after q steps, and the images of
x0 cover the circle uniformly. The Liapunov exponent for this map is
λ = lim

(8.41)
i. e., (8.40) is an example that shows a) ergodicity without sensitive dependence on the initial
conditions, and b) ergodicity without mixing. The last statement follows because the overlap

of the images f n(A) of a line element A with another (line) element B is either ﬁnite or zero
(according to the number of iterations) and never reaches a ﬁnite equilibrium value as required
by eq. (8.37) (see Fig. 146). (Note that for simplicity we have replaced in this example “area”
elements by “line” elements.)
Typical systems that show mixing are the cat map (Fig. 143) and the baker’s transforma-
tion (Fig. 70a). In both cases a given volume element becomes distorted into ﬁner and ﬁner
ﬁlaments that eventually cover the whole phase space uniformly. But, the rate at which volume
elements become stretched need not be exponential (as in the examples quoted above), i. e., a
system that shows mixing need not be a K-system. These examples show that the properties
in Table 13 indeed characterize increasingly chaotic motion.
We have also indicated in this table that the hierarchy of classical chaos is mirrored by
the spectrum of eigenvalues of the Liouville operator. Let us brieﬂy explain this fundamen-
tal relation which allows a characterization of classical chaos without considering individual
trajectories.
The Liouville operator L determines the time evolution of the density ρ(⃗p, ⃗q) in phase
space:

(8.44)
Here we used Hamiltons’s equations, and (8.43) deﬁnes L. It is useful to introduce the eigen-
values λ of L via
e−iLϕ(⃗x) = eiλϕ(⃗x) ;
⃗x = (⃗p, ⃗q)
(8.45)
where ϕ(⃗x) is a complex, square integrable function in phase space. According to Table 13,
different degrees of classical chaos correspond to different spectra of λ (the arrows indicate
the direction of the statement). We explain this correspondence by two examples and refer to
the cited literature for the general proofs.

8.2
Strongly Irregular Motion and Ergodicity
179
First we consider two uncoupled harmonic oscillators whose Hamiltonian reads in action-
angle variables:
Hosc = ω1J1 +ω2J2
(8.46)
where ω1, ω2 are the oscillator frequencies. Equations (8.43–8.45) then become

(8.47)
e−iLoscϕ(θ,

(8.48)
where ϕ is periodic in the angles θ1 and θ2. These equations have the obvious solutions
ϕ(θ1, θ2) ∝e2πi(n1θ1+n2θ2)
(8.49)
→λ = 2π(n1θ1 +n2θ2)
(8.50)
where n1 and n2 are integers.
The motion of the two oscillators on the torus (see Fig. 128) is only ergodic if ω1/ω2 is
irrational, i. e., λ ∝n1ω1 +n2ω2 = 0 only for n1 = n2 = 0, and λ = 0 is a simple eigenvalue.
For nonergodic motion ω1/ω2 =rational, and λ = 0 is degenerate. It is quite plausible that
ergodicity and a nondegenerate eigenvalue λ = 0 correspond to each other because only then
the equation for the time invariant density ρ,
e−iLρ = ρ
(8.51)
has a unique solution. Equation (8.44) can be extended to maps⃗xn+1 = ⃗G(xn) by
e−iLϕ(⃗x) ≡ϕ[⃗G−1(⃗x)] = eiλϕ(⃗x) .
(8.52)
As a further example, we consider the cat map (8.35) which acts on a torus so that we can
expand ϕ as
ϕ(⃗x) = ∑
⃗m
e2πi⃗m·⃗x ˜ϕ(⃗m)
(8.53)
where ⃗m = (m1, m2); m1, m2 integers. Using the fact that the transformation matrix T is
symmetric, we obtain from (8.52–8.53) after straightforward manipulations
˜ϕ(T⃗m) = eiλ ˜ϕ(⃗m) .
(8.54)
The point m = 0 yields the only ﬁxed point in (8.54), i. e., λ = 0 is again a simple eigenvalue
that corresponds to a constant invariant density. The action of T on the other ⃗m-values is
explained in Fig. 147. If we relabel the ms according to their hyperbolas (α) and their place
on it (j), i. e., ⃗m ˆ=(α, j), then eq. (7.54) can be written as
e−iL ˜ϕ(α, j) ≡˜ϕ(α, j +1) = eiλ ˜ϕ(α, j)
(8.55)
i. e., e−iL is a translation operator in the variable j. The corresponding spectrum of L is
continuous (note that the js are not limited) and denumerably inﬁnite degenerate (via the α’s).
A spectrum λ, which contains every real number with the same multiplicity and for which the
spectral weight is just dλ, is called the Lebesque spectrum. The cat map is an example for a
K-system. These systems have (also in general) Lebesque spectra with denumerably inﬁnite
multiplicity.

8.2.3
Three Classical K-Systems
Let us now present some physical examples of K-systems that exhibit ergodic and mixing
behavior.
First, we consider the famous hard-sphere ﬂuid whose mixing was rigorously established
by Sinai (1970). Because of the inﬁnite contact potential, this is clearly not a perturbation
to a simple system (e. g., of noninteracting particles). Figure 148 a shows how exponential
separation of the trajectories results from collisions between the spheres’ convex surfaces. It
is worth emphasizing that Sinai’s proof is valid for two discs moving on a torus, i. e., it does
not require the thermodynamic limit of inﬁnitely many particles.

a stadium, c) a free particle on a surface with negative curvature.

8.2
Strongly Irregular Motion and Ergodicity
181
Another system, which has only a few degrees of freedom, but which nevertheless exhibits
ergodicity and mixing, is a free particle in a stadium, as shown in Fig. 148b. The exponential
separation of trajectories is generated by the particular form of the boundary (Bunimovich,
1979).
Finally, we mention that the geodesic motion of a mass point on a compact surface with
overall negative Gaussian curvature is also mixing and ergodic (Anosov, 1969). It can be
already seen from the saddle-shaped surface in Fig. 148c (which has a negative curvature at
one point P) how nearby trajectories separate along geodesics.

9 Chaos in Quantum Systems?
The existence of chaotic motion in classical conservative systems naturally leads to the ques-
tion of how this irregularity manifests itself in the corresponding quantum systems. In a
broader context, one might inquire about the nature of the solutions to the wave equations
that arise, e. g., in plasma physics, optics, or acoustics, whose ray trajectories (WKB solution,
geometric optics) are stochastic.
The question about the behavior of quantum systems whose classical limit exhibits chaos
has been posed since the early days of quantum mechanics (Einstein, 1917) because it raises
the problem of how to quantize a system which executes nonperiodic motion (at that time, pe-
riodic system were quantized via the Bohr–Sommerfeld quantization rule
H p dq = nh, where
h is Planck’s constant). Since the discovery and the establishment of wave mechanics, we
know how to proceed if we wish to learn about the time evolution of any quantum system:
solve the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation
ˆHΨ = −h
i
∂
∂t Ψ
(9.1)
where ˆH is the Hamiltonian of the system, Ψ is its wave function, and ¯h = h/2π. In order to
develop some intuition for the changes which will arise if we pass from a classically chaotic
system to its quantum mechanical version, we recall several major differences between clas-
sical and quantum systems:
– In contrast to classical mechanics (where a statistical description is only necessary if the
system becomes chaotic in time), quantum mechanics allows only statistical predictions.
Although the Schr¨odinger equation is linear in Ψ and can, e. g., be solved exactly for
a harmonic oscillator with the result that Ψ depends regularly on time (i. e., there is no
chaotic time behavior), this does not mean that the motion is completely deterministic,
since |Ψ(⃗x, t)|2 is only the probability density to ﬁnd an electron at a space-time point
(⃗x, t).
– Because of Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle
∆p∆q > ¯h/2
(9.2)
there are no trajectories in quantum mechanics [if one measures q with precision ∆q, one
disturbs the momentum p by ∆p according to (9.2)]. Therefore, the characterization of
chaos based on the exponentially fast separation of nearby trajectories becomes useless
for quantum systems.
– The uncertainty principle (9.2) implies also that points in 2n-dimensional phase space
within a volume ¯hn cannot be distinguished, i. e., the phase space becomes coarse grained.
This means that regions in phase space in which the motion is classically chaotic (see

Chaos in Quantum Systems?
Fig. 140), but which have volumes smaller than ¯hn, are not “seen” in quantum mechanics;
and for the corresponding quantum system, we expect a regular behavior in time. Thus
the ﬁnite value of Planck’s constant tends to suppress chaos. On the other hand, the limit
h →0 becomes difﬁcult (for quantum systems which have a classical counterpart which
displays chaos) because if h becomes smaller, more and more irregular structures will
appear.
In the following, we distinguish between (time-independent) stationary Hamiltonians and
time-dependent Hamiltonians, which appear, for example, in the quantum version of the
kicked rotator.
For systems with stationary Hamiltonians ˆH, the Schr¨odinger equation (9.1) can be re-
duced [with Ψ = Ψ0 exp(−iEt/¯h)] to a linear eigenvalue problem for the energy levels E:
ˆHΨ0 = EΨ0 .
(9.3)
As long as the levels are discrete, Ψ behaves regularly in time and there is no chaos. But, there
remain the fundamental questions: under what circumstances will this be the case and are there
still differences between the energy spectra of a quantum system with a regular classical limit
and a quantum system whose classical version displays chaos?
Information about the behavior of systems with time-dependent Hamiltonians are, for ex-
ample, relevant for the problem of how energy is distributed in the energy ladder of a molecule
excited by a laser beam, i. e., they are related to the practical problem of laser photochemistry.
More speciﬁcally, the answers to the following questions are sought: Does quantum chaos
exist? How can one characterize it? Is there an equivalent to the hierarchy shown in Table 13
in quantum mechanics? What happens to the KAM-theorem for quantized motion, etc.? Up
to now there are more questions than answers.
To get at least some insight into these problems, we consider several model systems. In
Section 9.1 we investigate the quantized version of the cat map (whose classical motion is
purely chaotic) and show that it displays no chaos because the ﬁnite value of Planck’s constant,
together with the doubly periodic boundary conditions, restrict the eigenvalues of the time-
evolution operator to a discrete set, such that the motion becomes completely periodic.
In the subsequent section we describe a calculation by McDonald and Kaufmann (1979),
which shows that the energy spectrum of a free quantum particle in a stadium (for which the
classical motion is chaotic) differs drastically from that of a free (quantum) particle in a circle
(for which the classical motion is regular).
Finally, in the last section we demonstrate (by mapping the system to an electron lo-
calization problem) that a kicked quantum rotator shows no diffusion, whereas its classical
counterpart displays deterministic diffusion above a certain threshold.
9.1
The Quantum Cat Map
To see how a conservative system, which classically behaves completely chaotically, changes
its behavior for nonzero values of Planck’s constant, we quantize a modiﬁcation of Arnold’s
cat map. (The familiar cat map (8.35) cannot be quantized because the corresponding time-
evolution operator does not preserve the periodicity of the wave function of the torus, see
Hannay and Berry, 1980.)

9.1
The Quantum Cat Map
185
Figure 149: Allowed phase points for the quantized version of a cat map (schematic).
Let us recall that the allowed phase space of a classical cat map is the unit torus. In this
example, the phase points develop according to the dynamical law

.
(9.4)
In quantum mechanics, eq. (9.4) becomes the Heisenberg equation of motion for the coordi-
nate and momentum operators ˆqn, ˆpn at time n, and the restriction of the classical phase space
to a torus implies periodic boundary conditions for the quantum-mechanical wave function in
coordinate and momentum space. In other words, the eigenvalues of both operators ˆp and ˆq
only have discrete values which cover the torus by a lattice of allowed phase points, as shown
in Fig. 149.
We will now show that the unit cell of this lattice is a square with a lattice constant, which
is just Planck’s quantum of the action h.
If the eigenvalues of ˆq have a spacing ∆q = 1
N i. e.,
q = 0, 1
N , ... 1
where
N = integer
(9.5)
this implies (via the double periodicity of the wave function) the maximum momentum eigen-
value
pmax = ¯h2π/
 1
N

= Nh
(9.6)
and a spacing ∆p = h, i. e., the eigenvalues of ˆp are
p = 0, h, 2h, ..., Nh .
(9.7)
Because the allowed phase space has unit area, we have
1 = qmaxpmax = Nh
(9.8)
i. e.,
h = 1
N →∆p = ∆q = h .
(9.9)
This requirement makes the quantum version of the cat map somewhat unrealistic. But if we
assume for a moment that Planck’s constant h is a free parameter and the quantum case is
only deﬁned by h ̸= 0 such that eq. (9.9) makes sense, then it follows from (9.5) and (9.7) that

186

Chaos in Quantum Systems?
in quantum mechanics only phase points with a rational ratio p/q are allowed. This means
that the points with irrational ratios, which were the only ones in the classical cat maps which
lead to chaotic trajectories, are forbidden in quantum mechanics. It is therefore reasonable to
expect that the quantum version of the cat map will not exhibit chaos.
It has indeed been found by Hannay and Berry (1980) that the time-evolution operator ˆU
for the quantum cat map is periodic (i. e., for every N there exists an n(N) such that ˆUn = 1)
and has a discrete spectrum of eigenvalues. This implies that all expectation values for the cat
map are periodic in time. In other words, the ﬁnite values of Planck’s constant and the doubly
periodic boundary conditions restrict the eigenvalues (of the time-evolution operator) in the
quantum version of Arnold’s cat map such that chaotic motion becomes impossible.
9.2
A Quantum Particle in a Stadium
Although we have seen in the previous section that a quantum system with a chaotic classical
limit does not necessarily also behave chaotically, one nevertheless expects some difference
between a quantum system having a classical counterpart, which shows irregular motion, and
a quantum version of an integrable classical system having regular trajectories. To cast some
light on this problem, McDonald and Kaufmann (1979) calculated numerically the wave func-
tions and spectra of a free particle in a stadium and in a circular disc by solving the Schr¨odinger
equation for a free particle in two dimensions
⃗∇2ψ = Eψ
(9.10)
with the boundary condition ψ(x, y) = 0 at the “walls”.
Their results are summarized in Fig. 150:
1. The eigenfunctions of the stadium problem show irregular nodal curves (where ψ(x, y) =
0) in contrast to the regular curves for the circle.
2. The distribution N(∆E) of the eigenvalue spacings DeltaE for the circle shows a max-
imum at ∆E = 0, i. e., there is a high probability of level degeneracies, and one ﬁnds
level clustering. It has been proved by Berry and Tabor (1977) that for integrable sys-
tems N(∆E) ∝exp(−∆E · const). (An exception is a quantum mechanical oscillator for
which N(∆E) is a delta function at ∆E = ¯hω0.) For the stadium N(∆E) has a maximum
at ∆E ̸= 0, i. e., there is level repulsion.
This level repulsion has also been found for the quantum version of Sinai’s billiard (Berry,
1983, Bohigas et al., 1984), and it seems to be a characteristic feature of a quantum sys-
tem, whose classical limit shows chaos. It is related to the fact that no symmetries exist in
these systems, i. e., there are no degeneracies (and no selection rules which prevent mutual
interaction of the levels) such that lim∆E→0 N(∆E) = 0. Several theoretical explanations for
this phenomenon have been offered, and an interesting connection to random matrix theory
(which is used to explain level repulsion in nuclear spectra) has been suggested (Zaslavski,
1981, Berry, 1983, Bohigas et al., 1984). Note that the distribution of level spacings is re-
lated to the eigenvalue spectrum of the quantum version of the Liouville operator ˆL because
ˆL|n >∝⟨m| ∝[ ˆH, |n⟩⟨m|] = (En −Em)|n⟩⟨m|, where ˆH is the Hamiltonian, and |n⟩, |m⟩are its
eigenfunctions.

9.3
The Kicked Quantum Rotator
We have already seen in Chapter 3 that deterministic diffusion serves as an indicator of chaos.
It is, therefore, interesting to see whether this phenomenon also exists in quantum systems.
(If the answer is yes, then we know that there is chaos in the quantum system). We show ﬁrst
that a classical kicked rotator, without damping, displays (for strong enough kicking forces)
deterministic diffusion, and subsequently investigate its quantum version.
According to eq. (2.26), the equations of motion for the angle θ and the angular momentum
p of a classical kicked rotator are
pn+1 = pn −V ′(θn)
n = 0, 1, 2 ...
(9.11a)

iterating eq. (8.11) and plotting successive points. a) For K = 0.96 different orbits in the shaded regions
are still separated. b) For K = 1.13 the islands overlap and the angular momentum can diffuse. (After
Chirikov, 1979.)
θn+1 = θn + pn+1 = θn −V ′(θn)+ pn
(9.11b)
where V(θ) = V(θ+2π) is the potential function of the kicking force.

(9.12)
where ⟨...⟩denotes the average over all initial points θ0. If the correlations between the V ′(θi)
are short-ranged (with range n0), eq. (9.12) becomes
⟨(pn+1 −p0)2⟩= n

∑

⟨V ′(θj)V ′(θ0)⟩∝n

(9.13)
i. e., the angular momentum of the kicked rotator diffuses.
It has, for example, been found numerically that a kicking potential of the form V(θ) =
K ·cosθ generates deterministic diffusion (of the angular momentum) above a threshold Kc ≃
0.972 (see Fig. 151).
Another example is the “open cat map” in which the restriction of periodicity of the pn
is lifted. This can be viewed as a kicked rotator with a potential function V(θ) = −(K/2) ·
(θmod2π)2 and has the equations of motion
pn+1
=
pn +Kθn
(9.14a)
θn+1
=
θn(1+K)+ pn
(9.14b)
where θn is always modulo 2π. Including the modulo restriction, eq. (9.14b) appears (apart
from pn, which does not seriously disturb our argument, and after division by 2π, which
changes mod2π to mod 1) similar to the map (3.1) that produced the Bernoulli shift. This
means that for K > 0, eq. (9.14b) generates chaotic motion of the angles which leads via
(9.12) to deterministic diffusion.

9.3
The Kicked Quantum Rotator
189
We now show that the quantum version of the kicked rotator does not diffuse. Instead, one
ﬁnds either quantum resonance, i. e., the square of the angular momentum increases quadrat-
ically in time, or almost periodicity, thus the angular momentum is limited and recurs repeat-
edly arbitrarily close to its original value.
To understand this result, we use the idea of Fishman, Grempel, and Prange (1982) and
map the kicked quantum rotator into a one-dimensional electron localization problem (about
which several results are known). [The following derivation is due to V. Emery (private com-
munication).] The time-dependent Hamiltonian of a kicked rotator can be written as
ˆH =

with
ˆT = −τ ∂2
∂θ2
(9.15)
where we have ignored the kinetic energy ˆT during the delta kick which corresponds to the
limit y →1 in (9.15).
The time-evolution operator from time t = n to time t = n+1, i. e., before and after one
kick, therefore becomes
ˆU = e−iˆT e−i ˆV
(9.16)
and its eigenstates |ψλ⟩are determined by
ˆU|ψλ⟩= e−iλ|ψλ⟩
(9.17)
where λ is the eigenvalue. This equation governs the time dependence of any state |ϕ⟩that
develops with ˆU, because
|ϕ(n)⟩= ˆUn|ϕ⟩= ∑
λ
e−inλcλ|ψλ⟩;
cλ = ⟨ψλ|ϕ⟩.
(9.18)
We rewrite (9.17) now in the form of a Schr¨odinger equation for an electron in a one-dimen-
sional random chain. By using the explicit expression (9.16) for ˆU, (9.17) reads
e−iˆT e−i ˆV|ψλ⟩= e−iλ|ψλ⟩
(9.19)
which for ˆE ≡λˆ1−ˆT becomes
e−iˆE e−i ˆV|ψλ⟩= |ψλ⟩.

With |ψλ⟩≡ei( ˆV/2|ω⟩this can be rewritten as:

Equation (9.26) is the Schr¨odinger equation for an electron on a chain with on-site potentials
Tm and hopping matrix elements Wr. The integer eigenvalues m of the angular momentum of
the kicked rotator correspond to the lattice sites in the conduction problem. Two cases must
be distinguished:
a) For rational values of τ/(2π) = p/q, where p and q are both mutually prime integers,
the electrons described by (9.26) move freely in a periodic potential and are completely
delocalized. For the rotator problem this means that its angular momentum is unbounded
in time, i. e., all eigenvalues m can be achieved. In fact the square of the angular momen-
tum increases quadratically in time (see Fig. 152). This phenomenon is termed quantum
resonance and occurs for all rational values of τ/(2π). We will explain this phenomenon

for the simplest case p/q = 1. The effect of the time-evolution operator on any periodic
wave function ψ then becomes
ˆU|ψ⟩ˆ=e2πi(∂2/∂θ2) e−iV(θ)ψ(θ) = e−iV(θ)ψ(θ)
(9.27)
since we can expand e−iV in a Fourier series:

(9.30)
This quadratic increase in time is clearly a quantum effect because (9.27) holds only for
integer values of m, i. e., for a quantized angular momentum.
b) Next we consider the case where τ/(2π) is irrational. The potential Tm = tan[(λ−m2τ)/2]
then becomes random instead of periodic because [(λ −m2τ)/2]modπ behaves like a
random number generator. (Note that tanx is periodic with period π and its argument can,
after division by π, be written as xm = [λ/(2π)−m2τ/(π)]mod1. If τ/(2π) is expressed
in binary representation and one considers, for example, values m2 = 2n, then it is seen
that the xm=2n are generated by a Bernoulli shift from a irrational number and are, hence,
truly random.)
Intuitively, one expects that an electron in a one-dimensional random potential has a strong
tendency to localize since there is (in contrast to higher dimensions) only one way to move
from one point to the next, and this could be easily blocked by a potential barrier. It is in fact
well known from the work of Anderson (1958) and Ishii (1973) (but by no means trivial to
prove) that all electrons in a one-dimensional random potential are localized (for short-ranged
hopping matrix elements). The physical reason for this is that, in the one-dimensional case,
the random potential changes the phase of the wave function at every site, and this random
dephasing eventually leads to localization.
The electron is, therefore, conﬁned to a ﬁnite range of ms, i. e., the angular momentum
of the rotator is bounded and does not increase in time; in other words, there is no diffusion
of momentum in contrast to the classical case. Figure 153 shows the time dependence of the
energy of a periodically kicked rotator, numerically calculated for an irrational value of τ/2π.
It can be seen that the oscillations in energy are not only bounded but recur many times.

Chaos in Quantum Systems?
Figure 153: Numerical result for the expectation value of the energy E ∝⟨p2⟩(of a kicked quantum rota-
tor) as a function of the number n of pulses for an irrational value of τ/(2π) (after Hogg and Hubermann,
1982).
It has been proved by Hogg and Hubermann (1982) that if the wave function can be nor-
malized (i. e., if we know that the angular momentum does not diffuse) then both the wave
function and the energy return arbitrarily close to their initial values arbitrarily often. This
time dependence is called almost periodic in contrast to the quasiperiodic motion mentioned
in Chapter 7. (For almost periodic functions f(t) there exists a relatively dense set {τε} such
that |f(t +τε)−f(t)| < ε for any ε > 0. {τε} is relatively dense if there exists a Tε such that
each interval of length Tε on the real axis contains at least one τε.)
We have seen, above, that up to now no quantum system seems to exist which exhibits
deterministic chaos (indicated either by a continuous power spectrum or deterministic diffu-
sion). Nevertheless, there is a difference in the behavior of quantum systems with a chaotic
classical counterpart and those (quantum systems) with a regular classical limit.
Let us ﬁnally mention an interesting calculation of Gutzwiller (1983) for an electron which
is scattered from a non-compact surface with negative curvature. It shows that the phase shift
as a function of momentum is essentially given by the phase angles of the Riemann zeta
function on the imaginary axis, at a distance 0.5 from the famous critical line. This phase shift
displays features of chaos because it is able to mimic any given smooth function. It, therefore,
seems that the chaotic nature of quantum systems which are described by wave mechanics is
of a rather subtle and “softer” kind than the chaos in classical mechanics.
These comments indicate that the question of stochasticity in quantum mechanics is still
far from being solved.

10 Controlling Chaos
Around 1950, the famous mathematician and father of the computer John v. Neumann had
already remarked (cited after Dyson, 1988) that dynamical systems can be divided into two
classes: stable systems whose behavior can be predicted by computers, and unstable systems
which display a sensitive dependence on initial conditions and therefore can be easily stabi-
lized and controlled by computers. He proposed the control of local weather by distributing
chemicals from airplanes. Therefore the idea of controlling chaotic systems by small time-
dependent perturbations is not completely new.
In 1987 the space agency NASA (Farquhar et al., 1985) made use of the sensitive de-
pendence on initial conditions in the classical three-body problem to manœvre a space-craft
towards a comet by means of small corrections which required only a small amount of fuel
(see Fig. 154). This would never have been possible for a non-chaotic system where one needs
large forces to bring the space-craft into a new orbit.
Figure 154: The trajectory of the space-ship ISEE 3 (International Sun Earth Explorer 3) was changed
in order to leave the earth–moon system in the direction of the comet Giacobini–Zinner. On October 10,
1983, the velocity of the space-ship was changed by the tiny amount of 6.5 m s−1. By exploiting the
gravitation of the moon in a clever fashion, this small change was sufﬁcient to send the space-ship in the
direction of the comet (after Farquhar et al., 1985).

Controlling Chaos
Then in 1990 the seminal article of Ott, Grebogi and Yorke was puslished in which they
demonstrated that small time-dependent changes in the control parameter of a system can
change the chaotic motion on the strange attractor into periodic motion.
The chaotic motion on a strange attractor can be viewed as a dance of the trajectory be-
tween different unstable periodic orbits. This can easily be seen when we recall the period-
doubling route. In this route, cycles of different lengths become unstable one after the other
if the control parameter r is increased. At the culmination point r∞one has an inﬁnitely long
cycle, and in the chaotic regime r > r∞the trajectory moves between unstable cycles (see
Fig. 155). During this movement the trajectories become repelled from the cycles; otherwise
the motion would again be periodic (see Appendix H).
10.1
Stabilization of Unstable Orbits
In 1990 Grebogi, Ott and Yorke showed that small variations in the control parameter can
change unstable cycles into stable cycles in such a way that the chaotic trajectory becomes
periodic.
In the following we will demonstrate this for the simple example of the logistic map.
Figure 156 shows that the ﬁxed point x∗becomes unstable for r > r∞because |f ′(x∗)| > 1.
This means that a starting point x0 will move away from x∗(see Fig. 156 a). But if we change
the parameter r for a moment by an amount δr, in such a way that the parabola is shifted
upwards, we could choose δr such that x0 falls after one iteration onto the unstable ﬁxed point
x∗(Fig. 156b). Since we also have, for an unstable ﬁxed point, the equation x∗= f(x∗), the
trajectory remains located on x∗if we put δr = 0. Therefore, the system becomes trapped on
an unstable ﬁxed point and shows no longer any chaos.
Figure 155: The period doubling route generates unstable periodic orbits (schematically).

10.1
Stabilization of Unstable Orbits
195
Figure 156: Stabilization of a ﬁxed point by a change in the control parameter. (a) The ﬁxed point x∗of
the logistic map at r = 3.78 is unstable, and the trajectory which starts at x0 becomes repelled from it.
(b) Small changes in the control parameter r lead to the dotted map, which drives x0, after the next time
step, back to the ﬁxed point.
To compute the change in the control parameter that is needed to stabilize the ﬁxed point,
we linearize the map fr(x) in the vicinity of x∗. With δxt = xt −x∗one obtains:
xt+1
=
fr(xt) = fr(x∗+xt −x∗∗)
=
fr(x∗)+ f ′
r(x∗)δxt +O((δxt)2) .
(10.1)
By changing r →r +δrt we get an additional term
xt+1 = fr(x∗)+ f ′
r(x∗)δxt + ∂f
∂r (x∗)δrt ,
(10.2)
and we have neglected contributions of order (δxt)2, (δrt)2 and δxtδrt.
With fr(x∗) = x∗we can write equation (10.2) as
δxt+1 = f ′
r(x∗)δxt + ∂f
∂r (x∗)δrt .
(10.3)
Since we require that the system ends up at time t +1 on the unstable ﬁxed point x∗, this means
δxt+1 = 0, we obtain according to eq. (10.3)
δrt = −f ′
r(x∗)
∂f
∂r (x∗)
δxt .
(10.4)
This means that, to stabilize the ﬁxed point, the change in the control parameter must be
proportional to the distance δxt between the ﬁxed point and the trajectory. The change in the
control parameter becomes small if the initial distance between the trajectory and the ﬁxed
point, i. e., (x∗−x0) is small. This condition can always be fulﬁlled: Since the motion of the
trajectory on the strange attractor is ergodic, the trajectory in the course of time approaches
every unstable ﬁxed point arbitrarily closely. Therefore, one has to wait until the trajectory
comes very close to x∗. A change in control parameter δrt ∝δxt which is needed to stabilize

196
10
Controlling Chaos
the ﬁxed point can then be made arbitrarily small. The whole procedure recalls somehow the
Japanese art of self-defense where one uses the motion of the opponent in a clever way to send
him to the ﬂoor with a tiny twist.
To ﬂoor the chaotic motion on a strange attractor onto a ﬁxed point we have to do the
following:
1. Localize the ﬁxed point.
2. Wait until the trajectory comes close to the ﬁxed point (this can take some time).
3. Change the control parameter in proportion to the distance between the trajectory and the
ﬁxed point.
We can already see at this stage that one has some freedom in the choice of the proportion-
ality factor ε between δrt and δxt, which has in eq. (10.4) the form ε = −f ′
r(x∗)/(∂f(x∗)/∂r).
With δrt = εδxt, eq. (10.3) becomes
δxt+1 = (f ′
r(x∗)+ε)δxt .
(10.5)
If we require only that the system becomes attracted to the ﬁxed point after a long time,
i. e., limt→∞δxt →0, any ε which ensures
|f ′(x∗)+ε| < 1
(10.6)
will do (see eq. (3.17) on page 24). This means that one has for ﬁxed f ′(x∗) a whole range
of ε values for which the system converges to the ﬁxed point (Schuster et al., 1996), cf.
Fig. 157. Since one needs only very little information about the nonlinear system to stabilize
a ﬁxed point it becomes understandable that this type of chaos control has been performed
successfully in many experimental systems (Shinbrot et al., 1993). One has only to wait
until the trajectory comes into the vicinity of a ﬁxed point and then switch on the change in
the control parameter which is proportional to the distance between the ﬁxed point and the
trajectory. Figure 158 shows how this procedure works for a Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction
(introduced on page 11), whose nonlinear dynamics can be reduced to a one-dimensional map.
The ideas which have been outlined for a ﬁxed point in the previous paragraph can be
generalized in a straightforward fashion to longer unstable cycles. For example, if we want
to stabilize a cycle of period 2 for the logistic map, we have only to replace f(x) by f 2(x) in
eq. (10.1) and linearize around one of the two ﬁxed points f 2(x∗
1,2) = x∗
1,2. Everything runs
through as for a simple ﬁxed point, one must only check that the control parameter is switched
on in even time steps in order to stabilize the correct ﬁxed point x∗
1 or x∗
2.
The ideas described so far are quite well known to engineers and applied mathematicians,
as these concepts are at the heart of control theory (Chen, 1999; Slotine and Li, 1991). In fact,
quite elaborate approaches have been developed but, from the point of view of applications,
most ideas are conﬁned to the linearized regime as, e. g., sketched above. It is the essentially
new idea of chaos control that the nonlinear dynamical system provides a huge number of
unstable periodic orbits. Each of them can be stabilized with tiny control forces. In the wake
of these observations control of chaos became one of the most popular branches in applied
nonlinear science. Meanwhile reviews are available in the literature (Schuster, 1999). Here
we focus on a more detailed description of two quite popular and important control schemes.

The OGY Method

on if |x∗−x| < 10−2 for ε = 2. (a) Normal bifurcation diagram (compare with Fig. 36 on page 53),
(b) bifurcation diagram when the time-dependent parameter change has been switched on.
10.2
The OGY Method
For higher-dimensional maps one has only to stabilize the unstable directions (which are given
by the eigenvectors of the local Jacobi matrix which belong to eigenvalues with modulus > 1).
Thus the number of parameters needed to adjust the phase space point properly are given by
the dimension of the unstable manifold. Figure 159 shows how the trajectory is driven onto a
stable manifold by a small change in the control parameter. Once it is on the stable manifold,
no more changes in the control parameter are needed and the trajectory is pulled onto the ﬁxed
point.

been obtained by reconstructing phase space via time delay from the measured potential of a bromide
electrode (the potential is proportional to the concentration of BrO−
3 , see also page 11, after Petrov et
al., 1993).

stable manifold on which Zn+1 becomes attracted to the ﬁxed point (after Shinbrot et al., 1993).

10.3
Time-Delayed Feedback Control
199
This method for controlling chaos has been applied to many systems, especially to lasers,
hydrodynamic systems and coupled cardiac cells (compare Table 2 on page 10). Since chaotic
systems contain an inﬁnite number of periodic orbits, they offer the possibility to stabilize
completely different types of dynamical behavior. If one wants to stabilize a technical system
it would therefore be advantageous to drive it into the chaotic region in order to control it with
tiny variations in the control parameter. To perform this control it is not necessary to know the
equation of motion of the system in explicit form. It is sufﬁcient to know the location of the
ﬁxed points and the local Jacobian. This information could be extracted from measured data,
for example, by the method of delay coordinates (see Chapter 6, eq. (6.44) and Shinbrot et
al., 1993; Hubinger, Doerner and Martienssen, 1993). Since one just needs to obtain the local
phase-space structure in a neighborhood of the unstable orbit, the requirements concerning
the amount of data are less severe than for the global reconstruction of the whole attractor.
10.3
Time-Delayed Feedback Control
As pointed out in the preceding sections, control is achieved by a suitable time-dependent
change in a system parameter r →r +δrt. With an appropriate choice of δrt the target state,
e. g., an unstable ﬁxed point x∗, becomes stable. The simple scheme introduced at the be-
ginning of this chapter, δrt = xt −x∗, requires the a priori knowledge of the target state x∗.
Following an idea of Pyragas (1992) one may obtain a crude estimate by replacing the un-
known ﬁxed point by a previous iterate, i. e., by deriving the control force from a time-delayed
difference δrt = K(xt −xt−1) = K(δxt −δxt−1). It is often convenient to introduce a linear am-
pliﬁcation factor K as well. In order to ﬁgure out whether such a simple control scheme works
one considers the motion in a neighborhood of the target state. Using eq. (10.3) the dynamics
is governed by the higher order difference equation
δxt+1 = f ′
r(x∗)δxt + ∂f
∂r (x∗)K(δxt −δxt−1) .
(10.7)
As usual the time evolution follows the typical exponential law δxt = γtδx0 where the so-called
Floquet multiplier γ obeys
γ2 =

f ′
r(x∗)+K ∂f

γ−K ∂f
∂r (x∗) .
(10.8)
Stabilization is achieved for those values of K where eq. (10.8) yields only solutions with
modulus lower than one, |γ| < 1.
Conditions for successful control may be either derived from the explicit solution for γ or
through conditions which do not require the computation of the roots of eq. (10.8) (the Schur–
Cohn–Jury criterion). Finally we obtain three constraints for the stability of the controlled
ﬁxed point

Figure 160: Successive iterates in the neighborhood of the unstable ﬁxed point for negative (left) and
positive (right) Floquet multiplier. The size of the time-delayed difference xt −xt−1 from which the
control force is derived is also indicated.
Condition (10.9a) does not involve the control amplitude K. It just poses a constraint on
the unstable ﬁxed point. Since unstable ﬁxed points obey |f ′
r(x∗)| > 1 we recognize that
only unstable orbits with negative Floquet multipliers, i. e., f ′
r(x∗) < −1, are accessible for
time-delayed feedback control. Such a constraint has a simple geometric meaning. When
f ′
r(x∗) < −1 the dynamics oscillates in a neighborhood of the ﬁxed point. Actually such a
type of motion is generated in period-doubling bifurcations (cf. Fig. 155). The control force is
derived from a time-delayed difference xt −xt−1. To keep this force ﬁnite when stabilization
sets in, one needs a ﬁnite difference between successive iterates as otherwise the control force
will vanish. Thus, as sketched in Fig. 160, the oscillatory part of the motion is required. Only
target states with oscillating dynamics, i. e., with negative (or complex) Floquet multipliers
are accessible for time-delayed feedback control.
Conditions (10.9b) and (10.9c) yield constraints for the control amplitude.
In fact,
eq. (10.9c) tells us that control fails for large values of the ampliﬁcation K.
In view of
eq. (10.9a) it is quite straightforward to work out that conditions (10.9b) and (10.9c) yield
a ﬁnite interval of K values for successful control provided f ′
r(x∗) > −3. No such control
interval is obtained if f ′
r(x∗) < −3. Thus time-delayed feedback control fails for strongly
unstable orbits.
10.3.1
Rhythmic Control
The original Pyragas scheme suffers from the constraint that only orbits with oscillating dy-
namics in their neighborhood, i. e., complex Floquet exponents, are accessible. To overcome
such a severe limitation, modiﬁcations have been proposed which essentially result in an effec-
tive enlargement of the phase space (Schuster and Stemmler, 1997). A simple implementation
consists of a time-dependent modulation of the control amplitude. Consider a period-two
modulation of the control amplitude, i. e., K takes the value K0 on even time steps and K1 on
odd time steps. Then condition (10.7) determining the stability reads
δx2t+1
=
f ′
r(x∗)δx2t + ∂f

=
f ′
r(x∗)δx2t+1 + ∂f
∂r (x∗)K1(δx2t+1 −δx2t) .
(10.10b)
Since the time evolution at even and odd time steps is governed by different control ampli-
tudes, one effectively ends up with a higher-dimensional dynamics, eqs. (10.10). With the
usual exponential law, δx2t = γ2tδx0, δx2t+1 = γ2t+1δx1 one obtains for the multiplier γ the

Now, even in the case f ′
r(x∗) > 1, i. e., without oscillating motion in the vicinity of the target
state, these three conditions can be satisﬁed thanks to the second factor in eq. (10.13a) (cf.
eq. (10.9a). One just takes an appropriate negative value for, say, K1∂f/∂r and chooses K0
so small that the condition (10.13c) is still valid. For instance the choice K0 = 0, K1∂f/∂r ≲
−(1+ f ′
r) works nicely.
Apart from rhythmic control there exist alternatives to increase the effective phase space
dimension and to stabilize orbits with positive Floquet multipliers, e. g., by directly adding
unstable degrees of freedom to the control loop (Pyragas, 2001).
10.3.2
Extended Time-Delayed Feedback Control
To overcome the second limitation of the original Pyragas scheme mentioned above, namely
the inability to stabilize strongly unstable periodic orbits, an extended version of time-delayed
feedback control has been proposed (Socolar et al., 1994) using multiple time delay. Within
the framework of the previous paragraphs such an approach amounts to a parameter modula-
tion according to
δrt = K
∞
∑
τ=0
Rτ(xt−τ −xt−τ−1) = K(xt −xt−1)+Rδrt−1 .
(10.14)
Here the ﬁlter parameter R, |R| < 1, determines how sensitively the control depends on the
history of time-delayed differences. Using δxt = γtδx0 and δrt = γtδr0 stability is determined
through the condition [cf. eqs. (10.3) and (10.14)]

Thanks to the factor 1 −R in condition (10.16b), stabilization can be achieved even if the
orbit is strongly unstable, f ′
r(x∗) < −3, by taking positive values for the ﬁlter parameter. Fig-
ure 161 shows the typical triangular shape of the control domain in the K-R control parameter
space. Even when the original Pyragas scheme R = 0 fails to produce a ﬁnite control interval,
successful stabilization can be achieved by choosing positive values for the ﬁlter parameter.
10.3.3
Experimental Realization of Time-Delayed Feedback Control
While the OGY scheme requires some data processing like, e. g., determination of the periodic
target state, analysis of invariant manifolds, or the construction of a Poincar´e cross-section
time-delayed feedback control can be implemented with less effort. One just needs to measure
a signal s(t) and modulate one of the accessible systems parameters, e. g., the amplitude of a
driving ﬁeld, according to the time-delayed difference, s(t)−s(t −τ). A typical experimental
setup is sketched in Fig. 162. In order to keep the scheme non-invasive, the delay time τ is
chosen to be an integer multiple of the period of the target state (cf., e. g., Kittel et al., 1995
for suitable schemes to adapt the delay time properly). But one has to pay a price, namely that
no a priori estimate is available as to whether the control will work and what the appropriate
parameter values could be.
As pointed out in the previous paragraphs, the simple time-delayed feedback scheme suf-
fers from constraints, in particular:
1. Torsion in the phase space is a necessary condition for the control to work, i. e., only
orbits with complex Floquet exponents are accessible for time-delayed feedback control.
2. Orbits with a large Liapunov exponents, i. e., strongly unstable orbits, cannot be stabi-
lized by the Pyragas scheme.

feedback device is displayed in grey. The control force is derived from a time-delayed difference and a
linear ampliﬁcation, K[s(t)−s(t −τ)]. The force is used to modulate a system parameter.
These constraints are not conﬁned to simple one-dimensional maps but apply to the general
case as well and thus constitute a universal feature of time-delayed feedback control (Just et
al., 2003). Fortunately, one may overcome these limitations either by rhythmic control, i. e.,
periodic modulation of the control amplitude and by extended control schemes employing
multiple delays. One should mention that for the implementation of the latter scheme no
additional delay device is required.
Since time-delayed feedback schemes are extremely simple to implement they have been
successfully applied in quite diverse experimental contexts, e. g., in laser systems (Bielawski
et al., 1994), discharge gas tubes (Pierre et al., 1996), Taylor–Couette ﬂows (L¨uthje, 2001),
electrochemical reactions (Parmananda et al., 1999) , high-power ferromagnetic resonance
experiments (Benner and Just, 2002), and even for arrhythmic cardiac control (Hall et al.,
1997). Rhythmic control has been employed in a laser experiment (Bielawski et al., 1993).
The success of extended time-delayed feedback has been demonstrated in fast diode resonator
experiments (Gauthier et al., 1994).
10.4
Parametric Resonance from Unstable Periodic Orbits
The very existence of unstable periodic orbits in chaotic systems leads to resonances, from
which one can determine the location of the cycles on the attractor and their local stability
(Schuster et al., 1996).
Figure 163 shows the lifetime τ of a trajectory of the logistic map within the interval x0 ±δ
(where x0 is a freely chosen point on the attractor) for the case when the control parameter r
has been modulated as δrt = ε(xt −x0). The inverse lifetime τ−1 displays as a function for ε
a minimum, this means that the lifetime of the most stable unstable cycle, which has a point
within the interval x0 ±δ, diverges.
In order to understand this phenomenon we compute as an example the lifetime of the
unstable ﬁxed point x∗of the logistic map as a function of ε. The linearized equation of
motion (10.3) becomes, with γ = ∂f
∂x (x∗)+ε ∂f
∂r (x∗):
δxt = γδxt−1 = γtδx0 .

x∗+ δ (x∗= 0.6, δ = 0.03) as a function of the control parameter ε. For 2.32 ≤ε ≤2.76 an unstable
cycle with period 4 becomes stabilized. The dotted line shows τ−1 for the same parameter values for
the case when white noise with amplitude 10−2 has been added to the logistic map, i. e., the observed
resonance phenomenon is stable against noise (Schuster et al., 1996).
The lifetime τ is determined by the requirement that the trajectory leaves the interval at x0 ±δ,
i. e.,
δxτ = γτδx0 = δ .

The lifetime τ diverges in the interval ε−≤ε ≤ε+, where
ε± = [f ′(x∗

Since ε± can be measured, one can compute via eq. (10.20) the unknown ∂f

∂r (x∗),
i. e., the local Liapunov exponents λ(x∗) = log

Parametric resonances of unstable periodic orbits can also be observed for higher-
dimensional maps. As an example we consider the H´enon map
xt+1 = r +0.3yt −(xt)2
(10.21a)
yt+1 = xt ,
(10.21b)
whose control parameter is modulated as δrt = ε1(x∗−xt)+ε2(y∗−yt) (where x∗= y∗is the
ﬁxed point of the H´enon map [10.21 a–b)].

plane of control parameters for δ = 10−3, −2.5 ≤ε1 ≤2.5 and −1 ≤ε2 ≤5. Within the white triangle,
τ becomes inﬁnite, and the ﬁxed point becomes completely stabilized. The white line is determined by
those (ε1, ε2)-values for which τ remains unchanged (Schuster et al., 1996).
Figure 164 shows the region in parameter space (⃗ε-space), where the lifetime of the stabi-
lized ﬁxed point diverges (white region). Outside of this region τ becomes gradually smaller
(grey shades). The white line in Fig. 164 characterizes the ε1, ε2-values, for which τ does not
change. From the corners of the white triangle one can again determine the local instability
rates of the ﬁxed point (Schuster et al., 1996). This leads to the conclusion that parametric
resonance in chaotic systems allows for a new means of attractor spectroscopy, whereby one
can determine the location length and stability of unstable periodic orbits on a strange attractor
by measuring the lifetime of the cycle (e. g., via the power spectrum or the invariant density)
as a function of the parametric feedback parameter ε.

11 Synchronization of Chaotic Systems
Synchronization is a common phenomenon in nature, e. g., in coupled nonlinear oscillator
systems. The ﬁrst empirical report dates back to the seventeenth century where Christiaan
Huygens observed that clocks hanging from the same wooden rod tend to synchronize their
motion. An excellent recent review of various synchronization phenomena is contained in the
book of Pikovsky et al. (1993). Here we address particular synchronization phenomena for
coupled chaotic systems. Systems with symmetric coupling show a novel type of intermit-
tency as a precursor of the synchronization whereby one has to distinguish between weak and
strong synchronization. In addition, these models emphasize that a proper notion of a chaotic
attractor might be quite subtle. Apart from complete synchronization notions like generalized
and phase synchronization are also discussed. In particular, we will demonstrate that certain
unidirectionally coupled models display strange nonchaotic motion.
11.1
Identical Systems with Symmetric Coupling
In 1985 Fujisaka and Yamada discovered an unusual type of intermittent behavior when two
identical chaotic systems are coupled. This observation gives rise to phenomena which are
nowadays called on–off intermittency and blowout bifurcation. In addition, it illustrates why
the concept of a chaotic attractor might be quite subtle.
For pedagogical purpose let us consider a simple model (Pikovsky and Grassberger, 1991;
Glendinning, 2001) consisting of two one-dimensional maps coupled in symmetric way
xn+1
=
(1−ε)f(xn)+εf(yn)
(11.1a)
yn+1
=
(1−ε)f(yn)+εf(xn) .
(11.1b)
Here ε denotes the coupling constant. For the map f we take a skewed tent map (cf. eq. (6.89)
and Fig. 165)
f(x) =

ax
if
0 ≤x ≤1/a
a(1−x)/(a−1)
if
1/a < x ≤1
(11.2)
with slope 1 < a < 2. The coupled system (11.1) admits a chaotic synchronized solution
xn = yn ≡zn, where the dynamics of the synchronized state is given by the map (11.2), zn+1 =
f(zn). In the two-dimensional x–y plane the synchronized state is conﬁned to the diagonal. It
is natural to ask for which values of the coupling strength ε the synchronized state is stable.

The stability of the synchronized state is investigated by observing transverse ﬂuctuations
through the variable ∆n = yn −xn. Using xn = zn −∆n/2 and yn = zn + ∆/2 where the mean
zn = (xn +yn)/2 describes the motion on the synchronized manifold we obtain in linear order
from eq. (11.1)
∆n+1 = (1−2ε)f ′(zn)∆n .
(11.3)
Thus the transverse coordinate obeys
∆n = (1−2ε)n
n−1
∏
k=0
f ′(zk)∆0 .
(11.4)
If we take the deﬁnition of the Liapunov exponent of the map f into account [cf. eq. (3.9)] we
obtain an exponential growth for the product in eq. (11.4) if a typical orbit of the synchronized
state is considered

Thus, the modulus of the transverse ﬂuctuation obeys

(11.6)
Fluctuations decay if the coupling exceeds a threshold value
ε > εbo = (1−exp(−λ))/2 .

For the simple piecewise linear model, the Liapunov exponent can be calculated quite easily
since the corresponding invariant density is constant, ρ(x) = 1 (cf. Section 3.2)

11.1.1
On–Off Intermittency
If the coupling falls short of the critical value εbo, the synchronized state xn = yn becomes
unstable and a characteristic intermittent dynamics is observed. Figure 166 shows the dy-
namics close to the threshold. While for ε > εbo the motion settles on the diagonal, i. e., on
the synchronized state, one observes a blow-up of the attractor when the coupling crosses the

critical value (left in Fig. 166). This type of transition is called, for obvious reason, a blow-
out bifurcation. In the supercritical regime, i. e., just below the transition point, intermittent
motion of ∆n is observed (right in Fig. 166). This type of intermittency is quite different from
the classical scenarios introduced in Chapter 5. Laminar phases |∆n| ≪1 are interrupted by
chaotic bursts |∆n| ∼1, and the temporal series shows a spiky characteristic. This type of in-
termittency has been termed on–off intermittency. Its statistical properties have been studied
in detail (Yamada and Fujisaka, 1986). The main mechanism causing intermittency is already
visible in eq. (11.3) which governs the dynamics of the transverse dynamics. While on av-
erage the factor |f ′(zk)| is larger than one (for ε < εbo) its chaotic ﬂuctuations determine the
distribution and correlations of the transverse coordinate ∆n. The basic intermittency mech-
anism comes from the competition between the trajectory instability of chaotic elements and
the synchronization tendency due to the diffusion-type coupling.
In particular, Heagy et al. (1994) have investigated the statistical properties of the length ℓ
of the laminar phases. In view of eq. (11.4) the length of a laminar phase is determined by the
condition |∏ℓ−1
k=0 f ′(zk)| ∼1. Reformulating this condition as an exit-time problem, a scaling
law for the distribution of laminar phases has been obtained
P(ℓ) ≃ℓ−3/2 exp(−αℓ)
(11.9)
where the exponential cutoff scales linearly with the coupling strength α ∼1 −ε/εbo. Close
to the blow-out bifurcation one observes a power law with exponent 3/2.
11.1.2
Strong vs. Weak Synchronization
On–off intermittency and blow-out bifurcations are closely linked phenomena and are both
caused by the peculiar stability properties of the synchronized state. Actually the crucial
relation (11.5) is valid for typical orbits only. For instance, its is quite simple to check that
the “nontrivial” synchronized ﬁxed point x = y = a/(2a −1) is transversally stable for ε >
ε+ = (1 −exp(−λ+))/2 [cf. eq. (11.7)] while the trivial synchronized ﬁxed point is stable if
ε > ε−= (1−exp(−λ−))/2 where λ± just denotes the stability exponent of the corresponding

ﬁxed point. Since λ−< λ < λ+ holds, the former ﬁxed point is unstable throughout the blow-
out transition, while the latter ﬁxed point is transversally stable. Similar arguments apply to
all the other unstable periodic states. Roughly speaking, synchronization sets in when the
majority of synchronized periodic states becomes transversally stable leaving a minority (i. e.,
a set of measure zero) transversally unstable, as sketched in Fig. 167. The values ε± mark the
limiting values where all synchronized orbits become stable or unstable, respectively. Thus
one refers to these thresholds sometimes as the onset of strong synchronization or strong
desynchronization, respectively, while the onset of synchronization according to the condition
(11.7) is called weak synchronization.
In the regime of weak synchronization, ε > εbo, there are still (inﬁnitely many) initial
conditions which are arbitrarily close to the synchronized state, but which do not converge
towards this stable solution (Glendinning, 2001). These initial conditions are just related to
those unstable orbits which are still transversally unstable. Thus when dealing with chaotic
dynamics, the notion of an attractor becomes quite subtle. In addition, the just mentioned
mechanism can cause basins of a particularly wired shape, so-called riddled basins (Ott et al.,
1994). Such basins do not contain any open disk, i. e., if one considers any point in the basin
then arbitrarily close there are points which do not belong to the basin.
All the features which we have reported in this section for the simple model (11.1) have a
quite generic character. Thus it is not surprising that topics in synchronization recently became
one of the most active branches in nonlinear dynamics.
11.2
Master–Slave Conﬁgurations
Despite the fact that chaotic systems display sensitive dependence on the initial condition,
synchronization can be achieved without great effort. A particularly simple demonstration
of this feature can be achieved in the so-called master–slave conﬁguration where a systems
output, the drive, drives an identical copy, the response system (Pecora and Carroll, 1990).
The setup is easily demonstrated by considering, e. g., a two-dimensional map as the driving

(11.10b)
The output yn of the second equation is used to drive an identical copy of eq. (11.10b)
ξn+1 = f(ξn,yn) .
(11.11)
The question arises whether the response system (11.11) synchronizes with the drive,
eq. (11.10), i. e., whether ξn tends towards xn, even if the drive shows chaotic motion. The
problem is easily addressed by considering the Liapunov exponent of the response. In linear
order one obtains for the difference δxn = xn −ξn between the master and the slave from
eqs. 11.10) and (11.11)
δxn+1 = ∂f(xn,yn)
∂xn
δxn .
(11.12)
The deviation obeys as usual an exponential law, δxn ∼exp(λ⊥n), where the so-called condi-
tional Liapunov exponent of the response system is determined by [cf. eq. (3.9)]

(11.13)
Synchronization occurs if λ⊥is negative.
There is in general no simple relation between the quantity (11.13) and the Liapunov
exponents of the master system (11.10). Synchronization may occur even if the dynamics of
the drive system is chaotic. For the purpose of illustration let us consider as a trivial example
the dissipative baker’s transformation [cf. eq. (6.7)]
xn+1

f(xn,yn) =

0 ≤yn < 1/2

(11.14a)
yn+1
=
g(xn,yn) = 2yn mod 1
(11.14b)
where 0 < a < 1. For the response system we take the x-subsystem eq. (11.11). Since the
derivative ∂f(x,y)/∂x = a is constant one obtains from eq. (11.12) for the conditional Lia-
punov exponent λ⊥= ln|a| < 0. Thus synchronization works successfully, ξn →xn, despite
the chaotic dynamics of the drive. This simple example shows clearly the underlying mecha-
nism. Because of the special choice of the response system, the dynamics of ξ is essentially
governed by the stable manifold, i. e., by the contraction of the baker’s transformation (cf.
Fig. 70, recall that the coordinate axis have been interchanged in the present example). The
expanding part of the master’s motion, i. e., those directions corresponding to the positive Li-
apunov exponent, are entirely contained in the output used for driving the response system.
In fact, using the y-system as a response system does not result in synchronization, as can be
checked easily. In general master–slave conﬁgurations the situation might be more involved
since drive and response systems do not decompose nicely in terms of stable and unstable
directions. But the essential mechanism for synchronization is the same as in this simple ex-
ample. Master–slave conﬁgurations and the corresponding synchronization features have been
proposed as a method for secure communication (Cuomo and Oppenheim, 1993).

Synchronization of Chaotic Systems
11.3
Generalized Synchronization
So far we have considered synchronization where coordinates of the different subsystems
coincide, e. g., xn = ξn in the previous setup. This type of behavior can only be expected when
identical copies of the subsystems are involved. Already a the use of different physical units in
the drive and the response systems will prohibit the just-mentioned complete synchronization
in a strict sense. Thus the notion of generalized synchronization has been introduced (Rulkov
et al., 1995) which can even cope with nonidentical subsystems. For the purpose of illustration
consider a drive system given in terms of a map f, which drives a different response system
xn+1
=
f(xn)
(11.15a)
yn+1
=
g(xn,yn) .
(11.15b)
Generalized synchronization between the systems (11.15a) and (11.15b) is said to prevail if
there is a functional relation between both variables, x and y, i. e., yn = h(xn) holds for all times
and some function h. Unlike for the case of complete synchronization, the function entering
this relation is in general not the identity h(x) = x. The concept of generalized synchronization
is indeed quite general. Our setup just states that the dynamics of the unidirectionally coupled
system (11.15) settles onto a smaller set given by the condition y = h(x). Provided the syn-
chronization manifold y = h(x) is known, the stability of the synchronized state is again given
in terms of the appropriate conditional Liapunov exponent [cf. eq. (11.13)].
11.3.1
Strange Nonchaotic Attractors
A very important example of generalized synchronization, which by the way demonstrates the
ﬂexibility of this notion, is given in terms of quasiperiodically forced systems. Such systems
can be described in terms of appropriate Poincar´e maps. A prototype is the quasiperiodically
forced logistic equation (cf. Prasad et al., 1998)
xn+1
=
xn +ω mod 1
(11.16a)
yn+1
=
a−y2
n +εcos(2πxn) .
(11.16b)
Here the variable x, with trivial dynamics, describes the drive and the variable y the response
system. Quasiperiodic forcing is expressed by the choice that the frequency ω is irrational
(cf. Section 7.2). Obviously the model (11.16) ﬁts in the general scheme (11.15). Figure 168
shows the attractor of the mapping (11.16) for small and large coupling ε while the parameter
value a corresponds to nonchaotic behavior of the logistic map. In both cases generalized
synchronization is observed, y = h(x). While for small coupling (Fig. 168 a) the function
y = h(x) results in a “smooth” dependence a much more intricate behavior is observed for
larger coupling strength (Fig. 168 b). Actually the dependence results in a fractal function
where the graph has a nontrivial Hausdorff dimension. The dynamics on this type of strange
attractor is however still nonchaotic since the Liapunov exponents are nonpositive, as can be
already inspected from the value of the parameter a. Such behavior, which is quite typical
for quasiperiodically force systems, has been termed strange nonchaotic motion (Grebogi et
al., 1984). Observations of such strange nonchaotic attractors have been reported in different
types of experiment (Ditto et al., 1990, Ding et al., 1997)

Phase Synchronization of Chaotic Systems
For the investigation of synchronization phenomena in oscillatory systems, the notion of a
phase variable plays a crucial role. While the phase is well deﬁned in regular, nonchaotic
systems (cf. the action-angle variables introduced in Section 8.1) the concept requires some
additional comments for chaotic motion. As a paradigm for a chaotic oscillator let us consider
the R¨ossler model

of parameter values, chaotic behavior is observed. Phase-space plots and the time evolution is

Synchronization of Chaotic Systems
As a characteristic feature the solutions display oscillatory behavior but with time-
dependent and chaotic amplitudes.
Inspecting the x–y projection of the phase-space plot
(Fig. 169 a) several deﬁnitions of a chaotic phase seem to be promising (Pikovsky et al.,
2001). One may, e. g., take the corresponding angle in the phase plane, tanθ = y/x, where
of course the angle is lifted by 2π each time a revolution is completed. As an alternative
deﬁnition we may use the recurrence time with respect to a Poincar´e surface of section and
interpolate the phase continuously between successive hits. Finally a very elegant and univer-
sal way of introducing a phase is based on the Hilbert transform of a real-valued signal s(t),
say a component of the R¨ossler model (11.17). One constructs from the real-valued signal a
complex process ζ(t) according to
ζ(t) = A(t)exp(iφ(t))

(11.18)
where the last integral denotes the principal value. Thus converting the real-valued signal
into a complex number, the complex phase φ(t) is taken to be the phase of the signal s(t).
Deﬁnition (11.18) is motivated by the observation that it just generalizes the notion of the
phase for a purely periodic signal. Considering, e. g., a harmonic signal s(t) = acos(ωt +ϕ).
Then by contour integration we have

where C± denotes the contour in the complex plane consisting of the real axis and the semi-
circle (with inﬁnite radius) in the upper/lower half-plane. Thus eq. (11.18) yields, for the
complex phase, the usual result φ(t) = ωt + ϕ. Altogether, eq. (11.18) generalizes the phase
to cases where the amplitudes are ﬂuctuating, e. g., chaotically. But one should keep in mind
that these deﬁnitions require a signal with nice oscillatory features such as those displayed in
Fig. 169.
The just-mentioned three deﬁnitions of the phase are not identical but qualitatively similar.
In fact, the ﬁne structure of the phase is not really relevant. On may instead concentrate on the
mean frequency (or the winding number, cf. Section 7.2)

Such a characteristic is independent of the particular deﬁnition of the phase and may serve as
a quantiﬁer for the chaotic oscillatory motion. Mean frequencies are useful to characterize the
phase synchronization of chaotic oscillators. A nice demonstrative example is given by two
nonidentical coupled R¨ossler models (Pikovsky et al., 2001)

where ε denotes the coupling parameter and ν takes a parameter mismatch into account, re-
sulting in a frequency mismatch of the uncoupled model. The analysis of coupled oscillator
systems suggests (cf. Section 7.3) that, for ﬁnite coupling, a synchronized regime exists, i. e.,
that the mean frequencies of the two subsystems become identical, Ω1 = Ω2. Indeed such
a transition is observed for ﬁnite coupling strength (cf. Fig. 170 a). The nature of such a
phase synchronization transition can be easily understood when looking at the corresponding
Liapunov spectrum, Fig. 170 b. For weak coupling two positive Liapunov exponents exist,
corresponding to the chaotic ﬂuctuations of each amplitude. In addition two zero exponents
are visible, reﬂecting the phase dynamics of each chaotic oscillator. These exponents are
just caused by the two Goldstone modes of the uncoupled model. When the critical coupling
strength is crossed, the two independent phases are locked and only one Goldstone mode
survives, turning the second vanishing Liapunov exponent negative.
Apart from the just-mentioned 1:1 resonance higher order resonances may take place as
well. The interaction between the heart beat and the respiration cycles provides a nice experi-
mental demonstration of such a feature (see Pikovsky et al., 2001 for details).

12 Spatiotemporal Chaos
While there is nowadays a quite concise description of chaos in systems with few degrees
of freedom, the problem of adequate approaches for complex dynamics in high-dimensional
chaotic systems is still unsolved. For each experimental problem one may of course tailor ap-
propriate tools, but a concise pattern is still missing. We are trying to describe some common
features, concerning model systems, characteristic quantities, and paradigmatic experiments.
But our presentation is selective and far from being exhaustive. Even after 20 years of devel-
opment in Nonlinear Dynamics, a comprehensive presentation of spatiotemporal chaos has to
be postponed to the future.
12.1
Models for Space–Time Chaos
Within a physical description of dynamical systems, time is a continuous variable. The spatial
degree of freedom is either discrete or continuous depending on whether one deals with lat-
tice dynamics or an effective hydrodynamic description in terms of continuous ﬁelds. Thus,
depending on the properties of the variables, one may introduce the classiﬁcation of dynami-
cal systems shown in Table 14 where, in addition, we have taken time discrete dynamics into
account. In each case one ends up with a different model class, either partial differential equa-
tions, systems of coupled differential equations, or coupled map lattices. For each class we
will discuss typical examples which have proven to be fruitful for investigating spatiotemporal
complex dynamics. But our discussion is far from being exhaustive and just focuses on some
selected features.
12.1.1
Coupled Map Lattices
As demonstrated in the previous chapters, time discrete dynamical systems, i. e., maps, have
proven to be fruitful for understanding features of low-dimensional dynamical systems. In
order to investigate fundamental aspects of the interaction between local chaotic motion and
spatial coupling, models of coupled maps have been proposed (cf. Kaneko, 1993, or Chazottes

where 0 ≤ν ≤L−1 denotes the lattice sites, n the discrete time, f(x) the single site map, and
ε the coupling constant. The coupling derives from a spatially discrete Laplace operator. But
one should not overestimate such an argument since no meaningful continuum limit exists.
Although no derivation of such models from ﬁrst principles is available, coupled map lattices
have proven to be useful for modelling quite diverse dynamical phenomena (cf., e. g., Kaneko,
1989, for a detailed numerical study of coupled logistic maps or Yanagita and Kaneko, 1995,
for the modelling of a hydrodynamical problem). Thus, coupled map lattices are a testing
ground for approaches in studying spatiotemporal chaos mainly because the effort for numer-
ical simulations even on large lattices is quite small. Apart from plain numerical approaches
coupled map lattices are among those few spatially extended systems where even analytical
approaches in the space–time chaotic regime can be applied. Such studies mainly rely on sym-
bolic dynamics along the lines of Section 3.1 and link dynamical systems with models from
statistical mechanics, such as probabilistic cellular automata (Gielis and MacKay, 2000).
12.1.2
Coupled Oscillator Models
Systems of coupled differential equations, e. g., a lattice of nonlinear oscillators, are in partic-
ular used for testing hypothesis of extended nonlinear systems by numerical means. Following
an idea of Kuramoto (1984) one may concentrate on fundamental aspects by emphasizing the
general structure of such models. Assuming that the individual oscillators are described in
terms of a phase variable, one ends up with a kind of minimal model
˙φν(t) = ων −
N−1
∑
µ=0
Jνµ sin(φν(t)−φµ(t))
(12.2)
where φν denotes the 2π-periodic phase of the oscillator at lattice site ν, ων its free frequency,
and Jνµ the spatial coupling. The trigonometric coupling function takes the periodicity into
account. Models of this type may be derived from general arguments and thus possess some
degree of universality.
If one considers the simplest case of global coupling, Jνµ = J/N, J > 0 then even analyt-
ical solutions are available in the limit of large system size N →∞. The essential idea uses
arguments borrowed from traditional mean-ﬁeld theories. Introducing a complex valued order
parameter
Z = Rexp(iΨ) = 1

the coupled system (12.2) is written as an effective one-oscillator model

(12.4)
which can be integrated without great effort. Actually just two types of solutions are possible.
If |ων| < JR then the phase locks onto a ﬁxed point, while for |ων| > JR a continuous rotation

prevails. The actual value of the order parameter may be worked out self-consistently. As
on average the rotating solutions do not contribute to eq. (12.3), only the oscillators locking
on the ﬁxed points will determine Z for large system size N. Let us, e. g., assume that the
frequencies ων are distributed according to a symmetric single humped distribution g(ω) =
limN→∞∑ν δ(ω −ων)/N. If we recall that the stable ﬁxed point of eq. (12.4) obeys sin(φµ −

(12.5)
There are two different solutions of this self-consistency condition. If the coupling J is small
then only the trivial solution R = 0 exists, meaning that all oscillators rotate incoherently.
When the coupling exceeds a critical value J > Jc = 2/(πg(0)) then it is quite straightforward
to check that a nontrivial solution R > 0 is born. Thus there appears a transition towards a
partially synchronized state where a fraction of oscillators rotate coherently. The scenario is
similar to the synchronization phenomena described in Chapter 11.
The two different phases can be distinguished on the basis of their Liapunov exponents,
too.
Since the Kuramoto model essentially boils down to a single oscillator dynamics,
eq. (12.4) the Liapunov exponents can even be computed analytically in the limit of large N
(Radons, 2004). Within the partially synchronized state, the negative Liapunov exponents re-
ﬂect the dynamics of the synchronized oscillators, while the vanishing exponents correspond
to the nonsynchronized part of the system, cf. Fig. 171.
Generalizations of the approach, e. g., for other distributions of the frequencies and to
some extent even for nonglobal coupling, are available in the literature. But already the sim-
ple model described above shows rather subtle features if stability properties of the partially
synchronized phase are addressed (Strogatz, 2001). Above all, the observed phenomenon dis-
plays a phase-transition-like characteristic, in particular, since the limit of large system size is
involved.

Spatiotemporal Chaos
12.1.3
Complex Ginzburg–Landau Equation
The dynamics of complex patterns close to stability thresholds leads to features which can be
described by universal equations of motion. A particularly important example is the complex
Ginzburg–Landau equation (cf. Aranson and Kramer, 2002, for a recent review). In one spatial
dimension it takes the form, using dimensionless variables
∂A
∂t = A+(1+ib)∂2A
∂x2 −(1+ic)|A|2A .
(12.6)
Here the complex ﬁeld A(x,t) describes amplitude and phase modulations of an underlying
regular structure close to some stability threshold. The two real-valued parameters b and c
characterize the linear and nonlinear dispersion.
When starting from physical equations of motion, e. g., a reaction diffusion equation de-
scribing a concentration ﬁeld c(x,t) an effective description in terms of the complex Ginzburg–
Landau equation can be obtained when a regular structure, e. g., a plane wave becomes un-
stable. The pattern in the neighborhood of the stability threshold is described by a modulated
structure
c(x,t) = A(x,t)exp(iωt +ikx)+c.c.
(12.7)
where the space–time dependence of the amplitude A is slow with respect to the underlying
regular structure. The amplitude equation (12.6) is derived by a formal perturbation scheme
(cf. Cross and Hohenberg, 1993). Its structure is essentially determined by symmetries of
the underlying dynamics. In that respect, equations like eq. (12.6) yield a quite universal
description of spatiotemporal dynamics close to instability thresholds. These concepts are the
generalizations of bifurcation analysis to spatially extended systems.
The dynamics of the complex Ginzburg–Landau equation is highly nontrivial. While the
investigation of different regular stationary and periodic structures can still be done by analyti-
cal tools, one relies on numerical simulations for studying spatiotemporal chaotic states. There
are at least two qualitatively different chaotic regimes. Whenever the amplitude A vanishes
a defect occurs since the complex phase is not well deﬁned at such a point. Thus, dynamics
without defects can be described only in terms of the phase variable [cf. eq. (12.8)]. Chaotic
motion of the phase without defects is called phase turbulence, whereas defect chaos is gener-
ated by chaotic motion of point defects of a pattern. Occurrence and stability of the different
states depends of course on the choice of the two parameters b and c.
12.1.4
Kuramoto–Sivashinsky Equation
Phase turbulent dynamics can be described in terms of a the local phase φ(x,t) or the local
wave vector u(x,t) = ∂φ/∂x, which is just the spatial derivative of the phase. According to
Kuramoto and Tsuzuki (1976) an appropriate equation of motion can be derived from the
Ginzburg–Landau equation. In terms of dimensionless variables it reads
∂u
∂t = −∂2u
∂x2 −∂4u
∂x4 +u(x,t)∂u
∂x .
(12.8)
Equation (12.8) contains no parameter, apart from the system size. Thus it may be considered
as a kind of universal model for space–time chaos. The spatiotemporal chaotic motion which

one obtains
˙uk = (k2 −k4)uk −i∑

(12.10)
This equation of motion contains linear contributions which are governed by the dispersion
relation λk = k2 −k4 and a coupling of Fourier modes stemming from the nonlinear part. De-
composition in terms of Fourier modes usually does not help to compute the solution. But on
that level one may understand qualitatively the mechanism for the generation of spatiotempo-
ral chaos. The linear contribution tends to amplify Fourier amplitudes in the large-wavelength
regime, k < 1, while modes with small wavelengths, k > 1 are damped. If only the nonlin-
ear part of the equation of motion were present then it is quite straightforward to check that
the total “energy”
R L
0 |u(x,t)|2dx/L = ∑k |uk|2 would be preserved. Thus the nonlinear part
just redistributes the “energies” of the modes, |uk|2. Such a mechanism is dominant in the
so-called “inertial range”, which is the wavenumber regime between the “dissipation range”
k ≫1 and the “integral range” k ≪1. Thus the whole dynamics may be viewed as an energy
transfer process from large to small scales while, on average, the individual energies ⟨|uk|2⟩
develop a k-dependence which is determined by the linear dispersion. Such arguments which
are summarized in Fig. 172 are at the heart of a phenomenological explanation of turbulence.
12.2
Characterization of Space–Time Chaos
Traditional characterization of spatiotemporal dynamics relies to some extent on spatiotem-
poral correlation functions and Fourier spectra. Different types of correlation function may
be introduced, depending on the space–time pattern under consideration (cf. e. g., Eckmann
and Ruelle, 1985, and Cross and Hohenberg, 1993). In addition quantities like dimensions,

222

Spatiotemporal Chaos
entropies, and Liapunov exponents which have been discussed in Sections 6.2 and 6.3 can
be applied as well. A formulation in terms of corresponding densities is more suitable when
extensive properties are considered. There is still no generally accepted characterization of
space–time chaos available. Here we focus on the question of how the concept of Liapunov
exponents can be generalized to take the particular aspect of spatial extension into account.
Similar ideas may be applied to other characteristic quantities as well.
12.2.1
Liapunov Spectrum
Liapunov exponents quantify the sensitivity of the motion with respect to changes of the initial
condition. When considering a spatially extended system, i. e., a system with many degrees
of freedom, then many exponents exist which measure the sensitivity with respect to different
modes. To be deﬁnite, when considering a coupled map lattice, eq. (12.1), then the equation of
motion for small disturbances δx(ν)

Exponential growth of these perturbations determines the different Liapunov exponents λσ,
0 ≤σ ≤L−1. When considering the limit of large lattices L →∞then these exponents behave
like intensive quantities and are described in terms of a smooth spectrum ℓ(ρ), 0 ≤ρ ≤1
λσ = ℓ(σ/L),
0 ≤σ ≤L−1 .
(12.12)
Such Liapunov spectra are cumbersome to compute because of the time-dependent ﬂuc-
tuations, f ′ 

, appearing in eq. (12.11). But some of the essential features can already be
observed when considering the trivial example of generalized Bernoulli maps
f(x) = rx mod 1,
r > 1 .
(12.13)
Then the derivatives in eq. (12.11) are time independent and the solution for the perturbations
may be written in terms of plane waves
δx(ν)
n
= exp(λσn)exp(ikσν)
(12.14)
where the wavenumbers due to periodic boundary conditions obey kσ = 2πσ/L. The different
Liapunov exponents are obtained from eq. (12.11)
exp(λσ) = (1−ε)r +εrcos(kσ) .
(12.15)
Strictly speaking, such an expression is only correct if ε ≤1/2, since Liapunov exponents are
by deﬁnition real-valued. For larger values of the coupling, the modulus of the right-hand side
of eq. (12.11) has to be considered. Finally, the Liapunov spectrum according to eq. (12.12)
reads
ℓ(ρ) = lnr +ln|1−ε+εcos(2πρ/L)| .
(12.16)
Equation (12.14) tells us that a plane wave is related with each Liapunov exponent. Such
Liapunov modes describe the spatial pattern associated with the corresponding growth rate.
In general Liapunov modes are far more complicated and even their deﬁnition allows for some
degree of ambiguity.

12.2.2
Co-moving Liapunov Exponent
Propagation of signals is one of the ubiquitous features of spatially extended systems. Within
a spatiotemporal chaotic system, this property has been studied, e. g., by observing how lo-
calized structures of the initial condition propagate in the course of time. Figure 173 shows a
simple example generated from a coupled map lattice. The difference of two patterns, which
are obtained from two initial conditions differing at one lattice site only, is displayed. The
propagation of the error at a ﬁnite speed is clearly visible.
In order to quantify the propagation of disturbances, a velocity-dependent Liapunov ex-
ponent has been proposed by Deissler and Kaneko (1987). This exponent measures the ex-
ponential growth of perturbations in a co-moving reference frame. Starting from a localized
disturbance at one lattice site, say ν, δx(ν)
0
= δν,0 the exponential growth is observed in a
moving reference frame through the law
|δx(ν)
n | ≃exp(Λ(v)n)
(12.17)
where the reference velocity v = ν/n determines the relative scaling between position ν and
time n. By deﬁnition Λ(v = 0) coincides with the maximal Liapunov exponent of the sys-
tem, while Λ(v) > 0 indicates that perturbations with velocity v tend to propagate. Thus the
maximal propagation speed obeys Λ(v) = 0.
While a numerical evaluation of this idea is fairly straightforward, a direct analytical com-
putation is quite difﬁcult even for the simple model of coupled Bernoulli maps. Although
an analytical solution for Λ(v) is still available we refer to the next paragraph for a simpler
but indirect determination of the co-moving Liapunov exponent. Figure 174 summarizes the
result. As expected, the maximal propagation speed increases when the coupling strength is
increased. Because of the diffusive coupling, eq. (12.1), speeds are limited to the range v ≤1.

12.2.3
Chronotopic Liapunov Analysis
Fronts, propagating in a chaotic medium as displayed in Fig. 173, may have an exponentially
decaying spatial proﬁle. This property is already implicitly assumed in the deﬁnition of the
co-moving Liapunov exponent, eq. (12.17), when keeping the scaling n = ν/v in mind. Thus
propagation of signals may be analyzed from the very beginning by taking this proﬁle into
account (Politi and Torcini, 1992). Using the ansatz
δx(ν)
n

(12.18)
the equation of motion (12.11) reads

(12.19)
When analyzing the temporal evolution of eq. (12.19), we have essentially changed the bound-
ary conditions which originally apply to δx(ν)
n
but which are now imposed on the new variables
δz(ν)
n . It is, in fact, this change which is the whole clue to the analysis.
Equation (12.19) describes the propagation of a spatially exponential proﬁle where the
decay rate γ of the proﬁle enters explicitly as a parameter. As in the previous sections we
may just compute the largest Liapunov exponent L(γ) of the equation of motion (12.19). It
depends, of course, on the shape of the proﬁle, i. e., on γ.
For the purpose of illustration we again resort to the case of coupled Bernoulli maps,
eq. (12.13). As in the previous case the exponential growth rate is computed straightforwardly
from eq. (12.19) using δz(ν)
n
= exp(L(γ)n), since the time-dependent derivatives turn out to be
constant, f ′(x(ν)
n ) = r
exp(L(γ)) = (1−ε)r +εrcosh(γ) .
(12.20)
For γ = 0 we obtain of course the largest Liapunov exponent, λσ=0 [cf. eq. (12.15)].

12.3
Nonlinear Nonequilibrium Space–Time Dynamics
225
The growth rate L(γ) and the co-moving Liapunov exponent Λ(v) are related through a
Legendre transformation. If we evaluate the deﬁnition (12.17) of the co-moving Liapunov
exponent for a neighboring lattice site ν+∆ν, we have
δx(ν+∆ν)
n
≃exp[Λ(v+∆ν/n)n] ≃exp[Λ(v)n+Λ′(v)∆ν]
(12.21)
where a Taylor series expansion has been employed. Thus the front has a spatial proﬁle with
exponential decay rate
γ = Λ′(v) .
(12.22)
On the other hand, eq. (12.18) in connection with the exponent L(γ) tells us that
δx(ν)
n
≃exp(γν)exp[L(γ)n] = exp([γv+L(γ)]n)
(12.23)
where we used the scaling in terms of the front velocity, v = ν/n. Hence, comparison with the
deﬁnition (12.17) of the co-moving Liapunov exponent yields
Λ(v) = γv+L(γ) .
(12.24)
Equations (12.22) and (12.24) constitute a Legendre transformation. Using the inverse trans-
formation L′(γ) = −v it is, in principle, straightforward to compute explicitly the co-moving
Liapunov exponent of the coupled Bernoulli maps from eq. (12.20)
One may develop a whole consistent theory for spatiotemporal exponents following the
ideas presented in this paragraph. Such an approach is sometimes called chronotopic analysis
(Lepri et al., 1997). To some extent it is based on the same formal concepts which we have
already described in Section 6.3 in the context of the multifractal analysis.
12.3
Nonlinear Nonequilibrium Space–Time Dynamics
Although high-dimensional chaotic behavior still poses one of the major challenges for Non-
linear Dynamics, it is quite well established that the understanding of spatiotemporal chaotic
motion is at the heart of several physical phenomena. We brieﬂy describe here three illus-
trative examples, mainly from nonequilibrium physics, where application of such concepts is
potentially fruitful and experimentally relevant.
12.3.1
Fully Developed Turbulence
Hydrodynamic turbulence is the classical example of nonlinear complex dynamics. In its
simplest form the underlying physical equations of motion, i. e., the Navier–Stokes equation
and the continuity equation for a simple, incompressible, viscous ﬂuid, are nonlinear partial
differential equations for the velocity ﬁeld ⃗u(⃗r,t). Written in dimensionless units the free
parameter, apart from the geometry of the boundary conditions and the driving force, is given
by the Reynolds number Re = LU/ν. Here L denotes the lateral extension of the system, e. g.,
the tube diameter, U the order of magnitude of the velocity ﬁeld, e. g., the mean velocity or the
square-root of the second moment, and ν the kinematic viscosity. Due to scaling properties,
ﬂows with the same Reynolds number and the same geometry of boundary conditions are
similar.

226
12
Spatiotemporal Chaos
Properties of the turbulent state may already be understood by simple dimension and sta-
tistical arguments (see, e. g., Frisch, 1995, for a comprehensive exposition). Energy is injected
into the ﬂow on large length scales of order L, the integral scale, either due to boundary con-
ditions or stirring forces. Let ε denote the energy injection rate per unit mass and time. This
process induces the velocity of order U at the length scale L. As the physical dimension
of the energy rate is given by [ε] = m2/s3 these quantities are related by ε ∼U3/L. In a
stationary turbulent state the same amount of energy is dissipated by viscosity at a length
scale η, the dissipation scale. As the only physical relevant parameters are the energy rate ε
and the viscosity ν with dimension [ν] = m2/s the unique way to obtain such a dissipation
scale is η ∼(ν3/ε)1/4. Combining these expressions, the ratio of the two length scales obeys
L/η ∼Re3/4. Thus the scales are well separated for high Reynolds number ﬂows, i. e., in the
regime of fully developed turbulence. Energy is injected on the integral scale and dissipated
on the dissipation scale. In between, i. e., in the inertial range η ≪R ≪L, a ballistic trans-
port takes place. From a qualitative point of view the dynamics looks similar to that in the
Kuramoto–Sivashinsky equation (cf. Section 12.1.4), which sometimes serves as a toy model
for fully-developed turbulence.
Quantitative characterization of hydrodynamic turbulence is usually done by suitable cor-
relation functions of the velocity ﬁeld. In order to get rid of large scale features like the mean
ﬂow rate, which are nonuniversal and depend on the particular stirring mechanism, one con-
siders spatial velocity differences, ⃗u(⃗r + ⃗R,t) −⃗u(⃗r,t), with ⃗R chosen in the inertial range.
The statistical characterization is done in terms of moments of such differences which in its
simplest form reads
Mq(R) = ⟨|⃗u(⃗r +⃗R,t)−⃗u(⃗r,t)|q⟩.

Within the inertial range the moment (12.25) shows a power-law dependence on R, due to the
energy transport process from large to small scale. The law can be obtained by an heuristic
dimensional argument which has been developed independently by Kolmogorov and Obukov,
Heisenberg and Weizs¨acker, and Onsager. One assumes that, in the limit of large Reynolds
numbers, the energy transport at scale R, i. e., the statistical properties of Fourier modes of
wavenumber k ∼1/R, depends only on the energy transfer rate ε and on the local scale R.
Then, the only dimensionally correct expression for the moment (12.26) reads
Mq(R) ∼εq/3Rq/3 .
(12.26)
One obtains a power law with an exponent ζq = q/3 in the inertial range η ≪R ≪L. Such a
law can be derived even analytically from the Navier–Stokes equation for q = 3. It is also con-
ﬁrmed experimentally. But small deviations appear which are ampliﬁed when large exponents
q are considered. Such “intermittency corrections” are attributed to nonuniform features of
the dissipation process which have been implicitly neglected when deriving the result (12.26)
with the simple dimensional argument. Actually it is one of the main purposes of the mul-
tifractal approach introduced in Section 6.3 to model such deviations. But the derivation of
intermittency corrections from the full Navier–Stokes equation still poses one of the major
challenges of Nonlinear Dynamics.

12.3.2
Spatiotemporal Intermittency
Onset of turbulence is one of the most intense ﬁelds of research. A possible scenario based
on intermittency in spatially extended systems which goes beyond the investigation of low-
dimensional chaotic systems has been proposed by Kaneko (1985) on the basis of coupled
map lattices. Competition between local turbulent and laminar dynamics and spatial coupling
yields characteristic space–time patterns of turbulent and laminar phases.
A minimal model which captures all the essential ingredients has been introduced by Chat´e
and Manneville (1988). The single site map (cf. Fig. 175)
f(x) =

r(1/2−|x−1/2|)
if
0 ≤x ≤1
x
if
x > 1
(12.27)
has a quite trivial dynamics. After a chaotic transient in the domain x < 1 the motion settles on
a “laminar” state in the range x > 1. Due to spatial diffusive coupling, eq. (12.1), the motion
becomes nontrivial. Below a critical coupling strength ε < εc typical initial conditions ﬁnally
settle in the laminar domain. But beyond that critical value a persistent space–time chaotic
motion is observed, while close to the threshold, intermittency characteristics appear in the
space–time pattern (cf. Fig. 176). Such space–time intermittent scenarios share some features
with phase transitions, e. g., if one considers the statistical properties of laminar and turbulent
sites. But the problem concerning universality, scaling behavior, and critical exponents is quite
subtle and still not completely settled (Bohr et al., 2001).
Spatiotemporal intermittency is apparently a common mechanism for the generation of
turbulence as it has been found in a wide class of dynamical models, such as the Ginzburg–
Landau equation, as well as in hydrodynamic experiments.
12.3.3
Molecular Dynamics
Concepts of Nonlinear Dynamics have been applied to investigate the motion of many-particle
systems, i. e., solids, ﬂuids and gases, subjected to equilibrium and nonequilibrium condi-
tions. It is the main scope of such approaches to understand the fundamentals of Statistical
Physics from a dynamical point of view. In addition, the relation between quantiﬁers of chaotic
motion, like Liapunov exponents and fractal dimension spectra, and quantities of Statistical
Physics, like thermodynamical modules and transport coefﬁcients, is of particular interest.

rule, λk + λ6N+1−k, since each expanding exponent possesses a contracting counterpart (cf.

Nonlinear Nonequilibrium Space–Time Dynamics

Such Liapunov spectra typically display exponents with small modulus. These exponents
are related to the slow dynamics of the system. This a part of the motion is typically attributed
to hydrodynamic behavior which can be described in terms of macroscopic densities and the
corresponding hydrodynamic equations of motion. In fact, the Liapunov vectors reﬂect this
behavior. While Liapunov vectors corresponding to large exponents are highly localized (i. e.,
only a small part of the components have appreciable size) the Liapunov vectors of the small
exponents show wave-like characteristics (Forster et al. 2004).
To investigate nonequilibrium features of the system (12.28), one applies driving forces
and appropriate damping terms to keep, e. g., the energy constant. The corresponding sta-
tionary states of the dynamical system can be linked with the nonequilibrium physics of the
corresponding many-particle system (cf., e. g., Ruelle, 1999). In particular, transport coefﬁ-
cients and entropy production can be related to properties of the Liapunov spectrum. But the
matter is currently not completely understood.

Outlook
Within this book we have tried to present a comprehensible introduction to deterministic chaos
from the theoretical as well as experimental point of view. In particular, we have stressed the
importance of self-similar structures, renormalization-group ideas, and universality. Several
aspects, which are still in their infancy and which have been barely touched in the last chapters
of the book, concern recent developments in that ﬁeld.
First of all, even after several decades of research in nonlinear dynamics, the role of deter-
ministic chaos in systems with many degrees of freedom is not really understood. Such topics
are of utmost relevance when dealing, e. g., with interacting oscillator dynamics in biological
systems, nonequilibrium pattern formation in chemistry, or even the classical example of fully
developed turbulence and the signiﬁcance of intermittency. There is still a considerable lack of
understanding of the fundamental aspects of the dynamics in high-dimensional phase spaces,
e. g., the concept of attractors and related ergodic properties. Furthermore proper tools for
analyzing high-dimensional motion are still missing since the standard concepts of nonlinear
data analysis are essentially conﬁned to low-dimensional chaos.
Fundamental aspects of statistical physics, i. e., the foundations of nonequilibrium statis-
tical mechanics may beneﬁt from recent developments in nonlinear dynamics. Some of these
ideas have been brieﬂy sketched in the last chapters of the book. But there are still many
open questions. One puzzle, e. g., concerns the curious properties of heat transport in simple
nonlinear chains. Since quantum mechanics is at the heart of microscopic theories of many
particle systems, developments from quantum chaos are also expected to play a crucial role in
understanding nonlinear nonequilibrium physics properly.
Within the present book we focused entirely on deterministic dynamical systems. But the
interplay between stochastic forces and randomness with chaotic motion becomes increasingly
relevant. Nonlinear stochastic systems have been investigated for decades but the role of
chaotic motion is barely understood in this context. A prominent physical example are glass-
like phase transitions and aging which can be modelled by simple random chaotic systems.
The list is by no means complete. We have skipped all aspects related to mathemati-
cal approaches. While even low-dimensional chaotic motion still poses a considerable chal-
lenge from the rigorous point of view, the investigation of high-dimensional dynamics, i. e., on
inﬁnite-dimensional phase spaces, is just beginning. Here, links between dynamical systems
and equilibrium statistical mechanics which are mediated by symbolic dynamics may give
new insight into the ergodic properties as qualitative changes of the motion can be mapped
onto equilibrium phase transitions.

Outlook
Above all, the major conclusion stays the same as we had already stated one decade ago
in the previous edition: Since nature is nonlinear, one has always to reckon with deterministic
chaos. This means, however, that predictions about future developments in the ﬁeld of deter-
ministic chaos are as difﬁcult or short-ranged as predictions of chaotic motion itself, i. e., there
is (fortunately) much scope for the unexpected. Interestingly enough, about 100 years ago,
James Clerk Maxwell (the founder of the theory of electromagnetism) wrote the following
far-sighted remark about the predictability of nonlinear, i. e., unstable, systems (quoted after
Berry, 1978): “If, therefore, those cultivators of the physical science from whom the intelligent
public deduce their conception of the physicist .. . are led in pursuit of the arcana of science
to the study of the singularities and instabilities, rather than the continuities and stabilities
of things, the promotion of natural knowledge may tend to remove that prejudice in favor of
determinism which seems to arise from assuming that the physical science of the future is a
mere magniﬁed image of that of the past.”

Derivation of the Lorenz Model
For References see References to Chapter 2 on p. 260.
In the following we present a somewhat short derivation of the Lorenz model that should pro-
vide the reader with a feeling for the approximations involved. For a more rigorous treatment,
we refer the reader to the original articles by Saltzmann (1962) and Lorenz (1963) and the
monograph by Chandrasekhar (1961).
Consider the Rayleigh–B´enard experiment as depicted in Fig. 119. The liquid is described
by a velocity ﬁeld⃗v(⃗x, t) and a temperature ﬁeld T(⃗x, t). The basic equations which describe
our system are
a) the Navier–Stokes equations:
ρ d⃗v
dt = ⃗F −⃗∇p+µ⃗∇2v
(A.1)
b) the equation for heat conduction:
dT
dt = κ⃗∇2T
(A.2)
c) the continuity equation:
dρ
dt +div(ρ⃗v) = 0
(A.3)
with the boundary conditions
T(x, y, z = O, t)
=
T0 +∆T
T(x, y, z = h, t)
=
T0 .
(A.4)
Here ρ is the density of the ﬂuid, µ is its viscosity, p is the pressure, κ is the thermal
conductivity, and F = ρg⃗ez is the external force in the ⃗ez-direction due to gravity. The
fundamental nonlinearity in hydrodynamics comes from the term ˙⃗v = (⃗v ·⃗∇)⃗v + ∂⃗v/∂t
(which is quadratic in⃗v) in the Navier–Stokes equation (A.1).

Figure 178: Convection rolls and geometry in the B´enard experiment.
To simplify the calculation, it is assumed a) that the system is translationally invariant in
the y-direction so that convection rolls extend to inﬁnity as shown in Fig. 178, and b) that the
∆T-dependence of all coefﬁcients – except in ρ = ¯ρ(1−α∆T) – can be neglected (Boussinesq
approximation). The continuity equation thus becomes
∂u
∂x + ∂w
∂z = 0
with
u = vx
and
w = vz
(A.5)
and, it is, therefore, convenient to introduce a function ψ(x, z, t) with
u = −∂ψ
∂z
and
w = ∂ψ

(A.6)
such that (A.5) is automatically fulﬁlled.
As a next step we introduce the deviation θ(x, z, t) from the linear temperature proﬁle via
T(x, z, t) = T0 +∆T −∆T
h z+θ(x, z, t) .

Thus, ⃗X1 =⃗0 is stable, i. e., all eigenvalues are negative for 0 < r < 1. The B´enard convection
starts at r = 1 because then λ1 = 0, and this is just where the second ﬁxed point ⃗X2 (which

Its eigenvalues are the roots of the polynomial

(B.7)
One sees immediately that for r = 1 we have λ1 = 0, λ2 = −b, and λ3 = −(σ + 1), i. e., the
convection ﬁxed point is marginally stable, and Fig. 179 shows that it is stable for 1 < r < r1.
At r1 < rc two of the eigenvalues become complex, i. e., two limit cycles result which are
stable so long as the real part of the complex eigenvalues is smaller than zero. For r = rc these
real parts become zero, i. e., we have two eigenvalues λ = ±iλ0, which lead via (B.7) to

Above rc the limit cycles become unstable (the complex eigenvalues have positive real parts),
and chaos sets in. This analysis is consistent with the numerical result obtained by Lorenz,
who found chaotic behavior for σ = 10, b = 8/3 above rc = 24.74.
C
The Schwarzian Derivative
For References see References to Chapter 2 on p. 260.
Not all unimodal functions (i. e., continuously differentiable maps f that map the unit interval
[0, 1] onto itself with a single maximum at x = 1/2 and are monotonic for 0 ≤x ≤1/2 and
1/2 < x ≤1) display an inﬁnite sequence of pitchfork bifurcations.

must be negative over the whole interval [0, 1]. This is, for example, true for the logistic map,
since f ′′′(x) = 0.
To make this requirement, which at ﬁrst sight appears unusual, more plausible, we note
the important property that Sf < 0 implies a negative Schwarzian derivative for all iterates of
f, i. e., Sf n < 0. This can be veriﬁed by direct calculation. As a consequence, it is found that
at a ﬁxed point x0 of f that just becomes unstable, i. e.,
f ′(x0) = −1
(C.2)
and
f 2′(x0)
=
[f ′(x0)]2 = 1
(C.3)
f 2′′(x0)
=
f ′′(x0){[f ′(x0)]2 + f ′(x0)} = 0
the third derivative of f 2(x0) becomes negative for Sf < 0, and, near x0 = 0, f 2(x) behaves
as shown in Fig. 180, which can lead to a pitchfork bifurcation. The same ﬁgure shows that a
pitchfork bifurcation becomes impossible for Sf > 0.
The importance of the Schwarzian derivative had ﬁrst been noted by Singer, who showed
that unimodal maps with S f < 0 cannot have more than one periodic attractor. Later Gucken-
heirner and Misurewicz proved that, in this case, all points in [0, 1] (i. e., with the exception
of a set of measure zero) become attracted to it. The proofs and references can be found in the
monograph by Collet and Eckmann (1980).

Renormalization of the One-Dimensional Ising Model
For References see References to Chapter 2 on p. 260.
The functional renormalization group which is used in this book has been constructed in anal-
ogy to the renormalization-group method for critical phenomena. This section explains the
method for critical phenomena (which is simpler than the functional renormalization method)
for the example of the one-dimensional Ising model. Although the one-dimensional Ising
model has several strange features (its transition temperature is zero, etc., see below), these
are outweighed by the fact that every renormalization-group step can be performed explicitly.
It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the usual exact solution of this model that can be
found in most textbooks on statistical mechanics.
The partition function of the one-dimensional Ising model has the well-known form
Z = ∑
{σi}
e∑i σiσi+1
(D.1)
where β = J/T is the ratio of coupling constant J and temperature T; the spin variables σi
take the values σi = ±1, and the sites are i = 0 ... N. The renormalization-group steps are
visualized in Fig. 181: First, we sum in (D.1) over all spin variables σi with odd i. Then we
relabel the remaining variables with even i:
σ2i →σi/α
(D.2)
(for our simple example, we have α = 1; but for the two-dimensional Ising model, one needs
α ̸= 1). Figure 181 shows that the system of residual spins exhibits the same pattern as be-
fore and only two factors have changed: all lengths are reduced by a factor of two and the
coupling between the residual spins becomes renormalized (β →β′). At the transition tem-
perature T = Tc = 0, the correlation length is inﬁnite and the spin pattern is self-similar for all
length scales, i. e., repeated applications of the renormalization-group procedure always lead
to similar results.
To perform these steps explicitly, we consider a typical sum over an odd variable in (D.1):
Z3 = ∑
σ3
eβ(σ2σ3+σ3σ4) = 2[(coshβ)2 +σ2σ4(sinhβ)2] .
(D.3)

D
Renormalization of the One-Dimensional Ising Model
239
This can be written as
Z3 = c· eβ′σ2σ4 = c[coshβ+σ2σ4 sinhβ]
(D.4)
with
tanhβ′ = (tanhβ)2 .
(D.5)
Equation (D.5) is obtained by comparing the right-hand sides of (D.3) and (D.4), keeping in
mind that σ2 and σ4 have only the values ±1.
In the next step, we relabel the spins according to (D.2) and obtain the renormalized ver-
sion of Z:
Z(β) = Z(β′) = cN/2 ∑
{σi}
eβ′ ∑N/2
i
σiσi+1 .
(D.6)
(The constant c will not be further considered because it cancels in all thermodynamic aver-
ages). The renormalized coupling β′, between the residual spins is, according to (D.6):
β′ = artanh[(tanhβ)2] ≡R2(β) .
(D.7)
Iteration of the renormalization procedure yields
β′′ = R2[R2(β)] = R4(β) .
(D.8)
The last equal sign means that two repeated renormalizations are equivalent to one renormal-
ization where only every fourth spin is retained, i. e., the renormalization-group operators R
form a semigroup (“semi” because no inverse element exists). The ﬁxed points of (D.7) are
β∗= ∞
and
β∗= 0
(D.9)
i. e., they occur at zero temperature (the transition temperature of the one-dimensional Ising
model) and at inﬁnite temperature. In both limits, the spin pattern is self-similar (the spin
system is completely disordered at T = ∞, and at T = 0 all spins are aligned). For β > 0, the
system is always driven (by repeated applications of R2) to the stable ﬁxed point β∗= ∞.
Because the correlation length ξ is reduced by a factor of two, after one renormalization
step, we can immediately determine the temperature dependence of ξ via the following scaling
argument:
ξ(β) = 2ξ(β′)
(D.10)
→ξ(β) = 2{[artanh[(tanhβ)2]} = 2nξ{[artanh(tanhβ)2n]} .
(D.11)
For β ≫1, the variable n can be chosen such that
(tanhβ)2n = const.
(D.12)
→2n ∝1/log(tanhβ)
(D.13)
→ξ ∝1/log(tanhβ)
(D.14)
This last relation can be veriﬁed by direct computation of the correlation function:
⟨σ j+rσ j⟩
≡
∑
{σi}
eβ∑i σiσi+1 σj+1σj/

∑
{σi}
eβ∑i σiσi+1σj+1σ j

eβσiσi+1 = 2coshβ
(D.17)
and

(D.18)
It should be noted that for more complicated systems (e. g., the two- or three-dimensional
Ising model), the elimination of spin variables in one renormalization step leads to next-
nearest-neighbor and higher-order couplings (between the spins), and it is part of the art of
renormalization to keep track of them.

Decimation and Path Integrals for External Noise
For References see References to Chapter 2 on p. 260.
Here we present a derivation of the scaling form of the Liapunov exponent (4.90) that follows
an important article by Feigenbaum and Hasslacher (1982). Our main aim is to explain their
decimation method which has, on the one hand, a wide range of potential applications (for
example to the transition from quasi-periodicity to chaos in Chapter 7), and, on the other
hand, close parallels to the renormalization of the one-dimensional Ising model (explained in
Appendix D).

Decimation and Path Integrals for External Noise
241
This average has the form of a path integral that is (if the time variable i is interpreted as a
site index) reminiscent of the thermodynamic average of a magnet and, therefore, well-suited
for a renormalization-group treatment. The idea is to perform the integration over the xi step
by step, i. e., the renormalization-group treatment consists of integrating out all xi with odd is
(this is called “decimation”) and rescaling the variables such that the whole operation can be
repeated.
Let us choose n = 2q, q integer, and separate variables with even and odd indices in (E.4):

(E.6)
are evaluated using the saddle-point approximation that is valid for small noise amplitudes
σ ≪1.
If we have an integral over a function which is sharply peaked at x∗, the simplest form of
the saddle-point approximation consists of replacing the integral by the integrand taken at x∗.
Consider, for example, for N ≫1 the integral
I0 =
Z
dx e−NF(x) .
(E.7)
Using the saddle-point approximation this becomes

where the “saddle point” x∗is determined by the condition that e−NF(x) has a maximum at x∗,
i. e.,
F′(x∗) = 0 .
(E.9)
If we apply this approximation to (E.6), we obtain instead of (E.9):
−[x2i+2 −f(x∗
2i+1)]f ′(x∗
2i+1)+x∗
2i+1 −f(x2i) = 0
(E.10a)

and
I ≈exp{[x2i+2 −f 2(x2i)]2/2¯σ2}
(E.11)
(where we have omitted all pre-exponential factors because they will cancel out in ⟨xn⟩) and
¯σ2 = σ2 +{f ′[f(x2i)]}2σ2 .
(E.12)

242

Thus, ¯σ depends on x2i after one integration, i. e., when we repeat this procedure (see below)
we will always encounter x-dependent σs and instead of (E.6), we should therefore consider
from the very beginning

In analogy to our previous calculation, we also obtain eq. (E.11) for this I, but with (E.12)
replaced by
¯σ2(x2i) = σ2[f(x2i]+{f ′[f(x2i)]}2 ·σ2[x2i] .
(E.14)
If we combine eqs. (E.5), (E.11) and (E.14) and rescale and relabel the variables, i. e.,
x2i ≡¯xi/a ,
(a = −|a|)

i. e., ¯σ2(x) is obtained by acting on σ2(xn) with a linear operator ˆLf . We note that the rescaling
and relabeling were necessary to bring the expression (E.16) for ⟨xn⟩(after the odd variables
had been integrated out) back into the old form (E.4) such that the whole renormalization-
group transformation can be iterated.

Shannon’s Measure of Information
For References see References to Chapter 6 on p. 266.
This short heuristic introduction into Shannon’s measure of information should enable the
reader to understand Chapters 3 and 6. For a more detailed treatment we recommend the book
by Shannon and Weaver (1949).
F.1
Information Capacity of a Store
Figure 182 a shows a system with two possible states. If the position of the points is unknown,
a priori, and we learn that it is in the left box, say, we gain by deﬁnition information amounting
to one bit. If we obtain this information, we save one question (with possible answer yes or

their answers) to locate a point in a system with four states: right or left? up or down? c) In order to

Appendix
no, which we would have needed to locate the point). Thus, the maximum information content
of a system with two states is one bit.
For a box with four possible states, one needs two questions to locate the point, i. e., its
maximum information content I is
I = 2 (bits)
(F.1)
(we will drop the unit “bit” in the following).
This can be written as the logarithm to the base two (ld) of the number of possible states:
I = ld4 .
(F.2)
According to Fig. 182 c, this logarithmic relation between the maximum information content
I and the number of states N,
I = ldN
(F.3)
is true in general.
F.2
Information Gain
Let us now calculate the average gain in information if one learns the outcome of statistical
events. Suppose we toss a coin such that heads or tails occur with equal probabilities
p1 = p2 = 1
2 .
(F.4)
The information I acquired by learning that the outcome of this experiment is heads, say, is
I = 1
(F.5)
because there are two equally probable states, as in Fig. 182 a. This result can be expressed
via the {pi} as
I = −
1
2 ld 1
2 + 1
2 ld 1
2

(F.6)
or
I = −∑
i
pi ld pi .
(F.7)
Equation (F.7) can be generalized to situations where the pis are different:
p1 ̸= p2 = 1−p1 .
(F.8)
It then gives the average gain in information if we toss a deformed coin many times.
Let p1 = r/q, where r and q are mutually prime integers, and let us choose the number m
of events such that mr/q is again an integer. The total number of distinct states which occur if
one tosses a (deformed) coin m times is
N =
m!
(p1m)!(p2m)!
(F.9)
where we eliminated, by division, the permutations that correspond to a rearrangement of
equal events. The sequences hht and hht with h = head and t = tail, where the hs have been

This conﬁrms eq. (F.7) and can be generalized to Shannon’s result: If we, a priori, know
only that 1 ... n events (or states of a system) occur with probabilities {pi} (such that
∑n
i=1 pi = 1) and we learn by a measurement that a certain event j has taken place (or the
system actually occupies a certain state), then (if we repeat this measurement many times) we

with Feigenbaum constants that are larger than those for one-dimensional maps.

duce Helleman’s renormalization scheme (Helleman, 1980), which sheds some light on the
doubling mechanism and allows a convenient estimate of the relevant Feigenbaum constants.
The ﬁxed points of T are

Since T is an area-preserving map, detL = 1, i. e., λ2 = 1/λ1. This leaves (apart from parabolic
ﬁxed points that we do not consider here because they are not generic) only two essentially
different types of ﬁxed point:
a) Hyperbolic ﬁxed point: The λs are real and λ1 > 1 implies λ2 = 1/λ1 < 1, i. e., along
the directions of the eigenvectors e1, e,2 the behavior shown in Fig. 184 is found, which
can be described by

We therefore see the beginning of a bifurcation cascade.
Let us now demonstrate the self-similarity which leads to the whole sequence of period
doublings by introducing Hellemann’s renormalization scheme.
It starts from (G.3) which can be written as
xn+1 +xn−1 = 2Cxn +2x2

(G.19)
If we add (G.19), then for n = 2m+1 and n = 2m−1 we obtain
∆x2m+2 +∆x2m−2
=
−2∆x2m +(2C +4x∗
0)[∆x2m−1 +∆x2m−1]
+2[(∆x2m−1)2 +(∆x2m+1)2] .
(G.20)
Now we take (G.19) at n = 2m,
∆x2m+1 +x2m+1 = (2C +4x∗
1)∆x2m +2(∆x2m)2
(G.21)
and add it to (G.20):
∆x2m+2 +∆x2m−2 = 2C′∆x2m +2α(∆x2m)2 +O[(∆x)3] .
(G.22)
This equation can be put into the same form as (G.17) by rescaling x′

The meaning of eq. (G.23) is as follows: If the two-dimensional map is developed to second
order around the two-cycle and the result is rescaled, one obtains the old map, i. e., the stability
of x∗= y∗= 0 for |C| < 1 implies [because of the similarity of (G.17) and (G.23)] the stability
of x∗′ = y∗′ = ∆x = ∆y = 0, i. e., of the two-cycle for |C| = |−2C2 +4C +7| < 1 or 1−
√
5 <
C < −1.
Repeating this argument we see that (G.23) also holds for the derivatives around a four-
cycle, etc. A cascade of bifurcations with cycles of period 2n is obtained which are stable for
Cn−1 < C < Cn where
Cn−1 = 2C2
n +4Cn +7 .

The bifurcation points accumulate at C∞which is determined by
C∞= 2C∞+4C∞+7 →C∞= −1.2656(1.266311...)

For References see References to Chapter 10 on p. 275.
The simplest integrable conservative systems are harmonic oscillators, and the simplest
chaotic systems are described by piecewise linear maps (see Chapter 3). Harmonic oscillators
are the starting point for perturbation expansions in classical mechanics (see Chapter 8).
In the following we will show that, in an analogous fashion, the dynamics on strange
attractors can be successively approximated by the dynamics of piecewise linear maps. The
points on the attractor around which one linearizes are determined by the unstable periodic
cycles. If we describe the dynamics on the attractor by the map
⃗x t+1 = ⃗f(⃗x t) ,
(H.1)
then the unstable cycles {⃗x∗} of order n are just the unstable ﬁxed points of order n of ⃗f(⃗x):
⃗x∗= ⃗f (n)(⃗x∗) .
(H.2)
Here ⃗f (n)(⃗x) is the nth iterate of the map and the cycle is unstable. This means that the
Jacobian Jij = ∂f (n)
i
(⃗x∗)/∂x∗
j has at least one eigenvalue with modulus larger than 1. If one
takes the points of all unstable periodic orbits, they cover the attractor with a dense set. The
trajectory on the attractor becomes repelled from these points (because they are unstable) and
dances between them. The rhythm of this dance is determined by the unstable periodic orbits.

This metaphorical picture and the importance of unstable periodic orbits was already known
to Poincar´e. In his book Statistical Mechanics, Thermodynamic formalism (1978) Ruelle had
already developed a method to expand physical averages in terms of unstable periodic orbits
for expanding maps. During recent years Cvitanovich and his co-workers (Cvitanovich et al.,
1990) have shown how averages on strange attractors (for example generalized dimensions
or generalized entropies) can be expanded in terms of unstable periodic orbits of increasing
order.
In the following we want to explain the importance of unstable periodic orbits for the
example of one-dimensional maps, further details and applications can be found in the cited
literature. In the ﬁrst step we show that the eigenvalues of the Frobenius–Perron operator
(which determines the dynamics on the strange attractor) can be expanded in terms of unstable
periodic orbits. Next we explain how a nonlinear map can be approximated in a hierarchical
fashion by piecewise linear maps.
The linear Frobenius–Perron operator describes the time development of a dynamical sys-
tem. It has for a one-dimensional map
xt+1 = f(xt)
(H.3)

the form
K(x|y) = δ[x−f(y)] .
(H.4)
The time development of an arbitrary function p(x) under the inﬂuence of the map f(x) is
determined by
pt+1(x) =
Z
dyK(x|y) pt(y) .
(H.5)
Every linear operator (think of a matrix) can be written in terms of its left and right eigen-
functions (eigenvectors of the matrix) and its eigenvalues. Therefore, K(x|y) can be written
as:
K(x|y) = ∑
v
λvΦR
v (x) ΦL
v(y) .
(H.6)
Here λv are the eigenvalues and ΦL
v(x), ΦR
v (y) are the left and right eigenfunctions of K(x|y),
which are deﬁned by:

(H.8)
Next we will show that the eigenvalues λv of K(x|y) can be written in terms of the unstable
periodic orbits of f(x). The eigenvalues of any linear operator are given by the zeros of the
characteristic polynomial
det[1−zK] = 0 ,
(H.9)
i. e., z = {λ−1
v }. Since we have for any nonsingular matrix M the relation logdetM = TrlogM
(in terms of the eigenvalues Γi one has detM = ∏i Γi and logdetM = ∑i logΓi = TrM). The
logarithm of the determinant in eq. (H.9) can be written as
logdet[1−zK] = Trlog[1−zK] .

(H.14)
The solutions of eq. (H.14) are all one-cycles (= ﬁxed points), two-cycles and cycles of higher
order (up to length n) of f(x) (see Chapter 4). Since the chaotic regime contains only unstable
periodic orbits, we have
|f (n)′(x∗)| > 1 .
(H.15)
Let us now compute as a simple example the eigenvalues of the Frobenius–Perron operator of
the Bernoulli shift σ(x) = 2xmod1 (see Chapter 3). The nth iterate of σ(x) can be written as
σn(x) = (2nx)mod1 .
(H.16)
Figure 187 shows that σn(x) has just 2n ﬁxed points. Therefore we obtain
TrKn = ∑

(H.17)
If we use this result in eq. (H.12) for the characteristic polynomial, we get:
logdet(1−zK) = −

∑

which has the zeros zm = 2m, i. e., the eigenvalues of K have the form
λv = z−1
v
= 2−v .
(H.21)
We have shown that the eigenvalues of the Frobenius–Perron operator are uniquely determined
by unstable periodic orbits. What is needed to compute these eigenvalues are the positions of
the cycle elements and (because the chain rule allows us to express f n′ by f ′) the derivatives
of f(x) at these positions, i. e., to calculate λv, it is sufﬁcient to know the piecewise linearized
map where the linearization has been performed around the cycle points (this yields {f ′(x∗)}
and {x∗]}.
To make this geometrical picture even clearer, we consider the logistic map for r > 4
(see Fig. 188 a) and ask which points will remain within the unit interval, if we start from a
homogeneous distribution of points within the interval [0, 1] and iterate the map. The ﬁrst
iteration step eliminates all points with f(x) > 1 (Fig. 188 a–b). After the second iteration
step all points with f 2(x) > 1 have left the interval (Fig. 188 c–d). How could we estimate the
length of the remaining intervals?
First we note that all remaining intervals contain at least one point of an unstable periodic
orbit (see Fig. 188).
As a second step we approximate the logistic map successively by piecewise linear maps,
which touch the original map at the points which correspond to unstable periodic orbits (see
Fig. 189 a). Thereby we obtain, to ﬁrst order, the estimate

After n iteration steps the remaining set of points has a measure Γn which is proportional to
Γn ∼∑
ﬁx

1
f n′(x∗)
 .
(H.24)
Here the sum runs again over all ﬁxed points f n(x) = x∗, and eq. (H.24) is an estimate for
Γn, where we neglected factors of order 1 because f n′(x∗) diverges as |f n′(x∗)| ∝en·const.. By
comparing eq. (H.24) with eq. (H.13), we see that Γn is just equal to the trace of Kn (note
f n′(x) ≫1, i. e., |1−f n′(x∗)| ≈f n′(x∗)| ):
Γn ∼TrKn .
(H.25)
Therefore a computation of the trace of Kn via unstable periodic orbits corresponds to an
approximation of the nonlinear map by piecewise linear maps which are located at the cycle
points.
Figure 190 shows that this geometrical picture can also be generalized to higher-dimensi-
onal maps and attractors, and it represents, from the conceptual point of view, the main result
of this chapter. Equation (H.25) can also be derived in a more direct fashion by writing Γn as:
Γn =
Z
dx′ dxδ[x′ −f n(x)] .
(H.26)
Here we ﬁrst summed over all points x within the unit interval and then considered only those
points x′ which remain after n iterations within the interval. To show that Γn ∝TrKn, we note
that Kn can be written as
Kn(x|y) = ∑
v
λn
v ΦR
v (x) ΦL
v(y) = δ[x−f n(y)] .

approximated by piecewise linear maps (centered around the points that belong to the unstable periodic

For n →∞the sum is dominated by the largest eigenvalue, i. e., we have
Kn(x|y) ∼λn

(H.28)
Therefore
Γn ∼λn

(H.29)
and λn
max = TrKn for n →∞.
We have shown for the example of the Bernoulli shift σ(x) = 2xmod1, that the sum over
n in eq. (H.13) can be performed explicitly. This is of course not always possible. But it has
been shown by Artuso et al., (1990), that the sum over all ﬁxed points in eq. (H.13) can be
replaced by a simpler sum over so-called primitive unstable cycles in such a way that one
obtains a systematic expansion of det(1−zK) in terms of primitive cycles. In the following
section we want to make this idea plausible (mathematical rigor is not intended) and we refer
for more details to the original article (Artuso et al., 1990).
The simplest primitive cycle is a ﬁxed point for which we have f n′(x∗) = [f ′(x∗)]n, i. e.,
for this cycle we can perform the sum over n in complete analogy to eq. (H.17). In a similar
fashion, cycles of higher order can be reduced to simpler cycles, and the corresponding n-sums
can be performed.

Appendix
With |1−f n′(x∗)|−1 = |f n′(x∗)|−1 ∑∞
m=0 |f n′(x∗)|, it follows from eq. (H.13):
TrKn =

∑
m=0∑
ﬁx

∑
n=0

n |f n′(x∗)|−(m+1) .
(H.30)
If one reduces the sum over the ﬁxed points ∑ﬁx to the sum of the primitive ﬁxed cycles ∑p
(we will refer for details to Artuso et al., 1990), it becomes plausible that TrKn can be written
as
TrKn
=

∑
m=0∑
p

∑
n=0
[znp|f ′(xp)|(m+1)]n/n
=

∑
m=0∑
p
log[1−znp|f ′(xp)|−(m+1)] .
(H.31)
This yields:
det(1−zK) =
∞
∏
m=0∏
p
1
1−znp|f ′(xp)|−(m+1) .
(H.32)
Here np is an integer which determines the multiplicity of the corresponding cycle. The prod-
uct of the primitive cycles ∏p is the so-called Ruelle zeta function because it bears a formal
analogy to the Euler representation of the Riemann zeta function ζ(z) (see, e. g., Edwards,
1974):
ζ(z) =
∞
∑
m=0

nz = ∏

(H.33)
The last equality sign becomes plausible if we recall that each integer can be written as a
product of prime numbers pi with different multiplicity, i. e., n = ∏pi pmi
i , and the summation
over n corresponds to a summation over all mi, i. e.,
ζ(z) =
