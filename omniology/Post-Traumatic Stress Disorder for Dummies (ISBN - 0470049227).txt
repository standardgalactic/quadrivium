Dedication
To the soldiers, firefighters, and police officers and their families who have
sacrificed so much to create peace on Earth, that this book may help them
regain peace of mind.
Author’s Acknowledgments
I am fortunate to have been taught, influenced, and inspired by some of the
brightest and most caring individuals in the field of mental health, including
Drs. Wilfred Bion, Herbert Linden, Lars Lofgren, Karl Menninger, Robert
Pynoos, Robert Stoller, Louis Jolyon West, Carl Whitaker, and Peter Whybrow.
Their collective wisdom serves as the magnetic north on my compass, and I
feel blessed that I could turn to them in person and later on in memory to
guide me in trying to ease the suffering of the thousands of people I have
seen in my career.
I am especially grateful to Dr. Edwin Shneidman, one of the pioneers in the
study of suicide and founder of the American Association of Suicidology.
From this teacher, mentor, and now dear friend, I learned more about bring-
ing hope to the hopeless than from any other individual.
On a different note, I am eternally grateful to the late Dr. William MacNary,
who as Dean of Students at Boston University School of Medicine safely shep-
herded me during my medical school training through one of the most diffi-
cult and traumatic times in my professional life. My subsequent career and
dedication to helping those in difficulty have been an effort to pass on to my
patients the kindness that Dean MacNary showed me when I most needed it.
With regard to this book, I am thankful for the enthusiastic support of my
agents Bill Gladstone and Ming Russell of Waterside Productions, the stead-
fast input of my acquisitions editor Tracy Boggier and my project editor
Kristin DeMint at Wiley, the polishing done by copy editor Danielle Voirol,
and deft assistance with this manuscript by Alison Blake.
I also appreciate the patience and support (and tolerance, especially during
those tight deadlines) of my wife, Lisa; my three children, Lauren, Emily, and
Billy; and my business partners, Keith Ferrazzi and Peter Winick at the con-
sulting company Ferrazzi Greenlight, through which I do much of my consult-
ing and coaching work.
Finally, I am indebted to the individuals, families, and couples who have
entrusted me with the hurt and horror from their lives and in doing so
enabled me to help them walk out of the darkness and into the light.

Introduction
L
ife is an unpredictable adventure, and it can slip you some pretty big
shocks now and then. Often these jolts are exciting, and although they
may rattle you briefly, they make for great stories and add richness to your
life. But sometimes events can pull the rug out from under you, leaving you
feeling shocked, terrified, unsheltered, and alone. These experiences can
shake you to your core, altering your feelings about yourself, other people,
and the world around you. Consider these people’s words:
A combat survivor says, “The old me died in that war. I don’t recognize
the person I am now.”
A woman who survived a rape says, “People say I’m cold and unfeeling
now. They don’t know that inside, I’m falling apart.”
A heart attack survivor says, “I feel so lost. It’s like I see my old life in the
distance, but I can’t find my way back to it.”
All these people have post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). They’re scared,
angry, and sad — and they have every reason to be. A traumatic life event
turned their lives upside down, transforming their once safe and happy world
into a terrifying and alien place they fear they’ll never escape.
The most important message of this book is this: There is a road out of this
terrible place. The fact that you’re still afraid doesn’t mean you’re in any
danger. It just takes the will and the way for your heart and soul to accept
what the logical part of your mind already knows. I’ve been treating patients
with PTSD for more than two decades, and the vast majority of them make
the journey back to wellness. Often, it’s not an easy journey — or a short one.
But there is help, there is hope, and there is a better future ahead. In short,
there’s life after PTSD — and a good one, I might add. In this book, I explain
how to set your course for that brighter future.
About This Book
I have piles of academic books on PTSD, but they’re pretty dry reading. My
goal in this book is to cut through all those fancy words and give you the
basic facts you really need about what PTSD is and how you can overcome it.
I also lighten these pages with a few jokes because I figure you have a sense
of humor and can use a good laugh — even though you and I both know that
PTSD is a very serious matter.

If you’re a trauma survivor with PTSD, this book clearly lays out the steps
you can take to reclaim your life and your future. In addition to giving you
info about a wide range of therapy approaches, I offer advice on self-help
steps that can aid in taming your PTSD symptoms.
If you’re caring for a person fighting PTSD, you can find the tools you need to
play an active part in your loved one’s recovery. Because partners and par-
ents play an especially powerful role in helping a person heal from PTSD, I
cover the roles of these very important people in depth. In addition, I offer
helpful advice for extended family members and friends.
Whether you’re battling PTSD yourself or caring for someone who’s facing
this challenge, you can begin these pages with a sense of hope — because
the fight against PTSD is a battle you can win.
Conventions Used in This Book
If you have PTSD (or are struggling to cope along with someone who does)
you’re probably feeling more than a little frazzled. To make the process of
gathering information as simple as possible for you, I use the following tools
throughout the book to help you navigate through the text quickly and easily.
 When I introduce a new term, I put it in italics to highlight it — and if it’s
medical jargon (which I avoid as much as possible), I offer a plain-
English explanation.
 I use boldface to set off important keywords and numbered steps.
 I use monofont to indicate useful Web sites. If a Web address breaks
across two lines of text, I don’t add an extra hyphen or any spaces, so
just type exactly what you see.
What You’re Not to Read
I hope you find every part of this book valuable — but don’t feel like you need
to read every word. Instead, pick and choose the material that suits your needs.
For instance, if you’re not into the scientific nitty-gritty about PTSD, you can
skip any text marked with the Technical Stuff icon. You can also pass over the
sidebars if you’re pressed for time — but consider giving these gray boxes a
quick glance because they contain lots of useful advice and inspiring stories
about others who’ve walked the path that you or your loved one is on. And of
2
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder For Dummies 

course, feel free to ignore sections that don’t have anything to do with your
life; for instance, skip the chapter on PTSD in children if you’re interested
only in adult PTSD.
Foolish Assumptions
In writing this book, I kept a clear picture of you, the reader, in mind.
Therefore, I had to assume a few things about you and your needs:
 You’re relatively new to PTSD. Maybe you’re newly diagnosed or won-
dering whether you have the disorder — or maybe you’re a relative or
friend who’s hoping to help a person who’s struggling with PTSD.
 If you have PTSD, you want to know all your options so you can have an
active say in your treatment plan.
 You’re willing to face your problem head-on and seek help if you do have
PTSD.
 You want to know that there’s real help for the pain you’re suffering.
(And yes — there is!)
How This Book Is Organized
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder For Dummies is organized into six parts and 18
chapters. Here’s a quick look at each part.
Part I: The Basics of PTSD
In Chapter 1, you find a quick overview of the history of PTSD, the major
causes of this disorder, and the numbers of people it affects. Chapter 2 gives
you the lowdown on what trauma is and describes the factors that can put
you at extra risk for developing PTSD. Next, in Chapter 3, I describe the key
symptoms of PTSD and talk about other disorders — such as depression and
substance abuse problems — that often complicate the PTSD picture. In addi-
tion, I describe the very different symptoms that kids with PTSD can show.
Chapter 4 tackles a very different topic: what experts know (and don’t know)
about preventing PTSD. In this chapter, I talk about what does and doesn’t
help when you’re trying to stop PTSD before it starts. I also offer info about
new drug treatments that show promise in short-circuiting the brain changes
that can trigger PTSD symptoms.

Introduction

Part II: Getting a Diagnosis 
and Drafting a Plan
Maybe you’re wondering whether you have PTSD — or maybe you already
have a diagnosis but you’re not sure where to go from here. Either way, you
can find answers to your questions in this part.
In Chapter 5, I offer a self-test to help you determine whether your symptoms
point to PTSD, and I provide advice on getting a diagnosis if they do. Chapter
6 describes how and where to locate good therapists and tells you the ques-
tions you should ask before deciding whether a particular therapist is right
for you. And Chapter 7 talks about the steps you can take before therapy to
make sure you get optimal results when you start treatment.
Part III: Choosing the Right 
Treatment Approach
Today’s treatments are highly effective in reducing the pain of PTSD, but a
treatment that works like a charm for one person can miss the mark with
another. When you know the range of treatments available for PTSD, you can
choose the approach that works best for you.
In this part, I describe a wide variety of approaches to treating PTSD. Chapter
8 talks about cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), the most widely used ther-
apy for PTSD. Chapter 9 describes the drug treatments that sometimes play
an important role in recovery, and Chapter 10 describes a host of additional
therapies and offers some stats on how helpful they are.
Part IV: Healing and Rebuilding 
during and after Treatment
The most important person on your recovery team is you — and in this part,
I describe the steps you can take to keep your progress on track. First, I talk
about what you can expect from therapy and how to maximize your results.
Next, I offer a cornucopia of ways to enhance your mental and physical
health, stop stress in its tracks, erase the hidden agendas that hold you back,
and enjoy life’s pleasures (including intimacy and sexuality) again. I also talk
about how to get back into the stream of life — jobs, friendships, life goals —
when you get PTSD under control.
However, you’re not the only important person involved in your recovery.
That’s why I also talk about the ways in which PTSD strains family ties — and
the steps you can take to make those bonds strong again.

Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder For Dummies 

Part V: Stepping In: When You’re Not 
the One Who’s Suffering
Maybe you’re reading this book because you’re worried about a child who’s
showing signs of PTSD. If so, you can find a wealth of information in Chapter
15 about the treatments you can call on to help your child heal. You can also
get tips on making family and friends a part of your child’s recovery plan.
On the other hand, you may be reading this book because you’re a good
friend of a person with PTSD and you want to find ways to help. If so, check
out Chapter 16 for practical advice about the do’s and don’ts of supporting
someone who’s struggling to break free from PTSD’s grip.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
Knowing the facts about PTSD can help you dispel false ideas that can get in
the way of healing. That’s why Chapter 17 outlines the ten most common
myths about PTSD and gives you the true story about each one. In Chapter
18, I clue you in on some of the subtle and not-so-subtle signs of healing that
you can anticipate as time goes by.
Following the Part of Tens, you can find a helpful appendix listing Web sites,
books, documentaries, and other resources that can help you turn the tide
against PTSD.
Icons Used in This Book
One handy device that For Dummies books use is the icon — a symbol in the
margin that lets you quickly spot the types of information that interest you.
In this book, I use the following icons:
This icon highlights an important bit of information that you won’t want 
to forget.
The Tip icon marks practical advice that can be part of your action plan for
defeating PTSD.
The Warning icon alerts you to be careful about a possible hazard or to seek
professional help in handling a particular problem.
5
Introduction

This icon lets you know that a piece of information is interesting but not nec-
essary to read if you’re pressed for time and want to zero in on the facts you
need to jump-start your healing from PTSD.
This icon points you to inspiring, enlightening, or just plain interesting sto-
ries about real patients — mine and other doctors’ — and the insights these
survivors have to offer. Where I include stories about patients of mine, know
that these people are real. However, I’ve changed their names and other iden-
tifying details to make sure I protect their privacy.
Where to Go from Here
Depending on who you are — a person with PTSD, friend, or family member —
some parts of this book will be more important to you than others. That’s why
you don’t need to start on page 1 and read straight through. Instead, you can
use the Table of Contents or index to find the topics that interest you the
most. For example, if the facts and figures about PTSD don’t interest you, feel
free to cut to the chase and start with Part II, where you can find info on effec-
tive treatments.
As you read this book, feel free to skip from section to section and read it in
any order. I do recommend reading Chapters 2 and 3 if you’re seeking a basic
understanding of what PTSD is. And I suggest reading Part II for information
on treatments if you’re saying, “I’m ready to get better — how do I start?” If
you’re helping a child who has PTSD, or pitching in to aid a PTSD-affected
friend in need, Part V is an excellent place to dive in.
Wherever you start, you’re making an excellent move — because the advice
and strategies in this book can help you take back control of your life (or
effectively support someone you love in doing so) and make your future a
better and brighter one. I wish you the very best of luck in achieving that
goal!

Part I
The Basics 
of PTSD

In this part . . .
H
aving some basic facts under your belt can be a big
help if you’re tackling PTSD. In this section, I look at
the history of this disorder, the number of people it affects,
and the big reasons getting help for PTSD is so important.
Next, I talk about what doctors mean by stress and trauma
and why some people are more vulnerable than others to
PTSD. After that, I go through the signs and symptoms of
PTSD, talk about other disorders that often are part of 
the package, and discuss why PTSD in kids and teens is
different from the adult version. Finally, I talk about pre-
ventive treatments for PTSD and explain their benefits 
and limitations — and why you may still have PTSD even
if you received one of those treatments.

Chapter 1
The Invisible Epidemic of PTSD
In This Chapter
 Diagnosing PTSD
 Tracing the history of PTSD
 Counting the number of people PTSD affects
 Recognizing the most common causes of PTSD
 Adding up PTSD’s cost to society
You jump out of your skin if you hear a police siren or a car backfiring.
You wake up screaming after terrible nightmares. You feel cut off from
your life and the people around you, and you’re angry or sad all the time.
Worst of all, you experience moments of sheer terror when your mind pulls
you out of the present and drags you into a horrifying time in your past.
If you suffer from symptoms like these, you probably feel very much alone —
but in reality, you aren’t. Instead, you’re likely one of millions of people around
the world who suffer from a disorder called post-traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD).
If so, you’re facing a problem as old as humankind. The difference between
the past and now, as you discover in this book, is that for today’s PTSD suf-
ferers, effective help for this pain is available. In the chapters that follow, I
talk about the many ways to treat PTSD and explain why you can be very
optimistic about your future.
As you begin your journey into a better tomorrow, it’s a good idea to gain a
little knowledge about the adversary you’re facing. In this chapter, I take a
quick look at what PTSD is, as well as why treating this disorder is crucial. I
also offer an overview of the history of PTSD as a diagnosis and explain how
people’s understanding of this disorder has evolved over time. Next, I talk
about the numbers of people (both adults and children) affected by PTSD, as
well as the many types of traumatic experiences that can set PTSD in motion.
In addition, I look at the toll PTSD takes not just on each individual sufferer
but also on society as a whole.

Part I: The Basics of PTSD 
The Diagnosis of PTSD: A Serious Matter
That Requires Serious Intervention
PTSD is a major, life-altering disorder that strikes many people who survive
traumatic experiences. I use the phrase invisible epidemic to describe this
disorder because it affects millions of people of every age and in every walk
of life, and many of them suffer alone and in silence. They feel scared, anx-
ious, and isolated from the rest of the world — and they feel like no one can
understand what they’re going through.
To a casual observer, these people often seem to be doing just fine. But in
reality, they’re battling devastating symptoms that, if left untreated, make it
difficult or impossible for them to hold down jobs, have meaningful relation-
ships, or achieve their goals and dreams.
PTSD short-circuits people’s lives by causing disabling symptoms that
include a hyper-alert nervous system, numbness and detachment, and intru-
sive thoughts or flashbacks about the trauma (see Chapter 3 for an in-depth
discussion of these problems). Living with these symptoms is a huge chal-
lenge, made even bigger by the fact that other problems such as depression
or substance abuse often come along for the ride (another topic I cover in
Chapter 3). People with complex PTSD, which stems from multiple traumas,
may develop an even wider range of severe problems, including dangerous
and self-destructive behaviors (see Chapter 2).
Getting treatment if you have PTSD is crucial because this disorder doesn’t
simply go away on its own. Unlike the normal, temporary stress symptoms
that often occur after a life crisis, PTSD involves profound biochemical and
psychological changes that cause the toxic memories of a trauma to remain
strong instead of fading. (See Chapter 2 for more on the differences between
normal stress responses and PTSD.) As a result, people with PTSD become
trapped in their trauma, unable to process what happened and move on with
their lives. In addition, untreated PTSD often leads to secondary wounding (a
topic I cover in Chapter 8) because the problems caused by PTSD can lead to
broken relationships, lost jobs, and other new traumas.
The good news — and it’s very good news indeed — is that PTSD is highly
treatable, and the vast majority of people with this disorder gain freedom
from the disabling symptoms and get control of their lives again. In Chapters
8 through 10, I describe the wide range of treatments doctors and therapists
now have to help adults with this disorder, and in Chapter 13, I look at inter-
ventions that can benefit children and teens. In addition, as I explain in
Chapter 12, you can combine therapy with self-help steps that boost your
healing power. So take heart: If you’re in the depths of PTSD right now, the
solutions are within your reach.

A Little Background on PTSD
PTSD is an age-old problem, but in a sense, it’s also a new disorder because
professionals are still learning about its causes, symptoms, and treatment.
As I explain in Chapter 2, PTSD can stem from any type of traumatic experi-
ence. However, much of the current knowledge about PTSD comes from one
particular source — the military — for an obvious reason: War causes trauma
on a massive scale. Throughout history, each successive war led to new
names for the condition and new theories about its causes:
 During the American Civil War, doctors called combat-related trauma sol-
dier’s heart. (The name wasn’t far off the mark because — as I discuss in
Chapter 3 — PTSD can affect your heart as well as your thoughts, emo-
tions, and behavior.)
 World War I doctors called it shell shock, thinking that it stemmed from
changes in air pressure when artillery shells exploded.
 During World War II, doctors renamed combat trauma battle fatigue and
made the terrible error (also made by many earlier generals) of blaming
it on weakness or cowardice.
 By the beginning of the Korean War, psychiatrists began to recognize
PTSD — then dubbed gross stress reaction — as a real disorder crying
out for study.
PTSD made its way into the medical world as a legitimate disorder by finding
a place in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or DSM
(the bible of modern American psychiatry) in 1980, following the Vietnam
War. By this point, doctors recognized that civilians as well as soldiers could
develop PTSD after a trauma. Even so, people who developed PTSD still
found little sympathy, and the cruel myth that PTSD was a sign of weakness
persisted. That myth finally died out (although not totally, as I explain in
Chapter 17) toward the end of the 1900s, largely because soldiers from the
Vietnam era and the first Gulf War fought hard to get the military — and the
rest of the world — to take PTSD seriously.
Everyone dealing with PTSD, on either a personal or a professional basis,
owes a big debt of gratitude to those wounded warriors who refused to
sweep PTSD under the rug. Their persistence gave PTSD research a huge
boost, and that research in turn opened doctors’ eyes to the fact that millions
of people — not just soldiers but also people who survived sexual assaults,
natural disasters, illnesses, and other traumatic events — have a real medical
problem and need real medical help.
11
Chapter 1: The Invisible Epidemic of PTSD

As a result, people who suffer from PTSD today are likely to get an accurate
diagnosis and effective treatment instead of a cold shoulder and a brusque
recommendation to “just get over it.” (To increase your odds of success in
diagnosis and treatment, see my advice in Chapters 5 and 6 on finding good
professional help.) Better yet, treatments for PTSD grow more effective with
each passing year. In fact, current research (see Chapter 4) hints that some-
day, doctors may be able to stop many cases of PTSD before they start.
Professionals still have far to go in fully understanding PTSD, but they’re light
years ahead of where they were just a few decades ago — thanks largely to
generations of vets who finally won their battle against ignorance and stigma.
Stats on PTSD: The Numbers Game
It’s easy to tell whether the man next to you in the checkout line has a head
cold (all too easy, in fact!) or whether the neighbor you pass on the street has
a broken leg. But PTSD is a silent problem whose sufferers usually hide in
plain sight. Millions of people with PTSD don’t even know that they have the
disorder, and millions more keep their pain to themselves because they’re
afraid (for reasons I explain in Chapter 5) to seek help.
12
Part I: The Basics of PTSD 
The story behind PTSD: A problem as 
old as humanity
As I explain in Chapter 2, PTSD has a lot to do
with biochemistry — that is, the chemicals that
make your body tick. Because your ancestors
had almost exactly the same biochemistry as
you, it’s no surprise that PTSD made its first
appearance around the dawn of human history.
In fact, the first person to describe it was an
Egyptian doctor in 1900 BCE. But doctors didn’t
immediately figure out what causes PTSD. In
fact, they came up with some pretty bizarre the-
ories about it.
The oddest of these theories arose in the 1800s,
when doctors studied people hurt in train
wrecks (common events in those days). In addi-
tion to their physical injuries, many of these
people reported having insomnia, nightmares,
memory loss, and extreme fear of train travel —
no doubt symptoms of PTSD stemming from the
terrifying experiences they survived. The cause
of these symptoms, the doctors said, was the
incredibly fast speed of the newfangled trains
of the era — which went about 30 miles an
hour!
By the late 1800s, leading lights in psychiatry,
including Sigmund Freud, began spotting the
link between trauma and PTSD-like symptoms.
Unfortunately, Freud set progress back again by
changing his mind and deciding that these
symptoms stemmed, at least in women, from
sexual fantasies rather than real traumas. (For
a genius, he could be pretty dim sometimes.) It
took two World Wars, and several smaller ones,
for experts to gain a true understanding of how
PTSD affects people traumatized by war or
other catastrophic events.

As a result, knowing the true scope of this tragedy is impossible. However,
even the numbers that experts do know reveal a huge cost in human pain.
According to the U.S. government’s National Technical Information Service
(www.ntis.gov), PTSD is “one of the most prevalent of all mental disorders,
surpassed only by substance use disorders and depression as major public
and mental health issues.” Here’s a quick look at the numbers of adults and
children this disorder affects.
PTSD in adults
Once upon a time, experts thought that PTSD affected only soldiers. Now,
however, it’s clear that anyone — librarians, cab drivers, teachers, dentists —
can fall prey to this life-altering disorder. All it takes to trigger PTSD is a trauma,
and unfortunately, there are plenty of those to go around.
In fact, more than 70 percent of Americans suffer a traumatic event at some
time in their lives. Of these trauma survivors, up to 20 percent develop PTSD.
Put another way, approximately 13 million Americans — 5 percent of the 
population — suffers from PTSD at any given time.
Women develop PTSD at twice the rate of men, for reasons I talk about in
Chapter 2. Studies suggest that rates of PTSD also are higher for people who
are Hispanic or African American, possibly because people in these groups
have a higher exposure to violence. For similar reasons, rates of PTSD are sky-
high in refugees from countries torn by violence. For example, according to a
2005 study by Grant Marshall and colleagues in the Journal of the American
Medical Association, more than 60 percent of a group of Cambodian refugees
who resettled in the United States two decades ago exhibited PTSD symptoms.
PTSD in children and teens
No matter how hard they try, parents can’t always shield their kids from
trauma. Fires and earthquakes shatter the worlds of children as well as
grownups, and so do car accidents, disease, and acts of terrorism. As a
result, millions of kids and teens have a PTSD diagnosis, and millions more
have undiagnosed PTSD symptoms. (See Chapter 3 for more on kids and
PTSD.) Here are some statistics on the toll PTSD takes on youngsters:
 Of all children, 14 to 43 percent experience at least one traumatic event.
 Of these children, 3 to 15 percent of girls and 1 to 6 percent of boys
exhibit PTSD.
 Of children who witness a school shooting, 75 percent develop PTSD.
 Among sexually abused kids, 60 percent develop PTSD, and so do more
than 40 percent of physically abused kids.
13
Chapter 1: The Invisible Epidemic of PTSD

Those numbers are hefty but don’t tell the whole story because many chil-
dren show few or no signs of PTSD after a trauma until years later, when they
reach adulthood and grownup pressures cause symptoms to kick in. (For
more on this condition, called delayed PTSD, see Chapter 2.)
Trauma Triggers: The Most 
Common Causes of PTSD
PTSD, as I explain in Chapter 2, stems from an experience that horrifies and
overwhelms you. That experience can be anything from a hurricane to a ter-
rorist attack to the very private moment of hearing a doctor say that you
have a life-threatening disease. PTSD can begin after a tour of duty in a war
zone, or it can strike after a freeway accident or sexual assault. What’s more,
the same event can cause PTSD in one person and leave another unscathed,
for reasons I talk about in Chapter 2.
Although many types of catastrophes can cause PTSD, some life crises are far
riskier than others. Figure 1-1 shows statistics on the events most likely to
trigger PTSD. Several of these events score high on the PTSD scale in part
because of their sheer magnitude. Others, although smaller in scale, make
the list because of the depth of the pain they cause.

In this section, I look at several types of these trauma-provoking events and
how they differ in their power to cause harm.
Natural disaster
Witnessing a killing or serious injury
Child’s life-threatening illness
Sudden unexpected death of family member or friend
Shooting or stabbing
Serious accident or injury
Sexual assault other than rape
Severe physical assault

Part I: The Basics of PTSD 

The ill winds (and fires, floods, tremors,
and disease) that can lead to PTSD
For most of your life, Mother Nature is a kind friend. The sun smiles on you,
the grass grows underfoot, and the river flows gently through your town. But
Mother Nature has teeth and claws, and she can turn quickly from a kindly
friend to a vicious foe. When that happens, your life can turn upside down in
an instant.
Anyone who’s watched a natural disaster unfold on TV — or worse, had to
live through one of these calamities — can understand why these events
leave a swath of PTSD in their wake. The biggest offenders, which can affect
thousands of lives in a single day, include
 Hurricanes, tornadoes, and tsunamis
 Fires
 Earthquakes
 Floods
Natural disasters often trigger PTSD because they rain so many blows on
their victims — lost homes, lost jobs, lost lives. Hurricane Katrina is a good
example. Even after the winds and floodwaters subsided, many people
remained without shelter, food, water, money, or medical aid for days.
Thousands lost their jobs, and many lost loved ones. As a result, a single
event turned into a series of traumas, and survivors suffered sky-high rates of
PTSD. (One study by Lisa Mills, reported at the 2007 annual meeting of the
Society for Academic Emergency Medicine, found that more than a third of
Katrina survivors seen at a New Orleans emergency department had PTSD —
a far higher toll than for most disasters.) Natural disasters also leave their
scars on the rescue teams who lend a helping hand after catastrophe strikes,
and many of these people experience secondary trauma (see Chapter 2) as a
result of witnessing the suffering around them.
Mother Nature doesn’t always strike with wind, water, fire, or earthquakes,
however; often, she terrorizes people in quieter ways. One powerful risk for
PTSD, often overlooked by doctors until recent years, is a serious illness
such as cancer or AIDS.
People battling life-threatening illnesses (or watching a family member go
through this experience) have very high rates of PTSD. In the Journal of
15
Chapter 1: The Invisible Epidemic of PTSD

Clinical Oncology, a 2005 study by Anne Kazak and colleagues found that
nearly 100 percent of parents of children being treated for cancer develop
some degree of PTSD and that more than half of the fathers and three-
quarters of the mothers of these children develop moderate-to-severe PTSD.
PTSD often affects people for years or decades after a serious illness, even if
the initial threat to the person’s health passes.
The human acts that can cause PTSD
On September 11, 2001, the United States witnessed an act of human cruelty
on a scale that shook the entire world. Other countries, too, have been
rocked by episodes of genocide caused by wars or terrorism. Such dark
moments in history are mercifully rare, but every single day, individual acts
of violence — armed robberies, sexual assaults, and other violent attacks —
derail the lives of thousands of people around the globe.
These acts, whether they affect thousands of people or a single life, put people
at extreme risk for PTSD. As I explain in Chapter 2, intentional acts of violence or
betrayal cut much deeper than traumas caused by the random acts of nature —
especially when these acts happen in childhood or occur over and over.

The horrific scale of abuse in America
How big of a toll do domestic violence and other
acts of partner abuse take on society? Here are
some shocking numbers offered by the National
Center for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder
(www.ncptsd.va.gov):
 At least once in their lifetimes, 20 to 30 per-
cent of American women are physically
abused by a partner.
 Each year, 1.3 million women and more than
800,000 men are physically assaulted by an
intimate partner.
 More than 200,000 women are raped by an
intimate partner each year.
 Of those in same-sex relationships, 11 per-
cent of women and 23 percent of men are
raped, otherwise physically assaulted,
and/or stalked by an intimate partner.
 More than 500,000 women and 185,000 men
are stalked by an intimate partner each
year.
 Of all women’s emergency-room visits, 30 to
40 percent are for injuries due to domestic
violence.
 Fifty percent of men who assault their
female partners also assault their children.
 Each year, 3.3 million children witness acts
of domestic violence.

The human-caused traumas that carry the highest risk for PTSD include
 Childhood sexual or physical abuse
 Rape and other forms of sexual assault
 Domestic violence
 Armed robberies and other nonsexual physical attacks
 Violent acts resulting in deaths that cause trauma in surviving relatives
and loved ones
 Torture or acts of terror committed during war
Overall, according to the National Center for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder,
the traumatic events most often associated with PTSD include the following:
 For women: Rape, sexual molestation, physical attack, being threatened
with a weapon, or being abused as a child
 For men: Rape, combat experiences, or neglect or physical abuse in
childhood
Violence also takes a huge toll on the courageous folks who put their lives on
the line every day in the course of their jobs. As we count on police officers
and soldiers to protect us from harm, we put these heroes directly in PTSD’s
line of fire. Police officers, for example, have rates of PTSD that may be four
to six times higher than those of people in the general population, and for
soldiers, the numbers are astronomical (see Chapter 2).
But although exposure to violence or abuse is a key cause of trauma, not all
human-caused traumas involve violence, and not all of them are intentional.
In fact, motor-vehicle accidents are the leading cause of PTSD in the general
population. More than 6 million road accidents occur in the U.S. each year,
causing around 3 million injuries and 40,000 deaths. Nearly one in ten people
involved in a serious accident develops PTSD, and for kids, the rate of PTSD
may be even higher. A 2000 study by Herb Schreier and colleagues, reported
at the International Conference on Pediatric Trauma, evaluated kids injured
in car crashes and other types of accidents; they found that 60 percent of the
children reported PTSD symptoms a month after their traumas, and 40 per-
cent still had symptoms six months afterward.
Other stressful events that 
occasionally cause PTSD
In the preceding two sections, I describe the catastrophes that frequently
cause trauma. But as professionals discover more about PTSD, they’re finding
17
Chapter 1: The Invisible Epidemic of PTSD

that many of life’s events that people simply think of as tough breaks — the
too-bad-but-you’ll-get-over-it kinds of events — may lead to PTSD as well.
Here are some recent findings:
 People who live through events most experts consider to be upsetting
but not traumatic have a high risk of PTSD. In 2005, Saskia Mol and col-
leagues surveyed nearly 3,000 people to find out what stressful events
they’d experienced and how many PTSD symptoms they had. The
results surprised these scientists. They expected people who’d survived
floods, hurricanes, wars, and near-death experiences to have an ele-
vated rate of PTSD, which is just what they found; but they also reported
in their article, which appeared in the British Journal of Psychiatry, that
people who lived through events most experts consider as upsetting but
not traumatic — for instance, a job loss or divorce — also had a high
risk of PTSD.
 A study of people chronically bullied on the job by bosses or co-work-
ers found that many had PTSD symptoms. Stig Berge Matthiesen and
Ståle Einarsen, reporting in 2004 in the British Journal of Guidance &
Counselling, said this finding isn’t really surprising because “a trauma-
tized person experiencing bullying at work may have a strong shattered
experience of the world as not being a just place, with a strong anticipa-
tion of future misfortune to come.” The same may be true for bullied
children, a topic researchers are now studying.

Part I: The Basics of PTSD 
Tolls of war
As professionals learn more about PTSD,
trauma-scarred soldiers are finally starting 
to get the help and the respect they need. This
change is a welcome one from past genera-
tions, when veterans often suffered in silence.
Because of that silence, many people think 
of war-related PTSD as a disease that appeared
out of the blue during the Vietnam War. 
The truth, of course, is that combat-related
PTSD occurs in every war. Here are some facts
and figures about the toll of PTSD in past 
conflicts:
 A 2005 study of Korean War veterans in
Australia reported that up to 33 percent of
those soldiers met criteria for PTSD.
 During World War II, half a million soldiers
developed battle fatigue (another name for
PTSD). In 2004, as many as 25,000 World
War II veterans still received disability com-
pensation for symptoms related to PTSD.
 Britain recently issued pardons (a little late in
the game) for about 300 soldiers executed
during World War I on charges of cowardice.
A review of these soldiers’ records indicated
that many of them actually had PTSD.

One lesson of these studies is that it doesn’t take a hurricane, a war, or a
near-death experience to trigger PTSD. The other lesson is that you shouldn’t
hesitate to seek help for PTSD symptoms, even if you don’t think your life
crises were major enough to affect you. Trauma is in the eye of the beholder,
and a life problem that may look like no big deal to an outsider may actually
be very damaging, depending on your life circumstances.
Adding It Up: The Costs 
of Untreated PTSD
Turn on the TV, and you hear public-service announcements about the perils
of untreated diabetes, heart disease, or high blood pressure. You never see a
commercial about the dangers of untreated PTSD, but you should. PTSD is a
major public health crisis, affecting more people than diabetes or asthma.
What’s more, the cost of PTSD in dollars is staggering.
As experts begin to understand just how widespread PTSD is, they’re also
starting to realize the high price of this disorder — not just for each individ-
ual sufferer but also for society as a whole. Here are just a few of the ways
that PTSD affects us all:
 Lost lives: Every year, society loses many of its best and brightest to the
pain of untreated PTSD because the disorder significantly increases the
risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior. The risk of suicide is especially
high for people who develop both PTSD and depression, unless they
receive effective treatment. (See Chapter 3 for info on the link between
these two conditions.)
 High medical costs: People who don’t get treatment for the fallout from
trauma have higher rates of disability, more physical symptoms, more
mental disorders, more medical diagnoses from doctors, and more risky
health behaviors than other people. (See Chapter 3 for info on the health
problems that PTSD causes.) The costs of untreated trauma-related alco-
hol and drug abuse alone are estimated to be $160 billion per year in the
U.S. (Chapter 7 explains the substance abuse/PTSD link.)
 Legal woes: The out-of-control veteran on a shooting spree is a destruc-
tive Hollywood stereotype (see Chapter 17), but PTSD frequently does
play a role in criminal behavior. PTSD can impair judgment, self-esteem,
the ability to plan for the future, and the ability to control anger, putting
people at increased risk for impulsive or destructive behavior. More
than 60 percent of Vietnam combat vets with PTSD, for example, have a
history of at least one arrest after returning from the war. Studies show
that PTSD is a strong risk factor for both adult crime and juvenile delin-
quency and that it plays a powerful role in steering people into prostitu-
tion, drug dealing, and pathological gambling.
19
Chapter 1: The Invisible Epidemic of PTSD

 Poor work performance and, in turn, lost jobs: PTSD can impair a
person’s concentration and productivity, create problems in getting
along with co-workers, and trigger emotional outbursts on the job. All
these factors, as well as the health problems associated with PTSD (see
Chapter 3), can make it hard for people with PTSD to get and keep jobs,
resulting in higher-than-normal rates of unemployment. In addition,
people with PTSD often have difficulty making upward career moves and
frequently stay stuck in a low-salary rut because of their symptoms.
Experts estimate that the United States loses $3 billion each year due to
work problems caused by PTSD.
 Family troubles: PTSD makes it hard to control emotions, empathize
with other people, cope with financial matters, and handle the day-to-
day pressures of relationships. It also ups the risk for substance abuse
and other self-destructive behaviors. Because of this, the divorce rate
for people with untreated PTSD is sky-high. In addition, children in fami-
lies dealing with untreated PTSD have more learning and emotional
problems than their peers. Rates of physical and verbal abuse are also
high in families with a member suffering from PTSD. (For ways to cope if
you’re a family member of someone battling PTSD, see Chapter 13.)
That list is scary, but as you read it, don’t be discouraged. Instead, focus on
the word untreated, because that’s the key. If you have PTSD and you get
effective treatment, your risk for all these problems drops like a rock. (See
Part III for info on medical treatments and Chapter 12 for self-help steps.)
Untreated PTSD almost always gets worse, putting you at ever-increasing risk
for medical problems, broken relationships, and loss of quality of life.
Conversely, treated PTSD almost always gets better (see Chapters 14 and 18
for some of the big and little changes you can expect). Recovery takes time
and a lot of hard work (Chapter 11 details the therapy process), but it’s well
worth the effort. Just ask the millions of happy, healthy, creative, productive,
joy-filled people who’ve left PTSD in their past.
If you’re the friend or loved one of a person with PTSD, you can also take
hope from another fact: Along with treatment, strong social support can play
a powerful role in reducing the risks of the problems I outline in this section.
(For details, see Chapters 13 and 16.) You can’t shoulder the burden of aiding
a person with PTSD all on your own — in fact, calling in the pros is essential —
but your love and support can help give a trauma survivor the courage to
break free from the chains of PTSD.

“W
e’ll always have Paris,” says Humphrey Bogart as he parts from
Ingrid Bergman in Casablanca. It’s a great movie line, and it says a
lot about the amazing gift called memory. Like Bogey, you can keep your
favorite places and people with you simply by pulling up your happy memo-
ries of them — even if they’re miles away or long-gone. Without flipping open
a scrapbook or putting in a CD, you can conjure up your newborn’s first smile
or first word, the ecstasy (or agony) of prom night, or even the aroma of
Mom’s freshly baked bread.
But memories have a dark side, too: They can make you feel devastated, furi-
ous, or humiliated (many of you just thought about prom night again, didn’t
you?), even decades after something bad happens. What’s more, bad memo-
ries seem to stick more than happy ones — and that’s especially true for ter-
rible memories like the ones that can trigger PTSD. Minor crises such as a
missed plane flight or a tiff with a friend may make you cringe when you
recall them, but these memories don’t change your life. Experience a terrible
trauma, however, and the memories can torment you for months — or much
longer — if you develop PTSD.
To understand why a single moment in time can change your life so dramati-
cally, it helps to know just what a trauma is and how it can impact you both
instantly and over the long run. In this chapter, I define what the term trauma
means, explain why trauma is very different from stress, and describe how a
trauma can turn a helpful tool — memory — into a destructive force. In addi-
tion, I look at the different forms of PTSD that can occur when a bad memory
just won’t let go, and I explain how triggers can set off the bad feelings in 
a snap.

22
Part I: The Basics of PTSD 
Looking Closely at Trauma
Every case of PTSD starts in the same way: with a trauma. The word trauma
comes from the Greek word for wound, and that’s a good definition because
trauma can wound the mind as well as the body. In this section, I look at what
trauma is, dispel some of the confusion surrounding the term, and explain
why a trauma is very different from a stressful event.
Defining trauma
Think of the word trauma, and you may conjure up a picture of a big, unusual
event — a hurricane, an earthquake, the collapse of the World Trade Center
towers. But traumas aren’t rare at all, and most of them don’t make the
nightly news. In fact, nearly all people experience at least one major trauma
in their lifetimes.
Here are the four elements that define a trauma:
 It’s an overwhelming event — large or small. The level of distress an
event causes, not the scale of the event, is what really counts. Anything
from a life-threatening illness to a huge natural disaster can cause
trauma.
 It threatens life and limb — either your own or that of someone you
love. One exception is secondary trauma, which can affect police offi-
cers, paramedics, search-and-rescue teams, and other people who
respond when a crisis occurs. At times, the sheer amount of human suf-
fering these caring professionals see can make it hard for them to func-
tion. Thus, they can experience trauma even if their own lives, or the
lives of people they love, aren’t in danger.
 It’s unexpected. Typically, a trauma — whether it’s a car accident, an
assault, or an act of nature — strikes when you’re totally unprepared.
 It’s an event that causes fear, helplessness, or horror in the person
involved. A catastrophic event, in and of itself, doesn’t always trauma-
tize a person. If you feel like you have some control over what’s happen-
ing, both physically and emotionally, then you may come through with
few psychic scars. Again, the event itself doesn’t constitute a trauma —
it’s how the event impacts you.
In short, a trauma is a dangerous, shocking event that shakes both your body
and soul. It makes you fear for your life and your safety — or the lives and
safety of the people you care about most — and it breaks down your psycho-
logical defenses and shatters your sense of security.

Differentiating between trauma 
and normal stressors
Every person has stressful moments, and those moments can be mighty
intense. For instance, if you’re pregnant, you lost your job yesterday, and the
dentist says you need a root canal, it’s a good bet that you feel stressed.
However, that doesn’t mean you’ve endured a traumatic event.
Here are three key questions that can help distinguish garden-variety stres-
sors from a severe stress-inducing trauma:
 What happened? The day-to-day stuff causes minor stress: a job dead-
line, a fender-bender, or an argument with a partner. Bigger events,
either good or bad — weddings, career changes, moves — can stress
you out even more, but they’re still part of the normal fabric of life.
Trauma, on the other hand, knocks you totally off course, at least 
temporarily.
 Did you feel in control? If someone rear-ends you on the freeway, you
get a rude shock — but after a few minutes, you pull out your cellphone
and your insurance card and start putting things back in order. If an
armed robber holds you at gunpoint, however, you have no control over
whether you live or die. The first situation merely causes a brief uptick
in your stress level; the second, however, can cause a long-term trau-
matic response.
 Can you keep your feelings in their place? If you’re stressed by day-to-
day problems, you can take a break from your anxiety by watching a
funny movie or taking your kids to the beach. In the aftermath of a
trauma, however, your feelings take over your life (at least temporarily).
You can’t simply tuck those bad feelings away and enjoy yourself.
Here’s another way to look at the difference between stress and trauma:
Stress is like a wrinkle in the rug of life, and you can step over it or straighten
it out without changing course. But trauma pulls the rug right out from under
you. Unlike simple stress, trauma changes your view of your life and yourself.
It shatters your most basic assumptions about yourself and your world —
“Life is good,” “I’m safe,” “People are kind,” “I can trust others,” “The future is
likely to be good” — and replaces them with feelings like “The world is dan-
gerous,” “I can’t win,” “I can’t trust other people,” or “There’s no hope.”
Also, although stressors and their effects pass with time, the aftershocks of
trauma continue to mount. In addition to the obvious first degree of damage
done, trauma often causes secondary wounds — for example, financial crises
after a natural disaster, broken relationships if a sexual assault leaves you
unable to trust, sadness when good friends can’t understand your trauma, or
long-term injuries after an accident — that push you further into negative
thoughts, negative actions, and a victim mentality.
23
Chapter 2: Aftershocks: When the Past Won't Stay in the Past

Normal stress and trauma differ in another big way as well: One is often
healthy, but the other is toxic. Ordinary stress, if it’s not too severe or
chronic, keeps you on your toes and challenges you to reach difficult goals.
The severe stress that follows a trauma, on the other hand, can harm you
both physically and mentally if you don’t recover from its effects.
Understanding the Three Levels 
of Reactions to Trauma
When terrible things happen, you feel powerful emotions. These feelings
aren’t fun, but they’re perfectly normal and healthy. In fact, not getting a big
jolt from a traumatic experience is actually abnormal.
Mother Nature has a good reason for making you feel bad when a crisis
strikes: She wants you to survive. The strong emotions you feel and the bad
memories you form are her way of trying to tell you, “This is a bad thing —
don’t let it happen again!” (Of course, you can’t always follow this advice,
because most traumas are beyond your control — but try explaining that to
Mother Nature.)
Although nearly everyone reacts powerfully when a trauma hits, these reac-
tions fade quickly in some people and persist for a long time in others. In gen-
eral, reactions to a negative event take three different forms: a normal stress
reaction, acute stress, and PTSD. In the following sections, I explain each of
these reactions.
The typical stress response
In a typical response to stress, you may experience physical reactions, such
as a racing heart or trouble sleeping. And because being upset when some-
thing bad occurs is pro-survival, nearly everyone feels some or all of the fol-
lowing emotions when involved in a crisis (see Chapter 5 for an in-depth look
at these reactions):

These feelings can be very powerful and may last for days, weeks, or even
months, depending in part on the scale of the distressing event. The key
factor that differentiates these typical stress responses from the other types
of stress reaction is that they typically fade over time instead of staying the
same or becoming worse.
25
Chapter 2: Aftershocks: When the Past Won't Stay in the Past

Of course, not all post-trauma feelings are bad ones. You may also feel relieved,
happy to be alive, and proud of how you handled yourself — as well as
stronger for weathering the crisis. Most people feel a mixture of positive and
negative feelings, and recognizing them as perfectly normal can really help.
Acute stress disorder
In many cases, people don’t just adjust to the “new normal” in the days right
after a trauma. As many as one-third of trauma survivors continue to experi-
ence very serious symptoms that significantly interfere with their lives
instead of fading away in a few days or weeks.
According to the textbook definition, acute stress disorder starts within four
weeks of a trauma, lasts between two days and a month (if symptoms last
longer than that, the diagnosis is PTSD), and causes symptoms so severe that
they interfere with a person’s ability to handle normal, day-to-day activities.
In real life, however, it’s not so easy to draw a line on the calendar and say,
“This is a typical response to trauma, and this isn’t.” Deciding whether a
symptom is normal or a red flag for serious problems isn’t easy, either.
One way doctors make that decision is by looking at how serious symptoms
are. Typically, symptoms of acute stress disorder are much more severe than
a normal stress reaction. Here’s a list of the most common symptoms of
acute stress disorder:
 Dissociation, in which you may experience changes in your sense of self,
your sense of time, and/or your memory; these changes can include
• Feeling spaced out or in a daze.
• Feeling like the world around you is unreal. Your sense of time may
speed up or slow down, familiar places may seem alien, and people
or objects may seem like they don’t really exist. Some people say
they feel like they’re watching a movie rather than living real life.
• Unusual body sensations, as if you’re looking at yourself from a
distance or part of your body is split off from another part.
• A numb feeling, as though your emotions are turned off.
• Amnesia involving large parts of the trauma or its aftermath.
 Severe anxiety and hypervigilance — that is, an inability to let your
guard down
 A strong desire to avoid people, places, or things associated with the
trauma
 Flashbacks (see Chapter 3) and nightmares about the event
26
Part I: The Basics of PTSD 

Because acute stress disorder is a risk factor for PTSD, you should tell your
doctor if you have any of the symptoms listed. The doc can help you determine
whether you’re experiencing a normal stress reaction or a response that 
warrants therapy. But beware: Not all therapies for acute stress disorder are
helpful. In Chapter 4, I explain what usually works and what doesn’t.
Post-traumatic stress disorder
PTSD has a lot in common with a normal stress reaction; the big difference is
that it’s a much more powerful response, and it doesn’t go away. PTSD also
looks a lot like acute stress disorder — in fact, acute stress disorder becomes
PTSD, diagnostically speaking, if symptoms last more than a month.
PTSD and acute stress disorder share three key symptoms: intrusive
thoughts about the trauma, hypervigilance (always feeling like you’re on red
alert), and avoidance of places, people, or things that remind you of your
trauma. One textbook difference between PTSD and acute stress disorder,
however, is that the dissociative symptoms of acute stress, which I mention
27
Chapter 2: Aftershocks: When the Past Won't Stay in the Past
Giving stress a name: The behind-the-scenes
battle over terminology
Pity the poor psychiatrists: They need to clearly
define disorders that can’t easily be captured on
paper. To steal an old folk song lyric, this task is
about as easy as trying to catch the wind.
Two good examples showing the difficulty of
putting a name to a mental disorder involve
acute stress disorder and PTSD. Acute stress
disorder becomes PTSD if symptoms last more
than a month. However, the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual (DSM) — the bible of psy-
chiatry diagnoses — states that to have acute
stress disorder, you need to have a symptom
called dissociation (feeling disconnected from
yourself), which isn’t necessary for PTSD.
Why? Because when doctors wrote the defini-
tions for these problems, they thought that 
dissociation in the early weeks after a trauma
strongly predicted PTSD and thus helped to dif-
ferentiate between normal stress that would
fade and abnormal stress that wouldn’t. Now,
however, many studies fail to support this idea.
As a result, some doctors don’t think dissocia-
tion should be a criterion for acute stress disor-
der — and some don’t think acute stress
disorder should even be a diagnosis at all.
(Instead, they think all severe post-traumatic
stress reactions should fall under the umbrella
of PTSD, with different categories for short-
term and long-term symptoms.) So don’t be sur-
prised if the definitions I outline in this section
are passé by the next time psychiatrists revise
the DSM.

in the preceding section, don’t need to be present for a diagnosis of PTSD,
although they can be. (The reason for that is a little complicated — see the
sidebar in this section on “Giving stress a name: The behind-the-scenes battle
over terminology” if you’re interested. Just think of PTSD as acute stress dis-
order that doesn’t go away within a month or so after your symptoms begin,
and don’t worry too much about the details.)
Some general hallmarks of PTSD
If the symptoms you develop after a trauma don’t start melting away within
one month after they begin, then you may have PTSD. However, having symp-
toms after the one-month mark doesn’t necessarily mean that your symp-
toms won’t improve. Some people experience stress symptoms for several
months and then recover completely; others do well at first and have prob-
lems later on.
That said, doctors do have some rules of thumb for identifying PTSD when it
sets in. Here are two hallmarks of PTSD:
 It seriously interferes with your life. Typically, normal stress reactions
are powerful, but they don’t stop people from going to work or school,
fixing dinner, or shopping for groceries. When PTSD kicks in hard, doing
these everyday things can be a challenge.
 It lasts a long time. Doctors who go by the book don’t diagnose PTSD
until symptoms last at least a month.
The two primary types of PTSD: Simple and complex
Della begins showing symptoms of PTSD after she lives through a huge hurri-
cane that destroys her house and car. Jenny, on the other hand, develops PTSD
after suffering more than a decade of abuse at the hands of her stepfather.
Both of these women have the same diagnosis, but they may have very differ-
ent symptoms and need very different types of therapy. That’s because Della
is likely to have simple PTSD, which typically stems from a single trauma.
Jenny, however, is at risk of developing complex PTSD (sometimes called —
how’s this for psychiatric jargon? — disorders of extreme stress, not otherwise
specified, or DESNOS for short). Here’s how the two differ:
 Simple PTSD: This type of PTSD typically starts after a single event —
for instance, a car accident, a physical attack, or a natural disaster. The
symptoms of simple PTSD, which can be mild or serious, match the clas-
sic triad of symptoms that I describe in Chapter 3 (intrusive thoughts
about the trauma, a nervous system that’s always on high alert, and
avoidance of reminders of the trauma). Simple PTSD responds well to
basic treatments, and cognitive behavioral therapy (see Chapter 9) and
related approaches can be quite effective in reducing its symptoms —
often without the need for other intervention.
28
Part I: The Basics of PTSD 

 Complex PTSD: Complex PTSD can occur when people suffer repeated
traumas, particularly when these traumas occur at the hands of another
person. It’s especially likely to occur if these traumas occur in childhood
and involve vicious acts by others (such as torture) or abuse by a close
friend or family member. Here are some of the most common causes of
complex PTSD:
• Childhood sexual or physical abuse or extreme neglect
• Urban violence — for example, growing up in a gang war zone and
witnessing many shootings or other acts of violence
• Chronic abuse at the hands of a spouse or partner
• War-related traumas, including torture, the devastation of a
person’s community or country, or witnessing acts of genocide
These chronic psychic wounds can change people, both emotionally and
physically, in ways that differ from the effects of a single trauma. That’s why
survivors with complex PTSD often have more symptoms and require a wider
variety of interventions than other people with PTSD. It’s also why treat-
ments that work well for simple PTSD can sometimes be harmful for people
with complex PTSD (see Chapters 8, 9, and 10 for more on treatments).
But take heart — complex PTSD, just like simple PTSD, is treatable. If you
have this type of PTSD, finding the right path to healing may just take addi-
tional time and work.
A further category breakdown: PTSD types based on symptom duration
Earlier in the chapter, I mention that acute stress disorder lasts from two
days to four weeks, at which point it’s referred to as PTSD. But there’s more:
Doctors also divide PTSD into three further categories, based on the duration
of the symptoms.
If this classification seems a little silly, it is. In real life, these tidy metrics don’t
really make sense. But scientists find them handy when they’re doing research
into PTSD, and these categories may affect your diagnosis or insurance cov-
erage as well. Here’s a breakdown of the three official timelines for PTSD:
 Acute post-traumatic stress disorder: A term used when the duration of
symptoms is less than three months
 Chronic post-traumatic stress disorder: A term used when the duration
of symptoms is more than three months
 Delayed post-traumatic stress disorder: A category describing cases of
PTSD in which symptoms don’t start until six months or longer after a
trauma occurs (a fairly rare event, most often seen in combat vets and
people abused as children)
In Chapter 3, I outline the symptoms of PTSD in depth.

Considering Factors That Influence 
a Person’s Response to Trauma
Two vacationers, relaxing after a big day of sightseeing, decide to go out for a
late-night snack. As they stroll from their hotel to a pizza joint around the
corner, they run into an assailant who robs them at gunpoint.
Two years later, one of the vacationers returns to the same hotel and even
pops into the same pizza place for dinner. Asked about the trauma, she
shrugs off the incident, saying, “It was pretty scary, but at least nobody got
hurt.” But she’s wrong: Her friend, who also survived the robbery, doesn’t
stay in hotels any more. He’s afraid to travel, suffers terrible dreams about
the trauma, and sometimes has flashbacks in which he feels like he’s right
back there on that dark street, with a gun in his face.
Why did one of these people but not the other develop PTSD symptoms?
Forget the idea that it’s because one person is stronger or braver than the
other. In reality, the more we find out about PTSD, the more we discover that
a wide range of factors — none of which has anything to do with being
“weak” — can put a person at risk for this problem. In this section, I explain
how biology, social supports, the type of trauma, and other factors play a key
role in determining who recovers quickly and who develops PTSD.
Pre-trauma facts about you
You’re not like anyone else — and that means your risk for PTSD is different
from your neighbor’s or your best friend’s. In fact, a host of variables, from
your gender and life history to your brain structure and genes, can affect
your odds of developing PTSD. Here’s a quick look at some of the factors that
play a big role in whether you develop PTSD after a trauma occurs.
Your age
They say you’re only as old as you feel, but age isn’t just a state of mind with
PTSD — it’s also one factor that plays a role in whether you develop long-
term problems after a trauma. Anyone, young or old, can develop PTSD.
However, people in these two categories may be at higher risk:
 Young children, especially if a trauma separates them from their 
families: Kids often don’t have the life experience to prepare them for 
a crisis or the thinking skills to understand what’s happening, and the
terror they feel — especially if Mom or Dad isn’t there or isn’t able to
take charge — can be crushing. However, strong support from parents
or other family members (either at the time of the crisis or later on) can
buffer life’s blows to a great degree.
30
Part I: The Basics of PTSD 

 Middle-agers: This is a surprising high-risk category, but research con-
sistently shows that the 40-to-60 age group is at increased risk for PTSD
after a trauma. One possible reason: Because the sandwich generation is
dealing with both kids and aging parents, they have more burdens to
carry when a trauma strikes.
Seniors, on the other hand, often fare quite well when a crisis hits, especially
if they’re in good physical shape. A lifetime of surviving hard knocks appar-
ently gives them the perspective they need to deal emotionally with traumas
that can leave other people reeling.
Your life circumstances
A mix of different life circumstances can factor into your risk of developing
lasting problems after a traumatic experience. Here’s a sampling:
 You have a lot of stress on your plate. Here’s one that pretty much goes
without saying: If you have a huge pile of stress weighing you down
already, a big life crisis can be the final straw — so the bigger your sack
of troubles before a trauma, the greater your PTSD risk.
 You’re coping with a mental health disorder. Not surprisingly, if you’re
dealing with psychiatric issues before a trauma happens — for instance,
if you’re depressed or have an anxiety disorder — a trauma is more
likely to knock you for a loop.
 You’re a parent. Being a mommy or daddy can add to your risk of
having a long-term reaction to a trauma. That’s probably because — as
any parent knows — you worry more about your kids than yourself.
 You aren’t financially stable. Money problems can make any crisis
more traumatic because they add an extra layer of stress (“How can I
afford new furniture now that ours is ruined?” “What’ll we do about the
doctor bills?”). If you’re well-to-do, on the other hand, you have a lower
PTSD risk. In large part, that’s because a natural disaster doesn’t affect
you as much financially, and you can call on a lot of help to get your life
back on track. Higher education also reduces your risk a bit.
 You tend to see the glass as half-empty. Several personality traits — for
instance, a negative outlook on life or paranoia — appear to up your risk
of getting PTSD; a sunny and optimistic personality may reduce your
risk. Even the most Pollyanna-ish of people can develop PTSD, however,
if a trauma is big enough or you have enough other risk factors.
In addition to the preceding personal situations, your ethnic group weighs in
as well — different ethnic groups have differing risks for PTSD, possibly due
to cultural or socioeconomic factors.
Your gender
Women are more than twice as likely as men to develop PTSD when a trauma
involves a physical assault, whether it’s a sexual assault or another form of
31
Chapter 2: Aftershocks: When the Past Won't Stay in the Past

violent attack. Many studies (although not all) also show that women react
more strongly to other forms of trauma, such as natural disasters.
Why does gender cause such a big difference in a person’s risk for PTSD? No
one knows for sure, but here are some reasons scientists suggest:
 Women are physically smaller, so any crisis threatens their safety more —
especially if it’s a physical assault.
 Rape, one of the most terrible of traumas, affects far more women 
than men.
 Women often react even more strongly than men if a crisis involves their
children.
 Xena the Warrior Princess aside, women tend to be less aggressive than
men. Thus, when they experience a physical assault, they’re less likely
to be an active participant and are more likely to feel a lack of control
over the situation.
 There’s some evidence that the higher your rate of empathy for other
people’s suffering, the higher your risk of PTSD after a trauma — and
although guys can be sensitive, too, women have a big edge when it
comes to empathy.
 Women often have different symptoms than men. For instance, women
may exhibit more stress — an easily-identified PTSD symptom — while
men may turn to drugs or alcohol or may exhibit more anger. In addi-
tion, women often are more willing to own up to PTSD symptoms than
men are. (Maybe it’s the John Wayne macho prohibition against appear-
ing weak that holds men back.) Thus, doctors probably find diagnosing
PTSD in women to be easier.
Here’s another odd gender-related tidbit, for what it’s worth: If you’re a
woman, having a spouse in the house actually can increase your PTSD risk
when a crisis happens, especially if your hubby is highly stressed. The
reverse, however, isn’t true: Men fare just as well if there’s a better half in the
picture.
Your genes
Genes appear to play a role in PTSD, but no single “PTSD gene” gets the
blame when someone can’t bounce back after a terrible life crisis. Instead,
scientists speculate that a host of different genes — probably in different
combinations in different folks — interact to increase or decrease the risk of
PTSD, possibly by altering levels of brain chemicals associated with stress.
32
Part I: The Basics of PTSD 

So far, experts don’t have any hard data to pin down any specific genetic cul-
prits. However, they have indirect evidence (based on studies of twins) that
genes influence PTSD risk. Twin studies are neat because they allow scien-
tists to compare identical twins (who share all their genes) to fraternal twins
(who share half) and to non-twin siblings. By doing this, scientists can
unravel the effects of genes and upbringing.
Most twin studies of PTSD rely on info from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry,
and these investigations show a substantial effect of genes. One study of civil-
ian male and female twins reported similar findings. In addition, studies show
a strong influence of genes on PTSD-related problems such as alcoholism,
drug dependence, panic disorder, and depression.
Your biochemistry
Best anyone can tell, PTSD stems from a normal stress reaction that just
doesn’t know when to quit. In other words, a person’s internal stress switch
gets stuck in the on position in PTSD because the normal mechanisms that
flip this switch to off aren’t working.
Just as with genes, scientists can’t point a finger to any single chemical that
goes haywire in the same way in every person with PTSD. However, some
clues do point to abnormal levels of certain natural body chemicals as a risk
factor for PTSD symptoms. For instance, researchers know that the fight or
flight hormone, adrenaline (also called epinephrine), plays a key role (see
Chapter 5 for a discussion of its effects and how new medical treatments may
help to block them). So, most likely, does a hormone called cortisol (see the
nearby sidebar “The cortisol connection”). Somewhere along the line, the
feedback loops that control these and related chemicals go haywire, sending
out too much or too little of them. Genes, life experiences, gender, and other
factors add into the mix, increasing or lowering the risk that the chain of
events kicked off by a trauma will end in PTSD.
Your brain structure
When researchers look at the brains of people with and without PTSD, they
see some interesting differences. However, there’s a big chicken-and-egg
problem: Do these differences increase your risk for PTSD, or do they result
from PTSD? It’s a question experts can’t answer for sure yet, although they
have some clues.
One of the most consistent findings in people with PTSD is that many of them
have a smaller-than-average hippocampus. The hippocampus (see Figure 2-1)
is a little seahorse-shaped part of the brain. There’s one on the left side of
33
Chapter 2: Aftershocks: When the Past Won't Stay in the Past

your brain and one on the right. This little brain region is a hard worker
whose main job is to help you store new memories. Unfortunately, it’s also
highly susceptible to stress.
But here’s the question: Does the stress of a trauma and its aftermath cause
the hippocampus to shrink in people with PTSD, or is it the other way
around? That is, are people with small hippocampi (that’s the plural) more
prone to develop PTSD after a trauma? Or — another possibility — could a
mix of both scenarios occur?
Here are some studies that come down on different sides of this issue:
 A few years ago, a twin study looked at two groups of men. The first
group included Vietnam vets who developed PTSD and their non-vet
twins who didn’t have PTSD. In the second group were vets who 
didn’t develop PTSD and their non-vet twins (who also didn’t have
PTSD).
The study found that the military vets with PTSD had smaller hip-
pocampi than the vets without PTSD (no surprise there). But here’s the
kicker: their non-combat twins also had smaller hippocampi than either
the non-PTSD military vets or their twins. So this study clearly pointed
to a small hippocampus as a risk factor for PTSD.
 On the flip side, many studies show that chronic elevation of cortisol, a
stress-related hormone (see the preceding section), can damage brain
cells and lead to a smaller hippocampus. These studies point the finger
at the trauma itself and the resulting stress as the causes of hippocampal
shrinkage.
To complicate the picture even more, some studies show differences in the
size or function of other brain areas in people with PTSD. One key region that
may be different in people with PTSD is the amygdala (see Figure 2-1), which
alerts you to “watch out!” if something scary happens.
The short story is that in some but not all people with PTSD, experts see 
significant differences in brain structure or function. But until they sort out
the chicken-and-egg question, no one will really know what it all means. They
can say, however, that the symptoms of PTSD mesh in several ways with
abnormalities in these brain areas. For instance, many people with PTSD have
memory problems that can go hand-in-hand with impaired hippocampal func-
tion, and abnormalities in either the structure or function of the amygdala
can trigger abnormal fear or anger responses.
34
Part I: The Basics of PTSD 

The type of trauma you experience
Traumatic events come in all shapes and sizes, from traffic accidents to tor-
nadoes. Some pass quickly; others last for hours or keep recurring. Mother
Nature gets the blame for many, but human predators cause an enormous
amount of suffering as well.
Each trauma is one-of-a-kind, and some events have more potential to do
long-term psychic damage than others. Here are some of the key factors that
influence how traumatic a trauma is in terms of causing PTSD symptoms:
 The severity of your trauma: A trauma that ends quickly, with no lasting
physical injuries to anyone, usually doesn’t pack as much PTSD punch
as one that causes injuries or deaths — especially when these terrible
events involve loved ones.
Traumas that cause long-term physical pain also up the odds for PTSD,
as do life crises that cause serious financial problems — for instance, a
flood that washes away a person’s house, an earthquake that destroys a
family business, or a hurricane that devastates an entire community.
Traumas that separate a child from Mommy or Daddy can also raise the
odds of long-term reactions.

Chapter 2: Aftershocks: When the Past Won't Stay in the Past

 The cause of your trauma: If Mother Nature shattered the calm of your
life in the form of a hurricane or an earthquake, that’s bad enough. What’s
worse, however, is a trauma caused by another human being, such as a
sexual assault or an armed robbery. Worse yet is an attack by someone
you love and trust (for instance, a sexual assault by a parent or a trusted
friend), especially if this betrayal occurs when you’re very young.
 The surprise factor: Traumas that strike with no warning are riskier than
the ones that offer at least a little heads-up. For instance, if TV news-
casters warn you for days that a hurricane’s coming, the actual event
may shock you far less than a trauma that catches you totally off-guard.
However, if an expected catastrophe hits much harder than you antici-
pate, the shock can be overwhelming — as when Hurricane Katrina
struck New Orleans.
 The degree to which the trauma violated your personal boundaries:
Your body belongs to you and you alone, and you should feel safe in
your own skin. If a sexual assailant or armed robber attacks you, the
shock of this breach to your personal boundaries can increase the odds
of developing serious PTSD symptoms. That’s why rape is one of the
leading causes of serious PTSD symptoms.
 The number of traumas you’ve suffered: If you already survived one
trauma, you may be at greater risk for PTSD when a second one occurs —
even if the second trauma is entirely unrelated. The worst-case scenario
occurs when people suffer repeated traumas for weeks, months, or years
(for instance, if they live with an abusive spouse or suffer years of abuse
as a child). This repeated trauma can set a person up for complex PTSD,
which can cause more-severe symptoms than simple PTSD (see the ear-
lier section “The two primary types of PTSD: Simple and complex”).
On the other hand, getting through a natural disaster can sometimes make
you better-prepared if another, similar crisis strikes. (And interestingly,
veterans with PTSD actually reported having fewer symptoms in the
aftermath of September 11. Nobody’s sure why, but one guess is that the
sense of patriotism and togetherness reduced their sense of isolation.
That’s in line with evidence that increased social support can reduce
PTSD symptoms.)
 The chance that the trauma will reoccur: After September 11, people
close to Ground Zero battled two emotional stressors: the aftereffects of
the World Trade Center collapse and the fear that terrorists may be plan-
ning another attack. The massive initial trauma created a huge risk for
PTSD, and being on red alert for weeks afterward magnified that risk.
Similarly, people victimized by stalkers or abusive spouses, or fighting in
an ongoing war, can’t simply relax and recover from a first trauma because
they know the next one may be waiting in the wings. Their chronic
hypervigilance ups the odds of symptoms setting in for the long run.
36
Part I: The Basics of PTSD 

After the trauma: The influence of others
Whatever problems you face, from minor setbacks to major life crises, good
buddies and loving family members can help you cope. That’s especially true
when an overwhelming trauma strikes and you need all the help you can get.
Studies show that strong support from friends and family, both before and
after a trauma, can lower your odds of developing PTSD. That makes sense
because your loved ones can offer moral support, healing humor, a sympa-
thetic sounding board, and a lot of practical help — from dealing with insur-
ers to keeping your groceries stocked or watching your kids.
37
Chapter 2: Aftershocks: When the Past Won't Stay in the Past
The strong link between war and PTSD
Combat is the perfect storm of risk factors for
PTSD, so it’s no surprise that nearly 10 percent of
combat soldiers returning from current battle
zones have at least some PTSD symptoms. War
is a mix of primal fear, physical and emotional
stress, guilt at taking lives even if the cause is
just, and anger or grief when comrades die. 
It’s intense, it often involves multiple traumas,
and there’s no chance to say, “Okay, I’ve had
enough — I’m outta here.” Add in often-primitive
living conditions, the tender age of many com-
batants, and their worries about returning to “the
world” — especially a world that rarely gives
combat veterans their due — and it’s easy to see
why PTSD injures more soldiers than combat
itself.
A few features of combat trauma, however,
actually reduce the risk of PTSD or increase the
odds of getting early diagnosis and treatment.
Among these protective factors are the following:
 Soldiers in battle are in it together and can
offer each other powerful moral support.
 Soldiers in today’s volunteer military may
feel more committed to their job and the
cause they’re fighting for than soldiers back
in the days of the draft.
 Doctors look harder for signs of PTSD in
veterans than in civilians, so getting a diag-
nosis is sometimes easier if you’re a vet.
By the way, one misconception about PTSD in
vets is that it happens only to people who
directly experience combat. However, people in
non-combat roles can experience severe
trauma as well. Doctors and nurses in field hos-
pitals, for instance, can be overwhelmed by the
terrible injuries they see and the grief of losing
many of their young patients — along with the
guilt they feel over not being able to save every
life. (Intellectually, they know that’s not possible,
but the mind doesn’t always listen to facts.)
Not all people traumatized by war wear uni-
forms, of course. Armed conflicts also create an
epidemic of PTSD among people uprooted from
their homes, injured or terrified by bombings,
and threatened with starvation or financial ruin.
More than most other traumas, war turns entire
communities upside down, leaving people with
desperate needs and nowhere to turn for help,
so you can easily see why the wounds of war
don’t always heal when peace arrives.

Of course, that doesn’t mean you’ll get PTSD if you don’t have a lot of connec-
tions. It does mean, however, that you should tally up your human resources
after a trauma — whether it’s a church group, your co-workers, or close
friends and family — and see who you can call on for aid and assistance.
The opposite side of this coin, of course, is that an abusive or unsupportive
family can up your risk for PTSD. (That’s why your best bet is to avoid toxic
people as much as possible, especially if your life is in chaos after a trauma —
see Chapter 7 for details.) It appears, too, that wonderful parents can also
have kids at higher-than-normal risk for PTSD if the parents themselves suf-
fered a terrible event. For example, children of Holocaust survivors have an
increased risk of PTSD, possibly because hearing their parents’ stories
stripped these children of their sense of security very early in life.
On a larger scale, how well you fare after a trauma also depends on how your
community and your society treat you. If your neighbors (or your country)
can grasp the magnitude of the suffering you experienced, express their grati-
tude if your trauma occurred in the line of duty, and support you as you
recover, then the odds are strongly in your favor. If not, however, your risk of
PTSD can climb steeply.
Other points to remember about risk factors
At this point, you may feel worried if you have several of the PTSD risk fac-
tors I list. If so, make sure you remember three things:
 Risk factors aren’t destiny. If you don’t have PTSD now, the odds are
against your developing the disorder if you experience a major life crisis —
even if you have quite a few of the risk factors I outline in this chapter. And
if you do have PTSD, none of these factors will prevent you from progress-
ing on your path to healing.
 Many risk factors aren’t cast in stone. For example, one of the most
powerful risk factors is lack of social support — and that’s a factor you
can change. If you live alone or your friends and family aren’t support-
ive, you can make new connections through support groups, recreation
centers, church groups, or even online communities. Granted, making
friends when you’re overcoming PTSD isn’t always easy, but the benefits
can be well worth the effort.
 Research findings about risk factors are actually good news for you
because this information may lead to new treatments or even cures.
For instance, identifying some people’s wacky cortisol reactions to stress
is helping doctors develop new drugs to rein these reactions in. As they
say, every cloud has a silver lining — and the lining here is that insights
into the roots of problems can jumpstart the process of solving them.
38
Part I: The Basics of PTSD 

The Role That Triggers Play
PTSD plays a lot of tricks with your memory. It can make you forget parts of
your trauma (see Chapter 3 for info on the amnesia that can accompany
PTSD). It can cause time skew, in which the chronological order of events
during a trauma gets mixed up in a person’s mind (many kids with PTSD
experience time skew — see Chapter 3). It can also mess with your short-
term memory, making it hard to remember to pick up the dry cleaning or take
the dog for a walk (see Chapter 12 for ways to deal with this problem.) But
the worst game PTSD plays with your memory is to keep dredging up bad
memories and throwing them in your face instead of filing them away in a
mental folder marked “over and done with.”
Often, traumatic memories lie dormant for days, weeks, or even months, only
to resurface when a trigger occurs. This trigger, which can be anything tied to
the original trauma, can set off a cascade of physical and emotional reactions
that make the trauma survivor experience the horror of the event all over
again. This situation is called traumatic coupling — in the survivor’s mind, the
trigger is so powerfully connected to the original trauma that it cues the
same response the trauma caused.
Sometimes, spotting a trigger is easy. For instance, survivors of car accidents
often feel their hearts pound and their anxiety levels soar if they see pictures
of crashes on the news. Other times, figuring out what’s setting off symptoms
takes some detective work. (For example, one teen realized that the smell of
chlorine awakened memories of her assault, which happened in the restroom
at a public swimming pool.)
39
Chapter 2: Aftershocks: When the Past Won't Stay in the Past
The wounds of war
During the Vietnam War, half a million soldiers —
many of them kids still in their teens — faced
unmentionable terrors in faraway jungles and
then returned to a torn nation where their
former friends spat on them and called them
“baby killers.” The horrors of the war and its
aftermath left many of these young soldiers
trapped by PTSD for years — or even for the
rest of their lives.
One study showed just how destructive soci-
ety’s failure to support these veterans was.
Collecting info from nearly 250 Vietnam vets
being treated for PTSD, the study’s authors
found that homecoming stress outranked
combat exposure, childhood and non-combat
traumas, and other stressful life events as the
strongest predictor of PTSD symptoms.
The toxic fallout of these soldiers’ traumas
included high rates of shame, negative relation-
ships with other people, social withdrawal, and
resentment — symptoms that stemmed both
from the horrors they saw at war and the terri-
ble injustice done to them when they came
home deserving a welcome and got a cold
shoulder instead.

Here are some of the most common types of triggers:
 Sensory triggers: Sensory memories are very potent, and they can bring
back a flood of other memories. For a person with PTSD, triggers may
include
• Sounds such as fireworks, sirens, a car backfiring, thunder, or a
person screaming in a movie
• Sights such as a dented car fender, a fallen tree, light shining at a
certain angle, a billboard resembling one at the trauma scene, or a
photo of someone who looks like the perp who assaulted the
trauma survivor
• Tastes such as a food that a war vet once ate in-country or a spice
that reminds a survivor of the dinner she ate just before the
trauma occurred
• Odors such as the aroma of the aftershave worn by an attacker or
a whiff of freshly mowed grass that brings back memories of being
attacked in the park
• Sensations involving touch, such as a turtleneck that revives mem-
ories of being choked or a watchband that brings back a feeling of
being restrained; some women recovering from a sexual trauma
discover that an infant’s contact during breastfeeding is a trigger
 Actions: For instance, running a sprint in a phys ed class may trigger
memories of trying to escape from an attacker.
 Physically painful experiences: Experiences such as dental procedures
or the sight of blood can trigger bad memories.
 Dates: Anniversaries of the trauma — or important dates, such as a wed-
ding anniversary associated with someone the survivor lost in the trau-
matic event — can trigger PTSD.
 Stresses or emotions associated with the trauma: For instance, if a
person experienced extreme terror during a bank hold-up, any event
that causes fear — such as a near-miss on the freeway — can trigger a
flashback. If a trauma destroyed a person’s home or car, later financial
stressors, even mild ones, can trigger feelings of helplessness and fear.
 Legal proceedings following the trauma: Legal proceedings can be trig-
gers especially if the survivor needs to testify against an assailant.
 Sexual intercourse or intimate touching (kissing, hugging): Such con-
tact may trigger PTSD if the trauma involved sexual or physical assault.
 Milestones (such as reaching the teen years or heading off to college):
Because these events bring on a flurry of emotions, they’re big culprits
when it comes to dredging up memories. The onset of puberty can also
be a trigger if a trauma involved sexual abuse.
40
Part I: The Basics of PTSD 

These triggers stir up deeply disturbing emotions, which is why people with
PTSD go out of their way to avoid them. However, triggers have a big upside:
They’re the key your therapist can use to unlock the door to your trauma and
help you face it head-on and overcome it. In fact, confronting these triggers in
the safety of the therapeutic setting is almost always the first step in healing
from PTSD (see Chapters 8 and 10 for more info).

Spotting the Clues: Signs and
Symptoms of PTSD
In This Chapter
 Understanding the three core symptoms of PTSD
 Knowing the medical problems that often accompany PTSD
 Figuring out why PTSD symptoms are different for kids
T
alk to a dozen people with PTSD, and you hear a dozen different stories
about what it’s like. Here’s a sample:
I don’t date anymore. Just thinking about getting close to someone romanti-
cally makes me feel sick.
When I see a news story about a shooting, I feel my heart in my throat. It’s
like I’m right in the middle of the robbery again.
I feel so cut off from everyone. My kids say, “You just don’t care.” And you
know what? Sometimes they’re right.
These stories don’t sound at all alike — but dig deeper, and you start to see
common threads in each person’s life. Doctors can weave these threads into
a description that helps them spot PTSD, even though each person with this
problem has a one-of-a-kind story.
Before looking closely at the actual symptoms, though, a doctor who sus-
pects PTSD considers three general areas, all of which I cover in more detail
in Chapter 2:
 Whether a particular event (or series of events) kicked off the
patient’s symptoms: PTSD always follows a trauma.
 How long the symptoms have lasted: The duration of the symptoms
helps indicate whether the symptoms point to a normal stress reaction,
an acute stress reaction, or PTSD.
 The severity of the patient’s symptoms: PTSD isn’t just a nuisance; it’s a
major problem that affects every aspect of life.

After weighing these factors, doctors look for specific clusters of symptoms
that spell PTSD. In this chapter, I look at these symptoms as well as addi-
tional symptoms — both mental and physical — that aren’t part of the core
diagnosis but often come along for the ride. I also discuss how symptoms of
PTSD can look very different in children and teens than they do in adults.
The Traumatized Person’s Reality: 
Three Core Symptoms
Every medical disorder has its own signature, a pattern of symptoms that
allows doctors to make a diagnosis and plan a treatment approach. In the
case of PTSD, doctors look for three specific symptoms, which I explore in
the following sections. Every person with PTSD displays these three core
symptoms in some form:
 Intrusive thoughts
 Avoidance
 Hyperarousal
Recurring, intrusive thoughts
Normally, you can easily brush aside an unpleasant thought. If you have
PTSD, however, thoughts and emotions force their way into your mind, leav-
ing you completely at their mercy.
The intrusive thoughts that occur in PTSD almost always cause a strong
surge of emotion — anger, fear, humiliation, helplessness. When you’re
asleep, they can show up as nightmares. In the daytime, they pull you away
from present time, sometimes making you behave in ways that don’t make
sense to the people around you. The best-known type of these intrusions —
although not everyone with PTSD experiences it — is a flashback.
A flashback is a memory from your trauma that intrudes into the here-and-
now, making you feel like you’re right back in the past. Flashbacks typically
contain random bits and pieces of information — a sound, an odor, the color
of a bystander’s umbrella — rather than full-fledged memories. That’s one
reason it’s hard to make sense of these blasts from the past or gain control
over them without a therapist’s help in understanding them and putting them
in context.

Flashbacks usually involve sights and sounds (as when a soldier sees and
hears the sounds of a long-ago battle) — but they can also include smells,
tastes, or sensations of touch. Sometimes a flashback just won’t go away.
Here are some examples:
 Sheree, who survived a bad car accident years before, is sitting in rush-
hour traffic when she suddenly finds it impossible to shake the thought
“I need to escape right now, before something terrible happens.” She has
to force herself to stay in her car, when all she wants to do is run.
 Damon, a Vietnam vet, is setting a trap for a backyard gopher when he
feels an overwhelming wave of fear and nausea. The trigger: the animal’s
hole in the ground, which caused Damon to flash back to his days as a
“tunnel rat” assigned to crawl into booby-trapped tunnels containing
enemy weapons caches.
Not all intrusive thoughts involve sensory flashbacks, however. Often, people
with PTSD have other types of negative thoughts — for instance, “Other
people are out to get me” or “Nothing goes right for me” — that stem from
the trauma.
If you have PTSD, other people may mistakenly believe that a flashback or
other intrusive thought is “all in your head.” What they don’t understand is
that in reality, your whole body — not just your mind — gets in on the game.
For instance, if you have a frightening flashback, your heart usually beats
faster and your palms often sweat. That’s because you’re not just thinking
about the past; you’re reliving it.
Avoidance and numbing
After a trauma, you desperately want your terrible feelings to go away — but
when PTSD strikes, unpleasant emotions don’t just pack their bags and leave.
In fact, they often grow even stronger over time, causing you intense distress.
In order to cope, your mind tries to block or avoid these bad feelings with the
intention of protecting you from the hurt. These mind games may lead you to
change your behavior in different ways, such as the following methods:
 You may avoid going to the scene of your trauma or to places that
resemble it.
 You may avoid activities involved in the trauma. For instance, if your
trauma occurred in a restaurant, you may stop dining out.
 You may block out key parts of the trauma. (This blocking is called psy-
chogenic amnesia.)
45
Chapter 3: Spotting the Clues: Signs and Symptoms of PTSD

 You may resist taking legal action in a case involving the perpetrator of
your trauma for fear that your feelings will resurface.
 You may avoid watching television or movies for fear of seeing scenes
that remind you of your trauma.
 You may find it hard to fall asleep because you worry that nightmares
will dredge up the fears you’re trying to suppress. (And then, when
you’re awake, all you want to do is sleep as a means of escape from the
thoughts that plague you. It’s a real Catch-22!)
A related problem that occurs in PTSD is emotional anesthesia, a different
trick your mind uses to help you avoid pain. It works to some degree — but it
also makes feeling the emotions you want to feel more difficult. For example,
people who viewed themselves as outgoing, fun, warm, and loving before a
trauma often say that they now have trouble feeling an emotional attachment
to others or reacting in a normal way to life events. Here are some results of
this emotional distancing:
 It hurts relationships. You may find connecting with friends and family
to be difficult, or you may find sexual relations and intimacy unpleasant
or simply boring. If you have children or a partner, they can mistake
your emotional numbness for a lack of caring.

Part I: The Basics of PTSD 
A time-machine trip for one
It was the busiest day of the holiday shopping
season, and Lily had her hands full at the sales
counter. Suddenly, a man stepped in front of her
and demanded, “Where’s the digital camera in
your ad? I made a special trip to get it, and you’d
better have it.”
The threatening tone of his voice — just like the
tone of the man who assaulted her — caused
Lily to flash back to the night of her assault.
Suddenly, she wasn’t standing in a department
store. She was in her bedroom, with a stranger
in a ski mask in front of her.
Panicking, Lily shoved the startled customer in
the chest, knocking him into the woman behind
him. She turned and ran blindly toward the exit,
her heart pounding. After a few steps, the flash-
back faded and she realized what had hap-
pened. Behind her, she heard the angry man
say, “I ought to sue this store” — and she won-
dered whether she’d still have a job at the end
of the day.
Lily’s actions made perfectly good sense, given
the vision she saw in front of her — but they
didn’t make any sense to the camera-seeking
customer or the boss who wound up giving him
a huge discount in the hopes of forestalling a
lawsuit. Like Lily, many people with PTSD expe-
rience flashbacks that can cause behavior that
looks odd, rude, or even crazy to people who
aren’t along for the trip-back-in-time.

 It steals your joy in life. You may lose interest in hobbies and recreational
activities that you once enjoyed deeply. In addition, you may think,
“What’s the point?” when it comes to celebrating a special occasion or
looking your best.
Emotional anesthesia can also make it harder for you to conjure up the emo-
tions or enthusiasm you need to envision your future. As a result, you may
find yourself thinking, “Who cares what happens next year? I might not even
be here.” The fancy term for this kind of thinking is foreshortening, which
means that you have difficulty planning ahead and picturing where you’ll be
in years to come. Here are some signs of foreshortening:
 Short-circuited goals: You may abandon your long-term career plans
and instead settle for something that pays the day-to-day bills. Also, you
may focus on short-term romantic attachments instead of cultivating
meaningful relationships.
 Loss of interest in your health: If you can’t picture yourself being
around in 15 or 20 years, you may eat poorly, stop exercising, resume
smoking, or develop alcohol or substance abuse issues.
Hyperarousal and (possibly) 
panic attacks
When Germaine hears a car backfire, he starts shaking. Kim nearly jumps out
of her skin if the dog barks suddenly. Jack’s kids think he’s an ogre because
he can’t tolerate their shrieks of joy when they’re roughhousing.
All three of these PTSD sufferers show signs of hyperarousal, a hallmark of
PTSD. Their nervous systems stay on red alert all the time, and they can’t let
their guard down and relax. This situation causes a range of problems that
affect their relations with other people and their general well-being, such as
 Chronic irritability
 Quickness to anger
 A feeling that if they just relax and let go, something terrible may happen
 Difficulty sleeping or even resting
 Exhaustion stemming from nervous-system overload
 Heart palpitations, sweaty palms, and other types of reactions triggered
by a fight-or-flight reaction when a trigger occurs (see Chapter 2 for a
discussion of triggers)
47
Chapter 3: Spotting the Clues: Signs and Symptoms of PTSD

Hyperarousal often leads to panic attacks, which cause any, some, or all of the
following symptoms:
 Lightheadedness, as if you may faint
 A feeling that the outside world is spinning
 A rapid, irregular heartbeat
 Shallow breathing
 Tingling fingers
 Flushed skin
 Nausea
 A feeling as if you’re choking or suffocating
 An urgent and intense need to run away
 A powerful urge to scream
 A fear that you’re dying or going crazy
Panic attacks can strike at any time, even when things are going along
smoothly. They can lead to a vicious cycle, making a person with PTSD fearful
of going to any location where a panic attack occurred. In severe cases, this
can even lead to agoraphobia — a fear of leaving the house at all. (For info on
how therapists can treat the panic attacks that may accompany PTSD, see
Chapter 8.)

Part I: The Basics of PTSD 
The brain’s equation: Less feeling = less pain
Scare an opossum half to death, and it rolls over
and plays dead. The same is true for a bird
caught in a cat’s mouth or a mouse trapped by
a hawk — and something very similar can also
happen to you if you experience a trauma.
When a big scare first happens, your nervous
system sends you the message “Run away!” or
in some cases, “Fight!” If you can’t do either, it
offers a third option: “Freeze.” As a result, your
muscles feel stiff or slack and your body feels
numb. Time seems to slow down, and a strange
calmness descends on you. Your brain, expect-
ing the worst, is trying to cushion the end it
thinks is coming.
If you survive your terrible scare, this reaction
usually fades away. However, in PTSD, ele-
ments of this freezing response hang on, and
they can lead to a numb, surreal, wrapped-in-
cotton feeling.

The Result of Long-Term Trauma:
Symptoms of Complex PTSD
If you’re a survivor of multiple traumas, such as prolonged sexual or physical
abuse or torture, you may have a condition called complex PTSD (see
Chapter 2 for more on the causes of this disorder). If so, you may experience
a number of symptoms that differ from the pattern of simple PTSD stemming
from a single trauma.
If you have complex PTSD, realize that one reason you have these symptoms
is that many of them helped you survive. They may seem frightening or crazy,
but during your trauma, these symptoms made perfectly good sense. (For
instance, dissociation — feeling detached from your body — can make the
experience of childhood sexual abuse easier to survive emotionally.) The
trouble is that these symptoms are still hanging around when you need them
to go away.
Getting the symptoms of complex PTSD under control is a tougher assignment
than managing simple PTSD because complex PTSD reaches deeper into the
core of who you are, what you believe, how you feel about yourself and your
body, and how you relate to others. Here are some of the problems that often
occur in complex PTSD, although not all of them occur in every case:
 Wild mood swings and out-of-control emotions: Complex PTSD can
leave you confused about your emotions and unable to regulate them.
For example, if you were sexually abused as a child, you may react to a
loving partner by swinging from seductiveness to shame to violent
anger. Extreme depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts and behavior
are also common.
People with complex PTSD often exhibit out-of-control behavior as well,
including shoplifting, having one-night stands with strangers, gambling
away large amounts of money, spending wildly, or participating regularly
in dangerous behaviors such as speeding.
 Dissociation: When you experience this serious form of emotional
numbing, you actually feel detached from your body or yourself, as if
your life were happening to someone else. Dissociation is also a
common feature in acute stress disorder (see Chapter 2 for more info)
and can occur in simple PTSD, but it’s more common in complex PTSD.
It’s your mind’s way of saying, “It’s okay. This is happening to someone
else, not me.” But dissociation comes with a severe penalty: It makes
you feel like a shadow of a person rather than a real human being.
49
Chapter 3: Spotting the Clues: Signs and Symptoms of PTSD

 Disturbances in how you feel about yourself and your body: Complex
PTSD often involves multiple assaults on your body or your dignity, and
these can leave you with powerful feelings of shame, guilt, helplessness,
or self-disgust. These feelings sometimes result in eating disorders,
overeating, or self-injury such as cutting or burning yourself.
 Distorted feelings about the person who perpetrated your trauma: One
common result of complex PTSD is Stockholm syndrome, in which you
identify emotionally with the person who traumatized you and defend
the person’s actions. For example, you may stay with a spouse who
abuses you, justify his actions, and protect him from arrest, even if you
can safely escape the situation. (The name of this syndrome stems from
a bank robbery in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1973, during which the
hostages — held for days under terrifying circumstances — became
emotionally attached to their captors.)
 Alterations in your feelings toward other people: If you have complex
PTSD, you may be distrustful, afraid to let other people in your life,
extremely jealous, or overly needy.
 Loss of meaning in your life: Complex PTSD can leave you feeling deep
despair and hopelessness and make it hard for you to have faith in
people or the goodness of life.
To triumph over complex PTSD, you need the help of a dedicated treatment
team that can address each of your symptoms effectively. You also need to
have courage and faith, because although progress will happen, seeing major
progress can take time.

Part I: The Basics of PTSD 
Going out and beating agoraphobia
Paula Deen, a famous chef with her own TV
show, started her cooking career in an unusual
way: She made sandwiches in her home and
then sent her sons out to sell them. That’s
because she developed agoraphobia after a
series of traumas, including being held at gun-
point during a bank robbery.
Her story is a good example of how agorapho-
bia can trap a person — and it also offers hope
to anyone in the same situation. That’s because
this charming, vivacious woman eventually
overcame her fears and managed to leave her
house. But that’s not all: She also managed to
remarry, build a hugely successful career, and
introduce thousands of people to the joys of
cheese grits and collard greens.
I can’t guarantee the same result for anyone
with agoraphobia — especially the part about
becoming a famous chef! — but her experience
certainly proves that beating agoraphobia and
rediscovering the joys of the great, wide world
is possible.

Body Language: Aches and Pains 
That May Accompany PTSD
Sometimes the first person who spots PTSD is a specialist who’s looking for
an entirely different medical problem, such as a heart condition or a digestive
disturbance. That’s because the chemical changes that are part and parcel of
PTSD can affect many areas of the body, causing a wide range of symptoms.
Certain medical problems, too, have a strong association with PTSD.
The most common physical symptoms of PTSD stem from hyperarousal or
panic attacks (see “Hyperarousal and [possibly] panic attacks,” earlier in this
chapter, for more on these topics). These symptoms can include fast heart-
beat, hyperventilation (rapid, shallow breathing that can make you feel faint
or panicky), sweating, trembling, and lightheadedness.
In addition to isolated symptoms, certain diseases and disorders are often
linked to PTSD. If you’re wondering why, the answer is we don’t know. Doctors
who treat PTSD have a lot of chicken-or-egg questions, and this is one of them.
PTSD seems to increase the risk of some medical problems, such as cardiovas-
cular disease; but in some cases, a preexisting disease possibly ups the odds
that person will develop PTSD or worsens symptoms when they occur. (For
example, sleep apnea — which causes breathing problems during sleep — may
increase your risk of panic attacks, nightmares, and insomnia if you have PTSD.)
The following medical problems aren’t universal in PTSD, and they’re not
part of the basic diagnosis, but they do go hand-in-hand with PTSD fairly 
frequently:
 Cardiovascular problems, such as high blood pressure; PTSD is also
linked to an increased risk for heart attacks.
 Chronic pain, such as that occurring in fibromyalgia (muscle pain) or
headaches. Interestingly, however, many people with PTSD exhibit a
reduced sense of pain.
 Stomach pain, irritable bowel syndrome, heartburn, or chronic diarrhea
or constipation.
 Autoimmune disorders such as arthritis, asthma, or skin problems.
These disorders occur when the body mistakes its own tissues for an
invader and starts fighting its own cells.
 Obesity. According to a 2006 study by a PTSD center at a VA hospital,
“Overweight and obesity among our male veterans with PTSD strikingly
exceeded national findings.”
 Pregnancy complications. One study hinted that women with PTSD may
have more problems in pregnancy, such as miscarriage, severe nausea,
or preterm contractions.

Chapter 3: Spotting the Clues: Signs and Symptoms of PTSD

Psychological Disorders That Sometimes
Hitch a Ride with PTSD
Rates of coexisting psychiatric problems are high in people with PTSD. The
reverse is true, too: Rates of PTSD are very high in people with mental disor-
ders. Neither of these facts is really surprising, because PTSD and other
mental disorders interweave in the following ways:
 If you have a mental disorder, you’re more vulnerable to being hurt or
exploited because making rational decisions and protecting yourself is
sometimes difficult. This makes you an easy target for a trauma and, in
turn, for PTSD.
 Some mental disorders can impair brain function in ways that may make
it harder for you to logically process the memories of a trauma, height-
ening the risk for PTSD.
 PTSD can trigger mental disorders such as depression or eating disorders
in people who didn’t have these problems before their trauma occurred.
 PTSD, like any major life problem, can also worsen symptoms of a pre-
existing mental disorder.
52
Part I: The Basics of PTSD 
Double trouble: Why PTSD and other medical 
disorders often go together
Scientists are exploring the reasons PTSD
raises the odds of several medical disorders.
Here are some of their theories:
 PTSD alters levels of stress-related chemi-
cals and other brain messenger chemicals.
This change can set off a cascade of addi-
tional changes downstream, affecting mul-
tiple organs and possibly altering immune
system function.
 Abnormal elevations of stress hormones
may simply wear down the cardiovascular
system over time.
 Because people with PTSD have trouble
coping with the present and often find the
future hard to plan for, they can easily fall
into unhealthy habits such as overeating,
smoking, and lack of exercise — and these
in turn can lead to health issues.
 The same chemicals that affect the brain
often affect the digestive system in very
powerful ways. (That’s why the digestive
system is dubbed the “second brain.”) Thus,
the chemical changes that upset your mind
can also play havoc with your digestion.

Different psychological problems often require different treatments, so identi-
fying each problem on your plate — even if all your issues stem from PTSD —
can help you and your medical team to come up with the most effective way
of tackling each issue.
The good news is that treating either problem — PTSD or the coexisting
mental disorder — nearly always leads to improvements in the other problem.
For example, getting your PTSD-linked nightmares under control can ease
your depression, and treating your depression, in turn, can give you the
energy and positive attitude you need to succeed in your therapy for PTSD.
The bottom line: Just as your problems go hand-in-hand, so do their solutions.
In the following sections, I discuss some of the most common psychological
issues that can crop up in people with PTSD.
Depression
As many as 50 percent of people with PTSD have enough symptoms to war-
rant a second diagnosis of depression. We don’t know why these two disor-
ders often co-occur, but here are two logical explanations:
 PTSD can change the biochemistry and even the structure of the brain
in ways that may also promote depression (see Chapter 2).
 PTSD makes life rough and plays havoc with careers and relationships.
Sad life events, in turn, up the risk for depression.
Teasing out the symptoms of PTSD and depression can be tricky for doctors,
but differentiating between the two may result in more effective treatment.
Symptoms of depression include the following:
 Apathy
 Inability to concentrate
 A sense of hopelessness
 Insomnia or oversleeping
 A lack of interest in other people or activities
 Profound sadness
 Suicidal thoughts or actions
 Feelings of worthlessness
53
Chapter 3: Spotting the Clues: Signs and Symptoms of PTSD

If you do receive a diagnosis of depression, Depression For Dummies (Wiley)
can help you to understand your symptoms and the treatments your doctor
may recommend. In some cases, these treatments are the same as those for
PTSD. In others, they may differ; for instance, doctors are more likely to recom-
mend medications when a patient has significant depression as well as PTSD.
Anxiety disorders
The symptoms of anxiety disorders resemble the symptoms of PTSD (which,
after all, is a form of anxiety disorder itself). However, if your symptoms of
anxiety are severe enough, fall into a specific category, or existed before your
trauma, you may get an additional diagnosis of anxiety disorder. Here are
some of the possible diagnoses you may receive:
 Agoraphobia: If you’re afraid to go more than a short distance from your
home or can’t face leaving your home at all, your doctor will probably
decide on agoraphobia as a secondary diagnosis (see more about this
topic earlier in this chapter in “Hyperarousal and [possibly] panic
attacks”).
 Generalized anxiety: Your doctor may use this diagnosis if you have
many disabling worries about a wide range of topics.
 Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD): Symptoms such as rituals and
constant checking (for instance, going back to the kitchen six times to
make sure you turned off the stove) may call for a diagnosis of OCD.
Other symptoms of OCD include an obsession with germs, a compulsive
need to touch or count objects, and intrusive negative thoughts.
 Panic disorder: If you frequently experience disabling panic attacks in
which you feel like you’re dying or losing your mind, your doctor may
give you this diagnosis.
 Social phobia: An extreme fear of being around other people can warrant
this diagnosis.
Some doctors may view problems such as social phobia or agoraphobia as
part of your PTSD; others may see them as separate but related issues. Don’t
worry if the members of your medical team disagree on this score, because it
probably won’t affect your treatment — the therapy for anxiety disorders is
much like that for PTSD. Recognizing severe symptoms of anxiety can aid in
your treatment because it can guide your doctor to take even more precau-
tions to create a safe space for you before therapy begins.
54
Part I: The Basics of PTSD 

Alcohol and/or drug abuse
Rates of alcohol dependence and drug use are sky-high in PTSD. That’s not
surprising, because the disorder causes a mountain of anxiety, pain, and
heartache. When you feel bad, you need relief — and it’s easy to fall prey to a
temporary form of numbing that causes far more problems down the road.
PTSD can lead to substance abuse problems in people who never struggled
with drugs or alcohol, or it can worsen problems that already existed before
a trauma. Violent traumas put survivors at especially high risk for developing
dependency on alcohol or drugs. The highest-risk groups include veterans,
survivors of childhood abuse, and men and women who are victims of rape
or physical assault. In contrast, only about 10 percent of people traumatized
by natural disasters develop substance abuse problems.
Here are some statistics that shed a little light on the link between PTSD and
substance abuse issues:
 Thirty to 60 percent of people seeking treatment for substance abuse
problems also have PTSD.
 People with severe PTSD symptoms are at greater risk for substance
abuse problems than people with mild PTSD symptoms, indicating that
drugs and alcohol are used as self-medication.
 Between 60 and 80 percent of Vietnam vets seeking treatment for PTSD
also have alcohol problems.
To understand why millions of people with PTSD fall into the drug or alcohol
trap, consider the most prevalent reasons:
 Drugs and alcohol can temporarily numb the terrible feelings of anxiety,
fear, helplessness, hopelessness, loneliness, or anger that overwhelm
the person with PTSD.
 In social situations, drinking or drug use can allow a person to relax and
fit in — something that’s very difficult when PTSD makes connecting
with others a real challenge.
 Many people with PTSD use alcohol, street drugs, or an excess of pre-
scription drugs in an effort to combat insomnia or keep nightmares at bay.
 Drinking or drugs can temporarily soothe the pain of injuries that can’t
completely heal — a common problem for people who suffered a physi-
cally painful trauma.
55
Chapter 3: Spotting the Clues: Signs and Symptoms of PTSD

These are powerful reasons to reach for a pill or a bottle of Scotch, so it’s not
hard to see why so many strong and brave people — soldiers, firefighters, police
officers, doctors, paramedics, and millions of other trauma survivors — fall
into the snare of substance abuse. It’s an easy mistake to make when you’re
desperate to ease overwhelming suffering.
In Chapter 7, I talk more about the link between PTSD and alcohol or drug
issues. For now, the take-home message is that substance abuse — far from
being a sign of shame or weakness — is a very common symptom of the med-
ical disorder we call PTSD.
Borderline personality disorder
Borderline personality disorder, or BPD, is a fairly common diagnosis for
people with complex PTSD. It’s also very controversial because many practi-
tioners believe the symptoms of BPD stem from chronic trauma in a high per-
centage of cases and should fall under the diagnosis of complex PTSD.
Patients may receive a diagnosis of BPD from their doctors if they have five
or more of the following symptoms:
 Desperate efforts to avoid real or imaginary abandonment (for example,
many stalkers are diagnosed with BPD)
 Intense but unstable relationships, cycling between idealizing and
devaluing the other person
 A disturbed self-image or sense of self; many people diagnosed with BPD
are chameleon-like, assuming the personality traits they think other
people desire them to have
 Impulsive behaviors (for instance, compulsive spending, promiscuous
sex, substance abuse, reckless driving, or binge eating)
 Recurring episodes of suicidal behavior, gestures, or threats or self-
injurious behavior
 Extreme mood swings
 Chronic feelings of emptiness
 Inappropriate, extreme anger or difficulty controlling anger
 Episodes of paranoia (the feeling that other people are plotting against
you) or dissociation (see more on this symptom in “The Result of Long-
Term Trauma: Symptoms of Complex PTSD,” earlier in this chapter)
As you can see if you read the section on complex PTSD in this chapter, the
symptoms of PTSD and BPD overlap quite a bit. Thus, this diagnosis is a judg-
ment call on the part of a doctor or therapist. If you do receive a diagnosis of
56
Part I: The Basics of PTSD 

BPD, your therapist may suggest a form of therapy called dialectical behavior
therapy (which is different from the other treatments I discuss in Chapters 8
and 10 because it combines elements from a variety of psychological thera-
pies). He or she may also suggest medications that can reduce some of your
symptoms. However, because dialectical behavior therapy and medication
may also play a role in treating complex PTSD, don’t assume that your doctor
thinks you have BPD just because he or she recommends these approaches.
Self-injury
Some people with PTSD develop a behavior called self-injury or self-mutilation.
Typically, they make superficial cuts, burns, or needle sticks on their arms or
other parts of their body. Family members sometimes mistake this act for sui-
cidal behavior, but experts say it’s a very different kind of cry for help — a
statement saying, “I want to live.”
People with PTSD are more likely to injure themselves intentionally if they
have these risk factors:
 They’re female.
 They suffered prolonged, severe physical or sexual abuse in childhood.
 They have eating disorders or substance abuse problems.
If you engage in self-injury, you may feel very ashamed and alone. However,
you should know that self-injury isn’t crazy or bad behavior. Rather, it’s the
only escape route a mind in pain can see at the time — it’s your way of deal-
ing with pain when you can’t find any other way to cope. Here are some of
the reasons people with PTSD engage in self-injury:
 It says, “You’re real — and you’re alive.” People who feel unreal and
disconnected from the world (see the earlier section titled “Avoidance
and numbing”) can be desperate for any sign that they truly exist, and
pain can serve that purpose.
 It helps them forget the bigger pain that won’t go away. The pain
caused by self-injury acts as a counterirritant that briefly distracts a
person’s mind from the greater pain of terrible memories.
 It can create a sense of control. Intentionally injuring yourself can make
you feel like you’re in charge of one part of your life at a time when you
feel powerless in other areas.
 It creates an artificial emotional high. Injuring your body releases feel-
good chemicals called endorphins. These chemicals can help to dampen
emotional pain as well. In addition, they help ease tension and anxiety.
57
Chapter 3: Spotting the Clues: Signs and Symptoms of PTSD

 It’s a way of punishing the “guilty” — even though it actually punishes
the innocent. People who suffered abuse as children may unconsciously
feel that they’re bad people who deserve to be punished.
 It’s a way of denying the body. To a person who lived through years of
abuse as a child, the body can seem like an enemy: a source of pain,
humiliation, fear, and helplessness. Cutting the body can be a way to
deny its existence.
 It’s an S.O.S. One legacy of child abuse is secrecy. But terrible secrets
insist on battling their way to the surface — and if a person can’t talk
about her wounds, her mind may use cutting as another way to say, “I
need help.”
 It offers an excuse to receive love. A person abused as a child didn’t
get the love and nurturing he needed. He may cut himself in order to
provide an excuse to love and nurture himself.
 It can serve as a trigger for dissociation. Earlier, I explain a symptom
called dissociation, in which a person mentally disconnects from part of
the body or mind. Often, people use self-injury as a way of triggering dis-
sociation so they can temporarily escape from their problems.
Don’t let misplaced guilt or shame stop you from seeking help if you develop
self-injurious behaviors. Understand that the relief that self-injury brings is
fleeting and that the price is terrible. Self-injury is a false solution because it
only adds to shame and secrecy, increasing the toxic legacy of child abuse or
other traumas. If you have this problem, overcome the urge to hide it and
instead tell your doctor — therapy can offer you far more effective tools to
overcome the pain caused by your trauma.
Eating disorders
Eating disorders have many roots — some genetic, some cultural, and some
emotional — and PTSD is one possible trigger. The research is actually a little
murky on this topic, with some studies showing a significant connection
between PTSD and eating disorders and others showing only a weak link.
Overall, however, traumas — especially sexually linked ones — appear to up
the risk of developing an eating disorder, particularly if you’re female.
The eating disorder that’s linked most strongly to PTSD is bulimia nervosa.
People with this disorder binge on food and then vomit, exercise excessively,
or use laxatives to avoid gaining weight. Doctors also see a high rate of com-
pulsive overeating in patients with PTSD. Anorexia nervosa, a serious food
disorder in which people literally starve themselves, has weaker ties to PTSD.
58
Part I: The Basics of PTSD 

The idea that a trauma can lead to bulimia or compulsive overeating (and
perhaps to anorexia) may seem strange, but the link actually makes sense.
Here’s why:
 Overeating and eating disorders can offer distraction from problems
you don’t want to face. When you’re focused on food (either eating it or
avoiding it), you don’t have as much time to worry about other things —
such as past traumas, present fears, or worries about the future. Thus,
overeating or eating disorders can make major problems fade into the
background, at least temporarily — although they do so at a great price.
 Overeating or eating disorders can be a way of distancing other people.
People victimized by a trauma involving sexual assault or abuse may want
to reduce the risk that they’ll suffer similar pain again. One way is to
attempt to make themselves appear less attractive by gaining or losing
large amounts of weight. The message they’re unconsciously sending:
“Don’t notice me as a sexual being, and maybe you won’t hurt me.”
 Eating disorders create a false sense of control. A person who’s con-
trolling her weight through binging, purging, or starving herself feels like
she’s totally in charge of one aspect of her life. She may use this behav-
ior to restore the sense of control and security she lost when crisis
struck.
A Whole Different Ballgame: PTSD
Symptoms in Children and Teens
In some ways, kids are just little people, and teens are just younger versions
of adults. In other ways, however, the under-20 crowd is very different from
their elders. (If you don’t believe it, just look at their taste in clothes and
music!) When it comes to diagnosing PTSD, some of the adult rules apply to
children and teens, and some don’t.
Here’s what’s the same for both kids and adults (see Chapter 2 for full 
explanations):
 PTSD stems from a specific trauma or series of traumas.
 Symptoms must last for a month in order to get a diagnosis of PTSD.
The symptoms that children and teens with PTSD show, however, aren’t
always the same as those that adults exhibit. In this section, I describe extra
clues that savvy doctors look for in the younger set. Note that any child may
show a handful of these symptoms at one time or another — so don’t be
overly concerned if your child exhibits several if she’s generally happy and
healthy.

Chapter 3: Spotting the Clues: Signs and Symptoms of PTSD

Warning signs in very young children
Spotting PTSD in a toddler or kindergartener is tricky because little kids don’t
think or act like grown-ups. Thus, letting their symptoms slip under the radar
screen is easy. Here are some signs that can indicate PTSD in toddlers or
kindergarteners (with a caution that these ages are approximate and that
symptoms of different age groups overlap):

Part I: The Basics of PTSD 
When grief crosses the line into trauma
When you lose someone you love, the pain can
seem unbearable at first. But that ache, hard as
it is to endure, is part of the natural healing
process. As a wise patient of mine once said,
“Tears are the vehicle that grief uses to trans-
port someone who is dead and gone from your
life into your heart, where they live on forever.”
Not everyone, however, is able to experience
this form of healing. In some cases, a person
remains trapped in grief — a condition that doc-
tors call traumatic grief. This condition is closely
related to both PTSD and depression, and the
same treatments that are effective for these dis-
orders (see Part III) can often help.
Holly Prigerson, a leading expert on traumatic
grief, lists these warning signs of traumatic
grief:
 Preoccupation with the lost loved one
 Physical pain in the same area where the
person who died was afflicted — for exam-
ple, chest pain in a person grieving for
someone who died of a heart attack
 Intense upset at memories of the person
 Avoidance of reminders of the death
 Refusal to accept the death or a sense of
disbelief about it
 A feeling that life is empty
 Longing for the lost person
 Hallucinating that you hear or see the
person who died
 Being drawn to places and things associ-
ated with the person
 Anger or bitterness about the death
 A feeling that it’s unfair to go on after the
loved one’s death
 A feeling of being stunned or dazed
 Envy of other people’s relationships with
their loved ones
 Difficulty trusting others
 Chronic loneliness
 Lack of concern for other people
Many of these symptoms are part of the normal
grieving process, but if they don’t improve or go
away in several months, seeking professional
guidance is smart. The advice that I offer in
Chapter 16 to friends and family members of
PTSD sufferers can also be helpful for families
trying to help a person who’s experiencing trau-
matic grief.

 Fears and worries: Often, these concerns seem unrelated to the trauma.
For instance, a toddler may develop a fear of monsters and talk about
them obsessively because he can’t come up with a coherent picture of
the person or event that actually threatened him.
 Intense separation anxiety: Separation anxiety is a normal behavior
that sets in when children realize that parents can leave them. If a child
develops PTSD, this fear of separation can become very intense — to
the point that children shriek with terror if a parent leaves to go to work.
 Irrational self-blame: Young kids think the world revolves around them,
so they may believe that something they did or thought caused the
trauma. In the world of child development experts, this belief is called
magical thinking — a child’s belief that his thoughts or desires, or
actions totally unrelated to an event, made the event occur. (Of course,
you do the same thing every time you wear your lucky socks during
playoffs season!)
Here’s an example of magical thinking: A child who’s traumatized by a
parent’s car crash may believe that he caused the accident by wishing
that Mommy would quit pestering him the day before. Kids don’t usually
tell you when they have beliefs like these, so uncovering them may take
a little sensitive dialogue.
 Mood changes: A toddler with PTSD may appear withdrawn, irritable, or
even aggressive.
 An overactive startle response: Kids who once loved noise and commo-
tion may cry, scream, or even experience a complete meltdown at a loud or
sudden sound or an unexpected occurrence. These reactions can be even
more extreme if they involve sights or sounds related to the trauma — for
instance, the sound of a school bell if the crisis happened at school.
 Post-traumatic play: A child with PTSD may repeat certain elements of a
trauma when playing with toys, blocks, or dolls — for instance, by
crashing his toy cars together — or may draw pictures that show parts
of the trauma.
 Preoccupations: Often, preoccupations can involve objects that seem
unrelated to the event — for instance, a particular toy or character on TV.
 Setbacks: Traumatized tots can lose previously learned skills, such as
language, toilet training, or dressing.
 Sleep problems: Any change can trigger sleep problems in a tot, so it’s
no surprise that a traumatic change can keep a young child from falling
asleep at night or napping during the day.
 Stomachaches or headaches: These symptoms are common in kids trau-
matized by a life crisis, but make sure your pediatrician rules out other
medical causes before assuming that these symptoms stem from PTSD.
61
Chapter 3: Spotting the Clues: Signs and Symptoms of PTSD

Clues that can point to PTSD in 
elementary-school children
Like younger children, kids at the elementary-school stage may develop sleep
problems or nightmares as part of their PTSD. In addition, they may display
mood swings, anger, or aggression. They can also act “babyish,” have stom-
achaches or headaches, or act out their trauma in play or art projects.
Here are some additional signs of PTSD in elementary-school-age children.
Not all of these show on the surface, so listen for clues in your child’s conver-
sations or actions:
 Fears about safety: One common sign of PTSD in kids this age is an
obsessive concern with safety or a constant fear of death.
 Guilt: Children traumatized by an event can think that it was somehow
their fault. This mindset is a somewhat more mature version of the
“magical thinking” of toddlers (see the preceding section).
 Loss of interest in friends and activities: A traumatized child may shut
herself in her room after school each day and watch TV or play video
games instead of hanging out with her buddies or talking on the phone.
 Omen formation: Children with PTSD sometimes believe they failed to
spot warning signs of an impending trauma and that they need to be on
alert so they can prevent a repeat of the event. For instance, a child who
survived a hurricane may panic and say, “We need to go away!” when a
small storm rolls in.
 School problems: Kids may let their grades slip, act out in class, or even
refuse to go to school.
 Time skew: Kids with PTSD can seem very mixed-up about when a
trauma occurred or about the order of events during the trauma. This
idea is similar to the amnesia experienced by many adults with PTSD.
Red flags for PTSD in teens
PTSD in teens often reveals itself as acting-out behavior. That’s a big problem
because teens can express their inner pain in more dangerous ways than
younger kids (especially if they’re old enough to drive, date, or drink) and
they don’t have the self-control of adults. The following behaviors can be
warning signs of PTSD in adolescents:
 Aggression
 Impulsive behavior
62
Part I: The Basics of PTSD 

 Increased sexual behavior
 Rebellion
 Risk-taking, such as fast driving
Even if your teen is quiet after a trauma, however, don’t assume that all’s
well. Teens with PTSD can also show their distress in more subtle ways. Here
are the most common:
 Changes in friendships — for instance, dropping a lifelong friend or
hooking up with a bad crowd
 Problems with grades or school work
 An increased interest in violence-related activities (for instance, violent
video games or extreme sports)
 Depression or withdrawal
 An obsession with getting revenge on a person they blame for the
trauma
 Sleep problems and nightmares
Because teens are drama queens even when life is going smoothly, sorting
out PTSD symptoms from normal adolescent behavior isn’t always easy. One
key is to look for behaviors that are big changes from the way a teen acted
before a trauma occurred. For instance, if a once-happy 14-year-old suddenly

Chapter 3: Spotting the Clues: Signs and Symptoms of PTSD
Bad kids — or bad trauma?
The police arrested Angela two days after her
14th birthday for shoplifting a dress from a mall
store. They let her go home with her foster par-
ents after giving her a slap on the wrist, but two
months later, she got busted again — this time
for stealing a classmate’s purse. When a police
officer asked her why she committed these
acts, she simply replied, “Why not?” Her uncar-
ing manner shocked the officer, who figured her
for a bad apple.
But Angela, like many of the “bad” kids you read
about in the papers, isn’t bad at all; instead, she’s
deeply traumatized. She’s living with a foster
family because her father sexually abused her
for years, and her behavior is a way of acting out
the pain of her PTSD.
Therapists see a lot of children like Angela, and
with time and hard work, they can often get
these kids back on the road to a happier, health-
ier life. But the job is easier when everyone
involved — parents or foster parents, schools,
and the legal system — has compassion for the
terror that lies behind the I-don’t-care attitude
of the abused child who turns troublemaker.

gets heavy into Goth and starts skipping school, or if an outgoing teen quits
the soccer team and starts hiding out in his room, that’s a big red flag.
Signs of PTSD that abused kids
and teens may exhibit
In Chapter 4, I talk about the betrayal effect that occurs when a trauma hap-
pens at the hands of someone a child loves and looks to for protection.
Because this betrayal shakes a child to her core, the effects of sexual or phys-
ical abuse are much more profound for a child than the effects of other trau-
mas. As a result, abused kids can display some very severe and frightening
symptoms. These include
 Stealing
 Promiscuity or prostitution
 Running away
 Violence
 Self-injury (see additional info earlier in this chapter)
 Use of hard drugs such as heroin or cocaine, or heavy use of alcohol
 Severe depression or suicidal behavior
If you’re dealing with a child or teen who suffered abuse somewhere along
the line, recognizing the traumatic roots of violent, illegal, antisocial, or dan-
gerous behaviors is very important. By addressing these problems through
therapy when they first appear, you maximize the chances of turning a young
life around before it’s too late.

f you step on a nail, a tetanus shot can keep you safe, and if a cut puts you
at risk for infection, an antibiotic can stop nasty germs in their tracks. But
right now, doctors don’t have any magic potions to prevent you from getting
PTSD when trauma strikes. What doctors and therapists do have, however,
are some tools they think may lower your risk of developing PTSD after a life
crisis.
If you’ve experienced a trauma, you may have questions about one or more
of these preventive measures. For example, if your trauma occurred just a
few weeks ago, you may be asking whether any of these therapies can really
lower your risk of developing PTSD in the long run. On the other hand, if you
tried one of these approaches and still developed PTSD, you may wonder
why these therapies failed. Was it your fault? Your treatment team’s fault? Or
the fact that these therapies have limits and don’t work in every situation?
(The quick answers are no, no, and yes — but more on that later.)
In the following pages, I give you the scoop on the medical and psychological
interventions that doctors and therapists use right after a trauma occurs and
info on how well each one works. Remember, though, that although these
preventive measures can help a great deal, they don’t come with any guaran-
tees. If they make you feel better, excellent! If you already tried some or all of
them and they didn’t work, don’t despair. In Part III, I describe a wide range of
other therapies that can empower you to get your life back on track after a
trauma derails it.

66
Part I: The Basics of PTSD 
Be aware that nobody has all the answers about the best ways to prevent
PTSD or about the odds of succeeding in this effort. After a trauma, you get a
lot of advice — from doctors, friends, and relatives — about what you should
do. But in many ways, the best expert on this topic is you. In this chapter, I
offer you tools that can help you heal in the first few weeks after a life crisis.
Which ones you choose depends on how serious your symptoms are, on how
much support you have, and ultimately, on what you feel deep down is right
for you.
Immediate Treatments Intended 
to Reduce PTSD Risk
When a trauma occurs, doctors and therapists have two forms of instant
treatment up their sleeves. One is a common blood pressure drug that’s 
gaining new interest as a PTSD therapy, and the other is what’s called crisis
intervention.
Do either of these therapies work? The answer is a little complicated because
one therapy is very new and the other — although it’s been around for many
years — isn’t really well studied. In the following sections, I look at both of
these treatments and what doctors know (and don’t know) about them.
Propranolol, the magical pill?
Imagine a magic bullet for preventing PTSD — a little pill you pop for a few
days after a life crisis to protect yourself from any long-term psychological
harm. Does it sound too good to be true? Maybe it is . . . but maybe it isn’t.
New studies suggest that propranolol (Inderal) — the same pill that millions of
people take for high blood pressure — can prevent some trauma survivors from
developing PTSD if doctors first give it within a few hours after a traumatic
event. (Researchers don’t yet know if it can help prevent PTSD if it’s given later
than that.) The drug is still under study, but some doctors are already prescrib-
ing it as a preventive measure. The following sections explain what people know
so far about this drug’s effects and the pros and cons of using it.
How propranolol works
The memory-blocking effects of propranolol, which may take the long-term
sting out of trauma in some cases, make a lot of sense in terms of brain chem-
istry. When you live through an event that causes fear and helplessness, your

body immediately cranks out huge amounts of adrenaline — the fight-or-flight
hormone. High adrenaline levels dramatically boost your ability to remember
things, so scary stuff gets etched in deeper than run-of-the-mill events.
Propranolol, however, may short-circuit this process. Like a driver stealing
someone else’s parking place, propranalol sits on the spots on nerve cells
where adrenaline usually goes (see Figure 4-1). When this happens, adrena-
line can’t do its job. As a result, bad memories still form, but they don’t carry
as much of an emotional punch.
The scientific scoop: Exciting but unproven
The propranolol story starts with Roger Pitman, a doctor at Harvard. In 2002,
Pitman published the results of tests of this drug on a group of 22 people who
survived car accidents or other life-threatening events. When these patients
arrived at the emergency room at a Boston hospital, doctors gave eight of
them the drug within the first six hours after their crises. To enable a com-
parison, the doctors gave fake pills to 14 patients after their crises.

Chapter 4: First Response: Preventive Treatments for PTSD

Three months later, Pitman tested all 22 patients for PTSD symptoms. When
the patients listened to their own audiotapes describing their crises, not a
single person who took propranolol showed physical signs of anxiety. In con-
trast, 8 of the 14 people who got the fake pills showed strong signs of anxiety,
including pounding hearts and sweaty palms.
A French study, which tested propranolol immediately after a trauma on
patients at high risk for PTSD, also reported positive results. The study found
that nearly all patients developed some PTSD symptoms after two months —
but symptoms were only half as severe in the treated group. Only one of 11
propranolol-treated patients had symptoms severe enough to warrant a diag-
nosis of PTSD, but three of eight patients who didn’t take propranolol
received PTSD diagnoses.
More studies of propranolol’s effects on PTSD are in the works, and time will
tell whether these initial findings hold true for larger groups of patients. The
early findings about propranolol are exciting, but they’re just that — early.
And medicine is full of promises that don’t pan out, especially with miracle
drugs. Propranolol is a promising treatment, but it doesn’t help everyone —
and when it does help, it often reduces symptoms instead of preventing them
altogether. Because there’s little research on this drug’s PTSD-fighting effects
so far, doctors still don’t know who it can help, how much it can help, and
whether its effects will last. They also don’t know how long trauma survivors
need to take the drug or whether there’s a limited window of opportunity for
the drug’s effects to take hold.
If you received treatment with propranolol right after a trauma and you still
developed PTSD, the drug quite possibly didn’t work for you. It’s also possi-
ble, however, that you have less-severe symptoms as a result of the treatment
— there’s no good way to know. Either way, the treatment likely didn’t do you
any harm, so it was probably well worth a try.
(Right now, you may be wondering whether propranolol can also alter PTSD
symptoms if you take it months or years after a trauma occurs. If so, see
Chapter 9 for the latest findings, which are preliminary but encouraging.)
Crisis intervention: Helpful or harmful?
After an earthquake, terrorist attack, school shooting, or similar crisis,
experts rush to the scene to offer counseling to the survivors. These experts,
often affiliated with government agencies or community mental health ser-
vices, frequently start offering their services within hours of a terrible event.
Their goal: to stop PTSD before it can get a toehold. It’s a noble idea — but
surprisingly, it may not work. In fact, some studies hint that crisis interven-
tion (also called critical incident stress management or psychological first aid)
can create problems where none exist.
68
Part I: The Basics of PTSD 

How crisis intervention works
Crisis intervention professionals typically offer their services within the first
two or three days after a crisis occurs, but in some cases (particularly after
natural disasters), sessions may take place a few weeks after the event. If you
undergo crisis intervention, you usually attend what’s called a debriefing
(probably as part of a group of survivors). At this single session, which typi-
cally lasts three or four hours, counselors ask participants to discuss
 What happened during the trauma
 How they felt and what they thought during the traumatic event
 What the worst part of the event was
 Any stress reactions they feel (at which point the professionals offer
advice on coping techniques)
Afterward, the counselors describe the symptoms you can expect to experi-
ence as a trauma survivor. They finish up by offering to refer you for extra
help if you have serious symptoms.
Big questions, few answers
Crisis intervention sounds like a very helpful strategy, which is why it’s so
popular. But when scientists set out to show that crisis intervention helps
people, some studies showed just the opposite: It can actually make people
experience more problems, not fewer (for possible reasons, see the following
section). Among the findings:
 One team of researchers offered crisis intervention to a group of burn
patients. A little more than a year later, these patients had higher levels of
depression, anxiety, and PTSD than a group who didn’t receive treatment.
 A similar study, this time with accident victims, found that three years
after their traumas, people who received crisis intervention had more
PTSD and psychiatric symptoms, and more fear of traveling, than those
who didn’t participate.
Other researchers, however, say that getting quick help after a trauma is a
very good thing. These scientists say that the negative studies didn’t use the
right methods or study the right groups. In addition, they say that crisis
intervention needs to be part of a larger treatment package — which wasn’t
the case in the thumbs-down studies — and that it works best if it’s used with
emergency workers who treat crisis victims rather than with the frontline
trauma victims themselves.
What’s the bottom line? Researchers don’t have solid answers yet. What they
can say for sure is that this therapy doesn’t help everyone — so don’t be sur-
prised (and certainly don’t blame yourself) if it doesn’t prevent you from
developing PTSD.
69
Chapter 4: First Response: Preventive Treatments for PTSD

A Good Track Record for the First 
Few Weeks: Early CBT
If a trauma shakes your world, you may recover from the blow in a few days
or weeks. If not, your doctor may diagnose you with acute stress disorder
(see Chapter 2) and recommend a short course of therapy.
The leading therapy for acute stress disorder is a short form of the cognitive
behavioral therapy (CBT) used to treat PTSD (see Chapter 9 for a full descrip-
tion of CBT). Unlike crisis intervention, which has mixed results (see the pre-
ceding section), early CBT is a treatment with some strong scientific support.
Your doctor may recommend this approach if your symptoms are so serious
that they interfere with your work, relationships, or daily activities. If so, sci-
entific studies suggest that it’s good advice to follow. Typically, this short-
ened version of CBT takes only four or five sessions.
Early CBT and crisis intervention have common features; for instance, they
both provide info about the symptoms that trauma causes and about coping
strategies you can use. So why does early CBT seem to work so much better
than the crisis intervention that’s also popular for trauma survivors? In
short, CBT has two big advantages:
 Instead of asking you to describe your terrible experience a single time —
which can send your feelings of distress into hyperdrive without letting
you work through them — CBT lets you work through your trauma in a
step-by-step approach called graded exposure.
 CBT helps you take control over the negative thoughts that can trap you
in a cycle of trauma. (To do so, therapists use a technique called cogni-
tive restructuring, which I also cover in Chapter 9). Crisis intervention
typically doesn’t address this aspect of post-trauma stress.
The only catch to signing on for a few sessions of early CBT is that you may
not need them. Most people who experience acute stress disorder get over
their symptoms on their own and don’t need therapy. However, if your symp-
toms are keeping you from enjoying your life and functioning at work or at
home, a few CBT sessions will probably do you good. And there’s no evi-
dence, at least so far, that it can cause problems.
Self-Help Strategies: Simple, 
Safe, and Often Successful
When you survive a traumatic event, your doctors do everything they can to
help you recover — but you can do plenty for yourself as well. If you have
70
Part I: The Basics of PTSD 

minor symptoms such as sleep problems and trouble getting thoughts about
the trauma out of your mind, you may try self-help approaches to chase away
the clouds. In many cases, these steps, combined with time and patience, can
help you heal completely after a trauma.
That’s not to say, however, that you can prevent PTSD all by yourself. Many
factors play into who gets PTSD and who doesn’t, so don’t feel like you failed
if these steps don’t prevent long-term problems. (That’s a little like feeling
guilty if washing your hands doesn’t stop you from getting a cold!) And don’t
wait too long to seek professional help if you find that self-help techniques
don’t do the trick — generally, I advise that a person see a doctor if symp-
toms don’t start to fade within a month. In Chapter 5, I guide you through a
self-evaluation so you can decide for yourself whether you should talk with
your doctor; I also discuss the most common fears and excuses people have
about seeking a professional evaluation, so rest assured that if you feel this
way, you’re not alone.
That said, tapping into your own healing powers after you experience a
trauma is an excellent idea. The following sections tell you how.
Getting help to meet your 
most basic needs
Traumas often strike on many fronts at the same time. Here’s an illustration:
Bob, who survives a huge hurricane, loses his home and car on the day the
hurricane hits. He also loses his job because the catastrophe puts his store
out of business. He suffers a serious injury during the hurricane, and his
family barely escapes alive. Nobody can find his cat or his dog.
Telling Bob to simply relax, get support from his friends, and take care of
himself — even though that’s all good advice — is unrealistic. He needs time
to get over his psychological scars, but he also needs practical, common-
sense help — and a lot of it. The faster he can get a roof over his head, a car
in his driveway, a check in his mailbox, and help for his medical problems,
the better his odds of healing without long-term emotional scars.
Don’t make the mistake of being too proud to reach out for help. The more
quickly you meet your needs for food, clothing, housing, and medical care,
the better you’ll fare both mentally and physically in the long run. Depending
on the type of crisis you survived, here are some agencies or individuals who
can help:
 Charitable agencies such as the Red Cross (www.redcross.org) or
Salvation Army (www.salvationarmyusa.org)
 Government agencies
71
Chapter 4: First Response: Preventive Treatments for PTSD

 Your insurance company
 Your place of worship
 The Legal Aid Society
 Your employer
 Hospital social workers
 Friends and neighbors
 Animal shelters and humane societies
If possible, find a friend or family member — preferably someone not
exposed to the trauma — to help you. This person can handle paperwork,
phone calls, and other tasks that can otherwise overwhelm you.
Educating yourself
Mental, physical, and emotional symptoms are less scary if you know that
they’re normal reactions to a traumatic event — and the less scared you are
after a trauma, the less likely you are to develop PTSD. Understanding the
effects of a trauma can also help you to judge whether you’re getting better
on your own or you need to seek professional help.
Of course, by reading this book, you’re already educating yourself about the
aftereffects of a life crisis and how to handle them. Here are some other good
ideas:
 Talk to your doctor about what you can expect in the days or weeks
after a trauma.
 Visit the National Center for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder’s information
page at www.ncptsd.va.gov/ncmain/information.
Finding ways to relax
Stop for a moment and think about how your body feels right now. Are your
muscles tight and tense? Is your jaw clenched? Does your neck feel stiff or
sore?
After a catastrophe, you may subconsciously tense up, almost as if you expect
another blow to fall. That tension can keep you awake at night, cause headaches
72
Part I: The Basics of PTSD 

and stomachaches, and lead you to breathe rapidly and shallowly — which in
turn can trigger panic attacks. To chase away the tension, actively seek out
ways to relax. The following sections explain some techniques.
Progressive relaxation
Progressive relaxation entails tensing and relaxing different muscle groups in
order to release the muscle tension that occurs when you’re stressed. You can
do this technique lying in bed or sitting in a comfortable chair. Follow each of
the following steps and then repeat them once or twice. As you do this activ-
ity, be careful not to tense your feet, back, or neck too tightly. If you have back
or neck problems, check with your doctor before using this technique.
1. Sit or lie with your feet slightly apart, your arms a little way away
from your sides, your palms facing up, and your eyes closed.
2. Breathe in and out in a relaxed way, slowing your breathing as you
do, while you count slowly and silently to 20.
Each count should last about one second.
3. Tense the muscles of your feet and toes, counting to 5 as you do, and
then relax them while counting to 20.
4. Follow the same steps with one muscle group at a time, in this order:
calves, thighs, stomach, chest, fists (clench them tightly and then
relax), biceps, upper arms and shoulders, neck (very gently), and face.
Visualization
When practicing visualization, you close your eyes and picture yourself in a
safe, beautiful, and relaxing place. Here’s an example:
 Picture yourself lying on a soft blanket in a sunny glade, surrounded 
by a quiet forest where the only sounds are birds chirping and a brook
babbling.
 Involve several of your senses: Feel the warmth of the sun on your face,
hear the water running over the stones of the brook, and smell the piney
scent of the trees and the fresh aroma of the grass beneath you.
 Imagine looking up at the clouds drifting slowly by and the birds flying in
the distance.
 When you feel calm and relaxed, let yourself come back gently to the
real world, take a few deep breaths, and stretch.
If your mind wanders during this exercise, don’t worry. Just gently return
your attention to the scene you’re visualizing.
73
Chapter 4: First Response: Preventive Treatments for PTSD

Other methods for promoting relaxation
Different people find different activities relaxing — and what soothes one
person’s soul may leave another person wound up like a top — so finding the
right relaxation tools may take a little trial and error. Here’s a list of relaxation
techniques that you may find helpful:
 Yoga: Many people find this form of exercise calming and relaxing, but
some people with PTSD have a very negative reaction to it. If you give
yoga a try, listen to your body and continue with it only if it makes you
feel better — not worse.
 Meditation: One form of meditation that many people find highly effec-
tive is mindfulness meditation, which several major U.S. hospitals now
use to help patients with stress disorders, panic attacks, or physical
pain. (See Chapter 12 for more info.) This form of meditation helps you
focus on being present rather than being distracted by past memories or
worries about the future.
A good book that explains mindfulness meditation and describes how to
use this method is Calming Your Anxious Mind: How Mindfulness and
Compassion Can Free You from Anxiety, Fear, and Panic, by Jeffrey
Brantley, MD.
 Simple hobbies: Taking your mind off the trauma and focusing on posi-
tive activities can foster healing. Spend time on a hobby that absorbs
your attention, whether it’s painting, gardening, building furniture, or
playing the piano.
 A personalized relaxation tape: One good trick is to make your own
tape describing a relaxing image (for instance, “I’m lying on the beach,
listening to the gentle waves . . .”) and listen to it during your sessions.
The sound of your own voice gently walking you through your pleasant
scene can be very calming.
If these do-it-yourself techniques don’t take away the tension, talk to your
family doctor about going to a therapist for a few sessions of relaxation ther-
apy (see Chapter 10 for more on this). In this approach, a therapist walks you
through various relaxation techniques and helps you find the ones that work
best for you.
Getting plenty of rest
It’s tempting, especially if you’re an emergency responder who faces crises
for a living, to suck it up, say you’re fine, and keep going. But you’re not fine
right after a trauma, and your mind and body need time to cope with the
shock you just suffered. Take time off from work if you can, especially if your
work brings you into contact with stressful events. In the following sections, I
explain some measures that can help you rest.
74
Part I: The Basics of PTSD 

Easing anxiety so you can sleep
After a trauma, you need as much sleep as possible so your mind can get
some rest. That’s easier said than done because dozing peacefully in the
aftermath of a trauma is hard, and acute stress can lead to terrifying night-
mares. However, some very basic steps can help you rest more easily:
 If you live alone, having a close friend or family member stay with you
for a few days sometimes helps. This company can make you feel safer
(especially at night, when fears tend to take over), and you also get a
sympathetic sounding board for when you feel like talking about what
happened.
Man’s best furry friend can help in a time of crisis, too. One woman I
know had the smart idea of borrowing her parents’ dog to keep her com-
pany after she experienced a life crisis. She says, “Having a warm, com-
forting, familiar body to sleep next to, coupled with the distraction of
someone else to care for, really helped me when I needed it most.”
 Avoid watching violent TV shows, reading books with scenes of vio-
lence, or watching the nightly news before you go to bed. Instead, read
something restful or watch something light and fun such as cooking
shows or sports. Letting the TV lull you to sleep can be helpful, but use
the snooze feature if you have one so you won’t be rudely awakened by
a loud or frightening show or commercial.
 Avoid caffeine or alcohol before bedtime.
 Leave a light (or all of them) on if doing so makes you feel safer.
 Play a tape of nature sounds or soft music, or use a fan or white-noise
generator to block sounds that can wake you in the night.
 Use relaxation techniques (see that section earlier in this chapter)
before bedtime.
 If your trauma occurred inside your home, consider changing the furni-
ture arrangement, getting new rugs or bedding, or even repainting. The
more you change the room’s appearance, the less likely it’ll be to trigger
bad memories. Sleeping elsewhere, or installing a security system, may
also make you feel more secure.
Avoid using sleep medications — either prescription or non-prescription —
unless your doctor strongly feels that they’re right for you. These drugs can
cause their own problems, which are sometimes serious (see Chapter 9). One
possible alternative is the over-the-counter sleep aid melatonin, a natural hor-
mone that helps some people but not others. If you decide to try melatonin,
check with your doctor first to make sure it’s safe for you.
75
Chapter 4: First Response: Preventive Treatments for PTSD

Dealing with nightmares
Dealing with the aftermath of a trauma is tough enough when you’re awake,
but it’s even worse when you can’t get a good night’s sleep. Nightmares are a
common aftereffect of a terrifying experience, and these bad dreams can
interrupt your sleep and make you fearful of sacking out when the sun goes
down. Here are some tricks that can calm your troubled nights:
 Try consciously rewriting your nightmares in your mind so they have
happy endings. For instance, if you have recurring nightmares about
being threatened by a faceless attacker, picture the attacker turning into
a funny bug and visualize yourself squashing it. If you can get this pic-
ture firmly in mind, you may alter the course of your nightmare if it
recurs.
Don’t fall back asleep intentionally with the hopes of changing the night-
mare’s ending — chances are good that you’ll just keep re-experiencing
the same awful ending or other just-as-bad alternate endings. Rewrite
the dream while you’re awake, and if you begin to fall back to sleep,
focus intently on the happy ending as you drift into Dreamland.
 Remind yourself that nightmares, like dreams, are just a tool your
brain uses to help you sort out events and file away memories. If you
think of a terrifying dream as part of your brain’s filing system, you can
take away some of its punch.
 Ask your doctor whether he or she thinks you’ll benefit from a brief
intervention called imagery rehearsal therapy. This therapy often
reduces the frequency of nightmares in trauma survivors. In IRT, a thera-
pist guides you through the steps of writing down your nightmares,
changing their endings to more positive ones, and rehearsing your
rewritten dream scenarios so they can displace the bad endings when
your dream reoccurs (see Chapter 11 for more info).
Eating healthy foods and exercising
A life crisis throws everything out of whack in your life, and that includes
eating. Getting back on track with meals is a big key to feeling better because
your body needs nutrients to counter the effects of stress — especially B vit-
amins and vitamin C, which stress can deplete.
As soon as you can, get back to your typical eating schedule. Do your best to
choose healthy foods, and try to eat at least a little at each mealtime even if
you’re not hungry. Avoid heavy doses of caffeine or alcohol, and if you live on
fast food, take a good vitamin/mineral supplement, at least for a few months.
Also, consider taking supplements of omega-3 fatty acids. (You can find these
at most grocery stores and any health-food store.) Initial studies suggest that
these nutrients may help to lower stress.
76
Part I: The Basics of PTSD 

In addition to eating right, you can help yourself heal by adding exercise to
your get-well plan. A good workout can release built-up stress and relax tense
muscles, and it also produces natural feel-good chemicals called endorphins
that can lift your mood. Lifting weights, pushing against exercise machines,
or running or biking at a fast pace can help work out the anger that often fol-
lows in the wake of a trauma.
Some people become more anxious — not less — if they do aerobic exercises
such as running or kickboxing. Pay attention to how you feel after an exercise
session, and pick the routines that calm you rather than stress you out.
Taking charge to gain a sense of control
After you survive a trauma, take steps that make you feel like you’re more in
control of your life. The actions you choose can depend on the type of
trauma you suffered, but here are some examples:
 Start a journal to work out your feelings.
 Take positive steps to increase your safety. Avoid the urge to crawl into
a hole and never leave the house, but do sensible things. For instance,
install better deadbolts and/or a home security system, buy pepper
spray, increase your homeowner’s insurance, or buy home-repair tools,
flashlights, and first aid kits so you’ll be better prepared in the event of a
sequel.
 After you put a very big distance between yourself and the trauma — a
long enough time that you’re over the worst of the shock — consider
taking a first-aid course, a self-defense class, or any other type of class
that can make you feel more capable of handling a future emergency.
(However, wait on these activities until you’re quite sure they won’t trig-
ger stressful memories.)
 Donate to a charity that helps people in times of crisis — or if the idea
appeals to you, volunteer to help other survivors. The old saying is true:
Lighting a candle in the darkness can have a powerful healing effect.
Talking it out
Having your horror heard helps heal your hurt, so share your feelings with
friends and family members you trust. When you share with a good listener,
you feel less alone. When you feel less alone, awful feelings become, well, less
awful. Getting panicky feelings off your chest and into a caring person’s ear
can help you go back to just feeling frightened; getting angry feelings off your
chest can help you get back to just feeling frustrated.
77
Chapter 4: First Response: Preventive Treatments for PTSD

If you’re lucky, your friends and family will listen to you without rushing to
tell you that everything will be fine (which people often say because you’re
starting to make them nervous). If they do try to reassure you that all’s well
when you know it’s not, look elsewhere for a sympathetic ear — perhaps to a
therapist or a support group (see info on support groups in the next section
and info on finding a therapist in Chapter 6).
When you talk with friends or family, you don’t need to relive every detail of
the trauma you survived or dredge up the memories that scare you. Instead,
talk about the parts of the event you’re comfortable remembering. For exam-
ple, it may be easier at first to offer a description of how the event unfolded
than to talk about your feelings when it happened — or it may be easier to talk
about the before-and-after parts of the trauma than to describe the scariest
moments. If you’re unable to talk about your trauma even weeks after it occurs,
consider seeing a therapist who can help you work through what happened.
Attending a support group (if it helps)
Sometimes, even the people closest to you can’t understand what you’re
going through. That’s why support groups, which bring together people who
share a similar problem, can be powerful healing tools. In a support group
meeting, you’re less likely to get blank looks when you talk about your post-
trauma problems and are more likely to hear, “I know just what you mean”
and “I feel exactly the same way.” But although these groups can offer under-
standing and support, they’re not for everyone. In the sections that follow, I
talk about the pros and cons of support groups and where to find one if you
want to explore this option.
Deciding whether a support group is right for you
Throw 10 or 12 strangers in a room together for a meeting, and you never
know what’ll happen. The outcome depends on the people themselves — and
that’s as true for support groups as it is for board meetings (or cocktail par-
ties, for that matter).
Some people gain hope, help, moral support, and new friendships by attend-
ing support groups; others find them a waste of time or even a trigger for anx-
iety. And some people visit three or four support groups before they find one
that clicks for them. Here’s a look at the advantages and drawbacks of these
groups to help you decide whether this option is right for you.
On the pro side:
 You meet other people in the same boat and realize that you’re not
alone. Also, discovering that many other wonderful, strong people have
the same feelings as you can help you get rid of the destructive idea that
you’re “abnormal” or “weak.”
78
Part I: The Basics of PTSD 

 You can share your feelings in a safe environment. Other group members
can offer support and security while also nudging you to work through
your feelings.
 Often, interacting with people who suffered a similar trauma gives you a
chance to meet both people who are newly traumatized and those who
are moving through and getting over it. This range can show you that
people do make it through.
 Sharing with others can help you stay out of your head, which is a good
idea because your imagination can really scare the heck out of you.
On the downside:
 Sometimes, support group meetings trigger anxiety or flashbacks. This
can leave you worse off, not better, if you haven’t received therapy and
don’t have the tools to deal with these reactions.
 If you have severe symptoms, support groups (unless you augment them
with professional help) probably aren’t the right approach for you.
That’s because you need the more structured setting of therapy to work
through serious PTSD symptoms in a controlled way.
Finding your niche: The search for the right group
If you think a support group can benefit you and you’re willing to shop
around to find the right one, you can locate support groups through the fol-
lowing sources:
 Your family doctor (or your therapist if you have one): These profes-
sionals can be a big help in steering you toward groups that meet your
specific needs.
 The Internet: Just type in “support groups” and a description of the
type of trauma you survived. (For example, a search of “support groups”
and “air disasters” leads you to ACCESS, the AirCraft Casualty Emotional
Support Services, which helps people whose loved ones died or suffered
injuries in an air disaster.) Often, adding the name of your town or state
helps to narrow your choices.
 Your local hospital: Some hospitals offer their own programs, and
others can help you locate resources in the community. Your best bet is
to talk to the community relations or social services department.
 Clearinghouses: Call or search online for support group clearinghouses,
which are nonprofit groups that help you link up with the right group for
you. (If you go to www.mentalhealth.org and click on “Resources”
and “Mental Health Services Locator,” you can find a state-by-state list-
ing of various groups.)
 Your local newspaper: Many newspapers publish calendars of support
group meetings.
79
Chapter 4: First Response: Preventive Treatments for PTSD

 United Way (www.unitedway.org) and similar organizations: These
organizations can provide referrals to agencies that offer the type of
group you’re seeking.
 Your place of worship, particularly if it offers referrals to pastoral
(religious) counseling services: A pastoral counselor is in an excellent
position to direct you toward community resources, including support
groups.
 Community clinics in your area: Some of these clinics offer support-group
services themselves, and others can give you appropriate referrals.
If you can’t find a local group, try calling national groups and asking whether
they know of groups in your area. Also, see Chapter 7 for a list of national
organizations that may be able to help you.

n my boyhood days, I once tried my hand at a paint-by-numbers kit. I still
remember dabbing a blob of green here and a speck of black or red there
and marveling as my little dabs gradually turned into a cow, a chicken, and
eventually an entire farmyard.
Trying to decide whether you have PTSD is a little like watching a paint-by-
numbers masterpiece unfold, because no single symptom or event can give
you the whole picture. To find answers, you need to look at the pattern that
emerges when you assemble your bits and pieces into a whole.
Of course, there’s a huge difference between splattering paint on a piece of
pasteboard and staring PTSD in the face — the latter is very serious busi-
ness, and getting the right picture is vital to your future. In this chapter, I lend
you a hand in that process by outlining the steps that can help you make an
educated guess about whether you have PTSD. If your conclusion is yes, I
offer advice on seeking professional help and tell you what to expect when
you visit a doctor in search of answers.

A Quick Quiz: Identifying 
Your Symptoms
Feelings and behaviors don’t always fit into tidy little boxes that you can
label as okay or not okay. If you frequently blow up at co-workers, do you
have PTSD, or is it just job stress? If you quit driving after an accident, is that
a PTSD symptom or just common sense? Sometimes distinguishing a symp-
tom from an everyday behavior is hard unless you look at the big picture.
An excellent place to start in this effort is by seeing how your symptom pat-
tern stacks up against the official diagnosis of PTSD (see Chapter 3 for more
on this). The following self-test, based on the clues doctors look for when
they diagnose PTSD, can help you answer that question.
Answer yes or no to the scoring question at the end of each group of ques-
tions, writing your answers in the line to the left of the scoring question.
Note: Don’t score any questions except the scoring questions at the end of
each section.
1. Look back.
• Did you survive a traumatic event that threatened your life or
threatened or killed another person?
• If so, did that event make you feel terrified, horrified, and/or help-
less?
_________ Scoring Question: Did you answer yes to both questions?
2. Spot intrusive symptoms.
• Do you have repeated, distressing recollections of the event?
• Do you experience recurring nightmares about the event?
• Do you sometimes feel like you’re reliving the event? For instance,
do you have flashbacks or hallucinations that make you feel like
the event is happening again?
• Do you feel mentally or physically distressed when something
reminds you of the trauma?
_________ Scoring Question: Did you answer yes to one or more 
questions?
3. Identify avoidant symptoms.
• Do you try to avoid thoughts, feelings, or conversations about
topics related to the trauma?
• Do you try to avoid people, places, or activities that remind you of
the trauma?
84
Part II: Getting a Diagnosis and Drafting a Plan 

• Is your memory a complete blank when it comes to key parts of
your trauma?
• Do you lack interest in day-to-day activities that you once consid-
ered important, interesting, or fun?
• Do you feel detached from other people?
• Is it hard for you to feel a normal range of emotions?
• Do you have difficulty picturing the future? For instance, is it hard
for you to picture having kids, building a career, or living a long life?
_________ Scoring Question: Did you answer yes to three or more 
questions?
4. Pinpoint symptoms of hyperarousal.
• Do you have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep?
• Do you frequently feel irritable or have outbursts of anger?
• Is concentrating difficult?
• Are you always on guard and unable to relax?
• Do you startle easily? For instance, do you react much more
strongly to noises or surprises than other people do?
_________ Scoring Question: Did you answer yes to at least two 
questions?
5. Factor in how long and how strong.
• Did your symptoms start more than one month ago? (No matter
when the original trauma occurred — even if it was many years
ago — answer this question based on your current symptoms.)
• Do your symptoms disturb you so much that they interfere with
your work, your relationships, or other important parts of your
life? (If you have trouble answering this question, see the next sec-
tion in this chapter for help.)
_________ Scoring Question: Did you answer yes to both questions?
6. Add up your score.
Check your answers to the scoring questions at the end of each section.
If you answered yes to every one of these questions — even if you didn’t
answer yes to all the questions in each numbered group — you likely
have PTSD. Remember — the scoring questions are what count in your
final analysis.
If you answered no to some of the scoring questions, you likely wouldn’t
get an official diagnosis of PTSD. However, pen-and-paper tests can’t tell
all, so if your symptoms worry you, talk to your doctor.
85
Chapter 5: Getting Answers: Finding Out Whether You Have PTSD

A note about timing: If your symptoms started at least six months after a
trauma, you may have delayed PTSD. If less than one month has passed since
your trauma but your symptoms indicate PTSD, you may have acute stress 
disorder. (See Chapter 2 for more about the timing of PTSD symptoms.)
Being 100 percent sure that you have PTSD takes more than a quick quiz, but
your answers on the preceding self-test can allow you to make a pretty good
guess — especially when you combine them with your gut instincts. You can
get an even clearer picture if you take a long, honest look at just how much
your symptoms interfere with the life you want to live.
A Reality Check: Assessing the 
Severity of Your Symptoms
Nobody’s life is a bed of roses. All people have days when nothing goes right:
They lose their jobs, break up with a lover, or do something foolish or hurtful.
If you have PTSD, however, these days happen far too often. What’s more,
you probably blame yourself when they do. But the truth is it’s not your fault.
That’s because when your symptoms strike, you’re not in the driver’s seat —
PTSD is. And PTSD symptoms can drive away friends and family, frighten the
people you love, and hurt your chances at work (or even make keeping a job
impossible).
However, spotting the damage PTSD is doing to your life can be hard when
you’re right in the middle of it. Now’s the time to find some quiet time, during
a period when you feel calm and relaxed, to analyze how your life is going
and whether you’re still in control of it. The sections that follow can offer
some insight.
Are your symptoms affecting 
your relationships?
All relationships have rocky spots, but PTSD can throw giant boulders in the
path of a marriage, friendship, or any other loving relationship. Here are some
key signs that your symptoms may be driving you and your loved ones apart:
 Your emotional outbursts or extreme reactions to minor life events (for
example, having a meltdown if a car alarm goes off or flying into a rage
over a minor disagreement) worry, frighten, or alienate your friends 
and family.
86
Part II: Getting a Diagnosis and Drafting a Plan 

 Your need to avoid certain things, places, or people that remind you of
your trauma make it hard for you to be with your friends or participate
in family activities.
 Your partner or family members worry about your lack of interest or
negative attitude about your future.
 Your friends or partner say that you’re distant, uncaring, or impossible
to reach.
 You have extreme mood swings. For instance, you may be happy as a
clam at breakfast and then upset or angry or weepy an hour later for no
good reason.
 You’re distrustful of people — even those who’ve earned your trust.
 You find excuses to avoid intimacy or sex with your partner.
 You avoid sexual relationships entirely or — conversely — seek out
unsafe, temporary sexual partnerships.
 You avoid getting together with friends or family to the point that they
ask, “What’s wrong? Don’t you like us anymore?” When you do accept an
invitation to a get-together, you have trouble making small talk or being
interested in the people you’re with.
Are your symptoms affecting your work?
At some point, just about everybody says, “I hate my job,” and everyone has
occasional issues with a boss, co-worker, or client. But the work problems
that stem from PTSD are a whole different ballgame because they can sabo-
tage a job or even an entire career. If you have the following problems, then
consider getting professional help:
 You have trouble keeping a job for more than a short time — or you find
it impossible to work at all.
 You often have outbursts of anger or other emotional meltdowns on 
the job.
 You lose promotions or get bad reviews because your supervisors have
trouble dealing with your symptoms. For instance, you may have trouble
dealing with demanding customers, find it hard to concentrate on tasks,
or miss too many days at work because you can’t face the stress of a
workday.
 You have trouble trusting co-workers or letting them develop relation-
ships with you.
 You doubt abilities that you once felt confident about, and you don’t feel
positive about your professional future.
 You’ve lost interest in improving your job skills or getting ahead in 
your field.
87
Chapter 5: Getting Answers: Finding Out Whether You Have PTSD

Are your symptoms affecting your health?
Missing the connection between PTSD and physical aches and pains is easy,
but the two often go hand-in-hand. If you have a number of the symptoms
that follow and you find no other obvious explanation for them, a doctor can
help you decide whether they’re PTSD-related. If they are, therapy may help
reduce their sting or eliminate them altogether:
 Heart palpitations
 Sleep problems
 Chronic exhaustion or fatigue
 Tension headaches
 Stomach pain, irritable bowel syndrome, or other digestive problems
 Chronic pain
Do your symptoms worry or frighten 
you or your loved ones?
If you have any of the symptoms that follow, you don’t need to play the
guessing game. It’s time to seek help — no ifs, ands, or buts — because your
life depends on it:
88
Part II: Getting a Diagnosis and Drafting a Plan 
Looking at legal protection: PTSD and the ADA
The Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA,
prevents employers from discriminating against
workers with disabilities. But does that include
you if you receive an official diagnosis of PTSD?
The answer is a definite maybe.
The ADA doesn’t spell out the medical condi-
tions that qualify as disabilities. Thus, accord-
ing to the Job Accommodation Network, “Some
people with PTSD will have a disability under
the ADA and some will not.” Under the law,
you’re covered if you
 Have a long-term mental, physical, or emo-
tional impairment that substantially limits
your ability to perform a major life activity
 Have a record of having such a disability
 Are perceived as having such a disability,
even if you don’t (you don’t need to figure
out this brain-twister, because it doesn’t
apply if you have a PTSD diagnosis)
In real life, you may be covered if your PTSD
causes significant symptoms that impair your abil-
ity to do a job without special help and if you can
document this claim. If so, your employer may be
required to make special accommodations for
your PTSD. This could be anything from removing
triggers from your work area (for instance, certain
noises or aromas) to providing a driver if your
PTSD prevents you from driving to a client’s office.

 Suicidal thoughts or impulses
 Alcohol or drug abuse
 Depression (see Chapter 3)
 Violent thoughts or actions
 Sexual behaviors that put you at risk for AIDS or other sexually transmit-
ted diseases
 Eating disorders
 Reckless behavior, such as speeding or driving when you’ve had too
much to drink
 Dissociation, in which you mentally disconnect from some aspects of
your own identity (see Chapter 3)
 An unshakable feeling that your life is shattered and that you can never
put the pieces back together again
 Feelings that you’re worthless and don’t deserve a good life
Adding it all up
After taking stock of your situation, you can assemble the facts you need to
make some informed guesses. The self-test at the start of this chapter can
help you spot patterns pointing to PTSD, and an honest look at your life can
tell you whether your symptoms are standing between you and a happy life.
Ask yourself how you feel after this self-analysis:
 Relieved — you don’t think you have PTSD. If you didn’t spot any big
red flags, the preventive measures I describe in Chapter 4 may help you
get any minor post-trauma symptoms under control.
 Concerned — your answers make you realize that you have some seri-
ous problems. If you’re not sure your answers add up to PTSD but you
spot some worrisome patterns, talk things over with a doctor who can
help you make sense of your symptoms.
 Scared — the PTSD symptoms and life problems sound like the story
of your life. If warning bells ring loudly when you take the quiz or ana-
lyze your life, then don’t let worries or doubts get in the way of seeking
professional help immediately.
If you picked either concerned or scared, I recommend taking action as soon
as you can. The longer PTSD affects your life, the more secondary problems
it can cause in the form of broken relationships, career problems, and missed
opportunities. The following section tells you how to get help.
89
Chapter 5: Getting Answers: Finding Out Whether You Have PTSD

Facing Your Fears: Seeking 
Professional Help
If PTSD blocks the path to your happy future, getting a diagnosis is the first
step to finding treatment and healing. Even so, the idea of sharing your fears
and feelings with a doctor may make you wobbly in the knees. As a trauma
survivor, you may feel that the world is unsafe and unpredictable. And if your
trauma happened at the hands of another person, trusting a stranger with
your deepest emotions can be tough.
In addition, just thinking about opening up to another person about your
symptoms can reawaken powerful fears that you’re struggling to keep under
lock and key. What’s more, you may worry about how people will react if you
go public with your symptoms — will they think you’re crazy or weak or pos-
sibly even dangerous? As a result, it’s all too easy to sabotage your decision
to see a doctor with excuses like these:
I’ll get over it eventually, so I’ll just wait.
I’m just too busy right now.
Everybody has problems. I’ll learn to cope.
I have my friends and family to worry about. What would they think if I’m
diagnosed with a “mental problem”?
If you keep catching yourself making these excuses — or scheduling appoint-
ments with your doctor and then canceling them — realize that fear, guilt,
shame, and self-doubt are standing in the way of the future you want. When
your heart is saying, “Go for it!” but your fears keep saying, “Whoa,” the best
way to move forward is to recognize and deal with the fears that hold you
hostage. Here are the most common culprits:
 Fear of what your friends and family will think: If you’re an 
overachiever — and people with PTSD often are — admitting that 
you’re not superhuman can be tough. Like everyone else, you want 
your loved ones to think you’re perfect (even though you’re pretty sure
that they aren’t). But PTSD isn’t a character flaw or a sign of weakness. 
It also has nothing to do with being “crazy.” Wise friends and family
members realize that — and if they don’t, you can educate them.
(Loaning them this book is a good start.)
 Fear of telling your doctor about frightening or embarrassing symptoms
or about drug or alcohol abuse: Many people worry themselves silly
about talking to their doctor, but the truth is that doctors are nearly impos-
sible to shock. What’s more, a good doctor knows that your behaviors and
feelings are classic symptoms of a medical problem, not signs that you’re
weak or bad in some way. And the information you give your doctor is con-
fidential, so you can safely tell the doc if you’re using illicit substances.
90
Part II: Getting a Diagnosis and Drafting a Plan 

 Fear of giving up excuses: Do your symptoms get you off the hook
sometimes or buy you special privileges? For instance, do they make 
it easier for you to say no to family or work obligations or cause your
family to walk on eggshells to avoid upsetting you? If so, you may
secretly worry about having to shoulder more responsibility or accept
some more emotional give-and-take as you begin to heal. Spotting this
hidden agenda can help you overcome that fear.
 Fear of giving up addictions: Tackling a substance abuse problem 
is a very tough job, but you likely don’t want to spend your entire 
life in thrall to alcohol or drugs (see Chapter 7 for more on this 
important topic). What’s more, getting treatment for PTSD can give 
you a huge boost in finding the strength to conquer substance abuse
problems.
 Fear of losing control: You probably go to great lengths to avoid situa-
tions that trigger your symptoms — and here I am, asking you to walk into
the lion’s den. But there’s a big difference between being helpless and hor-
rified when a trauma strikes and working through that trauma in a secure
setting with the careful guidance of a therapist who’ll protect you from
harm. The techniques people use in therapy empower you to view the
event from a position of strength — not a position of helplessness — and
as a result, to gain power and control over it.
If you spot fears that are holding you back, banish negativity by focusing 
on what you’ll gain when you heal — not what you may lose. True, getting 
a diagnosis can mean facing some scary parts of your life and tackling some
tough issues. But confronting your problem can also mean opening the 
door to a future that’s full of promise. It can mean less fear, more happiness,
deeper relationships, greater career success, and — above all — the freedom
to be the person you want to be. If you add up the pros and cons, taking
action wins hands-down over a lifetime of woulda, coulda, shoulda.
What’s more, you’re likely to find that the simple act of admitting that you’re
scared or in pain takes a huge weight off your shoulders. Denying a bad 
feeling gives it more power, but acknowledging it instantly removes the 
heavy burden of trying to keep up a false front. And here’s another tip: No
matter how stoic you are, you’re probably not fooling the people who know
you best.
So decide that it’s okay to say, “I feel bad,” and take the next step toward feel-
ing better. To help you gain more confidence to pick up the phone and make
an appointment, the following sections explain how to prepare in advance
and what to expect when you get to the doctor’s office.

Chapter 5: Getting Answers: Finding Out Whether You Have PTSD

Preparing for Your Visit to the Doctor:
What to Do, What to Bring
Just for a minute, pretend that you’re a primary care doctor. You have six antsy
patients in your waiting room, and you’re already running an hour late — and
in comes a patient with a problem that takes time, wisdom, and some serious
detective work to diagnose. Such a situation can thwart even the best doctor’s
efforts to provide help.
Identifying strep throat or a sprained wrist is simple, but diagnosing PTSD is a
different story — especially for a busy doctor who’s not a specialist in this dis-
order. To decide whether your symptoms add up to a PTSD diagnosis — and to
refer you to the right specialists if the answer is yes — your primary care doctor
needs both plenty of time and a lot of facts. Here’s how to be ready with both:
 Give the doc a heads-up. When you call to make an appointment, tell
the receptionist that you need plenty of time and explain why. A doctor
who’s expecting a ten-minute appointment may not be ready to give you
the attention you need. Also, make an appointment early in the day if
you can. Doctors’ offices tend to be less backed-up in the morning.
 Write down every symptom you want to discuss with your doctor. If
you get emotional during your visit, remembering everything you want
to say may be tough. (See the following section for info on the kind of
information the doctor wants to know.)
 Invite a friend along. If you worry that you’ll lose your cool when 
you talk with your doctor, consider bringing a trusted friend or family
member along. Be sure to choose someone you can talk openly around
so you won’t need to edit what you tell the doctor.
 Do your homework. Assemble any paperwork that can give your doctor
insight into your symptoms. For instance, bring medical records from
the time of the trauma, lab tests from recent years, and any evaluations
from professionals that may be useful.
 Get your game face on. Decide ahead of time to be polite but also
assertive when you talk to your doctor. Sometimes if a doctor seems
brusque or busy, you may feel like chickening out and leaving without
asking your questions. But you need answers, so make sure you get them.
 Be a good guest. Be nice and respectful to the people in the doctor’s
front office. If the staff seems rushed, cut them some slack — you never
know what traumas they’re dealing with themselves! Thank them for
their assistance.
Thanking your doctor as well doesn’t hurt. Many doctors feel that they
care about others more than others care about them, so expressing your
appreciation is a nice way to let your doc know that you’re grateful for
the extra time you’re requesting.
92
Part II: Getting a Diagnosis and Drafting a Plan 

If you start with a family doctor, expect to get a referral to a second doctor
(most likely a psychiatrist or a psychologist). Primary care doctors usually
send patients with PTSD to physicians who have extra training in treating this
problem instead of creating a treatment plan themselves.
Read up on the different treatments for PTSD (see Chapters 8, 9, and 10)
before you go for your appointment. That way, if your doctor recommends a
particular approach or asks you to choose between treatments, you’ll have
the background info you need to make the right decisions.
Getting a Diagnosis: What 
Your Doctor Will Do
Careful doctors don’t rush a diagnosis, especially when it’s a tricky one like
PTSD, so be prepared for a long chat. Sorting out the symptoms of this disor-
der and ruling out other look-alikes that can masquerade as PTSD takes time.
You can help in this process by being prepared and being ready to talk
straightforwardly about your symptoms.
Doctors vary in their approach to PTSD, but the following sections go over
what your doctor is likely to do at your appointment.
Questions, questions, questions!
There’s no blood test or X-ray for PTSD, so your doctor needs your help in
diagnosing this problem. The more you’re willing to share, the easier it’ll be
to get to the heart of the matter. Here’s what your doctor needs to know:
 The type of trauma you suffered
 When you started having symptoms and what they are
 How serious your symptoms are — for instance, whether they interfere
with your personal life or work
 Whether you have related issues, such as a drug or alcohol problem or
an eating disorder
Your doctor may ask for specifics, so be prepared. For instance, the doctor
may ask you to describe how often you have flashbacks and what occurs
when you do — or he may ask you to describe the intensity of your night-
mares or how many nights per week you can’t sleep. Bring some concise
notes if you think it’ll help you remember important points.
93
Chapter 5: Getting Answers: Finding Out Whether You Have PTSD

Also, expect a lot of questions designed to explore your feelings and behavior.
These questions can be upsetting or embarrassing, but your doctor has good
reasons for asking them. You may want to rehearse a little beforehand — for
instance, by writing about your emotions in a journal or talking out loud to
yourself about them — so you’re ready to face these probing queries. Here 
are some typical example questions:
 Can you tell me what happens when you have flashbacks?
 Can you describe how you feel when you go back to the place where the
trauma occurred?
 Did you suffer abuse as a child? If so, can you tell me who hurt you 
and how?
 What do you think caused the trauma? What do you think could be done
to prevent a similar trauma?
 Do you feel like you were to blame for the trauma in any way?
 How is your life going? Are you doing okay at work? Are your relationships
with other people healthy? Do you have issues with sex or intimacy?
 How much do you drink? Do you use any street drugs?
 Do you feel suicidal? Depressed? Angry? Do you feel any violent urges?
Respond honestly to each question, and rest assured that anything you tell
your doctor will stay in the room. If you find it hard to talk about some
topics, a caring doctor understands — but do your best to hang in there, and
don’t be embarrassed if the tears flow during your conversation. (There’s a
good reason every doctor’s office has a box of tissues.)
More-detailed questions
Typically, the second step in making a diagnosis of PTSD involves still more
Q&A, this time based on standardized checklists developed by experts on
this disorder. These questions cover pretty much the same territory as the
more informal questions your doctor asks, but doctors often like the confir-
mation of an official test result, and these results can be useful for your med-
ical records. (Not all primary care doctors use these tests, however. Many
decide, after hearing enough clues to strongly hint at PTSD, to save the
formal tests for a specialist.)
If your doctor uses one of these tests, be prepared to answer a lot of ques-
tions, and be as patient as possible. These tests are pretty good at teasing
out the symptoms of PTSD, and the results can help support your diagnosis
so you can get insurance coverage and other services.
94
Part II: Getting a Diagnosis and Drafting a Plan 

A physical exam
If you think that PTSD is all in your head, think again — PTSD can affect you
all over, from raising your blood pressure to upsetting your digestive system.
That’s why you need a top-to-toes checkup when you visit the doctor.
Your doc also wants to rule out medical conditions, some of them very
common, which can mimic PTSD. Here are some of the biggest culprits:
 Thyroid problems: An underactive thyroid can make you feel depressed,
and an overactive thyroid can cause severe symptoms of anxiety.
 Mitral valve prolapse: In this condition, a bulge in a heart valve allows
blood to leak backward, causing symptoms ranging from heart palpita-
tions to anxiety attacks.
95
Chapter 5: Getting Answers: Finding Out Whether You Have PTSD
An unexpected culprit: When meds trigger PTSD
Be sure to tell your doctor about every drug
you’re taking, because even the safest medica-
tions can have side effects — and sometimes
those side effects look like PTSD. Here’s a case
in point.
In the journal Psychosomatics, Roy Reeves and
Vincent Liberto report on a Vietnam vet who
went for decades without suffering PTSD symp-
toms despite a history of harrowing combat. At
the age of 64, the man suffered an episode of
chest tightness and his doctors discovered that
he had high blood pressure and early heart dis-
ease. They prescribed metoprolol, a drug that’s
very helpful in lowering blood pressure.
The drug worked its magic on the man’s blood
pressure — but it also did a number on his
mental state. Within a few weeks, he started to
have violent nightmares about his days in
Vietnam. The dreams disrupted his sleep, and
he became irritable and had trouble concen-
trating. He started therapy for PTSD, but his
symptoms worsened. He started avoiding things
that reminded him of his time in combat, and he
grew depressed and anxious.
Luckily, the man’s doctors noticed that his symp-
toms started at the same time as his new med-
ication, and they put two and two together. They
switched him from metoprolol to a different
drug, and after about ten days, his nightmares
started to fade and his other symptoms
improved.
The doctors say metoprolol can change REM
sleep (the sleep stage in which most dreams
occur), which may explain the man’s terrible
nightmares. Interestingly, this drug is related to
another drug, propranolol, which is currently
being tested as a treatment to prevent PTSD
symptoms (see Chapter 4).
As this vet’s case helps illustrate, a medication
for anything — from back pain to high blood
pressure to acne — can cause mental changes
that are easy to mistake for PTSD. That’s why
your doctor needs the rundown on all your
meds (including over-the-counter ones), as well
as any herbal remedies or nutritional supple-
ments you take.

 Lupus or multiple sclerosis: These autoimmune disorders (in which the
body attacks its own cells) can alter both thinking and emotions.
 Anemia caused by low levels of folic acid, vitamin B12, or iron:
Anemia can make you feel tired, moody, and depressed, and it can cause
trouble concentrating and handling day-to-day activities.
 Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) or diabetes: Alterations in blood 
sugar — either too high or too low — can cause a host of changes in
your emotions and thinking, including spaciness, anger, confusion, and
mood swings.
 Meniere’s syndrome (an inner-ear problem): This problem can lead to
anxiety and even to panic attacks.
 Head injuries: Head injuries can either mimic or complicate PTSD.
These injuries can impair your thinking and memory and can cause 
emotional problems.
 Hormone imbalances: In women, mood swings, depression, and prob-
lems with memory or concentration sometimes occur just before or
during menopause. In middle-aged or older men, low testosterone levels
can lead to depression and fatigue.
 Sleep apnea: This problem, which is especially common in people with
weight issues, can cause fatigue, confusion, hostility, and mood swings.
 Medication reactions: Disturbances of emotions and thinking are some
of the most common side effects of drugs; see the sidebar titled “An
unexpected culprit: When meds trigger PTSD” in this chapter.
Your doctor should give you a careful check-up to rule out these or other
problems and to see whether PTSD is affecting your health. When the time
for this exam arrives, be sure to tell your doc if you have issues that affect
your ability to tolerate the level of closeness usually involved in an exam. For
instance, let the doctor know if you have any of the following concerns:
 A strong reaction to being touched: Although some touching is neces-
sary during a physical exam, a sensitive doctor can take care to respect
your needs and keep hands-on evaluations to a minimum. If being
touched by a person of your doctor’s sex upsets you, see whether your
doctor has a partner or physician assistant of the opposite sex — or
make a separate appointment with a different doctor.
 A strong reaction to any process or piece of equipment that triggers
memories of your trauma: These things can include tongue depressors,
sedation, and certain positions or types of exams. You doctor may be
able to avoid some tests or think of work-arounds that won’t trigger
your anxiety.
96
Part II: Getting a Diagnosis and Drafting a Plan 

 Fear of undressing in front of a stranger: A sensitive doctor may find a
way to limit the amount of undressing you need to do (for instance, by
having you take off only one or two articles of clothing at a time) or min-
imize the time it takes to do the exam.
 Fear of being trapped: Tell your doctor if you feel more comfortable
having a clear path to the door. Some survivors of assault feel panicky if a
stranger — even a doctor — stands between them and an escape route.
If you find any part of your exam overwhelming, feel free to ask whether you
can postpone some steps until your next visit. Talking about your symptoms
and undergoing a physical exam on the same day can be overwhelming, and a
sensitive doctor won’t push you past your limits.
Taking the Next Step: What to Do If 
Your Doctor Says You Have PTSD
At some point, your doctor makes a diagnosis or refers you to a specialist.
Reaching this point may take two or more visits, plus tests to rule out the
mimicking disorders I talk about earlier in “Perform a physical exam.”
If either your family doctor or a specialist says you have PTSD, now’s the
time for a heart-to-heart about what comes next. If you know what type of
therapy you want (see Chapters 8, 9, and 10 for more info), ask for a referral
that jibes with your wishes. If you don’t know which approach is best for you,
investigate each option your doctor recommends before selecting one. Also,
if you have drug or alcohol issues, be sure your treatment plan addresses
these problems.
After you decide on a course of action, see Chapter 6 for ideas on picking a
therapist. You can also find tips on figuring out your insurance coverage or
finding free or low-cost therapy if you don’t have insurance.
Of course, you may not agree with your doctor’s verdict. If you think the
doc’s full of beans, get a second opinion, because PTSD isn’t always clear-cut
and different doctors can come to different verdicts. Sadly, too, running into a
doctor who’s totally clueless about PTSD is possible. If that happens, don’t
give up — just find a better doctor.
If your doctor orders medical tests for you, be sure to get copies of the
results, even if you need to pay a little for them. Keep them filed away
because future doctors or your insurance company may need them.

Part II: Getting a Diagnosis and Drafting a Plan 
Making the right moves if you’re a veteran
If you’re a military vet who can prove that you
have combat-related PTSD, you’re entitled to
treatment at a Veteran’s Affairs Hospital or Vet
Center (see Chapter 6) and, in some cases, to
financial compensation. First, however, you
need to prove two things:
 That you have PTSD: To demonstrate that
you have PTSD, you need a diagnosis from a
medical professional (psychiatrist, psychol-
ogist, therapist, or social worker), preferably
one with extensive experience in diagnosing
PTSD. Many vets recommend getting your
initial diagnosis from a private professional
rather than starting with a VA doctor.
 That your PTSD is linked to a stressful event
that happened during your military service:
The Compensation and Pension Service of
the Veterans Benefits Administration — not
your doctor or therapist — makes this deci-
sion, based on information you provide.
The professional who initially diagnoses you
needs to write an extensive report, offering
information on your diagnosis, the link between
your PTSD and your military service, and the
connection between your PTSD and any other
problems such as drug or alcohol abuse.
That’s just step 1, because the Veterans Admin-
istration (VA) then schedules a second exam to
confirm your diagnosis. This exam can include
extensive interviews and a lot of paperwork.
Convincing the VA that your PTSD is service-
related can be a challenge. This step is pretty
cut-and-dried if you have a Purple Heart or
other solid evidence of combat experience, but
otherwise, the VA may balk. If you need assis-
tance, call in the troops in the form of a Veterans
Service Organization (VSO) that can hook you
up with a Service Officer to help you. (This
assistance is free, and many Service Officers
are pros at navigating the murky waters of gov-
ernment bureaucracy.) To find a VSO that can
help you, go to www1.va.gov/vso.
For more information on getting a diagnosis and
proving that your diagnosis is combat-related,
see the VA’s Web site, www.va.gov, or the VA-
sponsored National Center for Posttraumatic
Stress Disorder at www.ncptsd.va.gov.

Building Your Treatment Team
In This Chapter
 Assembling the right team to meet your needs
 Looking at the professionals who treat PTSD
 Getting referrals and recommendations
 Interviewing a prospective therapist
A
s you prepare to take on your PTSD, visualize the path that lies ahead of
you. It’s full of twists and turns and even some sheer cliffs to scale. You
may get off to some false starts or even feel lost and frightened at times. But
the farther you go, the less threatening and more rewarding your journey
becomes. With each step, you draw closer to your goal: strength, happiness,
a regained sense of connectedness, and healing.
That’s not to say that the journey is short or simple. It isn’t. That’s why 
picking the best treatment team to guide you is so crucial. The people who
help you face and fight PTSD are partners in the most difficult and important
quest you’ll ever undertake — the quest to get your life back — so take time
to choose them carefully.
The task of picking a therapist can be frustrating, but don’t let it slow you
down. Just think of it as the next hurdle for you to catapult over on your road
to healing — a much smaller challenge than the mountain you already con-
quered simply by saying, “I have PTSD.” In this chapter, I help you tackle this
job by describing the different types of therapists who treat PTSD and where
to locate them. I also explain how to start off on the right foot by interviewing
potential therapists before you decide which one is the best guide for the
journey you’re about to undertake.
Taking the Whole-Person Approach
If you’re like many PTSD survivors, you’re fighting more than one problem
right now. Alcoholism, substance abuse, and mental disorders such as
depression often go hand-in-hand with PTSD (see Chapters 3 and 8 for more

information), and you can enhance your recovery by confronting and han-
dling all these issues. As doctors are fond of saying, “If you have five nails in
your shoe and remove only one, you’ll still have a sore foot.”
Often, therapists recommend that you first get treatment for any mental dis-
orders and then address issues with alcohol or drugs before you start psy-
chotherapy for PTSD. Another approach is to tackle the biggest problem first.
For instance, if you’re an at-risk drinker but not an alcoholic and you have
severe PTSD symptoms, starting with your PTSD symptoms may make sense.
Still another technique that’s gaining favor is to tackle your problems as a
whole (see Chapter 8).
No matter which approach proves to be right for you, your primary care
doctor can offer help in assembling the team that best suits your needs.
When you talk to your doctor, be honest about all your medical issues —
even if doing so is difficult or embarrassing — so you and your doctor can
develop a plan to treat all aspects of your condition. Trust me: Nothing
impresses a doctor more than a patient with the courage to say, “I have a
drinking problem (or a drug problem, or frightening mental symptoms) —
and I need your help.” The patients who give us heartburn are the ones who
can’t take this step.
As soon as your doctor has the full picture, he or she can find out what your
insurance will cover and can give you referrals to each professional who
should be part of your team.
If your recovery plan includes getting help for a mental disorder and/or
addiction as well as PTSD, your treatment may include — in addition to the
therapist treating your PTSD symptoms — some or all of these professionals:
 Counselors or therapists specially trained to treat alcoholism or drug
addiction
 A physician, psychiatric nurse, or psychiatric nurse practitioner capable
of prescribing medications needed to address your substance abuse
issues or your particular mental disorder
 A social worker who can help you with issues related to your job, hous-
ing, or finances
When you start therapy, keep all the members of your team up-to-date about
every treatment you’re receiving. That way, they won’t duplicate efforts or
step on each other’s toes.
100
Part II: Getting a Diagnosis and Drafting a Plan 

Considering Your Options
Finding a therapist to treat your PTSD isn’t as easy as picking a name from
the phone book. No single therapy is best for every PTSD survivor, and many
factors — including the type of trauma you suffered, your financial resources,
and the other health issues you’re addressing — play a big part in which
therapist you choose.
Before you get started selecting the therapist who’s right for you, you should
know who’s out there. In this section, I give you the lowdown on the different
types of professionals who treat PTSD and the advantages and limitations of
each. With this info in hand, you’ll have a good idea about what each one can
and can’t do for you. When you’re ready to begin your search, head to the
section on picking the professional who best suits your needs.
Each type of professional has a different set of skills, but your therapist’s title
is less important than you’d think. What matters most is that you click with
your therapist and that the person you choose is an expert with plenty of
experience in the type of therapy you select.
Psychiatrists
A psychiatrist is a medical doctor (MD) with special training in treating disor-
ders that affect thinking and behavior. Because psychiatrists are MDs, they 
can prescribe medications. This option can be a big help if you’re battling 
additional problems such as depression or alcoholism, which may require drug
treatments. A psychiatrist also can identify medical problems that can cause or
worsen symptoms of anxiety or depression (see Chapter 7 for more on this).
A psychiatrist is by far the best choice if you have severe symptoms and
especially if you have suicidal thoughts or violent impulses. This doctor is
also the best option if you have any significant health problems.
Not all psychiatrists, however, practice psychotherapy, which is the core treat-
ment for PTSD. Also, not all insurers cover PTSD treatment by a psychiatrist.
Clinical psychologists
Clinical psychologists are doctors but not MDs. Instead, they have doctoral
degrees in clinical, research, or educational psychology. Typically, they list a
PhD, PsyD, or EdD after their names. To be licensed, a clinical psychologist
needs to have completed 6 or 7 years of graduate classes and clinical training.
101
Chapter 6: Building Your Treatment Team

Clinical psychologists are often highly trained in psychotherapy, and many
have particular expertise in PTSD. Also, your insurer may require you to see
a psychologist rather than a psychiatrist because it’s less expensive.
On the other hand, except in New Mexico and Louisiana, clinical psycholo-
gists can’t prescribe medications. Thus, they may not be the best choice if
you have severe PTSD or additional problems such as depression or sub-
stance abuse. They also can’t check for the medical disorders that can be
invisible culprits in PTSD.
Clinical social workers
Clinical social workers (CSWs) earn their master’s degrees or doctorates 
in social work. Licensed clinical social workers (LCSWs) are trained in 
psychotherapy, and they often treat PTSD. They can be an excellent option 
if you don’t have severe PTSD and don’t have complicating health or sub-
stance abuse issues.
Because licensed clinical social workers don’t always receive as much
upfront training as psychiatrists or clinical psychologists, you should look for
an experienced LCSW who specializes in treating PTSD if you choose to go
this route.
Psychiatric nurses and nurse practitioners
Psychiatric nursing is a relatively new specialty in nursing. Advanced practice
registered nurses (APRNs) have master’s degrees and can assess, diagnose,
and treat problems such as PTSD. In most states, they can also prescribe
medications. Although they have less training than psychiatrists, they offer
some of the advantages of a medical doctor and can be more cost-effective.
Professional counselors and pastoral 
(religious) counselors
Among professional and pastoral counselors, you can find dedicated and bril-
liant therapists. The catch? Because counselor is a catch-all term, you may get
a highly experienced therapist, or you may wind up with a complete amateur
who does more harm than good.
If you’re thinking of choosing a professional or pastoral counselor, ask what spe-
cific training the person has in treating PTSD. And because counseling is less
intense than therapy, put this option low on your list if you have moderate or
severe PTSD. It may be your best bet, however, if your PTSD symptoms are mild.
102
Part II: Getting a Diagnosis and Drafting a Plan 

Marriage and family therapists
Marriage and family therapists look at problems such as PTSD in the context
of a person’s personal relationships. This setup can be an asset if you have a
committed partner who’s willing to commit to the healing process with you.
However, a 1995 survey by Consumer Reports found that people in therapy
rated marriage and family counselors as far less effective than psychiatrists,
psychologists, and clinical social workers.
Marriage and family therapists typically have a master’s degree or doctorate
in psychology, psychiatry, social work, nursing, pastoral counseling, or edu-
cation. But qualifications vary widely, so if you decide to go with a marriage
or family therapist, be sure the person you pick is licensed and has experi-
ence in treating PTSD.
Non-psychiatrist MDs
Very few family doctors are experts on PTSD, so your primary care physician
shouldn’t play a big role in your day-to-day treatment. However, he or she can
help a great deal by providing referrals and monitoring your progress. Your
doctor can also help you address health habits — poor diet, smoking, and 
so on — that often accompany PTSD and can make recovery harder.
If you choose a therapist who’s not an MD, seeing your family care provider
before starting treatment is vital. Ask for a complete workup to identify any
medical issues that can cause or worsen PTSD symptoms.
If you’re seeing a clinical psychiatrist or social worker who can’t prescribe
medications, your therapist may be able to work hand-in-hand with your pri-
mary care physician if you need drug treatments.
Finding a Therapist
After you have an idea of what type of therapist to look for, you can begin
your search. Of course, your insurance company has a big say in what type of
treatment you receive, so talk with their reps before you start your search for
a therapist.
Note: If you’re a military veteran who qualifies for a diagnosis of PTSD, you
can get free treatment through Veterans Affairs Medical Centers. (See the
“Taking advantage of your veteran status” sidebar, later in this chapter.)
103
Chapter 6: Building Your Treatment Team

First things first: Consulting your insurance
company (or other resources)
Before you start calling therapists’ offices, you need to make a call to your
insurance company. Different plans offer different types of coverage for PTSD
treatment, so ask your insurer
 Whether the treatment you’re seeking is covered by your plan
 If so, what percentage of the cost is covered
 Whether there’s a limit to how many hours of treatment your insurance
will cover or which type of therapist you can use
If you don’t have insurance, you still have options. Here are some resources
you can try:
 Community clinics: Such places often offer mental health care for free
or for a reduced charge.
 Your place of worship: Some religious organizations can help you find
free or low-cost pastoral (religiously oriented) counseling.
 Self-help groups: Many communities have free self-help groups led by a
professional.
 Government programs: You may qualify for programs, such as
Medicaid, that can help cover the costs of therapy.
 Programs that compensate victims of crime: Every state in the U.S. 
has one of these programs. To locate the program in your state, use 
the directory provided by the Office for Victims of Crime (a program of
the U.S. Department of Justice) at www.ojp.usdoj.gov/ovc/help/
progdir.htm.
If you need help exploring these options, these organizations can assist you:
 The National Mental Health Information Center (mentalhealth.
samhsa.gov/default.asp) can provide referrals and assistance.
 The American Association of Pastoral Counselors (www.aapc.org) can
refer you to religion-based counselors.
 The National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (www.nami.org) offers refer-
rals and sponsors self-help groups and online communities where you
can find support and advice.
If you’re a college or university student, visit your campus clinic and ask
what resources are available. If the clinic doesn’t offer PTSD counseling, the
staff may be able to steer you to free or low-cost community programs.
104
Part II: Getting a Diagnosis and Drafting a Plan 

Networking your way to a good therapist
Finding a good therapist is much like finding any other good thing in life: The
best way to begin is by asking the people you respect for recommendations.
One good way to start is by asking your primary care doctor for a referral. If
you prefer to have a variety of options, consider asking the following people
whether they have any recommendations:
 Friends or relatives you trust
 A minister, priest, or rabbi
 The social services department at your local hospital
 A local support group for individuals with PTSD or anxiety disorders
 A university clinic (if you’re a student)
 Your employer’s human resources department
Note: If you decide to consult your work’s HR department, do so cautiously if
you prefer to keep your treatment confidential. If you have any doubts about
your company’s ethics when it comes to employees with medical issues,
avoid this strategy. In a perfect world, getting treatment for PTSD wouldn’t
affect your job . . . but this isn’t a perfect world.
105
Chapter 6: Building Your Treatment Team
Taking advantage of your veteran status
If you’re a military veteran, the first step in get-
ting help is to establish that you have PTSD and
that your disability stems from your military ser-
vice. For information on this process, see
Chapter 5.
After you qualify for treatment, you’re eligible
for a wide range of free services. Veterans
Affairs Medical Centers (VAs) offer outpatient,
brief-treatment, and residential programs,
including programs designed to treat both PTSD
and substance abuse. They also offer special
PTSD programs for women. The VA’s treatment
teams typically include psychiatrists, psycholo-
gists, social workers, counselors, and nurses.
In addition, more than 200 community-based Vet
Centers, staffed by health care providers (many
of them combat veterans), also offer what’s
called readjustment counseling. This service
can include individual, group, and marriage and
family counseling, as well as help in finding a
job. In addition, these centers offer a safe haven
where you can get moral support and practical
advice from people who’ve walked in your
boots. To find a Vet Center near you, visit
www.vetcenter.va.gov.

If you need additional help in finding the right person, here are some excel-
lent resources:
 The Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies (www.aabt.org),
a professional organization, offers a database of therapists trained in PTSD
therapy.
 The Madison Institute of Medicine (www.miminc.org), a nonprofit orga-
nization, sponsors an online referral network that lists professionals
with expertise in treating PTSD.
 The Anxiety Disorders Association of America (www.adaa.org) pro-
vides a referral network for both professionals and self-help groups.
 The Sidran Institute (www.sidran.org) offers referrals to qualified
therapists.
If you have a friend, relative, or client who’s a therapist, ask whether he or
she can recommend a colleague. But remember these tips:
 As close as you may be to your business clients, always exercise the rule
about not mixing your business and personal lives. It complicates issues
a thousandfold if you use a therapist who’s a client of your law firm or a
customer of your plumbing service, so pick someone you won’t see out-
side of the therapeutic relationship.
 Don’t ask a relative or friend to be your therapist — it’s unethical, and it
doesn’t work.
No matter who refers a candidate, do your own homework. Don’t assume 
that anyone who claims to be a counselor or a therapist has any expertise in
helping people with PTSD. In some states, those two terms can be used by
just about anybody. Make sure the therapist you pick has good training —
preferably a master’s degree or doctorate — and at least a few years of 
experience in treating PTSD.
If your symptoms are severe or complicated by drug or alcohol abuse, be
sure you’re treated by a medical doctor (at least initially). If you’re suicidal or
in crisis, you may need emergency treatment or temporary hospitalization.
Making Sure You Meet Your Match
Picking a therapist isn’t as easy as choosing a dentist. Your relationship with
your therapist can be very intense, and you’ll weather some major storms
together. In a sense, you’re putting your future in this person’s hands. So take
time to find someone you like and trust, and listen to your gut instincts. If you
have good vibes on your first visit, you’re likely to have a rewarding long-
term relationship as well.
106
Part II: Getting a Diagnosis and Drafting a Plan 

When you understand the terms of your insurance coverage and know what
type of therapist you’d like and can afford, your best plan is to make a short
list of three or four prospects and schedule an appointment to interview each
one. If you have lots of choices, narrow your list to therapists close to your
home. That way, following through on your commitment will be much easier.
Interviewing your prospects
Don’t hesitate to ask your potential therapist lots of questions, because that’s
the best way to know whether you’re a good match. A good therapist wel-
comes your questions if they’re appropriate. (What’s not appropriate? In gen-
eral, questions about the therapist’s personal life.) Here are some of the best
questions to ask:
 “What training do you have?” Unless you’re absolutely certain that a
therapist is good enough to make up for the lack of a degree, choose
someone with at least a master’s degree in a field related to counseling
or therapy. Also insist on someone who’s licensed. A lack of licensing is
a deal-breaker because it means you have no real assurance that the
therapist is qualified. Also, if you pick a licensed professional, you’ll be
able to appeal to the licensing agency if problems arise.
 “How much experience do you have?” Good therapists have a gift for
helping other people, but even the best get better through trial-and-
error. If possible, pick someone with at least four or five years of experi-
ence in treating people with PTSD, because such therapists have a
better grasp of what works and what doesn’t.
 “What approaches do you use?” Different therapies work for different
people, and you’re the best judge of what’s right for you. Review
Chapters 8 and 10, which outline the most popular therapies for PTSD,
and see whether your prospective therapist uses the approaches that
make the most sense to you. (If not, ask why. A good therapist is glad to
explain, and you may change your mind.)
 “What’s your feeling about using medications?” There’s no one-size-
fits-all answer to this question, but it’s helpful if you and your therapist
have similar philosophies about the role and limitations of drug thera-
pies in treating PTSD. Before you start interviewing therapists, reading
Chapter 9 (on medications in PTSD treatment) is a good idea.
Be wary of any doctor who recommends drugs as a sole or primary
treatment. The consensus of both medical and nonmedical professionals
who treat PTSD is that psychotherapy is the most effective approach to
treating PTSD.
107
Chapter 6: Building Your Treatment Team

 “What’s your philosophy about the therapist/client relationship?”
Look for a therapist who’ll work with you as an active partner in the
healing process. Your therapist should respect your opinions and con-
cerns and recognize that when it comes to the causes and symptoms of
your own PTSD, you’re the expert.
At times during treatment, your therapist will ask you to do things that
are alarming or unpleasant in order to help you face and overcome your
fears. If you have a relationship of trust and mutual respect, going
through these experiences as a team will be easier for you.
 “Will you be sensitive to my cultural or religious beliefs?” A therapist
who doesn’t understand cultural differences can misinterpret a client’s
remarks, miss signs of recovery or crisis, or make other major errors
that impede recovery. One who’s grossly insensitive to a client’s reli-
gious or cultural beliefs can do even greater harm by sowing the seeds
for additional trauma, doubt, and discord in a patient’s life.
What your therapist’s own beliefs are doesn’t matter (and a good thera-
pist probably won’t tell you what they are) — but it matters a great deal
that he or she can work within the framework of your culture or religion.
Don’t hesitate to ask whether your therapist has experience working
with people from your culture or religious background or whether he or
she has strong views about your religious beliefs that may interfere with
your therapy.
 “What’s your session schedule like?” Find out whether your prospec-
tive therapist can see you at times that suit your lifestyle. The better
your schedules mesh, the more likely it is that you’ll make it to all your
appointments — and that’s a big key to recovery.
 “How much will my therapy cost?” Patients often hesitate to ask this
question, but they shouldn’t. The time to handle money matters is now,
before you commit to a therapist and a plan of action. A good therapist
checks with your insurance, finds out what’s covered, and gives you a
ballpark figure of what your out-of-pocket costs will be. Also ask whether
the therapist accepts direct payments from your insurer or if you need
to pay upfront and be reimbursed by your insurance plan.
 “How long is my therapy likely to last?” A therapist who’s seeing you
for the first time typically can’t tell you exactly how many sessions you’ll
need, because each patient is unique. However, you should be able to
get an idea about whether your therapy will be short-term or long-term.
The length depends, in large part, on the type of approach you select
and the severity of your symptoms. If your insurance doesn’t cover long-
term therapy, a professional who insists on this type of approach may
not be best for you.
 “Can I reach you outside office hours?” Therapists have their own
lives, but they should be reachable (or have someone on call to forward
messages) if you have a real emergency. Find out whether your potential
therapist is willing to take calls outside of office hours in times of crisis.
108
Part II: Getting a Diagnosis and Drafting a Plan 

Evaluating the candidates
After you interview all your candidates, analyze your feelings and the infor-
mation each prospective therapist offered. Ask yourself the following:
 Which therapist has the best credentials and qualifications?
 Which one has the most experience in treating PTSD?
 Which one made you feel the most comfortable?
 Who seemed the most in tune with you?
 Whose approach to therapy seems best for you?
 Whose schedule and costs best suit your lifestyle and finances?
Your answers to these questions can steer you to the best therapist for you.
(And don’t feel bad about the runners-up. Therapists understand all about a
concept called goodness of fit, which, translated into plain English, means,
“I’m okay, and you’re okay — but we may not be right for each other.”)
As you make your decision, listen to your gut — even if your feelings don’t
seem fair to your candidate. For instance, if you were assaulted by a 6-foot-2
red-headed Yale grad, then a therapist who’s a tall redhead from Yale proba-
bly isn’t the best choice for you — even though he may be the best therapist
in the world. Normally I advise people to overcome mindless prejudices, but
now may not be the time.
After you make your choice, keep your momentum going by calling right
away and booking the first convenient appointment time.
Working with Your Therapist
Finding a therapist you like and trust is crucial, but don’t worry if your 
leading candidate doesn’t score a perfect ten during your initial meeting.
Therapists, like their clients, are human, and each has strong points and
weaknesses. As long as you click on the important points (see the preceding
section), don’t sweat the details.
Also, remember that your relationship with your therapist, although it’s
important, isn’t necessarily long-term. Give your therapist a fair chance — at
least a few months — but if it isn’t working at all (see Chapter 11 for more on
this), feel free to look for someone new. And remember that each step you
take in your therapy (even if it seems like a misstep at the time) is bringing
you one step closer to healing. All that matters is that you keep walking!

The First Steps toward Healing
In This Chapter
 Making your environment safer
 Handling problem people who can sabotage your therapy
 Recognizing drug or alcohol abuse issues
 Addressing coexisting mental health problems
 Preparing to start therapy sessions
P
icture this: You’re a world-class swimmer aiming for a gold medal in 
the Olympics. The big day arrives, and you’re crouched on the starting
block waiting for the starter’s pistol to go off — and suddenly you notice a 
10-pound ball-and-chain attached to your ankle.
It’s a silly image, but it illustrates a very serious point: Just like an Olympic
swimmer, you’re embarking on one of the most important jobs of your life. 
In fact, your mission is far more crucial than winning a medal because the
therapy you’re starting can get your entire life back on track. But therapy is
hard work, and you’ll have greater success if you’re not saddled with physi-
cal, emotional, or mental health problems that can weigh you down.
In this chapter, I look at some of the biggest burdens that can get in the way
of healing: a dangerous environment, unsupportive people, untreated drug 
or alcohol problems, and coexisting mental health problems that may compli-
cate recovery. In addition to talking about how these problems affect you, I
offer suggestions for taking control of them so you can head into therapy
with more strength, energy, and resilience. In addition, I offer tips on identify-
ing the right moment to start your therapy sessions and what you can expect
when you meet with your therapist for the first time.

Making Sure You’re Safe
To work toward healing in therapy, you need to start in a safe place — both
inside and outside of the therapy room. Unfortunately, that’s sometimes
easier said than done. An inner-city resident who can’t afford a safer neigh-
borhood or a person who’s being harassed by a stalker is in some degree of
danger no matter what steps she takes to protect herself.
In many cases, however, you can make big or small changes to increase your
safety. (For advice on getting your basic needs taken care of and regaining a
sense of control in your life, please see Chapter 4.)
Seeing safety’s role in helping you heal
The biggest reason for taking steps to ensure your safety, of course, is to pro-
tect your health and your life. In addition, each step you take to make your
life safer can better prepare you for therapy and for healing from PTSD.
That’s because
 The safer your situation, the easier it is to keep your PTSD triggers
under control.
 When you’re living in an unsafe situation, your nervous system is stuck
on red alert — and therapy works best if you’re calm and as relaxed as
possible.
 A dangerous life situation constantly distracts you from the work you
need to do in order to heal.
 Dangerous situations set the stage for new traumas so that healing
becomes harder and harder as time goes on.
One big danger that many people with PTSD face is ongoing abuse by a vio-
lent spouse, partner, or relative. In fact, domestic violence is a leading cause
of severe PTSD, and ongoing abuse makes healing nearly impossible.
If you’re trapped in an abusive relationship — whether it’s psychological,
sexual, or physical abuse — take any steps you can to get out of the situa-
tion. Otherwise, therapy can help only to a limited degree because you can’t
put a trauma in the past if it’s still happening. Also, chronic, long-term trauma
can lead to complex PTSD (see Chapter 3), a condition that’s much harder to
treat than PTSD stemming from an isolated event. And most important of all,
your life and your future are at stake.
112
Part II: Getting a Diagnosis and Drafting a Plan 

Finding help if you feel harassed or abused
Where can you find help if you have an abusive partner or if you’re a senior
citizen or child who’s being abused by a family member? Going to the police
is an obvious first choice, but sometimes battered partners, children, or
seniors have reasons for hesitating to take this route. If you want to avoid
that option, here are some other good places to seek help:
 Online resources such as
• The National Domestic Violence Hotline (www.ndvh.org): You
can also reach this hotline at 1-800-799-7233 (1-800-799-SAFE).
• Safe Horizon (www.safehorizon.org): This site offers advice on
how to leave an abusive relationship and provides a virtual tour of
a domestic violence shelter to help you decide whether moving
into a shelter is the right option for you.
Note: If you’re worried about your partner’s discovering that you’re
using the Internet to find ways of getting out of an abusive situation, use
your public library’s computers instead — or consult someone who’s
savvy about computers to get info on how to delete the cyber trail you
leave on your computer when you do Internet searches.
 Your local battered women’s shelter (you can find these in your local
phone directory, usually under a heading such as “Crisis Intervention”
or “Domestic Violence Information”)
 Your local Child Protective Services or Adult Protective Services agency
 A place of worship
 Your doctor
 A teacher or school counselor, if you’re a minor
Another situation that can cause or complicate PTSD is long-term harassment
by a stalker — often an ex-lover or ex-spouse. If this is happening to you and
police can’t catch the perpetrator (or they don’t have enough evidence to
arrest the person), here are some good resources that can help you protect
yourself:
 Safe Horizon: This group (also a domestic violence resource) offers
valuable info about steps you can take if you’re being stalked. Visit
www.safehorizon.org.
 The Stalking Resource Center: Check out this service, provided by the
National Center for Victims of Crime, at www.ncvc.org/src.
If you can’t get out of an abusive or threatening relationship before you begin
therapy, your therapist can help you find ways to escape this situation. Bring
this subject up immediately so your therapist knows the score right off the bat.

Chapter 7: Setting the Stage for Recovery: The First Steps toward Healing

Ditching the Negative Nellies 
Who Can Sabotage Recovery
Sometimes, roadblocks to success in therapy don’t stem from your own fears
but from other people’s failure to support or protect you. Worse yet, the
people around you may actively put you in danger. If you’re in either of these
situations, now’s the time to take stock of your relationships and see whether
you need to make changes before you start therapy.
When you surround yourself with people who love and support you, weather-
ing storms — and soaring when the skies are clear — is easier (see Chapter 13
for ways you can help these good people help you). Conversely, if you let
stress-producing, energy-sapping people control your life, they can magnify
your problems and stand in the way of your victories. That’s why sidelining
the emotional vampires is an excellent move as you prepare to start therapy.
If your Negative Nellies are absolutely unavoidable, don’t panic. As soon as
you’re in treatment, your therapist can help you find ways to deal with prob-
lem people. But if you can get some of these jerks out of your life before ther-
apy, you’ll be ahead of the game when you start. In this section, I tell you how
to spot the people who can sabotage your success, and I offer advice on get-
ting them out of the picture so they can’t harm you.
Spotting the people who can 
hamstring your healing
How can you spot the turkeys who may hold you back as you head into ther-
apy? Some people, such as a spouse who hits you or threatens your life, are
clearly bad news. However, most jerks trip you up in more subtle ways: a dis-
couraging word here, a subtle chop to your self-esteem there. Added up over
time, those digs have the power to sap your confidence, steer you away from
positive goals, and weaken your resolve to heal. In the following sections, I
explain how to tell these people apart from the supportive folks you want to
keep in your life, and I describe the most common varieties of negative
people you’re likely to encounter.
Sorting out the good guys from the bad guys
The good people in your life come in lots of varieties: the true-blue friend, the
lover who sticks by you through the rough spots, the boss who lets you take
off early for therapy sessions without docking your pay, the parent who’s
always in your corner. Keeping these people close at hand when you begin
the tough work of therapy is crucial.
114
Part II: Getting a Diagnosis and Drafting a Plan 

Negative people, too, come in different varieties — and each one can inter-
fere with your healing. If you can get at least some of these folks out of the
picture prior to starting therapy, you’ll be much better off.
In the following section, I describe some of the most common types of prob-
lem people to watch out for. Of course, as you read through this list, you may
spot some behaviors that you (and everyone else you know) exhibit now and
then. That’s because nobody’s Suzy Sunshine all the time.
So how can you tell the difference between a negative person who needs the
boot and a good guy who deserves some slack when he’s acting like a scamp?
Here are some pointers:
 Look for a pattern. A negative person exhibits toxic behaviors chroni-
cally, day in and day out, to a degree that seriously affects your relation-
ship with him.
 Look for a reason. The nicest person in the world can behave badly if
he’s dealing with a serious problem — for example, if he’s undergoing
chemotherapy or he just lost his job (or if he’s battling PTSD!). A nega-
tive person, however, exhibits bad behaviors even when he doesn’t have
any major life problems that could justify his awful actions.
 Look honestly at your role — if any — in causing the behavior. For
instance, if you have PTSD, your loved ones may develop a pattern of
behaving called codependency. In other words, they develop a set of 
dysfunctional behaviors in response to your dysfunctional behaviors.
They do this because it’s the only way they can think of to survive in a
stressful environment. (For more info on this situation, see Chapter 13.)
Codependency doesn’t mean that they’re negative influences in your life.
It just means they’re stuck in the PTSD trap right along with you. So if
any of the people you love exhibit codependent behaviors, don’t cut
them out of your life; instead, get them into therapy with you!
General personality types to watch out for
If you analyze your relationships carefully, you can get a good feel for who
should stay and who should go. Here’s my short list of people to show the
door if possible (if not, the next section offers some suggestions for dealing
with them):
 Haters: These people live in a constant state of anger and hostility. 
They turn every minor issue into a major confrontation, and they don’t
compromise — they just get madder and madder until they get their
own way. You can’t win with these people, because no matter how much
you sacrifice your own needs to keep the peace, they’ll be angry again
an hour later.
A hater can mess up your therapy by keeping you tied up in knots 
emotionally when you need to be calm and relaxed — and by forcing 
you to ignore your own needs and feelings in order to cater to hers.
115
Chapter 7: Setting the Stage for Recovery: The First Steps toward Healing

 Whiners: A whiner is a low-level, annoying variant of the hater. (Think of
the hater as an emotional sledgehammer and the whiner as a mosquito
that drives you crazy.) No matter what you do, a whiner isn’t happy with
you, anyone else, or the world in general. The first sentence out of a
whiner’s mouth in the morning, and the last sentence at night, is gener-
ally a complaint.
Because whiners are so negative, they drag you down, too. You don’t
need that when you’re being buffeted by the strong feelings that therapy
can trigger.
 Weepers: This type of person falls apart at the least whiff of a problem. 
If you’re stuck with a weeper in your life, you spend much of your time
walking on eggshells because you’re terrified that a stray remark or
minor disagreement will send the person spiraling into a scene worthy
of a daytime soap actor. Just like haters, weepers get their own way all
the time — but they do it by playing on your guilt, your sympathy, or
your urge for peace and quiet.
A weeper can sabotage your therapy by focusing all your attention on her
drama-queen antics when you need to be focusing on helping yourself.
 Esteem sappers: Remember kryptonite — that green rock that makes
Superman feel weak as a kitten when he gets close to it? If you think
about it, you may realize that certain people affect you the same way.
For example, if you say, “I lost 6 pounds!” the Human Kryptonite may
say, “Wow, that’s great. Another 20 pounds, and that double chin will
start to go away.”
This kind of person makes you feel a little weaker, a little less compe-
tent, or a little more flawed after each encounter with him. That’s espe-
cially harmful during therapy, when you need to recognize and build on
your strengths, not magnify your weaknesses.
 Bullies: Not all bullies hang out at the playground. Many are adults who
pick on co-workers, relatives, or even lovers. Bullies target people they
think are weak and twist the knife in them every chance they get.
Bullies are bad for your mental and physical health, especially when
you’re tackling the challenging task of therapy. They push all the wrong
buttons, triggering your PTSD symptoms and sending your anxiety
levels through the roof. A bullying boss, for example, can send you into 
a tailspin by constantly ridiculing or browbeating you in front of your
colleagues.
 Scapegoaters: In these people’s eyes, it’s all your fault, all the time. If
your girlfriend is a scapegoater, for example, she may constantly say
things like, “You’re the reason I don’t go back to college. If you made
more money, we wouldn’t need to share the rent and I could afford
school.”
116
Part II: Getting a Diagnosis and Drafting a Plan 

Scapegoaters get in the way of therapy because they constantly rein-
force your own negative thoughts and feelings. When you’re trying to
offload toxic ideas such as “everything’s my fault” or “I’m to blame for
what happened in my trauma,” a scapegoater is the last person you need
in your life.
 Narcissists: To the narcissist, it’s all about him. The whole world’s a
stage, and he’s the only actor on it. Your role, in his eyes, is to sit in 
the audience and applaud.
A narcissist can be very dangerous when you’re trying to heal from
PTSD because therapy asks you to focus on your own thoughts and
needs — and the narcissist doesn’t like it when you turn your attention
away from him. As a result, he may try to undermine your new feelings
of confidence and happiness.
Saying goodbye to toxic people
If you spot destructive people in your life, don’t let them continue to walk all
over you — take action! (I call it doing a “jerkectomy.”) The following sections
mention some steps you can take to eliminate or reduce the influence these
people have on you.
Disconnect if you can
If you don’t have any hard-to-break ties to a toxic person, the best approach
is often simply to walk away. To decide whether that’s the best idea, look
carefully at your relationship with the problem person and ask yourself the
following:
 Do you really need this person in your life?
 If you have an emotional or sexual relationship with this person, would
being alone really be worse than the problems the person creates?
If the answer to these questions is no, either say goodbye or do a gradual
fade. Try to get the person out of your life before you start therapy — but if
you can, do it in a cordial way with no hard feelings so he or she won’t make
trouble for you in the future.
Minimize contact if possible
If you’re stuck with a problem person — for instance, if your dad’s a hater,
your boss is an esteem-sapper, or you’re sharing your home with a whiny
grandparent — think of ways to keep your contact with the person to a mini-
mum. For instance,
117
Chapter 7: Setting the Stage for Recovery: The First Steps toward Healing

 If Dad expects you over for dinner once a week, tell him you need to cut
down to once a month.
 If your boss is the problem, see whether you can change your work
hours, your assignments, or your physical location in the office in order
to reduce your contact with him during the time you’re in therapy.
 If you’re living in the same house with a problem person and you’re
stuck with the status quo for now, see whether you can find ways to
physically create some space between you. For instance, designate one
room as your therapy room and declare it off-limits to other people for
several hours of the day so you have a peaceful place to relax or do your
therapy homework.
Ask your therapist for help
If negative people are really dragging you down and you’re not in a position
to cut them out of your life, talk with your therapist about this problem
before you even start tackling your PTSD. She can offer powerful strategies
for managing these people’s toxic behaviors.
Facing Substance Abuse Issues
Jacob, a combat veteran, drinks to forget the faces of the friends in his pla-
toon who didn’t come home. Surani, a firefighter, downs a pint of vodka each
night because alcohol numbs the emotions she feels when she remembers
118
Part II: Getting a Diagnosis and Drafting a Plan 
A wake-up call
You don’t need to suffer from PTSD to wake up
and get rid of the toxic people in your life. Three
years ago, someone I know very well had emer-
gency, life-saving surgery. During his recovery,
he had a chance to take a long, hard look at the
stressors in his life — stressors that damaged
his physical health and kept him from enjoying
his life to the fullest.
The biggest stressors, he realized, were the toxic
people in his life — the ones who always made
excuses or blamed others for their problems,
rarely kept promises, didn’t learn from their mis-
takes, wouldn’t cooperate, and were easy to
upset and difficult to please.
In the days after his surgery, he vowed to not let
any new people like these into his life. To this
day, he’s kept that promise — and he’s healthier,
happier, and more successful in every area of
his life as a result.
I know this for a fact, because that someone
was me!

the horrors of 9/11. Mia was raped three years ago; she uses cocaine because
it makes her mind feel less fuzzy on her bad days. Tad survived a terrible car
accident; he smokes pot because it helps him sleep and keeps the nightmares
at bay.
All these people have PTSD, and all of them are getting ready to take a huge
positive step: the step into therapy and a healthier, happier life. To take that
step successfully, they need to address not only their PTSD but also their
substance abuse problems. The same is true for you if you’re battling both
PTSD and substance abuse and you’re serious about getting your life back on
track. In this section, I look at the reasons reliance on drugs or alcohol can
complicate healing — and why you need to face down your substance abuse
issues in order to heal.
Determining whether you’re just using or
abusing (it’s trickier than it seems)
Stress and anxiety send your risk for substance abuse through the ceiling. In
fact, people with anxiety disorders have double or even triple the normal risk
for developing drug or alcohol problems at some point in their lives. And if
you have PTSD — the mother of all anxiety problems — you’re at even
greater risk. (See Chapter 3 for more on the high rate of substance abuse
problems in people with PTSD).
Owning up to a drug or alcohol problem takes great bravery. It’s easier to fall
into the trap of denial and use comforting strategies like the following to
avoid facing your pain:
 Minimizing: In this strategy, you try to make light of a serious problem.
For instance, you may say, “It’s only two drinks a day,” when each of
your drinks contains 4 or 5 ounces of hard liquor.
 Rationalizing: In this strategy, you make excuses for your behavior
instead of facing it. For example, you may say, “Hey, I’m a child of the six-
ties. We all used pot back then, so there’s nothing wrong with smoking a
little now.” Or you may make excuses such as, “Of course I drink. It’s
because the kids drive me nuts.”
Here’s the hard truth: If you have a drug or alcohol problem, the only person
you’re actually fooling with excuses is yourself. And if you’re making excuses
in the first place, that’s pretty strong evidence that you do have a problem.
119

If you’re torn between saying, “I’m fine” and “I need help,” the best favor

honestly. Here are some key questions that can help you decide whether you
have a substance abuse problem; a yes answer to any one of them should tell
you to seek help:
 Have you ever tried to cut back on your drinking or drug use?
 Have family members, friends, co-workers, or loved ones expressed 
concern about your drinking or drug use?
 Do you ever feel ashamed or guilty about your drinking or drug use?
 Have you ever had a drink in the morning to settle yourself down?
 Did your doctor ever express concern about your use of alcohol or drugs?
 Did you ever experience a memory loss or blackout when drinking or
using drugs?
For more guidance in honestly evaluating your drinking or drug use, check

Administration offers an online self-test to help you decide whether you
have an alcohol problem. The test is available at getfit.samhsa.gov/
Alcohol/tests/alcoholtest.aspx.
 A similar test is available from Alcoholscreening.org (www.alcohol
screening.org), a service of Boston University’s School of Public
Health.

Reflecting on how a substance 
addiction worsens PTSD
The problem with substance use, of course, is that a pill or a drink solves
your problems for only a few minutes or a few hours — and the price tag is
steep, especially when you’re dealing with something as devastating as a
trauma and as life-shattering as PTSD. Here are the big downsides to the tem-
porary relief that drugs or drinks offer when you’re struggling with PTSD:
120
Part II: Getting a Diagnosis and Drafting a Plan 

 The helplessness you feel as a result of your PTSD increases tenfold when
you add the helplessness of drug or alcohol dependence or addiction.
 You experience new traumas and greater pain if drug use or an alcohol
problem ruins your relationships, causes you to lose your job, creates
legal troubles, or ruins your health.
 Your craving for drugs or alcohol and your behavior when you’re intoxi-
cated or high can lead you to harm your loved ones emotionally, finan-
cially, and sometimes physically. As addiction experts like to say, “People
with substance abuse problems don’t have families; they have hostages.”
 An untreated drug or alcohol problem can prevent you from seeking
effective treatments for your problems, limit the benefits that these
treatments can offer, and greatly increase the risk of relapse after ther-
apy ends.
The take-home message: Being smart or strong can’t protect you from falling
for the lure of drugs or alcohol when you’re in pain. But if you’re smart, you
know that your future depends on escaping from this trap. And if you’re
strong, you overcome your denial and say those powerful words: “I have a
problem, and I need help.”
Opening up about substance abuse 
to foster therapy gains
If you have PTSD and you feel ashamed about a drug or alcohol problem,
here’s the most important advice I can give you: Don’t! Having a substance
abuse issue does not mean that you’re weak or bad. Instead, it means that
you’re in so much pain that you turned to a desperate short-term solution in
an effort to protect yourself.
As you prepare to enter therapy, you may be tempted to hide a problem with
drugs or alcohol from your therapist (even if you admit this problem to your-
self). However, resist the urge! A smart therapist will figure out what’s going
on, anyway — and more importantly, you’ll only hurt yourself by failing to be
upfront with the person trying to help you. What’s more, your therapist will
not think less of you for admitting your problem. Instead, he’ll admire you for
having the courage to face it head-on.
The best approach, no matter how reluctant you are, is the no-secrets strat-
egy. Be prepared to acknowledge your substance abuse problems at the very
beginning of your relationship with your therapist, and be ready to answer
his questions about these issues:
121
Chapter 7: Setting the Stage for Recovery: The First Steps toward Healing

 How longstanding your substance abuse problem is
 Whether you abuse one substance or several
 The severity of your problem
 What treatments, if any, you’ve undergone for your substance abuse
problem and what effects (good or bad) those treatments had
 Whether the people you live with also have substance abuse problems,
which can greatly complicate your efforts to heal
Addressing these issues upfront is crucial because it enables your therapist
to make important decisions about your treatment. These decisions include
 Whether you’ll benefit more from getting your substance abuse issues
treated first or from tackling them at the same time as your PTSD (for a
look at some therapies that treat both PTSD and substance abuse at the
same time, see Chapter 8)
 Whether inpatient therapy may be more helpful than an outpatient
program
122
Part II: Getting a Diagnosis and Drafting a Plan 
What’s in a name? Understanding the vocabulary
of substance abuse problems
When people talk about drug or alcohol use,
they bandy about terms that can be confusing.
Here’s a quick look at some of them:
 Dependence: If you become dependent on a
drug or alcohol, quitting the drug causes sig-
nificant physical or psychological effects —
for instance, headaches, depression, or
problems in thinking or concentration.
 Tolerance: If you develop a tolerance to a
drug or to alcohol, you need more and more
of it to achieve the same effect. For
instance, if you need two drinks to make
you relax at first and four or five drinks a
couple of years later, your brain and body
are developing a greater tolerance for alco-
hol. (That doesn’t mean, however, that your
body can handle alcohol or drugs more
effectively. In fact, the longer you use drugs
or alcohol and the higher your intake, the
more harmful the physical effects are.)
 Addiction: If you become addicted to a drug
or alcohol, you exhibit three behaviors. The
first is that you lose control over how often
you use the substance. The second is that
you ignore the consequences of your sub-
stance abuse. (For instance, you may con-
tinue to drink even if you lose your license
for driving while intoxicated.) The third is
that your life starts to revolve around get-
ting and using drugs or alcohol.
If any of these terms describe your relationship
with drugs or alcohol, now’s the time to get help.
The sooner you get that help, the higher your
chances of kicking the habit are — although it’s
never too late to free yourself from the chains
of a destructive habit.

 Which type of therapy will benefit you most and how intense it should be
 Whether medications should be part of your treatment plan
 What additional interventions — such as support groups — may help
protect you against relapses
 Whether you and your therapist need to work on getting you into a safer
environment where you’ll have less contact with people involved in drug
or alcohol abuse
In addition, a therapist who’s fully informed about your drug or alcohol
issues can coordinate with other pros if your treatment needs to be a team
effort and can steer you to social and financial resources that can help you
get the drug or alcohol monkey off your back. Kicking a destructive habit is a
very tough but also very achievable mission, and a therapist’s help can often
make the difference between success and failure.
Addressing Any Coexisting 
Mental Disorders
In Chapter 3, I talk about the mental disorders that often occur along with
PTSD. However, any mental disorder can coexist with PTSD. (As doctors like
to say, “Having one problem doesn’t prevent you from having another one.”)
A coexisting mental disorder may either predate your trauma or stem from it.
If you have a mental disorder in addition to your PTSD, you may feel very
much alone — but you shouldn’t. In reality, millions of Americans are living
with one or more mental disorders. To show you just how many people are
walking in your shoes, here are some stats from the National Institute of
Mental Health:
 In any given year, approximately 26 percent of Americans 18 and older
suffer from a diagnosable mental disorder. That’s more than 57 million
people.
 One in every 17 people suffers from a serious mental illness.
 Mental disorders are the leading cause of disability in the U.S. and
Canada for people between the ages of 15 and 44.
 Nearly half of people with a mental disorder meet criteria for two or
more mental disorders.
123
Chapter 7: Setting the Stage for Recovery: The First Steps toward Healing

Tackling PTSD when you have another mental disorder is a challenge, but mil-
lions of people meet that challenge successfully — and you can, too! Here’s
one big key: getting your mental illness under as much control as possible
before you head into the therapy room to address your PTSD. The fewer
problems you have on your plate, the better you’ll do in therapy for PTSD.
Many mental disorders are chronic, but minimizing your symptoms as much
as possible can maximize your therapy gains.
Talking to your current physician
To minimize symptoms of a mental illness before starting therapy for PTSD,
make an appointment with the doctor who manages the treatment of your
mental illness. At this appointment, tell your doctor that you’re planning to
start therapy for PTSD, and have a heart-to-heart talk about the following
issues:
 Are the medications (if any) that you currently take to treat your coexisting
mental disorder working well, and are any side effects as well-controlled as
possible?
 Should you consider additional medical treatments to bring the symp-
toms of your disorder under greater control before starting therapy for
PTSD?
 Is this a good point in your life to start therapy, or are there reasons for
waiting a little while? For example, if your doctor recommends adding,
dropping, or changing your medications, giving your new meds a few
weeks to settle in before you start therapy may be a good idea. That
way, you can handle any side effects that may otherwise interfere with
addressing your PTSD.
During your appointment, be clear to your doctor that you’re very open to the
idea of her communicating with your new therapist. Both professionals will
ask you to sign forms allowing them to exchange information, but they’ll be
even more likely to share their ideas if you give them the green light verbally.
Gathering the info your therapist needs
After your visit to the doctor, gather the materials your new therapist will
need in order to be up-to-speed on your condition. If possible, get copies of
the medical records describing your mental disorder and the treatments
you’ve received. Here’s some information you should have ready:
124
Part II: Getting a Diagnosis and Drafting a Plan 

 Facts about any mental illnesses for which you’ve been treated, even if
you’re not having a problem with these conditions now
 The names and dosages of any medication you’re taking
 How long you’ve been taking these medications
 Any side effects you’re currently experiencing or have experienced in
the past
 Other treatments you’ve undergone — including inpatient therapies,
electroshock therapies, medications, or psychological therapies — and
the results (good or bad) of these therapies
This information can help your therapist plan his own approach, allow him to
watch for drug effects that may complicate the therapy picture, and aid him
in coordinating with the rest of your medical team.
Also, if you suspect that you may have a mental disorder but you don’t have
an official diagnosis, plan to discuss this with your therapist at your first
appointment. Together, you and your therapist can sort out the symptoms
that PTSD can cause and those that may stem from additional disorders so
you can tackle all your issues in the most effective way.
A Few Final Details: Getting 
Your Ducks in a Row
After you address any major life issues, your path is just about cleared for
takeoff. Here are a few additional pieces to put in place so you’re set for suc-
cess when you start your therapy:
 Finalize your plans. Be sure you’re happy with the therapist you
selected and the approach he plans to use. (See Chapter 6 for info on
selecting a therapist and Chapters 8, 9, and 10 for information about 
the different approaches used to treat PTSD.) Also, make sure you’ve
addressed any questions about insurance coverage (see Chapter 6).
 Line up your allies. Tell trusted friends or relatives that you’re starting
therapy. These people can encourage you to stay the course and can
offer practical help — for instance, by driving you to sessions or
babysitting your kids when you’re at the therapist’s office.
 Clear your schedule. Now’s the time to minimize your outside obliga-
tions so you’ll have more time for your own needs. Keep up the activi-
ties you love, but say no to extra work hours or other commitments if
they’ll get in the way of your therapy.
125
Chapter 7: Setting the Stage for Recovery: The First Steps toward Healing

 Handle any logistical issues. Make sure you have a reliable ride to and
from your therapy sessions. If your car’s a little hinky, get it fixed. Don’t
have a car? Get a bus pass and learn the route to your therapist’s office.
Also, make sure you have sitters lined up and have work responsibilities
covered if you need to attend therapy during work hours.
These details are more important than you may think. That’s because at
some challenging points in therapy, you’ll be tempted to use little issues
like this — “Gee, it’s raining, and my brakes aren’t all that reliable” — to
give yourself an out to avoid therapy sessions. The fewer excuses you
have, the more likely you are to do the right thing!
The last and most important stage in preparing for therapy is to get your
game face on. To strengthen your resolve as you start on this new journey,
visualize the future you want — a future in which your hopes and dreams, 
not your fears and nightmares, steer your life. Therapy is the first and most
important step into that future, so head into your first session with hope and
confidence — as well as pride in yourself for having the courage to heal.
Getting Acquainted with Your Therapist
If you interviewed several therapists before picking one (see Chapter 6 for
more on this), you and your therapist will already know a little about each
other. If not, you’ll be starting from scratch. Either way, here’s what to expect.
Right off the bat, your therapist will want a broad overview of the trauma you
survived, what symptoms bother you the most, and when your symptoms
developed. In addition, the therapist will probably bring up the following
topics early on in order to plan an approach that works just right for you:
 Your goals for therapy: The two of you will probably talk upfront about
your expectations and what you can anticipate from your sessions.
 Your ability to confront your trauma and your triggers: Lots of
approaches are in the therapy toolbox, so a good therapist can decide
whether you can benefit more from a slow-and-steady approach or an
all-at-once face-off with your demons. (More on these options later, in
Chapter 8.)
 Your pre-trauma history: Sometimes the trauma you blame for your
symptoms is only the tip of the iceberg, and facing it can bring earlier,
buried traumas back to the surface. Thus, your therapist may ask you
questions about things that happened years or even decades earlier.
126
Part II: Getting a Diagnosis and Drafting a Plan 

 Your readiness: Your therapist will help you decide whether the time is
right for you to start your sessions. For instance, if you’re in the middle
of a divorce and moving to a new home, the therapist may recommend
that you wait a little while. Also, the therapist may decide that first tack-
ling other problems, such as alcohol or substance abuse, makes sense.
(But don’t assume that this will happen; many therapists prefer to treat
these issues at the same time as your PTSD.)
 Your backup bench: Strong support from the people close to you — a
loving spouse or partner, caring relatives, good friends, an Alcoholics
Anonymous sponsor if you have an issue with alcoholism — can be a
huge help. Conversely, relatives or friends who don’t back you up can
impede your progress. It helps if your therapist has a clue upfront about
allies as well as potential skunks at the garden party.
 The ground rules you can expect: Generally, a therapist uses the first
session to outline the basics of your relationship. This info usually
includes the following:
• How long your therapy will take (cognitive behavioral therapy, or
CBT, is usually a short-term therapy, but short-term can mean any-
thing from 1 to 12 months; your therapist can probably give you a
guesstimate, if not a firm answer)
• How much work you’ll need to do outside of your sessions
• What rights and responsibilities you have as a patient
You may also talk about mundane stuff, such as billing and scheduling, just
so you can get those details out of the way and clear the path for the impor-
tant work that lies ahead.

the one that’s best for you. I start by looking at the most

n an old sitcom episode, a character finds a pistol and decides to cash it in
at a New York pawn shop. The clerk sees the gun and hits the alarm
button, and this hapless fellow is arrested. Complications follow, but in the
end, the character convinces the court that he’s innocent. Before letting him
go, however, the judge says, “It is against the law to sell a gun in New York.
What will you do if you find another one?”
“Pawn it in New Jersey,” replies our hero.
What’s the point? That incorrect thoughts can steer you in wrong directions,
which may be funny when you’re talking about pawned firearms but not
when you’re talking about PTSD — a problem that creates patterns of think-
ing that lead to a vicious cycle of helplessness, anxiety, and self-destructive
behavior.
To break that cycle, you need to replace it with a cycle of healing and
resilience — and an excellent way to do that is a treatment called cognitive
behavioral therapy (or CBT for short). CBT has a strong track record in treat-
ing PTSD, so it’s an approach your doctor is likely to recommend. In this
chapter, I look at what CBT is and how well it works as a treatment for PTSD. I
also explain why CBT — although an excellent form of therapy — isn’t the
right treatment for everyone. In addition, I walk you through the steps of CBT
and describe some of its many forms.

132
Part III: Choosing the Right Treatment Approach 
Understanding What CBT Is All About
CBT is a popular and effective treatment for a wide range of disorders. In par-
ticular, it’s a powerful therapy for anxiety disorders, including PTSD. As you
can guess from its name, this therapy addresses two issues:
 Thinking (cognition): The patterns of thinking that PTSD fosters can
keep you trapped in the PTSD cycle. The cognitive part of CBT tackles
these harmful thought patterns and helps you to break free of them.
 Acting: A trauma can lead you to act in ways that get in the way of heal-
ing. The behavioral part of CBT empowers you to spot and change these
behaviors and to replace them with behaviors that work for you.
Because CBT deals with thinking and behavior, some people conclude that a
trauma survivor’s thoughts and behavior caused PTSD in the first place. Far
from it! The trauma is the culprit, and the self-destructive thoughts and
behaviors that result are symptoms — just like the runny nose and icky throat
you get when a cold attacks you. In fact, doctors also use CBT to help people
cope with chronic pain due to back injuries or diseases. You’re in the same
boat — your trauma simply caused a different type of pain.
In the sections that follow, I explain the basic principles that underlie CBT.
The foundation: Key principles 
that guide CBT
CBT is designed to produce results in a short time frame — usually a few
months — so if the word therapy conjures up pictures of spending years on a
couch talking to Sigmund Freud, you can chase those images away. CBT isn’t
the kind of therapy where you look at ink blots or talk about how your mom
toilet-trained you. Instead, it’s a practical approach that’s based on the fol-
lowing principles:
 You’re a strong, resilient person who can develop the tools you need to
get a handle on your PTSD.
 The physical, biochemical, and emotional effects of your trauma created
patterns of thoughts and behaviors that now interfere with your life.
 Just as you can train yourself to kick a soccer ball or play the piano
better, you can change your life by challenging counterproductive cycles
of thinking and behavior and replacing them with effective, self-affirming
thoughts and behaviors.

 You’re an active partner in therapy, and the ultimate goal is for you to
leave with tools you can use to handle your PTSD independently.
 The more information you have about your trauma and how to treat
your symptoms, the better you can heal. That’s why CBT also includes
education about how and why PTSD occurs.
CBT assumes that you’re highly motivated and willing to invest in your recov-
ery. It’s hard work, and your therapist will expect you to do lots of homework
outside of your sessions— for instance, practicing the healing thoughts and
actions you discover in therapy or possibly keeping a journal about your
progress and setbacks. That’s because changing thoughts and behaviors, just
like building muscles or learning to play a Beethoven sonata, takes practice.
The good news is that the more effort you put in upfront, the more rewards
you’re likely to reap down the road.
The focus: Correcting destructive 
thought patterns
If you have PTSD, you suffered a terrible trauma that no one should ever
experience. However, it’s not the trauma itself but the thoughts, behaviors,
and emotions that evolved from this crisis that keep you trapped. In the next
sections, I describe how these negative cycles arise and how CBT can replace
them with positive cycles of thinking and behaving that lead to healing.
Seeing healthy and unhealthy feedback loops in action
A simple thought can hold amazing power. The thought “I’m as good as 
you!” led Rosa Parks to refuse to sit in the back of a bus and jump-started 
the American Civil Rights movement. The thought “You are not hopeless!” 
led Annie Sullivan to give a young blind and deaf child, Helen Keller, the 
tools she needed to become a bestselling author and an inspiration to the
world.
Unfortunately, destructive thoughts have an equally astonishing power to
change lives. (Some patients and therapists like to call these negative useless
thoughts — or NUTs for short!) That’s why chasing these thoughts away is a
key goal of CBT.
To understand how CBT works, think of your thoughts, feelings, and actions 
as interconnected loops: Jiggle one, and you set off a reaction that alters the
133
Chapter 8: Putting PTSD in Its Place with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)

others. Your thoughts affect how you feel and behave, and in turn, your feelings
and behavior affect how you think. Normally, this creates a healthy feedback
loop. Here’s an example:
1. You think, “I’m good with a hammer and saw — I can tackle this broken
gate.”
2. Based on that thought, you get out your hammer and saw, and a few
hours later, presto: Your old, broken gate looks good as new.
3. You feel proud and you think, “Hey, maybe next week I’ll fix that attic
ladder.”
Feedback loops play a big part in PTSD too, but in this case, they create a
vicious cycle. That’s because your trauma generates self-destructive
thoughts and behaviors that feed on each other, creating a downward spiral.
Here’s an example:
1. A man attacks Jane, beats her, and steals her purse as she leaves the
mall at night. Because of this trauma, Jane develops certain thoughts
and beliefs that change how she behaves. One thought, for instance, is
“Going out of the house after dark is very dangerous.”
2. As a result, Jane stops leaving her house at night. She makes so many
excuses to stay home that her boyfriend, initially supportive after her
trauma, finally leaves her, saying, “You’re hopeless. You won’t even go out
to dinner. In fact, you won’t go out the front door at night. That’s just nuts.”
3. Her fears and anxieties, and her boyfriend’s reaction to them, make Jane
think, “I’m going crazy. I can’t even go to the mailbox after dark. There’s
something really wrong with me. I’m getting worse, not better.”
4. To soothe herself when these thoughts upset her, Jane has a drink. It
works at first: A shot of Scotch calms her for at least a half-hour and lets
her read a book or watch TV in peace. That good feeling reinforces her
urge to drink, so she starts having two drinks each night — then three
and then four.
5. Jane’s drinking eases her stress for a few hours, but it brings on a new
wave of self-destructive thoughts: “I’m turning into a lush, just like my
grandpa. I’m weak.” It also makes her even more isolated: She now
refuses to open her door to friends, for fear that they’ll discover her
secret drinking, and sometimes she won’t answer the phone for fear that
people will hear her slurring her words.
6. The more isolated Jane becomes as a result of these new behaviors, the
worse she feels. And the worse she feels, the more she drinks.
134
Part III: Choosing the Right Treatment Approach 

Jane’s story shows how a single counterproductive thought — in this case,
that going outside after dark is dangerous — can start a chain of behaviors,
thoughts, and emotions that break up relationships, alter lifestyles, and even
lead to problems with drugs or alcohol.
Identifying the most common types of negative self-feedback
The list of negative thoughts that can stem from PTSD is virtually endless.
However, these thoughts tend to fall into some common patterns. Here are
some of the typical thoughts that trip up people with PTSD:
 Overgeneralizing thoughts: These types of thoughts occur when you
mistake a single negative event (or person or thing) as part of a bigger
pattern. For instance, if your trauma involved a traffic accident, you may
generalize, “It’s not safe to drive anywhere”; if your trauma involved a
person who attacked you, you may think, “People are cruel.”
Your therapist can help you to spot the error of this thinking. For exam-
ple, if you were assaulted during an evening walk, you may generalize
that “Walking outside in the evening is dangerous.” Your therapist can
help you see that if you took a pleasant stroll around the block every
evening for 20 years before a mugger attacked you one night, then you
had more than 7,300 nice walks and only one time when a trauma
occurred. Giving up your walks, on the tiny chance that a similar trauma
will occur, makes no sense when viewed this way.
 Always/never thoughts: , These thoughts — such as “I always fail,” “I
never win,” “My bosses always hate me,” or “People never give me a fair
shake” — are similar to overgeneralizing thoughts because they make you
follow an extreme course. For instance, you may shun romantic relation-
ships and break bonds with good friends if your always/never thoughts
say, “I can never trust anyone again,” or “I always get hurt by my friends.”
If your always/never thoughts involve people, your therapist may ask
you to consider how many people you’ve known in your entire life and
how many actually hurt you. Odds are, your helped list will be a whole
longer than your hurt list.
 One-side-of-the-equation thoughts: In this kind of thinking, you look at
only one limited (and negative) set of facts when making a decision
instead of considering all the data. For instance, these thoughts may tell
you, “If I avoid dating, I won’t get hurt.” True, maybe, at least in the short
run. But do a loss-versus-benefits analysis, and you realize that in avoiding
the small risk of being hurt by a boyfriend or girlfriend, you give up fun,
sexual pleasure, the possibility of having a family down the road, and the
long-term safety and comfort of having another person who cares about
you deeply. Your therapist can help you see how changing this kind of
toxic thinking can make you happier — and safer — in the long run.
135
Chapter 8: Putting PTSD in Its Place with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)

 Catastrophizing thoughts: These thoughts take several forms. In one,
you mentally transform small events into catastrophes. For example,
you may think, “Oh great, a flat tire. That’s a sure sign things are falling
apart all over again.” In another form, you constantly anticipate the ter-
rible things that may happen to you. For instance, if a friend invites you
to take a quick trip to the mountains, you don’t think, “Hey, that’ll be
fun. I could use a break.” Instead, you may immediately start thinking
things like, “I’d better not leave. Someone could break into the house if
I’m not here and take my stuff. And if they take my computer, they could
get my personal data and rifle my bank account.”
Catastrophizing can send you into a tailspin by making each minor
puddle seem like a flood of misfortune or by making you afraid to have
new experiences and trapping you in fear. In therapy, you can discover
how to replace catastrophizing with positive thinking patterns that let
you experience and enjoy life again.
I take a look at some more negative thinking patterns — and how a therapist
can help you root them out — in “Step 3: Undoing false ideas,” later in this
chapter.
Setting sights on the goal: How CBT works
The goal of CBT is simple: to nip the negative thought cycle in the bud. It
does this by
1. Identifying the toxic thoughts your trauma caused
2. Challenging these false and self-defeating thoughts, replacing them with
thoughts that make sense, and turning your life in a positive direction
3. Spotting unproductive behaviors that stem from false thoughts and
replacing them with behaviors that further your goals
Here’s a good example of how this works:
Maxine, an avid nature lover, decides to take an early-morning hike. She
starts at 7 a.m. because she wants to avoid the summer heat. Halfway up the
mountain, she takes a little-used trail and falls, breaking her leg and cutting
herself badly on a branch as she tumbles into a ravine. Maxine lies on the
out-of-the-way path for two hours, terrified and in horrible pain, before
another hiker finds her and calls for help.
Maxine develops symptoms of PTSD after this frightening event. She also
develops a host of negative thoughts that alter her life, such as the following:
It’s not safe to be in the mountains or even outdoors.
I always make stupid decisions — just like when I went hiking alone.
136
Part III: Choosing the Right Treatment Approach 

I’m just staying home from now on because it’s safer.
If I try to have a good time, it’ll probably go wrong and I’ll wind up in trouble.
When Maxine’s symptoms finally become overwhelming and she seeks ther-
apy, her therapist helps her to identify these thoughts and replace them with
more realistic and positive thoughts like these:
Being outdoors isn’t perfectly safe, but the odds that something bad will
happen are actually very small. If I take precautions, such as hiking with a
friend and bringing a whistle or emergency flares along, I can make my
favorite outdoor activities even safer.
I make thousands of decisions, and the vast majority of them are very smart
and practical. Deciding to go on a hike alone early in the morning may not
have been the best decision I ever made, but nobody makes perfect deci-
sions all the time.
I could get hurt again if I go camping or hiking, but it’s more likely that I’ll
have a great time and be healthier because of the exercise and fresh air.
Staying shut up in the house won’t make me much safer, and in the long run,
it’ll keep me from enjoying my life.
I don’t need to focus on the bad things that could happen to me if I say yes to a
fun activity. Instead, I can look forward to the good things that could happen.
As a result of her insights, Maxine gradually gets back into her favorite out-
door activities. She attends a hiking-safety class to make sure she’s prepared
for emergencies and hooks up with some hiking buddies — both practical
responses to her traumatic experience. Maxine no longer feels terrified at the
thought of being in the great outdoors. In fact, she now plans on heading up a
hiking group for a local recreation center.
Figuring Out Whether CBT Is 
a Good Match for You
CBT is good medicine for PTSD. However, it’s not for everyone. First off, you
need to be very motivated, because CBT (as I mention earlier) is hard work.
In addition, your therapist will look for these signs that CBT is the right
approach for you:
 You’re not living in a dangerous situation (for instance, with an abusive
spouse).
 You’re not currently suicidal or very violent.
 You don’t have another psychiatric disorder than needs treatment first.
137
Chapter 8: Putting PTSD in Its Place with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)

 If you have a substance-abuse problem, it’s under enough control for
you to participate successfully in CBT (or your CBT takes your sub-
stance use issues into account — see the upcoming section titled
“Combined treatments for people with PTSD and substance abuse
issues”).
 Your health is good enough to allow you to cope with the temporary
stress that CBT can cause.
If you don’t meet all these criteria right now, your therapist may recommend
handling other problems first so you can clear the way for CBT to work suc-
cessfully — or he may suggest a different treatment approach.
138
Part III: Choosing the Right Treatment Approach 
The effectiveness of CBT
Overall, a CBT approach that includes directly
confronting your trauma is highly effective
according to studies. Here are some of the
latest findings:
 Paula Schnurr asked 277 female veterans
and 7 active-duty female personnel with
PTSD to undergo either ten weeks of pro-
longed-exposure therapy (a type of CBT
that involves mentally re-experiencing a
trauma and working through it) or a differ-
ent type of therapy that focused only on the
women’s current problems and avoided
exposing them to their traumas. She
reported in 2007 that women in the pro-
longed-exposure group were more than
twice as likely to achieve a complete remis-
sion after therapy — as well as more likely
to lose their PTSD diagnosis — as women
in the other group.
 The Cochrane Collaboration, a group that
reviews medical research to help profes-
sionals figure out what works and what
doesn’t, reported in 2005 that trauma-
focused CBT and stress management
(which is typically a part of CBT) reduced
PTSD more effectively than other standard
psychological therapies.
 In 2007, Barbara Rothbaum compared the
drug sertraline (Zoloft; see Chapter 9) alone
to a combination of sertraline and CBT. The
researchers found that patients who
responded to sertraline got even better
when they later underwent CBT, and those
on the drug alone didn’t continue to
improve.
The National Center for Posttraumatic Stress
Disorder notes that there are more published,
well-designed studies on CBT (more than 30)
than on any other PTSD treatment. And accord-
ing to these studies, CBT is a highly effective
treatment that produces marked reductions —
generally 60 to 80 percent — in PTSD symp-
toms. It’s especially effective in survivors of
rape. Vets with combat-related PTSD show
smaller benefits, but for this group as well, CBT
produces better and longer-lasting treatment
effects than other approaches.

When you look at the stats on CBT’s usefulness (see the nearby sidebar, “The
effectiveness of CBT”), remember that your mileage may vary. Different
people respond differently to treatments, and what works like a charm for
you may not work for the guy next door (and vice versa). That’s why Chapter
10 describes many other treatments that can help you tackle PTSD if CBT
isn’t your best road to healing.
If your therapist does use CBT to treat your PTSD, remember that you may
need other therapies as well. That’s especially true if you have issues with
alcohol or drugs or if you have complex PTSD (see Chapter 3).
The ABCs of CBT
CBT is a little like banana nut bread: It comes in different flavors, and every
practitioner has a slightly different recipe for success. Thus, ten different
therapists may go about CBT in ten slightly different ways, and therapists
often mix and match approaches. Also, your therapist may switch from one
approach to another, based on your responses. (For info on some relatives of
CBT, see “Variations on a Theme: Offshoots of CBT,” later in this chapter.)
However, just about every standard version of CBT follows a basic pattern,
and in this section, I outline the typical elements of the CBT approach.
Step 1: Gaining the tools you need to feel
safe in the moment
Right now, your trauma is like a painfully infected tooth: More than anything,
you want to prevent anyone from touching it. But to win your battle with
PTSD, you need to confront the problem and overcome it — because just like
that bad tooth, it’s not going away on its own.
Looking your trauma straight in the eye is a daunting prospect, so letting
down your guard and digging down to the roots of your symptoms is tough.
To take that big step, you need ironclad assurance that it’s safe. Therapy
works only if you can face your trauma, put the pieces of your experience
together, and come to a new understanding — and that requires strong pro-
tection from the overwhelming emotions your memories can release.
139
Chapter 8: Putting PTSD in Its Place with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)

A good therapist offers you that protection by giving you the tools to put the
brakes on when memories get too intense. With these tools always handy,
you can confront the worst of your memories and know that you’re safe and
secure at all times. Sometimes, these tools are sufficient treatments in and of
themselves (see Chapter 10), but more often, they’re a first step in therapy.
Typically, after giving you some basics about your PTSD and about CBT, your
therapist will begin your treatment by focusing on these techniques.
One of the tools you use may be stress inoculation training (SIT). In SIT, you
discover why certain situations cause stress, how stress affects you, and
ways you can cope when a stressful situation arises; then you practice a spe-
cific set of stress-reducing skills in your therapy session, with your therapist
helping by offering feedback. These skills vary depending on your needs, but
a few of the most common are

Part III: Choosing the Right Treatment Approach 
Getting on the same page: Permission to heal
Todd’s wife and two daughters counted on him,
so he knew he needed therapy when he devel-
oped PTSD after the trauma of losing his son
Jamie to an illness. But without consciously
realizing it, he viewed therapy and healing as a
form of betrayal — a way of forgetting his son.
His mixed feelings came up in the first session
with his therapist.
“Forgetting what happened to Jamie,” he told
his therapist, “makes it seem like he didn’t really
count. I don’t ever want to feel that way.”
The therapist reassured Todd that CBT doesn’t
make a person forget. Instead, it empowers an
individual who’s lost a loved one to compre-
hend, integrate, and deal with this loss in a pos-
itive way. That accomplishment, the therapist
explained, would allow Todd to honor Jamie’s
life and what it meant to his family instead of
remembering only his death.
When Todd realized that CBT could help him
deal with his memories positively — not block
them out of his life — he felt ready to tackle
therapy. He made remarkable progress, and one
year later, he sent his therapist an invitation to a
10K run — organized by Todd and named after
his son — to raise money to combat the illness
that took Jamie’s life.
Like Todd, you may have some big questions
about the goals of CBT. If so, don’t feel embar-
rassed; after all, you’re not a professional ther-
apist. That’s why talking openly with your
therapist at the very beginning of your relation-
ship is important. That way, you can get a feel
for what will and won’t happen over the course
of your therapy — and what realistic goals you
can have.

 Breathing techniques: Controlling your breathing can short-circuit a
stress response.
 Thought stopping: To train you in this skill, your therapist asks you to
think about a distressing topic and then forcefully says, “Stop!” and asks
you to immediately think about a pleasant topic — for instance, playing
with your dog or baking cookies with your kids. As you practice, you
gradually take over this “Stop!” response yourself so you can prevent
distressing thoughts from spiraling out of control.
 Positive self-talk: All day long, people talk to themselves. Much of this talk
is just random stuff such as, “Oops, I forgot to pick up the dry cleaning.”
But mixed in are some recurring themes, and the negative ones can cause
big trouble if you don’t root them out. People with PTSD, for instance, can
say mean things to themselves — things they’d never say to a friend or
loved one. (For instance, “I know I’m going to screw this up,” or “I’m going
to panic if I try this.”) Your therapist can help you spot some of these mes-
sages upfront and replace them with validating messages.
This practice is much like the cognitive restructuring you do later in
therapy (more on this in “Step 3: Undoing False Ideas,” in this chapter),
but practicing positive self-talk is more general and less specific to your
trauma.
 Muscle relaxation: You can use techniques to ease the tension that
builds up in your body in order to calm your mind.
 Biofeedback: You learn to spot your body’s signals of tension so you
can nip that tension in the bud. For example, as you watch a display of
your heartbeat increasing or decreasing, you can actually figure out how
to calm your racing heart.
You then practice these new skills in real life, and you and your therapist fine-
tune them so you know they’ll work when you call on them.
Your therapist also keeps you safe during therapy by deciding when you’re
ready to press ahead and when you need to take a breather. As an outside
observer, he’s capable of monitoring your emotions, behavior, and physical
responses and ensuring that you don’t push too hard or too soon.
Step 2: Confronting your trauma
To change the thoughts and behaviors that sprang from your trauma, you
need to face what happened and how it damaged you. CBT allows you to
safely confront your trauma in an environment where you’re totally in control.
141
Chapter 8: Putting PTSD in Its Place with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)

After you and your therapist know that you have the tools to face your fears
(see the preceding section), you’re ready to shed sunlight on the event that
changed your life so dramatically.
Understanding the necessity of this step
In most cases, a therapist starts this process of confrontation by explaining
why this face-to-face meeting with your foe is crucial. To give you a bit of a
preview, here’s why you must face your fears in order to be free of them:
 The initial event you experienced caused you to suffer terribly. Just
thinking about this event causes you distress.
 Other seemingly innocuous objects or events — such as a parking lot
where an assailant attacked you or the brand of shoes he was wearing —
can cause you to feel distress, too, because your mind now connects
them to the event.
 Avoiding memories and thoughts about the initial trauma or your trig-
gers makes you temporarily feel better. Thus, you’re rewarded (at least
in the short run) for escaping your negative feelings. (In doctor talk,
you’re reinforced for avoiding your issues.) In the long run, however, this
sets you up for far worse problems, because hidden wounds fester.
The best way to stop this downward spiral is to look your trauma — and the
triggers that are linked to it — right in the face. When you do this repeatedly,
a process called habituation occurs: The emotions attached to your memories
start to fade, causing you less pain or anger or fear each time.
To understand habituation, think about those flying monkeys in the Wizard of
Oz. The first time you saw them as a tyke, they probably scared the you-know-
what out of you. But each time you watched the movie, you responded a little
less — and eventually you could view the scene from a relaxed point of view
and think about things like, “How did they get all those monkeys to fly?” A
similar thing happens in exposure therapy, because each time you confront
your fears, you take more of the sting out of them.
A related word you may hear from your therapist is extinction. Remember
Pavlov’s dog from high school science class? Pavlov rang a bell every time he
fed the dog, and soon the dog started slobbering any time he heard the bell —
even if no food was in sight. The food was the main event. The bell, because it
became linked to the food, gained its own power. (The bell is called a condi-
tioned stimulus because salivating at the sound of a bell is a learned response,
not something that comes naturally.) But when Pavlov rang the bell time after
time without offering any food, the dog eventually caught on and stopped
drooling. That’s called extinction.
Now, you’re not a dog, and you don’t slobber. (At least I hope not!) But extinc-
tion is a key idea to understand if you have PTSD. That’s because your triggers,
like Pavlov’s bell, are conditioned stimuli. When you keep facing these triggers
142
Part III: Choosing the Right Treatment Approach 

and nothing terrible happens, your mind finally sits up and takes notice: “Hey,
this isn’t really connected to the terrible thing that happened to me.” When
that happens, you break the spell that your trigger has on you — you stop
responding to that bell — and you take a big step on the road to healing.
Renovating your mind at your own pace
Patients who hear the word extinction (the disappearance of a conditioned
response) sometimes joke, “I may become extinct if you make me do this.”
Behind that joke lurks a very real and very big fear: A person who lives
through a trauma feels, deep inside, that he couldn’t have survived it — and
that he can’t survive now if he confronts that trauma head-on. So you can
expect that your urge will be to run away rather than to stand your ground.
Take heart, though: Your therapist starts you on this journey only when
you’re clearly ready to face and conquer your fears.
When you start therapy, you may worry that tearing down the barriers that
hold in your emotions will cause your fears to flood in. But don’t fear: A good
therapist doesn’t take away those walls. Instead — like a landscaper suggest-
ing a picket fence instead of a barbed-wire fence — your therapist gives you
options and lets you choose your own path.
For example, if you avoid driving, your therapist isn’t going to say, “Bob! Get
off your fanny right now and get into that car — or else!” Instead, she’ll prob-
ably say something like this: “If you feel better not driving, using the bus is a
fine solution. But if you decide at any point that it’d make your life better to
be able to drive to work or to the store, here are some tools to help you feel
safe when you get in your car. Go ahead and practice them, and then you’ll be
able to use them if you decide that you want to try driving again. At that
point, we can take one step at a time and see how it goes.”
In short, you can keep using your old defenses, or you can explore the new
options your therapist offers without feeling like you have to commit to them —
sort of a lease-to-buy option. At every point, you’re the person in charge, so
don’t worry that your therapist will force you into a corner. She may encourage
you strongly to take scary steps, but she won’t push you past your limits. (If she
does, find another therapist.)
Be prepared, however, because your PTSD is going to get worse before it gets
better. To realize why, think of a splinter. Covering it with a bandage and pre-
tending it doesn’t exist is easier, but unless you pull it out, it’ll keep hurting
and possibly get infected. Removing the splinter hurts — sometimes a lot —
but in the long run, it’s the only way to heal. The same is true for tackling
PTSD, so be ready for tears, anger, grief, guilt, shame, and even physical symp-
toms such as shaky hands or a racing heart. These reactions are a good
thing, because they mean that you’re getting to the root of your problem. And
here’s the good news: As you face and conquer each fear, you’ll start to experi-
ence positive feelings of hope, relief, and joy. Most important of all, you’ll
experience the feeling of getting back in control of your life.
143
Chapter 8: Putting PTSD in Its Place with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)

Getting to work: Spotting your triggers
When you and your therapist decide that you’re completely ready, both of
you can get to work. Your therapist may start by asking you to list the situa-
tions that trigger your flashbacks or bad memories and to describe how severe
each one is. Therapists call this score subjective units of distress, or SUDs, and
they typically use a rating system of 1–10 or 1–100, with the highest end of
the spectrum being the most intense distress. Your therapist also asks you to
describe how you react to a trigger. Table 8-1 shows one patient’s list.

Part III: Choosing the Right Treatment Approach 

As you continue with your therapy, you may spot other triggers. If so, you
and your therapist add them to this list.
Thinking about your triggers is hard, and so is confronting them (see the next
section). When the going gets tough in therapy, patients often find themselves
coming up with excuses to miss sessions. If this happens to you — and it’s a
good bet that it will — understand that it’s very natural and normal. After all,
it’s human nature to stop doing what’s unpleasant to you. So don’t kick your-
self. Instead, just do your best to remember the long-term gains you seek, and
get back in the groove as quickly as possible. And don’t worry about your
therapist’s thinking you’re a failure if you ditch a session or two. She knows
it’s often a normal part of the process.
Facing your dragon by your therapist’s side
When you’re ready, the next step after identifying your triggers is for you and
your therapist to take on your trauma together. Earlier, you described your
experience to your therapist in a conversational way, probably touching only
briefly on the most disturbing parts of it. Now, however, is the time to shed
light on every dark corner of that experience. (This process is called expo-
sure therapy.) Therapists approach this step in a variety of ways. Some ask
patients to write about their trauma first and then talk it through. Others
jump right into the talk-it-out stage. Most therapists tape-record exposure
therapy sessions so patients can use the tapes in their homework.
When you write or talk about your trauma, your therapist asks you to
describe it as if you’re actually in the middle of it. For instance, a patient who
survived a fire doesn’t say, “Then I ran away” — she says, “I’m running now,
and I can feel my heart pounding. It’s very hot, and I hear fire trucks in the
background.” Your therapist asks you to describe the sights, sounds, odors,
and sensations you recall. Even more importantly, she asks you to zero in on
how you felt as the trauma unfolded.
Confronting your horror in this way is scary, but your therapist’s job is to make
sure you’re safe. She keeps an eagle eye on your emotions and makes sure you
stay in control as you face this big task together. For instance, she may stop
you and ask, “How distressed do you feel right now, on a scale of one to ten?”
Or she may remind you to practice stress-relieving skills (see “Step 1: Gaining
the Tools You Need to Feel Safe in the Moment,” earlier in this chapter).
Here are two major techniques for tackling a trauma; therapists typically
base their choice on each patient’s needs and resilience:
 Systematic desensitization (graduated exposure therapy): You confront
your least-disturbing triggers first and work your way up to your worst
memories. For instance, the patient who listed her triggers back in Table
8-1 may start by listening to rap music (a minor trigger) and then — when
she can handle that without distress — move on to a more stressful trigger,
such as her husband’s whiskers. Eventually, she’ll be ready to confront the
initial traumatic event itself.
145
Chapter 8: Putting PTSD in Its Place with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)

 Flooding (prolonged exposure or implosion): You confront the trauma
as a whole, creating as vivid an image of the event as possible. You
repeat this process until the powerful emotions linked to the trauma
begin to fade. In the process, you gain insight into both your original
trauma and the triggers that stem from it.
In some cases, you can confront elements of your trauma directly. For
instance, your therapist may ask you to go to a park or restaurant where an
attack occurred. If recreating your experience in real life is unsafe or impossi-
ble, the therapist asks you to imagine it. Some high-tech therapists are also
using computer simulations to create virtual versions of combat or other
traumas (see “Virtual reality exposure therapy [VRET],” later in this chapter).
Step 3: Undoing false ideas
Exposure therapy (which I discuss in the preceding section) isn’t just about
facing your trauma. More importantly, it’s about seeing that trauma and its
aftermath from a brand-new angle — an approach called cognitive restructur-
ing. As you confront your trauma, your therapist can help you spot the false
beliefs and thoughts that strengthen the trauma’s hold on you and that keep
you from breaking free. As you challenge each self-defeating thought, you can
replace it with new, positive thoughts and beliefs. The result of this process
is a paradigm shift, which means that you view aspects of your life through
totally new eyes — and as a result, you think and act differently from that
point on.
When I talk to groups, I like to explain a paradigm shift like this. I hold up a
Federal Express package box, point to the logo that says FedEx, and ask
people if they see the white arrow between the E and the x. Most people
squint their eyes as if to say, “How did I never notice that?!” And when I ask
them whether they’ll notice the arrow every time they see the FedEx logo
from that point on, they all nod. Furthermore, they all laugh and say yes when
I ask them, “If you’re stopped in traffic and a FedEx truck stops in front of
you, will you point out the arrow to the other people in the car?”
Because the people in the audience see something they didn’t see before,
they’ll never look at the logo in the same way. Similarly — but far more
importantly — when you break through the negative thoughts that keep you
from seeing your trauma (and yourself) clearly, you’ll view your crisis, your
reaction to it, your current life, and your own value as a human being in a
very different and more positive light.
Here are three examples of how cognitive restructuring works.
146
Part III: Choosing the Right Treatment Approach 

Combating concerns about safety (and the underlying need for control)
Before your trauma, you probably felt secure most of the time. You took some
precautions — maybe you bought a car with good safety features, installed a
deadbolt on your front door, or carried pepper spray with you — but in gen-
eral, you didn’t spend lots of time feeling fearful. What’s more, you felt a
sense of control over your life. You knew that bad stuff could happen, but you
figured that bad stuff was the exception, not the rule.

Chapter 8: Putting PTSD in Its Place with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
Moving ahead by looking back
At age 27, Carol was raped at knifepoint in a
large indoor shopping center’s parking lot after
the stores had closed. She froze at the time,
thinking she was going to die, and her screams
stuck in her throat.
After the attack, Carol continued work for a few
months. She functioned well on the surface, but
underneath she was in a daze. After six months,
she started having panic attacks. She moved
back to live with her parents in another city,
started to withdraw from friends, and spent an
increasing amount of time in the bedroom she’d
grown up in.
Nine months after the attack, the rapist was
captured and was then tried and sent to prison.
Carol felt some relief, but she was still trapped
by her need to avoid a world she now saw as
dangerous. Her parents sympathized with her
avoidance before her attacker was captured
but now urged her go to therapy and try to put
the attack behind her.
In therapy sessions, Carol was afraid to talk
about the rape in detail. Every time she started,
she felt nauseated and lightheaded and said, “I
can’t do this.”
I explained to Carol that at the time of the attack,
she froze in order to survive. Because she was
still trapped in that frozen state, she hadn’t had
an opportunity to finish experiencing all the
other feelings associated with the attack. Until
she returned to that moment in the safe setting
of therapy and gradually relived and re-experi-
enced her trauma, she would probably continue
to feel like half a person, living in limbo — afraid
to look back and afraid to move forward.
After several sessions, when she had a good
rapport with me, I gently but firmly encouraged
her to describe the trauma in such specific
detail that I could see it through her eyes. At the
very moment when I did see it through her eyes
— which gave me the chills — she started to
have trouble breathing. In her mind, she was in
the past, experiencing a horrific event that she
never thought she could survive again.
I continued to have her describe the details,
telling her that it was almost a year later and
that she was not falling apart or going crazy.
Instead, I reminded her, she was finishing feel-
ing all the emotions she didn’t have time to feel
during and shortly after the trauma because she
was just trying to survive and keep from falling
apart.
As Carol continued to talk, the tension in her
voice began to dissolve and she started to relax.
That terrible time she’d spent trapped alone
with her rapist had pushed her into a state of
frozen terror; now, by reliving the trauma with a
supportive and caring person, she could let that
terror dissipate and begin to feel and trust
again.

After a trauma, those beliefs are turned topsy-turvy. It seems like the uni-
verse is out to get you, and you’re a helpless pawn in its game. As a result,
you may develop negative thoughts like these:
I’ll never be safe again.
The world is frightening and unpredictable.
I can’t take chances, or bad things will happen.
I have to keep everything under control, or else I’ll get hurt.
These thoughts can translate into a fear of taking risks. For instance, you may
be afraid to make new friends, change jobs, or even leave the house. They
can also lead you to take extreme (and ultimately unsuccessful) measures to
regain a sense of control your life. As you identify these thoughts with the
help of your therapist and replace them with constructive thoughts, you find
that many of your fears fall away and that you can take real steps to take con-
trol over your future.
Shedding mistrust and an impenetrable shell
People say that misery loves company, but individuals battling PTSD often
lock everyone else out of their lives instead of sharing their pain. This leave-
me-alone response can be especially powerful if a trauma involves being hurt
by another person (as with a sexual assault) or involves witnessing the death

Danielle’s story: Spotless equals safe
Danielle spent hours each day scrubbing every
surface of her home, cooking gourmet meals,
and manicuring the lawn. By the time her hus-
band, Larry, got home, she’d be exhausted and
on the edge of a breakdown. Larry was a
mellow guy who didn’t mind clutter and thought
simple food was fine, but he couldn’t get her to
relax. He was very supportive, but both of them
were tense and upset about the situation.
As Danielle worked through the abuse she suf-
fered at the hands of a violent stepfather, she
realized the basis for her actions. Her stepdad
used to hit her any time she failed to keep the
house spotless, and she now believed she
needed to have everything perfect in order to be
safe. If anything was out of place, she thought,
she could get hurt or even die.
With the help of her therapist, she challenged
that idea and replaced it with true and con-
structive thoughts: “The person who hurt me
was impossible to please. I’m safe now because
Larry isn’t that person. Larry is a good person,
and he doesn’t expect me to be perfect. I can
relax and have fun.” As a result, she was able
to lighten up and enjoy her life and her relation-
ship with Larry.

of another person (making the survivor reluctant to get close to another
human being and risk being hurt by a similar loss in the future). Often, PTSD
packs negative thoughts such as these:
I can’t trust anyone.
Bad things happen to people when I’m around. They’re better off without me
in their lives.
People always let me down.
If I get involved with someone, I’ll just get hurt.
These thoughts and similar ones close you off from a world of love and
friendship and leave you angry, lonely, and bitter. In addition, they wound
other people and often split up once-loving families. As you overcome this
type of negative thinking, you’ll find a new joy in friendship, family ties, and
romantic relationships.
Getting rid of gut-wrenching guilt
Guilt is one of the biggest stumbling blocks on the road to healing because it
plants the toxic thought “I don’t deserve to recover.” To give this idea the
boot, you and your therapist need to tackle its root causes. Many people with
PTSD have to work through five false beliefs that give guilt an iron grip:
 “I should’ve predicted the trauma and avoided it.” If you fall prey to
this erroneous thought, called hindsight bias, it means you expect the
impossible of yourself — because no one can predict the future. Your
therapist can help you understand that life is full of risks, and avoiding
all of them is impossible.
 “I didn’t have a good reason for the actions I took before or during the
trauma.” This faulty type of thinking, called justification distortion, makes
you think that perfectly normal actions — such as driving your child to
camp or deciding to visit the World Trade Towers as a tourist — were
wrong on your part, based on traumatic events that happened afterward.
Your therapist can help you understand that it’s unfair to judge your actions
by their unanticipated outcomes rather than your original intentions.
 “It’s all my fault.” This form of distorted thinking, called responsibility
distortion, makes you take total blame for an act in which you played
either no role or merely a partial one. Here’s an example: You ask your
child to climb a ladder to get a ball out of a tree, and the ladder, which
turns out to be defective, collapses, causing him serious injury. If you
blame yourself for this catastrophe, you’re exhibiting responsibility dis-
tortion because you’re failing to recognize that the ladder manufac-
turer’s error — not your action — is the root cause of the problem. In
therapy, you can figure out how to rid yourself of the misplaced guilt
you feel as a result of this type of self-destructive thought.
149
Chapter 8: Putting PTSD in Its Place with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)

 “I did something evil.” This type of misguided thinking is called wrong-
doing distortion, and it may be the most devastating of all guilt-producing
thoughts because it makes you doubt your own goodness as a human
being. For instance, if you hurt or killed someone during your trauma,
you may feel like a bad person who doesn’t deserve to get well. If that’s
the case, your therapist helps you realize that you’re just human — and
that no human can always behave perfectly and nobly and heroically at
all times or know exactly the right thing to do in any situation. She also
helps you see that you probably acted exactly like most people would in
your situation.
For instance, if a soldier feels guilt over the emotional rush he felt when
he killed an enemy, a therapist may point out, “You were very young and
very scared. When people on the other side started firing at you, your
body reacted by producing lots of chemicals that triggered your fight-or-
flight response, and that’s what made you feel such a rush. It didn’t
happen because you’re a bad person. It happened because that’s how the
human body reacts when it faces and survives a threat. Millions of other
soldiers have the same feelings, and they aren’t bad people, either.”

Part III: Choosing the Right Treatment Approach 
David’s story: Mad as hell
David and his friend Nick fought side by side for
months in Vietnam. One day, walking through a
friendly village, they spotted a little girl waving
at them from a hut. Distracted by her smile,
David raised a hand to wave in return before he
spotted the grenade she’d tossed in his direc-
tion. He dived in one direction, and Nick dived
in the other. David survived with serious
wounds, but Nick died.
Decades later, David refused to talk with his
wife about the war. He’d alienated his grown
children, and his wife walked on eggshells to
keep him from blowing up. When a therapist
helped him face that day in Vietnam, David real-
ized that he came away from his terrible experi-
ence with several self-destructive thoughts.
One was that anybody could be an enemy.
Another was “I can never let down my guard.”
And still another — stemming from the idea that
he caused Nick’s death by letting the little girl’s
smile distract him for an instant — was “Even
little mistakes are unacceptable.”
These ideas made perfect sense in Vietnam,
where hair-trigger reactions and constant suspi-
cion saved lives. What’s more, the lack of a hero’s
welcome when he returned to the States — and
the red tape of the government, which demanded
that every i be dotted and every t be crossed
before David could get any help for his PTSD —
strongly reinforced them. But now, he realizes,
these ideas are self-destructive. With help from
his therapist, he creates new ideas. One is “My
family members aren’t enemies. Even when
they’re angry or disagree with me, they love me
and want the best for me.” Another is “I can relax
and nothing bad will happen.” And the third is
“Most little mistakes are harmless, and some are
funny.” These new realizations help David to rein
in his temper, control his knee-jerk reactions to
every little household crisis, and start rebuilding
bonds with his family.

 “I shouldn’t have survived.” Another type of guilt that occurs after a
trauma is called survivor guilt, a feeling that happens when you feel
guilty that you lived through a trauma while another person died. Your
therapist can help you get past this misguided guilt in many ways. One
is by helping you see that your survival is an achievement, not a reason
for shame. Another is by helping you find ways to honor the person who
died in the trauma.
Step 4: Putting your new skills into action
The relief you feel when you make a breakthrough in therapy is wonderful,
but it’s even better when you translate your new skills into real-life suc-
cesses. As you make progress, you and your therapist talk about ways to put
your new awareness into action. For example,
 If your trauma involved a car accident and you feel ready to face driving
again, your therapist may ask you to get used to sitting in your car, then
driving it a few feet, and finally driving it around the block. Eventually, he
may give you the homework assignment of driving to the store and back.
 If your new skills help you to connect better with family and friends,
your therapist may ask you to call a longtime friend and schedule a get-
together.
 If you’re getting anger issues under grips, your therapist may ask you to
test your new anger-management skills by handling a longstanding prob-
lem with a co-worker in a positive way.
At each session, you and your therapist talk about how well your real-life
exercises went and what you need to work on next. Don’t be too surprised if
you take two steps forward and one step back when you test-drive your new
skills in the real world; overcoming bad habits takes patience and practice.
You and your therapist can also talk over ways to tackle any major problems
in your life, such as job or housing worries. He can probably show you how
the lessons you develop in therapy can help you address these issues in new
and more-effective ways.
Variations on a Theme: Offshoots of CBT
You have your own way of doing things, and so does your therapist — and
that’s why no two CBT sessions are exactly alike. Most therapists who use CBT
follow the steps I outline throughout this chapter. Within that framework, how-
ever, therapists tailor their approaches to best suit their patients — especially
when it comes to the crucial step of confronting your trauma.
151
Chapter 8: Putting PTSD in Its Place with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)

CBT comes in too many different varieties to list, with new methods springing
up every year. In this section, I give you a quick sampling of different
approaches to give you an idea of how CBT therapists can offer different
strokes for different folks.
If your insurance plan is flexible and you live in a big city that’s teeming with
therapists, you may want to seek an approach that suits your particular
needs — especially if you’d like your therapy to address both PTSD and
either substance use issues or other psychiatric disorders.

Part III: Choosing the Right Treatment Approach 
Steve’s story: Unraveling guilt and 
accepting human limits
Steve felt crushing guilt when he thought about
the accident that occurred when his car
swerved out of control and killed a bicyclist on
a busy street. His inner thoughts were, “It was
wrong for me to drive in a rainstorm. I should’ve
known better and stayed home. I killed another
person just because I didn’t want to miss work,
and I don’t deserve to be happy after taking
someone else’s life.”
As Steve and his therapist worked through his
trauma, Steve discovered how to challenge
these thoughts:
 In response to Steve’s belief that he
should’ve avoided the accident, the thera-
pist noted that Steve couldn’t have known
that the accident was going to occur —
especially because he’d driven in the rain
for years without a problem. Also, Steve
couldn’t have predicted that his tires were
going to slip on a slick spot.
 When Steve discussed the guilt he felt for
driving in a heavy rain, his therapist pointed
out that thousands of people drove to work
in the same storm that day — and that the
world would come to a standstill if everyone
feared driving in the rain.
 As for Steve’s tendency to blame himself for
the accident, the therapist helped Steve
realize that thinking that the accident hap-
pened solely because of him was unrealis-
tic. The therapist noted that the bicyclist
chose to ride in the rain and dressed in dark
clothes, making him almost impossible to see
until it was too late. Also, a work crew left a
slick of oil on the spot where Steve’s car
skidded. In short, the therapist noted, lots of
events came together to cause the accident.
 In response to Steve’s belief that he com-
mitted an evil act when his car killed the
bicyclist, his therapist helped him realize
that a) he had no intent of causing any harm
on the day of the accident; b) he made the
best split-second decision he could when
he swerved to miss another car; and c) he
did everything possible to help at the scene
of the accident. All of these, the therapist
notes, are the actions of a good person
trying to make sense of a bad situation.
By the end of therapy, Steve understood that his
accident was just that: a tragic accident that
could happen to anyone. Putting his guilt behind
him lifted a terrible burden and allowed him to
move forward with his life instead of sabotaging
his future.

Don’t get too hung up on any one flavor of CBT, however. For all their differ-
ences, these approaches offer one important message: Facing your problems
is the first step in conquering them. And that simple message — rather than
the bells and whistles — is what empowers CBT to open the door to healing
for so many people.
Tracking motion: Eye movement desensiti-
zation and reprocessing therapy
A relative newcomer on the scene, eye movement desensitization and repro-
cessing (EMDR) therapy combines many steps of traditional cognitive behav-
ioral therapy (CBT — see the earlier sections) with a unique system of eye
movements. Like CBT, EMDR asks a patient to confront and work through her
original trauma. EMDR therapists also help patients replace self-destructive
ideas with beneficial ones. The big difference lies in the eye movements (or
other left-right cues) used in EMDR. It’s an increasingly popular technique for
treating PTSD and one that’s supported by many studies. Here’s the scoop on
what happens in EMDR.
An EMDR therapist starts with the same steps as in CBT. First, you and the
therapist zero in on your issues, and you also work on some relaxation and
stress-relieving techniques. Next, therapy follows these steps (which may
vary depending on your therapist’s specific technique):
1. Your therapist asks you to identify a particular memory associated
with your trauma, and she asks you to judge how severely the
memory distresses you (usually on a scale of 1 to 10 or 1 to 100).
2. The therapist also asks you to identify negative beliefs related to this
event.
Negative beliefs may include thoughts such as, “I’m weak,” or “I can’t
cope.” Typically, you also rate your level of distress as a result of this
belief.
3. The therapist asks you to identify positive beliefs that you’d like to
replace the negative beliefs with.
For example, you may want to believe, “I’m very strong,” or “I’m able to
handle stressful experiences.” As before, she asks you to rate how
strongly you believe these ideas.
4. Your therapist asks you to identify a “safe place” you can mentally
return to at the end of the session.
For instance, you may want to visualize a beautiful, deserted beach.

Part III: Choosing the Right Treatment Approach 
Gaining the strength to face the past and the future
In an article in Behavior Therapy, Katherine
DuHamel and her colleagues describe how CBT
helped a 40-year-old cancer patient recover
from PTSD following a bone marrow transplant.
Before therapy, the patient reacted with
extreme distress to reminders of his cancer
treatment. For example, the sound of his
microwave oven or the generator at his work-
place triggered flashbacks because these
noises reminded him of the sounds of the radi-
ation machine used in his treatment. The scent
of pine — the same scent as the skin lotion his
hospital unit used — affected him so strongly
that his family couldn’t have a Christmas tree in
the house. Even a certain shade of yellow,
which reminded him of the color of the antifun-
gal medicine he received during his treatment,
triggered strong emotions.
The patient volunteered enthusiastically for
CBT, telling his doctors that he feared he was
“going crazy.” He underwent ten 1-hour ses-
sions of treatment, including both standard CBT
techniques and education specific to living with
cancer:
 In Session 1, the therapist discussed the
patient’s symptoms with him and explained
the steps of his therapy.
 In Session 2, the therapist described how a
cancer diagnosis and treatment can lead to
PTSD symptoms. The therapist also dis-
cussed the importance of ongoing cancer
monitoring and treatment, explaining that
this follow-up care made PTSD triggers
unavoidable. The therapist and the patient
worked on developing positive coping
strategies — for instance, using positive
self-statements such as “separate the past
and the present.” The patient also practiced
relaxation techniques (see “Step 1: Gaining
the Tools You Need to Feel Safe in the
Moment”), using a visualization exercise,
self-suggestions, and a relaxation tape.
 In Session 3, the patient practiced his relax-
ation exercises. Then the patient and his
therapist created a list of his triggers, orga-
nizing them from least to most distressing.
 In Sessions 4 through 8, the patient prac-
ticed his relaxation techniques and then
underwent systematic desensitization (see
the section titled “Facing your dragon by
your therapist’s side”), confronting each of
his triggers. These triggers ranged from the
mildly distressing sight and smell of veg-
etable soup (which a relative brought to him
in the hospital) to the highly upsetting words
cancer and leukemia. Afterward, he and his
therapist talked about ways to help prevent
a PTSD relapse.
 In the final two sessions, the patient did
additional work on confronting his triggers
and reviewed his strategies for relaxing and
coping when triggers arose. For example,
he created a portable “toolbox” containing
his relaxation tape, an index card on which
he wrote coping statements, and directions
for a relaxation exercise.
The man’s therapy caused remarkable changes
in his life. Afterward, he no longer met criteria
for PTSD, he recovered from his depression,
and most of his triggers no longer affected him.
(Initially, 11 triggers caused him extreme dis-
tress. By the end of therapy, 10 of these caused
little or no distress, and the 11th caused only
moderate upset.) He stopped having flashbacks
on the job, avoided a relapse even when he
needed re-hospitalization, and told his doctors
he felt peaceful, happy, and calm.

5. You silently remember your trauma while watching the therapist’s
finger or pen as it moves back and forth from left to right repeatedly
(see Figure 8-1).
Sometimes a therapist uses right and left finger taps on a patient’s knee
or musical tones that change from left to right. (Note: The tapping used
in EMDR is different from the tapping therapies I outline in Chapter 10
because EMDR tapping has nothing to do with the energy points that
tapping therapists believe are the key to their therapy.) As you begin
this process, your therapist may instruct you to let whatever happens
happen and to simply notice the thoughts and feelings that arise.
6. You repeat this procedure several times.
In between, your therapist asks you to discuss feelings that arise or rate
your level of distress. Your therapist largely stays in the background and
lets you do the talking because EMDR is based on the theory that the
eye movements themselves — rather than the therapist’s verbal guid-
ance — are the key to helping your traumatic memories become unstuck
so you can process them in a healthy way. The session continues until
you report that your level of distress is very low and that your belief in
the positive idea you identified is very high. At this point, your therapist
asks you to visualize your “safe place” and concludes the process.
Interestingly, studies so far can’t prove whether the addition of the eye move-
ments makes any difference; some say yes, and others say no.

Another point of controversy centers on a different question: Is EMDR simply
a dressed-up version of CBT? Some researchers say it is. Others say that
EMDR differs greatly because instead of requiring intense, prolonged expo-
sure to your trauma — a centerpiece of CBT — EMDR exposes you only
briefly during each treatment.
What is clear is that EMDR has a good track record — fairly similar to CBT,
albeit shorter. A 2006 review of studies comparing the two techniques, published

Part III: Choosing the Right Treatment Approach 
The case of the jealous husband
In the British Journal of Nursing, psychothera-
pist David Blore describes a remarkable case
that illustrates the power of EMDR — as well as
the fact that it’s never too late to seek help for
PTSD symptoms.
Blore’s patient was Maurice, a 75-year-old
World War II veteran and a survivor of a
Japanese prison camp. An easygoing guy
before the war, Maurice came home bitter and
angry. Even worse, he became morbidly jealous
and was convinced that his wife would cheat on
him. He refused to let her have visitors when he
was gone or to pay attention to other men —
even close relatives.
Maurice’s first wife suffered under these rules
for decades. He remarried after she died, and
his new wife (a woman made of sterner stuff)
said, “Get help, or we’re getting a divorce.” So
half a century after his trauma, Maurice sought
therapy.
Dr. Blore addressed his patient’s problems in
three sessions of EMDR. In the first session, the
man talked about his fear and anger after his
capture and described terrible memories of the
guards’ making him drag bodies from the water
and bury them. Blore notes, “Session 1 was har-
rowing for Maurice and therapist alike, but a
real sense of purpose ensued and the almost
immediate relief gained by Maurice after more
than 50 years can scarcely be adequately
described.”
In Session 2, the reasons for Maurice’s jealousy
came to light. He talked about how the camp
guards lined their prisoners up each day and
tormented them by saying, “While you are here,
your women will be enjoying themselves with
other men.” Maurice remembered how his jeal-
ousy grew over time as the guards’ verbal
arrows hit their mark. As he relived this memory
during EMDR, he realized that he’d been brain-
washed and said, “It’s so obvious — it’s almost
as though the war is continuing in my head.”
In Session 3, Maurice reported great news: For
the first time since the 1930s, he’d entertained a
male guest at his home and didn’t have a single
jealous thought when he saw the man talking
with his wife. In this session, he and Dr. Blore
handled his remaining issues by exploring his
life after the war, his relationship with his wife,
and his new perceptions about the effects of his
jealousy.
Dr. Blore saw his patient two more times over
the next six months. At each, Maurice was
relaxed and happy. At Maurice’s last visit, Blore
says, “He parted by sincerely thanking me for
saving his marriage.”

in Psychological Medicine, concluded that both treatments were effective and
that “the superiority of one treatment over the other could not be demon-
strated.” So EMDR looks like a good bet — even though researchers don’t
really know why it works.
Intense but short-lived recollection: 
The counting method
Patients looking for a rapid CBT intervention that offers some privacy often
find the counting method (devised by Frank Ochberg) helpful. Here’s how you
confront your trauma if your therapist uses this method:
1. Your therapist begins by asking which traumatic memory you want to
recall that day.
2. The therapist asks you to recall this memory silently while he slowly
counts aloud from 1 to 100 (about one second per count).
The idea is for you to fill the entire 100 seconds with your memory, let-
ting it peak in intensity and then returning to the present in the last few
seconds.
3. Afterward, you and your therapist discuss what you recalled.
For instance, if he noticed you tensing at one point, he may ask, “Do you
recall what happened when I was counting in the 50s?” Together, you
explore your recalling of the trauma and what you learned by revisiting it.
Counting often works quickly, and Dr. Ochberg reports that about 80 percent
of his patients report improvement in symptoms after treatment. The count-
ing technique has three strong advantages:
 It offers some privacy to a person who may not want to share the full
force of a memory out loud.
 It keeps the person linked to the present through the sound of the thera-
pist’s voice.
 It puts the memory in a box defined by the counting time, making it
seem less powerful.
The counting method is somewhat similar to eye movement desensitization
and reprocessing (EMDR), which I discuss in the preceding section, because
you tackle small bits of your trauma at a time.
157
Chapter 8: Putting PTSD in Its Place with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)

Focusing on the present: Rational emotive
behavior therapy (REBT)
Is confronting your trauma really a necessary part of triumphing over PTSD?
Maybe not, according to rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT).
Instead of focusing largely on your past trauma, REBT looks at your life right
now. REBT therapists do believe that your past influences your present, but
they also believe that you can address your beliefs — no matter when and
why they arose — by looking at how they impact your current life and behav-
ior, without taking too deep of a look at the past. As the Albert Ellis Institute
(named for the therapy’s creator) explains it, “REBT believes that the ‘nutti-
ness’ of our past exerts its influence in our current-day thinking patterns and
beliefs. Although we cannot change the past, we can change how we let the
past influence the way we are today and the way we want to be tomorrow.”
REBT therapists focus on what they call the ABCs of your current life prob-
lems. The letters stand for
 A: Activating Events
 B: Beliefs
 C: Consequences (emotional and behavioral)
According to REBT, A — in this case, the trauma you experienced — doesn’t
directly cause C — your PTSD symptoms — unless irrational beliefs (B) enter
the mix. So an REBT therapist asks what you think is making you sad or angry
or anxious, but she considers that event to be less important than your cur-
rent beliefs about it. The therapist’s goals are to
 Help you identify false beliefs that are affecting your life in a negative way.
 Help dispute these beliefs by showing why they’re false and how they
influence you to take actions that aren’t in your best interest.
Here’s a brief example of how the dialogue may go in an REBT session:
Diana: I’m just angry all the time.
Therapist: Why are you angry?
Diana: I’m angry at the man who attacked me. And I’m angry that I had a
wonderful life, and he ruined it.
Therapist: He ruined everything wonderful in your life? There’s nothing
wonderful at all left?
158
Part III: Choosing the Right Treatment Approach 

Diana: Well, that’s not true. My family’s really supportive. They’re always
there for me.
Therapist: You mentioned that you raise horses, and that your horses are
very important to you. Did your attacker ruin that part of your life?
Diana: Well, no, of course not. I mean, the attack didn’t have anything to
do with the horses. So okay, I see where you’re going — not everything is
ruined. . . .
In general, an REBT therapist focuses on getting you to challenge beliefs that
are rigid and inflexible, illogical, inconsistent with reality, and holding you
back from accomplishing your goals. For instance, if you say, “I need to get
back into college right away, or I’m a complete failure,” or “I can’t face driving
ever again,” an REBT therapist may say something like, “What evidence is
there that you’ll be a complete failure if you don’t go back to school this
semester?” or “What would happen if you did drive your car again?”
Notice that the therapist isn’t zeroing in on past events that contributed to
these beliefs (although you and he may talk about them). Instead, he’s focus-
ing on what you believe here and now, and he’s encouraging you to analyze
those beliefs to see whether they’re working for or against you.
REBT is a lot like CBT, which also helps a person challenge self-defeating
ideas. The advantage of REBT, from some people’s point of view, is that it
doesn’t force you to go through the emotional experience of confronting your
trauma. The downside? Researchers aren’t sure, but evidence suggests that
many people need to face down their trauma to get past its effects.
Attacking panic: Multiple 
channel exposure therapy
Panic disorder (see Chapter 3) and PTSD often go hand-in-hand. One study,
for instance, showed that people with panic disorder are more than four
times more likely to have a current diagnosis of PTSD than people with no
history of panic disorder. Some people with panic disorder are so terrified of
experiencing a panic attack when they undergo exposure therapy that they
can’t face CBT.
These facts led Dr. Sherry Falsetti and her colleagues to develop a special
form of CBT that addresses both panic disorder and PTSD symptoms.
Falsetti’s therapy — called multiple channel exposure therapy — starts by edu-
cating patients about panic disorder symptoms, teaching them breathing
159
Chapter 8: Putting PTSD in Its Place with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)

techniques that can stop panic attacks, and having them confront and over-
come their panic disorder symptoms through a variety of techniques. For
instance, patients may
 Breathe through a straw to simulate panicky breathing
 Spin in a chair to mimic the dizziness and disorientation caused by a
panic attack
 Tense their muscles to simulate the stress of a panic attack
When patients figure out how to cope with panic symptoms and no longer
dread them, they find exposure to their initial trauma much less scary to
face. Early data give the method a thumbs-up: Falsetti evaluated 12 patients
using her approach, and found that only about 8 percent still met diagnostic
criteria for PTSD after treatment (compared to more than 66 percent in a con-
trol group) and that patients undergoing the therapy suffered far fewer panic
attacks than the controls.
Confronting your trauma, high-tech:
Virtual reality exposure therapy 
(VRET)
Consider the following scenarios:
A soldier driving down a dangerous road sees the truck ahead of him
explode.
A rescue worker runs away from the collapsing World Trade Center towers.
A driver sees another car jump the center divider and head straight for her.
What do all three of these scenarios have in common? For patients undergo-
ing one kind of therapy, they’re happening on a computer screen — not in
real life. In all three cases, the patients witnessing these events are safe and
sound in their therapists’ offices. They’re participating in a revolutionary new
form of exposure therapy that uses virtual reality to recreate traumas.
In virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET), patients sit at a computer or wear
a headset that lets them see and hear a computer-generated virtual world
resembling the scene of their trauma. The military’s test program actually
adds some sensory cues that the therapist can trigger at appropriate times,
including odors (gunpowder, spices, sweat) and vibrations that simulate
being in a tank or Humvee. Some programs also allow the therapist to change
the scene — for instance, by triggering gunfire sounds or smoke clouds to
match a patient’s description of what happened. This form of therapy is a lot
like a video game, but this game has a very serious goal: to help participants
face and conquer their fears.
160
Part III: Choosing the Right Treatment Approach 

VRET follows the same principles of typical CBT, but it adds a layer of realism
because patients actually experience elements of the trauma in real life instead
of just visualizing these details in their minds. Reliving a trauma in a virtual
world can also help patients whose defenses make it hard for them to describe
a trauma verbally (for instance, soldiers or police officers, who sometimes
find it hard to drop their tough façade and talk openly about their pain).
Virtual reality is especially helpful when patients can’t physically revisit the
location where a trauma occurred because it’s too dangerous or far away.
These technologies are so new they’re barely out of the box, but two studies
indicate that they can be very powerful. Here are some early results:
 Six people suffering from PTSD after car accidents completed ten ses-
sions of VRET. Afterward, they experienced marked reductions in intru-
sive thoughts, avoidance, and numbing.
 Nine people who developed PTSD after the World Trade Center collapse
underwent 14 sessions of VRET. After therapy, they had a much bigger
drop in symptom severity than a control group that didn’t receive the
treatment.
Undergoing combined treatments if 
you struggle with substance abuse
If an alcohol problem or drug use complicates your PTSD, treatment can be
tricky. Traditionally, therapists ask patients to get clean before they start CBT —
but a new trend is to combine treatment for both problems into one package.
For example, check out the following techniques:
 Seeking Safety: This technique uses present-based CBT, which doesn’t
involve re-experiencing a trauma but instead focuses on a person’s cur-
rent problems, to address both PTSD and alcohol or drug abuse (see the
section on REBT for another example of present-based CBT). In some
cases, the approach is combined with exposure therapy that does
involve re-experiencing the trauma.
The developer of Seeking Safety, Lisa Najavits, says, “Contrary to older
views, treating both PTSD and substance abuse at the same time
appears to help clients with their substance abuse recovery, rather than
derailing them from attaining abstinence.” Seeking Safety puts a slightly
different spin on CBT because much of its focus is on safety (the reason
for its name) — not just safety from substance abuse or PTSD symptoms
but also from the dangerous relationships and suicidal or self-harming
behaviors that are common in people battling both PTSD and substance
abuse. Another feature is its emphasis on positive ideals; each session
revolves around an ideal, such as honesty or commitment.
161
Chapter 8: Putting PTSD in Its Place with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)

 Concurrent treatment of PTSD and cocaine dependence: Also called
CTPCD, this 16-session approach combines prolonged exposure therapy
(see the earlier section titled “Facing your dragon by your therapist’s
side”) with a different type of approach — coping skills training —
designed to help people with cocaine problems get a handle on their drug
problem. For instance, participants discover how to spot triggers for
cocaine craving, identify lifestyle issues that increase the risk of relapse,
manage anger control issues, and practice ways to refuse offers of cocaine.
These approaches are still new, but initial results are encouraging. For
instance, five men who underwent combined treatment with exposure ther-
apy and Seeking Safety reported drops in drug use, anxiety, trauma symp-
toms, and hostility, improvements in social and sexual relationships, and a
range of other benefits.

Part III: Choosing the Right Treatment Approach 
Using virtual reality to face the horror of 9/11
A case study reported by Dr. JoAnn Difede and
Dr. Hunter Hoffman in CyberPsychology &
Behavior shows the remarkable power of virtual
reality therapy. Difede, an expert on PTSD, and
Hoffman, a scientist studying the uses of virtual
reality in therapy, treated a 26-year-old execu-
tive who was across the street from the north
World Trade Center Tower when it collapsed.
The woman developed serious PTSD symptoms,
including flashbacks of the plane crash, avoid-
ance of any news reports about the attack, and
overwhelming feelings of vulnerability. She felt
cut off from her loved ones and was often very
angry with them. She also developed severe
depression.
A few months after the World Trade Center
attack, the woman underwent standard CBT.
However, she remained flat and emotionless
while talking about her traumatic experience
(even though she reported significant distress),
and she made no progress in therapy.
When the woman tried virtual reality therapy,
however, it was a very different story. Wearing
a virtual-reality helmet that gave her the sensa-
tion of being right in the middle of the attack, she
underwent graded exposure to the event. (For
example, she first saw planes flying over the
building but not striking it. As she progressed,
she witnessed the planes crashing with no
sound, and then witnessed the crashes with
sounds of explosions and screaming.)
The researchers report that the woman
responded nearly instantly. She started crying
and began to tell the horrifying story of what
she’d survived that day. She re-experienced the
feeling that she was going to die, remembered
the chaos of the crowd around her trying to flee,
and recalled needing to leave behind a woman
with severed legs who called out to her for help.
Facing her trauma in virtual reality changed the
woman’s life dramatically. After six sessions,
she no longer met criteria for an official diagno-
sis of either PTSD or depression. Her symptoms
of depression dropped by 83 percent, and her
PTSD symptoms by 90 percent. Difede and
Hoffman say the many different sensory cues
provided by virtual reality may explain why
some people, like their patient, respond so dra-
matically to this new technique.

T
hese days we have a pill for just about everything, from balding heads to
overactive bladders. Thus, many people are surprised that doctors don’t
treat PTSD simply by writing a prescription for some new wonder drug. But
drugs, although they have their place in treating PTSD, aren’t number one on
the list of treatment approaches — and often, patients don’t need them at all.
Why? One reason is that drugs treat only isolated aspects of PTSD. They can
take the edge off certain symptoms, but talk therapy is more effective in ban-
ishing PTSD itself. Another reason is that these drugs often come with a steep
price tag in the form of side effects.
However, there’s a time and place for everything — and that includes PTSD
meds, which can sometimes jump-start therapy or even save a life. In this
chapter, I look at what these drugs can and can’t do, and I give you a quick
glimpse at how each one works. In addition, I tell you why your doctor may
recommend one or more of them, and I offer a list of questions you need to
ask before you say yes or no.
Why Pop a Pill for PTSD?
Patients with PTSD often get better through therapy alone, without ever
taking anything stronger than an aspirin. Sometimes, however, PTSD really
sinks its claws in, making it hard to handle everyday life and even harder (or

164
Part III: Choosing the Right Treatment Approach 
sometimes even impossible) to succeed at therapy. The result: slower heal-
ing, snowballing job and relational problems, and intense suffering. Worse yet,
symptoms can be overwhelming enough to threaten a person’s health or life.
If your PTSD causes you serious problems, your doctor may prescribe medica-
tions to declaw your most dangerous symptoms and help you handle issues
standing in the way of your recovery. Think of these drugs not as a cure-all but
as a means to an end — that end being successful healing through therapy.
A doctor may recommend medication for you for the following reasons:
 You have significant symptoms of depression (see Chapter 3).
 You have trouble sleeping nearly every night.
 Your anxiety is so strong that you have trouble keeping a job or dealing
with therapy.
 You’re experiencing suicidal thoughts or feelings.
 You’re dealing with alcohol or substance abuse issues.
Your family doctor may prescribe drugs for one of these reasons, but you typ-
ically get a referral to a psychiatrist. That’s because psychiatrists, unlike gen-
eral practitioners, are experts on the best medical treatments for PTSD. In
some areas, however, psychologists, nurse practitioners, or psychiatric nurses
can prescribe medication for you (see Chapter 6 for more on therapists).
If a professional does recommend a medication, you may be tempted to just
say yes without giving it too much thought. After all, you have enough on
your plate without trying to second-guess your medical team. However, it’s a
good idea to take a step back and ask yourself, “Is this really the right move
for me?” As a psychiatrist, I know plenty of patients who blossomed in ther-
apy after taking the right medication. On the flipside, however, I know many
who wound up worse off as the result of a pill. I’m also aware that many doc-
tors prescribe drugs sparingly and wisely, but others pull out the prescrip-
tion pad a bit too readily.
So before you agree to take a medication, know just what you’re saying yes
to. The following sections can help you understand how PTSD drugs may
help you, how they can harm you, and what information you need to answer
the question “To medicate, or not to medicate?”
Accounting for Both Sides of the Scale
Life is full of choices, and often you need to weigh some big pros and cons
when you make decisions. For instance, should you buy the pricey car that’s
fun to drive or the cheaper car that gets better mileage? Vacation in New York
City or hit the hiking trails in Yellowstone?

Similarly, deciding whether to include medication in your PTSD treatment plan
involves weighing a lot of pros and cons — and the stakes are much higher in
this case because your decision can affect your health (and sometimes even
your life). In the following sections, I look at the points you need to think over
if a doctor recommends a drug for your PTSD or related problems.
The benefits of medications
Medication for PTSD isn’t for everyone, but if you’re really hurting, it can do a
world of good. Here’s a quick rundown of the potential benefits:
 Medication can stop a crisis from escalating. Sometimes speedy relief is
a top priority — especially if your world is spinning out of control. If
you’re suicidal, unable to work, or in danger of hurting other people,
medications may help you regain control.
 Medication can work fast. Therapy is a long and sometimes difficult
process. If you’re not in any shape (physically or mentally) to face that
process, temporary treatment with a drug may reduce your anxiety 
or other symptoms to the point where you can tackle your therapy 
successfully.
 Medication can help tide you over if you can’t get a therapist right
away. Not everyone lives in L.A. or New York City, where a therapist has
set up shop on every block. If you’re out in the countryside and help
isn’t handy, medication may help you stay the course until you can
figure out a therapy plan.
 For some people, medication is highly effective. Sometimes a drug
intervention can turn a person’s life around. A trauma survivor who
can’t sleep, can’t focus, can’t work, and can’t enjoy life occasionally has
a remarkable breakthrough as a result of a drug treatment. (The catch is
that this improvement is often temporary — something I discuss in the
next section.)
 Medications can treat coexisting disorders. Sometimes you’re dealing
with not just one problem but two or more. For instance, you may be
battling both PTSD and depression. In that case, you may need medica-
tion to get your other issues under control so you can focus on your
PTSD symptoms.
 In some instances, medication works when therapy doesn’t. Studies
show that psychological therapies typically work better than medica-
tions in treating PTSD — but that doesn’t mean they work for everyone.
If therapy doesn’t do the trick for you, medication could be just the
ticket. However, medications work best when paired with therapy — so
if a drug helps, go back to therapy and see whether combining the two
approaches helps even more.
165
Chapter 9: The Role of Medication in Treating PTSD

The cons of meds
TV commercials for drugs that treat psychological problems often make it
seem like all you need to do is take a pill, and you’ll be running through a
field of flowers with a cocker spaniel and an attractive lover, enjoying the
heck out of life. Unfortunately, it’s not that simple. Drugs can ease symptoms,
but they can also cause them — and at their worst, they can cause serious
harm. Here’s why:
 Medications can cause dependence. Some psychiatric drugs are habit-
forming, and one thing you don’t need right now is another serious life
problem such as drug dependency (especially if you’re already striving
to overcome alcohol or drug problems). And even if a drug isn’t techni-
cally addictive, it may cause some severe withdrawal symptoms.
 Medications can cause serious side effects. Many of the drugs used to
treat PTSD symptoms are risky. They have the potential to harm your
heart, make you suicidal (although this idea is controversial, despite all
the news coverage), or even cause diabetes — and that’s just for
starters. That’s why reading up on a drug’s possible side effects before
you take it is critical.
 Drug “honeymoons” often end. One thing doctors see all the time is the
flash-in-the-pan response to a drug. Patients often respond wonderfully
to a medication for weeks or even months, only to crash and burn some
time later. One reason: Your brain can quickly adapt to a new drug, caus-
ing it to lose its effect.
 Drugs can lead to denial. If a drug makes you feel just good enough to
get by, it’s easy to tell yourself that you don’t really need any additional
help. But a pill can’t substitute for understanding, working through, and
overcoming your PTSD — which is why the long-term track record of
drug treatments for PTSD isn’t all that hot.
 Drugs don’t always live up to their hype. For instance, doctors used
the drug guanfacine (Tenex) to treat PTSD for years, only to find out
recently that the drug isn’t any more effective than a placebo.
Knowing How PTSD Drugs Work
You don’t need to know how a spark plug works in order to drive your car,
and you don’t really need to know how PTSD meds work in order to take
them. (In fact, even scientists aren’t entirely sure what many of these drugs
do!) However, it’s a good idea to understand the basic mechanisms of these
medications if you’re thinking about taking one so you know what you can
(and can’t) expect from them. Later in this chapter, I talk about what specific
drugs do — but for now, here’s a quick overview.
166
Part III: Choosing the Right Treatment Approach 

Basic brain science: Taking a look 
at how nerve cells communicate
The drugs that doctors use to treat PTSD come in many different flavors, but
all of them affect the nerve cells in your brain, called neurons. Your brain has
around 100 billion of these busy little cells, and each one has a very big job:
to create and send the messages that tell you what your senses detect, what
you feel and think, and what you should do. Here’s a quick-and-dirty explana-
tion of how they do this (see Figure 9-1 for a picture of this process):
167
Chapter 9: The Role of Medication in Treating PTSD
A tale of two patients
One patient of mine — I’ll call him Jack — made
slow but steady progress overcoming his PTSD
with a combination of two therapy approaches,
but his lack of energy continued to frustrate both
him and me. At one point, when problems
cropped up at work, he started developing sleep-
ing problems and felt even more like he was
“swimming through molasses.” After six weeks
of this, with his job in jeopardy, we both decided
that trying an antidepressant may help him.
Two weeks into treatment with the medication,
he called me crying. I was worried, but he
quickly told me he was crying tears of joy. He
told me that he felt “normal” — something that
he couldn’t ever remember feeling. By normal,
he meant that things rolled off his back, he
walked around with a smile on his face, he felt
20 pounds lighter, and he felt very optimistic
about his future — “The way so many other
people seemed to be, but that I never dreamed
would happen to me.” Furthermore, his
increased energy gave him the motivation to
implement the suggestions we came up with in
his therapy for thinking differently about his life
and interacting more effectively with other
people.
Fortunately, too, unlike many people who turn
out to have major depressive disorder and may
need to remain on medication indefinitely, he
had no problem tapering off his medication six
months later and continued his progress with-
out it.
Not everyone, however, reports such success.
One of my patients seemed to improve modestly
when I put him on antidepressants, but the med-
ications blunted the sharpness he needed to
perform in his job. In addition, the withdrawal
symptoms he experienced later — feeling tired,
not being able to move or think — were worse
than the symptoms of PTSD that originally
caused him to consult me.
The moral of this tale? Drugs have different
effects on different people, and there’s no crys-
tal ball your doctor can use to tell whether
they’ll help you or not. As is the case for much of
medicine, doctors can make educated guesses,
but they can’t make guarantees. So if you take a
medication, know its pros and cons upfront —
but also watch for side effects and report them
to your doctor. Together, you can fine-tune your
treatment so it works for you.

1. When a neuron gets an exciting message, it wants to share the news
with its neighbor; first, it sends a message electrically from one of the
branches (dendrites) on its receiving end all the way down to its tail
(the axon) on the sending end.
2. The tail then spits out chemicals called neurotransmitters (think of
them as tiny molecular delivery trucks).
These chemicals land in the space — called a synapse — that separates
the neuron from its neighbor.
3. The chemicals wander around the synapse, trying to wangle an invite
from neuron No. 2.
Some of them score — yippee! — and get permission to latch onto a
receptor (kind of like a parking place) located on the second neuron’s
dendrites. When this happens, the neurotransmitter can pass on the
exciting news flash from the first neuron, and the process can continue
down the line.
4. A chemical that can’t get a parking place at neuron No. 2 keeps wan-
dering around in the synapse, not quite knowing what to do with
itself, until the first neuron says, “Oh, forget the whole thing!” and
reels it back in.

Part III: Choosing the Right Treatment Approach 

Seeing how meds affect 
the brain’s messages
The drugs that doctors prescribe to treat PTSD symptoms act on different
parts of this message-delivery system, and they do it in a variety of ways:
 Some drugs act at the receptors of the receiving neurons, either putting
out the welcome mat or slamming the door on incoming messages. They
can do this by mimicking the neurotransmitter and triggering the neuro-
transmitter’s usual response from the cell or — conversely — by blocking
the door and preventing the neurotransmitter from reaching its target.
 Some drugs boost the activity of a neurotransmitter by preventing the
sender neuron from retrieving it if it doesn’t find a new home right away.
This leaves more of the neurotransmitter floating around in the synapse,
where it still has a chance to latch onto a new neuron and send its message.
 Some drugs affect several different neurotransmitters at the same
time. For instance, a category of drugs called serotonin and norepineph-
rine reuptake inhibitors (see the section on SNRIs later in this chapter)
increases the effect of both of these neurotransmitters.
The type of drug your doctor may choose depends to a large degree on the
specific symptoms you have and which neurotransmitters influence those
symptoms. Different neurotransmitters affect different aspects of brain func-
tion, including memory, mood, impulse control, motivation, arousal, atten-
tion, and wakefulness. Neurotransmitters also affect cells in different ways;
for example, some make cells more excitable — that is, more receptive to
incoming chemical messages — while others have the opposite effect. And
each neurotransmitter has multiple effects; for example, serotonin can affect
everything from your emotions and impulse control to your appetite.
Thus, different drugs can have very different effects — and that’s true even if
they come from the same chemical family. That’s why easing your symptoms
can take some trial and error (and possibly a combination of medications).
That’s also why drug treatment can be a lifesaver for one person and ineffective
or even dangerous for another — and why you need to carefully weigh the pros
and cons of any prescription before you hit the pharmacy (refer to the earlier
section, “Accounting for Both Sides of the Scale,” for more on that topic).
Surveying Medications Used 
to Treat PTSD Symptoms
When it comes to picking a medication, your doctor has quite a selection to
choose from. Here’s a quick look at the primary medications used to treat the
symptoms of PTSD.
169
Chapter 9: The Role of Medication in Treating PTSD

Antidepressants
As you can tell from the name, antidepressants fight depression, but their name
is misleading because they can also reduce your anxiety levels and help you get
a hair-trigger reaction under control. (In fact, these drugs often work better at
reducing anxiety than drugs specifically targeted to combat this symptom.)
Antidepressants come in several different types, which work in different ways
and have different advantages and drawbacks. Here’s the scoop on each one.
Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)
SSRIs are currently the medication of choice for PTSD. The initials stand for
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, which is a mouthful but actually not all
that complicated (especially if you take a quick peek at Figure 9-1, earlier in
this chapter). Here’s what the name means:
 Selective means that the drug primarily affects only one messenger
chemical.
 Serotonin, one of the neurotransmitters that brain cells use to talk to
each other, is the messenger chemical that this type of drug affects.
Serotonin is a very important chemical because it can affect mood, anxi-
ety levels, aggression, and impulsiveness — as well as many physical
processes including sleep and digestion.
 Reuptake is what happens when a neurotransmitter (serotonin in this
case) fails to link up with another neuron and the sending cell then vacu-
ums it back up.
 Inhibitor means that this drug blocks the reuptake process, thereby
making the neurotransmitter (again, serotonin in this case) more effec-
tive by giving it extra chances to connect with another neuron.
So in short, an SSRI targets serotonin, making it more available to brain cells
by preventing the neurons that crank it out from soaking it back up before it
can affect another cell.
According to studies, SSRIs often do a very good job of reducing PTSD symp-
toms. Some patients respond within a week or two to these medications;
others may take 12 weeks or longer to feel better. (In part, this depends on
the drug; some SSRIs work faster than others.)
On the downside, in rare cases, SSRIs can actually increase depression and
cause suicidal thoughts and impulses (especially in children, teens, and
young adults), which is why these drugs’ labels now caution users about
these potential dangers — although the jury is still out on the suicide risks of
antidepressants. In addition, SSRIs can cause reduced sex drive and a host of
other side effects — and taking them in combination with other drugs that
increase serotonin can be very dangerous. That’s because too much sero-
tonin can cause a condition called serotonin syndrome, in which very serious
170
Part III: Choosing the Right Treatment Approach 

changes occur in heart function, body temperature, and other physical
processes. Although SSRIs aren’t addictive, stopping them abruptly can
cause serious (but usually temporary) withdrawal effects.
SSRIs include drugs such as paroxetine (Paxil), fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline
(Zoloft), fluvoxamine (Luvox), citalopram (Celexa), and escitalopram
(Lexapro).
Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs)
and related drugs
In the same way that SSRIs beef up the effects of serotonin in the brain, SNRIs
boost the power of two messenger chemicals, serotonin and norepinephrine.
Norepinephrine plays an important role in arousal and alertness (for info on
serotonin’s functions, see the preceding section on SSRIs). Like SSRIs, SNRIs
do their job by stopping the cells that send these chemicals out from sucking
them back in again. They’re considered a second-line treatment for PTSD, in
cases in which SSRIs don’t do the trick.
SNRIs can be very effective, but they have adverse effects ranging from
sexual side effects to insomnia and weight gain. These side effects vary,
depending on which medication you take.
SNRIs include venlafaxine (Effexor or Effexor XR) and duloxetine (Cymbalta).
Cymbalta has not been shown to be effective in PTSD.
171
Chapter 9: The Role of Medication in Treating PTSD
Can SSRIs help your brain heal?
SSRIs can make you feel better, and they may
do much more than that: Doctors report some
clues that these drugs can help one brain region
bounce back after PTSD lays it low.
In Chapter 4, I talk about the hippocampus, a
seahorse-shaped brain region that plays a big
role in your emotions and memories. Brain
scans show that the hippocampus can shrink
(atrophy) when it’s hammered by too much
stress.
In 2003, researchers treated PTSD patients with
the SSRI drug paroxetine (Paxil) for one year.
The patients underwent brain scans before and
after the treatment, and the researchers saw a
big difference in the before-and-after shots.
Hippocampal volume increased by 5 percent in
the treated patients — which doesn’t sound like
a lot, but it actually is. In addition, the Paxil-
treated patients performed much better on tests
measuring a type of memory that relies on the
hippocampus (verbal declarative memory,
which you use when you recall information in a
paragraph after hearing it).
This intriguing finding jibes with other reports
hinting that SSRIs can actually cause new
nerve cell growth in the brain. If that’s true, then
SSRIs like Paxil may actually help fix the hard-
ware of the brain. These studies and others are
overturning the long-held notion that adult
brains don’t grow new neurons — and they’re
a good example of how we’re constantly learn-
ing new information about how the brain works
and how to treat problems like PTSD.

In addition to SNRIs, a number of other drugs affect the actions of serotonin,
norepinephrine, or dopamine (another neuransmitter) in differing ways.
These drugs include buproprion (Wellbutrin or Wellbutrin SR), mirtazapine
(Remeron), nefazodone (Serzone), and trazodone (Desyrel).
Tricyclics
Tricyclics are the oldest antidepressants still in use, but they’re falling out of
favor because they have more side effects (such as confusion, headaches,
drowsiness, and blurred vision) than newer drugs. Like SNRIs, tricyclics
boost levels of serotonin and norepinephrine; they may also increase levels
of dopamine. In addition to inhibiting the reuptake of these neurotransmit-
ters and thus increasing their effects, tricyclics block some cell receptors —
which is one reason they often cause so many side effects. These drugs
sometimes help people who don’t respond to other antidepressants.
Tricyclics include amitriptyline (Elavil), nortriptyline (Pamelor), desipramine
(Norpramin), and imipramine (Tofranil).
MAO inhibitors (MAOIs)
As you may guess, MAO inhibitors (MAOIs) stop a substance called MAO
(monoamine oxidase) from doing its job, which is to break down monoamine
neurotransmitters — serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine —
in the brain. This leads to greater levels of these chemicals.
Traditional MAOIs have many side effects and interact with cheese, a range of
other foods, and some alcoholic beverages. (These foods and beverages con-
tain large amounts of an amino acid named tyramine, which is essential for
health but can be very dangerous if high levels accumulate in the body.
Traditional MAOIs prevent monoamine oxidase from breaking down tyra-
mine.) Because of these problems, doctors don’t use traditional MAOIs much
to treat PTSD.
However, the FDA recently approved a low-dose patch form of selegiline
(Emsam), which is a newer form of MAOI (called a reversible inhibitor of
monoamine oxidase A, or RIMA) that doesn’t interact with food and has fewer
side effects than the oldies in this category. That’s because — as the name indi-
cates — it only blocks one type of MAO (the A type) leaving the other type (B)
available to break down unwanted chemicals. Also, its effects are reversible so
the A form can get back in the game if tyramine levels start to rise.
Anti-anxiety drugs
The anti-anxiety drugs that doctors use most to treat PTSD are benzodi-
azepines and buspirone (Buspar), which work in different ways. One is quick
but potentially dangerous, and the other is slower and safer:
172
Part III: Choosing the Right Treatment Approach 

 Benzodiazepines: These drugs act by enhancing the effects of gamma
aminobutyric acid (GABA), which reduces the excitability of nerve cells.
Benzodiazepines work fast, and they may begin to ease anxiety and
sleep problems within days — but you can rapidly become dependent
on them, and quitting can be a bear, which is why SSRIs and other drugs
in that family are often prescribed first. Benzodiazepines can also make
you sleepy, cause memory problems and aggression, and impair your
coordination to the point where it’s dangerous to drive. One more warn-
ing: Never take them if you have substance abuse problems.
Benzodiazepines include alprazolam (Xanax), lorazepam (Ativan), triazo-
lam (Halcion), clonazepam (Klonopin), oxazepam (Serax), temazepam
(Restoril), chlordiazepoxide (Librium), clorazepate (Tranxene),
diazepam (Valium), and flurazepam (Dalmane).
 Buspirone (Buspar): A different type of drug, buspirone, typically takes
two to four weeks to work. However, it has fewer side effects, and it can
reduce symptoms such as intrusive thoughts and nightmares. Scientists
don’t know exactly how it works, although it appears to affect the sero-
tonin system.
Beta-blockers
Beta-blockers are one of the most exciting PTSD treatments on the scene
right now because at least one type of these drugs may actually address the
traumatic memory itself.
Beta-blockers are blood-pressure medications with a long track record and a
relatively good safety profile (although people with certain types of heart dis-
ease can’t take them). They work by blocking beta receptors on certain cells
in the heart, brain, and other organs, keeping adrenaline (and a related chem-
ical, noradrenaline) from stimulating these cells. I talk in Chapter 4 about
how doctors are testing one particular beta-blocker, propranolol (Inderal), as
a means of stopping PTSD before it even starts by keeping memories from
“setting.” In addition, patients with longstanding PTSD symptoms report that
beta-blockers can often calm pounding hearts, rapid breathing, and other
physical symptoms of stress (although it’s unclear if beta blockers other than
propranolol will directly affect PTSD memories).
But the story is much more interesting than that. At the time of this writing,
two doctors, Alain Brunet and Roger Pitman, are trying a new treatment
approach for patients with long-term PTSD. They ask their patients to
describe their trauma as clearly as they can, reliving the scene detail by
detail — and then they immediately give these patients propranolol. The
goal: to prevent the patients from “re-storing” the memories they just
dredged up. This process allows the memory to decay normally instead of
staying as fresh as the day it happened.
173
Chapter 9: The Role of Medication in Treating PTSD

Remarkably, a single dose of propranolol taken after recalling a trauma can
sometimes ward off PTSD symptoms for months, according to early data. It’s
far too soon to tell whether this treatment is as powerful as early research
hints, but if so, it may change the face of PTSD treatment.
Sleeping aids
Benzodiazepines and tricyclic antidepressants (see earlier sections in this
chapter) can bring on sleep, but they come with major side effects. If you have
sleep problems, your doctor may instead prescribe one of several medications
specifically designed to be sleep aids. The latter include the following:
 Zolpidem (Ambien)
 Trazodone (Desyrel)
 Zaleplon (Sonata)
 Eszopiclone (Lunesta)
 Ramelteon (Rozerem)
Ambien, Lunesta, and Sonata all work in pretty much the same way, by targeting
the brain’s receptors (“parking places”) for GABA, a brain messenger-chemical
that helps to regulate sleep. Rozerem works differently, by stimulating brain
receptors for melatonin (a hormone that also helps to regulate sleep/wake
cycles). These drugs have different lengths of action, different risks when it
comes to creating dependency, and differing interactions with other drugs —
so if you decide to take one, be sure to read up on its effects.
If you have mild sleep problems, your doctor may suggest that you try an
over-the-counter sleep aid instead of a prescription medication. Over-the-
counter drugs usually contain antihistamines (for instance, diphenhydramine
hydrochloride) which, in addition to easing the symptoms of allergies, can
make you very drowsy. Typically, these drugs have less effect than prescrip-
tion sleep aids, although they can cause some short-term memory loss. They
also can interact with other medications, so check with your doctor or phar-
macist before taking any of them.
Other meds that often work 
as part of a combination
Because PTSD has so many different faces, doctors use a wide range of drugs
to treat its various symptoms. In addition to the medications I describe in the
previous sections, you may get a prescription for one of these drugs:
174
Part III: Choosing the Right Treatment Approach 

 Anticonvulsants: These drugs, usually used to treat seizures, can reduce
anxiety in some people with PTSD. Side effects vary depending on the
type of medication.
 Lithium: In low doses, this mood-stabilizing drug can sometimes reduce
flashbacks and irritability. Major side effects can include nausea,
changes in kidney function, dizziness, loss of appetite, diarrhea, or thy-
roid changes. Starting with the lowest possible dose can help minimize
the risk of these side effects.
 Atypical antipsychotics: These very potent drugs may reduce paranoia
or severe flashbacks in cases where other treatments don’t help.
However, they have some serious side effects, including weight gain,
blood sugar fluctuations, and diabetes. (By the way, they’re called atypi-
cal because they work in a variety of ways that differ from earlier
antipsychotic drugs.)
 Drugs to treat alcoholism/substance abuse: Your medical team may pre-
scribe drugs such as naltrexone (ReVia) or acamprosate (Campral — a
drug prescribed after a person stops drinking, in order to prevent relapses)
to help you kick the habit. These drugs work in different ways — for
example, naltrexone blocks opiate receptors and reduces the high
caused by drugs or alcohol; acamprosate helps to reduce the physical
and emotional distress caused by stopping alcohol consumption. Because
of their different mechanisms and effects, one may be more effective for
you than another.
Speak Up! Asking Questions before 
You Take a Medication
Any medication, even an aspirin, has the potential to change your life for
better or for worse. That’s especially true for the drugs used to treat PTSD
because they’re some of the most powerful drugs ever invented. If they do
their job right, they can help you tame the PTSD monster. If they don’t, you
can wind up with more problems on your plate.
If you and your doctor agree that medication is a good choice for you, the
next step is to figure out which medication will do you the most good — and,
equally important, which is the safest in your case. Because taking a medica-
tion is a big life decision, be sure to have the necessary facts in hand before
saying yes or no. Here some basic questions to ask your doctor to get a gen-
eral understanding of the drug:
 What does this drug do? Make sure the drug your doctor prescribes is
likely to treat your most troublesome symptoms, and get a realistic 
picture of what it can and can’t do for you.
175
Chapter 9: The Role of Medication in Treating PTSD

 How long does this drug take to work? Some medications act quickly, and
others take weeks or even months to start making you feel better. If you
know what to expect, you can tell whether the medication is working right.
 How long will I need to take this drug? Find out whether this drug is a
short-term prescription or something the doctor thinks you should take
for months or even years.
The following questions are especially important because they can help you
ensure your safety and well-being:
 What side effects does this drug have, and how often do they occur?
Any drug (including the ones you buy off-the-shelf in the grocery store)
can cause side effects. The important thing is to know how serious these
side effects are and whether they happen a once in a blue moon or fairly
frequently.
 Can this drug make me suicidal? It sounds odd, but medications that pre-
vent depression can sometimes raise your risk of having suicidal thoughts
or feelings — especially in the early weeks when you first start taking
them. Some antidepressants may be riskier than others in this regard.
 Can this drug cause dependency? If your doctor says yes to this ques-
tion, ask how long you can safely take the drug — and ask whether the
doctor can provide any safer alternatives.
 Can this drug cause serious withdrawal effects? If so, find out what
these effects are. Even if the withdrawal effects are not serious, find out
what effects you can expect to have when you stop the medication. Also
ask how long it will take for you to get off the medication when you and
your doctor decide to do so.
 Can I safely take this drug with the other medications or supplements
I use? PTSD drugs don’t always play well with others, so be sure your
doctor knows about any other prescription or over-the-counter drugs
you’re taking. Trouble can also arise if you combine PTSD medications
with nutritional supplements or herbs; for instance, combining SSRIs,
MAOIs or Buspar with St. John’s wort is risky.
 Does this drug interact with any foods or beverages? In particular, ask
whether your medication can interact with grapefruit juice, which makes
many drugs — Valium, for example — far more potent. Also, if your
doctor prescribes an MAOI, make sure you fully understand any dietary
taboos associated with this type of drug.
 (If you’re pregnant) Is this drug safe for my unborn baby? If taking a
drug means you’re medicating for two, you need to be even more careful
about considering the drug. In this case, you need to check with your
entire team of doctors — family doctor, obstetrician, and therapist —
before agreeing to take a medication. If at all possible, put off any drug
treatment until after your baby arrives — and after you finish breast-
feeding if you’re planning to nurse.
176
Part III: Choosing the Right Treatment Approach 

If your symptoms aren’t dangerous and don’t seriously interfere with your life
and you’re not quite keen on taking a medication, ask your doctor whether
you can try a non-drug alternative first. Improving your diet, reducing your
caffeine and alcohol intake, trying relaxation methods (see Chapter 10), exer-
cising, and reducing life stressors can sometimes solve sleep problems or
reduce anxiety levels, reducing or eliminating the need for a medication.
Also, do your own research when a doctor hands you a prescription. The best
sources for information include your doctor, a pharmacist, package inserts,
reliable Internet sources, and the Physicians’ Desk Reference (PDR) (published
by Thomson). You can find an online version of the PDR’s info for consumers
at www.pdrhealth.com — just click on the drug information tab — or you
can find the book itself at nearly any public library.
Taking Meds Wisely
To boost the chances that a medication will chase symptoms away without
causing new ones, do your detective work before accepting a prescription
(which I cover in the preceding section). Then follow a few sensible rules
when you start taking your medication:
 Always take the right dosage at the right time. Double-check the label
to see whether the instructions match what your doctor told you.
If you have trouble remembering to take medications, set a reminder on
your computer or use a pill container with dividers for each day.
 When you start your new medication, tune in to your body’s response.
Your doctor knows what drugs do to most people, but you’re the expert
on your own one-of-a-kind body — so you’re the best judge of how a
drug works for you. If you spot any symptoms that you think stem from
your medication, call your doctor’s office — and call right away if your
symptoms are serious. Serious symptoms include but aren’t limited to
• Significant mental symptoms, such as confusion, agitation, aggres-
sive impulses, suicidal feelings, or extreme restlessness
• Serious physical symptoms, such as fainting, severe nausea or
vomiting, rashes, difficulty breathing (which can indicate an aller-
gic reaction), weakness, heart palpitations, or seizures
 If you take medications for other conditions, have all your prescrip-
tions filled at the same pharmacy. Drugs for PTSD can interact with
other meds, and most pharmacies have systems that flag potentially
dangerous combos.
 Notify your whole team if you start taking a drug for your PTSD. That
includes your primary care doctor, your therapist, and any specialists
treating PTSD-related symptoms.
177
Chapter 9: The Role of Medication in Treating PTSD

 Never, ever stop taking a medication without consulting your doctor.
Quitting your meds abruptly can send your brain and body into a tailspin,
so ask your doctor how to wean yourself off the drug slowly and safely.
And if your symptoms vanish when you’re taking a drug, don’t assume
that you don’t need it anymore — most likely, the drug is what’s keeping
your symptoms under control.
 If you’re sick with the flu or food poisoning and can’t keep your meds
down, talk to your doctor immediately about what to do. This is impor-
tant even if you think you’ll be over your bug in a day or two.
With luck — and some good teamwork on your part and your doctor’s — 
you can pick just the right medication to clear away stumbling blocks to
recovery and help you hit your stride in therapy. When that happens, ask
your doctor whether it makes sense to taper off your medications or if 
continuing to combine therapy and medication is the right one-two punch
to knock out your PTSD.

In This Chapter
 Looking at trauma through psychological approaches
 Using the mind-body connection to heal
 Choosing a therapy that’s right for you
P
eople aren’t like gingerbread men, all shaped by the same cookie cutter.
Instead, everyone has a history that’s his alone, a one-of-a-kind personal-
ity, and even a unique biology. Similarly, no one-size-fits-all therapy works for
people with PTSD. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT — see Chapter 8) and
its offshoots have the most scientific support, and many doctors also find
medications effective (see Chapter 9), but these approaches don’t work 
wonders for every person with PTSD.
Fortunately, you have a lot of other options of therapies to help you heal
after a trauma. As you read through the sections in this chapter, you can see
that some of the therapies I describe are used as front-line options, while
many work best as adjuncts — that is, therapies you do in addition to a primary
therapy like CBT.
In this chapter, I talk about the considerations you should keep in mind when
deciding whether to try any of these therapies, which fall into two broad cat-
egories: psychological approaches that differ from typical CBT, and therapies
that tap the power of your body in order to heal your mind.

180
Part III: Choosing the Right Treatment Approach 
Seeing Your Trauma through New Eyes:
Psychological Approaches
In Chapter 8, I discuss cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), in which you con-
front your trauma and discover new ways of thinking about what happened to
you. (That chapter also covers several other therapies that employ CBT but
are present oriented, meaning that they don’t involve confronting your
trauma.) CBT is the most popular form of therapy for PTSD, but other psycho-
logical therapies — some that are kissing cousins of CBT and others that use
very different approaches — may help many people gain control over PTSD. In
this section, I look at some of the most popular of these therapies, how they
work, and what people know about their benefits or the harm they may do.
As you read these sections, note that although some of these therapies have
documented scientific support, others fall into the buyer-beware category
because they’re relatively new or untested. However, you don’t find a
thumbs-up or thumbs-down rating for any of the therapies I outline because I
can’t promise that any therapy in this chapter will or won’t work for a given
individual. A therapy that I think is unproven and possibly ineffective may
prove to be just the ticket for you.
Note: Several of the therapies I talk about here could just as easily go in
Chapter 8. Some of them, however, don’t include all the facets of CBT — and
others do, but their developers say they’re not CBT. My suggestion: Don’t
worry too much about it. Labels aren’t as important as results!
Neuro-linguistic programming (NLP)
Back in the 1970s, mathematician Richard Bandler and linguistics professor
John Grinder created neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) in an effort to com-
bine what they saw as the best features of many different therapy techniques.
NLP is a collection of approaches based on these two principles:
 Each person has an internal map based on his perception of the world
and the language he uses to express this perception. This map is often
distorted or limited, and by changing it, you can alter your thoughts and
behavior in positive ways.
 By studying successful people, you can model their behaviors and
become more successful yourself. Similarly, by identifying the language
and behaviors that make you successful in some areas of your life, you
can begin using them in other areas where you currently have problems.

181
Chapter 10: Additional Paths to Wellness
The power of sharing
One question people often ask me is “Why do
different therapies work for different people?”
The answer, in part, is that the type of therapy
is less important than the knowledge that you
and your therapist are a team — and that when
you enter the therapy room, you’re no longer
alone with your despair.
Years ago, I experienced an incident that
opened my eyes to the power of sharing your
despair with someone who understands. It
started when a colleague called me a few years
ago and asked me to see Gina, a lovely woman
so tormented by a violent rape that she’d tried
to commit suicide several times. In her last
attempt, she’d leaped off a third-floor balcony,
shattering her pelvis.
For six months, Gina sat across from me in ther-
apy. She rarely spoke and often didn’t even
answer my questions — but every week, she
showed up on time. It was the only clue I had
that our sessions helped her.
One day, I was exhausted when Gina arrived. I’d
been awake for 36 hours helping emergency
room patients who needed psychiatric evalua-
tions, and I could barely keep my eyes open. But
my exhaustion couldn’t explain what happened
next. As Gina talked, I saw all the color disap-
pear from the room around me, replaced by
waves of gray. At first, I thought I was having a
stroke or a seizure. Gina wasn’t looking at me,
so I quickly checked my reflexes and vision but
detected no problems.
And then I realized the truth: Somehow, I actu-
ally felt the pain Gina was trying to convey.
Before I could stop myself, I said, “I never knew
it was so bad. And I can’t help you kill yourself,
but if you do, I will still think well of you, I’ll miss
you, and maybe I’ll understand why you needed
to.”
I was horrified when I realized what I’d said. In
trying to express my understanding of her bleak
world, I’d given her permission to kill herself!
But her response startled me. Slowly, she
glanced at me — the first solid eye contact
she’d made — and then she smiled. When I
asked her why, she looked me straight in the
eye again, and I could see the “no bull” look of
someone who’s dropped her defenses.
“If you can really understand why I might need
to kill myself,” she said, “maybe I won’t have
to.” As soon as the words left her mouth, the
colors in the room began to reappear in front of
my eyes.
My patient changed, too — in far more dramatic
ways. Over time, she completed treatment and
went on to get married, raise a family, and get a
graduate degree in psychology.
I don’t know what happened to me that day; per-
haps I was so tired I lost touch with my con-
scious surroundings and became aware of
things I might otherwise not sense. My guess is
that my exhaustion, combined with the power of
my patient’s silent despair, broke through my
own defenses.
Whatever it was, it forever changed how I listen
to patients. And it helped me to truly grasp the
fact that training, intellectual theories, and dif-
ferent therapeutic approaches mean far less
than letting a person in despair know one simple
fact: You are not alone anymore.

NLP focuses on helping people find more successful ways of thinking, behav-
ing, and communicating. In this term, the neuro refers to the neurological
processes that underlie behavior, and the linguistic refers to both verbal com-
munication and body language.
Very little well-designed research exists on the effectiveness of NLP in treating
PTSD. What’s more, NLP practitioners have a cornucopia of tools to choose
from and the length of therapy varies (although it often lasts only two to four
sessions), so comparing one therapist’s approach with another’s is nearly
impossible. However, some bits and pieces of NLP are well-established as
effective. For instance, NLP uses two well-studied tools of cognitive behavioral
therapy (see Chapter 8): It asks you to experience your trauma again, and it
helps you to reframe what happened in a different way.
Common techniques used in NLP
NLP is a toolbox of techniques designed to help you achieve these goals.
Several that are relevant to PTSD include the following:
 Reframing: In this technique, also used in CBT (see Chapter 8) and many
other approaches, you discover how to look at an event in a different
way and thus give it a different meaning.
For example, a person who initially thinks that she failed in a crisis
because she couldn’t save a friend’s life can use reframing to gain the
understanding that she tried heroically to save her friend and did the
best she could given her lack of medical training. Thus, the message “I
failed” becomes the message “I was heroic and did the best job anyone
in my shoes could do.”
 Swish: In this technique, you spot the cues that lead to unwanted behav-
iors and figure out how to give them the boot by visualizing a desired goal
instead. The swish involves rapidly pushing the undesired image away
from you mentally while pulling the positive visualization toward you.
For example, if the sight of the bedroom where a robber attacked you
brings on panic attacks, you may replace this image instantly with a
mental picture of yourself happily redecorating the room with the fancy
bedspread and furniture you always wanted.
 Anchoring: This method stems from the fact that you associate emo-
tions with certain stimuli. For example, you may associate the smell of
candles with happy holidays in your childhood — or with the traumatic
memory of a fire.
Most anchors are unconscious, but in NLP, you discover how to create
anchors intentionally. For example, by repeatedly recalling a time when
you felt strong or happy or calm and associating that memory with an
anchor — a ring on your finger or even a touch on a knuckle — you can
use this anchor later to trigger the emotion you want to experience.
182
Part III: Choosing the Right Treatment Approach 

One key technique of NLP: Separating yourself from a memory
One tool of NLP — visual/kinesthetic dissociation (V/KD) — is particularly
important in treating PTSD. This special visualization technique is designed
to help the person separate (dissociate) herself from a traumatic memory by
viewing it as though she were outside her body. (Kinesthetic, by the way, is
just a fancy word referring to the sensory input provided by your body — for
instance, your perception of gravity or motion.) The idea behind V/KD is that
by changing how you view your trauma, you can detach yourself from it and
process it from a rational perspective.
Practitioners say that this disassociation is different from traumatic dissociation
(see Chapter 3), not only because they’re spelled differently (although that’s
true too!), but also because in the therapeutic technique of dissociation, the
person remains in control of the process.
A typical V/KD session (patients may undergo a single session or several)
involves the following steps, although the steps vary for different therapists:
1. You first dicsover and use relaxation techniques.
2. When you’re calm and relaxed, your therapist asks you to picture
yourself — as if in a photo — as you were before your trauma.
3. Your therapist asks you to visualize your trauma from the viewpoint of
an outside observer.
Typically, he asks you to imagine that you’ve stepped out of your body
and into the projection booth of a movie theater, where you can watch
yourself sitting in a seat below, viewing a movie of your trauma. (This
process puts you several steps away from the trauma.)
4. As you visualize your trauma, the therapist encourages you to alter
your movie in different ways.
For example, you may view your imaginary film in black-and-white and
then in color, run it backward, or make it louder or quieter. You repeat
this process until you feel a sense of control over your memory.
5. The therapist asks you to return to your body, think about the new
meaning you gained from the experience, and share your insights and
positive emotions with the “younger self” in the photo you initially
visualized in Step 2, as if that younger self is in the room with you.
One variant of V/KD that’s also popular is the rewind technique, developed by
David Muss. In this approach, you first watch your film from the projection-
booth point of view and then view it as though you were actually in the film
rather than simply observing it. The second time, however, you view the film
backwards.
183
Chapter 10: Additional Paths to Wellness

V/KD has little formal research to prove or disprove its usefulness, but it
does use several validated techniques, including a version of exposure ther-
apy (more about this in Chapter 8). The few studies published on the tech-
nique indicate that it helps some people quite dramatically but provides little
or no benefit to others.
One caution if you’re considering V/KD: Patients who are vulnerable to disso-
ciation (a type of defense mechanism — see Chapter 3 for a description of
this symptom) shouldn’t undergo this therapy because the voluntary dissoci-
ation technique may trigger involuntary dissociation.
Traumatic incident reduction (TIR)
Traumatic incident reduction (TIR) looks a little bit like cognitive behavioral
therapy (CBT) but is really a very different approach. Like CBT, this therapy
asks patients to confront their trauma. However, it uses a different method
than CBT does and has different goals. (It’s also different from visual/kines-
thetic dissociation, which I discuss in the preceding section, and other
rewind techniques, even though it uses a similar mental-movie technique.)
TIR is a short therapy (usually one session per trauma) in which the thera-
pist acts more as a facilitator and the patient does the majority of the work.
Here’s how a typical TIR session goes:
1. The patient (typically referred to as the viewer) identifies a trauma he
wants to confront.
A key principal is that the patient decides what he wants to confront —
and how intensely he wants to confront it — in this intervention.
2. The patient mentally views the trauma as if it’s a videotape.
First, he “rewinds” it to the beginning. Next, he views the entire trauma
from start to finish.
3. Afterward, the therapist asks what happened, and — with little or no
guidance from the therapist — the patient describes what happened
and how he felt about it.
Typically, the therapist offers no advice and doesn’t evaluate or ques-
tion the patient’s insights.
4. The patient repeats the process of rewinding and watching the mental
video of his trauma, talking about the experience after each viewing.
TIR sessions typically last one to two hours. Overall, therapy can last any-
where from a single session (which is common for PTSD stemming from a
single trauma) to a dozen or so (which can occur when a patient has complex
PTSD and needs to address multiple traumas). According to TIR practition-
ers, patients typically experience increasing emotion during the first few
184
Part III: Choosing the Right Treatment Approach 

viewings, and then this emotion fades until they hit a point where they have
no negative reaction to the trauma. The process continues until the patient
actually experiences positive emotions (or calmness at a minimum).
Therapists who use this approach say that virtually all patients achieve this
state at the end of a session.
Although it shares a few features with CBT, TIR involves very little input from
the therapist and is a much shorter procedure. It also focuses more intensely
on encouraging patients to search for earlier (pre-trauma) similar incidents
that may influence their thoughts and behavior. Patients may address these
incidents in a somewhat different process called thematic TIR, which focuses
on a particular symptom. For example, a person with anger issues may
choose to use the mental video-tape procedure outlined in Step 2 of the list
earlier in this section to work through each remembered incident in which he
experienced extreme anger, until he reaches the earliest incident of extreme
anger he can remember.
In the absence of any well-designed research on TIR’s effectiveness, it’s impos-
sible to say whether the approach works for most patients. Its proponents
point to case studies indicating that it can achieve quick cures, buts its critics
say its techniques — based to a large degree on methods used in Scientology —
are unproven.
Psychodynamic therapy
Psychodynamic therapy looks at the unconscious dynamics that play a role in
emotions and behavior. In this type of therapy, just as in CBT, a therapist helps
you to address the unconscious thoughts and conflicts that arise from a
trauma. However, your therapist also explores maladaptive thoughts and
behaviors that don’t necessarily stem from the trauma, and you may spend
time exploring pre-trauma events that possibly created a vulnerability to PTSD.
For instance, a psychodynamic therapist may be interested in any feelings of
abandonment you feel as a result of your parents divorcing during your child-
hood, and how these feelings may impact your current PTSD.
Psychodynamic therapy, a great-great-grandchild of Freud’s techniques, is a
shorter version of psychoanalysis. (If you watched The Sopranos, you saw a
good representation of long-term psychoanalysis conducted by Tony Soprano’s
therapist; in fact, the American Psychoanalytic Association gave her an award
for her performance!) Unlike long-tern psychoanalysis, which can last a year or
more, psychodynamic therapy typically lasts only a few months. This therapy
involves lots of talking on your part, as you and your therapist seek to break
down the unconscious psychological defenses — think of them as barriers to
reality — that can get in the way of your healing from PTSD.
One cornerstone of psychodynamic therapy is transference, meaning that you
may transfer feelings about your trauma or about other people to your 
185
Chapter 10: Additional Paths to Wellness

therapist. For example, you may become angry at the therapist when you’re
really angry at a person who hurt or betrayed you during your trauma.
Addressing this transference helps you and your therapist to identify the
unconscious maladaptive feelings, motivations, and thoughts you have about
yourself and other people, so you can bring these out into the open and
defuse them.
It’s hard to know just how well this approach works in treating PTSD, because
psychodynamic therapists use many different approaches. Also, most studies
of this technique are single-case studies — not very useful in revealing the
big picture. However, the Cochrane Collaboration, a group that reviews med-
ical research to help professionals determine what’s effective and what isn’t,
did include psychodynamic therapy when it reviewed studies on different
forms of therapy for PTSD (more on this study in Chapter 8). Their report
concluded that psychodynamic therapy isn’t as effective as CBT.
That said, a few studies do show that psychodynamic therapy can help some
people a great deal, especially when combined with other techniques. One
study of traumatized police officers, for instance, showed that those who
underwent a treatment called brief eclectic psychotherapy (which combines
psychodynamic therapy with CBT) showed significant improvement at a
three-month follow-up compared to officers on a waiting list for treatment.
One form of psychodynamic therapy that needs to come with a warning label is
repressed memory therapy. In this technique, a therapist’s goal is to guide you to
remember memories that you’ve buried deep down. For instance, a grown woman
may suddenly get flashes of memories about her father abusing her. The problem
with repressed memory therapy is that the memories it dredges up are often false.
(See the nearby sidebar, “False memories and confabulation: Two tricks your
mind can play on you.”) So if you choose to explore this type of therapy, read up
on it and understand the possible risks — both to you and to your family.
Hypnotherapy
Think of hypnosis, and you probably conjure up a picture of someone cluck-
ing like a chicken or lying stiff as a board between two chairs. But hypnosis
isn’t just a magic act. Used therapeutically, it’s a means of achieving deep
relaxation and opening your mind to things beyond the here-and-now.
Here’s what doesn’t happen under therapeutic hypnosis:
 You don’t lose awareness of who and where you are.
 You don’t fall under the spell of the therapist and do whatever she bids.
(No chicken clucking, honest!)

False memories and confabulation: Two tricks 
your mind can play on you
Record a TV show, and each time you play it
back, the plot will be exactly the same. But
people’s memories don’t work like a video
recorder, which is why two people can remem-
ber the same event very differently. To make
matters even more confusing — and danger-
ous, when it comes to therapy — you can
remember things that never happened at all.
Therapists and patients discovered this the hard
way in the 1980s and early 1990s, when an inter-
vention called repressed memory therapy
became popular. Supposedly, the therapy helped
patients retrieve memories they’d buried entirely
— often memories of horrific abuse by their par-
ents or daycare providers. But as it turned out,
therapists often unwittingly planted these mem-
ories in their patients’ minds. (I’d need a whole
book to describe this process, but a quick expla-
nation is that both therapists and patients are
suggestible, and if both become convinced that
episodes of incest, molestation, or even satanic
abuse underlie a symptom, a patient’s mind may
obligingly create false memories of such an
event.) As a result, many patients wound up
breaking their ties with loved ones who’d never
hurt them, and a number of innocent parents and
daycare workers went to jail.
Repressed memory therapy is no longer in
vogue, and therapists using other approaches
are extremely careful not to use techniques that
may accidentally create false memories. But
doctors and patients still have to deal with the
fact that memory is faulty even under the best
of circumstances.
For example, take a look at a phenomenon
called confabulation. In its strictest sense, con-
fabulation is a symptom seen in many brain-
injured patients who fully believe memories of
things that never occurred. (For instance, if you
ask one of these brain-injured patients why he’s
wearing a coat in the summer, he may say, “The
nurse told me to put it on,” fully believing it, even
if it’s not true.) But new evidence shows that
everyone confabulates to some degree, often to
justify a decision when someone doesn’t really
know why he made it.
In one experiment, for instance, researchers
laid out four identical pieces of clothing and
asked volunteers to pick the best one. In this
type of experiment, people nearly always pick
the item that’s farthest to the right. Four out of
five of these volunteers followed suit, but when
asked why they chose that particular item, the
volunteers made up all sorts of interesting rea-
sons about the fabric, the color, and so on. Not
one said “Because it’s on the right side,” which
was the real reason. In reality, they probably
didn’t know why they picked it, so their minds
happily let them off the hook by providing a
reason.
Confabulation can occur inside the therapy
room as well as outside. To minimize this possi-
bility, a good therapist is careful to let you tell
your memories your way, instead of trying to put
words in your mouth (or ideas in your mind) —
which is especially important if your trauma
involved a crime, and you may need to testify
clearly and correctly about what happened.

Instead, a hypnotherapist uses soothing imagery or other techniques to relax
you, allowing you to view your trauma calmly and possibly to
 Remember important parts of your trauma that are currently blocked
from your memory. This can help you process and come to terms with
these buried memories.
 Revisit times when you experienced good events and positive feelings,
helping you to put your trauma in context.
 Offer positive suggestions such as “You’ll feel calmer when you drive.”
Note: A reputable therapist won’t do this without your prior permission.
Be wary of any therapist who claims to use hypnosis to unlock “repressed
memories.” (See the sidebar in this chapter on “False memories and confabu-
lation: Two tricks your mind can play on you,” for more on the risks of
repressed memory therapy.) A good hypnotherapist offers you the tools to
let your own memories surface, but he won’t actively plant ideas in your
mind (for instance, by suggesting that your insomnia or anxiety is a likely
symptom of abuse, and that you’re “in denial” if you can’t remember it).
Hypnosis has a long history as a treatment for PTSD, and army hospitals
used it as a therapy for shell shock in World War II. However, the Cochrane
Collaboration (see the section “Psychodynamic therapy” and Chapter 8 for
more info) compared hypnosis (as a primary treatment) to cognitive behav-
ioral therapy and found that CBT was far more effective. So the consensus
seems to be that if you use hypnosis, use it as part of a well-rounded treat-
ment plan — not as your only option. As such, it’s currently most often used
to augment other psychological therapies rather than as a primary treat-
ment. Even then, people question its usefulness because some research sug-
gests that CBT alone is as helpful as the combination of CBT and hypnosis.
Art therapy
Art therapy for PTSD hit its peak of popularity in the Vietnam era but isn’t
used as much today because treatments such as CBT and medications are
replacing it. However, some people find art therapy to be very powerful medi-
cine. It’s typically offered in addition to other therapies instead of a sole
treatment, except when therapists use it as a primary therapy in treating chil-
dren (see Chapter 15 for more on this).
In art therapy, which can be either an individual or group therapy, the thera-
pist provides you with the materials you need to express yourself artistically,
and then helps you to use these materials to work through your trauma. In
some cases, she may offer guidance — for example, by asking you to draw a
picture of how you perceive your body after your trauma. In other cases, she
may ask you to draw or sculpt anything you wish.
188
Part III: Choosing the Right Treatment Approach 

In either case, she talks with you about clues that emerge from your artwork. For
instance, if you draw a picture of yourself standing far apart from other people
on a hillside, you and your therapist may discuss the reasons why the “you” in
your drawing is so distant. The amount of direction, guidance, and interpretation
offered by an art therapist varies widely from therapist to therapist.
Art therapy has the following advantages:
 It offers people who can’t yet talk about their trauma a safe way to
express their pain.
 Many people find that describing their trauma in the form of imagery
helps them to understand and find new meaning in it. Just as some
people find healing in talking about their trauma, others find healing in
expressing their emotions in paint or clay. Also, defining a traumatic
experience within the boundaries of a painting or sculpture can help a
person feel a sense of control over it.
 Art is a powerful stress reliever, and getting lost in the act of painting or
sculpting can give a troubled mind a much-needed rest.
 Art therapy combines the negative emotions of recalling a trauma with
the pleasurable process of creation, which may help in processing upset-
ting memories.
Because art therapy can arouse powerful memories, it’s best to seek out a
certified therapist who’s trained in both art and psychology (ask whether the
therapist has an ATR-BC certification). A therapist with this training can help
you work through any painful emotions that arise.
Little formal research on art therapy is available, but small studies on the use
of this therapy for veterans indicate that it’s frequently helpful. In some
cases, it appears to benefit people with severe PTSD symptoms who don’t
respond well to other treatments.
And remember: You don’t need to be a budding Picasso or Michelangelo to
benefit from art therapy — nobody grades your work! However, the art at the
National Vietnam Veterans Art Museum — www.nvvam.org — includes some
remarkable works by veterans with PTSD. You may want to check it out.
“Tapping” therapy
One of the most controversial therapies for PTSD is tapping, which comes in
several forms. (Two of the most popular are called Thought Field Therapy and
Emotional Freedom Techniques.) Unlike other therapies, tapping derives from
the philosophies of Eastern medicine. Roger Callahan, the developer of
Thought Field Therapy, says his technique works by “balancing the body’s
189
Chapter 10: Additional Paths to Wellness

energy system.” Gary Craig, the developer of Emotional Freedom Techniques,
likens the process to “emotional acupuncture” and claims that you can use
his therapy for “anything from the common cold to cancer” — as well as for
PTSD.
The premise underlying both of these therapies, as well as other tapping
therapies, is that a trauma causes negative emotions that disrupt the body’s
energy flow. Thus, practitioners say, it’s crucial to correct this energy imbal-
ance as you address your negative memories and emotions. The treatment is
brief, sometimes lasting only a few minutes.
Tapping therapies involve the following steps:
1. You think of a disturbing thought or memory.
2. You simultaneously tap your fingers on different energy meridian
points on your body.
Your therapist shows you how and where to tap and may also ask you to
do other simple tasks like humming or counting. Another term for these
points is acupoints; see Acupressure & Reflexology For Dummies (Wiley)
by Bobbi Dempsey and Synthia Andrews for more info.
3. After each round of this procedure, your therapist asks questions
about your feelings and whether they’re changing.
Tapping therapists say that by tapping on the points where energy is
either stored in excess or blocked, you assist the energy in flowing
freely, thereby allowing the energy to heal your mind, body, and soul.
Some tapping techniques specify different sequences of tapping points
for different medical problems; others don’t.

Part III: Choosing the Right Treatment Approach 
Unleashing creativity as a source of healing
People with PTSD can express their emotions
and make sense of their experiences in many
different ways. One, of course, is by talking to a
therapist. Another is through art (see section on
“Art therapy” in this chapter). But any creative
outlet can offer a sense of peace or catharsis. If
you live in a large city, you may find therapists
who offer these approaches to healing:
 Drama therapy
 Dance therapy
 Poetry therapy
 Music therapy
Each of these therapies is much like art therapy
in that it allows you to bring your positive cre-
ativity to bear on a negative experience and
define your trauma in a new way. No hard evi-
dence supports these therapies as effective
treatments for PTSD, but some individuals —
especially those who find talking about their
traumas too painful — find them very helpful.

A few not-very-rigorously designed studies of tapping therapy’s effects on
simple phobias indicate that some patients improve. However, one study cast
strong doubt on why the therapy helps some people. In that test, researchers
divided participants into four groups. One group received no treatment; one
tapped on the correct meridian points; one tapped on other body areas; and
another tapped on a doll. Because all three treatment groups showed similar
improvements, the researchers concluded that tapping has nothing to do
with unblocking energy and that any benefits may arise from a placebo effect.
(A placebo effect occurs when a patient improves simply because he expects
a treatment to work.)
The bottom line on tapping therapies: No good evidence indicates that they
work. But they’re relatively quick, so if you decide to try one of these thera-
pies, you aren’t out a great deal of time. The biggest risk is that if it doesn’t
work — or causes only a temporary placebo effect — you may be discour-
aged from trying other, more-proven therapies.
Another therapy that sometimes uses tapping, but for very different reasons,
is Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) Therapy, which I
cover in Chapter 8. EMDR shouldn’t be confused with the tapping therapies I
describe here.
Enlisting Your Body to Help 
Heal Your Mind
One thing you know for sure if you have PTSD is that your mind affects your
body — and vice versa. For instance, a memory of your trauma can make
your heart race and your hands sweat. And it works the other way around: A
skinned knee, a burn from a stove, or the twinge from a scar can trigger mem-
ories of your trauma.
Luckily, you can also put this mind-body connection to work for you. The ther-
apies I describe in the next sections can sometimes help reduce symptoms of
PTSD either a little or a lot when you use them to supplement CBT or other
effective psychological therapies. Note: In most cases, these approaches aren’t
enough in and of themselves to effectively address moderate or severe PTSD.
Relaxation therapies
One of the first steps in most therapies for PTSD involves developing simple
relaxation techniques so you can confront your trauma and still stay in control.
191
Chapter 10: Additional Paths to Wellness

Relaxation techniques can also play a role in preventing PTSD or in minimizing
the risk of relapses after therapy. (For examples of some basic techniques,
see Chapter 4.)
Relaxation techniques alone can’t treat PTSD, but they can ease symptoms
and may help you prevent panic attacks. They don’t need to be complicated,
either; one 1997 study of Vietnam vets found that doing a simple relaxation
technique while sitting in a comfy chair worked as well as more-complicated
procedures involving breathing exercises or biofeedback.
One great thing about these techniques is that they’re virtually risk-free, and
some of them — especially yoga and tai chi — can help you keep in shape as
well. That’s important, because you’re less vulnerable to PTSD symptoms
when your body is functioning up to par. Here are some popular relaxation
therapies:
 Yoga and tai chi: No hard data support the benefits of either of these
approaches in relieving PTSD, but studies do show that they can reduce
stress and anxiety in general. Exercise that promotes relaxation and calm-
ness can be highly beneficial. One note, however: If you have medical
problems, make sure your doctor okays these exercise approaches —
especially yoga, which can be surprisingly strenuous.
 Massage therapy: Some people find massage therapy helpful; however, it
can sometimes trigger flashbacks or panic attacks in people whose PTSD
stems from a physical assault, so go slowly and find an understanding
massage therapist who’ll back off if problems arise.
 Meditation: Although it doesn’t fit neatly into any category, meditation
is gaining scientific support. The Veterans Administration hospital in San
Diego is currently investigating the effects of mantram therapy (which
uses the techniques of meditation and involves repeating words or
phrases that help you stay centered in the present) and is reporting
some encouraging results.
 Breathing exercises: If you suffer from panic attacks, you may benefit
from consulting a therapist who specializes in teaching breathing tech-
niques that can stop these attacks in their tracks. (See Chapter 8 for info
on a technique that combines breathing therapy for panic attacks with
cognitive behavioral therapy for PTSD.)
Neurofeedback therapy
In neurofeedback (also called neurotherapy or EEG biofeedback), you get a
glimpse of what your brain’s up to — and you discover some tricks to control
it. The therapy is popular for disorders ranging from attention deficit hyper-
activity disorder (ADHD) to substance abuse, and many practitioners offer it
for people with PTSD as well.
192
Part III: Choosing the Right Treatment Approach 

In neurofeedback therapy, electroencephalogram (EEG) leads attached to your
scalp transform your brainwaves into output you can detect with your senses.
For instance, a therapist may show you how to use your “brainpower” to move
an object in a video game, change the pitch of musical tones, or increase a
vibration.
The external changes you cause in neurofeedback are a way of rewarding
your brain for creating brainwaves that can make you feel more calm, alert,
or happy. So in a sense, neurofeedback is actually a behavioral therapy — but
with some added hardware.
Neurofeedback made its initial appearance in the 1970s, and it gained popular-
ity as a PTSD treatment in the 1990s when Eugene Peniston and Paul Kulkosky
tested it as an intervention for combat veterans. The two researchers reported
that neurofeedback was highly effective for both PTSD and alcoholism (a
common problem for people with PTSD). Since then, a number of small studies
have also reported positive findings. However, critics say these studies — as
well as the initial ones by Peniston and Kulkosky — have significant flaws that
make their findings questionable.
Where does that leave us? Case studies clearly show that some people bene-
fit greatly from neurofeedback, but we don’t have any solid stats on its over-
all effectiveness. Two other considerations: It’s not an inexpensive therapy,
193
Chapter 10: Additional Paths to Wellness
The link between sleep apnea and PTSD
Want more evidence of the link between mind
and body? Look no further than that all-impor-
tant thing you do every few seconds of the day
and night: breathing. When you encounter
something that reminds you of your trauma, you
can fall into breathing patterns that trigger
panic attacks (see more on this in Chapter 8).
But disordered nighttime
breathing also
appears to play a big role in PTSD symptoms.
For example, one research team identified 23
people who suffered chronic nightmares
(including 15 with PTSD) and also had obstruc-
tive sleep apnea — a common problem in which
an obstructed airway causes people to stop
breathing for long stretches many times during
the night — or related breathing problems.
Some of these people followed through on
treatments for their breathing disorders, and
others dropped out. Those who finished treat-
ment reported an 85 percent improvement in
nightmares (compared to a worsening in those
who stopped treatment). In the subgroup with
PTSD, people who stayed with therapy for their
sleep breathing disorders reported a whopping
(75 percent) improvement in PTSD symptoms,
while those who stopped therapy got worse.
Bottom line: Talk to your doctor if you have
symptoms of sleep apnea. These can include
loud and prolonged snoring, thrashing during
sleep, and fatigue in the day. Sleep apnea is
very treatable, and getting treatment if you need
it doesn’t just reduce your PTSD — it can lower
your blood pressure and reduce your risk of
heart attack or stroke as well.

but it’s not a particularly risky treatment, either. So you don’t have lots of
guarantees that it’ll help you, but there’s little reason to worry that it’ll hurt
you — other than in the pocketbook.
Transcranial magnetic stimulation
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) sounds like something out of a sci-
ence fiction movie, but it’s a promising therapy for depression — and early
results suggest that it may help people with PTSD as well. (Another term for
this approach is rTMS, which stands for repetitive transcranial magnetic stimu-
lation.) However, TMS is a newcomer on the treatment scene, so therapists
can’t yet tell if it’ll be a useful addition to the toolbox of PTSD treatments.
TMS uses short pulses of magnetic energy, generated by a device placed near
a person’s head, to stimulate cells in specific regions inside the brain. Picture
a shower head held next to your head — only one that delivers magnetic
pulses instead of water! See Figure 10-1. As the magnetic pulses pass through
the brain, they change the patterns of electrical firing between cells in tar-
geted areas, which in turn can reduce depression and anxiety. Sessions last
about 20 to 30 minutes, and patients typically undergo about ten sessions
(although this number varies).
TMS is relatively painless, although some people report headaches or mild
discomfort due to the heat produced by the device. Patients stay awake and
alert during the entire procedure.
A few studies are reporting the effects of TMS on PTSD, and so far the findings
are encouraging. For example, one study reported that ten sessions of high-
frequency rTMS reduced the core PTSD symptoms of avoidance and intrusive
thoughts in patients as well as alleviated anxiety symptoms. And an earlier
study found that TMS treatment temporarily lowered avoidance symptoms,
anxiety, and physical symptoms associated with PTSD.
TMS can’t be used if you have a pacemaker or any other metal implanted in
your body or if you have epilepsy (with one exception). Otherwise it appears
to be pretty safe, although researchers are still investigating two possible
adverse effects:
 Seizures: Seizures occur in rare cases. Fine-tuning the TMS method may
reduce this risk. (Interestingly, TMS is also used as a treatment to reduce
seizures in some people with epilepsy.)
 Manic episodes: In a 2004 study, two patients developed a manic
episode, in which they experienced excess energy and abnormal thought
patterns, after therapy.
Because these side effects are uncommon, most medical practitioners 
consider TMS to be a fairly safe — but not risk-free — procedure.
194
Part III: Choosing the Right Treatment Approach 

Considering Supplementary Therapies:
What’s Best for You?
Experts widely consider CBT to be the first choice for PTSD (see Chapter 8),
but you may want to try an add-on therapy if CBT alone isn’t handling all
your symptoms. If that’s the case, I recommend that you carefully consider
which therapies you participate in: Do you really need, or want, to do more
than one type of therapy? The answer depends on many factors. Here are
some of the most important:
 What your current therapist, if you have one, recommends: Talk to
your therapist about how well other therapies mesh with your current
one. Many therapists practice more than one therapy, and those who
don’t can often refer you to other professionals who offer the supple-
mentary therapy you’d like to try.
 How well your primary therapy is working: If you’re getting fantastic
results with one therapy, you’ve no need to gild the lily by trying to add
more. One exception is relaxation or exercise therapies, which can
nearly always be beneficial as supportive approaches.

Chapter 10: Additional Paths to Wellness

 Whether you can afford more than one therapy: Therapy isn’t cheap,
even if insurance covers some or most of it. Consider your budget,
because adding financial stress to your life may outweigh the benefits of
a second therapy added to your primary one.
 How much time you have: Again, you don’t need extra stress — so
don’t bite off more than you can chew when it comes to therapy.
Dedicating yourself to one therapy may do more for you than spreading
yourself too thin.
If you’re certain you want to try a different type of therapy other than CBT or
medication (or in addition to one or both of them), how do you decide which
therapy to choose? No two people make that decision exactly the same way,
but I recommend considering these points as you read through your options
and try to make a choice:
 How much scientific support each approach has: Initial results are
often misleading, so ponder each approach’s track record in making
your decision. (For info on how to do this, see the sidebar “New
Treatments? You be the judge!” in this chapter.)
 The risk/benefit ratio of each approach: Some approaches (for
instance, relaxation therapies) are very low risk, so you’re not out much
if you try them and they don’t help. Others can be expensive or even a
little dangerous. Weigh each treatment’s benefits and dangers in making
your selection. Remember, however, that even a seemingly safe therapy
can be harmful if it fails to help and thus discourages you.
 Whether the approach speaks to you: Everyone has a unique tempera-
ment and likes and dislikes — and these traits and preferences play a
role in picking the right treatment. As you read through the descriptions
of the different therapies, decide which one best fits your personality and
beliefs. Researchers look at how much a therapy benefits people in general,
but factoring your own preferences into the mix is just as important.
If you decide to try more than one therapy simultaneously, be sure to let all
your therapists know the different approaches you’re using. Better yet, let
them communicate with each other so they can plan a coordinated approach
that works well for you.
Also, if you’re interested in cutting-edge therapies, you can check out clinical
trials of new techniques (or, in some cases, combinations of existing tech-
niques). A good place to start is at the Web site of the National Institute of
Mental Health, www.nimh.nih.gov. (Just click on the clinical trials button at
the top of the page.)

New treatments? You be the judge!
Brand-new treatments for PTSD pop up almost
as often as flowers in the spring, so knowing
what new therapies you’ll be able to choose
from in upcoming years is impossible. That’s
why you ought to get the hang of evaluating
each new therapy that comes down the pike.
That sounds like a difficult task, but some basic
ground rules can help you. The first, of course,
is to ask your doctor for his take on any new
therapy. Next, do your own homework on the
Internet or at the library. Here are some useful
things to find out if you’re trying to decide
whether a new treatment approach is worth
your time, hard work, and money:
 How many people the therapy was tested
on so far: The larger the group, the more
accurate the findings are likely to be. Case
studies involving one or two patients are
often very interesting, but they don’t mean
much in the overall scheme of things. In
general, it takes a half-dozen or more stud-
ies, involving several hundred patients
overall, to get a good idea of a therapy’s
value.
 How long researchers followed the people
treated with the therapy: Many treatments
help for a few weeks, but benefits often
fade over time. See whether anyone’s done
long-term studies to see whether the treat-
ment’s effects are lasting.
 Who’s promoting the therapy: If a report
saying that a new therapy is amazingly
effective comes from a company that makes
money from the treatment, be skeptical. If it
comes from a less-biased source — say, a
university study — then you’re on safer
ground. Also, be suspicious of too-good-to-
be-true claims.
 Downsides that the researchers report:
See whether you can find details on any
negative effects of the therapy.
 Use of a control group: Almost any therapy,
effective or not, shows some results simply
because patients expect to get better.
(That’s the placebo effect.) To show how
useful a treatment really is, researchers
need to compare people getting the therapy
to other people who receive either a differ-
ent treatment or no treatment at all.
 Balanced reports: If you read glowing
reports about a new therapy, search the
Internet and see whether you find not-so-
glowing reports as well. When you read the
opinions of both supporters and critics,
you’ll be in a much better position to judge
the truth.
One good place to get up-to-date info on new
therapies is at PubMed (www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?DB=pu
bmed), where you can find free abstracts of
research papers from thousands of medical
journals. Another good resource is the National
Center for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder
(www.ncptsd.va.gov/ncmain/index.
jsp). This center, which operates under the
auspices of the Department of Veterans Affairs,
offers a wide range of information on the effects
of various treatments.

 Knowing how long your healing and therapy may take
 Staying positive during therapy setbacks
 Switching gears if a therapist doesn’t work out
 Protecting against relapses and handling them if they occur
S
ome life problems are just like a TV-show plot. One minute, you’re fine.
The next minute, a crisis arises. Then magically, in a few days or weeks
(or 30 minutes, if you’re in a TV sitcom), your problem gets solved, and all’s
well again.
PTSD isn’t one of those problems. It doesn’t come with a tidy script to tell
you how long it’ll last, when you’ll feel better, or how much better you’ll feel
as you heal. Because no two people with PTSD have the same symptoms or
the same life histories, no two people make the same progress or heal on the
same schedule.
In this chapter, I look at why recovery is an individual process, explain what
the word recovery means in PTSD, and offer advice on how to recognize your
triumphs and cope with any lingering effects as you heal from your trauma. In
addition, I talk about positive ways to handle a therapy setback, an unpro-
ductive relationship with a therapist, or the occasional relapses that may
occur on your road from victim to survivor to thriver.
Recovery in a Nutshell: What Will 
and Won’t Change
PTSD has no magic cure — no point at which you can declare, “I’ll never have
a symptom again!” Some people’s PTSD symptoms do disappear for good, but
typically, recovery from PTSD is an ongoing journey toward wellness. In this

202
Part IV: Healing and Rebuilding during and after Treatment 
section, I look at what you can expect on this trek and how you can stay com-
mitted by having realistic expectations and keeping your eyes open for the
signposts of healing.
Reaching milestones big and small
How do you know that you’re getting better? Recovery doesn’t happen
overnight — but as weeks, months, and years go by, you’ll experience large
and small victories as your symptoms decrease in intensity, occur less often,
and respond more quickly to your stress-management techniques. 
As you begin your recovery, be patient and keep an eye out for some or all of
these signs:
 You get a better handle on the emotions stemming from your trauma.
You’re increasingly able to face your memories head-on, and you experi-
ence fewer flashbacks or overwhelming feelings. You may find that you
can drive past the scene of your trauma, or see a similar scene on a TV
newscast, without spinning out of control.
 You feel a thawing of once-frozen emotions. You experience more and
more moments of feeling more real and in touch with your feelings — a
sense of true joy when you watch an uplifting movie, for example, or a
surge of love when you hug your child.
 You feel a stronger bond with others. Friendships and romantic ties grad-
ually seem more interesting and enriching and less unpleasant or exhaust-
ing. You find social occasions more rewarding, and you become more
tolerant of the messy problems that are part and parcel of any relationship.
 You experience new optimism about the future. You find yourself once
again making positive plans and setting goals. You may think about
returning to college or applying for a better job, for example. Another
sign of healing: You wake up some mornings looking forward to your day
instead of feeling like you have a 100-pound rock of dread on your chest.
 You encounter fewer problems at work. You find your job less stressful
and more rewarding as you get better at handling work pressures and
relationships with your co-workers.
 You discover that once-overwhelming tasks are easy or even fun. After
months or years of eating fast food or living in a cluttered mess because
cooking or cleaning exhausted you, you find yourself picking up a cook-
book and flagging an interesting recipe — or putting on some house-
cleaning music and dusting with gusto.
 You rediscover the joy of truly relaxing. Instead of being hyperalert
24/7, you begin to experience moments — and sometimes hours or even
days — when you’re truly calm, both physically and mentally.

Viewing recovery as a journey
It’s important to anticipate milestones of healing, recognize them when they
occur, and have faith that more will come with time, even if they don’t happen

Chapter 11: The Journey Back: What to Expect
Different brains, different healing stories
Why does one person with PTSD heal quickly
and completely, whereas another needs more
hard work and patience to get well? One study
found a clue by peeking inside the brain.
Dr. Ruth Lanius of the London Health Sciences
Centre in Ontario, Canada, and her colleagues
used a brain imaging technique called func-
tional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to
explore why people with PTSD often follow dif-
ferent paths to healing. Their volunteers: a hus-
band and wife who developed PTSD after a
multiple-car pileup. The couple spent several
minutes trapped in their car during the ordeal
and witnessed the death of a child in another
car. Eventually, the husband broke the wind-
shield of their own car so they could escape.
After the accident, the husband had flashbacks
and nightmares, grew very upset when he
thought or talked about the accident, and
avoided driving on the highway where it had
happened. The wife avoided news about the
accident, slept badly, had trouble concentrat-
ing, and often became very angry. Her PTSD
severely impaired her ability to work, and she
sold her business.
A few weeks after the accident and before the
couple began therapy, Lanius and her col-
leagues asked the two to undergo magnetic
resonance imaging while they mentally relived
their traumatic event. The researchers also
measured the couple’s heart rates as they
recalled the accident.
The husband’s heart rate skyrocketed, and
stress-related areas of his brain lit up as he
recalled breaking the car windshield and freeing
himself and his wife. By contrast, his wife’s pulse
stayed steady and the stress-related regions of
her brain showed no increases in signal intensity
as she recalled her own experience of feeling
numb and frozen during the accident.
The couple underwent therapy, and six months
later, the husband was free of PTSD symptoms.
The wife still had significant problems, however.
Lanius and her colleagues said the couple’s dif-
ferent brain and heart-rate patterns and their
different rates of healing may support the theory
that emotional numbness — a symptom the
wife but not the husband experienced in this
case — can make the healing process more
challenging.
But is that explanation the only one for this
couple’s different healing pattern? Maybe not.
The husband had a happy childhood and sup-
portive parents, whereas the wife experienced
the loss of her father early in life and never felt
safe with her cold, distant mother. She also had
a history of postpartum depression and mild
panic disorder. These factors could also make
her more vulnerable to developing hard-to-treat
PTSD symptoms.
The message: Don’t expect to heal from PTSD
on exactly the same timetable as someone else,
even if you survived the same traumatic event.
Your brain, body, and history are different, which
means that you’ll heal at your own pace.

right away. But it’s also important to keep your goals realistic so you don’t
expect a miracle and feel disappointed if your gains are more modest. 
To create realistic expectations, keep these facts in mind:
 Healing isn’t an all-or-nothing proposition. You may always have some
symptoms of PTSD, especially if you’re a combat veteran or if you have
complex PTSD stemming from child abuse or other multiple traumatic
experiences. Stay positive by celebrating each sign of progress you see
instead of focusing solely on the symptoms that stick around.
 Healing doesn’t mean forgetting. You’ll still remember what happened
during your trauma, and those memories may make you feel sad or
angry at times. Feelings like those are part of life. Recovery doesn’t
erase those memories; instead, it helps you deal with them in safe and
healthy ways.
 Healing sometimes happens in fits and starts. You may be discouraged
when you feel good one day and bad again the next, but these cycles are
part of the healing process (for more on this subject, see “The Ups and
Downs of Therapy,” later in this chapter).
 Healing happens faster in some areas than in others. You may discover
that you overcome your flashbacks more quickly than you conquer your
relationship problems, or vice versa. That situation is perfectly normal,
so be patient if progress is frustratingly slow in some parts of your life;
it’ll come with time.
 Healing skills take time to master. Remember when you played your
first video game? You probably alternated between making great moves
and falling flat on your fanny until you got the hang of it and made faster
progress. The skills you acquire in therapy take time to gel, too, so you
won’t always be at the top of your game when you start out. Don’t get
discouraged; just keep practicing, and your coping and calming tech-
niques will grow more effective with time.
Outlining the Process: Stages of Healing
Recovery from PTSD isn’t a straight-as-the-crow-flies journey. It’s more like a
mountain road on which you wind around, traveling uphill at some points
and downhill at others, and you can’t always see your destination ahead. At
times, you even seem to be moving away from your target. But take heart,
because the curves and switchbacks are part of your road to recovery. That
road takes unexpected twists and turns, but it gradually leads you through
three stages of healing.
Progress through these stages can take months, years, or even decades —
and not everyone reaches the final stage. But spotting the glimmer of a new
204
Part IV: Healing and Rebuilding during and after Treatment 

stage can give you the hope you need to keep moving on, even when therapy
is challenging. In the following sections, I talk about each stage and describe
how your progress affects your therapy.
As you read through this section, understand that many factors influence
how quickly you heal and how many of your symptoms fade. People with
simple PTSD from a single trauma have good odds of recovering fairly quickly
and getting most or all of their symptoms under control; however, people
with complex PTSD stemming from multiple traumas (for instance, child
abuse or combat experiences) need to be more patient and may continue to
experience some significant symptoms even after treatment. But no matter
what type of PTSD you have, the odds are excellent that therapy will leave
you happier, healthier, and more optimistic about the rest of your life.
The first stage: Victim
When your trauma first occurs, it takes over your life. You have difficulty
functioning in any area of your life. You’re overwhelmed by pain, fear, or
anger. At this point, you may have thoughts like these:
I’m terrified.
My life is destroyed.
I’m broken in ways that will never mend.
My world will never be the same again.
When you’re in this phase, you need immediate help. In fact, therapists some-
times call this stage the emergency stage. Your therapist will focus right away
on supporting you emotionally and handling any immediate health or safety
needs. He’ll also educate you about the effects of trauma and then help you
face your trauma in a way that empowers you to make sense of it. He may
also recommend medications to treat your most pressing symptoms; these
medications may be either a short-term or a long-term part of your treat-
ment. (See Chapters 8, 9, and 10 for descriptions of the roles that different
therapies or medications may play at this stage.)
The beginning is a very intense and emotional time in your therapy. At this
point, it’s especially crucial to be frank and open with your therapist about the
emotions you’re feeling. You may experience both big victories and a great deal
of tumult at this stage as you stare down your trauma and come to terms with it.
The second stage: Survivor
As you face and overcome your worst fears in therapy, you start to put a ter-
rible event in your past and gain control of your life. Your trauma still defines
205
Chapter 11: The Journey Back: What to Expect

your life to a large degree, but now you begin to see yourself as being in con-
trol of your memories — not as a slave to them. In this stage, you may have
feelings like these:
I hate the person who did this to me, but I’m not going to let him ruin my life.
I’m scared, but I’m ready to face driving again.
I’m getting better at dealing with my flashbacks, and I’m not as terrified
when they happen.
In addition, you feel new stirrings of interest in your family, friends, and
future. You still have bad days, but these days are less likely to make you feel
hopeless or helpless.
At this point, you’re growing stronger and more confident about your future.
Thus, you and your therapist can broaden your work to include long-term
goals, such as
 Recognizing and defusing toxic emotions (guilt, shame, fear, and so on)
 Repairing and strengthening your relationships
 Identifying leftover “victim” behaviors and replacing them with healthy
beliefs
 Developing positive coping strategies for dealing with the lingering
effects of your trauma
This phase of your therapy is less intense than the highly emotional work of
confronting your trauma, but it’s also challenging. At times, you may be
tempted to say, “I’m fine now,” and quit therapy, but listen to your therapist’s
advice. People sometimes experience what’s called false recovery. They stop
therapy before they totally process their trauma and master tools for over-
coming it — and a too-hasty departure can increase the chance of a relapse.
It’s okay at this stage if you decide to take a temporary break from therapy,
especially if time commitments or your finances necessitate a pause. But
make a definite plan to return within a few weeks or months, and keep an eye
out for any symptom recurrences that may mean you need to head back into
therapy sooner. Also, look honestly at your motives and make sure you’re
simply taking a break and not running away.
The third stage: Thriver
You’ll never, ever forget your traumatic experience. When you make the suc-
cessful transition from victim to survivor to thriver, however, you no longer
live in the shadow of that event. Your trauma still influences you, but it no
longer controls you, and you recognize its positive lessons as well as its last-
ing scars. You may have feelings like these:
206
Part IV: Healing and Rebuilding during and after Treatment 

It’s time to for me to make new friends, have new experiences, and get back
in the swing of life.
I want to volunteer as a counselor for other women who are recovering from
cancer. I think I can help them because of the lessons I learned myself.
I’m happy with my life and myself.
I’m excited about what may happen tomorrow, or next week, or next year.
At this stage, you no longer need regular therapy sessions, and you’ll probably
be ready to leave the therapy nest altogether (more on that topic in “Graduation
Day: Saying Goodbye When You Achieve Your Therapy Goals,” later in this
chapter). When you do say goodbye to your therapist, recognize that relapses
can happen, and have a plan in hand for coping if they do (see the upcoming
section titled “Spotting storm clouds before the lightning strikes”). With that
security net in place, you’re ready to swing into a sunnier future.
The Therapy Timeframe
Therapy is a major commitment, and it’s natural to want to know how long
that commitment will last. That question is hard to answer — the general rule
about therapy for PTSD is that “it takes as long as it takes” — but here are
some general guidelines.
Typically, cognitive behavioral therapy (see Chapter 8) takes 1 to 12 months.
Other therapies are shorter. Eye-movement desensitization and reprocessing
(EMDR), for example, can take as few as two or three sessions. If your ther-
apy lasts several months, you’ll probably start with once-a-week sessions,
each lasting about an hour (maybe a little longer), and drop down to one or
two sessions per month.
Your therapist can’t set the exact number of therapy sessions you’ll need to
address your PTSD because you’re unique, and so are your needs. Here are
some of the factors that can affect the length of your therapy:
 Substance abuse issues: Do you have a problem with alcohol or drugs?
(See Chapter 7 for more on this subject.) If so, your therapy will be
multi-pronged, possibly involving several therapists and requiring addi-
tional sessions to make sure you’re well-prepared to handle both your
substance abuse problem and your PTSD.
 Difficult life circumstances: Are you undergoing a life crisis, such as a
divorce or illness, that greatly affects your emotional well-being? Or are
you living in an unstable or unsafe environment? If so, you and your
therapist will have many extra issues to address, which translates into
more sessions.
207
Chapter 11: The Journey Back: What to Expect

 Complex PTSD: If you have complex PTSD (see Chapter 2), which typi-
cally stems from multiple traumas or abuse as a child, your treatment
will be more intense and more long-term.
 Coexisting mental disorders: Do you have a psychiatric disorder such
as depression or an eating disorder in addition to your PTSD? If so, your
therapist will probably want to spend extra time with you to make sure
you have an opportunity to address all your issues. (See Chapter 7 for
more on handling coexisting mental disorders.)
The Ups and Downs of Therapy
On Monday, you feel on top of the world. You handle crises at work with ease,
and you feel loving and warm toward your partner. You successfully practice
the relaxation techniques your therapist assigned for homework, and you
have a nightmare-free sleep.
On Thursday, you’re a mess. You have a flashback in the board meeting, dis-
integrate into a giant hissy fit when your partner pushes your buttons, and
spend the night tossing and turning as bad memories take over your dreams.
The next day in therapy, you feel angry at your therapist, and your session
seems to be going nowhere.
What’s going on? You probably feel like you’re right back where you started
before therapy — or even getting worse. You can easily get scared, angry, or
depressed when this situation happens. In reality, however, therapy setbacks
are usually temporary and are often stepping stones to big successes.
When these hitches in the getalong happen, reaching the next breakthrough
may take extra time and effort. You may be tempted to say, “Forget this!” and
give up. But don’t! Minor setbacks during therapy are common, and they
don’t need to stall your progress if you know why they occur and what to do
when they happen.
Spotting the causes of setbacks
Therapy is a little like learning to ride a bicycle. At first it’s scary, and you
wobble a lot (and even have a few tumbles). Then you get your balance, and
you grow more confident — until you hit a rock or a puddle. Then you go
back to wobbling until you regain control. Eventually, you get your skills
down pat, but in the process, you experience a few shakeups.
208
Part IV: Healing and Rebuilding during and after Treatment 

Here are some of the biggest reasons that setbacks may occur during your
therapy:
 An outside event in your life sends you temporarily off track. A fender-
bender or a breakup with a lover, for example, can derail your newfound
sense of being in control of your life. In this case, you may lapse into
your traumatic patterns of thinking (“Something terrible is always going
to happen just when my life starts to go well!”). Thanks to therapy, how-
ever, you’re gaining the tools you need to regain your confidence. This
process may take a few days or even a few weeks, but before long you’ll
start moving forward again.
 An anniversary triggers symptoms. You may experience a temporary
hit when an anniversary of a traumatic event arrives. If so, you and your
therapist can use your reactions to identify and process your feelings.
The result: You’ll be stronger and better able to cope the next time the
anniversary rolls around.
 You’re experiencing a normal part of growth. Sometimes therapists
and patients need to create chaos to bring forth order. If you spent the
past few sessions probing painful wounds and tackling long-held beliefs,
your aroused feelings may take some time to settle into a new and
healthy understanding.
 You’re letting other things interfere with working hard at your therapy.
Sometimes when life gets stressful or busy, it’s easy to let your therapy
homework slide or to skip sessions and slow your progress. Ask yourself
honestly: Are you fully committing to your healing? Are you following
through on your assignments and giving your all in the therapy room? If
not, get back in the game. As coaches are fond of saying, “You gotta give
some to get some.”
 The type of therapy you’re undergoing — or your therapist — isn’t
working out for you. If a setback lasts for a long time (such as a month
or more), perhaps you and your therapist simply aren’t meant for each
other. In that case, see “Setting a New Course If a Therapist Isn’t Working
Out,” later in this chapter. Changing to a new therapist or a new tech-
nique often leads to big breakthroughs.
Although I highly recommend a form of cognitive behavioral therapy
called exposure therapy, in which you fully relive your trauma in a safe
setting (see Chapter 8), some people find this approach too intimidating
and leave therapy. If you find that facing your trauma head-on is too
much to handle, see Chapters 8 and 10 for information on therapies that
don’t require this step. Switching to one of these therapies may get you
back on track to healing.
209
Chapter 11: The Journey Back: What to Expect

Handling your feelings when 
a setback occurs
Setbacks are a normal part of therapy; the solution is not to dwell on them or
magnify them into crises. Instead, think of each setback as a little like a flat
tire or radiator problem on a vacation trip. It may slow you down a bit or
make you take a detour or two, but it won’t stop you from getting where
you’re going.
Here’s what to do if you experience a setback:
1. Try to identify the source.
See the preceding section for some examples.
2. Don’t panic; instead, talk honestly with your therapist about what’s
happening.
If you’re following the normal two-steps-forward-and-one-step-back
progress that therapy often takes, she can reassure you that you’re
doing fine. On the other hand, if you’re truly stalled, she may want to
change tactics and see whether another approach jump-starts your
progress.
3. Renew your commitment.
After a setback, take time to think through all the reasons you want to
heal from PTSD. Also, review the progress you’ve made so far. Keeping
those motivating thoughts fresh in your mind can prevent you from
being stalled if things temporarily go south.
Setting a New Course If a Therapist 
Isn’t Working Out
Successful therapy requires a special chemistry between patient and therapist,
and sometimes, that chemistry just doesn’t happen. Maybe your therapist’s
approach is wrong for you, or maybe you’re just on different wavelengths. If so,
you may want to consider switching to a different therapist.
Before you make that decision, however, answer these questions:
 Did you give the therapist a fair chance? Unless you’re undergoing very
short-term therapy, give your therapist at least three or four sessions to
get to know you and your issues.
210
Part IV: Healing and Rebuilding during and after Treatment 

 Are you using your therapist as a scapegoat? Take an honest look at
the situation, and be sure you’re not using criticism of your therapist as
a way to avoid persisting with the hard work of therapy.
 Is the timing right for a switch? If you change therapists in midstream,
will your insurance cover a sufficient number of sessions for a new ther-
apist to offer real help? A new therapist needs a little time to get in the
groove, so switching therapists shortly before your insurance runs out
probably isn’t a good idea.
If you analyze your answers and decide that switching makes sense, don’t
feel bad about it. Often, the best and nicest of people just don’t click with
each other. Your recovery is far more important than the minor discomfort of
telling your therapist that things aren’t working out.
If you do decide to make a break, call well in advance of your next appoint-
ment (at least four or five days) to cancel and let the therapist know that you
won’t be returning. If the therapist asks to discuss this decision with you, use
your judgment. This discussion isn’t necessary, but it may be a good idea if
you’re on the fence. 
If you do agree to one more meeting, make a written list of the concerns you
have about your current therapy, and go through your list at your meeting.
Whether you decide to stay or go, however, be sure that you feel good about
your decision, and don’t feel pressured by your therapist.
A different situation arises if you feel that your therapist was unprofessional
in any way. If so, you may consider filing a complaint. To do so, contact the
agency that certifies the professional. (For this reason, I highly recommend
selecting a therapist who is certified; see Chapter 6.)
Whatever your reasons for dropping a therapist in midstream, don’t let one
bad experience turn you off. Instead, plan to get right back into treatment
with a new therapist. (After all, you wouldn’t quit driving for the rest of your
life if your first car turned out to be a lemon, would you?) The faster you get
back in the groove, the faster you’ll get your healing under way again.
Graduation Day: Saying Goodbye When
You Achieve Your Therapy Goals
Adieu. Adios. See ya! You know a lot of ways to say goodbye. But how do you
know when the time is right to bid your therapist a fond farewell? In some
cases, the answer is simple. A person with mild PTSD, for example, may feel
211
Chapter 11: The Journey Back: What to Expect

so much better after one or two sessions that he doesn’t need any additional
therapy. On the other hand, a patient with bigger issues may feel the need for
supportive therapy for years after trauma strikes.
How to tell when you’re ready to bid adieu
Often, a therapist is the first person to say, “You’re ready to tackle life on
your own.” Good therapists look forward to this day — but not because they
want to give you the boot. The goal of therapists is to make themselves
expendable, and they’re pleased when their work empowers their patients.
Your therapist can tell that it’s time to bid you a fond farewell, when she see
the following clues:
 You’re able to look clearly and calmly at your trauma.
 You can control your emotions well enough to cope in your daily life.
 You’re able to use relaxation techniques effectively when issues arise.
 You’re mastering the ability to reframe your experiences positively so
you can handle future problems.
 Any problems you have with substance abuse or coexisting mental 
illnesses are stable and under control.
Typically, both you and your therapist will recognize when you’re well
enough to say goodbye to the therapy room. Your insurance coverage also
plays a big role in how much therapy you receive. Your therapist will factor in
your coverage to plan an approach that offers you the biggest benefits in the
time you have.
A chance exists, however, that you and your therapist won’t say, “All done!”
at exactly the same point. If you decide that you’re ready to leave therapy
even though your therapist isn’t bringing the topic up, analyze why you feel
that way. Ask yourself the following questions:
 Are you happy that you’ve achieved your therapy goals? If so, now
may be the time to move on with your life. But listen to your therapist’s
ideas on this topic, because you don’t want to leave unfinished business
that can come back to haunt you. If your therapist thinks you have more
on your plate that needs addressing, the two of you may agree to lighten
your therapy schedule — say, from once a week to twice a month.
 Are you dissatisfied with your progress in therapy? If you feel that
you’re getting nowhere, or you and your therapist are incompatible, you
may be ready to look for a new therapist. (See “Setting a New Course If a
Therapist Isn’t Working Out,” earlier in this chapter.)
212
Part IV: Healing and Rebuilding during and after Treatment 

What to expect when the day arrives
When you’re ready to leave therapy, you don’t need to feel like a boat set
adrift. Your therapist or another professional will always be available if you
have a relapse or if you just want to return for a few sessions to handle an
issue or two. Also, the more you practice your new, positive thoughts and
behaviors, the better you get at them, so you’ll gain more confidence as each
day goes by.
Realize, however, that unlike a sprained ankle or a bout of pneumonia, PTSD
doesn’t just go away. Therapy ends not when you’re magically cured but
when you master the skills you need to stay in control of symptoms when
they arise. Healing is a lifelong process when you have PTSD, and you take
most of that journey after you wave goodbye to your therapist.
Expect to experience both happy and sad feelings as you leave therapy. On
one hand, finishing therapy is a powerful affirmation that you’re in control of
your PTSD symptoms and your life. On the other hand, you may develop a
strong friendship with your therapist and feel sad about losing a relationship
that means a great deal to you. These conflicting emotions are perfectly
normal — and your therapist will experience them, too.
If you have a wonderful relationship with your therapist, it’s nice to let her know
how much you appreciate her. Be aware, however, that she can’t let your rela-
tionship turn into an ongoing personal friendship outside the therapy room,
because that behavior would be unprofessional (especially if you may return for
more sessions someday). So if you say, “Let’s do lunch someday,” and she says,
“I’m so sorry; I can’t,” don’t take it personally. She’s doing the right thing.
Also, talk with your therapist about whether attending a support group after
you leave therapy is a good way to maintain your gains. (See Chapter 4 for more
on this option.) If so, he can help you find a group that’s right for your needs.
Bracing Yourself for Relapses While
Peacefully Moving Along
When you leave therapy, you close a chapter in your life with PTSD, but you
don’t necessarily finish the book. A big key to dealing successfully with PTSD
is realizing that after you think you’ve healed, PTSD can pop up again, either
in bits and pieces or in a full-blown relapse.
The term relapse means that your symptoms are returning in full force or that
you feel like you’re losing control over them. If you’re ready for that possibility
213
Chapter 11: The Journey Back: What to Expect

and prepared to tackle a relapse with confidence instead of fear, you can ride
out a rough patch successfully and get your life back on track in the shortest
possible time.
Of course, you may never feel a twinge of trouble after therapy. But it’s
equally possible that at some point in the future, you’ll spot symptoms creep-
ing back into your life (or in some cases, kicking down the door). In the fol-
lowing sections, I look at factors that can put you at risk for a relapse, how to
spot the red flags that warn you of a relapse, and how to cope if symptoms
pop up again.
Judging your risk for a relapse
Life is unpredictable, and so is your risk of experiencing a relapse of PTSD
symptoms after you give them the boot. But here are some guidelines. You
may be more likely to experience a relapse if you have one or more of these
risk factors:
 You’re recovering from both PTSD and substance abuse. In this case,
you may find yourself sliding back into one or both of these problems.
 You suffered from complex PTSD. People with this form of PTSD, which
stems from repeated traumas (especially early in life), often encounter
some extra potholes on the road to recovery.
 You have a coexisting mental illness.
 You’re living in an unsafe or unsupportive environment.
 You suffer additional traumatic experiences following your therapy.
Conversely, you’re at lower risk for a relapse if you have these protective 
factors:
 You ended your initial therapy only when both you and your therapist
felt confident that you were stable and had a full toolbox of coping skills.
 Your initial therapy included some intensive work on relapse prevention
skills (which is usually part of the therapy package).
 You have strong support from a partner or other family members.
Support groups (such as Alcoholics Anonymous, if you’re battling a
problem with alcohol) can also lower your risk.
 You actively work on improving your physical health. (See Chapter 12
for tips on healthy life habits.)
 You continue to practice the relaxation techniques and positive-thinking
strategies you acquired in therapy.
214
Part IV: Healing and Rebuilding during and after Treatment 

Whether you’re at high or low risk for a relapse, being prepared for the possi-
bility of relapse is smart. Think of this preparation as taking an umbrella
along on a mildly overcast day; you may not need it, but you’ll appreciate it if
the raindrops start to fall.
Preparing yourself . . . just in case
Upsetting life changes are a major risk factor for relapses. Unfortunately, you
can’t go through life sidestepping all the banana peels on the sidewalk. In the
real world, stuff happens: divorces, accidents, job losses, and all the rest. You
can decrease your vulnerability to a relapse, however, by increasing your
confidence in your ability to handle the problems that life sends your way.
When you do, you’re less likely to react catastrophically when a crisis occurs.
In this section, I give you some tools that can help prevent a relapse by helping
you set your expectations in the right place from the start and by making you
feel more confident and in control when something doesn’t go according to plan.
Avoiding the expectation trap
Why do little kids’ birthday parties often descend into chaos and tears? Partly,
the reason is the excitement (and all that sugar!). But even more often, the
birthday boy is completely convinced that everything has to go perfectly on
his big day. When his ice cream cone falls on the floor or the clown shows up
late, he can’t handle this hitch in his plans — and the tears and tantrums
start.
You may think this behavior is childish, but the truth is that adults do it, too.
How often do you think, “This has to happen (or not happen) for me to be
happy or successful”? With PTSD, this mindset is self-defeating because it can
prevent you from facing and overcoming a relapse.
To stay in the right frame of mind during healing, you need to be willing to
manage your expectations. Keep these principles in mind:
 When you count on something and it doesn’t happen, you’re devastated.
 When you expect something and it doesn’t happen, you still feel a sense
of failure or loss but are less distressed.
 When you hope for something while realizing that it may not occur, you
can handle your disappointment with relative ease if life doesn’t follow
your blueprint exactly.
So what do expectations have to do with PTSD?
215
Chapter 11: The Journey Back: What to Expect

If you expect to stay relapse free (or, worse, tell yourself that you must not
experience a relapse), you set yourself up for despair or a sense of failure if a
relapse occurs. That expectation in turn can create even bigger problems.
Conversely, if you hope for the best (a hitch-free recovery) but plan for the
worst (a possible relapse), you’ll be ready for either scenario. As a result, you
can overcome your setback in a shorter time with less emotional fallout.
Acknowledging mistakes and making plans for a brighter future
Everyone occasionally commits acts that are foolish, cruel, hugely embar-
rassing, or all three combined. These acts can make you cringe even years
later when you think about them. If you’re struggling with PTSD, however, the
emotions they stir up can be powerful enough to revive old, self-destructive
thoughts that can start a spiral down into PTSD-think.
You can’t go through life without committing a big mistake now and then.
What you can do, however, is react in a healthy way instead of wallowing in
distress. As I tell my patients, “You can react to failure by blaming others,
making excuses, feeling sorry for yourself, or crawling into a hole and avoid-
ing the world. Or you can use your pain to say to yourself, ‘I won’t let this
happen again,’ and then create a plan to make good on this pledge.”
To follow the latter (and smarter) strategy, first acknowledge that you
messed up. Then use what I call the Never Again Tool, which I detail in the
following list, to plan how you’ll avoid making the same mistake in the future.
When you do, you can quash the negative thoughts that can pull you back
into PTSD and replace them with positive plans, steering you toward a hap-
pier future.
Ask yourself the following questions to analyze the lessons you learned from
your mistake and to make positive plans for the future:
 If I had to handle this situation again, what would I do differently?
 Why would I do things differently?
 How high is my level of commitment to following my new action the next
time? (1 = I won’t do it; 5 = I might do it; 10 = I will do it)
 Who can I ask to hold me accountable to following through on my new
action? (This person should be someone you respect and trust, because
telling him about your plan can give you powerful motivation to follow
through.)
Practicing responses to your biggest worries-come-true
If you ever acted in a play, you probably remember the craziness of rehearsals.
At first, everyone missed his or her cues, and the rehearsal was utter chaos.
216
Part IV: Healing and Rebuilding during and after Treatment 

After a few run-throughs, however, everything fell into place, and on opening
day, you brought down the house.
Rehearsing for life problems can serve the same purpose. When you actively
practice the steps you can take to handle a crisis, you gain confidence in
your ability to cope with anything. As a result, you can spend less time
stressing out over what the fates have in store for you.
The Dress Rehearsal Tool I offer in this section can help you in this process.
To use it, think of four or five problems that you worry about the most —
such as losing your job, getting sick, or breaking up with your partner. Then
ask yourself these questions to figure out what you can do to take charge and
stay in control if any of these problems occur:
 What problem am I most worried about?
 How am I likely to feel if this problem occurs?
 What coping skills do I have to handle these feelings?
 What active steps can I take to deal with this problem if it occurs?
 Have other people I know handled a similar problem successfully? If so,
what can I learn from their example?
 Have I survived a similar problem in the past? If so, what positive steps
did I take to get through the problem?
 Which of my friends or relatives can support me if this problem occurs?
 If this problem occurs, how is it likely to change my life one year or five
years down the road? How can I react positively to those changes?
 Can I take any steps now to reduce the chance that this problem will
occur or to lower my stress about the possibility that it will occur?
As you answer these questions for each potential problem that worries you,
you’ll probably feel your tension drop dramatically. Why? Because you’re
most fearful when you passively dread the future and least fearful when you
walk confidently into it. (That’s why the people who make monster movies
never let you see the monster right away. The images you conjure up in your
mind are almost always scarier than the reality!)
Lowering your anxiety when stress is high
Similar to the Dress Rehearsal Tool (see the preceding section) is the Six-Step
Pause Tool. You can use this tool anytime you’re upset or under stress.
Following these steps can stop you from shooting from the hip when you’re
under stress (and usually shooting yourself in the foot). These steps help you
pause until you’re calmer and can think logically, shoot from your head, and
make the best choices. The result: wiser decisions, less chance that a new
upset or trauma will occur, and lower risk of a relapse.
217
Chapter 11: The Journey Back: What to Expect

Here are six steps to follow when a life problem crops up:
1. Practice physical awareness.
Where do you feel the tension? Pinpoint it (a knot in your stomach, tight
shoulders, and so on) and give the sensation a name.
2. Practice emotional awareness.
Attach an emotion to the physical sensation (for example, “I’m very
angry” or, “I feel afraid”).
3. Practice impulse awareness.
Complete this sentence: “This feeling makes me want to . . .” Fill in the
blank with your immediate emotional reaction (for example, “. . . tell my
boss that he’s a jerk and that I quit”).
4. Practice consequence awareness.
Answer this question: “If I respond this way, what’s likely to happen?”
Think through all the possible consequences.
5. Practice solution awareness.
Complete this sentence: “A better thing to do would be . . .”
6. Practice benefit awareness.
Finish this sentence: “If I try that strategy, the benefits will be . . .” List as
many benefits as possible.
This tool is a highly effective way to talk yourself out of acting impulsively
and doing something you’ll regret.
As a bonus, you can teach this technique to your children to help them gain
better control of their emotions and impulses. Fewer upsets on the kid front
translate into fewer upsets in your own life — another way to avoid a relapse.
Spotting storm clouds before 
the lightning strikes
Even if you do everything possible to keep your recovery on track, a relapse
can occur. If so, you can get the upper hand by spotting the signs of trouble
and taking quick action. Here’s how to spot the warning signs of a relapse:
218
Part IV: Healing and Rebuilding during and after Treatment 

 Your symptoms start to occur more often.
 The intensity of your symptoms increases.
 The techniques you’ve used successfully to control your symptoms
aren’t working anymore.
 If you have substance abuse problems, you begin to lose control of your
drug or alcohol use.
 You experience a return of depressive or suicidal thoughts.
 You begin engaging in self-destructive behaviors, such as excessive gam-
bling or unsafe sex.
If you spot a relapse red flag, make your move quickly! Here’s how to nip a
relapse in the bud:
 Pick up the phone. Call your doctor or therapist for an immediate
appointment — time is of the essence. Getting back into treatment
quickly is the best way to stop a relapse in its tracks.
 Consider medication. Talk to your doctor about trying a drug treatment
(see Chapter 9 for more on this subject) if therapy alone doesn’t get a
relapse under control.
 Redouble your self-help efforts. Eat well, exercise, practice your relax-
ation techniques, and take steps to foster healthy sleep. (For help with
all these steps, see Chapter 12.)
 Call in your backup team. Tell trusted friends and relatives that you’re
experiencing a relapse and let them lend you moral support and a help-
ing hand.
 Avoid catastrophic thinking. Relapses happen, and they’re not the end
of the world. Don’t think of a relapse as a brick wall that stops you cold;
instead, think of it as a patch of rugged terrain you need to cross to get
back on your road to healing.

or a long time, you’ve probably felt like a tree in a terrible thunderstorm:
battered on every side, bowed low by strong gales, and attacked by forces
that threatened to bring you down. Now, just like that same tree when the
storm ends and the skies clear, you’re once again beginning to grow, blossom,
and open yourself up to the joys of the world around you.
As therapy empowers you to put the past behind you and look to a better
future, you’re getting stronger each day — and as you gain more and more
control over your life, you can take a bigger role in healing your body, mind,
and spirit. That role becomes even more important as you reach the end of
your therapy and start the next stage of your journey into wellness.
In this chapter, I talk about the many steps you can take to enhance your heal-
ing both during and after therapy. Among the topics I explore are improving
your physical health, rediscovering intimacy and sexuality, and regaining your
appreciation for the simple joys of daily life.

Regaining Your Physical Health 
and Strength
PTSD takes your body on a rough ride. One reason is that PTSD directly
affects many systems, from your heart to your immune system (see Chapter 3
for more on this). Another reason is that when you’re wracked by anxiety and
can’t picture a happy future, putting good nutrition, exercise, and other
health-enhancing practices on the back burner is easy. Drugs or alcohol 
can take their toll on your physical well-being as well, and nightmares and
insomnia can steal the shut-eye you need to stay healthy.
As you begin taking more control of your life, you can start to undo the
damage PTSD did to your body — and getting back in shape can, in turn,
make it far easier for you to keep the PTSD blues at bay. In fact, each step you
take to improve your physical health can make your mind and spirit stronger
as well. In the following sections, I look at how you can take charge of three of
the most vital areas of your health: diet, exercise, and sleep.
Eating healthy to keep your brain 
and body happy
PTSD can throw a wrench into your dietary habits for several reasons. Here
are some of the biggest ones:
 When you feel awful, finding the energy or enthusiasm to cook for yourself
is hard. As a result, you’re likely to turn to nutrient-poor fast food or TV
dinners.
 Food is a powerful comforter. You may find yourself putting on weight
because you’re turning to ice cream, mashed potatoes, and chips as a
way of numbing your emotions.
 Your body may crave carbs when you’re in the grip of PTSD because
high-carb foods can raise levels of the brain chemical serotonin — and
higher serotonin levels can make you feel happier and less stressed. In
short, you may unconsciously use high-carb foods to self-medicate your
painful emotions.
 Drugs and alcohol can complicate the picture, creating nutritional 
deficiencies that can severely affect your thinking.
222
Part IV: Healing and Rebuilding during and after Treatment 

In the following sections, I explain why establishing healthier diet habits can
aid in healing your brain and body — and why it’s not as hard as it sounds.
Making the food-mind connection
The expression food for thought takes on new meaning when you think about
the connection between food and your brain. Here are some examples of the
food-mind connection:
 Your body needs high-quality raw materials from food to build the 
chemicals that transmit messages via your brain cells and to keep the
cells themselves healthy. A chronic shortage of these dietary building
blocks can put a serious whammy on brain chemistry and function. The
result: fatigue, depression, or even aggressive feelings. Shortages of any
vitamin, mineral, or other nutrient can affect your thoughts and actions
dramatically.
 In the form of glucose, food provides the energy your brain cells need to
work. Too low on this fuel? If so, you may feel tired, depressed, hostile,
or spacey.
Getting your diet in shape
The first step to take when you decide to address dietary glitches is a simple
but powerful one: Offload any guilt you feel about your eating habits. If you
gained weight during your low times or ate in ways that harmed your health,
blame PTSD — not yourself.
The next step is to realize that you don’t need to overhaul your diet drastically
(although you can if you want to). With nutrition, even small positive steps
can give you a big boost as you begin your recovery from PTSD. Here are
some simple ways you can improve your eating habits to get your body and
mind into shape:
 Set the table. If possible, set regular mealtimes and stick closely to them.
If you’ve been eating over the kitchen sink or at the fridge, try setting the
table (and maybe even lighting a candle). Eating regular meals — and
taking the time to savor them — can reduce your stress and set the stage
for better eating habits. Regular eating habits also help you sleep better.
 Put the basics in place. Is your current diet light years from perfect? If so,
try making one positive change at a time. Adding an extra fruit or veggie
each day, or switching from white to whole-grain bread at breakfast, can
supply crucial nutrients. You don’t need to become Captain Health
overnight; just keep moving in the right direction, and each week, try to
eat a little healthier than you did the week before.
223
Chapter 12: Helping Yourself Heal Your Body, Mind, and Soul

 Get the facts about your personal nutrition needs. Talk to your doctor,
dietitian, or other healthcare expert about tailoring your diet to address
specific problems that may be linked to your PTSD. If you’re overcoming
a long-term problem with alcohol, for example, you may have deficiencies
of B vitamins and other nutrients, and you may need extra supplements.
If you’re taking an antidepressant that’s causing you to put on pounds,
talk to your doctor about this common side effect and see whether you
can switch to a different medication.
 Take a good multivitamin-multimineral supplement, and add some
fatty acids. If you chow down on doughnuts for breakfast and takeout
food for dinner, taking a basic supplement is good insurance (and not a
bad idea even if you eat well). Many doctors recommend supplementing
your diet with fish oil, which provides essential omega-3 fatty acids that
tend to be scarce in today’s diet. Omega-3 fatty acids appear to play a
powerful role in brain health and can help your heart as well.
One thing I don’t really recommend, especially when you’re in the middle of
therapy, is starting a fad diet. Typically, fad diets cause you to lose a lot of
weight in the first few weeks but quickly prove unworkable, and you usually
gain back more weight than you lost. Going off the diet (as just about every-
one does) can steer you right back into the “I’m a failure”/”I’m weak” frame of
mind that’s a big trap for people with PTSD.
Instead, if you have a weight problem, simply make gradual changes toward a
healthier diet and increase your exercise (see the next section). Slow-and-
steady weight loss is a far healthier approach than crash dieting, and it’s a
low-stress approach that won’t trigger the negative thoughts you’re trying to
chase out of your life.
Exercising to soothe your nerves 
and relieve tension
Just as PTSD can freeze your emotions, it can freeze you physically. You may
find yourself tensing up for no apparent reason or clenching your jaw or
grinding your teeth — and you may not even realize what you’re doing until
you’re in serious pain at the end of the day. Backaches, headaches, and other
problems related to muscle tension can also make you miserable.
Melting away the tension in your body can ease these problems and make
you feel better physically. Thanks to the powerful mind-body connection,
relaxing your body clears your mind and reins in negative emotions, too. In
this section, I look at the best tools for accomplishing this mission.
224
Part IV: Healing and Rebuilding during and after Treatment 

Reaping the benefits of moving your body
A good workout relaxes tense muscles and generates feel-good chemicals
called endorphins, which calm and soothe you. But these are just two of the
benefits for someone who’s healing from PTSD.
In your case, exercise also offers these bonuses:
 When you’re stressed and that extra adrenaline is flooding your system,
exercise is an outstanding way to turn that fight-or-flight response to
your advantage by burning off your chemical overload in a health-
enhancing workout.
 Exercise can be a wonderful distracter. When your mind is working 
overtime to turn molehills into mountains, a 20-minute workout can
sweep exaggerated worries away and help you put your life back in 
perspective.
 Exercise helps you feel in control of your life and your body — a big plus
when you’re recovering from the feelings of helplessness that PTSD can
generate.
Equally important, exercise offers you these big health benefits:
 It helps counter the elevated risk of heart disease and high blood pressure
that’s associated with PTSD.
 It aids you in getting a handle on a weight problem if your PTSD 
contributed to a problem with overeating.
 It’s good for your brain function and memory.
 It promotes sound sleep.
 It can significantly reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety.
Selecting the right activities for you
You’re much more likely to stick with an exercise program if it’s fun, so pick
an activity you enjoy. Don’t think that exercise needs to be strenuous; a daily
walk or bike ride can ease your stress just as effectively as an hour of lifting
weights.
Exercise is one of the world’s best do-it-yourself approaches for chasing away
the blues and worries, and it works for any lifestyle. Don’t feel like seeing
other people? Then pop a disc into the DVD player and exercise by yourself.
(You can even find free discs or tapes at your library.) Trying to reach out to
new friends? Joining a gym offers a low-stress way to meet new people. Have
health problems that rule out vigorous exercise? Your doctor may approve a
225
Chapter 12: Helping Yourself Heal Your Body, Mind, and Soul

walking program or steer you to a chair exercise program that can improve
your flexibility, strength, and overall fitness. (Chair exercise is a type of work-
out that allows you to exercise all your muscle groups while sitting down.)
Try aiming for 20 to 30 minutes of exercise at least three times a week, and
schedule a regular routine so you’re more likely to stick with this healthy
habit. (See “Following Through on Your Wellness Plans,” later in this chapter,
for more tips on sticking with an exercise plan.)
A few cautions before you start an exercise program:
 If exercise could trigger hyperventilation and panic attacks, talk to your
therapist about breathing exercises and other techniques for preventing
or managing these attacks.
 Get your doctor’s okay before undertaking any strenuous exercise 
program, especially if you have significant health problems.
 Avoid the urge to bite off more than you can chew. If you’re a health nut,
go ahead and train for a marathon. But if you’re in average or iffy shape,
setting unrealistic goals can lead to frustration and trigger negative feel-
ings of failure. Pick an activity that relaxes and de-stresses you, not one
that’s overly challenging.
226
Part IV: Healing and Rebuilding during and after Treatment 
Exercise: Strong medicine for clinical depression
Doctors always knew exercise was good for you,
but now they know that its benefits go far beyond
six-pack abs and a strong heart. Recent studies
show that in terms of mental health, spin cycling
or kickboxing may even beat out drug therapies.
In one study at Duke University, researchers
divided patients with major depression (a problem
that often tags along with PTSD) into two groups.
They treated one group with exercise and the
other with Zoloft (sertraline), an antidepressant
drug. Both groups did equally well, but the people
in the exercise group had better luck keeping their
symptoms from returning after their initial 
depression lifted.
Recently, a different group of researchers at
Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center in
North Carolina did a similar study with depressed
seniors. Again, they found that both exercise and
Zoloft treated depression effectively. What’s more,
the seniors who exercised showed gains in 
physical functioning, so they got an added boost
that the drug group didn’t enjoy.
Exercise doesn’t always affect depression, and
some people experience bigger benefits 
than others. If you’re depressed, the gains you
experience with exercise may depend on how
longstanding your depression is and on whether
it’s mild, moderate, or severe. (Short-term mild or
moderate depression may respond better than
long-term or severe depression.) But just about
everyone enjoys physical benefits from exercise,
so adopting some form of exercise routine has
almost no downside.

Freeing your mind
In Chapter 4, I offer a few of the most basic techniques for relaxing. If you’re
in therapy, you’ve probably mastered additional relaxation techniques. Make
these strategies part of your life outside the therapy room, too — whether
you’re stuck in traffic, upset by an argument with a friend, or just feeling
overwhelmed by the pressures of life.
Giving painful thoughts the boot
If flashbacks and intrusive thoughts continue to intrude in your life, try these
imagery techniques:
 Toss out the trash. Picture your unpleasant thoughts, images, and 
emotions as untidy junk piling up in your house. Now clearly picture
yourself picking up each unwanted piece of trash — a frightening flash-
back, a negative emotion, and so on — and tossing it into a big trash
bag. When you’re done, look around the house. Is all the trash gone? If
so, visualize yourself sealing the trash bag, putting it in the trash can,
and taking the trash can to the curb. Picture the trash truck coming and
carting off all that trash. Watch the truck as it disappears from your life.
Alternatively, visualize putting your negative thoughts and feelings in a
box marked “To handle at therapy” and setting the box out in the
garage.
 Mop up the memory. Picture your intrusive thought, image, or emotion
as a spill on your kitchen countertop. Now visualize yourself getting a
paper towel and mopping up the spot. Picture the spill getting smaller
and smaller until it disappears; then imagine throwing the towel away.
 Shred a sad picture. Write a description or draw a picture of your flash-
back. Then run the paper through a shredder (or toss it in the fireplace).
 Watch your thought fly away. Imagine your troubling thought sitting
next to you; then imagine it sprouting wings and taking flight. Picture the
thought moving farther and farther away, getting smaller and smaller,
until it’s just a speck — and then it vanishes. (Or picture it shooting into
the sky like a rocket, getting smaller and smaller, until it reaches the sun
and goes “poof.”)
These imagery techniques are very potent because they help you remember
that you’re in control of your bad memories. One caution, however: Some
people, particularly those prone to very vivid flashbacks, can find relaxation
techniques that use imagery counterproductive. If imagery techniques trig-
ger flashbacks or emotions instead of calming you, switch to techniques that
don’t use imagery.
227
Chapter 12: Helping Yourself Heal Your Body, Mind, and Soul

Meditating to keep yourself centered and grounded
When you have PTSD and get stressed out, your first urge may be to shoot
from the hip, venting your anger on anyone in your path — an act that creates
more stress, not less. Suppressing your feelings, on the other hand, leads to
burnout, depleted energy, and health problems. (They aren’t called tension
headaches for nothing.)
Instead, try this approach: meditate. Meditation is one of the most powerful
ways to trigger what physician Herbert Benson, a famous pioneer in the field
of mind/body medicine, identified as the relaxation response — a response
that’s opposite to the fight-or-flight response that can send your anxiety 
skyrocketing. In the relaxation response, your heart rate, metabolism, rate 
of breathing, and brain waves all slow down. These changes translate into
dramatic reductions in stress and anxiety, and increased power to handle life
problems calmly and efficiently.
Here’s one meditation technique that can help you achieve the relaxation
response; it’s a tool called mindfulness meditation, which many people with
PTSD find extremely useful (for more on this technique, see the sidebar on
“Turning off the alarm with mindfulness meditation or ‘talk therapy’”). When
your world starts to spin out of control and you sense your fear or anxiety or
anger coming to a boil, stop what you’re doing and sit down, and follow these
steps:
1. Close your eyes and breathe in and out slowly through your nose.
Many people find repetitive activities such as humming or saying a 
particular word to be helpful as well.
2. Quietly take note of the world around you (perhaps note the sound of
the wind outside or the feeling of your body as it relaxes).
3. Let your thoughts and emotions arise naturally without judging them
in any way.
4. Identify and acknowledge your thoughts or feelings as they arise, and
then gently let the thoughts go, bringing your attention back to your
breathing.
For example, if you’re frightened, simply identify and acknowledge the
feeling — “I’m afraid” — and then, just as gently, let the thought go.
Relax and be in the moment, peacefully and nonjudgmentally. As you
achieve this state, you eventually experience something remarkable: the
quiet. (As I tell my patients, it’s located between the noise in your head
and the noise in your life, and right now it’s screaming out to be heard.)
228
Part IV: Healing and Rebuilding during and after Treatment 

Another good relaxation technique that doesn’t use imagery is grounding,
which places you in the here and now. Here’s how to do it:
1. Sit on the sofa or in a comfortable chair.
2. Place your hands on the arms of the chair or on your clothing.
Feel the fabric, noticing its texture and color.
3. Notice the position of your body.
Rub your neck, stretch your fingers, stomp your feet, and tense and
relax your muscles.
4. Notice the sights, sounds, and aromas around you.
5. Slowly name 20 things you can see from where you are.
You may see a window, a door, a cat, and your shoelace, for example.
6. As you continue looking around, tell yourself, “The flashback/emotion
I felt is a part of the past; this is now, and I’m safe.”
229
Chapter 12: Helping Yourself Heal Your Body, Mind, and Soul
A bigwig breathes a sigh of relief
I once asked a high-powered CEO who was
overwhelmed by the pressures in his life to do
the simple quieting exercise I discuss in the sec-
tion “Meditating to keep yourself centered and
grounded.” He stopped his rant about job pres-
sures and relationship problems; he simply sat
with his eyes closed, breathing slowly. After a
few minutes, I saw tears in his eyes. He cried for
five minutes and then slowly opened his eyes
with a smile on his face.
“What was that about?” I asked. He replied that
the sense of peace he’d felt was what he’d been
seeking his whole life — something he’d felt 
slipping further and further away as he frantically
pursued the brass rings of fortune and success.
When he simply exhaled, lowered his defenses,
and opened his mind to the quiet — and to just
letting his emotions be present without enter-
taining them with an internal debate — he found
that elusive peace for the first time.
Just like this CEO, everyone needs to step out 
of the rat race when the pressure gets too
great — even if it’s just for a ten-minute break.
Exhaling is an excellent way to cast off your
stress and find the inner peace that’s so hard
to capture when life is filled with stress. Think
of your exhaling strategy as the little valve on
the pressure cooker of your life with PTSD: It
allows dangerous steam to escape in a safe
way so you won’t blow sky-high.

Part IV: Healing and Rebuilding during and after Treatment 
Turning off the alarm with mindfulness 
meditation or “talk therapy”
New data from a 2007 study by two research
groups helps explain why two different types of
interventions for PTSD — practicing a form of
meditation called mindfulness meditation and
talking about your trauma-related emotions with
a therapist — can make you feel much better.
Matthew Lieberman and his colleagues at UCLA
conducted the first part of the study, which
investigated the effects of verbally identifying
emotions. In this part of the study, they asked 30
people to undergo brain imaging while viewing
images of people showing different facial
expressions. Below each picture were two
words, and the researchers asked the volun-
teers to pick the word that best described the
expression in the picture. In some cases, the
words described emotions such as “angry” and
“fearful.” In other cases, the words were male
or female names; for instance, the words under
one woman’s picture said “Sally” and “Harry.”
Looking at angry or fearful faces activated the
amygdala, a brain region that sends an alarm
when a person perceives a threat. This
response stayed strong when the task involved
picking the correct male or female name for a
photo, but it dropped significantly when people
labeled the photo with an emotion. That task
caused a different part of the brain — the right
ventrolateral prefrontal cortex — to spring into
action. This part of the brain may inhibit emo-
tional responses, allowing a person to think
calmly about a situation.
Lieberman says that when you put feelings into
words — as you do in a therapy session —
“you’re activating this prefrontal region and
seeing a reduced response in the amygdala. In the
same way you hit the brake when you’re driving
when you see a yellow light, when you put feel-
ings into words, you seem to be hitting the brakes
on your emotional responses.”
In part two of the study, David Creswell and his
colleagues (several of them also involved in the
first study) asked the same volunteers to fill out
questionnaires measuring their mindfulness —
the ability to identify and pay attention to
thoughts, emotions, and body sensations without
judging or reacting to them. (This ability is a key
aspect of mindfulness meditation.) Creswell and
his colleagues compared the data on their ques-
tionnaires to the brain-imaging data that
Lieberman collected in part one of the study.
The researchers found that the more mindful
participants were, the more activation they
showed in the right ventrolateral prefrontal
cortex and the less activation they showed in the
amygdala. Creswell says, “This suggests people
who are more mindful bring all sorts of prefrontal
resources to turn down the amygdala. These
findings may help explain the beneficial health
effects of mindfulness meditation, and suggest,
for the first time, an underlying reason why mind-
fulness meditation programs improve mood and
health.”
If you’re overcoming PTSD, these findings are
important because they indicate that combining
treatments like cognitive behavioral therapy
(see Chapter 8) and mindfulness meditation can
add extra horsepower to your healing efforts.

Fostering sleep to refresh your mind
If you’ve lived with PTSD a long time, you’ve likely suffered more than your
share of wide-awake nights or sleep-destroying nightmares. Now that you’re
getting your life back on track, get back into the groove of restful sleep.
Therapy for PTSD often leads to better slumber, and you can increase your
odds of getting a good night’s sleep by trying the suggestions in Chapter 4. 
If you still have problems, talk to your doctor or therapist. Your doctor may
recommend prescription sleep aids (see Chapter 9 for info on the advantages
and disadvantages), and your therapist may have some specific sleep-
enhancing tricks up her sleeve.
Many patients report good results with two nightmare-reducing techniques:
 Image rehearsal therapy: In this therapy, you write down your night-
mares, change their endings, and rehearse these new endings before
bedtime. (For details, see Chapter 4.)
 Lucid dreaming treatment (LDT): This technique teaches you to gain a
degree of control over your dreams while they’re happening. The treat-
ment involves a range of techniques (for instance, dream recall, dream
rehearsal, self-suggestion, and changes in sleeping schedules) that help
you achieve lucidity — that is, the knowledge that you’re dreaming — so
that nightmares have less power over you.
You can practice steps on your own to take control of your dreams. Here are
some ways to defang nightmares:
 Tell someone else about them. For some reason, sharing your dreams
with a trusted person in the daytime takes much of the sting out of
them.
 Walk through your dream mentally in the daytime, and as you reach a
scary or upsetting part, put your hands out in a stop position and say,
“This is just a dream.” Doing this each night before bedtime may
empower you to take the same action when you’re asleep and thus stop
a bad dream in its tracks.
 Write about your nightmare as though it’s a fiction story you’re 
creating — and then change how the story turns out. Try three or four
different plot twists, all with positive endings. This is much the same as
what a therapist asks a patient to do in image rehearsal therapy (which I
discuss in the preceding bulleted list), and you may find that you don’t
need your therapist’s guidance to have success with this method.
231
Chapter 12: Helping Yourself Heal Your Body, Mind, and Soul

 Sit down in a calm moment and ponder your dream. How would you
change the events of the dream if you could? What message would you
give yourself if you could be another character in the dream? By analyzing
the dream rationally and calmly, you can often rewrite its contents in the
future.
Also, remember the body-mind connection and prepare your body during the
day for the sleep it needs at night:
 Eat regular meals; a predictable meal routine helps establish a predictable
sleep pattern.
 Exercise early in the evening at least three hours before you go to bed so
you can burn off stress but still have enough time to wind down.
 Take a soothing bath or shower before going to bed.
In addition, have your doctor rule out any physical causes for your sleep
problems, such as sleep apnea. (See Chapter 10 for more on the link between
this medical problem and PTSD.) Also talk to your doctor if pain from an
injury stemming from your trauma interferes with peaceful sleep.
Simplifying and Organizing Your Life
Do you ever get the urge to yell “Stop!” as your chores and obligations pile up?
The all-too-common scenario always seems to happen at the worst times (or all
the time). Your boss asks, “Can you work overtime?” Your kids say, “We’re late
for soccer!” Your church wants your help with a fundraiser. The dentist’s staff
calls to say you’re overdue for a cleaning. The dog wants a walk. The bills are
overdue. The lawn needs mowing. The floor needs mopping. And somebody
really needs to get to the grocery store before that last roll of toilet paper 
runs out.
When you’re healing, avoid big stressors that can make you feel out of 
control and trigger anxiety or flashbacks. But in the real world, avoiding
stress is often nearly impossible — and even harder if PTSD-linked memory
problems make it hard for you to stay on top of all your responsibilities.
Here’s encouraging news: If you can’t get rid of stress, you can at least tame it.
Start by taking these simple but powerful steps:
 Figure out how to say no. Decide what tasks are necessary and which
aren’t and stop agreeing to every request. Getting a sick child to a
doctor’s appointment is necessary, for example, but baking cookies for
the same child’s school fundraiser isn’t. The world keeps revolving if
you occasionally say, “I’m so sorry. Can I help another time?”
232
Part IV: Healing and Rebuilding during and after Treatment 

 Call for backup. Take a look at your list of obligations and see whether
you can call for reinforcements to help you with them. Is one of your
kids old enough to take over some of the yard work? Can a co-worker
take over some of your overtime work? (See Chapter 13 for advice on
asking for and accepting help when you’re healing from PTSD.)
 Relax your standards. Do you think more highly of a friend just because
she waxes her garage floor or trims her lawn with manicure scissors?
Neither do I. Often, people get stressed out because they hold them-
selves to impossibly high standards for tasks that aren’t really all that
important. If you feel rushed and overwhelmed, ask yourself whether
you can cut corners on yard work, housework, or routine tasks at the
office without creating any problems.
 Think about your long-term goals. As you decide which responsibilities
to keep on your list and which to throw overboard, ask yourself where
you want to be in one year, five years, or ten years. Then ask yourself
whether a specific responsibility (such as agreeing to work overtime at a
job you dislike) will further those goals. Free yourself from dead-end
obligations and focus on the ones that will stand you in good stead over
the long run.
In addition to simplifying your life, implement some strategies to get organized.
If you’re running in all directions, trying to remember dozens of tasks and
coping with PTSD-related memory lapses, you can easily forget important
chores — which in turn can cause the stress monster to rear its ugly head.
(“Oh, my gosh — I forgot to pay the credit card bill!”) To keep an ever-growing
pile of chores under control without losing your cool, try these tricks:
 Go high-tech. Use your computer or cellphone to set up reminders for
daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly chores.
 Go low-tech. Do you have scribbled notes taped all over the house?
Hang up a bulletin board, chalkboard, or whiteboard in a handy central
location (the kitchen is good) and post all your reminders there. If every-
thing’s in a central location, important appointments and chores are less
likely to slip through the cracks. Day planners and organizational tools
can help as well — and if you’re still stressed because things fall
between the cracks, check out Organizing For Dummies (Wiley) by Eileen
Roth and Elizabeth Miles.
If your PTSD-related memory problems make it just about impossible for you
to stay organized and on top of your responsibilities, talk to your doctor.
Certain medications, such as the antidepressant Paxil (paroxetine), appear to
reduce memory impairment in many people with PTSD.

Rediscovering Physical Intimacy 
and Sexuality
Intimacy and sexuality are among the deepest forms of sharing people 
can experience, and physical closeness with a trusted partner is a source of
great pleasure and emotional bonding. But achieving physical and emotional
intimacy can be a struggle if you’re healing from PTSD, especially if your 
previous relationships didn’t survive the strain of your trauma and its after-
math. Sexuality can be an even bigger problem if your trauma involved rape
or sexual abuse, leaving you frightened or disgusted by the idea of physical
intimacy.
If you’re in either of these situations, the road to sexual healing may be long —
but with time and patience, you can enjoy the closeness and joy of a physical
relationship with someone you love.
Identifying your fears about intimacy
The first step in the recovery process is talking openly with your therapist
about your issues with intimacy and sexuality. He can help you understand
that these problems are common in PTSD, as well as help you (and your
partner, if you’re currently in a relationship) reestablish positive, healthy
feelings about your sexuality. Among the fears your therapist can help you
address are
 Fear of losing control: If your trauma occurred at the hands of another
person, it caused you to feel powerless. As a result, accepting the loss of
control that’s a natural part of a sexual relationship is very hard for you.
 Fear of betrayal: Being sexually assaulted by a date or abused by a
parent can leave you feeling that no sexual partner can be trusted.
 Fear of flashbacks: The intense emotions awakened by intimacy and
sexuality can trigger strong emotions or even flashbacks, and you may
avoid physical contact to protect yourself against this possibility.
 Fear of being touched: If your trauma involved rape or sexual abuse, the
touch of another person can physically repulse you.
 Fear of being unguarded: You may keep your guard up because you fear
that letting it down may open the floodgates of pain — both from your
trauma and from a lifetime of holding in your feelings. (This may explain
why people often start to cry when someone is suddenly kind to them
for no reason. It catches them off guard — or rather, without their guard
up — and the relief they experience often feels painful.) But in reality,
this pain is a good kind that comes from healing, not the pain that comes
from being hurt.

Realizing how a therapist may help
Your therapist can help you understand that your fears aren’t weird or crazy.
Instead, they’re your mind’s perfectly normal protective response to the
trauma you experienced. Now that the trauma is over, these feelings no
longer serve a purpose — and with time and patience, you can put them in
the past.
Your therapist can help you address feelings of shame or disgust about your
sexual identity by
 Helping you replace negative thoughts about sex with positive 
affirmations: For instance, your therapist may help you spot the distorted
thought “sex is painful and disgusting” that results from a sexual assault
so you can replace it with accurate thoughts such as “The person who
attacked me caused me pain and did things that disgusted me. That was a
physical attack, not a loving sexual experience. That incident is in the past
now. My current partner is very kind and gentle and can help me experi-
ence sex in a way that won’t be painful. I know that I found sex enjoyable
before I was attacked, and with time, I’ll be able to enjoy it again.”
 Helping you visualize your body as being worthy of respect: People who
experience rape or childhood sexual abuse may view their bodies as dirty
or disgusting or develop a condition called body dysmorphic disorder, in
which they see themselves as physically unattractive or grotesque. If you
have issues like these, your therapist can help you see that these beliefs
stem from the trauma you experienced and don’t reflect reality. With this
guidance, you can view your body as strong, attractive, healthy, and
worthy of your respect and the respect of others.
 Aiding you in developing relaxing and calming tools that can help 
prevent flashbacks during intimacy: Techniques involving slow breath-
ing, imagery, and massage can be especially helpful.
 Empowering you to say either yes or no to a decision about having a
sexual relationship — and to be in control of either decision: This 
control is especially important if you suffered childhood sexual abuse —
a trauma that can create distorted ideas about who controls your body.
Childhood abuse may also cause you to use sex as a weapon or a means
of manipulation, habits that lead to serious relational problems. Your
therapist can help you to identify the roots of these behaviors and to
create healthy boundaries that allow you to have safe and satisfying
sexual relationships.
In addition, if you’re a man, your doctor or therapist can help you address
fears of leaving your partner unsatisfied. If you have these fears, you’re not
alone; erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation are relatively common
235
Chapter 12: Helping Yourself Heal Your Body, Mind, and Soul

in men with PTSD. PTSD itself appears to cause sexual problems for many
men, and antidepressant use and alcohol abuse are also major contributors.
Fortunately, your doctor can offer medications that may correct problems
with sexual performance, and a therapist can help you work on the mental
blocks that can lead to physical problems in bed.
Becoming comfortable with your sexuality
One key to preparing for intimacy is making peace with your body. Make a
point of engaging in activities that can help you get in touch with your sexual-
ity and reduce feelings of numbness or disgust.
Some excellent healing activities include the following:
 Massages: Start slowly, and tell your massage therapist ahead of time 
to stop if you encounter any issues. Gradually increase the amount of
massage you’re able to handle.
 Physical activities that make you feel physical pleasure: In addition to
exercise (which I discuss earlier in this chapter), pleasurable activities
may include ballet and other forms of dance, swimming, or spa days.
 Self-affirmations: Picture a person you love deeply — a partner, a friend,
or a parent. Now picture yourself walking up to that person and saying
something like this: “Wow, you have big hips. It’s just disgusting to look
at you. And your legs are too short. Ick! How can you even go out of the
house looking like that?” Wouldn’t you feel terrible if you said hurtful
things like these? Yet you may give yourself hurtful messages about your
body all the time.
Now’s the time to spot those messages (“I’m fat as a pig,” “I’m ugly and
scrawny”) and replace them with healing and self-affirming messages (“I
love having my grandmother’s hair color,” “My body is beautiful,” or
“This scar is a sign that I’m brave and I came through my ordeal”).
Above all, be patient as you discover how to reexperience the joys of inti-
macy and sexuality. Because we’re all very hung up on our bodies and sexual-
ity, healing in this area of life often takes longer than healing in other areas.
It’s important to go with the flow instead of stressing out and trying to take
steps before you’re ready. In this race, the tortoise almost always wins out
over the hare — no matter what you’ve heard about rabbits and sex!
236
Part IV: Healing and Rebuilding during and after Treatment 

Working with your partner 
to expand your boundaries
Your mind and your body may not reach the point of readiness for intimacy
at the same time. As a therapist who treats individuals who suffered molesta-
tion or rape, I’m convinced that the body has a memory that’s separate from
the mind’s. Your skin remembers both good touch and bad touch, and these
memories can be strong even after your mind comes to terms with a trauma.
Thus, your mind and heart may say yes when your body continues to say 
no — and your body may trap you into thinking that the desperate loneliness
of no touch is better than the horror of bad touch. Getting past this point is
important. Otherwise, you may spend your life missing out on the good
touch that’s so crucial to your healing.
To help your body rediscover the joy of good touch, try some simple but
powerful healing approaches:
 If you’re not ready to touch yet, consider this boundaries exercise: Stand
facing your partner and walk toward her. Keep walking, one step at a
time, until you begin to feel uncomfortable. Stop at that point and note
how you feel. Is your pulse faster? Do you feel a little queasy? Each day,
try this exercise again to see whether you can get a little closer without
feeling scared or trapped. Before the exercise, be sure your partner
knows the importance of remaining still and not moving toward you.
 If you have a loving and caring partner, practice simple, nonsexual
touching. (Think of it as foreplay without the afterplay.) To do this, find a
quiet, peaceful time and simply touch or massage each other gently on a
spot that’s not strongly linked to your sexuality. Do not progress to
sexual intercourse. Instead, merely enjoy the pleasure of simple touch-
ing and the joy of being in each other’s company.
 Close your eyes and have your partner lead you around your house. 
By putting yourself in your partner’s hands in a nonthreatening and non-
sexual situation, you can learn to let go of your fears of intimacy.
When you reach a point where you’re ready for sexual intercourse with a
trusted partner, talk openly with your partner about the flashbacks you may
experience and how to deal with them. It’s important for both of you to realize
that overcoming the aftereffects of your trauma may take time and that you
may experience feelings of disgust that have nothing to do with your partner’s
attractiveness. Both of you should be prepared for the possibility — indeed,
the probability — that your first few times together may be less than stellar
successes. With luck, sensitivity, and a dash of humor, you can overcome your
fears and negative emotions — but be prepared for this process to take
months or even years.
237
Chapter 12: Helping Yourself Heal Your Body, Mind, and Soul

If you don’t currently have a partner and your issues with sexuality are holding
you back from seeking a committed relationship, work with your therapist to
address these issues.
Enjoying Life’s Pleasures
When you have PTSD, you can easily view the world as a menacing place 
full of constant threats, broken promises, and frightening shadows. As you
recover, it’s crucial to reopen your eyes to the joys and wonders of the world
instead of focusing solely on its terrors. Here are some important and possibly
life-changing healing steps to put on your to-do list.
Stop and smell the roses
The famous philosopher Søren Kierkegaard said, “Most men pursue pleasure
with such breathless haste that they hurry past it.” That’s even truer in the
modern era, when people spend so much time rushing from Point A to Point B
that they rarely have a chance to enjoy where they are right now. All that
hurtling around can hurt you if it keeps you focused solely on your stressors —
work deadlines, undone laundry, lawns to mow — and turns your eyes away
from the life-affirming pleasures that surround you (including the smell of
those roses).
If you’re chronically stuck in overdrive, make a resolution to shift gears. Take
full advantage of the healing power of the world around you and work
actively at slowing down in a speed-of-light world.
Here are some good, unhurried activities to try:
 Take a walk every day. Instead of dashing around the block, take the
time to look around. Spot the big wonders — the trees changing color,
the snow on the mountains — and the little wonders, such as a spider
web or a flock of birds. To help yourself appreciate your surroundings,
try picking out five beautiful (or funny, or unusual) things on each walk.
 Bury your nose in a book. Read a novel you’ve always wanted to read.
Don’t read it in haste, snatching a few seconds in the bathroom or at
bedtime to read a page or two. Instead, make a cup of tea, settle into 
a big chair, and just read for an hour or two. (Do you have trouble 
concentrating on a book because of your anxiety? Then try this trick: Set
a timer next to your reading chair and tell yourself, “I can get back to
those anxieties in 30 minutes — but right now, I’m reading.” Often, this
trick can give you temporary control over your stress.)
238
Part IV: Healing and Rebuilding during and after Treatment 

 Put your chef’s hat on. If you’re the family cook, join the “slow food”
craze. Once a week, forgo rushed meals and spend an hour or two
preparing something new and fun. Even if the meal’s just for you, enjoy
treating yourself to a nice meal and all the preparation that goes into it.
If you have leftovers, bring them to work the next day, wrap them for
another single friend, or just save them for a few days’ lunches.
 Make yourself slow down. Set aside a few hours each week for 
mandatory relaxation — time when you don’t allow yourself to work.
These enforced mini-vacations can discharge your stress and recharge
your batteries so you can head back into the fray stronger and more
confident. If possible, find a calming spot — a lake, a park, or a bubble
bath with soothing music — where you can tune out the world.
 Do something creative. People think of painting, gardening, or restoring
old cars as fun, but these activities are also healing — and they require a
focus that can take your mind off the daily grind.
Spread some sunshine
Something I suggest to most of my anxious, depressed PTSD patients is to
smile and say hello to three strangers each day — grocery checkers, bank
tellers, post-office clerks, waiters, and parking valets, for example. You’ll 
often bring a smile to these people’s lips as you lighten their load of stress
(especially if you follow on the heels of a rude or angry customer). In addition,
you can help yourself by cracking the shell of self-involvement that PTSD can
build around you. Putting a smile on a stranger’s face can make you realize
that you care about the people around you, and it makes you feel better about
yourself as well.
Of course, every once in a while you’ll run into someone who greets your
smile with a sullen look or ignores you altogether. If so, don’t take it person-
ally. That person may be dealing with her own life issues. Instead, give a spare
smile to the next stranger you meet.
Try something brand new
PTSD tends to make you reactive — always on guard, ready to defend yourself
against a new threat. When you’re in that frame of mind, you find it easy to
retreat from new experiences and relationships that challenge the status quo.
Now’s the time to reverse that trend, because new people, places, and events
are part of your prescription for putting your trauma behind you and discov-
ering a brighter future.
239
Chapter 12: Helping Yourself Heal Your Body, Mind, and Soul

To find new and positive directions in your life, try these exercises:
 List five new skills you want to master. They can be big skills such as
playing the violin or little skills like playing poker.
 List five places you want to go. Pick places that are realistic given your
current budget. It doesn’t matter whether they’re exotic and far away or
just a few miles from your house.
 List five experiences you want to have. Your list can include things
such as scuba diving, going to a concert, climbing a mountain, owning a
cat, or taking a gourmet cooking class.
Pick any one item in any of these lists and put plans in motion to achieve it.
As you expand your horizons, continue to add items to your wish list of new
adventures and accomplishments. Each new experience you enjoy can
become a healthy memory that helps push the bad ones into the background.
Join in
When people are troubled, they turn inward. They develop tunnel vision and
zero in on their own crises and problems and let the rest of the world fend for
itself. Turning inward is a necessary part of protecting yourself immediately
after a trauma occurs, but it’s unhealthy long term because you’re healthiest
when you’re a loving, caring member of your community.
When you’re well on the way to healing, you’re ready to rejoin that community,
and one of the best ways is by helping others. Reaching out to people in need
benefits you as well, in the following ways:
 It puts your own problems in perspective. As the old saying goes, “I felt
sad because I had no shoes, until I met a man who had no feet.” No
matter what your troubles are, you’re likely to find that other people
have woes that are equally bad or even worse — and that knowledge
can help you value the good things in your life.
 It helps you transform a negative event into a positive force. Many
people find healing by helping other people who are undergoing the same
trauma they experienced or by working to prevent others from suffering
that trauma. For instance, Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) was
founded by Candy Lightner, who lost her own child to a drunk driver.
Many people choose to volunteer for organizations that have some connection
to the type of trauma they experienced (something you should consider only if
you’re sure that it won’t trigger out-of-control memories or emotions). Others
240
Part IV: Healing and Rebuilding during and after Treatment 

pick very different outlets. No matter what form your outreach takes, giving of
yourself can help you discover new meaning and purpose in life.

three let you enter your zip code to find activities near your home.

Harness the power of play
The next time you’re at the park, watch the kids playing ball, the teenagers
rollerblading, the 80-year-olds pondering their next moves in chess, and even
the dogs playing Frisbee. They’re all intensely alive — because nothing is
more mentally, physically, and spiritually awakening than the simple act of
play. Whether you’re a kid or a grownup, play has the power to clear out the
cobwebs, get your creative juices flowing, and give stress the boot. It’s also a
great way to reach out to other people and bring new friends (and possibly
new loves) into your life. The simple act of play can even improve your
memory, ease depression, and — no kidding — make you live longer. You’re
never too young for play, and you’re never too old for it, either.
241
Chapter 12: Helping Yourself Heal Your Body, Mind, and Soul
One family’s road from grieving to helping
Charlotte and Robert Hullinger’s happy lives fell
apart in 1978, when their daughter Lisa’s ex-
boyfriend stalked and killed the 19-year-old
woman. Rocked by their loss, the Hullingers
turned to the only people who understood their
pain: other parents of murdered children.
In 1978, the Hullingers and two other couples
held their first meeting. Talking and crying
together in the Hullingers’ living room, the griev-
ing parents immediately felt a powerful bond.
That simple beginning led the Hullingers to
create a national group, Parents of Murdered
Children (www.pomc.org), which now offers
support and advocacy for thousands of families
trying to come to terms with this terrible trauma.
No family should ever need to endure the pain
that the Hullingers experienced, but the harsh
reality is that many families will suffer the same
unspeakable tragedy. Those who contact
Parents of Murdered Children can find loving,
caring people to help them through their loss —
the powerful legacy of a couple who turned
their own pain into a mission to help others. As
Charlotte Hullinger says, “If life experiences are
not used, they are wasted.”

PTSD can be a grim business, so when you begin healing, you may have to
make a conscious effort to stretch out those rusty “fun” muscles and get used
to kicking up your heels again. To get your groove back, think back to the
time before your trauma and remember the playful activities you enjoyed. If
you loved a pickup basketball game at the gym or a game of bridge with the
neighbors, see whether you can take up these activities again, or look for new
outlets. If you have kids or grandkids, get into the habit of tossing a football
with them or set up a backyard badminton net.
Other avenues for locating playful outlets as well as new friends include the
following:
 Your town’s parks and recreation department
 Local gyms, which often offer a wide range of activities
 Groups offering activities for singles, mothers of preschoolers, and so on
 Your local senior citizens’ center if you meet the age requirements
(many centers offer activities for people as young as 55)
 Local colleges and universities (many schools offer just-for-fun activities,
especially in their adult education catalogs)
Remember, too, that you can play on your own. Put on some salsa music and
do a crazy dance in your own living room — or head outside and play a rous-
ing game of fetch with your dog. Fly a kite, buy yourself a pair of rollerblades
or a new video game, or build a sand castle at the beach. What form of play
you choose doesn’t matter; if it makes you feel like a kid again, it can restore
your mind and spirit.
Following Through on Your 
Wellness Plans
Throughout this chapter, I offer many ways to promote healing. But as a
fellow human being, I know that it’s easier to say, “I’m going to change!” than
to follow through when daily crises distract and frustrate you.
Stay on course with these strategies:
 Be realistic. Set goals you can meet so you don’t add to your PTSD
stresses. Don’t confuse reasonable expectations with realistic 
expectations. Reasonable means “makes sense.” Realistic means “likely
to happen.” It may be reasonable to stop smoking, start a new diet, and
begin exercising, for example, but making all three changes at the same
time may not be realistic. Instead, pick one goal (starting with the 
easiest one may be best) and focus your energy on it.
242
Part IV: Healing and Rebuilding during and after Treatment 

 Set specific goals. Often, picturing how you want to feel — less stressed,
more healthy, more calm — is easier than figuring out the steps you
need to follow to achieve that feeling. To keep yourself on target toward
your wellness goals, create a step-by-step plan to achieve those goals. If
you want to incorporate exercise into your healing plans, figure out what
equipment you need, which gym you want to join, or what times of day
you can fit exercise into your schedule.
 Write down your goals. You write reminders to buy coffee or give the
dog a bath, so write down your wellness goals, too. Outline exactly what
you need to stop doing and what you need to start doing to reach your
goals. Writing down your goals increases your commitment to do them.
 Tell your friends about your plan. Sticking to a commitment is easier
when you tell people whom you like and respect — and whose respect
you value in return — that you’re making a positive change.
 Use the buddy system. Scheduling a weekly visit to the gym with a friend
who’s trying to improve his own health or joining Habitat for Humanity
(www.habitat.org) with a buddy who’s also seeking a soul-renewing
outlet can help both of you stick to your new goals. Joining a support
group can also be a big help in keeping you on track; see Chapter 4 for
info on how to locate groups in your area.
 Don’t let negative people knock you off course. See Chapter 7 for info
on how to keep the emotional vampires in your life from discouraging
you when you set out to improve your health and well-being.
 Give it time! You need somewhere between 21 and 30 days for a new
behavior to become a habit, which means you’ve mentally internalized it
(which is probably why Alcoholics Anonymous gives out 30-day chips
for maintaining sobriety); it takes about 6 months for that habit to
become second nature, which means it’s engrained in your personality.
So stick with your new healing behaviors, and give them time to become
part of the fabric of your life.

In This Chapter

I
f you’re coping with PTSD, you’re fully aware of your hurt and just want to
feel better. You can’t handle the screaming kids, your partner’s complaints
about the bills, your parents’ nagging, or the pressures at work. The night-
mares keep you awake. The flashbacks leave you drenched in sweat. Maybe
you’re struggling every day with a drug or alcohol problem. You’re scared,
you’re angry, and you don’t know how much more you can take. In short,
your life’s not a day at the beach.
But here’s another fact: Life’s no picnic for your loved ones right now, either.
As you probably already know, keeping your family together when you have
PTSD isn’t easy. To have a fighting chance, you have to start by facing facts —
and the fact is, your PTSD is hurting everyone you know. It’s not your fault
that PTSD makes your life so hard, but it is your responsibility to deal with
your symptoms, especially when they affect your family.
In this chapter, I look at how your PTSD can affect your loved ones (with
extra attention to wee ones due to their special needs), why therapy can help
all of you get on the same team, and how you can help your family under-
stand and help you.

Stepping Outside Your World: Common
Feelings Your Loved Ones Face
Just for a minute, think about what life’s like for the people you love. In some
ways, your PTSD is as hard on them as it is on you; for example, your partner
may be overwhelmed by your emotional meltdowns, your parents may feel
deep heartache when they witness your suffering, and your children may feel
tremendous insecurity about their own futures as well as yours. What’s more,
your parents or partner may have taken on the primary job of offering moral,
financial, and practical support, which can be a whole lot to handle.
The good news is that together, you and your loved ones can take many prac-
tical steps to keep your relationship on track. In this chapter, I show you
what you can do to foster a healthy healing environment for yourself and
your family. I also devote a whole chapter (Chapter 16) to guiding your loved
ones and helping them support you through this tough time.
Before you start thinking about a solution to heal your loved ones’ hurt,
though, you need to know just what PTSD is doing to their lives — because
that insight, although painful, can give you empathy for what they’re going
through. It can also motivate you to ease their burden, which in turn can give
them added strength to support you. The end result: Everyone wins.
Here’s how relatives or close friends of people with PTSD often feel:
 Helpless, which may lead to feelings of frustration, depression, or guilt:
Your loved ones care deeply about you, and if they’re knowledgeable
about the reality of PTSD, they sympathize with the pain you feel.
Watching you suffer is hard, especially if they can’t make the problem 
go away.
 Overwhelmed and confused by the emotional rollercoaster ride: As 
you cycle through the heights and depths of PTSD, you take your family
members along for the wild ride. For instance, one day you give your part-
ner a big hug and say, “You’re beautiful” — and the next day, you say
you’re thinking about a divorce. Or you reach out to your parents for help,
only to pull away and say, “Leave me alone — I can handle this myself.” 
Or you scream at your brother about some trivial matter, apologize two
minutes later, and then turn your back on him when he tries to hug you.
These emotional twists and turns leave your loved ones feeling like a
tightrope walker crossing a pit of alligators. As a result, they may be
tense, unsure of themselves, and often angry. They may feel — with
good cause — that they’re sacrificing their own emotional needs just to
keep you on an even keel. (If they are, that effort can eventually spell
bad news for both of you; see the next section to find out why.)
246
Part IV: Healing and Rebuilding during and after Treatment 

 Scared about the future: PTSD hits families in the pocketbook, so your
partner may lie awake nights worrying about how he’ll pay the bills, or
your parents may wonder how long they can chip in on your bills with-
out jeopardizing their retirement. If you have a drug or alcohol problem,
your loved ones may also worry about the risk you’ll get into trouble
with the law.
To complicate matters even more, you likely have trouble planning 
for the future — a common problem for PTSD sufferers. (I talk more
about this problem, called foreshortening, in Chapter 3.) Big problems
arise if you’re thinking, “I doubt I’ll even be alive in ten years,” and your
partner’s struggling with thoughts about how you’ll pay the mortgage,
put money in the IRA, or put your kids through law school.
 Insecure about your love: PTSD can put the chill on your warm-and-
fuzzy feelings for a partner, and she’s likely to respond to this frigid blast
by thinking you don’t love her anymore. You reinforce this fear every
time you turn away from a hug, avoid a kiss, or say, “Not tonight, okay?”
PTSD can also cause your sex drive to plummet and lead your partner to
think, “I’m not attractive anymore.”
Worse, if you’re like many people with PTSD, you do have one foot 
out the door. You’re afraid to commit and too numb to respond to your
partner’s romantic feelings. You love her, but you can’t show it — and
right now, you can’t handle the emotional needs of another person. At
the same time, you expect her to love you, care for you, and be available
sexually when you are in the mood. Unless her hometown is Stepford,
handling this kind of one-sided relationship is tough for a partner.
 Scared about your safety or their own: A far worse situation arises if
you have an out-of-control temper and abuse the people close to you
either physically or emotionally. In this case, loved ones live with the
constant fear of your violence and chronic worries about your future
and their own. That’s especially true for a partner, who may not be sure
which is scarier: a future without you or a future as a punching bag. If
your PTSD leads to depression, or worse yet, to suicidal thoughts, your
loved ones may also be terrified that you’ll hurt yourself.
 Overburdened, which may lead to resentment: If you have PTSD, life is a
hard slog, and even little crises can seem overwhelming. You can all too
easily avoid handling problems or making decisions by making statements
like these:
• “I don’t know how I’ll pay my credit card bill, okay? Just leave 
me alone.”
• “I can’t talk about Jason’s bad grades right now. You handle it.”
• “You know I can’t deal with my sister when she’s upset. You talk 
to her.”
247
Chapter 13: Caring for Your Loved Ones While They Care for You

If you’re married, your PTSD can make your partner feel like your
parent, because she’s the one who needs to make all the big decisions.
(One wife said, “It’s like raising a teenager. He wants me to do every-
thing, and then he complains about being bossed around and second-
guesses my decisions.”) If you’re living with your folks, over time, their
compassion and caring can turn to frustration and even resentment if
they wind up saddled with your responsibilities.
 Guilty for adding more stress to your life: Are you still in denial about
your PTSD? If so, you probably blame other people for your problems
when PTSD is the real culprit. Like a crime-scene detective following the
wrong set of footprints, you may do things like these:
• Accuse your partner of being too clingy when you’re actually too
numbed by PTSD to show him the affection he needs
• Criticize your kids for being too noisy or messy, when your hyper-
vigilance makes you supersensitive
• Complain that your parents are nags, when they have legitimate
concerns about how you’re acting
This blame game works for you in the short run because it lets you avoid
facing your problems head-on. (As they say, “Denial ain’t just a river in
Egypt.”) At the same time, blaming saps your loved ones’ confidence and
makes them feel tremendous guilt when they’re actually innocent
bystanders at an emotional train wreck caused by PTSD.
 Deeply conflicted: This is a variation of guilt that your partner may feel.
If you have PTSD, you can’t run away from it — you’re stuck with it like
Velcro reinforced with superglue, and it follows you around wherever
you go. But your partner or family members aren’t necessarily stuck
with it. In fact, if they were to leave you, they’d leave your PTSD behind
as well. That conflict — feeling loyal to you one moment but at their
wits’ end and on some level, wanting to escape the next — can make
many loved ones feel wracked with guilt and frustration.
Seeing How Secondhand Stress 
Plays Out in Adults
PTSD can have a host of negative effects on your loved ones — and on their
relationship with you. Here are two of the most common ways in which your
PTSD can affect a loved one’s physical and mental health (and can affect 
your healing as well).
248

How stress over your PTSD can affect 
a loved one’s health
The problems I discuss in the preceding section all too often lead the loved
ones of people with PTSD to take it on the chin health-wise for two 
primary reasons:
 They don’t have time to take care of themselves because they’re 
shouldering more than their share of the family’s responsibilities. 
This can be especially true for elderly parents trying to juggle your 
life problems and their own or for a partner trying to raise children
while coping with your symptoms.
 They’re trying to cope with unmanageable stress on too many fronts,
from unpaid bills to emotional upheavals.
Here are some of the most common health-wreckers I see in people coping
with a loved one’s PTSD:
 Excessive drinking or use of prescription, nonprescription, or street
drugs to relieve anxiety
 Overeating or eating disorders
 Neglecting health problems such as diabetes or heart disease
 Giving up exercise because “there’s just no time”
 Seriously lacking sleep (for example, if you wake up screaming from a
terrible nightmare, that shot of adrenaline goes right to the heart of
everyone else in your house as well)
Codependency: How others’ responses 
can affect your healing
One word families often hear in therapy is codependency, which means that a
person reacts to problems in a relationship in a way that enables another
person to keep behaving in unfair or self-destructive ways. Anyone can
develop codependent behaviors, but people coping with a loved one’s PTSD
are at higher-than-normal risk (especially if substance abuse enters the 
picture). Here are some signs of codependency in a partner, parent, or other
loved one:
 She lets you escape responsibility on a regular basis, even if she
knows you’re capable of handling it. Deneesha asks Jamal to mow the
lawn because company’s coming over. He blows his top and says, “Can’t
you see I have enough on my mind right now? I’ll get to it! Quit whining
249
Chapter 13: Caring for Your Loved Ones While They Care for You

all the time!” First, Deneesha has a long cry in the bathroom. Then she
mows the lawn. The next time the lawn needs mowing, she does it with-
out even asking Jamal.
 He covers up for you if you do self-destructive things. Bob comes
home to find his daughter Sarah passed out on the couch and an empty
Scotch bottle on the floor. The paper she desperately needs to finish for
her graduate class is on the computer screen, barely started. Bob’s
angry, but he thinks, “At least she’s majoring in the same field as her old
man — I know this topic, so maybe I can bail her out.” He tosses out the
Scotch bottle, sits down at the keyboard, and starts typing.
 She makes decisions for you. Li comes home from a therapy session to
find his wife Keiko painting the living room green. “I know how hard it is
for you to make decisions right now,” she says, “so I picked the color
myself.”
 He accepts out-of-whack dynamics in your relationship. For example, 
a codependent partner may fall into the role of Mom or Dad — “Do you
really think you should have another beer, Jack?” — instead of expecting
you to take responsibility for your own behavior. Similarly, a parent may
let you slip back into patterns of selfish, irresponsible, or childish
behavior.
Codependency seems like kindness, but it actually barricades the road to
recovery. A codependent partner, parent, or friend keeps you from facing 
reality and acting like an adult, instead letting you slide ever deeper into 
helplessness. In effect, a codependent person sends you the message that
you’re not capable, which is why getting out of this rut is so important for
your own healing as well as for your loved one’s emotional health.
If codependency is the pattern in your relationship, a therapist can help you
turn things around. But change is going to be painful for both you and Captain
Codependent. Your loved one’s used to feeling like a martyr; you’re used to
handing your responsibilities over to her; and changing that setup will rattle
both your cages. But the reward is big: You’ll both come out of the process
stronger, happier, and less burdened by anger and resentment.
Helping Your Loved Ones Help You
No matter how hard PTSD is battering you, sometimes you need to take time
out to care for your loved ones. As much as you need them right now, they’re
still human, and they need love and reassurance, too — especially when
they’re supporting you and aren’t tending to their own needs as much as
they should. You can take plenty of simple steps to ease your loved ones’
path and, indirectly, foster your own healing.
250
Part IV: Healing and Rebuilding during and after Treatment 

As you read through the following sections, you may notice that most of these
steps involve one thing: loving communication. Sure, talking is easy; a 2-year-
old can do it! But talking and communicating are often very different things —
something you’ve probably learned the hard way since PTSD took hold of your
life. The negative thoughts and emotions that PTSD causes may lead you to
utter hurtful or destructive words that fray friendships and strain loving bonds
to the breaking point. As you heal from PTSD, you can begin mending your 
relationships (or keep them healthy and strong if they aren’t broken).
To establish effective habits of communication, you need to break old patterns
of defensiveness and anger and create new patterns in their place. These 
positive patterns can allow you to get your own needs met effectively without
trampling on your loved ones’ emotions. In the following sections, I offer 
positive communication strategies to keep or help make your relationships
strong and mutually supportive.
Bringing your PTSD out into the open
One of the most important things you can do for your loved ones is simply
talk to them. Don’t try to hide your PTSD symptoms; instead, get them out in
the open where you can face them together. If these loved ones include a
partner, open communication about your sexual relationship, your kids, and
your family finances is especially important.
As you talk about your PTSD, here are some healing things you can say:
 Tell your loved one, often, that you appreciate his sympathy and concern.
 Let your loved one know that she’s not to blame for your problems.
 Help the person “exhale” by communicating to him that you understand
what he’s going through. Here’s how:
• During a calm time, say, “You sometimes feel really burdened by
me, don’t you?” Pause and let him respond, even if he just asks,
“Huh?” Then say, “Sometimes, you wish you could run away, or
that I’d go away and never come back. Isn’t that true?” (Don’t say
this accusingly. Instead, make it clear that you understand.) Pause
and give the person time to reply.
• At this point, the person may start to cry as he feels you under-
standing him rather than judging him the way he judges himself. If
so, you can ask, “How bad does it get for you, having to deal with
me?” This question may really cause the tears to pour, after which
you can say, “I’m so sorry that you have to deal with my problems,
and I appreciate your hanging in there with me.”
251
Chapter 13: Caring for Your Loved Ones While They Care for You

• If you’ve touched a nerve, the person is likely to cry for a while.
Then he may lighten up and even give you the first real smile
you’ve seen in a while. He may say something like, “It’s okay. It’s
not your fault. If it happened to me, you’d hang in there, too. That’s
what love’s all about.”
Making efforts to show love 
and responsibility
Actions truly can speak louder than words, so don’t just offer lip service to
your loved ones; put some body language behind it. If you realize that they’re
carrying too heavy a burden, take steps to ease their load. When you do this,
you accomplish three goals: you make their lives a little easier, you encourage
them to offer you support in return, and you get a step closer to taking charge
of your own life again. Here are ways to show your loved ones that you care:
 Do your best to shoulder your household responsibilities. Even if PTSD
makes it impossible for you to handle some parts of your life, pitch in
wherever you can. If your partner takes over the job of earning a living,
for example, reciprocate by doing more of the yard work or laundry. (And
if some jobs are beyond you, explain this clearly and lovingly instead of
just neglecting these chores or becoming defensive when your loved one
mentions them. See the upcoming section titled “Keeping anger in check
and defensiveness at bay” for info on defusing arguments.)
 Show your commitment to seeking help and healing. Ignoring PTSD 
doesn’t make it go away; instead, you can make it even worse. So do every-
one a favor and get in the healing game. If you need therapy, get therapy. If
you have a problem with alcohol or drugs, face up to it and take steps to
deal with it. These steps can reassure your loved ones that you’re actively
working to get your life — and by extension, theirs — back on course.
 If your loved ones don’t know much (or anything) about PTSD, supply
some information and give them time to learn the ropes. Nobody
becomes an expert on this disorder overnight, so forgive them if they
have some misunderstandings. For instance, if your girlfriend doesn’t
understand why you have trouble being intimate right now, show her the
section in Chapter 3 about how PTSD can cause this problem. With time,
most friends and family members go from being clueless about PTSD to
being knowledgeable and supportive.
 Once a day (at least on your good days), focus on your loved ones and
do something nice for them. You don’t have to do something big — just
something that lets them know they count. For example, bring home
your kids’ favorite flavor of ice cream, take your friends out to lunch,
give Mom a bouquet of flowers, or surprise your partner by doing one of
her chores.
252
Part IV: Healing and Rebuilding during and after Treatment 

 If you’re in therapy, ask your therapist for specific ways to improve
your relationship with your loved ones. A therapist can offer ideas 
tailored to your own family dynamics and relationship issues.
Offering your undivided attention 
when it counts
Everyone in your life competes for time, but nobody should need to compete
for importance. Nothing makes an important person in your life feel more
unimportant than hearing something like this: “Yeah, that’s interesting, dear.
Just a sec — I need to get this call. . . . Okay, hold that thought while I take
this laundry upstairs. And could you call Bobby for dinner? . . . Now, what
were you saying?”
Making time for the important people in your life isn’t always easy, especially
when the minutes are ticking by and your to-do list is long. Making time is even
harder when you have PTSD and extra worries and stresses are pulling you in
different directions. But remember: The amount of time you offer a person is
less important than the quality of that time. Remember, too, that if you make an
active effort to tune in to your family’s and friends’ needs — something that
doesn’t always come naturally when you have PTSD — you improve the
chances that they’ll return the favor by tuning in to your needs.
To show another person that he’s important, let go of other thoughts and 
concerns when he’s talking and focus your attention totally on him — even if
just for a few minutes. I like to use the model of the guy at the beach in Venice,
California, who juggles chainsaws. He knows how to focus on one saw while
the others are flying, which is why he still has all his fingers! Keep the same
focus when you’re talking to someone you care about, and you’ll strengthen
bonds with your family and friends.
Letting loved ones express themselves
Right now, your loved ones have a lot of intense thoughts and feelings about
what PTSD is doing to both your life and theirs. Letting them share these 
pent-up feelings can clear the air like a summer shower, and it can defuse the
tension that can get in the way of your healing. Here are some good communi-
cation strategies to help you accomplish this goal.
Really listen
Does this situation sound familiar? A loved one says, “We need to talk,” and you
instantly throw up your defensive shields. Right off the bat, you start thinking
of a killer retort or plan an escape route so you can avoid the conversation
altogether.
253
Chapter 13: Caring for Your Loved Ones While They Care for You

Instead, try this revolutionary approach: Simply listen.
Wilfred Bion, one of the greatest psychoanalysts of the past century, said,
“The purest form of listening is to listen without memory or desire.” Simply
put, that means to clear your mind, open your heart, and hear what another
person is saying — without thinking, “Jeez, here she goes again,” “I don’t
want to hear this,” or anything else. Just . . . listen.
True, you may not like what you hear. But when you break down your
defenses and hear the words coming straight from another person’s heart,
you often discover two remarkable things:
 The other person’s anger or frustration often drops instantly, simply
because you’re hearing him for the first time.
 Addressing the other person’s concerns is easier when you’re not all
tied up in knots trying to deny or deflect them.
Talk with your loved one — not over, at, or to her!
Often, people forget that communication is a dialogue, not a monologue.
Here’s an example: Bob’s wife says, “I know Uncle Charlie drives you crazy,
but I’d really like to invite him over to . . .” Bob can respond in many ways:
 By talking over her. Before she gets the rest of the sentence out, he
says, “Forget it. The guy’s a jackass. No way am I going to his house ever
again, and I don’t want him here, either. By the way, have you seen my
tennis racket? I’m going to the gym.”
 By talking at her. He lets her finish her sentence but then goes right
into high-school debate-class mode and outlines the ten reasons going
to see Uncle Charlie is a bad idea. Then he heads out for his tennis
game.
 By talking to her. This time, he says, “I know you like Uncle Charlie, but
I don’t. So let’s just skip it. Thanks,” and grabs his tennis racket.
 By talking with her. In this case, Bob says, “Let’s sit down and talk
about it. I really don’t like how Uncle Charlie makes me feel. He always
brings up how my business went under, and that bothers me. But help
me understand why you’d really like to see him, and let’s see if we can
work out a solution that works for both of us.”
Clearly, the last strategy is the best. Communication is a two-way street, not a
one-way avenue. Say your piece, but leave the door open for discussion.
Cutting off another person’s communication is a hard habit to break, especially
if the other person typically lets you get away with it because of your PTSD.
Realize that your loved one has an equal stake in the outcome of your 
communication, and that she may have info that changes your outlook.
254

Give your loved one permission to say the unspoken
PTSD can leave your loved ones with a toxic legacy of unvoiced hurts, invisible
scars, and hidden anger. Sunlight is the best disinfectant for these hidden
wounds — but be prepared, because it can sting.
If you’re feeling strong and you’re in a good place in your healing, here are
some questions to ask to start a cleansing conversation that can wash away
many of the secret aches in a loved one’s heart:
 “Have I ever made you feel that you weren’t worth listening to?”
 “Have I ever made you feel that I don’t admire and respect you?”
 “What was the hardest part about living with me when I was at my
worst?”
When your loved one answers these questions, do your best to listen without
becoming angry or defensive. By simple hearing her out, you can defuse her
negative emotions and allow positive ones to take root in their place.
These questions are hard to ask, and the answers aren’t easy to hear. But the
conversations you start with these simple words have astonishing healing
power, both for you and for the loved one who’s stood by you through the
worst of the storm. In fact, they may be the most powerful relationship-saving
questions of all time, whether you have PTSD or not.
Accentuating the positive
Therapists who work with severely troubled kids have a saying: “Find a good
behavior — any good behavior — and reward it.” This rule is great in any
relationship. People tend to take positive behavior for granted and to notice
only the bad stuff, and when you ignore good behavior, you get less of it.
You’ll strengthen your relationships with other people — especially kids — if
you keep your eyes open for good deeds and acknowledge them in words. If
you and your teenager spend most of your time arguing about her nose rings
or creepy boyfriends, for example, catch her off guard by saying things like, “I
like the way you treat your little sister. Not everyone would have that much
patience” or, “Thanks for taking Grandpa his groceries. I know you’re busy, and
it was a big deal for you to volunteer.”
Also, if you do need to criticize someone, see whether you can start with a
positive remark. If your son’s garage band is too much for your PTSD-frayed
nerves, don’t say, “Knock off the noise now!” Instead, try saying, “You know,
you guys are really pretty good. I like those bass licks you’re experimenting
with. But tell you what — the noise is pretty rough on my nerves, and I think
we need to cut down on your practice hours a little.” You’ll still hear some
whining, but it’ll be mixed with pleasure at your praise.
255
Chapter 13: Caring for Your Loved Ones While They Care for You

Keeping anger in check and 
defensiveness at bay
Even the happiest, most stable relationships have their bad moments. Right
now, there’s a good chance that your relationships aren’t all peaches and cream,
so there’s also a good chance that hot words will start to fly on a regular basis.
Losing your temper occasionally isn’t necessarily a bad thing, because a little
honest anger can clear the air. But if you’re recovering from PTSD, you need
to control your anger for two very good reasons:
 Your loved ones are your strongest allies in your recovery, and they
can’t help you if you alienate them.
 PTSD can cause your anger to spiral out of control, harming both you
and the ones you love. (For more on this topic, see Chapter 14.)
For both of these reasons, you should learn strategies for putting the kibosh
on your angry outbursts and defusing rather than escalating the arguments
that pop up in any relationship. The next section offers some of the best
strategies for accomplishing those goals.
If you recognize that you have trouble keeping your temper under control and
you’re still in therapy, ask your therapist to work with you on this problem.
This topic is also a good one to bring up if you participate in a support group
for PTSD or substance abuse issues.
If your anger makes you physically violent or verbally aggressive to the point
that you regularly frighten people, recognize this behavior as an emergency
and seek professional help.
Here are additional ways to keep your temper under control:
General anger-management techniques
If your anger isn’t dangerous but is upsetting the people you love and straining
the bonds of your friendships, the communication skills I describe throughout
this chapter can help you simmer down when things heat up.
 Pause before you act. The Six-Step Pause, which I describe in Chapter
11, is both a tool for preventing relapses and a highly effective anger-
control technique.
 Leave the scene. Time-out isn’t just a good strategy for kids; it’s also
helpful for an adult who needs a little cooling-down time. Simply say, “I
need to take a walk, and then we’ll talk about this.” Or excuse yourself
and go to the bathroom so you can get a handle on your temper.
256
Part IV: Healing and Rebuilding during and after Treatment 

 Practice your reactions. If you can predict an event that’s likely to make
you angry — such as your teenager’s staying out too late and then giving
you lip — walk through this event mentally, and figure out
• How you’d respond if you were to let your anger take control 
of you
• How you’d respond if you were to react firmly but calmly
By trying out each scenario, you can prepare yourself to make the right
choice if the situation actually arises.
 Get plenty of exercise. Opt for the kind that wears you out and works
off the excess adrenaline that PTSD can create. (See Chapter 12 for more
on the benefits of exercise when you’re recovering from PTSD.)
Count to three — seriously
I know: “Count to three” sounds like something your kindergarten teacher
used to say. But guess what — she was right!
When you feel like you’re under attack, your first urge is to fire back instantly,
particularly if you have PTSD, because this disorder keeps your anger level
set on max. But here’s a better idea:
1. Think of the first thing you want to say, and don’t say it.
2. Think of the second thing you want to say, and don’t say that, either.
3. Think of the third thing you want to say, and this time, say it.
Why go with the third comment that crosses your mind? The first thing you
want to say is about defending yourself. The second thing is about retaliating.
But the third thing is about finding a solution. Start with #3 first, and you’ll
often put the brakes on an argument that otherwise could turn vicious.
Imagine how the other person feels
You’re across the room from each other, arms gesturing, fur flying, tempers
flaring. You’re both saying hurtful things, and you’re both spiraling out 
of control. How can you stop this train from barreling down the tracks to 
disaster? The answer is surprisingly simple. Try this three-step strategy:
1. Stop talking.
2. Admit that you and your partner (or parent, or friend) have a problem.
3. Ask yourself, “What’s it like for the other person right now?”
When you make this switch in perspective, you discover that it defuses your
own anger. What’s more, you can defuse the other person’s anger as well
simply by following through with a comment like this: “I realized that I don’t
257
Chapter 13: Caring for Your Loved Ones While They Care for You

like what we’re saying to each other, and I realized that you don’t like what’s
happening, either. Why don’t we start over again and figure out a way we can
work together to solve this issue?”
Nine times out of ten, you can turn a nasty argument into a positive conversa-
tion when you try this approach. If the other person doesn’t respond positively
and continues to ramp up the argument, try the next approach.
Look at yourself through the other person’s eyes
Here’s a powerful exercise that can help you prevent an angry outburst. The
exercise is based on the fact that you can’t feel anger and empathy at the same
time. Here’s why:
 Anger is a motor response (from you to the world) in which you lash out
at someone who hurts or disappoints you.
 Empathy is a sensory function (from the world to you) in which you
emotionally understand and experience another person’s feelings.
Like matter and antimatter, anger and empathy can’t exist in the same place
simultaneously. As a result, if you open the window to empathy, anger flies
out. Here’s how to do this exercise:
1. Think of someone close to you.
For purposes of this exercise, call him Bob.
2. Visualize something Bob does that frustrates, angers, hurts, or disap-
points you.
3. Score your anger about this behavior on a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is
“not at all” and 10 is “I want to punch him right in the nose.”
4. Now imagine what Bob would say if someone were to ask him what
frustrates, angers, hurts, or frustrates him most about you.
This step is uncomfortable because you need to be honest about the
negative things you do. You might picture Bob saying, “He doesn’t
listen,” or, “He doesn’t do what he says he’s going to do.”
5. Imagine what incident Bob would bring up if someone were to ask
him to describe something hurtful that you did to him.
Unless you’re a saint, some uncomfortable memories are likely to come
to mind.
6. Pause and feel the emotions that Bob probably experienced as a
result of your hurtful actions.
7. On a scale of 1 to 10, rate how frustrated, angry, or hurt you are now
about Bob’s behavior in Step 2.
258
Part IV: Healing and Rebuilding during and after Treatment 

After you trade places with Bob and look at your relationship through his
eyes, your upset should go down in intensity. As a result, you’re far more
likely to forgive him the next time he hurts or frustrates you — and far 
less likely to head straight into a temper tantrum.
Repeat the message you’re hearing
Often, a person who’s upset is angry because he thinks you’re not really hear-
ing what he’s saying. He may be right if you’re too busy parrying his arguments
or venting your own anger to really pay attention to him.
The next time this situation arises, take a deep breath and resist the urge 
to fight back. Instead, listen to what the other person is saying. Then
rephrase it and say it back to him — not in a snide or sarcastic way but
gently and caringly.
Suppose, for example, that your father says, “Sometimes I think you’re a selfish
jerk, and you don’t give a @#$% about me or your mother!” Your urge may be to
say something like, “Why should I? You don’t give a @#$% about me, either.”
And you’re off to the races.
Instead, try saying something like this: “It’s important for me to know why
you’re feeling so bad. You’re saying that you think I’ve been behaving selfishly
and that I act like I don’t care about you or Mom.” If he agrees, you can say
something like, “Do you really believe that I don’t care about you?” or, “Can
you tell me what I did that made you feel that way?”
Saying these things calmly is tough, especially if you’re still in PTSD mode
and your emotions are on a hair trigger. But if you can short-circuit your
attack reflex, you can stop a spat in its tracks. The big payoff: You’ll prevent a
big fight that could send you spiraling back down into PTSD mode, and you’ll
strengthen your relationship with someone you need to have on your side.
Use “I” messages
“I” messages focus on how you feel, not on another person’s faults. Often, a
simple change in perspective can mean the difference between a nasty argu-
ment and a thoughtful discussion. For example, compare these two statements:
Version 1: “You stomp around here, screaming and yelling like some kind
of lunatic, and you expect the kids and me to respect you?”
Version 2: “When you lose your temper, the children and I feel like it’s
not safe for us to be here. We want to support you, but your anger is
frightening for all of us.”
Notice the difference? Version 1 is just about guaranteed to generate a hostile
reply. Version 2, however, allows you to express your feelings without putting
the blame on the other person. It also gives him deeper insight into your feel-
ings, increasing the odds that he’ll listen to what you’re saying.
259
Chapter 13: Caring for Your Loved Ones While They Care for You

Find common ground
No matter how unfair another person’s anger seems, you’ll probably spot 
a grain of truth in her complaints if you’re willing to listen. If you find even a
single point of agreement and can start from there, you can often nip a poten-
tially stressful confrontation in the bud. Consider these two scenarios:
Scenario 1:
Your partner: “We never talk anymore. I might as well be invisible. It’s
like you and the TV live in this house, and I’m not even here. I think I
made a big mistake when I moved in with you.”
You: “If you think I’m such a jerk, why don’t you move out?”
Scenario 2:
Your partner: “We never talk anymore. I might as well be invisible. It’s like
you and the TV live in this house, and I’m not even here. I think I made a
big mistake when I moved in with you.”
You: “I can see why you’re unhappy with me. I’ve been pretty much glued
to the TV during the playoffs, haven’t I? That wasn’t fair to you, and I’ll
try to do better. But are you really sorry you moved in with me? I know
I’m not perfect, but I’m really happy you’re here, and I thought you were
happy, too.”
Scenario 2 is clearly smarter because by agreeing on a single key point, you pave
the way for discussing other issues in a sane and constructive way. Often, you’ll
also stop the other person from blowing a minor problem out of proportion —
something that can easily happen if a loved one who’s stressed out from dealing
with your PTSD symptoms doesn’t get some acknowledgment of her issues.
Communicating your needs and 
accepting help when you need it
One thing that quickly goes out the window when PTSD flies in is honest,
heart-to-heart conversation. As a result, many important things — both good
and bad — go unsaid, especially when you’re in the depths of your suffering.
Now’s the time to reopen the lines of communication and to start sharing
your thoughts and feelings with your loved ones.
That’s especially true when it comes to getting your own needs met. You may
hesitate to talk openly and honestly about these needs for several reasons.
Here are some of these reasons and why they’re misguided:
260
Part IV: Healing and Rebuilding during and after Treatment 

 You equate asking for help with weakness. Often, people with PTSD —
especially if they’re veterans, police officers, firefighters, or rescue 
workers — feel uncomfortable admitting that they need help. That’s
because they’re used to giving help rather than receiving it, and the 
role reversal is hard to accept.
If you feel that way, here’s an illustration to help you put things in 
perspective: Picture a rescue worker rushing up to help two people
trapped under a burning car. The first person says, “Thank you!” and
cooperates fully, allowing herself to be rescued quickly and safely — 
situation handled. But the second person forces the rescue worker into a
long, dangerous argument by saying, “No thanks, I’m just hunky-dory —
leave me here, and I’ll be fine. Really!” Clearly, this person is way off-base,
and he’s complicating everyone’s life — just as you are, if you refuse to
let your loved ones help you overcome PTSD. Like the rescue worker in
my story, your friends and family know full well there’s a problem, and
they want to help — so let them!
 You don’t want to be a burden. You may think that by keeping your suf-
fering to yourself, you’re protecting your loved ones and shielding them
from your misery. If so, you’re wrong. That’s because your loved ones feel
your pain even if you try to hide it — and in addition, they feel terrible
frustration because they want to help and you won’t let them.
 You’re hamstrung by guilt. The toxic effects of post-traumatic guilt can
make you feel like you don’t deserve to call on family or friends to help
you when you’re hurting, because somehow you “deserve” the pain
you’re experiencing.
If that’s the case, read Chapter 8 for info on getting rid of guilt — and if
you’re in therapy, discuss this issue with your therapist. Misguided guilt
can poison your family’s life as well as your own, so don’t let it stand in
the way of seeking and accepting help
 You can’t stand the idea of losing your independence. If this is your
hang-up, you think that asking for help reduces your control over your
life. In reality, however, getting help in battling PTSD will speed your
healing — and the faster you heal, the faster you can handle all aspects
of your life on your own again. In other words, asking for help makes you
more independent in the long run.
 You’re angry about needing help. Many things you used to do easily
are now hard or impossible, and you’re furious about that — and right-
fully so. However, this anger creates a double burden for your loved
ones. One woman, for example, talked in an Internet group about her
husband’s anger when she took over driving their son to ball games —
even though he couldn’t face being in the car after his accident. Putting
your loved ones in this kind of losing situation makes much less sense
than facing reality, acknowledging that right now you can’t do every-
thing on your own, and graciously accepting a hand.
261
Chapter 13: Caring for Your Loved Ones While They Care for You

One good way to enlist your loved ones in your healing is to make a written
list of the things you need help with. For example, you may need financial
help, moral support, transportation to therapy sessions, or simply a quiet
place to relax or do your therapy homework. After you identify your needs,
approach your most supportive friends and family members and ask for their
assistance.
When you ask your loved ones for help, be open and honest about your
symptoms and how they affect your life. If your loved ones aren’t knowledge-
able about PTSD, be sure to offer them some basic info so they can better
understand what you’re going through and how they can help.
Seeking Outside Help through 
Family Therapy
Not all families need professional therapy when they’re dealing with PTSD. 
If you’re in therapy yourself and your symptoms are under control to the
point that your family life is usually calm and happy, don’t fix it if it ain’t
broke. If the cracks in your family are starting to look like earthquake fault
lines, however, you need to call for outside help.
In the following sections, I focus largely on the most common scenario: family
therapy involving a partner and possibly children. But family therapy can
involve anyone who’s close to you — not just a partner or child but also a
parent, brother or sister, or grandparent — so feel free to be flexible in defining
“family.” In the next sections, I offer some clues about when to seek therapy for
the whole gang (or at least some of it) and what therapy options you have.
Deciding whether your family 
would benefit
In just about any family — not just one that’s coping with PTSD — spouses
sometimes get annoyed, children argue and whine, and teenagers seethe and
act weird. Those occurrences are everyday events, and you can’t always tell
when emotions cross the line from normal to problematic. So how do you
decide whether your flock can benefit from professional help? Here are clues
that everyone (not just you) may need therapy:
 Major blowups occur in your household on a regular basis — once a
week or even more often.
 Your family members sneak around like quiet little church mice, afraid to
ask you about anything.
262
Part IV: Healing and Rebuilding during and after Treatment 

 Your partner is talking about leaving you, even if he’s just making 
vague threats.
 Your partner (or a parent, if you’re living with Mom or Dad) is exhausted
and says she can’t handle your problems anymore.
 Your child is exhibiting dangerous behavior, such as driving under the
influence, hanging around with a bad crowd, taking drugs, or failing 
in school.
 You think your partner or your child is developing an eating disorder.
 Anyone in the family is suffering from depression or may be suicidal.
 Anyone in the family has alcohol or drug problems.
 You’re going through a rough patch in therapy, and you want your family
to understand why you’re not as supportive as usual.
If nothing in this list applies to you but you still have a gut feeling that therapy
can help your family, go for it if your tribe is willing. If they’re reluctant, see
whether you can get them to commit to a single session. A good therapist 
may be able to use that session to help them see why continuing with family
therapy is a good idea.
Understanding what family therapy 
is all about
Family therapy is a specific type of therapy in which a therapist helps your
family members, both separately and as a group, understand your PTSD and
the different roles they can play in helping you overcome it. The therapist
also tells you how you can help your family.
Some people fear that if family members talk to the same therapist, the tales
they tell in confidence will become front-page news for the entire family. But
that’s not how family therapy works. Instead, therapists typically see each
family member individually and then ask each person if it’s okay to talk about
certain topics as a group. If everyone agrees, the whole family can put those
issues on the table for joint discussion. If not, secrets stay secret.
So don’t worry that your daughter will find out what you really think of her
purple hair and her boyfriend’s tattoo. On a more serious note, don’t worry
that your husband will find out that you’re unsure of your feelings for him or
that your son will discover that you’re disappointed in his lifestyle. Confiden-
tiality is the lodestone of therapy, and telling tales without permission is
strictly forbidden.
263
Chapter 13: Caring for Your Loved Ones While They Care for You

Helping everyone benefit from therapy
Family therapy is a great option for teens and older preteens, but younger
children may benefit more from other approaches, such as art or play therapy.
These approaches allow a sensitive therapist to find out what’s troubling a
young child and to work out solutions.
The label family therapist is used somewhat loosely. See Chapter 6 for tips on
finding a therapist who’s truly qualified to help a family dealing with PTSD.
Combining family therapy and CBT
Family therapy is excellent, but it may not be the right choice as your primary
therapy. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which I discuss in depth in
Chapter 8, is considered to be the gold standard for treating the person who
has PTSD, whereas family therapy has a less-stellar track record as a front-line
treatment (see Chapter 6). Thus, it may make sense for you to have a CBT
therapist and for your family as a whole — including you — to see a family
therapist separately.
You may find it helpful to complete trauma-based CBT therapy (see Chapter 8)
before the rest of your family enters therapy. CBT can reduce your symptoms
to the point where you can focus more on your family’s needs and less on your
own problems.
Knowing your options
A professional therapist may suit your family to a tee. But if professional
therapy is too expensive, not covered by your insurance, or not available in
your area, here are some other options. (For more ideas, see Chapter 6.)
 Families who are religious often find pastoral counseling (provided by a
minister or other religiously oriented counselor) to be useful. A benefit
of pastoral counseling is that it’s often free or inexpensive.
 If you’re a military veteran, your family may be able to receive 
counseling at one of the many Vet Centers across the country. In this
case, professional therapy is available free of charge. For info on what’s
available in your area, go to www.va.gov.
 If neither of the preceding two options works out for you, consider 
steering your family to online support groups where they can vent their
frustrations, talk with other families battling PTSD, and even have some
stress-relieving laughs. These groups can be appropriate for older teens
as well as for partners. Chapter 16 lists several of these discussion
forums.
264
Part IV: Healing and Rebuilding during and after Treatment 

Be extremely careful if your child participates in one of these groups.
Preteens shouldn’t be involved in unsupervised chats at all, and 
adolescents need to know the dangers of online wolves posing as
friendly, sympathetic sheep.
Little People, Big Hurt: How PTSD
Affects Your Children
If you have kids, right now they’re both the lights of your life and arrows
through your heart. You love them more than life itself — but most likely, you
spend too much time yelling at them, and they spend too much time yelling
at you (or hiding from you).
No matter how mature they are, kids can’t fully grasp how PTSD changes
your life. As a result, there’s a limit to how much you can expect them to
understand about your troubles. But here’s the good news: If you try hard to
understand what they’re going through, they’re likely to cut you some slack in
return. So just for a minute, put yourself in their shoes.
Understanding what your 
children may be feeling
Your kids care about your pain (even if they don’t always show it), but they
also may be feeling plenty of their own. Here are some of the emotions kids
can feel when they live with a parent with PTSD:
 “I’m sad. I want my house to be happy like my friends’ homes, but every-
one here is angry or upset all the time.”
 “I’m scared. What if Mom leaves us? What if we can’t pay the bills? What
if things get really out of control?”
 “It’s my fault. I made too much noise, and it set Dad off. Now Mom is
crying, and I’m to blame.”
 “I’m angry. Being a kid is supposed to be fun. Instead, I have to be the
parent while the person who’s supposed to take care of me acts like a
baby. It’s not fair.”
 “I’m trapped. There’s nowhere I can go till I’m older, so I have to live in
this mess.”
 “I’m jealous. My friend’s dad coaches his baseball team and takes him
fishing. My dad just sits in his chair and drinks.”
265
Chapter 13: Caring for Your Loved Ones While They Care for You

 “I’m embarrassed. My mom does weird things when my friends come
over, and I think they’re laughing behind my back. Last week one of my
friends turned on the news, and my mom started crying. I wanted to
crawl in a big hole and die.”
Identifying unhealthy behavior
The feelings PTSD stirs up can make you act in some strange ways. The same
is true for your kids, who have their own boatload of big emotions as a result
of living with your PTSD. No two kids are alike, but children often fall into one
of three unhealthy patterns when a parent has PTSD:
 The perfectionist: This kid simply seems too good to be true. He excels
at school, never raises his voice around the house, and spends his time
trying to keep everyone else happy. What’s wrong with this picture? This
kid really is too good to be true. Underneath, he’s scared that if he
makes a single wrong move, his family will fall apart. He’s afraid to feel,
afraid to question, and too scared to ask for help. Worse, he thinks it’s
his job to “rescue” you — an impossible task for a child.
 The scapegoat: Everybody in the family blames this child for their 
problems to deflect attention away from the real problem. (“Of course
your dad is angry! He wouldn’t yell if Cheryl didn’t set him off. Did you see
the note from her teacher?”) This child acts out because the pressures in
her house make her angry and upset — and then she gets blamed for 
causing those pressures.
266
Part IV: Healing and Rebuilding during and after Treatment 
Hand-me-down PTSD
Can your PTSD rub off on your children? Studies
of Holocaust survivors suggest that their children
may be more vulnerable to developing PTSD.
Other studies hint that this may also be true for
children of traumatized combat veterans.
Scientists are investigating the idea that PTSD
can affect multiple generations. Here’s what
they suspect happens:
 If a parent’s trauma is a huge problem but the
family treats it like the proverbial elephant in
the room (“Don’t ever mention that again,
Bobby. We don’t talk about it”), a child may
become terribly anxious about this taboo
incident and about keeping it hidden. This
anxiety may make him vulnerable to PTSD.
 Conversely, a child exposed to all the gory
details of a trauma may take in more than
she can handle and be traumatized herself.
Either theory worries parents because they’re
afraid of either saying too little or saying too
much. The best approach is to give your child
basic info about your PTSD and its causes but
not keep rubbing it in his face. Also, skip the
most frightening details.
Another excellent way to prevent intergenera-
tional PTSD is to make sure your trauma isn’t the
sole focus of your family’s life. Invest time and
effort in creating fun family activities and traditions
to offset family problems.

 The copycat: This type of child is so affected by a parent’s PTSD symp-
toms that he begins exhibiting similar symptoms himself. (Doctors call
this behavior overidentifying.) Some children even develop full-blown
PTSD; see the nearby sidebar “Hand-me-down PTSD” for more info.
If your child falls into any of these patterns — too good, too bad, or too much
like you when it comes to PTSD symptoms — recognize that she needs help.
Here again, a therapist can provide your child a safe place where she can
express her fears and anger and learn to deal with them in a positive way.
Reaching out to help your children
Knowing that your children have negative feelings about your PTSD and its
effects on your family can upset you, especially when you know that many of
your symptoms are out of your control and that you’re doing your best. 
The good news is that you can soothe some of your children’s concerns and
heal the rifts between you. Here’s how:
 Find a therapist who knows how to help kids who are dealing with a
parent’s PTSD. As you interview potential therapists, ask them about their
specific experience in treating children coping with this issue. Also, check
with your family pediatrician to see whether she can offer good leads.
 Talk about what’s going on with you in simple terms that a child can
understand. Say something like this: “Remember how you fell off your
bike and didn’t want to get on it for a week? Something really bad 
happened to me a long time ago, but it didn’t involve a bike. Instead, it
involved a bad man who hurt me. He’s in jail now, so he can’t hurt us —
but I still get scared when I drive by the place where he used to work.
My therapist is helping me learn to get over being afraid, just like you
got over being afraid to ride your bike.” It’s especially important to
explain symptoms that can terrify a child, such as a parent’s nightmares
or violent startle responses.
 If you have specific triggers that your child should know about, give 
him this info, which may help him understand why a siren or a TV news-
cast sets you off and what to do if this happens. For example, you may
say, “I know you were worried when I started shaking when I saw you
watching the car race on TV. When I see cars going fast, it reminds me of
my accident and makes me feel all shaky. You don’t need to feel bad
about watching that show, because my symptoms aren’t your fault — it’s
part of my PTSD, and I’m working on getting it under control. If you see
me getting upset by something on TV in the future, here’s a good idea:
You can help me by reminding me to practice the relaxation techniques
my therapist taught me.”
267
Chapter 13: Caring for Your Loved Ones While They Care for You

 Tell your child that it’s okay to express her feelings — both positive and
negative. Then do your best to avoid getting defensive if she takes this
advice, because she probably will. If she says, “You’re never there for
me,” don’t respond, “Hey, I’m busy, and I can’t handle everything.”
Instead, say, “I’m really sorry that I didn’t make it to your soccer game. I
was feeling really overwhelmed and couldn’t go, and I know that it really
hurt you when I didn’t see you make that goal.” (See “Bringing your
PTSD out into the open,” earlier in this chapter, for the exhale approach,
which can work wonders with kids as well as adults.)
 Let your child know that your PTSD isn’t his fault. Tell him, “Sometimes I
get mad if you drop something. The chemicals in my body make me over-
react to loud noises. It’s not your fault, and I’m very sorry it happens.”
 Make sure your child knows that solving your problems is your job —
not hers. But let her find age-appropriate ways to help if she can. For
example, maybe she can help feed the pets on nights when you’re worn
down by your struggles with PTSD.
 Tell your child often that you love him. Your love may seem obvious to
you, but it’s probably not obvious to your child.
 Create a soothing environment. If you can, give your child her own room
and fix it up with a good study area so she has a haven where she can
hide out when things are tense. Also, make sure she has recreational
outlets, such as a new pair of rollerblades or a good supply of books. 
(A teen may appreciate exercise tapes, which can keep her in shape and
help burn off stress at the same time.) If you sense tension rising, try
putting on some soothing or perky music.
 Another gift you can give your child is simply to let him escape once in a
while. If he likes summer camps, see whether you can afford to send him
to one — or if he loves his Grandma, see if he can sleep over at her
house once a month. Getting away can help a child decompress and gain
a little perspective on the situation.
If you have the opposite problem — that is, if your child doesn’t see
enough of you because of a divorce or separation from your partner —
make a point of getting together with her regularly. Even if you’re in a
bad spot and you feel like you’re just going through the motions, your
child needs to know that you’re there and that you care.

Chapter 14
Getting Your Life Back on Track
In This Chapter
 Identifying your life goals
 Strengthening relationships and healing emotional wounds
 Contemplating career and financial issues
 Spotting the silver linings in the cloud of PTSD
W
hile you’re living in the shadows of PTSD, you often have trouble
coping minute-by-minute. But as you step into a better future, you
can start thinking ahead — to next week, next month, or even next year and
beyond.
In this chapter, I help you answer the $64,000 question: “Where do I go from
here?” To start, I offer tips on analyzing your current life situation and charting
a course for the future. I also share ideas on asking forgiveness from the people
PTSD made you hurt, strengthening your ties with the loved ones who stood
by you, and handling anger issues that can damage relationships. In addition, I
look at whether it’s time for you to go back to work (and what financial options
you have if you can’t). Last but not least, I talk about adding joy and meaning to
your life by recognizing what you’ve gained in your struggle to overcome PTSD.
Taking Stock of Your Life
As You Enter the Future
For a long time, you went in any direction that PTSD pushed you, and as
a result, you probably took some wrong turns. As you heal, PTSD has less
power to steer your life in bad directions, and you have more power to steer
it in good ones. But life doesn’t come with a built-in GPS unit. So how do you
know which way to head?

That question is tough to answer, especially if PTSD caused you to put your
future on hold for a long time. To help you get back on track, here are two
handy self-help tools. The first helps you evaluate your goals in life, and the
second helps you reflect on the past to identify the people and situations you
want to play more — or less — of a role in your future.
Lookin’ on down the road
Before PTSD struck, you had hopes, dreams, and goals. At this point, you may
feel adrift because you’ve focused so intently on healing from the past that
you put your plans for the future on the back burner. Now that you’re ready
to head into that future, the following activity can aid you in
 Identifying your most important life goals
 Identifying specific goals that PTSD thwarted and getting them back on
track
 Recognizing the steps you need to take to accomplish those goals
 Overcoming any negative PTSD-think that could hold you back from
achieving your goals
Set aside some quiet time for this exercise because these questions aren’t the
kind you can answer on the fly. Also, don’t worry if you’re not sure exactly
what direction you want your life to follow. PTSD knocked you off track, and
getting your bearings again can take time. Think of this exercise not as a cast-
in-stone life plan but as a free-form tool to get you thinking about your future
direction. The exercise has no right or wrong answers — it’s just food for
thought. Answer the following questions:
 What do I feel is my purpose in life?
 What am I passionate about doing?
 What are my strengths, gifts, and talents?
 What limitations do I realistically need to factor into my life plans?
 Are my life goals different now from what they were before I developed
PTSD? If so, am I happy with this change, or did I get sidetracked from
goals I still want to pursue?
 Do I feel fulfilled doing what I’m doing now, or am I ready for a change?
 Do I have specific goals for the next year? For the next five years? For
the next ten years?
 What steps can I take to accomplish these goals?
270
Part IV: Healing and Rebuilding during and after Treatment 

 What fears may hold me back from reaching these goals?
 What coping skills can I use to keep these fears from interfering with my
progress toward my goals?
 What obstacles stand in the way of my achieving these goals, and what
specific steps can I take to overcome those obstacles?
These answers can help set your feet on the right path to achieve your goals
and dreams. If your answers suggest that you can benefit from additional
guidance, here are some good books that can help:
 Life Coaching For Dummies (Wiley) by Jeni Mumford
 Zen and the Art of Making a Living: A Practical Guide to Creative Career
Design, by Laurence G. Boldt (Penguin)
 And — if you don’t mind my blowing my own horn! — Get Out of Your Own
Way: Overcoming Self-Defeating Behavior by Mark Goulston and Philip
Goldberg and Get Out of Your Own Way at Work . . . And Help Others Do
the Same by Mark Goulston (both books published by Perigee).
Revisiting the path you’ve traveled
PTSD makes you view the past as an enemy to overcome, but instead, you
can see it as a friend and a guide to the future. The following exercise helps
you use your past experiences to recognize which aspects of life you want to
embrace as you move forward and which ones you want to leave behind.
Here are the steps:
1. Look at your calendar or schedule for the past six months.
If you don’t have one, ask someone in your family to help you recall vari-
ous events you experienced during that time, as well as people who
influenced your life during that time.
2. Mark the positives.
Without thinking deeply about your responses, put a blue plus sign (+)
next to the people, events, and meetings in the past six months that you
enjoyed and that left you feeling energized and wanting more afterward.
3. Mark the negatives.
Now put a red minus sign (–) next to the people, events, and meetings
that you didn’t like or enjoy — the ones that knocked the energy out of
you and maybe even put you out of commission for the rest of the day.
271
Chapter 14: Getting Your Life Back on Track

Make a distinction between reactions influenced by your PTSD and reac-
tions not related to PTSD so that you don’t rule out a potentially positive
person or event just because your symptoms got in the way of your
enjoyment.
As you look at your plus and minus marks, you become more aware of which
people and situations you like and which ones you dislike. This awareness
can help you keep positive activities and people in your life — and give
negative ones a nudge out the door.
Healing Relationships That PTSD Frayed
As an old Portuguese proverb says, “Friends are the flowers in the garden of
life.” But when PTSD has you in its grip, you can all too easily crush those
flowers into the dirt by seeming aloof, uncaring, angry, or self-destructive.
While you’re healing is a perfect time to repair broken ties with any people
you wounded emotionally during your struggles with PTSD. In addition, it’s a
good moment to strengthen your bonds with the people who stood by you
through thick and thin, even when PTSD prevented you from giving your fair
share in a relationship. In this section, I offer advice on how to accomplish
both of these goals.
Repairing damaged friendships
Did you ever disappoint, injure, or even betray someone because of your
PTSD? If so, you may fear that you’ve burned your bridges. However, with
some hard work and luck, you can repair broken bonds and possibly even
make your relationships stronger than they were before PTSD struck.
To repair a damaged relationship, you need to address the four h’s you may
have triggered in the other person:
 Hurt: Hurt can result from any thoughtless or cruel acts you committed
when PTSD had you in its grip.
 Hate: This emotion is powerful but also normal when you violate a
person’s trust or sense of safety.
 Hesitation to trust: The person fears that you’ll cause him more pain if
he lets you back into his life.
 Holding onto a grudge: Resentment is another defensive wall a person
uses to avoid lowering her guard and being wounded again.
272
Part IV: Healing and Rebuilding during and after Treatment 

That list is pretty daunting. But here’s the happy news: You can overcome all
these obstacles if the person you’re asking to forgive you is willing to open
the door even a tiny crack. To set things right, you need to practice what I
call the four r’s:
 Remorse: You need to show your friend or loved one that you know you
damaged your relationship and that you’re truly sorry.
Here’s how Margery approached her former best friend: “Peggy, your
friendship is so important to me, but I acted like you didn’t matter at all.
When I didn’t even come to your mother’s funeral, I know I hurt you
badly. I’m so sorry. Now that I’m getting my PTSD under control, I can be
a much better friend to you.”
 Restitution: Payback time is here because you need to make amends for
the damage that your PTSD caused you to do. If you hurt your mom by
missing the past five family get-togethers because social pressures trig-
gered your PTSD symptoms, make amends now by asking whether you
can treat her to a spa day or even a mini-vacation with you.
 Rehabilitation: Actions really do speak louder than words, so let your
friend or loved one see that you’re working hard to change your behav-
ior. If you hurt someone as a result of an alcohol problem stemming from
your PTSD, join Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar group — and don’t
miss meetings.
 Requesting forgiveness: Don’t expect your friend or loved one to forgive
you immediately. Instead, practice the first three r’s for a minimum of six
months. Then go to the person and ask, “Are you able to forgive me for
hurting you?” With luck, your good track record will prove to him that
you’re worthy of a second chance.
Not every person you’ve hurt will forgive you. The people who hang onto
their grudges may say some cold or hurtful things, and you need to be pre-
pared for this reaction. But even if you get the cold shoulder, you’ll find that
making the effort to repair your relationship causes you to feel far better
about yourself. (Also, unforgiving people aren’t the best of friends when
you’re mending from PTSD and are still vulnerable to self-doubt or self-blame.
You’re probably better off without them in the long run — even if your part-
ing reopens some wounds.)
You can’t always restart a relationship on the same footing, of course. People
change, and that goes for your loved ones as well as you. But even if your 
ex-spouse remarried and you can’t get together again, or if differing interests
are taking you and a once-close friend on different paths, you can defuse toxic
anger and replace it with warmth and respect. When people are willing to hear
your message and say, “I forgive you,” you empower them to go from being
angry to trusting, liking, or even loving you again, and that’s a wonderful
feeling.
273
Chapter 14: Getting Your Life Back on Track

Creating healthy relationship dynamics
PTSD can run roughshod over your relationships with the most important
people in your life: a partner, parents, children, other relatives, and friends.
While you’re healing, you can work on making your relationships strong and
mutually beneficial once again. One good way is by brushing up on your posi-
tive communication skills. You can find some specific advice in Chapter 13 on
strengthening ties and communication with a life partner or child. And here’s
an additional way to get your relationships back on track as you heal: Make
sure that they’re in balance.
Understanding how PTSD tips the scales
The term quid pro quo is Latin for something for something, which is what a
good relationship should be: a pact in which you give of yourself and gain
something valuable in return from the other person (love, loyalty, support,
caring, and so on). That balance of give-and-take often gets out of whack
when you have PTSD — and here’s why:
 PTSD can cause you to withdraw and feel out of touch with others, so
you can’t give them the emotional support they need.
274
Part IV: Healing and Rebuilding during and after Treatment 
Say, “I forgive you” — to yourself!
When you make a list of everyone you’d like to
forgive you, put one name at the top of the list:
your own.
Consider the results of a 2007 study by Dr. Mark
Leary and his colleagues at Duke and Wake
Forest universities. The researchers reported in
the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology
that self-compassion — that is, the ability to be
kind to yourself, which can include forgiving
yourself for perceived mistakes — plays a cen-
tral role in healing after a negative experience.
Leary and his colleagues reported that
 People with high levels of self-compassion
reacted less negatively to real, remem-
bered, or imagined bad events.
 Self-compassion enabled people to take
responsibility for any part they played in a
negative event while controlling their bad
feelings about it.
 Self-compassion helped neutralize the
effects of poor self-esteem. In this study,
people with low self-esteem who were able
to treat themselves kindly fared as well as
people with high self-esteem after an
unpleasant life event occurred.
 Self-compassionate people are less at the
mercy of negative life events than self-
scolders are because they respond kindly
to themselves whether their lives go well or
hit a rough spot.
The moral: Instead of kicking yourself when
you’re down, treat yourself with the same kind-
ness that you try to show others. You’ll be
rewarded by reduced risk of a PTSD relapse —
as well as by the happier face you see in the
mirror.

 PTSD can cause physical aches and pains, depression, and fatigue, all
of which can cut down on the practical help you’re able to offer your
loved ones.
 PTSD can make you a ticking time bomb, meaning that loved ones can’t
count on you for emotional support.
 PTSD often takes a bite out of your budget, especially if you can’t work,
so loved ones can’t count on you for financial help.
 PTSD can make it hard to care about yourself or your future, or to go to
the effort of asking people to respect your needs. As a result, other
people — even those who love you — may fall into the pattern of
neglecting your needs.
 PTSD can anger the people who love you, making them withdraw the
emotional support that’s crucial for your healing.
Assessing the dynamics of your relationships
Spotting the ways in which PTSD threw your relationships out of whack can
help you restore the balance. The simple tool in this section, called the Self-
Other Inventory, can help you take a critical look at what you’re giving and
getting in each important relationship in your life — in particular, with your
partner, mother, father, child(ren), sibling(s), and friend(s). This tool helps
you be more precise about what you expect from others and about what you
need to be willing to give in return. Here’s how it works.
As you think about each person you’re close to, consider whether you mutu-
ally share each type of support that follows:
 Practical assistance: Making a genuine effort to help
 Emotional support: Listening with empathy
 Psychological support: Taking other people’s needs and desires seriously
 Financial support: Being willing to help in a real time of need
 Prompt help: Keeping promises and meeting important deadlines
Here are some of the not-so-healthy relationship patterns this list can help
you identify:
 The others-can’t-count-on-me pattern: Do you see an area in which your
loved one can’t depend on you for help or support? If so, your PTSD may
have created behavior patterns that prevent you from pulling your
weight in a relationship.
If you spot this problem, take active steps to remedy it. For instance, if
your answers indicate that your partner can’t count on you for practical
assistance or prompt help, offer to take over two or three of his chores —
and make sure you do these jobs on time, without any reminders.
275
Chapter 14: Getting Your Life Back on Track

 The I-can’t-count-on-others pattern: Do your answers indicate that you
can’t turn to the people you love and say, “I need help?” If so, PTSD
probably deflated your self-esteem and led you to think that you’re not
worthy of asking other people for assistance. In the long run, this pat-
tern can leave you feeling used and can deprive you of the support you
need to keep your healing on course.
Change this pattern by being open about your own needs and by asking
your friends and family members for help when you need it. If your part-
ner tends to ignore you when you talk about your problems, don’t just
sigh inwardly and walk away. Instead, say, “Can we sit down and really
talk for a few minutes? I’m very worried about this problem, and I’m
really hoping you can help me find a way to solve it.” Also, if a loved one
routinely takes advantage of you, see Chapter 13.
Relationships don’t always balance out neatly like two sides of an equation, of
course. Any relationship has an ebb and flow. Sometimes — if you’re caring for
young children or aging parents, for example — you need to give more than
you get in return. But in general, you should give as much as you get from a
relationship. Don’t expect to achieve this balance overnight if PTSD threw
your friendships or family ties out of kilter. But do keep working to make your
relationships fair, satisfying, and emotionally healthy for everyone involved.
Thinking about Work and Finances
Some people manage to keep their careers under control even when their
PTSD is in full swing. Many others, however, need to reduce their workload or
leave their jobs. If you’re in that big second group, you may be wondering,
“When — if ever — can I go back to work?”
In this section, I offer advice about deciding whether you’re ready to return
to work. I also talk about some alternatives to the 9-to-5 routine if your PTSD
symptoms make that leap too challenging. In addition, I discuss your options
if work isn’t in the cards for you.
Preparing for a successful return to work
If you’re getting the itch to get your career back on track, that itch is a
healthy sign. Congratulations! But you don’t want to head back into the work-
place jungle too quickly and risk a setback. Here are tips on timing your
return to work correctly:
276
Part IV: Healing and Rebuilding during and after Treatment 

 Talk with your therapist. She has a good feel for your progress and can
offer an educated opinion about whether you’re completely ready to
head back to the office. If you’ve completed therapy, you may want to
schedule a refresher session so you can brush up on your relaxation and
coping skills before you head back to the rat race.
 Talk with your doctor. Your physician can tell you whether you’re phys-
ically up to the challenge of going back to work. Also, if you’re taking
medication for your PTSD, you can take this opportunity to talk with him
about any side effects that may interfere with work. If you’ll be asking for
special accommodations at work, you may also need your doctor (or
your therapist) to document the reasons for these accommodations.
(See the legal protection sidebar in Chapter 5.)
 Talk with your supervisor. If you’re returning to the job you had before
PTSD struck, get back in touch with your boss. If you think you’ll need
special accommodations to do your job — such as an office where you
won’t be exposed to loud or sudden noises that could trigger panic
attacks — you need to explain why. You may qualify for these accommo-
dations under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). If you don’t
want special accommodations, it’s completely up to you whether to dis-
cuss your PTSD with your supervisor.
 Talk with your staff if you’re the supervisor or boss. If you’re a man-
ager or the boss of your company and your PTSD symptoms are likely to
be evident at times, give your employees the info they’ll need to put
these symptoms in context. You don’t need to say, “I have PTSD”
(although that’s often the simplest way to handle the situation). Instead,
you can say something like, “As a result of my accident, I tend to jump
out of my skin if I hear a loud noise. I may also get more upset than I
should if I’m startled. So don’t take it personally if you drop a plate and I
bite your head off — it’s just taking me a little while to get over that reac-
tion. I appreciate your understanding — you’re a great bunch.”
277
Chapter 14: Getting Your Life Back on Track
Smoothing your way with a powerful thank-you
Here’s a helpful hint: If your supervisor does
welcome you back and goes out of her way to
make your return smooth, acknowledge her
efforts with what I call the Power Thank-You.
This tool helps you solidify her support in the
event that your remaining PTSD symptoms
cause problems down the road. Here are the
two steps of a Power Thank-You:
1. When you say thanks, acknowledge the
extra effort she made to help you.
You may say, “I know you went to a lot of
extra trouble to find me a quieter location in
the office, and I really appreciate it.”
2. Tell her what a difference her actions made
to you.
You may say, “It was so helpful of you to talk
with my coworkers about understanding my
flashbacks. I feel much less worried about
the reception they’ll give me.”

Handling the demands of the job
If you plan to return to the job you had before your PTSD struck, you have
the advantage of knowing the routine already. Because you know what to
expect, you can think about potential stressors and plan ways to defuse
them. Here are a couple of examples:
 If certain machinery sounds trigger unpleasant memories of your trauma,
try listening to music or nature tapes through headphones while you
work; use a white noise machine to distract yourself from the noises; or
record the sounds at work and then play them back at home so you can
desensitize yourself to them.
 If certain sights at work upset you, you may want to ask ahead of time
whether you can move your desk to a different area.
In the following sections, you can take a look at some other techniques.
Packing a stress-management toolbox
You can prepare for your return by creating a toolbox of coping and relax-
ation aids that you can take to work with you. This toolbox can be a small
carton or envelope that you can tuck away in your purse, desk, or wallet.
Items to put in your toolbox can include
 Affirmations: Write out several positive statements, such as these:
• I’m very talented, and I have the tools I need to do my job well.
• I have the confidence to remain calm during any tense situation.
• I have the power to respond to criticism in a positive way.
 Relaxation exercises: Make a list of relaxation techniques you can use
quietly at your desk. (Even if you know the techniques by heart, keeping
a written list at hand can remind you to put them into action.) You can
find some good examples in Chapter 12.
 Anchors: Include one or two objects that remind you of your strengths
or favorite aspects of your life — for example, a medal from a contest
you won or a photo of your kids or Fido.
 Jokes: Humor is one of the best ways to defuse stress and short-circuit a
blowup. Clip out a funny cartoon or write down a couple of jokes that
always make you giggle.
Getting help from co-workers
If one of your co-workers is a trustworthy friend, ask him to give you a heads-
up if he sees you getting tense or reacting to a situation in a PTSD-think way.
One way to do this discreetly is to come up with a code word or phrase she
can drop innocently into a conversation. (One person used the phrase “Is it
warm in here?” to remind a colleague to chill out when things got tense.)
278
Part IV: Healing and Rebuilding during and after Treatment 

If your symptoms are still significant, you probably need to clue in your boss
and co-workers about your PTSD. Otherwise, you may prefer to keep this
part of your life private.
Dealing with discrimination
When you return to work, you may encounter what you feel to be unfair dis-
crimination on the job because of your PTSD symptoms. In such a case, you
can turn to several sources of help or information:
 A union representative (if you belong to a union)
 Your company’s human resources department
 The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s disability dis-
crimination information Web site at eeoc.gov/types/ada.html,
where you can find information on the ADA
Explaining your PTSD to a new employer
That first day on a new job is stressful, and you’re even more likely to have
butterflies if you’re overcoming PTSD and you’re worried about how your
condition will affect your career. Of course, if you’re asking a company to
make specific accommodations for your PTSD, your employer needs to be
aware of your symptoms early on (for info on how to handle this, see the
Equal Opportunity Commission’s fact sheet at www.eeoc.gov/facts/
jobapplicant.html.)
If your symptoms are mild or moderate and you don’t need special accommo-
dations, what you tell your employer is up to you. Here are some good
ground rules:
 Be straightforward about symptoms that show. Tell your boss about
any problems he’ll notice anyway. For instance, if you work in a building
with armed security guards and the sight of someone wearing a gun
makes you shivery and sweaty, casually mention, “I was injured a while
back by an armed robber, and the sight of a gun still scares me, but don’t
worry if I get a little wonky when the security guard walks by — I’m get-
ting over it.”
 Avoid TMI. TMI stands for too much information — like when Great-Aunt
Bertha tells you about her hemorrhoids. You want your new boss to
view you as an asset, not a problem, so confine your explanations of
your symptoms to a brief few sentences. Don’t give her the history
of your trauma and its aftermath or lots of other details. Your therapist
wants to hear this information; your boss doesn’t.
279
Chapter 14: Getting Your Life Back on Track

 Explain your solutions. If you need to tell your boss about a PTSD symp-
tom, also note any solutions you have for handling this symptom. For
instance, if your manager notices that you’re hypersensitive to noises,
you can note, “I found a great solution to this problem — I wear noise-
cancelling headphones at my desk.” Bosses like problem-solvers, so you
can earn points with this approach.
Weighing your options if 9-to-5
isn’t for you
If you’re eager to get your career back in gear but you’re not quite ready for
the pressures of the full-time, on-site workday world, take heart: You may
have other options. Depending on your skills and interests, these options can
include
 Telecommuting: If your job involves working with a computer, your boss
may be willing to let you work from home or combine on-site work with
some telecommuting. This option can be great if you have trouble dri-
ving or handling office stress due to lingering PTSD symptoms.
 Working part time: If you can get by on a reduced salary, this choice is
often a good one because it reduces the amount of workday pressure
you need to handle. If you choose this option, make sure you under-
stand how switching from full time to part time will affect your health
insurance and other benefits.
 Consulting: Many people with PTSD find that their former employers are
willing to hire them as consultants instead of requiring them to stay on
as full-time employees. If you find this option attractive, remember that
you’ll need to make arrangements for health insurance. Depending on
what field you’re in, you may be able to sign on with a consulting firm
that offers both job flexibility and benefits.
 Working at home: This option is excellent for many people whose PTSD
symptoms make it hard to cope with interpersonal relationships or on-
the-job pressures. Working at home gives you access to a wider range of
relaxation and coping tools, and it can give you the flexibility to sched-
ule your work for times when you’re feeling up to par. On the other
hand, it typically doesn’t offer you the safety net of paid health insur-
ance and other benefits. Working at home also requires self-discipline.
Further, the lack of contact with other people may not be healthy if it
causes you to sink into depression or loneliness.
280
Part IV: Healing and Rebuilding during and after Treatment 

Finding financial solutions
if you can’t return to work
For some people, returning to the workforce simply isn’t an option because
their PTSD symptoms are still too disabling. If you find yourself in this situa-
tion, finding a way to stay afloat financially is a huge concern.
In many cases, people with PTSD qualify for some form of disability benefits.
The most common types of benefits include
 Workers’ compensation if your PTSD is clearly linked to an on-the-job
trauma
 Service-connected disability benefits if your PTSD stems from trauma
experienced during military service (for more on this subject, see
Chapter 5)
 Social Security benefits for people with disabilities — two different types
of these benefits are available:
• Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), which pays benefits if
your disability qualifies and if you paid Social Security taxes and
worked long enough to be covered
• Supplemental Security Income (SSI), which pays benefits based on
financial need if your disability qualifies you for coverage
 Private disability insurance coverage through an employer
You can’t find a simple, one-size-fits-all answer as to whether you qualify for
disability benefits because of your PTSD, but here are a few of the key factors
that may play a role in determining whether you’ll get coverage:
 Whether your PTSD is work-related or occurred outside work
 How severe and long-term your symptoms are
 Whether you have multiple disabilities
 How well you can document your symptoms and treatment
 How aggressive you’re willing to be in pursuing your claim
If you decide to seek disability benefits, be prepared for the fact that obtaining
these benefits is often a chore and sometimes a battle. To weed out some bad
apples, bureaucratic agencies put everyone through an inquisition — including
the overwhelming majority of people who clearly need and deserve benefits.
Here are some steps you can take to prepare for this challenging experience:
281
Chapter 14: Getting Your Life Back on Track

 Gather your evidence. Put together all the records you have to docu-
ment your PTSD. If you don’t have the records you need, ask your doc-
tors or therapists for copies. (You may need to pay a small fee.)
 Get legal help. If you’re not confident that your claim is ironclad, con-
sider hiring an attorney who can help you prove your case. If you can’t
afford an attorney, ask your local Legal Aid Society about your options.
 Brush up on your coping skills. The agency you’re approaching may
appear obstructive, unsympathetic, or even hostile at times. Remind
yourself that they’re not really attacking you as a person; it’s all part
of the process, so don’t take it personally.
 Find out the facts. Don’t expect to master the fine points of disability
law, which can give even lawyers a migraine headache. But if you bone
up a little on general terms and broad laws, you should find it easier to
understand the information you get from an agency or attorney. Most
civilian claims involve the Social Security Administration (SSA). You
can get information about the process at these Web sites:
• The SSA page “Benefits for People with Disabilities” at www.
ssa.gov/disability
• The National Organization of Social Security Claimants’
Representatives, www.nosscr.org, where you can find a
wealth of information about the ins and outs of qualifying
for Social Security benefits as a result of your disability
• Social Security Disability Secrets, www.disabilitysecrets.
com, which contains materials written by a former disability 
claims examiner
If you’re a veteran and you’re pursuing a service-related disability,
resources include
• Veterans Benefits Administration at www.vba.va.gov
• Iraq War Veterans Organization, Inc., at www.iraqwarveterans.
org/disability_claim_info.htm
• Vietnam Veterans of America at www.vva.org/benefits/

Recognizing the Positive Effects
of Your Experience
There’s an old story about a man who goes to his rabbi and complains, “Life
is unbearable. There are nine of us living in one room. What can I do?” The
rabbi replies, “Bring your goat into the room with you.” The man stares at
him, aghast, but the rabbi says, “Do it, and come back in a week.”
282
Part IV: Healing and Rebuilding during and after Treatment 

Seven days later, the man comes back and says, “Life is even worse. The
goat smells terrible, and we’re even more crowded. Now what do we do?”
The rabbi smiles and replies, “Put the goat back outside, and come back in
a week.”
Seven days after that, the man returns to the rabbi and says, “Life is beautiful!
We’re so happy that there’s no goat — just the nine of us!”
What’s the moral of the story? Often, whether you’re happy or unhappy
depends not on what’s really happening in your life but on your perspective.
That same perspective can help you as you recover from PTSD by allowing
you to see that although you lost a great deal during your struggle, you also
received some valuable gifts.
To help you identify those gifts, ask yourself the following questions.
Remember that the goal is not to minimize the horrific ordeal you suffered
or the intense pain you endured when PTSD took over your life but to help
you become aware of the positive lessons you learned and the gains you
experienced in going through this stage of your life. Recognizing the good
changes in your life since PTSD struck can help put the bad changes in per-
spective and give greater meaning to your trauma and recovery.
 What new skills or inner strengths did you develop as a result of surviv-
ing your trauma and your PTSD?
283
Chapter 14: Getting Your Life Back on Track
The gift of perspective
Years ago, I saw two elderly women with arthri-
tis in my psychotherapy practice on the same
day. The first lady was very attractive and
expensively dressed, and I didn’t even realize
that she had arthritis until she told me. Her mild
case of the disease caused her very little pain,
but she complained bitterly about how disfigur-
ing her arthritis was and about how she needed
to have her rings resized.
A few hours later, another elderly woman came
into my office. She was hunched over and
walked slowly across the room with the help of
a cane. Her back and hands were deformed and
twisted. Yet she also had one of the most radiant
smiles I’d ever seen. Puzzled, I said, “I notice
that you have severe arthritis and have difficulty
walking, yet you have an amazing smile. I don’t
get it. How come?”
She looked at me and said, “I was just thinking
how great this cane is going to look in a couple
years, when I’m in a wheelchair.”
This woman, at 75, had experienced loss,
tragedy, illness, and all the other suffering that
comes with living to a ripe old age. That suffer-
ing left scars and sadness — but it also gave
her the perspective that allowed her (unlike my
first patient) to treasure the good things in her
life rather than take them for granted.
Like her, you’ll carry some scars of your trauma
for your entire life. But you’ll also carry the gifts
it gave you — if you’re wise enough to see them.

 What new, positive relationships do you have as a result of this
experience?
 How has your sense of empathy for other people changed as a result of
what you went through?
 How has your sense of purpose in life changed as a result of overcoming
your trauma and your PTSD?
 Do you feel a greater appreciation for the joys and blessings in your life?
 Do you have a better sense of who your true friends really are, based on
how they came through in your time of need?
 Do you have a better sense of what’s important in your life and what isn’t?

nakes and snails and puppy-dog tails. Sugar and spice and everything
nice. That’s what kids’ lives are supposed to be made of.
All too often, however, fear and pain shatter a child’s world. Frequently, the
innocence of childhood ends abruptly when a parent dies, a natural disaster
strikes, or a car accident occurs. In other cases, physical, sexual, or psycho-
logical abuse cuts the joy of childhood short.
Fortunately, the therapies that work with adults can also help children put the
pieces of their lives back together again. In this chapter, I look at when to seek
professional help for a child troubled by trauma; why treating kids is different
from treating grownups; what kinds of therapy can help a child with PTSD; and
how getting everyone on your child’s team can speed up the healing process.
Recognizing the Nuances: Normal
Childhood Behavior versus PTSD
Consider these scenarios:
Davey refuses to go to summer camp.
Seri, an honors student, stops doing her homework and gets a D in math.
John gets into a fight at school and gets suspended.
Darla clings to her mom’s leg when it’s time to go to school and screams,
“No! Don’t leave me!”

288
Part V: Stepping In: When You're Not the One Who's Suffering 
Maybe all these children are displaying symptoms of PTSD — or maybe
they’re all acting perfectly normally. As a parent trying to help a child come
to terms with a trauma, how can you tell the difference between typical,
healthy behavior and a serious problem?
The short answer: It isn’t easy. In Chapter 3, I describe how to spot red flags
for PTSD in children at different ages. Telling a normal childhood mood or
behavior from a symptom can be difficult, however. In the end, you’re likely
to have to make a judgment call.
Here’s why deciding whether a child’s problems add up to PTSD is very hard
for parents (and often even for doctors):
 Kids express the pain of PTSD differently from adults. In kids, anything
from bedwetting to flunking an algebra test could be a reaction to
trauma.
 Kids change from day to day, and telling normal changes from worri-
some ones is hard — especially during the tumultuous teen years, when
those scary hormones kick in.
 Children’s PTSD symptoms often fluctuate over time. A child may be
withdrawn and quiet for a month or two and then get jumpy or experi-
ence nightmares and flashbacks. These changing patterns can make it
tough to identify the three core PTSD symptoms: intrusive thoughts,
avoidance, and hyperarousal (for more on these subjects, see Chapter 3).
All these factors make deciding whether a child needs professional help a
challenge, and that challenge usually falls squarely on the shoulders of Mom
or Dad. In the next sections, I offer some guidelines that can help you answer
this difficult question. If you’re on the fence after reading these sections, err
on the side of caution and consult your child’s doctor.
Note: If your child’s trauma occurred very recently (only a few weeks ago), he
may be experiencing symptoms of acute stress disorder. See Chapters 2 and 4
for information about this problem and steps you can take to reduce the
chances that the trauma will turn into PTSD.
Deciding Whether to Consult
a Pediatrician
A strange rash or a hoarse cough is a clear sign that your child needs to visit
the doctor. But PTSD is much harder to pin down, so you may have trouble
knowing whether a consultation with the pediatrician is in order. Here are
some guidelines that can help you decide whether your child’s symptoms are
serious enough that you should ask the doctor if it’s PTSD.

Do the symptoms interfere 
with your child’s life?
All children experience powerful feelings after a trauma, including fear, anxi-
ety, irritability, confusion, anger, and sadness. For days or weeks after a life
crisis, these emotions can get in the way of school and cause a child to avoid
friends, lash out at family members, or simply curl into a ball in front of the
TV and tune out the world.
All these reactions are perfectly normal, which is why doctors don’t diagnose
PTSD when people have short-term symptoms (see Chapter 2 for more on the
differences between normal stress responses and PTSD). What isn’t normal is
when symptoms continue to interfere with a child’s school, home, and social
life for months or even years after trauma strikes. Here are some examples of
the differences between typical and worrisome responses:
 It’s normal for a child to have trouble concentrating on math or geogra-
phy for a few weeks or months after a life crisis. But if a former A stu-
dent seems to lose all motivation to study and her grades slide semester
after semester, those changes are big warning signs.
 Kids overflow with conflicting emotions after a trauma, and those emo-
tions can translate into crying jags, temper tantrums, or hostility. Again,
all these responses are normal. But a child who continues to alienate
good friends, cry at the drop of a hat, avoid social events, or get deten-
tion at school month after month is crying out for help.
Assessing overall changes in your child’s lifestyle
To gain some clues about whether your child’s symptoms add up to PTSD, you
need to look at the big picture by analyzing his performance in different areas
of life since the trauma. Remember that symptoms that are normal during the
first few weeks after a trauma are cause for concern if they strongly affect his
life for months or longer. Think about how he’s doing in these areas:
 School: Did your child’s grades drop dramatically after the trauma? Did
he lose interest in getting good grades for college or stop caring about
after-school activities he once loved (such as a sports team or drama)
without replacing them with new, positive interests?
 Friends: Is your child breaking long-term bonds of friendship, hooking
up with a bad crowd, or shrinking into a shell and avoiding contact with
other people?
 Family: Is your child’s relationship with you very different from the way
it was before the trauma? Does he fail to find pleasure in family activities
that he once loved or frequently lash out at family members, verbally or
physically? If your child is young, does he have severe separation anxi-
ety and scream or cry when you need to leave him?
289
Chapter 15: Getting Help for a Child with PTSD

 Behavior: Does your child act very differently from the way he did
before the trauma? Does he now have a hair-trigger temper, jump at the
least noise, or avoid places that remind him of the trauma? Do TV shows
or movies upset him? Is he either too fearful (even of things not directly
related to the trauma) or too quick to try dangerous activities? Does he
suffer from frequent, intense nightmares? Does he seem abnormally
numb and unable to experience normal feelings? Does he refuse to talk
about the trauma at all — or conversely, seem to be unable to stop talk-
ing about it when the topic comes up? Is he wetting the bed or acting
like a baby much of the time?
If you answer yes to any or all of these questions and if your child’s trauma
occurred one or more months ago, talking to your child’s doctor is a good
idea. On the other hand, if your child’s symptoms are very mild and he’s doing
okay at school and at home, it’s probably safe to assume that watchful waiting
is fine for now. (See Chapter 4 for tips on ways to help your child recover if his
symptoms are mild or if he’s still in the early days after a trauma.)
Considering signs of depression
Many children with PTSD show signs of depression. Parents may miss these
signs because they typically don’t think of depression as a possibility unless
a child is weepy or unhappy. But strange as it sounds, depressed kids don’t
always act sad (although sadness is a common symptom). Here are some of
the other symptoms kids may show:
 Changes in eating (overeating, loss of appetite) or sleeping (insomnia,
oversleeping, nightmares)
 A sense of hopelessness, worthlessness, or guilt
 Inability to express happiness or joy
 Loss of interest in favorite activities
 Fatigue, or periods of fatigue alternating with periods of overactivity
(the latter may be symptomatic of bipolar disorder, also known as manic
depression)
 Poor school performance and inability to concentrate on schoolwork
 Overreaction to minor failures or rejections
 Anger or hostility
 Isolation from friends or family members
 Headaches, stomachaches, or other chronic physical symptoms
 Suicidal thoughts or behavior
Many of these symptoms overlap with PTSD, so drawing a line between the
two disorders is impossible. But from a parent’s point of view, the distinction
doesn’t matter; both PTSD and depression require the urgent attention of a
medical professional.
290
Part V: Stepping In: When You're Not the One Who's Suffering 

Could the symptoms endanger 
your child or others?
Just like adults, kids can react to a trauma by developing destructive behaviors.
When they do, you need to act quickly before they can harm themselves or
other people.
If your child exhibits any of these behaviors, seek professional help 
immediately:
 Violence toward family or friends — not the usual roughhousing or
minor scuffling but serious acts that hurt or scare others
 Dangerous risk-taking, such as unsafe sexual behavior, speeding, or
drunk driving
 Drug or alcohol abuse
 Depression (see the earlier section “Considering signs of depression” for
symptoms)
 Eating disorders (see Chapter 3)
 Cutting or other self-injurious behaviors (see Chapter 3)
 Suicidal thoughts or behavior
In these situations, seeking help isn’t an option — it’s a necessity. To speed
up the process, consider making an appointment directly with a child psychi-
atrist rather than starting with a pediatrician or general practitioner.
Are your child’s symptoms 
getting better or worse?
The symptoms that stem from a trauma often follow a cyclical course but typ-
ically fade over time. If you’re confident that your child’s symptoms are
decreasing, you can let nature take its course while you keep a watchful eye
out for problems. But if your child’s symptoms don’t start improving by a
month or so after the trauma — or if you think they’re getting worse — you
need to call for help.
One way to tell whether things are getting better, staying the same, or getting
worse is to track your child’s moods and behaviors. Stash a calendar in a
drawer and note the days when your child is out of control, withdrawn, or
otherwise troubled. Also note whether the behaviors are severe or mild so
you can spot trends. If your child is a teenage girl, see whether her mood
swings track with her periods; this information can help you decide whether
291
Chapter 15: Getting Help for a Child with PTSD

you’re facing PMS instead of PTSD. You may want to code your calendar (one
parent wrote water plants every time her daughter went on a crying jag!) so
your child doesn’t get upset if she comes across it.
Among the things you can track on your timeline are
 How often your child has an emotional meltdown
 How often he has nightmares about the trauma
 How often she says no to activities she once enjoyed
 How often you feel alarmed or uneasy about his behavior (your gut feel-
ings are a good indicator of whether things are getting better or worse)
Talk to your child. That’s easier said than done with a teen, but even small
clues can help you decide whether a behavior is worsening or whether your
child is just going through a normal life issue. What strikes you as disturbing
moodiness may turn out to be a typical reaction to getting the cold shoulder
from a hot guy or losing a spot on the basketball team.
Enlisting the Help of a Doctor: 
The Order of Events
If you think your child’s symptoms point to PTSD, share your concerns with a
doctor. First, make an appointment to talk with the doctor alone. If she knows
what to expect, she can be on the lookout for PTSD symptoms when you
bring your child to the next appointment.
When you return to the doctor’s office with your child, the doctor may ask
both you and your child some questions that upset you. (For instance, if your
child experienced a death in the family, the doctor may ask him questions
such as, “Are you very angry about what happened?” or “Are you worried
that other people in your family may die?”) She needs to ask these questions
to assess how troubling your child’s symptoms are, so answer any questions
openly and honestly and encourage your child to do the same. Kids are less
likely to volunteer symptoms than adults are, so doctors need to do some
poking around to fill in the blanks. Good doctors do this probing in a sensi-
tive, age-appropriate way, but a few tears still may flow.
Most likely, your child’s doctor will be able to form a preliminary opinion
after one visit. If she suspects PTSD, she’ll probably refer you to a psychologi-
cal professional for an in-depth evaluation and therapy if the evaluation does
indicate PTSD. (See Chapter 6 for info on the different types of professionals
who specialize in treating PTSD.)
292
Part V: Stepping In: When You're Not the One Who's Suffering 

If you disagree with your doctor’s conclusions, get a second opinion.
Childhood PTSD is one of the hardest diagnoses for a doctor to make, and
two doctors may come to very different conclusions because even the
experts disagree on what PTSD looks like in young children and in teenagers.
Knowing Why and How Treating Children
Differs from Treating Adults
If you and your child’s doctor agree that your child shows signs of PTSD, try
to find a therapist who’s experienced in treating kids the same age as your
child. Kids with PTSD are different from adults in several ways, and what
works for a 40-year-old won’t do the job for a 4-year-old or a 14-year-old.
In this section, I offer a quick look at the big differences between the PTSD
treatments for grownups and kids, and I explain why therapists who treat
children need to use approaches that differ from those used by therapists
who treat adults.
Differences in language abilities 
and cognitive skills
Therapies for adults with PTSD typically involve a whole lot of talking. But a
young child really doesn’t have enough language to express his feelings and
may not even be able to describe his trauma verbally. A therapist can
address these limitations in several ways:
 By using words and concepts that a child can understand
 By using pictures or videos
 By using toys, dolls, puppets, clay, or crayons to help a child express
what she can’t say in words
In addition, a therapist who’s trained in working with children understands
the ways in which children think differently from adults and designs a ther-
apy approach that takes these differences into account:
 Very young children often think that bad events stem from their own
thoughts and actions. (Child development experts call this belief magi-
cal thinking.) Therapists who work with children are careful to reassure
small patients that they aren’t to blame for hurricanes, illnesses, or car
accidents. This reassurance is crucial because guilt plays a big role in
PTSD — for kids as well as adults.
293
Chapter 15: Getting Help for a Child with PTSD

 In different ways depending on their ages, children (and even teens) see
their parents as omnipotent protective shields, so they feel betrayed
and angry when Mom or Dad can’t save them from a trauma. A therapist
trained in helping children addresses this sensitive issue in a way that’s
appropriate to your child’s developmental level.
 Teens often act out their PTSD in dangerous ways because at this age,
they believe (to some degree) that they’re invulnerable to death or seri-
ous injury. A therapist can help a teen take a hard look at the long-term
consequences of risky behavior.
Differences in experience and coping skills
Life is full of big and little upsets, and weathering these storms gives you a
wonderful gift called perspective. Perspective helps cushion the blows of life
crises because you can look back at the past and say, “I overcame a problem
like this before, so I know I can do it again.”
To understand how this phenomenon works, think back to the first time you
lost a pet or moved away from a best friend. At first, you thought you couldn’t
survive the pain. In a few weeks, however, you moved on with your life. The
next time you suffered a similar loss, you instinctively knew that you’d get
through it and feel better in time.
Kids, however, often have very little experience with the school of hard
knocks. When a big trauma shakes their world, it can be even more shocking
for them than it is for an adult because they can’t call on experience as a
guide. For this reason, a therapist may need to help a child develop the
resilience and coping skills that an adult already possesses.
Another difference between kids and adults with PTSD involves the feelings
of helplessness that often arise after a trauma. An adult often comes to terms
with these feelings in therapy by realizing that he’s not really helpless and
that he has ways to cope if another crisis arises. An adult who develops PTSD
after a natural disaster, for example, may recognize that he can protect him-
self in the future by buying better homeowner’s or medical insurance, taking
steps to make his home safer, or even moving to a less disaster-prone area.
The situation is not quite the same for kids because to a larger degree than
adults, they are helpless, and they recognize this fact. A young child knows
that she can’t fend for herself if a hurricane, fire, or flood strikes. She can’t
drive, find shelter, or handle medical emergencies. Thus, her sense of help-
lessness following a disaster can be deeper than an adult’s — especially if
Mommy or Daddy couldn’t be there to help her during the initial trauma.
294
Part V: Stepping In: When You're Not the One Who's Suffering 

Therapists who work with children can address this problem by helping even
the youngest children identify what they did do to help take control of a situa-
tion (such as following the family’s fire drill procedure during a home fire). In
addition, the therapist can help a child come up with ways to feel a bit of con-
trol or take steps to help him regain his confidence that adults will do their
best to protect him if another crisis occurs.
Understanding Common Treatments 
for Children and Teens with PTSD
Some aspects of medicine are so well studied that it’s almost silly. (Do we
really need another study saying that french fries are bad for you?) Other
areas, however, are largely unexplored territory. Unfortunately, childhood
PTSD falls into that category.
The research on what works and what doesn’t for treating PTSD in kids is
skimpier than it should be, but doctors and therapists can draw some good
conclusions about the most common approaches. In the following sections, I
discuss these approaches and explain what professionals know and don’t
know about their effectiveness.
Note: If your child’s trauma is very recent and if a doctor or therapist recom-
mends an intervention called crisis intervention or psychological debriefing,
see Chapter 4 for a discussion of this approach. Because this therapy is used
for at-risk children rather than those who already have PTSD, I don’t discuss
it in the following sections.
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)
In Chapter 8, I talk about cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), the most popu-
lar and well-validated approach for treating PTSD in adults. (This form of
treatment is also referred to as trauma-based CBT because it asks patients to
re-experience their trauma to overcome it.) Studies strongly indicate that
CBT is also an excellent therapy for children.
Agreeing to let your child participate in CBT is a big step because this ther-
apy requires your child to confront her trauma — though she’ll do it in the
safe setting of a therapy room. In the following sections, I look at how CBT
therapists tailor their methods to children and why these methods are safe
and effective even for young kids.
295
Chapter 15: Getting Help for a Child with PTSD

How CBT for kids differs from CBT for adults
Just like adult therapy, CBT for children starts by teaching children tech-
niques for relaxation and stress management; then it helps them confront
their trauma and make sense of what happened to them. CBT therapists who
work with children, however, modify their techniques to take the following
factors into account:
 Age and developmental level: CBT can work for children as young as 3
years old, but therapists often use techniques for children that differ from
the ones they use for adults. A CBT therapist may ask a 6-year-old to act
out the trauma with dolls or to draw pictures of his trauma, as well as
describe the scene verbally. The therapist may also use role-playing to
allow the child to understand the trauma from different people’s points
of view.
 The role of parents: Therapists who work with kids realize that parents
are the most important people in a child’s life and that they’re crucial to
the child’s success in healing from PTSD. Thus, therapists include Mom,
Dad, or both in many sessions.
CBT therapists who work with children use the same methods and have the
same goals as those who work with adults, so to find out more about CBT in
general, start with Chapter 8.
How CBT benefits kids and teens
Just thinking about letting a therapist ask your child to relive the terrifying
event she suffered is likely to upset you. That reaction is natural because you
want to protect her from any more pain. But in reality, she’s in pain already —
and the only way she can let go of the event that holds her in its grip is to
revisit it in a safe setting and understand its effects.
As your child works through her trauma and figures out how to see it through
new eyes, her initial fear and distress will fade, and she’ll become more confi-
dent, happy, and ready to face the future. Her therapist can help her do this
by zeroing in on these goals in particular:
 Helping her learn not to catastrophize events in his life so she won’t be
scared all the time; for instance, a therapist can help your child realize that
• If Daddy’s feeling a little under the weather, it doesn’t mean that
he’s having another heart attack.
• Cloudy skies usually don’t mean that another tornado is on the way.
 Eliminating any misplaced guilt she feels as a result of the trauma
 Empowering her to feel strong and capable so that she’s less fearful of
potential future crises
296

Scientific support for CBT
Most research on the effects of CBT involves adults instead of children, but
the number of pediatric studies is growing, and the results strongly support
the effectiveness of this approach. Following are samples of recent findings:
 A 2006 study published by Ioanna Giannopoulou and colleagues in
Clinical Child Psychology and Psychiatry followed 20 children who devel-
oped PTSD after a large earthquake in Athens, Greece. The researchers
found that CBT resulted in a significant reduction in overall PTSD symp-
toms as well as symptoms of depression. Effects were long-lasting, with
the children continuing to show positive effects four years after therapy.
 A 2006 study by Esther Deblinger and colleagues, published in the
Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,
involved 183 children who developed symptoms of PTSD after being sex-
ually abused. The researchers compared CBT with a treatment called
child-centered therapy (CCT), which doesn’t specifically address the
child’s trauma. Their findings: Children treated with CBT had signifi-
cantly fewer symptoms of PTSD and experienced less shame as a result
of their trauma than the children who participated in CCT.
 A 2005 review in the journal Depression and Anxiety by Gili Adler-Nevo
and Katharina Manassis compared three treatments for children with
PTSD resulting from a single trauma; the report concluded that although
all three therapies are effective, CBT has the best scientific support. (For
info on the other two therapies, EMDR and play therapy, see the follow-
ing sections.)
The National Center for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder recommends CBT for
traumatized kids and teens, concluding that “this is the most effective
approach for treating children.” The Chadwick Center for Children and
Families also highly recommended CBT in a comprehensive 2004 report on
the best practices in the treatment of children traumatized by abuse.
Eye movement desensitization and 
reprocessing (EMDR) therapy
In Chapter 8, I explain how therapists use eye movement desensitization and
reprocessing (EMDR) therapy to treat adults. This treatment is also growing
in popularity for children because it’s relatively quick and works well for chil-
dren with limited verbal skills. In the following sections, I look at how pedi-
atric therapists use EMDR and how effective it is.
297
Chapter 15: Getting Help for a Child with PTSD

The basics of EMDR for children
EMDR is very similar to CBT (described earlier in this chapter and in Chapter
8) because it asks a participant to re-experience her trauma in the safety of a
therapy setting. A patient participating in EMDR, however, recalls the trauma
silently in short segments. At the same time, she uses her eyes to follow the
therapist’s finger as he moves it slowly and steadily from side to side.
Therapists use the same approach for children and adults when offering
EMDR treatment, but they sometimes modify sessions in these ways:
 To hold a younger child’s visual attention, the therapist may move an eye-
catching finger puppet from side to side instead of moving a finger alone.
 Sessions tend to be shorter than those for adults. Sessions for children
usually last about 45 minutes at most.
 Therapy for children often involves fewer sessions because children
appear to react to the therapy more quickly than adults do.
The inside story on EMDR’s effectiveness for kids
The scientific literature on EMDR for children is small but growing, and early
results suggest that it’s just as effective as CBT (which isn’t surprising,
because the two approaches are very similar). Here are some findings:
 In a 2002 study reported by Claude Chemtob and colleagues in the
Journal of Clinical Psychology, researchers used EMDR to treat 32 chil-
dren who still exhibited PTSD one year after a disaster. After treatment,

Tackling inner-city PTSD
In some inner-city neighborhoods, crime or vio-
lence touches nearly every child’s life at some
point. A recent study of 6-year-olds at an inner-
city pediatric clinic found that at one or more
times in their lives,
 More than 40 percent saw another person
being beaten up.
 More than one in eight witnessed someone
being threatened with a knife.
 Seven percent saw someone being stabbed
or shot.
These horrific statistics translate into sky-high
numbers of inner-city children with PTSD.
Unfortunately, it’s tough — if not impossible —
for most families in these neighborhoods to find
help for traumatized kids.
To address this problem, some therapists are
offering school-based group sessions of CBT for
inner-city students with PTSD symptoms.
Research indicates that these interventions are
highly effective in reducing PTSD symptoms,
depression, and behavior problems in trauma-
tized children. As a result, increasing numbers
of inner-city schools are thinking about supple-
menting the three r’s (reading, writing, and ’rith-
metic) with a fourth r: recovery from trauma.

the children showed significant improvements in PTSD symptoms, anxiety,
and depression, and they continued to experience these positive changes
at a six-month follow-up.
 A study by Guinevere Tufnell, published in Clinical Child Psychology and
Psychiatry in 2005, followed four preteens treated with EMDR for PTSD
symptoms. In all four cases, the children’s symptoms were well-controlled
within two to four sessions. A follow-up six months later showed that
the children continued to do well.
EMDR has other advantages: It often works quickly, which can translate into
faster healing as well as less expense for parents; and it’s a good approach for
very shy children or those with limited verbal skills because it asks children
to recall their trauma silently rather than out loud.
Play therapy
Adults think of play as fun, but for kids, it’s also a powerful tool for express-
ing love, rage, fear, and other very big emotions. For this reason, therapists
often use play to explore what’s going on in the mind of a child who’s too
young to describe his inner feelings in words.
In this section, I look at how professionals use play therapy to identify the
psychic scars of children with PTSD and foster healing after a trauma, and I
describe what professionals know about this therapy’s usefulness.
The ABCs of play therapy
An adult knows about 50,000 words, but a child of 5 or 6 knows only about
5,000. What’s more, an adult’s vocabulary includes lots of expressions to
describe emotions (such as “I was flabbergasted!” or “I was tense and on edge,
like I was overcaffeinated”), whereas a young child’s toolbox of words to
describe his feelings is pretty limited. Because he has a small set of words 
to describe a big event, a young child can’t always tell a parent or a therapist
how he feels after a trauma changes his life.
Play therapy gets around the language problem by giving a child other outlets for
expressing himself, including dolls, puppets, stuffed animals, toy houses and
cars, sand, water, paint, clay, and crayons. Watching a child’s play, a therapist can
gently guide him to air his feelings. Here’s an example of how this approach
works:
 If the child repeatedly crashes two toy cars together, a therapist may
ask, “How do the people in those cars feel when they crash together?”
 If the child draws a picture of a person screaming, the therapist may ask,
“What is happening that’s scaring that person?”
299
Chapter 15: Getting Help for a Child with PTSD

Gradually, a therapist can get a child to open up more and more about the
trauma he experienced. The therapist has two goals in this process: to under-
stand the child’s thoughts and feelings and to use play to guide him to
explore new ways of thinking and feeling.
A child traumatized by a dog attack, for example, may spontaneously reenact
the trauma by using a toy dog to attack a doll named Charlie over and over.
The therapist may respond in these ways:
 First, she may ask how the doll feels when the attack occurs. (“Is Charlie
scared when the dog bites him on the foot?”)
 Next, she may ask how the doll feels after the trauma occurs. (“What
happens later, when a dog comes up to Charlie in the park?”)
 Eventually, she may have the child experiment with different ways the
doll could feel and act now. (“Here’s a little friendly dog that’s very dif-
ferent from that big mean one. This dog is very kind and gentle, and he’s
on a leash, so he can’t run up and jump on Charlie. This dog really likes
Charlie and wants to be his friend. Do you think that Charlie will be able
to pet him?”)
Play therapy can also be effective for older children who have trouble open-
ing up verbally about their trauma. Doctors sometimes recommend this
approach for children as old as 12.
The bottom line on play therapy
Play therapy is one of the oldest treatments for traumatized children, but
judging its overall effectiveness is hard because most studies of this
approach involve only one or two children. These small case studies don’t
offer much insight into how useful this approach is for kids in general.
In general, play therapy appears to be less effective than trauma-based CBT
or EMDR, both discussed earlier in this chapter. It’s an excellent choice, how-
ever, for children who are too young or frightened to benefit from CBT or
EMDR and for kids with very limited verbal skills. It’s also a gentle and non-
threatening approach for many children with developmental disabilities.
In individual cases, the effects of play therapy can be very dramatic. Recently,
WBHM, a National Public Radio affiliate in Birmingham, Alabama, reported 
on the effects of play therapy on a 4-year-old girl who had lost both kidneys
to cancer. Before therapy, the child refused to speak to people in lab coats,
regressed to baby talk, and covered herself with her sheets if a doctor entered
the room. Now, after therapy, the little girl actively seeks out her doctors —
and she doesn’t hesitate to give them an earful about whatever’s worrying her!
300
Part V: Stepping In: When You're Not the One Who's Suffering 

Play therapy is very safe and unlikely to cause any problems for your child,
but one caution is in order: If your child is involved in legal proceedings
stemming from a trauma (if he’ll need to testify about an assault, for exam-
ple), you should consult your therapist and your child’s lawyer about the
impact this therapy could have on the validity of his testimony. This consul-
tation is important because without meaning to, a play therapist may alter a
child’s recollection of a trauma.
If you choose play therapy as the best option for your child, be sure your
therapist is certified as either a Registered Play Therapist (RPT) or a
Registered Play Therapist Supervisor (RPT-S).
Medications
Just like adults, children with PTSD sometimes benefit greatly from medica-
tions. For a child who’s out of control, the right medication sometimes puts
on the brakes long enough for psychological therapies to take hold. Drugs
can have some serious adverse effects, however, so do your homework
before you agree to any prescription for your child. Chapter 9 outlines the
primary drugs used to treat PTSD, along with their benefits and dangers.
Doctors prescribe many of the same medications for children and teens, but
these drugs can be far riskier for the younger set than for adults. Here’s why:
 Researchers tend to study the effects of psychiatric drugs on adults
more thoroughly than they study these drugs’ effects on children. As a
result, proof that a drug is relatively safe for an adult doesn’t necessarily
translate into proof that it’s safe for a kid.
 Kids aren’t just little grownups when it comes to medications. Because
children are growing and changing, their metabolism and brain function
can be very different — which means that drugs can affect them differ-
ently than they affect adults.
As a result, psychiatric drugs can have serious and sometimes surprising
effects in kids, especially when a doctor combines two or more of these med-
ications. I recommend using them only if a compelling reason for using them
exists.
In particular, be extremely cautious if your child’s doctor recommends anti-
depressants. Some of these drugs now carry “black box” warnings — the
strongest warnings that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration can require —
cautioning that the drugs may cause suicidal thoughts or behavior in chil-
dren. Doctors are still debating whether antidepressants actually increase or
decrease the overall risk of suicide in young people, but be aware that this is
a potential concern.
301
Chapter 15: Getting Help for a Child with PTSD

If your doctor does recommend a medication for your child, here are some
suggestions:
 If the doctor who recommends the medication is a family practitioner,
ask for a referral to a child psychiatrist before accepting the prescription.
Child psychiatrists are more likely to be up-to-date on the good and bad
effects of psychiatric drugs on children than general practitioners are.
 Get a second opinion before you say yes to a medication, even if a child
psychiatrist recommends it.
If you decide that medication is a good option, be sure that your child
receives regular medical monitoring. Frequent tests can help prevent side
effects or catch them at an early stage.
Also, realize that medications — even when they work wonders — should
supplement psychological interventions instead of being a primary or sole
treatment. See Chapter 9 for more on this important point.
Seeking Out a Therapist 
and Starting Therapy
Therapy can work wonders for a child with PTSD, especially when you find a
sensitive and knowledgeable therapist who’s able to develop a good rapport
with your youngster. In this section, I offer advice on how to find the thera-
pist who best suits both your child’s needs and yours. In addition, I offer tips
on getting your child to agree to go to therapy sessions, and I tell you a little
about what to expect when you get to the therapist’s office.
Finding a good therapist for your child
In Chapter 6, I list a variety of ways to locate a therapist. In addition to follow-
ing the leads I suggest in that chapter, you may want to check with your
child’s school counselor for recommendations (but be discreet). Your pedia-
trician may also be able to make a referral.
If possible, get referrals for at least two or three therapists. Call each one and
ask for a brief interview, either in person or over the phone. (If you meet in
person, leave your child at home for the interview so you can talk frankly
with the therapist.) Here are good questions to ask:
 Do you have specific training in working with children who are the same
age as my child?
 How many years have you worked with children?
302
Part V: Stepping In: When You're Not the One Who's Suffering 

 What type of approach do you use?
 What credentials do you have?
 What’s your philosophy about involving the child’s family in treatment?
 Are you willing to collaborate with a child’s school or doctor to address
problems?
 What’s your philosophy about using medications?
In general, you want a therapist who’s licensed and has several years of expe-
rience in treating children with PTSD. Beyond that, look for a therapist whose
ideas on issues such as medication use or family involvement in therapy jibe
with your own. Also, use your instincts to decide whether the therapist
seems like someone who can make your child feel comfortable.
For information on the different types of professionals who offer therapy for
PTSD, as well as the financial aspects of therapy, see Chapter 6.
Getting your child to go
In most cases, adults seek therapy for PTSD because they accept the fact that
they need help. They may come to this decision slowly, and friends or family
members may need to help them overcome their denial, but in the end, the
choice is generally theirs.
The situation is different for kids because usually parents — not the children
themselves — decide that therapy is necessary. This arrangement typically
isn’t a problem with younger kids, who tend to go along with what their parents
say. But a preteen or teenager may say, “I’m not going,” or “You can drag me
there, but you can’t make me talk when I get there.”
If your child objects to therapy, realize that kids (just like adults) often fight
the idea of getting help because they’re frightened or in denial. Also, your
child may be scared that her friends will think she’s “crazy” if they find out
she’s seeing a therapist. Here are some ways to win her cooperation:
 Reassure her. Let her know that getting therapy is like getting medical
treatment for a sore arm or a headache and is nothing to be embarrassed
about. But also agree that you won’t talk to her friends (or yours) about
her therapy if privacy makes her feel more comfortable.
 Negotiate. Make a deal that she needs to go to only a half-dozen sessions
or so; then you’ll evaluate how therapy is going. If you can get her foot in
the door, she’s likely to find that talking about her feelings with a caring
therapist is easier and more rewarding than she expected.
 Let her be part of the decision process. Explain the different types of
therapy to her, and get her input on what sounds best. Giving her some
control of the situation may improve her attitude.
303
Chapter 15: Getting Help for a Child with PTSD

 Offer a bribe. Under normal circumstances, bribing your kid isn’t the
greatest idea — but if your child has PTSD, the circumstances aren’t
normal. So consider telling a reluctant child that you’ll upgrade her com-
puter, give her more cellphone minutes, or let her slide on her chores for
a couple of months in exchange for her promise to participate willingly
in therapy.
Picking your place: Therapy room 
or waiting room
Studies show that a parent’s positive attitude and willingness to participate
in therapy have a powerful effect on a child’s ability to heal from PTSD. In
addition, a parent’s involvement in therapy can reduce a child’s behavioral
problems and symptoms of depression.
Parents often wonder whether they should participate in every therapy ses-
sion with their children. The answer depends on your child’s age. If your
child is very young — say, 3 or 4 years old — a therapist may want you to
participate in every session. If your child’s older, however, the therapist may
want to talk to him alone some or most of the time. Here’s why:
 Your child may be embarrassed or ashamed about some aspects of the
trauma and may be unwilling to discuss them with you in the room.
 Your child may want to avoid upsetting you and will hold back — an act
that can reduce the effectiveness of therapy.
 If your child is a teen who’s full of attitude — and what teen isn’t? — he
may spend less time being hostile or defensive if his favorite target (you)
is out of the room.
If the therapist asks you to be involved in the sessions, give these sessions
top priority in your life, no matter how many other work and home responsi-
bilities you have. But bring a good book along to therapy sessions in case the
therapist asks you to sit in the waiting room — and don’t feel slighted if she
does. Being asked to wait outside doesn’t mean the therapist doesn’t like
you; it means that sometimes, three really is a crowd.
If you’re very uncomfortable leaving your child alone with a therapist, look
for a professional whose therapy room includes a one-way mirror so you can
view your child’s session without participating.
When you do take part in therapy sessions, resist the urge to be defensive if
the therapist suggests ways to alter your own actions in order to foster your
child’s healing. (For instance, a therapist may suggest being firmer in han-

Part V: Stepping In: When You're Not the One Who's Suffering 

slack in some areas.) The therapist may seem to be challenging your skills as
a parent if he offers you advice, but he’s not. He just has a good feel for the
ways in which PTSD can change family dynamics — something that’s true in
every family dealing with PTSD, not just yours — and he knows tricks for
tweaking those dynamics in positive ways.
Also, help and support your child with any homework the therapist recom-
mends. If the therapist asks your child to write in a journal each night, for
example, schedule your child’s chores so that they don’t interfere, and make
sure she has some quiet, uninterrupted time for this important task.
Helping Your Child Heal outside 
the Therapist’s Office
When a trauma leads to PTSD, your child needs a whole team of people in his
corner, including a therapist, a doctor, and a supportive school staff. Most
importantly, he needs you, because you’re the most important person in his life.
In the following sections, I talk about some simple steps you can take to assist
your child in healing after a traumatic event. These steps can help both children
at risk of developing PTSD and those already diagnosed with the disorder, so
you don’t need to wait for an official diagnosis to put these pieces in place.
Get on the same page as your partner
If you have a partner who’s very involved in your child’s life, talk together
about what you can do to help your child. Have this conversation when your
child isn’t home so you can be frank and iron out disagreements.
Here are some issues you should resolve to make sure you’re a solid team:
 Do you both agree that your child’s problems are significant? If not,
talk to a doctor or therapist together and see whether you can resolve
this crucial question.
 Do you agree on what type of therapy is appropriate? If not, do some
extra reading on the topic or interview additional therapists until you
find an approach you both can accept.
 What other steps can you take to aid in your child’s healing? Can
either of you spend more time with her? Can you come up with a consis-
tent plan for dealing with her emotional outbursts?
305
Chapter 15: Getting Help for a Child with PTSD

Don’t be too upset with yourselves if you occasionally squabble about issues
related to your child’s PTSD; you’re both experiencing some powerful emo-
tions as well. But do try to present a united front and to keep your personal
issues from affecting your child during this tough time in his life.
Understand your own feelings so you 
can foster your child’s healing
When your child suffers a trauma, you suffer right along with him. In addi-
tion, you feel some very complex emotions because of your special relation-
ship with your child. Here are some of the feelings you’re likely to experience:
 Guilt: As a parent, you see yourself as your child’s protector, and right now,
you feel like you let him down. You’re probably second-guessing every
move you made before the trauma (“If only we’d sent him to a different
school . . . forbidden him to go to that party . . . gotten him a safer car . . .”).
 Anger: After a trauma hurts your child, you’re angry, and you don’t
always direct that anger at the right targets. You may find yourself blowing
up at a partner, your child’s teacher, or anyone else in your path, even if
that person had little or nothing to do with the situation. If you have a
partner, the two of you may also argue about how serious your child’s
symptoms are and whether she needs help (see the preceding section for
advice on resolving such issues). At times, you may even feel angry at
your child if her symptoms cause her to say or do hurtful things.
 A sense of rejection: If you didn’t experience the trauma with your child,
he may say, “You can’t understand; you weren’t there.” He may turn away
from you at times and seek out the company of other people who lived
through the trauma, making you feel like you’re out in the cold.
 Grief: When your child experiences a trauma, your world changes, too.
While you’re busy trying to help your child cope, you’re also coming to
terms with your own grief about her pain and lost innocence.
All these emotions are normal. If they get in the way of both your healing and
your child’s, however, seek therapy for yourself. A support group (see Chapter
4) can also help you work through your feelings in a constructive way.
Keep life as calm as possible
When a trauma turns your child’s world upside down, he needs to regain a
sense of security, especially when PTSD enters the picture. One of the most
306
Part V: Stepping In: When You're Not the One Who's Suffering 

powerful ways you can help your child re-anchor himself in the present is to
keep his life as normal as possible. Here are some ways to reestablish rou-
tines after a life shakeup:
 If a natural disaster displaced you from your home and neighborhood,
see whether your child can still get together with his friends. If possible,
keep him in the same school and find ways for him to participate in
activities he’s used to, such as sports teams.
 If you can, keep mealtimes and bedtimes consistent and try to continue
family rituals such as pizza nights or weekend bike rides. Mundane rou-
tines can be incredibly calming when the world seems off-kilter.
 If your child’s favorite book, toy, or video was lost or destroyed in an
accident or disaster, replace it as quickly as possible. A beloved posses-
sion, no matter how small, can serve as a link to reality and routine in a
time of turmoil.
 If possible, keep familiar faces around: your child’s usual babysitter,
well-known relatives, familiar neighbors, and friends.
 Talk about the future to help your child understand that life will get back
on track. For instance, if a fire temporarily displaces you, say, “By your
next birthday, we’ll be back in our house again — and I’ll be making that
chocolate cake you love.” Conversations like this can help your child see
his life crisis as a temporary disruption rather than the end of the world.
Encourage relaxing activities
A peaceful environment can help soothe a troubled soul, so keep your child’s
physical surroundings as calm and relaxing as possible. Here are some ways
to accomplish this goal:
 Play relaxing or cheerful music that your child likes.
 If your child is a reader, get her a big stash of books by her favorite
authors. If possible, look for books with calm plots (though books in
which heroes overcome adversity can be inspiring, too, so don’t say no
to hobbits or Harry Potter).
 Follow holiday traditions, but tone them down if necessary. Focus on rit-
uals that your child loves instead of overwhelming him with company or
parties.
 If you have a budding chef at home, plan some cooking projects. A little
thing like the smell of cookies baking can help a child relax and enjoy
the moment.
307
Chapter 15: Getting Help for a Child with PTSD

 Encourage a good night’s sleep with soft bedtime music and calming sto-
ries. If your child can’t fall asleep on his own, it’s okay to let him sleep in
your bed (or in a sleeping bag in your room) for a few weeks.
Focus on your child’s resilience
For decades, therapy for both children and adults focused almost exclusively
on problems and psychic wounds. Now, however, experts know that focusing
on a person’s strengths is equally important — if not more important. Most
people who survive a trauma are resilient and capable of healing. Therefore,
sending the message “You’re a survivor” is much more effective than sending
the message “You’re a victim.”
Have faith in your child. She may always carry some scars from her ordeal,
but she needs to know that you think she’s strong and has the power to
recover. Your actions and conversations should convey the message that you
have confidence both in her and in her future.
Conversely, don’t belittle what happened to your child. Acknowledge the
depth of the trauma he suffered, as well as the fact that he suffered wounds
and needs time to heal. Don’t expect him to just get over it. Do expect some
fallout from his ordeal to linger for months or possibly years.
Take charge of the remote
The magic of TV lies in its power to connect you to people, places, and
events around the world. But that magic can turn dark when a trauma strikes
your child because nonstop coverage of a crisis can overwhelm a trauma-
tized child who can’t come to grips with what she’s seeing.
If the trauma that affected your child makes the nightly news, do your best to
minimize the amount of coverage he sees. Watch TV when it’s necessary (if
your family survived a natural disaster, for example, and you need info on
where to go and what to do), but try to avoid sensationalistic coverage or
specials that air on the anniversary of a traumatic event. This advice applies
both to children who already have PTSD and those who are at risk.
Understand symptoms (but don’t dismiss
everything as a symptom)
If you’re the parent of a child with PTSD, you need the wisdom of Solomon
and the patience of a saint, especially when your child acts up and you’re left
wondering, “Why is she doing this?”
308
Part V: Stepping In: When You're Not the One Who's Suffering 

It’s important to acknowledge your child’s symptoms while still expecting her
to behave in ways that don’t harm herself or others. Here are a few ground
rules to help you walk this fine line:
 Call on the pros. When alarming behaviors arise, consult your child’s
therapist for ideas on how to handle them. If you don’t have a therapist,
your family doctor or a pastoral counselor (see Chapter 6) may be able
to help.
 Spot the connections. Be sensitive to behaviors that probably stem from
your child’s trauma. Cut your child some slack if he’s weepy, whiny, or
irritable on anniversaries of his trauma, and don’t make him attend holi-
day parties if they trigger emotional outbursts.
 Draw the line. No matter how much your child’s hurting, you need to
say a firm no to destructive or hurtful behavior. If your daughter slaps
her sister, for example, say something like this: “I understand that you’re
in pain because of what happened to you and that it’s going to take time
to work through all your emotions. We’re here to support you every step
of the way. But it’s never acceptable to hurt Janey or us. First, you need
to apologize to Janey — and then you’re going to do all her chores for
the next month. Now let’s talk about things you can do when you feel
these overwhelming emotions and ways we can help you get control
over them.”
When your child’s out of control, it’s tempting to let him off the hook because
your heart’s aching for him and you don’t want to add to his pain. But in real-
ity, a child who can’t rely on himself to set limits desperately needs you to set
them for him. Be loving but firm.
Consider a support group
Face it — as much as you love your child, you can’t really understand her a lot
of the time (and vice versa). No matter how hard you work to bridge the gener-
ation gap, sometimes it’s easier for a child or teen to open up to people her
own age. For that reason, you may want to ask your child’s therapist or your
family doctor whether your child could benefit from attending a support group.
Also, think about joining a support group for parents of kids with PTSD if one
exists in your area. Helping a child with PTSD is a huge challenge, and that
burden can seem a little lighter if you share it with understanding people.
For information on how to locate support groups and for the benefits and
possible drawbacks of these groups, see Chapter 4.
309
Chapter 15: Getting Help for a Child with PTSD

Getting School, Family, and Friends 
in the Treatment Loop
When your child is hurting, you need all the help you can get to make things
right. For a child with PTSD, that help comes mostly from parents and thera-
pists. But teachers, school counselors, friends, and relatives can aid in the
healing process. In this section, I talk about how you can put these people to
work for you and make sure that they do good rather than harm.
How teachers and other 
school staff can help
When PTSD enters the picture, you need to get your child’s school in the
loop. Here are some ways to get your child’s teachers and other school
personnel on your team (and the big advantages of doing so):
 Talk to your child’s teacher(s). Ask for an appointment before or after
school so you can speak privately. If your child has significant symptoms
that interfere with schoolwork or socializing, describe these symptoms to
the teacher and explain the best ways of handling them. Also offer the
teacher some basic information on PTSD to help him understand the dis-
order and how it affects your child. You may also want to put the teacher in
touch with your child’s therapist so they can work together to solve school
problems.
If your child’s schoolwork takes a hit, a teacher who’s in the loop is more
likely to find constructive ways to deal with the problem, such as letting
your child make up for a failed test by doing an extra-credit project at
home. A teacher who’s on your team is also more understanding about
PTSD-related behavior problems in the classroom or on the playground.
 Meet with the principal if necessary. If PTSD causes your child to act
out, a principal who’s aware of your child’s issues will be in a better
position to handle behavior problems in a positive way. Provide the prin-
cipal with the same material you offer your child’s teacher, and ask her
to let you know if she spots problems the two of you can address
together in a positive way.
 Consult with the nurse. Scheduling a meeting with the school nurse is a
good idea if your child has significant symptoms such as panic attacks.
A nurse who’s part of your backup squad may be able to offer a safe
haven to your child if he occasionally needs a place to hide out until he
can get his symptoms under control. Also, make sure you update your
child’s medical information at school to reflect any medications being
prescribed for his PTSD.
310
Part V: Stepping In: When You're Not the One Who's Suffering 

 Chat with the school counselor. If your child’s symptoms affect her
schoolwork or behavior, schedule a talk with the school counselor to
inform him about the situation. A counselor who has the full picture may
be able to offer good suggestions for handling these problems. In addi-
tion, he may be able to steer you to many community resources for both
you and your child.
The key to getting your child’s school on your side is sensitivity. Your daugh-
ter probably doesn’t want to broadcast her PTSD to everyone on campus, so
keep your conversations confidential. Discuss your concerns on the phone
with teachers or other school staff members, or make an appointment to
come in before or after school (and have a ready excuse for your visit handy
if you spot any of your child’s friends). PTSD is nothing to be ashamed of, but
kids can be cruel, and your child needs to share her situation with friends in
her own way.
How to bring friends and 
family into the picture
In Chapter 16, I outline a host of ways in which friends and family members
can lend a hand in the recovery process. These methods are one-size-fits-all
approaches because they work just as well for kids as they do for adults.
There’s one difference, however: Deciding which people to tell about your
child’s PTSD, and exactly what to tell them, can be even trickier than it is for
an adult with this disorder. Here are some suggestions:
 Tell your child before you spread the news. You don’t want a sensitive
child to be blindsided by Uncle Roy (“So I hear you have PTSD. How’s
the therapy going?”). If you decide to discuss your child’s PTSD with
other relatives, let your child know ahead of time and make sure he’s
comfortable with the information you’re giving out.
 Keep your explanations to friends and family upbeat and matter-of-
fact. You can tell Grandma, “We’re very pleased that we’ve found an
excellent doctor who’s helping Alison with some of the symptoms she’s
experiencing as a result of the hurricane.” Another helpful method is to
talk about symptoms that friends and family are likely to witness (“Loud
noises bother Mike, so we’ll probably skip the Fourth of July party this
year”) — but unless people are very close and trusted, don’t go over-
board on the details.
 If your child is young, let her best friends’ parents know a little about
the situation. That way, they’ll be more understanding if your child has
an emotional meltdown or acts in hurtful ways. Describe the behaviors
your child may exhibit and good ways to respond to them, and encour-
age them to talk with you if they have any questions or concerns.
311
Chapter 15: Getting Help for a Child with PTSD

 Be matter-of-fact with a young child’s friends. Your child’s buddies
don’t need a lecture on PTSD, but a little basic info can help keep friend-
ships strong. For instance, you may say, “Right now, Heather feels sad
and upset because she’s remembering her mommy and missing her.
That’s why she sometimes doesn’t feel like playing or talking. But you’re
still her best friend, even if she can’t always show it right now.”
 If your child is a teen, let him choose how to handle the situation. He’ll
probably have two words of advice for you: Butt out! If so, honor his
wishes and let him tell his friends as much (or as little) as he wants
about his PTSD.
One exception: If he says or does hurtful things, you may want to take
his friends or their parents aside and give them a quiet heads-up. If
you’re discreet, you can respect your child’s privacy while keeping his
friends and their families on his side, which can play a big role in his
recovery.

I
f you’re trying to help a loved one with PTSD, you have my sincere
respect, because supporting someone who’s scarred by the deep, invisible
wounds of trauma is a tough job. PTSD can make a person act cold and
uncaring, push others away, or lash out cruelly. Trying to respond to these
behaviors with love and loyalty is a huge task, and you deserve all the credit
in the world for accepting this challenge.
To make your path a little easier, this chapter offers advice about the best ways
to help a person with PTSD, as well as some common missteps to avoid. The
chapter as a whole offers info for anyone who’s trying to help — no matter what
the connection to a person with PTSD — so you can find valuable advice in
every section. However, because different people have different relationships
with a person battling PTSD — parents, partners, extended family, or friends —
I also offer sections tailored to the specifics of each relationship.
I begin by taking a look at the special role a partner or parent plays in the
healing process. Next, I talk about how other family members and friends can
show their love and support. In addition, I talk about the importance of
watching out for your own health and well-being as you reach out to your
loved one with PTSD.

The Biggest Struggle: Coping 
Strategies for Caregivers
If you’re the partner or parent of someone with PTSD, you’re the most impor-
tant player on your loved one’s support team. You may not feel like it, how-
ever, because right now, the person you care about isn’t doing a good job of
caring about you. In fact, you may often feel ignored, unloved, neglected, and
ill-treated. (See Chapter 13 for more on the problems that PTSD causes in a
partner’s or parent’s life.) But if you’re reading this book, most likely you’re
committed to toughing it out and helping your loved one heal, no matter how
rocky the road gets.
The tips I offer throughout this chapter can aid you in that mission. In this
section, however, I offer advice that’s tailored specifically to partners or par-
ents — typically the unsung heroes in a person’s battle against PTSD. Here
are the best ways to help your loved one while keeping your own sanity.
Call for backup!
Living with a person with PTSD is stressful and often unsatisfying because
your loved one can’t meet all your needs when she’s trapped in her own
nightmare. Burning out is easy if you don’t have someone to help you carry
your load. In fact, social support is one of the biggest keys to keeping families
together when they’re battling PTSD. Getting this support isn’t important just
for you — it’s vital to your loved one with PTSD as well.
One place to turn for help is your extended family — aunts, uncles, in-laws, sib-
lings, and grandparents. When these family members can’t help enough — or
when they’re part of the problem — you need to tap other sources. The best idea
is to visit a therapist, either with your loved one or by yourself (see Chapter 13).
Another excellent option is to find other families dealing with PTSD who are
facing the same challenges. These folks know just how it feels to live with a
hubby with a hair-trigger temper, a wife who can’t bear to be touched, or an
adult son or daughter who drinks or uses drugs to mask the pain. They’re
happy to share their wisdom and experience or simply to offer moral support.
Here are two ways to team up with other people who are in the same boat as
you:
 Attend support groups. If your loved one has drug or alcohol problems,
look into groups that focus on these issues. Al-Anon and Families
Anonymous are two of the best-known groups for family members of
people with substance abuse problems. (See Chapter 4 for good ways to
locate a support group in your area.)

 Join a virtual community. Online discussion forums can be outstanding
sources of support and practical advice. (Be careful, however, not to
give away too much personal info in these forums — something that’s
easy to do when you’re having heart-to-heart conversations.) Dozens of
discussion groups are available for partners or parents of people with
PTSD, including this sampling:
• General forum for loved ones of people with PTSD: www.ptsd-
forum.org (click the Chat – Carers link)
• For partners of combat veterans:
forums.grunt.com/forums/123.aspx
groups.msn.com/AftermathofwarcopingwithPTSDtoo
groups.msn.com/LivingwithPTSDVietnamWives (this group
also includes a forum for wives of veterans of other wars)
• For partners of people overcoming sexual or physical abuse:
www.thelighthousesanctuary.com/forum
Even people who don’t know much about PTSD can help if you give them a
chance. Friends, neighbors, church members, and others may be willing to
lend moral support or practical assistance. Be patient if they don’t always
say or do the right things (especially at first). Offer them books or articles, or
steer them to Web sites that can help them understand PTSD (I provide a list
of my favorites in the Appendix).
Know what you can and can’t do
When you love a person with PTSD, you want more than anything to make
that person feel better. But here’s the hard part: Much of the time, you can’t.
The most important thing you need to know to help your loved one is this:
You didn’t cause his PTSD, and you can’t fix it.
Drawing boundary lines between what you can and can’t do maximizes your
power to help and minimizes your risk of frustration and burnout. Here are
some of the things you can do:
 Be a sounding board. Learn to listen without feeling that you need to solve
every problem yourself. You can’t solve all the problems, anyway, because
your loved one has to find solutions on his own. Instead, offer a sympa-
thetic ear and resist the urge to say, “I know just how you can handle that.”
 Recognize that your loved one’s pain is real. A person with PTSD has
deep, unhealed wounds, and she lashes out because she’s in agony.
Acknowledging the reality of PTSD is the only way to understand why she
does hurtful, self-destructive, or off-the-wall things. Do not let anyone tell
you that her problem is “all in her head” or that she can “just get over it.”
(See Chapter 2 for more on the biochemical and physical realities of PTSD.)
315
Chapter 16: Supporting a Loved One with PTSD

 Be patient. Healing from PTSD takes a long time — sometimes a lifetime —
and recovery often follows an ebb-and-flow pattern. Here are two corny
but very true thoughts that many people find helpful in coping with day-
to-day crises:
• “This, too, shall pass.” Change is a fact of life, and your circum-
stances may be very different in a year or two. If your loved one is
in therapy, you may see big changes for the better — but these
changes rarely happen overnight.
• “One day at a time.” Confronting all your problems at once can
overwhelm you. A smarter plan, if you’re overwhelmed by your
responsibilities as a caregiver for a person with PTSD, is to focus
solely on the issues you can deal with today. When you feel like
you’re drowning in crises, pick one you can handle — even if it’s
something small, such as a broken doorknob or a stack of paper-
work that’s piling up — and tackle it.
 Keep up routines. The familiar patterns of life can help anchor a trou-
bled person to reality. Conversely, breaks in routine sometimes cause
distress all by themselves, even for people who don’t have PTSD. In fact,
breaking regular routines can create withdrawal symptoms very similar
to those in people withdrawing from drugs or alcohol! So keep up com-
fortable routines such as Friday-night pizza or weekend bike rides, and
be sensitive to issues that arise if you need to alter those routines.
 Have realistic expectations on big days. Festive occasions like
Thanksgiving and Christmas can be brutal for a person with PTSD
because everyone’s expected to be joyous and loving — something your
loved one may not be able to do. Play it by ear on holidays, birthdays, and
anniversaries, and let your loved one retreat to a quiet place if necessary.
Be especially sensitive about holidays linked to the trauma in some way,
such as a birthday that falls right before or after the anniversary of the
trauma. Remember that a reasonable expectation (what you’d have every
right to expect, under normal circumstances) isn’t the same as a realistic
expectation (what’s likely to happen) — and plan for the latter.
 Take care of your health. Right now, you’re the Rock of Gibraltar for
your loved one, and you can’t be there for him if you fall apart yourself.
So do your best to exercise, eat well, and get sleep. If you have your own
issues with drugs or alcohol, seek help. Take care of your mental and
emotional health as well (see the section “Make sure you don’t get lost
in the mix,” later in this chapter, for advice).
 Recognize and accept that both of you are scared. You’re both fright-
ened by the alarming symptoms and unpredictable course of PTSD. If
the person with PTSD is your partner, you may also be scared that ther-
apy will change your relationship — and scared that it won’t. In addi-
tion, you may also be afraid that if your loved one heals, she won’t love
or need you as much. When you spot these fears and face them hon-
estly, getting past them and tackling the hard work of recovery is easier.
316
Part V: Stepping In: When You're Not the One Who's Suffering 

Now here are some of the things you can’t do and the burdens you shouldn’t
try to shoulder:
 You can’t handle your loved one’s troubles alone. Often, families
coping with PTSD try to hide their problems from the world and tough it
out on their own. But when you mix PTSD with denial and secrecy, you
create a toxic cocktail that’s bound to poison your relationship. Worse,
this situation leaves you as your family member’s therapist, caretaker,
and problem-solver — a burden that causes resentment and sky-high
stress levels (see more on this in Chapter 13). If your loved one refuses
to seek help, seek it for yourself.
 You can’t turn your family into the Brady Bunch. The household of a
person who’s suffering from PTSD can easily become a battleground.
That’s especially true if
• Your loved one’s PTSD includes serious problems with anger or
other emotional meltdowns.
• Your family includes kids — especially if you have one or more
teenagers with big attitude.
• You’re a parent whose adult child has moved back home after you
and your spouse have gotten used to having your home to yourself —
and you’re discovering that three’s a crowd.
You can easily tie yourself in knots trying to keep the peace in your
household, but you probably won’t succeed. Instead, if things get out of
control, seek out a therapist and ask for ideas on handling stressful situa-
tions. If your partner or child with PTSD says no to family therapy, go
yourself — and if you have kids, bring them along too. That way, the ther-
apist — not you! — can shoulder responsibility for helping everyone sort
out the mess. Or if the budget’s tight, check out support groups for fami-
lies dealing with PTSD. (For help in finding these groups, see Chapter 4.)
 You can’t always be Pollyanna. PTSD shattered many of your dreams,
so feeling resentful or angry is natural — especially if you’re dealing with
a loved one’s alcohol or drug problems or if you’re struggling financially
because of your family member’s disability. Don’t feel guilty if you let
your happy mask slip once in a while. You don’t need to be a saint to
help your loved one; in fact, sainthood can irk the heck out of a family
member with PTSD who’s feeling pretty imperfect himself.
Make sure you don’t get lost in the mix
Fran, a patient I saw years ago, coined the phrase “Cheshire Cat Syndrome” —
a concept that may ring a bell with many family members of people with
PTSD. Fran spent her life trying to please her parents, lovers, friends, and 
317
Chapter 16: Supporting a Loved One with PTSD

co-workers while ignoring her own needs. As a result, she felt like the Cheshire
Cat in Alice in Wonderland, fading out of the picture, leaving nothing but a
perky smile behind. “I’m afraid I’m going to disappear altogether,” she told me.
It’s not hard to spot a Cheshire Cat in a family dealing with PTSD. Cheshire
Cats watch only the TV shows that their loved ones like. They never express
political opinions that could make their family members angry. They don’t
travel if their loved ones can’t handle trips. They avoid friends and family
members whom their family members don’t like. They spend their days
trying to figure out what makes Bob or Jane happy — and as time goes on,
they forget to ask, “What makes me happy?” In the following sections, I
explain why falling into this self-denying pattern is unhealthy, how you can
tell if you’re doing it, and how to get back to a healthy relationship.
Seeing the importance of a healthy balance
In Chapter 13, I talk about what to do if you’re in a codependent relationship —
a problem that occurs when one person, in order to keep the peace and pre-
vent confrontations, lets another person fall into a pattern of selfish and self-
destructive behavior. There are effective ways to turn around a codependent
relationship, but it’s far better to avoid falling into one in the first place.
If you’re showing signs of Cheshire Cat Syndrome (see the section intro),
that’s a big warning sign that you’re becoming codependent because you’re
starting to neglect your own needs in order to avoid arguments or other emo-
tional upsets. Now’s the time to change your behavior, and in turn, your
loved one’s.
This change is important because denying your own needs hurts both you
and the person with PTSD. Over time, it makes you resentful and frustrated —
and it makes you less an ally than a hostage to your loved one. It harms your
loved one, too, because it allows her to fall deeper into maladaptive behavior
patterns that reinforce her PTSD instead of helping her conquer it.
Determining whether your scales are tipped
If you suspect that caring for a person with PTSD is causing you to sacrifice
your own needs (and make your loved one overly dependent in the process),
here’s a quick quiz. Ask yourself the following two questions, rating your
answers on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 representing none and 10 representing all:
 How much of your energy do you devote to pleasing, comforting, 
protecting, or caring for your loved one with PTSD?
 How much of your energy do you devote to pleasing, comforting, 
protecting, or caring for yourself?
318
Part V: Stepping In: When You're Not the One Who's Suffering 

If your two scores are the same or close together — say, 6 and 4 or 5 and 5 —
that’s healthy. If you answer 7 to the question about your loved one and 3 to
the question about yourself, you’re veering into Cheshire Cat territory. And if
you say 9 and 1, you’re sitting right in his tree.
Balancing your needs (and wants) with your loved one’s
The solution to balancing your needs — not easy, but doable — is to start
focusing more on your own needs and less on the other person’s. Here are
three ways to do that:
 Once a week, stop and ask yourself, “What can I do today to make myself
feel better?” Whether it’s a soak in the tub with a good book, a round of
golf, or a phone call to a friend, do it. When you get into the habit, take
this step at least once every day.
 Make a list of five things you used to enjoy doing but don’t do now
because of your loved one’s PTSD. Then ask yourself, “Is there a way I
can still do these things?” If your family member can’t face traveling, for
example, maybe you and a friend can take short out-of-town hops. If she
refuses to let your relatives visit, maybe you can put them up in a hotel
and spend time with them away from your home. Instead of giving up
the things you love, find creative ways to work them into your life.
 Here’s the biggie: Start letting the person with PTSD solve his own prob-
lems. This step is very, very difficult if you’re a kind-hearted person
who’s fallen into the trap of letting your family member shove his
responsibilities onto you. It’s also hard if you’re trying to keep your
house safe and sane for children. A therapist can help you discover
ways to avoid the co-dependency trap and point you in a healthier direc-
tion (see Chapter 13).
Recognize that you’re not the problem
Your self-esteem may take a nosedive when you’re the primary caregiver for a
person with PTSD. Even after getting a diagnosis, your loved one may still
turn denial into an art form by blaming you for problems that really stem
from PTSD. Here are the types of accusations you may hear:
 From a person with anger issues: “Of course I’m mad all the time. It’s
because you let the kids make so much X#$% noise!”
 From a loved one with avoidance issues: “I wouldn’t hide out in the den
if you’d stop inviting those annoying friends of yours over.”
319
Chapter 16: Supporting a Loved One with PTSD

 From someone who’s hypervigilant: “No, I’m not relaxed. Nobody can
relax with that stupid TV on. Do you have to watch that show every
week?”
 From a person who’s linking to an earlier betrayal: “Yes, I’m crying. It’s
the biggest holiday of the year, and you got me a dumb ring I don’t like.”
If you fall for these lines, you can wind up thinking you’re inadequate, unlov-
able, or guilty of causing your loved one’s troubles — or you can wind up
yelling back and saying hurtful things in return (“Maybe I’m not the greatest
wife in the world, but hey, buddy, you’re not exactly a prize yourself!”).
Identifying your loved one’s hurtful words as symptoms of PTSD, on the
other hand, can help you get a handle on them. Once again (am I starting to
sound like a broken record?), a therapist can help by showing you how to
sort the wheat of real family issues from the chaff of PTSD.
Special Guidance for Partners 
of People with PTSD
If your partner has PTSD, you have two extra issues to consider. One of these
issues, of course, is sexuality: How can you cope if PTSD is dousing the
flames of romance? Another is the $64,000 question: Should you stay in your
relationship if PTSD is making your life a wreck? In this section, I help you get
a handle on both of these questions.
Coping when love turns to neglect
When Audrey’s husband Chuck came home from the war, she anticipated
romantic evenings and lots of hugs and cuddles. What she got, instead, was
excuses: “I really don’t feel good,” “Maybe tomorrow night,” and “I just need
some sleep.” She was devastated and felt unattractive and inadequate. She
didn’t realize that Chuck’s responses had nothing to do with her and every-
thing to do with PTSD. (See Chapter 3 for info on how PTSD can make a
person feel distant or unromantic.)
The key to coping with this problem is to understand that you can’t make
your partner desire you. If candlelight, soft music, and a come-hither look do
nothing to stir romance in your partner’s soul, don’t feel like a failure. Loss 
of sexual desire is a primary symptom of PTSD, especially if your partner
320
Part V: Stepping In: When You're Not the One Who's Suffering 

experienced a sexual assault. Only time and therapy can solve this problem,
so don’t think it’s your responsibility to seduce an iceberg. Be patient — and
if your partner is afraid of physical contact or intimacy, point him to the sug-
gestions in Chapter 12 for overcoming this problem.
Deciding whether to stay or leave
Dana said, “It was awful at first. He said he didn’t love me anymore and he
wanted to leave. When I tried to get close, he pushed me away. For a while,
he even moved out and lived on his own. But once he got therapy, things got
better. We still take it one day at a time, but I’m glad I stayed.”
That story is a common one in PTSD families. Often, a person with PTSD will
shove you away just when she needs you most desperately. If you firmly
believe that she’s the person you want to spend your life with, try to stay
connected even if she’s acting distant or cold. In some cases, you may want
to try a separation rather than file for divorce — or live in different houses
for a time while you sort things out.
You’re the only one who can know whether a relationship is worth the pain
that PTSD puts you through. If not, cutting ties is the right move. But if you
sense that you and your partner have something worth fighting for, stay
strong and give therapy a chance — and then another chance. Even if your
loved one walks out on you, keep the lines of communication open through
phone calls, letters, or e-mails.
Be aware of one big exception: Never, never stay with a partner who’s physi-
cally dangerous or so emotionally abusive that you or your children are at
risk. No one benefits, and everyone suffers, if you allow your partner to
abuse you or your kids. What’s more, walking out the door can be the best
gift you can give a person with PTSD if it jolts him into getting help for his
destructive behavior. If you stay, on the other hand, you give your partner
permission to continue on a downward spiral. Worse, you run the risk that
you or your children will develop PTSD as a result of his abuse.
Also be aware that no matter how hard you try to keep your relationship on
track, overcoming the obstacles may be impossible. PTSD breaks up many
wonderful, loving couples. For example, the National Vietnam Readjustment
Study (1990) indicates that Vietnam vets with PTSD divorce twice as often as
those without PTSD and are three times more likely to have multiple
divorces. If you give your relationship your best shot and it doesn’t work out,
don’t sit around wondering whether you could’ve done something different
to save your relationship. Almost assuredly, the answer is no.

Special Guidance for Parents 
of Adults with PTSD
In helping a loved one with PTSD, parents are often the brave souls on the
front lines. What’s more, moms and dads can often help in ways that no one
else can (for instance, by spotting behavior changes that other relatives over-
look — after all, nobody knows a kid like Mom or Dad does.) Sometimes how-
ever, it’s hard to know where to draw the line when you’re aiding a grown
child with PTSD. (For info on helping a young child or teen, see Chapter 15).
Here’s some helpful guidance on parenting an adult child who’s battling this
disorder.
Handle family disagreements wisely
One problem that often arises when an adult child with PTSD lives with her
folks is that Mom and Dad disagree over how much to help her. For instance,
Dad may say, “Letting her live here rent-free isn’t helping her to recover —
it’s just letting her avoid real life.” Mom, on the other hand, may argue, “She
322
Part V: Stepping In: When You're Not the One Who's Suffering 
A tale of two couples
It was love at first sight for David and Lucy. Six
months after they met, he proposed to her on
the beach and gave her a ring hidden in a
seashell. Everything was hearts and flowers —
until the night she went out for a quick jog and
an attacker raped her at knifepoint.
For two years afterward, Lucy couldn’t bear a
man’s touch. David went to group therapy with
her, gave her space to heal, and agreed to post-
pone the wedding — twice. “I kept backing off,”
Lucy said, “but he kept saying, ‘I’ll wait.’”
David did wait, and as Lucy gained control over
her PTSD, she got brave enough to commit.
Three years later, the couple was expecting
their first child.
Rita was just as supportive when her husband,
Ed, returned from Iraq. She was the first to 
recognize the warning signs of PTSD, even
before Ed did. She encouraged Ed to seek therapy
and took a second job to pay the bills when his
symptoms kept him from getting work in the
civilian world.
“We both tried so hard,” she said. “But Ed just
couldn’t take the pressure of being in a rela-
tionship anymore. We tried a separation, but it
was too painful to keep getting together and
splitting up, so we finally divorced. But he’s still
my best friend, and I love him dearly.”
David and Rita both did everything humanly pos-
sible when it came to holding their relationships
together, but only one of them lucked out. The
moral of their stories is that “happily ever after”
is possible when a partner has PTSD, but there
are no guarantees.

needs a safe place while she’s healing — and she doesn’t need financial bur-
dens right now.” If disagreements like these arise, here are some smart ways
to handle them:
 Agree to discuss your issues at a time when your son or daughter isn’t
around. That way, you can air your differences openly, without adding to
your child’s stress. With luck, you’ll be able to compromise on a plan
you can both accept.
 If you can’t agree on what actions you should take, schedule a session
with a family therapist who can help you sort through your differences.
If that’s not in your budget, a member of the clergy may be able to help.
 If your child gives you permission, talk with her therapist. This profes-
sional has a good handle on what your child needs right now and can
help you both understand the actions you should or shouldn’t take.
A different situation arises if your adult child is married and you disagree
with your child’s partner about PTSD-related issues — for example, what kind
of therapy your child should try. In this case, the smartest course is to offer
your suggestions tactfully but also respect and support the decisions your
child and his partner make. One exception: If you firmly believe your child’s
behavior is endangering his life or other people’s (for example, if he appears
suicidal or has bouts of violent anger that endanger his children), then argue
forcefully for intervention even if you risk straining the bonds with your
child’s partner.
Make your help as temporary as possible
Sometimes letting a young adult child fly from the nest is difficult, and that’s
especially true when your child has PTSD. But adult children need to spread
their wings in order to grow and mature — so let your child stay at home and
mend while it’s necessary, but also facilitate independence.
Here are some questions that can help you determine whether you’re provid-
ing necessary support or merely babying an adult child with PTSD and pre-
venting your son or daughter from becoming independent:
 Does your child help out around the house and chip in financially to
the extent that she can? Or does she treat you like an unpaid maid
and your house like a hotel? If you spot the latter pattern, you’re slip-
ping into codependency (see Chapter 13). Look for areas in which your
child is capable of lending a hand and expect her to do so instead of 
letting her act like a permanent guest.
323
Chapter 16: Supporting a Loved One with PTSD

 Does your child talk about being independent in the future? If not,
gently bring up the topic yourself. You don’t need to set a firm deadline,
especially if he’s battling serious PTSD symptoms right now, but do talk
about “when you’re back at work” or “when you have your own place”
so he knows he needs to face adult responsibilities again when he’s
better.
 Is your child actively seeking help for his PTSD or related problems
such as substance abuse? If not, make it crystal clear that you expect
her to take steps to promote her own recovery. You can’t force an adult
child to get help, but you can strongly encourage her.
As your child heals from PTSD, taper the amount of support you offer and let
him start standing on his own two legs again. Let him know that you’re
always there to offer emotional support but that you trust him to take charge
of his own life. For instance, if he gets a job, you can say, “That’s great that
you’re getting back on your feet. And after you get your own bills paid off,
you can start pitching in on our phone and electricity bills. We’ll really appre-
ciate the help!” That’s not being mean — it’s acknowledging your child’s heal-
ing and promoting his growing independence.
When the Sufferer Is Your Friend or a
Member of Your Extended Family
Think of family and friends, and you picture holiday get-togethers, backyard
barbecues, and weddings. If your friend or relative has PTSD, however, life’s
not all sunshine and laughter.
If you know that fact and you’re still sticking by a person with PTSD, you’re a
true-blue friend, and your friendship can be powerful medicine for someone
who’s battling this monster. In this section, I give you tips on how you can
help and a few cautions about mistakes to avoid.
Be there
Loneliness is a heavy burden for someone with PTSD. Your friend is suffering,
and she needs to talk about her pain with people she trusts, but right now
she’s probably afraid to open up to you because she thinks you won’t 
understand.
324
Part V: Stepping In: When You're Not the One Who's Suffering 

In a sense, she’s right: If you don’t have PTSD, you can’t really picture the
depth of the suffering it causes. You don’t need to understand everything
your friend is going through, however. All you need to do is be there and be
supportive. Here are the best ways to do that:
 Be honest. It’s human nature to comfort traumatized people by saying,
“Don’t worry; it’ll be okay,” or “Just get your mind off it, and you’ll feel
better.” But PTSD is real, and it’s serious. Accept this fact. Don’t try to
pretend that everything’s just dandy when it’s not.
 Let your friend talk. Listening to the details of a rape, a bombing, or a
car wreck is painful and upsetting. But your friend needs to talk openly
to someone who won’t shut him out, so do your best to hear him out.
Equally important, respect his wishes if he asks you not to share secrets
he tells you in confidence. (See “Know when to nix confidentiality,” later
in this chapter, for an exception to this rule.)
 Offer practical help. Sometimes, an extra pair of hands is as useful as a
shoulder to cry on. If you know that your friend doesn’t have a car right
now, offer to drive her to therapy. If her family is going through a rough
patch, invite her kids to stay with yours for a weekend so that everyone
can cool off.
 Inject some fun into tough times. Because you’re close to your friend,
you know what makes him smile. So watch a silly movie with him, toss a
baseball together, or hit the computer store and pick up some new video
games. If your friend vetoes one plan, realize that it may be too threaten-
ing because of his triggers, and suggest another option.
 Encourage healthy habits. Now’s not the time to nag your friend about
smoking or a junk-food diet. But if you can think of positive ways to get
her into a healthy groove, you’ll do her a big favor. Take nightly walks
together, for example, or go for hikes or bike rides.
 Know when to butt out. Your friend needs support, not advice or lec-
tures. Share with him your thoughts about how PTSD affects his life, but
let him find his own answers. It’s okay to say something like, “I found an
interesting book on PTSD,” but resist the urge to say something like, “You
really need to read this book.” Also, be sensitive to the fact that his part-
ner, parents, or very close family members should play the primary role
in helping him make decisions, with you serving as the supporting bench.
 Offer validation. The trauma your friend suffered shook her world, and
she’s not sure who she is anymore. You can help her by reminding her of
all the things that make her special. If she says, “I just feel so stupid,”
remind her by saying something like this: “You’re not stupid. You’re the
one who got me through algebra, remember? You’re just hurting right
now. You are strong and wonderful and smart, and you will get through
this. And I’ll be here to help you.”
325
Chapter 16: Supporting a Loved One with PTSD

Be informed
You can’t walk a mile in your friend’s shoes — and you wouldn’t want to —
but books, articles, and Internet sites can give you a basic idea of what PTSD
is all about. This knowledge can help you put brush-offs or outbursts into
perspective so that you know when to think, “He’s a jerk,” and when to think,
“He’s really hurting, so I’m not going to get angry.”
This book, of course, is a good start. You can also find valuable info at these
sites:
 The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs’ National Center for PTSD site,
www.ncptsd.va.gov
 The Sidran Institute, www.sidran.org
 The National Child Traumatic Stress Network, nctsnet.org
 The National Institute of Mental Health’s PTSD site, www.nimh.nih.
gov/healthinformation/ptsdmenu.cfm
Here are two other ways you can help a friend in need:
 Do some detective work. If your friend doesn’t have the medical care or
social support she needs, see whether you can find resources in your
area. Check out Chapter 4 for ideas on locating support groups and
Chapter 6 for ways to find free or low-cost therapy if money is an issue.
But don’t be surprised if your friend doesn’t follow up on your leads
right away. Often, people with PTSD are in denial, and it takes time for
them to realize that they need help. Offer information, but don’t push.
 Surf the Net. To get an insider’s view of your friend’s battle with PTSD,
visit Internet forums. Some useful ones include
• PTSD Forum at www.ptsdforum.org
• The Broken Spirits Network at www.brokenspirits.com
• Trauma Anonymous at www.bein.com/trauma
People in these forums — both survivors and their loved ones — appre-
ciate the fact that you’re trying to help a friend, and they can often offer
insight or advice. Just remember that no two people are alike, so what
works for another person may or may not work for you.
Be realistic
The biggest fact you need to face is that your friend is different now, and he
probably always will be. A big dividing line in his mind separates before the
trauma from after the trauma. Even if you knew him inside-and-out before he
326
Part V: Stepping In: When You're Not the One Who's Suffering 

developed PTSD, you may never fully grasp the changes your friend went
through when trauma turned his life inside out. Those changes can include
 A loss of beliefs your friend once shared with you, such as religious con-
victions or opinions about fairness and justice
 A loss of trust in other people
 A loss of confidence in the future
 A loss of innocence and lack of interest in innocent pleasures you once
shared
 A new fear of getting too close to someone who may leave or die
When you recognize and accept these changes, you find it easier to let go of
what was and accept what is. Maybe your friend doesn’t want to go clubbing
anymore. Maybe she’s no longer the happy, carefree person you used to hang
out with. Maybe he wants to keep you at arm’s length instead of treating you
like a brother. But you can start from where you both are now and build a
new, different relationship that works for both of you.
Be realistic, too, about the up-and-down pattern of PTSD. Because this condi-
tion is a wild roller-coaster ride, your friend may be smart, funny, and warm
one day and a blank-eyed stranger the next. She also may take some deep
slides into anger, despair, or self-harm. If you get to the point where you can’t
stand to watch your friend’s hurtful or self-destructive acts, keep your dis-
tance for a while — but always let her know that the door’s open when she’s
ready to return your friendship.
Know when to nix confidentiality
Keep your heart-to-heart talks confidential unless you have your friend’s per-
mission to share them. That advice is almost always good, but be aware of
one exception: If you pick up clues that your friend is suicidal, you need to
act. Taking action is especially important if your friend
 Says he’s actively thinking about ways to kill himself
 Asks you to take care of the people he loves if he’s not around any longer
 Was very depressed and suddenly seems very agitated
If you spot these red flags, tell your friend’s partner, other relatives, or anyone
else you can trust (such as a pastor or doctor). In doing so, you may destroy
trust and lose a friendship — but that’s better than risking your friend’s life.
If you’re not sure whether your friend is suicidal, call your local suicide-
prevention line and tell someone about your concerns. Whoever takes the
call can help you decide what steps to take.

In this part . . .
I
n this part, I mix some practical information with a
little bit of fun. I start by debunking ten myths about
PTSD and offering some facts in their place. Then I offer
ten signs — big and small — that you’re on the road to
healing.

The Ten Most Common 
Myths about PTSD
In This Chapter
 The myths that other people believe
 The myths you may buy into
 The myths that can stand in the way of treatment
W
inston Churchill once said that “a lie gets halfway around the world
before the truth has a chance to get its pants on.” That goes for
errors, half-truths, and downright silly ideas, too — and if you have PTSD,
you’ll hear lots of them.
If your friends and family inflict foolish advice on you, don’t hold it against
them, because they probably mean well. Just be ready with the facts so you
can do your part to dispel the tall tales that many people believe. Here are
ten of the biggest whoppers you’re likely to hear (and even a few you may tell
yourself), along with the facts to counter them.
PTSD Isn’t Real
Wouldn’t it be nice if PTSD were merely a figment of your imagination, like
unicorns or leprechauns? Unfortunately, that’s not the case. The symptoms
of PTSD stem from biochemical and physiological changes, and those
changes affect everything from your blood pressure to your digestive system.
They’re as real as the symptoms of pneumonia or bunions — so don’t let
anyone tell you otherwise.
In one way, of course, PTSD is largely “in your head.” That’s because PTSD
changes the chemistry of your brain (and apparently its structure and wiring

as well). Experts can actually see evidence of some of those changes in labo-
ratory tests and brain scans, which means that they’re far from imaginary.
Only Soldiers Get PTSD
The idea that PTSD is a “soldier’s problem” that stems only from combat is a
common misconception. In part, that’s because the first insights about PTSD
came from combat vets. Also, war is indeed one of the biggest risk factors for
PTSD. (One study of Vietnam combat vets, conducted in 1992, found that
they were six times more likely to have PTSD than men who never saw
combat.)
But in truth, anyone from a kindergartener to a corporate CEO can develop
severe symptoms following a trauma. What’s more, as I explain in Chapter 2,
any horrifying situation — not just battle — has the potential to cause PTSD.
People with PTSD Are Weak
Movies and TV shows send the message that heroes can withstand terrible
abuse and bounce right back. For instance, spaceship captains are attacked by
hideous aliens, sucked into time warps, shot at, swallowed by slime monsters,
you name it — and the next week, they’re right back at the helm, just as perky
as ever.
In real life, however, trauma takes a toll on everyone, and brave people don’t
have any special powers that make them immune from developing long-term
symptoms. In fact, the braver you are, the more likely you are to get in a 
situation that can provoke PTSD. That’s why the people at highest risk for
PTSD include those who willingly take on dangerous jobs: firefighters, police
officers, and soldiers. These people ain’t sissies — and neither are you.
Time Heals All Wounds
People with good intentions often say, “Give it time — you’ll get over it.” If
you have PTSD, don’t take this advice. If you’re a friend or relative, don’t give
it. In reality, PTSD is like an infected wound: It’s not likely to heal on its own,
and without special treatment, it’s likely to fester. That’s why therapy, not
time, is the best medicine.
332
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Waiting for time to heal your PTSD can backfire in a big way because PTSD
alters your thinking and behavior in ways that create secondary problems —
drug or alcohol issues, financial problems, broken relationships. After PTSD
messes with how you live your life, causing you to develop bad habits (bad =
they make things worse for you), recovery can be further complicated by the
need to unlearn those habits before you can replace them with good habits.
Thus, the best time to treat PTSD is before it complicates your life any further.
Therapy Will Dissolve All Your Troubles
Here’s the truth: Lots of your troubles probably stem from PTSD. But if you
didn’t have PTSD, you’d still have troubles. Remembering this point as you go
through therapy is important so you don’t expect the impossible. Therapy can
make your life better, but it won’t make it perfect. Instead, with luck, it’ll give
you the energy, strength, and confidence to handle your remaining problems
after the weight of PTSD lifts.
Blocking Traumatic Memories 
Is Easier than Facing Them
Here’s a quick exercise: Try not to think about a pig in a pink tutu. Now, try
again not to think about a pig in a pink tutu. Now, try again . . .
Okay, you get the picture. Several seconds ago, you didn’t have the least urge
to think about a pig in a pink tutu. Now, however, you have to work hard to
avoid conjuring up this picture (and you’re probably not succeeding). What’s
more, the pig ballerina in this exercise isn’t “loaded” — that is, it’s not a
memory etched into your brain by trauma and kept captive by brain chemi-
cals that refuse to let it go.
What’s the point? That the memories that grab onto you in PTSD don’t just
politely disappear if you try to shove them away. Ironically, the more energy
you devote to ignoring bad feelings, the more you feed them. Why? Because
those feelings need you to hear them out — they’re there for a reason! So
until you listen to them, explore them, and let yourself start working with
them, they’ll continue to intrude, and your efforts to clamp a lid on them will
exhaust you. To do that, you need to team up with a therapist.
333
Chapter 17: The Ten Most Common Myths about PTSD

It Can’t Be PTSD — It’s Been Too Long
PTSD doesn’t always show up right on schedule after a terrible event.
Sometimes, especially if you suffered abuse as a child, it can rear its head
years or even decades after a trauma is over. (See Chapter 2 for details.)
One common scenario occurs when a second trauma, often but not always
related to the first one, dredges up long-submerged memories of the original
event. For instance,
 A veteran of a long-ago war may come through his own combat traumas
without experiencing PTSD, only to have symptoms develop many years
later when his own child goes off to fight another war.
 A woman who had an extremely difficult labor and delivery may do fine
but then develop PTSD following a second difficult birth.
 A person injured in a serious car wreck may come through seemingly
unscathed but then experience a meltdown years later when she goes
on an amusement park ride that makes her re-experience the same feel-
ings of danger and loss of control.
If you experience delayed PTSD, the event that led to your PTSD was so 
horrible that you did whatever you could at the time to just survive it. You got
past it, but you never got completely over it. It created a deep crack in your
psyche and well-being that you hid from yourself and everyone else — like
turning a crack in a vase to the back, where nobody (including you) could see
it. But because that crack never healed completely, it left you with a vulnera-
bility that could be reopened years later by even a small triggering incident.
Speaking of backs, many people have lower back pain problems from an
injury but manage to get by for years with only a few twinges. Then one day
they reach for something small in the wrong way and bang! — they’re flat on
their backs for a week. Delayed PTSD can lay you low in much the same way.
PTSD Causes Violence
Only a small percentage of people with PTSD commit serious acts of violence;
it just seems like a common occurrence because the media blows these cases
out of proportion. (Did you ever see a movie about the hundreds of thousands
of Vietnam veterans who didn’t commit violent acts? Probably not.) In reality,
people with PTSD are far, far more likely to commit acts of violence against
themselves in the form of alcoholism, drug abuse, self-injury, or eating dis-
orders. True, people with complex PTSD for instance, combat veterans or
people who were chronically abused as children — are at higher-than-normal
334
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

risk for episodes of violence, but only a minority of people with complex PTSD
has this problem.
That said, you need to take violent thoughts or urges very seriously and have
them immediately addressed by a professional. The same is true for suicidal
thoughts or urges. And if you find yourself abusing a partner or child, get
help right away (see the emergency numbers listed in the Appendix).
You Deserve to Feel Bad for Making
Mistakes When Your 
Trauma Happened
Guilt is often a healthy thing. Like a stern schoolteacher, it can make you see
the error of your ways and prevent you from making the same mistakes over
and over.
At other times, however, guilt is simply a sadistic thug. Often, it blames you
for things you didn’t do or makes you feel terrible for reacting in perfectly
normal, logical, and human ways. For instance, someone who survived the
World Trade Center attack may feel guilty if she ran away instead of helping
others — even though running away was a smart and logical thing to do, and
staying probably would’ve gotten her killed.
If you’re using guilt to avoid therapy — if you’re saying to yourself, “I deserve
this punishment because I survived and other people didn’t” — then recog-
nize this as an excuse. Unless you’re a robber, rapist, or Mother Nature, you
didn’t knowingly and willingly do anything to cause your trauma. What’s more,
when it happened, you did the best you could to get through it. So you don’t
deserve the pain you’re living with, and both you and your loved ones will be
happier as soon as you let go of your guilt and start on the road to healing.
You Don’t Have the Time 
or Money for Therapy
In Chapter 6, I describe some low-cost or inexpensive ways to get therapy,
such as community clinics, support groups, and pastoral counseling through
a church — so no excuses there! Also, therapy takes only a few hours of your
life each week, and it doesn’t last any longer than you need it to. PTSD, on the
other hand, is an uninvited guest that plans on staying forever, unless you
chase it off. That definitely makes confronting your PTSD the better choice.

Chapter 18
Ten Ways to Recognize that You’re
Getting Better
In This Chapter
 The big signs of healing
 The small signs that you’re recovering
 The return of your interest in life
S
ometimes, events announce themselves with a big fanfare — the first
squawk of a newborn, for example, or fireworks on the Fourth of July. At
other times, the signs are subtle, such as the nip in the air that tells you
Halloween’s approaching or (ugh) the first gray hair that signals that you’re
really a grownup now.
As you heal from PTSD, you can see both clear and subtle signs of recovery.
Spotting these signs can give you renewed motivation to keep moving for-
ward, even if you still have some big hills to climb. Here’s a sampling of clues,
both large and small, that you’re on the mend.
You Avoid a Blowup or Meltdown
PTSD can short-circuit your control over your emotions, causing your feel-
ings to explode like champagne from a shaken bottle. No matter how hard
you try, keeping your tears, anger, or fear from boiling over may be impos-
sible sometimes.
As you heal, you start getting a handle on your emotions. Tense situations start
to have less effect on you, and you stay calm (or even find something to laugh
about) when problems pop up. You know you’re making progress on this front
if you keep your cool during an argument with your partner, a spat with your
kids, or a tension-packed meeting at work — or even if you handle a frustrating
encounter with your cable company without using any four-letter words.

338
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
You Become an Optimist
If you ever saw the musical Annie, you probably remember Little Orphan
Annie’s famous lyric “The sun’ll come out tomorrow.” When you have PTSD,
you feel just the opposite way: You’re pretty sure that even if today’s going
okay, the skies will cloud up and lightning will strike you the next day. You
may think, “It’s great to get this job, but I don’t expect it to last,” or “It’s no use
saying yes to this date because it’s just going to be another bad experience.”
When PTSD’s grip starts to loosen, your inner Annie peeks out again. Instead of
expecting the worst, you start to think that maybe — just maybe — tomorrow
will be a good day. You may catch yourself saying, “I’m going to the picnic
tomorrow because it might be really fun,” or “I should interview for that posi-
tion; I probably have a shot at it.” These thoughts are big signs of healing
because they mean you’re ready to seek out happiness instead of spending
all your time fearing misery.
You Turn “I Can’t” into “I Can”
In a thousand different ways, PTSD limits your life by telling you that you
can’t do the things you want to do: take a cab, go to the store, board a plane,
trust a loyal friend, or maybe even walk to your mailbox. And with each can’t,
your world shrinks a little bit more.
The first time you conquer one of these I can’t thoughts and instead say, “I
can” — a step you can take safely in therapy (see Chapters 8 and 10) — you
feel your horizons expanding. Each I can gets easier than the last one, so no
matter how large or small that first I can is, chalk it up as a major victory.
You Widen Your Circle of Friends
People with PTSD often shed friends like a duck sheds water, for reasons I
talk about in Chapters 14 and 16. As a result, you can wind up feeling very
much alone. As you recover from PTSD, you eventually spot this big hole in
your life and start getting the urge to call up old buddies, make new friends,
or patch up problems with the people you hurt when PTSD made you act in
destructive ways. That itch to reconnect with people, like the itchy scab 
over a skinned knee, is a powerful sign of healing.

339
Chapter 18: Ten Ways to Recognize that You're Getting Better
You Feel Another Person’s Pain or Joy
If you have PTSD, your mind tries to protect you from excruciating emotions
by making you feel numb to all emotions. Often, it does such a good job of
wallpapering over your feelings that you have trouble feeling empathy even
for the people closest to you. When that iceberg starts to thaw, you once again
begin to care about the people around you. You see the first signs of this
progress in little ways: a surge of sympathy for a co-worker who’s divorcing, a
thrill of pride when your child brings home a good report card, or a rush of
love for a parent or partner who stood by you in your battle against PTSD.
You Say, “I Like You” — to Yourself
PTSD reminds me of the little devil sitting on a cartoon character’s shoulder.
At every turn (and especially when you’re facing a challenge), it whispers
destructive remarks like, “You can’t do this,” “You’re weak,” “Nothing ever
turns out right for you,” and “You’re a loser.”
Healing teaches you that all these lines are bogus. Instead, you learn to 
recognize your strengths — including the strength that helped you survive
your trauma and start on the path to healing. You know you’re making this
change for the better when you catch yourself thinking things like, “I’m proud
of myself,” “I’m strong enough to deal with this problem,” and “I deserve this
happy relationship.”
You Take a Leap of Faith
For a long time, PTSD kept you from trusting other people. You built a brick
wall between yourself and the world and added an extra strand of barbed wire
on the top each time you spotted somebody trying to climb over that wall.
Therapy can help you identify the reasons for this distrust and overcome
them. You know you’re starting to trust again if you hear yourself saying,
“Sure, I’d like to go to out with you,” or “Yes, I’d like to be your friend.” Or if
you’re already in a relationship, you may even startle a longtime partner by
making a big commitment, saying something like, “Let’s get married,” or
“Maybe it is time to start a family.”

You Enjoy Skipping Down Memory Lane
For people with PTSD, snapshots or videos from the time before trauma struck
can be powerful reminders of lost innocence, hope, love, and happiness. As a
result, trauma survivors often feel pain instead of pleasure when they flip
through the pages of a family album or pop in a video from earlier days.
As you come to terms with your trauma, old memories can take their rightful
place in your life, especially when you start to look forward to your future.
You may find yourself smiling at the same home movies that used to upset
you or feeling warm and fuzzy rather than bereft and abandoned when you
come across a picture of a lost loved one.
You Wake Up with the Sun
People who don’t have PTSD can’t know how hard it is to face each new day.
Getting started in the morning is especially hard if you’re battling both PTSD
and depression, a tag team that leaves you feeling so low that just putting
your feet into your slippers is an act of courage.
In therapy, you discover that the rest of your life doesn’t have to revolve
around PTSD. In fact, you find that each new day can bring good surprises
and happy times. In addition, you get a handle on your bad dreams and
spend less time lying awake in the dark. You may find yourself throwing back
the covers and greeting each morning with anticipation rather than the usual
sense of dread — a clear sign that life is getting better.
You Get Back into the Swing of Things
What lit up your life before trauma struck? Maybe you cared deeply about
politics or donated your time to charity work. You may have lived for major-
league baseball or opera, collected salt shakers, worked in macramé, or
raised potbellied pigs.
Whatever your passions, you probably abandoned many of them when 
PTSD focused all your attention on your internal demons. As you chase 
those demons away, you find yourself rekindling old interests or taking up
new hobbies — a very healthy sign. So if you drag your easel out of the
closet, start your own blog, or dust off your old piano books and try tickling
the ivories, congratulate yourself. You’re healing!

Appendix
PTSD Resources
L
ooking for additional information to help in your healing or that of some-
one you love? If so, this appendix provides a wealth of Web sites and other
resources to aid you in understanding PTSD and in taking control of it if you’re
the one caught in its grip.
Emergency Phone Numbers
These numbers can be lifesavers if conditions get really tough. Keep them
handy if you have any suicidal thoughts or if you’re living in a dangerous 
situation.
 National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, 800-273-TALK (800-273-8255)
 National Domestic Violence Hotline, 800-799-SAFE (800-799-7233)
 National Child Abuse Hotline, 800-4-ACHILD (800-422-4453), for help if
you’re being abused or are committing abuse and know you need help
Web Sites
If you have access to the Internet, you can locate anything from basic info
about PTSD to discussion forums and organizations offering practical sup-
port. This section lists some good sites to check out.
General information
The Internet is full of facts (and nonfacts) about PTSD, so knowing where to
begin if you’re looking for information online can be hard. I recommend these
sites as good starting points. The first two in particular are outstanding.

 National Center for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (www.ncptsd.
va.gov)
This site, created primarily for veterans and their families and for care
providers, also provides excellent info for civilians dealing with PTSD.
The site is a must-see if you’re seeking basic information, whether 
you’re a person with PTSD, a family member or friend, or a healthcare
professional. It provides both basic information and loads of links to
other sites, including excellent sites with info on helping children with
PTSD. Another great feature: the PILOTS database, an electronic index 
to the worldwide literature on PTSD.
 Sidran Institute (www.sidran.org)
This site is a top source of information about all aspects of PTSD. 
It offers a help desk providing information on finding therapists, 
treatment centers, and support groups, as well as recommendations
regarding books, videos, newsletters, and journals about PTSD. Highly
recommended!
 National Institute of Mental Health (www.nimh.nih.gov/
healthinformation/ptsdmenu.cfm)
This site offers basic information about PTSD, links to breaking news
stories about the disorder and its treatment, downloadable publications
and resource materials, and a link to a list of clinical trials of new PTSD
treatments.
 Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies (www.aabt.org/
public)
Formerly the Association for Advancement of Behavior Therapy (hence
the Web address), this organization’s public site offers both information
and a search tool you can use to find a local therapist who offers cognitive
behavioral therapy, or CBT (see Chapter 8).
 PubMed (www.pubmed.gov)
This free site, which offers abstracts from medical journals, can help you
keep up-to-date on new treatments.
Discussion groups or support groups
If you’re looking for other people who understand the pain of PTSD and who
can offer both moral support and practical advice, the Internet is a great
place to find them. Here are good sites that can get you started:
342
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder For Dummies 

 PTSD Forum (www.ptsdforum.org) is one of the best of the online 
discussion groups about PTSD.
 American Self-Help Group Clearinghouse (mentalhelp.net/
selfhelp) can help you find PTSD support groups in your area,
whether you’re battling PTSD yourself or you’re a family member 
seeking ways to cope.
PTSD-related issues
If you’re battling PTSD, related problems such as substance abuse or mental
health disorders may come along for the ride. The following Web sites can be
a big help if you’re facing several of these challenges at once.
 National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence
(www.ncadd.org) offers links to dozens of programs that can help 
if you’re dealing with a substance abuse problem.
 National Eating Disorders Association (www.edap.org) includes
advice and referrals for people who develop eating disorders as a 
result of PTSD.
 S.A.F.E. Alternatives (www.selfinjury.com) offers information and 
a therapist referral list for people with trauma-related issues involving
self-injury (see Chapter 3).
 Agoraphobics Building Independent Lives (ABIL) (www.anxiety
support.org/b001menu.htm) is a support group that can help you if
your trauma caused severe anxiety that makes it difficult for you to be in
public places.
 PDRhealth (www.pdrhealth.com) is helpful if you want more 
information on a drug your doctor prescribes for PTSD. Just go to 
the index (www.pdrhealth.com/drug_info/index.html) and 
type the drug’s name.
For soldiers and vets
If you’re serving your country right now or you wore a uniform in the past,
check out these sites for information on the services available to you — and
for moral support and practical advice from people who know the PTSD drill.
343
Appendix: PTSD Resources

 Military OneSource (www.militaryonesource.com) offers assistance
in finding help for PTSD, for drug or alcohol problems, and for a wide
range of other issues.
 The Veterans Coalition (www.theveteranscoalition.org) offers
support and advice for people coping with PTSD and other post-combat
issues.
Also see “General information,” earlier in this appendix, for info on the
National Center for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, which focuses much of 
its efforts on helping vets and their families.
For people caring for children with PTSD
As I explain in Chapter 15, kids react differently than adults do to a traumatic
experience. If you’re caring for a child or teen who is at risk for or was diag-
nosed with PTSD, the following resources and articles can help you under-
stand what he’s going through and how you can help.
 National Child Traumatic Stress Network, www.nctsnet.org
This site contains excellent information for both parents and profes-
sionals. Professionals dealing with children who’ve experienced a 
traumatic experience can also find an excellent downloadable publica-
tion titled “Psychological First Aid” at this location on the site: www.
nctsnet.org/nccts/nav.do?pid=typ_terr_resources_pfa.
