Introduction, Classification, and System 
 
 
1-1C  
Solution 
We are to define a fluid and how it differs between a solid and a gas.  
 
Analysis  
A substance in the liquid or gas phase is referred to as a fluid. A fluid differs from a solid in that a 
solid can resist an applied shear stress by deforming, whereas a fluid deforms continuously under the influence of shear 
stress, no matter how small.  A liquid takes the shape of the container it is in, and a liquid forms a free surface in a larger 
container in a gravitational field. A gas, on the other hand, expands until it encounters the walls of the container and fills 
the entire available space.  
 
Discussion 
The subject of fluid mechanics deals with ball fluids, both gases and liquids. 
 
 
 
 
1-2C  
Solution 
We are to determine whether the flow of air over the wings of an aircraft and the flow of gases through a jet 
engine is internal or external.  
 
Analysis  
The flow of air over the wings of an aircraft is external since this is an unbounded fluid flow over a 
surface. The flow of gases through a jet engine is internal flow since the fluid is completely bounded by the solid surfaces 
of the engine.   
 
Discussion 
If we consider the entire airplane, the flow is both internal (through the jet engines) and external (over the 
body and wings). 
 
 
 
 
1-3C  
Solution 
We are to define incompressible and compressible flow, and discuss fluid compressibility.  
 
Analysis 
A fluid flow during which the density of the fluid remains nearly constant is called incompressible flow. 
A flow in which density varies significantly is called compressible flow. A fluid whose density is practically independent 
of pressure (such as a liquid) is commonly referred to as an “incompressible fluid,” although it is more proper to refer to 
incompressible flow. The flow of compressible fluid (such as air) does not necessarily need to be treated as compressible 
since the density of a compressible fluid may still remain nearly constant during flow – especially flow at low speeds. 
 
Discussion 
It turns out that the Mach number is the critical parameter to determine whether the flow of a gas can be 
approximated as an incompressible flow. If Ma is less than about 0.3, the incompressible approximation yields results that 
are in error by less than a couple percent. 
 
 
 
 
1-4C  
Solution 
We are to define internal, external, and open-channel flows.  
 
Analysis 
External flow is the flow of an unbounded fluid over a surface such as a plate, a wire, or a pipe. The flow 
in a pipe or duct is internal flow if the fluid is completely bounded by solid surfaces.  The flow of liquids in a pipe is 
called open-channel flow if the pipe is partially filled with the liquid and there is a free surface, such as the flow of 
water in rivers and irrigation ditches. 
 
Discussion 
As we shall see in later chapters, different approximations are used in the analysis of fluid flows based on 
their classification.

1-3
1-5C  
Solution 
We are to define the Mach number of a flow and the meaning for a Mach number of 2.  
 
Analysis  
The Mach number of a flow is defined as the ratio of the speed of flow to the speed of sound in the 
flowing fluid. A Mach number of 2 indicate a flow speed that is twice the speed of sound in that fluid.   
 
Discussion 
Mach number is an example of a dimensionless (or nondimensional) parameter. 
 
 
 
 
1-6C  
Solution 
We are to discuss if the Mach number of a constant-speed airplane is constant.  
 
Analysis  
No. The speed of sound, and thus the Mach number, changes with temperature which may change 
considerably from point to point in the atmosphere.  
 
 
 
 
1-7C  
Solution 
We are to determine if the flow of air with a Mach number of 0.12 should be approximated as 
incompressible.  
 
Analysis  
Gas flows can often be approximated as incompressible if the density changes are under about 5 percent, 
which is usually the case when Ma < 0.3. Therefore, air flow with a Mach number of 0.12 may be approximated as being 
incompressible. 
 
Discussion 
Air is of course a compressible fluid, but at low Mach numbers, compressibility effects are insignificant. 
 
 
 
 
1-8C  
Solution 
We are to define the no-slip condition and its cause.  
 
Analysis 
A fluid in direct contact with a solid surface sticks to the surface and there is no slip. This is known as 
the no-slip condition, and it is due to the viscosity of the fluid. 
 
Discussion 
There is no such thing as an inviscid fluid, since all fluids have viscosity. 
 
 
 
 
1-9C  
Solution 
We are to define forced flow and discuss the difference between forced and natural flow. We are also to 
discuss whether wind-driven flows are forced or natural.  
 
Analysis 
In forced flow, the fluid is forced to flow over a surface or in a tube by external means such as a pump or a 
fan. In natural flow, any fluid motion is caused by natural means such as the buoyancy effect that manifests itself as the rise 
of the warmer fluid and the fall of the cooler fluid. The flow caused by winds is natural flow for the earth, but it is 
forced flow for bodies subjected to the winds since for the body it makes no difference whether the air motion is caused 
by a fan or by the winds. 
 
Discussion 
As seen here, the classification of forced vs. natural flow may depend on your frame of reference.

1-4
1-10C  
Solution 
We are to define a boundary layer, and discuss its cause.  
 
Analysis 
The region of flow (usually near a wall) in which the velocity gradients are significant and frictional 
effects are important is called the boundary layer. When a fluid stream encounters a solid surface that is at rest, the fluid 
velocity assumes a value of zero at that surface. The velocity then varies from zero at the surface to some larger value 
sufficiently far from the surface.  The development of a boundary layer is caused by the no-slip condition. 
 
Discussion 
As we shall see later, flow within a boundary layer is rotational (individual fluid particles rotate), while that 
outside the boundary layer is typically irrotational (individual fluid particles move, but do not rotate). 
 
 
 
 
1-11C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the differences between classical and statistical approaches.  
 
Analysis 
The classical approach is a macroscopic approach, based on experiments or analysis of the gross behavior 
of a fluid, without knowledge of individual molecules, whereas the statistical approach is a microscopic approach based 
on the average behavior of large groups of individual molecules. 
 
Discussion 
The classical approach is easier and much more common in fluid flow analysis. 
 
 
 
 
1-12C  
Solution 
We are to define a steady-flow process.  
 
Analysis 
A process is said to be steady if it involves no changes with time anywhere within the system or at the 
system boundaries. 
 
Discussion 
The opposite of steady flow is unsteady flow, which involves changes with time. 
 
 
 
 
1-13C  
Solution 
We are to define stress, normal stress, shear stress, and pressure.  
 
Analysis 
Stress is defined as force per unit area, and is determined by dividing the force by the area upon which it 
acts. The normal component of a force acting on a surface per unit area is called the normal stress, and the tangential 
component of a force acting on a surface per unit area is called shear stress. In a fluid at rest, the normal stress is called 
pressure. 
 
Discussion 
Fluids in motion may have both shear stresses and additional normal stresses besides pressure, but when a 
fluid is at rest, the only normal stress is the pressure, and there are no shear stresses. 
 
 
 
 
1-14C  
Solution 
We are to discuss how to select system when analyzing the acceleration of gases as they flow through a 
nozzle.  
 
Analysis 
When analyzing the acceleration of gases as they flow through a nozzle, a wise choice for the system is the 
volume within the nozzle, bounded by the entire inner surface of the nozzle and the inlet and outlet cross-sections. This is a 
control volume (or open system) since mass crosses the boundary.  
 
Discussion 
It would be much more difficult to follow a chunk of air as a closed system as it flows through the nozzle.

1-15C  
Solution 
We are to discuss when a system is considered closed or open.  
 
Analysis 
Systems may be considered to be closed or open, depending on whether a fixed mass or a volume in space is 
chosen for study. A closed system (also known as a control mass or simply a system) consists of a fixed amount of mass, 
and no mass can cross its boundary. An open system, or a control volume, is a selected region in space. Mass may cross 
the boundary of a control volume or open system 
 
Discussion 
In thermodynamics, it is more common to use the terms open system and closed system, but in fluid 
mechanics, it is more common to use the terms system and control volume to mean the same things, respectively. 
 
 
 
 
1-16C  
Solution 
We are to discuss how to select system for the operation of a reciprocating air compressor.  
 
Analysis 
We would most likely take the system as the air contained in the piston-cylinder device. This system is a 
closed or fixed mass system when it is compressing and no mass enters or leaves it. However, it is an open system 
during intake or exhaust. 
 
Discussion 
In this example, the system boundary is the same for either case – closed or open system. 
 
 
 
 
1-17C  
Solution 
We are to define system, surroundings, and boundary.  
 
Analysis 
A system is defined as a quantity of matter or a region in space chosen for study. The mass or region 
outside the system is called the surroundings. The real or imaginary surface that separates the system from its 
surroundings is called the boundary. 
 
Discussion 
Some authors like to define closed systems and open systems, while others use the notation “system” to 
mean a closed system and “control volume” to mean an open system. This has been a source of confusion for students for 
many years. [See the next question for further discussion about this.]

Mass, Force, and Units 
 
 
1-18C  
Solution 
We are to explain why the light-year has the dimension of length.  
 
Analysis  
In this unit, the word light refers to the speed of light.  The light-year unit is then the product of a velocity 
and time.  Hence, this product forms a distance dimension and unit. 
 
 
 
 
 
1-19C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the difference between kg-mass and kg-force.  
 
Analysis 
The unit kilogram (kg) is the mass unit in the SI system, and it is sometimes called kg-mass, whereas kg-
force (kgf) is a force unit. One kg-force is the force required to accelerate a 1-kg mass by 9.807 m/s2. In other words, the 
weight of 1-kg mass at sea level on earth is 1 kg-force. 
 
Discussion 
It is not proper to say that one kg-mass is equal to one kg-force since the two units have different 
dimensions. 
 
 
 
 
 
1-20C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the difference between pound-mass and pound-force.  
 
Analysis 
Pound-mass lbm is the mass unit in English system whereas pound-force lbf is the force unit in the 
English system.  One pound-force is the force required to accelerate a mass of 32.174 lbm by 1 ft/s2. In other words, the 
weight of a 1-lbm mass at sea level on earth is 1 lbf. 
 
Discussion 
It is not proper to say that one lbm is equal to one lbf since the two units have different dimensions. 
 
 
 
 
1-21C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the difference between pound-mass (lbm) and pound-force (lbf).  
 
Analysis 
The “pound” mentioned here must be “lbf” since thrust is a force, and the lbf is the force unit in the English 
system.  
 
Discussion 
You should get into the habit of never writing the unit “lb”, but always use either “lbm” or “lbf” as 
appropriate since the two units have different dimensions. 
 
 
 
 
1-22C  
Solution 
We are to calculate the net force on a car cruising at constant velocity.  
 
Analysis 
There is no acceleration (car moving at constant velocity), thus the net force is zero in both cases. 
 
Discussion 
By Newton‟s second law, the force on an object is directly proportional to its acceleration. If there is zero 
acceleration, there must be zero net force.

Solution 
A plastic tank is filled with water. The weight of the combined system is to be determined.  
 
Assumptions The density of water is constant throughout. 
Properties 
The density of water is given to be  = 1000 kg/m3. 
Analysis 
The mass of the water in the tank and the total mass are 
 
 
mw =V =(1000 kg/m3)(0.18 m3) = 180 kg 
 
 
mtotal = mw + mtank = 180 + 6 = 186 kg

Solution During an analysis, a relation with inconsistent units is obtained. A correction is to be found, and the probable 
cause of the error is to be determined. 
 
Analysis The two terms on the right-hand side of the equation  
 
E = 16 kJ + 7 kJ/kg  
 
do not have the same units, and therefore they cannot be added to obtain the total energy. Multiplying the last term by 
mass will eliminate the kilograms in the denominator, and the whole equation will become dimensionally 
homogeneous; that is, every term in the equation will have the same unit. 
 
Discussion Obviously this error was caused by forgetting to multiply the last term by mass at an earlier stage.

Solution 
Gravitational acceleration g and thus the weight of bodies decreases with increasing elevation. The percent 
reduction in the weight of an airplane cruising at 13,000 m is to be determined. 
Properties 
The gravitational acceleration g is 9.807 m/s2 at sea level and 9.767 m/s2 at an altitude of 13,000 m. 
Analysis 
Weight is proportional to the gravitational acceleration g, and thus the percent reduction in weight is 
equivalent to the percent reduction in the gravitational acceleration, which is determined from

to lose weight. The best way to lose weight is to carefully control your diet, and to exercise.

This is more than three times higher than the altitude at which a typical commercial jet flies, which is about 
30,000 ft (9140 m).  So, flying in a jet is not a good way to lose weight – diet and exercise are always the best bet.

Solution A resistance heater is used to heat water to desired temperature. The amount of electric energy used in kWh and 
kJ are to be determined. 
 
Analysis The resistance heater consumes electric energy at a rate of 4 kW or 4 kJ/s. Then the total amount of electric energy 
used in 2 hours becomes  
 
Total energy = (Energy per unit time)(Time interval) 
 
 
         = (4 kW)(2 h) 
 
 
         = 8 kWh 
 
Noting that 1 kWh = (1 kJ/s)(3600 s) = 3600 kJ, 
 
Total energy = (8 kWh)(3600 kJ/kWh) 
 
 
         = 28,800 kJ 
 
Discussion Note kW is a unit for power whereas kWh is a unit for energy.

Solution A gas tank is being filled with gasoline at a specified flow rate. Based on unit considerations alone, a relation is 
to be obtained for the filling time. 
 
Assumptions Gasoline is an incompressible substance and the flow rate is constant. 
 
Analysis The filling time depends on the volume of the tank and the discharge rate of gasoline.  Also, we know that the unit 
of time is „seconds‟.  Therefore, the independent quantities should be arranged such that we end up with the unit of seconds. 
Putting the given information into perspective, we have 
 
 
t [s]        V [L],  and  V [L/s}  
 
It is obvious that the only way to end up with the unit “s” for time is to divide the tank volume by the discharge rate. 
Therefore, the desired relation is

Solution A pool is to be filled with water using a hose. Based on unit considerations, a relation is to be obtained for the 
volume of the pool. 
 
Assumptions Water is an incompressible substance and the average flow velocity is constant. 
 
Analysis The pool volume depends on the filling time, the cross-sectional area which depends on hose diameter, and flow 
velocity. Also, we know that the unit of volume is m3. Therefore, the independent quantities should be arranged such that we 
end up with the unit of seconds. Putting the given information into perspective, we have 
 
V [m3]   is a function of   t [s],  D [m], and V [m/s}  
 
It is obvious that the only way to end up with the unit “m3” for volume is to multiply the quantities t and V with the square of 
D. Therefore, the desired relation is  
 
V  = CD2Vt 
 
where the constant of proportionality is obtained for a round hose, namely, C =π/4 so that V = (D2/4)Vt. 
 
Discussion Note that the values of dimensionless constants of proportionality cannot be determined with this approach.

Solution It is to be shown that the power needed to accelerate a car is proportional to the mass and the square of the 
velocity of the car, and inversely proportional to the time interval. 
 
Assumptions The car is initially at rest.  
 
Analysis The power needed for acceleration depends on the mass, velocity change, and time interval.  Also, the unit of 
power Wis watt, W, which is equivalent to 
 
 
W = J/s = Nm/s = (kgm/s2)m/s = kgm2/s3 
 
 Therefore, the independent quantities should be arranged such that we end up with the unit kgm2/s3 for power. Putting the 
given information into perspective, we have 
 
 
W[ kgm2/s3]  is a function of   m [kg], V [m/s], and  t [s]  
 
It is obvious that the only way to end up with the unit “kgm2/s3” for power is to multiply mass with the square of the 
velocity and divide by time. Therefore, the desired relation is

Solution 
We are to calculate the useful power delivered by an airplane propeller.  
 
Assumptions 1 The airplane flies at constant altitude and constant speed. 2 Wind is not a factor in the calculations. 
 
Analysis 
At steady horizontal flight, the airplane‟s drag is balanced by the propeller‟s thrust. Energy is force times 
distance, and power is energy per unit time. Thus, by dimensional reasoning, the power supplied by the propeller must equal 
thrust times velocity,

Solution 
We are to calculate lift produced by an airplane‟s wings.  
 
Assumptions 1 The airplane flies at constant altitude and constant speed. 2 Wind is not a factor in the calculations. 
 
Analysis 
At steady horizontal flight, the airplane‟s weight is balanced by the lift produced by the wings. Thus, the net 
lift force must equal the weight, or FL = 1450 lbf. We use unity conversion ratios to convert to newtons:

where we give our final answers to 3 significant digits. 
 
Discussion 
The answer is valid at any speed, since lift must balance weight in order to sustain straight, horizontal flight. 
As the fuel is consumed, the overall weight of the aircraft will decrease, and hence the lift requirement will also decrease. If 
the pilot does not adjust, the airplane will climb slowly in altitude.

Solution 
A man is considering buying a 12-oz steak for $3.15, or a 320-g steak for $2.80. The steak that is a better 
buy is to be determined. 
Assumptions The steaks are of identical quality. 
Analysis 
To make a comparison possible, we need to express the cost of each steak on a common basis. We choose 1 
kg as the basis for comparison. Using proper conversion factors, the unit cost of each steak is determined to be

We are to calculate the volume flow rate and mass flow rate of water.

Modeling and Solving Engineering Problems 
 
 
 
1-44C  
Solution 
We are to discuss choosing a model.  
 
Analysis 
The right choice between a crude and complex model is usually the simplest model that yields adequate 
results. Preparing very accurate but complex models is not necessarily a better choice since such models are not much use 
to an analyst if they are very difficult and time consuming to solve. At a minimum, the model should reflect the essential 
features of the physical problem it represents. After obtaining preliminary results with the simpler model and optimizing the 
design, the complex, expensive model may be used for the final prediction. 
 
Discussion 
Cost is always an issue in engineering design, and “adequate” is often determined by cost. 
 
 
 
 
1-45C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the difference between analytical and experimental approaches.  
 
Analysis 
The experimental approach (testing and taking measurements) has the advantage of dealing with the 
actual physical system, and getting a physical value within the limits of experimental error. However, this approach is 
expensive, time consuming, and often impractical. The analytical approach (analysis or calculations) has the advantage 
that it is fast and inexpensive, but the results obtained are subject to the accuracy of the assumptions and idealizations made 
in the analysis. 
 
Discussion 
Most engineering designs require both analytical and experimental components, and both are important. 
Nowadays, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is often used in place of pencil-and-paper analysis and/or experiments. 
 
 
 
 
1-46C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the importance of modeling in engineering.  
 
Analysis 
Modeling makes it possible to predict the course of an event before it actually occurs, or to study 
various aspects of an event mathematically without actually running expensive and time-consuming experiments. 
When preparing a mathematical model, all the variables that affect the phenomena are identified, reasonable assumptions 
and approximations are made, and the interdependence of these variables is studied. The relevant physical laws and 
principles are invoked, and the problem is formulated mathematically. Finally, the problem is solved using an appropriate 
approach, and the results are interpreted. 
 
Discussion 
In most cases of actual engineering design, the results are verified by experiment – usually by building a 
prototype.  CFD is also being used more and more in the design process. 
 
 
 
 
1-47C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the difference between accuracy and precision.  
 
Analysis 
Accuracy refers to the closeness of the measured or calculated value to the true value whereas precision 
represents the number of significant digits or the closeness of different measurements of the same quantity to each 
other. A measurement or calculation can be very precise without being very accurate, and vice-versa. When 
measuring the boiling temperature of pure water at standard atmospheric conditions (100.00oC), for example, a temperature 
measurement of 97.861C is very precise, but not as accurate as the less precise measurement of 99.0C. 
 
Discussion 
Accuracy and precision are often confused; both are important for quality engineering measurements.

1-48C  
Solution 
We are to discuss how differential equations arise in the study of a physical problem.  
 
Analysis 
The description of most scientific problems involves equations that relate the changes in some key variables 
to each other, and the smaller the increment chosen in the changing variables, the more accurate the description. In the 
limiting case of infinitesimal changes in variables, we obtain differential equations, which provide precise mathematical 
formulations for the physical principles and laws by representing the rates of changes as derivatives. 
 
Discussion 
As we shall see in later chapters, the differential equations of fluid mechanics are known, but very difficult 
to solve except for very simple geometries.  Computers are extremely helpful in this area. 
 
 
 
 
1-49C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the value of engineering software packages.  
 
Analysis 
Software packages are of great value in engineering practice, and engineers today rely on software 
packages to solve large and complex problems quickly, and to perform optimization studies efficiently. Despite the 
convenience and capability that engineering software packages offer, they are still just tools, and they cannot replace 
traditional engineering courses. They simply cause a shift in emphasis in the course material from mathematics to physics.  
 
Discussion 
While software packages save us time by reducing the amount of number-crunching, we must be careful to 
understand how they work and what they are doing, or else incorrect results can occur.

Because the gravitational acceleration on earth is close to 10 m/s2, it turns out that the two force units N and

(z = 1610 m): W = 80(9.807-3.32x10-61610) = 809.802 = 784.2 N 
 
Mt. Ev.:  
(z = 8848 m): W = 80(9.807-3.32x10-68848) = 809.778 = 782.2 N 
 
Discussion 
We report 4 significant digits since the values are so close to each other. The percentage difference in 
weight from sea level to Mt. Everest is only about -0.3%, which is negligible for most engineering calculations.

Solution 
We are to estimate the rate of heat transfer into a room and the cost of running an air conditioner for one 
hour.  
 
Assumptions 1 The rate of heat transfer is constant. 2 The indoor and outdoor temperatures do not change significantly 
during the hour of operation. 
 
Analysis 
(a) 
In one hour, the air conditioner supplies 5,000 Btu of cooling, but runs only 60% of the time. Since the indoor and 
outdoor temperatures remain constant during the hour of operation, the average rate of heat transfer into the room is the 
same as the average rate of cooling supplied by the air conditioner. Thus,

(b) 
Energy efficiency ratio is defined as the amount of heat removed from the cooled space in Btu for 1 Wh (watt-
hour) of electricity consumed. Thus, for every Wh of electricity, this particular air conditioner removes 9.0 Btu from the 
room. To remove 3,000 Btu in one hour, the air conditioner therefore consumes 3,000/9.0 = 333.33 Wh = 0.33333 kWh of 
electricity. At a cost of 7.5 cents per kWh, it costs only 2.50 cents to run the air conditioner for one hour. 
 
Discussion 
Notice the unity conversion ratio in the above calculation. We also needed to use some common sense and 
dimensional reasoning to come up with the appropriate calculations. While this may seem very cheap, if this air conditioner 
is run at these conditions continuously for one month, the electricity will cost ($0.025/h) (24 h/day) (30 day/mo) = $18/mo.

Solution The flow of air through a wind turbine is considered. Based on unit considerations, a proportionality relation is to 
be obtained for the mass flow rate of air through the blades. 
 
Assumptions Wind approaches the turbine blades with a uniform velocity. 
 
Analysis The mass flow rate depends on the air density, average wind velocity, and the cross-sectional area which depends 
on hose diameter. Also, the unit of mass flow rate m is kg/s. Therefore, the independent quantities should be arranged such 
that we end up with the proper unit. Putting the given information into perspective, we have 
 
m [kg/s]   is a function of    [kg/m3],  D [m], and V [m/s}  
 
It is obvious that the only way to end up with the unit “kg/s” for mass flow rate is to multiply the quantities   and V with the 
square of D. Therefore, the desired proportionality relation is

Solution A relation for the air drag exerted on a car is to be obtained in terms of on the drag coefficient, the air density, the 
car velocity, and the frontal area of the car.   
Analysis The drag force depends on a dimensionless drag coefficient, the air density, the car velocity, and the frontal area. 
Also, the unit of force F is newton N, which is equivalent to kgm/s2. Therefore, the independent quantities should be 
arranged such that we end up with the unit kgm/s2 for the drag force. Putting the given information into perspective, we 
have 
 
FD [ kgm/s2]     CDrag [], Afront [m2],  [kg/m3], and V [m/s]  
It is obvious that the only way to end up with the unit “kgm/s2” for drag force is to multiply mass with the square of the 
velocity and the fontal area, with the drag coefficient serving as the constant of proportionality. Therefore, the desired 
relation is

Density and Specific Gravity 
 
 
 
2-1C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the difference between mass and molar mass.  
 
Analysis 
Mass m is the actual mass in grams or kilograms; molar mass M is the mass per mole in grams/mol or 
kg/kmol.  These two are related to each other by m = NM, where N is the number of moles. 
 
Discussion 
Mass, number of moles, and molar mass are often confused. Molar mass is also called molecular weight. 
 
 
 
 
 
2-2C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the difference between intensive and extensive properties.  
 
Analysis 
Intensive properties do not depend on the size (extent) of the system but extensive properties do depend 
on the size (extent) of the system. 
 
Discussion 
An example of an intensive property is temperature. An example of an extensive property is mass. 
 
 
 
 
 
2-3C  
Solution 
We are to define specific gravity and discuss its relationship to density.  
 
Analysis 
The specific gravity, or relative density, is defined as the ratio of the density of a substance to the density 
of some standard substance at a specified temperature (the standard is water at 4°C, for which H2O = 1000 kg/m3). That 
is, 
H2O
/ 


SG
. When specific gravity is known, density is determined from 
H2O



SG
. 
 
Discussion 
Specific gravity is dimensionless and unitless [it is just a number without dimensions or units]. 
 
 
 
 
2-4C  
Solution 
We are to decide if the specific weight is an extensive or intensive property.  
Analysis  
The original specific weight is 
 
V
W

1

 
If we were to divide the system into two halves, each half weighs W/2 and occupies a volume of V /2.  The specific weight 
of one of these halves is 
 
1
2
/
2
/



V
W
 
which is the same as the original specific weight. Hence, specific weight is an intensive property. 
 
Discussion 
If specific weight were an extensive property, its value for half of the system would be halved.

Solution 
We are to define the state postulate.  
Analysis 
The state postulate is expressed as: The state of a simple compressible system is completely specified by 
two independent, intensive properties. 
 
Discussion 
An example of an intensive property is temperature. 
 
 
 
 
 
2-6C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the applicability of the ideal gas law.  
 
Analysis 
A gas can be treated as an ideal gas when it is at a high temperature and/or a low pressure relative to its 
critical temperature and pressure. 
 
Discussion 
Air and many other gases at room temperature and pressure can be approximated as ideal gases without any 
significant loss of accuracy. 
 
 
 
 
 
2-7C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the difference between R and Ru.  
 
Analysis 
Ru is the universal gas constant that is the same for all gases, whereas R is the specific gas constant that is 
different for different gases.  These two are related to each other by 
u
R
R / M

, where M is the molar mass (also called 
the molecular weight) of the gas. 
 
Discussion 
Since molar mass has dimensions of mass per mole, R and Ru do not have the same dimensions or units.

Vapor Pressure and Cavitation 
 
 
 
2-20C  
Solution 
We are to define and discuss cavitation.  
 
Analysis 
In the flow of a liquid, cavitation is the vaporization that may occur at locations where the pressure 
drops below the vapor pressure. The vapor bubbles collapse as they are swept away from the low pressure regions, 
generating highly destructive, extremely high-pressure waves. This phenomenon is a common cause for drop in 
performance and even the erosion of impeller blades.  
 
Discussion 
The word “cavitation” comes from the fact that a vapor bubble or “cavity” appears in the liquid.  Not all 
cavitation is undesirable. It turns out that some underwater vehicles employ “super cavitation” on purpose to reduce drag. 
 
 
 
 
 
2-21C  
Solution 
We are to discuss whether the boiling temperature of water increases as pressure increases.  
 
Analysis 
Yes. The saturation temperature of a pure substance depends on pressure; in fact, it increases with pressure. 
The higher the pressure, the higher the saturation or boiling temperature. 
 
Discussion 
This fact is easily seen by looking at the saturated water property tables. Note that boiling temperature and 
saturation pressure at a given pressure are equivalent. 
 
 
 
 
 
2-22C  
Solution 
We are to determine if temperature increases or remains constant when the pressure of a boiling substance 
increases.  
 
Analysis 
If the pressure of a substance increases during a boiling process, the temperature also increases since the 
boiling (or saturation) temperature of a pure substance depends on pressure and increases with it. 
 
Discussion 
We are assuming that the liquid will continue to boil. If the pressure is increased fast enough, boiling may 
stop until the temperature has time to reach its new (higher) boiling temperature.  A pressure cooker uses this principle. 
 
 
 
 
 
2-23C  
Solution 
We are to define vapor pressure and discuss its relationship to saturation pressure.  
 
Analysis 
The vapor pressure Pv of a pure substance is defined as the pressure exerted by a vapor in phase 
equilibrium with its liquid at a given temperature. In general, the pressure of a vapor or gas, whether it exists alone or in 
a mixture with other gases, is called the partial pressure. During phase change processes between the liquid and vapor 
phases of a pure substance, the saturation pressure and the vapor pressure are equivalent since the vapor is pure. 
 
Discussion 
Partial pressure is not necessarily equal to vapor pressure. For example, on a dry day (low relative 
humidity), the partial pressure of water vapor in the air is less than the vapor pressure of water. If, however, the relative 
humidity is 100%, the partial pressure and the vapor pressure are equal.

Energy and Specific Heats  
 
 
 
 
 
2-28C  
Solution 
We are to define and discuss flow energy.  
 
Analysis 
Flow energy or flow work is the energy needed to push a fluid into or out of a control volume. Fluids at 
rest do not possess any flow energy. 
 
Discussion 
Flow energy is not a fundamental quantity, like kinetic or potential energy. However, it is a useful concept 
in fluid mechanics since fluids are often forced into and out of control volumes in practice. 
 
 
 
 
 
2-29C  
Solution 
We are to compare the energies of flowing and non-flowing fluids.  
 
Analysis 
A flowing fluid possesses flow energy, which is the energy needed to push a fluid into or out of a 
control volume, in addition to the forms of energy possessed by a non-flowing fluid. The total energy of a non-flowing 
fluid consists of internal and potential energies. If the fluid is moving as a rigid body, but not flowing, it may also have 
kinetic energy (e.g., gasoline in a tank truck moving down the highway at constant speed with no sloshing). The total 
energy of a flowing fluid consists of internal, kinetic, potential, and flow energies. 
 
Discussion 
Flow energy is not to be confused with kinetic energy, even though both are zero when the fluid is at rest. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2-30C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the difference between macroscopic and microscopic forms of energy.  
 
Analysis 
The macroscopic forms of energy are those a system possesses as a whole with respect to some outside 
reference frame.  The microscopic forms of energy, on the other hand, are those related to the molecular structure of a 
system and the degree of the molecular activity, and are independent of outside reference frames. 
 
Discussion 
We mostly deal with macroscopic forms of energy in fluid mechanics. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2-31C  
Solution 
We are to define total energy and identify its constituents.  
 
Analysis 
The sum of all forms of the energy a system possesses is called total energy.  In the absence of magnetic, 
electrical, and surface tension effects, the total energy of a system consists of the kinetic, potential, and internal 
energies. 
 
Discussion 
All three constituents of total energy (kinetic, potential, and internal) need to be considered in an analysis of 
a general fluid flow.

2-32C 
Solution 
We are to list the forms of energy that contribute to the internal energy of a system.  
 
Analysis 
The internal energy of a system is made up of sensible, latent, chemical, and nuclear energies.  The 
sensible internal energy is due to translational, rotational, and vibrational effects. 
 
Discussion 
We deal with the flow of a single phase fluid in most problems in this textbook; therefore, latent, chemical, 
and nuclear energies do not need to be considered. 
 
 
 
 
 
2-33C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the relationship between heat, internal energy, and thermal energy.  
 
Analysis 
Thermal energy is the sensible and latent forms of internal energy. It does not include chemical or 
nuclear forms of energy. In common terminology, thermal energy is referred to as heat. However, like work, heat is not a 
property, whereas thermal energy is a property. 
 
Discussion 
Technically speaking, “heat” is defined only when there is heat transfer, whereas the energy state of a 
substance can always be defined, even if no heat transfer is taking place. 
 
 
 
 
 
2-34C

Solution 
 The total energy of saturated water vapor flowing in a pipe at a specified velocity and elevation is to be 
determined. 
Analysis  
The total energy of a flowing fluid is given by (Eq. 28) 
 
 
 
The enthalpy of the vapor at the specified temperature can be found in any thermo text to be

energy is determined as 
 
 
 
Note that only 0.047% of the total energy comes from the combination of kinetic and potential energies, which explains 
why we usually neglect kinetic and potential energies in most flow systems.

We are to discuss the coefficient of compressibility and the isothermal compressibility.  
 
Analysis 
The coefficient of compressibility represents the variation of pressure of a fluid with volume or density 
at constant temperature. Isothermal compressibility is the inverse of the coefficient of compressibility, and it represents 
the fractional change in volume or density corresponding to a change in pressure. 
 
Discussion 
The coefficient of compressibility of an ideal gas is equal to its absolute pressure. 
 
 
 
 
 
2-38C  
Solution 
We are to define the coefficient of volume expansion.  
 
Analysis 
The coefficient of volume expansion represents the variation of the density of a fluid with temperature at 
constant pressure. It differs from the coefficient of compressibility in that the latter represents the variation of pressure of 
a fluid with density at constant temperature. 
 
Discussion 
The coefficient of volume expansion of an ideal gas is equal to the inverse of its absolute temperature. 
 
 
 
 
 
2-39C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the sign of the coefficient of compressibility and the coefficient of volume expansion.  
 
Analysis 
The coefficient of compressibility of a fluid cannot be negative, but the coefficient of volume expansion can 
be negative (e.g., liquid water below 4C). 
 
Discussion 
This is the reason that ice floats on water.

Solution 
Water at a given temperature and pressure is heated to a higher temperature at constant pressure. The 
change in the density of water is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The coefficient of volume expansion is constant in the given temperature range.  2 An approximate 
analysis is performed by replacing differential changes in quantities by finite changes.  
Properties 
The density of water at 15C and 1 atm pressure is 1 = 999.1 kg/m3. The coefficient of volume expansion 
at the average temperature of (15+95)/2 = 55C is  = 0.484  10-3 K-1. 
Analysis 
When differential quantities are replaced by differences and the properties  and  are assumed to be 
constant, the change in density in terms of the changes in pressure and temperature is expressed approximately as

Solution 
We are to estimate the energy required to heat up the water in a hot-water tank.  
 
Assumptions 1 There are no losses. 2 The pressure in the tank remains constant at 1 atm. 3 An approximate analysis is 
performed by replacing differential changes in quantities by finite changes. 
 
Properties 
The specific heat of water is approximated as a constant, whose value is 0.999 Btu/lbmR at the average 
temperature of (60 + 110)/2 = 85oF. In fact, c remains constant at 0.999 Btu/lbmR (to three digits) from 60oF to 110oF. For 
this same temperature range, the density varies from 62.36 lbm/ft3 at 60oF to 61.86 lbm/ft3 at 110oF. We approximate the 
density as constant, whose value is 62.17 lbm/ft3 at the average temperature of 85oF.

Discussion 
The coefficient of volume expansion of an ideal gas is not constant, but rather decreases with temperature. 
However, for small temperature differences,  is often approximated as a constant with little loss of accuracy.

Solution 
 The coefficient of compressibility of nitrogen gas is to be estimated using Van der Waals equation of 
state. The result is to be compared to ideal gas and experimental values.  
 
Assumptions  1 Nitrogen gas obeys the Van der Waals equation of state.  
 
Analysis  
From the definition we have 
 
 
 
since 
 
 
 
The gas constant of nitrogen is
 (Table A1). Substituting given data we obtain 
 
 
 
For the ideal gas behavior, the coefficient of compressibility is equal to the pressure (Eq. 215). Therefore we get 
 
 
 
whichis in error by

Solution 
 The water contained in a piston-cylinder device is compressed isothermally and the pressure increases 
linearly. The energy needed is to be determined. 
 
Assumptions  1 The pressure increases linearly.  
 
Analysis  
We take the water in the cylinder as the system. The energy needed to compress water is equal to the 
work done on the system, and can be expressed as 
 
 
 
For a linear pressure increase we take 
 
 
 
In terms of finite changes, the fractional change due to change in pressure can be expressed approximately as (Eq. 323)

where  is the isothermal compressibility of water, which is 
  at 20 
. Realizing that 10 kg water 
occupies initially a volume of 
 the final volume of water is determined to be 
 
 
 
Therefore the work expression becomes 
 
 
or 
 
 
Thus, we conclude that linear pressure increase approximation does not work well since it gives almost ten times larger 
work.

Speed of Sound 
 
 
 
2-55C  
Solution 
We are to define and discuss sound and how it is generated and how it travels.  
 
Analysis 
Sound is an infinitesimally small pressure wave.  It is generated by a small disturbance in a medium.  
It travels by wave propagation. Sound waves cannot travel in a vacuum. 
 
Discussion 
Electromagnetic waves, like light and radio waves, can travel in a vacuum, but sound cannot. 
 
 
 
 
2-56C  
Solution 
We are to discuss whether sound travels faster in warm or cool air.  
 
Analysis 
Sound travels faster in warm (higher temperature) air since 
kRT
c 
. 
 
Discussion 
On the microscopic scale, we can imagine the air molecules moving around at higher speed in warmer air, 
leading to higher propagation of disturbances. 
 
 
 
 
2-57C  
Solution 
We are to compare the speed of sound in air, helium, and argon.  
 
Analysis 
Sound travels fastest in helium, since 
kRT
c 
 and helium has the highest kR value.  It is about 0.40 for 
air, 0.35 for argon, and 3.46 for helium. 
 
Discussion 
We are assuming, of course, that these gases behave as ideal gases – a good approximation at room 
temperature. 
 
 
 
 
2-58C  
Solution 
We are to compare the speed of sound in air at two different pressures, but the same temperature.  
 
Analysis 
Air at specified conditions will behave like an ideal gas, and the speed of sound in an ideal gas depends on 
temperature only.  Therefore, the speed of sound is the same in both mediums. 
 
Discussion 
If the temperature were different, however, the speed of sound would be different. 
 
 
 
 
2-59C  
Solution 
We are to examine whether the Mach number remains constant in constant-velocity flow.  
 
Analysis 
In general, no, because the Mach number also depends on the speed of sound in gas, which depends on the 
temperature of the gas.  The Mach number remains constant only if the temperature and the velocity are constant. 
 
Discussion 
It turns out that the speed of sound is not a strong function of pressure. In fact, it is not a function of 
pressure at all for an ideal gas.

2-60C  
Solution 
We are to state whether the propagation of sound waves is an isentropic process.  
 
Analysis 
Yes, the propagation of sound waves is nearly isentropic.  Because the amplitude of an ordinary sound 
wave is very small, and it does not cause any significant change in temperature and pressure. 
 
Discussion 
No process is truly isentropic, but the increase of entropy due to sound propagation is negligibly small. 
 
 
 
 
 
2-61C  
Solution 
We are to discuss sonic velocity – specifically, whether it is constant or it changes.  
 
Analysis 
The sonic speed in a medium depends on the properties of the medium, and it changes as the properties 
of the medium change. 
 
Discussion 
The most common example is the change in speed of sound due to temperature change. 
 
 
 
 
 
2-62  
Solution 
The Mach number of a passenger plane for specified limiting operating conditions is to be determined.

Discussion 
The specific heats and their ratio k change with temperature, and the accuracy of the results can be 
improved by accounting for this variation. Using EES (or another property database): 
At 1200 K: cp = 1.278 kJ/kgK, k = 1.173         c1 = 516 m/s,      V1 = 50 m/s,    Ma1 = 0.0969 
At 400 K:   cp = 0.9383 kJ/kgK, k = 1.252        c2 = 308 m/s,      V2 = 1356 m/s,    Ma2 = 4.41 
Therefore, the constant specific heat assumption results in an error of 4.5% at the inlet and 15.5% at the exit in the Mach 
number, which are significant.

Discussion 
The specific heats and their ratio k change with temperature, and the accuracy of the results can be

At 10C   : cp = 1.038 kJ/kgK, k = 1.400         c1 = 343 m/s,      V1 = 100 m/s,    Ma1 = 0.292

ideal gas approximation is a reasonable one in this case.

Viscosity 
 
 
 
2-73C  
Solution 
We are to define and discuss viscosity.  
 
Analysis 
Viscosity is a measure of the “stickiness” or “resistance to deformation” of a fluid. It is due to the 
internal frictional force that develops between different layers of fluids as they are forced to move relative to each other. 
Viscosity is caused by the cohesive forces between the molecules in liquids, and by the molecular collisions in gases. In 
general, liquids have higher dynamic viscosities than gases. 
 
Discussion 
The ratio of viscosity  to density  often appears in the equations of fluid mechanics, and is defined as the 
kinematic viscosity,  =  /. 
 
 
 
 
 
2-74C  
Solution 
We are to discuss Newtonian fluids.  
 
Analysis 
Fluids whose shear stress is linearly proportional to the velocity gradient (shear strain) are called 
Newtonian fluids.  Most common fluids such as water, air, gasoline, and oils are Newtonian fluids. 
 
Discussion 
In the differential analysis of fluid flow, only Newtonian fluids are considered in this textbook. 
 
 
 
 
 
2-75C  
Solution 
We are to discuss how kinematic viscosity varies with temperature in liquids and gases. 
 
Analysis 
(a) For liquids, the kinematic viscosity decreases with temperature. (b) For gases, the kinematic 
viscosity increases with temperature. 
 
Discussion 
You can easily verify this by looking at the appendices.

Solution 
We are to discuss how dynamic viscosity varies with temperature in liquids and gases.  
 
Analysis 
(a) The dynamic viscosity of liquids decreases with temperature. (b) The dynamic viscosity of gases 
increases with temperature. 
 
Discussion 
A good way to remember this is that a car engine is much harder to start in the winter because the oil in the 
engine has a higher viscosity at low temperatures.

Solution 
We are to compare the settling speed of balls dropped in water and oil; namely, we are to determine which 
will reach the bottom of the container first.  
 
Analysis 
When two identical small glass balls are dropped into two identical containers, one filled with water and the 
other with oil, the ball dropped in water will reach the bottom of the container first because of the much lower 
viscosity of water relative to oil. 
 
Discussion 
Oil is very viscous, with typical values of viscosity approximately 800 times greater than that of water at 
room temperature.

Solution 
A block is moved at constant velocity on an inclined surface. The force that needs to be applied in the 
horizontal direction when the block is dry, and the percent reduction in the required force when an oil film is applied on the 
surface are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The inclined surface is plane (perfectly flat, although tilted). 2 The friction coefficient and the oil film 
thickness are uniform. 3 The weight of the oil layer is negligible.  
Properties 
The absolute viscosity of oil is given to be  = 0.012 Pas = 0.012 Ns/m2. 
Analysis 
(a) The velocity of the block is constant, and thus its 
acceleration and the net force acting on it are zero. A free body diagram of the 
block is given. Then the force balance gives

(b) In this case, the friction force is replaced by the shear force

of the no-slip condition, the oil film sticks to the inclined surface

Solution 
A thin flat plate is pulled horizontally through an oil layer sandwiched between two plates, one stationary 
and the other moving at a constant velocity. The location in oil where the velocity is zero and the force that needs to be 
applied on the plate are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The thickness of the plate is negligible. 2 The velocity profile in each oil layer is linear.  
Properties 
The absolute viscosity of oil is given to be  = 0.027 Pas = 0.027 Ns/m2. 
Analysis 
(a) The velocity profile in each oil layer relative to the fixed wall is as shown in the figure below.  The point 
of zero velocity is indicated by point A, and its distance from the lower plate is determined from geometric considerations

Solution 
We are to determine the torque required to rotate the inner cylinder of two 
concentric cylinders, with the inner cylinder rotating and the outer cylinder stationary. We 
are also to explain what happens when the gap gets bigger. 
 
Assumptions 1 The fluid is incompressible and Newtonian. 2 End effects (top and bottom) 
are negligible. 3 The gap is very small so that wall curvature effects are negligible. 4 The 
gap is so small that the velocity profile in the gap is linear. 
 
Analysis 
(a) We assume a linear velocity profile between the two walls as sketched – the inner wall is moving at 
speed V = iRi and the outer wall is stationary. The thickness of the gap is h, and we let y be the distance from the outer 
wall into the fluid (towards the inner wall). Thus,

(b) The above is only an approximation because we assumed a linear velocity profile. As long as the gap is very small, 
and therefore the wall curvature effects are negligible, this approximation should be very good. Another way to think about 
this is that when the gap is very small compared to the cylinder radii, a magnified view of the flow in the gap appears 
similar to flow between two infinite walls (Couette flow). However, as the gap increases, the curvature effects are no longer 
negligible, and the linear velocity profile is not expected to be a valid approximation. We do not expect the velocity to 
remain linear as the gap increases.  
 
Discussion 
It is possible to solve for the exact velocity profile for this problem, and therefore the torque can be found 
analytically, but this has to wait until the differential analysis chapter.

Solution 
We are to investigate the effect of oil film thickness on the transmitted torque. 
Analysis 
The previous problem is reconsidered. Using EES software, the effect of oil film thickness on the 
torque transmitted is investigated. Film thickness varied from 0.1 mm to 10 mm, and the results are tabulated and 
plotted.  The relation used is

Conclusion Torque transmitted is inversely proportional to oil film thickness, and the film thickness should be as small as 
possible to maximize the transmitted torque. 
 
Discussion 
To obtain the solution in EES, we set up a parametric table, specify h, and let EES calculate T for each 
value of h.

Solution 
The viscosities of carbon dioxide at two temperatures are given. The constants of Sutherland correlation for 
carbon dioxide are to be determined and the viscosity of carbon dioxide at a specified temperature is to be predicted and 
compared to the value in table A-10. 
Analysis  
Sutherland correlation is given by Eq. 232 as 
 
 
 
where  is the absolute temperature. Substituting the given values we have 
 
 
 
 
 
which is a nonlinear system of two algebraic equations. Using EES or any other computer code, one finds the following 
result: 
 
 
 
Using these values the Sutherland correlation becomes 
 
 
 
Therefore the viscosity at 100 
 is found to be 
 
 
 
The agreement is perfect and within approximately 0.1%.

Solution 
A frustum shaped body is rotating at a constant 
angular speed in an oil container. The power required to 
maintain this motion and the reduction in the required power 
input when the oil temperature rises are to be determined. 
Assumptions The thickness of the oil layer remains constant.   
Properties  
The absolute viscosity of oil is given to be  = 
0.1 Pas = 0.1 Ns/m2 at 20C and 0.0078 Pas at 80C.  
Analysis 
The velocity gradient anywhere in the oil of 
film thickness h is V/h where V = r is the tangential velocity. 
Then the wall shear stress anywhere on the surface of the 
frustum at a distance r from the axis of rotation is

Solution 
We are to determine the torque required to rotate the outer cylinder of two 
concentric cylinders, with the outer cylinder rotating and the inner cylinder stationary. 
 
Assumptions 1 The fluid is incompressible and Newtonian. 2 End effects (top and bottom) 
are negligible. 3 The gap is very small so that wall curvature effects are negligible. 4 The gap 
is so small that the velocity profile in the gap is linear. 
 
Analysis 
We assume a linear velocity profile between the two walls – the outer wall is moving at speed V = oRo and 
the inner wall is stationary. The thickness of the gap is h, and we let y be the distance from the outer wall into the fluid 
(towards the inner wall) as sketched. Thus,

But the torque is the tangential force times the moment arm Ro. Also, we are asked for the torque required to turn the inner 
cylinder. This applied torque is counterclockwise (mathematically positive). Thus,

Discussion 
The above is only an approximation because we assumed a linear velocity profile. As long as the gap is very 
small, and therefore the wall curvature effects are negligible, this approximation should be very good. It is possible to solve 
for the exact velocity profile for this problem, and therefore the torque can be found analytically, but this has to wait until 
the differential analysis chapter.

A large plate is pulled at a constant speed over a fixed plate. The space between the plates is filled with 
engine oil. The shear stress developed on the upper plate and its direction are to be determined for parabolic and linear 
velocity profile cases.  
Assumptions 1 The thickness of the plate is negligible.  
Properties 
The viscosity of oil is  = 0.8374 Pas (Table A-7). 
Analysis  
 
 
Considering a parabolic profile we would have 
, where 
 is a constant.  Since 
 when 
, we write 
 
 
 
Then the velocity profile becomes 
 
 
 
Assuming Newtonian behavior, the shear stress on the upper wall is 
 
 
 
or 
 
 
 
Since dynamic viscosity of oil is 
 (see Table A7). If we assume a linear profile we will have  
 
 
 
Then the shear stress in this case would be 
 
 
 
Therefore we conclude that the linear assumption is not realistic since it gives over prediction.

Solution 
A cylinder slides down from rest in a vertical tube whose inner surface is covered by oil. An expression for 
the velocity of the cylinder as a function of time is to be derived. 
Assumptions 1 Velocity profile in the oil film is linear.  
Analysis  
 
 
 
 
Assuming a linear velocity profile in the oil film the drag force due to wall shear stress can be expressed as 
 
 
where  is the instantaneous velocity of the cylinder and  
 
 
Applying Newton’s second law of motion for the cylinder, we write 
 
where  is the time. This is a first-order linear equation and can be expressed in standard form as follows: 
 
whose solution is obtained to be 
 
As 
 the second term will vanish leaving us with 
 
which is constant. This constant is referred to as “limit velocity, 
”. Rearranging for viscosity, we have 
 
Therefore this equation enables us to estimate dynamic viscosity of oil provided that the limit velocity of the cylinder is 
precisely measured.

Surface Tension and Capillary Effect 
 
 
 
2-96C  
Solution 
We are to define and discuss surface tension.  
 
Analysis 
The magnitude of the pulling force at the surface of a liquid per unit length is called surface tension s.  
It is caused by the attractive forces between the molecules. The surface tension is also surface energy (per unit area) since it 
represents the stretching work that needs to be done to increase the surface area of the liquid by a unit amount. 
 
Discussion 
Surface tension is the cause of some very interesting phenomena such as capillary rise and insects that can 
walk on water. 
 
 
 
 
2-97C  
Solution 
We are to determine whether the level of liquid in a tube will rise or fall due to the capillary effect.  
 
Analysis 
The liquid level in the tube will drop since the contact angle is greater than 90, and cos(110) < 0. 
 
Discussion 
This liquid must be a non-wetting liquid when in contact with the tube material. Mercury is an example of a 
non-wetting liquid with a contact angle (with glass) that is greater than 90o. 
 
 
 
 
2-98C  
Solution 
We are to define and discuss the capillary effect.  
 
Analysis 
The capillary effect is the rise or fall of a liquid in a small-diameter tube inserted into the liquid. It is 
caused by the net effect of the cohesive forces (the forces between like molecules, like water) and adhesive forces (the 
forces between unlike molecules, like water and glass).  The capillary effect is proportional to the cosine of the contact 
angle, which is the angle that the tangent to the liquid surface makes with the solid surface at the point of contact. 
 
Discussion 
The contact angle determines whether the meniscus at the top of the column is concave or convex. 
 
 
 
 
2-99C  
Solution 
We are to analyze the pressure difference between inside and outside of a soap bubble.  
 
Analysis 
The pressure inside a soap bubble is greater than the pressure outside, as evidenced by the stretch of 
the soap film. 
 
Discussion 
You can make an analogy between the soap film and the skin of a balloon. 
 
 
 
 
2-100C  
Solution 
We are to compare the capillary rise in small and large diameter tubes.  
 
Analysis 
The capillary rise is inversely proportional to the diameter of the tube, and thus capillary rise is greater in 
the smaller-diameter tube. 
 
Discussion 
Note however, that if the tube diameter is large enough, there is no capillary rise (or fall) at all. Rather, the 
upward (or downward) rise of the liquid occurs only near the tube walls; the elevation of the middle portion of the liquid in 
the tube does not change for large diameter tubes.

Solution 
A relation is to be derived for the capillary rise of a liquid between two large parallel plates a distance t 
apart inserted into a liquid vertically. The contact angle is given to be . 
Assumptions There are no impurities in the liquid, and no contamination on the surfaces of the plates.   
Analysis 
The magnitude of the capillary rise between two large parallel plates can be determined from a force 
balance on the rectangular liquid column of height h and width w between the plates. The bottom of the liquid column is at 
the same level as the free surface of the liquid reservoir, and thus the pressure there must be atmospheric pressure. This will 
balance the atmospheric pressure acting from the top surface, and thus these two effects will cancel each other. The weight 
of the liquid column is

Solution 
A journal bearing is lubricated with oil whose viscosity is 
known. The torques needed to overcome the bearing friction during start-up 
and steady operation are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The gap is uniform, and is completely filled with oil. 2 The 
end effects on the sides of the bearing are negligible. 3 The fluid is 
Newtonian. 
Properties 
The viscosity of oil is given to be 0.1 kg/ms at 20C, and 
0.008 kg/ms at 80C. 
Analysis 
The radius of the shaft is R = 0.04 m. Substituting the given

Solution 
A U-tube with a large diameter arm contains water. The difference between the water levels of the two arms 
is to be determined.  
Assumptions 1 Both arms of the U-tube are open to the atmosphere. 2 Water is at room temperature. 3 The contact angle 
of water is zero,  = 0. 
Properties 
The surface tension and density of water at 20C are s = 0.073 N/m and  = 1000 kg/m3.  
Analysis 
Any difference in water levels between the two arms is due to surface tension effects and thus capillary rise. 
Noting that capillary rise in a tube is inversely proportional to tube diameter there will be no capillary rise in the arm with a 
large diameter. Then the water level difference between the two arms is simply the capillary rise in the smaller diameter 
arm,

Solution 
The pressure in an automobile tire increases during a trip while its volume remains constant. The percent 
increase in the absolute temperature of the air in the tire is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The volume of the tire remains constant. 2 Air is an ideal gas. 
Analysis 
Noting that air is an ideal gas and the volume is constant, the ratio of absolute temperatures after and before 
the trip are

temperature increases to 1.047(293.15 K) = 306.92 K or about 33.8oC.

Solution 
The minimum pressure on the suction side of a water pump is given. The maximum water temperature to 
avoid the danger of cavitation is to be determined. 
Properties 
The saturation temperature of water at 0.95 psia is 100F. 
Analysis 
To avoid cavitation at a specified pressure, the fluid temperature everywhere in the flow should remain 
below the saturation temperature at the given pressure, which is

Therefore, T must remain below 100F to avoid the possibility of cavitation.   
Discussion 
Note that saturation temperature increases with pressure, and thus cavitation may occur at higher pressure at 
locations with higher fluid temperatures.

Solution 
Air in a partially filled closed water tank is evacuated. The absolute pressure in the evacuated space is to be 
determined. 
Properties 
The saturation pressure of water at 60C is 19.94 kPa. 
Analysis 
When air is completely evacuated, the vacated space is filled with water vapor, and the tank contains a 
saturated water-vapor mixture at the given pressure. Since we have a two-phase mixture of a pure substance at a specified 
temperature, the vapor pressure must be the saturation pressure at this temperature.  That is,

Solution 
We are to determine the inlet water speed at which cavitation is likely to occur in the throat of a converging-
diverging tube or duct, and repeat for a higher temperature. 
 
Assumptions 1 The fluid is incompressible and Newtonian. 2 Gravitational effects are negligible. 3 Irreversibilities are 
negligible. 4 The equations provided are valid for this flow. 
 
Properties 
For water at 20oC,  = 998.0 kg/m3 and Psat = 2.339 kPa. 
 
Analysis 
(a) Two equations are given for velocity, pressure, and cross-sectional area, namely,

But the pressure at which cavitation is likely to occur is the vapor (saturation) pressure of the water. We also know that 
throat diameter D2 is 1/20 times the inlet diameter D1, and since A = D2/4, A1/A2 = (20)2 = 400. Thus,

So, the minimum inlet velocity at which cavitation is likely to occur is 0.0152 m/s (to three significant digits). The velocity 
at the throat is much faster than this, of course. Using Eq. (1),

(b) If the water is warmer (50oC), the density reduces to 988.1 kg/m3, and the vapor pressure increases to 12.35 kPa. At 
these conditions, V1 = 0.0103 m/s. As might be expected, at higher temperature, a lower inlet velocity is required to 
generate cavitation, since the water is warmer and already closer to its boiling point. 
 
Discussion 
Cavitation is usually undesirable since it leads to noise, and the collapse of the bubbles can be destructive. It 
is therefore often wise to design piping systems and turbomachinery to avoid cavitation.

Solution 
We are to explain how objects like razor blades and paper clips can float on water, even though they are 
much denser than water. 
 
Analysis 
Just as some insects like water striders can be supported on water by surface tension, surface tension is the 
key to explaining this phenomenon. If we think of surface tension like a skin on top of the water, somewhat like a 
stretched piece of balloon, we can understand how something heavier than water pushes down on the surface, but the 
surface tension forces counteract the weight (to within limits) by providing an upward force. Since soap decreases 
surface tension, we expect that it would be harder to float objects like this on a soapy surface; with a high enough soap 
concentration, in fact, we would expect that the razor blade or paper clip could not float at all. 
 
Discussion 
If the razor blade or paper clip is fully submerged (breaking through the surface tension), it sinks.

Pressure, Manometer, and Barometer 
 
 
 
3-1C  
Solution 
We are to examine a claim about absolute pressure.  
 
Analysis 
No, the absolute pressure in a liquid of constant density does not double when the depth is doubled. It 
is the gage pressure that doubles when the depth is doubled. 
 
Discussion 
This is analogous to temperature scales – when performing analysis using something like the ideal gas law, 
you must use absolute temperature (K), not relative temperature (oC), or you will run into the same kind of problem. 
 
 
 
 
3-2C  
Solution 
We are to compare the pressure on the surfaces of a cube.  
 
Analysis 
Since pressure increases with depth, the pressure on the bottom face of the cube is higher than that on 
the top. The pressure varies linearly along the side faces. However, if the lengths of the sides of the tiny cube suspended 
in water by a string are very small, the magnitudes of the pressures on all sides of the cube are nearly the same. 
 
Discussion 
In the limit of an “infinitesimal cube”, we have a fluid particle, with pressure P defined at a “point”. 
 
 
 
 
3-3C  
Solution 
We are to define Pascal’s law and give an example.  
 
Analysis 
Pascal’s law states that the pressure applied to a confined fluid increases the pressure throughout by 
the same amount. This is a consequence of the pressure in a fluid remaining constant in the horizontal direction. An 
example of Pascal’s principle is the operation of the hydraulic car jack. 
 
Discussion 
Students may have various answers to the last part of the question. The above discussion applies to fluids at 
rest (hydrostatics). When fluids are in motion, Pascal’s principle does not necessarily apply. However, as we shall see in 
later chapters, the differential equations of incompressible fluid flow contain only pressure gradients, and thus an increase 
in pressure in the whole system does not affect fluid motion. 
 
 
 
 
3-4C  
Solution 
We are to compare the volume and mass flow rates of two fans at different elevations.  
 
Analysis 
The density of air at sea level is higher than the density of air on top of a high mountain. Therefore, the 
volume flow rates of the two fans running at identical speeds will be the same, but the mass flow rate of the fan at sea 
level will be higher. 
 
Discussion 
In reality, the fan blades on the high mountain would experience less frictional drag, and hence the fan 
motor would not have as much resistance – the rotational speed of the fan on the mountain may be slightly higher than that 
at sea level.

3-5C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the difference between gage pressure and absolute pressure.  
 
Analysis 
The pressure relative to the atmospheric pressure is called the gage pressure, and the pressure relative 
to an absolute vacuum is called absolute pressure. 
 
Discussion 
Most pressure gages (like your bicycle tire gage) read relative to atmospheric pressure, and therefore read 
the gage pressure. 
 
 
 
 
3-6C  
Solution 
We are to explain nose bleeding and shortness of breath at high elevation.  
 
Analysis 
Atmospheric air pressure which is the external pressure exerted on the skin decreases with increasing 
elevation. Therefore, the pressure is lower at higher elevations. As a result, the difference between the blood pressure 
in the veins and the air pressure outside increases.  This pressure imbalance may cause some thin-walled veins such 
as the ones in the nose to burst, causing bleeding.  The shortness of breath is caused by the lower air density at higher 
elevations, and thus lower amount of oxygen per unit volume. 
 
Discussion 
People who climb high mountains like Mt. Everest suffer other physical problems due to the low pressure.

Solution 
A gas is contained in a vertical cylinder with a heavy piston. The pressure inside the cylinder and the effect 
of volume change on pressure are to be determined. 
 
Assumptions Friction between the piston and the cylinder is negligible. 
 
Analysis 
(a) The gas pressure in the piston–cylinder device depends on the atmospheric pressure and the weight of 
the piston. Drawing the free-body diagram of the piston as shown in Fig. 3–20 and balancing the vertical forces yield

(b) The volume change will have no effect on the free-body diagram drawn in part (a), and therefore we do not expect the 
pressure inside the cylinder to change – it will remain the same. 
 
Discussion 
If the gas behaves as an ideal gas, the absolute temperature doubles when the volume is doubled at constant 
pressure.

Solution 
The pressure in a tank is measured with a manometer by measuring the differential height of the manometer 
fluid.  The absolute pressure in the tank is to be determined for two cases: the manometer arm with the (a) higher and (b) 
lower fluid level being attached to the tank. 
Assumptions The fluid in the manometer is incompressible.   
Properties 
The specific gravity of the fluid is given to be SG = 1.25. The density of water at 32F is 62.4 lbm/ft3. 
Analysis 
The density of the fluid is obtained by multiplying its specific gravity by the density of water,

Solution 
The pressure in a pressurized water tank is measured by a multi-fluid manometer. The gage pressure of air in 
the tank is to be determined. 
Assumptions The air pressure in the tank is uniform (i.e., its variation with elevation is negligible due to its low density), 
and thus we can determine the pressure at the air-water interface.  
Properties 
The densities of mercury, water, and oil are given to be 13,600, 1000, and 850 kg/m3, respectively.  
Analysis 
Starting with the pressure at point 1 at the air-water interface, and moving along the tube by adding (as we 
go down) or subtracting (as we go up) the 
gh

 terms until we reach point 2, and setting the result equal to Patm since the

The mass of a woman is given. The minimum imprint area per shoe needed to enable her to walk on the 
snow without sinking is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The weight of the person is distributed uniformly on the imprint area of the shoes. 2 One foot carries the 
entire weight of a person during walking, and the shoe is sized for walking conditions (rather than standing). 3 The weight 
of the shoes is negligible.

Solution 
Water is raised from a reservoir through a vertical tube by the sucking action of a piston. The force needed 
to raise the water to a specified height is to be determined, and the pressure at the piston face is to be plotted against height. 
 
Assumptions 1 Friction between the piston and the cylinder is negligible. 2 Accelerational effects are negligible. 
 
Properties 
We take the density of water to be  = 1000 kg/m3. 
Analysis 
Noting that the pressure at the free surface is  Patm and hydrostatic pressure in a fluid decreases linearly with

Discussion 
The manometer with water is more precise since the column height is bigger (better resolution). However, a 
column of water more than 8 meters high would be impractical, so mercury is the better choice of manometer fluid here. 
Note: Mercury vapors are hazardous, and the use of mercury is no longer encouraged.

Solution 
The previous problem is reconsidered. The effect of the manometer fluid density in the range of 800 to 
13,000 kg/m3 on the differential fluid height of the manometer is to be investigated. Differential fluid height is to be plotted 
as a function of the density, and the results are to be discussed. 
 
Analysis 
The EES Equations window is printed below, followed by the tabulated and plotted results. 
 
Function fluid_density(Fluid$) 
 
If fluid$='Mercury' then  fluid_density=13600 else fluid_density=1000 
end 
 
{Input from the diagram window.  If the diagram window is hidden, then all of the input must come from the 
equations window.  Also note that brackets can also denote comments - but these comments do not appear in the 
formatted equations window.} 
 
{Fluid$='Mercury' 
P_atm = 101.325                           "kpa" 
DELTAP=80  
           "kPa  Note how DELTAP is displayed on the Formatted Equations Window."} 
 
g=9.807                                           "m/s2, local acceleration of gravity at sea level" 
rho=Fluid_density(Fluid$)       "Get the fluid density, either Hg or H2O, from the function" 
"To plot fluid height against density place {} around the above equation.  Then set up the parametric table and solve."  
DELTAP = RHO*g*h/1000     
"Instead of dividing by 1000 Pa/kPa we could have multiplied by the EES function, CONVERT('Pa','kPa')" 
h_mm=h*convert('m','mm')       "The fluid height in mm is found using the built-in CONVERT function." 
P_abs= P_atm + DELTAP      
 
"To make the graph, hide the diagram window and remove the {}brackets from Fluid$ and from P_atm.  Select New 
Parametric Table from the Tables menu.  Choose P_abs, DELTAP and h to be in the table.  Choose Alter Values from 
the Tables menu.  Set values of h to range from 0 to 1 in steps of 0.2.  Choose Solve Table (or press F3) from the 
Calculate menu.  Choose New Plot Window from the Plot menu.  Choose to plot P_abs vs h and then choose Overlay 
Plot from the Plot menu and plot DELTAP on the same scale."

Discussion 
This problem can also be solved by noting that the atmospheric pressure (1 atm = 101.325 kPa) is equivalent 
to 10.3-m of water height, and finding the pressure that corresponds to a water height of 1.73 m.

Solution 
Water is poured into the U-tube from one arm and oil from the other arm. The water column height in one 
arm and the ratio of the heights of the two fluids in the other arm are given. The height of each fluid in that arm is to be 
determined. 
Assumptions Both water and oil are incompressible substances.

The density of oil is given to be oil = 790 kg/m3. We take the density of water to be w =1000 kg/m3. 
Analysis 
The height of water column in the left arm of the manometer is given to be hw1 = 0.70 m. We let the height 
of water and oil in the right arm to be hw2 and ha, respectively. Then, ha = 6hw2. Noting that both arms are open to the 
atmosphere, the pressure at the bottom of the U-tube can be expressed as

Solution 
The hydraulic lift in a car repair shop is to lift cars. The fluid gage pressure that must be maintained in the 
reservoir is to be determined. 
Assumptions The weight of the piston of the lift is negligible.

The densities of seawater and mercury are given to 
be sea = 1035 kg/m3 and Hg = 13,600 kg/m3. We take the density 
of water to be w =1000 kg/m3.

Therefore, the pressure in the fresh water pipe is 5.39 kPa higher than the pressure in the sea water pipe. 
Discussion 
A 0.70-m high air column with a density of 1.2 kg/m3 corresponds to a pressure difference of 0.008 kPa. 
Therefore, its effect on the pressure difference between the two pipes is negligible.

Solution 
The pressure in a natural gas pipeline is measured by a double U-tube manometer with one of the arms open 
to the atmosphere. The absolute pressure in the pipeline is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 All the liquids are incompressible.  2 The effect of air column on pressure is negligible. 3 The pressure 
throughout the natural gas (including the tube) is uniform since its density is low.  
Properties 
We take the density of water to be w = 62.4 lbm/ft3. The specific gravity of mercury is given to be 13.6, and 
thus its density is Hg = 13.662.4 = 848.6 lbm/ft3.  
Analysis 
Starting with the pressure at point 1 in the natural gas pipeline, and moving along the tube by adding (as we 
go down) or subtracting (as we go up) the

The gage pressure of air in a pressurized water tank is measured simultaneously by both a pressure gage and 
a manometer. The differential height h of the mercury column is to be determined.

and thus the pressure at the air-water interface is the same as the indicated gage pressure.

Solution 
A load on a hydraulic lift is to be raised by pouring oil from a thin tube. The height of oil in the tube 
required in order to raise that weight is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The cylinders of the lift are vertical. 2 There are no leaks. 3 Atmospheric pressure act on both sides, and 
thus it can be disregarded. 
Properties 
The density of oil is given to be  =780 kg/m3.  
Analysis 
Noting that pressure is force per unit area, the gage pressure in the fluid under the load is simply the ratio of 
the weight to the area of the lift,

Therefore, the pressure in the left oil tank is 14.9 psia higher than the pressure in the right oil tank. 
 
Discussion 
Note that large pressure differences can be measured conveniently by mercury manometers. If a water 
manometer were used in this case, the differential height would be over 30 ft.

The standard atmospheric pressure is expressed in terms of mercury, water, and glycerin columns. 
Assumptions  The densities of fluids are constant. 
Properties 
The specific gravities are given to be SG = 13.6 for mercury, SG = 1.0 for water, and SG = 1.26 for 
glycerin. The standard density of water is 1000 kg/m3, and the standard atmospheric pressure is 101,325 Pa.

Discussion 
Using water or glycerin to measure atmospheric pressure requires very long vertical tubes (over 10 m for 
water), which is not practical. This explains why mercury is used instead of water or a light fluid.

Solution 
Two chambers with the same fluid at their base are separated by a piston. The gage pressure in each air 
chamber is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 Water is an incompressible substance. 2 The 
variation of pressure with elevation in each air chamber  is 
negligible because of the low density of air.  
Properties 
We take the density of water to be  =1000 
kg/m3.  
 
Analysis 
The piston is in equilibrium, and thus the net 
force acting on the piston must be zero. A vertical force 
balance on the piston involves the pressure force exerted by 
water on the piston face, the atmospheric pressure force, and 
the piston weight, and yields

Solution 
A double-fluid manometer attached to an air pipe is considered. The specific gravity of one fluid is known, 
and the specific gravity of the other fluid is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 Densities of liquids are constant. 2 The air pressure in the tank is uniform (i.e., its variation with elevation 
is negligible due to its low density), and thus the pressure at the air-water interface is the same as the indicated gage 
pressure.  
Properties 
The specific gravity of one fluid is given to be 13.55. We take the standard density of water to be 1000 
kg/m3.  
Analysis 
Starting with the pressure of air in the tank, and moving along the tube by adding (as we go down) or 
subtracting (as we go up) the

Solution 
The pressure difference between two pipes is measured by a double-fluid manometer. For given fluid 
heights and specific gravities, the pressure difference between the pipes is to be calculated. 
Assumptions All the liquids are incompressible. 
Properties 
The specific gravities are given to be 13.5 for mercury, 1.26 for glycerin, and 0.88 for oil. We take the 
standard density of water to be w =1000 kg/m3.

Using a manometer between two pipes is not recommended unless the pressures in the two pipes are

creating a short circuit.

Solution 
The fluid levels in a multi-fluid U-tube manometer change as a result of a pressure drop in the trapped air 
space. For a given pressure drop and brine level change, the area ratio is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 All the liquids are incompressible. 2 Pressure in the brine pipe remains constant. 3 The variation of 
pressure in the trapped air space is negligible. 
Properties 
The specific gravities are given to be 13.56 for mercury and 1.1 for brine. We take the standard density of 
water to be w =1000 kg/m3. 
Analysis 
 It is clear from the problem statement and the figure that the brine pressure is much higher than the air 
pressure, and when the air pressure drops by 0.9 kPa, the pressure difference between the brine and the air space also 
increases by the same amount. Starting with the air pressure (point A) and moving along the tube by adding (as we go down) 
or subtracting (as we go up) the 
gh

 terms until we reach the brine pipe (point B), and setting the result equal to PB  before 
and after the pressure change of air give

We are to determine the force required to lift a car with a hydraulic jack at two different elevations. 
 
Assumptions 1 The oil is incompressible. 2 The 
system is at rest during the analysis (hydrostatics).

Thus, after the car has been raised 2 meters, the required force is 27.4 N. 
 
Comparing the two results, it takes more force to keep the car elevated than it does to hold it at h = 0. This makes sense 
physically because the elevation difference generates a higher pressure (and thus a higher required force) at the 
lower piston due to hydrostatics. 
 
Discussion 
When h = 0, the specific gravity (or density) of the hydraulic fluid does not enter the calculation – the 
problem simplifies to setting the two pressure equal. However, when h  0, there is a hydrostatic head and therefore the 
density of the fluid enters the calculation.

Fluid Statics: Hydrostatic Forces on Plane and Curved Surfaces 
 
 
 
3-60C  
Solution 
We are to define resultant force and center of pressure.  
 
Analysis 
The resultant hydrostatic force acting on a submerged surface is the resultant of the pressure forces 
acting on the surface. The point of application of this resultant force is called the center of pressure. 
 
Discussion 
The center of pressure is generally not at the center of the body, due to hydrostatic pressure variation. 
 
 
 
 
3-61C  
Solution 
We are to examine a claim about hydrostatic force.  
 
Analysis 
Yes, because the magnitude of the resultant force acting on a plane surface of a completely submerged body 
in a homogeneous fluid is equal to the product of the pressure PC at the centroid of the surface and the area A of the surface. 
The pressure at the centroid of the surface is
C
C
gh
P
P



0
 where 
C
h  is the vertical distance of the centroid from the free 
surface of the liquid. 
 
Discussion 
We have assumed that we also know the pressure at the liquid surface. 
 
 
 
 
3-62C  
Solution 
We are to consider the effect of plate rotation on the hydrostatic force on the plate surface.  
 
Analysis 
There will be no change on the hydrostatic force acting on the top surface of this submerged horizontal flat 
plate as a result of this rotation since the magnitude of the resultant force acting on a plane surface of a completely 
submerged body in a homogeneous fluid is equal to the product of the pressure PC at the centroid of the surface and the area 
A of the surface. 
 
Discussion 
If the rotation were not around the centroid, there would be a change in the force. 
 
 
 
 
3-63C  
Solution 
We are to explain why dams are bigger at the bottom than at the top.  
 
Analysis 
Dams are built much thicker at the bottom because the pressure force increases with depth, and the 
bottom part of dams are subjected to largest forces. 
 
Discussion 
Dam construction requires an enormous amount of concrete, so tapering the dam in this way saves a lot of 
concrete, and therefore a lot of money. 
 
 
 
 
3-64C  
Solution 
We are to explain how to determine the horizontal component of hydrostatic force on a curved surface.  
 
Analysis 
The horizontal component of the hydrostatic force acting on a curved surface is equal (in both magnitude 
and the line of action) to the hydrostatic force acting on the vertical projection of the curved surface. 
 
Discussion 
We could also integrate pressure along the surface, but the method discussed here is much simpler and 
yields the same answer.

Solution 
We are to explain how to determine the vertical component of hydrostatic force on a curved surface. 
 
Analysis 
The vertical component of the hydrostatic force acting on a curved surface is equal to the hydrostatic force 
acting on the horizontal projection of the curved surface, plus (minus, if acting in the opposite direction) the weight of 
the fluid block. 
 
Discussion 
We could also integrate pressure along the surface, but the method discussed here is much simpler and 
yields the same answer.

Solution 
We are to explain how to determine the line of action on a circular surface.  
 
Analysis 
The resultant hydrostatic force acting on a circular surface always passes through the center of the circle 
since the pressure forces are normal to the surface, and all lines normal to the surface of a circle pass through the center of 
the circle. Thus the pressure forces form a concurrent force system at the center, which can be reduced to a single equivalent 
force at that point. If the magnitudes of the horizontal and vertical components of the resultant hydrostatic force are known, 
the tangent of the angle the resultant hydrostatic force makes with the horizontal is

Discussion 
This fact makes analysis of circular-shaped surfaces simple. There is no corresponding simplification for 
shapes other than circular, unfortunately.

Solution 
A car is submerged in water. The hydrostatic force on the door and its line of action are to be determined for 
the cases of the car containing atmospheric air and the car is filled with water. 
Assumptions 1 The bottom surface of the lake is horizontal. 2 The door can be approximated as a vertical rectangular 
plate. 3 The pressure in the car remains at atmospheric value since there is no water leaking in, and thus no compression of 
the air inside. Therefore, we can ignore the atmospheric pressure in calculations since it acts on both sides of the door. 
Properties 
We take the density of lake water to be 1000 kg/m3 throughout. 
Analysis 
(a) When the car is well-sealed and thus the pressure inside the car is the atmospheric pressure,  the average 
pressure on the outer surface of the door is the pressure at the centroid (midpoint) of the surface, and is determined to be

(b) When the car is filled with water, the net force normal to the surface of the door is zero since the pressure on both sides 
of the door will be the same. 
Discussion 
Note that it is impossible for a person to open the door of the car when it is filled with atmospheric air. But 
it takes little effort to open the door when car is filled with water, because then the pressure on each side of the door is the 
same.

Solution 
The height of a water reservoir is controlled by a cylindrical gate hinged to the reservoir. The hydrostatic 
force on the cylinder and the weight of the cylinder per ft length are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The hinge is frictionless. 2 Atmospheric pressure acts on both sides of the gate, and thus it can be ignored 
in calculations for convenience. 
Properties 
We take the density of water to be 62.4 lbm/ft3 throughout.  
Analysis 
(a) We consider the free body diagram of the liquid block enclosed by the circular surface of the cylinder 
and its vertical and horizontal projections. The hydrostatic forces acting on the vertical and horizontal plane surfaces as well 
as the weight of the liquid block per ft length of the cylinder are:

Therefore, the magnitude of the hydrostatic force acting on the cylinder is 2521 lbf per ft length of the cylinder, and its line 
of action passes through the center of the cylinder making an angle 46.1 upwards from the horizontal. 
 
(b) When the water level is 15-ft high, the gate opens and the reaction force at the bottom of the cylinder becomes zero. 
Then the forces other than those at the hinge acting on the cylinder are its weight, acting through the center, and the 
hydrostatic force exerted by water. Taking a moment about the point A where the hinge is and equating it to zero gives

For small surfaces deep in a liquid, the pressure center nearly coincides with the centroid of the surface.  
Here, in fact, to three significant digits in the final answer, the center of pressure and centroid are coincident. We give the

Solution 
A rectangular plate hinged about a horizontal axis along its upper edge blocks a fresh water channel. The 
plate is restrained from opening by a fixed ridge at a point B. The force exerted to the plate by the ridge is to be determined. 
Assumptions Atmospheric pressure acts on both sides of the plate, and thus it can be ignored in calculations for 
convenience. 
Properties 
We take the density of water to be 1000 kg/m3 throughout.

Solution 
The flow of water from a reservoir is controlled by an L-shaped gate hinged at a point A. The required 
weight W for the gate to open at a specified water height is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 Atmospheric pressure acts on both sides of the gate, and thus it can be ignored in calculations for 
convenience. 2 The weight of the gate is negligible. 
Properties 
We take the density of water to be 62.4 lbm/ft3 throughout.

Solution 
Two parts of a water trough of semi-circular cross-section are held together by cables placed along the 
length of the trough. The tension T in each cable when the trough is full is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 Atmospheric pressure acts on both sides of the trough wall, and thus it can be ignored in calculations for 
convenience. 2 The weight of the trough is negligible. 
Properties 
We take the density of water to be 1000 kg/m3 throughout. 
Analysis 
To expose the cable tension, we consider half of the trough whose cross-section is quarter-circle. The 
hydrostatic forces acting on the vertical and horizontal plane surfaces as well as the weight of the liquid block are:

Solution 
A cylindrical tank is fully filled by water. The hydrostatic force on the surface A is to be determined for 
three different pressures on the water surface. 
Assumptions Atmospheric pressure acts on both sides of the cylinder, and thus it can be ignored in calculations for 
convenience.

Solution 
An open settling tank contains liquid suspension. The density of the suspension depends on liquid depth 
linearly. The resultant force acting on the gate and its line of action are to be determined.

Solution 
A tank is filled by oil. The magnitude and the location of the line of action of the resultant force acting on 
the surface and the pressure force acting on the surface are to be determined. 
Assumptions Atmospheric pressure acts on both sides of the gate, and thus it can be ignored in calculations for 
convenience.  
Properties 
The specific gravity of oil is given.

Solution 
Two parts of a water trough of triangular cross-section are held together by cables placed along the length of 
the trough. The tension T in each cable when the trough is filled to the rim is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 Atmospheric pressure acts on both sides of the trough wall, and thus it can be ignored in calculations for 
convenience. 2 The weight of the trough is negligible. 
Properties 
We take the density of water to be 1000 kg/m3 throughout. 
Analysis 
To expose the cable tension, we consider half of the trough whose cross-section is triangular. The water 
height h at the midsection of the trough and width of the free surface are

Properties 
We take the density of water to be 1000 kg/m3 throughout. 
Analysis 
To expose the cable tension, we consider half of the trough whose cross-section is triangular. The water 
height is given to be h = 0.4 m at the midsection of the trough, which is equivalent to the width of the free surface b since  
tan 45 = b/h = 1. The hydrostatic forces acting on the vertical and horizontal plane surfaces as well as the weight of the 
liquid block are determined as follows:

Solution 
A retaining wall against mud slide is to be constructed by rectangular concrete blocks. The mud height at

Solution 
A quarter-circular gate hinged about its upper edge controls the flow of water over the ledge at B where the 
gate is pressed by a spring. The minimum spring force required to keep the gate closed when the water level rises to A at the 
upper edge of the gate is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The hinge is frictionless. 2 Atmospheric pressure acts on both sides of the gate, and thus it can be ignored 
in calculations for convenience. 3 The weight of the gate is negligible. 
Properties 
We take the density of water to be 1000 kg/m3 throughout.  
Analysis 
We consider the free body diagram of the liquid block enclosed by the circular surface of the gate and its 
vertical and horizontal projections. The hydrostatic forces acting on the vertical and horizontal plane surfaces as well as the 
weight of the liquid block are determined as follows:

Solution 
A quarter-circular gate hinged about its upper edge controls the flow of water over the ledge at B where the 
gate is pressed by a spring. The minimum spring force required to keep the gate closed when the water level rises to A at the 
upper edge of the gate is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The hinge is frictionless. 2 Atmospheric pressure acts on both sides of the gate, and thus it can be ignored 
in calculations for convenience. 3 The weight of the gate is negligible. 
Properties 
We take the density of water to be 1000 kg/m3 throughout.  
Analysis 
We consider the free body diagram of the liquid block enclosed by the circular surface of the gate and its 
vertical and horizontal projections. The hydrostatic forces acting on the vertical and horizontal plane surfaces as well as the 
weight of the liquid block are determined as follows:

Solution 
We are to determine the force on the upper face of a submerged flat plate. 
 
Assumptions 1 The water is incompressible. 2 The system is at 
rest during the analysis (hydrostatics). 3 Atmospheric pressure is 
ignored since it acts on both sides of the plate. 
 
Analysis 
(a) At first, and as a good approximation as plate 
thickness t approaches zero, the pressure force is simply F = gHA 
= gHbw, since the centroid of the plate is at its center regardless 
of the tilt angle. However, the plate thickness must be taken into 
account since we are concerned with the upper face of the plate. 
Some trig yields that the depth of water from the surface to the 
centroid of the upper plate is H – (t/2)cos, i.e., somewhat smaller 
than H itself since the upper face of the plate is above the center of 
the plate when it is tilted ( > 0). Thus,

Thus, the “gage” force (ignoring atmospheric pressure) on the upper plate surface is 
11,400 N
F 
 (to three digits). 
 
Discussion 
If we ignore plate thickness (set t = 0), the result becomes 12,200 N, which represents an error of around 
7%, since the plate here is fairly thick.

An inclined gate separates water from another fluid. The volume of the concrete block to keep the gate at the

A parabolic shaped gate is hinged. The force needed to keep the gate stationary is to be determined. 
Assumptions Atmospheric pressure acts on both sides of the gate, and thus it can be ignored in calculations for 
convenience.

Analysis

Buoyancy 
 
 
 
3-94C  
Solution 
We are to define and discuss the buoyant force.  
 
Analysis 
The upward force a fluid exerts on an immersed body is called the buoyant force. The buoyant force is 
caused by the increase of pressure in a fluid with depth. The magnitude of the buoyant force acting on a submerged 
body whose volume is V is expressed as 
V
g
F
f
B


. The direction of the buoyant force is upwards, and its line of action 
passes through the centroid of the displaced volume. 
 
Discussion 
If the buoyant force is greater than the body’s weight, it floats. 
 
 
 
 
 
3-95C  
Solution 
We are to compare the buoyant force on two spheres.  
 
Analysis 
The magnitude of the buoyant force acting on a submerged body whose volume is V is expressed as 
V
g
F
f
B


, which is independent of depth. Therefore, the buoyant forces acting on two identical spherical balls 
submerged in water at different depths is the same. 
 
Discussion 
Buoyant force depends only on the volume of the object, not its density.

acting on the 5-cm diameter aluminum and iron balls submerged in water is the same. 
 
Discussion 
Buoyant force depends only on the volume of the object, not its density.



, which is independent of the shape of the body. Therefore, the buoyant forces acting on the cube and 
sphere made of copper submerged in water are the same since they have the same volume. 
 
Discussion 
The two objects have the same volume because they have the same mass and density.

Solution 
We are to discuss the stability of a submerged and a floating body.  
 
Analysis 
A submerged body whose center of gravity G is above the center of buoyancy B, which is the centroid 
of the displaced volume, is unstable.  But a floating body may still be stable when G is above B since the centroid of 
the displaced volume shifts to the side to a point B’ during a rotational disturbance while the center of gravity G of 
the body remains unchanged. If the point B’ is sufficiently far, these two forces create a restoring moment, and return the 
body to the original position. 
 
Discussion 
Stability analysis like this is critical in the design of ship hulls, so that they are least likely to capsize.

Solution 
The density of a liquid is to be determined by a hydrometer by establishing division marks in water and in 
the liquid, and measuring the distance between these marks. 
Properties 
We take the density of pure water to be 1000 kg/m3.  
Analysis 
A hydrometer floating in water is in static equilibrium, and the buoyant force FB exerted by the liquid must 
always be equal to the weight W of the hydrometer, FB = W.

Solution 
A concrete block is lowered into the sea. The tension in the rope is to be determined before and after the 
block is immersed in water. 
Assumptions 1 The buoyancy force in air is negligible. 2 The weight of the rope is negligible.   
Properties 
The density of steel block is given to be 494 lbm/ft3. 
Analysis 
(a) The forces acting on the concrete block in air are its downward weight and the upward pull action 
(tension) by the rope. These two forces must balance each other, and thus the tension in the rope must be equal to the weight 
of the block:

Solution 
The height of the portion of a cubic ice block that extends above the water surface is measured. The height 
of the ice block below the surface is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The buoyancy force in air is negligible. 2 The top surface of the ice block is parallel to the surface of the 
sea.   
Properties 
The specific gravities of ice and seawater are given to be 0.92 and 1.025, respectively, and thus the 
corresponding densities are 920 kg/m3 and 1025 kg/m3.   
Analysis 
The weight of a body floating in a fluid is equal to the buoyant force acting on it (a consequence of vertical 
force balance from static equilibrium). Therefore, in this case the average density of the body must be equal to the density of 
the fluid since

Note that 0.92/1.025 = 0.89756, so approximately 90% of the volume of an ice block remains under water. 
For symmetrical ice blocks this also represents the fraction of height that remains under water.

which is considerably less than the density of gold. Therefore, the crown is NOT made of pure gold. 
Discussion 
This problem can also be solved without doing any under-water weighing as follows: We would weigh a 
bucket half-filled with water, and drop the crown into it. After marking the new water level, we would take the crown out, 
and add water to the bucket until the water level rises to the mark. We would weigh the bucket again. Dividing the weight 
difference by the density of water and g will give the volume of the crown. Knowing both the weight and the volume of the 
crown, the density can easily be determined.

Solution 
The volume of the hull of a boat is given. The amounts of load the boat can carry in a lake and in the sea are 
to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The dynamic effects of the waves are disregarded.  2 The buoyancy force in air is negligible. 
Properties 
The density of sea water is given to be 1.031000 = 1030 kg/m3. We take the density of water to be 1000 
kg/m3.

Discussion 
Note that this boat can carry nearly 5400 kg more load in the sea than it can in fresh water. Fully-loaded 
boats in sea water should expect to sink into water deeper when they enter fresh water, such as a river where the port may 
be.

Fluids in Rigid-Body Motion 
 
 
 
3-109C  
Solution 
We are to discuss when a fluid can be treated as a rigid body.  
 
Analysis 
A moving body of fluid can be treated as a rigid body when there are no shear stresses (i.e., no motion 
between fluid layers relative to each other) in the fluid body. 
 
Discussion 
When there is no relative motion between fluid particles, there are no viscous stresses, and pressure (normal 
stress) is the only stress. 
 
 
 
 
 
3-110C  
Solution 
We are to compare the pressure at the bottom of a glass of water moving at various velocities.  
 
Analysis 
The water pressure at the bottom surface is the same for all cases since the acceleration for all four cases is 
zero.  
 
Discussion 
When any body, fluid or solid, moves at constant velocity, there is no acceleration, regardless of the 
direction of the movement. 
 
 
 
 
 
3-111C  
Solution 
We are to compare the pressure in a glass of water for stationary and accelerating conditions.  
 
Analysis 
The pressure at the bottom surface is constant when the glass is stationary. For a glass moving on a 
horizontal plane with constant acceleration, water will collect at the back but the water depth will remain constant at the 
center. Therefore, the pressure at the midpoint will be the same for both glasses. But the bottom pressure will be low at 
the front relative to the stationary glass, and high at the back (again relative to the stationary glass). Note that the 
pressure in all cases is the hydrostatic pressure, which is directly proportional to the fluid height. 
 
Discussion 
We ignore any sloshing of the water. 
 
 
 
 
 
3-112C  
Solution 
We are to analyze the pressure in a glass of water that is rotating.  
 
Analysis 
When a vertical cylindrical container partially filled with water is rotated about its axis and rigid body 
motion is established, the fluid level will drop at the center and rise towards the edges. Noting that hydrostatic pressure is 
proportional to fluid depth, the pressure at the mid point will drop and the pressure at the edges of the bottom surface 
will rise due to the rotation. 
 
Discussion 
The highest pressure occurs at the bottom corners of the container.

Solution 
A water tank is being towed by a truck on a level road, and the angle the free surface makes with the 
horizontal is measured. The acceleration of the truck is to be determined.  
Assumptions 1 The road is horizontal so that acceleration has no vertical component (az = 0). 
2 Effects of splashing, breaking, driving over bumps, and climbing hills are assumed to be 
secondary, and are not considered.  3 The acceleration remains constant.

vertical direction. The tangent of the angle the free surface makes with the horizontal is

Solution 
A vertical cylindrical tank open to the atmosphere is rotated about the centerline. The angular velocity at 
which the bottom of the tank will first be exposed, and the maximum water height at this moment are to be determined. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Assumptions 1 The increase in the rotational speed is very slow so that the liquid in the container always acts as a rigid 
body.  2 Water is an incompressible fluid.

Solution 
A vertical cylindrical milk tank is rotated at constant speed, and the pressure at the center of the bottom 
surface is measured. The pressure at the edge of the bottom surface is to be determined.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Assumptions 1 The increase in the rotational speed is very slow so that the liquid in the container always acts as a rigid 
body.  2 Milk is an incompressible substance.  
Properties 
The density of the milk is given to be 1030 kg/m3. 
Analysis 
Taking the center of the bottom surface of the rotating vertical cylinder as the origin (r = 0, z = 0), the 
equation for the free surface of the liquid is given as

Solution 
The bottom quarter of a vertical cylindrical tank is filled with oil  and the rest with water. The tank is now 
rotated about its vertical axis at a constant angular speed. The value of the angular speed when the point P on the axis at the 
oil-water interface touches the bottom of the tank and the amount of water that would be spilled out at this angular speed are 
to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The acceleration remains constant. 2 Water is an incompressible substance. 
Properties 
We take the density of water to be 1000 kg/m3. 
Analysis  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
When the steady-state conditions are achieved, the shape of the isobaric surface will be as below:

Milk is transported in a completely filled horizontal cylindrical tank accelerating at a specified rate. The 
maximum pressure difference in the tanker is to be determined. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Assumptions 1 The acceleration remains constant. 2 Milk is an incompressible substance. 
Properties 
The density of the milk is given to be 1020 kg/m3. 
Analysis 
We take the x- and z- axes as shown. The horizontal acceleration is in the negative x direction, and thus ax is 
negative. Also, there is no acceleration in the vertical direction, and thus az = 0. The pressure difference between two points

The first term is due to acceleration in the horizontal direction and the resulting compression effect towards the back of the 
tanker, while the second term is simply the hydrostatic pressure that increases with depth. Therefore, we reason that the 
lowest pressure in the tank will occur at point 1 (upper front corner), and the higher pressure at point 2 (the lower rear 
corner). Therefore, the maximum pressure difference in the  tank is

A water tank partially filled with water is being towed by a truck on a level road. The maximum acceleration 
(or deceleration) of the truck to avoid spilling is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The road is horizontal so that acceleration has no 
vertical component (az = 0). 2 Effects of splashing, breaking, driving 
over bumps, and climbing hills are assumed to be secondary, and are 
not considered.  3 The acceleration remains constant. 
Analysis 
We take the x-axis to be the direction of motion, the z-
axis to be the upward vertical direction. The shape of the free surface 
just before spilling is shown in figure. The tangent of the angle the free 
surface makes with the horizontal is given by

The solution can be repeated for deceleration by replacing ax by – ax. We obtain ax = –4.29 m/s2.

to fluid properties in the solution.

Solution 
Water is transported in a completely filled horizontal cylindrical tanker accelerating at a specified rate. The 
pressure difference between the front and back ends of the tank along a horizontal line when the truck accelerates and 
decelerates at  specified rates. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Assumptions 1 The acceleration remains constant. 2 Water is an incompressible substance. 
Properties 
We take the density of the water to be 1000 kg/m3. 
Analysis 
(a) We take the x- and z- axes as shown. The horizontal acceleration is in the negative x direction, and thus 
ax is negative. Also, there is no acceleration in the vertical direction, and thus az = 0. The pressure difference between two 
points 1 and 2 in an incompressible fluid in linear rigid body motion is given by

since z2 -  z1 = 0 along a horizontal line. Therefore, the pressure difference between the front and back of the tank is due to 
acceleration in the horizontal direction and the resulting compression effect towards the back of the tank. Then the pressure 
difference along a horizontal line becomes

Solution 
A rectangular tank is filled with heavy oil at the bottom and water at the top. The tank is now moved to the 
right horizontally with a constant acceleration and some water is spilled out as a result from the back. The height of the 
point A at the back of the tank on the oil-water interface that will rise under this acceleration is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The acceleration remains constant. 2 Water and oil are incompressible substances. 
Analysis  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Before the acceleration the water volume for unit width was

Solution 
One section of the duct of an air-conditioning system is laid underwater. The upward force the water 
exerts on the duct is to be determined.   
Assumptions 1 The diameter given is the outer diameter of the duct (or, the thickness of the duct material is negligible). 2 
The weight of the duct and the air in is negligible. 
Properties 
The density of air is given to be  = 1.30 kg/m3.  We take the density of water to be 1000 kg/m3.   
Analysis 
Noting that the weight of the duct and the air in it is negligible, the net upward force acting on the duct is the 
buoyancy force exerted by water. The volume of the underground section of the duct is

Solution 
A balloon is filled with helium gas. The maximum amount of load the balloon can carry is to be determined. 
Assumptions The weight of the cage and the ropes of the balloon is negligible.   
Properties 
The density of air is given to be  = 1.16 kg/m3. The density of 
helium gas is 1/7th of this. 
Analysis 
In the limiting case, the net force acting on the balloon will be zero.  
That is, the buoyancy force and the weight will balance each other:

Solution 
A barometer is used to measure the altitude of a plane relative to the ground. The barometric readings at the

Solution 
The gage pressure in a pressure cooker is maintained constant at 120 kPa by a petcock. The mass of the 
petcock is to be determined. 
Assumptions There is no blockage of the pressure release valve.   
Analysis 
Atmospheric pressure is acting on all surfaces of the petcock, which balances itself out.  Therefore, it can be 
disregarded in calculations if we use the gage pressure as the cooker pressure.  A force balance on the petcock (Fy = 0) 
yields

Solution 
Equal volumes of water and oil are poured into a U-tube from different arms, and the oil side is pressurized 
until the contact surface of the two fluids moves to the bottom and the liquid levels in both arms become the same. The 
excess pressure applied on the oil side is to be determined.  
Assumptions 1 Both water and oil are incompressible substances. 2 Oil does not mix with water. 3 The cross-sectional 
area of the U-tube is constant. 
Properties 
The density of oil is given to be oil = 49.3 lbm/ft3. We take the density of water to be w  = 62.4 lbm/ft3.

Solution 
An elastic air balloon submerged in water is attached to the base of the tank. The change in the tension force 
of the cable is to be determined when the tank pressure is increased and the balloon diameter is decreased in accordance 
with the relation P = CD-2. 
Assumptions 1 Atmospheric pressure acts on all surfaces, and thus it can be 
ignored in calculations for convenience. 2 Water is an incompressible fluid. 3 
The weight of the balloon and the air in it is negligible. 
Properties 
We take the density of water to be 1000 kg/m3.

The tension force on the cable holding the balloon is determined

Solution 
A gasoline line is connected to a pressure gage through a double-U manometer. For a given reading of the 
pressure gage, the gage pressure of the gasoline line is to be determined.  
Assumptions 1 All the liquids are incompressible.  2 The effect of air column on pressure is negligible. 
Properties 
The specific gravities of oil, mercury, and gasoline are given to be 0.79, 13.6, and 0.70, respectively. We 
take the density of water to be w  = 1000 kg/m3. 
Analysis 
Starting with the pressure indicated by the pressure gage and moving along the tube by adding (as we go 
down) or subtracting (as we go up) the 
gh

 terms until we reach the gasoline pipe, and setting the result equal to Pgasoline

Solution 
A water pipe is connected to a double-U manometer whose free arm is open to the atmosphere.  The 
absolute pressure at the center of the pipe is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 All the liquids are incompressible. 2 The solubility of the liquids in each other is negligible. 
Properties 
The specific gravities of mercury and oil are given to be 13.6 and 0.80, respectively. We take the density of 
water to be w  = 62.4 lbm/ft3.  
Analysis 
Starting with the pressure at the center of the water pipe, and moving along the tube by adding (as we go 
down) or subtracting (as we go up) the 
gh

Solution 
The pressure of water flowing through a pipe is measured by an arrangement that involves both a pressure 
gage and a manometer. For the values given, the pressure in the pipe is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 All the liquids are incompressible.  2 The effect of air column on pressure is negligible. 
Properties 
The specific gravity of gage fluid is given to be 2.4. We take the standard density of water to be w  = 1000 
kg/m3.

Starting with the pressure indicated by the pressure gage and moving along the tube by adding (as we go

Solution 
A U-tube filled with mercury except the 12-cm high portion at the top. Oil is poured into the left arm, 
forcing some mercury from the left arm into the right one. The maximum amount of oil that can be added into the left arm is 
to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 Both liquids are incompressible.  2 The U-tube is perfectly vertical.  
Properties 
The specific gravities are given to be 2.72 for oil and 13.6 for mercury.   
Analysis 
Initially, the mercury levels in both tubes are the same. When oil is poured into the left arm, it will push the 
mercury in the left down, which will cause the mercury level in the right arm to rise. Noting that the volume of mercury is 
constant, the decrease in the mercury volume in left column must be equal to the increase in the mercury volume in the right 
arm. Therefore, if the drop in mercury level in the left arm is x, the rise in the mercury level in the right arm h corresponding 
to a drop of x in the left arm is

Solution 
A rectangular gate hinged about a horizontal axis along its upper edge is restrained by a fixed ridge at point 
B. The force exerted to the plate by the ridge is to be determined. 
Assumptions Atmospheric pressure acts on both sides of the gate, and thus it can be ignored in calculations for 
convenience.   
Properties 
We take the density of water to be 1000 kg/m3 throughout. 
Analysis 
The average pressure on a surface is the pressure at the centroid 
(midpoint) of the surface, and multiplying it by the plate area gives the resultant 
hydrostatic force on the gate,

Solution 
A semicircular tunnel is to be built under a lake. The total hydrostatic force acting on the roof of the tunnel 
is to be determined. 
Assumptions Atmospheric pressure acts on both sides of the tunnel, 
and thus it can be ignored in calculations for convenience. 
Properties 
We take the density of water to be 62.4 lbm/ft3 
throughout.  
Analysis 
We consider the free body diagram of the liquid 
block enclosed by the circular surface of the tunnel and its vertical 
(on both sides) and horizontal projections. The hydrostatic forces 
acting on the vertical and horizontal plane surfaces as well as the 
weight of the liquid block are determined as follows:

This is also the net force acting on the tunnel since the horizontal forces acting on the right and left side of the tunnel cancel 
each other since they are equal and opposite.   
Discussion 
The weight of the two water bocks on the sides represents only about 3.3% of the total vertical force on the 
tunnel. Therefore, to obtain a reasonable first approximation for deep tunnels, these volumes can be neglected, yielding FV = 
2.596  108 lbf. A more conservative approximation would be to estimate the force on the bottom of the lake if the tunnel 
were not there. This yields FV = 2.995  108 lbf. The actual force is between these two estimates, as expected.

Solution 
A hemispherical dome on a level surface filled with water is to be lifted by attaching a long tube to the top 
and filling it with water. The required height of water in the tube to lift the dome is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 Atmospheric pressure acts on both sides of the dome, and thus it can be ignored in calculations for 
convenience. 2 The weight of the tube and the water in it is negligible. 
Properties 
We take the density of water to be 1000 kg/m3 throughout. 
Analysis 
We take the dome and the water in it as the system.  When the dome is about to rise, the reaction force 
between the dome and the ground becomes zero. Then the free body diagram of this system involves the weights of the 
dome and the water, balanced by the hydrostatic pressure force from below. Setting these forces equal to each other gives

Therefore, this dome can be lifted by attaching a tube which is about 1.72 m long.   
Discussion 
Note that the water pressure in the dome can be changed greatly 
by a small amount of water in the vertical tube. Two significant digits in the 
answer is sufficient for this problem.

Solution 
The water in a reservoir is restrained by a triangular wall. The total force (hydrostatic + atmospheric) acting 
on the inner surface of the wall and the horizontal component of this force are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 Atmospheric pressure acts on both sides of the gate, and thus it can be ignored in calculations for 
convenience. 2 Friction at the hinge is negligible.

Solution 
A U-tube that contains water in its right arm and another liquid in its left arm is rotated about an axis closer 
to the left arm. For a known rotation rate at which the liquid levels in both arms are the same, the density of the fluid in the 
left arm is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 Both the fluid and the water are incompressible fluids. 2 The 
two fluids meet at the axis of rotation, and thus there is only water to the right of 
the axis of rotation.  
Properties 
We take the density of water to be 1000 kg/m3.

incompressible fluid rotating in rigid body motion (the same fluid) is given by

Solution 
A vertical cylindrical tank is completely filled with gasoline, and the tank is rotated about its vertical axis at 
a specified rate while being accelerated upward. The pressures difference between the centers of the bottom and top 
surfaces, and the pressures difference between the center and the edge of the bottom surface are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The increase in the rotational speed is very slow so 
that the liquid in the container always acts as a rigid body.  2 Gasoline 
is an incompressible substance.  
Properties 
The density of the gasoline is given to be 740 kg/m3.

Discussion 
Note that the rotation of the tank does not affect the pressure difference along the axis of the tank. Likewise, 
the vertical acceleration does not affect the pressure difference between the edge and the center of the bottom surface (or 
any other horizontal plane).

Solution 
A rectangular water tank open to the atmosphere is accelerated to the right on a level surface at a specified 
rate. The maximum pressure in the tank above the atmospheric level is to be determined. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Assumptions 1 The road is horizontal during acceleration so that acceleration has no vertical component (az = 0). 2 
Effects of splashing, breaking and driving over bumps are assumed to be secondary, and are not considered.  3 The vent is 
never blocked, and thus the minimum pressure is the atmospheric pressure.  
Properties 
We take the density of water to be 1000 kg/m3.   
Analysis 
We take the x-axis to be the direction of motion, the z-axis to be the upward vertical direction. The tangent 
of the angle the free surface makes with the horizontal is

Solution 
A cylindrical container equipped with a manometer is inverted and pressed into water. The differential 
height of the manometer and the force needed to hold the container in place are to be determined. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Assumptions 1 Atmospheric pressure acts on all surfaces, and thus it can be ignored in calculations for convenience. 2 
The variation of air pressure inside cylinder is negligible.

Solution 
An iceberg floating in seawater is considered. The volume fraction of the iceberg submerged in seawater is 
to be determined, and the reason for their turnover is to be explained. 
Assumptions 1 The buoyancy force in air is negligible. 2 The density of iceberg and seawater are uniform.  
Properties 
The densities of iceberg and seawater are given to be 917 kg/m3 and 1042 kg/m3, respectively. 
Analysis 
(a) The weight of a body floating in a fluid is equal to the buoyant force acting on it (a consequence of 
vertical force balance from static equilibrium). Therefore,

Therefore, 88% of the volume of the iceberg is submerged in this case.   
(b) Heat transfer to the iceberg due to the temperature difference between the 
seawater and an iceberg causes uneven melting of the irregularly shaped iceberg. 
The resulting shift in the center of mass causes the iceberg to turn over.  
 
Discussion 
The submerged fraction depends on the density of seawater, and this fraction can differ in different seas.

Solution 
The density of a wood log is to be measured by tying lead weights to it until both the log and the weights are 
completely submerged, and then weighing them separately in air. The average density of a given log is to be determined by 
this approach. 
Properties 
The density of lead weights is given to be 11,300 kg/m3. We take the density of water to be 1000 kg/m3. 
Analysis 
The weight of a body is equal to the buoyant force when the body is floating in a fluid while being 
completely submerged in it (a consequence of vertical force balance from static equilibrium). In this case the average 
density of the body must be equal to the density of the fluid since

Note that the log must be completely submerged for this analysis to be valid. Ideally, the lead weights must

Solution 
A rectangular gate that leans against the floor with an angle of 45 with the horizontal is to be opened from 
its lower edge by applying a normal force at its center. The minimum force F required to open the water gate is to be 
determined. 
Assumptions 1 Atmospheric pressure acts on both sides of the gate, and thus it can be ignored in calculations for 
convenience. 2 Friction at the hinge is negligible. 
Properties 
We take the density of water to be 1000 kg/m3 throughout.

Solution 
We are to discuss how to measure the volume of a rock without using any volume measurement devices. 
Analysis 
The volume of a rock can be determined without using any volume measurement devices as follows: We 
weigh the rock in the air and then in the water. The difference between the two weights is due to the buoyancy force, which 
is equal to 
y

. Solving this relation for Vbody gives the volume of the rock.  
 
Discussion 
Since this is an open-ended design problem, students may come up with different, but equally valid 
techniques.

Solution 
The maximum total weight and mass of a razor blade floating on water along with additional weights on the 
razor blade is to be estimated. 
Assumptions 1 Surface tension acts only on the outer edges of the blade. 2 The blade is approximated as a rectangle for 
simplicity – three-dimensional corner effects are neglected. 3 In the limiting case, the water surface is vertical at the junction 
with the razor blade – as soon as the water starts to move over the razor blade surface, the razor blade would sink. 
Properties 
The surface tension of water at 20oC is 0.073 N/m, and its density is 998.0 kg/m3 
Analysis 
(a) 
Considering surface tension alone, the total upward force due to surface tension is the perimeter 
of the razor blade times the surface tension acting at contact angle . But here, the limiting case is when  = 180o. This must 
balance the weight W,

The values and properties are give to only two significant digits, so 
our final results are W = 0.0095 N and m = 0.97 g. 
(b) 
Since the razor blade pushes down on the water, the 
pressure at the bottom of the blade is larger than that at the top of 
the blade due to hydrostatic effects as sketched. Thus, more weight 
can be supported due to the difference in pressure. Since Pbelow =

Introductory Problems 
 
 
 
4-1C 
Solution 
We are to define and explain kinematics and fluid kinematics.  
 
Analysis 
Kinematics means the study of motion. Fluid kinematics is the study of how fluids flow and how to 
describe fluid motion. Fluid kinematics deals with describing the motion of fluids without considering (or even 
understanding) the forces and moments that cause the motion. 
 
Discussion 
Fluid kinematics deals with such things as describing how a fluid particle translates, distorts, and rotates, 
and how to visualize flow fields. 
 
 
 
 
 
4-2C 
Solution 
We are to discuss the difference between derivative operators d and . 
 
Analysis  
Derivative operator d is a total derivative, and implies that the dependent variable is a function of only 
one independent variable. On the other hand, derivative operator  is a partial derivative, and implies that the 
dependent variable is a function of more than one independent variable. When u/x appears in an equation, we 
immediately know that u is a function of x and at least one other independent variable. 
 
Discussion 
In our study of fluid mechanics, velocity is usually a function of more than one variable, although for some 
simple problems, we approximate it as a function of only one variable so that the problem can be solved analytically. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4-3 
Solution 
We are to write an equation for centerline speed through a nozzle, given that the flow speed increases 
parabolically.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The flow is axisymmetric. 3 The water is incompressible. 
 
Analysis 
A general equation for a parabola in the x direction is

We have two boundary conditions, namely at x = 0, u = uentrance and at x = L, u = uexit. By inspection, Eq. 1 is satisfied by 
setting c = 0, a = uentrance and b = (uexit - uentrance)/L2. Thus, Eq. 1 becomes

Solution 
For a given velocity field we are to find out if there is a stagnation point. If so, we are to calculate its 
location.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The flow is two-dimensional in the x-y plane.

At a stagnation point, both u and v must equal zero. At any point (x,y) in the flow field, the velocity components u and v are 
obtained from Eq. 1,

So, yes there is a stagnation point; its location is x = (b – a)/c, y = 0. 
 
Discussion 
If the flow were three-dimensional, we would have to set w = 0 as well to determine the location of the 
stagnation point. In some flow fields there is more than one stagnation point.

Lagrangian and Eulerian Descriptions 
 
 
 
4-7C 
Solution 
We are to define the Eulerian description of fluid motion, and explain how it differs from the Lagrangian 
description.  
 
Analysis 
In the Eulerian description of fluid motion, we are concerned with field variables, such as velocity, 
pressure, temperature, etc., as functions of space and time within a flow domain or control volume. In contrast to the 
Lagrangian method, fluid flows into and out of the Eulerian flow domain, and we do not keep track of the motion of 
particular identifiable fluid particles. 
 
Discussion 
The Eulerian method of studying fluid motion is not as “natural” as the Lagrangian method since the 
fundamental conservation laws apply to moving particles, not to fields. 
 
 
 
 
 
4-8C 
Solution 
We are to compare the Lagrangian method to the study of systems and control volumes and determine to 
which of these it is most similar.  
 
Analysis 
The Lagrangian method is more similar to system analysis (i.e., closed system analysis). In both cases, 
we follow a mass of fixed identity as it moves in a flow. In a control volume analysis, on the other hand, mass moves into 
and out of the control volume, and we don’t follow any particular chunk of fluid. Instead we analyze whatever fluid 
happens to be inside the control volume at the time. 
 
Discussion 
In fact, the Lagrangian analysis is the same as a system analysis in the limit as the size of the system shrinks 
to a point.

4-9C 
Solution 
We are to define the Lagrangian description of fluid motion.  
 
Analysis 
In the Lagrangian description of fluid motion, individual fluid particles (fluid elements composed of a 
fixed, identifiable mass of fluid) are followed. 
 
Discussion 
The Lagrangian method of studying fluid motion is similar to that of studying billiard balls and other solid 
objects in physics. 
 
 
 
 
 
4-10C 
Solution 
We are to determine whether a measurement is Lagrangian or Eulerian.  
 
Analysis 
Since the probe is fixed in space and the fluid flows around it, we are not following individual fluid 
particles as they move. Instead, we are measuring a field variable at a particular location in space. Thus this is an Eulerian 
measurement. 
 
Discussion 
If a neutrally buoyant probe were to move with the flow, its results would be Lagrangian measurements – 
following fluid particles. 
 
 
 
 
 
4-11C 
Solution 
We are to determine whether a measurement is Lagrangian or Eulerian.  
 
Analysis 
Since the probe moves with the flow and is neutrally buoyant, we are following individual fluid particles as 
they move through the pump. Thus this is a Lagrangian measurement. 
 
Discussion 
If the probe were instead fixed at one location in the flow, its results would be Eulerian measurements. 
 
 
 
 
 
4-12C 
Solution 
We are to define a steady flow field in the Eulerian description, and discuss particle acceleration in such a 
flow.  
 
Analysis 
A flow field is defined as steady in the Eulerian frame of reference when properties at any point in the 
flow field do not change with respect to time. In such a flow field, individual fluid particles may still experience non-zero 
acceleration – the answer to the question is yes. 
 
Discussion 
Although velocity is not a function of time in a steady flow field, its total derivative with respect to time 


/
a
dV dt



 is not necessarily zero since the acceleration is composed of a local (unsteady) part which is zero and an 
advective part which is not necessarily zero.

4-13C 
Solution 
We are to list three alternate names for material derivative.  
 
Analysis 
The material derivative is also called total derivative, particle derivative, Eulerian derivative, 
Lagrangian derivative, and substantial derivative. “Total” is appropriate because the material derivative includes both 
local (unsteady) and convective parts. “Particle” is appropriate because it stresses that the material derivative is one 
following fluid particles as they move about in the flow field. “Eulerian” is appropriate since the material derivative is used 
to transform from Lagrangian to Eulerian reference frames. “Lagrangian” is appropriate since the material derivative is 
used to transform from Lagrangian to Eulerian reference frames. Finally, “substantial” is not as clear of a term for the 
material derivative, and we are not sure of its origin. 
 
Discussion 
All of these names emphasize that we are following a fluid particle as it moves through a flow field. 
 
 
 
 
 
4-14C 
Solution 
We are to determine whether a measurement is Lagrangian or Eulerian.  
 
Analysis 
Since the weather balloon moves with the air and is neutrally buoyant, we are following individual “fluid 
particles” as they move through the atmosphere. Thus this is a Lagrangian measurement. Note that in this case the “fluid 
particle” is huge, and can follow gross features of the flow – the balloon obviously cannot follow small scale turbulent 
fluctuations in the atmosphere. 
 
Discussion 
When weather monitoring instruments are mounted on the roof of a building, the results are Eulerian 
measurements. 
 
 
 
 
 
4-15C 
Solution 
We are to determine whether a measurement is Lagrangian or Eulerian.  
 
Analysis 
Relative to the airplane, the probe is fixed and the air flows around it. We are not following individual fluid 
particles as they move. Instead, we are measuring a field variable at a particular location in space relative to the moving 
airplane. Thus this is an Eulerian measurement. 
 
Discussion 
The airplane is moving, but it is not moving with the flow. 
 
 
 
 
 
4-16C 
Solution 
We are to compare the Eulerian method to the study of systems and control volumes and determine to 
which of these it is most similar.  
 
Analysis 
The Eulerian method is more similar to control volume analysis. In both cases, mass moves into and out 
of the flow domain or control volume, and we don’t follow any particular chunk of fluid. Instead we analyze whatever fluid 
happens to be inside the control volume at the time. 
 
Discussion 
In fact, the Eulerian analysis is the same as a control volume analysis except that Eulerian analysis is 
usually applied to infinitesimal volumes and differential equations of fluid flow, whereas control volume analysis usually 
refers to finite volumes and integral equations of fluid flow.

Discussion 
ax is negative implying that fluid particles are decelerated along the centerline of the diffuser, even though 
the flow is steady. Because of the parabolic nature of the velocity field, the acceleration is zero at the entrance of the 
diffuser, but its magnitude increases rapidly downstream.

Flow Patterns and Flow Visualization 
 
 
 
 
4-26C 
Solution 
We are to define pathline and discuss what pathlines indicate.  
 
Analysis 
A pathline is the actual path traveled by an individual fluid particle over some time period. It indicates 
the exact route along which a fluid particle travels from its starting point to its ending point. Unlike streamlines, pathlines 
are not instantaneous, but involve a finite time period.  
 
Discussion 
If a flow field is steady, streamlines, pathlines, and streaklines are identical. 
 
 
 
 
4-27C 
Solution 
We are to determine what kind of flow visualization is seen in a photograph.  
 
Analysis 
Since the picture is a snapshot of dye streaks in water, each streak shows the time history of dye that was 
introduced earlier from a port in the body. Thus these are streaklines. Since the flow appears to be steady, these streaklines 
are the same as pathlines and streamlines. 
 
Discussion 
It is assumed that the dye follows the flow of the water. If the dye is of nearly the same density as the water, 
this is a reasonable assumption. 
 
 
 
 
4-28C 
Solution 
We are to define streamline and discuss what streamlines indicate.  
 
Analysis 
A streamline is a curve that is everywhere tangent to the instantaneous local velocity vector. It 
indicates the instantaneous direction of fluid motion throughout the flow field.  
 
Discussion 
If a flow field is steady, streamlines, pathlines, and streaklines are identical. 
 
 
 
 
 
4-29C 
Solution 
We are to define streakline and discuss the difference between streaklines and streamlines.  
 
Analysis 
A streakline is the locus of fluid particles that have passed sequentially through a prescribed point in 
the flow. Streaklines are very different than streamlines. Streamlines are instantaneous curves, everywhere tangent to the 
local velocity, while streaklines are produced over a finite time period. In an unsteady flow, streaklines distort and then 
retain features of that distorted shape even as the flow field changes, whereas streamlines change instantaneously with the 
flow field. 
 
Discussion 
If a flow field is steady, streamlines and streaklines are identical.

Solution

streaklines are not the same as pathlines or streamlines.

It is assumed that the dye follows the flow of the water. If the dye is of nearly the same density as the water, 
this is a reasonable assumption.

4-31C 
Solution 
We are to determine what kind of flow visualization is seen in a photograph.  
 
Analysis 
Since the picture is a snapshot of smoke streaks in air, each streak shows the time history of smoke that was 
introduced earlier from the smoke wire. Thus these are streaklines. Since the flow appears to be unsteady, these streaklines 
are not the same as pathlines or streamlines. 
 
Discussion 
It is assumed that the smoke follows the flow of the air. If the smoke is neutrally buoyant, this is a 
reasonable assumption. In actuality, the smoke rises a bit since it is hot; however, the air speeds are high enough that this 
effect is negligible. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4-32C 
Solution 
We are to determine what kind of flow visualization is seen in a photograph.  
 
Analysis 
Since the picture is a time exposure of air bubbles in water, each white streak shows the path of an 
individual air bubble. Thus these are pathlines. Since the outer flow (top and bottom portions of the photograph) appears to 
be steady, these pathlines are the same as streaklines and streamlines. 
 
Discussion 
It is assumed that the air bubbles follow the flow of the water. If the bubbles are small enough, this is a 
reasonable assumption. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4-33C 
Solution 
We are to define timeline and discuss how timelines can be produced in a water channel. We are also to 
describe an application where timelines are more useful than streaklines. 
 
Analysis 
A timeline is a set of adjacent fluid particles that were marked at the same instant of time. Timelines 
can be produced in a water flow by using a hydrogen bubble wire. There are also techniques in which a chemical reaction is 
initiated by applying current to the wire, changing the fluid color along the wire. Timelines are more useful than streaklines 
when the uniformity of a flow is to be visualized. Another application is to visualize the velocity profile of a boundary layer 
or a channel flow. 
 
Discussion 
Timelines differ from streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines even if the flow is steady. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4-34C 
Solution 
For each case we are to decide whether a vector plot or contour plot is most appropriate, and we are to 
explain our choice.  
 
Analysis 
In general, contour plots are most appropriate for scalars, while vector plots are necessary when vectors are 
to be visualized. 
(a) A contour plot of speed is most appropriate since fluid speed is a scalar. 
(b) A vector plot of velocity vectors would clearly show where the flow separates. Alternatively, a vorticity contour 
plot of vorticity normal to the plane would also show the separation region clearly. 
(c) A contour plot of temperature is most appropriate since temperature is a scalar. 
(d) A contour plot of this component of vorticity is most appropriate since one component of a vector is a scalar. 
 
Discussion 
There are other options for case (b) – temperature contours can also sometimes be used to identify a 
separation zone.

The new constant C is related to C1, and is introduced for simplicity. C 
can be set to various values in order to plot the streamlines. Several 
streamlines in the upper right quadrant of the given flow field are shown 
in Fig. 1. 
 
The direction of the flow is found by calculating u and v at some 
point in the flow field. We choose x = 3, y = 3. At this point u is positive 
and v is negative. The direction of the velocity at this point is obviously 
to the lower right. This sets the direction of all the streamlines. The 
arrows in Fig. 1 indicate the direction of flow. 
 
Discussion 
The flow appears to be a counterclockwise turning flow 
in the upper right quadrant.

Discussion 
Since the flow is a counterclockwise turning flow in the upper right quadrant, the acceleration vectors point 
to the upper right (centripetal acceleration).

Solution 
For the given velocity field, the location(s) of stagnation point(s) are to be determined. Several velocity 
vectors are to be sketched and the velocity field is to be described. 
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The flow is two-dimensional, implying no z-component of 
velocity and no variation of u or v with z.

(b) The x and y components of velocity are calculated from Eq. 1 for 
several (x,y) locations in the specified range. For example, at the point (x = 
2 m, y = 3 m), u = 9.00 m/s and v = -14.0 m/s. The magnitude of velocity 
(the speed) at that point is 16.64 m/s. At this and at an array of other 
locations, the velocity vector is constructed from its two components, the 
results of which are shown in Fig. 1. The flow can be described as a turning 
slightly counterclockwise, accelerating flow from the upper left to the 
lower right. The stagnation point of Part (a) does not lie in the upper right 
quadrant, and therefore does not appear on the sketch. 
 
Discussion 
The stagnation point location is given to three significant digits. It will be verified in Chap. 9 that this flow 
field is physically valid because it satisfies the differential equation for conservation of mass.

(b) The above equations are applied to an array of x and y values in the 
upper right quadrant, and the acceleration vectors are plotted in Fig. 1. 
 
Discussion 
The acceleration vectors plotted in Fig. 1 point to the upper 
right, increasing in magnitude away from the origin. This agrees 
qualitatively with the velocity vectors of Fig. 1 of the previous problem; 
namely, fluid particles are accelerated to the right and are turned in the 
counterclockwise direction due to centripetal acceleration towards the 
upper right. Note that the acceleration field is non-zero, even though the 
flow is steady.

Solution 
For a given velocity field we are to plot a velocity magnitude contour plot at five given values of speed.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The flow is two-dimensional in the r- plane.

the magnitude of the -component of velocity,

We plot a circle at this radius and repeat this simple calculation for the four 
other values of V. We plot the contours in Fig. 1. The speed increases 
linearly from the center of rotation (the origin). 
 
Discussion 
The contours are equidistant apart because of the linear nature of the velocity field.

Solution 
We are to generate an expression for the tangential velocity of a liquid confined between two concentric 
cylinders, and we are to estimate the torque exerted by the fluid on the cylinders. 
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is incompressible and two-dimensional, and thus the end effects (front and back of the cylinder) 
are negligible. 2 The flow has been running for a long time so that it is steady. 
 
Analysis  
Since both cylinders are rotating at the same rate, after a long enough time, the fluid will also rotate at the 
same rate. The entire system will behave as solid body rotation. So, the tangential velocity will be u = r, where  = I = 
o = constant. Thus, 
u
r



 
and u is not a function of any of the other variables. 
 
There is no shear stress on the walls since everything is rotating like a solid body. Thus, we expect that the torque on either 
cylinder wall is zero. 
 
Discussion 
The equation for u applies to both the solid cylinders and the fluid, since everything in the system is 
rotating as solid body rotation.

Solution 
We are to discuss the type of flow that is approximated by two concentric cylinders with the inner cylinder 
spinning very fast while its radius goes towards zero, while the outer cylinder is large (far away) and stationary. 
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is incompressible and two-dimensional, and thus the end effects (front and back of the cylinder) 
are negligible. 2 The flow has been running for a long time so that it is steady. 
 
Analysis  
Since the inner cylinder is rotating but the outer cylinder is not, after a long enough time, the fluid 
behaves like a line vortex, but with a missing core region. [This is good, actually, since the tangential velocity of a line 
vortex at the origin is infinite!] Thus, we expect 
constant
u
r

. Note that u is not a function of any of the fluid 
properties. We calculate the constant by specifying u at the inner cylinder surface, where u = iRi and r = Ri. The constant 
becomes iRi
2, and therefore 
2
i
iR
u
r



 
 
There is no shear stress on the walls since everything is rotating like a solid body. Thus, we expect that the torque on either 
cylinder wall is zero. 
 
Discussion 
The equation for u is valid in the fluid only, and we expect some error in our approximate analysis as the 
radius approaches the outer cylinder radius, which is not infinitely far away in a real-life situation.

From the solution to the previous problem, an equation

Constant C is set to various values in order to plot the streamlines. 
Several streamlines in the given range of x and y are plotted in Fig. 1. 
 
The direction of the flow is found by calculating u and v at 
some point in the flow field. We choose x = 1 ft, y = 1 ft. At this point u 
is positive and v is negative. The direction of the velocity at this point is 
obviously to the lower right. This sets the direction of all the 
streamlines. The arrows in Fig. 1 indicate the direction of flow. 
 
Discussion 
The flow is type of converging channel flow.

Motion and Deformation of Fluid Elements; Vorticity and Rotationality 
 
 
4-48C 
Solution 
We are to explain the relationship between vorticity and rotationality.  
 
Analysis 
Vorticity is a measure of the rotationality of a fluid particle. If a particle rotates, its vorticity is non-zero. 
Mathematically, the vorticity vector is twice the angular velocity vector. 
 
Discussion 
If the vorticity is zero, the flow is called irrotational. 
 
 
 
 
 
4-49C 
Solution 
We are to name and describe the four fundamental types of motion or deformation of fluid particles.  
 
Analysis 
 
1. Translation – a fluid particle moves from one location to another. 
2. Rotation – a fluid particle rotates about an axis drawn through the particle. 
3. Linear strain or extensional strain – a fluid particle stretches in a direction such that a line segment in that 
direction is elongated at some later time. 
4. Shear strain – a fluid particle distorts in such a way that two lines through the fluid particle that are initially 
perpendicular are not perpendicular at some later time. 
 
Discussion 
In a complex fluid flow, all four of these occur simultaneously. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4-50 
Solution 
For a given velocity field, we are to determine whether the flow is rotational or irrotational.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The flow is incompressible. 3 The flow is two-dimensional in the x-y plane.

By definition, the flow is rotational if the vorticity is non-zero. So, we calculate the vorticity. In a 2-D flow in the x-y plane, 
the only non-zero component of vorticity is in the z direction, i.e. z,

Since the vorticity is zero, this flow is irrotational. 
 
Discussion 
We shall see in Chap. 10 that the fluid very close to the walls is rotational due to important viscous effects 
near the wall (a boundary layer). However, in the majority of the flow field, the irrotational approximation is reasonable.

movement is irrelevant (u and v act independently of each other).

The only non-zero component of vorticity is in the z (or –z) direction. 
 
Discussion 
For any two-dimensional flow in the x-y plane, the vorticity vector must point in the z (or –z) direction. The 
sign of the z-component of vorticity in Eq. 1 obviously depends on the sign of a2 – b1.

Solution 
We are to verify that the given flow field is incompressible using two different methods.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The flow is two-dimensional. 
 
Analysis 
(a) 
The volume of the fluid particle at time t is. 
Volume at time t: 
t
dxdydz

V
 
(1) 
where dz is the length of the fluid particle in the z direction. At time t + dt, we assume that the fluid particle’s dimension dz 
remains fixed since the flow is two-dimensional. Thus its volume is dz times the area of the rhombus shown in Fig. P4-58, 
as illustrated in Fig. 1, 
Volume at time t + dt: 


t
dt
dxdydz


V
 
(2) 
Since Eqs. 1 and 2 are equal, the volume of the fluid particle has not 
changed, and the flow is therefore incompressible. 
 
(b) 
We use the equation for volumetric strain rate in Cartesian 
coordinates, and apply the results of the previous problem,

Where zz = 0 since the flow is two-dimensional. Since the volumetric 
strain rate is zero everywhere, the flow is incompressible.

remain constant.

From the fundamental definition of shear strain rate in the x-y plane, we

intersect at 90o at the lower left corner at time t. We define angle  between 
the lower edge and the left edge of the fluid particle, and angle , the 
complement of  (Fig. 1). The rate of decrease of angle  over time 
interval dt is obtained from application of trigonometry. First, we calculate 
angle ,

From the fundamental definition of rate of rotation in the x-y plane, we 
consider the bottom edge and the left edge of the fluid particle, which 
intersect at 90o at the lower left corner at time t. We define angle  in Fig. 
1, where  is the negative of the angle of rotation of the left edge of the 
fluid particle (negative because rotation is mathematically positive in the 
counterclockwise direction). We calculate angle  using trigonometry,

that intersect at the point. In this particular problem, Line a (PA) and Line b (PB) are initially perpendicular, and intersect at 
point P. Line a rotates by angle a, and Line b rotates by angle b, Thus, the average angle of rotation is

The first approximation in Eq. 6 is due to the fact that as the size of the fluid element shrinks to a point, dx  0, and at the 
same time dt  0. Thus, the second term in the denominator is second-order compared to the first-order term dx and can be 
neglected. The second approximation in Eq. 6 is because as dt  0 angle a is very small, and tana  a. Similarly, angle 
b is written in terms of velocity components as

By definition, the rate of linear strain is the rate of increase in length of a 
line segment in a given direction divided by the original length of the line 
segment in that direction. During time increment dt, point P moves a 
distance udt to the right and vdt up (to first order, assuming dt is very 
small). Similarly, point A moves a distance

By definition, the shear strain rate at a point is half of the rate of decrease 
of the angle between two initially perpendicular lines that intersect at the 
point. In Fig. P4-63, Line a (PA) and Line b (PB) are initially 
perpendicular, and intersect at point P. Line a rotates by angle a, and 
Line b rotates by angle b. The angle between these two lines changes 
from /2 at time t1 to a-b at time t2 as sketched in Fig. 1. The shear strain 
rate at point P for initially perpendicular lines in the x and y directions is

The first approximation in Eq. 6 is due to the fact that as the size of the fluid element shrinks to a point, dx  0, and at the 
same time dt  0. Thus, the second term in the denominator is second-order compared to the first-order term dx and can be 
neglected. The second approximation in Eq. 6 is because as dt  0 angle a is very small, and tana  a. Similarly,

Solution 
For a given linear strain rate in the x-direction, we are to calculate the linear strain rate in the y-direction.

fluid element must shrink in the y-direction, yielding a value of yy that is negative.

Solution 
For a given deformation of a fluid particle in one direction, we are to calculate its deformation in the other 
direction.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is incompressible. 2 The flow is two-dimensional in the x-y plane. 
 
Analysis 
Since the flow is incompressible and two-dimensional, the area of the fluid element must remain constant 
(volumetric strain rate must be zero in an incompressible flow). The area of the original fluid particle is a2. Hence, the 
vertical dimension of the fluid particle at the later time must be a2/2a = a/2. 
 
Discussion 
Since the particle stretches by a factor of two in the x-direction, it shrinks by a factor of two in the y-
direction.

Solution 
We are to calculate the percentage change in fluid density for a fluid particle undergoing two-dimensional 
deformation.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is two-dimensional in the x-y plane. 
 
Analysis 
The area of the original fluid particle is a2. Assuming that the mass of the fluid particle is m and its 
dimension in the z-direction is also a, the initial density is  = m/V = m/a3. As the particle moves and deforms, its mass 
must remain constant. If its dimension in the z-direction remains equal to a, the density at the later time is

Solution 
For the Couette flow velocity field we are to form the 2-D strain rate tensor and determine if the x and y 
axes are principal axes.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The flow is incompressible. 3 The flow is two-dimensional in the x-y plane.

Discussion 
The principal axes can be calculated using tensor algebra.

Solution 
For a given velocity field and an initially square fluid particle, we are to calculate and plot its location and 
shape after a given time period.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The flow is two-dimensional in the 
x-y plane. 
 
Analysis 
Using the results of Problems 4-51 and 4-54, we can 
calculate the location of any point on the fluid particle after the elapsed 
time. We pick 6 points along each edge of the fluid particle, and plot their x 
and y locations at t = 0 and at t = 0.2 s. For example, the point at the lower 
left corner of the particle is initially at x = 0.25 ft and y = 0.75 ft at t = 0. At 
t = 0.2 s,  
x-location of lower left corner of the fluid particle at time t = 0.2 s:

We repeat the above calculations at all the points along the edges of the 
fluid particle, and plot both their initial and final positions in Fig. 1 as dots. 
Finally, we connect the dots to draw the fluid particle shape.  It is clear 
from the results that the fluid particle shrinks in the y direction and 
stretches in the x direction. However, it does not shear or rotate. 
 
Discussion 
The flow is irrotational since fluid particles do not rotate.

Solution 
By analyzing the shape of a fluid particle, we are to verify that the given flow field is incompressible.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The flow is two-dimensional in the x-y plane. 
 
Analysis 
Since the flow is two-dimensional, we assume unit depth (1 ft) in the z direction (into the page in the 
figure). In the previous problem, we calculated the initial and final locations of several points on the perimeter of an 
initially square fluid particle. At t = 0, the particle volume is 
Fluid particle volume at t = 0 s:





0.50 ft
0.50 ft 1.0 ft

V
 
(1) 
At t = 0.2 s, the lower left corner of the fluid particle has moved to x = 2.2679 ft, y = 0.29889 ft, and the upper right corner 
has moved to x = 3.5225 ft, y = 0.49815 ft. Since the fluid particle remains rectangular, we can calculate the fluid particle 
volume from these two corner locations, 
Fluid particle volume at t = 0.2 s:
 





3.5225 ft

0.49815 ft
0.29889 ft 1.0 ft
0.2500 ft




V
 
(2) 
Thus, to at least four significant digits, the fluid particle volume has not changed, and the flow is therefore 
incompressible. 
 
Discussion 
The fluid particle stretches in the horizontal direction and shrinks in the vertical direction, but the net 
volume of the fluid particle does not change.

Reynolds Transport Theorem 
 
 
 
4-88C 
Solution 
We are to explain the similarities and differences between the material derivative and the RTT.  
 
Analysis 
The main similarity is that both of them transform from a Lagrangian or system viewpoint to an 
Eulerian or control volume viewpoint. Other similarities include that both the material derivative and the RTT contain 
two terms on the right side – an unsteady term that is nonzero only when the flow is changing in time, and an advective 
part, which accounts for the fluid particle or system moving to a new part of the flow field. The main difference between 
the two is that the material derivative applies to infinitesimal fluid particles, while the RTT applies to finite systems and 
control volumes. 
 
Discussion 
It turns out that if we let the system shrink to a point, the RTT reduces directly to the material derivative. 
 
 
 
 
 
4-89C 
Solution 
We are to explain the purpose of the Reynolds transport theorem, and write the RTT for intensive property 
b as a “word equation.”  
 
Analysis 
The purpose of the RTT is to convert conservation equations from their fundamental form for a system 
(closed system) to a form that can be applied to a control volume (open system). In other words, the RTT provides a 
link between the system approach and the control volume approach to a fluid flow problem. We can also explain the 
RTT as a transformation from the Lagrangian to the Eulerian frame of reference. The RTT (Eq. 4-41) is

(1) 
In word form, Eq. 1 may be stated something like this: The time rate of change of property B of the system is equal to 
the time rate of change of B of the control volume due to unsteadiness plus the net flux of B across the control 
surface due to fluid flow.  
 
Discussion 
Students should write the RTT in their own words. 
 
 
 
 
 
4-90C 
Solution 
  
(a) False: The statement is backwards, since the conservation laws are naturally occurring in the system form. 
(b) False: The RTT can be applied to any control volume, fixed, moving, or deforming. 
(c) True: The RTT has an unsteady term and can be applied to unsteady problems. 
(d) True: The extensive property B (or its intensive form b) in the RTT can be any property of the fluid – scalar, vector, or 
even tensor.

theorem is in situations where this cannot be done.

Solution 
We are to determine if the flow is rotational, and if so calculate the z-component of vorticity.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The flow is incompressible. 3 The flow is two-dimensional in the x-y plane.

Since vorticity is non-zero, this flow is rotational. Furthermore, in the lower half of the flow (y < h/2) the vorticity is 
negative (note that dP/dx is negative). Thus, particles rotate in the clockwise direction in the lower half of the flow. 
Similarly, particles rotate in the counterclockwise direction in the upper half of the flow. 
 
Discussion 
The vorticity varies linearly across the channel.

Solution 
For the given velocity field for 2-D Poiseuille flow, we are to calculate the two-dimensional linear strain 
rates and the shear strain rate.

Since the linear strain rates are zero, fluid particles deform (shear), but do not stretch in either the horizontal 
or vertical directions.

Solution 
For the 2-D Poiseuille flow velocity field we are to form the 2-D strain rate tensor and determine if the x 
and y axes are principal axes.

Note that by symmetry yx = xy. If the x and y axes were principal axes, the diagonals of ij would be non-zero, and the off-
diagonals would be zero. Here we have the opposite case, so the x and y axes are not principal axes. 
 
Discussion 
The principal axes can be calculated using tensor algebra.

Solution 
For a given velocity field we are to plot several pathlines 
for fluid particles released from various locations and over a specified time 
period.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The flow is incompressible. 3 The 
flow is two-dimensional in the x-y plane. 
 
Properties 
For water at 40oC,  = 6.5310-4 kg/ms. 
 
Analysis 
Since the flow is steady, pathlines, streamlines, and 
streaklines are all straight horizontal lines. We simply need to integrate 
velocity component u with respect to time over the specified time period.

to the pathlines of Fig. 1.

Solution 
For a given velocity field we are to plot several streaklines at a given time for dye released from various 
locations over a specified time period.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The flow is incompressible. 3 The flow is two-dimensional in the x-y plane. 
 
Properties 
For water at 40oC,  = 6.5310-4 kg/ms. 
 
Analysis 
Since the flow is steady, pathlines, streamlines, and 
streaklines are all straight horizontal lines. We simply need to integrate 
velocity component u with respect to time over the specified time period.

We substitute the given values of y and the values of  and dP/dx into Eq. 
2 to calculate the ending x position of the first released dye particle of each 
streakline. The last released dye particle is at x = xstart = 0, because it hasn’t 
had a chance to go anywhere. We connect the beginning and ending points 
to plot the streaklines (Fig. 1). 
 
Discussion 
These streaklines are introduced at the same locations and 
are developed over the same time period as the pathlines of the previous problem. They are identical since the flow is 
steady.

In the previous problem we generated streaklines at t = 10 s. Imagine the 
dye at the source being suddenly cut off at that time, but the streaklines are 
observed 2 seconds later, at t = 12 s. The dye streaks will not stretch any 
further, but will simply move at the same horizontal speed for 2 more 
seconds. At each y location, the x locations of the first and last dye particle 
are thus 
first dye particle of streakline:

We substitute the given values of y and the values of  and dP/dx into Eqs. 2 and 3 to calculate the ending and beginning x 
positions of the first released dye particle and the last released dye particle of each streakline. We connect the beginning 
and ending points to plot the streaklines (Fig. 1). 
 
Discussion 
Both the left and right ends of each dye streak have moved by the same amount compared to those of the 
previous problem.

Solution 
For a given velocity field we are to compare streaklines at two different times and comment about linear 
strain rate in the x direction.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The flow is incompressible. 3 The flow is two-dimensional in the x-y plane. 
 
Properties 
For water at 40oC,  = 6.5310-4 kg/ms. 
 
Analysis 
Comparing the results of the previous two problems we see that the streaklines have not stretched at all – 
they have simply convected downstream. Thus, based on the fundamental definition of linear strain rate, it is zero: 
Linear strain rate in the x direction:

Solution 
For a given velocity field we are to plot several timelines 
at a specified time. The timelines are created by hydrogen bubbles 
released from a vertical wire at x = 0. 
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The flow is incompressible. 3 The 
flow is two-dimensional in the x-y plane. 
 
Properties 
For water at 40oC,  = 6.5310-4 kg/ms. 
 
Analysis 
Since the flow is steady, pathlines, streamlines, and 
streaklines are all straight horizontal lines, but timelines are completely 
different from any of the others. To simulate a timeline, we integrate 
velocity component u with respect to time over the specified time period 
from t = 0 to t = tend. We introduce the bubbles at x = 0 and at many values 
of y (we used 50 in our simulation). By connecting these x locations with 
a line, we simulate a timeline. The horizontal velocity component is 
x-velocity component:

Each timeline has the exact shape of the velocity profile.

Solution 
We are to determine if the flow is rotational, and if so calculate the -component of vorticity.

Since the vorticity is non-zero, this flow is rotational. The vorticity is positive since dP/dx is negative. In this coordinate 
system, positive vorticity is counterclockwise with respect to the positive  direction. This agrees with our intuition since in 
the top half of the flow,  points out of the page, and the rotation is counterclockwise. Similarly, in the bottom half of the 
flow,  points into the page, and the rotation is clockwise. 
 
Discussion 
The vorticity varies linearly across the pipe from zero at the centerline to a maximum at the pipe wall.

Solution 
For the given velocity field for axisymmetric Poiseuille flow, we are to calculate the linear strain rates and 
the shear strain rate.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The flow is incompressible. 3 The flow is axisymmetric about the x axis.

or radial directions.

Solution 
For the axisymmetric Poiseuille flow velocity field we are to form the axisymmetric strain rate tensor and 
determine if the x and r axes are principal axes.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The flow is incompressible. 3 The flow is axisymmetric about the x axis.

Note that by symmetry rx = xr. If the x and r axes were principal axes, the diagonals of ij would be non-zero, and the off-
diagonals would be zero. Here we have the opposite case, so the x and r axes are not principal axes. 
 
Discussion 
The principal axes can be calculated using tensor algebra.

Both u and v must be zero at a stagnation point. From Eq. 1, u can be zero only when x = 0. From Eq. 2, v can be zero either 
when y = 0 or when x2 + y2 –b2 = 0. Combining the former with the result from Eq. 1, we see that there is a stagnation 
point at (x,y) = (0,0), i.e. at the origin,

Combining the latter with the result from Eq. 1, there appears to be another stagnation point at (x,y) = (0,b). However, at

This point turns out to be a singularity point in the flow. Thus, the location (0,b) is not a stagnation point after all. 
 
Discussion 
There is only one stagnation point in this flow, and it is at the origin.

Solution 
We are to draw a velocity vector plot for a given velocity field.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The flow is two-dimensional in the x-y plane. 
 
Analysis 
We generate an array of x and y values in the given range and calculate u and v from Eqs. 1 and 2 
respectively at each location. We choose an appropriate scale factor for the vectors and then draw arrows to form the 
velocity vector plot (Fig. 1).

It is clear from the velocity vector plot how the air gets sucked into the vacuum cleaner from all directions. We also see that 
there is no flow through the floor.  
 
Discussion 
We discuss this problem in more detail in Chap. 10. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4-114 
Solution 
We are to calculate the speed of air along the floor due to a vacuum cleaner, and find the location of 
maximum speed.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The flow is two-dimensional in the x-y plane. 
 
Analysis 
At the floor, y = 0. Setting y = 0 in Eq. 2 of Problem 4-93 shows that v = 0, as expected – no flow through 
the floor. Setting y = 0 in Eq. 1 of Problem 4-93 results in the speed along the floor,

After some algebraic manipulation, we find that Eq. 2 has solutions at x = b and x = -b. It is at x = b and x = -b where we 
expect the best performance. At the origin, directly below the vacuum cleaner inlet, the flow is stagnant. Thus, despite our 
intuition, the vacuum cleaner will work poorly directly below the inlet. 
 
Discussion 
Try some experiments at home to verify these results!

Hence, since the vorticity is everywhere zero, this flow is irrotational. 
 
Discussion 
Fluid particles distort as they flow around the cylinder, but their net rotation is zero.

Solution 
For a given velocity field we are to find the location of the stagnation point.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The flow is two-dimensional in the r- plane.

The second part of the u condition in Eq. 1 is obviously impossible since 
cylinder radius a is a real number. Thus sin = 0, which means that  = 0o 
or 180o. We are restricted to the left half of the flow (x < 0); therefore we 
choose  = 180o. Now we look at the ur condition in Eq. 1. At  = 180o, cos = -1, and thus we conclude that r must equal 
a. Summarizing,

Solution 
We are to discuss whether the flow field of the previous problem is incompressible or compressible.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The flow is two-dimensional in the r- plane. 
 
Analysis 
For two-dimensional flow we know that a flow is incompressible if its volumetric strain rate is zero. In that 
case,

Conservation of Mass 
 
 
 
5-1C  
Solution 
We are to name some conserved and non-conserved quantities.  
 
Analysis 
Mass, energy, momentum, and electric charge are conserved, and volume and entropy are not 
conserved during a process. 
 
Discussion 
Students may think of other answers that may be equally valid. 
 
 
 
 
 
5-2C  
Solution 
We are to discuss mass and volume flow rates and their relationship.  
 
Analysis 
Mass flow rate is the amount of mass flowing through a cross-section per unit time whereas volume flow 
rate is the amount of volume flowing through a cross-section per unit time. 
 
Discussion 
Mass flow rate has dimensions of mass/time while volume flow rate has dimensions of volume/time. 
 
 
 
 
 
5-3C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the mass flow rate entering and leaving a control volume.  
 
Analysis 
The amount of mass or energy entering a control volume does not have to be equal to the amount of mass 
or energy leaving during an unsteady-flow process. 
 
Discussion 
If the process is steady, however, the two mass flow rates must be equal; otherwise the amount of mass 
would have to increase or decrease inside the control volume, which would make it unsteady. 
 
 
 
 
 
5-4C  
Solution 
We are to discuss steady flow through a control volume.  
 
Analysis 
Flow through a control volume is steady when it involves no changes with time at any specified position. 
 
Discussion 
This applies to any variable we might consider – pressure, velocity, density, temperature, etc.

5-3 
5-5C  
Solution 
We are to discuss whether the flow is steady through a given control volume.  
 
Analysis 
No, a flow with the same volume flow rate at the inlet and the exit is not necessarily steady (even if the 
density is constant – see Discussion). To be steady, the mass flow rate through the device must remain constant in time, 
and no variables can change with time at any specified spatial position. 
 
Discussion 
If the question had stated that the two mass flow rates were equal, then the answer would still be not 
necessarily. As a counter-example, consider the steadily increasing flow of an incompressible liquid through the device. At 
any instant in time, the mass flow rate in must equal the mass flow rate out since there is nowhere else for the liquid to go. 
However, the mass flow rate itself is changing with time, and hence the problem is unsteady. Can you think of another 
counter-example?

Solution 
A rigid tank initially contains air at atmospheric conditions. The tank is connected to a supply line, and air 
is allowed to enter the tank until the density rises to a specified level. The mass of air that entered the tank is to be 
determined. 
Properties 
The density of air is given to be 1.18 kg/m3 at the beginning, and 4.95 kg/m3 at the end.    
Analysis 
We take the tank as the system, which is a control volume since mass crosses the boundary.  The mass 
balance for this system can be expressed as

Solution 
Air is expanded and is accelerated as it is heated by a hair dryer of constant diameter. The percent increase 
in the velocity of air as it flows through the drier is to be determined. 
Assumptions Flow through the nozzle is steady. 
Properties 
The density of air is given to be 1.20 kg/m3 at the inlet, and 1.05 kg/m3 at the exit.

Solution 
We are to define and discuss mechanical efficiency.  
 
Analysis 
Mechanical efficiency is defined as the ratio of the mechanical energy output to the mechanical energy 
input. A mechanical efficiency of 100% for a hydraulic turbine means that the entire mechanical energy of the fluid is 
converted to mechanical (shaft) work. 
 
Discussion 
No real fluid machine is 100% efficient, due to frictional losses, etc. – the second law of thermodynamics.

The combined pump-motor efficiency cannot be greater than either of the pump or motor efficiency since both pump and 
motor efficiencies are less than 1, and the product of two numbers that are less than one is less than either of the numbers. 
 
Discussion 
Since many pumps are supplied with an integrated motor, pump-motor efficiency is a useful parameter.

Solution 
We are to discuss mechanical energy and how it differs from thermal energy.  
 
Analysis 
Mechanical energy is the form of energy that can be converted to mechanical work completely and 
directly by a mechanical device such as a propeller. It differs from thermal energy in that thermal energy cannot be 
converted to work directly and completely. The forms of mechanical energy of a fluid stream are kinetic, potential, and 
flow energies. 
 
Discussion 
It would be nice if we could convert thermal energy completely into work. However, this would violate the 
second law of thermodynamics.

Solution 
Wind is blowing steadily at a certain velocity. The mechanical energy of air per unit mass, the power 
generation potential, and the actual electric power generation are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The wind is blowing steadily at a constant uniform velocity. 2 The efficiency of the wind turbine is 
independent of the wind speed.   
Properties  
The density of air is given to be  = 1.25 kg/m3. 
Analysis 
Kinetic energy is the only form of mechanical energy the wind possesses, and it can be converted to work 
entirely. Therefore, the power potential of the wind is its kinetic energy, which is V2/2 per unit mass, and

power generation as the velocity varies from 5 m/s to 20 m/s in increments of 5 m/s, and the diameter varies from 20 m to

Solution 
A differential thermocouple indicates that the temperature of water rises a certain amount as it flows 
through a pump at a specified rate. The mechanical efficiency of the pump is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The pump is adiabatic so that there is no heat transfer with the surroundings, and the temperature rise of 
water is completely due to frictional heating. 2 Water is an incompressible substance.   
Properties 
We take the density of water to be  = 62.4 lbm/ft3 and its specific heat to be c = 1.0 Btu/lbmF. 
Analysis 
The increase in the temperature of water is due to the conversion of mechanical energy to thermal energy, 
and the amount of mechanical energy converted to thermal energy is equal to the increase in the internal energy of water,

Discussion 
Note that despite the conversion of more than one-third of the mechanical power input into thermal energy,

Solution 
A hydraulic turbine-generator is generating electricity from the water of a large reservoir. The combined 
turbine-generator efficiency and the turbine efficiency are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The elevation of the reservoir remains constant. 2 The mechanical energy of water at the turbine exit is 
negligible.   
Analysis 
We take the free surface of the reservoir to be point 1 and the turbine exit to be point 2. We also take the 
turbine exit as the reference level (z2 = 0), and thus the potential energy at points 1 and 2 are pe1 = gz1 and pe2 = 0. The flow 
energy P/ at both points is zero since both 1 and 2 are open to the atmosphere (P1 = P2 = Patm). Further, the kinetic energy 
at both points is zero (ke1 = ke2 = 0) since the water at point 1 is essentially motionless, and the kinetic energy of water at 
turbine exit is assumed to be negligible. The potential energy of water at point 1 is

Therefore, the reservoir supplies 971.2 kW of mechanical energy to the turbine, which converts 800 kW of it to shaft work 
that drives the generator, which generates 750 kW of electric power. 
Discussion 
This problem can also be solved by taking point 1 to be at the turbine inlet, and using flow energy instead of 
potential energy. It would give the same result since the flow energy at the turbine inlet is equal to the potential energy at 
the free surface of the reservoir.

Solution 
A river is flowing at a specified velocity, flow rate, and elevation. The total mechanical energy of the river 
water per unit mass, and the power generation potential of the entire river are to be determined.  
 
Assumptions 1 The elevation given is the elevation of the free surface of the river. 2 The velocity given is the average 
velocity. 3 The mechanical energy of water at the turbine exit is negligible.   
Properties  
We take the density of water to be  = 1000 kg/m3. 
Analysis 
Noting that the sum of the flow energy and the potential energy is constant for a given fluid body, we can 
take the elevation of the entire river water to be the elevation of the free surface, and ignore the flow energy. Then the total 
mechanical energy of the river water per unit mass becomes

Therefore, 347 MW of power can be generated from this river as it discharges into the lake if its power potential can be

Discussion 
Note that the kinetic energy of water is negligible compared to the potential energy, and it can be ignored in 
the analysis. Also, the power output of an actual turbine will be less than 347 MW because of losses and inefficiencies.

Solution 
Water is pumped from a lake to a storage tank at a specified rate. The overall efficiency of the pump-motor 
unit and the pressure difference between the inlet and the exit of the pump are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The elevations of the tank and the lake remain constant. 2 Frictional losses in the pipes are negligible. 3 
The changes in kinetic energy are negligible. 4 The elevation difference across the pump is negligible.   
Properties 
We take the density of water to be  = 1000 kg/m3. 
Analysis 
(a) We take the free surface of the lake to be point 1 and the free surfaces of the storage tank to be point 2. 
We also take the lake surface as the reference level (z1 = 0), and thus the potential energy at points 1 and 2 are pe1 = 0 and  
pe2 = gz2. The flow energy at both points is zero since both 1 and 2 are open to the atmosphere (P1 = P2 = Patm). Further, the 
kinetic energy at both points is zero (ke1 = ke2 = 0) since the water at both locations is essentially stationary. The mass flow

Therefore, the pump must boost the pressure of water by 177 kPa in 
order to raise its elevation by 18 m.   
Discussion 
Note that only two-thirds of the electric energy consumed by the pump-motor is converted to the 
mechanical energy of water; the remaining one-third is wasted because of the inefficiencies of the pump and the motor.

Bernoulli Equation

Solution 
We are to define stagnation pressure  and discuss how it can be measured.

. The stagnation pressure can be measured by a Pitot tube whose inlet is normal to the flow. 
 
Discussion 
Stagnation pressure, as its name implies, is the pressure obtained when a flowing fluid is brought to rest 
isentropically, at a so-called stagnation point.

5-30C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the three major assumptions used in the derivation of the Bernoulli equation.  
 
Analysis 
The three major assumptions used in the derivation of the Bernoulli equation are that the flow is steady, 
there is negligible frictional effects, and the flow is incompressible. 
 
Discussion 
If any one of these assumptions is not valid, the Bernoulli equation should not be used. Unfortunately, many 
people use it anyway, leading to errors.

5-19
5-31C  
Solution 
We are to define and discuss static, dynamic, and hydrostatic pressure.  
 
Analysis 
Static pressure P is the actual pressure of the fluid. Dynamic pressure V 2/2 is the pressure rise when 
the fluid in motion is brought to a stop isentropically. Hydrostatic pressure gz is not pressure in a real sense since its 
value depends on the reference level selected, and it accounts for the effects of fluid weight on pressure. The sum of 
static, dynamic, and hydrostatic pressures is constant when flow is steady and incompressible, and when frictional effects 
are negligible. 
 
Discussion 
The incompressible Bernoulli equation states that the sum of these three pressures is constant along a 
streamline; this approximation is valid only for steady and incompressible flow with negligible frictional effects. 
 
 
 
 
5-32C  
Solution 
We are to define streamwise acceleration and discuss how it differs from normal acceleration.  
 
Analysis 
The acceleration of a fluid particle along a streamline is called streamwise acceleration, and it is due to a 
change in speed along a streamline. Normal acceleration (or centrifugal acceleration), on the other hand, is the 
acceleration of a fluid particle in the direction normal to the streamline, and it is due to a change in direction. 
 
Discussion 
In a general fluid flow problem, both streamwise and normal acceleration are present. 
 
 
 
 
5-33C  
Solution 
We are to define and discuss pressure head, velocity head, and elevation head.  
 
Analysis 
The pressure head P/g is the height of a fluid column that produces the static pressure P. The velocity 
head V 2/2 is the elevation needed for a fluid to reach the velocity V during frictionless free fall. The elevation head z is 
the height of a fluid relative to a reference level.  
 
Discussion 
It is often convenient in fluid mechanics to work with head – pressure expressed as an equivalent column 
height of fluid.

5-20
5-34C  
Solution 
We are to explain how and why a siphon works, and its limitations.  
 
Analysis 
Siphoning works because of the elevation and thus pressure difference between the inlet and exit of a tube. 
The pressure at the tube exit and at the free surface of a liquid is the atmospheric pressure. When the tube exit is below the 
free surface of the liquid, the elevation head difference drives the flow through the tube. At sea level, 1 atm pressure can 
support about 10.3 m of cold water (cold water has a low vapor pressure).  Therefore, siphoning cold water over a 7 m wall 
is theoretically feasible. 
 
Discussion 
In actual practice, siphoning is also limited by frictional effects in the tube, and by cavitation. 
 
 
 
 
 
5-35C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the hydraulic grade line in open-channel flow and at the outlet of a pipe.  
 
Analysis 
For open-channel flow, the hydraulic grade line (HGL) coincides with the free surface of the liquid. At 
the exit of a pipe discharging to the atmosphere, HGL coincides with the elevation of the pipe outlet. 
 
Discussion 
We are assuming incompressible flow, and the pressure at the pipe outlet is atmospheric. 
 
 
 
 
 
5-36C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the effect of liquid density on the operation of a siphon.  
 
Analysis 
The lower density liquid can go over a higher wall, provided that cavitation pressure is not reached. 
Therefore, oil may be able to go over a higher wall than water. 
 
Discussion 
However, frictional losses in the flow of oil in a pipe or tube are much greater than those of water since the 
viscosity of oil is much greater than that of water. When frictional losses are considered, the water may actually be able to 
be siphoned over a higher wall than the oil, depending on the tube diameter and length, etc. 
 
 
 
 
5-37C  
Solution 
We are to define hydraulic grade line and compare it to energy grade line.  
 
Analysis 
The curve that represents the sum of the static pressure and the elevation heads, P/g + z, is called the 
hydraulic grade line or HGL. The curve that represents the total head of the fluid, P/g + V 2/2g + z, is called the energy 
line or EGL. Thus, in comparison, the energy grade line contains an extra kinetic-energy-type term. For stationary bodies 
such as reservoirs or lakes, the EL and HGL coincide with the free surface of the liquid. 
Discussion 
The hydraulic grade line can rise or fall along flow in a pipe or duct as the cross-sectional area increases or 
decreases, whereas the energy grade line always decreases unless energy is added to the fluid (like with a pump).

5-21
5-38C  
Solution 
We are to discuss and compare the operation of a manometer.  
 
Analysis 
As the duct converges to a smaller cross-sectional area, the velocity increases. By Bernoulli’s equation, the 
pressure therefore decreases. Thus Manometer A is correct since the pressure on the right side of the manometer is 
obviously smaller. According to the Bernoulli approximation, the fluid levels in the manometer are independent of the flow 
direction, and reversing the flow direction would have no effect on the manometer levels. Manometer A is still correct if 
the flow is reversed. 
 
Discussion 
In reality, it is hard for a fluid to expand without the flow separating from the walls. Thus, reverse flow with 
such a sharp expansion would not produce as much of a pressure rise as that predicted by the Bernoulli approximation. 
 
 
 
 
 
5-39C  
Solution 
We are to discuss and compare two different types of manometer arrangements in a flow.  
 
Analysis 
Arrangement 1 consists of a Pitot probe that measures the stagnation pressure at the pipe centerline, along 
with a static pressure tap that measures static pressure at the bottom of the pipe. Arrangement 2 is a Pitot-static probe that 
measures both stagnation pressure and static pressure at nearly the same location at the pipe centerline. Because of this, 
arrangement 2 is more accurate. However, it turns out that static pressure in a pipe varies with elevation across the pipe 
cross section in much the same way as in hydrostatics. Therefore, arrangement 1 is also very accurate, and the elevation 
difference between the Pitot probe and the static pressure tap is nearly compensated by the change in hydrostatic pressure. 
Since elevation changes are not important in either arrangement, there is no change in our analysis when the water is 
replaced by air. 
 
Discussion 
Ignoring the effects of gravity, the pressure at the centerline of a turbulent pipe flow is actually somewhat 
smaller than that at the wall due to the turbulent eddies in the flow, but this effect is small. 
 
 
 
 
 
5-40C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the maximum rise of a jet of water from a tank.  
 
Analysis 
With no losses and a 100% efficient nozzle, the water stream could reach to the water level in the tank, or 
20 meters. In reality, friction losses in the hose, nozzle inefficiencies, orifice losses, and air drag would prevent attainment 
of the maximum theoretical height. 
 
Discussion 
In fact, the actual maximum obtainable height is much smaller than this ideal theoretical limit.

5-41C  
Solution 
We are to compare siphoning at sea level and on a mountain.  
 
Analysis 
At sea level, a person can theoretically siphon water over a wall as high as 10.3 m. At the top of a high 
mountain where the pressure is about half of the atmospheric pressure at sea level, a person can theoretically siphon water 
over a wall that is only half as high. An atmospheric pressure of 58.5 kPa is insufficient to support a 8.5 meter high 
siphon. 
 
Discussion 
In actual practice, siphoning is also limited by frictional effects in the tube, and by cavitation.

Solution 
In a power plant, water enters the nozzles of a hydraulic turbine at a specified pressure. The maximum 
velocity water can be accelerated to by the nozzles is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1The flow of water is steady, incompressible, and irrotational with negligible frictional effects (so that the 
Bernoulli equation is applicable). 2 Water enters the nozzle with a low velocity. 
Properties 
We take the density of water to be  = 1000 kg/m3.   
Analysis 
We take points 1 and 2 at the inlet and exit of the nozzle, respectively. Noting that V1  0 and z1 =  z2, the

Solution 
The velocity of an aircraft is to be measured by a Pitot-static probe. For a given differential pressure 
reading, the velocity of the aircraft is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The air flow over the aircraft is steady, incompressible, 
and irrotational with negligible frictional effects (so that the Bernoulli 
equation is applicable). 2 Standard atmospheric conditions exist. 3 The 
wind effects are negligible. 
Properties 
The density of the atmosphere at an elevation of 3000 m is  
= 0.909 kg/m3. 
Analysis 
We take point 1 at the entrance of the tube whose opening is 
parallel to flow, and point 2 at the entrance of the tube whose entrance is 
normal to flow. Noting that point 2 is a stagnation point and thus V2 = 0 and 
z1 =  z2, the application of the Bernoulli equation between points 1 and 2

Solution 
A Pitot-static probe is inserted into the duct of an air heating system parallel to flow, and the differential 
height of the water column is measured. The flow velocity and the pressure rise at the tip of the Pitot-static probe are to be 
determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow through the duct is steady, incompressible, and irrotational with negligible frictional effects (so 
that the Bernoulli equation is applicable). 2 Air is an ideal gas.  
Properties 
We take the density of water to be  = 1000 kg/m3. The gas constant of air is R = 0.287 kPam3/kgK. 
Analysis 
We take point 1 on the side of the probe where the entrance is parallel to flow and is connected to the static 
arm of the Pitot-static probe, and point 2 at the tip of the probe where the entrance is normal to flow and is connected to the 
dynamic arm of the Pitot-static probe. Noting that point 2 is a stagnation point and thus V2 = 0 and z1 =  z2, the application

Note that the flow velocity in a pipe or duct can be measured easily by a Pitot-static probe by inserting the

Solution 
The drinking water needs of an office are met by large water bottles with a plastic hose inserted in it. The 
minimum filling time of an 8-oz glass is to be determined when the bottle is full and when it is near empty. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady, incompressible, and irrotational with negligible frictional effects (so that the Bernoulli 
equation is applicable). 2 All losses are neglected to obtain the minimum filling time.  
Analysis 
We take point 1 to be at the free surface of water in the bottle and point 2 at the exit of the tube so that P1 = 
P2 = Patm (the bottle is open to the atmosphere and water discharges into the atmosphere), V1  0 (the bottle is large relative 
to the tube diameter), and z2 = 0 (we take point 2 as the reference level). Then the Bernoulli equation simplifies to

Solution 
The static and stagnation pressures in a horizontal pipe are measured. The velocity at the center of the pipe 
is to be determined. 
Assumptions The flow is steady, incompressible, and irrotational with negligible frictional effects in the short distance 
between the two pressure measurement locations (so that the Bernoulli equation is applicable).  
Analysis 
We take points 1 and 2 along the centerline of the pipe, with point 1 directly under the piezometer and 
point 2 at the entrance of the Pitot-static probe (the stagnation point). 
This is a steady flow with straight and parallel streamlines, and thus the 
static pressure at any point is equal to the hydrostatic pressure at that 
point.  Noting that point 2 is a stagnation point and thus V2 = 0 and z1 =  
z2, the application of the Bernoulli equation between points 1 and 2 gives

A water tank of diameter Do and height H open to the atmosphere is initially filled with water. An orifice of 
diameter D with a smooth entrance (no losses) at the bottom drains to the atmosphere. Relations are to be developed for the 
time required for the tank to empty completely and half-way. 
Assumptions 1 The orifice has a smooth entrance, and thus the frictional losses are negligible. 2 The flow is steady, 
incompressible, and irrotational with negligible frictional effects (so that the Bernoulli equation is applicable).  
Analysis 
We take point 1 at the free surface of the tank, and point 2 at the exit of orifice. We take the reference level 
at the orifice (z2 = 0), and take the positive direction of z to be upwards. Noting that the fluid at both points is open to the 
atmosphere (and thus P1 = P2 = Patm) and that the fluid velocity at the free surface is very low  (V1  0), the Bernoulli 
equation between these two points simplifies to

that water surface in the tank moves down as the tank drains, and thus z is a variable whose value changes from H at the

Solution 
A siphon pumps water from a large reservoir to a lower tank which is initially empty. Water leaves the tank 
through an orifice. The height the water will rise in the tank at equilibrium is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady, incompressible, and irrotational 
with negligible frictional effects (so that the Bernoulli equation is 
applicable). 2 Both the tank and the reservoir are open to the 
atmosphere.  3 The water level of the reservoir remains constant.   
Analysis 
We take the reference level to be at the bottom of the 
tank, and the water height in the tank at any time to be h. We take point 
1 to be at the free surface of reservoir, point 2 at the exit of the siphon, 
which is placed at the bottom of the tank, and point 3 at the free surface 
of the tank, and point 4 at the exit of the orifice at the bottom of the 
tank.  Then z1 = 20 ft, z2 = z4 = 0, z3 = h,  P1 = P3 = P4 = Patm (the 
reservoir is open to the atmosphere and water discharges into the 
atmosphere) P2 = Patm+gh  (the hydrostatic pressure at the bottom of 
the tank where the siphon discharges), and V1  V3  0 (the free 
surfaces of reservoir and the tank are large relative to the tube 
diameter). Then the Bernoulli equation between 1-2 and 3-4 simplifies 
to

Therefore, the water level in the tank will stabilize when the water level rises to 10 ft.

Solution 
Water enters an empty tank steadily at a specified rate.  An orifice at the bottom allows water to escape.  
The maximum water level in the tank is to be determined, and a relation for water height z as a function of time is to be 
obtained. 
Assumptions 1 The orifice has a smooth entrance, and thus the frictional losses are negligible. 2 The flow through the 
orifice is steady, incompressible, and irrotational with negligible frictional effects (so that the Bernoulli equation is 
applicable).  
Analysis 
(a) We take point 1 at the free surface of the tank, and point 2 at the exit of orifice. We take the reference 
level at the orifice (z2 = 0), and take the positive direction of z to be upwards. Noting that the fluid at both points is open to 
the atmosphere (and thus P1 = P2 = Patm) and that the fluid velocity at the free surface is very low  (V1  0) (it becomes zero 
when the water in the tank reaches its maximum level), the Bernoulli equation between these two points simplifies to

Discussion 
Note that this relation is implicit in z, and thus we can’t obtain a relation in the form z = f(t). Substituting a z 
value in the left side gives the time it takes for the fluid level in the tank to reach that level. Equation solvers such as EES 
can easily solve implicit equations like this.

Solution 
Water flows through a horizontal pipe that consists of two sections at a specified rate. The differential 
height of a mercury manometer placed between the two pipe sections is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1The flow through the pipe is steady, incompressible, and irrotational with negligible frictional effects (so 
that the Bernoulli equation is applicable). 2 The losses in the reducing section are negligible. 
Properties 
The densities of mercury and water are Hg = 847 lbm/ft3 and w = 62.4 lbm/ft3. 
Analysis 
We take points 1 and 2 along the centerline of the pipe over the two tubes of the manometer. Noting that  z1 
=  z2, the Bernoulli equation between points 1 and 2 gives

Solution 
An airplane is flying at a certain altitude at a given speed. The pressure on the stagnation point on the nose 
of the plane is to be determined, and the approach to be used at high velocities is to be discussed. 
Assumptions 1 The air flow over the aircraft is steady, incompressible, and irrotational with negligible frictional effects 
(so that the Bernoulli equation is applicable). 2 Standard atmospheric conditions exist. 3 The wind effects are negligible. 
Properties 
The density of the atmospheric air at an elevation of 12,000 m is  = 0.312 kg/m3. 
Analysis 
We take point 1 well ahead of the plane at the level of the nose, and point 2 at the nose where the flow 
comes to a stop. Noting that point 2 is a stagnation point and thus V2 = 0 and z1 =  z2, the application of the Bernoulli 
equation between points 1 and 2 gives

Discussion 
A flight velocity of 1050 km/h = 292 m/s corresponds to a Mach number much greater than 0.3 (the speed 
of sound is about 340 m/s at room conditions, and lower at higher altitudes, and thus a Mach number of 292/340 = 0.86). 
Therefore, the flow can no longer be assumed to be incompressible, and the Bernoulli equation given above cannot be used. 
This problem can be solved using the modified Bernoulli equation that accounts for the effects of compressibility, assuming 
isentropic flow.

Solution 
The bottom of a car hits a sharp rock and a small hole develops at the bottom of its gas tank. For a given 
height of gasoline, the initial velocity of the gasoline out of the hole is to be determined. Also, the variation of velocity with 
time and the effect of the tightness of the lid on flow rate are to be discussed. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady, incompressible, and irrotational with negligible frictional effects (so that the Bernoulli 
equation is applicable). 2 The air space in the tank is at atmospheric pressure. 3 The splashing of the gasoline in the tank 
during travel is not considered. 
Analysis 
This problem involves the conversion of flow, kinetic, and potential energies to each other without 
involving any pumps, turbines, and wasteful components with large frictional losses, and thus it is suitable for the use of the 
Bernoulli equation. We take point 1 to be at the free surface of gasoline in the tank so that P1 = Patm (open to the 
atmosphere) V1  0 (the tank is large relative to the outlet), and z1 = 0.3 m  and z2 = 0 (we take the reference level at the 
hole. Also, P2 = Patm (gasoline discharges into the atmosphere). Then the Bernoulli equation simplifies to

Therefore, the gasoline will initially leave the tank with a velocity of 2.43 m/s.  
 
 
Discussion 
The Bernoulli equation applies along a streamline, and streamlines generally do not make sharp turns. The 
velocity will be less than 2.43 m/s since the hole is probably sharp-edged and it will cause some head loss. As the gasoline 
level is reduced, the velocity will decrease since velocity is proportional to the square root of liquid height. If the lid is 
tightly closed and no air can replace the lost gasoline volume, the pressure above the gasoline level will be reduced, and the 
velocity will be decreased.

Solution 
The water in an above the ground swimming pool is to be emptied by unplugging the orifice of a horizontal 
pipe attached to the bottom of the pool. The maximum discharge rate of water is to be determined. 
 Assumptions 1 The orifice has a smooth entrance, and all frictional losses are negligible. 2 The flow is steady, 
incompressible, and irrotational with negligible frictional effects (so that the Bernoulli equation is applicable).  
Analysis 
We take point 1 at the free surface of the pool, and point 2 at the exit of pipe. We take the reference level at 
the pipe exit (z2 = 0). Noting that the fluid at both points is open to the atmosphere (and thus P1 = P2 = Patm) and that the 
fluid velocity at the free surface is very low  (V1  0), the Bernoulli equation between these two points simplifies to

The result above is obtained by disregarding all frictional effects. The actual flow rate will be less because 
of frictional effects during flow and the resulting pressure drop. Also, the flow rate will gradually decrease as the water

Discussion 
This is the minimum discharging time 
since it is obtained by neglecting all friction; the 
actual discharging time will be longer. Note that the 
discharging time is inversely proportional to the 
square of the orifice diameter.  Therefore, the 
discharging time can be reduced to one-fourth by 
doubling the diameter of the orifice.

Solution 
Air flows upward at a specified rate through an inclined pipe whose diameter is reduced through a reducer. 
The differential height between fluid levels of the two arms of a water manometer attached  across the reducer is to be 
determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow through the duct is steady, incompressible and irrotational with negligible frictional effects (so 
that the Bernoulli equation is applicable). 2 Air is an ideal gas. 3 The effect of air column on the pressure change is 
negligible because of its low density. 4 The air flow is parallel to the entrance of each arm of the manometer, and thus no 
dynamic effects are involved. 
Properties 
We take the density of water to be  = 1000 kg/m3. The gas constant of air is R = 0.287 kPam3/kgK. 
Analysis 
We take points 1 and 2 at the lower and upper connection points, respectively, of the two arms of the 
manometer, and take the lower connection point as the reference level. Noting that the effect of elevation on the pressure 
change of a gas is negligible, the application of the Bernoulli equation between points 1 and 2 gives

This difference between the two results (1267 and 1269 Pa) is less than 1%. Therefore, the effect of air column on pressure 
change is, indeed, negligible as assumed. In other words, the pressure change of air in the duct is almost entirely due to 
velocity change, and the effect of elevation change is negligible. Also, if we were to account for the z of air flow, then it 
would be more proper to account for the z of air in the manometer by using water - air instead of water when calculating h. 
The additional air column in the manometer tends to cancel out the change in pressure due to the elevation difference in the 
flow in this case.

Solution 
A hand-held bicycle pump with a liquid reservoir is used as an atomizer by forcing air at a high velocity 
through a small hole. We are to explain how the liquid gets sucked up the tube. 
Assumptions 1 The flows of air and water are steady and nearly incompressible. 2 Air is an ideal gas. 3 The liquid 
reservoir is open to the atmosphere.  4 The device is held horizontally. 5 The water velocity through the tube is low (the 
water in the tube is nearly hydrostatic). 
Analysis 
At first glance, we are tempted to use the Bernoulli 
equation, thinking that the pressure in the air jet would be lower than 
atmospheric due to its high speed. However, as stated in the problem 
statement, the pressure through an incompressible jet exposed to the 
atmosphere is nearly atmospheric pressure everywhere. Thus, in the 
absence of the tube, the pressure in the air jet just above the tube 
would be nearly atmospheric. Meanwhile, the pressure at the liquid 
surface is also atmospheric. Applying hydrostatics from the liquid 
surface to the top of the tube reveals that the pressure at the top of the 
tube must be lower than atmospheric pressure by more than gh in 
order to suck the liquid up the tube. So, what causes the liquid to 
rise? It turns out that the answer has to do with streamline 
curvature. As the close-up sketch illustrates, the air streamlines 
must curve around the top of the tube. Since pressure decreases 
towards the center of curvature in a flow with curved streamlines, the 
pressure at the top of the tube must be less than atmospheric. At high 
enough air jet speed, the pressure is low enough not only to suck the 
liquid to the top of the tube, but also to break up the liquid at the top 
of the tube into small droplets, thereby “atomizing” the liquid into a 
spray of liquid droplets. 
Discussion 
If the geometry of the top of the tube were known, we could approximate the flow as irrotational and apply 
the techniques of potential flow analysis (Chap. 10) to estimate the pressure at the top of the tube.

which is higher than 25 m. Therefore, this main can serve water to 
neighborhoods that are 25 m above this location.  
Discussion 
Note that h must be much greater than 25 m for water to have enough pressure to serve the water needs of 
the neighborhood.

Solution 
Water discharges to the atmosphere from the orifice at the bottom of a pressurized tank. Assuming 
frictionless flow, the discharge rate of water from the tank is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The orifice has a smooth entrance, and thus the frictional losses are 
negligible. 2 The flow is steady, incompressible, and irrotational with negligible frictional 
effects (so that the Bernoulli equation is applicable).  
Properties 
We take the density of water to be 1000 kg/m3. 
Analysis 
We take point 1 at the free surface of the tank, and point 2 at the exit of 
orifice, which is also taken to be the reference level (z2 = 0). Noting that the fluid velocity 
at the free surface is very low  (V1  0) and water discharges into the atmosphere (and 
thus P2 = Patm), the Bernoulli equation simplifies to

Solution 
Air is flowing through a venturi meter with known diameters and measured pressures. A relation for the 
flow rate is to be obtained, and its numerical value is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1The flow through the venturi is steady, incompressible, and irrotational with negligible frictional effects 
(so that the Bernoulli equation is applicable). 2 The effect of air column on the pressure change is negligible because of its 
low density, and thus the pressure can be assumed to be uniform at a given cross-section of the venturi meter (independent 
of elevation change). 3 The flow is horizontal (this assumption is usually unnecessary for gas flow.). 
Properties 
The density of air is given to be  = 0.075 lbm/ft3.   
Analysis 
We take point 1 at the main flow section and point 2 at the throat along the centerline of the venturi meter.  
Noting that z1 = z2, the application of the Bernoulli equation between points 1 and 2 gives

Discussion 
Venturi meters are commonly used as flow meters to measure the flow rate of gases and liquids by simply 
measuring the pressure difference P1 - P2 by a manometer or pressure transducers. The actual flow rate will be less than the 
value obtained from Eq. (3) because of the friction losses along the wall surfaces in actual flow. But this difference can be 
as little as 1% in a well-designed venturi meter. The effects of deviation from the idealized Bernoulli flow can be accounted 
for by expressing Eq. (3) as

where Cc is the venturi discharge coefficient whose value is less than 1 (it is as large as 0.99 for well-designed venturi

Solution 
The water height in an airtight pressurized tank is given. A hose pointing straight up is connected to the 
bottom of the tank.  The maximum height to which the water stream could rise is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady, incompressible, and irrotational with 
negligible frictional effects (so that the Bernoulli equation is applicable). 2 The 
friction between the water and air is negligible.   
Properties 
We take the density of water to be 1000 kg/m3. 
Analysis 
We take point 1 at the free surface of water in the tank, and point 
2 at the top of the water trajectory. Also, we take the reference level at the 
bottom of the tank. At the top of the water trajectory V2 = 0, and atmospheric 
pressure pertains. Noting that z1 = 20 m, P1,gage = 2 atm, P2 = Patm,  and that the 
fluid velocity at the free surface of the tank is very low  (V1  0), the Bernoulli 
equation between these two points simplifies to

Therefore, the water jet can rise as high as 46.0 m into the sky from the ground. 
 
Discussion 
The result obtained by the Bernoulli equation represents the upper limit, and should be interpreted 
accordingly. It tells us that the water cannot possibly rise more than 46.0 m (giving us an upper limit), and in all likelihood, 
the rise will be much less because of frictional losses.

Solution 
A Pitot-static probe equipped with a water manometer is held parallel to air flow, and the differential height 
of the water column is measured. The flow velocity of air is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1The flow of air is steady, incompressible, and irrotational with negligible frictional effects (so that the 
Bernoulli equation is applicable). 2 The effect of air column on the pressure change is negligible because of its low density, 
and thus the air column in the manometer can be ignored.   
Properties 
We take the density of water to be  = 1000 kg/m3. The density of air is given to be 1.16 kg/m3. 
Analysis 
We take point 1 on the side of the probe where the entrance is parallel to flow and is connected to the static 
arm of the Pitot-static probe, and point 2 at the tip of the probe where the entrance is normal to flow and is connected to the 
dynamic arm of the Pitot-static probe. Noting that point 2 is a stagnation point and thus V2 = 0 and z1 =  z2, the application

Solution 
A water pipe bursts as a result of freezing, and water shoots up into the air a certain height. The gage 
pressure of water in the pipe is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady, incompressible, and irrotational with negligible frictional effects (so that the Bernoulli 
equation is applicable). 2 The water pressure in the pipe at the burst section is equal to the water main pressure. 3 Friction 
between the water and air is negligible. 4 The irreversibilities that may occur at the burst section of the pipe due to abrupt 
expansion are negligible.  
Properties 
We take the density of water to be 1000 kg/m3. 
Analysis 
This problem involves the conversion of flow, kinetic, 
and potential energies to each other without involving any pumps, 
turbines, and wasteful components with large frictional losses, and thus 
it is suitable for the use of the Bernoulli equation.  The water height 
will be maximum under the stated assumptions. The velocity inside the 
hose is relatively low (V1  0) and we take the burst section of the pipe 
as the reference level (z1 = 0). At the top of the water trajectory V2 = 0, 
and atmospheric pressure pertains. Then the Bernoulli equation 
simplifies to

Therefore, the pressure in the main must be at least 412 kPa above the atmospheric pressure.   
 
Discussion 
The result obtained by the Bernoulli equation represents a limit, since frictional losses are neglected, and 
should be interpreted accordingly. It tells us that the water pressure (gage) cannot possibly be less than 334 kPa (giving us a 
lower limit), and in all likelihood, the pressure will be much higher.

A well-fitting piston with 4 small holes in a sealed water-filled cylinder is pushed to the right at a constant 
speed while the pressure in the right compartment remains constant. The force that needs to be applied to the piston to 
maintain this motion is to be determined. 
Analysis  
When frictional effects are negligible, the pressures on both sides of the piston become identical:

(b) 
In this analysis, we have not accounted for any irreversibilities, such as friction, but in any real flow, friction 
would lead to higher pressure drop in the duct and thus the inlet pressure would have to be higher than predicted in 
order to overcome the additional losses due to friction. 
 
 
 
Discussion 
We must keep in mind that the Bernoulli equation is only an approximation. In Chap. 8 we learn how to 
approximate the additional pressure drop due to friction along the walls of a duct or pipe.

Discussion 
Part of the power supplied to the pump is not useful, but rather is wasted because of irreversible losses in 
the pump. This is the reason that pumps have a pump efficiency that is always less than one. 
 
 
 
 
 
5-70C  
Solution 
We are to analyze whether temperature can decrease during steady adiabatic flow of an incompressible 
fluid.  
 
Analysis 
It is impossible for the fluid temperature to decrease during steady, incompressible, adiabatic flow of an 
incompressible fluid, since this would require the entropy of an adiabatic system to decrease, which would be a violation of 
the 2nd law of thermodynamics. 
 
Discussion 
The entropy of a fluid can decrease, but only if we remove heat. 
 
 
 
 
 
5-71C  
Solution 
We are to define and discuss irreversible head loss.  
 
Analysis 
Irreversible head loss is the loss of mechanical energy due to irreversible processes (such as friction) in 
piping expressed as an equivalent column height of fluid, i.e., head. Irreversible head loss is related to the mechanical 
energy loss in piping by

5-49
5-72C  
Solution 
We are to determine if frictional effects are negligible in the steady adiabatic flow of an incompressible 
fluid if the temperature remains constant.  
 
Analysis 
Yes, the frictional effects are negligible if the fluid temperature remains constant during steady, 
incompressible flow since any irreversibility such as friction would cause the entropy and thus temperature of the fluid to 
increase during adiabatic flow. 
 
Discussion 
Thus, this scenario would never occur in real life since all fluid flows have frictional effects. 
 
 
 
 
 
5-73C  
Solution 
We are to define and discuss the kinetic energy correction factor.  
 
Analysis 
The kinetic energy correction factor is a correction factor to account for the fact that kinetic energy 
using average velocity is not the same as the actual kinetic energy using the actual velocity profile (the square of a 
sum is not equal to the sum of the squares of its components). The effect of kinetic energy factor is usually negligible, 
especially for turbulent pipe flows. However, for laminar pipe flows, the effect of  is sometimes significant. 
 
Discussion 
Even though the effect of ignoring  is usually insignificant, it is wise to keep  in our analyses to increase 
accuracy and so that we do not forget about it in situations where it is significant, such as in some laminar pipe flows. 
 
 
 
 
 
5-74C  
Solution 
We are to analyze the cause of some strange behavior of a water jet.  
 
Analysis 
The problem does not state whether the water in the tank is open to the atmosphere or not. Let’s assume that 
the water surface is exposed to atmospheric pressure. By the Bernoulli equation, the maximum theoretical height to which 
the water stream could rise is the tank water level, which is 20 meters above the ground. Since the water rises above the 
tank level, the tank cover must be airtight, containing pressurized air above the water surface. In other words, the 
water in the tank is not exposed to atmospheric pressure.  
 
Discussion 
Alternatively, a pump would have to pressurize the water somewhere in the hose, but this is not allowed, 
based on the problem statement (only a hose is added).

5-50
5-75C  
Solution 
We are to analyze a suggestion regarding a garden hose.  
 
Analysis  Yes. When water discharges from the hose at waist level, the head corresponding to the waist-knee vertical 
distance is wasted. When recovered, this elevation head is converted to velocity head, increasing the discharge velocity 
(and thus the flow rate) of water and thus reducing the filling time. 
 
Discussion 
If you are still not convinced, imagine holding the hose outlet really high up. If the outlet elevation is 
greater than the upstream supply head, no water will flow at all. If you are concerned about head losses in the hose, yes, 
they will increase as the volume flow rate increases, but not enough to change our answer. 
 
 
 
 
 
5-76C  
Solution 
We are to analyze discharge of water from a tank under different conditions.  
 
Analysis  (a) Yes, the discharge velocity from the bottom valve will be higher since velocity is proportional to the square 
root of the vertical distance between the hole and the free surface. (b) No, the discharge rates of water will be the same 
since the total available head to drive the flow (elevation difference between the ground and the free surface of water in the 
tank) is the same for both cases. 
 
Discussion 
Our answer to Part (b) does not change even if we consider head losses in the hose, because the hose is the 
same length in either case. Same hose, same length, same flow rate…yields the same head loss through the hose. Note: We 
are ignoring any effects of bends or curves in the hose – assume both cases have the same curves.

Therefore, the flow rate of water must be at least 3.47 ft3/s to generate the desired electric power while overcoming friction

Solution 
A pump is pumping oil at a specified rate. The pressure rise of oil in the pump is measured, and the motor 
efficiency is specified. The mechanical efficiency of the pump is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The elevation difference across the pump is negligible. 3 All the 
losses in the pump are accounted for by the pump efficiency and thus hL = 0. 4 The kinetic energy correction factors are 
given to be 1 = 2 =  = 1.05.  
Properties 
The density of oil is given to be  = 860 kg/m3.

Solution 
Water is pumped from a large lake to a higher reservoir. The head loss of the piping system is given. The 
mechanical efficiency of the pump is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The 
elevation difference between the lake and the reservoir is constant.    
Properties 
We take the density of water to be  = 1000 kg/m3. 
Analysis 
We choose points 1 and 2 at the free surfaces of the 
lake and the reservoir, respectively, and take the surface of the lake as 
the reference level (z1 = 0). Both points are open to the atmosphere (P1 
= P2 = Patm) and the velocities at both locations are negligible (V1 = V2 
= 0). Then the energy equation for steady incompressible flow through 
a control volume between these two points that includes the pump and 
the pipes reduces to

Solution 
A pump with a specified shaft power and efficiency is used to raise water to a higher elevation. The 
maximum flow rate of water is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The elevation difference between the reservoirs is constant. 3 
We assume the flow in the pipes to be frictionless since the maximum flow rate is to be determined,

Analysis 
We choose points 1 and 2 at the free surfaces of the lower and upper reservoirs, respectively, and take the 
surface of the lower reservoir as the reference level (z1 = 0). Both points are open to the atmosphere (P1 = P2 = Patm) and the 
velocities at both locations are negligible (V1 = V2 = 0). Then the energy equation for steady incompressible flow through a 
control volume between these two points that includes the pump and the pipes reduces to

Solution 
Water flows at a specified rate in a horizontal pipe whose diameter is decreased by a reducer. The pressures 
are measured before and after the reducer. The head loss in the reducer is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The pipe is horizontal. 3 The kinetic energy correction factors 
are given to be 1 = 2 =  = 1.05. 
Properties 
We take the density of water to be  = 1000 kg/m3. 
Analysis 
We take points 1 and 2 along the centerline of the pipe before and after the reducer, respectively. Noting 
that z1 =  z2, the energy equation for steady incompressible flow through a control volume between these two points reduces 
to

Solution 
A hose connected to the bottom of a tank is equipped with a nozzle at the end pointing straight up. The 
water is pressurized by a pump, and the height of the water jet is measured. The minimum pressure rise supplied by the 
pump is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible.  2 Friction between the water and air as well as friction in the hose 
is negligible.  3 The water surface is open to the atmosphere.   
Properties 
We take the density of water to be  = 1000 kg/m3. 
Analysis 
We take point 1 at the free surface of water in the tank, and point 2 at the top of the water  trajectory where 
V2 = 0 and P1 = P2 = Patm. Also, we take the reference level at the bottom of the tank.  Noting that z1 = 20 m and z2 = 27 m, 
hL =0 (to get the minimum value for required pressure rise), and that the fluid velocity at the free surface of the tank is very 
low  (V1  0), the energy equation for steady incompressible flow through a control volume between these two points that 
includes the pump and the water stream reduces to

Therefore, the pump must supply a minimum pressure rise of 68.7 kPa. 
 
Discussion 
The result obtained above represents the minimum value, and should be interpreted accordingly. In reality, a 
larger pressure rise will need to be supplied to overcome friction.

Solution 
A fan is to ventilate a bathroom by replacing the entire volume of air once every 10 minutes while air 
velocity remains below a specified value. The wattage of the fan-motor unit, the diameter of the fan casing, and the pressure 
difference across the fan are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible.  2 Frictional losses 
along the flow (other than those due to the fan-motor inefficiency) are 
negligible. 3 The fan unit is horizontal so that z = constant along the flow (or, 
the elevation effects are negligible because of the low density of air). 4 The 
effect of the kinetic energy correction factors is negligible,  = 1. 
Properties 
The density of air is given to be 1.25 kg/m3. 
Analysis 
(a) The volume of air in the bathroom is  V = 2 m  3 m  3 m = 18 m3. 
Then the volume and mass flow rates of air through the casing must be

the loses of the fan unit, which is accounted for by the efficiency), the energy equation for the fan section reduces to

Therefore, the fan will raise the pressure of air by 40 Pa before discharging it.

Solution 
Water flows through a horizontal pipe at a specified rate. The pressure drop across a valve in the pipe is 
measured. The corresponding head loss and the power needed to overcome it are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible.  2 The pipe is given to be horizontal (otherwise the elevation 
difference across the valve is negligible).  3 The mean flow velocities at the inlet and the exit of the valve are equal since 
the pipe diameter is constant. 
Properties 
We take the density of water to be  = 1000 kg/m3. 
Analysis 
We take the valve as the control volume, and points 1 and 2 at the inlet and exit of the valve, respectively. 
Noting that z1 = z2 and V1 = V2,  the energy equation for steady incompressible flow through this control volume reduces to

Solution 
A hose connected to the bottom of a pressurized tank is equipped with a nozzle at the end pointing straight 
up.  The minimum tank air pressure (gage) corresponding to a given height of water jet is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible.  2 Friction between water and air as well as friction in the hose is 
negligible.  3 The water surface is open to the atmosphere.   
Properties 
We take the density of water to be  = 62.4 lbm/ft3. 
Analysis 
We take point 1 at the free surface of water in the tank, and point 
2 at the top of the water  trajectory where V2 = 0 and P1 = P2 = Patm. Also, we 
take the reference level at the bottom of the tank.  Noting that z1 = 34 ft and z2 = 
72 ft, hL = 0 (to get the minimum value for the required air pressure), and that 
the fluid velocity at the free surface of the tank is very low  (V1  0), the energy 
equation for steady incompressible flow through a control volume between these 
two points reduces to

Therefore, the gage air pressure on top of the water tank must be at least 10.4 psi.   
Discussion 
The result obtained above represents the minimum value, and should be interpreted accordingly. In reality, a 
larger pressure will be needed to overcome friction.

Solution 
A water tank open to the atmosphere is initially filled with water. A sharp-edged orifice at the bottom drains 
to the atmosphere. The initial discharge velocity from the tank is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible.  2 The tank is open to the atmosphere. 3 The kinetic energy 
correction factor at the orifice is given to be 2 =  = 1.2. 
Analysis 
We take point 1 at the free surface of the tank, and point 2 at the exit of the orifice. Noting that the fluid at 
both points is open to the atmosphere (and thus P1 = P2 = Patm) and that the fluid velocity at the free surface of the tank is 
very low  (V1  0), the energy equation between these two points (in terms of heads) simplifies to

Solution 
Water enters a hydraulic turbine-generator system with a known flow rate, pressure drop, and efficiency. 
The net electric power output is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 All losses in the turbine are accounted for by turbine efficiency 
and thus hL = 0. 3 The elevation difference across the turbine is negligible. 4 The effect of the kinetic energy correction 
factors is negligible, 1 = 2 =  = 1. 
Properties 
We take the density of water to be 1000 kg/m3 and the density of mercury to be 13,560 kg/m3.  
Analysis 
We choose points 1 and 2 at the inlet and the exit of the turbine, respectively. Noting that the elevation 
effects are negligible, the energy equation in terms of heads for the turbine reduces to

Discussion 
It appears that this hydroelectric turbine will generate 55 kW of electric power under given conditions. Note 
that almost half of the available pressure head is discarded as kinetic energy. This demonstrates the need for a larger turbine 
exit area and better recovery. For example, the power output can be increased to 74 kW by redesigning the turbine and 
making the exit diameter of the pipe equal to the inlet diameter, D2 = D1. Further, if a much larger exit diameter is used and 
the exit velocity is reduced to a very low level, the power generation can increase to as much as 92 kW.

Discussion 
Note that ignoring the kinetic energy correction factor results in an error of just 4% in this case in the 
kinetic energy term (which may be small itself). Considering that the uncertainties in some terms are usually more that 4%, 
we can usually ignore this correction factor in turbulent pipe flow analyses. However, for laminar pipe flow analyses,  is 
equal to 2.0 for fully developed laminar pipe flow, and ignoring  may lead to significant errors.

Discussion 
The 6.76 kW of power is used to overcome the friction in the piping system. Note that the pump could raise 
the water an additional 23 m if there were no irreversible head losses in the system. In this ideal case, the pump would 
function as a turbine when the water is allowed to flow from the upper reservoir to the lower reservoir and extract 20 kW of 
power from the water.

Solution 
Water from a pressurized tank is supplied to a roof top. The discharge rate of water from the tank is to be 
determined.  
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The effect of the kinetic energy correction factor is negligible 
and thus 2 = 1 (we examine the effect of this approximation in the discussion).  
Properties 
We take the density of water to be 1000 kg/m3. 
Analysis 
We take point 1 at the free surface of the tank, and point 2 at the exit of the discharge pipe. Noting that the 
fluid velocity at the free surface of the tank is very low (V1  0) and water discharges into the atmosphere (and thus P2 = 
Patm), the energy equation written in the head form simplifies to

Discussion 
In an actual system, the flow rate of water will be less because of friction in the pipes. Also, the effect of 
flow velocities on the pressure change across the pump is negligible in this case (under 2%) and can be ignored.

Solution 
Underground water is pumped to a pool at a given elevation. For a given head loss, the flow rate and the 
pressures at the inlet and outlet of the pump are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The elevation difference between the inlet and the outlet of the 
pump is negligible. 3 The effect of the kinetic energy correction factors is negligible,  = 1.   
Properties 
We take the density of water to be 1 kg/L = 1000 kg/m3. 
Analysis 
(a) The pump-motor draws 5-kW of power, and is 78% efficient. Then the useful mechanical (shaft) power 
it delivers to the fluid is

Solution 
Water is pumped from a lake to a nearby pool by a pump with specified power and efficiency. The head 
loss of the piping system and the mechanical power used to overcome it are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The elevation difference between the lake and the free surface of 
the pool is constant. 3 All the losses in the pump are accounted for by the pump efficiency and thus hL represents the losses 
in piping. 
Properties 
We take the density of water to be  = 62.4 lbm/ft3.

Solution 
An entrepreneur is to build a large reservoir above the lake level, and pump water from the lake to the 
reservoir at night using cheap power, and let the water flow from the reservoir back to the lake during the day, producing 
power. The potential revenue this system can generate per year is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow in each direction is steady and 
incompressible. 2 The elevation difference between the lake 
and the reservoir can be taken to be constant, and the elevation 
change of reservoir during charging and discharging is 
disregarded. 3 The given unit prices remain constant. 4 The 
system operates every day of the year for 10 hours in each 
mode. 
Properties 
We take the density of water to be  = 1000 
kg/m3. 
Analysis 
We choose points 1 and 2 at the free surfaces of the lake and the reservoir, respectively, and take the surface 
of the lake as the reference level. Both points are open to the atmosphere (P1 = P2 = Patm) and the velocities at both locations 
are negligible (V1 = V2 = 0). Then the energy equation in terms of heads for steady incompressible flow through a control 
volume between these two points that includes the pump (or the turbine) and the pipes reduces to

It appears that this pump-turbine system has a potential annual income of about $11,800. A decision on 
such a system will depend on the initial cost of the system, its life, the operating and maintenance costs, the interest rate, 
and the length of the contract period, among other things.

Solution 
A fireboat is fighting fires by drawing sea water and discharging it through a nozzle. The head loss of the 
system and the elevation of the nozzle are given. The shaft power input to the pump and the water discharge velocity are to 
be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The effect of the kinetic energy correction factors is negligible, 
 = 1.  
Properties 
The density of sea water is given to be  =1030 kg/m3. 
Analysis 
We take point 1 at the free surface of the sea and point 
2 at the nozzle exit. Noting that P1 =  P2 = Patm and V1  0 (point 1 is at 
the free surface; not at the pipe inlet), the energy equation for the 
control volume between 1 and 2 that includes the pump and the piping 
system reduces to

Solution 
A hose is connected to the bottom of a water tank open to the atmosphere. The hose is equipped with a 
pump and a nozzle at the end. The maximum height to which the water stream could rise is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is incompressible with negligible friction.  2 The 
friction between the water and air is negligible. 3 We take the head loss to be 
zero (hL = 0) to determine the maximum rise of water jet.  
Properties 
We take the density of water to be 62.4 lbm/ft3. 
Analysis 
We take point 1 at the free surface of the tank, and point 2 at the 
top of the water trajectory where V2 = 0.  We take the reference level at the 
bottom of the tank. Noting that the fluid at both points is open to the atmosphere 
(and thus P1 = P2 = Patm) and that the fluid velocity at the free surface is very 
low  (V1  0), the energy equation for a control volume between these two points 
(in terms of heads) simplifies to

Solution 
Water discharges from the orifice at the bottom of a pressurized tank. The time it will take for half of the 
water in the tank to be discharged and the water level after 10 s are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is incompressible, and the frictional effects are negligible. 2 The tank air pressure above the 
water level is maintained constant.  
Properties 
We take the density of water to be 1000 kg/m3. 
Analysis 
We take point 1 at the free surface of the tank, and point 2 at the exit of orifice. We take the positive 
direction of z to be upwards with reference level at the orifice (z2 = 0). Fluid at point 2 is open to the atmosphere (and thus 
P2 = Patm) and the velocity at the free surface is very low  (V1  0). Then,

 where z is the water height in the tank at any time t. Water surface moves down as the tank 
drains, and the value of z changes from H initially to 0 when the tank is emptied completely.    
We denote the diameter of the orifice by D, and the diameter of the tank by Do. The flow rate of water from the

Solution 
Air flows through a pipe that consists of two sections at a specified rate. The differential height of a water 
manometer placed between the two pipe sections is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1The flow through the pipe is steady, incompressible, and irrotational with negligible friction (so that the 
Bernoulli equation is applicable). 2 The losses in the reducing section are negligible. 3 The pressure difference across an air 
column is negligible because of the low density of air, and thus the air column in the manometer can be ignored. 
Properties 
The density of air is given to be air = 1.20 kg/m3. We take the density of water to be w = 1000 kg/m3.  
Analysis 
We take points 1 and 2 along the centerline of the pipe over the two tubes of the manometer. Noting that  z1 
=  z2  (or, the elevation effects are negligible for gases), the Bernoulli equation between points 1 and 2 gives

Therefore, the differential height of the water column will be 1.37 cm.

Solution 
Air flows through a horizontal duct of variable cross-section. For a given differential height of a water 
manometer placed between the two pipe sections, the downstream velocity of air is to be determined, and an error analysis 
is to be conducted. 
Assumptions 1 The flow through the duct is steady, incompressible, and irrotational with negligible friction (so that the 
Bernoulli equation is applicable). 2 The losses in this section of the duct are negligible. 3 The pressure difference across an 
air column is negligible because of the low density of air, and thus the air column in the manometer can be ignored. 
Properties 
The gas constant of air is R = 0.287 kPam3/kgK. We take the density of water to be w = 1000 kg/m3.    
Analysis 
We take points 1 and 2 along the centerline of the duct over the two tubes of the manometer. Noting that  z1 
=  z2 (or, the elevation effects are negligible for gases) and V1  0, the Bernoulli equation between points 1 and 2 gives

Therefore, the velocity of air increases from a low level in the first section to 36.6

manometer fluid. That is,

Discussion 
The error analysis does not include the effects of friction in the duct; the error due to frictional losses is 
most likely more severe than the error calculated here.

This is the maximum flow rate since it is determined by assuming 
frictionless flow. The actual flow rate will be less.  
 
Adding a 2-m long larger diameter lead section will have no effect on the flow rate since the flow is frictionless 
(by using the Bernoulli equation, it can be shown that the velocity in this section increases, but the pressure decreases, and 
there is a smaller pressure difference to drive the flow through the tab, with zero net effect on the discharge rate). 
Discussion 
If the pressure in the tank were 300 kPa, the flow is no longer incompressible, and thus the problem in that 
case should be analyzed using compressible flow theory.

Solution 
Water is flowing through a venturi meter with known diameters and measured pressures. The flow rate of 
water is to be determined for the case of frictionless flow. 
Assumptions 1 The flow through the venturi is steady, incompressible, and irrotational with negligible friction (so that the 
Bernoulli equation is applicable). 2 The flow is horizontal so that elevation along the centerline is constant. 3 The pressure 
is uniform at a given cross-section of the venturi meter (or the elevation effects on pressure measurement are negligible). 
Properties 
We take the density of water to be  = 1000 kg/m3.   
Analysis 
We take point 1 at the main flow section and point 2 at the throat along the centerline of the venturi meter.  
Noting that z1 = z2, the application of the Bernoulli equation between points 1 and 2 gives

Discussion 
Venturi meters are commonly used as flow meters to measure the flow rate of gases and liquids by simply 
measuring the pressure difference P1 - P2 by a manometer or pressure transducers. The actual flow rate will be less than the 
value obtained from Eq. (3) because of the friction losses along the wall surfaces in actual flow. But this difference can be 
as little as 1% in a well-designed venturi meter. The effects of deviation from the idealized Bernoulli flow can be accounted 
for by expressing Eq. (3) as

where Cd is the venturi discharge coefficient whose value is less than 1 (it is as large as 0.99 for well-designed venturi

Solution 
Water flows through the enlargement section of a horizontal pipe at a specified rate. For a given head loss, 
the pressure change across the enlargement section is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow through the pipe is steady and incompressible. 2 The pipe is horizontal. 3 The kinetic energy 
correction factors are given to be 1 = 2  =  = 1.05. 
Properties 
We take the density of water to be  = 1000 kg/m3.  
Analysis 
We take points 1 and 2 at the inlet and exit of the enlargement section along the centerline of the pipe. 
Noting that  z1 = z2 ,  the energy equation for a control volume between these two points (in terms of heads) simplifies to

Therefore, the water pressure increases by 0.865 kPa across the enlargement section.  
Discussion 
Note that the pressure increases despite the head loss in the enlargement section. This is due to dynamic 
pressure being converted to static pressure. But the total pressure (static + dynamic) decreases by 0.65 m (or 6.38 kPa) as a 
result of frictional effects.

Solution 
The air in a hospital room is to be replaced every 20 minutes. The minimum diameter of the duct is to be 
determined if the air velocity is not to exceed a certain value. 
Assumptions 1 The volume occupied by the furniture etc in the room is negligible. 2 The incoming conditioned air does 
not mix with the air in the room. 
Analysis 
The volume of the room is

This problem shows that engineering systems are sized to satisfy certain constraints imposed by certain

Solution 
The rate of accumulation of water in a pool and the rate of discharge are given. The rate supply of water to 
the pool is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 Water is supplied and discharged steadily. 2 The rate of 
evaporation of water is negligible. 3 No water is supplied or removed 
through other means.  
Analysis 
The conservation of mass principle applied to the pool 
requires that the rate of increase in the amount of water in the pool be equal 
to the difference between the rate of supply of water and the rate of 
discharge. That is,

Solution 
A water tank open to the atmosphere is initially filled with water. A sharp-edged orifice at the bottom drains 
to the atmosphere through a long pipe with a specified head loss. The initial discharge velocity is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is incompressible. 2 The draining pipe is horizontal. 
3 There are no pumps or turbines in the system. 4 The effect of the kinetic 
energy correction factor is negligible,  = 1. 
Analysis 
We take point 1 at the free surface of the tank, and point 2 at the 
exit of the pipe. We take the reference level at the centerline of the orifice (z2 = 
0. Noting that the fluid at both points is open to the atmosphere (and thus P1 = 
P2 = Patm) and that the fluid velocity at the free surface is very low  (V1  0), the

Solution 
A water tank open to the atmosphere is initially filled with water. A sharp-edged orifice at the bottom drains 
to the atmosphere through a long pipe equipped with a pump with a specified head loss. The required pump head to assure a

Assumptions 1 The flow is incompressible. 2 The draining pipe is horizontal. 3 The effect of the kinetic energy correction 
factor is negligible,  = 1. 
Analysis 
We take point 1 at the free surface of the tank, and point 2 at the exit of the pipe. We take the reference 
level at the centerline of the orifice (z2 = 0), and take the positive direction of z to be upwards. Noting that the fluid at both

Solution 
A wind tunnel draws atmospheric air by a large fan. For a given air velocity, the pressure in the tunnel is to 
be determined. 
Assumptions 1The flow through the pipe is steady, incompressible, and irrotational with negligible friction (so that the 
Bernoulli equation is applicable). 2  Air is and ideal gas.  
Properties 
The gas constant of air is R = 0.287 kPam3/kgK.    
Analysis 
We take point 1 in atmospheric air before it enters the wind tunnel (and thus P1 = Patm and V1  0), and point 
2 in the wind tunnel. Noting that  z1 =  z2  (or, the elevation effects are negligible for gases), the Bernoulli equation between 
points 1 and 2 gives

We are to evaluate a proposed modification to a wind turbine. 
Analysis 
Using the mass and the Bernoulli equations, it can be shown that this is a bad idea – the velocity at the exit 
of nozzle is equal to the wind velocity. (The velocity at nozzle inlet is much lower). Sample calculation using EES using a 
wind velocity of 10 m/s: 
 
V0=10 "m/s" 
rho=1.2 "kg/m3" 
g=9.81 "m/s2" 
A1=2 "m2" 
A2=1 "m2" 
A1*V1=A2*V2 
P1/rho+V1^2/2=V2^2/2 
m=rho*A1*V1 
m*V0^2/2=m*V2^2/2 
 
Results: 
V1 = 5 m/s, V2 = 10 m/s,  m = 12 kg/s    (mass flow rate).  
 
Discussion 
Students’ approaches may be different, but they should come to the same conclusion – this does not help.

Newton’s Laws and Conservation of Momentum 
 
 
6-1C  
Solution 
We are to express Newton’s three laws.  
 
Analysis 
Newton’s first law states that “a body at rest remains at rest, and a body in motion remains in motion at 
the same velocity in a straight path when the net force acting on it is zero.” Therefore, a body tends to preserve its state 
or inertia. Newton’s second law states that “the acceleration of a body is proportional to the net force acting on it and is 
inversely proportional to its mass.” Newton’s third law states “when a body exerts a force on a second body, the second 
body exerts an equal and opposite force on the first.” 
 
Discussion 
As we shall see in later chapters, the differential equation of fluid motion is based on Newton’s second law. 
 
 
 
 
 
6-2C  
Solution 
We are to discuss Newton’s second law for rotating bodies.  
 
Analysis 
Newton’s second law of motion, also called the angular momentum equation, is expressed as “the rate of 
change of the angular momentum of a body is equal to the net torque acting it.” For a non-rigid body with zero net 
torque, the angular momentum remains constant, but the angular velocity changes in accordance with I = constant 
where I is the moment of inertia of the body. 
 
Discussion 
Angular momentum is analogous to linear momentum in this way: Linear momentum does not change 
unless a force acts on it. Angular momentum does not change unless a torque acts on it. 
 
 
 
 
 
6-3C  
Solution 
We are to discuss if momentum is a vector, and its direction.  
 
Analysis 
Since momentum (
V
m

) is the product of a vector (velocity) and a scalar (mass), momentum must be a 
vector that points in the same direction as the velocity vector. 
 
Discussion 
In the general case, we must solve three components of the linear momentum equation, since it is a vector 
equation.

6-3 
6-4C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the conservation of momentum principle.  
 
Analysis 
The conservation of momentum principle is expressed as “the momentum of a system remains constant 
when the net force acting on it is zero, and thus the momentum of such systems is conserved”. The momentum of a 
body remains constant if the net force acting on it is zero. 
 
Discussion 
Momentum is not conserved in general, because when we apply a force, the momentum changes. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Linear Momentum Equation 
 
 
 
6-5C  
Solution 
We are to compare the reaction force on two fire hoses.  
 
Analysis 
The fireman who holds the hose backwards so that the water makes a U-turn before being discharged 
will experience a greater reaction force. This is because of the vector nature of the momentum equation. Specifically, the 
inflow and outflow terms end up with the same sign (they add together) for the case with the U-turn, whereas they have 
opposite signs (one partially cancels out the other) for the case without the U-turn. 
 
Discussion 
Direction is not an issue with the conservation of mass or energy equations, since they are scalar equations. 
 
 
 
 
6-6C  
Solution 
We are to discuss surface forces in a control volume analysis.  
 
Analysis 
All surface forces arise as the control volume is isolated from its surroundings for analysis, and the 
effect of any detached object is accounted for by a force at that location. We can minimize the number of surface forces 
exposed by choosing the control volume (wisely) such that the forces that we are not interested in remain internal, 
and thus they do not complicate the analysis. A well-chosen control volume exposes only the forces that are to be 
determined (such as reaction forces) and a minimum number of other forces. 
 
Discussion 
There are many choices of control volume for a given problem. Although there are not really “wrong” and 
“right” choices of control volume, there certainly are “wise” and “unwise” choices of control volume.

6-7C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the importance of the RTT, and its relationship to the linear momentum equation.  
 
Analysis 
The relationship between the time rates of change of an extensive property for a system and for a 
control volume is expressed by the Reynolds transport theorem (RTT), which provides the link between the system and 
control volume concepts. The linear momentum equation is obtained by setting 
V
b


and thus 
V
m
B


 in the Reynolds 
transport theorem.  
 
Discussion 
Newton’s second law applies directly to a system of fixed mass, but we use the RTT to transform from the 
system formulation to the control volume formulation. 
 
 
 
 
 
6-8C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the momentum flux correction factor, and its significance.

rate and mean flow velocity as

(
. The value of  is unity for uniform flow, such as a jet flow, 
nearly unity for fully developed turbulent pipe flow (between 1.01 and 1.04), but about 1.3 for fully developed laminar pipe 
flow. So it is significant and should be considered in laminar flow; it is often ignored in turbulent flow. 
 
Discussion 
Even though  is nearly unity for many turbulent flows, it is wise not to ignore it.

where the left hand side is the net force acting on the control volume (which is zero here), the first term on the right hand 
side is the incoming momentum flux, and the second term on the right is the outgoing momentum flux by mass.  
 
Discussion 
This is a special simplified case of the more general momentum equation, since there are no forces. In this 
case we can say that momentum is conserved.

6-10C  
Solution 
We are to explain why we can usually work with gage pressure rather than absolute pressure.  
 
Analysis 
In the application of the momentum equation, we can disregard the atmospheric pressure and work with 
gage pressures only since the atmospheric pressure acts in all directions, and its effect cancels out in every direction. 
 
Discussion 
In some applications, it is better to use absolute pressure everywhere, but for most practical engineering 
problems, it is simpler to use gage pressure everywhere, with no loss of accuracy. 
 
 
 
 
6-11C  
Solution 
We are to discuss if the upper limit of a rocket’s velocity is limited to V, its discharge velocity.  
 
Analysis 
No, V is not the upper limit to the rocket’s ultimate velocity. Without friction the rocket velocity will 
continue to increase (i.e., it will continue to accelerate) as more gas is expelled out the nozzle. 
 
Discussion 
This is a simple application of Newton’s second law. As long as there is a force acting on the rocket, it will 
continue to accelerate, regardless of how that force is generated. 
 
 
 
 
6-12C  
Solution 
We are to describe how a helicopter can hover.  
 
Analysis 
A helicopter hovers because the strong downdraft of air, caused by the overhead propeller blades, 
manifests a momentum in the air stream. This momentum must be countered by the helicopter lift force. 
 
Discussion 
In essence, the helicopter stays aloft by pushing down on the air with a net force equal to its weight. 
 
 
 
 
6-13C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the power required for a helicopter to hover at various altitudes.  
 
Analysis 
Since the air density decreases, it requires more energy for a helicopter to hover at higher altitudes, 
because more air must be forced into the downdraft by the helicopter blades to provide the same lift force. Therefore, it 
takes more power for a helicopter to hover on the top of a high mountain than it does at sea level. 
 
Discussion 
This is consistent with the limiting case – if there were no air, the helicopter would not be able to hover at 
all. There would be no air to push down.

6-14C  
Solution 
We are to discuss helicopter performance in summer versus winter.  
 
Analysis 
In winter the air is generally colder, and thus denser. Therefore, less air must be driven by the blades to 
provide the same helicopter lift, requiring less power. Less energy is required in the winter. 
 
Discussion 
However, it is also harder for the blades to move through the denser cold air, so there is more torque 
required of the engine in cold weather. 
 
 
 
 
6-15C  
Solution 
We are to discuss if the force required to hold a plate stationary doubles when the jet velocity doubles.  
 
Analysis 
No, the force will not double. In fact, the force required to hold the plate against the horizontal water 
stream will increase by a factor of 4 when the velocity is doubled since

and thus the force is proportional to the square of the velocity. 
 
Discussion 
You can think of it this way: Since momentum flux is mass flow rate times velocity, a doubling of the 
velocity doubles both the mass flow rate and the velocity, increasing the momentum flux by a factor of four. 
 
 
 
 
6-16C  
Solution 
We are to describe and discuss body forces and surface forces.  
 
Analysis 
The forces acting on the control volume consist of body forces that act throughout the entire body of the 
control volume (such as gravity, electric, and magnetic forces) and surface forces that act on the control surface (such as 
the pressure forces and reaction forces at points of contact). The net force acting on a control volume is the sum of all body 
and surface forces. Fluid weight is a body force, and pressure is a surface force (acting per unit area). 
 
Discussion 
In a general fluid flow, the flow is influenced by both body and surface forces.

, where V is the relative velocity between the water and the plate, which is

acceleration must also decrease. 
 
Discussion 
It is the relative velocity of the water jet on the cart that contributes to the cart’s acceleration.

Solution 
We are to discuss the maximum possible velocity of a cart hit by a water jet.  
 
Analysis 
The maximum possible velocity for the plate is the velocity of the water jet. As long as the plate is 
moving slower than the jet, the water exerts a force on the plate, which causes it to accelerate, until terminal jet velocity is 
reached. 
 
Discussion 
Once the relative velocity is zero, the jet supplies no force to the cart, and thus it cannot accelerate further.

Solution 
A water jet of velocity V impinges on a plate moving toward the water jet with velocity ½V. The force 
required to move the plate towards the jet is to be determined in terms of F acting on the stationary plate. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The plate is vertical and the jet is normal to plate. 3 The pressure 
on both sides of the plate is atmospheric pressure (and thus its effect cancels out). 4 Fiction during motion is negligible. 5 
There is no acceleration of the plate. 6 The water splashes off the sides of the plate in a plane normal to the jet. 6 Jet flow is 
nearly uniform and thus the effect of the momentum-flux correction factor is negligible,   1.  
Analysis 
We take the plate as the control volume. The relative velocity between the plate and the jet is V when the 
plate is stationary, and 1.5V when the plate is moving with a velocity ½V  towards the plate. Then the momentum equation 
for steady flow in the horizontal direction reduces to

Therefore, the force required to hold the plate stationary against the oncoming water jet becomes 2.25 times greater 
when the jet velocity becomes 1.5 times greater.   
Discussion 
Note that when the plate is stationary, V is also the jet velocity. But if the plate moves toward the stream 
with velocity ½V, then the relative velocity is 1.5V, and the amount of mass striking the plate (and falling off its sides) per 
unit time also increases by 50%.

A 90 elbow deflects water upwards and discharges it to the atmosphere at a specified rate. The gage 
pressure at the inlet of the elbow and the anchoring force needed to hold the elbow in place are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 Frictional effects are negligible in the calculation of the pressure 
drop (so that the Bernoulli equation can be used). 3 The weight of the elbow and the water in it is negligible. 4 The water is 
discharged to the atmosphere, and thus the gage pressure at the outlet is zero. 5 The momentum-flux correction factor for 
each inlet and outlet is given to be  = 1.03. 
Properties 
We take the density of water to be 1000 kg/m3. 
Analysis 
(a) We take the elbow as the control volume, and designate the entrance by 1 and the outlet by 2. We also 
designate the horizontal coordinate by x (with the direction of flow as being the positive direction) and the vertical

Solution 
A horizontal water jet strikes a vertical stationary plate normally at a specified velocity. For a given 
anchoring force needed to hold the plate in place, the flow rate of water is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The water splatters off the sides of the plate in a plane normal to 
the jet. 3 The water jet is exposed to the atmosphere, and thus the pressure of the water jet and the splattered water is the 
atmospheric pressure which is disregarded since it acts on the entire control surface. 4 The vertical forces and momentum 
fluxes are not considered since they have no effect on the horizontal reaction force. 5 Jet flow is nearly uniform and thus the 
effect of the momentum-flux correction factor is negligible,   1. 
 
Properties 
We take the density of water to be 62.4 lbm/ft3. 
Analysis 
We take the plate as the control volume such that it contains the entire plate and cuts through the water jet 
and the support bar normally, and the direction of flow as the positive direction of x axis. The momentum equation for 
steady flow in the x (flow) direction reduces in this case to

Therefore, the volume flow rate of water under stated assumptions must be 7.22 ft3/s.   
 
Discussion 
In reality, some water will be scattered back, and this will add to the reaction force of water. The flow rate in 
that case will be less.

Solution 
A reducing elbow deflects water upwards and discharges it to the atmosphere at a specified rate. The 
anchoring force needed to hold the elbow in place is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 Frictional effects are negligible in the calculation of the pressure 
drop (so that the Bernoulli equation can be used). 3 The weight of the elbow and the water in it is considered. 4 The water 
is discharged to the atmosphere, and thus the gage pressure at the outlet is zero. 5 The momentum-flux correction factor for 
each inlet and outlet is given to be  = 1.03. 
Properties 
We take the density of water to be 1000 kg/m3.

Solution 
Water accelerated by a nozzle strikes the back surface of a cart moving horizontally at a constant velocity. 
The braking force and the power wasted by the brakes are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The water splatters off the sides of the plate in all directions in 
the plane of the back surface. 3 The water jet is exposed to the atmosphere, and thus the pressure of the water jet and the 
splattered water is the atmospheric pressure which is disregarded since it acts on all surfaces. 4 Fiction during motion is 
negligible. 5 There is no acceleration of the cart. 7 The motions of the water jet and the cart are horizontal. 6 Jet flow is 
nearly uniform and thus the effect of the momentum-flux correction factor is negligible,   1. 
Analysis 
We take the cart as the control volume, and the 
direction of flow as the positive direction of x axis. The relative 
velocity between the cart and the jet is 
m/s

Therefore, we can view the cart as being stationary and the jet moving 
with a velocity of 25 m/s. Noting that water leaves the nozzle at 20 m/s 
and the corresponding mass flow rate relative to nozzle exit is 30 kg/s, 
the mass flow rate of water striking the cart corresponding to a water jet 
velocity of 25 m/s relative to the cart is

Solution 
Water accelerated by a nozzle strikes the back surface of a cart moving horizontally. The acceleration of the 
cart if the brakes fail is to be determined. 
Analysis 
The braking force was determined in previous problem 
to be 535.8 N. When the brakes fail, this force will propel the cart 
forward, and the acceleration will be

Solution 
A water jet hits a stationary splitter, such that half of the flow is diverted upward at 45, and the other half is 
directed down. The force required to hold the splitter in place is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 
The water jet is exposed to the atmosphere, and thus the 
pressure of the water jet before and after the split is the 
atmospheric pressure which is disregarded since it acts on all 
surfaces. 3 The gravitational effects are disregarded. 4 The 
flow is nearly uniform at all cross sections, and thus the effect 
of the momentum-flux correction factor is negligible,   1. 
Properties 
We take the density of water to be 62.4 lbm/ft3.

We take the splitting section of water jet, including the splitter as the control volume, and designate the entrance by 1 and

The negative value for FRx indicates the assumed direction is wrong, and should be reversed. Therefore, a force of 1020 lbf 
must be applied to the splitter in the opposite direction to flow to hold it in place. No holding force is necessary in the 
vertical direction. This can also be concluded from the symmetry.  
Discussion 
In reality, the gravitational effects will cause the upper stream to slow down and the lower stream to speed 
up after the split. But for short distances, these effects are indeed negligible.

Solution 
A horizontal water jet impinges normally upon a vertical plate which is held on a frictionless track and is 
initially stationary. The initial acceleration of the plate, the time it takes to reach a certain velocity, and the velocity at a 
given time are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The water always splatters in the plane of the retreating plate. 3 
The water jet is exposed to the atmosphere, and thus the pressure of the water jet and the splattered water is the atmospheric 
pressure which is disregarded since it acts on all surfaces. 4 The track is nearly frictionless, and thus fiction during motion 
is negligible. 5 The motions of the water jet and the cart are horizontal. 6 The velocity of the jet relative to the plate remains 
constant, Vr = Vjet = V. 7 Jet flow is nearly uniform and thus the effect of the momentum-flux correction factor is negligible, 
  1.  
Properties 
We take the density of water to be 1000 kg/m3. 
Analysis 
(a) We take the vertical plate on the frictionless track as the control volume, and the direction of flow as the 
positive direction of x axis. The mass flow rate of water in the jet is

Solution 
A fan moves air at sea level at a specified rate. The force required to hold the fan and the minimum power 
input required for the fan are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow of air is steady and incompressible. 2 Standard atmospheric conditions exist so that the pressure 
at sea level is 1 atm. 3 Air leaves the fan at a uniform velocity at atmospheric pressure. 4 Air approaches the fan through a 
large area at atmospheric pressure with negligible velocity. 5 The frictional effects are negligible, and thus the entire 
mechanical power input is converted to kinetic energy of air (no conversion to thermal energy through frictional effects).   6 
Wind flow is nearly uniform and thus the momentum-flux correction factor can be taken to be unity,   1. 
Properties 
The gas constant of air is R = 0.3704 
psift3/lbmR. The standard atmospheric pressure at sea level is 
1 atm = 14.7 psi.  
Analysis 
(a) We take the control volume to be a 
horizontal hyperbolic cylinder bounded by streamlines on the 
sides with air entering through the large cross-section (section 
1) and the fan located at the narrow cross-section at the end 
(section 2), and let its centerline be the x axis. The density, 
mass flow rate, and discharge velocity of air are

Therefore, a useful mechanical power of 5.91 W must be supplied to air. This is the minimum required power input required

The actual power input to the fan will be larger than 5.91 W because of the fan inefficiency in converting 
mechanical power to kinetic energy.

Solution 
A horizontal water jet strikes a bent plate, which deflects the water by 135 from its original direction. The 
force required to hold the plate against the water stream is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The water jet is exposed to the atmosphere, and thus the pressure 
of the water jet and the splattered water is the atmospheric pressure, which is disregarded since it acts on all surfaces. 3 
Frictional and gravitational effects are negligible. 4 There is no splattering of water or the deformation of the jet, and the 
reversed jet leaves at the same velocity and flow rate. 5 Jet flow is nearly uniform and thus the momentum-flux correction 
factor is nearly unity,   1. 
Properties 
We take the density of water to be 62.4 lbm/ft3. 
Analysis 
We take the plate together with the curved water jet as the control volume, and designate the jet inlet by 1 
and the outlet by 2. We also designate the horizontal coordinate by x (with the direction of incoming flow as being the 
positive direction), and the vertical coordinate by z. The equation of conservation of mass for this one-inlet one-outlet

Discussion 
Note that the magnitude of the anchoring force is 3440 lbf, and its line of action is 158 from the positive x 
direction. Also, a negative value for FRx indicates the assumed direction is wrong; the actual anchoring force is to the left. 
This makes sense when we think about it; with the water jet striking the plate from left to right, one would have to push to 
the left in order to hold the plat in place.

Solution 
Firemen are holding a nozzle at the end of a hose while trying to extinguish a fire. The average water outlet 
velocity and the resistance force required of the firemen to hold the nozzle are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The water jet is exposed to the atmosphere, and thus the pressure 
of the water jet is the atmospheric pressure, which is disregarded since it acts on all surfaces. 3 Gravitational effects and 
vertical forces are disregarded since the horizontal resistance force is to be determined. 5 Jet flow is nearly uniform and 
thus the momentum-flux correction factor can be taken to be unity,   1.  
Properties 
We take the density of water to be 1000 kg/m3. 
Analysis 
(a) We take the nozzle and the horizontal 
portion of the hose as the system such that water enters the 
control volume vertically and outlets horizontally (this way 
the pressure force and the momentum flux at the inlet are in 
the vertical direction, with no contribution to the force balance 
in the horizontal direction), and designate the entrance by 1 
and the outlet by 2. We also designate the horizontal 
coordinate by x (with the direction of flow as being the 
positive direction). The average outlet velocity and the mass 
flow rate of water are determined from

Therefore, the firemen must be able to resist a force of 7958 N to hold the nozzle in place. 
Discussion 
The force of 7958 N is equivalent to the weight of about 810 kg. That is, holding the nozzle requires the 
strength of holding a weight of 810 kg, which cannot be done by a single person. This demonstrates why several firemen 
are used to hold a hose with a high flow rate.

Solution 
A horizontal jet of water with a given velocity strikes a flat plate that is moving in the same direction at a 
specified velocity. The force that the water stream exerts against the plate is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The water splatters in all directions in the plane of the plate. 3 
The water jet is exposed to the atmosphere, and thus the pressure of the water jet and the splattered water is the atmospheric 
pressure, which is disregarded since it acts on all surfaces. 4 The vertical forces and momentum fluxes are not considered 
since they have no effect on the horizontal force exerted on the plate. 5 The velocity of the plate, and the velocity of the 
water jet relative to the plate, are constant. 6 Jet flow is nearly uniform and thus the momentum-flux correction factor can 
be taken to be unity,   1. 
Properties 
We take the density of water to be 1000 kg/m3. 
Analysis 
We take the plate as the control volume, and the flow 
direction as the positive direction of x axis. The relative velocity 
between the plate and the jet is 
m/s

Therefore, we can view the plate as being stationary and the jet to be 
moving with a velocity of 30 m/s. The mass flow rate of water relative 
to the plate [i.e., the flow rate at which water strikes the plate] is

Therefore, the water jet applies a force of 1767 N on the plate in the direction of motion, and an equal and opposite force 
must be applied on the plate if its velocity is to remain constant. 
Discussion 
Note that we used the relative velocity in the determination of the mass flow rate of water in the momentum 
analysis since water will enter the control volume at this rate. (In the limiting case of the plate and the water jet moving at 
the same velocity, the mass flow rate of water relative to the plate will be zero since no water will be able to strike the 
plate).

Solution 
The previous problem is reconsidered. The effect of the plate velocity on the force exerted on the plate as 
the plate velocity varies from 0 to 30 m/s in increments of 3 m/s is to be investigated.

Solution 
A horizontal water jet strikes a curved plate, which deflects the water back to its original direction. The 
force required to hold the plate against the water stream is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The water jet 
is exposed to the atmosphere, and thus the pressure of the water jet and 
the splattered water is the atmospheric pressure, which is disregarded 
since it acts on all surfaces. 3 Friction between the plate and the surface it 
is on is negligible (or the friction force can be included in the required 
force to hold the plate). 4 There is no splashing of water or the 
deformation of the jet, and the reversed jet leaves horizontally at the same 
velocity and flow rate. 5 Jet flow is nearly uniform and thus the 
momentum-flux correction factor is nearly unity,   1. 
Properties 
We take the density of water to be 62.4 lbm/ft3. 
Analysis 
We take the plate together with the curved water jet as the control volume, and designate the jet inlet by 1 
and the outlet by 2. We also designate the horizontal coordinate by x (with the direction of incoming flow as being the 
positive direction). The continuity equation for this one-inlet one-outlet steady flow system is

Therefore, a force of 1540 lbf must be applied on the plate in the negative x direction to hold it in place. 
Discussion 
Note that a negative value for FRx indicates the assumed direction is wrong (as expected), and should be 
reversed. Also, there is no need for an analysis in the vertical direction since the fluid streams are horizontal.

Solution 
A helicopter hovers at sea level while being loaded. The volumetric air flow rate and the required power 
input during unloaded hover, and the rpm and the required power input during loaded hover are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow of air is steady and incompressible. 2 Air leaves the blades at a uniform velocity at atmospheric 
pressure. 3 Air approaches the blades from the top through a large area at atmospheric pressure with negligible velocity. 4 
The frictional effects are negligible, and thus the entire mechanical power input is converted to kinetic energy of air (no 
conversion to thermal energy through frictional effects).  5 The change in air pressure with elevation is negligible because 
of the low density of air. 6 There is no acceleration of the helicopter, and thus the lift generated is equal to the total weight. 
7 Air flow is nearly uniform and thus the momentum-flux correction factor can be taken to be unity,   1. 
Properties 
The density of air is given to be 1.18 kg/m3.   
Analysis 
(a) We take the control volume to be a vertical hyperbolic cylinder bounded by streamlines on the sides 
with air entering through the large cross-section (section 1) at the top and the fan located at the narrow cross-section at the 
bottom (section 2), and let its centerline be the z axis with upwards being the positive direction.

Solution 
A helicopter hovers on top of a high mountain where the air density considerably lower than that at sea 
level. The blade rotational velocity to hover at the higher altitude and the percent increase in the required power input to 
hover at high altitude relative to that at sea level are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow of air is steady and incompressible. 2 The air leaves the blades at a uniform velocity at 
atmospheric pressure. 3 Air approaches the blades from the top through a large area at atmospheric pressure with negligible 
velocity. 4 The frictional effects are negligible, and thus the entire mechanical power input is converted to kinetic energy of 
air.  5 The change in air pressure with elevation while hovering at a given location is negligible because of the low density 
of air. 6 There is no acceleration of the helicopter, and thus the lift generated is equal to the total weight. 7 Air flow is 
nearly uniform and thus the momentum-flux correction factor can be taken to be unity,   1. 
Properties 
The density of air is given to be 1.18 kg/m3 at sea level, and 0.928 kg/m3 on top of the mountain.  
Analysis 
(a) We take the control volume to be a vertical hyperbolic cylinder bounded by streamlines on the sides 
with air entering through the large cross-section (section 1) at the top and the fan located at the narrow cross-section at the 
bottom (section 2), and let its centerline be the z axis with upwards being the positive direction.

Therefore, the required power input will increase by approximately 
12.8% on top of the mountain relative to the sea level.  
Discussion 
Note that both the rpm and the required power input to the helicopter are inversely proportional to the 
square root of air density.  Therefore, more power is required at higher elevations for the helicopter to operate because air is 
less dense, and more air must be forced by the blades into the downdraft.

Solution 
Water flowing in a pipe is slowed down by a diffuser. The force exerted on the bolts due to water flow is 
to be determined. 
Assumptions 
1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 Frictional effects are negligible (so that the Bernoulli equation 
can be used). 3 The water is discharged to the atmosphere, and thus the gage pressure at the outlet is zero.  
Properties 
We take the density of water to be 1000 kg/m3.

Solution 
The weight of a water tank is balanced by a counterweight. Water enters the tank horizontally and there is 
a hole at the bottom of the tank. The amount of mass that must be added to or removed from the counterweight to maintain 
balance when the hole at the bottom is opened is to be determined. 
Properties 
We take the density of water to be 1000 kg/m3.

Solution 
A wind turbine with a given span diameter and efficiency is subjected to steady winds. The power generated 
and the horizontal force on the supporting mast of the turbine are to be determined. 
 
Assumptions 1 The wind flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The efficiency of the turbine-generator is independent of 
wind speed. 3 The frictional effects are negligible, and thus none of the incoming kinetic energy is converted to thermal 
energy. 4 Wind flow is uniform and thus the momentum-flux correction factor is nearly unity,   1.  
Properties 
The density of air is given to be 1.25 kg/m3.  
Analysis

Solution 
Water enters a centrifugal pump axially at a specified rate and velocity, and leaves in the normal direction 
along the pump casing. The force acting on the shaft in the axial direction is to be determined. 
Properties 
We take the density of water to be 1000 kg/m3. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The forces 
acting on the piping system in the horizontal direction are negligible. 3 
The atmospheric pressure is disregarded since it acts on all surfaces. 
Analysis 
We take the pump as the control volume, and the inlet 
direction of flow as the positive direction of x axis. The momentum 
equation for steady flow in the x (flow) direction reduces in this case to

Solution 
A curved duct deflects a fluid. The horizontal force exerted on 
the duct by the fluid is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The momentum-
flux correction factor for each inlet and outlet is given to account for 
frictional effects and the non-uniformity of the inlet and outlet velocity 
profiles. 
Properties 
The density of the liquid is  = 998.2 kg/m3. Viscosity does 
not enter our analysis. 
Analysis 
(a) We take the fluid within the duct as the control volume 
(see sketch), and designate the inlet by 1 and the outlet by 2. We also 
designate the horizontal coordinate by x (with the direction of flow as being 
the positive direction). Conservation of mass for this one-inlet one-outlet

Solution 
The curved duct analysis of the previous problem is to be examined more closely. Namely, we are to 
explain how the pressure can actually rise from inlet to outlet. 
Analysis 
The simple answer is that when the area ratio is greater than 1, the duct acts as a diffuser. From the 
Bernoulli approximation, we know that as the velocity decreases along the duct (since area increases), the pressure 
increases. Irreversibilities act counter to this, and cause the pressure to drop along the duct. For large enough area ratio, the 
diffuser effect “wins”. In this problem, the pressure changes from decreasing to increasing at an area ratio of around 1.3. 
 
Discussion 
The curvature does not affect the fact that the duct acts like a diffuser – the area still increases. In fact, some 
diffusers are curved, e.g., centrifugal pumps and the draft tubes of hydroelectric turbines, as discussed in the turbomachinery 
chapter.

Solution 
A fireman’s hose accelerates water from high pressure, low velocity to atmospheric pressure, high velocity 
at the nozzle exit plane. The horizontal force exerted on the duct by the water is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The momentum-flux correction factor for each inlet and outlet is 
given to account for frictional effects and the non-uniformity of the inlet and outlet velocity profiles. 
Properties 
The density of the water is  = 998.2 kg/m3. Viscosity does not enter our analysis. 
Analysis 
(a) We take the fluid within the duct as the control volume (see sketch), and designate the inlet by 1 and the 
outlet by 2. We also designate the horizontal coordinate by x (with the direction of flow as being the positive direction).

Solution 
A 90 reducer elbow deflects water downwards into a smaller diameter pipe. The resultant force exerted on 
the reducer by water is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 Frictional effects are negligible in the calculation of the pressure 
drop (so that the Bernoulli equation can be used). 3 The weight of the elbow and the water in it is disregarded since the 
gravitational effects are negligible. 4 The momentum-flux correction factor for each inlet and outlet is given to be  = 1.04. 
Properties 
We take the density of water to be 1000 kg/m3. 
Analysis 
We take the water within the elbow as the control volume (see 
sketch), and designate the inlet by 1 and the outlet by 2. We also designate the 
horizontal coordinate by x (with the direction of flow as being the positive 
direction) and the vertical coordinate by z. The continuity equation for this one-
inlet one-outlet steady flow system is

Solution 
The flow rate in a channel is controlled by a sluice gate by raising or lowering a vertical plate. A relation for 
the force acting on a sluice gate of width w for steady and uniform flow is to be developed. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady, incompressible, frictionless, and uniform (and thus the Bernoulli equation is 
applicable.) 2 Wall shear forces at channel walls are negligible.  3 The channel is exposed to the atmosphere, and thus the 
pressure at free surfaces is the atmospheric pressure.  4 The flow is horizontal. 5 Water flow is nearly uniform and thus the 
momentum-flux correction factor can be taken to be unity,   1. 
Analysis 
We take point 1 at the free surface of the upstream flow before the gate and point 2 at the free surface of the 
downstream flow after the gate. We also take the bottom surface of the channel as the reference level so that the elevations 
of points 1 and 2 are y1  and y2, respectively. The application of the Bernoulli equation between points 1 and 2 gives

Solution

Discussion 
The RTT is a general equation that holds for any property B, either scalar or (as in this case) vector.

Solution 
We are to compare the angular momentum of two rotating bodies 
 
Analysis 
No. The two bodies do not necessarily have the same angular momentum. Two rigid bodies having the 
same mass and angular speed may have different angular momentums unless they also have the same moment of inertia I. 
 
Discussion 
The reason why flywheels have most of their mass at the outermost radius, is to maximize the angular 
momentum.

Solution 
Water is pumped through a piping section. The moment acting on the elbow for the cases of downward and 
upward discharge is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The water is discharged to the atmosphere, and thus the gage 
pressure at the outlet is zero. 3 Effects of water falling down during upward discharge is disregarded. 4 Pipe outlet diameter 
is small compared to the moment arm, and thus we use average values of radius and velocity at the outlet. 
Properties 
We take the density of water to be 1000 kg/m3. 
Analysis 
We take the entire pipe as the control volume, and designate the 
inlet by 1 and the outlet by 2. We also take the x and y coordinates as shown. 
The control volume and the reference frame are fixed. The conservation of mass 
equation for this one-inlet one-outlet steady flow system is

(a) Downward discharge: To determine the moment acting on the pipe at point A, we need to take the moment of all 
forces and momentum flows about that point. This is a steady and uniform flow problem, and all forces and momentum 
flows are in the same plane. Therefore, the angular momentum equation in this case can be expressed as

where r is the moment arm, all moments in the counterclockwise direction are positive, and all 
in the clockwise direction are negative. 
The free body diagram of the pipe section is given in the figure. Noting that the moments of all forces and 
momentum flows passing through point A are zero, the only force that will yield a moment about point A is the weight W of 
the horizontal pipe section, and the only momentum flow that will yield a moment is the outlet stream (both are negative 
since both moments are in the clockwise direction). Then the angular momentum equation about point A becomes

The negative sign indicates that the assumed direction for MA is wrong, and should be reversed. Therefore, a moment of 70

Solution 
A two-armed sprinkler is used to generate electric power. For a specified flow rate and rotational speed, the 
power produced is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is cyclically steady (i.e., steady from a 
frame of reference rotating with the sprinkler head). 2 The water is 
discharged to the atmosphere, and thus the gage pressure at the nozzle 
outlet is zero. 3 Generator losses and air drag of rotating components 
are neglected. 4 The nozzle diameter is small compared to the moment 
arm, and thus we use average values of radius and velocity at the outlet. 
Properties 
We take the density of water to be 62.4 lbm/ft3. 
Analysis 
We take the disk that encloses the sprinkler arms as the 
control volume, which is a stationary control volume. The conservation

Solution 
Water enters a two-armed sprinkler vertically, and leaves the nozzles horizontally. For a specified flow rate, 
the rate of rotation of the sprinkler and the torque required to prevent the sprinkler from rotating are to be determined.  
Assumptions 1The flow is uniform and cyclically steady (i.e., steady from a frame of reference rotating with the sprinkler 
head). 2 The water is discharged to the atmosphere, and thus the gage pressure at the nozzle outlet is zero. 3 Frictional 
effects and air drag of rotating components are neglected. 4 The nozzle diameter is small compared to the moment arm, and 
thus we use average values of radius and velocity at the outlet.  
Properties 
We take the density of water to be 
1000 kg/m3 = 1 kg/L. 
Analysis 
We take the disk that encloses the 
sprinkler arms as the control volume, which is a 
stationary control volume. The conservation of mass 
equation for this symmetrical steady flow system is

 since the 
density of water is constant. Both jets are at the same 
elevation and pressure, and the frictional effects are 
said to be negligible. Also, the head losses in each 
arm are equal, so that mass flow rates in each nozzle 
are identical. Then,

Solution 
Water enters a two-armed sprinkler vertically, and leaves the nozzles horizontally. For a specified flow rate, 
the rate of rotation of the sprinkler and the torque required to prevent the sprinkler from rotating are to be determined.  
Assumptions 1The flow is uniform and cyclically steady (i.e., steady from a frame of reference rotating with the sprinkler 
head). 2 The water is discharged to the atmosphere, and thus the gage pressure at the nozzle outlet is zero. 3 Frictional 
effects and air drag of rotating components are neglected. 4 The nozzle diameter is small compared to the moment arm, and 
thus we use average values of radius and velocity at the outlet.  
Properties 
We take the density of water to be 
1000 kg/m3 = 1 kg/L. 
Analysis 
We take the disk that encloses the 
sprinkler arms as the control volume, which is a 
stationary control volume. The conservation of mass 
equation for this symmetrical steady flow system is

elevation and pressure, and the frictional effects are 
said to be negligible. Also, the head losses in each 
arm are equal, so that mass flow rates in each nozzle 
are identical. Then,

Discussion 
When 2 = 0, the shaft power is also zero as expected, since there is no turning at all. As 2 approaches 90o, 
the required shaft power rises rapidly towards infinity. We can never reach 2 = 90o because this would mean zero flow 
normal to the outlet, which is impossible.

A three-armed sprinkler is used to water a garden. For a specified flow rate and resistance torque, the 
angular velocity of the sprinkler head is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is uniform and cyclically steady (i.e., steady from a frame of reference rotating with the 
sprinkler head). 2 The water is discharged to the atmosphere, and thus the gage pressure at the nozzle outlet is zero. 3 Air 
drag of rotating components are neglected. 4 The nozzle diameter is small compared to the moment arm, and thus we use 
average values of radius and velocity at the outlet. 
Properties 
We take the density of water to be 1000 kg/m3 = 1 kg/L.

Solution 
A Pelton wheel is considered for power generation in a hydroelectric power plant. A relation is to be 
obtained for power generation, and its numerical value is to be obtained. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is uniform and cyclically steady. 2 The water is discharged to the atmosphere, and thus the gage 
pressure at the nozzle outlet is zero. 3 Friction and losses due to air drag of rotating components are neglected. 4 The nozzle 
diameter is small compared to the moment arm, and thus we use average values of radius and velocity at the outlet. 
Properties 
We take the density of water to be 1000 kg/m3 = 1 kg/L.   
Analysis 
The tangential velocity of buckets corresponding to an angular velocity of 
n

We take the imaginary disk that contains the Pelton wheel as the control volume. The inlet velocity of the fluid into this 
control volume is Vr, and the component of outlet velocity normal to the moment arm is Vrcos. The angular momentum 
equation can be expressed as

The actual power will be somewhat lower than this due to air drag and friction. Note that this is the shaft

Solution 
The previous problem is reconsidered. The effect of  on the power generation as  varies from 0 to 180 is to be 
determined, and the fraction of power loss at 160 is to be assessed.

can be used). 3 The water is discharged to the atmosphere, and thus the gage pressure at the outlet is zero.

Solution 
Water enters a two-armed sprinkler vertically, and leaves the nozzles horizontally at an angle to tangential 
direction. For a specified flow rate and discharge angle, the rate of rotation of the sprinkler and the torque required to 
prevent the sprinkler from rotating are to be determined. EES 
Assumptions 1 The flow is uniform and cyclically steady (i.e., steady from a frame of reference rotating with the 
sprinkler head). 2 The water is discharged to the atmosphere, and thus the gage pressure at the nozzle outlet is zero. 3 
Frictional effects and air drag of rotating components are neglected. 4 The nozzle diameter is small compared to the 
moment arm, and thus we use average values of radius and velocity at the outlet.  
Properties 
We take the density of water to be 1000 kg/m3 = 1 kg/L. 
Analysis 
We take the disk that encloses 
the sprinkler arms as the control volume, 
which is a stationary control volume. The 
conservation of mass equation for this 
symmetrical steady flow system is

Solution 
A horizontal water jet strikes a vertical stationary flat plate normally at a specified velocity. For a given 
flow velocity, the anchoring force needed to hold the plate in place is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The water splatters off the sides of the plate in a plane normal to 
the jet. 3 The water jet is exposed to the atmosphere, and thus the pressure of the water jet and the splattered water is the 
atmospheric pressure which is disregarded since it acts on the entire control surface. 4 The vertical forces and momentum 
fluxes are not considered since they have no effect on the horizontal reaction force. 5 Jet flow is nearly uniform and thus the 
momentum-flux correction factor can be taken to be unity,   1. 
Properties 
We take the density of water to be 1000 kg/m3. 
Analysis 
We take the plate as the control volume such that it contains the entire plate and cuts through the water jet 
and the support bar normally, and the direction of flow as the positive direction of x axis. We take the reaction force to be in 
the negative x direction. The momentum equation for steady flow in the x (flow) direction reduces in this case to

Therefore, a force of approximately 1770 N must be applied to the plate in the 
opposite direction to the flow to hold it in place.  
Discussion 
In reality, some water may be scattered back, and this would add to the reaction force of water. If we do not 
approximate the water jet as uniform, the momentum flux correction factor  would factor in. For example, if  = 1.03 
(approximate value for fully developed pipe flow), the force would increase by 3%. This is because the actual nonuniform 
jet has more momentum than the uniform jet.

Solution 
Steady developing laminar flow is considered in a constant horizontal diameter discharge pipe. A relation is 
to be obtained for the horizontal force acting on the bolts that hold the pipe. 
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady, laminar, and incompressible.  2 The flow is fully developed at the end of the pipe 
section considered. 3 The velocity profile at the pipe inlet is uniform and thus the momentum-flux correction factor is 1  = 
1. 4 The momentum-flux correction factor is   = 2 at the outlet. 
 
Analysis 
We  take the developing flow section of the pipe (including the water inside) as the control volume. We 
assume the reaction force to act in the positive direction. Noting that the flow is incompressible and thus the average 
velocity is constant V1 =  V2 =  V, the momentum equation for steady flow in the z (flow) direction in this case reduces to

Solution 
A fireman was hit by a nozzle held by a tripod with a rated holding force. The accident is to be investigated 
by calculating the water velocity, the flow rate, and the nozzle velocity. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The water jet is exposed to the atmosphere, and thus the pressure 
of the water jet is the atmospheric pressure, which is disregarded since it acts on all surfaces. 3 Gravitational effects and 
vertical forces are disregarded since the horizontal resistance force is to be determined.  4 Jet flow is nearly uniform and 
thus the momentum-flux correction factor can be taken to be unity,   1. 5 Upstream pressure and momentum effects are 
ignored. 
Properties 
We take the density of water to be 1000 kg/m3. 
Analysis 
We take the nozzle and the horizontal portion of the hose as the system such that water enters the control 
volume vertically and outlets horizontally (this way the pressure force and the momentum flux at the inlet are in the vertical 
direction, with no contribution to the force balance in the horizontal direction, and designate the entrance by 1 and the 
outlet by 2. We also designate the horizontal coordinate by x (with the direction of flow as being the positive direction).

Solution 
During landing of an airplane, the thrust reverser is lowered in the path of the exhaust jet, which deflects the 
exhaust and provides braking. The thrust of the engine and the braking force produced after the thrust reverser is deployed 
are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow of exhaust gases is steady and one-dimensional. 2 The exhaust gas stream is exposed to the 
atmosphere, and thus its pressure is the atmospheric pressure. 3 The velocity of exhaust gases remains constant during 
reversing. 4 Jet flow is nearly uniform and thus the momentum-flux correction factor can be taken to be unity,   1. 
Analysis 
(a) The thrust exerted on an airplane is simply the momentum flux of the combustion gases in the reverse 
direction,

This problem can be solved more generally by measuring the reversing angle from the direction of exhaust 
gases ( = 0 when there is no reversing). When  < 90, the reversed gases are discharged in the  negative x direction, and

Solution 
The previous problem is reconsidered. The effect of thrust reverser angle on the braking force exerted on 
the airplane as the reverser angle varies from 0 (no reversing) to 180 (full reversing) in increments of 10 is to be 
investigated.

Discussion 
As expected, the braking force is zero when the angle is zero (no deflection), and maximum when the angle 
is 180o (completely reversed). Of course, it is impossible to completely reverse the flow, since the jet exhaust cannot be 
directed back into the engine.

Solution 
The rocket of a spacecraft is fired in the opposite direction to motion. The deceleration, the velocity change, 
and the thrust are to be determined.  
Assumptions 1 The flow of combustion gases is steady and one-dimensional during the firing period, but the flight of the 
spacecraft is unsteady.  2 There are no external forces acting on the spacecraft, and the effect of pressure force at the nozzle 
outlet is negligible. 3 The mass of discharged fuel is negligible relative to the mass of the spacecraft, and thus the spacecraft 
may be treated as a solid body with a constant mass. 4 The nozzle is well-designed such that the effect of the momentum-
flux correction factor is negligible, and thus   1. 
Analysis 
(a) We choose a reference frame in which the control 
volume moves with the spacecraft. Then the velocities of fluid steams 
become simply their relative velocities (relative to the moving body). 
We take the direction of motion of the spacecraft as the positive 
direction along the x axis. There are no external forces acting on the 
spacecraft, and its mass is nearly constant. Therefore, the spacecraft can 
be treated as a solid body with constant mass, and the momentum 
equation in this case is

Therefore, if this spacecraft were attached somewhere, it would exert a force of 23,300 lbf (equivalent to the weight of 
23,300 lbm of mass on earth) to its support in the negative x direction. 
 
Discussion 
In Part (b) we approximate the deceleration as constant. However, since mass is lost from the spacecraft 
during the time in which the jet is on, a more accurate solution would involve solving a differential equation. Here, the time 
span is short, and the lost mass is likely negligible compared to the total mass of the spacecraft, so the more complicated 
analysis is not necessary.

Solution 
An ice skater is holding a flexible hose (essentially weightless) which directs a stream of water horizontally 
at a specified velocity. The velocity and the distance traveled in 5 seconds, and the time it takes to move 5 m and the 
velocity at that moment are to be determined. 
Assumptions 
1 Friction between the skates and ice is negligible. 2 The flow of water is steady and one-dimensional (but 
the motion of skater is unsteady). 3 The ice skating arena is level, and the water jet is discharged horizontally. 4 The mass 
of the hose and the water in it is negligible.  5 The skater is standing still initially at t = 0. 6 Jet flow is nearly uniform and 
thus the momentum-flux correction factor can be taken to be unity,   1.

Solution 
A water jet hits a stationary cone, such that the flow is diverted equally in all directions at 45. The force 
required to hold the cone in place against the water stream is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The water jet is exposed to the atmosphere, and thus the pressure 
of the water jet before and after the split is the atmospheric pressure which is disregarded since it acts on all surfaces. 3 The 
gravitational effects are disregarded. 4 Jet flow is nearly uniform and thus the momentum-flux correction factor can be 
taken to be unity,   1.

The negative value for FRx indicates that the assumed direction is wrong, and should be reversed. Therefore, a force of 518 
N must be applied to the cone in the opposite direction to flow to hold it in place. No holding force is necessary in the 
vertical direction due to symmetry and neglecting gravitational effects.  
Discussion 
In reality, the gravitational effects will cause the upper part of flow to slow down and the lower part to 
speed up after the split. But for short distances, these effects are negligible.

Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible.  2 The weight of the U-turn and the water in it is negligible. 4 The 
momentum-flux correction factor for each inlet and outlet is given to be  = 1.03.

The negative value for FRx indicates the assumed direction is wrong, and should be reversed. Therefore, a force of 2390 N 
acts on the flanges in the opposite direction. A vertical force of 328 N acts on the flange in the vertical direction.   
Discussion 
To assess the significance of gravity forces, we estimate the weight of the weight of water in the U-turn and 
compare it to the vertical force. Assuming the length of the U-turn to be 0.5 m and the average diameter to be 7.5 cm, the 
mass of the water becomes

Solution 
Indiana Jones is to ascend a building by building a platform, and mounting four water nozzles pointing 
down at each corner. The minimum water jet velocity needed to raise the system, the time it will take to rise to the top of 
the building and the velocity of the system at that moment, the additional rise when the water is shut off, and the time he 
has to jump from the platform to the roof are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The air resistance is negligible. 2 The flow of water is steady and one-dimensional (but the motion of 
platform is unsteady).  3 The platform is still initially at t = 0. 4 Jet flow is nearly uniform and thus the momentum-flux 
correction factor can be taken to be unity,   1. 
Properties 
We take the density of water to be 1000 kg/m3.

Solution 
A box-enclosed fan is faced down so the air blast is directed downwards, and it is to be hovered by 
increasing the blade rpm. The required blade rpm, air outlet velocity, the volumetric flow rate, and the minimum 
mechanical power are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow of air is steady and incompressible. 2 The air leaves the blades at a uniform velocity at 
atmospheric pressure, and thus the momentum-flux correction factor can be taken to be unity,   1. 3 Air approaches the 
blades from the top through a large area at atmospheric pressure with negligible velocity. 4 The frictional effects are 
negligible, and thus the entire mechanical power input is converted to kinetic energy of air (no conversion to thermal 
energy through frictional effects).  5 The change in air pressure with elevation is negligible because of the low density of 
air. 6 There is no acceleration of the fan, and thus the lift generated is equal to the total weight.  
Properties 
The density of air is given to be 0.078 lbm/ft3.   
Analysis 
(a) We take the control volume to be a vertical hyperbolic cylinder bounded by streamlines on the sides 
with air entering through the large cross-section (section 1) at the top and the fan located at the narrow cross-section at the 
bottom (section 2), and let its centerline be the z axis with upwards being the positive direction.

Solution 
A plate is maintained in a horizontal position by frictionless vertical guide rails. The underside of the plate 
is subjected to a water jet. The minimum mass flow rate 
min

to just levitate the plate is to be determined, and a relation is 
to be obtained for the steady state upward velocity. Also, the integral that relates velocity to time when the water is first 
turned on is to be obtained. 
Assumptions 1 The flow of water is steady and one-dimensional. 2 The water jet splatters in the plane of he plate.  3 The 
vertical guide rails are frictionless. 4 Times are short, so the velocity of the rising jet can be considered to remain constant 
with height. 5 At time t = 0, the plate is at rest. 6 Jet flow is nearly uniform and thus the momentum-flux correction factor 
can be taken to be unity,   1.

Solution 
A vertical water jet strikes a horizontal stationary plate normally. The maximum weight of the plate that can 
be supported by the water jet at a specified height is to be determined. 
 
Assumptions 1 The flow of water at the nozzle outlet is steady and incompressible.  2 The water splatters in directions 
normal to the approach direction of the water jet. 3 The water jet is exposed to the atmosphere, and thus the pressure of the 
water jet and the splattered water leaving the control volume is atmospheric pressure . 4 Friction between the water and air 
is negligible. 5 The effect of the momentum-flux correction factor is negligible, and thus   1 for the jet. 
 
Properties 
We take the density of water to be 1000 kg/m3. 
Analysis 
We take the x axis as the upward vertical direction. We also take point 1 at the point where the water jet 
leaves the nozzle, and point 2 at the point where the jet strikes the flat plate. Noting that water jet is exposed to the 
atmosphere, we have P1 =  P2  = Patm ,  Also, z1 = 0 and z2 = h. Then the Bernoulli Equation simplifies to

Solution 
It is to be shown that the force exerted by a liquid jet of velocity V on a stationary nozzle is proportional to 
V2, or alternatively, to 
2
m
. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The nozzle is given to be stationary.  3 The nozzle involves a 
90 turn and thus the incoming and outgoing flow streams are normal to each other. 4 The water is discharged to the 
atmosphere, and thus the gage pressure at the outlet is zero. 
Analysis 
We take the nozzle as the control volume, and the flow 
direction at the outlet as the x axis. Note that the nozzle makes a 90 
turn, and thus it does not contribute to any pressure force or momentum 
flux term at the inlet in the x direction. Noting that

Solution 
A parachute slows a soldier from his terminal velocity VT to his landing velocity of VF.  A relation is to be 
developed for the soldier’s velocity after he opens the parachute at time t = 0. 
Assumptions 1 The air resistance is proportional to the velocity squared (i.e. F = -kV2). 2 The variation of the air 
properties with altitude is negligible. 3 The buoyancy force applied by air to the person (and the parachute) is negligible 
because of the small volume occupied and the low density of air. 4 The final velocity of the soldier is equal to its terminal 
velocity with his parachute open.  
Analysis 
The terminal velocity of a free falling object is reached when the air resistance (or air drag) equals the 
weight of the object, less the buoyancy force applied by the fluid, which is negligible in this case,

Solution 
An empty cart is to be driven by a horizontal water jet that enters from a hole at the rear of the cart. A 
relation is to be developed for cart velocity versus time. 
Assumptions 1 The flow of water is steady, one-dimensional, incompressible, and horizontal. 2 All the water which 
enters the cart is retained. 3 The path of the cart is level and frictionless.  4 The cart is initially empty and stationary, and 
thus V = 0 at time t = 0. 5 Friction between water jet and air is negligible, and the entire momentum of water jet is used to 
drive the cart with no losses. 6 Jet flow is nearly uniform and thus the momentum-flux correction factor can be taken to be 
unity,   1. 
Analysis 
We note that the water jet velocity VJ is constant, but the car velocity V is variable. Noting that

Solution 
A two-armed sprinkler is used to water a garden. For specified flow rate and discharge angles, the rates of 
rotation of the sprinkler head are to be determined. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is uniform and cyclically steady (i.e., steady from a frame of reference rotating with the 
sprinkler head). 2 The water is discharged to the atmosphere, and thus the gage pressure at the nozzle outlet is zero. 3 
Frictional effects and air drag of rotating components are neglected. 4 The nozzle diameter is small compared to the 
moment arm, and thus we use average values of radius and velocity at the outlet. 
Properties 
We take the density of water to be 1000 kg/m3 = 1 kg/L. 
Analysis 
We take the disk that encloses the sprinkler arms as the control volume, which is a stationary control 
volume. The conservation of mass equation for this steady flow system is

Discussion 
The maximum rpm occurs when  = 0o, as expected, since this represents purely tangential outflow. When  
= 90o, the rpm drops to zero, as also expected, since the outflow is purely radial and therefore there is no torque to spin the 
sprinkler.

Solution 
A stationary water tank placed on wheels on a frictionless surface is propelled by a water jet that leaves the 
tank through a smooth hole. Relations are to be developed for the acceleration, the velocity, and  the distance traveled by 
the tank as a function of time as water discharges. 
Assumptions 1 The orifice has a smooth entrance, and thus the frictional losses are negligible. 2 The flow is steady, 
incompressible, and irrotational (so that the Bernoulli equation is applicable).  3 The surface under the wheeled tank is level 
and frictionless. 4 The water jet is discharged horizontally and rearward. 5 The mass of the tank and wheel assembly is 
negligible compared to the mass of water in the tank. 4 Jet flow is nearly uniform and thus the momentum-flux correction 
factor can be taken to be unity,   1.    
Analysis 
(a) We take point 1 at the free surface of the tank, and point 2 at 
the outlet of the hole, which is also taken to be the reference level (z2 = 0) so that 
the water height above the hole at any time is z. Noting that the fluid velocity at 
the free surface is very low (V1  0), it is open to the atmosphere (P1 = Patm), and 
water discharges into the atmosphere (and thus P2 = Patm), the Bernoulli equation 
simplifies to

In reality, the flow rate discharge velocity and thus the force acting on the water tank will be less because of 
the frictional losses at the hole. But these losses can be accounted for by incorporating a discharge coefficient.

Solution 
The rocket of a satellite is fired in the opposite direction to motion. The thrust exerted on the satellite, the 
acceleration, and the velocity change are to be determined. 
 
Assumptions 1 The flow of combustion gases is steady and one-dimensional during the firing period, but the motion of 
the satellite is unsteady. 2 There are no external forces acting on the spacecraft, and the effect of pressure force at the 
nozzle outlet is negligible. 3 The mass of discharged fuel is negligible relative to the mass of the spacecraft, and thus, the 
spacecraft may be treated as a solid body with a constant mass. 4 The nozzle is well designed such that the effect of the 
momentum-flux correction factor is negligible, and thus   1. 
 
Analysis 
(a) For convenience, we choose an inertial reference frame that moves with the satellite at the same initial 
velocity. Then the velocities of fluid stream relative to an inertial reference frame become simply the velocities relative to 
the satellite. We take the direction of motion of the satellite as the positive direction along the x-axis. There are no external 
forces acting on the satellite, and its mass is essentially constant. Therefore, the satellite can be treated as a solid body with 
constant mass, and the momentum equation in this case is

Discussion 
Note that if this satellite were attached somewhere, it would exert a force of 100 kN (equivalent to the 
weight of 10 tons of mass) to its support. This can be verified by taking the satellite as the system and applying the 
momentum equation.

Solution 
Water enters a centrifugal pump axially at a specified rate and velocity, and leaves at an angle from the 
axial direction. The force acting on the shaft in the axial direction is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The forces acting on the piping system in the horizontal 
direction are negligible. 3 The atmospheric pressure is disregarded since it acts on all surfaces. 4 Water flow is nearly 
uniform at the outlet and thus the momentum-flux correction factor can be taken to be unity,   1. 
Properties 
We take the density of water to be 1000 kg/m3.

Dimensions and Units, Primary Dimensions 
 
 
 
7-1C 
Solution 
We are to list the seven primary dimensions and explain their significance.  
 
Analysis 
The seven primary dimensions are mass, length, time, temperature, electrical current, amount of light, 
and amount of matter. Their significance is that all other dimensions can be formed by combinations of these seven 
primary dimensions. 
 
Discussion 
One of the first steps in a dimensional analysis is to write down the primary dimensions of every variable or 
parameter that is important in the problem. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
7-2C 
Solution 
We are to explain the difference between a dimension and a unit, and give examples.  
 
Analysis 
A dimension is a measure of a physical quantity (without numerical values), while a unit is a way to 
assign a number to that dimension. Examples are numerous – length and meter, temperature and oC, weight and lbf, mass 
and kg, time and second, power and watt,… 
 
Discussion 
When performing dimensional analysis, it is important to recognize the difference between dimensions and 
units.

7-5 
Solution 
We are to append the given table with other parameters and their primary dimensions.  
 
Analysis 
Students’ tables will differ, but they should add entries such as angular velocity, kinematic viscosity, work, 
energy, power, specific heat, thermal conductivity, torque or moment, stress, etc. 
 
Discussion 
This problem should be assigned as an ongoing homework problem throughout the semester, and then 
collected towards the end. Individual instructors can determine how many entries to be required in the table.

Solution 
We are to write the primary dimensions of several variables in the force-length-time system. 
 
Analysis 
We start with the dimensions of force in the mass-length-time (m-L-t) system: {F} = {m1L1t-2}, from which 
we solve for the dimensions of mass in the force-length-time (F-L-t) system,

Sometimes the F-L-t system is easier to use than the m-L-t system. Neither one is “right” or “wrong” – it is 
a matter of personal preference, although the m-L-t system is the more popular one, especially in fluid mechanics.

Discussion 
As a check, from our study of thermodynamics we know that dh = cpdT for an ideal gas. Thus, the 
dimensions of dh must equal the dimensions of cp times the dimensions of dT. Comparing Eqs. 1 and 3 above, we see that 
this is indeed the case.

Or, in exponent form, {k} = {m1 L1 t-3 T-1}. We obtain a value of k from a reference book. E.g. kcopper = 401 W/mK. These 
units have dimensions of power/lengthtemperature. Since power is energy/time, we see immediately that Eq. 1 is correct. 
Alternatively, we can transform the units of k into primary units,

Dimensional Homogeneity 
 
 
7-20C 
Solution 
We are to explain the law of dimensional homogeneity.  
 
Analysis 
The law of dimensional homogeneity states that every additive term in an equation must have the same 
dimensions. As a simple counter example, an equation with one term of dimensions length and another term of dimensions 
temperature would clearly violate the law of dimensional homogeneity – you cannot add length and temperature. All terms 
in the equation must have the same dimensions. 
 
Discussion 
If in the solution of an equation you realize that the dimensions of two terms are not equivalent, this is a 
sure sign that you have made a mistake somewhere! 
 
 
 
 
 
7-21 
Solution 
We are to determine the primary dimensions of the gradient operator, and then verify that primary 
dimensions of each additive term in the equation are the same. 
 
Analysis 
 
(a) By definition, the gradient operator is a three-dimensional derivative operator. For example, in Cartesian coordinates,

length/time, and the primary dimensions of acceleration are length/time2. Thus each term in the given equation can be

Discussion 
If the dimensions of any of the terms were different from the others, it would be a sure sign that an error 
was made somewhere in deriving or copying the equation.

Solution 
We are to determine the primary dimensions of each additive term, and we are to verify that the equation is 
dimensionally homogeneous.  
 
Analysis 
The primary dimensions of the time derivative (d/dt) are 1/time. The primary dimensions of density are 
mass/length3, those of volume are length3, those of area are length2, and those of velocity are length/time. The primary 
dimensions of unit vector n are unity, i.e. {1} (in other words n has no dimensions). Finally, the primary dimensions of b, 
which is defined as B per unit mass, are {B/m}. Thus each term in the equation can be written in terms of primary 
dimensions,

Solution 
We are to determine the primary dimensions of each additive term in the equation, and we are to verify that 
the equation is dimensionally homogeneous.  
 
Analysis 
The primary dimensions of heat transfer rate are energy/time. The primary dimensions of mass flow rate are 
mass/time, and those of specific heat are energy/masstemperature, as found in Problem 7-14. Thus each term in the 
equation can be written in terms of primary dimensions,

Indeed, all three additive terms have the same dimensions, namely {m1 L2 t-3}. 
 
Discussion 
We could also have left the temperature difference in parentheses as a temperature difference (same 
dimensions as the individual temperatures), and treated the equation as having only two terms.

Nondimensionalization of Equations 
 
 
7-28C 
Solution 
We are to give the primary reason for nondimensionalizing an equation.  
 
Analysis 
The primary reason for nondimensionalizing an equation is to reduce the number of parameters in the 
problem. 
 
Discussion 
As shown in the examples in the text, nondimensionalization of an equation reduces the number of 
independent parameters in the problem, simplifying the analysis. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
7-29 
Solution 
We are to nondimensionalize the equation, and identify the dimensionless parameters that appear in the 
nondimensionalized equation. 
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The flow is incompressible. 
 
Analysis 
We plug the nondimensionalized variables into the equation. For example, u = u*U and x = x*L in the first 
term. The result is

There are no nondimensional parameters in the nondimensionalized equation. The original equation comes from pure 
kinematics – there are no fluid properties involved in the equation, and therefore it is not surprising that no nondimensional 
parameters appear in the nondimensionalized form of the equation, Eq. 1.  
 
Discussion 
We show in Chap. 9 that the equation given in this problem is the differential equation for conservation of 
mass for an incompressible flow field – the incompressible continuity equation.

Solution 
We are to nondimensionalize the equation of motion and identify the dimensionless parameters that appear 
in the nondimensionalized equation. 
 
Analysis 
First, we must expand the first material derivative term since the nondimensionalization is not identical for 
the individual terms. Then we plug in the nondimensionalized variables. For example, u = u*V and x = x*L in the first term 
on the right. The result is

for an unsteady, compressible flow field – the general continuity equation. We may also use angular frequency  (radians 
per second) in place of physical frequency f (cycles per second), with the same result.

Dimensional Analysis and Similarity 
 
 
 
7-35C 
Solution 
We are to list the three primary purposes of dimensional analysis. 
 
Analysis 
The three primary purposes of dimensional analysis are: 
1. To generate nondimensional parameters that help in the design of experiments and in the reporting of 
experimental results. 
2. To obtain scaling laws so that prototype performance can be predicted from model performance. 
3. To (sometimes) predict trends in the relationship between parameters. 
 
Discussion 
Dimensional analysis is most useful for difficult problems that cannot be solved analytically. 
 
 
 
 
 
7-36C 
Solution 
We are to list and describe the three necessary conditions for complete similarity between a model and a 
prototype. 
 
Analysis 
The three necessary conditions for complete similarity between a model and a prototype are: 
1. Geometric similarity – the model must be the same shape as the prototype, but scaled by some constant scale 
factor. 
2. Kinematic similarity – the velocity at any point in the model flow must be proportional (by a constant scale 
factor) to the velocity at the corresponding point in the prototype flow. 
3. Dynamic similarity – all forces in the model flow scale by a constant factor to corresponding forces in the 
prototype flow. 
 
Discussion 
Complete similarity is achievable only when all three of the above similarity conditions are met. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
7-37 
Solution 
For a scale model of a submarine being tested in air, we are to calculate the wind tunnel speed required to 
achieve similarity with the prototype submarine that moves through water at a given speed.  
 
Assumptions 1 Compressibility of the air is assumed to be negligible. 2 The wind tunnel walls are far enough away so as 
to not interfere with the aerodynamic drag on the model sub. 3 The model is geometrically similar to the prototype. 
 
Properties 
For water at T = 15oC and atmospheric pressure,  = 999.1 kg/m3 and  = 1.138  10-3 kg/ms. For air at T = 
25oC and atmospheric pressure,  = 1.184 kg/m3 and  = 1.849  10-5 kg/ms. 
 
Analysis 
Similarity is achieved when the Reynolds number of the model is equal to that of the prototype,

Discussion 
At this air temperature, the speed of sound is around 346 m/s. Thus the Mach number in the wind tunnel is 
equal to 30.2/346 = 0.0873. This is sufficiently low that the incompressible flow approximation is reasonable.

At this air temperature, the speed of sound is around 346 m/s. Thus the Mach number in the wind tunnel is equal to 
145/346 = 0.419. The Mach number is sufficiently high that the incompressible flow approximation is not 
reasonable. The wind tunnel should be run at a flow speed at which the Mach number is less than one-third of the 
speed of sound. At this lower speed, the Reynolds number of the model will be too small, but the results may still be 
usable, either by extrapolation to higher Re, or if we are fortunate enough to have Reynold s number independence, 
as discussed in Section 7-5.  
 
Discussion 
It is also unlikely that a small instructional wind tunnel can achieve such a high speed.  
 
 
 
 
 
7-39 
Solution 
We are to estimate the drag on a prototype submarine in water, based on aerodynamic drag measurements 
performed in a wind tunnel.  
 
Assumptions 1 The model is geometrically similar. 2 The wind tunnel is run at conditions which ensure similarity 
between model and prototype. 
 
Properties 
For water at T = 15oC and atmospheric pressure,  = 999.1 kg/m3 and  = 1.138  10-3 kg/ms. For air at T = 
25oC and atmospheric pressure,  = 1.184 kg/m3 and  = 1.849  10-5 kg/ms. 
 
Analysis 
Since the Reynolds numbers have been matched, the nondimensionalized drag coefficient of the model 
equals that of the prototype,

Discussion 
Although the prototype moves at a much slower speed than the model, the density of water is much higher 
than that of air, and the prototype is eight times larger than the model. When all of these factors are combined, the drag 
force on the prototype is much larger than that on the model.

Solution 
For a prototype parachute and its model we are to calculate drag coefficient, and determine the wind tunnel 
speed that ensures dynamic similarity. Then we are to estimate the aerodynamic drag on the model. 
 
Assumptions 1 The model is geometrically similar to the prototype. 
 
Properties 
For air at 60oF and standard atmospheric pressure,  = 0.07633 lbm/ft3 and  = 1.213  10-5 lbm/fts. 
 
Analysis 
 (a) The aerodynamic drag on the prototype parachute is equal to the total weight. We can then easily 
calculate the drag coefficient CD,

Discussion 
We should check that the wind tunnel speed of Eq. 2 is not too high that the incompressibility 
approximation becomes invalid. The Mach number at this speed is about 216/1120 = 0.193. Since this is less than 0.3, 
compressibility is not an issue in this model test. The drag force on the model is quite large, and a fairly hefty drag balance 
must be available to measure such a large force. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
7-41 
Solution 
We are to discuss why one would pressurize a wind tunnel.  
 
Analysis 
As we see in some of the example problems and homework problems in this chapter, it is often difficult to 
achieve a high-enough wind tunnel speed to match the Reynolds number between a small model and a large prototype. 
Even if we were able to match the speed, the Mach number would often be too high. A pressurized wind tunnel has higher 
density air. At the same Reynolds number, the larger density leads to a lower air speed requirement. In other words, a 
pressurized wind tunnel can achieve higher Reynolds numbers for the same scale model. 
 
If the pressure were to be increased by a factor of 1.8, the air density would also go up by a factor of 1.8 (ideal gas 
law), assuming that the air temperature remains constant. Then the Reynolds number, Re = VL/, would go up by 
approximately 1.8. Note that we are also assuming that the viscosity does not change significantly with pressure, which is a 
reasonable assumption. 
 
Discussion 
The speed of sound is not a strong function of pressure, so Mach number is not affected significantly by 
pressurizing the wind tunnel. However, the power requirement for the wind tunnel blower increases significantly as air 
density is increased, so this must be taken into account when designing the wind tunnel.

7-42E 
Solution 
The concept of similarity will be utilized to determine the speed of the wind tunnel. 
 
Assumptions 1 Compressibility of the air is ignored (the validity of this assumption will be discussed later). 2 The wind 
tunnel walls are far enough away so as to not interfere with the aerodynamic drag on the model car. 3 The model is 
geometrically similar to the prototype. 4 Both the air in the wind tunnel and the air flowing over the prototype car are at 
standard atmospheric pressure. 
 
Properties 
For air at T = 25oC and atmospheric pressure,  = 1.184 kg/m3 and  = 1.849  10-5 kg/ms. 
 
Analysis 
Since there is only one independent  in this problem, similarity is achieved if 2,m = 2,p, where 2 is the 
Reynolds number. Thus, we can write

Thus, to ensure similarity, the wind tunnel should be run at 180 miles per hour (to three significant digits). 
 
Discussion 
This speed is quite high, and the wind tunnel may not be able to run at that speed. The Mach number is Ma 
= (180 mph)/(774 mph) = 0.23, so compressible effects can be reasonably ignored. We were never given the actual length 
of either car, but the ratio of Lp to Lm is known because the prototype is three times larger than the scale model. The 
problem statement contains a mixture of SI and English units, but it does not matter since we use ratios in the algebra.

where we have used the wind tunnel speed calculated in the previous problem. The predicted drag on the prototype car 
is 33.5 lbf (to three significant digits). 
 
Discussion 
Since the air properties of the wind tunnel are identical to those of the air flowing around the prototype car, 
it turns out that the aerodynamic drag force on the prototype is the same as that on the model. This would not be the case if 
the wind tunnel air were at a different temperature or pressure compared to that of the prototype.

Solution 
We are to discuss whether cold or hot air in a wind tunnel is better, and we are to support our answer by 
comparing air at two given temperatures.  
 
Properties 
For air at atmospheric pressure and at T = 10oC,  = 1.246 kg/m3 and  = 1.778  10-5 kg/ms. At T = 40oC, 
 = 1.127 kg/m3 and  = 1.918  10-5 kg/ms. 
 
Analysis 
As we see in some of the example problems and homework problems in this chapter, it is often difficult to 
achieve a high-enough wind tunnel speed to match the Reynolds number between a small model and a large prototype. 
Even if we were able to match the speed, the Mach number would often be too high. Cold air has higher density than warm 
air. In addition, the viscosity of cold air is lower than that of hot air. Thus, at the same Reynolds number, the colder air 
leads to a lower air speed requirement. In other words, a cold wind tunnel can achieve higher Reynolds numbers than 
can a hot wind tunnel for the same scale model, all else being equal. We support our conclusion by comparing air at two 
temperatures,

Thus we see that the colder wind tunnel can achieve approximately 19% higher Reynolds number, all else being 
equal. 
 
Discussion 
There are other issues however. First of all, the denser air of the cold wind tunnel is harder to pump – the 
cold wind tunnel may not be able to achieve the same wind speed as the hot wind tunnel. Furthermore, the speed of sound 
is proportional to the square root of temperature. Thus, at colder temperatures, the Mach number is higher than at warmer 
temperatures for the same value of V, and compressibility effects are therefore more significant at lower temperatures.

We are to calculate the speed and angular velocity (rpm) of a spinning baseball in a water channel such that 
flow conditions are dynamically similar to that of the actual baseball moving and spinning in air.

The water tunnel needs to be run at 5.63 mph, and the baseball needs to be spun at 21.2 rpm for dynamic similarity. 
 
Discussion 
Because of the difference in fluid properties between air and water, the required water tunnel speed is much 
lower than that in air. In addition, the spin rate is much lower, making flow visualization easier.

it angular speed or linear speed.

Solution 
We are to determine the dimensionless relationship between the given parameters  
 
Assumptions 1 The given parameters are the only relevant ones in the problem. 
 
Analysis 
The dimensional analysis is identical to the previous problem except that we add two additional 
independent parameters, both of which have dimensions of length. The two s of the previous problem remain. We get two 
additional s since n is now equal to 7 instead of 5. There is no need to go through all the algebra for the two additional s 
– since their dimensions match those of one of the repeating variables (D), we know that all the exponents in the  will be 
zero except the exponent for D, which will be –1. The two additional s are 
3 and 4:

We could also manipulate our s so that we have other length ratios like hsurface/Dtank, etc. Any such 
combination is acceptable.

Solution 
We are to use dimensional analysis to find the functional relationship between the given parameters, 
namely, energy E as a function of mass m and speed of light c. 
 
Assumptions 1 The given parameters are the only relevant ones in the problem. 
 
Analysis 
The step-by-step method of repeating variables is employed to obtain the nondimensional parameters.

This is clearly incorrect (we cannot have zero s). So we reduce j by one,

Solution 
We are to create a scale for volume flow rate and then define an appropriate Richardson number.  
 
Analysis 
By “back of the envelope” reasoning (or by inspection), we define a volume flow rate scale as L2V. Then 
the Richardson number can be defined as

Our result represents an interesting case of “luck”. Although we failed to include the ratio of specific heats k

Solution 
We are to use dimensional analysis to find a functional relationship between FD and variables V, L, and . 
 
Assumptions 1 We assume Re << 1 so that the creeping flow approximation applies. 2 Gravitational effects are irrelevant. 
3 No parameters other than those listed in the problem statement are relevant to the problem. 
 
Analysis 
We follow the step-by-step method of repeating variables.  
 
Step 1 There are four variables and constants in this problem; n = 4. They are listed in functional form, with the 
dependent variable listed as a function of the independent variables and constants:

Thus we have shown that for creeping flow around an object, the aerodynamic drag force is simply a constant multiplied by 
VL, regardless of the shape of the object. 
 
Discussion 
This result is very significant because all that is left to do is find the constant, which will be a function of 
the shape of the object (and its orientation with respect to the flow).

Solution 
We are to develop an equation for the settling speed of an aerosol particle falling in air under creeping flow 
conditions.  
 
Assumptions 1 The particle falls at steady speed V. 2 The Reynolds number is small enough that the creeping flow 
approximation is valid. 
 
Analysis 
We start by recognizing that as the particle falls at steady settling speed, its net weight W must equal the 
aerodynamic drag FD on the particle. We also know that W is proportional to (p - )gdp
3. Thus,

where we have converted the notation of the previous problem, and we have defined two different constants. The two

If we divide both sides of Eq. 2 by

 we see that the functional relationship given by Eq. 2 of the previous problem is 
consistent. 
 
Discussion 
This result is valid only if the Reynolds number is much smaller than one, as will be discussed in Chap. 10. 
If the particle is less dense than the fluid (e.g. bubbles rising in water), our result is still valid, but the particle rises instead 
of falls.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
7-64 
Solution 
We are to determine how the settling speed of an aerosol particle falling in air under creeping flow 
conditions changes when certain parameters are doubled.  
 
Assumptions 1 The particle falls at steady speed V. 2 The Reynolds number is small enough that the creeping flow 
approximation is valid. 
 
Analysis 
From the results of the previous problem, we see that if particle size doubles, the settling speed increases 
by a factor of 22 = 4. Similarly, if density difference doubles, the settling speed increases by a factor of 21 = 2. 
 
Discussion 
This result is valid only if the Reynolds number remains much smaller than unity, as will be discussed in 
Chap. 10. As the particle’s settling speed increases by a factor of 2 or 4, the Reynolds number will also increase by that 
same factor. If the new Reynolds number is not small enough, the creeping flow approximation will be invalid and our 
results will not be correct, although the error will probably be small.

Step 4 We need to choose three repeating parameters since j = 3. Following the guidelines listed in Table 7-3, we cannot 
pick the dependent variable, P. We cannot choose any two of parameters , L, and D since their dimensions are 
identical. It is not desirable to have  or  appear in all the s. The best choice of repeating parameters is thus V, D, and .

Discussion 
The result applies to both laminar and turbulent fully developed pipe flow; it turns out, however, that the 
second independent  (roughness ratio) is not nearly as important in laminar pipe flow as in turbulent pipe flow. Since P 
drops linearly with distance down the pipe, we know that P is linearly proportional to L/D. It is not possible to determine 
the functional relationships between the other s by dimensional reasoning alone.

We are to determine by what factor volume flow rate increases in the case of fully developed laminar pipe 
flow when pipe diameter is doubled.

does not change downstream.

Solution 
We are to use dimensional analysis to find the functional relationship between the given parameters, 
namely, damping coefficient  as a function of spring constant k, mass m, and damping coefficient c. 
 
Assumptions 1 The given parameters are the only relevant ones in the problem. 2  is already dimensionless. 
 
Analysis 
The step-by-step method of repeating variables is employed to obtain the nondimensional parameters (the 
s). In this situation,  is already dimensionless, and so it is automatically one of the s. We can therefore form the other 
 from the remaining three variables. Or, we can go through the normal procedure. We elect to show the full procedure 
below, but it is simpler to form a nondimensional parameter from variables k, m, and c.

Here we have the curious situation that the length dimension drops out, and so we have only two equations, but three 
unknown exponents. Thus there is a whole family of possible answers. In other words, we are free to choose any value of c1 
that we wish, and the other two coefficients can then be determined. For example, if we pick c1 = 1, then a1 = b1 = -1/2, and 
the  is thus

It turns out that the latter is more appropriate to match with standard dynamic system analysis. However, there is no way to 
know this from dimensional analysis alone. Jen must remember at least one other thing from her dynamic systems class – 
that the damping ratio increases with damping coefficient (which makes sense on physical grounds), and thus the latter 
equation for 1 makes the most physical sense. 
 
Step 6 Since there is only one , it must be a constant and we write the final functional relationship as

Discussion 
It turns out that the constant is ½, and the correct definition for  is

. Thus, our analysis yields 
the correct equation to within a constant. Note, however, that any other choice of exponent c1 is also valid from a purely 
dimensional point of view. For example, if we pick c1 = -2, then a1 = b1 = 1, and the result is simply the square of the 
previous result, i.e.,

In this case, since the number of variables is small, we were able to generate the exact form of Ohm’s law

Solution 
We are to use dimensional analysis to find the functional relationship between the given parameters. 
 
Assumptions 1 The given parameters are the only relevant ones in the problem. 
 
Analysis 
The step-by-step method of repeating variables is employed to obtain the nondimensional parameters (the 
s). 
 
Step 1 There are five parameters in this problem; n = 5,

Step 4 We need to choose three repeating parameters since j = 3. We pick length scale x, density , and freestream

Step 5 The s are generated. Note that for the first  we can do the algebra in our heads since the relationship is 
very simple. Namely, the dimensions of  are identical to those of one of the repeating variables (x). In such a case 
we know that all the exponents in the  group are zero except the one for x, which is –1. The dependent  is thus

Solution 
We are to repeat the previous problem, but with the fluid being a compressible gas rather than a liquid. 
 
Assumptions 1 The given parameters are the only ones relevant to the flow at hand. 2 The speed of sound in the gas is an 
additional relevant parameter. 
 
Analysis 
The method of repeating variables is employed to obtain the nondimensional parameters (the s). In this 
case, the key is to add speed of sound c to the list of independent variables since the fluid is compressible.

Solution 
We are to use dimensional analysis to find the functional relationship between the given parameters, 
namely, turbulent viscous dissipation rate  (rate of energy loss per unit mass) as a function of length scale  and velocity 
scale u of the large-scale turbulent eddies. 
 
Assumptions 1 The given parameters are the only relevant ones in the problem. 
 
Analysis 
The step-by-step method of repeating variables is employed to obtain the nondimensional parameters (the 
s).  
 
Step 1 There are three parameters in this problem; n = 3,

Discussion 
The constant cannot be obtained from dimensional analysis. Indeed, the constant is not really a constant 
at all, but depends on the specifics of the turbulent flow being examined. It is common in the study of turbulence to write

Experimental Testing and Incomplete Similarity 
 
 
 
 
7-78C 
Solution 
We are to discuss some situations in which a model should be larger than its prototype. 
 
Analysis 
There are many possible situations, and students’ examples should vary. Generally, any flow field that is 
very small and/or very fast benefits from simulation with a larger model. In most cases these are situations in which we 
want the model to be larger and slower so that experimental measurements and flow visualization are easier. Here are a few 
examples: 
 
 
Modeling a hard disk drive. 
 
Modeling insect flight. 
 
Modeling the settling of very small particles in air or water. 
 
Modeling the motion of water droplets in clouds. 
 
Modeling flow through very fine tubing. 
 
Modeling biological systems like blood flow through capillaries, flow in the bronchi of lungs, etc. 
 
Discussion 
You can think of several more examples. 
 
 
 
 
 
7-79C 
Solution 
We are to discuss the purpose of a moving ground belt 
and suggest an alternative. 
 
Analysis 
From the frame of reference of a moving car, both the air 
and the ground approach the car at freestream speed. When we test a 
model car in a wind tunnel, the air approaches at freestream speed, but 
the ground (floor of the wind tunnel) is stationary. Therefore we are not 
modeling the same flow. A boundary layer builds up on the wind tunnel 
floor, and the flow under the car cannot be expected to be the same as 
that under a real car. A moving ground belt solves this problem. Another 
way to say the same thing is to say that without the moving ground belt, 
there would not be kinematic similarity between the underside of the 
model and the underside of the prototype. 
 
If a moving ground belt is unavailable, we could instead install 
a false wall – i.e., a thin flat plate just above the boundary layer on 
the floor of the wind tunnel. A sketch is shown in Fig. 1. At least then 
the boundary layer will be very thin and will not have as much influence 
on the flow under the model. 
 
Discussion 
We discuss boundary layer growth in Chap. 10.

7-80C 
Solution 
We are to discuss whether Reynolds number independence has been achieved, and whether the researchers 
can be confident about it. 
 
Analysis 
We remove the last four data points from Table 7-7 and from Fig. 7-41. From the remaining data it appears 
that the drag coefficient is beginning to level off, but is still decreasing with Re. Thus, the researchers do not know if 
they have achieved Reynolds number independence or not. 
 
Discussion 
The wind tunnel speed is too low to achieve Reynolds number independence. 
 
 
 
 
 
7-81C 
Solution 
We are to define wind tunnel blockage and discuss its acceptable limit. We are also to discuss the source of 
measurement errors at high values of blockage. 
 
Analysis 
Wind tunnel blockage is defined as the ratio of model frontal area to cross-sectional area of the test-
section. The rule of thumb is that the blockage should be no more than 7.5%. If the blockage were significantly higher than 
this value, the flow would have to accelerate around the model much more than if the model were in an unbounded 
situation. Hence, similarity would not be achieved. We might expect the aerodynamic drag on the model to be too high 
since the effective freestream speed is too large due to the blockage. 
 
Discussion 
There are formulas to correct for wind tunnel blockage, but they become less and less reliable as blockage 
increases. 
 
 
 
 
 
7-82C 
Solution 
We are to discuss the rule of thumb concerning Mach number and incompressibility. 
 
Analysis 
The rule of thumb is that the Mach number must stay below about 0.3 in order for the flow field to be 
considered “incompressible”. What this really means is that compressibility effects, although present at all Mach 
numbers, are negligibly small compared to other effects driving the flow. If Ma is larger than about 0.3 in a wind tunnel 
test, the model flow field loses both kinematic and dynamic similarity, and the measured results are questionable. Of 
course, the error increases as Ma increases. 
 
Discussion 
Compressible flow is discussed in detail in Chap. 12. There you will see where the value 0.3 comes from.

determine if dynamic similarity and/or Reynolds number independence have been achieved. Finally, we are to estimate the 
aerodynamic drag force acting on the prototype car.  
 
Assumptions 1 The model car is geometrically similar to the prototype car. 2 The aerodynamic drag on the strut holding 
the model car is negligible. 
 
Properties 
For air at atmospheric pressure and at T = 25oC,  = 1.184 kg/m3 and  = 1.849  10-5 kg/(m s). 
 
Analysis 
We calculate CD and Re for the last data point listed in

where the width and speed of the prototype are used in the calculation of Rep. Comparison of Eqs. 1 and 2 reveals that the 
prototype Reynolds number is more than eight times larger than that of the model. Since we cannot match the independent 
s in the problem, dynamic similarity has not been achieved. 
 
Have we achieved Reynolds number independence? From Fig. 1 we see that Yes, Reynolds number 
independence has indeed been achieved – at Re greater than about 3  105, CD has leveled off to a value of about 0.32 (to 
two significant digits). 
 
Since we have achieved Reynolds number independence, we can extrapolate to the full scale prototype, assuming 
that CD remains constant as Re is increased to that of the full scale prototype.

Solution 
We are to nondimensionalize experimental pipe data, plot 
the data, and determine if Reynolds number independence has been 
achieved. We are then to extrapolate to a higher speed. 
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is fully developed. 2 The flow is steady and 
incompressible. 
 
Properties 
For water at T = 20oC and atmospheric pressure,  = 
998.0 kg/m3 and  = 1.002  10-3 kg/ms. 
 
Analysis 
(a) We convert each data point in the table from V and P 
to Reynolds number and Euler number. The calculations at the last 
(highest speed) data point are shown here:

We plot Eu versus Re in Fig. 1. Although there is experimental scatter in the data, it appears that Reynolds number 
independence has been achieved beyond a Reynolds number of about 2  106. The average value of Eu based on the last 6 
data points is 0.3042. 
 
(b) We extrapolate to higher speeds. At V = 80 m/s, we calculate P, assuming that Eu remains constant to higher values of

Solution 
We are to calculate the wind tunnel blockage of a model truck in a wind tunnel and determine if it is within 
acceptable limits. 
 
Assumptions 1 The frontal area is equal to truck width times height. (Note that the actual area of the truck may be 
somewhat smaller than this due to rounded corners and the air gap under the truck, but a truck looks nearly like a rectangle 
from the front, so this is not a bad approximation.) 
 
Analysis 
Wind tunnel blockage is defined as the ratio of model frontal area to cross-sectional area of the test-section,

The rule of thumb is that the blockage should be no more than 7.5%. Since we are well below this value, we need not worry 
about blockage effects.  
 
Discussion 
The length of the model does not enter our analysis since we are only concerned with the frontal area of the 
model. 
 
 
 
 
7-86E 
Solution 
We are to calculate the size and scale of the model truck to be constructed, and calculate its maximum 
Reynolds number. Then we are to determine whether this model in this wind tunnel will achieve Reynolds number 
independence.  
 
Assumptions 1 The model will be constructed carefully so as to achieve approximate geometric similarity. 2 The wind 
tunnel air is at the same temperature and pressure as that flowing over the prototype truck. 
 
Properties 
For air at T = 80oF and atmospheric pressure,  = 0.07350 lbm/ft3 and  = 1.248  10-5 lbm/fts. 
 
Analysis 
 (a) The rule of thumb about blockage is that we should keep the blockage below 7.5%. Thus, the frontal 
area of the model truck must be no more than 0.075  Awind tunnel. The ratio of height to width of the full-scale truck is Hp/Wp 
= 12/8.33 = 1.44. Thus, for the geometrically similar model truck,

(c) Based on the data of Fig. 7-41, this Reynolds number is shy of the value needed to achieve Reynolds number 
independence. 
 
Discussion 
The students should run at the highest wind tunnel speed. Their measured values of CD will probably be 
higher than those of the prototype, but the relative difference in CD due to their modifications should still be valid.

Solution 
We are to show that Froude number and Reynolds number are the dimensionless parameters that appear in a 
problem involving shallow water waves.  
 
Assumptions 1 Wave speed c is a function only of depth h, gravitational acceleration g, fluid density , and fluid 
viscosity .

7-89C 
Solution 
We are to think of and describe a prototype and model flow in which there is geometric but not kinematic 
similarity even though Rem = Rep.  
 
Analysis 
Students’ responses will vary. Here are some examples: 
 
 
A model car is being tested in a wind tunnel such that there is geometric similarity and the wind tunnel speed is 
adjusted so that Rem = Rep. However, there is not a moving ground belt, so there is not kinematic similarity 
between the model and prototype. 
 
A model airplane is being tested in a wind tunnel such that there is geometric similarity and the wind tunnel speed 
is adjusted so that Rem = Rep. However, the Mach numbers are quite different, and therefore kinematic similarity is 
not achieved. 
 
A model of a river or waterfall or other open surface flow problem in which there is geometric similarity and the 
speed is adjusted so that Rem = Rep. However, the Froude numbers do not match and therefore the velocity fields 
are not similar and kinematic similarity is not achieved. 
 
Discussion 
There are many more acceptable cases that students may imagine. 
 
 
 
 
7-90C 
Solution 
  
(a) False: Kinematic similarity is a necessary but not sufficient condition for dynamic similarity. 
(b) True: You cannot have dynamic similarity if the model and prototype are not geometrically similar. 
(c) True: You cannot have kinematic similarity if the model and prototype are not geometrically similar. 
(d) False: It is possible to have kinematic similarity (scaled velocities at corresponding points), yet not have dynamic 
similarity (forces do not scale at corresponding points).

since their dimensions differ only by a power. We also notice that we cannot choose F, L, and E since these three 
parameters can form a  all by themselves. So, we set j = 3 – 1 = 2, and we choose two repeating parameters, expecting

We are to generate dimensionless relationships among given parameters, and then we are to discuss how P 
decreases if the time is doubled. 
 
Assumptions 1 The given parameters are the only relevant ones in the problem.

Discussion 
The pressure rise across the blast wave decays rapidly with time (and with distance from the explosion). 
The speed of sound depends on temperature. If the explosion is of sufficient strength, T will increase significantly and c 
will not remain constant.

Solution 
We are to find an alternate definition of Archimedes number, and list it following the format of Table 7-5. 
Then we are to find an established  group that is similar. 
 
Analysis 
Students’ responses will vary. There seems to be a plethora of definitions of Archimedes number. Here is 
the one most appropriate for buoyant fluids: 
 
Name 
Definition 
Ratio of significance 
Archimedes 
number 
2
Ar
gL
V




 
buoyant force
inertial force
 
 
In the above,  is a characteristic density difference in the fluid (due to buoyancy) and  is a characteristic or average 
density of the fluid. A glance through Table 7-5 shows that the Richardson number is very similar to this alternative 
definition of Ar. In fact, the alternate form of Ri (Problem 7-55) is identical to our new Ar. 
 
Discussion 
Some students may find other definitions that are also valid. For example, / may be replaced by T/T.

Solution 
We are to generate a dimensionless relationship between the given parameters and then analyze the 
behavior of umax when an independent variable is doubled.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The flow is two-dimensional in the x-y plane. 3 The flow is fully developed. 
 
Analysis  
(a) A step-by-step dimensional analysis procedure could be performed. However, we notice that umax has 
the same dimensions as u. Therefore the algebra would be identical to that of the previous problem except that there is only 
one  instead of two since y is no longer a parameter. The result is

or 
Final relationship for umax:

(2) 
Alternatively, we can use the results of the previous problem directly. Namely, since we know that the maximum velocity 
occurs at the centerline, y/h = 1/2 there, and is a constant. Hence, Eq. 2 of the previous problem reduces to Eq. 1 of the 
present problem. 
 
(b) If h doubles, we see from Eq. 2 that umax will increase by a factor of 22 = 4. 
 
(c) If dP/dx doubles, we see from Eq. 2 that umax will increase by a factor of 21 = 2. 
 
(d) Since there is only one  in this problem, we would need to conduct only one experiment to determine the constant C in 
Eq. 2. 
 
Discussion 
The constant turns out to be -1/8, but there is no way to determine this from dimensional analysis alone. To 
obtain the constant, we would need to either do an experiment, or solve the problem exactly using the methods discussed in 
Chap. 9.

Solution 
We are to generate a relationship for Darcy friction factor f in terms of Euler number Eu. We are then to 
plot f as a function of Re and discuss whether Reynolds number independence has been achieved. 
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is fully developed. 2 The flow is steady and 
incompressible. 
 
Properties 
For water at T = 20oC and atmospheric pressure,  = 
998.0 kg/m3 and  = 1.002  10-3 kg/ms. 
 
Analysis 
(a) Since the flow is fully developed, the control volume 
cuts through two cross sections in which the velocity profiles are 
identical. The flow is also steady, so the control volume momentum 
equation in the horizontal (x) direction reduces to

(b) We use Eq. 5 to calculate f at each data point of Table P7-74. We plot f as a function of Re in Fig. 1. We see that the 
behavior of f mimics that of Eu (as it must because of Eq. 5 where we see that f is just a constant times Eu). Since 
Eu shows Reynolds number independence for Re greater than about 2  106, so does f. We see Reynolds number 
independence for Re greater than about 2  106. From the plot, the extrapolated value of f at large Re is about 
0.04867, which agrees with Eq. 5 when we plug in the Re-independent value of Eu,

Solution 
We are to create characteristic scales so that we can define a desired established dimensionless parameter.  
 
Analysis 
 (a) For Froude number we need a velocity scale, a length scale, and gravity. We already have a length 
scale and gravity. We create a velocity scale as 
/ L

(b) For Reynolds number we need a velocity scale, a length scale, and kinematic viscosity. Of these we only have the 
kinematic viscosity, so we need to create a velocity scale and a length scale. After a “back of the envelope” analysis, we 
create a velocity scale as

Note that in this case, the length scales drop out, so it doesn’t matter that we could not define a length scale from the given 
parameters. 
 
(c) For Richardson number we need a length scale, the gravitational constant, a volume flow rate, a density, and a density 
difference. Of these we have all but the volume flow rate, so we create a volume flow rate scale as

Solution 
We are to calculate the temperature of water in a model test to ensure similarity with the prototype, and we 
are to predict the time required to empty the prototype tank.  
 
Assumptions 1 The parameters specified in the previous problem are the only parameters relevant to the problem. 2 The 
model and prototype are geometrically similar.

Since the model and prototype are geometrically similar, (d/h)model = (d/h)prototype and (D/h)model = (D/h)prototype. Thus, we are 
left with only one  to match to ensure similarity. Namely, the Reynolds number parameter in Eq. 1 must be matched 
between model and prototype. Since g remains the same in either case, and using “m” for model and “p” for prototype,

Solution 
For the simplified case in which V depends only on h and g, we are to determine how V increases when h is 
doubled. 
 
Assumptions 1 The given parameters are the only ones relevant to the problem. 
 
Analysis 
We employ the dimensional analysis results of Problem 7-90. Dropping d, D, , and  from the list of 
parameters, we are left with n = 3,

Solution 
We are to compare the primary dimensions of each given property in mass-based and force-based primary 
dimensions, and discuss.  
 
Analysis 
From previous problems and examples in this chapter, we can write down the primary dimensions of each 
property in the mass-based system. We use the fundamental definitions of these quantities to generate the primary 
dimensions in the force-based system: 
 
(a) For pressure P the primary dimensions are

We see that (in these three examples anyway), the forced-base cases have only two primary dimensions represented (F and 
L), whereas the mass-based cases have three primary dimensions represented (m, L, and t). Some authors would prefer the 
force-based system because of its reduced complexity when dealing with forces, pressures, energies, etc.  
 
Discussion 
Not all variables have a simpler form in the force-based system. Mass itself for example has primary 
dimensions of {m} in the mass-based system, but has primary dimensions of {Ft2/L} in the force-based system. In 
problems involving mass, mass flow rates, and/or density, the force-based system may not have any advantage.

be identical to that of Problem 7-56 except that the top plate speed would be (Vtop – Vbottom) instead of just V. The step-by-

We are to determine the primary dimensions of electrical capacitance.

Solution 
We are to determine the primary dimensions of electrical time constant RC, and discuss the significance of 
our result.

The primary dimensions of electrical resistance are obtained from Problem 7-11. Those of electrical

swap places we would have a high-pass rather than a low-pass filter.

Solution 
We are to determine the primary dimensions of both sides of the equation, and we are to verify that the 
equation is dimensionally homogeneous.  
 
Analysis 
The primary dimensions of the time derivative (d/dt) are 1/time. The primary dimensions of capacitance are

Thus, if we double the electric field strength, the drift velocity will increase by a factor of 2. 
 
(c) Also from Eq. 3 we see that if we double the particle size, the drift velocity will decrease by a factor of 2. 
 
Discussion 
These results agree with our intuition. Certainly we would expect the drift velocity to increase if we 
increase the field strength. Also, larger particles have more aerodynamic drag, so for the same charge, we would expect a 
larger dust particle to drift more slowly than a smaller dust particle.

thus V1, , and one of the length scales. We choose A1.

From Table 7-5, the established nondimensional parameter most similar to our 1 is a kind of force coefficient

often placed in the denominator in parameters like this.

We form the third  with . By now we know that we will generate a type of Reynolds number. Here, since we 
chose area A1 instead of a length, the length scale in our Reynolds number is the square root of A1.

Solution 
We are to generate a dimensionless functional relationship between the given parameters and then compare 
our results with a known exact analytical solution.  
 
Assumptions 1 There is no flow (hydrostatics). 2 The parameters listed here are the only relevant parameters in the 
problem. 
 
Analysis 
 (a) We perform a dimensional analysis using the method of repeating variables. 
 
Step 1 There are five parameters in this problem; n = 6,

Note that the dimensions of the contact angle are unity (angles are dimensionless). 
 
Step 3 As a first guess, j is set equal to 3, the number of primary dimensions represented in the problem (m, L, and t).

If this value of j is correct, the expected number of s is

Step 4 We need to choose three repeating parameters since j = 3. We cannot choose  since it is dimensionless. We 
choose a length (D) and a density (). We’d rather have gravitational constant g than surface tension s in our s. So, we 
choose 
Repeating parameters: 
, g, D 
 
 
Step 5 The dependent  is generated. Since h has the same dimensions as D, we immediately write

is no fluid motion.

Solution 
We are to find a functional relationship for the time scale required for the liquid to climb up the capillary 
tube. 
 
Assumptions 1 trise is a function of the same parameters listed in the previous problem, but there is another relevant 
parameter. 
 
Analysis 
Since this is an unsteady problem, the rise time will surely depend also on fluid viscosity . The list of 
parameters now involves seven parameters,

Solution 
We are to use dimensional analysis to find the functional relationship between the given parameters. 
 
Assumptions 1 The given parameters are the only relevant ones in the problem. 
 
Analysis 
The step-by-step method of repeating variables is employed to obtain the nondimensional parameters (the 
s).

Step 4 We need to choose three repeating parameters since j = 3. The problem is that the three independent parameters 
form a  all by themselves (c2/P is dimensionless). Let’s see what happens if we don’t notice this, and we pick all three 
independent parameters as repeating variables,

This is a situation in which two of the equations agree, but we cannot solve for unique exponents. If we knew b, we could 
get a and c. The problem is that any value of b we choose will make the  dimensionless. For example, if we choose b = 1, 
we find that a = –2 and c = 1, yielding

However, if we choose a different value of b, say b = –1, then a = 0 and c = –3, yielding

Similarly, you can come up with a whole family of possible answers, depending on your choice of b. We double check our 
algebra and realize that any value of b works. Hence the problem is indeterminate with three repeating variables. 
 
We go back now and realize that something is wrong. As stated previously, the problem is that the three 
independent parameters can form a dimensionless group all by themselves. This is another case where we have to reduce j 
by 1. Setting j = 3 – 1 = 2, we choose two repeating parameters,

Solution 
We are to find the dimensionless relationship between the given parameters.  
 
Assumptions 1 The given parameters are the only relevant ones in the problem.

Discussion 
This is an interesting case in which we added another independent parameter (r), yet this new parameter 
does not even appear in the final functional relationship! The list of independent parameters is thus over specified. (It turns 
out that P is a function of r, so r is not needed in the problem.) The result here is identical to the result of the previous 
problem. It turns out that the function in Eq. 2 is a constant times 2
2, which yields the correct analytical equation for I, 
namely

Solution 
We are to calculate the speed of a robotic tuna to match the Reynolds number of a real tuna. 
 
Assumptions 1 The fluid in the model and prototype tests is the same (seawater) so that fluid properties such as density 
and viscosity do not change from model to prototype.

Solution 
The pressure difference between the inside of a soap bubble and the outside air is to be analyzed with 
dimensional analysis and the method of repeating variables using the force-based system of primary dimensions. 
 
Assumptions 1 The soap bubble is neutrally buoyant in the air, and gravity is not relevant. 2 No other variables or 
constants are important in this problem. 
 
Analysis 
The step-by-step method of repeating variables is employed.

From Table 7-5, the established nondimensional parameter most similar to Eq. 2 is the Weber number, defined as a 
pressure times a length divided by surface tension. There is no need to further manipulate this . 
 
Step 6 We now write the functional relationship between the nondimensional parameters. Since there is only one , it is a 
function of nothing, which means it must be a constant,

The result using force-based primary dimensions is indeed identical to the previous result using the mass-based system.  
 
Discussion 
Because only two primary dimensions are represented in the problem when using the force-based system, 
the algebra is in fact a lot easier.

Thus, if we double the size of the cyclone, the pressure drop will decrease by a factor of 24 = 16 (Answer: The pressure 
drop will change by a factor of 1/16.). 
 
(c) Also from Eq. 3 we see that if we double the volume flow rate, the pressure drop will increase by a factor of 22 = 4 
(Answer: The pressure drop will change by a factor of 4.). 
 
Discussion 
The pressure drop would be smallest for the largest cyclone operating at the smallest volume flow rate. 
(This agrees with our intuition.)

Laminar and Turbulent Flow 
 
 
 
8-1C  
Solution 
We are to compare pipe flow in air and water.  
 
Analysis 
Reynolds number is inversely proportional to kinematic viscosity, which is much smaller for water than for 
air (at 25C, air = 1.56210-5 m2/s and water =   = 0.89110-3/997 = 8.910-7 m2/s). Therefore, for the same diameter and 
speed, the Reynolds number will be higher for water flow, and thus the flow is more likely to be turbulent for water. 
 
Discussion 
The actual viscosity (dynamic viscosity)  is larger for water than for air, but the density of water is so 
much greater than that of air that the kinematic viscosity of water ends up being smaller than that of air. 
 
 
 
 
8-2C  
Solution 
We are to compare the wall shear stress at the inlet and outlet of a pipe.  
 
Analysis 
The wall shear stress w is highest at the tube inlet where the thickness of the boundary layer is nearly 
zero, and decreases gradually to the fully developed value. The same is true for turbulent flow. 
 
Discussion 
We are assuming that the entrance is well-rounded so that the inlet flow is nearly uniform. 
 
 
 
 
8-3C  
Solution 
We are to define and discuss hydraulic diameter.  
 
Analysis 
For flow through non-circular tubes, the Reynolds number and the friction factor are based on the hydraulic 
diameter Dh defined as

 where Ac is the cross-sectional area of the tube and p is its perimeter. The hydraulic

8-4C  
Solution 
We are to define and discuss hydrodynamic entry length.  
 
Analysis 
The region from the tube inlet to the point at which the boundary layer merges at the centerline is 
called the hydrodynamic entrance region, and the length of this region is called hydrodynamic entry length. The entry 
length is much longer in laminar flow than it is in turbulent flow. But at very low Reynolds numbers, Lh is very small 
(e.g., Lh = 1.2D at Re = 20). 
 
Discussion 
The entry length increases with increasing Reynolds number, but there is a significant change in entry 
length when the flow changes from laminar to turbulent. 
 
 
 
 
8-5C  
Solution 
We are to discuss why pipes are usually circular in cross section.  
 
Analysis 
Liquids are usually transported in circular pipes because pipes with a circular cross section can withstand 
large pressure differences between the inside and the outside without undergoing any significant distortion. 
 
Discussion 
Piping for gases at low pressure are often non-circular (e.g., air conditioning and heating ducts in buildings). 
 
 
 
 
8-6C  
Solution 
We are to define and discuss Reynolds number for pipe and duct flow.  
 
Analysis 
Reynolds number is the ratio of the inertial forces to viscous forces, and it serves as a criterion for 
determining the flow regime. At large Reynolds numbers, for example, the flow is turbulent since the inertia forces are 
large relative to the viscous forces, and thus the viscous forces cannot prevent the random and rapid fluctuations of the 
fluid. It is defined as follows: 
(a) For flow in a circular tube of inner diameter D:  


Discussion 
Since pipe flows become fully developed far enough downstream, diameter is the 
appropriate length scale for the Reynolds number. In boundary layer flows, however, the boundary layer 
grows continually downstream, and therefore downstream distance is a more appropriate length scale.

Solution 
We are to compare the Reynolds number in air and water.  
 
Analysis 
Reynolds number is inversely proportional to kinematic viscosity, which is much smaller for water than for 
air (at 25C, air = 1.56210-5 m2/s and water =   = 0.89110-3/997 = 8.910-7 m2/s). Therefore, noting that Re = VD/, 
the Reynolds number is higher for motion in water for the same diameter and speed. 
 
Discussion 
Of course, it is not possible to walk as fast in water as in air – try it!

Solution 
We are to compare the pumping requirement for water and oil.  
 
Analysis 
Engine oil requires a larger pump because of its much larger viscosity. 
 
Discussion 
The density of oil is actually 10 to 15% smaller than that of water, and this makes the pumping requirement 
smaller for oil than water. However, the viscosity of oil is orders of magnitude larger than that of water, and is therefore the 
dominant factor in this comparison. 
 
 
 
 
8-10C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the Reynolds number for transition from laminar to turbulent flow.  
 
Analysis 
The generally accepted value of the Reynolds number above which the flow in a smooth pipe is turbulent is 
4000. In the range 2300 < Re < 4000, the flow is typically transitional between laminar and turbulent. 
 
Discussion 
In actual practice, pipe flow may become turbulent at Re lower or higher than this value.

8-11C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the effect of surface roughness on pressure drop in pipe flow.  
 
Analysis 
In turbulent flow, tubes with rough surfaces have much higher friction factors than the tubes with smooth 
surfaces, and thus surface roughness leads to a much larger pressure drop in turbulent pipe flow. In the case of 
laminar flow, the effect of surface roughness on the friction factor and pressure drop is negligible. 
 
Discussion 
The effect of roughness on pressure drop is significant for turbulent flow, as seen in the Moody chart. 
 
 
 
 
 
8-12E   
Solution 
We are to estimate the Reynolds number for flow through a 
pipe, and determine if it is laminar or turbulent.  
 
Assumptions 1 The water is at 20oC. 2 The discharge area is perfectly 
round (we ignore the rim effects – there appear to be some protrusions 
around the rim – three of them are visible in the picture). 
 
Properties 
The density and viscosity of the water are  = 62.30 lbm/ft3, 
and  = 6.733  10-4 lbm/fts, respectively. 
 
Analysis 
We use the people to estimate the diameter of the pipe. 
Assuming the guy in the blue shirt (who by the way is Secretary of the 
Interior Dirk Kempthorne) is six feet tall, the pipe diameter is about 13.8 ft. 
The average velocity is obtained from the given volume flow rate,

where we give our final result to two significant digits. Since Re > 2300, this flow is definitely turbulent.

fluctuations in the photograph.

Fully Developed Flow in Pipes 
 
 
 
8-13C  
Solution 
We are to examine a claim about volume flow rate in laminar pipe flow.  
 
Analysis 
Yes, the volume flow rate in a circular pipe with laminar flow can be determined by measuring the velocity 
at the centerline in the fully developed region, multiplying it by the cross-sectional area, and dividing the result by 2. This 
works for fully developed laminar pipe flow in round pipes since

Discussion 
This is not true for turbulent flow, so one must be careful that the flow is laminar before trusting this

8-14C  
Solution 
We are to examine a claim about volume flow rate in laminar pipe flow.   
 
Analysis 
No, the average velocity in a circular pipe in fully developed laminar flow cannot be determined by simply 
measuring the velocity at R/2 (midway between the wall surface and the centerline). The average velocity is Vmax/2, but the 
velocity at R/2 is

Discussion 
There is, of course, a radial location in the pipe at which the local velocity is equal to the average velocity. 
Can you find that location? 
 
 
 
 
 
8-15C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the value of shear stress at the center of a pipe.  
 
Analysis 
The shear stress at the center of a circular tube during fully developed laminar flow is zero since the 
shear stress is proportional to the velocity gradient, which is zero at the tube center.  
 
Discussion 
This result is due to the axisymmetry of the velocity profile.

8-16C  
Solution 
We are to discuss whether the maximum shear stress in a turbulent pipe flow occurs at the wall.  
 
Analysis 
Yes, the shear stress at the surface of a tube during fully developed turbulent flow is maximum since 
the shear stress is proportional to the velocity gradient, which is maximum at the tube surface. 
 
Discussion 
This result is also true for laminar flow. 
 
 
 
 
 
8-17C  
Solution 
We are to discuss how the wall shear stress varies along the flow direction in a pipe.  
 
Analysis 
The wall shear stress w remains constant along the flow direction in the fully developed region in both 
laminar and turbulent flow. 
 
Discussion 
However, in the entrance region, w starts out large, and decreases until the flow becomes fully developed. 
 
 
 
 
 
8-18C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the fluid property responsible for development of a velocity boundary layer.  
 
Analysis 
The fluid viscosity is responsible for the development of the velocity boundary layer. 
 
Discussion 
You can think of it this way: As the flow moves downstream, more and more of it gets slowed down near 
the wall due to friction, which is due to viscosity in the fluid. 
 
 
 
 
 
8-19C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the velocity profile in fully developed pipe flow.  
 
Analysis 
In the fully developed region of flow in a circular pipe, the velocity profile does not change in the flow 
direction. 
 
Discussion 
This is, in fact, the definition of fully developed – namely, the velocity profile remains of constant shape.

Solution

The friction factor for flow in a tube is proportional to the pressure loss. Since the pressure loss along 
the flow is directly related to the power requirements of the pump to maintain flow, the friction factor is also proportional 
to the power requirements to overcome friction. The applicable relations are

Discussion 
This type of pressure loss due to friction is an irreversible loss. Hence, it is always positive (positive being 
defined as a pressure drop down the pipe). A negative pressure loss would violate the second law of thermodynamics. 
 
 
 
 
 
8-21C 
Solution 
We are to discuss whether fully developed pipe flow is one-, two-, or three-dimensional.  
 
Analysis 
The geometry is axisymmetric, which is two-dimensional. However, since the velocity profile does not 
change down the pipe axis, u is a function only of r, and thus the velocity is one-dimensional with respect to radial 
coordinate r. Pressure, on the other hand, varies only with axial location x in fully developed pipe flow (ignoring the 
hydrostatic pressure component, which acts independently of the flow component). So, the pressure is one-dimensional 
with respect to axial coordinate x. 
 
Discussion 
In the developing portion of the flow, u varies with x as well as with r, and thus the flow is two-dimensional 
in the developing region. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
8-22C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the change in head loss when the pipe length is doubled.  
 
Analysis 
In fully developed flow in a circular pipe with negligible entrance effects, if the length of the pipe is 
doubled, the head loss also doubles (the head loss is proportional to pipe length in the fully developed region of flow). 
 
Discussion 
If entrance lengths are not negligible, the head loss in the longer pipe would be less than twice that of the 
shorter pipe, since the shear stress is larger in the entrance region than in the fully developed region.

Therefore, at constant flow rate and pipe length, the head loss is inversely proportional to the 4th power of diameter, and 
thus reducing the pipe diameter by half increases the head loss by a factor of 16. 
 
Discussion 
This is a very significant increase in head loss, and shows why larger diameter tubes lead to much smaller 
pumping power requirements. 
 
 
 
 
 
8-24C  
Solution 
We are to explain why friction factor is independent of Re at very large Re.  
 
Analysis 
At very large Reynolds numbers, the flow is fully rough and the friction factor is independent of the 
Reynolds number. This is because the thickness of viscous sublayer decreases with increasing Reynolds number, and it 
be comes so thin that the surface roughness protrudes into the flow. The viscous effects in this case are produced in the 
main flow primarily by the protruding roughness elements, and the contribution of the viscous sublayer is negligible. 
 
Discussion 
This effect is clearly seen in the Moody chart – at large Re, the curves flatten out horizontally. 
 
 
 
 
 
8-25C  
Solution 
We are to define and discuss turbulent viscosity.  
 
Analysis 
Turbulent viscosity t is caused by turbulent eddies, and it accounts for momentum transport by 
turbulent eddies. It is expressed as

 where u  is the mean value of velocity in the flow direction and 
uand uare the fluctuating components of velocity. 
 
Discussion 
Turbulent viscosity is a derived, or non-physical quantity. Unlike the viscosity, it is not a property of the 
fluid; rather, it is a property of the flow.

. Therefore, the constant 0.0826 is not dimensionless. This is not a dimensionally homogeneous 
equation, and it cannot be used in any consistent set of units. 
 
Discussion 
Engineers often create dimensionally inhomogeneous equations like this. While they are useful for 
practicing engineers, they are valid only when the proper units are used for each variable, and this can occasionally lead to 
mistakes. For this reason, the present authors do not encourage their use.

Solution 
We are to discuss the change in head loss due to a decrease in viscosity by a factor of two.

When the flow rate and thus the average velocity are held constant, the head loss becomes proportional to viscosity. 
Therefore, the head loss is reduced by half when the viscosity of the fluid is reduced by half. 
 
Discussion 
This result is not valid for turbulent flow – only for laminar flow. It is also not valid for laminar flow in 
situations where the entrance length effects are not negligible. 
 
 
 
 
 
8-28C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the relationship between head loss and pressure drop in pipe flow.  
 
Analysis 
The head loss is related to pressure loss by



. For a given fluid, the head loss can be converted 
to pressure loss by multiplying the head loss by the acceleration of gravity and the density of the fluid. Thus, for constant 
density, head loss and pressure drop are linearly proportional to each other. 
 
Discussion 
This result is true for both laminar and turbulent pipe flow.

Solution 
We are to discuss if the friction factor is zero for laminar pipe flow with a perfectly smooth surface.  
 
Analysis 
During laminar flow of air in a circular pipe with perfectly smooth surfaces, the friction factor is not zero 
because of the no-slip boundary condition, which must hold even for perfectly smooth surfaces.  
 
Discussion 
If we compare the friction factor for rough and smooth surfaces, roughness has no effect on friction factor 
for fully developed laminar pipe flow unless the roughness height is very large. For turbulent pipe flow, however, 
roughness very strongly impacts the friction factor. 
 
 
 
 
 
8-30C  
Solution 
We are to discuss why the friction factor is higher in turbulent pipe flow compared to laminar pipe flow.  
Analysis 
In turbulent flow, it is the turbulent eddies due to enhanced mixing that cause the friction factor to be 
larger. This turbulent mixing leads to a much larger wall shear stress, which translates into larger friction factor. 
Discussion 
Another way to think of it is that the turbulent eddies cause the turbulent velocity profile to be much fuller 
(closer to uniform flow) than the laminar velocity profile. 
 
 
 
 
 
8-31 
Solution 
The velocity profile for the flow of a fluid between two large parallel plates is given. A relation for the flow 
rate through the plates is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible.

Solution 
The average flow velocity in a pipe is given. The pressure drop, the head loss, and the pumping power are 
to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The entrance effects are negligible, and thus the flow is fully 
developed. 3 The pipe involves no components such as bends, valves, and connectors. 4 The piping section involves no 
work devices such as pumps and turbines. 
Properties 
The density and dynamic viscosity of water are given to be  = 999.7 kg/m3 and  = 1.30710-3 kg/ms, 
respectively.

Therefore, power input in the amount of 0.399 W is needed to overcome the frictional losses in the flow due to viscosity.

would be much greater.

This is a set of 4 equations in 4 unknowns, and solving them with an equation solver gives 
 
 
D = 0.88 ft,     f = 0.0181,  V = 19.8 ft/s,  and   Re = 96,040 
 
Therefore, the diameter of the duct should be more than 0.88 ft if the head loss is not to exceed 50 ft. Note that Re > 4000, 
and thus the turbulent flow assumption is verified. 
 
The diameter can also be determined directly from the third Swamee-Jain formula to be

Solution 
The flow rate through a specified water pipe is given. The pressure drop, the head loss, and the pumping 
power requirements are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The entrance effects are negligible, and thus the flow is fully 
developed. 3 The pipe involves no components such as bends, valves, and connectors. 4 The piping section involves no 
work devices such as pumps and turbines. 
Properties 
The density and dynamic viscosity of water are given to be  = 999.1 kg/m3 and  = 1.13810-3 kg/ms, 
respectively. The roughness of stainless steel is 0.002 mm.

First we calculate the average velocity and the Reynolds number to determine the flow regime:

Therefore, useful power input in the amount of 0.904 kW is needed to overcome the frictional losses in the pipe. 
Discussion 
The friction factor could also be determined easily from the explicit Haaland relation. It would give f = 
0.01574, which is sufficiently close to 0.01594. Also, the friction factor corresponding to  = 0 in this case is 0.01562, 
which indicates that stainless steel pipes in this case can be assumed to be smooth with an error of about 2%.  Also, the 
power input determined is the mechanical power that needs to be imparted to the fluid. The shaft power will be more than 
this due to pump inefficiency; the electrical power input will be even more due to motor inefficiency.

For fully rough flow in a rough pipe, the friction factor is independent of the Reynolds 
number and thus the flow velocity. Therefore, the head loss increases by a factor of 4 
in this case since

and thus the head loss is proportional to the square of the average velocity when f, L, and D are constant. 
 
Discussion 
Most flows in practice are in the fully rough regime, and thus the head loss is generally assumed to be 
proportional to the square of the average velocity for all kinds of turbulent flow. Note that we use diameter D here in place 
of hydraulic diameter Dh. For a square duct, it turns out that Dh = D, so this is a valid approximation.

Solution 
Air enters a rectangular duct. The fan power needed to overcome the pressure losses is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The entrance effects are negligible, and thus the flow is fully

Discussion 
The friction factor could also be determined easily from the explicit Haaland relation. It would give f = 
0.02008, which is reasonably close to 0.02037. Also, the power input determined is the mechanical power that needs to be 
imparted to the fluid. The shaft power will be much more than this due to fan inefficiency; the electrical power input will be 
even more due to motor inefficiency.

Solution 
Water passes through copper tubes at a specified rate. The pumping power required per ft length to maintain 
flow is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The entrance effects are negligible, and thus the flow is fully 
developed. 3 The pipe involves no components such as bends, valves, and connectors. 4 The piping section involves no 
work devices such as pumps and turbines.  
Properties 
The density and dynamic viscosity of water at 70F are  = 62.30 lbm/ft3 and  = 6.55610-4 lbm/fts. The 
roughness of copper tubing is 510-6 ft. 
Analysis 
First we calculate the average velocity and the Reynolds number to determine the flow regime:

Therefore, useful power input in the amount of 0.0320 W is needed per ft of tube length to overcome the frictional losses in

Discussion 
The friction factor could also be determined easily from the explicit Haaland relation. It would give f = 
0.02757, which is sufficiently close to 0.02771. Also, the friction factor corresponding to  = 0 in this case is 0.02756, 
which indicates that copper pipes can be assumed to be smooth with a negligible error. Also, the power input determined is 
the mechanical power that needs to be imparted to the fluid. The shaft power will be more than this due to pump 
inefficiency; the electrical power input will be even more due to motor inefficiency.

Solution 
The pressure of oil in a pipe which discharges into the atmosphere is measured at a certain location. The 
flow rates are to be determined for 3 different orientations. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The entrance effects are negligible, and thus the flow is fully 
developed. 3 The flow is laminar (to be verified). 4 The pipe involves no components such as bends, valves, and 
connectors. 5 The piping section involves no work devices such as pumps and turbines. 
Properties 
The density and dynamic viscosity of oil are given to be  = 876 kg/m3 and  = 0.24 kg/ms.

which is less than 2300. Therefore, the flow is laminar for all three cases, and the analysis above is valid. 
Discussion 
Note that the flow is driven by the combined effect of pressure difference and gravity. As can be seen from 
the calculated rates above, gravity opposes uphill flow, but helps downhill flow. Gravity has no effect on the flow rate in 
the horizontal case.

Solution 
Glycerin is flowing through a horizontal pipe which discharges into the atmosphere at a specified flow rate. 
The absolute pressure at a specified location in the pipe, and the angle  that the pipe must be inclined downwards for the 
pressure in the entire pipe to be atmospheric pressure are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The entrance effects are negligible, and thus the flow is fully 
developed. 3 The flow is laminar (to be verified). 4 The pipe involves no components such as bends, valves, and 
connectors. 5 The piping section involves no work devices such as pumps and turbines. 
Properties 
The density and dynamic viscosity of glycerin at 40°C are given to be  = 1252 kg/m3 and  = 0.27 kg/ms.

Discussion 
Note that the flow is driven by the combined effect of pressure difference and gravity.  Gravity has no effect 
on the flow rate in the horizontal case, but it governs the flow alone when there is no pressure difference across the pipe.

Solution 
Air is flowing through a square duct made of commercial steel at a specified rate. The pressure drop and 
head loss per ft of duct are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The entrance effects are negligible, and thus the flow is fully 
developed. 3 Air is an ideal gas. 4 The duct involves no components such as bends, valves, and connectors. 5 The flow 
section involves no work devices such as fans or turbines. 
Properties 
The density and dynamic viscosity of air at 1 atm and 60F are  = 0.07633 lbm/ft3,  = 0.04365 lbm/fth, 
and  = 0.5718 ft2/s = 1.58810-4 ft2/s. The roughness of commercial steel surfaces is  = 0.00015 ft.

Therefore, 0.525 W of mechanical power needs to be imparted to the fluid per ft length of the duct. The shaft power will be 
more than this due to fan inefficiency; the electrical power input will be even more due to motor inefficiency. Also, the 
friction factor could be determined easily from the explicit Haaland relation. It would give f = 0.01697, which is sufficiently 
close to 0.01721.

Solution 
Oil is being discharged by a horizontal pipe from a storage tank open to the atmosphere. The flow rate of oil 
through the pipe is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The entrance effects are negligible, and thus the flow is fully 
developed. 3 The entrance and exit loses are negligible. 4 The flow is laminar (to be verified). 5 The pipe involves no 
components such as bends, valves, and connectors. 6 The piping section involves no work devices such as pumps and 
turbines. 
Properties 
The density and kinematic viscosity of oil are given to be  = 850 kg/m3 and  = 0.00062 m2/s, respectively. 
The dynamic viscosity is calculated to be

Analysis 
We solve the problem two ways for comparison. 
 
Method 1 – First, the more rigorous way, using the energy equation: We take a 
control volume with the surface of the oil tank as the inlet (1), and the pipe 
discharge as the outlet (2), as sketched. The energy equation in head form from 1 
to 2 (see Chapter 5) is

but for our control volume, P1 =  P2 =Patm, so the pressure terms cancel. Also, V1 is negligibly small compared to V2 since 
the tank is so large compared to the pipe. Also, there are no turbines or pumps in the flow. Thus, the energy equation 
reduces to

(1) 
The kinetic energy correction factor and the equation for the head loss term both depend on whether the flow in the pipe is 
laminar or turbulent. We assume one or the other, and then verify at the end whether our assumption was correct. Since the 
fluid is very viscous and the diameter is small, we assume laminar flow, for which 2 = 2 if the flow is fully developed at 
the end of the pipe. Also, for fully developed laminar pipe flow, the Darcy friction factor is 64/Re, and therefore the 
irreversible head loss is

Since this Reynolds number is much lower than 2300, we are confident that the flow is laminar, and thus the analysis is 
correct. 
 
Method 2 – We re-solve the problem making the assumption that since the velocity through the pipe is so small, the 
pressure at the pipe entrance is nearly the same as the hydrostatic pressure at that location. The pressure at the bottom of the

which is less than 2300. Therefore, the flow is laminar and the analysis above is valid. 
 
Discussion 
The flow rate will be somewhat less when the inlet and outlet losses are considered, especially when the 
inlet is not well-rounded. The two methods give the same answer to four significant digits. This justifies the assumption 
made in the second method.

Solution 
Air in a heating system is distributed through a rectangular duct made of commercial steel at a specified  
rate. The pressure drop and head loss through a section of the duct are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The entrance effects are negligible, and thus the flow is fully 
developed. 3 Air is an ideal gas.  4 The duct involves no components such as bends, valves, and connectors. 5 The flow 
section involves no work devices such as fans or turbines. 
Properties 
The roughness of commercial steel surfaces is  = 0.000045 m. The dynamic viscosity of air at 40C is  = 
1.91810-5 kg/ms, and it is independent of pressure. The density of air listed in that table is for 1 atm. The density at 105 
kPa and 315 K can be determined from the ideal gas relation to be

Therefore, 62 W of mechanical power needs to be imparted to the fluid. The shaft power will be more than this due to fan 
inefficiency; the electrical power input will be even more due to motor inefficiency. Also, the friction factor could be 
determined easily from the explicit Haaland relation. It would give f = 0.0181, which is sufficiently close to 0.0183.

Solution 
Glycerin is flowing through a smooth pipe with a specified average velocity. The pressure drop per 10 m of 
the pipe is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The entrance effects are negligible, and thus the flow is fully 
developed. 3 The pipe involves no components such as bends, valves, and connectors. 4 The piping section involves no 
work devices such as pumps and turbines.

The density and dynamic viscosity of glycerin at 40°C are given to be  = 1252 kg/m3 and  = 0.27 kg/ms,

Discussion 
The pressure drop decays quite rapidly with increasing diameter – by several orders of magnitude, in fact. 
We conclude that larger diameter pipes are better when pressure drop is of concern. Of course, bigger pipes cost more and 
take up more space, so there is typically an optimum pipe size that is a compromise between cost and practicality.

connectors. 5 The piping section involves no work devices such as pumps and turbines. 
Properties 
The density and dynamic viscosity of oil are given to be  = 56.8 lbm/ft3 and  = 0.0278 lbm/fts,

which is less than 2300. Therefore, the flow is laminar for all three cases, and the analysis above is valid. 
Discussion 
Note that the flow is driven by the combined effect of pressure difference and gravity. As can be seen from 
the calculated rates above, gravity opposes uphill flow, but helps downhill flow. Gravity has no effect on the flow rate in 
the horizontal case. Downhill flow can occur even in the absence of an applied pressure difference.

Solution 
Liquid ammonia is flowing through a copper tube at a specified mass flow rate. The pressure drop, the head 
loss, and the pumping power required to overcome the frictional losses in the tube are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The entrance effects are negligible, and thus the flow is fully 
developed. 3 The pipe involves no components such as bends, valves, and connectors. 4 The piping section involves no 
work devices such as pumps and turbines. 
Properties 
The density and dynamic viscosity of liquid ammonia at -20C are  = 665.1 kg/m3 and  = 2.36110-4 
kg/ms. The roughness of copper tubing is 1.510-6 m. 
Analysis 
First we calculate the average velocity and the Reynolds number to determine the flow regime:

Therefore, useful power input in the amount of 0.167 kW is needed to overcome the frictional losses in the tube. 
Discussion 
The friction factor could also be determined easily from the explicit Haaland relation. It would give f = 
0.01928, which is sufficiently close to 0.01956. The friction factor corresponding to  = 0 in this case is 0.01810, which is 
about 8% lower. Therefore, the copper tubes in this case are nearly “smooth”.  
Also, the power input determined is the mechanical power that needs to be imparted to the fluid. The shaft power 
will be more than this due to pump inefficiency; the electrical power input will be even more due to motor inefficiency.

Minor Losses 
 
 
 
8-56C  
Solution 
We are to compare two different ways to reduce the minor loss in pipe bends.  
 
Analysis 
The loss coefficient is lower for flow through a 90 miter elbow with well-designed vanes (KL  0.2) than it 
is for flow through a smooth curved bend (KL  0.9). Therefore, using miter elbows with vanes results in a greater 
reduction in pumping power requirements. 
 
Discussion 
Both values are for threaded elbows. The loss coefficients for flanged elbows are much lower. 
 
 
 
 
8-57C 
Solution 
We are to define equivalent length and its relationship to the minor loss coefficient.  
 
Analysis 
Equivalent length is the length of a straight pipe which would give the same head loss as the minor loss 
component. It is related to the minor loss coefficient by    
L
K
f
D
L

equiv
 
 
Discussion 
Equivalent length is not as universal as minor loss coefficient because it depends on the roughness and 
Reynolds number of the equivalent straight section of pipe. 
 
 
 
 
 
8-58C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the effect of rounding a pipe inlet.  
 
Analysis 
The effect of rounding of a pipe inlet on the loss coefficient is (c) very significant. 
 
Discussion 
In fact, the minor loss coefficient changes from 0.8 for a reentrant pipe inlet to about 0.03 for a well-
rounded pipe inlet – quite a significant improvement.

8-59C 
Solution 
We are to discuss the effect of rounding on a pipe outlet.  
 
Analysis 
The effect of rounding of a pipe exit on the loss coefficient is (a) negligible. 
 
Discussion 
At any pipe outlet, all the kinetic energy is wasted, and the minor loss coefficient is equal to , which is 
about 1.05 for fully developed turbulent pipe flow. Rounding of the outlet does not help. 
 
 
 
 
 
8-60C  
Solution 
We are to compare the minor losses of a gradual expansion and a gradual contraction.  
 
Analysis 
A gradual expansion, in general, has a greater minor loss coefficient than a gradual contraction in 
pipe flow. This is due to the adverse pressure gradient in the boundary layer, which may lead to flow separation. 
 
Discussion 
Note, however, that pressure is “recovered” in a gradual expansion. In other words, the pressure rises in the 
direction of flow. Such a device is called a diffuser. 
 
 
 
 
 
8-61C  
Solution 
We are to discuss ways to reduce the head loss in a pipe flow with bends.  
 
Analysis 
Another way of reducing the head loss associated with turns is to install turning vanes inside the elbows. 
 
Discussion 
There are many other possible answers, such as: reduce the inside wall roughness of the pipe, use a 
larger diameter pipe, shorten the length of pipe as much as possible, etc. 
 
 
 
 
 
8-62C  
Solution 
We are to define minor loss and minor loss coefficient.  
 
Analysis 
The head losses associated with the flow of a fluid through fittings, valves, bends, elbows, tees, inlets, 
exits, enlargements, contractions, etc. are called minor losses, and are expressed in terms of the minor loss coefficient as

Solution 
Water is to be withdrawn from a water reservoir by drilling a hole at the bottom surface. The flow rate of 
water through the hole is to be determined for the well-rounded and sharp-edged entrance cases. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The reservoir is open to 
the atmosphere so that the pressure is atmospheric pressure at the free surface. 3 The 
effect of the kinetic energy correction factor is disregarded, and thus  = 1. 
Analysis 
The loss coefficient is KL = 0.5 for the sharp-edged entrance, and KL 
= 0.03 for the well-rounded entrance. We take point 1 at the free surface of the 
reservoir and point 2 at the exit of the hole. We also take the reference level at the 
exit of the hole (z2 = 0). Noting that the fluid at both points is open to the atmosphere 
(and thus P1 = P2 = Patm) and that the fluid velocity at the free surface is zero (V1 = 
0), the energy equation for a control volume between these two points (in terms of 
heads) simplifies to

The flow rate in the case of frictionless flow (KL = 0) is 4.7610-3 m3/s. Note that the frictional losses cause 
the flow rate to decrease by 1.5% for well-rounded entrance, and 18.3% for the sharp-edged entrance.

Solution 
Water is discharged from a water reservoir through a circular hole of diameter D at the side wall at a 
vertical distance H from the free surface. A relation for the “equivalent diameter” of the sharp-edged hole for use in 
frictionless flow relations is to be obtained. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The reservoir is open to the atmosphere so that the pressure is 
atmospheric pressure at the free surface. 3 The effect of the kinetic energy correction factor is disregarded, and thus  = 1. 
Analysis 
The loss coefficient is KL = 0.5 for the sharp-edged entrance, and KL = 0 for the “frictionless” flow. We take 
point 1 at the free surface of the reservoir and point 2 at the exit of the hole, which is also taken to be the reference level (z2 
= 0). Noting that the fluid at both points is open to the atmosphere (and thus P1 = P2 = Patm) and that the fluid velocity at the

Solution 
A horizontal water pipe has an abrupt expansion. The water velocity and pressure in the smaller diameter 
pipe are given. The pressure after the expansion and the error that would have occurred if the Bernoulli Equation had been 
used are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady, horizontal, and incompressible. 2 The flow at both the inlet and the outlet is fully 
developed and turbulent with kinetic energy corrections factors of 1 = 2 = 1.06 (given). 
Properties 
We take the density of water to be  = 1000 kg/m3.

Therefore, despite the head (and pressure) loss, the pressure increases from 300 kPa to 321 kPa after the expansion. This is 
due to the conversion of dynamic pressure to static pressure when the velocity is decreased.  
 
When the head loss is disregarded, the downstream pressure is determined from the Bernoulli equation to be

Therefore, the error in the Bernoulli equation is 
Error = P2, Bernoulli –  P2   = 456.9 – 431.5 = 25.4 kPa  
Note that the use of the Bernoulli equation results in an error of (456.9 – 431.5) / 431.5 = 0.059 or 5.9%. 
Discussion 
It is common knowledge that higher pressure upstream is necessary to cause flow, and it may come as a 
surprise that the downstream pressure has increased after the abrupt expansion, despite the loss. This is because the sum of 
the three Bernoulli terms which comprise the total head, consisting of pressure head, velocity head, and elevation head, 
namely  [P/g + ½V2/g+ z], drives the flow. With a geometric flow expansion, initially higher velocity head is converted to 
downstream pressure head, and this increase outweighs the non-convertible and non-recoverable head loss term.

Piping Systems and Pump Selection 
 
 
 
8-67C 
Solution 
We are to discuss whether the required pump head is equal to the elevation difference when irreversible 
head losses are negligible.  
 
Analysis 
Yes, when the head loss is negligible, the required pump head is equal to the elevation difference between 
the free surfaces of the two reservoirs. 
 
Discussion 
A pump in a piping system may: (1) raise the fluid’s elevation, and/or (2) increase the fluid’s kinetic energy, 
and/or (3) increase the fluid’s pressure, and/or (4) overcome irreversible losses. In this case, (2), (3), and (4) are zero or 
negligible; thus only (1) remains. 
 
 
 
 
 
8-68C 
Solution 
We are to explain how the operating point of a pipe/pump system is determined.  
 
Analysis 
The pump installed in a piping system operates at the point where the system curve (required demand) 
and the characteristic curve (available supply) intersect. This point of intersection is called the operating point. 
 
Discussion 
The volume flow rate “automatically” adjusts itself to reach the operating point. 
 
 
 
 
 
8-69C  
Solution   
We are to discuss whether attaching a nozzle to a garden hose will increase or decrease the filling time 
when the hose is used to fill a bucket.  
 
Analysis   
Any additional component in a flow line introduces additional resistance to flow and thus head loss, which 
results in a reduction of flow rate for a given pressure difference.  Therefore, the filling time of the bucket will increase. 
 
Discussion 
If he used a diffuser instead (diverging rather than converging section of pipe), the filling time would 
decrease somewhat (larger volume flow rate) due to the pressure recovery created by the diffuser.

8-42
8-70C  
Solution   
We are to compare discharge times of two water tanks for two cases.  
 
Analysis   
If we ignore frictional losses in the hose, the tank with the hose attached will empty first since it has an 
available head of 3-m at the start while the other tank has an available head of just 2 m. The water discharging directly to 
the table continues to accelerate during its free fall from the table to the ground, but this does not affect the flow velocity 
(and thus flow rate) at the discharge. 
 
Discussion 
In real life, there are irreversible head losses in the hose, and the answer may change, depending on how 
significant these losses are. 
 
 
 
 
8-71C  
Solution 
We are to compare the flow rate and pressure drop in two pipes of different diameters in series.  
 
Analysis 
For a piping system that involves two pipes of different diameters (but of identical length, material, and 
roughness) connected in series, (a) the flow rate through both pipes is the same and (b) the pressure drop through the 
smaller diameter pipe is larger. 
 
Discussion 
The wall shear stress on the smaller pipe is larger, friction factor f is larger, and thus the head loss is higher. 
 
 
 
 
8-72C  
Solution 
We are to compare the flow rate and pressure drop in two pipes of different diameters in parallel.  
 
Analysis 
For a piping system that involves two pipes of different diameters (but of identical length, material, and 
roughness) connected in parallel, (a) the flow rate through the larger diameter pipe is larger and (b) the pressure drop 
through both pipes is the same. 
 
Discussion 
Since the two pipes separate from each other but then later re-join, the pressure drop between the two 
junctions must be the same, regardless of which pipe segment is under consideration. 
 
 
 
 
8-73C  
Solution 
We are to compare the pressure drop of two different-length pipes in parallel.  
 
Analysis 
The pressure drop through both pipes is the same since the pressure at a point has a single value, and the 
inlet and exits of these the pipes connected in parallel coincide. 
 
Discussion 
The length, diameter, roughness, and number and type of minor losses are all irrelevant – for any two pipes 
in parallel, both have the same pressure drop.

8-74C  
Solution 
We are to draw a pump head versus 
flow rate chart and identify several parameters.  
 
Analysis 
The plot of the head loss versus the 
flow rate is called the system curve (required 
demand). The experimentally determined pump head 
and pump efficiency versus the flow rate curves are 
called characteristic curves (available supply). The 
pump installed in a piping system operates at the 
point where the system curve and the characteristic 
curve intersect. This point of intersection is called the 
operating point. 
 
Discussion 
The volume flow rate “automatically” 
adjusts itself to reach the operating point.

Solution 
Underground water is to be pumped to a reservoir at a much higher elevation using plastic pipes. The 
required power input to the pump is to be determined.   
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The entrance effects are negligible, and thus the flow is fully 
developed. 3 The total minor loss coefficient due to the use elbows, vanes, etc is estimated to be 12. 4 Water level in the 
well remains constant. 5 Both the well and the reservoir are open to the atmosphere. 6 The kinetic energy correction factors 
are the same at both the inlet and exit. 
Properties 
The density and dynamic viscosity of water are given to be  = 1000 kg/m3 and  = 0.00131 kg/ms. The 
plastic pipe is smooth and thus  = 0.  
Analysis 
We choose point 1 at the free surface of well water and point 2 at the free surface of the reservoir in the 
farm. We note the fluid at both points is open to the atmosphere (and thus P1 = P2 = Patm) and the fluid velocities at both 
points are low (V1  V2  0). We take the free surface of the well as the reference level (z1 = 0). Then the energy equation 
for a control volume between these two points simplifies to

Discussion 
Pumps have different characteristics, depending on their design, and an ordinary 6 kW pump will not do the 
job. Some pumps are designed for low head and high flow rate, and others for high head and low flow rate. The proper 
pump model to be purchased must be selected after examining the performance curves supplied by the manufacturer.

Solution 
The flow rate through a piping system connecting two reservoirs is given. The elevation of the source is to 
be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The entrance effects are negligible, and thus the flow is fully 
developed. 3 The elevations of the reservoirs remain constant. 4 There are no pumps or turbines in the piping system. 
Properties 
The density and dynamic viscosity of water at 70F are  = 62.30 lbm/ft3 and  = 2.360 lbm/fth = 
6.55610-4 lbm/fts. The roughness of cast iron pipe is  = 0.00085 ft. 
Analysis 
The piping system involves 60 ft of 2-in diameter piping, a well-rounded entrance (KL = 0.03), 4 standard 
flanged elbows (KL = 0.3 each), a fully open gate valve (KL = 0.2), and a sharp-edged exit (KL = 1.0). We choose points 1 
and 2 at the free surfaces of the two reservoirs. Noting that the fluid at both points is open to the atmosphere (and thus P1 = 
P2 = Patm), the fluid velocities at both points are zero (V1 = V2 =0), the free surface of the lower reservoir is the reference 
level (z2 = 0), and that there is no pump or turbine (hpump,u = hturbine = 0), the energy equation for a control volume between 
these two points simplifies to

Therefore, the free surface of the first reservoir must be 12.6 ft above the free surface of the lower reservoir to ensure water 
flow between the two reservoirs at the specified rate.  
Discussion 
Note that fL/D = 11.5 in this case, which is about 5 folds of the total minor loss coefficient. Therefore, 
ignoring the sources of minor losses in this case would result in an error of about 20%.

Solution 
A water tank open to the atmosphere is initially filled with water. A sharp-edged orifice at the bottom drains 
to the atmosphere. The initial velocity from the tank and the time required to empty the tank are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is uniform and incompressible. 2 The flow is turbulent so that the tabulated value of the loss 
coefficient can be used. 3 The effect of the kinetic energy correction factor is negligible,  = 1. 
Properties 
The loss coefficient is KL = 0.5 for a sharp-edged entrance. 
Analysis 
(a) We take point 1 at the free surface of the tank, and point 2 at the exit of the orifice. We also take the 
reference level at the centerline of the orifice (z2 = 0), and take the positive direction of z to be upwards. Noting that the 
fluid at both points is open to the atmosphere (and thus P1 = P2 = Patm) and that the fluid velocity at the free surface is very 
low (V1  0), the energy equation for a control volume between these two points (in terms of heads) simplifies to

Note that the loss coefficient causes the draining time of the tank to increase by (10.6 - 8.7)/10.6 = 0.18 or 18%, which is 
quite significant. Therefore, the loss coefficient should always be considered in draining processes.

Solution 
A water tank open to the atmosphere is initially filled with water. A sharp-edged orifice at the bottom drains 
to the atmosphere through a long pipe. The initial velocity from the tank and the time required to empty the tank are to be 
determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is uniform and incompressible. 2 The draining pipe is horizontal. 3 The flow is turbulent so that 
the tabulated value of the loss coefficient can be used. 4 The friction factor remains constant (in reality, it changes since the 
flow velocity and thus the Reynolds number changes). 5 The effect of the kinetic energy correction factor is negligible, so 
we set  = 1. 
Properties 
The loss coefficient is KL = 0.5 for a sharp-edged entrance. The friction factor of the pipe is given to be 
0.015. 
Analysis 
(a) We take point 1 at the free surface of the tank, and point 2 at the exit of the pipe. We take the reference 
level at the centerline of the pipe (z2 = 0), and take the positive direction of z to be upwards. Noting that the fluid at both 
points is open to the atmosphere (and thus P1 = P2 = Patm) and that the fluid velocity at the free surface is very low  (V1  0),

Solution 
A water tank open to the atmosphere is initially filled with water. A sharp-edged orifice at the bottom drains 
to the atmosphere through a long pipe equipped with a pump. For a specified initial velocity, the required useful pumping 
power and the time required to empty the tank are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is uniform and incompressible. 2 The draining pipe is horizontal. 3 The flow is turbulent so that 
the tabulated value of the loss coefficient can be used. 4 The friction factor remains constant. 5 The effect of the kinetic 
energy correction factor is negligible, so we set  = 1. 
Properties 
The loss coefficient is KL = 0.5 for a sharp-edged entrance. The friction factor of the pipe is given to be 
0.015. The density of water at 30C is  = 996 kg/m3. 
Analysis 
(a) We take point 1 at the free surface of the tank, and point 2 at the exit of the pipe. We take the reference 
level at the centerline of the orifice (z2 = 0), and take the positive direction of z to be upwards. Noting that the fluid at both 
points is open to the atmosphere (and thus P1 = P2 = Patm) and that the fluid velocity at the free surface is very low  (V1  0), 
the energy equation for a control volume between these two points (in terms of heads) simplifies to

Discussion 
 
1 Note that the pump reduces the discharging time from 38.9 min to 7.5 min. The assumption of constant discharge velocity 
can be justified on the basis of the pump head being much larger than the elevation head (therefore, the pump will dominate 
the discharging process). The answer obtained assumes that the elevation head remains constant at 2 m (rather than 
decreasing to zero eventually), and thus it under predicts the actual discharge time. By an exact analysis, it can be shown 
that when the effect of the decrease in elevation is considered, the discharge time becomes 468 s = 7.8 min. This is 
demonstrated below.

2 The required pump head (of water) is 11.46 m, which is more than 10.3 m of water column which corresponds to the 
atmospheric pressure at sea level. If the pump exit is at 1 atm, then the absolute pressure at pump inlet must be negative ( = 
-1.16 m or – 11.4 kPa), which is impossible. Therefore, the system cannot work if the pump is installed near the pipe exit, 
and cavitation will occur long before the pipe exit where the pressure drops to 4.2 kPa and thus the pump must be installed 
close to the pipe entrance. A detailed analysis is given below. 
 
Demonstration 1 for Prob. 8-84 (extra)  (the effect of drop in water level on discharge time)  
Noting that the water height z in the tank is variable, the average discharge velocity through the pipe at any given time, in 
general, can be expressed as

Demonstration 2 for Prob. 8-84  (on cavitation) 
We take the pump as the control volume, with point 1 at the inlet and point 2 at the exit. We assume the pump inlet and 
outlet diameters to be the same and the elevation difference between the pump inlet and the exit to be negligible. Then we

have z1   z2  and V1  V2. The pump is located near the pipe exit, and thus the pump exit pressure is equal to the pressure at 
the pipe exit, which is the atmospheric pressure, P2 = Patm.  Also, the can take hL = 0 since the frictional effects and loses in 
the pump are accounted for by the pump efficiency. Then the energy equation for the pump (in terms of heads) reduces to

which is impossible (absolute pressure cannot be negative). The technical answer to the question is that cavitation will 
occur since the pressure drops below the vapor pressure of 4.246 kPa. The practical answer is that the question is invalid 
(void) since the system will not work anyway. Therefore, we conclude that the pump must be located near the beginning, 
not the end of the pipe. Note that when doing a cavitation analysis, we must work with the absolute pressures. (If the 
system were installed as indicated, a water velocity of V = 4 m/s could not be established regardless of how much pump 
power were applied.  This is because the atmospheric air and water elevation heads alone are not sufficient to drive such 
flow, with the pump restoring pressure after the flow.) 
 
To determine the furthest distance from the tank the pump can be located without allowing cavitation, we assume 
the pump is located at a distance L* from the exit, and choose the pump and the discharge portion of the pipe (from the 
pump to the exit) as the system, and write the energy equation. The energy equation this time will be as above, except that 
hL  (the pipe losses) must be considered and the pressure at 1 (pipe inlet) is the cavitation pressure, P1 = 4.246 kPa:

Therefore, the pump must be at least 12.5 m from the pipe exit to avoid cavitation at the pump inlet (this is where the 
lowest pressure occurs in the piping system, and where the cavitation is most likely to occur).   
 
Cavitation onset places an upper limit to the length of the pipe on the suction side.  A pipe slightly longer would 
become vapor bound, and the pump could not pull the suction necessary to sustain the flow.  Even if the pipe on the suction 
side were slightly shorter than 100 – 12.5 = 87.5 m, cavitation can still occur in the pump since the liquid in the pump is 
usually accelerated at the expense of pressure, and cavitation in the pump could erode and destroy the pump. 
 
Also, over time, scale and other buildup inside the pipe can and will increase the pipe roughness, increasing the 
friction factor f, and therefore the losses. Buildup also decreases the pipe diameter, which increases pressure drop. 
Therefore, flow conditions and system performance may change (generally decrease) as the system ages.  A new system 
that marginally misses cavitation may degrade to where cavitation becomes a problem.  Proper design avoids these 
problems, or where cavitation cannot be avoided for some reason, it can at least be anticipated.

Solution 
Water is transported to a residential area through concrete pipes, and the idea of lining the interior surfaces 
of the pipe is being evaluated to reduce frictional losses. The percent increase or decrease in the pumping power 
requirements as a result of lining the concrete pipes is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The entrance effects are negligible, and thus the flow is fully 
developed. 3 The pipe line involves no components such as bends, valves, and connectors, and thus no minor losses. 4 The 
flow is turbulent (to be verified). 
Properties 
The density and kinematic viscosity of water are given to be  = 1000 kg/m3 and  = 110-6 m2/s. The 
surface roughness is 3 mm for concrete and 0.04 mm for the lining.

The required pumping power changes by (385-709)709 = -0.457; a decrease of 45.7%. 
Discussion 
Note that the pipe head losses and the required pumping power are reduced almost by almost half as result 
of lining the inner surface of the concrete pipes, despite the reduction in pipe diameter. This confirms the importance of 
having smooth surfaces in piping.

Solution 
The air discharge rate of a clothes drier with no ducts is given. The flow rate when duct work is attached is 
to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The entrance effects in the duct are negligible, and thus the flow 
is fully developed. 3 The flow is turbulent so that the tabulated value of the loss coefficients can be used.  4 The losses at 
the vent and its proximity are negligible. 5 The effect of the kinetic energy correction factor on discharge stream is 
negligible,  = 1. 
Properties 
The density of air at 1 atm and 120F is  = 0.06843 lbm/ft3. The roughness of galvanized iron pipe is  = 
0.0005 ft. The loss coefficient is KL  0 for a well-rounded entrance with negligible loss, KL = 0.3 for a flanged 90 smooth 
bend, and KL = 1.0 for an exit. The friction factor of the duct is given to be 0.019. 
Analysis 
To determine the useful fan power input, we choose point 1 inside the drier sufficiently far from the vent, 
and point 2 at the exit on the same horizontal level so that z1 = z2 and P1 = P2, and the flow velocity at point 1 is negligible 
(V1 = 0) since it is far from the inlet of the fan. Also, the frictional piping losses between 1 and 2 are negligible, and the 
only loss involved is due to fan inefficiency. Then the energy equation for a control volume between 1 and 2 reduces to

Solution 
Oil is flowing through a vertical glass funnel which is always maintained full. The flow rate of oil through 
the funnel and the funnel effectiveness are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The entrance effects are negligible, and thus the flow is fully 
developed (to be verified). 3 The frictional loses in the cylindrical reservoir are negligible since its diameter is very large 
and thus the oil velocity is very low.   
Properties 
The density and viscosity of oil at 20C are  = 888.1 kg/m3 and  = 0.8374 kg/ms. 
Analysis 
We take point 1 at the free surface of the oil in the cylindrical reservoir, and point 2 at the exit of the funnel 
pipe which is also taken as the reference level (z2 = 0). The fluid at both points is open to the atmosphere (and thus P1 = P2 
= Patm) and that the fluid velocity at the free surface is negligible (V1  0). For the ideal case of “frictionless flow,” the exit 
velocity is determined from the Bernoulli equation to be

Discussion 
Note that the funnel effectiveness increases as the pipe diameter is increased, and decreases as the pipe 
length is increased. This is because the frictional losses are proportional to the length but inversely proportional to the 
diameter of the flow sections.

Solution 
Water is drained from a large reservoir through two pipes connected in series. The discharge rate of water 
from the reservoir is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The pipes are horizontal. 3 The entrance effects are negligible, 
and thus the flow is fully developed. 4 The flow is turbulent so that the tabulated value of the loss coefficients can be used. 
5 The pipes involve no components such as bends, valves, and other connectors. 6 The piping section involves no work 
devices such as pumps and turbines. 7 The reservoir is open to the atmosphere so that the pressure is atmospheric pressure 
at the free surface. 8 The water level in the reservoir remains constant. 9 The effect of the kinetic energy correction factor is 
negligible,  = 1. 
Properties 
The density and dynamic viscosity of water at 15C are  = 999.1 kg/m3 and  = 1.13810-3 kg/ms, 
respectively. The loss coefficient is KL = 0.5 for a sharp-edged entrance, and it is 0.46 for the sudden contraction, 
corresponding to d2/D2 = 42/102 = 0.16. The pipes are made of plastic and thus they are smooth,  = 0. 
Analysis 
We take point 1 at the free surface of the reservoir, and point 2 at the exit of the pipe, which is also taken to 
be the reference level (z2 = 0). Noting that the fluid at both points is open to the atmosphere (and thus P1 = P2 = Patm), the 
fluid level in the reservoir is constant (V1 = 0), and that there are no work devices such as pumps and turbines, the energy 
equation for a control volume between these two points (in terms of heads) simplifies to

Note that the diameters of the two pipes, and thus the flow velocities through them are different. Denoting the first pipe by

Note that Re > 4000 for both pipes, and thus the assumption of turbulent flow is valid.  
 
Discussion 
This problem can also be solved by using an iterative approach by assuming an exit velocity, but it will be 
very time consuming. Equation solvers such as EES are invaluable for this kind of problems.

Solution 
The flow rate through a piping system between a river and a storage tank is given. The power input to the 
pump is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The entrance effects are negligible, and thus the flow is fully 
developed. 3 The flow is turbulent so that the tabulated value of the loss coefficients can be used (to be verified). 4 The 
elevation difference between the free surfaces of the tank and the river remains constant. 5 The effect of the kinetic energy 
correction factor is negligible,  = 1.  
Properties 
The density and dynamic viscosity of water at 70F are  = 62.30 lbm/ft3 and  = 2.360 lbm/fth = 
6.55610-4 lbm/fts. The roughness of galvanized iron pipe is  = 0.0005 ft. 
Analysis 
The piping system involves 125 ft of 5-in diameter piping, an entrance with negligible loses, 3 standard 
flanged 90 smooth elbows (KL = 0.3 each), and a sharp-edged exit (KL = 1.0). We choose points 1 and 2 at the free surfaces 
of the river and the tank, respectively. We note that the fluid at both points is open to the atmosphere (and thus P1 = P2 = 
Patm), and the fluid velocity is 6 ft/s at point 1 and zero at point 2 (V1 = 6 ft/s and V2 =0). We take the free surface of the 
river as the reference level (z1 = 0). Then the energy equation for a control volume between these two points simplifies to

4.87 kW 
 
Therefore, 4.87 kW of electric power must be supplied to the pump.  
Discussion 
The friction factor could also be determined easily from the explicit Haaland relation. It would give f = 
0.0211, which is identical to the calculated value. The friction coefficient would drop to 0.0135 if smooth pipes were used. 
Note that fL/D = 6.3 in this case, which is about 3 times the total minor loss coefficient of 1.9. Therefore, the frictional 
losses in the pipe dominate the minor losses, but the minor losses are still significant.

Solution 
In the previous problem, the effect of the pipe diameter on pumping power for the same constant flow rate 
is to be investigated by varying the pipe diameter from 1 in to 10 in in increments of 1 in.

Discussion 
We see that the required pump power decreases very rapidly as pipe diameter increases. This is due to the 
significant decrease in irreversible head loss in larger diameter pipes. The Reynolds number drops into the laminar region, 
which makes these calculations invalid.

Solution 
A solar heated water tank is to be used for showers using gravity driven flow. For a specified flow rate, the 
elevation of the water level in the tank relative to showerhead is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The entrance effects are negligible, and thus the flow is fully 
developed. 3 The flow is turbulent so that the tabulated value of the loss coefficients can be used (to be verified). 4 The 
elevation difference between the free surface of water in the tank and the shower head remains constant. 5 There are no 
pumps or turbines in the piping system. 6 The losses at the entrance and at the showerhead are said to be negligible. 7 The 
water tank is open to the atmosphere. 8 The effect of the kinetic energy correction factor is negligible,  = 1. 
Properties 
The density and dynamic viscosity of water at 40C are  = 992.1 kg/m3 and  = 0.65310-3 kg/ms, 
respectively. The loss coefficient is KL = 0.5 for a sharp-edged entrance. The roughness of galvanized iron pipe is  = 
0.00015 m. 
Analysis 
The piping system involves 20 m of 1.5-cm diameter piping, an entrance with negligible loss, 4 miter bends 
(90) without vanes (KL = 1.1 each), and a wide open globe valve (KL = 10). We choose point 1 at the free surface of water 
in the tank, and point 2 at the shower exit, which is also taken to be the reference level (z2 = 0). The fluid at both points is 
open to the atmosphere (and thus P1 = P2 = Patm), and V1 = 0. Then the energy equation for a control volume between these 
two points simplifies to

since 2 = 1. Therefore, the free surface of the tank must be 246 m above the shower exit to ensure water flow at the 
specified rate. 
Discussion 
We neglected the minor loss associated with the shower head. In reality, this loss is most likely significant.

Solution 
The flow rate through a piping system connecting two water reservoirs with the same water level is given. 
The absolute pressure in the pressurized reservoir is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The entrance effects are negligible, and thus the flow is fully 
developed. 3 The flow is turbulent so that the tabulated value of the loss coefficients can be used (to be verified). 4 There 
are no pumps or turbines in the piping system.   
Properties 
The density and dynamic viscosity of water at 10C are  = 999.7 kg/m3 and  = 1.30710-3 kg/ms. The 
loss coefficient is KL = 0.5 for a sharp-edged entrance, KL = 2 for swing check valve, KL = 0.2 for the fully open gate valve, 
and KL = 1 for the exit. The roughness of cast iron pipe is  = 0.00026 m. 
Analysis 
We choose points 1 and 2 at the free surfaces of the two reservoirs. We note that the fluid velocities at both 
points are zero (V1 = V2 =0), the fluid at point 2 is open to the atmosphere (and thus  P2 = Patm), both points are at the same 
level (z1 = z2). Then the energy equation for a control volume between these two points simplifies to

Discussion 
The absolute pressure above the first reservoir must be 734 kPa, which is quite high. Note that  the minor 
losses in this case are negligible (about 4% of total losses). Also, the friction factor could be determined easily from the 
explicit Haaland relation (it gives the same result, 0.0424). The friction coefficient would drop to 0.0202 if smooth pipes 
were used.

Solution 
A tanker is to be filled with fuel oil from an underground reservoir using a plastic hose. The required power 
input to the pump is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The entrance effects are negligible, and thus the flow is fully 
developed. 3 The flow is turbulent so that the tabulated value of the loss coefficients can be used (to be verified). 4 Fuel oil 
level remains constant.  5 Reservoir is open to the atmosphere.  
Properties 
The density and dynamic viscosity of fuel oil are given to be  = 920 kg/m3 and  = 0.045 kg/ms. The loss 
coefficient is KL = 0.12 for a slightly-rounded entrance and KL = 0.3 for a 90 smooth bend (flanged). The plastic pipe is 
smooth and thus  = 0. The kinetic energy correction factor at hose discharge is given to be  = 1.05. 
Analysis 
We choose point 1 at the free surface of oil in the reservoir and point 2 at the exit of the hose in the tanker. 
We note the fluid at both points is open to the atmosphere (and thus P1 = P2 = Patm) and the fluid velocity at point 1 is zero 
(V1 = 0). We take the free surface of the reservoir as the reference level (z1 = 0). Then the energy equation for a control 
volume between these two points simplifies to

Cast iron piping of a water distribution system involves a parallel section with identical diameters but 
different lengths. The flow rate through one of the pipes is given, and the flow rate through the other pipe is to be

From Moody’s chart, we observe that for a relative roughness of 0.00087, the flow is fully turbulent for Reynolds number 
greater than about 106. Therefore, the flow in both pipes is fully turbulent, and thus the assumption that the friction factor is 
the same for both pipes is valid.  
Discussion 
Note that the flow rate in pipe B is less than the flow rate in pipe A because of the larger losses due to the 
larger length.

B must also be 160.1 m. Then the average velocity in pipe B and the flow rate become

Discussion 
Note that the flow rate in pipe B decreases slightly (from 0.310 to 0.304 m3/s) due to the larger minor loss in 
that pipe. Also, minor losses constitute just a few percent of the total loss, and they can be neglected if great accuracy is not 
required.

Solution 
Geothermal water is supplied to a city through stainless steel pipes at a specified rate. The electric power 
consumption and its daily cost are to be determined, and it is to be assessed if the frictional heating during flow can make 
up for the temperature drop caused by heat loss. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The entrance effects are negligible, and thus the flow is fully 
developed. 3 The minor losses are negligible because of the large length-to-diameter ratio and the relatively small number 
of components that cause minor losses. 4 The geothermal well and the city are at about the same elevation. 5 The properties 
of geothermal water are the same as fresh water. 6 The fluid pressures at the wellhead and the arrival point in the city are 
the same.   
Properties 
The properties of water at 110C are  = 950.6 kg/m3,  = 0.25510-3 kg/ms, and Cp = 4.229 kJ/kgC. The 
roughness of stainless steel pipes is 210-6 m. 
Analysis 
(a) We take point 1 at the well-head of geothermal resource and point 2 at the final point of delivery at the 
city, and the entire piping system as the control volume. Both points are at the same elevation  (z2 = z2) and the same 
velocity (V1 = V2) since the pipe diameter is constant, and the same pressure (P1 = P2). Then the energy equation for this 
control volume simplifies to

Therefore, the pumps will consume 4160 kW of electric power to overcome friction and maintain flow. The pumps must 
raise the pressure of the geothermal water by 2218 kPa. Providing a pressure rise of this magnitude at one location may 
create excessive stress in piping at that location. Therefore, it is more desirable to raise the pressure by smaller amounts at a 
several locations along the flow. This will keep the maximum pressure in the system and the stress in piping at a safer level.  
(b) The daily cost of electric power consumption is determined by multiplying the amount of power used per day by the

 (c) The energy consumed by the pump (except the heat dissipated by the motor to the air) is eventually dissipated as heat 
due to the frictional effects. Therefore, this problem is equivalent to heating the water by a 4159 kW of resistance heater 
(again except the heat dissipated by the motor). To be conservative, we consider only the useful mechanical energy 
supplied to the water by the pump. The temperature rise of water due to this addition of energy is

Therefore, the temperature of water will rise at least 0.55C, which is more than the 0.5C drop in temperature (in reality, 
the temperature rise will be more since the energy dissipation due to pump inefficiency will also appear as temperature rise 
of water). Thus we conclude that the frictional heating during flow can more than make up for the temperature drop caused 
by heat loss. 
Discussion 
The pumping power requirement and the associated cost can be reduced by using a larger diameter pipe. 
But the cost savings should be compared to the increased cost of larger diameter pipe.

Solution 
Water is transported through a plastic pipe by gravity. The flow rate of water and the power requirement to 
maintain this flow rate if the pipe were horizontal are to be determined.   
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The entrance effects are negligible, and thus the flow is fully 
developed. 3 The pipe involves no components such as bends, valves, and connectors, and thus no minor losses. 4 Water 
level in the well remains constant. 5 Both ends of the pipe are open to the atmosphere. 6 The kinetic energy correction 
factors are the same at both the inlet and exit. 
Properties 
The density and kinematic viscosity of water are given to be  = 1000 kg/m3 and  = 1×10-6 m2/s. The 
plastic pipe is smooth and thus  = 0.  
Analysis 
We choose point 1 at the inlet and point 2 at the outlet of the pipe. We note the fluid at both points is open 
to the atmosphere (and thus P1 = P2 = Patm) and the fluid velocities at both points are equal (V1 = V2). There are no pumps 
and turbines involved. Then the energy equation for a control volume that consists of the entire pipe simplifies to

established at the point where the head loss equals the elevation drop. The average

Therefore, the 8-m elevation drop will cause a flow rate of 13.4 L/s. Note that Re > 4000, and thus the turbulent flow 
assumption is verified. 
 
If the pipe were horizontal, the required useful pumping power to achieve the same flow rate is determined as 
follows. If the flow rate is the same, then the average velocity, the friction factor, the Reynolds number, and the head loss 
will also be the same. The energy equation in this horizontal pipe case reduces to

Solution 
The flow rate and the maximum head loss in a gasoline pipeline are given. The required minimum diameter 
of the pipe is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The entrance effects are negligible, and thus the flow is fully 
developed. 3 The pipe line involves no components such as bends, valves, and connectors, and thus no minor losses. 4 The 
flow is turbulent (to be verified). 
Properties 
The density and kinematic viscosity of gasoline are given to be  = 680 kg/m3 and  = 4.2910-7 m2/s. 
Analysis 
The average velocity, Reynolds number, friction factor, and the head loss relations can be expressed as (D is 
in m, V is in m/s, Re and f are dimensionless)

This is a set of 4 equations in 4 unknowns, and solving them with an equation solver gives 
 
 
D = 0.412 m,     f = 0.0124,  V = 1.80 m/s,  and   Re = 1.73106 
 
Therefore, the diameter of the duct should be more than 41.2 cm if the head loss is not to exceed 10 m. Note that Re > 
4000, and thus the turbulent flow assumption is verified. 
 
The diameter can also be determined directly from the third Swamee-Jain formula to be

Solution 
Hot water in a water tank is circulated through a loop made of cast iron pipes at a specified average 
velocity. The required power input for the recirculating pump is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The flow is fully developed. 3 The flow is turbulent so that the 
tabulated value of the loss coefficients can be used (to be verified).  4 Minor losses other than those for elbows and valves 
are negligible. 
Properties 
The density and dynamic viscosity of water at 60C are  = 983.3 kg/m3,  = 0.46710-3 kg/ms. The 
roughness of cast iron pipes is 0.00026 m. The loss coefficient is KL = 0.9 for a threaded 90 smooth bend and KL = 0.2 for 
a fully open gate valve.  
Analysis 
Since the water circulates continually and undergoes a cycle, we can take the entire recirculating system as 
the control volume, and choose points 1 and 2 at any location at the same point. Then the properties (pressure, elevation, 
and velocity) at 1 and 2 will be identical, and the energy equation will simplify to

Therefore, the required power input of the recirculating pump is 111 W. 
 
Discussion 
It can be shown that the required pumping power input for the recirculating pump is 0.108 kW when the 
minor losses are not considered. Therefore, the minor losses can be neglected in this case without a major loss in accuracy.

Solution 
In the previous problem, the effect of average flow velocity on the power input to the recirculating pump for 
the same constant flow rate is to be investigated by varying the velocity from 0 to 3 m/s in increments of 0.3 m/s.

Discussion 
As you might have suspected, the required power does not increase linearly with average velocity. Rather, 
the relationship is nearly quadratic. A larger diameter pipe would cut reduce the required pumping power considerably.

Solution 
Hot water in a water tank is circulated through a loop made of plastic pipes at a specified average velocity. 
The required power input for the recirculating pump is to be determined.

Therefore, the required power input of the recirculating pump is 89.3 W. 
Discussion 
It can be shown that the required pumping power input for the recirculating pump is 82.1 W when the minor 
losses are not considered. Therefore, the minor losses can be neglected in this case without a major loss in accuracy. 
Compared to the cast iron pipes of the previous problem, the plastic pipes reduced the required power by more than 50%, 
from 217 to 89.3 W. Furthermore, plastic pipes are lighter and easier to install, and they don’t rust.

Solution 
The pumping power input to a piping system with two parallel pipes between two reservoirs is given. The 
flow rates are to be determined. 
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 
The entrance effects are negligible, and thus the flow is fully 
developed. 3 The elevations of the reservoirs remain constant. 
4 The minor losses and the head loss in pipes other than the 
parallel pipes are said to be negligible. 5 The flows through 
both pipes are turbulent (to be verified).  
Properties 
The density and dynamic viscosity of water at 
20C are  = 998 kg/m3 and  = 1.00210-3 kg/ms. Plastic 
pipes are smooth, and their roughness is zero,  = 0. 
Analysis 
This problem cannot be solved directly since the velocities (or flow rates) in the pipes are not known. 
Therefore, we would normally use a trial-and-error approach here. However, nowadays the equation solvers such as EES are 
widely available, and thus below we will simply set up the equations to be solved by an equation solver. The head supplied 
by the pump to the fluid is determined from

However it may be difficult to take the given integral. A numerical approach such as Simpson’s Rule or Trapezoidal Rule 
can be effectively used for integration. Using Simpson’s rule we obtained T = 252.9 seconds. The exact solution is 
T=252.848 seconds which is very close to the numerically obtained value. If we take the limit for 


T
we would see 
that the tank would never be emptied completely and h2 cannot be lower than approximately 0.36cm.

Flow Rate and Velocity Measurements 
 
 
 
8-105C  
Solution 
We are to compare thermal and laser Doppler anemometers.  
 
Analysis 
A thermal anemometer involves a very small electrically heated sensor (hot wire) which loses heat to 
the fluid, and the flow velocity is related to the electric current needed to maintain the sensor at a constant 
temperature.  The flow velocity is determined by measuring the voltage applied or the electric current passing through the 
sensor. A laser Doppler anemometer (LDA) does not have a sensor that intrudes into flow. Instead, it uses two laser beams 
that intersect at the point where the flow velocity is to be measured, and it makes use of the frequency shift (the 
Doppler effect) due to fluid flow to measure velocity. 
 
Discussion 
Both of these devices measure the flow velocity at a point in the flow. Of the two, the hot wire system is 
much less expensive and has higher frequency resolution, but may interfere with the flow being measured. 
 
 
 
 
 
8-106C  
Solution 
We are to compare LDV and PIV.  
 
Analysis 
Laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) measures velocity at a point, but particle image velocimetry (PIV) 
provides velocity values simultaneously throughout an entire cross-section and thus it is a whole-field technique.  
PIV combines the accuracy of LDV with the capability of flow visualization, and provides instantaneous flow field 
mapping. Both methods are non-intrusive, and both utilize laser light beams.  
 
Discussion 
In both cases, optical access is required – a hot-wire system does not require optical access, but, like the 
LDV system, measures velocity only at a single point. 
 
 
 
 
 
8-107C  
Solution 
We are to discus the primary considerations when choosing a flowmeter.  
 
Analysis 
The primary considerations when selecting a flowmeter are cost, size, pressure drop, capacity, accuracy, 
and reliability. 
 
Discussion 
As with just about everything you purchase, you usually get what you pay for.

Solution 
We are to explain how a Pitot-static tube works and discuss its application.

dynamic pressure, which is related to flow velocity by

. The Pitot tube is inexpensive, highly reliable since it has no moving parts, it has 
very small pressure drop, and its accuracy (which is about 3%) is acceptable for most engineering applications. 
 
Discussion 
The term “Pitot tube” or “Pitot probe” is often used in place of “Pitot-static probe”. Technically, however, a 
Pitot probe measures only stagnation pressure, while a Pitot-static probe measures both stagnation and static pressures.

Solution 
We are to discuss the operation of obstruction flowmeters.  
 
Analysis 
An obstruction flowmeter measures the flow rate through a pipe by constricting the flow, and measuring 
the decrease in pressure due to the increase in velocity at (or downstream of) the constriction site. The flow rate for 
obstruction flowmeters is expressed  as

 is the ratio of obstruction diameter to the pipe diameter. Of the three types of obstruction flow 
meters, the orifice meter is the cheapest, smallest, and least accurate, and it causes the greatest head loss. The Venturi meter 
is the most expensive, the largest, the most accurate, and it causes the smallest head loss. The nozzle meter is between the 
orifice and Venturi meters in all aspects. 
 
Discussion 
As diameter ratio  decreases, the pressure drop across the flowmeter increases, leading to a larger minor 
head loss associated with the flowmeter, but increasing the sensitivity of the measurement. 
 
 
 
 
 
8-110C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the operation of positive displacement flowmeters.  
 
Analysis 
A positive displacement flowmeter operates by trapping a certain amount of incoming fluid, 
displacing it to the discharge side of the meter, and counting the number of such discharge-recharge cycles to 
determine the total amount of fluid displaced. Positive displacement flowmeters are commonly used to meter gasoline, 
water, and natural gas because they are simple, reliable, inexpensive, and highly accurate even when the flow is unsteady. 
 
Discussion 
In applications such as a gasoline meter, it is not the flow rate that is measured, but the flow volume.

Solution 
We are to discuss the operation of a turbine flowmeter.  
 
Analysis 
A turbine flowmeter consists of a cylindrical flow section that houses a turbine that is free to rotate, 
and a sensor that generates a pulse each time a marked point on the turbine passes by to determine the rate of 
rotation. Turbine flowmeters are relatively inexpensive, give highly accurate results (as accurate as 0.25%) over a wide 
range of flow rates, and cause a very small head loss. 
 
Discussion 
Turbine flowmeters must be calibrated so that a reading of the rpm of the turbine is translated into average 
velocity in the pipe or volume flow rate through the pipe. 
 
 
 
 
 
8-112C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the operation of rotameters.  
 
Analysis 
A variable-area flowmeter (or rotameter) consists of a tapered conical transparent tube made of glass or 
plastic with a float inside that is free to move. As fluid flows through the tapered tube, the float rises within the tube to a 
location where the float weight, drag force, and buoyancy force balance each other. Variable-area flowmeters are very 
simple devices with no moving parts except for the float (but even the float remains stationary during steady operation), and 
thus they are very reliable. They are also very inexpensive, and they cause a relatively small head loss. 
 
Discussion 
There are also some disadvantages. For example, they must be mounted vertically, and most of them require 
a visual reading, and so cannot be automated or connected to a computer system.

Solution 
We are to calculate the volume flow rate of oil through a pipe.  
 
Assumptions 1 The Pitot-static probe is located at a location in the pipe where the local V = Vavg. 
 
Properties 
The density of the oil is given as  = 860 kg/m3, and the viscosity is given as  = 0.0103 kg/ms. 
 
Analysis 
Volume flow rate is equal to average velocity times cross-sectional area, and the average velocity is 
assumed to equal the measured local velocity, as obtained from the Pitot formula. Thus,

where we give our final result to three significant digits. 
 
Discussion 
Since the velocity profile is not uniform throughout the pipe, the result is dependent on the location of the 
probe. If the probe is not located properly, the measured volume flow rate will be in error. A more sophisticated way to 
measure the volume flow rate would be to traverse the probe across the entire pipe (or half of it, assuming axial symmetry) 
and then integrate.

Discussion 
This type of plot can be thought of as a calibration plot for the flowmeter, although a real calibration plot 
would use actual experimental data rather than data from equations. It would be interesting to compare the above plot to 
experimental data to see how close the predictions are.

Solution 
The flow rate of water is to be measured with flow nozzle equipped with an inverted air-water manometer. 
For a given differential height, the flow rate and head loss caused by the 
nozzle meter are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The discharge 
coefficient of the nozzle meter is Cd = 0.96.  
Properties 
The density and dynamic viscosity of water are given to 
be  = 998 kg/m3 and  = 1.00210-3 kg/ms, respectively. The density of 
the air in the manometer is assumed to by 1.20 kg/m3.

This is a corrected value of discharge coefficient. It is close to our original guess of 0.96, but is more accurate. We iterate 
another time using this corrected value of Cd, yielding V= 0.0009245 m3/s from which V = 0.7357 m/s, and Re = 
2.931104. Using this corrected value of Re, we get Cd = 0.9705. One further iteration reveals that the solution has 
converged. The final results are V = 0.736 m/s, Re = 2.93104, Cd = 0.971, and V= 0.000925 m3/s  (to 3 significant digits 
each).  
The head loss between the two measurement sections can be determined from the energy equation. Since z1 =z2,

So, the head loss is hL = 0.0259 m of water (to three significant digits).

You could save some calculations by ignoring the air density compared to water and by not iterating, but 
the results would not be as accurate.

which is about 2% different than the assumed value of 0.96. Using this refined value of Cd, the flow rate becomes 0.752 
L/s, which differs from our original result by only 2.4%.  If the problem is solved using an equation solver such as EES, 
then the problem can be formulated using the curve-fit formula for Cd (which depends on Reynolds number), and all 
equations can be solved simultaneously by letting the equation solver perform the iterations as necessary.

Solution 
Water is flowing through a brass tube bank of a heat exchanger at a specified flow rate. The pressure drop 
and the pumping power required are to be determined. Also, the percent reduction in the flow rate of water through the 
tubes is to be determined after scale build-up on the inner surfaces of the tubes. 
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady, horizontal, and incompressible. 2 The entrance effects are negligible, and thus the 
flow is fully developed (this is a questionable assumption since the tubes are short, and it will be verified). 3 The inlet, exit, 
and header losses are negligible, and the tubes involve no components such as bends, valves, and connectors. 4 The piping 
section involves no work devices such as pumps and turbines. 
Properties 
The density and dynamic viscosity of water at 20C are  = 983.3 kg/m3 and  = 0.46710-3 kg/ms, 
respectively. The roughness of brass tubing is 1.510-6 m. 
Analysis 
First we calculate the average velocity and the 
Reynolds number to determine the flow regime:

which is much less than 1.5 m. Therefore, the assumption of fully developed flow is valid. (The effect of the entry region is 
to increase the friction factor, and thus the pressure drop and pumping power).  
After scale buildup: When 1-mm thick scale builds up on the inner surfaces (and thus the diameter is reduced to 0.8 cm 
from 1 cm) with an equivalent roughness of 0.4 mm, and the useful power input is fixed at 0.135 kW, the problem can be 
formulated as follows (note that the flow rate and thus the average velocity are unknown in this case):

Solving this system of 5 equations in 5 unknown (f, Re, V, P, and V) using an equation solver (or a trial-and-error 
approach, by assuming a velocity value) gives 
f = 0.0723,  Re = 28,870, V = 1.714 m/s,  P = 19.6 kPa, and V = 0.00689 m3/s = 6.89 L/s

Therefore, for the same pump input, the flow rate will be reduced to less than half of the original flow rate when the pipes 
were new and clean. 
Discussion 
The friction factor could also be determined easily from the explicit Haaland relation.  Also, the power 
input determined is the mechanical power that needs to be imparted to the fluid. The shaft power will be more than this due 
to pump inefficiency; the electrical power input will be even more due to motor inefficiency.

Solution 
A compressor takes in air at a specified rate at the outdoor conditions. The useful power used by the 
compressor to overcome the frictional losses in the duct is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The entrance effects are negligible, and thus the flow is fully 
developed. 3 Air is an ideal gas. 4 The duct involves no components such as bends, valves, and connectors, and thus minor 
losses are negligible. 5 The flow section involves no work devices such as fans or turbines. 
Properties 
The properties of air at 1 atm = 101.3 kPa and 15C are 0 = 1.225 kg/m3 and  = 1.80210-5 kg/ms. The 
roughness of galvanized iron surfaces is  = 0.00015 m. The dynamic viscosity is independent of pressure, but density of an 
ideal gas is proportional to pressure. The density of air at 95 kPa is

Discussion 
Note hat the pressure drop in the duct and the power needed to overcome it is very small (relative to 120 
hp), and can be disregarded. The friction factor could also be determined easily from the explicit Haaland relation. It would 
give f = 0.02081, which is very close to the Colebrook value. Also, the power input determined is the mechanical power 
that needs to be imparted to the fluid. The shaft power will be more than this due to fan inefficiency; the electrical power 
input will be even more due to motor inefficiency.

Discussion 
The friction factor could also be determined easily from the explicit Haaland relation. It would give f = 
0.02175, which is sufficiently close to 0.02195. Assuming the pipe to be smooth would give 0.02187 for the friction factor, 
which is almost identical to the f value obtained from the Colebrook relation. Therefore, the duct can be treated as being 
smooth with negligible error.

which is less than 2300. Therefore, the flow is laminar for all three cases, and the analysis above is valid. 
Discussion Note that the flow is driven by the combined effect of pumping power and gravity. As expected, gravity 
opposes uphill flow, enhances downhill flow, and has no effect on horizontal flow. Downhill flow can occur even in the 
absence of a pressure difference applied by a pump. For the case of P1 = P2 (i.e., no applied pressure difference), the 
pressure throughout the entire pipe would remain constant, and the fluid would flow through the pipe under the influence of 
gravity at a rate that depends on the angle of inclination, reaching its maximum value when the pipe is vertical. When 
solving pipe flow problems, it is always a good idea to calculate the Reynolds number to verify the flow regime – laminar 
or turbulent.

Solution 
Water is discharged from a water reservoir through a circular pipe of diameter D at the side wall at a 
vertical distance H  from the free surface with a reentrant section. A relation for the “equivalent diameter” of the reentrant 
pipe for use in relations for frictionless flow through a hole is to be obtained. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The reservoir is open to the atmosphere so that the pressure is 
atmospheric pressure at the free surface. 3 The water level in the reservoir remains constant. 4 The pipe is horizontal. 5 The 
entrance effects are negligible, and thus the flow is fully developed and the friction factor f is constant. 6 The effect of the 
kinetic energy correction factor is negligible,  = 1. 
Properties 
The loss coefficient is KL = 0.8 for the reentrant section, and KL = 0 for the “frictionless” flow. 
Analysis 
We take point 1 at the free surface of the reservoir and point 2 at the exit of the pipe, which is also taken as 
the reference level (z2 = 0). Noting that the fluid at both points is open to the atmosphere (and thus P1 = P2 = Patm) and that 
the fluid velocity at the free surface of the reservoir is zero (V1 = 0), the energy equation for a control volume between these 
two points (in terms of heads) simplifies to

Solution 
A highly viscous liquid discharges from a large container through a small diameter tube in laminar flow. A 
relation is to be obtained for the variation of fluid depth in the tank with time. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Assumptions 1 The fluid is incompressible. 2 The discharge tube is horizontal, and the flow is laminar. 3 Entrance effects 
and the velocity heads are negligible.   
Analysis 
We take point 1 at the free surface of water in the tank, and point 2 at the exit of the pipe. We take the 
centerline of the pipe as the reference level (z1 = h and z2 = 0). Noting that the fluid at both points 1 and 2 are open to the 
atmosphere (and thus P1 = P2 = Patm ) and that the fluid velocity at the free surface is very low  (V1  0) and the velocity 
heads are negligible, the energy equation for a control volume between these two points gives

Solution 
A water pipe has an abrupt expansion from diameter D1 to D2. It is to be shown that the loss coefficient is

, and KL and P2 are to be calculated.  
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The pressure is uniform at the cross-section where expansion 
occurs, and is equal to the upstream pressure P1. 3 The flow section is horizontal (or the elevation difference across the 
expansion section is negligible). 4 The flow is turbulent, and the effects of kinetic energy and momentum-flux correction 
factors are negligible,   1 and   1. 
Properties 
We take the density of water to be  = 1000 kg/m3.   
Analysis 
We designate the cross-section where expansion occurs by x. We choose cross-section 1 in the smaller 
diameter pipe shortly before x, and section 2 in the larger diameter pipe shortly after x. We take the region occupied by the 
fluid between cross-sections 1 and 2 as the control volume, with an inlet at 1 and exit at 2. The velocity, pressure, and 
cross-sectional area are V1, P1, and A1 at cross-section 1, and V2, P2, and A2 at cross-section 2. We assume the pressure 
along the cross-section x to be P1 so that Px = P1. Then the continuity, momentum, and energy equations applied to the 
control volume become

At a discharge into a large reservoir, all the kinetic energy is wasted as heat.

Solution 
The piping system of a geothermal district heating system is being designed. The pipe diameter that will 
optimize the initial system cost and the energy cost is to be determined. 
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The entrance effects are negligible, and thus the flow is fully 
developed. 3 The minor losses are negligible because of the large length-to-diameter ratio and the relatively small number 
of components that cause minor losses, the only significant energy loss arises from pipe friction. 4 The piping system is 
horizontal. 5 The properties of geothermal water are the same as fresh water. 6 The friction factor is constant at the given 
value. 7 The interest rate, the inflation rate, and the salvage value of the system are all zero. 8 The flow rate through the 
system remains constant. 
Properties 
We take the density of water to be  = 1000 kg/m3. The friction factor is given to be f = 0.015.  
Analysis 
The system operates in a loop, and thus we can take any point in the system as points 1 and 2 (the same 
point), and thus  z1 = z2, V1 = V2, and P1 = P2. Then the energy equation for this piping system simplifies to

That is, the pumping power is to be used to overcome the head losses due to friction in flow.  When the minor losses are

Note that the pumping power requirement is proportional to f and L, consistent with our intuitive expectation.  Perhaps not 
so obvious is that power is proportional to the cube of  flow rate. The fact that the power  is inversely proportional to pipe 
diameter D to the fifth power averages that a slight increase in pipe diameter will manifest as a tremendous reduction in 
power dissipation due to friction in a long pipeline.  Substituting the given values and expressing the diameter D in meters,

This is the optimum pipe diameter that minimizes the total cost of the system under stated assumptions. A larger 
diameter pipe will increase the system cost more than it decreases the energy cost, and a smaller diameter pipe will increase 
the system cost more than it decreases the energy cost. 
 
Discussion 
The assumptions of zero interest and zero inflation are not realistic, and an actual economic analysis must 
consider these factors as they have a major effect on the pipe diameter. This is done by considering the time value of 
money, and expressing all the costs at the same time. Pipe purchase is a present cost, and energy expenditures are future 
annual costs spread out over the project lifetime.  Thus, to provide consistent dollar comparisons between initial and future 
costs, all future energy costs must be expressed as a single present lump sum to reflect the time-value of money.  Then we 
can compare pipe and energy costs on a consistent basis. Economists call the necessary factor the “Annuity Present Value 
Factor”, F.  If interest rate is 10% per year with n = 30 years, then F = 9.427. Thus, if power costs $1,000,000/year for the 
next 30 years, then the present value of those future payments is $9,427,000 (and not $30,000,000!) if money is worth 10%.  
Alternatively, if you must pay $1,000,000 every year for 30 years, and you can today invest $9,437,000 at 10%, then you 
can meet 30 years of payments at the end of each year. The energy cost in this case can be determined by dividing the 
energy cost expression developed above by 9.427.  This will result in a pipe diameter of D = 2.5 m. In an actual design, we 
also need to calculate the average flow velocity and the pressure head to make sure that they are reasonable. For a pipe

Solution 
Water is drained from a large reservoir through two pipes connected in series at a specified rate using a 
pump. The required pumping head and the minimum pumping power are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The pipes are horizontal. 3 The entrance effects are negligible, 
and thus the flow is fully developed. 4 The flow is turbulent so that the tabulated value of the loss coefficients can be used. 
5 The pipes involve no components such as bends, valves, and other connectors that cause additional minor losses. 6 The 
reservoir is open to the atmosphere so that the pressure is atmospheric pressure at the free surface. 7 The water level in the 
reservoir remains constant. 8 The effect of the kinetic energy correction factor is negligible,  = 1. 
Properties 
The density and dynamic viscosity of water at 15C are  = 999.1 kg/m3 and  = 1.13810-3 kg/ms. The 
loss coefficient is KL = 0.5 for a sharp-edged entrance. The roughness of cast iron pipes is  = 0.00026 m.  
Analysis 
We take point 1 at the free surface of the tank, and point 2 and the reference level at the centerline of the 
pipe (z2 = 0). Noting that the fluid at both points is open to the atmosphere (and thus P1 = P2 = Patm) and that the fluid 
velocity at the free surface of the tank is very low  (V1  0), the energy equation for a control volume between these two 
points (in terms of heads) simplifies to

and the summation is over two pipes. Noting that the two pipes are connected in series and thus the flow rate through each 
of them is the same, the head loss for each pipe is determined as follows (we designate the first pipe by 1 and the second

It gives f2 = 0.03309. The second pipe involves no minor losses. Note that we do not consider the exit loss unless the exit

Therefore, the pump must supply a minimum of 53.7 kW of useful mechanical energy to water.   
 
Discussion 
Note that the shaft power of the pump must be greater than this to account for the pump inefficiency, and 
the electrical power supplied must be even greater to account for the motor inefficiency.

Solution 
In the previous problem, the effect of second pipe diameter on required pumping head for the same flow 
rate is to be investigated by varying the pipe diameter from 1 cm to 10 cm in increments of 1 cm.

Discussion 
Clearly, the power decreases quite rapidly with increasing diameter. This is not surprising, since the 
irreversible frictional head loss (major head loss) decreases significantly with increasing pipe diameter.

Solution 
Two pipes of identical diameter and material are connected in parallel. The length of one of the pipes is 
three times the length of the other. The ratio of the flow rates in the two pipes is to be determined. 
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The flow is fully turbulent in both pipes and thus the friction 
factor is independent of the Reynolds number (it is the same for both pipes since they have the same material and diameter). 
3 The minor losses are negligible.  
Analysis 
When two pipes are parallel in a piping system, the head loss for each pipe must be same. When the minor 
losses are disregarded, the head loss for fully developed flow in a pipe of length L and diameter D can be expressed as

When the pipe diameter, friction factor, and the head loss is constant, which is the case here for parallel connection, the 
flow rate becomes inversely proportional to the square root of length L. Therefore, when the length is tripled, the flow rate 
will decrease by a factor of 30.5 = 1.73 since

Therefore, the ratio of the flow rates in the two pipes is 0.447. 
 
Discussion 
Even though one pipe is three times as long as the other, the volume flow rate in the shorter pipe is not three 
times as much – the relationship is nonlinear.

Solution 
A pipeline that transports oil at a specified rate branches out into two parallel pipes made of commercial 
steel that reconnects downstream. The flow rates through each of the parallel pipes are to be determined. 
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 Entrance effects are negligible, and thus the flow is fully 
developed. 3 Minor losses are disregarded. 4 Flows through both pipes are turbulent (to be verified).  
Properties 
The density and dynamic viscosity of oil at 40C are  = 876 kg/m3 and  = 0.2177 kg/ms. The roughness 
of commercial steel pipes is  = 0.000045 m. 
Analysis 
This problem cannot be solved directly since the velocities (or flow rates) in the pipes are not known. 
Below we will set up the equations to be solved by an equation solver. The head loss in two parallel branches must be the 
same, and the total flow rate must the sum of the flow rates in the parallel branches. Therefore,

This problem can also be solved by using an iterative approach, but it would be very time consuming.

parallel pipes made of commercial steel that reconnects downstream. The flow rates through each of the parallel pipes are 
to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The entrance effects are negligible, and thus the flow is fully 
developed. 3 The minor losses are given to be negligible. 4 Flows through both pipes are turbulent (to be verified).  
Properties 
The density and dynamic viscosity of water at 100C are  = 957.9 kg/m3 and  = 0.28210-3 kg/ms. The 
roughness of commercial steel pipes is  = 0.000045 m. 
Analysis 
This problem cannot be solved directly since the velocities (or flow rates) in the pipes are not known. 
Below we will set up the equations to be solved by an equation solver. The head loss in two parallel branches must be the 
same, and the total flow rate must the sum of the flow rates in the parallel branches. Therefore,

Discussion 
This problem can also be solved by using a trial-and-error approach, but it will be very time consuming. 
Equation solvers such as EES are invaluable for these kinds of problems.

Solution 
A system that concsists of two interconnected cylindrical tanks is used to determine the discharge 
coefficient of a short 5-mm diameter orifice. For given initial fluid heights and discharge time, the discharge coefficient of 
the orifice is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The fluid is incompressible. 2 The entire systems, 
including the connecting flow section, is horizontal. 3 The discharge 
coefficient remains constant (in reality, it may change since the flow 
velocity and thus the Reynolds number changes during flow). 4 Losses 
other than the ones associated with flow through the orifice are negligible. 5 
The effect of the kinetic energy correction factor is negligible,  = 1. 
Analysis 
We take point 1 at the free surface of water in Tank 1, and 
point 0 at the exit of the orifice. We take the centerline of the orifice as the 
reference level (z1 = h1 and z0 = 0). Noting that the fluid at point 1is open to 
the atmosphere (and thus P1 = Patm and P0 = Patm + gh2) and that the fluid 
velocity at the free surface is very low  (V1  0), the Bernoulli equation 
between these two points gives

 is the vertical distance between the water levels in the two tanks at any time t. Note that h1,  h2,  h, and V0 
are all variable (h1 decreases while h2 and h increase during discharge.    
 
Noting that the fluid is a liquid ( = constant) and keeping the conservation of mass in mind and the definition of 
the discharge coefficient Cd, the flow rate through the orifice can be expressed as

Solution 
Air compressed by a large compressor is transported through a galvanized steel pipe. The pressure drop and 
the power wasted in the compressed air line are to be determined.  
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The entrance effects are negligible, and thus the flow is fully 
developed. 3 Minor losses other than those associated with elbows are disregarded. 4 There are no pumps or turbines in the 
compressed air line.   
Properties 
The roughness of galvanized steel pipe is given to be  = 0.00015 m. The dynamic viscosity of air at 60C is 
 = 2.00810-5 kg/ms, and it is independent of pressure. The density of air listed in that table is for 1 atm. The density at 
20°C, 100 kPa and 60°C, 900 kPa can be determined from the ideal gas relation to be

Therefore, 0.125 kW of the 300 kW consumed by the compressor is expended in the compressed air line. 
Discussion 
Despite the long transportation line and several turns, the power losses are very small in this case because of 
the large diameter of the pipe. It can be shown that the power wasted in the compressed air line would be 3.83 kW – a 
nearly 30-fold increase – if the pipe diameter was reduced by half.

Air compressed by a large compressor is transported through a galvanized steel pipe. It is to be investigated 
if it is worthwhile to double the pipe diameter to reduce the pressure and power losses in the compressed air line

Therefore, the wasted power goes down from 0.125 kW to 0.0049 kW – a reduction of 0.120 kW. Assuming the extreme 
case of compressor operating non-stop at full capacity year around and a unit cost of $0.10/kWh for electricity, the annual 
power and cost savings would be 
 
Electric power savings = (0.120 kW)(8760 h) = 1050 kWh 
 
Cost savings = (1050 kWh)($0.10/kWh) = $105 
Discussion 
For annual cost savings of about $100, doubling the pipe diameter would probably NOT be worthwhile 
because of the large cost increases associated with doubling the pipe diameter. This conclusion can be verified using typical 
pipeline construction costs.

Solution 
A water fountain is to be installed at a remote location by attaching a cast iron pipe directly to a water main. 
For a specified flow rate, the minimum diameter of the piping system is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The entrance effects are negligible, and thus the flow is fully 
developed and the friction factor is constant for the entire pipe. 3 The pressure at the water main remains constant. 4  There 
are no dynamic pressure effects at the pipe-water main connection, and the pressure at the pipe entrance is 60 psia. 5 
Elevation difference between the pipe and the fountain is negligible (z2 = z1) . 6 The effect of the kinetic energy correction 
factor is negligible,  = 1. 
Properties 
The density and dynamic viscosity of water at 70F are  = 62.30 lbm/ft3 and  = 2.360 lbm/fth = 
6.55610-4 lbm/fts. The roughness of cast iron pipe is  = 0.00085 ft. The minor loss coefficient is KL = 0.5 for a sharp-
edged entrance, KL = 1.1 for a 90 miter bend without vanes, KL = 0.2 for a fully open gate valve, and KL = 5 for an angle 
valve. 
Analysis 
We choose point 1 in the water main near the entrance where the pressure is 60 psig and the velocity in the 
pipe to be low. We also take point 1 as the reference level. We take point 2 at the exit of the water fountain where the 
pressure is the atmospheric pressure (P2 = Patm) and the velocity is the discharge velocity. The energy equation for a control 
volume between these two points is

Therefore, the diameter of the pipe must be at least 0.713 in.

The pipe diameter can also be determined approximately by using the Swamee and Jain relation.

Solution 
In a hydroelectric power plant, the flow rate of water, the available elevation head, and the combined 
turbine-generator efficiency are given.  The electric power output of the plant is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The entrance effects are negligible, and thus the flow is fully 
developed and the friction factor is constant for the entire pipe. 3 The minor losses are given to be negligible. 4 The water 
level in the reservoir remains constant. 
Properties 
The density and dynamic viscosity of water at 20C are  = 998 kg/m3 and  = 1.00210-3 kg/ms. The 
roughness of cast iron pipes is  = 0.00026 m. 
Analysis 
We take point 1 at the free surface of the reservoir, and point 2 and the reference level at the free surface of 
the water leaving the turbine site (z2 = 0). Noting that the fluid at both points is open to the atmosphere (and thus P1 = P2 = 
Patm) and that the fluid velocities at both points are very low  (V1  V2  0), the energy equation for a control volume 
between these two points (in terms of heads) simplifies to

Discussion 
Note that a perfect turbine-generator would generate 700 kW of electricity from this resource. The power 
generated by the actual unit is only 560 kW because of the inefficiencies of the turbine and the generator. Also note that 
about 15 percent of the elevation head is lost in piping due to pipe friction.

Solution 
In a hydroelectric power plant, the flow rate of water, the available elevation head, and the combined 
turbine-generator efficiency are given.  The percent increase in the electric power output of the plant is to be determined 
when the pipe diameter is tripled. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 Entrance effects are negligible, and thus the flow is fully 
developed and friction factor is constant. 3 Minor losses are negligible. 4 Water level is constant. 
Properties 
The density and dynamic viscosity of water at 20C are  = 998 kg/m3 and  = 1.00210-3 kg/ms. The 
roughness of cast iron pipes is  = 0.00026 m.

We take point 1 at the free surface of the reservoir, and point 2 and the reference level at the free surface of 
the water leaving the turbine site (z2 = 0). Noting that the fluid at both points is open to the atmosphere (and thus P1 = P2 = 
Patm) and that the fluid velocities at both points are very low  (V1  V2  0), the energy equation for a control volume 
between these two points (in terms of heads) simplifies to

Solution 
The drinking water needs of an office are met by siphoning water through a plastic hose inserted into a large 
water bottle. The time it takes to fill a glass when the bottle is first opened and when it is empty are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The entrance effects are negligible, and thus the flow is fully 
developed and the friction factor is constant for the entire pipe. 3 The on/off switch is fully open during filing. 4 The water 
level in the bottle remains nearly constant during filling. 5 The flow is turbulent (to be verified). 6 The effect of the kinetic 
energy correction factor is negligible,  = 1. 
Properties 
The density and dynamic viscosity of water at 70F are  = 62.30 lbm/ft3 and  = 2.360 lbm/fth = 
6.55610-4 lbm/fts. The plastic pipes are considered to be smooth, and thus their roughness is  = 0. The total minor loss 
coefficient is given to be 2.8.  
Analysis 
We take point 1 to be at the free surface of water in the bottle, and point 2 at the exit of the hose., which is 
also taken to be the reference level (z2 = 0). Noting that the fluid at both points is open to the atmosphere (and thus P1 = P2 
= Patm) and that the fluid velocity at the free surface is very low  (V1  0), the energy equation for a control volume between 
these two points (in terms of heads) simplifies to

These are 6 equations in the 6 unknowns of V2, V, hL, Re,  f, and t, and solving them simultaneously using an equation

Case (a): The bottle is full and thus  z1 = 3+1 = 4 ft: 
V2 = 5.185 ft/s,       hL = 3.58 ft,  V= 0.00346 ft3/s,    Re = 14,370,   f = 0.02811, and t = 2.4 s 
 
Case (b): The bottle is almost empty and thus  z1 = 3 ft: 
V2 =4.436 ft/s,       hL = 2.69 ft,  V= 0.00296 ft3/s,    Re = 12,290,   f = 0.02926, and t = 2.8 s 
Note that the flow is turbulent for both cases since Re > 4000.  
Discussion 
The filling time of the glass increases as the water level in the bottle drops, as expected.

Discussion 
The required time decreases considerably as the tube diameter increases. This is because the irreversible 
frictional head loss (major loss) in the tube decreases greatly as tube diameter increases. In addition, the minor loss is 
proportional to V 2. Thus, as tube diameter increases, V decreases, and even the minor losses decrease.

Discussion 
The filling times in Prob. 8-129E were 2.4 s and 2.8 s, respectively. Therefore, doubling the tube length

Solution 
A water tank open to the atmosphere is initially filled with water. The tank is drained to the atmosphere 
through a 90 horizontal bend of negligible length. The flow rate is to be determined for the cases of the bend being a 
flanged smooth bend and a miter bend without vanes. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The flow is turbulent so that the tabulated value of the loss 
coefficient can be used. 3 The water level in the tank remains constant. 4 The length of the bend and thus the frictional loss 
associated with its length is negligible. 5 The entrance is well-rounded, and the entrance loss is negligible.   
Properties 
The loss coefficient is KL = 0.3 for a flanged smooth bend and KL = 1.1 for a miter bend without vanes. 
Analysis 
(a) We take point 1 at the free surface of the tank, and point 2 at the exit of the bend, which is also taken as 
the reference level (z2 = 0). Noting that the fluid at both points is open to the atmosphere (and thus P1 = P2 = Patm) and that 
the fluid velocity at the free surface is very low  (V1  0), the energy equation for a control volume between these two 
points (in terms of heads) simplifies to

Discussion 
Note that the type of bend used has a significant effect on the flow rate, and a conscious effort should be 
made when selecting components in a piping system.  If the effect of the kinetic energy correction factor is neglected, 2 = 1 
and the flow rates become

Therefore, the effect of the kinetic energy correction factor is (12.9 - 12.7)/12.7 = 1.6% and (10.2 – 10.0)/10.0 = 2.0%, 
which is negligible.

Solution 
A swimming pool is initially filled with water. A pipe with a well-rounded entrance at the bottom drains the 
pool to the atmosphere. The initial rate of discharge from the pool and the time required to empty the pool completely are to 
be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is uniform and incompressible. 2 The draining pipe is horizontal. 3 The entrance effects are 
negligible, and thus the flow is fully developed. 4 The friction factor remains constant (in reality, it changes since the flow 
velocity and thus the Reynolds number changes during flow). 5 The effect of the kinetic energy correction factor is 
negligible,  = 1.  
Properties 
The density and dynamic viscosity of water at 20C are  = 998 kg/m3 and  = 1.00210-3 kg/ms. The 
friction factor of the pipe is given to be 0.022. Plastic pipes are considered to be smooth, and their surface roughness is  = 
0.  
Analysis 
We take point 1 at the free surface of the pool, and point 2 and the reference level at the exit of the pipe (z2 
= 0), and take the positive direction of z to be upwards. Noting that the fluid at both points is open to the atmosphere (and 
thus P1 = P2 = Patm) and that the fluid velocity at the free surface is very low  (V1  0), the energy equation for a control 
volume between these two points (in terms of heads) simplifies to

It gives f = 0.0184. Therefore, the given value of 0.022 is not so accurate. Repeating calculations with this value gives 22.7 
h, which is about 8% in error. 
Discussion 
It can be shown by setting L = 0 that the draining time without the pipe is only about 7.1 h. Therefore, the 
pipe in this case increases the draining time by about a factor of 3.5.

Solution 
In the previous problem, the effect of the discharge pipe diameter on the time required to empty the pool 
completely is to be investigated by varying the pipe diameter from 1 cm to 10 cm in increments of 1 cm.

Solution 
A swimming pool is initially filled with water. A pipe with a sharp-edged entrance at the bottom drains the 
pool to the atmosphere. The initial rate of discharge from the pool and the time required to empty the pool completely are to 
be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is uniform and incompressible. 2 The draining pipe is horizontal. 3 The flow is turbulent so that 
the tabulated value of the loss coefficient can be used. 4 The friction factor remains constant (in reality, it changes since the 
flow velocity and thus the Reynolds number changes during flow). 5 The effect of the kinetic energy correction factor is 
negligible,  = 1. 
Properties 
The density and dynamic viscosity of water at 20C are  = 998 kg/m3 and  = 1.00210-3 kg/ms. The loss 
coefficient for the sharp-edged entrance is KL = 0.5. Plastic pipes are considered to be smooth, and their surface roughness 
is  = 0.  
Analysis 
We take point 1 at the free surface of the pool, and point 2 and the reference level at the exit of the pipe (z2 
= 0), and take the positive direction of z to be upwards.  Noting that the fluid at both points is open to the atmosphere (and 
thus P1 = P2 = Patm) and that the fluid velocity at the free surface is very low (V1  0), the energy equation for a control 
volume between these two points (in terms of heads) simplifies to

Solution  
A bypass graft was attached to a coronary artery that was 75% blocked by atherosclerotic plaque.  These 
two “pipes” are effectively connected in parallel.  The velocity in the gap created by the plaque in the coronary artery is to 
be determined. 
Assumptions  
1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 For simplicity, the flow is considered to be turbulent in both 
“pipes” and thus the friction factor is independent of Reynolds number and the friction factor is considered the same for 
both “pipes.”  3 The material properties for the graft and artery are the same.  4 Any minor losses are negligible.  5 The 
plaque gap is cylindrical. 
Analysis   
When 2 pipes are parallel in a piping system like the human circulation, the head loss for each pipe must 
be the same.  Without any minor losses, the head losses for fully developed flow can be expressed as: 
 
For subscripts to be used in this solution, g is graft, c is coronary artery, and p is plaque.  Thus, the following variables are: 
 
 
 
Since the coronary artery and graft are in parallel, the head loss must be equal for both pipes. 
 
 
 
 
 
We know that

General and Mathematical Background Problems 
 
 
 
9-1C 
Solution 
We are to express the divergence theorem in words.  
 
Analysis 
For vector G

, the volume integral of the divergence of G

 over volume V is equal to the surface 
integral of the normal component of G

 taken over the surface A that encloses the volume. 
 
Discussion 
The divergence theorem is also called Gauss’s theorem. 
 
 
 
 
9-2C 
Solution 
We are to explain the fundamental differences between a flow domain and a control volume. 
 
Analysis 
A control volume is used in an integral, control volume solution. It is a volume over which all mass flow 
rates, forces, etc. are specified over the entire control surface of the control volume. In a control volume analysis we do not 
know or care about details inside the control volume. Rather, we solve for gross features of the flow such as net force acting 
on a body. A flow domain, on the other hand, is also a volume, but is used in a differential analysis. Differential 
equations of motion are solved everywhere inside the flow domain, and we are interested in all the details inside the flow 
domain. 
 
Discussion 
Note that we also need to specify what is happening at the boundaries of a flow domain – these are called 
boundary conditions. 
 
 
 
 
9-3C 
Solution 
We are to explain what we mean by coupled differential equations. 
 
Analysis 
A set of coupled differential equations simply means that the equations are dependent on each other and 
must be solved together rather than separately. For example, the equations of motion for fluid flow involve velocity 
variables in both the conservation of mass equation and the momentum equation. To solve for these variables, we must 
solve the coupled set of differential equations together. 
 
Discussion 
In some very simple fluid flow problems, the equations become uncoupled, and are easier to solve. 
 
 
 
 
9-4C 
Solution 
We are to discuss the number of unknowns and the equations needed to solve for those unknowns for a 
three-dimensional, unsteady, incompressible flow field. 
 
Analysis 
There are four unknowns (velocity components u, v, w, and pressure P) and thus we need to solve four 
equations: 
 
 
one from conservation of mass which is a scalar equation 
 
three from Newton’s second law which is a vector equation 
 
Discussion 
These equations are also coupled in general.

9-5C 
Solution 
We are to discuss the number of unknowns and the equations needed to solve for those unknowns for a two-
dimensional, unsteady, compressible flow field with significant variations in both temperature and density. 
 
Analysis 
There are five unknowns (velocity components u and v, and , T, and P) and thus we need to solve five 
equations: 
 
 
one from conservation of mass which is a scalar equation 
 
two from Newton’s second law which is a vector equation 
 
one from the energy equation which is a scalar equation 
 
one from an equation of state (e.g., ideal gas law) which is a scalar equation 
 
Discussion 
These equations are also coupled in general.

Solution 
We are to discuss the number of unknowns and the equations needed to solve for those unknowns for a two-
dimensional, unsteady, incompressible flow field. 
 
Analysis

equations: 
 
 
one from conservation of mass which is a scalar equation 
 
two from Newton’s second law which is a vector equation 
 
Discussion 
These equations are also coupled in general.

We are to transform a given set of Cartesian velocity components into cylindrical velocity components, and

Discussion 
The negative sign in Eq. 2 indicates that this vortex is in the clockwise direction.

Next we calculate the surface integral of the divergence theorem. There are six faces of the cube, and unit vector n points 
outward from each face. So, we split the area integral into six parts and sum them. E.g., the right-most face has n = (1,0,0), 
so G n

 = 4xz on this face. The bottom face has n = (0,–1,0), so G n

 = y2 on this face. The surface integral is then

Since Eq. 2 and Eq. 5 are equal, the divergence theorem works for this case. 
 
Discussion 
The integration is simple in this example since each face is flat and normal to an axis. In the general case in 
which the surface is curved, integration is much more difficult, but the divergence theorem always works.

Continuity Equation 
 
 
 
9-21C 
Solution 
We are to explain why the derivation of the continuity via the divergence theorem is so much less involved 
than the derivation of the same equation by summation of mass flow rates through each face of an infinitesimal control 
volume.  
 
Analysis 
In the derivation using the divergence theorem, we begin with the control volume form of conservation of 
mass, and simply apply the divergence theorem. The control volume form was already derived in Chap. 5, so we begin the 
derivation in this chapter with an established conservation of mass equation. On the other hand, the alternative 
derivation is from “scratch” and therefore requires much more algebra. 
 
Discussion 
The bottom line is that the divergence theorem enables us to quickly convert the control volume form of the 
conservation law into the differential form. 
 
 
 
 
 
9-22C 
Solution 
We are to discuss the material derivative of density for the case of compressible and incompressible flow. 
 
Analysis 
If the flow field is compressible, we expect that as a fluid particle (a material element) moves around in the 
flow, its density changes. Thus the material derivative of density (the rate of change of density following a fluid particle) is 
non-zero for compressible flow. However, if the flow field is incompressible, the density remains constant. As a fluid 
particle moves around in the flow, the material derivative of density must be zero for incompressible flow (no change in 
density following the fluid particle). 
 
Discussion 
The material derivative of any property is the rate of change of that property following a fluid particle.

Solution 
We are to repeat Example 9-1, but without using continuity.  
 
Assumptions 1 Density varies with time, but not space; in other words, the density is uniform throughout the cylinder at 
any given time, but changes with time. 2 No mass escapes from the cylinder during the compression. 
 
Analysis 
The mass inside the cylinder is constant, but the volume decreases linearly as the piston moves up. At t = 0 
when L = LBottom the initial volume of the cylinder is V(0) = LBottomA, where A is the cross-sectional area of the cylinder. At t 
= 0 the density is  = (0) = m/V(0), and thus

which is identical to Eq. 5 of Example 9-1.

We see by this exercise that the continuity equation is indeed an equation of conservation of mass.

We are to write the given equation as a word equation and discuss it. 
 
Analysis 
Here is a word equation: “The time rate of change of volume of a fluid particle per unit volume is equal 
to the divergence of the velocity field.” As a fluid particle moves around in a compressible flow, it can distort, rotate, and 
get larger or smaller. Thus the volume of the fluid element can change with time; this is represented by the left hand side of 
the equation. The right hand side is identically zero for an incompressible flow, but it is not zero for a compressible flow. 
Thus we can think of the volumetric strain rate as a measure of compressibility of a fluid flow. 
 
Discussion 
Volumetric strain rate is a kinematic property as discussed in Chap. 4. Nevertheless, it is shown here to be 
related to the continuity equation (conservation of mass).

Solution 
We are to verify that a given flow field satisfies the continuity equation, and we are to discuss conservation 
of mass at the origin.  
 
Analysis 
The 2-D cylindrical velocity components (ur,u) for this flow field are

The first term is zero because it is the derivative of a constant. The second term is zero because r is not a function of . The 
third term is zero since this is a 2-D flow with uz = 0. Thus, we verify that the incompressible continuity equation is 
satisfied for the given velocity field. 
 
At the origin, both ur and u go to infinity. Conservation of mass is not affected by u, but the fact that ur is non-
zero at the origin violates conservation of mass. We think of the flow along the z axis as a line sink toward which mass 
approaches from all directions in the plane and then disappears (like a black hole in two dimensions). Mass is not conserved 
at the origin. 
 
Discussion 
Singularities such as this are unphysical of course, but are nevertheless useful as approximations of real 
flows, as long as we stay away from the singularity itself.

Solution 
For given velocity component u and density , we are to predict velocity component v, plot an approximate 
shape of the duct, and predict its height at section (2). 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and two-dimensional in the x-y plane, but compressible. 2 Friction on the walls is 
ignored. 3 Axial velocity u and density  vary linearly with x. 4 The x axis is a line of top-bottom symmetry. 
Properties 
The fluid is standard air. The speed of sound is about 340 m/s, so the flow is subsonic, but compressible.

Since this is a partial integration, we add an arbitrary function of x instead

Since the flow is symmetric about the x axis (y = 0), v must equal zero at y = 
0 for any x. This is possible only if f(x) is identically zero. Applying f(x) = 
0, dividing by  to solve for v, and plugging in Eq. 2, Eq. 4 becomes

(b) For known values of u and v, we can plot streamlines between x = 0 and 
x = 2.0 m using the technique described in Chap. 4. Several streamlines are 
shown in Fig. 1. The streamline starting at x = 0, y = 0.8 m is the top wall of 
the duct. 
 
(c) At section (2), the top streamline crosses y = 1.70 m at x = 2.0 m. Thus, 
the predicted height of the duct at section (2) is 1.70 m. 
 
Discussion 
You can verify that the combination of Eqs. 1, 2, and 5 
satisfies the steady compressible continuity equation. However, this alone 
does not guarantee that the density and velocity components will actually 
follow these equations if this diverging duct were to be built. The actual 
flow depends on the pressure rise between sections (1) and (2) – only one 
unique pressure rise can yield the desired flow deceleration. Temperature 
may also change considerably in this kind of compressible flow field.

Stream Function 
 
 
 
9-39C 
Solution 
We are to discuss the significance of the difference in value of stream function from one streamline to 
another.  
 
Analysis 
The difference in the value of  from one streamline to another is equal to the volume flow rate per 
unit width between the two streamlines. 
 
Discussion 
This fact about the stream function can be used to calculate the volume flow rate in certain applications. 
 
 
 
 
 
9-40C 
Solution 
We are to discuss why the stream function is called a non-primitive variable in CFD lingo.  
 
Analysis 
The natural physical variables in a fluid flow problem are the velocity components and the pressure. [If the 
flow is compressible, density and temperature are also natural physical variables.] These variables can be considered 
“primitive” because we do not change them in any way – we simply solve for them directly. Stream function, on the other 
hand, is a contrived or derived variable. The stream function is not primitive in the sense that it is not one of the 
original physical variables in the problem. 
 
Discussion 
Vorticity is another example of a non-primitive variable. In fact, some 2-D CFD codes use stream function 
and vorticity as the variables – non-primitive variables. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
9-41C 
Solution 
We are to discuss the restrictions on the stream function that cause it to exactly satisfy 2-D incompressible 
continuity, and why they are necessary.  
 
Analysis 
Stream function  must be a smooth function of x and y (or r and ). These restrictions are necessary so 
that the second derivatives of  with respect to both variables are equal regardless of the order of differentiation. In other 
words, if 
2
2
x y
y x






, then the 2-D incompressible continuity equation is satisfied exactly by the definition of . 
 
Discussion 
If the stream function were not smooth, there would be sudden discontinuities in the velocity field as well – 
a physical impossibility that would violate conservation of mass. 
 
 
 
 
 
9-42C 
Solution 
We are to discuss the significance of curves of constant stream function, and why the stream function is 
useful.  
 
Analysis 
Curves of constant stream function represent streamlines of a flow. A stream function is useful because by 
drawing curves of constant , we can visualize the instantaneous velocity field. In addition, the change in the value of  
from one streamline to another is equal to the volume flow rate per unit width between the two streamlines. 
 
Discussion 
Streamlines are an instantaneous flow description, as discussed in Chap. 4.

Solution 
For a given velocity field we are to generate an expression for , and we are to calculate the volume flow 
rate per unit width between two streamlines.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The flow is incompressible. 3 The flow is two-dimensional in the x-y plane.

choose – the solution will be identical).

Constant C is arbitrary; it is common to set it to zero, although it can be set to any desired value. Here,  = 0 along

The streamlines themselves are straight, flat horizontal lines as seen by Eq. 1. We divide top by 10 to generate 
evenly spaced stream functions. We plot 11 streamlines in the figure (counting the streamlines on both walls) by 
plugging these values of  into Eq. 2.  The streamlines are not evenly spaced. This is because the volume flow 
rate per unit width between two streamlines 2 and 1 is equal to 2 – 1. The flow speeds near the top of the 
channel are higher than those near the bottom of the channel, so we expect the streamlines to be closer near the top. 
 
Discussion 
The extent of the x axis in the figure is arbitrary since the flow is fully developed. You can immediately see 
from a streamline plot like Fig. 1 where flow speeds are high and low (relatively speaking).

Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The flow is incompressible. 3 The flow is two-dimensional.

For 2-D incompressible flow the difference in the value of the stream function between two streamlines is 
equal to the volume flow rate per unit width between the two streamlines. Thus,

Notice that the streamlines inside the probe are more closely packed than are those outside the probe 
because the flow speed is higher inside the probe. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
9-53 
Solution 
We are to sketch streamlines for the case of a sampling 
probe with too little suction, and we are to name this type of sampling and 
label the lower and upper dividing streamlines. 
 
Analysis 
If the suction were too weak, the volume flow rate through 
the probe would be too low and the average air speed through the probe 
would be lower than that of the air stream. The dividing streamlines 
would diverge outward rather than inward as sketched in Fig. 1. We 
would call this type of sampling subisokinetic sampling. 
 
Discussion 
We have drawn the streamlines inside the probe further 
apart than those in the air stream because the flow speed is lower inside 
the probe.

We are to calculate the speed of the air stream of a previous problem.

By definition of streamlines, the volume flow rate between the two dividing streamlines must be the same as that through 
the probe itself. We know the volume flow rate through the probe from the results of the previous problem. The value of the 
stream function on the lower and upper dividing streamlines are the same as those of the previous problem, namely l = 
0.093 m2/s and u = 0.150 m2/s respectively. We also know yu – yl from the information given here. Thus, Eq. 1 yields

is not. In other words, this approximation does not satisfy the no-slip boundary condition along the cylinder surface. See 
Chap. 10 for a more detailed discussion about such approximations.

Solution 
We are to verify that the given  satisfies the continuity equation, and we are to discuss any restrictions. 
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The flow is incompressible. 3 The flow is axisymmetric ( is a function of r and z 
only).

Thus we see that continuity is satisfied by the given stream function. The only restriction on  is that  must be a 
smooth function of r and z. 
 
 
Discussion 
For a smooth function of two variables, the order of differentiation does not matter.

Solution 
For a given velocity field we are to generate an expression for .  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The flow is incompressible. 3 The flow is two-dimensional in the x-y plane.

choose – the solution will be identical).

where g(x) denotes dg/dx since g is a function of only one variable, x. We now have two expressions for velocity

You can verify by differentiating  that Eq. 5 yields the correct values of u and v.

Solution 
For a given stream function, we are to calculate the velocity components and verify incompressibility.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The flow is incompressible (this assumption is to be verified). 3 The flow is two-

We plot the streamlines in Fig. 1. For each value of  there are two curves 
– one for the positive root and one for the negative root of Eq. 2. There is 
symmetry about a diagonal line through the origin. The streamlines appear 
to be hyperbolae. We determine the flow direction by plugging in a couple 
values of x and y and calculating the velocity components; e.g., at x = 1 m 
and y = 3 m, u = 2.7 m/s and v = 4.9 m/s. The flow at this point is in the 
upper right direction. Similarly, at x = 1 m and y = -2 m, u = -3.3 m/s and 
v = -1.6 m/s. The flow at this point is in the lower left direction. 
 
Discussion 
This flow may not represent any particular physical flow 
field, but it produces an interesting flow pattern.

Solution 
We are to make up a stream function (x,y), calculate the velocity components and verify incompressibility.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The flow is incompressible. 3 The flow is two-dimensional in the x-y plane. 
 
Analysis 
Every student should have a different stream function. He or she then takes the derivatives with respect to y 
and x to find u and v. The student should then plug his/her velocity components into the incompressible continuity equation. 
Continuity will be satisfied regardless of (x,y), provided that (x,y) is a smooth function of x and y. 
 
Discussion 
As long as  is a smooth function of x and y, it automatically satisfies the continuity equation by its 
definition.

For the given values of constants a and b, we plot Eq. 6 for several values of  in Fig. 1; these curves of constant  are 
streamlines of the flow. Note that both the positive and negative roots of Eq. 6 are required to plot each streamline. The 
direction of the flow is found by calculating u and v at some point in the flow field. We pick x = 2 ft, y = 2 ft, where u = 
1.2 ft/s and v = 2.1 ft/s. This indicates flow to the lower left near this location. We fill in the rest of the arrows in Fig. 1 to 
be consistent. We see that the flow enters from the upper right, and splits into two parts – one to the lower right and one to 
the upper left. 
 
Discussion 
It is always a good idea to check your algebra. In this example, you should differentiate Eq. 5 to verify that 
the velocity components of the given equation are obtained.

Solution 
We are to calculate the axial speed at the entrance and exit of the nozzle, and we are to plot several 
streamlines for a given axisymmetric flow field.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The flow is incompressible. 3 The flow is axisymmetric ( is a function of r and z 
only). 
 
Analysis 
(a) Since uz is not a function of radius, the axial velocity profile across a cross section of the nozzle is 
uniform. (This is consistent with the assumption that frictional effects along the nozzle walls are neglected.) Thus, at any 
cross section the axial speed is equal to the volume flow rate divided by cross-sectional area,

At the nozzle entrance (z = 0), the wall is at r = Dentrance/2 = 0.25 inches. 
Eq. 3 yields wall = 0.0007073 ft3/s for the streamline that passes through 
this point. This streamline thus represents the shape of the nozzle wall, 
and we have designed the nozzle shape. 
 
 
Discussion 
You can verify that the diameter between the outermost 
streamlines varies from Dentrance to Dexit.

Solution 
We are to discuss the sign of the stream function in a separation bubble, and determine where  is a 
minimum.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The flow is incompressible. 3 The flow is two-dimensional in the x-y plane. 
 
Analysis 
For 2-D incompressible flow the difference in the value of 
the stream function between two streamlines is equal to the volume flow 
rate per unit width between the two streamlines. For example, upper – 0 
is positive and represents the volume flow rate per unit width between the 
wall and the uppermost streamline, The flow between these two 
streamlines is to the right. Likewise, the difference between  along the 
dividing streamline and  = 1 along a streamline in the upper part of the 
separation bubble must also be positive as sketched in Fig. 1. The arc-
shaped dividing streamline divides fluid within the separation bubble 
from fluid outside of the separation bubble. The stream function along 
this dividing streamline must be zero since it intersects the wall where  
= 0. The only way we can have flow to the right in the upper part of the 
separation bubble is if 1 is negative (Fig. 1). We conclude that for this 
problem, all streamlines within the separation bubble have negative 
values of stream function. The minimum value of  occurs in the 
center of the separation bubble as sketched in Fig. 1. 
 
Discussion 
We cannot conclude that  is always negative within a separation bubble, since we can add any arbitrary 
constant to all the  values, and it will not change the flow. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
9-68 
Solution 
We are to discuss how someone can interpret the relative speed of a flow based solely on contours of 
constant stream function.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The flow is incompressible. 
 
Analysis 
For 2-D incompressible flow the difference in the value of the stream function between two streamlines is 
equal to the volume flow rate per unit width between the two streamlines. Thus, if the streamlines are very close together, 
the speed of the fluid between them is large relative to locations where the same two streamlines are far apart. Professor 
Flows noticed a region in which the streamlines were very close together, implying high relative speed in that region 
of the flow. 
 
Discussion 
If the values of  on the contour plot are labeled, we can actually infer the fluid speed by measuring the 
distance between streamlines.

Solution 
For the given set of streamlines, we are to discuss how we can tell the relative speed of the fluid. 
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The flow is incompressible. 3 The flow is axisymmetric. 
 
Analysis 
As with 2-D flow, when streamlines that are initially equally spaced spread away from each other, 
it indicates that the flow speed has decreased in that region. Likewise, if the streamlines come closer together, the 
flow speed has increased in that region. From the figure provided in the problem statement, we infer that the flow 
far upstream of the plate is straight and uniform, since the streamlines are parallel. The fluid decelerates as it 
approaches the front face of the cylinder, especially near the stagnation point, as indicated by the wide gap between 
streamlines. The flow accelerates rapidly to very high speeds around the corner of the cylinder as indicated by the 
tightly spaced streamlines there. The flow is seen to separate on top of the cylinder. Since the streamlines are very 
sparse in this region, we infer that the fluid moves relatively slowly inside the separation bubble. 
 
Discussion 
Such analyses in axisymmetric flow fields are more difficult than those in 2-D planar flow fields because 
streamlines of equally spaced stream function are not spaced equally apart in a uniform axisymmetric flow field. This is due 
to the fact that the cross-sectional area between streamlines increases with radius (a factor of 2r is introduced). 
Nevertheless, we can still tell where the flow speeds up and slows down in this example. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
9-70E  
Solution 
We are to interpret a streamline plot by determining the 
direction of flow and by estimating the speed of the flow at a point.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The flow is incompressible 3 The 
flow is two-dimensional. 
 
Analysis 
(a) We must tilt our heads nearly upside down to see an 
increase in stream function  in the mathematically positive manner. In 
other words, since  increases in the downward direction, the flow is to 
the lower left, following our left side rule. Arrows are drawn in Fig. 1. 
 
(b) For 2-D incompressible flow the difference in the value of the stream 
function between two streamlines is equal to the volume flow rate per unit 
width between the two streamlines. We approximate the flow as uniform between the two labeled streamlines in the figure 
provided in the problem statement. The speed at point P is thus

(c) Nowhere did we use any property of the fluid, so changing to water does not change our result. For either air or water

Discussion 
Streamlines and stream functions are kinematic properties, as discussed in Chap. 4. That is why fluid 
density, viscosity, etc. are irrelevant here.

Solution 
We are to interpret a streamline plot by determining the direction of flow and by estimating the speed of the 
flow at a point.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The flow is incompressible 3 The flow is two-dimensional. 
 
Analysis 
(a) We can tell the direction of the flow by whether  increases or decreases in the vertical direction (left 
side rule). We see that at points A and B the flow is to the right. Furthermore, since the streamlines near point B are 
somewhat further apart than those near point A (by a factor of about 1.6), the speed at point A is a factor of about 1.6 
greater than that at point B. Arrows are drawn in Fig. 1. 
 
 
 
In terms of lift, it is obvious that the flow speeds near the upper surface of the hydrofoil are greater than those near the 
lower surface. From the Bernoulli equation we know that low speeds lead to (relatively) higher pressures; thus the pressure 
on the lower half of the hydrofoil is greater than that on the upper half, leading to lift. 
 
(b) For 2-D incompressible flow the difference in the value of the stream function between two streamlines is equal to the 
volume flow rate per unit width between the two streamlines. We approximate the flow as uniform between the two 
streamlines that enclose point A in Fig. P9-70. By measurement with a ruler, we find that the distance  between 
streamlines 1.65 and 1.66 is about 0.034c, or about (0.034)(9.0 mm) = 0.306 mm. The speed at point A is thus

Solution 
We are to interpret a streamline plot by determining the direction of flow and by estimating the speed of the 
flow at a point.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady (time-averaged). 2 The flow is incompressible 3 The flow is two-dimensional. 
 
Properties 
The density of air at T = 20oC is 1.18 kg/m3. 
 
Analysis 
(a) We can tell the direction of the flow by whether  
increases or decreases in the vertical direction (left side rule). We see that 
at point A, the flow is to the left, while at point B the flow is to the right. 
Furthermore, since the streamlines near point B are much closer together 
than those near point A (by a factor of about five), the speed at point B is 
a factor of about five greater than that at point A. Arrows are drawn in 
Fig. 1. 
 
(b) For 2-D incompressible flow the difference in the value of the 
compressible stream function between two streamlines is equal to the 
mass flow rate per unit width between the two streamlines. We 
approximate the flow as uniform between the two streamlines that 
enclose point B in Fig. P9-71. By measurement with a ruler, we find that 
the distance  between streamlines 5 and 6 is about h/10, or about 0.10 
m. The speed at point B is thus

Solution 
We are to determine the value of the stream function along the positive y axis and the negative x axis for the 
case of a line source at the origin.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The flow is incompressible. 3 The flow is two-dimensional in the x-y or r- plane. 
 
Analysis 
For 2-D incompressible flow the difference in the value of the stream function between two streamlines is 
equal to the volume flow rate per unit width between the two streamlines. Let us take the arc of the circle of radius r 
between the positive x axis and the positive y axis of the figure provided with the problem statement. The volume flow rate 
per unit width through this arc is one-fourth of 
/ L
V
, the total volume flow rate per unit width, since the arc spans exactly 
one-fourth of the circumference of the circle.

We are to determine the value of the stream function along the positive y axis and the negative x axis for the 
case of a line sink at the origin.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The flow is incompressible. 3 The flow is two-dimensional in the x-y or r- plane. 
 
Analysis 
Everything is the same as in Problem 9-59 except that the flow direction is reversed everywhere. The 
volume flow rate per unit width through the arc of radius r between the positive x axis and the positive y axis of Fig. P9-59 
is now negative one-fourth of

Linear Momentum Equation, Boundary Conditions, and Applications

Solution 
We are to define mechanical pressure and discuss its application.  
 
Analysis 
Mechanical pressure is the mean normal stress acting inwardly on a fluid element. For an 
incompressible fluid, the density is constant and therefore we have no equation of state available for calculation of the 
thermodynamic pressure. In fact, thermodynamic pressure cannot even be defined for an incompressible fluid. Fluid 
elements and surfaces still “feel” a pressure, however, and this pressure is the so-called mechanical pressure. 
 
Discussion 
When dealing with incompressible fluid flows, pressure variable P is always interpreted as the mechanical 
pressure Pm.  
 
 
 
 
 
9-79C 
Solution 
We are to describe the constitutive equations and name the equation to which they are applied.  
 
Analysis 
The constitutive equations are relationships between the components of the stress tensor and the 
primary unknowns of the problem, namely pressure and velocity. The constitutive equations enable us to write the 
components of the stress tensor in Cauchy’s equation in terms of the velocity field and the pressure field. 
 
Discussion 
Cauchy’s equation by itself is useless without the constitutive equations, because we would have too many 
unknowns for the number of available equations.  
 
 
 
 
 
9-80C 
Solution 
We are to discuss velocity boundary conditions in a stationary and a moving frame of reference for the case 
of an airplane flying through the air.  
 
Analysis 
(a) From the stationary frame of reference, V

airplane
V

 on all surfaces of the airplane, (no-slip boundary 
condition). Far from the airplane the air is still (V

 = 0). 
 
(b) From the reference frame moving with the airplane, V

 = 0 on all surfaces, (no-slip boundary condition). Far from the 
airplane the air is moving towards the airplane at a speed that is opposite the airplane’s speed (V

 = 
airplane
V

). 
 
Discussion 
The no-slip condition requires that the fluid velocity equal the airplane velocity everywhere on the airplane 
surface, regardless of the geometry of the airplane, and regardless of the frame of reference.

Solution 
We are to discuss the difference between Newtonian fluids and non-Newtonian fluids, and we are to give 
examples of each. 
 
Analysis 
The main distinction between a Newtonian fluid and a non-Newtonian fluid is that for flow of a Newtonian 
fluid, shear stress is linearly proportional to shear strain rate, whereas for flow of a non-Newtonian fluid, the 
relationship between shear stress and shear strain rate is nonlinear. 
 
There are many examples of Newtonian fluids. Most pure, common liquids like water, oil, gasoline, alcohol, etc. 
are Newtonian. Most gases also behave like Newtonian fluids. Non-newtonian fluids include paint, pastes and creams, 
polymer solutions, cake batter, slurries and colloidal suspensions like quicksand, blood, etc. 
 
Discussion 
The Navier-Stokes equations apply only to Newtonian fluids. For non-Newtonian fluids, you would need to 
insert nonlinear constitutive equations into Cauchy’s equations in order to obtain a useful differential equation for 
conservation of linear momentum. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
9-82C 
Solution 
We are to define or describe each type of fluid. 
 
Analysis  
(a) A viscoelastic fluid is a fluid that returns (either fully or partially) to its original shape after the applied stress is 
released. 
(b) A pseudoplastic fluid is a shear thinning fluid  the more the fluid is sheared, the less viscous it becomes. 
(c) A dilatant fluid is a shear thickening fluid  the more the fluid is sheared, the more viscous it becomes. 
(d) A Bingham plastic fluid is an extreme type of pseudoplastic fluid that requires a finite stress called the yield 
stress in order for the fluid to flow at all. 
 
Discussion 
All of the above are examples of non-Newtonian fluids. 
 
 
 
 
 
9-83C 
Solution 
We are to discuss each term, and write the equation as a word equation.  
 
Analysis 
Term I is the net body force acting on the control volume. Term II is the net surface force acting on 
the control volume. Term III is the net rate of change of linear momentum within the control volume. Term IV is the 
net rate of outflow of linear momentum through the control surface. In words, the equation can be expressed as: “The 
total force acting on the control volume is the sum of body forces and surface forces, and is equal to the rate at 
which momentum changes within the control volume plus the rate at which momentum flows out of the control 
volume.” 
 
Discussion 
The dimensions of each term in the equation are those of momentum per time. Each term has primary 
dimensions of {mLt2}.

Solution 
We are to generate and discuss velocity and pressure boundary conditions for the given flow problem.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 Surface tension effects are negligibly small. 
 
Analysis 
We must satisfy the no-slip boundary condition on all tank walls, 
liquid
V

 = 
tank
V

. Mathematically, we write ur 
= uz = 0 and u = R at r = R (the tank side walls). We also write ur = uz = 0 and u = r at z = 0 (the bottom wall of the 
tank). We do not specify the pressure along the tank walls. At the free surface P = Patm since the free surface is exposed to 
atmospheric air. In addition, the vertical and radial components of velocity uz and ur must equal zero at the free surface, 
but the angular velocity component u is set to u = r at the free surface. We also know that the shear stress at free 
surface must be zero (negligible shear due to the air). This boundary condition is not needed however since we already 
know the velocity field. In fact, the velocity field is known right from the start since we are told that the liquid is in solid 
body rotation: uz = ur = 0 and u = r everywhere. 
 
Discussion 
This is a degenerate case of the Navier-Stokes equation since the fluid is in solid body rotation. 
Nevertheless, it is useful to think about the required boundary conditions.

Solution 
We are to estimate the volume flow rate of oil between two plates, and we are to calculate the Reynolds 
number.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The oil is incompressible. 3 Since the gap is so small compared to the plate 
dimensions, we assume 2-D flow in the x-y plane. 4 We ignore entrance effects and end effects and assume that the flow 
can be approximated as fully developed channel flow everywhere in the gap. 
 
Properties 
The viscosity and density of unused engine oil at T = 60oC are 72.5  10-3 kg/(ms) and 864 kg/m3 
respectively.

For a given velocity field, we are to calculate the pressure field.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The flow is incompressible. 3 The flow is two-dimensional in the x-y plane. 4 
Gravity does not act in either the x or the y plane.

The flow field must satisfy the steady, two-dimensional, incompressible continuity and momentum 
equations. We check each equation separately; let’s consider continuity first:

Equation 4 shows that indeed, P is a smooth function of x and y. Thus, we should be able to calculate the pressure field. To

respect to x) to obtain an expression for P(x,y),

For practice, you should differentiate Eq. 8 with respect to both x and y, and compare to Eqs. 2 and 3. (This 
also serves as a check of our algebra.) In addition, try to obtain Eq. 8 by starting with Eq. 3 rather than Eq. 2; you should 
get the same answer. Pressure is found to within some arbitrary constant C since the absolute magnitude of pressure is 
irrelevant; only pressure gradients are important.

Since the cross-derivative terms in Eq. 4 do not match, P is not a smooth function of x and y. Thus, we are unable to 
calculate a steady, incompressible, two-dimensional pressure field with the given velocity field. We cannot proceed 
any further. 
 
Discussion 
This problem shows that even if a velocity field satisfies the continuity equation (conservation of mass), and 
even if we can plot streamlines for the flow field, this does not necessarily guarantee that the velocity field is physically 
possible. In the present case, for instance, we are unable to find a pressure field that can satisfy the steady Navier-Stokes 
equation.

For a given velocity field, we are to calculate the pressure field.

The pressure field P(r,) must be a smooth function of r and . Mathematically, this requires that the order of 
differentiation (r then  versus  then r) should not matter. We therefore check whether this is so by differentiating Eqs. 2 
and 3 respectively:

Equation 4 shows that indeed, P is a smooth function of r and . Thus, we should be able to calculate the pressure field. 
 
To calculate P(r,), we start with either Eq. 2 or Eq. 3 and integrate. We pick Eq. 2, which we can partially 
integrate (with respect to ) to obtain an expression for P(r,),

Thus the pressure field for this flow decreases like 1/r2 as we approach the origin. (The origin itself is a singularity point.) 
This flow field is a simplistic model of a tornado or hurricane, and the low pressure at the center is the “eye of the storm”. 
We note that this flow field is irrotational, and thus Bernoulli’s equation can be used instead to calculate the pressure. If we 
call the pressure P far away from the origin (r  ), where the local velocity approaches zero, Bernoulli’s equation shows 
that at any distance r from the origin,

Equation 9 agrees with our solution (Eq. 8) from the full Navier-Stokes equation if we set constant C1 equal to P. A region 
of rotational flow near the origin would avoid the singularity there, and would yield a more physically realistic model of a 
real tornado. 
 
Discussion 
For practice, try to obtain Eq. 8 by starting with Eq. 3 rather than Eq. 2; you should get the same answer.

Since the cross-derivative terms in Eq. 4 do not match, P is not a smooth function of x and y. Thus, we are unable to 
calculate a steady, incompressible, two-dimensional pressure field with the given velocity field. We cannot proceed 
any farther – the pressure cannot be found with the given velocity field and restrictions. 
 
Discussion 
This problem shows that if a velocity field satisfies the continuity equation (conservation of mass), this does 
not necessarily guarantee that the velocity field is physically possible. In the present case, for instance, we are unable to 
find a pressure field that can satisfy the steady form of the Navier-Stokes equation.

Solution 
For a given geometry and set of boundary conditions, we are to calculate the velocity field, and plot the 
nondimensionalized velocity profile.  
 
Assumptions We number and list the assumptions for clarity: 
1 
The walls are infinite in the y-z plane (y is into the page). 
2 
The flow is steady, i.e. time derivatives of any quantity are zero. 
3 
The flow is parallel (the x component of velocity, u, is zero everywhere). 
4 
The fluid is incompressible and Newtonian, and the flow is laminar. 
5 
Pressure P = constant everywhere. In other words, there is no applied pressure gradient pushing the flow; the flow 
establishes itself due to a balance between gravitational forces and viscous forces. 
6 
The velocity field is purely two-dimensional, which implies that v = 0 and all y derivatives are zero. 
7 
Gravity acts in the negative z direction. We can express this mathematically as g
gk



, or gx = gy = 0 and gz = 
g. 
 
Analysis 
We obtain the velocity and pressure fields by following the step-by-step procedure for differential fluid 
flow solutions.  
 
Step 1 Set up the problem and the geometry. See problem statement. 
Step 2 List assumptions and boundary conditions. We have already listed seven assumptions. The boundary conditions 
come from the no-slip condition at the walls (1) at x = h/2, u = v = w = 0. (2) At x = h/2, u = v = w = 0. 
Step 3 Write out and simplify the differential equations. We start with the continuity equation in Cartesian coordinates,

Equation 1 tells us that w is not a function of z. In other words, it doesn’t matter where we place our origin – the flow is 
the same at any z location. In other words the flow is fully developed. Since w is not a function of time (Assumption 2), 
z (Eq. 1), or y (Assumption 6), we conclude that w is at most a function of x,

We now simplify each component of the Navier-Stokes equation as far as possible. Since u = v = 0 everywhere 
and gravity does not act in the x or y directions, the x and y momentum equations are satisfied exactly (in fact all terms 
are zero in both equations). The z momentum equation reduces to

We have changed from a partial derivative (/x) to a total derivative (d/dx) in Eq. 3 as a direct result of Eq. 2, 
reducing the PDE to an ODE.

Discussion 
Equation 4 for the z component of velocity is identical to that of Example 9-17. In fact, the present problem 
is identical to Example 9-17 except for the boundary conditions and the location of the origin. Comparing the two results, 
we see that the maximum nondimensional velocity for the case with two walls is one-fourth than that for the case with only 
one wall. This is not unexpected – the additional wall leads to more viscous forces that retard the flow.

Solution 
We are to calculate and compare the volume flow rate per unit width of fluid falling between two vertical 
walls and fluid falling along one vertical wall.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The flow is incompressible. 3 The walls are infinitely wide and very long so that all 
of the parallel flow, fully developed approximations of the previous problem hold.

We calculate the volume flow rate per unit width by integration of the velocity:

Comparing the two cases we see that 
/ L
V
 for the case of one vertical wall and a free surface is four times greater than 
the case of two vertical walls with no free surface. The physical explanation is that with two walls, the fluid is held back 
by more viscous stresses, leading to a parabolic velocity profile. For the single-wall case the free surface has no shear stress 
and thus the fluid flows more freely.  
 
Discussion 
The two flows being compared here are identical except for the boundary conditions. This illustrates the 
importance of setting proper boundary conditions.

Solution 
For a given geometry and set of boundary conditions, we are to calculate the velocity and pressure fields, 
and plot the nondimensional velocity profile.  
 
Assumptions We number and list the assumptions for clarity: 
1 
The wall is infinite in the s-y plane (y is out of the page for a right-handed coordinate system). 
2 
The flow is steady, i.e. 


anything
0
t



. 
3 
The flow is parallel and fully developed (we assume the normal component of velocity, un, is zero, and we assume 
that the streamwise component of velocity us is independent of streamwise coordinate s). 
4 
The fluid is incompressible and Newtonian, and the flow is laminar. 
5 
Pressure P = constant = Patm at the free surface. In other words, there is no applied pressure gradient pushing the 
flow; the flow establishes itself due to a balance between gravitational forces and viscous forces along the wall. 
Atmospheric pressure is constant everywhere since we are neglecting the change of air pressure with elevation. 
6 
The velocity field is purely two-dimensional, which implies that v = 0 and 
y

 (any velocity component) = 0. 
7 
Gravity acts in the negative z direction. We can express this mathematically as g
gk



. In the s-n plane, gs = 
gsin and gn = gcos. 
 
Analysis 
We obtain the velocity and pressure fields by following the step-by-step procedure for differential fluid 
flow solutions.  
 
Step 1 Set up the problem and the geometry. See Problem statement. 
Step 2 List assumptions and boundary conditions. We have already listed seven assumptions. The boundary conditions 
are (1) No slip at the wall: at n = 0, us = v = un = 0. (2) At the free surface (n = h) there is no shear, which in this 
coordinate system at the vertical free surface means us/n = 0. (3) P = Patm at n = h. 
Step 3 Write out and simplify the differential equations. We start with the continuity equation in modified Cartesian 
coordinates, (s,y,n) and (us,v,un),

Equation 1 tells us that us is not a function of s. In other words, it doesn’t matter where we place our origin – the flow 
is the same at any s location. This does not tell us anything new; we have already assumed that the flow is fully 
developed (Assumption 3). Furthermore, since us is not a function of time (Assumption 2) or y (Assumption 6), we 
conclude that us is at most a function of n,

We now simplify each component of the Navier-Stokes equation as far as possible. Since v = 0 everywhere and 
gravity does not act in the y direction, the y momentum equation is satisfied exactly (in fact all terms are zero). Since un 
= 0 everywhere, the only non-zero terms in the n momentum equation are the pressure term and the gravity term. The n 
momentum equation reduces to 
n momentum:

We have changed from a partial derivative (/n) to a total derivative (d/dn) in Eq. 6 as a direct result of Eq. 2,

Since n < h in the film, us is positive everywhere as expected (flow is

Step 6 Verify the results. You can plug in the velocity field to verify that 
all the differential equations and boundary conditions are satisfied. 
 
When  = 90o sin = 1 and Eq. 8 is equivalent to Eq. 5 of Example 9-17. (The signs are opposite since s is down while z is 
up.) Also, Eq. 5 above reduces to P = Patm everywhere when  = 90o since cos = 0; this also agrees with the results of 
Example 9-17. We nondimensionalize Eq. 8 by inspection: we let n* = n/h and us* = us/(gh2). Eq. 8 becomes

The profile shape is identical to that of Example 9-17, but is scaled by the factor sin. This problem could 
also have been solved in standard Cartesian coordinates (x,y,z), but the algebra would be more involved.

Solution 
We are to calculate the volume flow rate per unit width of oil falling down a vertical wall.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The flow is incompressible. 3 The wall is infinitely wide and very long so that all of 
the parallel flow, fully developed approximations of Problem 9-89 hold.

Discussion 
Since viscosity is in the denominator of Eq. 1, a low viscosity liquid (like water) would yield a larger 
volume flow rate; this agrees with our intuition. Likewise, a larger density liquid and/or a thicker film would yield a larger 
volume flow rate, again agreeing with our intuition. Finally, if  = 0o there is no flow.

Solution 
For a given geometry and set of boundary conditions, we are to calculate the velocity field. 
 
Assumptions We number and list the assumptions for clarity: 
1 
The cylinders are infinite in the z direction (z is out of the page in the figure of the problem statement for a right-
handed coordinate system). The velocity field is purely two-dimensional, which implies that w = 0 and derivatives 
of any velocity component with respect to z are zero. 
2 
The flow is steady, meaning that all time derivatives are zero. 
3 
The flow is circular, meaning that the radial velocity component ur is zero. 
4 
The flow is rotationally symmetric, meaning that nothing is a function of . 
5 
The fluid is incompressible and Newtonian, and the flow is laminar. 
6 
Gravitational effects are ignored. (Note that gravity may act in the z direction, leading to an additional hydrostatic 
pressure distribution in the z direction. This would not affect the present analysis.) 
 
Analysis 
We obtain the velocity and pressure fields by following the step-by-step procedure for differential fluid 
flow solutions.  
 
Step 1 Set up the problem and the geometry. See the problem statement. 
Step 2 List assumptions and boundary conditions. We have already listed five assumptions. The boundary conditions are 
(1) No slip at the inner wall: at r = Ri, u = iRi. (2) No slip at the outer wall: at r = Ro, u = 0. 
Step 3 Write out and simplify the differential equations. We start with the continuity equation in cylindrical coordinates, 
(r,,z) and (ur,u,uz),

Thus continuity is satisfied exactly by our assumptions. 
 
We now simplify each component of the Navier-Stokes equation as far as possible. Since w = 0 everywhere and 
gravity is ignored, the z momentum equation is satisfied exactly (in fact all terms are zero). Since ur = 0 everywhere, 
the only non-zero terms in the r momentum equation are the pressure term and the “extra” term that involves u. The r

Solution 
We are to simplify the velocity field for two limiting cases of Problem 9-96 and discuss.  
 
Assumptions The same assumptions of Problem 9-96 apply here.

Note that Eq. 1 is still exact. When the gap is very small, (Ro – Ri) << Ro, and Ro  Ri. Thus we replace Ro + Ri in the 
denominator of Eq. 1 by 2Ri. Similarly, r  Ri and we replace Ro + r in the numerator of Eq. 1 by 2Ri. Likewise we replace r 
in the denominator of Eq. 1 by Ri. As suggested we define y = Ro – r, h = 
gap thickness = Ro – Ri, and V = speed of the “upper plate” = Rii (Fig. 1). 
Plugging all of these approximations and definitions into Eq. 1 we get

We verify that Eq. 2 is linear in the small gap and is the same velocity 
profile as we generated for 2-D Couette flow between two infinite flat 
plates. 
 
(b) As the outer cylinder radius approaches infinity, Ri << Ro, and Ri can 
be ignored when added to or subtracted from Ro. Similarly, r << Ro, and r can be ignored when added to or subtracted from 
Ro. Equation 1 becomes

Discussion

would emerge – basically a line vortex for all radii greater than Ri.

Solution 
For a given geometry and set of boundary conditions, we are to calculate the velocity field. 
 
Assumptions The assumptions are identical to those of Problem 9-96. 
 
Analysis 
We obtain the velocity and pressure fields by following the step-by-step procedure for differential fluid 
flow solutions. Everything is identical to Problem 9-96 except for the boundary condition at the outer cylinder wall. We re-
write boundary condition (2): at r = Ro, u = oRo. We will not repeat all the algebra associated with the equations of 
motion. The tangential velocity component is still

We recognize Eq. 1 as the velocity field for solid body rotation. To set up this velocity field in a physical experiment, we 
would place a cylindrical container of liquid on a rotating table. After a long time, the entire tank, including the liquid, 
would be in solid body rotation. 
 
Discussion 
If you imagine flow between the inner and outer cylinders, and then imagine that the inner cylinder stops 
spinning and shrinks to infinitesimal radius, you can convince yourself that solid body rotation would result.

Solution 
For flow in a pipe annulus we are to calculate the velocity field.  
 
Assumptions We number and list the assumptions for clarity: 
1 
The pipe is infinitely long in the x direction. 
2 
The flow is steady, i.e. 


anything
0
t



. 
3 
This is a parallel flow (the r component of velocity, ur, is zero). 
4 
The fluid is incompressible and Newtonian, and the flow is laminar. 
5 
A constant pressure gradient is applied in the x direction such that pressure changes linearly with respect to x 
according to the given expression. 
6 
The velocity field is axisymmetric with no swirl, implying that u = 0 and 
 


anything
0



. 
7 
We ignore the effects of gravity. 
 
Analysis 
We obtain the velocity field by following the step-by-step procedure for differential fluid flow solutions.  
 
Step 1 Lay out the problem and the geometry. See the problem statement. 
Step 2 List assumptions and boundary conditions. We have already listed seven assumptions. The boundary conditions 
come from imposing the no slip condition at both pipe walls: (1) at r = Ri, 
0
V 

. (2) at r = Ro, 
0
V 

. 
Step 3 Write out and simplify the differential equations. We start with the continuity equation in cylindrical coordinates,

Equation 1 tells us that u is not a function of x. In other words, it doesn’t matter where we place our origin – the flow is 
the same at any x location. This can also be inferred directly from Assumption 1, which tells us that there is nothing 
special about any x location since the pipe is infinite in length – the flow is fully developed. Furthermore, since u is not 
a function of time (Assumption 2) or  (Assumption 6), we conclude that u is at most a function of r,

Note that we have replaced the partial derivative operators for the u derivatives with total derivative operators because 
of Eq. 2.  Every term in the r momentum equation is zero except the pressure gradient term, forcing that lone term to 
also be zero,

In other words, P is not a function of r. Since P is also not a function of time (Assumption 2) or  (Assumption 6), P 
can be at most a function of x,

Therefore we can replace the partial derivative operator for the pressure gradient in Eq. 4 by the total derivative 
operator since P varies only with x. Finally, all terms of the  component of the Navier-Stokes equation go to zero. 
Step 4 Solve the differential equations. Continuity and r momentum have already been “solved”, resulting in Eqs. 2 and 6 
respectively. The  momentum equation has vanished, and thus we are left with Eq. 4 (x momentum). After 
multiplying both sides by r, we integrate once to obtain

Discussion 
Since the boundary conditions of the present problem are the same as those of the previous problem except 
that Ro and Ri are swapped, it turns out that the result is also identical except that the two radii are swapped.

Solution 
For modified Couette flow with two immiscible fluids we are to list the boundary conditions and then solve 
for both the velocity and pressure fields. Finally we are to plot the velocity profile across the channel. 
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The flow is two-dimensional in the x-y plane. 
 
Properties 
The density and viscosity of water at T = 80oC are 971.8 kg/m3 and 0.355  10-3 kg/(ms) respectively. The 
density and viscosity of unused engine oil at T = 80oC are 852 kg/m3 and 32.0  10-3 kg/(ms) respectively. 
 
Analysis 
(a) The velocity boundary conditions come from the no-slip condition at the walls: 
Boundary condition (1): 
At z = 0, u1 = 0 
(1) 
and 
Boundary condition (2): 
At z = h1 + h2, u2 = V 
(2) 
At the interface we know that both the velocities and the shear stresses must match, 
Boundary condition (3): 
At z = h1, u1 = u2

and 
Boundary condition (4): 
At z = h1,

(4) 
The first pressure boundary condition comes from the known pressure on the bottom, 
Boundary condition (5): 
At z = 0, P = P0 
(5) 
The second pressure boundary condition comes from the fact that the pressure cannot have a discontinuity at the interface 
since we are ignoring surface tension, 
Boundary condition (6): 
At z = h1, P1 = P2 
(6) 
 
(b) We solve for the velocity field using the step-by-step procedure outlined in this chapter. However, we leave out the 
details because the algebra is identical to that of simple Couette flow – the only difference is in the boundary conditions. 
For parallel, fully developed flow in the x direction, u is the only non-zero velocity component and it is a function of z only. 
The x momentum equations in the two fluids reduce to

Again you can verify that the boundary conditions are satisfied by Eq.

(d) For the given fluid properties we plot the velocity profile in Fig. 1. 
Since the oil is so much more viscous than the water, the oil velocity is 
nearly constant (small slope) while the water velocity varies rapidly 
(large slope). At the interface the viscosity times the slope must match, so this should not be surprising. 
 
Discussion 
Both velocity profiles are linear. The pressure is simply hydrostatic since P is a function of z only. The oil 
must be on top since it is less dense than water.

Solution 
We are to calculate u(r) for flow inside an inclined round pipe.  
 
Assumptions We number and list the assumptions for clarity: 
1 
The pipe is infinitely long in the x direction. 
2 
The flow is steady, i.e. any time derivative is zero. 
3 
This is a parallel flow (the r component of velocity, ur, is zero). 
4 
The fluid is incompressible and Newtonian, and the flow is laminar. 
5 
The pressure is constant everywhere except for hydrostatic pressure. 
6 
The velocity field is axisymmetric with no swirl, implying that u = 0 and 
 
all derivatives with respect to  are zero. 
 
Analysis 
To obtain the velocity and pressure fields, we follow the step-by-step procedure outlined above.  
 
Step 1 Lay out the problem and the geometry. See the problem statement. 
Step 2 List assumptions and boundary conditions. We have already listed six assumptions. The first boundary condition 
comes from imposing the no slip condition at the pipe wall: (1) at r = R, 
0
V 

. The second boundary condition comes 
from the fact that the centerline of the pipe is an axis of symmetry: (2) at r = 0, du/dr = 0. 
Step 3 Write out and simplify the differential equations. We start with the continuity equation in cylindrical coordinates, a 
modified version of Eq. 9-62a,

Equation 1 tells us that u is not a function of x. In other words, it doesn’t matter where we place our origin – the flow is 
the same at any x location. This can also be inferred directly from Assumption 1, which tells us that there is nothing 
special about any x location since the pipe is infinite in length – the flow is fully developed. Furthermore, since u is not 
a function of time (Assumption 2) or  (Assumption 6), we conclude that u is at most a function of r,

As in previous examples the material acceleration (entire left hand side of the x momentum equation) is zero, implying 
that fluid particles are not accelerating at all in this flow field, and linearizing the Navier-Stokes equation. Also notice 
that we have replaced the partial derivative operators for the u derivatives with total derivative operators because of Eq. 
2. 
 
You can show in similar fashion that every term in the r momentum equation and in the  momentum equation 
goes to zero. 
Step 4 Solve the differential equations. Continuity, r momentum, and  momentum have already been solved, and thus 
we are left with Eq. 3 (x momentum). After multiplying both sides by r, integrating, dividing by r, and integrating 
again,

only if constant C1 is equal to 0.

The axial velocity profile is thus in the shape of a paraboloid, just as in Example 9-18.

conditions are satisfied. 
 
The volume flow rate through the pipe is found by integrating Eq. 5 through the whole cross-sectional area of the pipe,

There is no such thing as an “inviscid” fluid. For example, if  were zero in this problem, the axial velocity,

Solution 
We are to generate and discuss velocity and pressure boundary conditions for the given flow problem.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady in the mean. 2 Surface tension effects are negligibly small. 
 
Analysis 
On all tank walls, V

 = 0 since the tank walls are stationary (no-slip boundary condition). Mathematically, 
we write ur = u = uz = 0 at r = Rtank (the tank side walls) and at z = 0 (the bottom wall of the tank). On the blade surfaces, 
the fluid velocity must equal that of the blades (also the no-slip condition). At any radial location r the velocity of the blade 
surface is 
blade
V
r e




. In other words u = r at the blade surfaces. Since the blades do not move at all in the radial or 
vertical directions, ur = uz = 0 along the blade surfaces. Finally, at the free surface P = Patm since the free surface is 
exposed to atmospheric air. In addition, the vertical component of velocity uz must equal zero at the free surface. We 
note that the other two velocity components (ur and u) may be non-zero at the free surface, but the shear stress in the 
horizontal plane of the free surface must be zero (negligible shear due to the air). Mathematically, ur/z = u/z = 0 at 
the free surface. 
 
Discussion 
The no-slip condition requires that u = r everywhere on the blade surface, regardless of the geometry of 
the blades.

Solution 
We are to generate and discuss velocity and pressure boundary conditions for the stirrer flow problem from 
a rotating frame of reference.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady in the mean. 2 Surface tension effects are negligibly small. 
 
Analysis 
On all tank walls, 
tank
V

 = 0 from a stationary frame of reference since the tank walls are stationary (no-slip 
boundary condition). From the rotating frame of reference however, the tank walls are rotating in the opposite direction of 
. Mathematically, we write ur = uz = 0 and u = Rtank at r = Rtank (the tank side walls). At the bottom wall of the tank 
we write ur = uz = 0 and u = r at z = 0. On the blade surfaces, the fluid velocity must equal that of the blades (also the 
no-slip condition). Since the blades are stationary in this rotating frame of reference, ur = uz = u = 0 at the blade surfaces. 
Finally, at the free surface P = Patm since the free surface is exposed to atmospheric air. In addition, the vertical 
component of velocity uz must equal zero at the free surface. We note that the other two velocity components (ur and u) 
may be non-zero at the free surface, but the shear stress in the horizontal plane of the free surface must be zero (negligible 
shear due to the air). Mathematically, ur/z = u/z = 0 at the free surface. 
 
Discussion 
In this problem the free surface boundary conditions are independent of frame of reference.

Review Problems 
 
 
 
 
9-108C 
Solution 
We are to list the six steps used to solve fluid flow problem with the continuity and Navier-Stokes 
equations, for the case in which the fluid is incompressible and has constant properties. 
 
Analysis 
The steps are listed below: 
 
Step 1 Lay out the problem and the geometry. Identify all relevant dimensions and parameters. 
Step 2 List all appropriate assumptions, approximations, simplifications, and boundary conditions. 
Step 3 Write out and simplify the differential equations (continuity and the required components of Navier-
Stokes) as much as possible. 
Step 4 Solve (integrate) the differential equations. This leads to one or more constants of integration. 
Step 5 Apply boundary conditions to obtain values for the constants of integration. 
Step 6 Verify the results by checking that the flow field meets all the specifications and boundary conditions. 
 
Discussion 
These steps are not always followed in the same order. For example, in CFD applications the boundary 
conditions are applied before the equations are integrated. 
 
 
 
 
 
9-109C 
Solution 
We are to name each equation, and then discuss its restrictions and its physical meaning.  
 
Analysis 
(a) This is the continuity equation. The form given here is valid for any fluid. It describes conservation of 
mass in a fluid flow. 
 
(b) This is Cauchy’s equation. The form given here is valid for any fluid. It describes conservation of linear momentum in 
a fluid flow. 
 
(c) This is the Navier-Stokes equation. The form given here is valid for a specific type of fluid, namely an incompressible 
Newtonian fluid. The equation describes conservation of linear momentum in a fluid flow. 
 
Discussion 
It is important that you be able to recognize these notable equations of fluid mechanics. 
 
 
 
 
 
9-110C 
Solution 
We are to discuss the connection(s) between the incompressible flow approximation and the constant 
temperature approximation.  
 
Analysis 
For an incompressible flow, the density is assumed to be constant. In addition, the incompressible flow 
approximation usually implies that all fluid properties (viscosity, thermal conductivity, etc.) are constant as well. These 
assumptions go hand in hand because a flow with constant density implies a flow with little or no temperature changes and 
no buoyancy effects. Since viscosity is a strong function of temperature but generally a weak function of pressure, the 
fluid’s viscosity is approximately constant whenever temperature is constant. When dealing with incompressible fluid 
flows, pressure variable P is interpreted as the mechanical pressure Pm, and we don’t need an equation of state. In effect, the 
equation of state is replaced by the assumption of constant density and constant temperature. 
 
Discussion 
Mechanical pressure Pm is determined by the flow field, not by thermodynamics.

9-111C 
Solution 
 
(a) True: The unknowns for an incompressible flow problem with constant fluid properties are pressure and the three 
components of velocity. Density and viscosity are constants and are therefore not unknowns. 
(b) False: The unknowns for a compressible flow problem are pressure, the three components of velocity, and the density. 
However, density is a thermodynamic function of pressure and temperature. Hence, temperature appears as an 
additional unknown, as does some kind of equation of state. In summary, there are actually at least 6 unknowns (P, u, 
v, w, , and T). We therefore need 6 equations (continuity, 3 components of Navier-Stokes, equation of state, and 
energy). In addition, fluid properties such as viscosity may change as well, and we need either more equations or some 
kind of look-up table for these properties. 
(c) False: Cauchy’s equation contains additional unknowns – the components of the stress tensor, which must be written 
in terms of the velocity and pressure fields through some kind of constitutive equation. 
(d) True: For an incompressible flow problem involving a Newtonian fluid, there are only 4 unknowns (P, u, v, and w). 
We therefore need only 4 equations (continuity and 3 components of Navier-Stokes). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
9-112C 
Solution 
We are to discuss the relationship between volumetric strain rate and the continuity equation. 
 
Analysis 
Volumetric strain rate is defined as the rate of increase of volume of a fluid element per unit volume. In a 
compressible flow field, the volume of a fluid particle may increase or decrease as it moves along in the flow, but its mass 
must remain constant. (This is a fundamental statement of conservation of mass of a system, since the fluid particle can be 
thought of as an infinitesimal system.) Mathematically it turns out that volumetric strain rate is the sum of the three 
normal strain rates, and is identically zero for incompressible flow (density cannot change, and hence volume cannot 
change). The continuity equation is based on the same fundamental principle of mass conservation. It is a differential form 
of the equation of conservation of mass. Its incompressible form also shows that the sum of the three normal strain rates 
must be zero. On the other hand, if the density is not constant, the sum of the three normal strain rates is not zero, but is still 
equal to the volumetric strain rate, which is also non-zero. 
 
Discussion 
Volumetric strain rate is derived and discussed in Chap. 4 as a kinematic property.

For a given geometry and set of boundary conditions, we are to calculate the velocity and pressure fields, 
and plot the velocity profile.  
 
Assumptions The assumptions are identical to those of Example 9-17.

We obtain the velocity and pressure fields by following 
the step-by-step procedure for differential fluid flow solutions. Everything 
is identical to Example 9-17 except for the boundary condition at the wall. 
Boundary condition (1), the no-slip condition, becomes: at x = 0, u = v = 
0. w = V. Steps 1 through 4 are otherwise identical, and the result is

Since x < h in the film, the first term in Eq. 2 is negative, but the second term is positive. Depending on the relative 
magnitude of the terms, part or all of the vertical velocity may be positive. The pressure field is still P = Patm 
everywhere. 
Step 6 Verify the results. You can plug in the velocity field to verify that all the differential equations and boundary 
conditions are satisfied. 
 
We nondimensionalize Eq. 2 by inspection: we let x* = x/h and w* = w/(gh2). Eq. 2 becomes

Discussion 
Notice that the velocity profile has zero slope at the free surface regardless of the values of Fr and Re. For 
large enough V, the net mass flow rate is upward rather than downward.

Solution 
We are to calculate the volume flow rate per unit width of oil falling down a moving vertical wall, and then 
calculate the wall speed such that the net volume flow rate of oil is zero.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The flow is incompressible. 3 The wall is infinitely wide and very long so that all of 
the parallel flow, fully developed approximations of the previous problem hold.

We calculate the volume flow rate per unit width by integration of the velocity:

Discussion 
For any V greater than the value calculated in Eq. 3, the net oil flow is up, while for V less than this value, 
the net oil flow is down. Since viscosity is in the denominator of Eq. 2, a low viscosity liquid (like water) would require a 
very large vertical velocity in order to achieve a net upward flow of the liquid.

Solution 
For a given axial velocity component in an axisymmetric flow field, we are to validate the incompressible 
approximation, generate the radial velocity component, generate an expression for the stream function, and then plot some 
streamlines and design the shape of the contraction.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The flow is incompressible. 3 The flow is axisymmetric implying that u = 0 and 
there is no variation in the  direction. 
 
Properties 
At room temperature and pressure, the speed of sound in air is about 1130 ft/s.

At the entrance of the contraction (z = 0), the wall is at r = D0/2 = 
2.5 ft. Eq. 6 yields wall = 33.75 ft3/s for the streamline that passes 
through this point. This streamline thus represents the shape of the 
nozzle wall, and we have designed the nozzle shape. 
 
Discussion 
Since the boundary layers along the walls of the 
contraction are very small, the assumption about negligible friction 
effects is reasonable. This contraction shape should deliver the desired 
axial flow speed quite nicely.

We are to determine a relationship between constants a, b, c, d, and e that ensures incompressibility, and we 
are to determine the primary dimensions of each constant.

Discussion 
If Eq. 2 were not satisfied, the given velocity field might still represent a valid flow field, but density would 
have to vary with location in the flow field – in other words the flow would be compressible.

Solution 
We are to specify boundary conditions in terms of stream function.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The flow is incompressible 3 The flow is two-dimensional. 
 
Analysis 
(a) For 2-D incompressible flow the difference in the value of the stream function between two streamlines 
is equal to the volume flow rate per unit width between the two streamlines. Since the entire flow is confined between the 
lower and upper channel walls, we know that stream function  must be constant along the upper wall. We calculate  on 
the upper channel wall as follows:

(b) Since the inlet flow is uniform,  must increase linearly from lower to upper along the left edge of the computational 
domain. In equation form, 
left:

(3) 
We notice that Eq. 3 could have been obtained directly from u = V1 = /y. 
 
(c) We have some options for the right edge of the computational domain. If that boundary is far enough away that it does 
not adversely affect the flow near the sudden contraction, we might specify a uniform velocity distribution along the right 
edge, similar to Eq. 3 above, but with a higher velocity determined by conservation of mass, 
Average outlet speed:

In other words, we would specify 
right: 



(4) 
Eq. 4 is not a very good boundary condition because we know that viscous effects will surely slow down the flow near the 
walls – the velocity profile at the outlet will not be uniform. 
 
A much better boundary condition (if the code permits it) is to specify that  not change with x along the right 
edge of the domain. Mathematically, we would specify 
right: 
right

(5) 
You can see from the definition of  that Eq. 5 is identical to forcing velocity component v to be zero at the outlet. In 
other words, we specify that the flow at the outlet is parallel. 
 
A third option would be to locate the right edge very far downstream so that the flow there is fully developed 
channel flow, for which we can specify the stream function as a function of y along the edge.  can be obtained from 
Problem 9-43. 
 
Discussion 
CFD and boundary conditions are discussed in detail in Chap. 15.

Solution 
We are to sketch some streamlines for boundary layer flow.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The flow is incompressible. 3 The flow is two-dimensional in the x-y plane.  
 
Analysis 
We can offer only quantitative sketches of the streamlines. Since there is no flow reversal, we can be sure 
that (x) is not a streamline. In fact, streamlines must cross (x). Furthermore, at any given y location above the plate the 
fluid speed decreases as the boundary layer grows downstream. Hence, the streamlines must diverge. The bottom line is 
that the streamlines veer slightly upward away from the wall to compensate for the loss of speed in the boundary layer. 
Streamlines are sketched in Fig. 1. 
 
 
Discussion 
As the boundary layer grows in thickness, more and more streamlines end up inside the boundary layer.

If we had defined  with the opposite signs of Eq. 1, the flow would be from left to right as  increases.

Solution 
We are to analyze this problem two ways: with the exact (differential) technique, and with dimensional 
analysis, and we are to compare the results.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The flow is incompressible, Newtonian, laminar, parallel, and fully developed (u = 
u(y) only, where x is in the direction of motion and y is normal to the direction of motion). 3 We ignore aerodynamic drag 
on the block. 
 
Analysis 
(a) We draw a free-body diagram of the block in Fig. 1 and sum all the 
forces acting on it. There are only two forces in the x direction: the x component of 
weight Wsin and the force A due to viscous shear at the bottom surface of the block. 
Since the block slides at constant speed, these two forces must balance.

Solution 
We are to write Poisson’s equation in standard form and discuss its similarities and differences compared to 
Laplace’s equation. 
 
Analysis 
Poisson’s equation in standard form is 
Poisson’s equation: 
2
s



 
(1) 
where  is a dependent variable that is a function of space, 2 is the Laplacian operator, and s is the right hand side of the 
equation, which may be a function of space, but cannot be a function of  itself. Poisson’s equation is similar to Laplace’s 
equation in that the left hand sides are identical. The difference is that Poisson’s equation has a non-zero right hand side 
whereas the right hand side of Laplace’s equation is zero. Note: Poisson’s equation reduces to Laplace’s equation if s = 0. 
 
Discussion 
We discuss Poisson’s equation briefly in this chapter in relation to pressure correction algorithms used by 
CFD codes.

Solution 
We are to analyze this problem three ways: with the control volume technique, with the differential 
technique, and with dimensional analysis, and we are to compare the results.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The flow is axisymmetric, incompressible, Newtonian, laminar, parallel, and fully 
developed (u = u(r) only). 
 
Analysis 
(a) We use the head form of the energy equation from point 1 to point 2. Since there are no pumps, turbines, 
or minor losses the energy equation reduces to

The pressure terms cancel since P1 = P2 = Patm. The velocity terms cancel since the flow is fully developed. Upon

three primary dimensions represented in the problem, namely m, L, and t. Thus we expect 7-3 = 4 s. We choose three 
repeating variables, , g, and D. The s are

Solution 
We are to determine the primary dimensions of , nondimensionalize Eq. 1, and then plot several 
nondimensional streamlines for this flow field.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The flow is incompressible. 3 The flow is two-dimensional in the x-y or r- plane. 
 
Analysis 
 
(a) There are several ways to calculate the primary dimensions of . First, from Eq. 1 we see that

We could also use the definition of . Since velocities are obtained by 
spatial derivatives of ,  must have an additional length dimension in 
the numerator compared to the dimensions of velocity. This reasoning 
also yields {} = {L2/t}. 
 
(b) The nondimensional form of the stream function is straightforward.

Solution 
Two examples in Chapter 9 developed a velocity profile and flow rate equation by making assumptions in 
pipe flow where one of these examples yielded the Poiseuille flow equation.  In this problem, we assume the fluid, blood 
here, is not Newtonian but a Bingham Plastic fluid.  The velocity profile and flow rate are to be determined.  In addition, 
the velocity profile is to be plotted along with Newtonian and Pseudoplastic fluids. 
Assumptions:  1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The flow occurs within a rigid, circular pipe with uniformity and 
is axisymmetric. 
Analysis  Following the Power Law example in Chap. 9, we want to derive the velocity profile and flow rate using the 
shear stress equation provided for a Bingham Plastic model as noted below, 
 
and recall that 
 
So, if we substitute for τ and rearrange to get  
 
 
Integrate, 
 
where C is a constant of integration. 
Apply the boundary condition, 
, which yields 
 
 
We then substitute back in to arrive at a velocity equation  
 
However, this is not complete.  Because there is a yield stress, we will have to treat the solution a little differently and need 
to break up the flow into 2 sections.  For flow to occur, the wall shear stress must exceed the Bingham Plastic yield stress.  
Therefore, we must define some radius (
) where the shear stress will exceed the yield stress so flow can occur. 
 
In terms of our velocity profile, the fluid velocity will be constant from R=0 to R=
 and written as 
 
Substitute for 
, 
 
So, the velocity profile in the outer region (from 
 to R) is  
 
So, for the flow rate, this must be looked as two separate regions as well where there is the central region of flow and aouter 
region of flow. 
 
Let’s take these two separately. 
   is easy since we know the velocity is constant through this region.  Thus, the equation becomes 
 
Therefore,

In the outer region, the flow rate is defined by an integral over that region, 
 
After we substitute for u, the equation becomes 
 
Integrating yields, 
 
Combining both flow rate equations, 
 
If we then substitute back in for 
, the following equation is developed, 
 
Note: If the yield stress does not exist (
), the equation reduces to that for Poiseuille Flow for a Newtonian Fluid. 
The velocity profiles then become for Pseudoplastic, Newtonian, and Bingham Plastic fluids,

Introductory Problems and Modified Pressure 
 
 
 
 
10-1C 
Solution 
We are to discuss the role of nondimensionalization of the Navier-Stokes equations.  
 
Analysis 
When we properly nondimensionalize the Navier-Stokes equation, all the terms are re-written in the 
form of some nondimensional parameter times a quantity of order unity. Thus, we can simply compare the orders of 
magnitude of the nondimensional parameters to see which terms (if any) can be ignored because they are very small 
compared to other terms. For example, if the Strouhal number is much smaller than the Euler number, we can ignore the 
term that contains the Strouhal number, but must retain the term that contains the Euler number. 
 
Discussion 
This method works only if the characteristic scales of the problem (length, speed, frequency, etc.) are 
chosen properly. 
 
 
 
 
 
10-2C 
Solution 
We are to label regions in a flow field where certain approximations are likely to be appropriate.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is incompressible. 2 The flow is steady in the 
mean (we ignore the unsteady flow field close to the rotating blades). 
 
Analysis 
A boundary layer grows along the floor, both upstream 
and downstream of the fan. The flow upstream of the fan is largely 
irrotational except very close to the floor. The air is nearly static far 
upstream and far above the fan. Downstream of the fan, the flow is most 
likely swirling and turbulent, and none of the approximations are expected 
to be appropriate there. In other words, the full Navier-Stokes equation 
must be solved in that region. We sketch all these regions in Fig. 1. 
 
 
Discussion 
The regions sketched in Fig. 1 are not well defined, nor 
are they necessarily to scale. 
 
 
 
 
 
10-3C 
Solution 
We are to discuss the difference between an “exact” solution and an approximate solution of the Navier-
Stokes equation.  
 
Analysis 
In an “exact” solution, we begin with the full Navier-Stokes equation. As we solve the problem, some 
terms may drop out due to the specified geometry or other simplifying assumptions in the problem. In an approximate 
solution, we eliminate some terms in the Navier-Stokes equation right from the start. In other words, we begin with a 
reduced or simplified approximate form of the equation. 
 
Discussion 
The approximations are based on the class of flow problem and/or the region in which such approximations 
are appropriate (e.g. irrotational, boundary layer, etc.).

Solution 
We are to discuss which nondimensional parameter is eliminated by use of the modified pressure. 
 
Analysis 
Modified pressure effectively combines the effects of actual pressure and gravity. In the 
nondimensionalized Navier-Stokes equation in terms of modified pressure, the Froude number disappears. The reason 
Froude number is eliminated is because the gravity term is eliminated from the equation. 
 
Discussion 
Keep in mind that we can employ modified pressure only for flows without free surface effects. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10-5C 
Solution 
We are to discuss the criteria used to determine whether an approximation of the Navier-Stokes equation is 
appropriate or not 
 
Analysis 
We determine if an approximation is appropriate by comparing the orders of magnitude of the various 
terms in the equations of motion. If the neglected terms are negligibly small compared to other terms, then the 
approximation is appropriate. If not, then it is not appropriate to neglect those terms. 
 
Discussion 
It is important that the proper scales be used for the nondimensionalization of the equation. Otherwise, the 
order of magnitude analysis may be incorrect. 
 
 
 
 
 
10-6C 
Solution 
We are to discuss the physical significance of the four nondimensional parameters in the 
nondimensionalized incompressible Navier-Stokes equation. 
 
Analysis 
The four parameters are discussed individually below: 
 
 
Strouhal number: St is the ratio of some characteristic flow time to some period of oscillation. If St << 1, the 
oscillation period is very large compared to the characteristic flow time, and the problem is quasi-steady; the 
unsteady term in the Navier-Stokes equation may be ignored. If St >> 1, the oscillation period is very short 
compared to the characteristic flow time, and the unsteadiness dominates the problem; the unsteady term must 
remain. 
 
Euler number: Eu is the ratio of a characteristic pressure difference to a characteristic pressure due to fluid 
inertia. If Eu << 1, pressure gradients are very small compared to inertial pressure, and the pressure term can be 
neglected in the Navier-Stokes equation. If Eu >> 1, the pressure term is very large compared to the inertial term, 
and must remain in the equation. 
 
Froude number: Fr is the ratio of inertial forces to gravitational forces. Note that Fr appears in the denominator 
of the nondimensionalized Navier-Stokes equation. If Fr << 1, gravitational forces are very large compared to 
inertial forces, and the gravity term must remain in the Navier-Stokes equation. If Fr >> 1, gravitational forces are 
negligible compared to inertial forces, and the gravity term in the Navier-Stokes equation can be ignored. 
 
Reynolds number: Re is the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces. Note that Re appears in the denominator of 
the nondimensionalized Navier-Stokes equation. If Re << 1, viscous forces are very large compared to inertial 
forces, and the viscous term must remain. (In fact, it may dominate the other terms, as in creeping flow). If Re >> 
1, viscous forces are negligible compared to inertial forces, and the viscous term in the Navier-Stokes equation can 
be ignored. Note that this applies only to regions outside of boundary layers, because the characteristic length scale 
for a boundary layer is generally much smaller than that for the overall flow. 
 
Discussion 
You must keep in mind that the approximations discussed here are appropriate only in certain regions of the 
flow field. In other regions of the same flow field, different approximations may apply.

Solution 
We are to discuss the criterion for using modified pressure.  
 
Analysis 
Modified pressure can be used only when there are no free surface effects in the problem. 
 
Discussion 
Modified pressure is simply a combination of thermodynamic pressure and hydrostatic pressure. It turns out 
that if there are no free surface effects, the hydrostatic pressure component is independent of the flow pressure component, 
and these two can be separated. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10-8C 
Solution 
We are to discuss the most significant danger that arises with an approximate solution, and we are to come 
up with an example. 
 
Analysis 
The danger of an approximate solution of the Navier-Stokes equation is this: If the approximation is not 
appropriate to begin with, our solution will be incorrect – even if we perform all the mathematics correctly. There are 
many examples. For instance, we may assume that a boundary layer exists in a region of flow. However, if the Reynolds 
number is not large enough, the boundary layer is too thick and the boundary layer approximations break down. Another 
example is that we may assume a fluid statics region, when in reality there are swirling eddies in that region. The unsteady 
motion of the eddies makes the problem unsteady and dynamic – the approximation of fluid statics would be inappropriate.  
 
Discussion 
When you make an approximation and solve the problem, it is best to go back and verify that the 
approximation is appropriate.

We are to write all three components of the Navier-Stokes equation in terms of modified pressure, and show 
that they are equivalent to the equations with regular pressure. We are also to discuss the advantage of using modified

Equations 5 through 7 are the appropriate components of the Navier-Stokes equation in terms of regular pressure, so long as 
gravity acts downward (in the z direction). 
 
The advantage of using modified pressure is that the gravity term disappears from the Navier-Stokes equation. 
 
Discussion 
Modified pressure can be used only when there are no free surfaces.

Solution 
We are to sketch the profile of modified pressure and 
shade in the region representing hydrostatic pressure.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is incompressible. 2 The flow is fully 
developed. 3 Gravity acts vertically downward. 4 There are no free 
surface effects in this flow field. 
 
Analysis 
By definition, modified pressure P = P + gz. So we add 
hydrostatic pressure component gz to the given profile for P to obtain 
the profile for P. Recall from Example 9-16, that for the case in which 
gravity does not act in the x-z plane, the pressure would be constant along 
any slice x = x1. Thus we infer that here (with gravity), the linear increase 
in P as we move down vertically in the channel is due to hydrostatic 
pressure. Therefore, when we add gz to P to obtain the modified 
pressure, it turns out that P is constant at this horizontal location.  
 
 
We show two solutions in Fig. 1: (a) datum plane z = 0 located 
at the bottom wall, and (b) datum plane z = 0 located at the top wall. The 
shaded region in Fig. 1b represents the hydrostatic pressure component. 
P is constant along the slice x = x1 for either case, and the datum plane 
can be drawn at any arbitrary elevation. 
 
 
Discussion 
It should be apparent why it is advantageous to use 
modified pressure; namely, the gravity term is eliminated from the 
Navier-Stokes equation, and P is in general simpler than P.

Solution 
We are to discuss how modified pressure varies with downstream distance in planar Poiseuille flow.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is incompressible. 2 The flow is fully 
developed. 3 Gravity acts vertically downward. 4 There are no free 
surface effects in this flow field. 
 
Analysis 
For fully developed planar Poiseuille flow between two 
parallel plates, we know that pressure P decreases linearly with x, the 
distance down the channel. Modified pressure is defined as P = P + gz. 
However, since the flow is horizontal, elevation z does not change as we 
move axially down the channel. Thus we conclude that modified 
pressure P decreases linearly with x. We sketch both P and P in Fig. 1 
at two axial locations, x = x1 and x = x2. The shaded region in Fig. 1 
represents the hydrostatic pressure component gz. Since channel height 
is constant, the hydrostatic component does not change with x. P is 
constant along any vertical slice, but its magnitude decreases linearly with x as sketched. 
 
Discussion 
The pressure gradient dP/dx in terms of modified pressure is the same as the pressure gradient P/x in 
terms of actual pressure.

Solution 
We are to generate an “exact” solution of the Navier-Stokes equation for fully developed Couette flow, 
using modified pressure. We are to compare to the solution of Chap. 9 that does not use modified pressure. 
 
Assumptions We number and list the assumptions for clarity: 
1 
The plates are infinite in x and z (z is out of the page in the figure associated with this problem). 
2 
The flow is steady. 
3 
This is a parallel flow (we assume the y component of velocity, v, is zero). 
4 
The fluid is incompressible and Newtonian, and the flow is laminar. 
5 
Pressure P = constant with respect to x. In other words, there is no applied pressure gradient pushing the flow in 
the x direction; the flow establishes itself due to viscous stresses caused by the moving upper wall. In terms of 
modified pressure, P is also constant with respect to x. 
6 
The velocity field is purely two-dimensional, which implies that w = 0 and

Gravity acts in the negative z direction. 
 
Analysis 
To obtain the velocity and pressure fields, we follow the step-by-step procedure outlined in Chap. 9.  
 
Step 1 Set up the problem and the geometry. See the figure associated with this problem. 
Step 2 List assumptions and boundary conditions. We have already listed seven assumptions. The boundary conditions 
come from imposing the no slip condition: (1) At the bottom plate (y = 0), u = v = w = 0. (2) At the top plate (y = h), u 
= V, v = 0, and w = 0. (3) At z = 0, P = P0, and thus P = P + gz = P0. 
Step 3 Write out and simplify the differential equations. We start with the continuity equation in Cartesian coordinates,

Equation 1 tells us that u is not a function of x. In other words, it doesn’t matter where we place our origin – the flow is 
the same at any x location. I.e., the flow is fully developed. Furthermore, since u is not a function of time (Assumption 
2) or z (Assumption 6), we conclude that u is at most a function of y,

All other terms in Eq. 3 have disappeared except for a lone viscous term, which must then itself equal zero. Notice that 
we have changed from a partial derivative (/y) to a total derivative (d/dy) in Eq. 3 as a direct result of Eq. 2. We do 
not show the details here, but you can show in similar fashion that every term except the pressure term in the y

Step 4 Solve the differential equations. Continuity, y momentum, and z momentum have already been “solved”, resulting

The velocity field reveals a simple linear velocity profile from u = 0 at the bottom plate to u = V at the top plate. 
Step 6 Verify the results. You can plug in the velocity and pressure fields to verify that all the differential equations and 
boundary conditions are satisfied. 
 
 
We verify that the results are identical to those of Example 9-15. Thus, we get the same result using modified 
pressure throughout the calculation as we do using the regular (thermodynamic) pressure throughout the calculation. 
 
Discussion 
Since there are no free surfaces in this problem, the gravity term in the Navier-Stokes equation is absorbed 
into the modified pressure, and the pressure and gravity terms are combined into one term. This is possible since flow 
pressure and hydrostatic pressure are uncoupled.

(5) 
Clearly, the first two terms (the unsteady and inertial terms) in Eq. 5 are negligible compared to the second two terms (the 
pressure and gravity terms) since D >> d. The last term (the viscous term) is a little trickier. We know that if the flow 
remains laminar, the order of magnitude of Rejet is at most 103. Thus, in order for the viscous term to be of the same order 
of magnitude as the inertial term, d2/D2 must be of order of magnitude 10-3. Thus, provided that these criteria are met, the 
only two remaining terms in the Navier-Stokes equation are the pressure and gravity terms. The final dimensional form of 
the equation is the same as that of fluid statics,

The criteria for Carrie’s approximation to be appropriate depends on the desired precision. For 1% error, D must be 
at least 10 times greater than d to ignore the unsteady term and the inertial term. The viscous term, however, depends on the 
value of Rejet. To be safe, Carrie should assume the highest possible value of Rejet, for which we know from the above order 
of magnitude estimates that D must be at least 103/2 times greater than d. 
 
Discussion 
We cannot use the modified pressure in this problem since there is a free surface.

Solution 
We are to sketch the profile of actual pressure and shade in the region representing hydrostatic pressure.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is incompressible. 2 Gravity acts vertically 
downward. 3 There are no free surface effects in this flow field. 
 
Analysis 
By definition, modified pressure P = P + gz. Thus, to 
obtain actual pressure P, we subtract the hydrostatic component gz from 
the given profile of P. Using the given value of P at the mid-way point as 
a guide, we sketch the actual pressure in Fig. 1 such that the difference 
between P and P increases linearly. In other words, we subtract the 
hydrostatic pressure component gz from the modified pressure P to 
obtain the profile for actual pressure P. 
 
Discussion 
We assume that there are no free surface effects in the 
problem; otherwise modified pressure should not be used. The datum 
plane is set in the problem statement, but any arbitrary elevation could be 
used instead. If the datum plane were set at the top of the domain, P would be less than P everywhere because of the 
negative values of z in the transformation from P to P.  
 
 
 
 
 
10-15 
Solution 
We are to solve the Navier-Stokes equation in terms of modified pressure for the case of steady, fully 
developed, laminar flow in a round pipe. We are to obtain expressions for the pressure and velocity fields, and compare the 
actual pressure at the top of the pipe to that at the bottom of the pipe. 
 
Assumptions We make the same assumptions as in Example 9-18, except we use modified pressure P in place of actual 
pressure P. 
 
Analysis 
The Navier-Stokes equation with gravity, written in terms of modified pressure P, is identical to the 
Navier-Stokes equation with no gravity, written in terms of actual pressure P. In other words, all of the algebra of Example 
9-18 remains the same, except we use modified pressure P in place of actual pressure P. The velocity field does not 
change, and the result is

where 
1P is the modified pressure at location x = x1. In Example 9-18, the actual pressure varies only with x. In fact it 
decreases linearly with x (note that the pressure gradient is negative for flow from left to right). Here, Eq. 2 shows that 
modified pressure behaves in the same way, namely P varies only with x, and in fact decreases linearly with x. 
 
We simply subtract the hydrostatic pressure component gz from modified pressure P (Eq. 2) to obtain the final 
expression for actual pressure P,

Since the pipe is horizontal, the bottom of the pipe is lower than the top of the pipe. Thus, ztop is greater than zbottom, 
and therefore by Eq. 3 Ptop is less than Pbottom. This agrees with our experience that pressure increases downward. 
 
Discussion 
Since there are no free surfaces in this flow, the gravity term does not directly influence the velocity field, 
and a hydrostatic component is added to the pressure field. You can see the advantage of using modified pressure.

Creeping Flow 
 
 
 
 
10-16C 
Solution 
 We are to discuss why density is not a factor in aerodynamic drag on a particle in creeping flow. 
 
Analysis 
It turns out that fluid density drops out of the creeping flow equations, since the terms that contain  in 
the Navier-Stokes equation are negligibly small compared to the pressure and viscous terms (which do not contain 
). Another way to think about this is: In creeping flow, there is no fluid inertia, and since inertia is associated with fluid 
mass (density), density cannot contribute to the aerodynamic drag on a particle moving in creeping flow. In creeping flow, 
there is a balance between pressure forces and viscous forces, neither of which depend on fluid density. 
 
Discussion 
Density does have an indirect influence on creeping flow drag. Namely,  is needed in the Reynolds 
number calculation, and Re determines whether the flow is in the creeping flow regime or not. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10-17C 
Solution 
We are to name each term in the Navier-Stokes equation, and then discuss which terms remain when the 
creeping flow approximation is made.  
 
Analysis 
The terms in the equation are identified as follows: 
 
 
I 
Unsteady term 
 
II 
Inertial term 
 
III 
Pressure term 
 
IV 
Gravity term 
 
V 
Viscous term 
 
When the creeping flow approximation is made, only terms III (pressure) and V (viscous) remain. The other three terms 
are very small compared to these two and can be ignored. The significance is that all unsteady and inertial effects (terms I 
and II) have disappeared, as has gravity. We are left with a flow in which pressure forces and viscous forces must balance. 
Another significant result is that density has disappeared from the creeping flow equation, as discussed in the text. 
 
Discussion 
There are other acceptable one-word descriptions of some of the terms in the equation. For example, the 
inertial term can also be called the convective term, the advective term, or the acceleration term.

Reynold’s number seems to be beyond the range of validity of the Stokes’ equation. This probably causes too large error in 
the prediction.  If we used the general form of the equation (see Prob. 102 ) we would find V=60.1 mm/s, which is pretty 
close to the experimental result (60.4 mm/s).

Solution 
We are to estimate the maximum speed of honey through a hole such that the Reynolds number remains

At the higher temperature of 50oC, the calculations yield Vmax = 0.01174  0.012 m/s. Thus, it is much easier to achieve 
creeping flow with honey at lower temperatures since the viscosity of honey increases rapidly as the temperature drops. 
 
Discussion 
We used Re < 0.1 as the maximum Reynolds number for creeping flow, but experiments reveal that in 
many flows, the creeping flow approximation is acceptable at Reynolds numbers as high as nearly 1.0.

So, on an equal basis of comparison, the sperm swims faster than the human! This result is perhaps surprising since the 
human benefits from inertia, while the sperm feels no inertial effects. However, we must keep in mind that the sperm’s 
body is designed to swim, while the human body is designed for multiple uses – it is not optimized for swimming. 
 
Note: Students’ answers may differ widely since the measurements from the photograph are not very accurate. 
 
Discussion 
Perhaps a more fair comparison would be between a fish and a sperm.

Solution 
We are to calculate how fast air must move vertically to keep a water drop suspended in the air.  
 
Assumptions 1 The drop is spherical. 2 The creeping flow approximation is appropriate. 
 
Properties 
For air at T = 25oC,   = 1.184 kg/m3 and  = 1.849  10-5 kg/ms. The density of the water at T = 25oC is 
997.0 kg/m3. 
 
Analysis 
Since the drop is sitting still, its downward force must exactly balance its upward force when the vertical air 
speed V is “just right”. The downward force is the weight of the particle:

Discussion 
Notice that although air density does appear in the calculation of V, it is very small compared to the density 
of water. (If we ignore air in that calculation, we get the same answer to 3 significant digits. However, air is required in the 
calculation of Reynolds number – to verify that the creeping flow approximation is appropriate.

We recognize the Reynolds number based on gap height, Re = Vh0/. Since the pressure and viscous terms contain the 
product of 1/Re, which is large for creeping flow, and L/h0, which is also large, it is clear that the inertial terms (left side 
of Eq. 3) are negligibly small compared to the pressure and viscous terms. 
 
(c) Since the pressure and viscous terms contain the product of 1/Re and L/h0, when h0 << L, the creeping flow equations 
can still be appropriate even if Reynolds number is not less than one. For example, if L/h0 ~ 10,000 and Re ~ 10, the 
pressure and viscous terms are still three orders of magnitude larger than the inertial terms. 
 
Discussion 
In the limit as L/h0  , the inertial terms disappear regardless of the Reynolds number. This limiting case 
is the Couette flow problem of Chap. 9.

We recognize the Reynolds number based on gap height, Re = Vh0/. Since the pressure and viscous terms contain the 
product of 1/Re, which is large for creeping flow, and L/h0, which is also large, it is clear that the inertial terms (left side of 
Eq. 2) are negligibly small compared to the pressure and viscous terms. This is expected, of course, for creeping flow. Now 
we compare the pressure and viscous terms. Both contain 1/Re, but the pressure term has and additional factor of (L/h0)2, 
which is very large. Thus the pressure term is the only remaining term in Eq. 2. How can this be? Since there are no terms 
that can balance the pressure term, the pressure term itself must be very small. In other words, the y momentum equation 
reduces to 
Final form of y momentum:

In other words, pressure is a function of x, but a very weak, negligible function of y. 
 
Discussion 
The result here is very similar to that for boundary layers, where we also find that P/y  0 through the 
boundary layer.

We are to list boundary conditions and solve the x momentum equation for u. Then we are to

We recognize two distinct components of the velocity profile in Eq. 4, namely a Couette flow component and a Poiseuille 
flow component. Thus, the axial velocity is a superposition of Couette flow due to the moving bottom wall and Poiseuille 
flow due to the pressure gradient.

of h(x), the specific form of which was never specified. Thus, the solution of Problem 10-26 is still appropriate, and no 
further work needs to be done here. The result is

Solution 
We are to calculate , we are to calculate Pgage at a given x location, and we are to plot nondimensional gage 
pressure as a function of nondimensional axial distance for the case of a 
slipper-pad bearing with linearly decreasing gap height. Finally, we are to 
estimate the total force that this slipper-pad bearing can support. 
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 Gravity forces 
are negligible in the oil flow. 3 The flow is two-dimensional in the x-y 
plane. 4 P is not a function of y.

The gage pressure in the middle of the slipper-pad is more than 200 atmospheres. This is quite large, and illustrates how a 
small slipper-pad bearing can support a large amount of force. 
 
(c) We repeat the calculations of Part (b) for values of x between 0 and L. We nondimensionalize both x and Pgage using x* 
= x/L and P* = (P  Patm)h0
2/VL. A plot of P* versus x* is shown in Fig. 1. The gage pressure is constrained to be zero at 
both ends of the pad, but reaches a peak near the middle, but more towards the end. For these conditions the maximum 
value of P* is 1.0. 
 
(d) To calculate the total weight that the slipper-pad bearing can support, we integrate pressure over the surface area of the 
plate. We used the trapezoidal rule to integrate numerically in a spreadsheet. The result is

You can also obtain a reasonable estimate by simply taking the average pressure in the gap times the area – this yields Fload

Discussion 
This slipper-pad bearing can hold an enormous amount of weight (7 tons!) due to the extremely high 
pressures encountered in the oil passage.

Solution 
We are to discuss what happens to the load when the oil temperature increases.  
 
Analysis 
Oil viscosity appears only once in the equation for gap pressure. Thus, pressure and load increase linearly as 
oil viscosity increases. However, as the oil heats up, its viscosity goes down rapidly. For example, at T = 40oC,  = 0.2177 
kg/ms, but at T = 80oC,  drops to 0.03232 kg/ms. This is more than a factor of six decrease in viscosity for only a 20oC 
increase in temperature. So, the load would decrease rapidly as oil temperature rises. 
 
Discussion 
This problem illustrates why engineers need to look at extreme operating conditions when designing 
products – just in case. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10-33 
Solution 
We are to see if the Reynolds number is low enough that the flow can be approximated as creeping flow.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The flow is two-dimensional in the x-y plane. 
 
Properties 
Unused engine oil at T = 40oC:   = 876.0 kg/m3,  = 0.2177 kg/ms. 
 
Analysis 
We base Re on the largest gap height, h0, 
Reynolds number: 


We see that the Reynolds number is less than one, but we cannot say that Re << 1. So, the flow is not really in the creeping 
flow regime. However, the creeping flow approximation is generally reasonable up to Reynolds numbers near one. Also, as 
discussed in Problem 10-24, the creeping flow approximation is still reasonable in this case since L/h0 is so large.  
 
Discussion 
The error introduced by making the creeping flow approximation is probably less than the error associated 
with measurement of gap height. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10-34 
  
 
Solution 
We are to calculate how much the gap compresses when the load on the bearing is doubled. 
 
Analysis 
There are several ways to approach this problem: You can try to integrate the pressure distribution 
analytically to calculate the total load, or you can integrate numerically on a spreadsheet or math program. This is an 
“inverse” problem in that we can calculate the load for a given value of h0, but we cannot do the reverse calculation directly 
– we must do it implicitly. One way to do this is graphically – plot load as a function of h0, and pick off the value of h0 
where the load has doubled. Another way is by trial and error, or by a convergence technique like Newton’s method. It 
turns out that the load is doubled when h0 = 0.0008535 inches (2.168  10-5 m). This represents a decrease in initial 
gap height of about 14.7%. 
 
Discussion 
The relationship between gap height and load is clearly nonlinear. When the load doubles, the gap height 
decreases by less than 15%.

Solution 
We are to estimate the speed at which a human being swimming in water would be in the creeping flow 
regime.  
 
Properties 
For water at T = 20oC,   = 998.0 kg/m3 and  = 1.002  10-3 kg/ms. 
 
Analysis 
The characteristic length scale of a human body is of order 1 m. To be in the creeping flow regime, the 
Reynolds number of the body should be below 1. Thus,

So, we would have to move at about one-millionth of a meter per second, or less. This speed is so slow that it is not 
measurable. Natural currents in the water, even in a “stagnant” pool of water, would be much greater than this. Hence, we 
could never experience creeping flow in water. 
 
Discussion 
If we were to use a Reynolds number of 0.1 instead of 1, the result would be even slower. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10-36  
Solution 
For each case we are to calculate the Reynolds number and determine if the creeping flow approximation is 
appropriate.  
 
Assumptions 1 The values given are characteristic scales of the motion. 
 
Properties 
For water at T = 20oC,   = 998.0 kg/m3 and  = 1.002  10-3 kg/ms. For unused engine oil at T = 140oC,   
= 816.8 kg/m3 and  = 6.558  10-3 kg/ms. For air at T = 30oC,   = 1.164 kg/m3 and  = 1.872  10-5 kg/ms.

At room temperature, the oil viscosity increases by a factor of more than a hundred, and the Reynolds 
number of the bearing of Part (b) would be of order 10-2, which is in the creeping flow range.

Solution 
We are to estimate the speed and Reynolds number from a multiple-image photograph.  
 
Assumptions 1 The characteristic speed is taken as the average over 10 images.

For water at T = 20oC,   = 998.0 kg/m3 and  = 1.002  10-3 kg/ms. 
 
Analysis 
By measurement with a ruler, we estimate the sperm’s diameter as 2.4 m, and it moves about 7.7 m in 10

Note: Students’ answers may differ widely since the measurements from the photograph are not very accurate. We report 
the final answer to only two significant digits because of the inherent error in measuring distances from the photograph. 
 
Discussion 
If you use the cell’s length rather than its diameter as the characteristic length scale, Re increases by a factor 
of about two, but the flow is still well within the creeping flow regime.

Inviscid Flow 
 
 
 
 
10-38C 
Solution 
We are to discuss the main difference between the steady, incompressible Bernoulli equation when applied 
to irrotational regions of flow vs. rotational but inviscid regions of flow.  
 
Analysis 
The Bernoulli equation itself is identical in these two cases, but the “constant” for the case of rotational but 
inviscid regions of flow is constant only along streamlines of the flow, not everywhere. For irrotational regions of flow, 
the same Bernoulli constant holds everywhere. 
 
Discussion 
A simple example is that of solid body rotation, which is rotational but inviscid. In this flow, as discussed in 
the text, the Bernoulli “constant” changes from one streamline to another. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10-39C 
Solution 
We are to discuss the approximation associated with the Euler equation.  
 
Analysis 
The Euler equation is simply the Navier-Stokes equation with the viscous term neglected; it is therefore an 
inviscid approximation of the Navier-Stokes equation. The Euler equation is appropriate in high Reynolds number 
regions of the flow where net viscous forces are negligible, far away from walls and wakes. 
 
Discussion 
The Euler equation is not appropriate very close to solid walls, since frictional forces are always present 
there. Note that the same Euler equation is appropriate in an irrotational region of flow as well. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10-40 
Solution 
We are to show that the region of flow given by this velocity field is inviscid.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The flow is incompressible. 3 The flow is two-dimensional in the x-y plane.

Since the viscous terms are identically zero in both components of the Navier-Stokes equation, this region of flow can

With the viscous terms removed, the Navier-Stokes equation is reduced to the Euler equation.

Solution 
We are to use an alternative method to show that the Euler equation given in the problem statement reduces 
to the Bernoulli equation for regions of inviscid flow. 
 
Analysis 
We take the dot product of both sides of the equation with V

The cross product on the right side of Eq. 1 is a vector that is perpendicular to V

Now we use the same argument on the left hand side of Eq. 2, but in 
reverse. Namely, there are three ways for the dot product of the two 
vectors in Eq. 2 to be identically zero: (a) the first vector is zero,

Option (a) represents the restricted case in which the quantity in

in which there is no flow (fluid statics). Option (c) is the most general 
option, and we work with Eq. 5. Since V

 must therefore be everywhere

Solution 
We are to calculate the pressure field and the shape of the free surface for solid body rotation of water in a 
container.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The flow is rotationally symmetric, meaning that all derivatives 
with respect to  are zero. 3 Gravity acts in the negative z direction. 
 
Properties 
For water at T = 20oC,   = 998.0 kg/m3 and  = 1.002  10-3 kg/ms. 
 
Analysis 
We reduce the components of the Euler equation in cylindrical coordinates (Problem 10-41) as far as 
possible, noting that ur = uz = 0 and u = r. The  component disappears. The r component reduces to

not needed here.

Solution 
We are to calculate the pressure field and the shape of the free surface for solid body rotation of engine oil

Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The flow is rotationally symmetric, meaning that all derivatives

Analysis 
In Problem 10-44, water density appears only as a constant in the pressure equation. Thus, nothing is 
different here except the value of density, and the results are identical to those of Problem 10-44. 
 
Discussion 
In solid body rotation, the density of the fluid does not affect the shape of the free surface. For oil (less 
dense than water), pressure increases with depth at a slower rate compared to water.

Solution 
For a given volume flow rate, we are to generate an expression for ur assuming inviscid flow, and then 
discuss the velocity profile shape for a real (viscous) flow. 
 
Assumptions 1 The flow remains radial at all times (no u component). 2 The flow is steady, two-dimensional, and 
incompressible. 
 
Analysis 
If the flow were inviscid, we could not enforce the no-slip condition at the walls of the duct. At any r 
location, the volume flow rate must be the same, 
Volume flow rate at any r location: 
ru rb 


V
 
(1) 
where  is the angle over which the contraction is bound (see Fig. 1). 
Thus, 
 
ru
rb 

At radius r = R, Eq. 2 becomes 
Radial velocity at r = R: 

ru

V
 
(3) 
Upon substitution of Eq. 3 into Eq. 2, we get 
Radial velocity at any r location: 

r
r
R
u
u
R
r

 
(4) 
In other words, the radial velocity component increases as the reciprocal of r as r approaches zero (the origin). 
 
In a real flow (with viscous effects), we would expect that the velocity near the center of the duct is somewhat 
larger, while that near the walls is somewhat smaller. Right at the walls, of course, the velocity is zero by the no-slip 
condition. In Fig. 1 is a sketch of what the velocity profile might look like in a real flow. 
 
Discussion 
In either case, the radial velocity is infinite at the origin. This is actually a portion of a line sink, as 
discussed in this chapter.

Irrotational (Potential) Flow 
 
 
 
 
10-49C 
Solution 
We are to discuss D’Alembert’s paradox.   
 
Analysis 
D’Alembert’s paradox states that with the irrotational flow approximation, the aerodynamic drag force 
on any non-lifting body of any shape immersed in a uniform stream is zero. It is a paradox because we know from 
experience that bodies in a flow field have non-zero aerodynamic drag. 
 
Discussion 
Irrotational flow over a non-lifting immersed body has neither pressure drag nor viscous drag. In a real 
flow, both of these drag components are present.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
10-50C 
Solution 
We are to identify regions in the flow field that are irrotational, and regions that are rotational.  
 
Assumptions 1 The air in the room would be calm if not for the presence of the hair dryer. 
 
Analysis 
Flow in the air far away from the hair dryer and its jet is certainly irrotational. As the air approaches 
the inlet, it is irrotational except very close to the surface of the hair dryer. Flow in the jet is rotational, but flow 
outside of the jet can be approximated as irrotational. 
 
Discussion 
Flow near solid walls is nearly always rotational because of the viscous rotational boundary layer that grows 
there. There are sharp velocity gradients in a jet, so the vorticity cannot be zero in that region, and the flow must be 
rotational in the jet as well. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10-51C 
Solution 
We are to discuss the role of the momentum equation in an irrotational region of flow. 
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The region of interest in the flow field is irrotational. 
 
Analysis 
Although it is true that the momentum equation is not required in order to solve for the velocity field, it is 
required in order to solve for the pressure field. In particular, the Navier-Stokes equation reduces to the Bernoulli 
equation in an irrotational region of flow. 
 
Discussion 
Mathematically, it turns out that in an irrotational flow field the continuity equation is uncoupled from the 
momentum equation, meaning that we can solve continuity for  by itself, without need of the momentum equation. 
However, the momentum equation cannot be solved by itself.

Solution 
We are to discuss similarities and differences between two approximations: inviscid regions of flow and 
irrotational regions of flow. 
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is incompressible and steady. 
 
Analysis 
The two approximations are similar in that in both cases, the viscous terms in the Navier-Stokes equation 
drop out, leaving the Euler equation. Also, in both cases the Bernoulli equation results form integration of the Euler 
equation. However, these two approximations differ significantly from each other. When making the inviscid flow 
approximation, we assume that the viscous terms are negligibly small. A good example, as discussed in this chapter, is 
solid body rotation. In this case, although the fluid itself is viscous, all effects of viscosity are gone, and the flow field can 
be considered “inviscid” (although it is rotational). On the other hand, the irrotational approximation is made when the 
vorticity (a measure of rotationality of fluid particles) is negligibly small. In this case, viscosity still acts on fluid 
particles – it shears them and distorts them, yet the net rate of rotation of fluid particles is zero. In other words, in an 
irrotational region of flow, the net viscous force on a fluid particle is zero, but viscous stresses on the fluid particle are 
certainly not zero. Examples of irrotational, but viscous flows include any irrotational flow field with curved streamlines, 
such as a line vortex, a doublet, irrotational flow over a circular cylinder, etc. Freestream flow is both inviscid and 
irrotational since fluid particles do not shear or distort or rotate, and viscosity does not enter into the picture. 
 
Discussion 
In either case, the viscous terms in the Navier-Stokes equation disappear, but for different reasons. In the 
inviscid flow approximation, the viscous terms disappear because we neglect viscosity. In the irrotational flow 
approximation, the viscous terms disappear because they cancel each other out due to the fact that the vorticity (hence the 
rate of rotation) of fluid particles is negligibly small. 
 
 
 
 
 
10-53C 
Solution 
We are to discuss the flow property that determines whether a region of flow is rotational or irrotational. 
 
Analysis 
The vorticity determines whether a region of flow is rotational or irrotational. Specifically, if the vorticity is 
zero (or negligibly small), the flow is approximated as irrotational, but if the vorticity is not negligibly small, the flow is 
rotational. 
 
Discussion 
Another acceptable answer is the rate of rotation vector or the angular velocity vector of a fluid particle. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10-54 
Solution 
We are to compare the Bernoulli equation and its restrictions for inviscid, rotational regions of flow and 
viscous, irrotational regions of flow. 
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is incompressible and steady. 
 
Analysis 
The Bernoulli equation is the same in both cases, namely 
Steady incompressible Bernoulli equation: 
2

P
V
gz
C



 
(1) 
However, in an inviscid, rotational region of flow, Eq. 1 is applicable only along a streamline. The Bernoulli “constant” C 
is constant along any particular streamline, but may change from streamline to streamline. In a viscous, irrotational region 
of flow, however, the Bernoulli constant is constant everywhere, even across streamlines. Thus, the inviscid, rotational 
region of flow has more restrictions on the use of the Bernoulli equation. 
 
Discussion 
In either case, the viscous terms in the Navier-Stokes equation disappear, but for different reasons.

Solution 
For a given set of streamlines, we are to sketch the 
corresponding set of equipotential curves and explain how we obtain 
them.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The flow is 
two-dimensional in the plane of the figure associated with this problem. 
3 The flow in the region shown in the figure is irrotational. 
 
Analysis 
Some possible equipotential lines are sketched in 
Fig. 1. We draw these based on the fact that the streamlines and 
equipotential curves must intersect at 90o angles. To find the “correct” 
shape, it helps to sketch a few extra streamlines in between the given 
ones to guide in construction of the equipotential curves. These 
“interpolated” streamlines are shown in Fig. 1 as thin, dotted blue lines. 
 
Discussion 
The exact shape of the equipotential curves is not 
known, and individuals may sketch curves of other shapes that are 
equally valid. The important thing to emphasize is that the curves of 
constant  are everywhere perpendicular to the streamlines.

Solution 
For a given velocity field, we are to assess whether the flow field is irrotational. If so, we are to generate an 
expression for the velocity potential function. 
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The flow is incompressible. 3 The flow is two-dimensional in the x-y plane.

For the flow to be irrotational, the vorticity must be zero. Since the flow is planar in the x-y plane, the only

Solution 
We are to generate expressions for the stream function and the velocity potential function for a line source, 
beginning with the first equation above.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The flow is irrotational in the region of interest. 3 The flow is 
two-dimensional in the x-y or r- plane.

Solution 
We are to show that the stream function for a planar irrotational region of flow satisfies the Laplace 
equation in cylindrical coordinates.  
 
Assumptions 1 This region of flow is planar in the r- plane. 2 The flow is incompressible. 3 This region of flow is 
irrotational.

Since Eq. 3 is the Laplace equation for 2-D planar flow in the r- plane, we have shown that the stream function indeed 
satisfies the Laplace equation. 
 
Discussion 
Since the Laplace equation for stream function is satisfied in Cartesian coordinates for the case of 2-D 
planar flow in the x-y plane, it must also be satisfied for the same flow in cylindrical coordinates. All we have done is use a 
different coordinate system to describe the same flow.

Solution 
We are to write the Laplace equation in two dimensions (r and ) in spherical polar coordinates. 
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is independent of angle  (about the x axis). 2 The flow is irrotational. 
 
Analysis 
We look up the Laplace equation in spherical polar coordinates in any vector analysis book. Ignoring 
derivatives with respect to , we get

Solution 
We are to prove that the given stream function exactly satisfies the continuity equation for the case of 
axisymmetric flow in spherical polar coordinates.

The flow is incompressible.

Equation 2 is identically satisfied as long as  is a smooth function of r and . 
 
Discussion 
If  were not smooth, the order of differentiation (r then  versus  then r) would be important and Eq. 2 
would not necessarily be zero. In the definition of stream function, it is somewhat arbitrary whether we put the negative 
sign on ur or u, and you may find the opposite sign convention in other textbooks.

Solution 
For a given velocity field, we are to assess whether the flow field is irrotational. If so, we are to generate an 
expression for the velocity potential function. 
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The flow is incompressible. 3 The flow is two-dimensional in the x-y plane.  
 
Analysis 
For the flow to be irrotational, the vorticity must be zero. Since the flow is planar in the x-y plane, the only 
non-zero component of vorticity is in the z direction,

Since the vorticity is not zero, this flow field cannot be considered irrotational, and we cannot generate a velocity 
potential function that describes the flow. We cannot continue – the solution stops here. 
 
Discussion 
Fluid particles in this region of flow apparently have significant rotation.

Solution 
We are to show that the vorticity components are zero in an irrotational region of flow.

which is valid as long as  is a smooth function of r and z. Thus all three components of vorticity are zero. 
 
Discussion 
By mathematical identity, the velocity potential function is definable only when the vorticity vector is zero; 
therefore the results are not surprising. Note that in a three-dimensional flow,  must be a smooth function of r, , and z.

Solution 
We are to calculate Reynolds number and estimate maximum and minimum pressure and speed for 
potential flow over a circular cylinder. 
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is two-dimensional, and thus the end effects (front and back of the cylinder) are negligible. 2 
The flow is far enough in extent so that there are negligible boundary effects.

Or, Re = 1.00  105 to three significant digits. This Re is sufficiently high that potential flow should be a 
reasonable approximation, but only along the front portion of the cylinder, as discussed in the text. 
 
(b) The minimum speed occurs at the stagnation point, where |V|min = 0. This is also the location of the maximum 
pressure. We use the Bernoulli equation to estimate the pressure at the stagnation point,

Keep in mind that the potential flow analysis is an approximation – it assumes irrotational flow everywhere, 
whereas we know that the flow is rotational in the boundary layer very close to the cylinder wall.

Boundary Layers 
 
 
 
 
 
10-72C 
Solution 
We are to name three flows (other than flow along a wall) where the boundary layer approximation is 
appropriate, and we are to explain why.  
 
Analysis 
The boundary layer approximation is appropriate for the three basic types of shear layers: wakes, jets, and 
mixing layers. These flows have a predominant flow direction, and for high Reynolds numbers, the shear layer is very thin, 
causing the viscous terms to be much smaller than the inertial terms, just as in the case of a boundary layer along a wall. 
 
Discussion 
For the wake and the mixing layer, there is an irrotational outer flow in the streamwise direction, but for the 
jet, the flow outside the jet is nearly stagnant. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10-73C 
Solution 
  
(a) False: If the Reynolds number at a given x location were to increase, all else being equal, viscous forces would 
decrease in magnitude relative to inertial forces, rendering the boundary layer thinner. 
(b) False: Actually, as V increases, so does Re, and the boundary layer thickness decreases with increasing Reynolds 
number.  
(c) True: Since  appears in the denominator of the Reynolds number, Re decreases as  increases, causing the boundary 
layer thickness to increase. 
(d) False: Since  appears in the numerator of the Reynolds number, Re increases as  increases, causing the boundary 
layer thickness to decrease. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10-74C 
Solution 
We are to explain why the boundary layer approximation bridges the gap between the Euler equation and 
the Navier-Stokes equation. 
 
Analysis 
The Euler equation neglects the viscous terms compared to the inertial terms. For external flow around a 
body, this is a reasonable approximation over the majority of the flow field, except very close to the body, where viscous 
effects dominate. The Navier-Stokes equation, on the other hand, includes both viscous and inertial terms, but is much more 
difficult to solve. The boundary layer equations bridge the gap between these two: we solve the simpler Euler equation 
away from walls, and then fit in a thin boundary layer to account for the no-slip condition at walls. 
 
Discussion 
Students’ discussions should be in their own words.

Streamlines 
Boundary layer 
10-75C 
Solution 
 We are to sketch several streamlines and discuss whether the curve representing (x) is a streamline or not. 
 
Analysis 
Five streamlines are sketched in Fig. 1. In order to satisfy conservation of mass, the streamlines must 
cross the curve (x). Thus, (x) cannot itself be a streamline of the flow. 
 
 
Discussion 
As the boundary layer grows in thickness, streamlines diverge slowly away from the wall (and become 
farther apart from each other) in order to conserve mass. However, the upward displacement of the streamlines is not as fast 
as the growth of (x). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10-76C 
Solution 
We are to define trip wire and explain its purpose.  
 
Analysis 
A trip wire is a rod or wire stretched normal to the streamwise direction along the wall. Its purpose is 
to create a large disturbance in the laminar boundary layer that causes the boundary layer to “trip” to turbulence much more 
quickly than it would otherwise. 
 
Discussion 
Dimples on a golf ball serve the same purpose. 
 
 
 
 
 
10-77C 
Solution 
We are to discuss the role of an inflection point in a boundary layer profile.  
 
Analysis 
As sketched in Fig. 10-124, the existence of an inflection point in the boundary layer profile indicates 
an adverse or unfavorable pressure gradient. The reason for this is due to the fact that the second derivative of the 
velocity profile u(y) at the wall is directly proportional to the pressure gradient (Eq. 10-86). In an adverse pressure gradient 
field, dP/dx is positive, and thus, 2u/y2)y = 0 is also positive. However, since 2u/y2 must be negative as u approaches U(x) 
at the edge of the boundary layer, there has to be an inflection point (2u/y2 = 0) somewhere in the boundary layer. 
 
Discussion 
If the adverse pressure gradient is large enough, the boundary layer separates off the wall, leading to reverse 
flow near the wall.

10-78C 
Solution 
We are to compare laminar and turbulent boundary layer separation, and explain why golf balls have 
dimples.  
 
Analysis 
Turbulent boundary layers are more “full” than are laminar boundary layers. Because of this, a 
turbulent boundary layer is much less likely to separate compared to a laminar boundary layer under the same 
adverse pressure gradient. A smooth golf ball, for example, would maintain a laminar boundary layer on its surface, and 
the boundary layer would separate fairly easily, leading to large aerodynamic drag. Golf balls have dimples (a type of 
surface roughness) in order to create an early transition to a turbulent boundary layer. Flow still separates from the 
golf ball surface, but much farther downstream in the boundary layer, resulting in significantly reduced aerodynamic drag. 
 
Discussion 
Turbulent boundary layers have more skin friction drag than do laminar boundary layers, but this effect is 
less significant than the pressure drag caused by flow separation. Thus, a rough golf ball (at appropriate Reynolds numbers) 
ends up with less overall drag, compared to a smooth golf ball at the same conditions. 
 
 
 
 
 
10-79C 
Solution 
We are to list the five steps of the boundary layer procedure.  
 
Analysis 
We list the five steps below, with a description of each: 
 
Step 1 Solve for the outer flow, ignoring the boundary layer (assuming that the region of flow outside the boundary layer 
is approximately inviscid and/or irrotational). Transform coordinates as necessary to obtain U(x). 
Step 2 Assume a thin boundary layer – so thin in fact that it does not affect the outer flow solution of Step 1. 
Step 3 Solve the boundary layer equations. For this step we use the no-slip boundary condition at the wall, u = v = 0 at y = 
0, the known outer flow condition at the edge of the boundary layer, u  U(x) as y  , and some known starting 
profile, u = ustarting(y) at x = xstarting. 
Step 4 Calculate quantities of interest in the flow field. For example, once the boundary layer equations have been solved 
(Step 3), we can calculate (x), shear stress along the wall, total skin friction drag, etc. 
Step 5 Verify that the boundary layer approximations are appropriate. In other words, verify that the boundary layer is 
indeed thin – otherwise the approximation is not justified. 
 
Discussion 
Students’ discussions should be in their own words. 
 
 
 
 
 
10-80C 
Solution 
We are to list at least three “red flags” to look for when performing boundary layer calculations.  
 
Analysis 
We list four below. (Students are asked to list at least three.) 
 
- 
The boundary layer approximation breaks down if Reynolds number is not large enough. For example, /L ~ 0.01 
(1%) for ReL = 10,000. 
- 
The assumption of zero pressure gradient in the y direction breaks down if wall curvature is of similar magnitude 
as . In such cases, centripetal acceleration effects due to streamline curvature cannot be ignored. Physically, the 
boundary layer is not “thin” enough for the approximation to be appropriate when  is not << R. 
- 
When Reynolds number is too high, the boundary layer does not remain laminar. The boundary layer 
approximation itself may still be appropriate, but the laminar boundary layer equations are not valid if the flow is 
transitional or fully turbulent. The laminar boundary layer on a smooth flat plate under clean flow conditions 
begins to transition towards turbulence at Rex  1  105. In practical engineering applications, walls may not be 
smooth and there may be vibrations, noise, and fluctuations in the freestream flow above the wall, all of which 
contribute to an even earlier start of the transition process. 
- 
If flow separation occurs, the boundary layer approximation is no longer appropriate in the separated flow region. 
The main reason for this is that a separated flow region contains reverse flow, and the parabolic nature of the 
boundary layer equations is lost.

Students’ discussions should be in their own words.

Solution 
We are to define displacement thickness and discuss whether it is larger or smaller than boundary layer 
thickness.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The boundary layer growing on the flat plate is laminar. 
 
Analysis 
The two definitions of displacement thickness are: 
 
 
Displacement thickness is the distance that a streamline just outside of the boundary layer is deflected away from 
the wall due to the effect of the boundary layer. 
 
Displacement thickness is the imaginary increase in thickness of the wall, as seen by the outer flow, due to the 
effect of the growing boundary layer. 
  
For a laminar boundary layer,   is larger than *.  is defined by the overall thickness of the boundary layer, whereas * 
is an integrated thickness across the boundary layer that averages the mass deficit across the boundary layer. Therefore, it is 
not surprising that * is less than . 
 
Discussion 
The definitions given by students should be in their own words. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10-82C 
Solution 
We are to discuss the difference between a favorable and an adverse pressure gradient.  
 
Analysis 
When the pressure decreases downstream, the boundary layer is said to experience to a favorable 
pressure gradient. When the pressure increases downstream, the boundary layer is subjected to an adverse pressure 
gradient. The term “favorable” is used because the boundary layer is unlikely to separate off the wall. On the other hand, 
“adverse” or “unfavorable” indicates that the boundary layer is more likely to separate off the wall. 
 
Discussion 
A favorable pressure gradient occurs typically at the front of a body, whereas an adverse pressure gradient 
occurs typically at the back portion of a body.

Solution 
We are to calculate the location of transition and turbulence along a flat plate boundary layer.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is incompressible and steady in the mean. 2 Free stream disturbances are small. 3 The surface of 
the plate is very smooth. 
 
Properties 
The density and viscosity of air at T = 30oC are 1.164 kg/m3 and 1.872  10-5 kg/ms respectively. 
 
Analysis 
Transition begins at the critical Reynolds number, which is approximately 100,000 for “clean” flow along a 
smooth flat plate. Thus,

That is, transition begins at x  5 or 6 cm. Fully turbulent flow in the boundary layer occurs at approximately 30 times 
xcritical, at Rex,transition  3  106. So, the boundary layer is expected to be fully turbulent by x  1.5 to 1.8 m, or to one digit,  x 
 2 m. 
 
Discussion 
Final results are given to only one significant digit, since the locations of transition and turbulence are only 
approximations. The actual locations are influenced by many things, such as noise, roughness, vibrations, free stream 
disturbances, etc.

Solution 
We are to assess whether the boundary layer on the hull of a boat is laminar or turbulent or transitional.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The hull surface is smooth. 
 
Properties 
The density and viscosity of water at T = 40oF are 62.42 lbm/ft3 and 1.038  10-3 lbm/fts, respectively. The 
kinematic viscosity is thus  = 1.663  10-5 ft2/s. 
 
Analysis 
Although the hull is not a flat plate, the flat plate boundary layer values are useful as a reasonable 
approximation to determine whether the boundary layer is laminar or turbulent. We calculate the Reynolds number at the 
trailing edge of the hull, using L as the approximate streamwise distance along the flat plate,

The critical Reynolds number for transition to turbulence is 1  105 for the case of a smooth flat plate with very clean, low-
noise free stream conditions. Our Reynolds number is much higher than this. The engineering value of critical Reynolds 
number for real engineering flows is Rex,cr = 5  105. Our Rex is much higher than this. The typical value where a smooth 
flat plate BL becomes fully turbulent is Rex,transition (3  106), and our Rex is much higher than this. Thus, the boundary 
layer is fully turbulent by the trailing edge of the hull.  
 
Discussion 
In a real-life situation, the free stream flow is not very “clean” – there are eddies and other disturbances, the 
hull surface is not perfectly smooth, and the vehicle may be vibrating. Thus, transition and turbulence are likely to occur 
much earlier than predicted for a smooth flat plate, and the boundary layer is probably fully turbulent for most of the hull.

Solution 
We are to assess whether the boundary layer on the surface of a sign is laminar or turbulent or transitional.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The sign surface is smooth. 
 
Properties 
The density and viscosity of air at T = 25oC are 1.184 kg/m3 and 1.849  10-5 kg/ms respectively. The 
kinematic viscosity is thus  = 1.562  10-5 m2/s. 
 
Analysis 
Since the air flow is parallel to the sign, this flow is that of a flat plate boundary layer. We calculate the 
Reynolds number at the downstream edge of the sign, using W as the streamwise distance along the flat plate,

The critical Reynolds number for transition to turbulence is 1  105 for the case of a smooth flat plate with very clean, low-
noise freestream conditions. Our Reynolds number is higher than this, but just barely so. The engineering value of critical 
Reynolds number for transition to a turbulent boundary layer in real engineering flows is Rex,cr = 5  105; our value of Rex 
is less than Rex,cr. Since Rex is a bit greater than Rex,critical, but less than Rex,cr (5  105), and much less than Rex,transition (30  
105), the boundary layer is laminar for a while, and then becomes transitional by the trailing edge of the fin.  
 
Discussion 
The flow over the sign is not very “clean” – there are eddies from the passing vehicles, and other 
atmospheric disturbances. In addition, the sign surface is not perfectly smooth, and most signs tend to oscillate somewhat in 
the wind. Thus, transition and turbulence are likely to occur much earlier than predicted for a smooth flat plate. The 
boundary layer on this sign is definitely transitional, but probably not turbulent, by the downstream edge of the sign.

Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The surface of the wind tunnel is smooth. 3 There are minimal

Properties 
The density and viscosity of air at T = 80oF are 0.07350 lbm/ft3 and 1.247  10-5 lbm/fts respectively. The 
kinematic viscosity is thus  = 1.697  10-4 ft2/s.

The engineering value of critical Reynolds number for transition to a turbulent boundary layer in real engineering flows is 
Rex,cr = 5  105; our value of Rex is much less than Rex,cr. In fact, our Reynolds number is even lower than the critical 
Reynolds number for transition to turbulence (1  105) for the case of a smooth flat plate with very clean, low-noise 
freestream conditions. Since the flow is clean and Rex is less than Rex,critical, the boundary layer is definitely laminar.  
 
Discussion 
There is typically a contraction just upstream of the test section of a wind tunnel. Upstream of that are 
typically some screens and/or honeycombs to make the flow clean and uniform. Thus, the disturbances are likely to be quite 
small, and the boundary layer is most likely laminar.

Solution 
We are to generate an expression for the outer flow velocity at point 2 in the boundary layer.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady, incompressible, and laminar. 2 The boundary layer approximation is appropriate. 
 
Analysis 
The boundary layer approximation tells us that P is constant normal to the boundary layer, but not 
necessarily along the boundary layer. Therefore, at any streamwise location along the boundary layer, the pressure in the 
outer flow region just above the boundary layer is the same as that at the wall. In the outer flow region, the Bernoulli 
equation reduces to

The Bernoulli equation is valid in the outer flow region. Thus, we know that as P increases, U decreases, 
and vice-versa. In this case, P increases, and thus we expect U2 to be less than U1. From the results of Problem 10-74,

The approximation is first order, and thus appropriate only if the distance between x1 and x2 is small.

Solution 
We are to calculate , *, and  at the end of the wind tunnel test section.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The surface of the wind tunnel is smooth. 3 The boundary layer 
remains laminar all the way to the end of the test section. 
 
Properties 
The density and viscosity of air at T = 80oF are 0.07350 lbm/ft3 and 1.247  10-5 lbm/fts respectively. 
 
Analysis 
In Problem 10-73E, we calculated the Reynolds number at the downstream end of the wall, Rex = 6.63  104 
(keeping an extra digit for the calculations). All of the desired quantities are functions of Rex:

Since turbulent boundary layers are fuller than laminar boundary layers, it is no surprise that Hturbulent is 
closer to unity than is Hlaminar.

Thus the air speed increases by approximately 6% through the test section, due to the effect of displacement thickness. 
 
The result for the square test section is identical to that of the round test section. We might have expected the 
square test section to do better since its cross-sectional area is larger than that of the round test section. However, the square 
test section also has more wall surface area than does the round test section, and thus, the acceleration due to displacement 
thickness on the walls is the same in both cases.

different equation for *(x) is required.

We have kept 5 digits of precision in intermediate steps, but report our final answer to three significant

vibrating, we might expect the boundary layer to be transitional, and then the apparent thickness would be greater.

Thus the air speed increases by approximately 3.3% through the test section, due to the effect of displacement thickness. 
 
To eliminate this acceleration, the engineers can either diverge the test section walls, or add some suction 
along the sides to remove some air.

The same displacement thickness technique may be applied to turbulent boundary layers; however, a 
different equation for *(x) is required.

Solution 
We are to determine if a boundary layer is laminar, turbulent, or transitional, and then compare the laminar 
and turbulent boundary layer thicknesses.  
 
Properties 
The kinematic viscosity of air at 70oF is  = 1.643  10-4 ft2/s. 
 
Analysis 
First, we calculate the Reynolds number at the end of the plate, 
Rex, end of plate:

The engineering value of critical Reynolds number for transition to a turbulent boundary layer in real engineering flows is 
Rex,cr = 5  105; our value of Rex is greater than Rex,cr, leading us to suspect that the boundary layer is turbulent. However, 
Rex is lower than the transition Reynolds number, Rex,transition  3  106, for a smooth flat plate with a clean free stream. 
Thus, we suspect that this boundary layer is laminar at the front of the plate, and then transitional farther 
downstream. If the plate is vibrating and/or the freestream is noisy, the boundary layer may possibly be fully turbulent by 
the end of the plate. 
 
If the boundary layer were to remain laminar to the end of the plate, its thickness would be 
Laminar:

Thus, the turbulent boundary layer thickness is about 4.5 to 4.9 times thicker than the corresponding laminar boundary 
layer thickness at the same Reynolds number. We expect the actual boundary layer thickness to lie somewhere between 
these two extremes. 
 
Discussion 
The difference between the two turbulent boundary layer equations for  is about 7 or 8 percent. This is 
larger than we might hope, but keep in mind that at Rex = 1.00  106, the boundary layer is not yet fully turbulent, and the 
equations for  are not accurate at such low Reynolds numbers.

We design the scoop height to be greater than or equal to the boundary layer thickness at the location of the scoop. Thus, 
we set h    26. mm, or about an inch. 
 
Discussion 
The suction pressure of the scoop must be adjusted carefully so as not to suck too much or too little – 
otherwise it would disturb the flow. Since the early portion of the boundary layer is laminar, the actual boundary layer 
thickness will be somewhat lower than that calculated here. Thus, our calculation represents an upper limit. However, some 
of the large turbulent eddies in the boundary layer may actually exceed height , so our calculated h may actually not be 
sufficient to remove the complete boundary layer.

Solution 
We are to plot the mean boundary layer profile u(y) at the 
end of a flat plate using three different approximations. 
 
Assumptions 1 The plate is smooth. 2 The boundary layer is turbulent 
from the beginning of the plate. 3 The flow is steady in the mean. 4 The 
plate is infinitesimally thin and is aligned parallel to the freestream. 
 
Properties 
The kinematic viscosity of air at 20oC is  = 1.516  10-5 
m2/s. 
 
Analysis 
First we calculate the Reynolds number at x = L,

This value of Rex is well above the transitional Reynolds number for a 
flat plate boundary layer, so the assumption of turbulent flow from the 
beginning of the plate is reasonable. 
 
Using the column (a) values of Table 10-4, we estimate the 
boundary layer thickness and the local skin friction coefficient at the end 
of the plate,

Since we know that u varies from 0 at the wall to U at the boundary layer edge, we are also able to plot the log law velocity 
profile in physical variables. Finally, Spalding’s law of the wall is also written in terms of y as a function of u. We plot all 
three profiles on the same plot for comparison (Fig. 1). All three are close, and we cannot distinguish the log law from 
Spalding’s law on this scale. 
 
Discussion 
Neither the one-seventh-power law nor the log law are valid real close to the wall, but Spalding’s law is 
valid all the way to the wall. However, on the scale shown in Fig. 1, we cannot see the differences between the log law and 
the Spalding law very close to the wall.

The ratios are */ = 1/2 = 0.500, and / = 1/6 = 0.167, to three significant digits. We compare these approximate 
results to those obtained from the Blasius solution, i.e., */ = 1.72/4.91 = 0.350, and / = 0.664/4.91 = 0.135. Thus, our 
approximate velocity profile yields */ to about 43% error, and / to about 23% error.  
 
Discussion 
The linear approximation is not very accurate.

Compared to the Blasius result, /x = 4.91/

Discussion 
The Kármán integral equation is useful for obtaining approximate relations, and is “forgiving” because of 
the integration. Even so, the linear approximation is not very good. Nevertheless, a 30% error is sometimes reasonable for 
“back of the envelope” calculations. The sine wave approximation does much better, as in Prob. 10-114.

Thus, the shape factor for a laminar boundary layer is about twice that of turbulent boundary layer. This implies that 
the smaller the value of H, the more full is the boundary layer. We may also infer that the smaller the value of H, the less 
likely is the boundary layer to separate. H depends on the shape of the velocity profile – hence its name, shape factor. 
 
Discussion 
In fact, at the separation point of a laminar boundary layer, H  3.5.

Solution 
We are to determine which orientation of a rectangular flat plate produces the higher drag.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The Reynolds number is high enough for a laminar boundary 
layer to form on the plate, but not high enough for the boundary layer to become turbulent. 
 
Analysis 
Reynolds number appears in the denominator of the equation for shear stress along the wall of a laminar 
boundary layer. Thus, wall shear stress decreases with increasing x, the distance down the plate. Hence, the average wall 
shear stress is higher for the case with the plate oriented with its short dimension aligned with the wind (case (b) of Fig. 
P10-80). Since the surface area of the plate is the same regardless of orientation, the plate with the higher average value of 
w has the higher overall drag. Case (b) has the higher drag. 
 
Discussion 
Another way to think about this problem is that since the boundary layer is thinner near the leading edge, 
the shear stress is higher there, and the front portion of the plate contributes to more of the total drag than does the rear 
portion of the plate.

We are to calculate the location of transition and turbulence along a flat plate boundary layer.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is incompressible and steady in the mean. 2 Free stream disturbances are small. 3 The surface of 
the plate is very smooth. 
 
Properties 
The density and viscosity of air at T = 30oC are 1.164 kg/m3 and 1.872  10-5 kg/ms respectively. 
 
Analysis 
Transition begins at the critical Reynolds number, which is approximately 100,000 for “clean” flow along a 
smooth flat plate. Thus,

That is, transition begins at x  4 to 5 cm. Fully turbulent flow in the boundary layer occurs at approximately 30 times 
xcritical, at Rex,transition  3  106. So, the boundary layer is expected to be fully turbulent by x  1.2 to 1.5 m, or to one digit,  x 
 1 to 2 m. 
 
Discussion 
Final results are given to only one significant digit, since the locations of transition and turbulence are only 
approximations. The actual locations are influenced by many things, such as noise, roughness, vibrations, free stream 
disturbances, etc.

Solution 
We are to assess whether the boundary layer on the bottom of a canoe is laminar or turbulent.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 Ridges, dings, and other non-uniformities in the bottom of the 
canoe are ignored – the bottom is assumed to be a smooth flat plate aligned exactly with the direction of flow. 3 From the 
frame of reference of the canoe, the water below the boundary layer under the canoe moves at uniform speed V = 3.5 mph. 
 
Properties 
The kinematic viscosity of water at T = 50oF is  = 1.407  10-5 ft2/s. 
 
Analysis 
First, we calculate the Reynolds number at the stern of the canoe,

Since Rex is much greater than Rex,cr (5  105), and is even greater than Rex,transition (50  105), the boundary layer is 
definitely turbulent by the back of the canoe. 
 
Discussion 
Since the canoe bottom is not perfectly smooth nor perfectly flat, and since we expect some disturbances in 
the lake water due to waves, the paddles, swimming fish, etc., transition to turbulence is expected to occur much earlier and 
more rapidly than illustrated for the ideal case in Fig. 10-81. Hence we are even more confident that this boundary layer is 
turbulent.

Solution 
  
(a) True: We do not have to make the 2-D approximation in order to define the velocity potential function –  can be 
defined for any flow if the vorticity is zero. 
(b) False: The stream function is definable for any two-dimensional flow field, regardless of the value of vorticity. 
(c) True: The velocity potential function is valid only for irrotational flow regions where the vorticity is zero. 
(d) True: The stream function is defined from the continuity equation, and is valid only for two-dimensional flows. Note 
that some researchers have defined three-dimensional forms of the stream function, but these are beyond the scope of 
the present introductory text book.

The viscous terms are zero, implying that there are no net viscous forces acting on fluid elements. This does not 
necessarily mean that the flow is inviscid – it could also mean that the flow is irrotational, since the viscous terms disappear 
in both inviscid and irrotational flows. We obtain the z component of vorticity in cylindrical coordinates from Chap. 4, 
z component of vorticity:

Thus, since the vorticity is non-zero, this flow field is rotational. Finally, since the flow is not irrotational, the only other 
way that the net viscous force can be zero is if the flow is inviscid. We conclude, then, that this flow field is also inviscid. 
 
Discussion 
The vorticity is twice the angular velocity, as discussed in Chap. 4.

Thus, we conclude that there are no viscous stresses in this flow field (solid body rotation). Thus, this flow can be 
considered inviscid. 
 
Discussion 
Since the fluid moves as a solid body, no fluid particles move relative to any other fluid particles; hence we 
expect no viscous stresses. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10-110 
Solution 
We are to compute the viscous term for the velocity field and show that the flow is irrotational.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The flow is two-dimensional in the r- plane. 
 
Analysis 
First, we write out and simplify the viscous terms of the  component of the Navier-Stokes equation,

The viscous terms are zero, implying that there are no net viscous forces acting on fluid elements. This does not 
necessarily mean that the flow is inviscid – it could also mean that the flow is irrotational, since the viscous terms disappear 
in both inviscid and irrotational flows. 
 
We obtain the z component of vorticity in cylindrical coordinates from Chap. 4,

Thus, since the vorticity is zero, this flow field is irrotational. 
 
Discussion 
We cannot say for sure whether the flow is inviscid unless we calculate the viscous shear stresses, as in the 
following problem.

Thus, we conclude that there are indeed some non-zero viscous stresses in this flow field. Hence, this flow is not inviscid, 
even though it is irrotational. 
 
Discussion 
The fluid particles move relative to each other, generating viscous shear stresses. However, the net viscous 
force on a fluid particle is zero since the flow is irrotational.

Solution 
We are to calculate modified pressure P and sketch profiles of P at two vertical locations in the pipe.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is incompressible. 2 Gravity acts vertically downward. 
3 There are no free surface effects in this flow field. 
 
Analysis 
By definition, modified pressure P = P + gz. So we add 
hydrostatic pressure component gz to the given profile P = Patm to obtain the 
profile for P. At any z location in the pipe,

We see that P is uniform at any vertical location (P does not vary radially), but P 
varies with elevation z. At z = z1,

(2) 
Comparing Eqs. 1 and 2, the modified pressure is higher at location z2 since z2 is 
higher in elevation than z1. In this problem there is no forced pressure gradient in 
terms of actual pressure. However, in terms of modified pressure, there is a linearly 
decreasing modified pressure along the axis of the pipe. In other words, there is a forced pressure gradient in terms of 
modified pressure.  
 
Discussion 
Since modified pressure eliminates the gravity term from the Navier-Stokes equation, we have replaced the 
effect of gravity by a gradient of modified pressure P. 
 
 
 
 
 
10-113 
Solution 
We are to calculate the required pressure drop between two axial locations of a horizontal pipe that would 
yield the same volume flow rate as that of the vertical pipe of Problem 10-106.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is incompressible. 2 Gravity acts vertically 
downward. 3 There are no free surface effects in this flow field. 
 
Analysis 
For the vertical case of Problem 10-106, we know that at 
z = z1,

(2) 
Since modified pressure effectively eliminates gravity from the problem, we expect that at the same volume flow rate, the 
difference in modified pressure from z2 to z1 does not change with changes in the orientation of the pipe. From Eqs. 1 and 2,

The modified pressure profiles at two axial locations in the horizontal pipe are sketched in Fig. 1. We convert the modified 
pressures in Eq. 3 to actual pressures using the definition of modified pressure, P = P  gz. We note however, that for the 
horizontal pipe, z does not change along the pipe. Thus we conclude that the required difference in actual pressure is

where z2 and z1 are the elevations of the vertical pipe case. 
 
Discussion 
In order to achieve the same flow rate, the forced pressure gradient in the horizontal case must be the same 
as the hydrostatic pressure difference supplied by gravity in the vertical case.

Solution 
We are to compare the sine wave approximation to the 
Blasius velocity profile.  
 
Analysis 
We plot both profiles in Fig. 1. There is not much 
difference between the two, and thus, the sine wave profile is a very 
good approximation of the Blasius profile. 
 
Discussion 
The slope of the two profiles at the wall is 
indistinguishable on the plot (Fig. 1); thus, the sine wave approximation 
should yield reasonable results for skin friction (shear stress) along the 
wall as well.

The ratios are */ = 0.363, and / = 0.137, to three significant digits. We compare these approximate results to 
those obtained from the Blasius solution, i.e., */ = 1.72/4.91 = 0.350, and / = 0.664/4.91 = 0.135. Thus, our 
approximate velocity profile yields */ to less than 4% error, and / to about 1% error.  
 
Discussion 
Integration is “forgiving”, and reasonable results can be obtained from integration, even when the velocity 
profile shape is not exact.

Design and Essay Problem 
 
 
 
 
10-139 
Solution 
We are to discuss the velocity overshoot in Fig. 10-136.  
 
Analysis 
The velocity overshoot is a direct result of the displacement effect and the effect of inertia. At very low 
values of ReL (less than about 101), where the displacement effect is most prominent, the velocity overshoot is almost non-
existent. This can be explained by the lack of inertia at these low Reynolds numbers. Without inertia, there is no 
mechanism to accelerate the flow around the plate; rather, viscosity retards the flow everywhere in the vicinity of the plate, 
and the influence of the plate extends tens of plate lengths beyond the plate in all directions. At moderate values of 
Reynolds number (ReL between about 101 and 104), the displacement effect is significant, and inertial terms are no longer 
negligible. Hence, fluid is able to accelerate around the plate and the velocity overshoot is significant. At very high values 
of Reynolds number (ReL > 104), inertial terms dominate viscous terms, and the boundary layer is so thin that the 
displacement effect is almost negligible – the small displacement effect leads to very small velocity overshoot at high 
Reynolds numbers. 
 
Discussion 
We can imagine that the flat plate appears thicker from the point of view of the outer flow, and therefore, 
the flow must accelerate around this “fat” plate.

Drag, Lift, and Drag Coefficients 
 
 
 
11-1C  
Solution 
We are to compare the speed of two bicyclists.  
 
Analysis 
The bicyclist who leans down and brings his body closer to his knees goes faster since the frontal area 
and thus the drag force is less in that position. The drag coefficient also goes down somewhat, but this is a secondary effect. 
 
Discussion 
This is easily experienced when riding a bicycle down a long hill. 
 
 
 
 
 
11-2C  
Solution 
We are to discuss how the local skin friction coefficient changes with position along a flat plate in laminar 
flow.  
 
Analysis 
The local friction coefficient decreases with downstream distance in laminar flow over a flat plate. 
 
Discussion 
At the front of the plate, the boundary layer is very thin, and thus the shear stress at the wall is large. As the 
boundary layer grows downstream, however, the boundary layer grows in size, decreasing the wall shear stress. 
 
 
 
 
11-3C  
Solution 
We are to define the frontal area of a body and discuss its applications.  
 
Analysis 
The frontal area of a body is the area seen by a person when looking from upstream (the area projected 
on a plane normal to the direction of flow of the body). The frontal area is appropriate to use in drag and lift calculations for 
blunt bodies such as cars, cylinders, and spheres. 
 
Discussion 
The drag force on a body is proportional to both the drag coefficient and the frontal area. Thus, one is able 
to reduce drag by reducing the drag coefficient or the frontal area (or both). 
 
 
 
 
11-4C  
Solution 
We are to define the planform area of a body and discuss its applications.  
 
Analysis 
The planform area of a body is the area that would be seen by a person looking at the body from above 
in a direction normal to flow. The planform area is the area projected on a plane parallel to the direction of flow and 
normal to the lift force. The planform area is appropriate to use in drag and lift calculations for slender bodies such as flat 
plate and airfoils when the frontal area is very small.  
 
Discussion 
Consider for example an extremely thin flat plate aligned with the flow. The frontal area is nearly zero, and 
is therefore not appropriate to use for calculation of drag or lift coefficient. 
 
 
 
 
 
11-5C  
Solution 
We are to explain when a flow is 2-D, 3-D, and axisymmetric.  
 
Analysis 
The flow over a body is said to be two-dimensional when the body is very long and of constant cross-
section, and the flow is normal to the body (such as the wind blowing over a long pipe perpendicular to its axis). There is 
no significant flow along the axis of the body.  The flow along a body that possesses symmetry along an axis in the flow 
direction is said to be axisymmetric (such as a bullet piercing through air). Flow over a body that cannot be modeled as 
two-dimensional or axisymmetric is three-dimensional. The flow over a car is three-dimensional. 
 
Discussion 
As you might expect, 3-D flows are much more difficult to analyze than 2-D or axisymmetric flows.

11-6C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the difference between upstream and free-stream velocity.  
 
Analysis 
The velocity of the fluid relative to the immersed solid body sufficiently far away from a body is called 
the free-stream velocity, V. The upstream (or approach) velocity V is the velocity of the approaching fluid far ahead of 
the body. These two velocities are equal if the flow is uniform and the body is small relative to the scale of the free-stream 
flow. 
 
Discussion 
This is a subtle difference, and the two terms are often used interchangeably. 
 
 
 
 
11-7C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the difference between streamlined and blunt bodies.  
 
Analysis 
A body is said to be streamlined if a conscious effort is made to align its shape with the anticipated 
streamlines in the flow. Otherwise, a body tends to block the flow, and is said to be blunt. A tennis ball is a blunt body 
(unless the velocity is very low and we have “creeping flow”). 
 
Discussion 
In creeping flow, the streamlines align themselves with the shape of any body – this is a much different 
regime than our normal experiences with flows in air and water. A low-drag body shape in creeping flow looks much 
different than a low-drag shape in high Reynolds number flow. 
 
 
 
 
11-8C  
Solution 
We are to discuss applications in which a large drag is desired.  
 
Analysis 
Some applications in which a large drag is desirable: parachuting, sailing, and the transport of pollens. 
 
Discussion 
When sailing efficiently, however, the lift force on the sail is more important than the drag force in 
propelling the boat. 
 
 
 
 
11-9C  
Solution 
We are to define drag and discuss why we usually try to minimize it.  
 
Analysis 
The force a flowing fluid exerts on a body in the flow direction is called drag. Drag is caused by 
friction between the fluid and the solid surface, and the pressure difference between the front and back of the body. 
We try to minimize drag in order to reduce fuel consumption in vehicles, improve safety and durability of structures 
subjected to high winds, and to reduce noise and vibration. 
 
Discussion 
In some applications, such as parachuting, high drag rather than low drag is desired. 
 
 
 
 
11-10C  
Solution 
We are to define lift, and discuss its cause and the contribution of wall shear to lift.  
 
Analysis 
The force a flowing fluid exerts on a body in the normal direction to flow that tends to move the body 
in that direction is called lift. It is caused by the components of the pressure and wall shear forces in the direction 
normal to the flow. The wall shear contributes to lift (unless the body is very slim), but its contribution is usually small. 
 
Discussion 
Typically the nonsymmetrical shape of the body is what causes the lift force to be produced.

Solution 
We are to explain how to calculate the drag coefficient, and discuss the appropriate area.

used instead of the frontal area. Planform area is the area projected on a plane parallel to the direction of flow and normal to 
the lift force.

used instead of the frontal area. Planform area is the area projected on a plane parallel to the direction of flow and normal to 
the lift force. 
 
 
 
 
 
11-13C  
Solution 
We are to define and discuss terminal velocity.  
 
Analysis 
The maximum velocity a free falling body can attain is called the terminal velocity. It is determined by 
setting the weight of the body equal to the drag and buoyancy forces, W = FD + FB. 
 
Discussion 
When discussing the settling of small dust particles, terminal velocity is also called terminal settling speed 
or settling velocity. 
 
 
 
 
 
11-14C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the difference between skin friction drag and pressure drag, and which is more significant 
for slender bodies.  
 
Analysis 
The part of drag that is due directly to wall shear stress w is called the skin friction drag FD, friction since 
it is caused by frictional effects, and the part that is due directly to pressure P and depends strongly  on the shape of 
the body is called the pressure drag FD, pressure. For slender bodies such as airfoils, the friction drag is usually more 
significant. 
 
Discussion 
For blunt bodies, on the other hand, pressure drag is usually more significant than skin friction drag.

11-15C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the effect of surface roughness on drag coefficient.  
 
Analysis 
The friction drag coefficient is independent of surface roughness in laminar flow, but is a strong function 
of surface roughness in turbulent flow due to surface roughness elements protruding farther into the viscous sublayer.  
 
Discussion 
If the roughness is very large, however, the drag on bodies is increased even for laminar flow, due to 
pressure effects on the roughness elements. 
 
 
 
 
 
11-16C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the effect of streamlining, and its effect on friction drag and pressure drag.  
 
Analysis 
As a result of streamlining, (a) friction drag increases, (b) pressure drag decreases, and (c) total drag 
decreases at high Reynolds numbers (the general case), but increases at very low Reynolds numbers (creeping flow) since 
the friction drag dominates at low Reynolds numbers. 
 
Discussion 
Streamlining can significantly reduce the overall drag on a body at high Reynolds number.

Solution 
We are to define and discuss flow separation.  
 
Analysis 
At sufficiently high velocities, the fluid stream detaches itself from the surface of the body. This is 
called separation. It is caused by a fluid flowing over a curved surface at a high velocity (or technically, by adverse 
pressure gradient). Separation increases the drag coefficient drastically. 
 
Discussion 
A boundary layer has a hard time resisting an adverse pressure gradient, and is likely to separate. A 
turbulent boundary layer is in general more resilient to flow separation than a laminar flow. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
11-18C  
Solution 
We are to define and discuss drafting.  
 
Analysis 
Drafting is when a moving body follows another moving body by staying close behind in order to 
reduce drag.  It reduces the pressure drag and thus the drag coefficient for the drafted body by taking advantage of the 
low pressure wake region of the moving body in front.  
 
Discussion 
We often see drafting in automobile and bicycle racing. 
 
 
 
 
 
11-19C  
Solution 
We are to discuss how drag coefficient varies with Reynolds number.  
 
Analysis 
(a) In general, the drag coefficient decreases with Reynolds number at low and moderate Reynolds 
numbers. (b) The drag coefficient is nearly independent of Reynolds number at high Reynolds numbers (Re > 104). 
 
Discussion 
When the drag coefficient is independent of Re at high values of Re, we call this Reynolds number 
independence.

Solution 
We are to discuss the effect of adding a fairing to a circular cylinder.  
 
Analysis 
As a result of attaching fairings to the front and back of a cylindrical body at high Reynolds numbers, (a) 
friction drag increases, (b) pressure drag decreases, and (c) total drag decreases. 
 
Discussion 
In creeping flow (very low Reynolds numbers), however, adding a fairing like this would actually increase 
the overall drag, since the surface area and therefore the skin friction drag would increase significantly.

Solution 
The drag force acting on a car is measured in a wind tunnel. The drag coefficient of the car at the test 
conditions is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow of air is steady and incompressible. 2 The cross-section of the tunnel is large enough to simulate 
free flow over the car. 3 The bottom of the tunnel is also moving at the speed of air to approximate actual driving 
conditions or this effect is negligible. 4 Air is an ideal gas. 
Properties 
The density of air at 1 atm and 25°C is  = 
1.164 kg/m3.

Discussion 
Note that the drag coefficient depends on the design conditions, and its value will be different at different 
conditions. Therefore, the published drag coefficients of different vehicles can be compared meaningfully only if they are 
determined under identical conditions. This shows the importance of developing standard testing procedures in industry.

Solution 
The total drag force acting on a spherical body is measured, and the pressure drag acting on the body is 
calculated by integrating the pressure distribution.  The friction drag coefficient is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow of air is steady and incompressible. 2 The surface of the sphere is smooth. 3 The flow over the 
sphere is turbulent (to be verified).   
Properties 
The density and kinematic viscosity of air at 1 atm and 5C are  = 1.269 kg/m3 and  = 1.38210-5 m2/s. 
The drag coefficient of sphere in turbulent flow is CD = 0.2, and its frontal area is A = D2/4 (Table 11-2).  
Analysis 
The total drag force is the sum of the friction and pressure drag forces. Therefore,

which is greater than 2105. Therefore, the flow is turbulent as assumed.

Note that knowing the flow regime is important in the solution of this problem since the total drag 
coefficient for a sphere is 0.5 in laminar flow and 0.2 in turbulent flow.

Solution 
A car is moving at a constant velocity. The upstream velocity to be used in fluid flow analysis is to be 
determined for the cases of calm air, wind blowing against the direction of motion of the car, and wind blowing in the same 
direction of motion of the car. 
Analysis 
In fluid flow analysis, the velocity used is the 
relative velocity between the fluid and the solid body. 
Therefore: 
 
(a) Calm air: V = Vcar = 110 km/h 
 
(b) Wind blowing against the direction of motion:  
V = Vcar + Vwind = 110 + 30 = 140 km/h 
 
(c) Wind blowing in the same direction of motion:  
V = Vcar  - Vwind = 110 - 30 = 80 km/h 
 
Discussion 
Note that the wind and car velocities are added when they are in opposite directions, and subtracted when 
they are in the same direction.

Solution 
The frontal area of a car is reduced by redesigning. The amount of fuel and money saved per year as a result 
are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The car is driven 12,000 miles a year at an average speed of 55 
km/h. 2 The effect of reduction of the frontal area on the drag coefficient is 
negligible.    
Properties 
The densities of air and gasoline are given to be 0.075 lbm/ft3 
and 50 lbm/ft3, respectively. The heating value of gasoline is given to be 20,000

That is, the car uses 11.10 ft3 = 83.03 gallons of gasoline at a cost of $257.4 per year to overcome the drag.   
 
The drag force and the work done to overcome it are directly proportional to the frontal area. Then the percent 
reduction in the fuel consumption due to reducing frontal area is equal to the percent reduction in the frontal area:

Solution 
An advertisement sign in the form of a rectangular block that has the same frontal area from all four sides is 
mounted on top of a taxicab. The increase in the annual fuel cost due to this sign is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow of air is steady and incompressible. 2 The car is 
driven 60,000 km a year at an average speed of 50 km/h. 3 The overall 
efficiency of the engine is 28%. 4 The effect of the sign and the taxicab on 
the drag coefficient of each other is negligible (no interference), and the 
edge effects of the sign are negligible (a crude approximation). 5 The flow 
is turbulent so that the tabulated value of the drag coefficient can be used.   
Properties 
The densities of air and gasoline are given to be 1.25 kg/m3 
and 0.72 kg/L, respectively. The heating value of gasoline is given to be 
42,000 kJ/kg. The drag coefficient for a square rod for normal flow is CD = 
2.2 (Table 11-1).

That is, the taxicab will use 509 L of gasoline at a cost of $560 per year to overcome the drag generated by the 
advertisement sign.   
 
Discussion 
Note that the advertisement sign increases the fuel cost of the taxicab significantly. The taxicab operator 
may end up losing money by installing the sign if he/she is not aware of the major increase in the fuel cost, and negotiate 
accordingly.

Solution 
A person who normally drives at 55 mph now starts driving at 75 mph. The percentage increase in fuel 
consumption of the car is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The fuel consumption is approximately proportional to the drag force on a level road (as stated).  2 The 
drag coefficient remains the same.  
Analysis 
The drag force is proportional to the square of the velocity, and power is force times velocity. Therefore,

Therefore, the power to overcome the drag force and thus fuel consumption per unit time more than doubles as a result of 
increasing the velocity from 55 to 75 mph.  
Discussion 
This increase appears to be large. This is because all the engine power is assumed to be used entirely to 
overcome drag. Still, the simple analysis above shows the strong dependence of the fuel consumption on the cruising speed 
of a vehicle. A better measure of fuel consumption is the amount of fuel used per unit distance (rather than per unit time). A 
car cruising at 55 mph will travel a distance of 55 miles in 1 hour. But a car cruising at 75 mph will travel the same distance 
at 55/75 = 0.733 h or 73.3% of the time. Therefore, for a given distance, the increase in fuel consumption is 2.540.733 = 
1.86 – an increase of 86%. This is large, especially with the high cost of gasoline these days.

Solution 
A submarine is treated as an ellipsoid at a specified length and diameter. The powers required for this 
submarine to cruise horizontally in seawater and to tow it in air are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The submarine can be treated as an ellipsoid. 2 The flow is turbulent. 3 The drag of the towing rope is 
negligible. 4 The motion of submarine is steady and horizontal.  
Properties 
The drag coefficient for an ellipsoid with L/D 
= 25/5 = 5 is CD = 0.1 in turbulent flow (Table 11-2). The 
density of sea water is given to be 1025 kg/m3. The density of 
air is given to be 1.30 kg/m3.  
Analysis 
Noting that 1 m/s = 3.6 km/h, the velocity of the submarine is equivalent to V = 40/3.6 = 11.11 m/s. The 
frontal area of an ellipsoid is A = D2/4. Then the drag force acting on the submarine becomes

Therefore, the power required for this submarine to cruise horizontally in seawater is 1380 kW and the power required to 
tow this submarine in air at the same velocity is 1.75 kW.  
Discussion 
Note that the power required to move the submarine in water is about 800 times the power required to move 
it in air. This is due to the higher density of water compared to air (sea water is about 800 times denser than air).

Solution 
A billboard is subjected to high winds. The drag force acting on the billboard is to be determined. 
 
Assumptions 1 The flow of air is steady and incompressible. 2 The drag force on the supporting poles are negligible.  3 
The flow is turbulent so that the tabulated value of the drag coefficient can be used. 4 The 3-D effects are negligible, and 
thus the billboard is approximated as a very long flat plate (two-dimensioal). 
Properties 
If the plate were two dimensional, the drag coefficient would be CD = 1.9 (Table 11-1). However, for this 
3-D case, Table 11-2 yields CD = 1.10 + 0.02(20/8 +8/20) = 1.158, which is a better approximation of the drag coefficient. 
We calculate the gas constant for air (Table A-1E) as

Discussion 
Note that the drag force is equivalent to the weight of 2170 lbm of mass. Therefore, the support bars must 
be strong enough to withstand the weight of 2170 lbm hanging on one of their ends when they are held from the other end 
horizontally (which causes a fairly large moment or torque on the support bars).

Solution 
A semi truck is exposed to winds from its side surface. The wind velocity that will tip the truck over to its 
side is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow of air in the wind is steady and incompressible. 2 The edge effects on the semi truck are 
negligible (a crude approximation), and the resultant drag force acts through the center of the side surface. 3 The flow is 
turbulent so that the tabulated value of the drag coefficient can be used.  4 The distance between the wheels on the same 
axle is also 2 m. 5 The semi truck is loaded uniformly so that its weight acts through its center.   
Properties 
The density of air is given to be  = 1.10 kg/m3. The drag coefficient for a body of rectangular cross-section 
corresponding to L/D = 2/2 = 1 is CD = 2.2 when the wind is normal to the side surface (Table 11-2).   
Analysis 
When the truck is first tipped, the wheels on the wind-loaded side of the truck will be off the ground, and 
thus all the reaction forces from the ground will act on wheels on the other side. Taking the moment about an axis passing 
through these wheels and setting it equal to zero gives the required drag force to be

Solution 
A bicyclist is riding his bicycle downhill on a road with a specified slope without pedaling or breaking. The 
terminal velocity of the bicyclist is to be determined for the upright and racing positions. 
Assumptions 1 The rolling resistance and bearing friction are negligible. 2 The drag coefficient remains constant. 3 The 
buoyancy of air is negligible.  
Properties 
The density of air is given to be  = 1.25 kg/m3. The frontal area and the drag coefficient are given to be 
0.45 m2 and 1.1 in the upright position, and 0.4 m2 and 0.9 on the racing position.   
Analysis 
The terminal velocity of a free falling object is reached when the drag force equals the component of the 
total weight (bicyclist + bicycle) in the flow direction,

Solution 
The pivot of a wind turbine with two hollow hemispherical cups is stuck as a result of some malfunction. 
For a given wind speed, the maximum torque applied on the pivot is to be determined.  
Assumptions 1 The flow of air in the wind is steady and incompressible. 2 The air 
flow is turbulent so that the tabulated values of the drag coefficients can be used.   
Properties 
The density of air is given to be  = 1.25 kg/m3. The drag coefficient 
for a hemispherical cup is 0.4 and 1.2 when the hemispherical and plain surfaces are 
exposed to wind flow, respectively.   
Analysis 
The maximum torque occurs when the cups are normal to the wind since the length of the moment arm is 
maximum in this case. Noting that the frontal area is D2/4 for both cups, the drag force acting on each cup is determined to 
be

Solution 
A spherical tank completely submerged in fresh water is being towed by a ship at a specified velocity. The 
required towing power is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is turbulent so that the tabulated value of the drag coefficient can 
be used.  2 The drag of the towing bar is negligible.  
Properties 
The drag coefficient for a sphere is CD = 0.2 in turbulent flow (it is 0.5 for 
laminar flow). We take the density of water to be 62.4 lbm/ft3.  
Analysis 
The frontal area of a sphere is A = D2/4. Then the drag force acting on 
the spherical tank is

Therefore, the additional power needed to tow the tank is 12.0 hp.  
 
Discussion 
Note that the towing power is proportional the cube of the velocity. Therefore, the towing power can be 
reduced to one-eight (which is 1.5 hp) by reducing the towing velocity by half to 6 ft/s. But the towing time will double this 
time for a given distance.

The power delivered to the wheels of a car is used to overcome aerodynamic drag and rolling resistance. 
For a given power, the speed at which the rolling resistance is equal to the aerodynamic drag and the maximum speed of the 
car are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The air flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The bearing friction is negligible. 3 The drag and rolling 
resistance coefficients of the car are constant. 4 The car moves horizontally on a level road.  
Properties 
The density of air is given to be  = 1.20 kg/m3. The drag and rolling resistance coefficients are given to be

whose solution is V = 55.56 m/s = 200 km/h.   
 
Discussion 
A net power input of 80 kW is needed to overcome rolling resistance and aerodynamic drag at a velocity of 
200 km/h. About 75% of this power is used to overcome drag and the remaining 25% to overcome the rolling resistance. At 
much higher velocities, the fraction of drag becomes even higher as it is proportional to the cube of car velocity.

Solution 
The previous problem is reconsidered. The effect of car speed on the required power to overcome (a) rolling 
resistance, (b) the aerodynamic drag, and (c) their combined effect as the car speed varies from 0 to 150 km/h in increments 
of 15 km/h is to be investigated.

Discussion 
Notice that the rolling power curve and drag power curve intersect at about 118 km/h (73.3 mph). So, near 
highway speeds, the overall power is split nearly 50% between rolling drag and aerodynamic drag.

Solution 
We are to estimate how many additional liters of fuel are wasted per year by driving with a ball on a car

Discussion 
If fuel costs around $1 per liter, the total cost is around 64 cents per year to drive with the ball compared to 
without the ball – Suzy should not worry about wasting this negligible amount of money if the sun ball on her antenna gives 
her some pleasure when she drives. We give the answer to two significant digits – more than that is unwarranted.

Solution 
A garbage can is found in the morning tipped over due to high winds the night before. The wind velocity 
during the night when the can was tipped over is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow of air in the wind is steady and incompressible. 2 The ground effect on the wind and the drag 
coefficient is negligible (a crude approximation) so that the resultant drag force acts through the center of the side surface. 3 
The garbage can is loaded uniformly so that its weight acts through its center.   
Properties 
The density of air is given to be  = 1.25 kg/m3, and the average 
density of the garbage inside the can is given to be 150 kg/m3. The drag 
coefficient of the garbage can is given to be 0.7.

When the garbage can is first tipped, the edge on the wind-loaded side of the can will be off the ground, and thus all the 
reaction forces from the ground will act on the other side. Taking the moment about an axis passing through the contact 
point and setting it equal to zero gives the required drag force to be

Discussion 
The analysis above shows that under the stated assumptions, the wind velocity at some moment exceeded 
159 km/h. But we cannot tell how high the wind velocity has been. Such analysis and predictions are commonly used in

Solution 
A plastic sphere is dropped into water. The terminal velocity of the sphere in water is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The fluid flow over the sphere is laminar (to be verified). 2 The drag coefficient remains constant.  
Properties 
The density of plastic sphere is 1150 kg/m3.  The density and dynamic viscosity of water at 20C are  = 
998 kg/m3 and  = 1.00210-3 kg/ms, respectively. The drag coefficient for a sphere in laminar flow is CD = 0.5. 
Analysis 
The terminal velocity of a free falling object is reached when the drag force equals the weight of the solid 
object less the buoyancy force applied by the fluid,

which is less than 2105. Therefore, the flow is laminar as assumed. 
 
Discussion 
This problem can also be solved “usually more accurately” using a trial-and-error approach by using CD 
data from Fig. 11-34. The CD value corresponding to Re = 926 is about 0.5, and thus the terminal velocity is the same.

Solution 
A spherical hot air balloon that stands still in the air is subjected to winds. The initial acceleration of the 
balloon is to be determined.   
Assumptions 1 The entire hot air balloon can be approximated as a sphere. 2 The wind is steady and turbulent, and blows 
parallel to the ground.   
Properties 
The drag coefficient for turbulent flow over a sphere is CD = 0.2 (Table 11-2). We take the density of air to 
be 1.20 kg/m3.  
Analysis 
The frontal area of a sphere is A = D2/4. Noting that 1 m/s = 3.6 km/h, the drag force acting on the balloon

Solution 
The drag coefficient of a sports car increases when the sunroof is open, and it requires more power to 
overcome aerodynamic drag. The additional power consumption of the car when the sunroof is opened is to be determined 
at two different velocities. 
Assumptions 1 The car moves steadily at a constant velocity on a straight path. 2 The effect of velocity on the drag 
coefficient is negligible. 
Properties 
The density of air is given to be 0.075 lbm/ft3.  The drag 
coefficient of the car is given to be CD = 0.32 when the sunroof is closed, and 
CD = 0.41 when it is open. 
Analysis 
(a) Noting that 1 mph = 1.4667 ft/s and that power is force 
times velocity, the drag force acting on the car and the power needed to 
overcome it at 35 mph are:

Discussion 
Note that the additional drag caused by open sunroof is 0.35 kW at 35 mph, and 2.78 kW at 70 mph, which 
is an increase of 8 folds when the velocity is doubled. This is expected since the power consumption to overcome drag is 
proportional to the cube of velocity.

Solution 
The flat mirror of a car is replaced by one with hemispherical back. The amount of fuel and money saved 
per year as a result are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The car is driven 24,000 km a year at an average speed of 95 km/h. 2 The effect of the car body on the 
flow around the mirror is negligible (no interference).  
Properties 
The densities of air and gasoline are taken to be 1.20 kg/m3 and 750 kg/m3, respectively. The heating value 
of gasoline is given to be 44,000 kJ/kg. The drag coefficients CD are 1.1 for a circular disk, and 0.40 for a hemispherical 
body.

That is, the car uses 14.79 L of gasoline at a cost of $13.31 per year to overcome the drag generated by a flat mirror 
extending out from the side of a car.  
 
The drag force and the work done to overcome it are directly proportional to the drag coefficient. Then the percent 
reduction in the fuel consumption due to replacing the mirror is equal to the percent reduction in the drag coefficient:

Since a typical car has two rearview mirrors, the driver saves about $17 per year in gasoline by replacing the flat mirrors by 
the hemispherical ones.   
Discussion 
Note from this example that significant reductions in drag and fuel consumption can be achieved by 
streamlining the shape of various components and the entire car. So it is no surprise that the sharp corners are replaced in 
late model cars by rounded contours. This also explains why large airplanes retract their wheels after takeoff, and small 
airplanes use contoured fairings around their wheels

Flow over Flat Plates 
 
 
 
 
11-46C  
Solution 
We are to define and discuss the average skin friction coefficient over a flat plate.  
 
Analysis 
The average friction coefficient in flow over a flat plate is determined by integrating the local friction 
coefficient over the entire length of the plate, and then dividing it by the length of the plate. Or, it can be determined 
experimentally by measuring the drag force, and dividing it by the dynamic pressure. 
 
Discussion 
For the case of a flat plate aligned with the flow, there is no pressure drag, only skin friction drag. Thus, the 
average friction coefficient is the same as the drag coefficient. This is not true for other body shapes. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
11-47C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the fluid property responsible for the development of a boundary layer.  
 
Analysis 
The fluid viscosity is responsible for the development of the velocity boundary layer. Velocity forces the 
boundary layer closer to the wall. Therefore, the higher the velocity (and thus Reynolds number), the lower the thickness of 
the boundary layer. 
 
Discussion 
All fluids have viscosity – a measure of frictional forces in a fluid. There is no such thing as an inviscid 
fluid, although there are regions, called inviscid flow regions, in which viscous effects are negligible. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
11-48C  
Solution 
We are to define and discuss the friction coefficient for flow over a flat plate.  
 
Analysis 
The friction coefficient represents the resistance to fluid flow over a flat plate. It is proportional to the 
drag force acting on the plate. The drag coefficient for a flat surface is equivalent to the mean friction coefficient. 
 
Discussion 
In flow over a flat plate aligned with the flow, there is no pressure (form) drag – only friction drag.

Solution 
Air flows over a plane surface at high elevation. The drag force acting on the top surface of the plate is to be 
determined for flow along the two sides of the plate. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The critical Reynolds number is Recr = 5105.  3 Air is an ideal 
gas. 4 The surface of the plate is smooth. 
Properties 
The dynamic viscosity is independent of pressure, and for air at 25C it is  = 1.84910-5 kg/ms. The air

Discussion 
Note that the drag force is proportional to density, which is proportional to the pressure. Therefore, the 
altitude has a major influence on the drag force acting on a surface.  Commercial airplanes take advantage of this 
phenomenon and cruise at high altitudes where the air density is much lower to save fuel.

Discussion 
Note that we can solve this problem using the turbulent flow relation (instead of the combined laminar-
turbulent flow relation) without much loss in accuracy since the Reynolds number is much greater than the critical value. 
Also, the actual drag force will probably be greater because of the surface roughness effects.

Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The critical Reynolds number is Recr = 5105.  3 Air is an ideal

turbulence in air flow.

The total drag force acting on the entire plate can be determined by multiplying the value obtained above by the width of 
the plate.  
Discussion 
The force per unit width corresponds to the weight of a mass of 6.92 lbm. Therefore, a person who applies 
an equal and opposite force to the plate to keep it from moving will feel like he or she is using as much force as is necessary 
to hold a 6.92 lbm mass from dropping.

Discussion 
Note that the calculated drag force (and the power required to overcome it) is very small. This is not 
surprising since the drag force for blunt bodies is almost entirely due to pressure drag, and the friction drag is practically 
negligible compared to the pressure drag.

Solution 
The previous problem is reconsidered. The effect of truck speed on the total drag force acting on the top and 
side surfaces, and the power required to overcome as the truck speed varies from 0 to 100 mph in increments of 10 mph is 
to be investigated.

Therefore, the flow becomes turbulent after about 5.6 cm from the leading edge of the plate, and the thickness of the 
boundary layer at that location is 0.39 mm.

thickness can be determined from the boundary layer thickness relation for turbulent flow.

Solution 
Wind is blowing parallel to the side wall of a house. The drag force acting on the wall is to be determined 
for two different wind velocities. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The critical Reynolds number is Recr = 5105.  3 Air is an ideal 
gas. 4 The wall surface is smooth (the actual wall surface is usually very rough). 5 The wind blows parallel to the wall. 
Properties 
The density and kinematic viscosity of air at 1 atm and 5C are  = 1.269 kg/m3 and  = 1.382×10–5 m2/s .

Treating flow over the side wall of a house as flow over a flat plate is not quite realistic. When flow hits a bluff body like a 
house, it separates at the sharp corner and a separation bubble exists over most of the side panels of the house. Therefore, 
flat plat boundary layer equations are not appropriate for this problem, and the entire house should considered in the 
solution instead.  
Discussion 
Note that the actual drag will probably be much higher since the wall surfaces are typically very rough. 
Also, we can solve this problem using the turbulent flow relation (instead of the combined laminar-turbulent flow relation) 
without much loss in accuracy. Finally, the drag force nearly quadruples when the velocity is doubled. This is expected 
since the drag force is proportional to the square of the velocity, and the effect of velocity on the friction coefficient is 
small.

Solution 
The weight of a thin flat plate exposed to air flow on both sides is balanced by a counterweight. The mass of 
the counterweight that needs to be added in order to balance the plate is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The critical Reynolds number is Recr = 5105.  3 Air is an ideal 
gas. 4 The surfaces of the plate are smooth.

Flow across Cylinders and Spheres 
 
 
 
 
11-61C  
Solution 
We are to discuss why flow separation is delayed in turbulent flow over circular cylinders.  
 
Analysis 
Flow separation in flow over a cylinder is delayed in turbulent flow because of the extra mixing due to 
random fluctuations and the transverse motion. 
 
Discussion 
As a result of the turbulent mixing, a turbulent boundary layer can resist flow separation better than a 
laminar boundary layer can, under otherwise similar conditions. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
11-62C  
Solution 
We are to discuss how pressure drag and friction drag differ in flow over blunt bodies.  
 
Analysis 
Friction drag is due to the shear stress at the surface whereas pressure drag is due to the pressure 
differential between the front and back sides of the body because of the wake that is formed in the rear. 
 
Discussion 
For a blunt or bluff body, pressure drag is usually greater than friction drag, while for a well-streamlined 
body, the opposite is true. For the case of a flat plate aligned with the flow, all of the drag is friction drag. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
11-63C  
Solution 
We are to discuss why the drag coefficient suddenly drops when the flow becomes turbulent.  
 
Analysis 
Turbulence moves the fluid separation point further back on the rear of the body, reducing the size of 
the wake, and thus the magnitude of the pressure drag (which is the dominant mode of drag). As a result, the drag 
coefficient suddenly drops. In general, turbulence increases the drag coefficient for flat surfaces, but the drag coefficient 
usually remains constant at high Reynolds numbers when the flow is turbulent. 
 
Discussion 
The sudden drop in drag is sometimes referred to as the drag crisis.

Solution 
A spherical dust particle is suspended in the air at a fixed point as a result of an updraft air motion. The 
magnitude of the updraft velocity is to be determined using Stokes law. 
Assumptions 1 The Reynolds number is low (at the order of 1) so that Stokes law is applicable (to be verified). 2 The 
updraft is steady and incompressible. 3 The buoyancy force applied by air to the dust particle is negligible since air << dust 
(besides, the uncertainty in the density of dust is greater than the density of air). (We will solve the problem without 
utilizing this assumption for generality). 
Properties 
The density of dust is given to be s = 2.1 g/cm3 = 2100 kg/m3.  The density and dynamic viscosity of air at 
1 atm and 25C are f = 1.184 kg/m3 and  = 1.84910-5 kg/ms. 
Analysis 
The terminal velocity of a free falling object is reached (or the suspension of an object in a flow stream is 
established) when the drag force equals the weight of the solid object less the buoyancy force applied by the surrounding 
fluid,

which is in the order of 1. Therefore, the creeping flow idealization and thus Stokes law is applicable, and the value

Discussion 
Flow separation starts at about Re = 10. Therefore, Stokes law can be used as an approximation for 
Reynolds numbers up to this value, but this should be done with care.

Solution 
A pipe is exposed to high winds. The drag force exerted on the pipe by the winds is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The outer surface of the pipe is smooth so that Fig. 11-34 can be used to determine the drag coefficient. 2 
Air flow in the wind is steady and incompressible. 3 The turbulence in the wind is not considered. 4The direction of wind is 
normal to the pipe. 
Properties 
The density and kinematic viscosity of air at 1 atm and 
10C are  = 1.246 kg/m3 and  = 1.42610-5 m2/s.

Note that the drag force acting on a unit length of the pipe is equivalent to the weight of 0.6 kg mass. The 
total drag force acting on the entire pipe can be obtained by multiplying the value obtained by the pipe length. It should be 
kept in mind that wind turbulence may reduce the drag coefficients by inducing turbulence and delaying flow separation.

Solution 
Spherical hail is falling freely in the atmosphere. The terminal velocity of the hail in air is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The surface of the hail is smooth so that Fig. 11-34 can be used to determine the drag coefficient. 2 The 
variation of the air properties with altitude is negligible. 3 The buoyancy force applied by air to hail is negligible since air 
<< hail (besides, the uncertainty in the density of hail is greater than the density of air). 4 Air flow over the hail is steady 
and incompressible when terminal velocity is established. 5 The atmosphere is calm (no winds or drafts).   
Properties 
The density and kinematic viscosity of air at 1 atm and 5C are  = 1.269 kg/m3 and  = 1.38210-5 m2/s. 
The density of hail is given to be 910 kg/m3.

The terminal velocity of a free falling object is reached when the drag force equals the weight of the solid

The drag coefficient CD is to be determined from Fig. 11-34, but it requires the 
Reynolds number which cannot be calculated since we do not know velocity. 
Therefore, the solution requires a trial-error approach. First we express the Reynolds

Now we choose a velocity in m/s, calculate the Re from Eq. 2, read the corresponding CD from Fig. 11-34, and calculate V 
from Eq. 1. Repeat calculations until the assumed velocity matches the calculated velocity. With this approach the terminal 
velocity is determined to be 
 
V = 13.7 m/s 
The corresponding Re and CD values are Re = 7930 and CD = 0.40.  Therefore, the velocity of hail will remain constant 
when it reaches the terminal velocity of 13.7 m/s = 49 km/h. 
Discussion 
The simple analysis above gives us a reasonable value for the terminal velocity. A more accurate answer 
can be obtained by a more detailed (and complex) analysis by considering the variation of air properties with altitude, and 
by considering the uncertainty in the drag coefficient (a hail is not necessarily spherical and smooth).

Solution 
A pipe is crossing a river while remaining completely immersed in water. The drag force exerted on the 
pipe by the river is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The outer surface of the pipe is smooth so that Fig. 11-34 
can be used to determine the drag coefficient. 2 Water flow in the river is 
steady. 3 The turbulence in water flow in the river is not considered. 4 The 
direction of water flow is normal to the pipe. 
Properties 
The density and dynamic viscosity of water at 70F are  = 
62.30 lbm/ft3 and  = 2.36 lbm/fth = 6.55610-4 lbm/fts.

Discussion 
Note that this force is equivalent to the weight of a 1490 lbm mass. Therefore, the drag force the river exerts 
on the pipe is equivalent to hanging a mass of 1490 lbm on the pipe supported at its ends 70 ft apart. The necessary 
precautions should be taken if the pipe cannot support this force. Also, the fluctuations in water flow may reduce the drag 
coefficients by inducing turbulence and delaying flow separation.

Solution 
Dust particles that are unsettled during high winds rise to a specified height, and start falling back when 
things calm down. The time it takes for the dust particles to fall back to the ground and their velocity are to be determined 
using Stokes law. 
Assumptions 1 The Reynolds number is low (at the order of 1) so that Stokes law is applicable (to be verified). 2 The 
atmosphere is calm during fall back (no winds or drafts). 3 The initial transient period during which the dust particle 
accelerates to its terminal velocity is negligible. 4 The buoyancy force applied by air to the dust particle is negligible since 
air << dust (besides, the uncertainty in the density of dust is greater than the density of air). (We will solve this problem 
without utilizing this assumption for generality).  
Properties 
The density of dust is given to be s = 1.6 g/cm3 = 1600 kg/m3.  The density and dynamic viscosity of air at 
1 atm and 30C are f = 1.164 kg/m3 and  = 1.87210-5 kg/ms. 
Analysis 
The terminal velocity of a free falling object is reached when the drag force equals the weight of the solid 
object less the buoyancy force applied by the surrounding fluid,

Note that the dust particle reaches a terminal velocity of 0.168 m/s, and it takes about 20 min to fall back to 
the ground. The presence of drafts in air may significantly increase the settling time.

Solution 
A cylindrical log suspended by a crane is subjected to normal winds. The angular displacement of the log 
and the tension on the cable are to be determined. 
 
Assumptions 1 The surfaces of the log are smooth so that Fig. 11-34 can be used to determine the drag coefficient (not a 
realistic assumption). 2 Air flow in the wind is steady and incompressible. 3 The turbulence in the wind is not considered. 
4The direction of wind is normal to the log, which always remains horizontal. 5 The end effects of the log are negligible. 6 
The weight of the cable and the drag acting on it are negligible. 7 Air is an ideal gas.  
Properties 
The dynamic viscosity of air at 5C (independent of pressure) is  = 1.75410-5 kg/ms. Then the density

Drawing a free body diagram of the log and doing a force balance will show that the magnitude of the tension on the cable 
must be equal to the resultant force acting on the log. Therefore, the tension on the cable is 318 N and the cable makes 84 
with the horizontal. 
Discussion 
Note that the wind in this case has rotated the cable by 6 from its vertical position, and increased the 
tension action on it somewhat. At very high wind speeds, the increase in the cable tension can be very significant, and wind 
loading must always be considered in bodies exposed to high winds.

flow in the wind is steady and incompressible. 3 The turbulence in the wind is not considered. 4The direction of wind is

The drag coefficient CD is to be determined from Fig. 11-34, but it requires the Reynolds number which cannot be

Now we choose a velocity in m/s, calculate the Re from Eq. 2, read the corresponding CD from Fig. 11-34, and calculate V 
from Eq. 1. Repeat calculations until the assumed velocity matches the calculated velocity. With this approach the velocity 
of the fluid jet is determined to be 
 
V = 9.2 m/s 
The corresponding Re and CD values are Re = 24,700 and CD = 0.43. Therefore, the ping-pong ball will remain suspended 
in the air jet when the air velocity reaches 9.2 m/s = 33.1 km/h. 
Discussion 
 
1 If the ball is pushed to the side by a finger, the ball will come back to the center of the jet (instead of falling off) due to 
the Bernoulli effect. In the core of the jet the velocity is higher, and thus the pressure is lower relative to a location away 
from the jet.  
 
2 Note that this simple apparatus can be used to determine the drag coefficients of certain object by simply measuring the 
air velocity, which is easy to do. 
 
3 This problem can also be solved roughly by taking CD = 0.5 from Table 11-2 for a sphere in laminar flow, and then 
verifying that the flow is laminar.

Lift 
 
 
 
 
11-73C  
Solution 
We are to discuss why the contribution of viscous effects to lift of airfoils is usually negligible.  
 
Analysis 
The contribution of viscous effects to lift is usually negligible for airfoils since the wall shear is nearly 
parallel to the surfaces of such devices and thus nearly normal to the direction of lift. 
 
Discussion 
However, viscous effects are extremely important for airfoils at high angles of attack, since the viscous 
effects near the wall (in the boundary layer) cause the flow to separate and the airfoil to stall, losing significant lift. 
 
 
 
 
 
11-74C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the lift and drag on a symmetrical airfoil at 5o angle of attack. 
 
Analysis 
When air flows past a symmetrical airfoil at an angle of attack of 5, both the (a) lift and (b) drag acting 
on the airfoil are nonzero. 
 
Discussion 
Because of the lack of symmetry with respect to the free-stream flow, the flow is different on the top and 
bottom surfaces of the airfoil, leading to lift. There is drag too, just as there is drag even at zero angle of attack.

We are to define and discuss stall.

The decrease of lift with an increase in the angle of attack is called stall. When the flow separates over 
nearly the entire upper half of the airfoil, the lift is reduced dramatically (the separation point is near the leading edge). Stall 
is caused by flow separation and the formation of a wide wake region over the top surface of the airfoil. Commercial 
aircraft are not allowed to fly at velocities near the stall velocity for safety reasons. Airfoils stall at high angles of attack 
(flow cannot negotiate the curve around the leading edge). If a plane stalls, it loses mush of its lift, and it can crash. 
 
Discussion 
At angles of attack above the stall angle, the drag also increases significantly.

Solution 
We are to discuss the lift and drag on a nonsymmetrical airfoil at zero angle of attack.  
 
Analysis 
When air flows past a nonsymmetrical airfoil at zero angle of attack, both the (a) lift and (b) drag acting 
on the airfoil are nonzero. 
 
Discussion 
Because of the lack of symmetry, the flow is different on the top and bottom surfaces of the airfoil, leading 
to lift. There is drag too, just as there is drag even on a symmetrical airfoil.

Solution 
We are to discuss the lift and drag on a symmetrical airfoil at zero angle of attack.  
 
Analysis 
When air flows past a symmetrical airfoil at zero angle of attack, (a) the lift is zero, but (b) the drag acting 
on the airfoil is nonzero. 
 
Discussion 
In this case, because of symmetry, there is no lift, but there is still skin friction drag, along with a small 
amount of pressure drag. 
 
 
 
 
 
11-78C  
Solution 
We are to discuss which increases at a greater rate – lift or drag – with increasing angle of attack.  
 
Analysis 
Both the lift and the drag of an airfoil increase with an increase in the angle of attack, but in general, the lift 
increases at a much higher rate than does the drag. 
 
Discussion 
In other words, the lift-to-drag ratio increases with increasing angle of attack – at least up to the stall angle. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
11-79C  
Solution 
We are to why flaps are used on aircraft during takeoff and landing.  
 
Analysis 
Flaps are used at the leading and trailing edges of the wings of large aircraft during takeoff and landing to 
alter the shape of the wings to maximize lift and to enable the aircraft to land or takeoff at low speeds. An aircraft can 
take off or land without flaps, but it can do so at very high velocities, which is undesirable during takeoff and landing. 
 
Discussion 
In simple terms, the planform area of the wing increases as the flaps are deployed. Thus, even if the lift 
coefficient were to remain constant, the actual lift would still increase. In fact, however, flaps increase the lift coefficient as 
well, leading to even further increases in lift. Lower takeoff and landing speeds lead to shorter runway length requirements. 
 
 
 
 
 
11-80C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the lift on a spinning and non-spinning ball.  
 
Analysis 
When air is flowing past a spherical ball, the lift exerted on the ball is zero if the ball is not spinning, and 
it is nonzero if the ball is spinning about an axis normal to the free stream velocity (no lift is generated if the ball is 
spinning about an axis parallel to the free stream velocity).  
 
Discussion 
In the parallel spinning case, however, a side force would be generated (e.g., a curve ball). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
11-81C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the effect of wing tip vortices on drag and lift.  
 
Analysis 
The effect of wing tip vortices is to increase drag (induced drag) and to decrease lift. This effect is also 
due to the downwash, which causes an effectively smaller angle of attack. 
 
Discussion 
Induced drag is a three-dimensional effect; there is no induced drag on a 2-D airfoil since there are no tips.

11-82C  
Solution 
We are to discuss induced drag and how to minimize it.  
 
Analysis 
Induced drag is the additional drag caused by the tip vortices. The tip vortices have a lot of kinetic 
energy, all of which is wasted and is ultimately dissipated as heat in the air downstream. Induced drag can be reduced by 
using long and narrow wings, and by modifying the geometry of the wing tips. 
 
Discussion 
Birds are designed with feathers that fan out at the tips of their wings in order to reduce induced drag. 
 
 
 
 
 
11-83C 
Solution 
We are to explain why some airplane wings have endplates or winglets.  
 
Analysis 
Endplates or winglets are added at the tips of airplane wings to reduce induced drag. In short, the winglets 
disrupt flow from the high pressure lower part of the wing to the low pressure upper part of the wing, thereby reducing the 
strength of the tip vortices. 
 
Discussion 
Comparing a wing with and without winglets, the one with winglets can produce the same lift with less 
drag, thereby saving fuel or increasing range. Winglets are especially useful in glider planes because high lift with small 
drag is critical to their operation (and safety!). 
 
 
 
 
 
11-84C  
Solution 
We are to discuss how flaps affect the lift and drag of airplane wings.  
 
Analysis 
Flaps increase both the lift and the drag of the wings. But the increase in drag during takeoff and landing 
is not much of a concern because of the relatively short time periods involved. This is the penalty we pay willingly to take 
off and land at safe speeds. 
 
Discussion 
Note, however, that the engine must operate at nearly full power during takeoff to overcome the large drag.

Solution 
The wing area, lift coefficient at takeoff settings, the cruising drag coefficient, and total mass of a small

wings are not considered.

Therefore, the engines must supply 434 kW of propulsive power to overcome the drag during cruising. 
 
Discussion 
The power determined above is the power to overcome the drag that acts on the wings only, and does not 
include the drag that acts on the remaining parts of the aircraft (the fuselage, the tail, etc). Therefore, the total power 
required during cruising will be greater. The required rate of energy input can be determined by dividing the propulsive 
power by the propulsive efficiency.

Solution 
The takeoff speed and takeoff time of an aircraft at sea level are given. The required takeoff speed, takeoff 
time, and the additional runway length required at a higher elevation are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 Standard atmospheric conditions exist. 2 The settings of the plane during takeoff are maintained the same 
so that the lift coefficient of the plane and the planform area remain constant. 3 The acceleration of the aircraft during 
takeoff remains constant.

Solution 
The rate of fuel consumption of an aircraft while flying at a low altitude is given. The rate of fuel 
consumption at a higher altitude is to be determined for the same flight velocity. 
Assumptions 1 Standard atmospheric conditions exist. 2 The settings of the plane during takeoff are maintained the same 
so that the drag coefficient of the plane and the planform area remain constant. 3 The velocity of the aircraft and the 
propulsive efficiency remain constant. 4 The fuel is used primarily to provide propulsive power to overcome drag, and thus 
the energy consumed by auxiliary equipment (lights, etc) is negligible. 
Properties 
The density of standard air is 1 = 0.05648 lbm/ft3 at 10,000 ft, and 2 = 0.02866 lbm/ft3 at 30,000 ft 
altitude. 
Analysis 
When an aircraft cruises steadily (zero acceleration) at a constant altitude, the net force acting on the aircraft 
is zero, and thus the thrust provided by the engines must be equal to the drag force. Also, power is force times velocity 
(distance per unit time), and thus the propulsive power required to overcome drag is equal to the thrust times the cruising 
velocity. Therefore,

Discussion 
Note the fuel consumption drops by half when the aircraft flies at 30,000 ft instead of 10,000 ft altitude. 
Therefore, large passenger planes routinely fly at high altitudes (usually between 30,000 and 40,000 ft) to save fuel. This is 
especially the case for long flights.

Solution 
A tennis ball is hit with a backspin. It is to be determined if the ball will fall or rise after being hit. 
Assumptions 1 The outer surface of the ball is smooth enough for Fig. 11-53 to be applicable. 2 The ball is hit 
horizontally so that it starts its motion horizontally.    
Properties 
The density and kinematic viscosity of air at 1 atm and 25C are  = 
1.184 kg/m3 and  = 1.56210-5 m2/s. 
Analysis 
The ball is hit horizontally, and thus it would normally fall under the 
effect of gravity without the spin. The backspin will generate a lift, and the ball will 
rise if the lift is greater than the weight of the ball. The lift can be determined from

Solution 
An airfoil has a given lift-to drag ratio at 0° angle of attack. The angle of attack that will raise this ratio to 
80 is to be determined. 
Analysis 
The ratio CL/CD for the given airfoil is plotted against the angle of attack in Fig. 11-43. The angle of attack 
corresponding to CL/CD = 80 is  = 3.  
Discussion 
Note that different airfoils have different CL/CD vs.   charts.

Solution 
The wings of a light plane resemble the NACA 23012 airfoil with no flaps. Using data for that airfoil, the 
takeoff speed at a specified angle of attack and the stall speed are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 Standard atmospheric conditions exist. 2 The drag and lift produced by parts of the plane other than the 
wings are not considered.  
Properties 
The density of standard air at sea level is  = 1.225 kg/m3. At an 
angle of attack of 5°, the lift and drag coefficients are read from Fig. 11-45 to be 
CL = 0.6 and  CD  = 0.015 [Note: Student values may differ significantly because 
these values are very hard to read from the plots].  The maximum lift coefficient is 
CL,max = 1.52 and it occurs at an angle of attack of 15°.

Solution 
The total mass, wing area, cruising speed, and propulsive power of a small aircraft are given. The lift and 
drag coefficients of this airplane while cruising are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 Standard atmospheric conditions exist. 2 The drag and lift produced 
by parts of the plane other than the wings are not considered. 3 The fuel is used 
primarily to provide propulsive power to overcome drag, and thus the energy 
consumed by auxiliary equipment (lights, etc) is negligible. 
Properties 
The density of standard air at an altitude of 4000 m is  = 0.819 kg/m3. 
Analysis 
Noting that power is force times velocity, the propulsive power 
required to overcome this drag is equal to the thrust times the cruising velocity. Also, 
when the aircraft is cruising steadily at a constant altitude, the net force acting on the 
aircraft is zero, and thus thrust provided by the engines must be equal to the drag force.

Therefore, the drag and lift coefficients of this aircraft during cruising are 0.0235 and 0.17, respectively, with a CL/CD ratio 
of 7.2.  
 
Discussion 
The drag and lift coefficient determined are for cruising conditions. The values of these coefficient can be 
very different during takeoff because of the angle of attack and the wing geometry.

Solution 
The mass, wing area, the maximum (stall) lift coefficient, the cruising speed and the cruising drag 
coefficient of an airplane are given. The safe takeoff speed at sea level and the thrust that the engines must deliver during 
cruising are to be determined. 
 
Assumptions 1 Standard atmospheric conditions exist 2  The drag and lift produced by parts of the plane other than the 
wings are not considered. 3 The takeoff speed is 20% over the stall speed. 4 The fuel is used primarily to provide 
propulsive power to overcome drag, and thus the energy consumed by auxiliary equipment (lights, etc) is negligible. 
Properties 
The density of standard air is 1 = 1.225 kg/m3 at sea level, and 2 = 0.312 kg/m3 at 12,000 m altitude. The 
cruising drag coefficient is given to be CD  = 0.03.  The maximum lift coefficient is given to be CL,max = 3.2.

Therefore, the engines must supply 10,300 kW of propulsive power to overcome drag during cruising.  
 
Discussion 
The power determined above is the power to overcome the drag that acts on the wings only, and does not 
include the drag that act on the remaining parts of the aircraft (the fuselage, the tail, etc). Therefore, the total power required 
during cruising will be greater. The required rate of energy input can be determined by dividing the propulsive power by the 
propulsive efficiency.

Solution 
A blimp connected to the ground by a rope is subjected to parallel winds. The rope tension when the wind is 
at a specified value is submarine is  to be determined.  
Assumptions 1 The blimp can be treated as an ellipsoid. 2 The wind is steady and turbulent, and blows parallel to the 
ground.   
Properties 
The drag coefficient for an ellipsoid with L/D = 8/3 = 2.67 is CD = 0.1 in turbulent flow (Table 11-2). We 
take the density of air to be 1.20 kg/m3.  
Analysis 
The frontal area of an ellipsoid is A = D2/4. Noting that 1 m/s = 3.6 km/h, the drag force acting on the

Solution 
A large spherical tank located outdoors is subjected to winds. The drag force exerted on the tank by the 
winds is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The outer surfaces of the tank are smooth. 2 Air flow in the wind is steady and incompressible, and flow 
around the tank is uniform. 3 Turbulence in the wind is not considered. 4 The effect of any support bars on flow and drag is 
negligible. 
Properties 
The density and kinematic viscosity of air at 1 atm and 25C are  = 
1.184 kg/m3 and  = 1.56210-5 m2/s.

Solution 
A rectangular advertisement panel attached to a rectangular concrete block by two poles is to withstand high 
winds. For a given maximum wind speed, the maximum drag force on the panel and the poles, and the minimum length L 
of the concrete block for the panel to resist the winds are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow of air is steady and incompressible. 2 The wind is normal to the panel (to check for the worst 
case).  3 The flow is turbulent so that the tabulated value of the drag coefficients can be used. 
Properties 
In turbulent flow, the drag coefficient is CD = 0.3 for a circular rod, and CD = 2.0 for a thin rectangular plate 
(Table 11-2). The densities of air and concrete block are given to be  = 1.30 kg/m3 and c = 2300 kg/m3.

Therefore, the drag force acting on both poles is 68  2 = 136 N. Note that the drag force acting on poles is negligible

Note that the resultant drag force on the panel passes through its center, the drag force on the pole passes through the center 
of the pole, and the weight of the panel passes through the center of the block. When the concrete block is first tipped, the 
wind-loaded side of the block will be lifted off the ground, and thus the entire reaction force from the ground will act on the 
other side. Taking the moment about this side and setting it equal to zero gives

Therefore, the minimum length of the concrete block must be L = 3.70.   
Discussion 
This length appears to be large and impractical. It can be reduced to a more reasonable value by (a) 
increasing the height of the concrete block, (b) reducing the length of the poles (and thus the tipping moment), or (c) by 
attaching the concrete block to the ground (through long nails, for example).

Solution 
The bottom surface of a plastic boat is approximated as a flat surface. The friction drag exerted on the 
bottom surface of the boat by water and the power needed to overcome it are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible.  2 The water is calm (no significant currents or waves).  3 The 
water flow is turbulent over the entire surface because of the constant agitation of the boat. 4 The bottom surface of the boat 
is a flat surface, and it is smooth.  
Properties 
The density and dynamic viscosity of water at 15C are  = 999.1 kg/m3 and  = 1.138×10–3 kg/ms.

Discussion 
Note that the calculated drag force (and the power required to overcome it) is relatively small. This is not 
surprising since the drag force for blunt bodies (including those partially immersed in a liquid) is almost entirely due to 
pressure drag, and the friction drag is practically negligible compared to the pressure drag.

Solution 
The previous problem is reconsidered. The effect of boat speed on the drag force acting on the bottom 
surface of the boat and the power needed to overcome as the boat speed varies from 0 to 100 km/h in increments of 10 km/h 
is to be investigated.

Solution 
The chimney of a factory is subjected to high winds. The bending moment at the base of the chimney is to 
be determined.  
Assumptions 1 The flow of air in the wind is steady, turbulent, and incompressible. 2 The ground effect on the wind and 
the drag coefficient is negligible (a crude approximation) so that the resultant drag force acts through the center of the side 
surface. 3 The edge effects are negligible and thus the chimney can be treated as a 2-D long cylinder.  
Properties 
The drag coefficient for a long cylindrical bar in turbulent flow is 0.3 
(Table 11-2). The density of air at 20°C and 1 atm is  = 1.204 kg/m3.   
Analysis 
Noting that the frontal area is DH and 1 m/s

Solution 
The passenger compartment of a minivan is modeled as a rectangular box. The drag force acting on the top 
and the two side surfaces and the power needed to overcome it are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The air flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The air flow over the exterior surfaces is turbulent because of 
constant agitation.  3 Air is an ideal gas. 4 The top and side surfaces of the minivan are flat and smooth (in reality they can 
be rough). 5 The atmospheric air is calm (no significant winds).   
Properties 
The density and kinematic viscosity of air at 1 atm and 80F are  = 0.07350 lbm/ft3 and  = 0.6110 ft2/h =

Solution 
Cruising conditions of a passenger plane are given. The minimum safe landing and takeoff speeds with and 
without flaps, the angle of attack during cruising, and the power required are to be determined 
 
Assumptions 1 The drag and lift produced by parts of the plane other than the wings are not considered. 2 The wings are 
assumed to be two-dimensional airfoil sections, and the tip effects are neglected. 4 The lift and drag characteristics of the 
wings can be approximated by NACA 23012 so that Fig. 11-45 is applicable.   
Properties 
The densities of air are 0.075 lbm/ft3 on the ground and 
0.0208 lbm/ft3 at cruising altitude. The maximum lift coefficients of the 
wings are 3.48 and 1.52 with and without flaps, respectively (Fig. 11-45).

For the case of no flaps, the angle of attack corresponding to this value of CL  is determined from Fig. 11-45 to be about  =

(c) When aircraft cruises steadily, the net force acting on the aircraft is zero, and thus thrust provided by the engines must 
be equal to the drag force. The drag coefficient corresponding to the cruising lift coefficient of 0.40 is CD = 0.015 (Fig. 11-

Discussion 
Note that the engines must supply 6200 kW of power to overcome the drag during cruising. This is the 
power required to overcome the drag that acts on the wings only, and does not include the drag that acts on the remaining 
parts of the aircraft (the fuselage, the tail, etc).

Solution 
An automotive engine is approximated as a rectangular block. The drag force acting on the bottom surface 
of the engine is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The air flow is steady and incompressible. 2 Air is an ideal gas. 3 The atmospheric air is calm (no

surprising since the drag force for blunt bodies is almost entirely due to pressure drag, and the friction drag is practically 
negligible compared to the pressure drag.

Solution 
The total weight of a paratrooper and its parachute is given. The terminal velocity of the paratrooper in air is 
to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The air flow over the parachute is turbulent so that the tabulated value of the drag coefficient can be used. 
2 The variation of the air properties with altitude is negligible. 3 The buoyancy force applied by air to the person (and the 
parachute) is negligible because of the small volume occupied and the low air density. 
Properties 
The density of air is given to be 1.20 kg/m3. The drag coefficient of a parachute is CD = 1.3.  
Analysis 
The terminal velocity of a free falling object is reached when the drag force equals the weight of the solid 
object, less the buoyancy force applied by the fluid, which is negligible in this case,

Therefore, the velocity of the paratrooper will remain constant when it reaches the terminal velocity of 4.9 m/s = 18 km/h. 
Discussion 
The simple analysis above gives us a rough value for the terminal velocity. A more accurate answer can be 
obtained by a more detailed (and complex) analysis by considering the variation of air density with altitude, and by 
considering the uncertainty in the drag coefficient.

Solution 
The water needs of a recreational vehicle (RV) are to be met by installing a cylindrical tank on top of the 
vehicle. The additional power requirements of the RV at a specified speed for two orientations of the tank are to be 
determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow of air is steady and incompressible. 2 The effect of the 
tank and the RV on the drag coefficient of each other is negligible (no interference).  
3 The flow is turbulent so that the tabulated value of the drag coefficient can be used.   
Properties 
The drag coefficient for a cylinder corresponding to L/D = 3/0.5 = 6 
is CD = 0.95 when the circular surfaces of the tank face the front and back, and CD = 
0.8 when the circular surfaces of the tank face the sides of the RV (Table 11-2).  The 
density of air at the specified conditions is

Therefore, the additional power needed to overcome the drag caused by the tank is 1.05 kW and 6.77 W for the two 
orientations indicated. 
Discussion 
Note that the additional power requirement is the lowest when the tank is installed such that its circular 
surfaces face the front and back of the RV. This is because the frontal area of the tank is minimum in this orientation.

Solution 
A smooth ball is moving at a specified velocity. The increase in the drag coefficient when the ball spins is 
to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The outer surface of the ball is smooth.  2 The air is calm (no winds or 
drafts). 
Properties 
The density and kinematic viscosity of air at 1 atm and 25C are              
 = 1.184 kg/m3 and  = 1.56210-5 m2/s.

Then the drag coefficients for the ball with and without spin are determined from Figs. 11-36 and 11-53 to be: 
 
 
Without spin: 
CD = 0.50    (Fig. 11-36, smooth ball) 
 
With spin: 
CD = 0.58    (Fig. 11-53)

Note that the Reynolds number for this problem is 5.762104 which is close enough to 6104 for which Fig. 
11-53 is prepared. Therefore, the result obtained should be fairly accurate.

Solution 
A fluid flows over a 2.5-m long flat plate. The thickness of the boundary layer at intervals of 0.25 m is to be 
determined and plotted against the distance from the leading edge for air, water, and oil. 
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The critical Reynolds number is Recr = 5105.  3 Air is an ideal 
gas. 4 The surface of the plate is smooth. 
Properties 
The kinematic viscosity of the three fluids at 1 atm and 20°C are:  = 1.516×10–5 m2/s for air ,  = / =  
(1.002×10–3 kg/ms)/(998 kg/m3) = 1.004×10–6 m2/s for water, and  = 9.429×10–4 m2/s for oil.

Solution 
A fairing is installed to the front of a rig to reduce the drag coefficient. The maximum speed of the rig after 
the fairing is installed is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The rig moves steadily at a constant velocity on a straight path in calm weather. 2 The bearing friction 
resistance is constant. 3 The effect of velocity on the drag and rolling resistance coefficients is negligible. 4 The buoyancy 
of air is negligible. 5 The power produced by the engine is used to overcome rolling resistance, bearing friction, and 
aerodynamic drag.  
Properties 
The density of air is given to be 1.25 kg/m3. The drag coefficient of the rig is given to be CD = 0.96, and 
decreases to CD = 0.76 when a fairing is installed. The rolling resistance coefficient is CRR = 0.05.   
Analysis 
The bearing friction resistance is given to be Fbearing = 350 N. The rolling resistance is

Discussion 
Note that the maximum velocity of the rig increases from 110 km/h to 133 km/h as a result of reducing its 
drag coefficient from 0.96 to 0.76 while holding the bearing friction and the rolling resistance constant.

First some conversions: V = 55 mph = 80.667 ft/s, D = 2.62 in = 0.21833 ft, and the total distance traveled 
in one year = L = 16,000 miles = 8.448  107 ft. We calculate the Reynolds number,

which yields Vfuel required = 0.05343 ft3, which is equivalent to 0.3997 gallons per year. At $4 per gallon, the total cost 
is about $1.60 per year.  
 
Since the cost is minimal (only about a dollar per year), Janie’s friends should get off her back about this. 
 
Discussion 
I we use CD  0.50, the cost turns out to be $1.58, but we should report our result to only 2 significant digits 
anyway, so our answer is still $1.6 per year.

Solution 
Spherical aluminum balls are dropped into glycerin, and their terminal velocities are measured. The 
velocities are to be compared to those predicted by Stokes law, and the error involved is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The Reynolds number is low (at the order of 1) so that Stokes law is applicable (to be verified). 2 The 
diameter of the tube that contains the fluid is large enough to simulate free fall in an unbounded fluid body.  3 The tube is 
long enough to assure that the velocity measured is terminal velocity. 
Properties 
The density of aluminum balls is given to be s = 2700 kg/m3.  The density and viscosity of glycerin are 
given to be f  = 1274 kg/m3  and  = 1 kg/ms. 
Analysis 
The terminal velocity of a free falling object is reached when the drag force equals the weight of the solid 
object, less the buoyancy force applied by the fluid,

We observe that Re << 1 for the first two cases, and thus the creeping flow idealization is applicable. But this is not the case 
for the third case. 
 
Discussion 
If we used the general form of the equation (see next problem) we would obtain V = 59.7 mm/s for part (c), 
which is very close to the experimental result (60.4 mm/s).

Discussion 
There is a good agreement for the third case (case c), but the general Stokes law increased the error for the 
first two cases (cases a and b) from 2.9% and 2.9% to 3.2% and 5.2%, respectively. Therefore, the basic form of Stokes law 
should be preferred when the Reynolds number is much lower than 1.

Solution 
A spherical aluminum ball is dropped into oil. A relation is to be obtained for the variation of velocity with 
time and the terminal velocity of the ball. The variation of velocity with time is to be plotted, and the time it takes to reach 
99% of terminal velocity is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The Reynolds number is low (Re << 1) so that Stokes law is applicable. 2 The diameter of the tube that 
contains the fluid is large enough to simulate free fall in an unbounded fluid body.    
Properties 
The density of aluminum balls is given to be s = 2700 kg/m3.  The density and viscosity of oil are given to 
be f  = 876 kg/m3 and  = 0.2177 kg/ms.  
Analysis 
The free body diagram is shown in the figure. The net force acting downward on the ball is the weight of 
the ball less the weight of the ball and the buoyancy force applied by the fluid,

Solution 
Engine oil flows over a long flat plate. The distance from the leading edge xcr where the flow becomes 
turbulent is to be determined, and thickness of the boundary layer over a distance of 2xcr  is to be plotted. 
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The critical Reynolds number is Recr = 5105.  3 The surface of 
the plate is smooth. 
Properties 
The kinematic viscosity of engine oil at 40°C is  = 2.485×10–4 m2/s.  
Analysis 
The thickness of the boundary layer along the flow for laminar and turbulent flows is given by

Solution 
A spherical object is dropped into a fluid, and its terminal velocity is measured. The viscosity of the fluid is 
to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The Reynolds number is low (at the order of 1) so that Stokes law is applicable (to be verified). 2 The 
diameter of the tube that contains the fluid is large enough to simulate free fall in an unbounded fluid body.  3 The tube is 
long enough to assure that the velocity measured is the terminal velocity. 
Properties 
The density of glass ball is given to be s = 2500 kg/m3.  The density of the fluid is given to be f = 875 
kg/m3.

Discussion 
Flow separation starts at about Re = 10. Therefore, Stokes law can be used for Reynolds numbers up to this

Stagnation Properties 
 
 
 
 
12-1C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the temperature change from an airplane’s nose to far away from the aircraft.  
 
Analysis 
The temperature of the air rises as it approaches the nose because of the stagnation process. 
 
Discussion 
In the frame of reference moving with the aircraft, the air decelerates from high speed to zero at the nose 
(stagnation point), and this causes the air temperature to rise. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
12-2C  
Solution 
We are to define dynamic temperature.  
 
Analysis 
Dynamic temperature is the temperature rise of a fluid during a stagnation process. 
 
Discussion 
When a gas decelerates from high speed to zero speed at a stagnation point, the temperature of the gas rises. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
12-3C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the measurement of flowing air temperature with a probe – is there significant error?  
 
Analysis 
No, there is not significant error, because the velocities encountered in air-conditioning applications are 
very low, and thus the static and the stagnation temperatures are practically identical. 
 
Discussion 
If the air stream were supersonic, however, the error would indeed be significant. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
12-4  
Solution 
Air flows through a device. The stagnation temperature and pressure of air and its velocity are specified. 
The static pressure and temperature of air are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The stagnation process is isentropic. 2 Air is an ideal gas. 
Properties 
The properties of air at an anticipated average temperature of 600 K are cp = 1.051 kJ/kgK and k = 1.376. 
Analysis 
The static temperature and pressure of air are determined from

Solution 
Air at 320 K is flowing in a duct. The temperature that a stationary probe inserted into the duct will read is 
to be determined for different air velocities. 
Assumptions The stagnation process is isentropic.  
Properties 
The specific heat of air at room temperature is cp = 1.005 kJ/kgK.  
Analysis 
The air which strikes the probe will be brought to a complete stop, and thus it will undergo a stagnation 
process. The thermometer will sense the temperature of this stagnated air, which is the stagnation temperature, T0.  It is 
determined from

Solution 
Quiescent carbon dioxide at a given state is accelerated isentropically to a specified Mach number. The 
temperature and pressure of the carbon dioxide after acceleration are to be determined. 
Assumptions Carbon dioxide is an ideal gas with constant specific heats at room temperature. 
Properties 
The specific heat ratio of the carbon dioxide at room temperature is  k = 1.288. 
Analysis 
The inlet temperature and pressure in this case is equivalent to the stagnation temperature and pressure since 
the inlet velocity of the carbon dioxide is said to be negligible.  That is, T0 = Ti = 400 K and   P0 = Pi  = 1200 kPa.  Then,

Isentropic Flow Through Nozzles 
 
 
 
 
12-29C  
Solution 
We are to analyze if it is possible to accelerate a fluid to supersonic speeds with a velocity that is not sonic 
at the throat.  
 
Analysis 
No, if the flow in the throat is subsonic. If the velocity at the throat is subsonic, the diverging section 
would act like a diffuser and decelerate the flow. Yes, if the flow in the throat is already supersonic, the diverging 
section would accelerate the flow to even higher Mach number. 
 
Discussion 
In duct flow, the latter situation is not possible unless a second converging-diverging portion of the duct is 
located upstream, and there is sufficient pressure difference to choke the flow in the upstream throat. 
 
 
 
 
 
12-30C  
Solution 
We are to discuss what would happen if we add a diverging section to supersonic flow in a duct.  
 
Analysis 
The fluid would accelerate even further, as desired. 
 
Discussion 
This is the opposite of what would happen in subsonic flow. 
 
 
 
 
 
12-31C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the difference between Ma* and Ma.  
 
Analysis 
Ma* is the local velocity non-dimensionalized with respect to the sonic speed at the throat, whereas Ma 
is the local velocity non-dimensionalized with respect to the local sonic speed. 
 
Discussion 
The two are identical at the throat when the flow is choked. 
 
 
 
 
 
12-32C  
Solution 
We are to consider subsonic flow through a converging nozzle with critical pressure at the exit, and analyze 
the effect of lowering back pressure below the critical pressure.  
 
Analysis 
(a)  No effect on velocity.  (b)  No effect on pressure. (c)  No effect on mass flow rate. 
 
Discussion 
In this situation, the flow is already choked initially, so further lowering of the back pressure does not 
change anything upstream of the nozzle exit plane.

12-16
12-33C  
Solution 
We are to compare the mass flow rates through two identical converging nozzles, but with one having a 
diverging section.  
 
Analysis 
If the back pressure is low enough so that sonic conditions exist at the throats, the mass flow rates in 
the two nozzles would be identical. However, if the flow is not sonic at the throat, the mass flow rate through the 
nozzle with the diverging section would be greater, because it acts like a subsonic diffuser. 
 
Discussion 
Once the flow is choked at the throat, whatever happens downstream is irrelevant to the flow upstream of 
the throat. 
 
 
 
 
 
12-34C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the hypothetical situation of hypersonic flow at the outlet of a converging nozzle.  
 
Analysis 
Maximum flow rate through a converging nozzle is achieved when Ma = 1 at the exit of a nozzle. For all 
other Ma values the mass flow rate decreases.  Therefore, the mass flow rate would decrease if hypersonic velocities 
were achieved at the throat of a converging nozzle. 
 
Discussion 
Note that this is not possible unless the flow upstream of the converging nozzle is already hypersonic. 
 
 
 
 
 
12-35C  
Solution 
We are to consider subsonic flow through a converging nozzle, and analyze the effect of setting back 
pressure to critical pressure for a converging nozzle.  
 
Analysis 
(a) The exit velocity reaches the sonic speed,  (b)  the exit pressure equals the critical pressure, and  (c)  
the mass flow rate reaches the maximum value. 
 
Discussion 
In such a case, we say that the flow is choked. 
 
 
 
 
 
12-36C  
Solution 
We are to discuss what happens to several variables in the diverging section of a subsonic converging-
diverging nozzle.  
 
Analysis 
(a) The velocity decreases,  (b)  the pressure increases, and  (c)  the mass flow rate remains the same. 
 
Discussion 
Qualitatively, this is the same as what we are used to (in previous chapters) for incompressible flow. 
 
 
 
 
 
12-37C  
Solution 
We are to discuss what would happen if we add a diverging section to supersonic flow in a duct.  
 
Analysis 
The fluid would accelerate even further instead of decelerating. 
 
Discussion 
This is the opposite of what would happen in subsonic flow.

Nitrogen enters a converging-diverging nozzle at a given pressure. The critical velocity, pressure, 
temperature, and density in the nozzle are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 Nitrogen is an ideal gas. 2 Flow through the nozzle is steady, one-dimensional, and isentropic. 
Properties 
The properties of nitrogen are k = 1.4 and R = 0.2968 kJ/kg·K. 
Analysis 
The stagnation pressure in this case are identical to the inlet properties since the inlet velocity is negligible.  
They remain constant throughout the nozzle,

Solution 
For an ideal gas, an expression is to be obtained for the ratio of the speed of sound where Ma = 1 to the 
speed of sound based on the stagnation temperature, c*/c0.

Solution 
Air enters a converging-diverging nozzle at a specified pressure. The back pressure that will result in a 
specified exit Mach number is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 Air is an ideal gas with constant specific heats. 2 Flow through the nozzle is steady, one-dimensional, and 
isentropic. 
Properties 
The specific heat ratio of air is k = 1.4. 
Analysis 
The stagnation pressure in this case is identical to the inlet 
pressure since the inlet velocity is negligible.  It remains constant throughout the 
nozzle since the flow is isentropic, 
 
P0 = Pi  = 1.2 MPa 
From Table A-13 at Mae =1.8, we read Pe /P0 = 0.1740.  
Thus, 
P = 0.1740P0 = 0.1740(1.2 MPa) = 0.209 MPa = 209 kPa 
 
Discussion 
If we solve this problem using the relations for compressible isentropic flow, the results would be identical.

Solution 
Air enters a nozzle at specified temperature, pressure, and velocity. The exit pressure, exit temperature, and 
exit-to-inlet area ratio are to be determined for a Mach number of Ma = 1 at the exit. 
Assumptions 1 Air is an ideal gas with constant specific heats at room temperature. 2 Flow through the nozzle is steady, 
one-dimensional, and isentropic. 
Properties 
The properties of air are k = 1.4 and cp = 0.240 Btu/lbm·R (Table A-2Ea). 
Analysis 
The properties of the fluid at the location where Ma =1 are the critical properties, denoted by superscript *. 
We first determine the stagnation temperature and pressure, which remain constant throughout the nozzle since the flow is 
isentropic.

Solution 
For subsonic flow at the inlet, the variation of pressure, velocity, and Mach number along the length of the 
nozzle are to be sketched for an ideal gas under specified conditions. 
Assumptions 1 The gas is an ideal gas. 2 Flow through the nozzle is steady, one-
dimensional, and isentropic. 3 The flow is choked at the throat. 
Analysis 
Using EES and CO2 as the gas, we calculate and plot flow area 
A, velocity V, and Mach number Ma as the pressure drops from a stagnation 
value of 1400 kPa to 200 kPa. Note that the curve for A is related to the shape of 
the nozzle, with horizontal axis serving as the centerline. The EES equation 
window and the plot are shown below.

Discussion 
We are assuming that the back pressure is sufficiently low that the flow is choked at the throat, and the flow 
downstream of the throat is supersonic without any shock waves. Mach number and velocity continue to rise right through 
the throat into the diverging portion of the nozzle, since the flow becomes supersonic.

Solution 
We repeat the previous problem, but for supersonic flow at the inlet. The 
variation of pressure, velocity, and Mach number along the length of the nozzle are to be 
sketched for an ideal gas under specified conditions. 
Analysis 
Using EES and CO2 as the gas, we calculate and plot flow area A, 
velocity V, and Mach number Ma as the pressure rises from 200 kPa at a very high 
velocity to the stagnation value of 1400 kPa. Note that the curve for A is related to the 
shape of the nozzle, with horizontal axis serving as the centerline.

Solution 
Air enters a converging-diverging nozzle at a specified temperature and pressure with low velocity. The 
pressure, temperature, velocity, and mass flow rate are to be calculated in the specified test section. 
Assumptions 1 Air is an ideal gas. 2 Flow through the nozzle is steady, one-dimensional, and isentropic.

The stagnation properties in this case are identical to the inlet properties since the inlet velocity is

Solution 
Air enters a nozzle at specified temperature and pressure with low velocity. The exit pressure, exit 
temperature, and exit-to-inlet area ratio are to be determined for a Mach number of Ma = 1 at the exit. 
Assumptions 1 Air is an ideal gas. 2 Flow through the nozzle is steady, one-dimensional, and isentropic. 
Properties 
The specific heat ratio of air is k = 1.4. 
Analysis 
The properties of the fluid at the location where Ma = 1 are the critical 
properties, denoted by superscript *. The stagnation temperature and pressure in this 
case are identical to the inlet temperature and pressure since the inlet velocity is 
negligible.  They remain constant throughout the nozzle since the flow is isentropic. 
 
T0 = Ti  = 420 K 
and 
 
P0 = Pi  = 0.5 MPa 
From Table A-13 (or from Eqs. 12-18 and 12-19) at Ma =1, we read T/T0 =0.8333, P/P0 = 0.5283.  Thus, 
 
T = 0.8333T0 = 0.8333(420 K) = 350 K 
and 
P = 0.5283P0 = 0.5283(0.5 MPa) = 0.264 MPa 
The Mach number at the nozzle inlet is Ma = 0 since Vi  0.  From Table A-13 at this Mach number we read Ai/A* = . 
Thus the ratio of the throat area to the nozzle inlet area is

Solution 
Air enters a converging nozzle at a specified temperature and pressure with low velocity. The exit pressure, 
the exit velocity, and the mass flow rate versus the back pressure are to be calculated and plotted. 
Assumptions 1 Air is an ideal gas with constant specific heats at room temperature. 2 Flow through the nozzle is steady, 
one-dimensional, and isentropic. 
Properties 
The properties of air are k = 1.4, R = 0.287 kJ/kg·K, and cp = 1.005 kJ/kg·K. 
Analysis 
The stagnation properties in this case are identical to the inlet properties since the inlet velocity is 
negligible. They remain constant throughout the nozzle since the flow is isentropic.,

We are to reconsider the previous problem. Using EES (or other) software, we are to solve the problem for 
the inlet conditions of 0.8 MPa and 1200 K. 
 
Analysis 
Air at 800 kPa, 1200 K enters a converging nozzle with a negligible velocity. The throat area of the nozzle 
is 10 cm2.  Assuming isentropic flow, calculate and plot the exit pressure, the exit velocity, and the mass flow rate versus 
the back pressure Pb for 0.8>= Pb >=0.1 MPa.

Shock Waves and Expansion Waves 
 
 
 
12-52C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the applicability of the isentropic flow relations across shocks and expansion waves.  
 
Analysis 
The isentropic relations of ideal gases are not applicable for flows across (a) normal shock waves and (b) 
oblique shock waves, but they are applicable for flows across (c) Prandtl-Meyer expansion waves. 
 
Discussion 
Flow across any kind of shock wave involves irreversible losses – hence, it cannot be isentropic. 
 
 
 
 
 
12-53C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the states on the Fanno and Rayleigh lines.  
 
Analysis 
The Fanno line represents the states that satisfy the conservation of mass and energy equations. The 
Rayleigh line represents the states that satisfy the conservation of mass and momentum equations. The intersections 
points of these lines represent the states that satisfy the conservation of mass, energy, and momentum equations. 
 
Discussion 
T-s diagrams are quite helpful in understanding these kinds of flows. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
12-54C  
Solution 
We are to analyze a claim about oblique shock analysis.  
 
Analysis 
Yes, the claim is correct. Conversely, normal shocks can be thought of as special oblique shocks in which 
the shock angle is  = /2, or 90o.  
 
Discussion 
The component of flow in the direction normal to the oblique shock acts exactly like a normal shock. We 
can think of the flow parallel to the oblique shock as “going along for the ride” –  it does not affect anything. 
 
 
 
 
 
12-55C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the effect of a normal shock wave on several properties.  
 
Analysis 
(a) velocity decreases,  (b) static temperature increases,  (c) stagnation temperature remains the same,  
(d) static pressure increases, and  (e) stagnation pressure decreases. 
 
Discussion 
In addition, the Mach number goes from supersonic (Ma > 1) to subsonic (Ma < 1).

12-31
12-56C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the formation of oblique shocks and how they differ from normal shocks.  
 
Analysis 
Oblique shocks occur when a gas flowing at supersonic speeds strikes a flat or inclined surface. Normal 
shock waves are perpendicular to flow whereas inclined shock waves, as the name implies, are typically inclined relative 
to the flow direction. Also, normal shocks form a straight line whereas oblique shocks can be straight or curved, 
depending on the surface geometry. 
 
Discussion 
In addition, while a normal shock must go from supersonic (Ma > 1) to subsonic (Ma < 1), the Mach 
number downstream of an oblique shock can be either supersonic or subsonic. 
 
 
 
 
 
12-57C  
Solution 
We are to discuss whether the flow upstream and downstream of an oblique shock needs to be supersonic.  
 
Analysis 
Yes, the upstream flow has to be supersonic for an oblique shock to occur.  No, the flow downstream of an 
oblique shock can be subsonic, sonic, and even supersonic. 
 
Discussion 
The latter is not true for normal shocks. For a normal shock, the flow must always go from supersonic (Ma 
> 1) to subsonic (Ma < 1). 
 
 
 
 
 
12-58C  
Solution 
We are to determine if Ma downstream of a normal shock can be supersonic.  
 
Analysis 
No, the second law of thermodynamics requires the flow after the shock to be subsonic. 
 
Discussion 
A normal shock wave always goes from supersonic to subsonic in the flow direction. 
 
 
 
 
 
12-59C  
Solution 
We are to discuss shock detachment at the nose of a 2-D wedge-shaped body.  
 
Analysis 
When the wedge half-angle  is greater than the maximum deflection angle max, the shock becomes 
curved and detaches from the nose of the wedge, forming what is called a detached oblique shock or a bow wave. The 
numerical value of the shock angle at the nose is   = 90o. 
 
Discussion 
When  is less than max, the oblique shock is attached to the nose. 
 
 
 
 
 
12-60C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the shock at the nose of a rounded body in supersonic flow.  
 
Analysis 
When supersonic flow impinges on a blunt body like the rounded nose of an aircraft, the wedge half-angle  
at the nose is 90o, and an attached oblique shock cannot exist, regardless of Mach number. Therefore, a detached oblique 
shock must occur in front of all such blunt-nosed bodies, whether two-dimensional, axisymmetric, or fully three-
dimensional.  
 
Discussion 
Since  = 90o at the nose,  is always greater than max, regardless of Ma or the shape of the rest of the body.

12-61C  
Solution 
We are to discuss if a shock wave can develop in the converging section of a C-V nozzle.  
 
Analysis 
No, because the flow must be supersonic before a shock wave can occur. The flow in the converging section 
of a nozzle is always subsonic. 
 
Discussion 
A normal shock (if it is to occur) would occur in the supersonic (diverging) section of the nozzle. 
 
 
 
 
 
12-62  
Solution 
Air flowing through a nozzle experiences a normal shock. Various properties are to be calculated before and 
after the shock. 
Assumptions 1 Air is an ideal gas with constant specific heats. 2 Flow through the nozzle is steady, one-dimensional, and 
isentropic before the shock occurs. 
Properties 
The properties of air at room temperature are k= 1.4, R = 0.287 kJ/kg·K, and cp = 1.005 kJ/kg·K.

Solution 
Air enters a converging-diverging nozzle at a specified state. The required back pressure that produces a 
normal shock at the exit plane is to be determined for the specified nozzle geometry. 
Assumptions 1 Air is an ideal gas. 2 Flow through the nozzle is steady, one-dimensional, and isentropic before the shock 
occurs. 3 The shock wave occurs at the exit plane. 
Analysis 
The inlet stagnation pressure in this case is identical to the inlet pressure since the inlet velocity is 
negligible.  Since the flow before the shock to be isentropic, 
 
P01 = Pi = 2 MPa 
It is specified that A/A* =3.5. From Table A-13, Mach number and the pressure 
ratio which corresponds to this area ratio are the Ma1 =2.80 and P1/P01 = 0.0368.  
The pressure ratio across the shock for this Ma1 value is, from Table A-14, P2/P1 
= 8.98.  Thus the back pressure, which is equal to the static pressure at the 
nozzle exit, must be 
       P2 =8.98P1 = 8.980.0368P01 = 8.980.0368(2 MPa) = 0.661 MPa 
 
Discussion 
We can also solve this problem using the relations for compressible flow and normal shock functions. The 
results would be identical.

Solution 
Air flowing through a nozzle experiences a normal shock. Effect of the shock wave on various properties is 
to be determined. Analysis is to be repeated for helium 
 
Assumptions 1 Air and helium are ideal gases with constant specific heats. 2 Flow through the nozzle is steady, one-
dimensional, and isentropic before the shock occurs. 
Properties 
The properties of air are k = 1.4 and R = 0.06855 Btu/lbm·R, and the properties of helium are k = 1.667 and 
R = 0.4961 Btu/lbm·R. 
Analysis 
The air properties upstream the shock are 
 
Ma1 = 2.5, P1 = 10 psia, and T1 = 440.5 R 
Fluid properties after the shock (denoted by subscript 2) are related to those 
before the shock through the functions listed in Table A-14.  For Ma1 = 2.5,

Then the stagnation pressure P02, static pressure P2, and static temperature T2, are determined to be 
 
P02 = 8.5262P1 = (8.5262)(10 psia) = 85.3 psia 
 
P2  = 7.125P1 = (7.125)(10 psia) = 71.3 psia 
 
T2  = 2.1375T1 = (2.1375)(440.5 R) = 942 R 
The air velocity after the shock can be determined from V2 = Ma2c2, where c2 is the speed of sound at the exit conditions 
after the shock,

Solution 
We are to reconsider Prob. 12-67E. Using EES (or other) software, we are to study the effects of both air 
and helium flowing steadily in a nozzle when there is a normal shock at a Mach number in the range 2 < Mx < 3.5.   In 
addition to the required information, we are to calculate the entropy change of the air and helium across the normal shock, 
and tabulate the results in a parametric table. 
 
Analysis 
We use EES to calculate the entropy change of the air and helium across the normal shock. The results are 
given in the Parametric Table for 2 < M_x < 3.5. 
 
Procedure NormalShock(M_x,k:M_y,PyOPx, TyOTx,RhoyORhox, PoyOPox, PoyOPx)

else 
 
 
 
M_y=sqrt( (M_x^2+2/(k-1)) / (2*M_x^2*k/(k-1)-1) ) 
 
 
PyOPx=(1+k*M_x^2)/(1+k*M_y^2) 
 
 
TyOTx=( 1+M_x^2*(k-1)/2  )/(1+M_y^2*(k-1)/2  ) 
 
 
RhoyORhox=PyOPx/TyOTx 
 
 
PoyOPox=M_x/M_y*(  (1+M_y^2*(k-1)/2)/ (1+M_x^2*(k-1)/2)   )^((k+1)/(2*(k-1))) 
 
 
PoyOPx=(1+k*M_x^2)*(1+M_y^2*(k-1)/2)^(k/(k-1))/(1+k*M_y^2) 
 
Endif

Solution 
Air flowing through a converging-diverging nozzle experiences a normal shock at the exit. The effect of the 
shock wave on various properties is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 Air is an ideal gas with constant specific heats. 2 Flow through the nozzle is steady, one-dimensional, and 
isentropic before the shock occurs. 3 The shock wave occurs at the exit plane. 
Properties 
The properties of air are k = 1.4 and R = 0.287 kJ/kg·K. 
Analysis 
The inlet stagnation properties in this case are identical to the inlet properties since the inlet velocity is 
negligible.  Then,

Solution 
The entropy change of air across the shock for upstream Mach numbers between 0.5 and 1.5 is to be 
determined and plotted. 
Assumptions 1 Air is an ideal gas. 2 Flow through the nozzle is steady, one-dimensional, and isentropic before the shock 
occurs. 
Properties 
The properties of air are k = 1.4, R = 0.287 kJ/kg·K, and cp = 1.005 kJ/kg·K. 
Analysis 
The entropy change across the shock is determined to be

Discussion 
The total entropy change is negative for upstream Mach numbers Ma1 less than unity.  Therefore, normal 
shocks cannot occur when Ma1  1.

Solution 
Supersonic airflow approaches the nose of a two-dimensional 
wedge and undergoes a straight oblique shock. For a specified Mach number, the 
minimum shock angle and the maximum deflection angle are to be determined. 
Assumptions Air is an ideal gas with a constant specific heat ratio of k = 1.4 (so that 
Fig. 12-41 is applicable).

Solution 
Air flowing at a specified supersonic Mach number undergoes an expansion turn. The Mach number, 
pressure, and temperature downstream of the sudden expansion along a wall are 
to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The boundary layer on the wedge is very 
thin. 3 Air is an ideal gas with constant specific heats. 
Properties 
The specific heat ratio of air is k = 1.4. 
Analysis 
On the basis of Assumption #2, we take the deflection angle as 
equal to the wedge half-angle, i.e.,    = 15o. Then the upstream and 
downstream Prandtl-Meyer functions are determined to be

Solution 
Air flowing at a specified supersonic Mach number is forced to turn upward by a ramp, and weak oblique 
shock forms. The wave angle, Mach number, pressure, and temperature after the 
shock are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The boundary layer on the wedge is very

Solution 
Air flowing at a specified supersonic Mach number is forced to undergo a compression turn (an oblique 
shock)., The Mach number, pressure, and temperature downstream of the oblique 
shock are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The boundary layer on the wedge is very 
thin. 3 Air is an ideal gas with constant specific heats. 
Properties 
The specific heat ratio of air is k = 1.4. 
Analysis 
On the basis of Assumption #2, we take the deflection angle as 
equal to the wedge half-angle, i.e.,    = 15o. Then the two values of oblique 
shock angle  are determined from

Discussion 
Note that the change in Mach number, pressure, temperature across the strong shock are much greater than 
the changes across the weak shock, as expected. For both the weak and strong oblique shock cases, Ma1,n is supersonic and 
Ma2,n is subsonic. However, Ma2 is supersonic across the weak oblique shock, but subsonic across the strong oblique shock.

Solution 
Air flowing through a nozzle experiences a normal shock.  The effect of the shock wave on various 
properties is to be determined. Analysis is to be repeated for helium under the same conditions. 
Assumptions 1 Air and helium are ideal gases with constant specific heats. 2 Flow through the nozzle is steady, one-
dimensional, and isentropic before the shock occurs. 
Properties 
The properties of air are k = 1.4 and R = 0.287 kJ/kg·K, and the properties of helium are k = 1.667 and R = 
2.0769 kJ/kg·K. 
Analysis 
The air properties upstream the shock are 
 
Ma1 = 2.6, P1 = 58 kPa, and T1 = 270 K 
Fluid properties after the shock (denoted by subscript 2) are related to those 
before the shock through the functions in Table A-14. For Ma1 = 2.6,

We obtained these values using analytical relations in Table 14. Then the stagnation pressure P02, static pressure P2, and 
static temperature T2, are determined to be 
 
P02 = 9.1813P1 = (9.1813)(58 kPa) = 532.5 kPa 
 
P2 = 7.7200P1 = (7.7200)(58 kPa) = 447.8 kPa 
 
T2 = 2.9220T1 = (2.2383)(270 K) = 604.3 K 
The air velocity after the shock can be determined from V2 = Ma2c2, where c2 is the speed of sound at the exit conditions 
after the shock,

Solution 
Air flowing through a nozzle experiences a normal shock. The entropy change of air across the normal 
shock wave is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 Air and helium are ideal gases with constant specific heats. 2 Flow through the nozzle is steady, one-
dimensional, and isentropic before the shock occurs. 
Properties 
The properties of air are R = 0.287 kJ/kg·K and cp = 1.005 kJ/kg·K, and the properties of helium are R = 
2.0769 kJ/kg·K and cp = 5.1926 kJ/kg·K.

Duct Flow with Heat Transfer and Negligible Friction (Rayleigh Flow) 
 
 
 
12-80C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the effect of heating on the flow velocity in subsonic Rayleigh flow.  
 
Analysis 
Heating the fluid increases the flow velocity in subsonic Rayleigh flow, but decreases the flow velocity 
in supersonic Rayleigh flow. 
 
Discussion 
These results are not necessarily intuitive, but must be true in order to satisfy the conservation laws. 
 
 
 
 
12-81C  
Solution 
We are to discuss what the points on a T-s diagram of Rayleigh flow represent.  
 
Analysis 
The points on the Rayleigh line represent the states that satisfy the conservation of mass, momentum, 
and energy equations as well as the property relations for a given state. Therefore, for a given inlet state, the fluid 
cannot exist at any downstream state outside the Rayleigh line on a T-s diagram. 
 
Discussion 
The T-s diagram is quite useful, since any downstream state must lie on the Rayleigh line. 
 
 
 
 
 
12-82C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the effect of heat gain and heat loss on entropy during Rayleigh flow.  
 
Analysis 
In Rayleigh flow, the effect of heat gain is to increase the entropy of the fluid, and the effect of heat loss 
is to decrease the entropy. 
 
Discussion 
You should recall from thermodynamics that the entropy of a system can be lowered by removing heat.

12-83C  
Solution 
We are to discuss how temperature and stagnation temperature change in subsonic Rayleigh flow.  
 
Analysis 
In Rayleigh flow, the stagnation temperature T0 always increases with heat transfer to the fluid, but the 
temperature T decreases with heat transfer in the Mach number range of 0.845 <  Ma < 1 for air. Therefore, the 
temperature in this case will decrease. 
 
Discussion 
This at first seems counterintuitive, but if heat were not added, the temperature would drop even more if the 
air were accelerated isentropically from Ma = 0.92 to 0.95. 
 
 
 
 
 
12-84C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the characteristic aspect of Rayleigh flow, and its main assumptions.  
 
Analysis 
The characteristic aspect of Rayleigh flow is its involvement of heat transfer. The main assumptions 
associated with Rayleigh flow are: the flow is steady, one-dimensional, and frictionless through a constant-area duct, and 
the fluid is an ideal gas with constant specific heats. 
 
Discussion 
Of course, there is no such thing as frictionless flow. It is better to say that frictional effects are negligible 
compared to the heating effects. 
 
 
 
 
 
12-85C  
Solution 
We are to examine the Mach number at the end of a choked duct in Rayleigh flow when more heat is added.  
 
Analysis 
The flow is choked, and thus the flow at the duct exit remains sonic. 
 
Discussion 
There is no mechanism for the flow to become supersonic in this case.

Solution 
Argon flowing at subsonic velocity in a constant-diameter duct is accelerated by heating. The highest rate of 
heat transfer without reducing the mass flow rate is to be determined.  
Assumptions 1 The assumptions associated with Rayleigh flow (i.e., steady one-dimensional flow of an ideal gas with 
constant properties through a constant cross-sectional area duct with negligible frictional effects) are valid.  2 Mass flow 
rate remains constant. 
Properties 
We take the properties of argon to be k = 1.667, cp = 
0.5203 kJ/kgK, and R = 0.2081 kJ/kgK.    
Analysis 
Heat transfer stops when the flow is choked, and thus 
Ma2 = V2/c2 = 1. The inlet stagnation temperature is

Discussion 
It can also be shown that T2 = 1600 K, which is the highest thermodynamic temperature that can be attained 
under stated conditions. If more heat is transferred, the additional temperature rise will cause the mass flow rate to decrease. 
Also, in the solution of this problem, we cannot use the values of Table A-15 since they are based on k = 1.4.

Solution 
Air is heated in a duct during subsonic flow until it is choked. For specified pressure and velocity at the exit, 
the temperature, pressure, and velocity at the inlet are to be determined. 
Assumptions The assumptions associated with Rayleigh flow (i.e., steady one-dimensional flow of an ideal gas with 
constant properties through a constant cross-sectional area duct with negligible frictional effects) are valid.   
Properties 
We take the properties of air to be k = 1.4, cp = 1.005 kJ/kgK, and R = 0.287 kJ/kgK.

Solution 
Air flowing with a subsonic velocity in a duct. The variation of entropy with temperature is to be 
investigated as the exit temperature varies from 600 K to 5000 K in increments of 200 K. The results are to be tabulated and 
plotted. 
 
Analysis We solve this problem using EES making use of Rayleigh functions. The EES Equations window is printed 
below, along with the tabulated and plotted results.

Solution 
Air flowing with a subsonic velocity in a square duct is accelerated by heating until the flow is choked at 
the exit. The rate of heat transfer and the entropy change are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The assumptions associated with Rayleigh flow (i.e., steady one-dimensional flow of an ideal gas with 
constant properties through a constant cross-sectional area duct with negligible frictional effects) are valid. 2 The flow is 
choked at the duct exit. 3 Mass flow rate remains constant. 
Properties 
We take the properties of air to be k = 1.4, cp = 0.2400 Btu/lbmR, and R = 0.06855 Btu/lbmR = 0.3704 
psiaft3/lbmR.

Solution 
Fuel is burned in a tubular combustion chamber with compressed air. For a specified exit Mach number, the 
exit temperature and the rate of fuel consumption are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The assumptions associated with Rayleigh flow (i.e., steady one-dimensional flow of an ideal gas with 
constant properties through a constant cross-sectional area duct with negligible frictional effects) are valid. 2 Combustion is 
complete, and it is treated as a heat addition process, with no change in the chemical composition of flow. 3 The increase in 
mass flow rate due to fuel injection is disregarded.   
Properties 
We take the properties of air to be k = 1.4, cp = 1.005 kJ/kgK, and R = 0.287 kJ/kgK.

Solution 
Air flowing at a supersonic velocity in a duct is decelerated by heating. The highest temperature air can be 
heated by heat addition and the rate of heat transfer are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The assumptions associated with Rayleigh flow (i.e., steady one-dimensional flow of an ideal gas with 
constant properties through a constant cross-sectional area duct with negligible frictional effects) are valid.  2 Mass flow 
rate remains constant. 
Properties 
We take the properties of air to be k = 1.4, cp = 1.005 kJ/kgK, and R = 0.287 kJ/kgK.    
Analysis 
Heat transfer will stop when the flow is choked, and thus Ma2 = V2/c2 = 1. Knowing stagnation properties, 
the static properties are determined to be

Discussion 
Note that this is the highest temperature that can be attained under stated conditions. If more heat is 
transferred, the additional temperature will cause the mass flow rate to decrease. Also, once the sonic conditions are 
reached, the thermodynamic temperature can be increased further by cooling the fluid and reducing the velocity (see the T-s 
diagram for Rayleigh flow).

Adiabatic Duct Flow with Friction (Fanno Flow) 
 
 
 
12-97C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the effect of friction on velocity in Fanno flow.  
 
Analysis 
Friction increases the flow velocity in subsonic Fanno flow, but decreases the flow velocity in 
supersonic flow. 
 
Discussion 
These results may not be intuitive, but they come from following the Fanno line, which satisfies the 
conservation equations. 
 
 
 
 
12-98C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the T-s diagram for Fanno flow.  
 
Analysis 
The points on the Fanno line on a T-s diagram represent the states that satisfy the conservation of mass, 
momentum, and energy equations as well as the property relations for a given inlet state. Therefore, for a given initial 
state, the fluid cannot exist at any downstream state outside the Fanno line on a T-s diagram. 
 
Discussion 
The T-s diagram is quite useful, since any downstream state must lie on the Fanno line. 
 
 
 
 
12-99C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the effect of friction on the entropy during Fanno flow.  
 
Analysis 
In Fanno flow, the effect of friction is always to increase the entropy of the fluid. Therefore Fanno flow 
always proceeds in the direction of increasing entropy. 
 
Discussion 
To do otherwise would violate the second law of thermodynamics. 
 
 
 
 
12-100C  
Solution 
We are to discuss what happens to supersonic Fanno flow, initially sonic at the exit, when the duct is 
extended.   
 
Analysis 
The flow at the duct exit remains sonic. The mass flow rate must remain constant since upstream 
conditions are not affected by the added duct length. 
 
Discussion 
The mass flow rate is fixed by the upstream stagnation conditions and the size of the throat – therefore, the 
mass flow rate does not change by extending the duct. However, a shock wave appears in the duct when it is extended. 
 
 
 
 
 
12-101C  
Solution 
We are to examine what happens when the Mach number of air decreases in supersonic Fanno flow.  
 
Analysis 
During supersonic Fanno flow, the stagnation temperature T0 remains constant, stagnation pressure P0 
decreases, and entropy s increases. 
 
Discussion 
Friction leads to irreversible losses, which are felt as a loss of stagnation pressure and an increase of 
entropy. However, since the flow is adiabatic, the stagnation temperature does not change downstream.

12-102C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the characteristic aspect of Fanno flow and its main assumptions.  
 
Analysis 
The characteristic aspect of Fanno flow is its consideration of friction. The main assumptions associated 
with Fanno flow are: the flow is steady, one-dimensional, and adiabatic through a constant-area duct, and the fluid is an 
ideal gas with constant specific heats. 
 
Discussion 
Compared to Rayleigh flow, Fanno flow accounts for friction but neglects heat transfer effects, whereas 
Rayleigh flow accounts for heat transfer but neglects frictional effects. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
12-103C  
Solution 
We are to discuss what happens to choked subsonic Fanno flow when the duct is extended.  
 
Analysis 
The flow is choked, and thus the flow at the duct exit must remain sonic. The mass flow rate has to 
decrease as a result of extending the duct length in order to compensate. 
 
Discussion 
Since there is no way for the flow to become supersonic (e.g., there is no throat), the upstream flow must 
adjust itself such that the flow at the exit plan remains sonic. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
12-104C  
Solution 
We are to examine what happens when the Mach number of air increases in subsonic Fanno flow.  
 
Analysis 
During subsonic Fanno flow, the stagnation temperature T0 remains constant, stagnation pressure P0 
decreases, and entropy s increases. 
 
Discussion 
Friction leads to irreversible losses, which are felt as a loss of stagnation pressure and an increase of 
entropy. However, since the flow is adiabatic, the stagnation temperature does not change downstream.

Solution 
Subsonic airflow in a constant cross-sectional area adiabatic duct is considered. For a specified exit Mach 
number, the duct length, temperature, pressure, and velocity at the duct exit are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The assumptions associated with Fanno flow (i.e., 
steady, frictional flow of an ideal gas with constant properties through a 
constant cross-sectional area adiabatic duct) are valid. 2 The friction 
factor remains constant along the duct. 
Properties 
We take the properties of air to be k = 1.4, cp = 1.005 
kJ/kgK, and R = 0.287 kJ/kgK. The average friction factor is given to 
be f = 0.021.

Discussion 
Note that it takes a duct length of 12.8 m for the Mach number to increase from 0.4 to 0.8. The Mach 
number rises at a much higher rate as sonic conditions are approached. The maximum (or sonic) duct lengths at the inlet 
and exit states in this case are L1
* = 13.2 m and L2
* = 0.413 m. Therefore, the flow would reach sonic conditions if a 0.413-
m long section were added to the existing duct.

Solution 
Air enters a constant-area adiabatic duct of given length at a specified state. The exit Mach number, exit 
velocity, and the mass flow rate are to be determined.

Analysis 
The first thing we need to know is whether the flow is 
choked at the exit or not. Therefore, we first determine the inlet Mach

Solution 
Air enters a constant-area adiabatic duct at a specified state, and undergoes a normal shock at a specified 
location. The exit velocity, temperature, and pressure are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The assumptions associated with Fanno flow (i.e., steady, 
frictional flow of an ideal gas with constant properties through a constant 
cross-sectional area adiabatic duct) are valid. 2 The friction factor is 
constant along the duct.  
Properties 
We take the properties of air to be k = 1.4, cp = 1.005 
kJ/kgK, and R = 0.287 kJ/kgK. The friction factor is given to be f = 0.007.  
Analysis 
The Fanno flow functions corresponding to the inlet Mach number of 2.8 are, from Table A-16, 
Ma1 = 2.8: 
(fL*/Dh)1 = 0.4898 
T1/T*  = 0.4673, P1/P* = 0.2441  
First we check to make sure that the flow everywhere upstream the shock is supersonic. The required duct length from the 
inlet L1

Discussion 
It can be shown that L3

Solution 
Helium enters a constant-area adiabatic duct at a specified state, and leaves at sonic state. The maximum 
duct length that will not cause the mass flow rate to be reduced is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The assumptions associated with Fanno flow (i.e., 
steady, frictional flow of an ideal gas with constant properties through a 
constant cross-sectional area adiabatic duct) are valid. 2 The friction 
factor is constant along the duct.   
Properties 
We take the properties of helium to be k = 1.667, cp = 
1.2403 Btu/lbmR, and R = 0.4961 Btu/lbmR. The friction factor is 
given to be f = 0.025.   
Analysis 
The Fanno flow function fL*/D corresponding to the inlet 
Mach number of 0.2 is (Table A-16)

Solution 
Subsonic airflow in a constant cross-sectional area adiabatic duct is considered. The duct length from the 
inlet where the inlet velocity doubles and the pressure drop in that section are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The assumptions associated with Fanno flow (i.e., 
steady, frictional flow of an ideal gas with constant properties through a 
constant cross-sectional area adiabatic duct) are valid. 2 The friction 
factor remains constant along the duct. 
Properties 
We take the properties of air to be k = 1.4, cp = 1.005 
kJ/kgK, and R = 0.287 kJ/kgK. The average friction factor is given to 
be f = 0.014.

Discussion 
Note that it takes a duct length of 39.7 m for the velocity to double, and the Mach number to increase from 
0.3347 to 0.693. The maximum (or sonic) duct lengths at the inlet and exit states in this case are L1
* = 42.1 m and L2
* = 2.38 
m. Therefore, the flow would reach sonic conditions if there is an additional 2.38 m of duct length.

Solution 
Air enters a constant-area adiabatic duct of given length at a specified state. The velocity, temperature, and 
pressure at the duct exit are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The assumptions associated with Fanno flow (i.e., 
steady, frictional flow of an ideal gas with constant properties through a 
constant cross-sectional area adiabatic duct) are valid. 2 The friction 
factor is constant along the duct.  
Properties 
We take the properties of helium to be k = 1.4, cp = 
0.2400 Btu/lbmR, and R = 0.06855 Btu/lbmR = 0.3704 psiaft3/lbmR. 
The friction factor is given to be f = 0.025.   
Analysis 
The first thing we need to know is whether the flow is 
choked at the exit or not. Therefore, we first determine the inlet Mach 
number and the corresponding value of the function fL*/Dh ,

Discussion 
It can be shown that L2
* = 4.8 ft, indicating that it takes a duct length of 50 ft for the Mach number to 
increase from 0.4066 to 0.7091, but only 4.8 ft to increase from 0.7091 to 1. Therefore, the Mach number rises at a much 
higher rate as sonic conditions are approached.

Choked subsonic airflow in a constant cross-sectional area adiabatic duct is considered. The variation of 
duct length with Mach number is to be investigated, and the results are to be plotted.

factor is given to be f = 0.02. 
Analysis  The flow is choked, and thus Ma2 =1. Corresponding to the 
inlet Mach number of Ma1 = 0.1 we have, from Table A-16, fL*/Dh =

Discussion 
Note that the Mach number increases very mildly at the beginning, and then rapidly near the duct outlet. It

Discussion 
Note that the Mach number increases very mildly at the beginning, and then rapidly near the duct outlet. It 
takes 262 m of duct length for Mach number to increase from 0.1 to 0.2, but only 1 m to increase from 0.7 to 1.

Solution 
The flow of argon gas in a constant cross-sectional area adiabatic duct is considered. The variation of 
entropy change with exit temperature is to be investigated, and the calculated results are to be plotted on a T-s diagram. 
 
Assumptions 1 The assumptions associated with Fanno flow 
(i.e., steady, frictional flow of an ideal gas with constant properties 
through a constant cross-sectional area adiabatic duct) are valid. 2 
The friction factor remains constant along the duct. 
Properties 
The properties of argon are given to be k = 1.667, 
cp = 0.5203 kJ/kgK, and R = 0.2081 kJ/kgK. The average friction 
factor is given to be f = 0.005. 
Analysis 
Using EES, we determine the entropy change and tabulate and plot the results as follows:

Discussion 
Note that entropy increases with increasing duct length and Mach number (and thus decreasing 
temperature). It reached a maximum value of 0.259 kJ/kg.K when the Mach number reaches Ma2 =1 and thus  the flow is 
choked.

Solution 
Air enters a constant-area adiabatic duct at a specified state, and leaves at sonic state. The maximum duct 
length that will not cause the mass flow rate to be reduced is to be determined. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Assumptions 1 The assumptions associated with Fanno flow (i.e., steady, frictional flow of an ideal gas with constant 
properties through a constant cross-sectional area adiabatic duct) are valid. 2 The friction factor is constant along the duct.   
Properties 
We take the properties of air to be k = 1.4, cp = 1.005 kJ/kgK, and R = 0.287 kJ/kgK. The friction factor is 
given to be f = 0.018.  
Analysis 
The mass flow rate will be maximum when the flow is choked, and thus the exit Mach number is Ma2 = 1.

The Mach number corresponding to this value of fL*/D at the tube inlet is obtained from Table A-16 to be Ma1 = 0.6107  
0.611. This value is obtained using the analytical relation. An interpolation on Table 16 gives 0.614. Noting that the flow 
in the nozzle section is isentropic, the thermodynamic temperature, pressure, and density at the tube inlet become

Solution 
The thrust developed by the engine of a Boeing 777 is about 380 kN. The mass flow rate of gases through 
the nozzle is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 Air is an ideal gas with constant specific heats. 2 Flow of combustion gases through the nozzle is 
isentropic. 3 Choked flow conditions exist at the nozzle exit. 4 The velocity of gases at the nozzle inlet is negligible. 
Properties 
The gas constant of air is R = 0.287 kPam3/kgK, and it can also be used for combustion gases. The specific 
heat ratio of combustion gases is k = 1.33. 
Analysis 
The velocity at the nozzle exit is the sonic speed, which is determined to be

Discussion 
The combustion gases are mostly nitrogen (due to the 78% of N2 in air), and thus they can be treated as air 
with a good degree of approximation.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
12-117  
Solution 
A stationary temperature probe is inserted into an air duct reads 85C. The actual temperature of air is to be 
determined. 
Assumptions 1 Air is an ideal gas with constant specific heats at room temperature. 2 The stagnation process is isentropic. 
Properties 
The specific heat of air at room temperature is cp = 1.005 kJ/kgK. 
Analysis 
The air that strikes the probe will be brought to a complete stop, and thus it will undergo a stagnation 
process. The thermometer will sense the temperature of this stagnated air, which is the stagnation temperature. The actual 
air temperature is determined from

Eq. (11) relates the stagnation temperature change dT0 to the net heat transferred to the fluid. Eq. (10) relates the velocity 
changes to area changes dA, and the stagnation temperature change dT0 or the heat transferred. 
(a) When Ma < 1 (subsonic flow), the fluid accelerates if the duct converges (dA < 0) or the fluid is heated (dT0 > 0 or 
q > 0).  The fluid decelerates if the duct converges (dA < 0) or the fluid is cooled (dT0 < 0 or q < 0). 
(b) When Ma > 1 (supersonic flow), the fluid accelerates if the duct diverges (dA > 0) or the fluid is cooled (dT0 < 0 or 
q < 0).  The fluid decelerates if the duct converges (dA < 0) or the fluid is heated  (dT0 > 0 or q > 0). 
 
Discussion 
Some of these results are not intuitively obvious, but come about by satisfying the conservation equations.

Solution 
An expression for the speed of sound based on van der Waals equation of state is to be derived. Using this 
relation, the speed of sound in carbon dioxide is to be determined and compared to that obtained by ideal gas behavior.

Discussion 
Note that the ideal gas relation is the simplest equation of state, and it is very accurate for most gases 
encountered in practice. At high pressures and/or low temperatures, however, the gases deviate from ideal gas behavior, and 
it becomes necessary to use more complicated equations of state.

Solution 
Helium gas is accelerated in a nozzle. The pressure and temperature of helium at the location where Ma = 1 
and the ratio of the flow area at this location to the inlet flow area are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 Helium is an ideal gas with constant specific heats. 2 Flow through the nozzle is steady, one-dimensional, 
and isentropic. 
Properties 
The properties of helium are R = 2.0769 kJ/kgK, cp = 5.1926 kJ/kgK, and k = 1.667. 
Analysis 
The properties of the fluid at the location where Ma = 1 are the critical properties, denoted by superscript *. 
We first determine the stagnation temperature and pressure, which remain constant throughout the nozzle since the flow is 
isentropic.

Solution 
Helium gas enters a nozzle with negligible velocity, and is accelerated in a nozzle. The pressure and 
temperature of helium at the location where Ma = 1 and the ratio of the flow area at this location to the inlet flow area are to 
be determined. 
Assumptions 1 Helium is an ideal gas with constant specific heats. 2 Flow through the nozzle is steady, one-dimensional, 
and isentropic. 3 The entrance velocity is negligible. 
Properties 
The properties of helium are R = 2.0769 kJ/kgK, cp = 5.1926 kJ/kgK, and k = 1.667. 
Analysis 
We treat helium as an ideal gas with k = 1.667.  The properties of the fluid at the location where Ma = 1 are 
the critical properties, denoted by superscript *. 
The stagnation temperature and pressure in this case are identical to the inlet temperature and pressure since the 
inlet velocity is negligible. They remain constant throughout the nozzle since the flow is isentropic. 
 
T0 = Ti = 560 K 
 
P0 = Pi = 0.6 MPa 
 The Mach number at the nozzle exit is given to be Ma = 1. Therefore, the properties at 
the nozzle exit are the critical properties determined from

Solution 
Air enters a converging nozzle. The mass flow rate, the exit velocity, the exit Mach number, and the exit 
pressure-stagnation pressure ratio versus the back pressure-stagnation pressure ratio for a specified back pressure range are 
to be calculated and plotted. 
Assumptions 1 Air is an ideal gas with constant specific heats at room temperature. 2 Flow through the nozzle is steady, 
one-dimensional, and isentropic.  
Properties 
The properties of air at room temperature are R = 0.287 kJ/kgK, cp = 1.005 kJ/kgK, and k = 1.4. 
Analysis  
We use EES to tabulate and plot the results. The stagnation properties remain constant throughout the 
nozzle since the flow is isentropic. They are determined from

Nitrogen gas enters a converging nozzle. The properties at the nozzle exit are to be determined.

Solution 
Nitrogen entering a converging-diverging nozzle experiences a normal shock. The pressure, temperature, 
velocity, Mach number, and stagnation pressure downstream of the shock are to be determined. The results are to be 
compared to those of air under the same conditions. 
Assumptions 1 Nitrogen is an ideal gas with constant specific heats. 2 Flow through the nozzle is steady, one-
dimensional, and isentropic. 3 The nozzle is adiabatic. 
Properties 
The properties of nitrogen are R = 0.297 kJ/kgK and k = 1.4. 
Analysis 
The inlet stagnation properties in this case are identical to the inlet properties since the inlet velocity is 
negligible.  Assuming the flow before the shock to be isentropic,

Discussion 
For air at specified conditions k = 1.4 (same as nitrogen) and R = 0.287 kJ/kg·K.  Thus the only quantity 
which will be different in the case of air is the velocity after the normal shock, which happens to be 164.0 m/s.

Solution 
The diffuser of an aircraft is considered. The static pressure rise across the diffuser and the exit area are to 
be determined. 
Assumptions 1 Air is an ideal gas with constant specific heats at room temperature. 2 Flow through the diffuser is steady, 
one-dimensional, and isentropic. 3 The diffuser is adiabatic. 
Properties 
Air properties at room temperature are R = 0.287 kJ/kgK, cp = 1.005 kJ/kg·K, and k = 1.4.

stagnation properties are to be determined. 
Assumptions Both oxygen and nitrogen are ideal gases with constant specific heats at room temperature. 
Properties 
The specific heat ratio and molar mass are k = 1.395 and M = 32 kg/kmol for oxygen, and k = 1.4 and M = 
28 kg/kmol for nitrogen.

Solution 
Helium gas is accelerated in a nozzle. For a specified mass flow rate, the throat and exit areas of the nozzle 
are to be determined for the case of isentropic nozzle. 
Assumptions 1 Helium is an ideal gas with constant specific heats. 2 Flow through the nozzle is steady, one-dimensional, 
and isentropic. 3 The nozzle is adiabatic. 
Properties 
The properties of helium are R = 0.4961 Btu/lbm·R = 2.6809 psia·ft3/lbm·R, cp = 1.25 Btu/lbm·R, and k = 
1.667. 
Analysis 
The inlet stagnation properties in this case are identical to the inlet properties since the inlet velocity is 
negligible,

Solution 
Helium gas is accelerated in a nozzle isentropically. For a specified mass flow rate, the throat and exit areas 
of the nozzle are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 Helium is an ideal gas with constant specific heats. 2 Flow through the nozzle is steady, one-dimensional, 
and isentropic. 3 The nozzle is adiabatic. 
Properties 
The properties of helium are R = 2.0769 kJ/kg.K, cp = 5.1926 kJ/kg.K, and k = 1.667. 
Analysis 
The inlet stagnation properties in this case are identical to the inlet properties since the inlet velocity is 
negligible,

Solution 
The flow velocity of air in a channel is to be measured using a Pitot-static probe, which causes a shock 
wave to occur. For measured values of static pressure before the shock and stagnation pressure and temperature after the 
shock, the flow velocity before the shock is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 Air is an ideal gas with constant specific heats. 2 Flow through the nozzle is steady and one-dimensional. 
Properties 
The specific heat ratio of air at room temperature is k= 1.4. 
Analysis 
The nose of the probe is rounded (instead of being pointed), and thus it will cause a bow shock wave to 
form. Bow shocks are difficult to analyze. But they are normal to the body at the nose, and thus we can approximate them 
as normal shocks in the vicinity of the probe. It is given that the static pressure before the shock is P1 = 110 kPa, and the 
stagnation pressure and temperature after the shock are P02 = 620 kPa, and T02 = 340 K. Noting that the stagnation 
temperature remains constant, we have

Discussion 
The flow velocity after the shock is V2 = V1/2.6667 = 551/2.6667 = 207 m/s. Therefore, the velocity 
measured by a Pitot-static probe would be very different that the flow velocity.

Solution 
Air enters a constant-area adiabatic duct at a specified state, and leaves at a specified pressure. The mass 
flow rate of air, the exit velocity, and the average friction factor are to be determined. 
 
 
 
 
 
Assumptions 1 The assumptions associated with Fanno flow (i.e., steady, frictional flow of an ideal gas with constant 
properties through a constant cross-sectional area adiabatic duct) are valid. 2 The friction factor is constant along the duct.   
Properties 
We take the properties of air to be k = 1.4, cp = 1.005 kJ/kgK, and R = 0.287 kJ/kgK. The  friction factor is 
given to be f = 0.025.  
Analysis 
Noting that the flow in the nozzle section is isentropic, the Mach number, thermodynamic temperature, and 
density at the tube inlet become

Note that it takes a duct length of only 0.218 m for the Mach number to decrease from 2.2 to 1.8. The maximum (or sonic) 
duct lengths at the inlet and exit states in this case are L1

sonic conditions if a 0.443-m long section were added to the existing duct.

Solution 
Choked supersonic airflow in a constant cross-sectional area adiabatic duct is considered. The variation of 
duct length with Mach number is to be investigated, and the results are to be plotted. 
 
Assumptions 1 The assumptions associated with Fanno flow (i.e., steady, frictional flow of an ideal gas with constant 
properties through a constant cross-sectional area adiabatic duct) are valid. 2 The friction factor remains constant along the 
duct. 
Properties 
We take the properties of air to be k = 1.4, cp = 1.005 kJ/kgK, and R = 0.287 kJ/kgK. The average friction 
factor is given to be f = 0.03. 
Analysis 
We use EES to solve the problem. The flow is choked, 
and thus Ma2 =1. Corresponding to the inlet Mach number of Ma1 = 3 
we have, from Table A-16, fL*/Dh = 0.5222, Therefore, the original 
duct length is

Solution 
Air flowing at a subsonic velocity in a duct is accelerated by heating. The highest rate of heat transfer 
without affecting the inlet conditions is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The assumptions associated with Rayleigh flow (i.e., steady one-dimensional flow of an ideal gas with 
constant properties through a constant cross-sectional area duct with negligible frictional effects) are valid.  2 Inlet 
conditions (and thus the mass flow rate) remain constant. 
Properties 
We take the properties of air to be k = 1.4, cp = 1.005 kJ/kgK, and R = 0.287 kJ/kgK.    
Analysis 
Heat transfer will stop when the flow is choked, and thus Ma2 = V2/c2 = 1. The inlet density and stagnation 
temperature are

Solution 
Air flowing at a subsonic velocity in a duct is accelerated by heating. For a specified exit Mach number, the 
heat transfer for a specified exit Mach number as well as the maximum heat transfer are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The assumptions associated with Rayleigh flow (i.e., 
steady one-dimensional flow of an ideal gas with constant properties 
through a constant cross-sectional area duct with negligible frictional 
effects) are valid.  2 Inlet conditions (and thus the mass flow rate) 
remain constant.

We take the properties of air to be k = 1.4, cp = 1.005

Solution 
Combustion gases enter a constant-area adiabatic duct at a specified state, and undergo a normal shock at a 
specified location. The exit velocity, temperature, and pressure are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The assumptions associated with Fanno flow (i.e., steady, 
frictional flow of an ideal gas with constant properties through a constant 
cross-sectional area adiabatic duct) are valid. 2 The friction factor is 
constant along the duct.  
Properties 
The specific heat ratio and gas constant of combustion gases 
are given to be k = 1.33 and R = 0.280 kJ/kgK. The friction factor is given 
to be f = 0.010.  
Analysis 
The Fanno flow functions corresponding to the inlet Mach number of 2 are calculated from the relations in 
Table A-16 for k = 1.33 to be 
Ma1 = 2: 
 
(fL*/Dh)1 = 0.3402 
T1/T*  = 0.7018, P1/P* = 0.4189  
First we check to make sure that the flow everywhere upstream the shock is supersonic. The required duct length from the 
inlet L1

Solution 
Air flowing at a supersonic velocity in a duct is accelerated by cooling. For a specified exit Mach number, 
the rate of heat transfer is to be determined. 
Assumptions The assumptions associated with Rayleigh flow (i.e., 
steady one-dimensional flow of an ideal gas with constant properties 
through a constant cross-sectional area duct with negligible frictional 
effects) are valid.  
Properties 
We take the properties of air to be k = 1.4, cp = 1.005 
kJ/kgK, and R = 0.287 kJ/kgK.

Knowing stagnation properties, the static properties are

Discussion 
The negative sign confirms that the gas needs to be cooled in order to be accelerated. Also, it can be shown 
that the thermodynamic temperature drops to 158 K at the exit, which is extremely low. Therefore, the duct may need to be 
heavily insulated to maintain indicated flow conditions.

Solution 
Choked subsonic airflow in a constant cross-sectional area adiabatic duct is considered. The effect of duct 
length on the mass flow rate and the inlet conditions is to be investigated as the duct length is doubled.  
 
Assumptions 1 The assumptions associated with Fanno flow (i.e., steady, frictional flow of an ideal gas with constant 
properties through a constant cross-sectional area adiabatic duct) are valid. 2 The friction factor remains constant along the 
duct. 
Properties 
We take the properties of air to be k = 1.4, cp = 1.005 kJ/kgK, and R = 0.287 kJ/kgK. The average friction 
factor is given to be f = 0.02. 
Analysis 
We use EES to solve the problem. The flow is choked, and thus Ma2 =1. The inlet Mach number is

Solution 
Using EES (or other) software, the shape of a converging-diverging nozzle is to be determined for specified 
flow rate and stagnation conditions. The nozzle and the Mach number are to be plotted.  
Assumptions 1 Air is an ideal gas with constant specific heats. 2 Flow through the nozzle is steady, one-dimensional, and 
isentropic. 3 The nozzle is adiabatic. 
Properties 
The specific heat ratio of air at room temperature is 1.4.

Solution 
Steam enters a converging nozzle. The exit pressure, the exit velocity, and the mass flow rate versus the 
back pressure for a specified back pressure range are to be plotted. 
 
Assumptions 1 Steam is to be treated as an ideal gas with constant specific heats. 2 Flow through the nozzle is steady, 
one-dimensional, and isentropic. 3 The nozzle is adiabatic. 
Properties 
The ideal gas properties of steam are R = 0.462 kJ/kg.K, cp = 1.872 kJ/kg.K, and k = 1.3. 
Analysis 
We use EES to solve the problem. The stagnation properties in this case are identical to the inlet properties 
since the inlet velocity is negligible. Since the flow is isentropic, they remain constant throughout the nozzle, 
 
P0 = Pi  = 6 MPa         and         T0 = Ti  = 700 K 
The critical pressure is determined to be

(a) The fluid velocity at the throat can never exceed the speed of sound. 
(b) If the fluid velocity at the throat is below the speed of sound, the diversion section will act like a diffuser.  
(c) If the fluid enters the diverging section with a Mach number greater than one, the flow at the nozzle exit will be 
supersonic.  
(d) There will be no flow through the nozzle if the back pressure equals the stagnation pressure.  
(e) The fluid velocity decreases, the entropy increases, and stagnation enthalpy remains constant during flow through a 
normal shock.

Classification, Froude Number, and Wave Speed 
 
 
 
 
 
13-1C  
Solution 
We are to define normal depth and how it is established.  
 
Analysis 
In open channels of constant slope and constant cross-section, the fluid accelerates until the head loss due to 
frictional effects equals the elevation drop. The fluid at this point reaches its terminal velocity, and uniform flow is 
established. The flow remains uniform as long as the slope, cross-section, and the surface roughness of the channel remain 
unchanged. The flow depth in uniform flow is called the normal depth yn, which is an important characteristic parameter 
for open-channel flows. 
 
Discussion 
The normal depth is a fairly strong function of surface roughness. 
 
 
 
 
 
13-2C  
Solution 
We are to discuss how pressure changes along the free surface in open-channel flow.  
 
Analysis 
The free surface coincides with the hydraulic grade line (HGL), and the pressure is constant along the 
free surface. 
 
Discussion 
At a free surface of a liquid, the pressure must be equal to the pressure of the gas above it. 
 
 
 
 
 
13-3C  
Solution 
We are to determine if the slope of the free surface is equal to the slope of the channel bottom.  
 
Analysis 
No in general. The slope of the free surface is not necessarily equal to the slope of the bottom surface even 
during steady fully developed flow. 
 
Discussion 
However, there are situations called uniform flow in which the conditions here are met. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
13-4C  
Solution 
We are to discuss some reasons for nonuniform flow in open channels, and the difference between rapidly 
varied flow and gradually varied flow.  
 
Analysis 
The presence of an obstruction in a channel such as a gate or a change in slope or cross-section causes 
the flow depth to vary, and thus the flow to become varied or nonuniform. The varied flow is called rapidly varied flow 
(RVF) if the flow depth changes markedly over a relatively short distance in the flow direction (such as the flow of water 
past a partially open gate or shortly before a falls), and gradually varied flow (GVF) if the flow depth changes gradually 
over a long distance along the channel. 
 
Discussion 
The equations of GVF are simplified because of the slow changes in the flow direction.

13-3 
13-5C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the driving force in open-channel flow and how flow rate is determined.  
 
Analysis 
Flow in a channel is driven naturally by gravity. Water flow in a river, for example, is driven by the 
elevation difference between the source and the sink. The flow rate in an open channel is established by the dynamic 
balance between gravity and friction. Inertia of the flowing fluid also becomes important in unsteady flow. 
 
Discussion 
In pipe flow, on the other hand, there may be an additional driving force of pressure due to pumps. 
 
 
 
 
 
13-6C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the difference between uniform and nonuniform flow.  
 
Analysis 
The flow in a channel is said to be uniform if the flow depth (and thus the average velocity) remains 
constant. Otherwise, the flow is said to be nonuniform or varied, indicating that the flow depth varies with distance in the 
flow direction. Uniform flow conditions are commonly encountered in practice in long straight sections of channels with 
constant slope and constant cross-section. 
 
Discussion 
In uniform open-channel flow, the head loss due to frictional effects equals the elevation drop. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
13-7C  
Solution 
We are to explain how to determine if a flow is tranquil, critical, or rapid.  
 
Analysis 
Knowing the average flow velocity and flow depth, the Froude number is determined from 
gy
V /
Fr 
. 
Then the flow is classified as 
 
 
Fr < 1 
Subcritical or tranquil flow 
 
Fr = 1 
Critical flow 
 
Fr > 1 
Supercritical or rapid flow 
 
Discussion 
The Froude number is the most important parameter in open-channel flow. 
 
 
 
 
 
13-8C  
Solution 
We are to discuss whether the flow upstream of a hydraulic jump must be supercritical, and whether the flow 
downstream of a hydraulic jump must be subcritical.  
 
Analysis 
Upstream of a hydraulic jump, the upstream flow must be supercritical. Downstream of a hydraulic jump, 
the downstream flow must be subcritical. 
 
Discussion 
Otherwise, the second law of thermodynamics would be violated. Note that a hydraulic jump is analogous to 
a normal shock wave – in that case, the flow upstream must be supersonic and the flow downstream must be subsonic.

13-9C  
Solution 
We are to define critical length, and discuss how it is determined.

from

Discussion 
Critical depth is a useful parameter, even if the depth does not actually equal yc anywhere in the flow. 
 
 
 
 
 
13-10C  
Solution 
We are to define and discuss the usefulness of the Froude number.  
 
Analysis 
Froude number, defined as 
gy
V /
Fr 
, is a dimensionless parameter that governs the character of 
flow in open channels. Here, g is the gravitational acceleration, V is the mean fluid velocity at a cross-section, and Lc is a 
characteristic length (Lc = flow depth y for wide rectangular channels).  Fr represents the ratio of inertia forces to viscous 
forces in open-channel flow. The Froude number is also the ratio of the flow speed to wave speed, Fr = V /co. 
 
Discussion 
The Froude number is the most important parameter in open-channel flow.

Discussion 
Note that wave speed depends on the water depth, and the wave speed increases as the water depth 
increases. Also, the waves eventually die out because of the viscous effects.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
13-12  
Solution 
The flow of water in a wide channel is considered. The speed of a small disturbance in flow for two different 
flow depths is to be determined for both water and oil. 
Assumptions The distance across the wave is short and thus friction at the bottom surface and air drag at the top are 
negligible,

Therefore, a disturbance in the flow will travel at a speed of 0.990 m/s in the first case, and 2.80 m/s in the second case. 
Discussion 
Note that wave speed depends on the water depth, and the wave speed increases as the water depth increases 
as long as the water remains shallow. Results would not change if the fluid were oil, because the wave speed depends only 
on the fluid depth.

We are to compare the specific energy in two flows – one subcritical and one supercritical.  
 
Analysis 
A plot of Es versus y for constant V through a rectangular channel of width b reveals that there are two y 
values corresponding to a fixed value of Es: one for subcritical flow and one for supercritical flow. Therefore, the specific 
energies of water in those two channels can be identical. 
 
Discussion 
If the flow is varied (not uniform), however, Es is not necessarily identical in the two channels. 
 
 
 
 
 
13-21C  
Solution 
We are to define and discuss specific energy.  
 
Analysis 
The specific energy Es of a fluid flowing in an open channel is the sum of the pressure and dynamic heads 
of a fluid, and is expressed as 
g
V

Discussion 
Specific energy is very useful when analyzing varied flows.

Solution 
We are to examine a claim that during steady flow in a wide rectangular channel, the energy line of the flow 
is parallel to the channel bottom when the frictional losses are negligible.  
 
Analysis 
No, the claim is not correct. The energy line is a distance

 (total mechanical energy of the 
fluid) above a horizontal reference datum. When there is no head loss, the energy line is horizontal even when the channel is 
not. The elevation and velocity heads (
y

 and 
g
V

/
2
) may convert to each other during flow in this case, but their sum 
remains constant. 
 
Discussion 
Keep in mind that in real life, there is no such thing as frictionless flow. However, there are situations in 
which the frictional effects are negligible compared to other effects in the flow. 
 
 
 
 
 
13-23C  
Solution 
We are to examine a claim that during steady 1-D flow through a wide rectangular channel, the total 
mechanical energy of the fluid at the free surface is equal to that of the fluid at the channel bottom.  
 
Analysis 
Yes, the claim is correct. During steady one-dimensional flow, the total mechanical energy of a fluid at any 
point of a cross-section is given by 
g

Discussion 
The physical elevation of the point under consideration does not appear in the above equation for H.  
 
 
 
 
 
13-24C  
Solution 
We are to express the total mechanical energy in steady 1-D flow in terms of heads.  
 
Analysis 
The total mechanical energy of a fluid at any point of a cross-section is expressed as 
g

where y is the flow depth, z is the elevation of the channel bottom, and V is the average flow velocity.  It is related to the 
specific energy of the fluid by

H


. 
 
Discussion 
Because of irreversible frictional head losses, H must decrease in the flow direction in open-channel flow. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
13-25C  
Solution 
We are to express the 1-D energy equation for open-channel flow and discuss head loss.

The one-dimensional energy equation for open channel flow between an upstream section 1 and downstream 
section 2 is written as

Discussion 
Head loss is always positive – it can never be negative since this would violate the second law of 
thermodynamics. Thus, the total mechanical energy must decrease downstream in open-channel flow.

13-26C  
Solution 
We are to examine claims about the minimum value of specific energy.  
 
Analysis 
The point of minimum specific energy is the critical point, and thus the first person is correct. 
 
Discussion 
The specific energy cannot go below the critical point for a given volume flow rate, as is clear from the plot 
of specific energy as a function of flow depth. 
 
 
 
 
 
13-27C  
Solution 
We are to examine a claim about supercritical flow of water in an open channel, namely, that the larger the 
flow depth, the larger the specific energy.  
 
Analysis 
No, the claim is incorrect. A plot of Es versus y for constant V reveals that the specific energy decreases 
as the flow depth increases during supercritical channel flow. 
 
Discussion 
This may go against our intuition, since a larger flow depth seems to imply greater energy, but this is not 
necessarily the case (we cannot always trust our intuition). 
 
 
 
 
13-28C  
Solution 
We are to examine a claim that specific energy remains constant in steady uniform flow.  
 
Analysis 
The first person (who claims that specific energy remains constant) is correct since in uniform flow, the 
flow depth and the flow velocity, and thus the specific energy, remain constant since 
g
V
y
Es


. The head loss is 
made up by the decline in elevation (the channel is sloped downward in the flow direction). 
 
Discussion 
In uniform flow, the flow depth and the average velocity do not change downstream, since the elevation 
drop exactly overcomes the frictional losses. 
 
 
 
 
 
13-29C  
Solution 
We are to define and discuss friction slope.  
 
Analysis 
The friction slope is related to head loss hL, and is defined as 
L
h

L
f

 where L is the channel length. 
The friction slope is equal to the bottom slope when the head loss is equal to the elevation drop. That is,

Solving for y2 gives the alternate depth to be y2 = 0.223 m. There are three roots of this equation; one for subcritical, one 
for supercritical and third one as a negative root. Therefore, if the character of flow is changed from supercritical to 
subcritical while holding the specific energy constant, the flow depth will drop from 0.40 m to 0.223 m. 
Discussion 
Two alternate depths show two possible flow conditions for a given specific energy. If the energy is not the 
minimum specific energy, there are two water depths corresponding to subcritical and supercritical states of flow. As an 
example, these two depths may be observed before and after a sluice gate as alternate depths, if the losses are disregarded.

Uniform Flow and Best Hydraulic Cross Sections 
 
 
13-40C  
Solution 
We are to discuss when flow in an open channel is uniform, and how it remains uniform.  
 
Analysis 
Flow in a channel is called uniform flow if the flow depth (and thus the average flow velocity) remains 
constant. The flow remains uniform as long as the slope, cross-section, and the surface roughness of the channel 
remain unchanged. 
 
Discussion 
Uniform flow in open-channel flow is somewhat analogous to fully developed pipe flow in internal flow. 
 
 
 
 
 
13-41C  
Solution 
We are to determine which cross section is better – one with a small or large hydraulic radius.  
 
Analysis 
The best hydraulic cross-section for an open channel is the one with the maximum hydraulic radius, or 
equivalently, the one with the minimum wetted perimeter for a specified cross-sectional area. 
 
Discussion 
Frictional losses occur at the wetted perimeter walls of the channel, so it makes sense to minimize the wetted 
perimeter in order to minimize the frictional losses. 
 
 
 
 
 
13-42C  
Solution 
We are to determine which cross section shape is best for an open channel.  
 
Analysis 
The best hydraulic cross-section for an open channel is a (a) circular one. 
 
Discussion 
Circular channels are often more difficult to construct, however, so they are often not used in practice. 
 
 
 
 
 
13-43C  
Solution 
We are to determine the best hydraulic cross section for a rectangular channel.  
 
Analysis 
The best hydraulic cross section for a rectangular channel is one whose fluid height is (a) half the channel 
width. 
 
Discussion 
It turns out that for this case, the wetted perimeter, and thus the frictional losses, are smallest. 
 
 
 
 
 
13-44C  
Solution 
We are to determine the best hydraulic cross section for a trapezoidal channel.  
 
Analysis 
The best hydraulic cross section for a trapezoidal channel of base width b is (a) one for which the length of 
the side edge of the flow section is b. 
 
Discussion 
It turns out that for this case, the wetted perimeter, and thus the frictional losses, are smallest.

13-45C  
Solution 
We are to examine a claim that head loss can be determined by multiplying bottom slope by channel length.  
 
Analysis 
Yes, the claim is correct. The head loss in uniform flow is 
L
S
hL
0

 since the head loss must equal 
elevation loss. 
 
Discussion 
In uniform flow, frictional head losses are exactly balanced by elevation loss, which is directly proportional 
to bottom slope. 
 
 
 
 
13-46C  
Solution 
We are to discuss how flow depth changes when the bottom slope is increased.  
 
Analysis 
The flow depth decreases when the bottom slope is increased. 
 
Discussion 
You can think of it in simple terms this way: As the slope increases, the liquid flows faster, and faster flow 
requires lower depth. 
 
 
 
 
 
13-47  
Solution 
We are to determine how the flow rate changes when the Manning coefficient doubles.  
 
Analysis 
The flow rate in uniform flow is given as 
2
/
1
0
3
/
2
S
R
A
n
a
h
c

V
, and thus the flow rate is inversely 
proportional to the Manning coefficient. Therefore, if the Manning coefficient doubles as a result of some algae growth on 
surfaces while the flow cross section remains constant, the flow rate will (d) decrease by half.  
 
Discussion 
In an actual case, the cross section may also change due to flow depth changes as well. 
 
 
 
 
 
13-48  
Solution 
Water flows uniformly half-full in a circular finished-concrete channel. For a given bottom slope, the flow 
rate is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and uniform. 2 Bottom slope is constant. 3 Roughness coefficient is constant along the 
channel. 
Properties 
Manning coefficient for an open channel of finished concrete is n = 0.012 (Table 13-1).

Solution 
The flow of water through two identical channels with square flow sections is considered. The percent 
increase in flow rate as a result of combining the two channels while the flow depth remains constant is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and uniform. 2 Bottom slope is 
constant. 3 Roughness coefficient is constant along the channel.  
Analysis 
We denote the flow conditions for two separate 
channels by subscript 1 and the conditions for the combined wide 
channel 
by 
subscript 
2.

Solution

Solution 
Water is flowing through a channel with nonuniform surface properties. The flow rate and the effective 
Manning coefficient are to be determined.  
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and uniform. 2 
The bottom slope is constant. 3 The Manning 
coefficients do not vary along the channel.  
Analysis 
The channel involves two parts 
with different roughness, and thus it is appropriate 
to divide the channel into two subsections. The 
flow rate for each subsection can be determined 
from the Manning equation, and the total flow rate 
can be determined by adding them up. 
The flow area, perimeter, and hydraulic radius for each subsection and the entire channel are:

Discussion 
The effective Manning coefficient neff lies between the two n values as expected. The weighted average of 
the Manning coefficient of the channel is nave=(n1p1+ n2p2)/p = 0.035, which is quite different than neff. Therefore, using a 
weighted average Manning coefficient for the entire channel may be tempting, but it would not be accurate.

Solution 
Water is transported in an asphalt lined open channel at a specified rate. The dimensions of the best cross-
section for various geometric shapes are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and uniform. 2 Bottom slope is constant. 3 Roughness coefficient is constant along the 
channel.  
Properties 
The Manning coefficient for asphalt lined open channels is n = 0.016 
(Table 13-1).    
Analysis 
(a) Circular channel of Diameter D: Best cross-section occurs when 
the channel is half-full, and thus the flow area is D2/8 and the hydraulic radius is

Solution 
Uniform flow in an asphalt-lined rectangular channel is considered. By varying the depth-to-width ratio 
from 0.1 to 2 in increments of 0.1 for a fixed value of flow area, it is the to be shown that the best hydraulic cross section 
occurs when y/b = 0.5, and the results are to be plotted.

Solution 
Water is to be transported in a rectangular channel at a specified rate. The dimensions for the best cross-
section if the channel is made of unfinished and finished concrete are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and uniform. 2 Bottom slope is constant. 3 Roughness coefficient is constant along the 
channel.  
Properties 
The Manning coefficient is n = 0.014 for unfinished concrete (part a) and n = 0.012 for finished conrete 
(part b), respectively (Table 13-1).  In English units, a = 1.486 ft1/3/s. 
Analysis 
For best cross-section of a rectangular cross-section, y = b/2. Then Ac 
= yb = b2/2 and Rh = b/4. The flow rate is determined from the Manning equation,

Gradually and Rapidly Varied Flows and Hydraulic Jump  
 
 
 
13-68C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the differences between GVF and RVF.  
 
Analysis 
Gradually varied flow (GVF) is characterized by gradual variations in flow depth and velocity (small 
slopes and no abrupt changes) and a free surface that always remains smooth (no discontinuities or zigzags). Rapidly 
varied flow (RVF) involves rapid changes in flow depth and velocity. A change in the bottom slope or cross-section of a 
channel or an obstruction on the path of flow may cause the uniform flow in a channel to become gradually or rapidly varied 
flow. Analytical relations for the profile of the free surface can be obtained in GVF, but this is not the case for RVF 
because of the intense agitation. 
 
Discussion 
In many situations, the shape of the free surface must be solved numerically, even for GVF. 
 
 
 
 
 
13-69C  
Solution 
We are to discuss the difference between uniform and nonuniform (varied) flow.  
 
Analysis 
Both uniform and varied flows are steady, and thus neither involves any change with time at a specified 
location. In uniform flow, the flow depth y and the flow velocity V remain constant whereas in nonuniform or varied 
flow, the flow depth and velocity vary in the streamwise direction of the flow. In uniform flow, the slope of the energy 
line is equal to the slope of the bottom surface. Therefore, the friction slope equals the bottom slope, Sf = S0.  In varied 
flow, however, these slopes are different. 
 
Discussion 
Varied flows are further classified into gradually varied flow (GVF) and  rapidly varied flow (RVF). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
13-70C  
Solution 
We are to analyze a claim that wall shear is negligible in RVF but important in GVF.  
 
Analysis 
Yes, we agree with this claim. Rapidly varied flows occur over a short section of the channel with 
relatively small surface area, and thus frictional losses associated with wall shear are negligible compared with losses due to 
intense agitation and turbulence. Losses in GVF, on the other hand, are primarily due to frictional effects along the channel, 
and should be considered. 
 
Discussion 
There is somewhat of an analogy here with internal flows. In long pipe sections with entrance lengths and/or 
gradually changing pipe diameter, wall shear is important. However, in short sections of piping with rapid change of 
diameter or a blockage or turn, etc (minor loss), friction along the wall is typically negligible compared to other losses. 
 
 
 
 
 
13-71C  
Solution 
We are to analyze what happens to flow depth in an upward-sloped rectangular channel during supercritical 
flow.  
 
Analysis 
The flow depth y (a) increases in the flow direction. 
 
Discussion 
Since the flow is supercritical, this increase in flow depth may occur via a hydraulic jump.

13-72C  
Solution 
We are to determine if it is possible for subcritical flow to undergo a hydraulic jump.  
 
Analysis 
No. It is impossible for subcritical flow to undergo a hydraulic jump. Such a process would require the 
head loss hL to become negative, which is impossible. It would correspond to negative entropy generation, which would be a 
violation of the second law of thermodynamics. Therefore, the upstream flow must be supercritical (Fr1 > 1) for a hydraulic 
jump to occur. 
 
Discussion 
This is analogous to normal shock waves in gases – the only way a shock wave can occur is if the flow 
upstream of the shock wave is supersonic with Ma1 > 1 (analogous to supercritical in open-channel flow with Fr1 > 1). 
 
 
 
 
13-73C  
Solution 
We are to define the energy dissipation ratio for a hydraulic jump and discuss why a hydraulic jump is 
sometimes used to dissipate energy.  
 
Analysis 
Hydraulic jumps are often designed in conjunction with stilling basins and spillways of dams in order to 
waste as much of the mechanical energy as possible to minimize the mechanical energy of the fluid and thus its 
potential to cause damage. In such cases, a measure of performance of a hydraulic jump is the energy dissipation ratio, 
which is the fraction of energy dissipated through a hydraulic jump, defined as

the channel and thus the friction coefficient are constant.

bottom slope alone is not sufficient to classify a downhill channel as being mild, critical, or steep.

Water is flowing in an wide brick open channel uniformly. The range of flow depth for which the channel

Therefore, this channel can be classified as steep for uniform flow depths less than yc, i.e., y < 0.03160 m.

they have different roughness and thus different values of n.

This channel at these flow conditions is classified as steep since y < yc, and the flow is supercritical. Alternately, we could 
solve for Froude number and show that Fr > 1 and reach the same conclusion.   The given flow is uniform, and thus y = yn = 
1.95 ft. Therefore, the given value of y = 3 ft during development is between yc and yn, and the flow profile is S2 (Table 
13-3).  
Discussion 
If the flow depth were larger than 5.10 ft, the channel slope would be said to be mild.  Therefore, the bottom 
slope alone is not sufficient to classify a downhill channel as being mild, critical, or steep.

Solution 
Water is flowing in an open channel uniformly. It is to be determined whether the channel slope is mild, 
critical, or steep for this flow. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and uniform. 2 The bottom slope is constant. 3 The roughness of the wetted surface of 
the channel and thus the friction coefficient are constant.    
Properties 
The Manning coefficient for an open channel with finished concrete surfaces is n = 0.012 (Table 13-1).

Discussion 
The results show that the hydraulic jump is a highly dissipative process, wasting 881 kW of power

sluice gate, up to 881 kW of power could be produced.

Solution 
A dam is built downstream of a wide rectangular channel in which water is flowing uniformly. The normal 
and critical flow depths upstream, the flow type, and how far upstream of the dam the reservoir extends are to be 
determined.   
Assumptions 1 The channel is wide. 2 The flow is initially uniform, and becomes gradually varied as the effect of the dam 
is felt. 3 The bottom slope is constant. 4 The roughness of the wetted surface of the channel and thus the friction coefficient 
are constant.    
Properties 
The Manning coefficient of the channel is given to be n = 0.03.   
Analysis 
(a) The channel is said to be wide, and thus the hydraulic radius is equal to the flow depth,

Copying and pasting the mini program above into a blank EES screen gives the water depth at a location of x1 = - 500 m to 
be 2.30 m, which is considerably higher than 1.60 m (5% above the normal depth of 1.52 m). Repeating calculations for 
different x1 values and tabulating, we get

Therefore, the x value corresponding to a flow depth of y = 1.60 m is -3500 m. Finally, the reservoir extends 3500 m 
upstream.  
 
Discussion 
This problem solves the GVF equation in the „backwards‟ direction in order to determine the extent of the 
backwater created by a dam or obstruction. The surface profile is also plotted above using the tabulated values and the plot 
feature of EES. From the dam, looking upstream, the water surface profile is an M1 type. The water depth decreases with 
distance upstream, and the uniform flow depth is steadily approached.

Therefore, 37.6% of the available head (or mechanical energy) of water is wasted (converted to thermal energy) as a result

available head.

Solution 
Gradually varied flow over a bump in a wide channel is considered. The normal and critical flow depths are 
to be calculated and plotted, and the behavior of the free surface is to be investigated.   
Assumptions 1 The channel is wide, and the flow is gradually varied. 2 The bottom slope is constant. 3 The roughness of 
the wetted surface of the channel and thus the friction coefficient are constant.    
Properties 
The Manning coefficient of the channel is n = 0.02 (given).

Normal flow cannot exist for x < 100 m since S0 < 0, and yn   for S0 = 0. Therefore, yn is undefined for x < 100 m, 
infinity for x = 0, and first decreases and then increases for x > 100 m as the slope S0 increases and then decreases. This is 
shown in the figure.

where y = y(x) is the water depth at the specified location x. For given numerical values, this problem can be solved using 
EES as follows: 
 
Vol=0.75 "m^3/s, volume flow rate per unit width, b = 1 m" 
b=1 "m. width of channel" 
n=0.02 "Manning coefficient" 
S_0=0.15*0.002*(x-100)*exp(-0.001*(x-100)^2) "Slope of channel" 
g=9.81 "gravitational acceleration, m/s^2" 
y_c=(Vol^2/(g*b^2))^(1/3) "Critical depth" 
y_n=(Vol*n/(b*ABS(0.15*0.002*(x2-100)*exp(-0.001*(x2-100)^2))^0.5))^(3/5) "Normal depth" 
x1=0; y1=1 "m, initial condition" 
x2=110 "m, length of channel" 
f_xy=(S_0-((Vol/b)^2*n^2/y^(10/3)))/(1-(Vol/b)^2/(g*y^3)) "the GVF equation to be integrated" 
y=y1+integral(f_xy, x, x1, x2) "integral equation, auto step: Press F2 to solve."   
 
Copying and pasting the mini program above into a blank EES screen gives the normal and actual water depth at a location 
of x2 = 110 m to be yn(x2) = 0.47 m and y(x2) =  0.82 m. Repeating calculations for different x2 values and tabulating and

In this problem, the GVF equation for the case of a frictional flow over a Gaussian bump is solved. Note that the local slope 
must be computed at each integration step since the bathymetry is changing continuously and smoothly, 
 
Discussion 
From the subcritical state of our initial flow, we note that we are on an H2 profile at the start. As soon as the 
leading edge of the bump is encountered, this turns into an A2 profile. For this portion of the flow, yn is undefined and Table 
13-3 predicts a decrease in water depth. We note that our knowledge of inviscid flows over bumps (Section 13-9) also 
predicts that subcritical flows will decrease in depth over the leading edge of a bump. The graphical results confirm this. On 
the downstream portion of the bump, yn is real, and we see that we are briefly on an M1 profile, with increasing water depth. 
Finally, once the channel bottom again becomes horizontal,  yn   and we are on an M2 profile with very slightly 
decreasing water depth. Downstream of the bump, the flow depth continues to decrease on an H2 profile. If friction had 
been omitted, the water surface would return to the initial elevation.

Gradually varied flow of water in a wide rectangular channel with a break in channel slope is considered. 
The normal and critical flow depths in the two segments are to be determined, and the water surface profile is to be plotted

Discussion 
This problem deals with the GVF equation for the case where there is a break in channel slope. The flow 
behavior depends strongly upon the initial depth. The calculated results agree with our understanding of flow behavior as 
illustrated in Table 13-3. For the initial water depth of 1.25 m, we are on an S2 profile and the flow depth will decrease 
towards the normal depth of the first channel segment. At the change in slope, the normal depth changes, but the critical 
depth does not. The water surface profile will remain on an S2 curve, and the flow depth will continue to decrease as the 
new normal depth is approached.

Solution 
Gradually varied flow of water in a wide rectangular channel with a break in channel slope is considered. 
The normal and critical flow depths in the two segments are to be determined, and the water surface profile is to be plotted 
and classified.   
Assumptions 1 The channel is wide, and the flow is gradually varied. 2 The bottom slope is constant in each of the two 
segments. 3 The roughness of the wetted surface of the channel and thus the friction coefficient are constant.    
Properties 
The Manning coefficient of the channel is given to be n = 0.02.   
Analysis 
(a) The channel is said to be wide, and thus the hydraulic radius is equal to the flow depth, 
y

. 
Knowing the flow rate per unit width (b = 1 m), the normal depth is determined from the Manning equation to be

Solution 
A hydraulic jump that occurs in a wide rectangular channel is considered. The critical flow depth is to be 
determined, and it is to be verifed that the initial and final flows are supercritical and subcritical, respectively, and the 
location of the jump is to be predicted. 
In this problem, the GVF equation is solved for the case of a hydraulic jump in a horizontal channel. The inlet and 
outlet depths are specified, and we are to predict where the hydraulic jump will occur. 
Assumptions 1 The channel is wide, and the flow is gradually varied upstream and downstream of the jump. 2 The 
hydraulic jump has zero streamwise length, i.e. it is a discontinuity. 3 The roughness of the wetted surface of the channel 
and thus the friction coefficient are constant.    
Properties 
The Manning coefficient of the channel is given to be n = 0.009.

Thus, we see that our initial flow is indeed supercritical and our final flow is subcritical.  
 
(b) Now we try several jump locations, for example, at x = 0.75 m. In each case, we integrate the GVF equation from the 
head gate to the jump location and determine the flow depth y1 before the jump, calculate the inflow Froude number of the

the calculated flow depth y3 at x = 3 m to the measured value of 0.08 m. As summarized in the table and figure below, the

Thus, the location of the hydraulic jump is at 1.80 m. 
 
Discussion 
In all cases, the water depth initially increases on an H3 profile. After the jump, the subcritical flow is 
characterized by (very slightly) decreasing water depth on an H2 profile. As the jump is positioned closer to the sluice gate, 
the stronger subcritical flow leads to greater depth ratios across the jump. Alternatively, raising the tailgate will have the 
effect of pushing the jump closer to the head gate.

Solution 
Gradually varied flow of water in a wide rectangular channel is considered. It is to be shown that the slope 
of the surface is a function of S0, y, yn, and yc alone.    
Assumptions 1 The channel is wide, and the flow is gradually varied. 2 The bottom slope is constant. 3 The roughness of 
the wetted surface of the channel and thus the friction coefficient are constant.    
Analysis 
The channel is said to be wide, and thus the hydraulic radius is equal to flow depth, 
y
Rh 
. First we 
consider the numerator S0 – Sf. Here S0 is the actual channel slope and would produce a uniform flow depth of yn. The 
friction slope Sf, on the other hand, is the slope that would produce uniform flow at the actual flow depth y. Noting that Rh is 
equivalent to flow depth for a wide rectangular channel, yhe Manning equation simplifies to

Discussion 
This problem simplifies the GVF equation for the special case of a wide rectangular channel. The simplified 
equation makes explicit the importance of the relationship between y, yn, and yc in terms of determining the behavior of the 
flow. From this modified GVF equation, we now see the explicit relationship between y, yn, and yc. The relative magnitudes 
of these terms determine the signs of the numerator and denominator in Eq. 13-65 and therefore the overall sign of dy/dx as 
discussed in Table 13-3.

Solution 
Gradually varied flow of water in a wide rectangular channel is considered. The classification the flow type 
and the flow depths at specified locations are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The channel is wide, and the flow is gradually varied. 2 The bottom slope is constant. 3 The roughness of 
the wetted surface of the channel and thus the friction coefficient are constant.    
Properties 
The Manning coefficient of the channel is given to be n = 0.008.   
Analysis 
The channel is said to be wide, and thus the hydraulic radius is equal to the flow depth,

where y = y(x) is the water depth at the specified location x. For given numerical values, this problem can be solved using 
EES as follows: 
 
Vol=300 "ft^3/s, volume flow rate" 
b=20 "ft. width of channel" 
n=0.02 "Manning coefficient" 
a=1.486 
S_0=0.01 "Slope of channel" 
g=32.2 "gravittational acceleration, ft/s^2" 
Vel1=5.2 "ft/s" 
 
y_c=(Vol^2/(g*b^2))^(1/3) "Critical depth" 
y_n=(Vol*n/(a*b*S_0^0.5))^(3/5) "Normal depth" 
 
x1=0; y1=Vol/(Vel1*b) "ft, initial condition" 
x2=500 "ft, lenght of channel" 
 
f_xy=(S_0-((Vol/b)^2*n^2/a^2/y^(10/3)))/(1-(Vol/b)^2/(g*y^3)) "the GVF equation to be integrated" 
y=y1+integral(f_xy, x, x1, x2) "integral equation, auto step: Press F2 to solve."   
 
Copying and pasting the mini program above into a blank EES screen gives the water depth at a location of 500 ft to be 
 
y(x2) = y(500 ft) = 8.13 ft 
 
(b), (c) Similarly, the flow depths at x = 1000 ft and x = 2000 ft are determined to be 
y(x3) = y(1000 ft) = 13.2 ft 
y(x4) = y(2000 ft) = 23.2 ft 
 
Discussion 
The above results confirm the quantitative prediction from Table 13-3 that an M1 profile should yield 
increasing water depth in the downstream direction.

Solution 
Gradually varied flow of water in a wide rectangular irrigation channel with a rough flow section is 
considered. The normal and critical flow depths in both smooth and rough segments are to be determined, and the water 
surface profile is to be plotted.   
Assumptions 1 The channel is wide, and the flow is gradually varied. 2 The bottom slope is constant. 3 The roughness of 
the wetted surface of the channel and thus the friction coefficient in each segment are constant.    
Properties 
The Manning coefficient of the channel is given to be n = 0.02 in the smooth section, and 0.03 in the rough 
section.   
Analysis 
(a) The channel is said to be wide, and thus the hydraulic radius is equal to the flow depth,

Knowing the flow rate per unit width (b = 1 m), the normal depth is determined from the Manning equation to be

Discussion 
The graphical result shows that the flow is supercritical over the entire domain. Upon beginning the rough 
section of channel, the normal depth jumps upward and the water surface climbs toward this new value on an S3 curve. 
Upon returning to smoother conditions, the water surface descends on an S2 curve toward the original normal depth.

Flow Control and Measurement in Channels 
 
 
 
13-96C  
Solution 
We are to define and classify sharp-crested weirs.  
 
Analysis 
A sharp-crested weir is a vertical plate placed in a channel that forces the fluid to flow through an 
opening to measure the flow rate. They are characterized by the shape of the opening. For example, a weir with a 
triangular opening is referred to as a triangular weir. 
 
Discussion 
Similar to the broad-crested weir, this type of flow measurement is quite obtrusive, but requires no special 
measuring equipment or probes. 
 
 
 
 
 
13-97C  
Solution 
We are to discuss how flow rate is measured with a broad-crested weir.  
 
Analysis 
The operation of broad crested weir is based on blocking the flow in the channel with a rectangular 
block, and establishing critical flow over the block. Then the flow rate is determined by measuring flow depths. 
 
Discussion 
This technique is quite obtrusive, but requires no special measuring equipment or probes. 
 
 
 
 
 
13-98C  
Solution 
We are to define the discharge coefficient for sluice gates, and discuss some typical values.  
 
Analysis 
For sluice gates, the discharge coefficient Cd is defined as the ratio of the actual velocity through the gate 
to the maximum velocity as determined by the Bernoulli equation for the idealized frictionless flow case. For ideal flow,  
Cd  = 1. Typical values of Cd for sluice gates with free outflow are in the range of 0.55 to 0.60. 
 
Discussion 
Actual values of the discharge coefficient must be less than one or else the second law would be violated. 
 
 
 
 
 
13-99C  
Solution 
We are to analyze whether the free surface of flow over a bump will increase, decrease, or remain constant.  
 
Analysis 
In the case of subcritical flow, the flow depth y will decrease during flow over the bump. 
 
Discussion 
This may be contrary to our intuition at first, but if we think in terms of increasing velocity and decreasing 
pressure over the bump (a Bernoulli type of analysis), it makes sense that the surface will decrease over the bump.

13-61
13-100C  
Solution 
We are to analyze what happens in subcritical flow over a bump when the bump height increases.  
 
Analysis 
When the specific energy reaches its minimum value, the flow is critical, and the flow at this point is said 
to be choked. If the bump height is increased even further, the flow remains critical and thus choked. The flow will not 
become supercritical. 
 
Discussion 
This is somewhat analogous to compressible flow in a converging nozzle – the flow cannot become 
supersonic at the nozzle exit unless there is a diverging section of the nozzle downstream of the throat. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
13-101C  
Solution 
We are to draw a flow depth-specific 
energy diagram for several types of flow.  
 
Analysis 
On the figure, diagram 1-2a is for 
frictionless gate, 1-2b is for sluice gate with free 
outflow, and 1-2b-2c is for sluice gate with drown 
outflow, including the hydraulic jump back to 
subcritical flow.  
 
Discussion 
A plot of flow depth as a function of 
specific energy, as shown here, is quite useful in the 
analysis of varied open-channel flow because the 
states upstream and downstream of a change must 
jump between the two branches.

Solution 
The flow of water in a wide channel with a bump is considered. The flow rate of water without the bump and 
the effect of the bump on the flow rate for the case of a flat surface are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and uniform. 2 Bottom slope is 
constant. 3 Roughness coefficient is constant along the channel. 4 The 
channel is sufficiently wide so that the end effects are negligible. 5 
Frictional effects during flow over the bump are negligible.  
Properties 
Manning coefficient for an open channel of unfinished 
concrete is n = 0.014 (Table 13-1).    
Analysis 
For a wide channel, the hydraulic radius is equal to the 
flow depth, and thus Rh = 2 m. Then the flow rate before the bump per m 
width (i.e., b = 1 m) can be determined from Manning‟s equation to be

Solution 
Water flowing in a horizontal open channel 
encounters a bump. It will be determined if the flow over the bump is 
choked. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 Frictional effects are 
negligible so that there is no dissipation of mechanical energy. 3 The 
channel is sufficiently wide so that the end effects are negligible.

We have an interesting situation: The calculations show that Es2 < Ec. That is, the specific energy of the fluid decreases 
below the level of energy at the critical point, which is the minimum energy, and this is impossible. Therefore, the flow at 
specified conditions cannot exist. The flow is choked when the specific energy drops to the minimum value of 1.46 m, 
which occurs at a bump-height of

Discussion 
A bump-height over 6 cm results in a reduction in the flow rate of water, or a rise of upstream water level. 
Therefore, a 22-cm high bump alters the upstream flow. On the other hand, a bump less than 6 cm high will not affect the 
upstream flow.

over the surface relative to the upstream water surface. The specific energy decreases over the bump from, 4.06 to 3.76 m, 
but it is still over the minimum value of 2.42 m. Therefore, the flow over the bump is still supercritical. 
Discussion 
The actual value of surface rise may be different than 4.6 cm because of frictional effects that are neglected 
in this simplified analysis.

The flow rate in an open channel is to be measured using a sharp-crested rectangular weir. For specified

Solution 
Water flowing over a sharp-crested rectangular weir is discharged into a channel where uniform flow 
conditions are established. The maximum slope of the downstream channel to avoid hydraulic jump is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The upstream velocity head is negligible. 
3 The channel is sufficiently wide so that the end effects are negligible.

For a bottom slope smaller than calculated value, downstream channel would have a mild slope, that will 
force the flow to remain subcritical.

Solution 
Water is released from a reservoir through a sluice gate with free outflow. For specified flow depths, the 
flow rate per unit width and the downstream Froude number are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady or quasi-steady. 2 The channel is

Analysis 
For free outflow, we only need the depth ratio y1/a to 
determine the discharge coefficient (for drowned outflow, we also need to 
know y2/a and thus the flow depth y2 downstream the gate)

Solution 
Water discharged through a sluice gate undergoes a hydraulic jump. The flow depth and velocities before 
and after the jump and the fraction of mechanical energy dissipated are to be determined.

sufficiently wide so that the end effects are negligible. 3 
Frictional effects associated with sluice gate are 
negligible.  4 The channel is horizontal.

Solution 
The notch angle of a sharp-crested triangular weir used to measure the discharge rate of water from a lake is 
reduced by half. The percent reduction in the discharge rate is to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady or quasi-steady. 2 The channel is 
sufficiently wide so that the end effects are negligible. 3 The water depth in the 
lake and the weir discharge coefficient remain unchanged.

with large notch angles can be used to measure for large discharge rates.

Solution 
Uniform subcritical water flow of water in a wide channel with a bump is considered. For critical flow over 
the bump, the flow rate of water and the flow depth over the bump are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and uniform. 2 Bottom slope is constant. 3 Roughness coefficient is constant along the 
channel. 4 The channel is sufficiently wide so that the end effects are negligible. 5 Frictional effects during flow over the 
bump are negligible.  
Properties 
Manning coefficient for an open channel of unfinished 
concrete is n = 0.014 (Table 13-1).    
Analysis 
Let subscript 1 denote the upstream conditions (uniform 
flow) in the channel, and 2 denote the critical conditions over the bump. 
For a wide channel, the hydraulic radius is equal to the flow depth, and 
thus Rh = y1. Then the flow rate per m width (i.e., b = 1 m) can be 
determined from Manning‟s equation,

Solution 
The flow rate in an open channel is measured using a broad-crested rectangular weir. For a measured value 
of minimum flow depth over the weir, the flow rate and the upstream flow depth are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The upstream velocity head is negligible. 3 The channel is sufficiently wide so that 
the end effects are negligible.    
Analysis 
The flow depth over the reaches its minimum value when the flow becomes critical. Therefore, the measured 
minimum depth is the critical depth yc. Then the flow rate is determined from the critical depth relation to be

Solution 
A sluice gate is used to control the flow rate of water in 
a channel. For specified flow depths upstream and downstream from the 
gate, the flow rate of water and the downstream Froude number are to 
be determined.  
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The channel is sufficiently wide 
so that the end effects are negligible. 3 Frictional effects associated with 
sluice gate are negligible.  4 The channel is horizontal. 
Analysis 
When frictional effects are negligible and the flow 
section is horizontal, the specific energy remains constant,

Solution 
Water flows in a canal at a specified average velocity. For various flow depths, it is to be determined 
whether the flow is subcritical or supercritical. 
 
Assumptions The flow is uniform.

Discussion 
Note that a flow is more likely to exist as supercritical when the flow depth is low and thus the flow velocity 
is high. Also, the type of flow can be determined easily by checking Froude number.

Solution 
The previous problem is reconsidered. By varying the flow depth-to-radius ratio from 0.1 to 1.9 for a fixed 
value of flow area, it is the to be shown that the best hydraulic cross section occurs when the circular channel is half-full, 
and the results are to be plotted.

Solution 
The flow of water through a parabolic notch is considered. A relation is to be developed for the flow rate, 
and its numerical value is to be calculated. 
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 All frictional 
effects are negligible, and Toricelli‟s equation can be used 
for the velocity.     
Analysis 
The notch is parabolic with y = 0 at x = 0, 
and thus it can be expressed analytically as

Using the coordinates of the upper right corner, the value

Solution 
Water is flowing through a channel with nonuniform surface properties. The flow rate through the channel 
and the effective Manning coefficient are to be determined.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and 
uniform. 2 The bottom slope is constant. 
3 The Manning coefficients do not vary 
along the channel.  
Analysis 
The channel involves 
two parts with different roughness, and 
thus it is appropriate to divide the 
channel into two subsections. The flow 
rate 
for each subsection can be 
determined from the Manning equation, 
and the total flow rate can be 
determined by adding them up.  
The flow area, perimeter, and hydraulic radius for each subsection and the entire channel are:

Discussion 
The effective Manning coefficient neff of the channel turns out to lie between the two n values, as expected. 
The weighted average of the Manning coefficient of the channel is nave=(n1p1+ n2p2)/p = 0.056, which is quite different than 
neff. Therefore, using a weighted average Manning coefficient for the entire channel may be tempting, but it would not be so 
accurate.

Solution 
Two identical channels, one rectangular of bottom width b and one circular of diameter D, with identical 
flow rates, bottom slopes, and surface linings are considered. The relation between b  and D is to be determined for the case 
of the flow height y = b and the circular channel is flowing half full. 
  
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and uniform. 2 Bottom slope is constant. 3 Roughness coefficient is constant along the 
channel.

Solution 
The flow of water through a V-shaped open channel is considered. The angle  the channel makes from 
the horizontal is to be determined for the case of most efficient flow. 
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and uniform. 2 The bottom slope is constant. 3 The roughness coefficient is constant.

Solution 
The flow rate in an open channel is to be measured using a sharp-crested rectangular weir. For a measured 
value of flow depth upstream, the flow rate is to be determined. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The upstream velocity head is negligible. 3 The channel is sufficiently wide so that 
the end effects are negligible.

The weir head is given to be H = 0.60 m. The discharge coefficient of the weir is

This is 2.3% of the weir head, which is negligible. When the upstream velocity head is considered, the flow rate becomes 
5.50 m3/s, which is about 3 percent higher than the value determined above. Therefore, the assumption of negligible velocity 
head is reasonable in this case.

Solution 
Water is to be transported in a rectangular channel at a specified rate. The dimensions for the best cross-
section if the channel is made of unfinished concrete are to be determined. 
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and uniform. 2 The bottom slope is constant. 3 The roughness coefficient is constant.  
Properties 
The Manning coefficient is n = 0.014 for channels made of unfinished concrete (Table 13-1).    
Analysis 
For best cross-section of a rectangular cross-section, y = b/2. Then Ac = yb = b2/2, and Rh = b/4. 
The flow rate is determined from the Manning equation,

Solution 
Water is to be transported in a trapezoidal channel at a specified rate. The dimensions for the best cross-
section if the channel is made of unfinished concrete are to be determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and uniform. 2 Bottom slope is constant. 3 Roughness coefficient is constant along the 
channel.  
Properties 
The Manning coefficient is n = 0.014 for channels made of unfinished concrete (Table 13-1).

Solution 
The flow rates in two open channels are to be measured using a sharp-crested weir in one and a broad-
crested rectangular weir in the other. For identical flow depths, the flow rates through both channels are to be determined. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The upstream velocity head is negligible. 3 The channel is sufficiently wide so that 
the end effects are negligible.

Discussion 
Note that the flow rate in the channel with the broad-crested weir is much less than the channel with the 
sharp-crested weir. Also, if the upstream velocity is taken into consideration, the flow rate would be 155 ft3/s (4% 
difference) for the channel with the sharp-crested weir, and 66.6 ft3/s (0.9% difference) for the one with broad-crested weir. 
Therefore, the assumption of negligible dynamic head is not quite appropriate for the channel with the sharp-crested weir.

Solution 
A sluice gate with free outflow is used to control the flow rate of water. For specified flow depths, the 
flow rate per unit width and the downstream flow depth and velocity are to be determined. 
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady or quasi-steady. 2 The channel is 
sufficiently wide so that the end effects are negligible.    
Analysis 
For free outflow, we only need the depth ratio y1/a to 
determine the discharge coefficient (for drowned outflow, we also need to 
know y2/a and thus the flow depth y2 downstream the gate),

Solution 
Water from a lake is discharged through a sluice gate into a channel where uniform flow conditions are 
established, and then undergoes a hydraulic jump. The flow depth, velocity, and Froude number after the jump are to be 
determined. 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The channel is 
sufficiently wide so that the end effects are negligible. 3 
The effects of channel slope on hydraulic jump are 
negligible.  
Properties  
The Manning coefficient for an open 
channel made of finished concrete is n = 0.012 (Table 13-
1).    
Analysis 
For free outflow, we only need the depth 
ratio y1/a to determine the discharge coefficient,

For wide channels, hydraulic radius is the flow depth and thus Rh = y2. Then the flow depth in uniform flow after the gate is

Solution 
Water is discharged from a dam into a wide spillway to reduce the risk of flooding by dissipating a large 
fraction of mechanical energy via hydraulic jump. For specified flow depths, the velocities before and after the jump, and 
the mechanical power dissipated per meter with of the spillway are to be determined. 
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady or quasi-steady. 2 The channel is sufficiently wide so that the end effects are negligible.  
Properties 
The density of water is 1000 kg/m3.

General Problems 
 
 
14-1C 
Solution 
We are to list examples of fans, blowers, and compressors. 
 
Analysis 
Common examples of fans are window fans, ceiling fans, fans in computers and other electronics 
equipment, radiator fans in cars, etc. Common examples of blowers are leaf blowers, hair dryers, air blowers in 
furnaces and automobile ventilation systems. Common examples of compressors are tire pumps, refrigerator and air 
conditioner compressors. 
 
Discussion 
Students should come up with a diverse variety of examples. 
 
 
 
 
 
14-2C 
Solution 
We are to discuss the differences between fans, blowers, and compressors. 
 
Analysis 
A fan is a gas pump with relatively low pressure rise and high flow rate. A blower is a gas pump with 
relatively moderate to high pressure rise and moderate to high flow rate. A compressor is a gas pump designed to 
deliver a very high pressure rise, typically at low to moderate flow rates. 
 
Discussion 
The boundaries between these three types of pump are not always clearly defined. 
 
 
 
 
14-3C 
Solution 
We are to discuss energy producing and energy absorbing devices.  
 
Analysis 
A more common term for an energy producing turbomachine is a turbine. Turbines extract energy from 
the moving fluid, and convert that energy into useful mechanical energy in the surroundings, usually in the form of a 
rotating shaft. Thus, the phrase “energy producing” is from a frame of reference of the fluid – the fluid loses energy as it 
drives the turbine, producing energy to the surroundings. On the other hand, a more common term for an energy absorbing 
turbomachine is a pump. Pumps absorb mechanical energy from the surroundings, usually in the form of a rotating 
shaft, and increase the energy of the moving fluid. Thus, the phrase “energy absorbing” is from a frame of reference of 
the fluid – the fluid gains or absorbs energy as it flows through the pump. 
 
Discussion 
From the frame of reference of the surroundings, a pump absorbs energy from the surroundings, while a 
turbine produces energy to the surroundings. Thus, you may argue that the terminology also holds for the frame of 
reference of the surroundings. This alternative explanation is also acceptable. 
 
 
 
 
 
14-4C 
Solution 
We are to discuss the difference between a positive-displacement turbomachine and a dynamic 
turbomachine. 
 
Analysis 
A positive-displacement turbomachine is a device that contains a closed volume; energy is transferred 
to the fluid (pump) or from the fluid (turbine) via movement of the boundaries of the closed volume. On the other 
hand, a dynamic turbomachine has no closed volume; instead, energy is transferred to the fluid (pump) or from the 
fluid (turbine) via rotating blades. Examples of positive-displacement pumps include well pumps, hearts, some 
aquarium pumps, and pumps designed to release precise volumes of medicine. Examples of positive-displacement 
turbines include water meters and gas meters in the home. Examples of dynamic pumps include fans, centrifugal 
blowers, airplane propellers, centrifugal water pumps (like in a car engine), etc. Examples of dynamic turbines include 
windmills, wind turbines, turbine flow meters, etc. 
 
Discussion 
Students should come up with a diverse variety of examples.

Solution 
We are to explain the “extra” term in the Bernoulli equation in a rotating reference frame. 
 
Analysis 
A rotating reference frame is not an inertial reference frame. When we move outward in the radial direction, 
the absolute velocity at this location is faster due to the rotating body, since v is equal to r. When solving a 
turbomachinery problem in a rotating reference frame, we use the relative fluid velocity (velocity relative to the rotating 
reference frame). Thus, in order for the Bernoulli equation to be physically correct, we must subtract the absolute 
velocity of the rotating body so that the equation applies to an inertial reference frame. This accounts for the “extra” 
term. 
 
Discussion 
The Bernoulli equation is the same physical equation in either the absolute or the rotating reference frame, 
but it is more convenient to use the form with the extra term in turbomachinery applications. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
14-6C 
Solution 
We are to discuss the difference between brake horsepower and water horsepower, and then discuss turbine 
efficiency. 
 
Analysis 
In turbomachinery terminology, brake horsepower is the power actually delivered by the turbine to the 
shaft. (One may also call it “shaft power”.) On the other hand, water horsepower is the power extracted from the water 
flowing through the turbine. Water horsepower is always greater than brake horsepower; because of inefficiencies; hence 
turbine efficiency is defined as the ratio of brake horsepower to water horsepower. 
 
Discussion 
For a pump, efficiency is defined in the opposite way, since brake horsepower is greater than water 
horsepower. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
14-7C 
Solution 
We are to discuss the difference between brake horsepower and water horsepower, and then discuss pump 
efficiency. 
 
Analysis 
In turbomachinery terminology, brake horsepower is the power actually delivered to the pump through 
the shaft. (One may also call it “shaft power”.) On the other hand, water horsepower is the useful portion of the brake 
horsepower that is actually delivered to the fluid. Water horsepower is always less than brake horsepower; hence pump 
efficiency is defined as the ratio of water horsepower to brake horsepower. 
 
Discussion 
For a turbine, efficiency is defined in the opposite way, since brake horsepower is less than water 
horsepower.

Solution 
For an air compressor with equal inlet and outlet areas, and with both density and pressure increasing, we 
are to determine how the average speed at the outlet compares to the average speed at the inlet.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady.  
 
Analysis 
Conservation of mass requires that the mass flow rate in equals the mass flow rate out. The cross-sectional 
areas of the inlet and outlet are the same. Thus,

Discussion 
A compressor does not necessarily increase the speed of the fluid passing through it. In fact, the average 
speed through the pump can actually decrease, as it does here.

Solution 
We are to determine how the average speed at the outlet compares to the average speed at the inlet of a 
water pump.

through the pump can actually decrease, as it does here in part (c).

Pumps 
 
 
 
 
14-10C 
Solution 
We are to define and discuss NPSH and NPSHrequired.

Net positive suction head (NPSH) is defined as the difference between the pump’s inlet stagnation 
pressure head and the vapor pressure head,

We may think of NPSH as the actual or available net positive suction head. On the other hand, required net positive suction 
head (NPSHrequired) is defined as the minimum NPSH necessary to avoid cavitation in the pump. As long as the actual 
NPSH is greater than NPSHrequired, there should be no cavitation in the pump. 
 
Discussion 
Although NPSH and NPSHrequired are measured at the pump inlet, cavitation (if present) happens somewhere 
inside the pump, typically on the suction surface of the rotating pump impeller blades. 
 
 
 
 
 
14-11C 
Solution 
  
(a) False: Actually, backward-inclined blades yield the highest efficiency. 
(b) True: The pressure rise is higher, but at the cost of less efficiency. 
(c) True: In fact, this is the primary reason for choosing forward-inclined blades. 
(d) False: Actually, the opposite is true – a pump with forward-inclined blades usually has more blades, but they are 
usually smaller. 
 
 
 
 
14-12C 
Solution 
We are to choose which pump location is better and explain why. 
 
Analysis 
The two systems are identical except for the location of the pump (and some minor differences in pipe 
layout). The overall length of pipe, number of elbows, elevation difference between the two reservoir free surfaces, etc. are 
the same. Option (a) is better because it has the pump at a lower elevation, increasing the net positive suction head, 
and lowering the possibility of pump cavitation. In addition, the length of pipe from the lower reservoir to the pump inlet 
is smaller in Option (a), and there is one less elbow between the lower reservoir and the pump inlet, thereby decreasing the 
head loss upstream of the pump – both of which also increase NPSH, and reduce the likelihood of cavitation. 
 
Discussion 
Another point is that if the pump is not self-priming, Option (b) may run into start-up problems if the free 
surface of the lower reservoir falls below the elevation of the pump inlet. Since the pump in Option (a) is below the 
reservoir, self-priming is not an issue. 
 
 
 
 
14-13C 
Solution 
We are to list and define the three categories of dynamic pumps. 
 
Analysis 
The three categories are: Centrifugal flow pump – fluid enters axially (in the same direction as the axis of 
the rotating shaft) in the center of the pump, but is discharged radially (or tangentially) along the outer radius of the pump 
casing. Axial-flow pump – fluid enters and leaves axially, typically only along the outer portion of the pump because of 
blockage by the shaft, motor, hub, etc. Mixed-flow pump – intermediate between centrifugal and axial, with the flow 
entering axially, not necessarily in the center, but leaving at some angle between radially and axially. 
 
Discussion 
There are also some non-rotary dynamic pumps, such as jet pumps and electromagnetic pumps, that are not 
discussed in this text.

14-14C 
Solution 
  
(a) True: As volume flow rate increases, not only does NPSHrequired increase, but the available NPSH decreases, increasing 
the likelihood that NPSH will drop below NPSHrequired and cause cavitation to occur. 
(b) False: NPSHrequired is not a function of water temperature, although available NPSH does depend on water temperature. 
(c) False: Available NPSH actually decreases with increasing water temperature, making cavitation more likely to occur. 
(d) False: Actually, warmer water causes cavitation to be more likely. The best way to think about this is that warmer 
water is already closer to its boiling point, so cavitation is more likely to happen in warm water than in cold water. 
 
 
 
 
14-15C 
Solution 
We are to discuss ways to improve the cavitation performance of a pump, based on the equation for NPSH.

(1) 
To avoid cavitation, NPSH must be increased as much as possible. For a given liquid at a given temperature, the vapor 
pressure head (last term on the right side of Eq. 1) is constant. Hence, the only way to increase NPSH is to increase the 
stagnation pressure head at the pump inlet. We list several ways to increase the available NPSH: (1) Lower the pump or 
raise the inlet reservoir level. (2) Use a larger diameter pipe upstream of the pump. (3) Re-route the piping system 
such that fewer minor losses (elbows, valves, etc.) are encountered upstream of the pump. (4) Shorten the length of 
pipe upstream of the pump. (5) Use a smoother pipe. (6) Use elbows, valves, inlets, etc. that have smaller minor loss 
coefficients. Suggestion (1) raises NPSH by increasing the hydrostatic component of pressure at the pump inlet. 
Suggestions (2) through (6) raise NPSH by lowering the irreversible head losses, thereby increasing the pressure at the 
pump inlet. 
 
Discussion 
By definition, when the available NPSH falls below the required NPSH, the pump is prone to cavitation, 
which should be avoided if at all possible. 
 
 
 
 
 
14-16C 
Solution 
  
(a) True: The maximum volume flow rate occurs when the net head is zero, and this “free delivery” flow rate is typically 
much higher than that at the BEP. 
(b) True: By definition, there is no flow rate at the shutoff head. Thus the pump is not doing any useful work, and the 
efficiency must be zero. 
(c) False: Actually, the net head is typically greatest near the shutoff head, at zero volume flow rate, not near the BEP. 
(d) True: By definition, there is no head at the pump’s free delivery. Thus, the pump is working against no “resistance”, 
and is therefore not doing any useful work, and the efficiency must be zero. 
 
 
 
 
14-17C 
Solution 
We are to explain why dissimilar pumps should not be arranged in series or in parallel. 
 
Analysis 
Arranging dissimilar pumps in series can create problems because the volume flow rate through each 
pump must be the same, but the overall pressure rise is equal to the pressure rise of one pump plus that of the other. 
If the pumps have widely different performance curves, the smaller pump may be forced to operate beyond its free delivery 
flow rate, whereupon it acts like a head loss, reducing the total volume flow rate. Arranging dissimilar pumps in parallel 
can create problems because the overall pressure rise must be the same, but the net volume flow rate is the sum of 
that through each branch. If the pumps are not sized properly, the smaller pump may not be able to handle the large head 
imposed on it, and the flow in its branch could actually be reversed; this would inadvertently reduce the overall pressure 
rise. In either case, the power supplied to the smaller pump would be wasted. 
 
Discussion 
If the pumps are not significantly dissimilar, a series or parallel arrangement of the pumps might be wise.

(b) True: The net head increases by H1 through the first pump, and then by H2 through the second pump. The overall rise 
in net head is thus the sum of the two. 
(c) True: Since the pumps are in parallel, the total volume flow rate is the sum of the individual volume flow rates. 
(d) False: For pumps in parallel, the change in pressure from the upstream junction to the downstream junction is the same 
regardless of which parallel branch is under consideration. Thus, even though the volume flow rate may not be the 
same in each branch, the net head must be the same: H = H1 = H2.

We are to label several items on the provided plot.

the

head, corresponding to the system curve. The intersection of these 
two curves is the operating point of the pump. 
 
 
 
 
14-20 
Solution 
We are to determine which free surface is at higher elevation, and justify our answer with the energy 
equation. 
 
Analysis 
It is simplest to consider zero-flow conditions (V = 0), at which we see that the required net head is 
positive. This implies that, even when there is no flow between the two tanks, the pump would need to provide some net 
head just to overcome the pressure differences. Since there is no flow, pressure differences can come only from gravity. 
Hence, the outlet tank’s free surface must be higher than that of the inlet tank. Mathematically, we apply the energy 
equation in head form between the inlet tank’s free surface (1) and the outlet tank’s free surface (2),

Since both free surfaces are at atmospheric pressure, P1 = P2 = Patm, and the first term on the right side of Eq. 1 vanishes. 
Furthermore, since there is no flow, V1 = V2 = 0, and the second term vanishes. There is no turbine in the control volume, so 
the second-to-last term is zero. Finally, there are no irreversible head losses since there is no flow, and the last term is also 
zero. Equation 1 reduces to

Since Hrequired is positive on Fig. P14-19 at V = 0, the quantity (z2 – z1) must also be positive by Eq. 2. Thus we have shown 
mathematically that the outlet tank’s free surface is higher in elevation than that of the inlet tank. 
 
Discussion 
If the reverse were true (outlet tank free surface lower than inlet tank free surface), Hrequired at V = 0 would 
be negative, implying that the pump would need to supply enough negative net head to hold back the natural tendency of 
the water to flow from higher to lower elevation. In reality, the pump would not be able to do this unless it were spun 
backwards.

Solution 
We are to discuss what would happen to the pump performance curve, the system curve, and the operating 
point if the free surface of the outlet tank were raised to a higher elevation.  
 
Analysis 
The pump is the same pump regardless of the locations of the inlet and outlet tanks’ free surfaces; thus, the 
pump performance curve does not change. The energy equation is

Since the only thing that changes is the elevation 
difference, Eq. 1 shows that Hrequired shifts up as (z2 – z1) 
increases. Thus, the system curve rises linearly with 
elevation increase. A plot of H versus V is plotted, 
and the new operating point is labeled. Because of the 
upward shift of the system curve, the operating point 
moves to a lower value of volume flow rate. 
 
Discussion 
The shift of operating point to lower V 
agrees with our physical intuition. Namely, as we raise 
the elevation of the outlet, the pump has to do more 
work to overcome gravity, and we expect the flow rate 
to decrease accordingly.

Solution 
We are to discuss what would happen to the pump performance curve, the system curve, and the operating 
point if a valve changes from 100% to 50% open.

The pump is the same pump regardless of the locations of the inlet and outlet tanks’ free surfaces; thus, the 
pump performance curve does not change. The energy equation is

Since both free surfaces are open to the atmosphere, the 
pressure term vanishes. Since both V1 and V2 are negligibly 
small at the free surface (the tanks are large), the second 
term on the right also vanishes. The elevation difference (z2 
– z1) does not change, and so the only term in Eq. 1 that is 
changed by closing the valve is the irreversible head loss 
term. We know that the minor loss associated with a valve 
increases significantly as the valve is closed. Thus, the 
system curve (the curve of Hrequired versus V) increases 
more rapidly with volume flow rate (has a larger slope) 
when the valve is partially closed. A sketch of H versus 
V is plotted, and the new operating point is labeled. 
Because of the higher system curve, the operating point 
moves to a lower value of volume flow rate, as indicated on 
the figure. I.e., the volume flow rate decreases. 
 
Discussion 
The shift of operating point to lower V agrees with our physical intuition. Namely, as we close the valve 
somewhat, the pump has to do more work to overcome the losses, and we expect the flow rate to decrease accordingly.

Solution 
We are to create a qualitative plot of pump net 
head versus pump capacity.  
 
Analysis 
The result is shown in the figure, and the requested 
items are labeled.  Also labeled are the available net head, 
corresponding to the pump performance curve, and the required net 
head, corresponding to the system curve. The intersection of these 
two curves is the operating point of the pump. Note that since the 
elevation of the outlet is lower than that of the free surface of the 
inlet tank, the required net head must be negative at zero flow rate 
conditions, as sketched, implying that the pump holds back the 
natural tendency of the water to flow from higher to lower 
elevation. Only at higher flow rates does the system curve rise to 
positive values of Hrequired. 
 
Discussion 
A real pump cannot produce negative net head at 
zero volume flow rate unless its blades are spun in the opposite 
direction than that for which they are designed.

We are to estimate the volume flow rate through a piping system.

The density and viscosity of water at T = 20oC are 998.0 kg/m3 and 1.002  10-3 kg/ms respectively. 
 
Analysis 
By definition, at free delivery conditions, the net head across the pump is zero. Thus, there is no loss or gain 
of pressure across the pump, and we can essentially ignore it in the calculations here. We apply the head form of the steady 
energy equation from location 1 to location 2,

where the pressure term vanishes since the free surface at location 1 and at the exit (location 2) are both open to the 
atmosphere. The inlet velocity term disappears since V1 is negligibly small at the free surface. Thus, Eq. 1 reduces to a

Equation 5 is an implicit equation for V since the Darcy friction factor is a function of Reynolds number Re = VD/, as 
obtained from either the Moody chart or the Colebrook equation. The solution can be obtained by an iterative method, or 
through use of a mathematical equation solver like EES. The result is V = 1.82548 m/s, or to three significant digits, V = 
1.83 m/s, from which the volume flow rate is

Discussion 
Since there is no net head across the pump at free delivery conditions, the pump could be removed (inlet 
and outlet pipes connected together without the pump), and the flow rate would be the same. Another way to think about 
this is that the pump’s efficiency is zero at the free delivery operating point, so it is doing no useful work.

Solution 
We are to calculate the volume flow rate through a piping system in which the pipe is rough. 
 
Assumptions 1 Since the reservoir is large, the flow is nearly steady. 2 The water is incompressible. 3 The water is at 
room temperature. 4 The flow in the pipe is fully developed and turbulent, with  = 1.05. 
 
Properties 
The density and viscosity of water at T = 20oC are 998.0 kg/m3 and 1.002  10-3 kg/ms respectively. 
 
Analysis 
The relative pipe roughness is /D = (0.012 cm)/(2.0 cm) = 0.006 (very rough, as seen on the Moody chart). 
The calculations are identical to that of the previous problem, except for the pipe roughness. The result is V = 1.6705 m/s, 
or to three significant digits, V = 1.67 m/s, from which the volume flow rate is 5.25  10-4 m3/s, or V = 31.5 Lpm. The 
Reynolds number is 3.33  104. The volume flow rate is lower by about 8.4% compared to the smooth pipe case. This 
agrees with our intuition, since pipe roughness leads to more pressure drop at a given flow rate. 
 
Discussion 
If the calculations of the previous problem are done on a computer, it is trivial to change  for the present 
calculations.

Equation 2 is an implicit equation for V since the Darcy friction factor is a function of Reynolds number Re = VD/, as 
obtained from either the Moody chart or the Colebrook equation. The solution can be obtained by an iterative method, or 
through use of a mathematical equation solver like EES. The result is V = 2.9293 m/s, from which the volume flow rate is

(3) 
In more common units, V = 55.2 Lpm, an increase of about 60% compared to the flow rate with the pump operating 
at free delivery. This agrees with our expectations – adding a pump in the line produces a higher flow rate. 
 
Discussion 
Although there was a pump in the previous problem as well, it was operating at free delivery conditions, 
implying that it was not contributing anything to the flow – that pump could be removed from the system with no change in 
flow rate. Here, however, the net head across the pump is about 6.82 m, implying that it is contributing useful head to the 
flow (in addition to the gravity head already present).

Solution 
We are to calculate the volume flow rate through a piping system in which the pipe is rough. 
 
Assumptions 1 Since the reservoir is large, the flow is nearly steady. 2 The water is incompressible. 3 The water is at 
room temperature. 4 The flow in the pipe is fully developed and turbulent, with  = 1.05. 
 
Properties 
The density and viscosity of water at T = 20oC are 998.0 kg/m3 and 1.002  10-3 kg/ms respectively. 
 
Analysis 
The relative pipe roughness is /D = (0.012 cm)/(2.0 cm) = 0.006 (very rough, as seen on the Moody chart). 
The calculations are identical to that of the previous problem, except for the pipe roughness. The result is V = 2.786 m/s, 
from which the volume flow rate is 8.753  10-4 m3/s, or V = 52.5 Lpm. The Reynolds number is 5.55  104. The volume 
flow rate is lower by about 4.9% compared to the smooth pipe case. This agrees with our intuition, since pipe 
roughness leads to more pressure drop at a given flow rate. 
 
Discussion 
If the calculations of the previous problem are done on a computer, it is trivial to change  for the present 
calculations.

At this volume flow rate, the net head of the pump is 13.1 ft. 
 
Discussion 
At this operating point, the flow rate is lower than that at the BEP. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
14-35  
 
 
Solution 
We are to perform a regression analysis to estimate the 
shutoff head and free delivery of a pump, and then we are to determine if 
this pump is adequate for the system requirements. 
 
Assumptions 1 The water is incompressible. 2 The water is at room 
temperature. 
 
Properties 
The density of water at T = 20oC is 998.0 kg/m3. 
 
Analysis 
(a) We perform a regression analysis, and obtain H0 = 
23.9 m and a = 0.00642 m/Lpm2. The curve fit is reasonable, as seen in 
Fig. 1. The shutoff head is estimated as 23.9 m of water column. At the 
pump’s free delivery, the net head is zero. Setting Havailable to zero in Eq. 1 
gives

As seen in Fig. 1, this operating point lies above the pump performance curve. Thus, this pump is not quite adequate for 
the job at hand. 
 
Discussion 
The operating point is also very close to the pump’s free delivery, and therefore the pump efficiency would 
be low even if it could put out the required head.

Discussion 
Equation 4 reveals that H0 must be greater than elevation difference (z2 – z1) in order to have a valid 
operating point. This agrees with our intuition, since the pump must be able to overcome the gravitational head between the 
tanks.

Solution 
For a given pump and system, we are to calculate the capacity. 
 
Assumptions 1 The water is incompressible. 2 The flow is nearly steady since the reservoirs are large. 3 The water is at 
room temperature. 
 
Properties 
The kinematic viscosity of water at T = 68oF is 1.055  10-5 ft2/s.

Since both free surfaces are at atmospheric pressure, P1 = P2 = Patm, and the first term on the right side of Eq. 1 vanishes. 
Furthermore, since there is no flow, V1 = V2 = 0, and the second term also vanishes. There is no turbine in the control 
volume, so the second-to-last term is zero. Finally, the irreversible head losses are composed of both major and minor 
losses, but the pipe diameter is constant throughout. Equation 1 therefore reduces to

Equation 3 is an implicit equation for V since the Darcy friction factor f is a function of Reynolds number Re = VD/ = 
VD/, as obtained from either the Moody chart or the Colebrook equation. The solution can be obtained by an iterative 
method, or through use of a mathematical equation solver like EES. The result is V = 1.80 ft/s, from which the volume flow 
rate is V = 6.34 gpm. The Reynolds number is 1.67  104. 
 
Discussion 
We verify our results by comparing Havailable (given) and Hrequired (Eq. 2) at this flow rate: Havailable = 24.4 ft 
and Hrequired = 24.4 ft.

14-40E 
Solution 
We are to plot Hrequired and Havailable versus V, and 
indicate the operating point. 
 
Analysis 
We use the equations of the previous problem, with the 
same constants and parameters, to generate the plot shown. The 
operating point is the location where the two curves intersect. The values 
of H and Vat the operating point match those of the previous problem, 
as they should. 
 
Discussion 
A plot like this, in fact, is an alternate method of 
obtaining the operating point. In this case, the curve of Hrequired is fairly 
flat, indicating that the majority of the required pump head is attributed 
to elevation change, while a small fraction is attributed to major and 
minor head losses through the piping system.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
14-41E 
Solution 
We are to re-calculate volume flow rate for a piping system with a much longer pipe, and we are to compare 
with the previous results. 
 
Analysis 
All assumptions, properties, dimensions, and parameters are identical to those of the previous problem, 
except that total pipe length L is longer. We repeat the calculations and find that V = 1.63 ft/s, from which the volume flow 
rate is V = 5.75 gpm, and the net head of the pump is 42.3 ft. The Reynolds number for the flow in the pipe is 1.55  104. 
The volume flow rate has decreased by about 9.3%. 
 
Discussion 
The decrease in volume flow rate is smaller than we may have suspected. This is because the majority of the 
pump work goes into raising the elevation of the water. In addition, as seen in the plot from the previous problem, the pump 
performance curve is quite steep near these flow rates – a significant change in required net head leads to a much less 
significant change in volume flow rate.

Solution 
We are to perform a regression analysis to translate 
tabulated pump performance data into an analytical expression, and then 
use this expression to predict the volume flow rate through a piping 
system. 
 
Assumptions 1 The water is incompressible. 2 The flow is nearly 
steady since the reservoirs are large. 3 The water is at room temperature. 
 
Properties 
For water at T = 68oF,  = 6.572  10-4 lbm/fts, and  = 
62.31 lbm/ft3, from which  = 1.055  10-5 ft2/s. 
 
Analysis 
(a) We perform a regression analysis, and obtain H0 = 38.15 ft and a = 0.06599 ft/gpm2. The curve fit is 
very good, as seen in Fig. 1. 
 
(b) We repeat the calculations of Problem 14-37 with the new pump performance coefficients, and find that V = 3.29 ft/s, 
from which the volume flow rate is V = 11.6 gpm, and the net head of the pump is 29.3 ft. The Reynolds number for the 
flow in the pipe is 3.05  104. The volume flow rate has increased by about 83%. Paul is correct – this pump performs 
much better, nearly doubling the flow rate. 
 
(c) A plot of net head versus volume flow rate is shown in Fig. 2. 
 
Discussion 
This pump is more appropriate for the piping system at hand.

We are to re-calculate volume flow rate for a piping system with a smaller elevation difference, and we are 
to compare with the previous results. 
 
Analysis 
All assumptions, properties, dimensions, and parameters are identical to those of the previous problem, 
except that the elevation difference between reservoir surfaces (z2 – z1) is smaller. We repeat the calculations and find that V 
= 0.538 m/s, from which the volume flow rate is V = 10.5 Lpm, and the net head of the pump is 17.0 m. The Reynolds 
number for the flow in the pipe is 1.09  104. The volume flow rate has increased by about 9.5%. 
 
Discussion 
The increase in volume flow rate is modest. This is because only about half of the pump work goes into 
raising the elevation of the water – the other half goes into overcoming irreversible losses.

Analysis 
(a) We perform a regression analysis, and obtain H0 = 47.6 m and a = 0.05119 m/Lpm2. The curve fit is 
reasonable, as seen in Fig. 1. 
 
(b) We repeat the calculations of Problem 14-41 with the new pump performance coefficients, and find that V = 1.00 m/s, 
from which the volume flow rate is V = 19.5 Lpm, and the net head of the pump is 28.3 m. The Reynolds number for the 
flow in the pipe is 2.03  104. The volume flow rate has increased by about 69%. April’s goal has not been reached. 
She will need to search for an even stronger pump. 
 
(c) A plot of net head versus volume flow rate is shown in Fig. 2. 
 
Discussion 
As is apparent from Fig. 2, the required net head increases rapidly with increasing volume flow rate. Thus, 
doubling the flow rate would require a significantly heftier pump.

Solution 
We are to calculate the volume flow rate when the pipe diameter of a piping/pump system is doubled. 
 
Analysis 
The analysis is identical to that of Problem 14-41 except for the diameter change. The calculations yield V = 
0.19869  0.199 m/s, from which the volume flow rate is V = 15.4 Lpm, and the net head of the pump is 8.25 m. The 
Reynolds number for the flow in the pipe is 8.03  103. The volume flow rate has increased by about 33%. This agrees 
with our intuition since irreversible head losses go down significantly by increasing pipe diameter. 
 
Discussion 
The gain in volume flow rate is significant because the irreversible head losses contribute to about half of 
the total pump head requirement in the original problem. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
14-48 
Solution 
We are to compare Reynolds numbers for a pipe flow system – the second case having a pipe diameter 
twice that of the first case.

Thus, the Reynolds number of the larger diameter pipe is smaller than that of the smaller diameter pipe. This may be 
somewhat surprising, but since average pipe velocity scales as the inverse of pipe diameter squared, Reynolds number 
increases linearly with pipe diameter due to the D in the numerator, but decreases quadratically with pipe diameter due to 
the V in the numerator. The net effect is a decrease in Re with pipe diameter when V is the same. In this problem, V 
increases somewhat as the diameter is doubled, but not enough to increase the Reynolds number. 
 
Discussion 
At first glance, most people would think that Reynolds number increases as both diameter and volume flow 
rate increase, but this is not always the case. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
14-49 
Solution 
We are to compare the volume flow rate in a piping system with and without accounting for minor losses. 
 
Analysis 
The analysis is identical to that of Problem 14-41, except we ignore all the minor losses. The calculations 
yield V = 0.604 m/s, from which the volume flow rate is V = 11.7 Lpm, and the net head of the pump is 15.1 m. The 
Reynolds number for the flow in the pipe is 1.22  104. The volume flow rate has increased by about 1.3%. Thus, minor 
losses are nearly negligible in this calculation. This agrees with our intuition since the pipe is very long. 
 
Discussion 
Since the Colebrook equation is accurate to at most 5%, a 1.3% change is well within the error. 
Nevertheless, it is not excessively difficult to include the minor losses, especially when solving the problem on a computer.

Solution 
We are to examine how increasing (z2 – z1) affects the 
volume flow rate of water pumped by the water pump. 
 
Assumptions 1 The flow at any instant of time is still considered quasi-
steady, since the surface level of the upper reservoir rises very slowly. 2 
The minor losses, dimensions, etc., fluid properties, and all other 
assumptions are identical to those of Problem 14-43 except for the 
elevation difference (z2 – z1). 
 
Analysis 
We repeat the calculations of Problem 14-43 for several 
values of (z2 – z1), ranging from 0 to H0, the shutoff head of the pump, 
since above the shutoff head, the pump cannot overcome the elevation 
difference. The volume flow rate is zero at the shutoff head of the 
pump. The data are plotted here. As expected, the volume flow rate 
decreases as (z2 – z1) increases, starting at a maximum flow rate of about 
14.1 Lpm when there is no elevation difference, and reaching zero (no 
flow) when (z2 – z1) = H0 = 24.4 m. The curve is not linear, since neither 
the Darcy friction factor nor the pump performance curve are linear. If (z2 – z1) were increased beyond H0, the pump would 
not be able to handle the elevation difference. Despite its valiant efforts, with blades spinning as hard as they could, the 
water would flow backwards through the pump. 
 
Discussion 
You may wish to think of the backward-flow through the pump as a case in which the pump efficiency is 
negative. In fact, at (z2 – z1) = H0, the pump could be replaced by a closed valve to keep the water from draining from the 
upper reservoir to the lower reservoir.

Solution 
We are to estimate the operating point of a given fan and duct system. 
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and incompressible. 2 The concentration of contaminants is low; the fluid properties 
are those of air alone. 3 The air is at 25oC and 101,300 Pa. 4 The air flowing in the duct is turbulent with  = 1.05. 
 
Properties 
For air at 25oC,  = 1.849  10-5 kg/ms,  = 1.184 kg/m3, and  = 1.562  10-5 m2/s. The density of water at 
STP (for conversion to water head) is 997.0 kg/m3. 
 
Analysis  
We apply the steady energy equation along a streamline from point 1 in the stagnant air region in the 
room to point 2 at the duct outlet,

P1 is equal to Patm, and P2 is also equal to Patm since the jet discharges into outside air on the roof of the building. Thus the 
pressure terms cancel out in Eq. 1. We ignore the air speed at point 1 since it is chosen (wisely) far enough away from the 
hood inlet so that the air is nearly stagnant. Finally, the elevation difference is neglected for gases. Equation 1 reduces to

To find the operating point, we equate Havailable and Hrequired, being careful to keep consistent units. Note that the required

the available net head (given) is in terms of equivalent water column height. We convert constants H0 and a in Eq. 1 to mm of

. Note that there is no minor loss associated with the exhaust, since point 2 
is at the exit plane of the duct, and does not include irreversible losses associated with the turbulent jet. Equation 6 is an 
implicit equation for V since the Darcy friction factor is a function of Reynolds number Re = VD/ = VD/, as obtained 
from the Moody chart or the Colebrook equation. The solution can be obtained by an iterative method, or through use of a 
mathematical equation solver like EES. The result is V = 6.71 m/s, from which the volume flow rate is V = 7090 Lpm. 
 
Discussion 
We verify our results by comparing Havailable (given) and Hrequired (Eq. 5) at this flow rate: Havailable = 47.4 mm 
of water and Hrequired = 47.4 mm of water, both of which are equivalent to 40.0 m of air column.

14-52 
Solution 
We are to plot Hrequired and Havailable versus V, and indicate 
the operating point. 
 
Analysis 
We use the equations of the previous problem, with the 
same constants and parameters, to generate the plot shown. The operating 
point is the location where the two curves intersect. The values of H and 
Vat the operating point match those of the previous problem, as they 
should. 
 
Discussion 
A plot like this, in fact, is an alternate method of obtaining 
the operating point. The operating point is at a volume flow rate near the 
center of the plot, indicating that the fan efficiency is probably reasonably 
high.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
14-53 
Solution 
We are to estimate the volume flow rate at the operating point without accounting for minor losses, and then 
we are to compare with the previous results. 
 
Analysis 
All assumptions and properties are the same as those of Problem 14-52, except that we ignore all minor 
losses (we set KL = 0). The resulting volume flow rate at the operating point is V = 10,900 Lpm (to three significant 
digits), approximately 54% higher than for the case with minor losses taken into account. In this problem, minor losses are 
not “minor”, and are by no means negligible. Even though the duct is fairly long (L/D is about 163), the minor losses are 
large, especially those through the damper and the one-way valve. 
 
Discussion 
An error of 54% is not acceptable in this type of problem. Furthermore, since it is not difficult to account 
for minor losses, especially if the calculations are performed on a computer, it is wise not to ignore these terms.  
 
 
 
 
 
14-54 
Solution 
We are to calculate pressure at two locations in a blocked duct system. 
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The concentration of contaminants in the air is low; the fluid properties are those of 
air alone. 3 The air is at standard temperature and pressure (STP: 25oC and 101,300 Pa), and is incompressible. 
 
Properties 
The density of water at 25oC is 997.0 kg/m3. 
 
Analysis 
Since the air is completely blocked by the one-way valve, there is no flow. Thus, there are no major or 
minor losses – just a pressure gain across the fan. Furthermore, the fan is operating at its shutoff head conditions. Since the 
pressure in the room is atmospheric, the gage pressure anywhere in the stagnant air region in the duct between the fan and 
the one-way valve is therefore equal to H0 = 60.0 mm of water column. We convert to pascals as follows: 
Gage pressure at both locations:

Thus, at either location, the gage pressure is 60.0 mm of water column, or 587 Pa. 
 
Discussion 
The answer depends only on the shutoff head of the fan – duct diameter, minor losses, etc, are irrelevant for 
this case since there is no flow. The fan should not be run for long time periods under these conditions, or it may burn out.

Solution 
We are to calculate the value of KL, damper such that the volume flow rate through the duct decreases by a 
factor of 3. 
 
Analysis 
All assumptions and properties are the same as those of the previous problem. We set the volume flow rate 
to V = 452/3 = 150.7 SCFM, one-half of the previous result, and solve for KL, damper. The result is KL, damper = 295, 
significantly higher than the value of 1.8 for the fully open case. 
 
Discussion 
Because of the nonlinearity of the problem, we cannot simply double the damper’s loss coefficient in order 
to decrease the flow rate by a factor of three. Indeed, the minor loss coefficient must be increased by a factor of more than 
160. If a computer was used for the calculations of the previous problem, the solution here is most easily obtained by trial 
and error. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
14-57E 
Solution 
We are to estimate the volume flow rate at the operating point without accounting for minor losses, and then 
we are to compare with the previous results. 
 
Analysis 
All assumptions and properties are the same as those of Problem 14-49, except that we ignore all minor 
losses (we set KL = 0). The resulting volume flow rate at the operating point is V = 503 SCFM, approximately 11% 
higher than for the case with minor losses taken into account. In this problem, minor losses are indeed “minor”, although 
they are not negligible. We should not be surprised at this result, since there are several minor losses, and the duct is not 
extremely long (L/D is only 45.0). 
 
Discussion 
An error of 11% may be acceptable in this type of problem. However, since it is not difficult to account for 
minor losses, especially if the calculations are performed on a computer, it is wise not to ignore these terms.

Solution 
For a given pump and piping system we are to estimate the maximum volume flow rate that can be pumped 
without cavitation.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The water is incompressible. 3 The flow is turbulent. 
 
Properties 
Patm = 14.696 psi = 2116.2 lbf/ft2. For water at T = 77oF,  = 6.002  10-4 lbm/(fts),  = 62.24 lbm/ft3, and 
Pv = 66.19 lbf/ft2.

In Eq. 1 we have ignored the water speed at the reservoir surface (V1  0). 
There is no turbine in the piping system. Also, although there is a pump 
in the system, there is no pump between point 1 and point 2; hence the 
pump head term also drops out. We solve Eq. 1 for P2/(g), which is the 
pump inlet pressure expressed as a head,

Note that in Eq. 2, we have recognized that P1 = Patm since the reservoir

The available net positive suction head at the pump inlet is

we get an expression for the available NPSH:

the piping system from the reservoir surface (1) to the pipe inlet (2), which depends on volume flow rate. Since the pipe

The required net positive suction head is obtained from the given expression. At our example flow rate of 40.0 gpm we 
see that NPSHrequired is about 9.6 ft. Since the actual NPSH is much higher than this, we need not worry about 
cavitation at this flow rate. We use a spreadsheet to calculate NPSH as a function of volume flow rate, and the 
results are plotted. It is clear from the plot that cavitation occurs at flow rates above about 56 gallons per minute. 
 
Discussion 
NPSHrequired rises with volume flow rate, but the actual or available NPSH decreases with volume flow rate.

Solution 
We are to calculate the volume flow rate below which cavitation in a pump is avoided. 
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The water is incompressible. 
 
Properties 
Patm = 14.696 psi = 2116.2 lbf/ft2. For water at T = 113oF, we interpolate in the property tables of the 
Appendix to get  = 4.013  10-4 lbm/fts,  = 61.82 lbm/ft3, and Pv = 201.9 lbf/ft2. 
 
Analysis 
The procedure is identical to that of the previous problem, except for the water properties. The calculations 
predict that the pump cavitates at volume flow rates greater than about 55 gpm. This is somewhat lower than the result 
of the previous problem, as expected, since cavitation occurs more readily in warmer water. 
 
Discussion 
Note that NPSHrequired does not depend on water temperature, but the actual or available NPSH decreases 
with temperature.

Solution 
For a given pump and piping system we are to estimate the maximum volume flow rate that can be pumped 
without cavitation.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The water is incompressible. 3 The flow is turbulent. 
 
Properties 
Standard atmospheric pressure is Patm = 101.3 kPa. For water at T = 25oC,  = 997.0 kg/m3,  = 8.9110-4 
kg/ms, and Pv = 3.169 kPa. 
 
Analysis 
We apply the steady energy equation in head form along a streamline from point 1 at the reservoir surface 
to point 2 at the pump inlet,

In Eq. 1 we have ignored the water speed at the reservoir surface (V1  0). There is no turbine in the piping system. Also, 
although there is a pump in the system, there is no pump between point 1 and point 2; hence the pump head term also drops 
out. We solve Eq. 1 for P2/(g), which is the pump inlet pressure expressed as a head,

approximating 2 as 1.0, we get

Since we know Patm, Pv, and the elevation difference, all that remains is to 
estimate the total irreversible head loss through the piping system from the 
reservoir surface (1) to the pipe inlet (2), which depends on volume flow 
rate. Since the pipe diameter is constant, the total irreversible head loss is

The rest of the problem is most easily solved on a computer. For a given

which produces a Reynolds number of Re = VD/ = 3.96  104. At this Reynolds number, and with roughness factor /D =

The required net positive suction head is obtained from the given expression. At our example flow rate of 40.0 Lpm we 
see that NPSHrequired is about 4.28 m. Since the actual NPSH is higher than this, the pump does not cavitate at this 
flow rate. We use a spreadsheet to calculate NPSH as a function of volume flow rate, and the results are plotted. It is 
clear from this plot that cavitation occurs at flow rates above 60.5 liters per minute. 
 
Discussion 
NPSHrequired rises with volume flow rate, but the actual or available NPSH decreases with volume flow rate.

Solution 
We are to calculate the volume flow rate below which 
cavitation in a pump is avoided, at two temperatures. 
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The water is incompressible. 
 
Properties 
Standard atmospheric pressure is Patm = 101.3 kPa. For 
water at T = 80oC,  = 971.9 kg/m3,  = 3.5510-4 kg/ms, and Pv = 47.35 
kPa. At T = 90oC,  = 965.3 kg/m3,  = 3.1510-4 kg/ms, and Pv = 70.11 
kPa. 
 
Analysis 
The procedure is identical to that of the previous problem, 
except for the water properties. The calculations predict that at T = 80oC, 
the pump cavitates at volume flow rates greater than 28.0 Lpm. This is 
substantially lower than the result of the previous problem, as expected, 
since cavitation occurs more readily in warmer water. 
 
At 90oC, the vapor pressure is very high since the water is near 
boiling (at atmospheric pressure, water boils at 100oC). For this case, the 
curves of NPSHavailable and NPSHrequired do not cross at all as seen in the 
plot, implying that the pump cavitates at any flow rate when T = 90oC.  
 
Discussion 
Note that NPSHrequired does not depend on water 
temperature, but the actual or available NPSH decreases with temperature.

Solution 
We are to calculate the volume flow rate below which cavitation in a pump is avoided, and compare with a 
previous case with a smaller pipe diameter. 
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The water is incompressible. 
 
Properties 
Standard atmospheric pressure is Patm = 101.3 kPa. For water at T = 25oC,  = 997.0 kg/m3,  = 8.9110-4 
kg/ms, and Pv = 3.169 kPa. 
 
Analysis 
The analysis is identical to that of Problem 14-58, except that the pipe diameter is 48.0 mm instead of 24.0 
mm. Compared to problem 14-58, at a given volume flow rate, the average speed through the pipe decreases by a factor of 
four since the pipe area increases by a factor of four. The Reynolds number goes down by a factor of two, but the flow is 
still turbulent (At our sample flow rate of 40.0 Lpm, Re = 1.98  104). For a smooth pipe at this Reynolds number, f = 
0.0260. and the available NPSH is 7.81 m, slightly higher than the previous case with the smaller diameter pipe. After 
repeating the calculations at several flow rates, we find that the pump cavitates at V = 65.5 Lpm. This represents an 
increase of about 8.3%. Cavitation occurs at a higher volume flow rate when the pipe diameter is increased because 
the irreversible head losses in the piping system upstream of the pump are decreased. 
 
Discussion 
If a computer program like EES was used for Problem 14-58, it is a trivial matter to change the pipe 
diameter and re-do the calculations.

Solution 
We are to calculate the mass flow rate of slurry through a two-lobe rotary pump for given values of lobe 
volume and rotation rate.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady in the mean. 2 There are no leaks in the gaps between lobes or between lobes and the 
casing. 3 The slurry is incompressible.  
 
Analysis 
By studying the figure provided with this problem, we see that for each 360o rotation of the two counter-
rotating shafts (n = 1 rotation), the total volume of pumped fluid is

When there are three lobes, three lobe volumes are pumped for each 360o rotation of each rotor (n = 1 
rotation). Thus, the total volume of pumped fluid is

Thus, the volume flow rate is 86.6 gpm (to three significant digits). 
 
Discussion 
If there were leaks in the pump, the volume flow rate would be lower. This flow rate is slightly lower than 
that of the previous problem. Why? For the same overall diameter, it is clear from geometry that the more lobes, the less the 
volume per lobe, and the more “wasted” volume inside the pump – but the flow may be smoother (less unsteady) with more 
lobes.

Analysis 
From Fig. 14-26c, we count 14 teeth per gear. Thus, for each 360o rotation of each gear (n = 1 rotation), 
14(0.350 cm3) of fluid is pumped. Sine there are two gears, the total volume of fluid pumped per rotation is 2(14)(0.350 
cm3) = 9.80 cm3. 
 
Discussion 
The actual volume flow rate will be lower than this due to leakage in the gaps.

The brake horsepower and net head are considerably lower than those of the previous problem (by about 16%). So, 
we conclude that the angle at which the fluid impinges on the impeller blade is a critical parameter in the design of 
centrifugal pumps. 
 
Discussion 
The actual net head delivered to the water will be lower than this due to inefficiencies. Similarly, actual 
brake horsepower will be higher than that predicted here due to inefficiencies in the pump, friction on the shaft, etc.

Solution 
We are to calculate the brake horsepower and net head of an idealized centrifugal pump at a given volume 
flow rate and rotation rate.  
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady in the mean. 2 The water is incompressible. 3 The efficiency of the pump is 100% (no 
irreversible losses). 
 
Properties 
We take the density of water to be  = 998.0 kg/m3. 
 
Analysis 
Since the volume flow rate (capacity) is given, we calculate the normal velocity components at the inlet and 
the outlet using Eq. 14-12,

The brake horsepower and net head are considerably higher than those of the original problem (by about 23%). So, 
we conclude that the angle at which the fluid impinges on the impeller blade is a critical parameter in the design of 
centrifugal pumps. Here, reverse swirl has improved (increased the net head), but at the expense of higher bhp. So, a little 
reverse flow is desirable in terms of increasing the net head, but the increase in net head comes at a cost – more 
required power. Also, keep in mind that we are neglecting losses (assuming 100% efficiency). In real life, losses at the 
inlet may be significantly greater when the flow does not impinge parallel to the blades. 
 
Discussion 
The actual net head delivered to the water will be lower than this due to inefficiencies. Similarly, actual 
brake horsepower will be higher than that predicted here due to inefficiencies in the pump, friction on the shaft, etc.

Solution 
For given flow conditions and stator blade shape at a 
given radius, we are to design the rotor blade. Specifically, we are to 
calculate the leading and trailing edge angles of the rotor blade and sketch 
its shape. We are also to decide how many rotor blades to construct. 
 
Assumptions 1 The air is nearly incompressible. 2 The flow area 
between hub and tip is constant. 3 Two-dimensional blade row analysis is 
appropriate. 
 
Analysis 
First we analyze flow through the stator from an absolute 
reference frame, using the two-dimensional approximation of a cascade 
(blade row) of stator blades as sketched in Fig. 1. Flow enters axially 
(horizontally), and is turned 26.6o downward. Since the axial component 
of velocity must remain constant to conserve mass, the magnitude of the 
velocity leaving the trailing edge of the stator, 
st
V

 is calculated,

Since the rotor blade row moves upward in the figure provided with this problem, we add a downward velocity with 
magnitude given by Eq. 2 to translate 
st
V

 into the rotating reference frame sketched in Fig. 2. The angle of the leading edge 
of the rotor, rl, can be calculated. After some trig,

The air must now be turned by the rotor blade row in such a way that it leaves the trailing edge of the rotor blade at 
zero angle (axially – no swirl) from an absolute reference frame. This determines the rotor’s trailing edge angle, rt. 
Specifically, when we add an upward velocity of magnitude r (Eq. 2) to the relative velocity exiting the trailing edge of 
the rotor, 
rt, relative
V

, we convert back to the absolute reference frame, and obtain 
rt
V

, the velocity leaving the rotor trailing 
edge. It is this velocity, 
rt
V

, which must be axial (horizontal). Furthermore, to conserve mass 
rt
V

 must equal 
in
V

 since we 
are assuming incompressible flow. Working “backwards” we construct 
rt, relative


 in Fig. 3. Some trigonometry reveals that

We conclude that the rotor blade at this radius has a leading edge angle of about 74.1o (Eq. 3) and a trailing edge 
angle of about 71.6o (Eq. 4). A sketch of the rotor blade is provided in Fig. 2; it is clear that the blade is nearly straight, at 
least at this radius. 
 
Finally, to avoid interaction of the stator blade wakes with the rotor blade leading edges, we choose the number of 
rotor blades such that it has no common denominator with the number of stator blades. Since there are 18 stator blades, we 
pick a number like 13, 17, or 19 rotor blades. 16 would not be appropriate since it shares a common denominator of 2 with 
the number 18. 
 
Discussion 
We can easily repeat the calculation for all radii from hub to tip, completing the design of the entire rotor.

Solution 
We are to calculate the combined shutoff head and free 
delivery for two pumps in series, and discuss why the weaker pump 
should be shut off and bypassed above some flow rate. 
 
Assumptions 1 The water is incompressible. 2 The flow is steady. 
 
Analysis 
The 
pump 
performance 
curves 
for 
both 
pumps 
individually and for their combination in series are plotted here. At zero 
flow rate, the shutoff head of the two pumps in series is equal to the sum 
of their individual shutoff heads: H0,combined = H0,1 + H0,2 = 6.33 m + 9.25 
m. Thus the combined shutoff head is 15.6 m (to three significant 
digits). At free delivery conditions (zero net head), the free delivery of the 
two pumps in series is limited to that of the stronger pump, in this case 
Pump 2: 
max,combined
V
= MAX(
max,1
V
, 
max,2
V
) = 13.999 Lpm. Thus the 
combined free delivery is 14.0 Lpm (to three significant digits). 
 
As volume flow rate increases, the combined net pump head is 
equal to the sum of the net pump heads of the individual pumps, as seen 
on the plot. However, the free delivery of Pump 1 is

Above this flow rate, Pump 1 no longer contributes to the flow. In fact, it becomes a liability to the system since its net 
head would be negative at flow rates above 10.0 Lpm. For this reason, it is wise to shut off and bypass Pump 1 above 
10.0 Lpm. We are assuming no additional losses in the bypass line around pump 1. 
 
Discussion 
The free delivery of Pump 2 is 14.0 Lpm. The free delivery of the two-pump system is no better than that of 
Pump 2 alone, since Pump 1 is shut off and bypassed at flow rates above 10.0 Lpm. 
 
 
 
 
 
14-72  
Solution 
We are to calculate the free delivery and shutoff head for two pumps in parallel, and discuss why the 
weaker pump should be shut off and bypassed above some net head. 
 
Assumptions 1 The water is incompressible. 2 The flow is steady. 
 
Analysis 
The pump performance curves for both pumps and for 
their combination in parallel are plotted. At zero flow rate, the shutoff 
head of the two pumps in parallel is equal to that of the stronger pump, in 
this case Pump 2: H0,combined = MAX(H0,1, H0,2) = 9.25 m. Thus the 
combined shutoff head is 9.25 m. At free delivery conditions (zero net 
head), the free delivery of the two pumps in parallel is the sum of their 
individual free deliveries: 
max,combined
V
= 
max,1
V
 + 
max,2
V
 = 10.0 Lpm + 14.0 
Lpm. Thus the combined free delivery is 24.0 Lpm. 
 
As net head increases, the combined capacity is equal to the sum 
of the capacities of the individual pumps, as seen in the plot. However, 
the shutoff head of Pump 1 (6.33 m) is lower than that of Pump 2 (9.25 
m). Above the shutoff head of Pump 1, that pump no longer contributes 
to the flow. In fact, it becomes a liability to the system since it cannot 
sustain such a high head. If not shut off and blocked, the volume flow 
rate through Pump 1 would be negative at net heads above 6.33 m. For 
this reason, it is wise to shut off and block Pump 1 above 6.33 m. 
 
Discussion 
The shutoff head of Pump 2 is 9.25 m. The shutoff head of the two-pump system is no better than that of 
Pump 2 alone, since Pump 1 is shut off and blocked at net heads above 9.25 m.

14-73C 
Solution 
We are to discuss the meaning and purpose of draft tubes.  
 
Analysis 
A draft tube is a diffuser that also turns the flow downstream of a turbine. Its purpose is to turn the 
flow horizontally and recover some of the kinetic energy leaving the turbine runner. If the draft tube is not designed 
carefully, much of the kinetic energy leaving the runner would be wasted, reducing the overall efficiency of the 
turbine system. 
 
Discussion 
Students’ answers should be in their own words. 
 
 
 
 
 
14-74C 
Solution 
We are to name and describe the two types of dynamic turbine.  
 
Analysis 
There are two basic types of dynamic turbine – impulse and reaction. In an impulse turbine, fluid is sent 
through a nozzle so that most of its available mechanical energy is converted into kinetic energy. The high-speed jet then 
impinges on bucket-shaped vanes that transfer energy to the turbine shaft. In a reaction turbine, the fluid completely fills the 
casing, and the runner is rotated by momentum exchange due to pressure differences across the blades, rather than by 
kinetic energy impingement. Impulse turbines require a higher head, but can operate with a smaller volume flow rate. 
Reaction turbines can operate with much less head, but require higher volume flow rate. 
 
Discussion 
Students’ answers should be in their own words. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
14-75C 
Solution 
We are to discuss reverse swirl in reaction turbines.  
 
Analysis 
Reverse swirl is when the runner blades turn the flow so much that the swirl at the runner outlet is in 
the direction opposite to runner rotation. A small amount of reverse swirl may be desirable so that more power is 
absorbed from the water. We can easily see this from the Euler turbomachine equation,

Namely, since there is a negative sign on the last term, the shaft power increases if V1,t is negative, in other words, if there is 
reverse swirl at the runner outlet. If there is too much reverse swirl, a lot of extra kinetic energy gets wasted downstream of 
the runner. 
 
Discussion 
A well designed draft tube can recover a good portion of the streamwise kinetic energy of the water leaving 
the runner. However, the swirling kinetic energy cannot be recovered.

14-76C 
Solution 
We are to discuss why turbines have higher efficiencies than pumps.  
 
Analysis 
There are several reasons for this. First, pumps normally operate at higher rotational speeds than do 
turbines; therefore, shear stresses and frictional losses are higher. Second, conversion of kinetic energy into flow 
energy (pumps) has inherently higher losses than does the reverse (turbines). You can think of it this way: Since 
pressure rises across a pump (adverse pressure gradient), but drops across a turbine (favorable pressure gradient), boundary 
layers are less likely to separate in a turbine than in a pump. Third, turbines (especially hydroturbines) are often much 
larger than pumps, and viscous losses become less important as size increases. Finally, while pumps often operate over 
a wide range of flow rates, most electricity-generating turbines run within a narrower operating range and at a 
controlled constant speed; they can therefore be designed to operate very efficiently at those conditions. 
 
Discussion 
Students’ answers should be in their own words. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
14-77C 
Solution 
We are to discuss the classification of dynamic pumps and reaction turbines.  
 
Analysis 
Dynamic pumps are classified according to the angle at which the flow exits the impeller blade – 
centrifugal, mixed-flow, or axial. Reaction turbines, on the other hand, are classified according to the angle that the 
flow enters the runner – radial, mixed-flow, or axial. This is the main difference between how dynamic pumps and 
reaction turbines are classified. 
 
Discussion 
Students’ answers should be in their own words.

Solution 
We are to prove that the maximum power of a Pelton wheel occurs when r = Vj/2 (bucket moving at half 
the jet speed). 
 
Assumptions 1 Frictional losses are negligible, so that the Euler turbomachine equation applies, and the relative exit 
speed of the jet is the same as its relative inlet speed. 2 The turning angle is sufficient to prevent the exiting fluid from 
striking the next bucket. 3 The fluid, jet speed, volume flow rate, turning angle, and wheel radius are fixed – rotation rate is 
the only variable about which we are concerned.

With the stated assumptions, Eq. 14-40 applies, namely,

Solution of Eq. 2 yields the desired result, namely, the maximum power of a Pelton wheel occurs when  r = Vj/2  (bucket 
moving at half the jet speed). 
 
Discussion 
To be sure that we have not identified a minimum instead of a maximum, we could substitute some 
numerical values and plot 
shaft

 versus . It turns out that we have indeed found the maximum value of 
shaft
W
.

and actual required net head will be higher than the values predicted here.

Solution 
We are to examine the effect of runner outlet angle 1 on 
the required net head and the output power of a hydroturbine. 
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The fluid is water at 20oC. 3 The 
blades are infinitesimally thin. 4 The flow is everywhere tangent to the 
runner blades. 5 We neglect irreversible losses through the turbine. 
 
Properties 
For water at 20oC,  = 998.0 kg/m3. 
 
Analysis 
We repeat the calculations of the previous problem, but 
with 1 varying from -20o to 20o. The results are plotted. We see that the 
required net head H and the output brake horsepower bhp decrease as 1 
increases. This agrees with our expectations, based on the negative sign on 
the V1,t term in the Euler turbomachine equation. In other words, we can 
produce greater power by increasing the reverse swirl, but at the cost of 
increased required net head. However, when 1 is smaller than about -9o, 
the required net head rises above Hgross, which is impossible, even with no 
irreversibilities. Thus, when 1 < -9o, the predicted net head and brake 
horsepower are not feasible – they violate the second law of 
thermodynamics. 
 
 
Discussion 
A small amount of reverse swirl is usually good, but too much reverse swirl is not good.

Solution 
We are to calculate flow angles, required net head, and power output for a Francis turbine.

Solution 
We are to calculate the runner blade trailing edge angle such that there is no swirl. At this value of 1, we 
are to also calculate the shaft power. 
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady. 2 The fluid is water at 68oF. 3 The blades are infinitesimally thin. 4 The flow is 
everywhere tangent to the runner blades. 5 We neglect irreversible losses through the turbine. 
 
Properties 
For water at 68oF,  = 62.32 lbm/ft3. 
 
Analysis 
Using EES or other software, we adjust 1 by trial and error until 1 = 0. It turns out that 1 = 43.6o, at 
which 
shaft
W
= 2.12  105 hp. 
 
Discussion 
It turns out that the swirl angle at the runner output is a strong function of 1 – a small change in 1 leads to 
a large change in 1. The shaft power increases, as expected, since the original swirl angle was positive. The increase in 
shaft power is less than 5%.

Solution 
For given flow conditions and stator blade shape at a 
given radius, we are to design the rotor vane (bucket) for a single-stage 
turbine. Specifically, we are to calculate the leading and trailing edge 
angles of the rotor blade and sketch its shape. 
 
Assumptions 1 The water is nearly incompressible. 2 The flow area 
between hub and tip is constant. 3 Two-dimensional blade row analysis 
is appropriate. 
 
Analysis 
First we analyze flow through the stator from an 
absolute reference frame, using the two-dimensional approximation of a 
cascade (blade row) of stator blades as sketched in Fig. 1. Flow enters 
axially (horizontally), and is turned 50.3o upward. Since the axial 
component of velocity must remain constant to conserve mass, the 
magnitude of the velocity leaving the trailing edge of the stator, 
st
V

 is 
calculated,

Since the rotor blade row moves upward in the figure provided with this problem, we add a downward velocity with 
magnitude given by Eq. 2 to translate 
st
V

 into the rotating reference frame sketched in Fig. 2. The angle of the leading edge 
of the rotor, rl, can be calculated. After some trig,

The water must now be turned by the rotor vane row in such a way that it leaves the trailing edge of the rotor vane 
at zero angle (axially – no swirl) from an absolute reference frame. This determines the rotor’s trailing edge angle, rt. 
Specifically, when we add an upward velocity of magnitude r (Eq. 2) to the relative velocity exiting the trailing edge of 
the rotor, 
rt, relative
V

, we convert back to the absolute reference frame, and obtain 
rt

, the velocity leaving the rotor trailing 
edge. It is this velocity,

are assuming incompressible flow. Working “backwards” we construct

We conclude that the rotor blade at this radius has a leading edge angle of about 14.9o (Eq. 3) and a trailing edge 
angle of about 55.8o (Eq. 4). A sketch of the rotor vane is provided in Fig. 2; the vane is curved to turn the flow. Some 
turbine vanes are turned a lot more than this, hence the name “bucket”. 
 
Finally, to avoid interaction of the stator blade wakes with the rotor vane leading edges, we choose the number of 
rotor vanes such that it has no common denominator with the number of stator blades. Since there are 16 stator blades, we 
pick a number like 13, 15, or 17 rotor vanes. 14 or 18 would not be appropriate since they share a common denominator of 
2 with the number 16. 
 
Discussion 
We can easily repeat the calculation for all radii from hub to tip, completing the design of the entire rotor.

(b) For 30 machines, the total electrical power produced is 30(2.5 MW) = 75 MW. However, some of that is lost (wasted – 
turned into heat) due to inefficiencies in the power distribution system. The electrical power that actually makes it to 
peoples home is thus (power distribution system)(total power) = (0.96)(75 MW) = 72 MW. Since an average home consumes 
power at a rate of 1500 kW, the number of homes served by this wind farm is calculated as

Pump and Turbine Scaling Laws 
 
 
 
14-92C 
Solution 
We are to discuss the purpose of pump and turbine specific speeds. 
 
Analysis 
Pump specific speed is used to characterize the operation of a pump at its optimum conditions (best 
efficiency point), and is useful for preliminary pump selection. Likewise, turbine specific speed is used to characterize the 
operation of a turbine at its optimum conditions (best efficiency point), and is useful for preliminary turbine selection. 
 
Discussion 
Pump specific speed and turbine specific speed are parameters that can be calculated quickly. Based on the 
value obtained, one can quickly select the type of pump or turbine that is most appropriate for the given application.  
 
 
 
 
 
14-93C 
Solution 
  
(a) True: Rotation rate appears with an exponent of 1 in the affinity law for capacity. Thus, the change is linear. 
(b) False: Rotation rate appears with an exponent of 2 in the affinity law for net head. Thus, if the rpm is doubled, the net 
head increases by a factor of 4. 
(c) False: Rotation rate appears with an exponent of 3 in the affinity law for shaft power. Thus, if the rpm is doubled, the 
shaft power increases by a factor of 8. 
(d) True: The affinity laws apply to turbines as well as pumps, so this statement is true, as discussed in Part (c). 
 
 
 
 
 
14-94C 
Solution 
We are to discuss which pump and turbine performance parameters are used as the independent parameter, 
and explain why  
 
Analysis 
For pumps, we use CQ, the capacity coefficient, as the independent parameter. The reason is that the goal 
of a pump is to move fluid from one place to another, and the most important parameter is the pump’s capacity (volume 
flow rate). On the other hand, for most turbines, we use CP, the power coefficient, as the independent parameter. The 
reason is that the goal of a turbine is to rotate a shaft, and the most important parameter is the turbine’s brake horsepower 
 
Discussion 
There are exceptions. For example, when analyzing a positive-displacement turbine used to measure 
volume flow rate, capacity is more important than output shaft power, so one might use CQ, instead of CP as the 
independent parameter. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
14-95C 
Solution 
We are to give a definition of “affinity”, and explain why the scaling laws are called “affinity laws”.  
 
Analysis 
Among the many definitions of “affinity” is “inherent likeness or agreement”, and “...resemblance in 
general plan or structure”. When two pumps or two turbines are geometrically similar and operate under dynamically 
similar conditions, they indeed have “inherent likeness”. Thus, the phrase “affinity laws” is appropriate for the scaling 
laws of turbomachinery. 
 
Discussion 
Students will have various definitions, depending on the dictionary they use.

column, and capacity V is in units of liters per minute (Lpm). By 
definition, head coefficient CH = (gH)/(2D2), and capacity coefficient CQ 
= (V)/(D3). To convert, we must be careful with units. For example, we 
must convert the rotation rate from rpm to radians per second. The

Solution 
We are to calculate the specific speed of a fan, and determine what kind of fan it is.  
 
Analysis 
First, we use the values of CH and CQ calculated in the previous problem at the BEP (to four significant 
digits) to calculate the dimensionless form of NSp,

Thus, NSp = 0.859, and is dimensionless. From the conversion given in the text, NSp,US = 0.8587  2,734 = 2350. 
Alternatively, we can use the dimensional data to calculate NSp,US, the dimensional pump specific speed in US units,

Note that we use H = 11.60 m of air, since air is the fluid being pumped here. We calculate H as Hair = Hwater(water/air) = 
(0.01376 m of water)(998/1.184) = 11.60 m of air. From either the dimensionless or the dimensional pump specific speed, 
Fig. 14-73 shows that this is most likely a centrifugal fan (probably a squirrel cage fan). 
 
Discussion 
We calculated the dimensional pump specific speed two ways as a check of our algebra, and (fortunately) 
the results agree. 
 
 
 
 
14-98 
Solution 
We are to calculate the specific speed of a water pump, and determine what kind of pump it is.  
 
Analysis 
First, we use the values of CH and CQ calculated in Example 14-11 at the BEP to calculate the dimensionless 
form of NSp, 
Dimensionless pump specific speed:

Thus, NSp = 0.481. From the conversion given in the text, NSp,US = 1310. From Fig. 14-73, this is most likely a centrifugal 
pump. 
 
Discussion 
From Fig. 14-73, the maximum efficiency one can expect from a centrifugal pump at this value of NSp is 
about 0.87 (87%). The actual pump efficiency is only 81.2% (from Example 14-11), so there is room for improvement in 
the design. 
 
 
 
 
14-99 
Solution 
We are to decide what king of pump should be designed for given performance criteria.

From Fig. 14-73, we see that Len should design a centrifugal pump. The maximum pump efficiency is about 0.81 
(81%) (based on Fig. 14-73 again).  
 
Discussion 
This value of NSp is, in fact, on the low end of the curve for centrifugal pumps, so a centrifugal pump is the 
best Len can do, in spite of the low efficiency.

Thus, NSp = 0.302, which is the same as that of the original pump. This is not surprising since the two pumps operate at 
homologous points.  
 
Discussion 
When the rpm is increased by a factor of 1.5, all else being equal, the volume flow rate of the pump 
increases by a factor of (1.5)1, while the net head increases by a factor of (1.5)2. This agrees with the mnemonic given in the 
text: “Very Hard Problems are as easy as 1, 2, 3.” We would expect the power to increase by a factor of (1.5)3. The specific 
speed of the two pumps must match since they operate at homologous points.

From Fig. 14-73, we choose a centrifugal pump. The maximum pump efficiency is about 0.82 (82%) (based on Fig. 14-
73 again).  From the definition of pump efficiency, bhp = pumpVgH. Thus, the required brake horsepower is

definition, head coefficient CH = (gH)/(2D2), and capacity coefficient 
CQ = (V)/(D3). To convert, we must be careful with units. For

Solution 
We are to calculate the specific speed of a water pump, and determine what kind of pump it is.  
 
Analysis 
First, we use the values of CH and CQ calculated in the previous problem at the BEP to calculate the 
dimensionless form of NSp,

Thus, NSp = 0.199, and is dimensionless. From the conversion given in the text, NSp,US = 0.1992  2,734 = 545. 
Alternatively, we can use the original dimensional data to calculate NSp,US,

From either the dimensionless or the dimensional pump specific speed, Fig. 14-73 shows that this is definitely a 
centrifugal pump. 
 
Discussion 
We calculated the dimensional pump specific speed two ways as a check of our algebra, and (fortunately) 
the results agree. 
 
 
 
 
14-104 
Solution 
We are to prove the relationship between turbine specific speed and pump specific speed.  
 
Assumptions 1 The parameters such as net head, volume flow rate, diameter, etc. are defined in similar fashion for the 
pump and the turbine.

Discussion 
Since turbine efficiency is typically large (90 to 95% for large hydroturbines), pump specific speed and 
turbine specific speed are nearly equivalent. Note that Eq. 4 does not apply to a pump running backwards as a turbine or 
vice-versa. Such devices, called pump-turbines, are addressed in the next problem.

We are to prove the relationship between turbine specific speed and pump specific speed for the case of a 
pump-turbine operating at the same volume flow rate and rotational speed when acting as a pump and as a turbine.

Discussion 
It is difficult to achieve high efficiency in a pump-turbine during both the pump duty cycle and the turbine 
duty cycle. To achieve the highest possible efficiency, it is critical that both NSp and NSt are appropriate for the chosen 
design, e.g. radial flow centrifugal pump and radial-flow Francis turbine.

From Fig. 14-108, this is in the range of the typical Francis turbine. From the conversion given in the text, NSt,US = 
0.951  43.46 = 41.3. Alternatively, we can use the original dimensional data to calculate NSt,US,

From Fig. 14-108, this is on the high end of typical Francis turbines, on the border between Francis and Kaplan 
turbines. In nondimensional terms, NSt,US = 87.5 / 43.46 = 2.01. Note that the actual values of brake horsepower and net 
head will differ from the values calculated here, because we have neglected irreversible losses; thus, the values of NSt and 
NSt,US may change slightly.

The efficiency of the prototype is practically the same as that of the model. Similarly, the turbine specific speed of the 
model turbine was calculated previously as 0.260. After converting 548 rpm to 57.36 rad/s, we calculate the 
nondimensional form of turbine specific speed for the prototype turbine,

which is also practically the same as the previous calculation. Comparing to the results of Problem 14-119, we see that both 
turbine and Nst match between the model and the prototype. Thus, the model and the prototype operate at homologous 
points. 
 
Discussion 
Other nondimensional turbine parameters, like head coefficient, capacity coefficient, and power coefficient 
also match between model and prototype. We could instead have used dimensional units to calculate the turbine specific 
speed in customary US units.

This represents an increase of 77.7 – 69.2 = 8.5%. However, as mentioned in the text, we expect only about 2/3 of this 
increase, or 2(8.5%)/3 = 5.7%. Thus, our best estimate of the actual efficiency of the prototype is  
 
   
 
68.6%

There are several reasons for this increase in efficiency: The prototype turbine often operates at high Reynolds numbers that 
are not achievable in the laboratory. We know from the Moody chart that friction factor decreases with Re, as does 
boundary layer thickness. Hence, the influence of viscous boundary layers is less significant as turbine size increases, since 
the boundary layers occupy a less significant percentage of the flow path through the runner. In addition, the relative 
roughness (/D) on the surfaces of the prototype runner blades may be significantly smaller than that on the model turbine 
unless the model surfaces are micropolished. Finally, large full scale turbines have smaller tip clearances relative to blade 
diameter; therefore tip losses and leakage are less significant. 
 
Discussion 
The increase in efficiency between the model and prototype is significant, and helps us to understand why 
very large hydroturbines can be extremely efficient devices.

Review Problems 
 
 
 
 
14-118C 
Solution 
We are to discuss the definition and usefulness of a pump-turbine. 
 
Analysis 
A pump-turbine is a turbomachine that can run both as a pump and as a turbine (by running in the 
opposite direction). A pump-turbine is used by some power plants for energy storage; specifically, water is pumped by the 
pump-turbine during periods of low demand for power, and electricity is generated by the pump-turbine during periods of 
high demand for power. 
 
Discussion 
We note that energy is “lost” both ways – when the pump-turbine is acting as a pump, and when it is acting 
as a turbine. Nevertheless, the energy storage scheme may still be cost-effective and profitable, in spite of the energy losses, 
because it may enable a power company to delay construction of costly new power-production facilities. 
 
 
 
 
 
14-119C 
Solution 
We are to discuss a water meter from the point of view of a piping system.  
 
Analysis 
Although a water meter is a type of turbine, when analyzing pipe flow systems, we would think of the water 
meter as a type of minor loss in the system, just as a valve, elbow, etc. would be a minor loss, since there is a pressure 
drop associated with flow through the water meter. 
 
Discussion 
In fact, manufacturers of water meters provide minor loss coefficients for their products. 
 
 
 
 
 
14-120C 
Solution 
  
(a) True: As the gears turn, they direct a closed volume of fluid from the inlet to the outlet of the gear pump. 
(b) True or False: Rotary pumps can be either positive displacement or dynamic (an unfortunate use of terminology). As a 
positive-displacement pump, the rotors direct a closed volume of fluid from the inlet to the outlet of the rotary pump. 
As a dynamic pump, “rotary pump” is sometimes used in place of the more correct term, “rotodynamic pump”. 
(c) True: At a given rotational speed, the volume flow rate of a positive-displacement pump is fairly constant regardless of 
load because of the fixed closed volume. 
(d) False: Actually, the net head increases with fluid viscosity, because high viscosity fluids cannot penetrate the gaps as 
easily.

Solution 
We are to design a new hydroturbine by scaling up an existing hydroturbine. Specifically we are to calculate 
the new turbine diameter, volume flow rate, and brake horsepower. 
 
Assumptions 1 The new turbine is geometrically similar to the existing turbine. 2 Reynolds number effects and roughness 
effects are negligible. 3 The new penstock is also geometrically similar to the existing penstock so that the flow entering the 
new turbine (velocity profile, turbulence intensity, etc.) is similar to that of the existing turbine. 
 
Properties 
The density of water at 20oC is  = 998.0 kg/m3. 
 
Analysis 
Since the new turbine (B) is dynamically similar to the existing turbine (A), we are concerned with only one 
particular homologous operating point of both turbines, namely the best efficiency point. We solve Eq. 14-38b for DB,

As expected, the two efficiencies are the same, since we have assumed dynamic similarity. However, total dynamic 
similarity may not actually be achieved between the two turbines because of scale effects (larger turbines generally have 
higher efficiency). The diameter of the new turbine is about 38% greater than that of the existing turbine, so the increase in 
efficiency due to turbine size should not be very significant. We verify this by using the Moody efficiency correction 
equation, considering turbine A as the “model” and B as the “prototype”,

or 93.0%. So, the first-order correction yields a predicted efficiency for the larger turbine that is about half of a percent 
greater than the smaller turbine. However, as mentioned in the text, we expect only about 2/3 of this increase, or 2(0.5%)/3 
= 0.3%. Thus, our best estimate of the actual efficiency of the prototype is 
turbine B

Thus, our best estimate indicates that the new larger turbine will be slightly more efficient than its smaller brother, but the 
increase is only about 0.3%. 
 
Discussion 
If the flow entering the new turbine from the penstock were not similar to that of the existing turbine (e.g., 
velocity profile and turbulence intensity), we could not expect exact dynamic similarity.

From Fig. 14-108, both of these turbines are most likely Francis turbines. 
 
Discussion 
Since turbine A and turbine B operate at homologous points, it is no surprise that their turbine specific 
speeds are the same. In fact, if they weren’t the same, it would be a sure sign of an algebraic or calculation error.

where we have included an extra digit in the intermediate values to avoid round-off error. As expected, the two 
efficiencies are the same, since we have assumed dynamic similarity. However, total dynamic similarity may not 
actually be achieved between the two turbines because of scale effects (larger turbines generally have higher efficiency). 
The diameter of the new turbine is more than twice that of the existing turbine, so the increase in efficiency due to turbine 
size may be significant. We account for the size increase by using the Moody efficiency correction equation, considering 
turbine A as the “model” and B as the “prototype”,

or 80.0%. So, the first-order correction yields a predicted efficiency for the larger turbine that is about four percent greater 
than the smaller turbine. However, as mentioned in the text, we expect only about 2/3 of this increase, or 2(0.800 – 0.762)/3 
= 0.025 or 2.5%. Thus, our best estimate of the actual efficiency of the prototype is

The higher efficiency of the new larger turbine is significant because an increase in power production of 2.5% can lead to 
significant profits for the power company. 
 
Discussion 
If the flow entering the new turbine from the penstock were not similar to that of the existing turbine (e.g., 
velocity profile and turbulence intensity), we could not expect exact dynamic similarity.

Fundamentals, Grid Generation, and Boundary Conditions 
 
 
 
 
 
15-1C 
Solution 
We are to list the unknowns and the equations for a given flow situation.  
 
Analysis 
There are only three unknowns in this problem, u, v, and P (orP). Thus, we require three equations: 
continuity, x momentum (or x component of Navier-Stokes), and y momentum (or y component of Navier-Stokes). These 
equations, when combined with the appropriate boundary conditions, are sufficient to solve the problem. 
 
Discussion 
The actual equations to be solved by the computer are discretized versions of the differential equations. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
15-2C 
Solution 
We are to define several terms or phrases and provide examples.  
 
Analysis 
 
(a) A computational domain is a region in space (either 2-D or 3-D) in which the numerical equations of fluid flow 
are solved by CFD. The computational domain is bounded by edges (2-D) or faces (3-D) on which boundary 
conditions are applied. 
(b) A mesh is generated by dividing the computational domain into tiny cells. The numerical equations are then solved 
in each cell of the mesh. A mesh is also called a grid. 
(c) A transport equation is a differential equation representing how some property is transported through a flow 
field. The transport equations of fluid mechanics are conservation equations. For example, the continuity equation is a 
differential equation representing the transport of mass, and also conservation of mass. The Navier-Stokes equation is a 
differential equation representing the transport of linear momentum, and also conservation of linear momentum. 
(d) Equations are said to be coupled when at least one of the variables (unknowns) appears in more than one 
equation. In other words, the equations cannot be solved alone, but must be solved simultaneously with each other. 
This is the case with fluid mechanics since each component of velocity, for example, appears in the continuity equation 
and in all three components of the Navier-Stokes equation. 
 
Discussion 
Students’ definitions should be in their own words. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
15-3C 
Solution 
We are to discuss the difference between nodes and intervals and analyze a given computational domain in 
terms of nodes and intervals.

Nodes are points along an edge of a computational domain that represent the vertices of cells. In other 
words, they are the points where corners of the cells meet. Intervals, on the other hand, are short line segments between 
nodes. Intervals represent the small edges of cells themselves. In Fig. P15-3 there are 6 nodes and 5 intervals on the top 
and bottom edges. There are 5 nodes and 4 intervals on the left and right edges.  
 
Discussion 
We can extend the node and interval concept to three dimensions.

Solution 
For a given computational domain with specified nodes and intervals we are to compare a structured grid 
and an unstructured grid and discuss. 
 
Analysis 
We construct the two grids in the figure: (a) structured, and (b) unstructured. 
 
(a) 
(b) 
 
 There are 5  4 = 20 cells in the structured grid, and there are 36 cells in the unstructured grid. 
 
Discussion 
Depending on how individual students construct their unstructured grid, the shape, size, and number of cells 
may differ considerably. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
15-5C 
Solution 
For a given computational domain with specified nodes and intervals we are to compare a structured mesh 
and a polyhedral mesh and discuss. 
 
Analysis 
We construct the two grids in the figure: (a) structured, and (b) unstructured polyhedral. We show two other 
options in (c) and (d). There are many possible answers for the polyhedral mesh, depending on how large you want your 
cells to be. 
 
(a) 
(b) 
(c) 
(d) 
 
 
 
There are 5  4 = 20 cells in the structured grid. There are 22 cells in polyhedral grid (b). There are some cells with 3 sides, 
4 sides, and 5 sides, as required. Compared to the triangular mesh with 36 cells, we have reduced the cell count 
considerably. In (c) and (d), there are 21 cells and 18 cells respectively. In case (d) we have reduced the cell count below 
that of even the structured grid. In that case, 3 of the cells have 6 sides each. The cell reduction is particularly useful in 
large 3-D problems where CPU time and computer memory are important limitations. 
 
Discussion 
Note that the node distribution along the boundaries is identical in each case, but we have great flexibility in 
how we create the grid. Depending on how individual students construct their unstructured grid, the shape, size, and 
number of cells may differ considerably.

15-6C 
Solution 
We are to summarize the eight steps involved in a typical CFD analysis. 
 
Analysis 
We list the steps in the order presented in this chapter: 
 
1. Specify a computational domain and generate a grid. 
2. Specify boundary conditions on all edges or faces. 
3. Specify the type of fluid and its properties. 
4. Specify numerical parameters and solution algorithms. 
5. Apply initial conditions as a starting point for the iteration. 
6. Iterate towards a solution. 
7. After convergence, analyze the results (post processing). 
8. Calculate global and integral properties as needed. 
 
Discussion 
The order of some of the steps is interchangeable, particularly Steps 2 through 5. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
15-7C 
Solution 
We are to explain why the cylinder should not be centered horizontally in the computational domain.  
 
Analysis 
Flow separates over bluff bodies, generating a wake with reverse flow and eddies downstream of the 
body. There are no such problems upstream. Hence it is always wise to extend the downstream portion of the domain as far 
as necessary to avoid reverse flow problems at the outlet boundary. 
 
Discussion 
The same problems arise at the outlet of ducts and pipes – sometimes we need to extend the duct to avoid 
reverse flow at the outlet boundary. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
15-8C 
Solution 
We are to discuss the significance of several items with respect to iteration.  
 
Analysis 
 
(a) In a CFD solution, we typically iterate towards a solution. In order to get started, we make some initial conditions 
for all the variables (unknowns) in the problem. These initial conditions are wrong, of course, but they are necessary 
as a starting point. Then we begin the iteration process, eventually obtaining the solution. 
(b) A residual is a measure of how much our variables differ from the “exact” solution. We construct a residual by 
putting all the terms of a transport equation on one side, so that the terms all add to zero if the solution is correct. As 
we iterate, the terms will not add up to zero, and the remainder is called the residual. As the CFD solution iterates 
further, the residual should (hopefully) decrease. 
(c) Iteration is the numerical process of marching towards a final solution, beginning with initial conditions, and 
progressively correcting the solution. As the iteration proceeds, the variables converge to their final solution as the 
residuals decrease. 
(d) Once the CFD solution has converged, post processing is performed on the solution. Examples include plotting 
velocity and pressure fields, calculating global properties, generating other flow quantities like vorticity, etc. Post 
processing is performed after the CFD solution has been found, and does not change the results. Post processing is 
generally not as CPU intensive as the iterative process itself. 
 
Discussion 
We have assumed steady flow in the above discussions.

15-9C 
Solution 
We are to discuss how the iteration process is made faster.  
 
Analysis 
 
(a) With multigridding, solutions of the equations of motion are obtained on a coarse grid first, followed by 
successively finer grids. This speeds up convergence because the gross features of the flow are quickly established on 
the coarse grid, and then the iteration process on the finer grid requires less time. 
(b) In some CFD codes, a steady flow is treated as though it were an unsteady flow. Then, an artificial time is used to 
march the solution in time. Since the solution is steady, however, the solution approaches the steady-state solution as 
“time” marches on. In some cases, this technique yields faster convergence. 
 
Discussion 
There are other “tricks” to speed up the iteration process, but CFD solutions often take a long time to 
converge. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
15-10C 
Solution 
We are to list the boundary conditions that are applicable to a given edge, and we are to explain why other 
boundary conditions are not applicable. 
 
Analysis 
We may apply the following boundary conditions: outflow, pressure inlet, pressure outlet, symmetry (to 
be discussed), velocity inlet, and wall. The curved edge cannot be an axis because an axis must be a straight line.  The edge 
cannot be a fan or interior because such edges cannot be at the outer boundary of a computational domain. Finally, the 
edge cannot be periodic since there is no other edge along the boundary of the computational domain that is of 
identical shape (a periodic boundary must have a “partner”). The symmetry boundary condition merits further discussion. 
Numerically, gradients of flow variables in the direction normal to a symmetry boundary condition are set to zero, and there 
is no mathematical reason why the curved right edge of the present computational domain cannot be set as symmetry. 
However, you would be hard pressed to think of a physical situation in which a curved edge like that of Fig. P15-9 would 
be a valid symmetry boundary condition. 
 
Discussion 
Just because you can set a boundary condition and generate a CFD result does not guarantee that the result 
is physically meaningful. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
15-11C 
Solution 
We are to discuss the standard method to test for adequate grid resolution. 
 
Analysis 
The standard method to test for adequate grid resolution is to increase the resolution (by a factor of 2 in all 
directions if feasible) and repeat the simulation. If the results do not change appreciably, the original grid is deemed 
adequate. If, on the other hand, there are significant differences between the two solutions, the original grid is likely of 
inadequate resolution. In such a case, an even finer grid should be tried until the grid is adequately resolved. 
 
Discussion 
Keep in mind that if the boundary conditions are not specified properly, or if the chosen turbulence model is 
not appropriate for the flow being simulated by CFD, no amount of grid refinement is going to make the solution more 
physically correct.

Solution 
We are to discuss the difference between a pressure inlet boundary condition and a velocity inlet boundary 
condition, and we are to explain why both pressure and velocity cannot be specified on the same boundary.  
 
Analysis 
At a pressure inlet we specify the pressure but not the velocity. At a velocity inlet we specify the 
opposite – velocity but not pressure. To specify both pressure and velocity would lead to mathematical over-
specification, since pressure and velocity are coupled in the equations of motion. When pressure is specified at a 
pressure inlet (or outlet), the CFD code automatically adjusts the velocity at that boundary. In a similar manner, when 
velocity is specified at a velocity inlet, the CFD code adjusts the pressure at that boundary. 
 
Discussion 
Since pressure and velocity are coupled, specification of both at a boundary would lead to inconsistencies in 
the equations of motion at that boundary. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
15-13C 
Solution 
We are to label all the boundary conditions to be applied to a computational domain.  
 
Analysis 
The inlet is a velocity inlet. The outlet is a pressure outlet. All other edges that define the outer limits of the 
computational domain are walls. Finally, there are three edges that must be specified as interior. These are all labeled in the 
figure below.

Discussion 
It is critical that each boundary condition be specified carefully. Otherwise the CFD solution will not be 
correct. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
15-14C 
Solution 
We are to analyze what will happen to inlet pressure and outlet velocity when a fan is turned on in the 
computational domain of the previous problem.  
 
Analysis 
Since the fan helps to push air through the channel, the inlet pressure will adjust itself so that less inlet 
pressure is required. In other words, the inlet pressure will decrease when the fan is turned on. Since the inlet velocity is 
the same in both cases, the mass flow rate (and volume flow rate since the flow is incompressible) must remain the same 
for either case. Therefore, outlet velocity will not change. 
 
Discussion 
It may seem at first glance that Vout should increase because of the fan, but in order to conserve mass, the 
outlet velocity cannot change. The solution is constrained by the specified inlet boundary condition. In a real physical 
experiment, there is no such restriction. The fan would cause the inlet pressure to decrease, the inlet velocity to increase, 
and the outlet velocity to increase.

Solution 
We are to list and briefly describe six boundary conditions, and we are to give an example of each.  
 
Analysis 
In the chapter we list ten, so any six of these will suffice: 
 
 
Axis: Used in axisymmetric flows as the axis of rotation. Example: the axis of a torpedo-shaped body. 
 
Fan: An internal edge (2-D) or face (3-D) across which a sudden pressure rise is specified. Example: an axial flow 
fan in a duct. 
 
Interior: An internal edge (2-D) or face (3-D) across which nothing special happens – the interior boundary 
condition is used at the interface between two blocks. Example: all of the multiblock problems in this chapter, 
which require this boundary condition at the interface between any two blocks. 
 
Outflow: An outlet boundary condition in which the gradient of fluid properties is zero normal to the outflow 
boundary. Outflow is typically useful far away from the object or area of interest in a flow field. Example: the far 
field of flow over a body. 
 
Periodic: When the physical geometry has periodicity, the periodic boundary condition is used to specify that 
whatever passes through one face of the periodic pair must simultaneously enter the other face of the periodic pair. 
Example: in a heat exchanger where there are several rows of tubes. 
 
Pressure inlet: An inflow boundary in which pressure (but not velocity) is known and specified across the face. 
Example: the high pressure settling chamber of a blow-down wind tunnel facility. 
 
Pressure outlet: An outflow boundary in which pressure (but not velocity) is known and specified across the face. 
Example: the outlet of a pipe exposed to atmospheric pressure. 
 
Symmetry: A face over which the gradients of all flow variables are set to zero normal to the face – the result is a 
mirror image across the symmetry plane. Fluid cannot flow through a symmetry plane. Example: the mid-plane of 
flow over a circular cylinder in which the lower half is a mirror image of the upper half. 
 
Velocity inlet: An inflow boundary condition in which velocity (but not pressure) is known and specified across 
the face. Example: a uniform freestream inlet flow entering a computational domain from one side. 
 
Wall: A boundary through which fluid cannot pass and at which the no-slip condition (or a shear stress condition) 
is applied. Example: the surface of an airfoil that is being modeled by CFD. 
 
Discussion 
There are additional boundary conditions used in CFD calculations, but these are the only ones discussed in 
this chapter.

Solution 
We are to sketch a structured and an unstructured grid near the airfoil surface, and discuss advantages and 
disadvantages of each.  
 
Analysis 
In either case it is wise to cluster cells close to the airfoil surface since we expect that a thin boundary layer 
will exist along the surface, and we need many tiny cells within the boundary layer to adequately resolve it. Some simple, 
coarse meshes are drawn in Fig. 1. We would certainly want much higher resolution for CFD calculations. 
 
(a) 
(b) 
 
The structured grid in Fig 1a is called a C-grid since it wraps around the airfoil like the letter “C”. The main advantage of 
the structured grid is that we can get high resolution near the surface with few cells. The main advantage of the unstructured 
grid is that it is somewhat easier to generate when the geometry is complicated (especially for highly curved surfaces). 
Furthermore, it is easier to transition between curved and straight edges with an unstructured grid. The main disadvantage 
of an unstructured grid is that more cells are required for the same spatial resolution. 
 
Discussion 
There are numerous other ways to construct a grid around this airfoil. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
15-17 
Solution 
We are to sketch a hybrid grid around an airfoil and explain its advantages.  
 
Analysis 
We sketch a hybrid grid in the figure. Note that the grid is 
structured near the airfoil surface, but unstructured beyond the surface. The 
advantage of a hybrid grid is that it combines the advantages of both 
structured and unstructured grids. Near surfaces we can use a structured 
grid to finely resolve the boundary layer with a minimum number of cells, 
and away from surfaces we can use an unstructured grid so that we can 
rapidly expand the cell size. We can also more easily blend the grid into the 
edges of the computational domain with an unstructured grid.  
 
Discussion 
A structured grid is generally the best choice, but a hybrid grid is often a better option than a fully 
unstructured grid.

unstructured (b) grid. Notice that 
the cells are clustered (more fine) 
near the surface of the airfoil since 
there is likely to be large velocity 
gradients there (in the boundary 
layer).

Solution 
We are to sketch the blocking for a structured grid, sketch a coarse grid, and label all the boundary 
conditions to be applied to the computational domain.  
 
Analysis 
First of all, we recognize that because of symmetry, we can split the domain in half vertically. We construct 
four blocks around the half-cylinder to transform from round to square, and then we add simple rectangular blocks 
upstream and downstream of the cylinder (Fig. 1). There is a total of six blocks. 
 
With the block structure of Fig. 1 no cells are highly skewed, and cells are clustered near the cylinder wall and the upper 
wall of the duct as desired. 
 
The bottom edge of the computational domain is a line of symmetry. The inlet is a velocity inlet. The outlet is a 
pressure outlet. The upper edge of the computational domain is a wall. The edges that define the cylinder are also walls. 
Finally, there are 5 edges that are specified as interior. These are all labeled in Fig. 2. 
 
Discussion 
There are alternative ways to set up the blocking topology. For example, at the top we may define a thin 
block (Block 7) that stretches across the entire horizontal domain so that the boundary layer on the top wall of the channel 
can be more adequately resolved (Fig. 3).

Solution 
We are to sketch the blocking for a structured grid, sketch a coarse grid, and label all the boundary 
conditions to be applied to the computational domain.  
 
Analysis 
First of all, we recognize that because of symmetry, we can split the domain in half vertically. We construct 
four blocks inside the half-circle, and then we add blocks with one curved edge and three straight edges upstream and 
downstream of the cylinder (Fig. 1). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The setup of Fig. 1 contains six blocks. With this block structure, no cells are highly skewed, and cells are clustered near 
upper wall of the duct as desired. Cells are also clustered at the junctions between Blocks 1 and 2 and Blocks 4 and 6, 
where flow separation may occur. 
 
The bottom edge of the computational domain is a line of symmetry. The inlet is a velocity inlet. The outlet is a 
pressure outlet. The upper edge of the computational domain is a wall. The edges that define the cylinder are also walls. 
Finally, there are 5 edges that are specified as interior. These are all labeled in Fig. 2.

Solution 
We are to modify an existing grid so that all blocks are elementary blocks. Then we are to verify that the 
total number of cells does not change. 
 
Analysis 
The right edge of Block 2 of Fig. 15-11b is split twice to accommodate Block 1. We therefore split Block 2 
into three separate elementary blocks. Unfortunately, this process ends up splitting Block 6 twice, which in turn splits 
Block 4 twice. We end up with 12 elementary blocks as shown in Fig. 1. 
 
We add up all the cells in these 12 blocks – we get a total of 464 cells. This agrees with the total of 464 cells for the original 
6 blocks in the domain. 
 
Discussion 
Sometimes it is easier to create a grid with elementary blocks, even if the CFD code can accept blocks with 
split edges or faces. 
 
 
 
 
 
15-21 
Solution 
We are to modify an existing grid into a smaller number of non- elementary blocks, and we are to verify 
that the total number of cells does not change. 
 
Analysis 
We combine Blocks 2, 3, 4, and 5 of Fig. 15-10b. Together, these produce one structured grid that wraps 
around the square in the middle – there are still 5 i intervals, but now there are 48 j intervals. We end up with 3 non-
elementary blocks, as shown in Fig. 1. 
 
We add up all the cells in these 12 blocks – we get a total of 464 cells. This agrees with the total of 464 cells for the original 
6 blocks in the domain.

Solution 
We are to generate a computational domain and label all appropriate boundary conditions for one stage of a 
new heat exchanger design. 
 
Analysis 
We take advantage of the periodicity of the geometry. There are several ways to create a periodic grid for 
this flow. The simplest computational domain consists of a single flow passage between two neighboring tubes. We can 
make the periodic edge intercept anywhere on the front portion of the tube that we desire. We choose the lower surface for 
convenience and simplicity. The periodic computational domain is sketched in Fig. 1. 
 
Boundary conditions are also straightforward, and are labeled in Fig. 1. For a known inlet velocity we set the 
boundary condition at the left edge as a velocity inlet. The tube walls are obviously set as walls. The outlet can be set as 
either a pressure outlet or an outflow, depending on the provided information and how far the outlet region extends 
beyond the tubes. Finally, we set two pairs of translationally periodic boundaries, one fore and one aft of the tubes. We 
label them separately to avoid confusion. 
 
 
 
Discussion 
The fore and aft periodic edges are not horizontal in Fig. 1. This is not a problem since the periodic 
boundary condition is not restricted to horizontal or even to flat surfaces. An alternative, equally acceptable computational 
domain is shown in Fig. 2.

Solution 
We are to sketch a structured multiblock grid with four-sided elementary blocks for a given computational 
domain. 
 
Analysis 
We choose the computational domain of Fig. 1 of the previous problem. Since all edges are straight, the 
blocking scheme can be rather simple. We sketch the blocking topology and apply a coarse mesh in Fig. 1 for the case in 
which the CFD code does not require the node distribution to be exactly the same on periodic pairs. 
 
 
Unfortunately, many CFD codes require that the node distribution on periodic pairs of edges be identical (the two edges of 
a periodic pair are “linked” in the grid generation process). In such a case, the grid of Fig. 1 would not be acceptable. 
Furthermore, although the edges of the blocks of Fig. 1 are not split with respect to adjacent blocks, the top edges of Block 
1 and Block 3 are split with respect to the boundary conditions (part of the edge is periodic and part is a wall). Thus these 
blocks are not really elementary blocks after all. We construct a more elaborate blocking topology in Fig. 2 to correct these 
problems. The node distribution on the edges of each periodic pair are identical, at the expense of more complexity (7 
instead of 5 blocks) and more cell skewness. 
 
Discussion 
Some of the cells have moderate skewness with the blocking topology of Fig. 2, especially near the corners 
of Block 2 and Block 7 and throughout Block 5. A more complicated topology can be devised to reduce the amount of 
skewness.

Solution 
We are to discuss why there is reverse flow in this CFD calculation, and then we are to explain what can be 
done to correct the problem. 
 
Analysis 
Reverse flow at an outlet is usually an indication that the computational domain is not large enough. 
In this case the rectangular heat exchanger tubes are inclined at 35o, and the flow will most certainly separate, leaving large 
recirculating eddies in the wakes. Anita should extend the computational domain in the horizontal direction 
downstream so that the eddies have a chance to “close” and the flow has a chance to re-develop into a flow without any 
reverse flow. 
 
Discussion 
In most commercial CFD codes a warning will pop up on the computer monitor whenever there is reverse 
flow at an outlet. This is usually an indication that the computational domain should be enlarged.

Solution 
We are to generate a computational domain and label all appropriate boundary conditions for two stages of 
a heat exchanger. 
 
Analysis 
We look for the smallest computational domain that takes advantage of the periodicity of the geometry. 
There are several ways to create a periodic grid for this flow. The simplest computational domain consists of a single flow 
passage between two neighboring tubes. We can make the periodic edge intercept anywhere on the fore and aft portions of 
the heat exchanger that we desire. We choose the periodic computational domain sketched in Fig. 1. 
 
Boundary conditions are also straightforward, and are labeled in Fig. 1. For a known inlet velocity we set the 
boundary condition at the left edge as a velocity inlet. The tube walls are obviously set as walls. The outlet can be set as 
either a pressure outlet or an outflow, depending on the provided information and how far the outlet region extends 
beyond the tubes. Finally, we set three pairs of translationally periodic boundaries, one fore, one mid, and one aft of the 
tubes. We label them separately to avoid confusion. 
 
Discussion 
Many other equally acceptable computational domains are possible.

Solution 
We are to sketch a structured multiblock grid with four-sided elementary blocks for a given computational 
domain. 
 
Analysis 
We choose the computational domain of Fig. 1 of the previous problem. We sketch one possible elementary 
blocking topology in Fig. 1 for the case in which the CFD code requires the node distribution to be exactly the same on 
periodic pairs. We also assume that we cannot split one periodic edge and not its partner. The blocks are numbered. This 
topology has 16 elementary blocks. 
 
 
 
Note that with this blocking topology we had to split the periodic “mid” boundary pair into two edges (the tops of blocks 6 
and 7 and the bottoms of blocks 9 and 10). As long as both pairs of each segment are the same size and have the same 
number of nodes, this is not a problem. In the CFD code we would have to name each periodic pair separately, however. 
The block numbers are labeled. Notice that most of the blocks are nearly rectangular such that none of the computational 
cells would have to be highly skewed. 
 
Discussion 
This seems like a rather complicated blocking topology. It would require a bit of work to generate the grid. 
However, the time spent on developing a good grid is usually well worth the effort.  By reducing the amount of cell 
skewness, we are able to speed up the CFD calculations and obtain more accurate results. This kind of topology also 
enables us to cluster cells near walls and wakes as needed.

blocking topology applies to CFD codes that 
do not allow a block’s edges to be split for 
application of boundary conditions, and 
requires periodic edge pairs to have identical 
node distributions.

General CFD Problems 
 
 
 
 
15-27 
Solution 
We are to generate three different coarse grids for the same 
geometry and node distribution, and then compare the cell count and grid 
quality. 
 
Analysis 
The three meshes are shown in Fig. 1. The node distributions 
along the edges of the computational domain are identical in all three cases, 
and no smoothing of the mesh is performed. The structured multi-block 
mesh is shown in Fig. 1a. We split the domain into four blocks for 
convenience, and to achieve cells with minimal skewing. There are 1060 
cells. The unstructured triangular mesh is shown in Fig. 1b. There is only 
one block, and it contains 1996 cells. The unstructured quad mesh is shown 
in Fig. 1c. It has 833 cells in its one block. Comparing the three meshes, the 
triangular unstructured mesh has too many cells. The unstructured quad 
mesh has the least number of cells, but the clustering of cells occurs in 
undesirable locations, such as at the outlets on the right. The structured quad 
mesh seems to be the best choice for this geometry – it has only about 27% 
more cells than the unstructured quad mesh, but we have much more control 
on the clustering of the cells. Skewness is not a problem with any of the 
meshes. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Discussion 
Depending on the grid generation software and the specified node distribution, students will get a variety of 
results.

Solution 
We are to run a laminar CFD calculation of flow through a wye, calculate the pressure drop and how the 
flow splits between the two branches. 
 
Analysis 
We choose the structured grid for our CFD calculations. 
The back pressure at both outlets is set to zero gage pressure, and the 
average pressure at the inlet is calculated to be -8.74  10-5 Pa. The 
pressure drop through the wye is thus only 8.74  10-5 Pa (a negligible 
pressure drop). The streamlines are shown in Fig. 1. For this case, 57.8% 
of the flow goes out the upper branch, and 42.2% goes out the lower 
branch.  
 
Discussion 
There appears to be some tendency for the flow to 
separate at the upper left corner of the branch, but there is no reverse flow 
at the outlet of either branch. This case is compared to a turbulent flow 
case in the following problem. 
 
 
 
 
15-29 
Solution 
We are to run a turbulent CFD calculation of flow through a wye, calculate the pressure drop and how the 
flow splits between the two branches. 
 
Analysis 
We choose the structured grid for our CFD calculations. 
The back pressure at both outlets is set to zero gage pressure, and the 
average pressure at the inlet is calculated to be -3.295 Pa. The pressure 
drop through the wye is thus 3.295 Pa (a significantly higher pressure 
drop than that of the laminar flow, although we note that the inlet 
velocity for the laminar flow case was 0.002 times that of the turbulent 
flow case). The streamlines are shown in Fig. 1. For this case, 54.4% of 
the flow goes out the upper branch, and 45.6% goes out the lower 
branch. Compared to the laminar case, a greater percentage of the flow 
goes out the lower branch for the turbulent case. The streamlines at first 
look similar, but a closer look reveals that the spacing between 
streamlines in the turbulent case is more uniform, indicating that the 
velocity distribution is also more uniform (more “full”), as is expected 
for turbulent flow. 
 
Discussion 
There appears to be some tendency for the flow to separate at the upper left corner of the branch, but there 
is no reverse flow at the outlet of either branch.

Review Problems 
 
 
 
15-44C 
Solution 
 
(a) False: If the boundary conditions are not correct, if the computational domain is not large enough, etc., the solution can 
be erroneous and nonphysical no matter how fine the grid. 
(b) True: Each component of the Navier-Stokes equation is a transport equation. 
(c) True: The four-sided cells of a 2-D structured grid require less cells than do the triangular cells of a 2-D unstructured 
grid. (Note however, that some unstructured cells can be four-sided as well as three-sided.) 
(d) True: Turbulence models are approximations of the physics of a turbulent flow, and unfortunately are not universal in 
their application. 
 
 
 
 
 
15-45C 
Solution 
We are to discuss right-left symmetry as applied to a CFD simulation and to a potential flow solution.  
 
Analysis 
In the time-averaged CFD simulation, we are not concerned about top-bottom fluctuations or periodicity. 
Thus, top-bottom symmetry can be assumed. However, fluid flows do not have upstream-downstream symmetry in general, 
even if the geometry is perfectly symmetric fore and aft. In the problem at hand for example, the flow in the channel 
develops downstream. Also, the flow exiting the left channel enters the circular settling chamber like a jet, separating at the 
sharp corner. At the opposite end, fluid leaves the settling chamber and enters the duct more like an inlet flow, without 
significant flow separation. We certainly cannot expect fore-aft symmetry in a flow such as this. 
 
On the other hand, potential flow of a symmetric geometry yields a symmetric flow, so it would be okay to cut our 
grid in half, invoking fore-aft symmetry. 
 
Discussion 
If unsteady or oscillatory effects were important, we should not even specify top-bottom symmetry in this 
kind of flow field.

15-46C 
Solution 
We are to discuss improvements to the given computational domain.  
 
Analysis 
(a) Since Gerry is not interested in unsteady fluctuations (which may be unsymmetric), he could eliminate 
half of the domain. In other words, he could assume that the axis is a plane of symmetry between the top and bottom 
of the channel. Gerry’s grid would be cut in size by a factor of two, leading to approximately half the required CPU time, 
but yielding virtually identical results. 
 
(b) The fundamental flaw is that the outflow boundary is not far enough downstream. There will likely be flow 
separation at the corners of the sudden contraction. With a duct that is only about three duct heights long, it is possible that 
there will be reverse flow at the outlet. Even if there is no reverse flow, the duct is nowhere near long enough for the flow 
to achieve fully developed conditions. Gerry should extend the outlet duct by many duct heights to allow the flow to 
develop downstream and to avoid possible reverse flow problems. 
 
Discussion 
The inlet appears to be perhaps too short as well. If Gerry specifies a fully developed channel flow velocity 
profile at the inlet, his results may be okay, but again it is better to extend the duct many duct heights beyond what Gerry 
has included in his computational domain. 
 
 
 
 
 
15-47C 
Solution 
We are to discuss a feature of modern computer systems for which nearly equal size multiblock grids are 
desirable. 
 
Analysis 
The fastest computers are multi-processor computers. In other words, the computer system contains more 
than one CPU – a parallel computer. Modern parallel computers may combine 32, 64, 128, or more CPUs or nodes, all 
working together. In such a situation it is natural to let each node operate on one block. If all the nodes are identical (equal 
speed and equal RAM), the system is most efficient if the blocks are of similar size. 
 
Discussion 
In such a situation there must be communication between the nodes. At the interface between blocks, for 
example, information must pass during the CFD iteration process. 
 
 
 
 
 
15-48C 
Solution 
We are to discuss the difference between multigridding and multiblocking, and we are to discuss how they 
may be used to speed up a CFD calculation. Then we are to discuss whether multigridding and multiblocking can be 
applied together. 
 
Analysis 
Multigridding has to do with the resolution of an established grid during CFD calculations. With 
multigridding, solutions of the equations of motion are obtained on a coarse grid first, followed by successively finer 
grids. This speeds up convergence because the gross features of the flow are quickly established on the coarse grid (which 
takes less CPU time), and then the iteration process on the finer grid requires less time. 
 
Multiblocking is something totally different. It refers to the creation of two or more separate blocks or zones, 
each with its own grid. The grids from all the blocks collectively create the overall grid. As discussed in the previous 
problem, multiblocking can have some speed advantages if using a parallel-processing computer. In addition, some CFD 
calculations would require too much RAM if the entire computational domain were one large block. In such cases, the grid 
can be split into multiple blocks, and the CFD code works on one block at a time. This requires less RAM, although 
information from the dormant blocks must be stored on disk or solid state memory chips, and then swapped into and out of 
the computer’s RAM. 
 
There is no reason why multigridding cannot be used on each block separately. Thus, multigridding and 
multiblocking can be used together. 
 
Discussion 
Although all the swapping in and out requires more CPU time and I/O time, for large grids multiblocking 
can sometimes mean the difference between being able to run and not being able to run at all.

Solution 
We are to discuss why we should spend a lot of time developing a multiblock structured grid when we 
could just use an unstructured grid.  
 
Analysis 
There are several reasons why a structured grid is “better” than an unstructured grid, even for a case in 
which the CFD code can handle unstructured grids. First of all the structured grid can be made to have better resolution 
with fewer cells than the unstructured grid. This is important if computer memory and CPU time are of concern. 
Depending on the CFD code, the solution may converge more rapidly with a structured grid, and the results may be 
more accurate. In addition, by creating multiple blocks, we can more easily cluster cells in certain blocks and locations 
where high resolution is necessary, since we have much more control over the final grid with a structured grid. 
 
Discussion 
As mentioned in this chapter, time spent creating a good grid is usually time well spent.

Solution 
We are to calculate laminar flow into a 2-D slot, compare with irrotational flow theory, and with results of 
the previous problem, and discuss the vorticity field. 
 
Assumptions 1 The flow is steady and 2-D. 2 The flow is laminar.  
 
Analysis 
The flow field does not change much from the previous problem, except that a thin boundary layer shows 
up along the floor. The vorticity is confined to a region close to the floor – vorticity is negligibly small everywhere else, so 
the irrotational flow approximation is appropriate everywhere except close to the floor. 
 
Discussion 
The irrotational flow approximation is very useful for suction-type flows, as in air pollution control 
applications (hoods, etc.).

Solution 
 We are to model the flow of air into a vacuum cleaner using CFD, and we are to compare the results to 
those obtained with the potential flow approximation. 
 
Analysis 
We must include a second length scale in the problem, 
namely the width w of the vacuum nozzle. For the CFD calculations, we 
set w = 2.0 mm and place the inlet plane of the vacuum nozzle at b = 2.0 
cm above the floor (Fig. 1). Only half of the flow is modeled since we 
can impose a symmetry boundary condition along the y-axis. We use the 
same volumetric suction flow rate as in the example problem, i.e., 
/
0.314
L 
V
 m2/s, but in the CFD analysis we specify only half of this 
value since we are modeling half of the flow field. 
 
Results of the CFD calculations are shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2a 
shows a view of streamlines in the entire computational plane. Clearly, 
the streamlines far from the inlet of the nozzle appear as rays into the 
origin; from “far away” the flow feels the effect of the vacuum nozzle in 
the same way as it would feel a line sink. In Fig. 2b is shown a close-up 
view of these same streamlines. Qualitatively, the streamlines appear 
similar to those predicted by the irrotational flow approximation. In Fig 
2c we plot contours of the magnitude of vorticity. Since irrotationality is 
defined by zero vorticity, these vorticity contours indicate where the 
irrotational flow approximation is valid – namely in regions where the 
magnitude of vorticity is negligibly small.

We see from Fig. 2c that vorticity is negligibly small everywhere in the flow field 
except close to the floor, along the vacuum nozzle wall, near the inlet of the nozzle, and inside the nozzle duct. In these

regions, net viscous forces are not small and fluid particles rotate as they move; the irrotational flow approximation is not 
valid in these regions. Nevertheless, it appears that the irrotational flow approximation is valid throughout the majority of 
the flow field. Finally, the pressure coefficient predicted by the irrotational flow approximation is compared to that 
calculated by CFD in Fig. 2d. 
 
Discussion 
For x* greater than about 2, the agreement is excellent. However, the irrotational flow approximation is not 
very reliable close to the nozzle inlet. Note that the irrotational flow prediction that the minimum pressure occurs at x*  1 
is verified by CFD.

Solution 
 We are to compare CFD calculations of flow into a vacuum cleaner for the case of laminar flow versus the 
inviscid flow approximation. 
 
Analysis 
Students will have varied results, depending on the grid generation code, CFD code, turbulence model, and 
their choice of computational domain, etc. 
 
Discussion 
Instructors can add more details to the problem statement, if desired, to ensure consistency among the 
students’ results.
