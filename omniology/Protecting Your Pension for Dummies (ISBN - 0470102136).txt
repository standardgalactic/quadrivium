About the Authors
Robert D. Gary and Jori Bloom Naegele first began representing pensioners
in 1986. Since that time, they and their law firm, Gary, Naegele & Theado, LLC,
located in Lorain, Ohio, have represented more than ten thousand pension-
ers. Most of these claims were handled through class action lawsuits where
pensioners across the country sought recovery from their respective pension
plans for underpayments of their pension benefits. These cases have
returned tens of millions of dollars that the retirees should have received
when they first retired. Their pension class actions have resulted in decisions
establishing important legal precedents benefiting pensioners nationwide.
Bob has a JD from Case Western Reserve University School of Law and an
LLM from New York University School of Law. He has been in private practice
for the last 25-plus years. He started his legal career in the United States
Department of Justice in the Organized Crime and Racketeering Section,
where he got his first taste of how vulnerable pensions can be to manipula-
tion. He was a Special Assistant to the Governor of Ohio as well as an
Assistant County Prosecutor. He has been recognized throughout the years,
having received a United States Department of Justice Special Achievement
Award for sustained superior performance, a personal commendation from
the Director of the FBI for trial performance, a proclamation from the Ohio
Office of the Governor recognizing him as an outstanding citizen of Ohio, and
special recognition from the Ohio General Assembly for a unique class action
settlement that resulted in the distribution of free food to a million needy
families in Northern Ohio. He has lectured and published articles in legal
publications on class action–related topics.
Jori received her JD from Case Western Reserve University School of Law in
1979, and she’s been an advocate of retirement issues for most of her legal
career. In addition to representing pensioners, she’s also advocated on behalf
of all employees, helping to secure not only retirement benefits but safer and
hostile-free workplace environments. She has donated her time and skill to
helping seniors and others through her pro bono work and has been actively
involved in her professional community as well. She has served as the presi-
dent of her local bar association, as a mediator for the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and state and federal court, and has pub-
lished articles and lectured on a variety of legal topics. She was appointed 
by a former Ohio Attorney General to its office’s Ethics and Professional
Responsibility Advisory Counsel and was recognized for her service on the
Ohio Supreme Court’s Task Force on Gender Fairness.

Over the years, Bob and Jori’s experience has shown them repeatedly that
there is a wide gap between the knowledge of those who administer pension
plans and those who depend on them for their financial security. Attempting
to close that gap was the inspiration for this book. They realized that if ever
there was a time for a book on planning for and protecting retirement bene-
fits, it is now because the Pension Protection Act of 2006 has turned the gap
of information into a chasm. It’s their hope that with this book pensioners
will be better equipped to deal with the rules regarding their own pensions
and be able to ask the right questions of the professionals, whether they be
attorneys, accountants, or financial advisors.
Bob and Jori have practiced law together for almost 25 years. They invite you
to visit their firm’s Web site at www.gntlaw.com or e-mail them at office@

Lorain, Ohio 44052, and the phone number is 440-244-4809.

Dedication
Bob: I was laboring over some ERISA rules when my nine-year-old grandson
Asher sat down next to me and read what I was writing. In Asher’s best dead-
pan, he said, “I have to get this book.” This book is dedicated to a special
group of future pensioners who have yet to enter the workforce — my grand-
children, Asher, Andrew, and Olivia Belle — with the expectation that at some
time they will read some future edition of this book.
Jori: This book is dedicated to my children, Michael and Sydney, with the
hope that they’ll one day soon be a part of the working world, that they’ll
love their work, and that they’ll be armed with the right balance of knowl-
edge, information, and compassion to make the right choices in life.
Authors’ Acknowledgments
Our thanks goes to all those at Wiley Publishing, Inc., who allowed us to share
our vision of this book and who helped make this project a reality. First of all,
we’d like to thank our friend Roy Kaufman, one of Wiley’s talented attorneys,
whose advice and direction helped give birth to the proposal of this For
Dummies book. Special thanks to Acquisitions Editor Lindsay Lefevere, whose
ideas, suggestions, and guidance were always helpful and insightful, and to
Project Editor Georgette Beatty, who shepherded us through the writing process
and always kept us on task. Thanks also to Copy Editors Jessica Smith and Vicki
Adang for their fine editing and to University of Alabama School of Law profes-
sor Norman Stein, our technical reviewer. Our sincere thanks to Composition
Services and to everyone at Wiley for their roles in getting this book to press.
In addition to the folks at Wiley, we’d also like to extend thanks to Aileen
Fonda, our secretary at Gary, Naegele & Theado, LLC, for all her help with
this book and to the rest of our office as well, for making sure our office con-
tinued to function during our occasional and not-so-occasional absences. To
our family and friends, thanks for your support throughout this project. We
know you’re as excited as we are to see this book come to fruition.
We’d especially like to thank Jori’s husband, attorney Richard Naegele, a Fellow
of the American College of Employee Benefits Counsel and pension-guru extraor-
dinaire, for spending countless hours with us reviewing text, sharing his wisdom,
and debating the finer points of pension law. Dick’s pension expertise, including
teaching hundreds of pension seminars, drafting of plan documents, and author-
ing numerous articles for pension and tax journals, enabled him to help us zero
in on the really important stuff, and we are grateful for all his assistance. It also
made for some interesting and lively conversations at the dinner table, and Jori
is truly appreciative of Dick’s patience and support for going above and beyond.
Bob extends his gratitude and appreciation to his wife, Karen, whose gentle
prodding and encouragement kept him on schedule and anchored.

Introduction
T
here are no pension superheroes or TV shows featuring exciting pension
stories. And people don’t go around telling lots of rip-roaring pension
jokes or pithy anecdotes. Yet pensions may be the single most important and
least understood subject in the country. You’re reading these words at a time
when pensioners face a critical turning point for the future of pensions as
they have traditionally existed in this country. On August 17, 2006, the
Pension Protection Act of 2006 became law. These more than 800 pages of leg-
islation will leave no pension plan untouched.
You have chosen to come to grips with your retirement, and hopefully you
understand that knowing the rules of the game is the only way to protect
your pension. This book is a partnership; you have done your part by picking
it up. As far as our part is concerned, we hope that we can help unravel the
tangle of rules that control your pensions. Time and time again as we com-
pleted this book, critics told us that no one wants to read about pensions.
You’ve already proved that theory wrong.
The reason to read this book is the same reason that we wrote it. Our goals
and your goals are one and the same. We both want to close the knowledge
gap that exists between those who control pensions and those who receive
them. Without the basic framework to understand what your plan can and
can’t do, it’s impossible to know whether to laugh or to cry. We give you the
basic tools to understand your rights, know what questions to ask (and when
to ask them), and where to find the answers. And if your employer hands you
a bag of lemons instead of the pension you were expecting, we explain how to
fight back and turn your lemons into lemonade.
About This Book
You’ve worked hard to earn your pension benefits, and we want to help you
keep them. We cover it all, from start to finish, in this one book. We explain
the basics about different types of retirement plans, the rules that apply to
them, and how to request essential plan documents so you can ensure that
you truly get the pension you deserve. We discuss the different workplace sit-
uations that can potentially put your plan in jeopardy or affect your ultimate
payout. These situations include events such as when your employer merges
with another company or sells its business or when you terminate employ-
ment. We also explain the personal issues, such as divorce and bankruptcy,
that you need to look out for when trying to protect your pension.

This book also tells you what to do and how to do it when you don’t get the
pension amount that was promised to you. For example, we take you through
the administrative appeal process so that you know what you need to do to
continue to protect your benefits. If you lose at this point, we walk you
through the litigation process and even give you some pointers on how to
select the right attorney to protect your interests.
As valuable a resource as this book may be, it only skims the surface of an
extremely technical topic. Everyone’s circumstances are different, so it’s pos-
sible that your situation may result in a conclusion that’s different from the
one that we suggest in this book. In other words, don’t assume that just
because you read it here that we’re telling you, personally, what to do. Pension
law involves rules and regulations, statutes and court decisions, IRS determi-
nation letters, and decisions of plan administrators, and they’re all subject to
potentially different interpretations. So, we can’t provide answers to your 
specific questions, but we can suggest ways to help you find out more about a
particular topic. We provide resources when we can so that when you need 
to seek expert advice (which we all do from time to time), you can do so in a
more educated way. What’s most important, however, is that you can identify
the issues that are essential to successfully protecting your pension.
Feel free to use this book as a reference when you want to find out more
about a particular topic, but if you prefer, you can sit down and read the book
cover to cover.
Conventions Used in This Book
We include a few conventions to help you navigate this book with ease:
 Boldfaced words highlight the key words in bulleted lists and numbered
steps.
 Italics emphasize key words and important terms.
 Monofont indicates Web addresses.
When this book was printed, some Web addresses may have needed to break
across two lines of text. If that happened, rest assured that we haven’t put in
any extra characters (such as hyphens) to indicate the break. So, when using
one of these Web addresses, just type in exactly what you see in this book,
pretending as though the line break doesn’t exist.

What You’re Not to Read
Feel free to skip anything marked with the Technical Stuff icon; those gems
are interesting but not crucial to your understanding of pensions. The same
goes for sidebars (the shaded gray boxes throughout the book).
Foolish Assumptions
When writing this book, we kept a few assumptions in mind about you, dear
reader:
 You’re nearing retirement or have already retired.
 You may be an employer, a human resources professional, or a plan
administrator.
 You may be a pension attorney looking for more information to provide
to your clients.
 You may be a small business owner who can appreciate these issues
from the perspective of employer and employee.
 You may be a financial advisor interested in understanding today’s 
pension issues from the perspective of the retiree.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is organized into seven parts, starting with the big picture and
then honing in on different subject areas as they relate to retirement plan
protection.
Part I: Focusing on Pension Fundamentals
This part provides an overview of the various types of pension plans and the
rules and regulations that govern them. We tell you about the protections
that are ensured by the law known as the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act (ERISA) that started the trend toward pension protection in
1974. The new and important changes to the pension laws that came about
through the Pension Protection Act of 2006 are covered in this part as well.
3
Introduction

Part II: Making Sure That You Receive 
the Pension You Earned
In this part, we explain what it takes to qualify for a pension, and we go over
the rules for accrual and vesting. We tell you what documents to assemble for
retirement, and we explain why you need them and how to get them. Finally,
we give you a heads-up on distribution issues. (That’s right; we talk about
you finally getting your money!)
Part III: Guarding Your Pension 
from Your Employer
In this day and age, nothing is certain except change. So, in this part, we
address the possible changes that your employer can undergo, and we
explain their possible impact on your pension. Whether your employer
merges with another company, sells to another company, or decides to
amend or terminate its plan, all of these scenarios can have a significant
impact on your retirement benefits. In these circumstances, you need to
know how to move quickly to ensure that your pension benefits are still there
and how to protect them until you’re entitled to receive them. In this part,
you also find out what your employer and the plan’s paid advisors (called
fiduciaries) can and can’t do, and we tell you what you can do to protect your
pension from their actions, inactions, or transgressions.
Part IV: Shielding Your Pension 
from Life’s Ups and Downs
Financial problems, divorce, and premature death are potential life problems
for just about everyone. And when these unfortunate events occur, they
undoubtedly affect your pension. So, this part tells you the rules about bor-
rowing from your pension. It also explains how and when your pension assets
need protection from your creditors, what to expect in a divorce, and how to
extend your pension to your beneficiaries if you die before them.
4
Protecting Your Pension For Dummies 

Part V: Taking Action When Bad Things
Happen to Good Pensioners
It’s more common than you’d like to think: Plans often fail to pay the full
amount that pensioners are entitled to receive. This failure to pay the right
amount can happen for any number of reasons, and in this part we point out
some of the most obvious. We also explain what you need to do to enforce
your rights, starting with an appeal to the plan, and if that isn’t successful,
ending with the final resort of filing a lawsuit in federal court.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
The chapters in this part address ten important issues that may arise for
three different categories of people: employees who are still working, retirees
or those getting ready to retire, and small business owners. Any one of these
30 items may turn out to be the important issue for you.
Part VII: Appendixes
We provide a glossary in Appendix A of the fancy terms and the alphabet
soup of abbreviations that are so loved by those who write pension laws.
This glossary allows you to quickly look up the definitions of any words that
you come across in your dealings with your pension plan. Appendix B con-
tains the charts and tables that we discuss throughout the book. These items
can help you compare the different kinds of plans and can graphically explain
some of the more technical concepts that we discuss.
Icons Used in This Book
See those pictures in the margins throughout this book? They’re icons that
point out specific information. Here’s what they mean.
This icon points out new information that results from changes in the pen-
sion laws that occurred following the passage of the Pension Protection Act
on August 17, 2006.
This icon means just what it says. It highlights points that you should keep in
mind as you’re reading.

Introduction

This icon gives you the skinny on the technical issues that may befuddle
even rocket scientists. These technical tidbits aren’t necessary to the discus-
sion at hand, so if you’d rather skip them, feel free to do so.
If we’ve marked something with this icon, know that it’s helpful information
that we think can make a task easier.
This icon puts you on red alert. Ignore this critical advice at your own 
financial, or even legal, peril.
Where to Go from Here
Even though we’d love for you to read this entire book from cover to cover,
we understand that not all of you will. The book is laid out in a modular
format that provides you with easy access to all the general information that
you need. If you have a specific subject that you want to know more about,
feel free to go immediately to that part to find out more. The table of contents
and the index are helpful for getting you to the right page quickly. However, if
you know little to nothing about pension plans and have no idea of even the
first question to ask, we recommend that you browse through the table of
contents for an overview of the topics we cover. Or you can start with
Chapter 1, which gives you the basics on pensions. If you have the luxury of
time, we encourage you to read as much as possible, even if you choose to
skip around chapter by chapter. Finally, if you think your family, friends, or
co-workers can benefit from this book, please share it with them.

Pension
Fundamentals

In this part . . .
S
aving for your retirement is one of the most impor-
tant things you can do for yourself and your family. 
So when your employer offers a retirement plan as part of
its benefits package, consider this a fabulous opportunity.
After all, can you really expect to sock away all the money
you need for retirement without a retirement plan? To
take full advantage of this opportunity, however, you must
know the fundamentals of the type of plan being offered
and the rules and responsibilities attached to that plan. In
this part, we introduce the act that lays down those rules:
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,
known as ERISA.
These days, when it comes down to who’s paying for 
your pension, the times are changing. In this part, we give
you a heads-up on the ongoing shift from the traditional
employer-funded defined benefit plans, which provide 
lifetime monthly benefits (similar to Social Security), to
the ever more prevalent employee-funded defined contri-
bution plans, including 401(k) plans. We also explain the
benefits of Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), a popu-
lar way to supplement your employer’s retirement plan,
and we show you the ins and outs of monitoring your
plan’s investments.

Chapter 1
Navigating the Ins and Outs 
of Pensions
In This Chapter
 Getting acquainted with pension plans and the rules that govern them
 Making sure you receive your rightful pension
 Dealing with employer changes that impact your pension
 Understanding the impact of divorce, loans, and bankruptcy on your pension
 Finding out what to do when you don’t get the pension you earned
You’ve worked hard for years, and you’re looking forward to your well-
deserved retirement. But are you truly ready? With this book, you’ll be
on your way. We want to help you prepare for this exciting time in your life,
but we don’t want to bog you down with legal details. We’ll let the pension
experts argue the fine points of pension law. Instead, in this book, we give
you just the information that you need to understand your pension so you
can protect it effectively.
For instance, we explain the differences between a defined benefit plan and a
defined contribution plan. Already know that? Well, we go on from there to
tell you about accrued benefits and vesting, how to take a loan from your
plan (if you need one), and what happens to your pension in a divorce. You
can also find out what happens when your plan goes broke or your company
is sold. Finally, we give you information about fighting back when the plan
takes advantage of you.
We introduce all these topics (and more) in this chapter; all of this informa-
tion can help you grab hold of the pension that you worked so hard to earn.

Checking Out Pension Rules
The basic idea behind pension plan rules is to hold companies accountable
for the promises they make to their employees regarding retirements. In
exchange for following the rules, Congress provides pension plans special tax
benefits. The pension plans that are given these special tax benefits are
called tax-qualified pension plans (see the next section for more info).
The federal law that regulates pensions is called the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act, but it’s also known by its nickname, ERISA. ERISA has
been around since 1974, and despite its amendments and the other retire-
ment plan legislation enacted since then, the act was in need of a face-lift.
After several years of wrangling, on August 17, 2006, the Pension Protection
Act, known to friends and foes as the PPA, was enacted to update ERISA. The
PPA is the most comprehensive pension legislation since ERISA. Both pieces
of legislation, however, are alive and well. These federal laws apply to private
pension plans — from your dentist’s small plan to the billion-dollar plans of
our country’s biggest corporations.
Government employees, public school teachers, police officers, and firefight-
ers participate in state pension plans that are created and regulated by state
law, not federal law. This book doesn’t cover these types of plans; we focus
primarily on private plans that are governed by ERISA.
Pension plans covered under ERISA must do the following:
 Disclose certain plan information
 Set minimum standards for eligibility, accrual, and vesting
 Spell out fiduciary obligations
 Provide the right to file suit
For more about ERISA and the basics of pension rules, see Chapter 2.
Getting a Grip on Tax-Qualified Plans
For the most part, tax-qualified pension plans for private companies boil
down to two basic varieties that are known as defined contribution plans and
defined benefit plans. More and more companies are replacing their defined
benefit plans with defined contribution plans. In Chapter 3, we explore the
various types of plans that are included within these two groups.
10
Part I: Focusing on Pension Fundamentals 

Building your pension with defined 
contribution plans
A defined contribution plan is set up by your employer. Once it’s set up, the
plan provides you with an individual account until the money is distributed
upon retirement. With this type of plan, you make tax-free contributions
while you’re still working. Your company may or may not match those contri-
butions and make additional contributions, tax-free, to your plan. The benefit
you receive at retirement is based on the amounts contributed to your
account and the investment gains and losses it experiences. When you retire,
your account balance is the amount that you have available — and when it’s
gone, that’s all there is.
Here are some of the varieties of defined contribution plans that we cover in
Chapter 3:
 Profit-sharing plans
 401(k) plans
 Money purchase plans
 Employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs)
 Target benefit pension plans
Receiving cash for life with defined 
benefit plans
The defined benefit plan is more like traditional Social Security — after retire-
ment it provides you with a fixed amount each month for as long as you or
your designated beneficiary live. It doesn’t matter whether your pension fund
makes a bundle with its investments or loses a bundle; you’re always entitled
to the same monthly benefit or annuity. Here are the three types of defined
benefit plans that we discuss in more detail in Chapter 3:
 The traditional defined benefit plan
 The cash balance (or hybrid) plan
 The 412(i) plan
11
Chapter 1: Navigating the Ins and Outs of Pensions

Moving Forward with 401(k) Plans
Because the PPA now requires that defined benefit plans be fully funded and
because defined benefit plans provide less flexibility to employers and are
flat-out expensive to administer, many companies have been making a big
shift in their pension plans to 401(k) plans. These plans are an increasingly
popular type of defined contribution plan. As we point out in Chapter 4, the
following different types of 401(k) plans exist:
 Traditional 401(k) plans
 Safe Harbor 401(k) plans
 SIMPLE 401(k) plans
 Individual (or solo) 401(k) plans
 Roth 401(k) plans
401(k)s are popular with both employers and employees. Employees like
them because their elective deferrals to the plan and the investment gains
aren’t subject to taxes until they’re distributed from the plan. Also helpful is
the fact that employee deferrals are always 100 percent vested. Employers
enjoy 401(k) plans because contributions are deductible on their federal
income tax returns. It’s a win-win situation for everybody. The type of 401(k)
plan that your employer may offer usually depends on its size and financial
situation.
Funding Your Retirement with 
the Help of IRAs
An individual retirement account, or IRA, is a plan that allows employees
(under age 701⁄2), self-employed individuals, and certain other individuals to
put money into personal retirement accounts. You may be able to deduct
some or all of your contributions to a traditional IRA depending on whether
you, your spouse, or both of you are covered by a qualified retirement plan. If
you and/or your spouse are covered, the amount of your tax deduction may
be reduced depending on your adjusted gross income at the time you file
your taxes. Generally, the amount in your traditional IRA, including earnings,
isn’t taxed until it’s distributed to you.
An IRA is especially beneficial if you aren’t already participating in an
employer-sponsored retirement plan because it provides you with a way to
save for your retirement on a tax-advantaged basis.
12
Part I: Focusing on Pension Fundamentals 

Varieties of IRAs include the following:
 Traditional IRAs
 Roth IRAs
 SIMPLE IRAs
 Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) Plans
Chapter 5 covers the different types of IRAs, including the rules about contri-
butions, penalties, and distributions.
Tracking Pension Investments
When it comes to investing the money contributed to your pension, one of
two things can happen: Either the plan officials direct the investments or
you’re permitted to direct the investments yourself. Naturally, the latter type
of investment is called a self-directed investment.
When plan officials direct the investments in your pension plan, it’s impor-
tant that you do the following:
 Check on exactly who’s investing your money.
 Examine your plan’s selected investments.
 Track the performance of your plan’s investments.
 Watch out for signs that the plan isn’t following investment rules (and
take action if something’s amiss).
If you have the option of self-directing your investments, follow these guidelines:
 Find help in selecting your investments (for example, consult your plan’s
financial advisor, if there is one, or get a second opinion from your own
financial advisor).
 Check your investments regularly (and change them if they aren’t 
working for you).
Head to Chapter 6 for the scoop on investments in pension plans.

Chapter 1: Navigating the Ins and Outs of Pensions

Ensuring That You Get Your Pension
To make sure that you get the pension that you deserve, you need to know
the rules about a few important issues: eligibility, accrual, vesting, and distri-
butions. You also need to use the right tools to plan for your retirement. We
explain what you need to know in the following sections.
Getting the skinny on eligibility, 
accrual, and vesting
You can’t participate in your employer’s pension plan until you become eligi-
ble. And only after you become eligible do you begin to accrue benefits.
(Accrual is the growth you earn in your account as you work.) At some point,
your accrued benefits vest, meaning that they can’t be taken away from you.
Simple enough, right? Of course, the devil is in the details: How do you
become eligible? What determines how you accrue benefits? When do these
accrued benefits vest? Here are the basics (see Chapter 7 for more details):
 Eligibility: Your retirement plan can set age and service requirements
before you can be part of its pension plan. But these requirements, by
law, can’t be unreasonable.
 Accrual: Your plan has a formula it uses to calculate how your benefits
accrue. This formula is contained in your summary plan description (SPD),
which is a plan document that must be made available to you upon your
request. Your plan can’t reduce the rate of the accrual of the benefits that
you’ve already accrued, but it may do so for future benefits.
 Vesting: It’s up to your company to determine when your benefits become
vested, and this information must be specified in your SPD. Don’t worry,
though; your company must comply with minimum vesting schedules.
Your company can vest your benefits in the following two ways:
• With cliff vesting, which is an all-or-nothing approach where you
become totally vested after a passage of time
• With graded vesting, which is a method where you vest a percent-
age of your accrued benefit each year that you work
Your own contributions to a defined contribution plan are yours no
matter how long you’ve been working and how young or old you are.
Making retirement planning a priority
Quite obviously, it’s best to plan for retirement while you’re still working. This
means, first off, that you have to know your net worth. Add up your assets (for
14
Part I: Focusing on Pension Fundamentals 

example, your savings accounts, your investments, and the equity in your
home) and then subtract your debts (expenses such as credit card debt,
home mortgage, car loans, and so on). Hopefully your assets are greater than
your debts; those assets that are left add up to be the value of your net worth.
After you calculate your net worth, you need to consider the type of retire-
ment that you want to have (frugal, extravagant, or something in between).
Then you have to figure out how much you need to save along with your pen-
sion. Again, the time to set up a budget and begin figuring out how much you
need to save is while you’re still working and actually have money to budget.
Your pension plan documents are instrumental in helping you understand how
your pension benefits are calculated, so it’s important to assemble your pension
documents and keep them safe. But also be sure to go a step further — get in
the habit of checking the accuracy of the personal information that your plan
maintains for you. Review the pension SPD, plan amendments, and other items
you have in your possession.
Chapter 8 has all the info that you need to help you plan your retirement, includ-
ing painting a complete picture of your retirement and finding financial help.
Receiving your pension distribution
When it comes to your pension, the bottom line goal is to actually receive
your benefits. The first step, then, is to follow your plan’s requirements for
applying for a pension benefit. Keep in mind the following considerations:
 If you take your distribution before you’re 591⁄2 years old, you may be
socked with a penalty tax for taking it too soon.
 You may be forced to take a distribution in some instances.
 If you wait until you become 701⁄2, you may be socked with a penalty for
taking your distribution too late.
 Special rules apply if the distribution is made after your death.
Also, if your plan offers the option to take your benefits in a lump sum or as
an annuity (in which you receive monthly payments for the rest of your life),
you need to decide which option is best for you.
One more thing: You need to decide whether you want to roll over your pen-
sion money from one tax-qualified plan into another tax-qualified plan or into
an IRA. If so, you must be aware of the restrictions regarding what can be
rolled over and what it can be rolled over into.
For example, only eligible rollover distributions can be rolled over. These dis-
tributions include lump-sum distributions (not annuity payments) that aren’t
15
Chapter 1: Navigating the Ins and Outs of Pensions

minimum required distributions (that are required at age 701⁄2) and that aren’t
due to hardships. Your plan administrator will provide you with notice about
this prior to your distribution, and you’ll have 60 days to roll over part or all
of your benefits currently in a tax-qualified plan. If you don’t roll over your
eligible distribution into an IRA or other tax-qualified plan within 60 days, it
will be considered a taxable distribution.
If you fail to roll over your eligible distribution directly from the qualified plan
to an IRA or other tax-qualified plan, 20 percent of the distribution will be with-
held for federal income tax (and 80 percent will be distributed to you). You can
still roll over an amount equal to 100 percent of the distribution within 60 days,
but because you’re receiving only 80 percent, you’ll have to come up with the
other 20 percent from somewhere else, like your savings account.
You can find many of the answers to your rollover and distribution questions
in Chapter 9.
Keeping Your Pension Safe 
from Your Employer
Sometimes the major pension issue that you face is keeping an eye on the fox
that was hired by the farmer (your company) to guard the henhouse (your
pension). In other words, your company, like our proverbial farmer, hired a
financial advisor called a fiduciary, whose job it is to look after your interests
and see that your plan money is invested wisely. This assignment is full of
temptations for the fiduciary, who truly can be like a fox in a henhouse. The
fiduciary, for example, must resist the temptation to recommend investments
that have high fees or that are sold by a broker who might provide a referral
fee for the business. In the following sections, we introduce you to the
employer issues that can significantly affect your pension.
Watching your fiduciary
A fiduciary is someone who offers investment advice to a plan or who has
control over plan assets. Your plan fiduciaries may include plan trustees, the
plan administrator, pension consultants, and other investment professionals.
To remain ethically sound and unbiased, fiduciaries must
 Do what’s in the best interests of plan members
 Act with skill, prudence, and diligence
 Follow the plan documents
 Diversify plan assets and minimize expenses
16
Part I: Focusing on Pension Fundamentals 

Fiduciaries must not
 Invest the plan’s money for their own benefit
 Involve themselves in transactions that aren’t in the plan’s best interest
 Get money for themselves in exchange for giving another person business
As a member of a pension plan, you need to know who your fiduciaries are.
Ask questions. And be curious if your fiduciaries are abusing their power. The
fastest way to end a negative practice is to expose it. See Chapter 10 for more
information about fiduciaries.
Understanding the impact of acquisitions,
mergers, and other major job changes
Your company is in the business of making money; that task is its first priority.
So, to a large extent, it makes decisions based on the expected returns. And,
well, some business decisions are great for the company but bad for your retire-
ment. It’s inevitable that you’ll sooner or later come across sales, mergers, bank-
ruptcies, job switches, and other changes that are neither anticipated nor
expected. It’s quite possible that these activities will affect your pension, so we
suggest that you sit up and take notice. The list of possible changes in the case
of such events may include the following:
 The termination of your existing pension plan and replacement by a 
new plan
 The merger of your plan into the plan of a successor company
 A transfer of all the records relating to your pension from one location to
another (just think what happens to your luggage when you fly from one
location to another)
 The conversion of your defined benefit plan to a defined contribution
plan or a cash balance plan
 A reduction or an increase in how your future pension is calculated
The list of changes goes on and on. What’s most important, however, is that
you’re proactive when it comes to protecting your pension. Therefore, when
your company goes through big changes, be sure to do the following:
 Find out as soon as you can what changes your company will make and
what impact they’ll have on your pension.
 Determine the key people who administer the plan and, if appropriate,
get to know them.
17
Chapter 1: Navigating the Ins and Outs of Pensions

 Double-check that all of your pension documents have landed in the
proper location.
 Make sure that you’ve received credit for the time that you worked 
at the previous company and that the rest of your file has the right 
information.
Head to Chapter 11 for more information on dealing with acquisitions, mergers,
job changes, and employer bankruptcies.
Knowing what happens if your plan 
is changed or terminated
It’s true that your pension plan can be amended. But if your plan wants to
make changes, it must follow the rules; some options available under the
plan are protected from amendments, but others aren’t. The plan can ask the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to issue a determination letter stating that the
IRS believes the plan amendment conforms to IRS rules. However, no matter
what, if the plan intends to make a significant change, it must provide you
with a notice called a summary of material modifications (SMM). This docu-
ment provides a summary of the changes.
Your employer also has the right to terminate its defined benefit plan or
defined contribution plan. However, when a qualified plan is terminated, each
affected participant becomes 100 percent vested in his or her accrued bene-
fits as of the date the plan terminated. Depending on what kind of plan it is
and why the plan is terminated, different rules apply.
A defined benefit plan can be terminated in the following three ways:
 A standard termination: Your employer can end the plan in a standard
termination only after showing the Pension Benefit Guarantee
Corporation, or PBGC (the federal agency that insures defined benefit
pension plans), that the plan has enough money to pay all benefits owed
to its participants. The plan must either purchase an annuity from an
insurance company or, if the plan allows, issue a lump sum payment that
covers your entire benefit.
 A distress determination: If the plan isn’t fully funded and your com-
pany is in financial distress, your employer may apply for a distress ter-
mination from the PBGC. However, the application won’t be granted
unless the employer proves to the PBGC or a bankruptcy court that it
can’t continue in business unless the plan is terminated. If the PBGC
grants the application, it usually takes over as trustee of the plan and
pays the plan benefits, up to the legal limits, using the plan’s assets and
funds guaranteed by the PBGC.
18
Part I: Focusing on Pension Fundamentals 

 An involuntary termination for lack of funds: Sometimes the PBGC
takes action on its own to end a pension plan. An involuntary termination
usually occurs when the PBGC determines that plan termination is
needed to protect the interests of plan participants (for example, if a
plan won’t be able to pay benefits when due) or of the PBGC insurance
program itself.
When a defined contribution plan is terminated, the money in your plan
account is yours; it can’t be taken away from you for any reason. The PBGC
doesn’t provide any protection for defined contribution plans because the con-
tributions made to your account are in your own individual account (meaning
that whatever’s in that account is yours). Interested in finding out more? Check
out Chapter 12 for full details on plan amendments and terminations.
Safeguarding Your Pension 
from Life’s Trials
Practically no one gets through life without some trauma, and that trauma
may affect your pension:
 You may unexpectedly run short of money, and you may find that the only
place to come up with ready cash is to borrow it from your pension plan.
 You may go through a divorce, and your ex-spouse may have rights to
your pension that are governed by special provisions.
 You may have to file for bankruptcy. In this case, it’s important to know
whether your pension will be protected from your creditors.
Even more certain is the fact that everyone alive will someday wind up dead
(sorry to be blunt!). In anticipation of that day, it’s necessary to consider pen-
sion survivorship benefits for your loved ones.
In the following sections, we explain how to keep your pension safe through
life’s ups and downs.
Getting a loan from yourself
Imagine that you need some money to pay for an unexpected medical bill and
that your pension plan is sitting there flush with cash. Your plan, in this case,
may appear to be a big, fat available target. However, do remember that strict
rules control loans from your pension plan, and real consequences will cost
you real money if you break those rules.
19
Chapter 1: Navigating the Ins and Outs of Pensions

A loan from your pension plan is like a loan from the bank. Consider these
similarities:
 It must be in writing and must have a reasonable rate of interest.
 A repayment schedule must be prepared and the loan must be secured.
Also, your plan documents must specifically provide that loans are permit-
ted. These documents must set out the procedure for applying for the loan
and must establish the basis on which a loan will be approved or denied.
If you fail to pay back the loan on time (in other words, if you defaulted on the
loan), it’s treated as though the plan made a taxable distribution to you
(referred to as a deemed distribution). This means that you must pay taxes on
the outstanding balance of the loan at the time of the default. If this deemed
distribution occurs before you’re age 591⁄2, you’ll have to pay an additional 10
percent tax on the outstanding balance as well. Keep in mind that if the plan
offers an annuity form of payment, you also need spousal consent for the loan.
All in all, if possible, try to avoid borrowing from your plan. When you take
money out — for whatever reason — that money is no longer working to pro-
vide you a sound retirement.
But if taking out a loan from your plan is your only option, it’s definitely one
worth considering. For the scoop on taking out a loan from your pension
plan, see Chapter 13.
Protecting your family
What happens to your pension benefits when you die? In many instances, you
can provide for survivorship benefits to a spouse or other designated benefi-
ciary. The extent of those benefits, however, depends on whether you die
before or after retirement. The two means of providing survivorship benefits
are the qualified preretirement survivor annuity (QPSA) and the qualified joint
and survivor annuity (QJSA). The QPSA typically kicks in if you die before you
retire while the QJSA kicks in if you die after you retire.
Not all plans offer survivorship benefits, however. The rule is that all defined
benefit plans must offer survivorship benefits as well as defined contribution
plans that provide for a life annuity (which provides a series of regular pay-
ments over your lifetime).We cover survivorship benefits in greater detail in
Chapter 14.

Part I: Focusing on Pension Fundamentals 

Watching out for your ex
Divorce is a fact of modern American life. If you’re facing a divorce, the judge
who’s hearing your case has the authority to make provisions from your pen-
sion plan for your soon-to-be ex. The judge makes this provision by issuing
an order called a domestic relations order, which the plan administrator must
approve. After approval, the order becomes final and is referred to as a quali-
fied domestic relations order, or QDRO for short. The QDRO can allocate pen-
sion benefits to provide marital and child support and it can divide marital
assets. Your pension benefits may be one of the most valuable assets accu-
mulated during your marriage, and the QDRO is the legal mechanism used to
split up those benefits, just as other marital assets are divided between you
and your spouse.
The QDRO, however, can’t (among other things)
 Provide for benefits that aren’t available under your plan
 Provide for benefits for your ex’s new spouse
The rules regarding QDROs are complicated, so take a look at Chapter 15 for
more details.
Staying safe from creditors and 
personal bankruptcy
As a general rule, your pension benefits are protected from creditors if you
have to file for bankruptcy. In fact, your typical defined benefit or defined
contribution pension plan is protected from creditors whether or not you
have filed for bankruptcy. This protection is one of the big benefits of a tax-
qualified pension plan.
If you do file for bankruptcy, protection from creditors extends also to:
 Traditional and Roth IRAs, which are protected up to $1 million
 SEPs or SIMPLE IRAs
 Section 403(b) plans (tax-sheltered annuity plans) and Section 457 plans
(plans for employees of state and federal government)
21
Chapter 1: Navigating the Ins and Outs of Pensions

In some situations you get no protection from creditors. For instance, your
pension distributions aren’t protected. If you anticipate that creditors may
come after you because of financial woes (or, worse, if you have to file bank-
ruptcy), proper planning must be done to make sure that you have no assets
available for your creditors. This is an area where the advice of a good bank-
ruptcy or pension attorney is a must to ensure that your retirement savings
are in the proper type of plan to receive sufficient protection from your credi-
tors. Don’t try to muddle through these issues on your own. For more infor-
mation, head to Chapter 16.
Taking Action When Necessary
There may come a time when you and the plan have a parting of the ways
over what pension amount you’re entitled to receive. Fortunately, when this
happens, you can assert your rights. As you find out in the following sections,
you don’t have to like it or lump it. The company may have the big bucks, but
a good lawyer on your side can quickly even the playing field. You must take
certain measures to protect your rights, starting with filing an appeal to the
plan if you’re shortchanged and following the plan’s appeal process until
you’ve exhausted it. If you still aren’t successful, you can bring a lawsuit in
federal court.
Eyeing potential distribution problems
Your pension plan has attorneys, accountants, and pension actuaries to help it
with its pension issues. At first glance, you would think that a lone pensioner
has no chance against such a formidable opponent. Not true. If the plan makes
a systemwide error, such as the use of the wrong interest rate, it impacts all
retirees the same way. In that instance, it isn’t just you against the plan — lots
of pensioners who are in the same boat probably have the same claim.
Sometimes your plan may not be aware of its errors, so you should be on the
lookout for problems. A few common errors include the following:
 Your wages or years of service haven’t been properly reported.
 Your plan ignored new vesting requirements or increases in pension 
benefits.
 Cuts in benefits have been applied to you retroactively.
What you should not do is nothing. Be proactive and intercept small problems
before they become big ones. Head to Chapter 17 for full details on potential
distribution problems.
22
Part I: Focusing on Pension Fundamentals 

Filing your claim and appealing a denial
The first step in actually receiving your pension benefits is filing a claim with
your plan. Plans have set procedures in their SPDs for how to file a claim.
Make sure that you comply with the plan’s rules for filing your claim. You can
expect to hear back from your plan within a certain period of time after it
receives your claim; if you don’t file properly, you’ll never know when your
time starts to run or if the plan is even processing your claim.
After successfully filing, if your claim for benefits is denied in full or in part,
you’ll receive a denial letter. At this point, you must file an appeal to protect
your rights. The plan and the denial letter tell you exactly how to file this
appeal. If you fail to appeal the denial of your claim in a timely manner and
you don’t follow the plan’s procedures as required, you may find yourself in
the position of not being able to file a lawsuit down the road, if necessary. We
cover the entire appeal process in Chapter 18.
If you lose the appeal, you must decide if you want to take the plan to court.
If you decide that you do want to sue the plan, keep reading to find out what
comes next.
Hiring a lawyer
There’s really no magic in hiring the right lawyer. If you’re involved in a pen-
sion case, hire a pension attorney. If your claim is going to be brought under
ERISA, find an ERISA specialist who practices in federal court. You may also
be able to find a lawyer who handles state-based pension cases. Whatever
the case may be, the lawyer you choose should not only be familiar with the
subject matter, but also should have some record of success in bringing
these types of cases. Set up a meeting to interview the attorney under consid-
eration to help determine if he or she is the right choice.
Before you see the attorney, gather the relevant documents and have a clear
idea of what your concerns are. We explain exactly what you need to do to
hire the best attorney for your needs in Chapter 19.
Litigating a pension claim
ERISA provides that you have a right to sue your plan. And you don’t have to
worry about backlash from your employer or plan because ERISA also for-
bids employers and plans from retaliating against a pension participant
because of a claim that he or she brought against them. So if you need to file
a claim, have at it.
23
Chapter 1: Navigating the Ins and Outs of Pensions

Once a pension lawsuit is filed in court, it follows a predictable path. It starts
with the filing of the complaint by the plan participant and the answer that’s
filed by the defendant (the plan). From there it moves to the discovery
process by the parties to figure out the position of each side. Then it’s time
to file a motion with the court asking for a ruling in your favor. If you aren’t
fortunate enough to win this summary judgment motion, your case will most
likely go to trial unless it’s settled before that. We dissect the basics of pen-
sion litigation in Chapter 20.
Many pension cases are filed by one or two individuals on behalf of a group
(called a class action), because the claims of the pensioners may be virtually
identical. Court approval is necessary in order for the case to be considered
a class action, but if it’s granted, the court then monitors the class action to
ensure that the rights of the group are protected by the representative client
and the attorneys who file the case. Tens of thousands of pensioners have
recovered large amounts of money through pension class actions. Obviously
it’s preferable to get the correct pension benefit right off the bat, but even
years after your initial distribution it may not be too late to right a wrong.

Acquainting Yourself with 
Pension Rules
In This Chapter
 Reviewing the basic framework that governs pension plans
 Surveying pension plan requirements under ERISA
P
eople work for many reasons, but at the top of the list is the desire to
support themselves and their families. And they don’t want to stop sup-
porting their families after they stop working either. That means employee
benefits offered by employers, in the form of pension plans that provide
income after retirement, are critical.
Your employer isn’t required to provide a pension plan for you and your
fellow employees, but if it does, you (as well as the other participants) and the
employer have rights and responsibilities. These rights and responsibilities
are set forth specifically in the law known as the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). The ultimate goal of ERISA is to make sure that
the contributions made to your plan while you’re working are still there when
you retire.
In this chapter, we go over the basic terms that you need to understand
ERISA and the requirements set by ERISA for pension plans. If you’re familiar
with the rules that your plan must follow, you’ll be better equipped to under-
stand the documents that your plan provides you. Also, if you understand
what’s required for plan participation, you can make sure that you’re doing
everything to qualify for the benefits that you’ll rely on for your retirement.
And finally, understanding these rules can help you determine if your
employer is following the rules as well.

26
Part I: Focusing on Pension Fundamentals 
ERISA primarily applies to private retirement plans, which are typically
defined benefit or defined contribution plans that are sponsored by employers
and unions. Almost all employee benefit plans, however, are subject to some
provisions of the act. ERISA doesn’t generally apply to state and local govern-
ment plans, church plans, or those covering only self-employed persons.
Instead, these plans are subject to various rules under the Internal Revenue
Code.
Before You Begin: Basic Information 
for Understanding ERISA
ERISA came about after years of concerns about the mismanagement and
abuse of private pension plans. Throughout the 1900s, many pieces of legisla-
tion were proposed in an attempt to address these concerns. Ultimately, in
1974, ERISA was signed into law by President Gerald Ford.
The goal of ERISA is to protect the interests of participants and their benefi-
ciaries in employee benefit funds. ERISA provides requirements for the dis-
closure of important information to better protect plan participants. ERISA
also imposes certain requirements that all pension plans must meet, such as
rules about how long an employer can require you to work before you earn
your pension benefits. Similarly, ERISA includes rules to ensure that those
who manage pension plans do so responsibly by meeting certain standards
of conduct. (To familiarize yourself with these standards, check out Chapter
10.) If plans don’t comply with the imposed restrictions, the plan managers
may be subject to certain penalties. And the plans themselves risk being dis-
qualified and losing their tax benefits and/or incurring other penalties.
As a general rule, your employer can deduct the contributions it makes to the
plan on behalf of its employees as long as it complies with certain requirements
of the Internal Revenue Code and ERISA. It’s a win-win situation for everyone.
In the following sections, we provide some basic information that you need to
know in order to fully understand ERISA, including a few important terms and
brief descriptions of the plans that ERISA covers.
Simple (yet important) definitions
It’s difficult to avoid certain pension terminology because the laws involving
pension plans are filled with these words and phrases. We include a glossary in
Appendix A that serves as a quick and easy reference for all the pension jargon
that you’re likely to see. But for now, here are some of the most common words
and phrases that appear frequently throughout ERISA and this book:

 Retirement plan/pension plan: Throughout this book, these terms are
used interchangeably. The term pension plan basically refers to any type
of retirement plan. A retirement plan (or simply plan) is an arrangement
that provides people with an income or pension during retirement, when
they’re no longer earning a steady income from employment. Plans may
be set up by employers, insurance companies, the government, unions,
or other institutions (such as employer associations or trade unions),
and they’re typically classified as defined benefit plans or defined contri-
bution plans, depending on how the benefits are determined. (See the
later section “An overview of pension plans covered by ERISA” for more
about both types of plans.)
 Pension fund: A pension fund, which is often referred to as simply “a
fund,” is the fund that maintains the employer’s and employee’s contri-
butions to the pension plan, along with the earnings on the investments.
This fund must be kept separate and apart from the employer’s assets.
 Plan participant: The plan participant is the individual who’s participat-
ing in a pension plan by virtue of his or her employment (or former
employment) with an employer that’s offering the benefit. This person
receives pension benefits subject to the terms of the plan.
 Plan beneficiary: A plan beneficiary is an individual designated by a
plan participant (or in some cases by the plan) to receive benefits from
the plan if the participant dies.
 Plan administrator: The plan administrator runs your plan and maintains
the pension records. The administrator also hires and fires the plan’s
employees and/or consultants with approval of the plan’s board. But most
importantly, the administrator performs some functions that directly
impact your pension. For example, the administrator does the following:
• Determines eligibility for plan participation and for accrual and
vesting of benefits (see Chapter 7 for details on these topics)
• Decides whether to accept your claim for benefits
• Distributes your benefits to you (see Chapter 9 for general distrib-
ution info)
• Advises you of your various retirement options as well as your
rights under the plan
 Fiduciary: A fiduciary is anyone who exercises any discretionary author-
ity, responsibility, or control over a plan, anyone who handles the plan’s
assets, or anyone who’s compensated in some manner to render invest-
ment advice regarding a plan’s assets (or who has authority or responsi-
bility to do so). See the later section “Spelling out fiduciary obligations”
for more details.
Generally speaking, though, your employer and the plan administrator
are both fiduciaries. Other people or entities may also be fiduciaries
depending on what they do for the plan.
27
Chapter 2: Acquainting Yourself with Pension Rules

 Plan year: A plan year is any consecutive 12-month period during which
you work or are paid for at least 1,000 hours. A plan year may be either a
calendar year (for example, January through December) or a different
12-month period (for example, July through June), and it usually coin-
cides with the fiscal year of the plan.
 Years of service: This term refers to the number of years that you’ve
worked for your employer. For most plans, 1,000 hours in a plan year
constitutes a year of service for purposes of qualifying to receive retire-
ment benefits from the plan.
 Accrued benefit: The term accrued benefit refers to the amount of your
normal retirement benefit that you’ve earned at any given point in your
career. The term total accrued benefit refers to the total amount of 
your accrued benefits earned as of a particular date.
The meaning of “tax-qualified plan”
ERISA sets the framework that governs all tax-qualified retirement plans. If a
plan fulfills all the specified requirements set out in ERISA and the Internal
Revenue Code, it’s qualified to receive favorable tax treatment by the IRS —
and then it’s considered a tax-qualified plan (see the section “Gotta Do It:
ERISA’s Requirements for Pension Plans” later in this chapter for more details
on the requirements). Qualified retirement plans serve two major functions:
They provide employee benefits and they defer taxes. Some of the benefits of
tax-qualified plans include the following:
 Employers can take a tax deduction for their plan contributions. As a
general rule, employer contributions to the plan are deductible in the
year made as long as they’re made before the due date for the corporate
tax return (including extensions).
 Employees don’t have to pay taxes on plan assets until they receive the
money. In other words, pension plans are tax-exempt, meaning that they
don’t pay taxes on the pension fund. The contributions continue to earn
interest, tax-free, until the money is distributed. A participant’s obligation
to pay taxes is deferred until he or she receives payments from the plan.
 Both participants and employers generally get tax breaks when involved
in retirement plans. Income tax brackets are generally lower at the time
benefits are received following the participant’s retirement or death. This
means that the government will be able to take less of your money.
Also, Social Security taxes are paid neither on employer contributions to
tax-qualified retirement plans nor on distributions to participants from
such plans.
 Qualified plans provide a means of forced savings. It’s difficult for
most people to save money outside of a retirement plan, so having one
forces you to save, thereby cushioning your retirement.
28
Part I: Focusing on Pension Fundamentals 

Qualified plans provide protection of assets from creditors’ claims.
Because the goal of ERISA is to provide and secure your retirement bene-
fits, it provides protection for these assets from creditors who think you
should use your retirement fund to pay them. See Chapter 16 for more
information on what protections are provided for the different types of
plans and how you can better plan to keep your assets safe from your
creditors before your financial situation worsens.
An overview of pension plans 
covered by ERISA
Tax-qualified ERISA pension plans usually come in two varieties: defined bene-
fit plans and defined contribution plans. Even though we discuss these plans in
detail in Chapter 3, it’s important to understand the basics now so that you
can identify the type of plan you have. After you know what type of plan you
have, you can examine the rules that govern the different plans and deter-
mine how to make sure you get the benefits that you deserve. Your employer
may have one of these types of plans, both, or none at all:
 Defined benefit plans: Under a traditional defined benefit plan, the level
of benefits you receive at retirement is fixed. However, the employer’s
contributions in any given year are not fixed. All of the employer’s con-
tributions are placed in a single account (not in an individual account
for just you). The promised benefit that a participant is to receive is cal-
culated based on factors such as age, salary, and years of service.
When the employer provides the money to fund the plan, it’s considered
an employer funded plan. The management of a defined benefit plan and
the investment of the plan’s assets are within the employer’s control.
Defined benefit plans are insured by the federal government’s insurance
company, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC). So if a plan
fails, most participants will be paid most of their benefits, up to $49,500
per year.
Examples of defined benefit plans include cash balance plans and 412(i)
plans (which are also known as fully insured plans).
 Defined contribution plans: These types of plans don’t promise a spe-
cific benefit amount that you receive at retirement. Instead, they’re
funded during your employment by you, your employer, or both of you.
The final payout depends on how much you and your employer con-
tribute and how well your investments perform.
Examples of defined contribution plans include 401(k) plans, Employee
Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs), money purchase plans, and profit-sharing
plans.

Chapter 2: Acquainting Yourself with Pension Rules

Gotta Do It: ERISA’s Requirements 
for Pension Plans
At a bare minimum, ERISA requires that certain standards be met in order for
private pension plans to be considered tax-qualified (and therefore receive
favorable tax treatment and other benefits). Employers don’t have to estab-
lish retirement plans, but those that do must comply with the following
requirements:
 Regularly and automatically provide participants with important infor-
mation about the plan
 Set minimum standards for employee participation in the plan and for
employer funding
 Impose fiduciary duties on those who administer a plan (in other words,
set the standards of conduct, responsibilities, and obligations that must
be followed by those in charge of the plan)
 Provide participants the right to sue for the recovery of benefits and
breaches of fiduciary duties
 Guarantee the payment of certain benefits through the PBGC, which is
the federal agency that insures the pensions of employees covered by
private defined benefit pension plans
We discuss all these requirements in the following sections.
Disclosing certain plan information
Plan administrators are required by ERISA to give you (in writing) the most
important facts about your retirement plan’s features and funding. Some of
these facts must be provided to you automatically, and other facts are avail-
able to you upon your written request. Some are free of charge and others
require you to pay a copying fee.
By reviewing the information provided, you become an informed participant.
Only after understanding what your plan requires of you and how you
become eligible for benefits can you take the steps necessary to protect your
rights to your earned benefits. The list of information that you’re entitled to
receive includes the following:
 The summary plan description: One of the most important documents
that you’re entitled to receive is called the summary plan description, or
SPD. This document gives you a summary of what the plan provides and
how it operates. Your plan administrator is legally obligated to give you
a copy of the SPD when you become a participant of an ERISA-covered
30
Part I: Focusing on Pension Fundamentals 

plan or when you start receiving benefits under the plan. You must be
provided with a copy of the SPD within 30 days of your written request
to your employer.
If the plan is ever changed substantially, you must be informed through
a document called the summary of material modifications, which must be
given to you free of charge. Plans are also required to provide updated
versions of the SPD from time to time.
 Documents and instructions under which the plan operates: This
group of documents and instructions includes the plan document (the
complete document upon which the summary plan description is
based), the collective bargaining agreement, and the trust agreement.
Upon your written request, this information is available to you free of
charge for your inspection. Or for a reasonable copying fee, you can
request in writing that a copy of the information be mailed to you.
 The summary annual report: You’re entitled to automatically receive
the summary annual report (SAR) yearly and free of charge. This docu-
ment is a summary of the annual financial report that most retirement
plans must file with the Department of Labor on a document called the
Form 5500. (You can see a sample Form 5500 at www.irs.gov/forms
pubs; just search for it by name.)
Effective for plan years beginning after December 31, 2007, the Pension
Protection Act of 2006 (PPA) has repealed the requirement that defined
benefit plans provide a SAR. Instead, under the PPA, participants must
be provided with an annual funding notice (for each plan year) that
includes more specific information than previously required in the SAR.
To find out more about your plan’s assets and other financial matters
concerning the plan, you may also want to ask your plan administrator
for a copy of its full annual report.
 Notice to plan participants who are in underfunded plans: A defined
benefit plan that’s less than 90 percent funded must give notice to its
participants by reporting the funding level of the plan. This notice must
be provided free of charge and automatically within two months after
the due date for filing the annual report.
Federal law requires all multiemployer defined benefit plans to provide
an annual notice to participants, beneficiaries, and other interested par-
ties (including the PBGC) about the plans’ funding status.
The PPA increased the levels at which notice is required, and effective
for plan years beginning after December 31, 2007, you must be notified
within 30 days after benefit restrictions have been imposed on your
defined benefit plan as a result of its not reaching certain target percent-
age limits for funding. In 2008, for example, a plan that’s not within 92
percent of its target will be subject to restrictions; this percentage
increases each year until 2011, when you’ll be notified if your plan isn’t
100 percent funded.
31
Chapter 2: Acquainting Yourself with Pension Rules

 Individual benefit statement: Prior to the PPA, you were entitled to
receive this statement, which describes your total accrued benefits (total
benefits earned to date) and total nonforfeitable benefits (total of those
benefits that can’t be taken away from you), upon written request once
every 12 months, at no charge to you.
For plan years starting after December 31, 2006, defined contribution
plans must provide benefit statements to participants automatically, on
a quarterly basis if you self-direct your investments and on a yearly
basis if you don’t. (See Chapter 6 for more about self-directed invest-
ments.) In the case of defined benefit plans, the plan must either provide
a statement every three years or provide an annual notice informing par-
ticipants of their right to request such a statement in any given year.
These statements are provided at no charge to you.
The PPA has made significant changes to what these statements must pro-
vide, and although the model benefit statements that may be used by plan
administrators aren’t expected to be out before August 17, 2007, it’s antici-
pated that the statements will contain more detailed benefit information.
See Chapter 8 for more details about each of these documents and how to
request information in writing.
Setting minimum standards for 
participation, accrual, and vesting
Vesting refers to the amount of time that you must work before you earn the
right to your accrued benefits. When you’re fully vested, this means that your
accrued benefits belong to you, even if you leave the company before retire-
ment age. It’s important to know the rules and when you can expect to be
fully vested. Otherwise you may find yourself working forever (because you
won’t know when to stop) or not working long enough to get all the benefits
that you’ve earned.
Prior to ERISA, pension plan benefits were insecure because employees were
often required to work many years before they became vested in their retire-
ment plans. Because of ERISA, minimum standards for counting years of serv-
ice for vesting purposes exist, which means that plan benefits are more
stable. Plans may provide more generous vesting rules, but ERISA sets the
minimum standards that we describe in the following sections. (Check out
Chapter 7 for more information about eligibility, accrual, and vesting.)
Age and length of service
You must be permitted to participate in a pension plan if you’ve reached the
age of 21 and have completed one year of service. Plans other than 401(k)s
can require two years of service before you’re eligible to participate. However,
32
Part I: Focusing on Pension Fundamentals 

if the plan requires two years of service for eligibility, your benefits under the
plan must be 100 percent vested (not forfeitable) at all times. And if at the
time you’re hired, you’re an older worker who’s closer to retirement, your
employer can’t exclude you from plan participation on the grounds of age.
The protection of your benefits from reduction or elimination
Your pension plan provides you with a number of different rights and
options, and some of these rights are protected. Generally speaking, protected
rights can’t be reduced or eliminated; nor can they be granted or denied
based on the whim of your employer on any given day. Your protected rights
include the following:
 Early retirement benefits: If your employer offers the option to retire
earlier than the normal retirement age, the employer can’t amend the
plan in order to eliminate the right to take such early retirement as it
relates to benefits that you accrued before the amendment. But your
employer can amend the plan to take this right away for benefits that
you accrue after the date of the amendment.
 Retirement-type subsidies: These are subsidies paid under the plan that
are above and beyond the benefit paid under the plan’s basic benefit for-
mula. Your employer can’t retroactively eliminate these types of subsi-
dies for employees who ultimately meet the conditions for the benefit.
But the employer can eliminate the benefit for service in future years.
In addition, the employer can tell employees that if they want to take the
retirement-type subsidy, they won’t receive any further growth in their
benefit for service after the amendment eliminating the subsidy. This is
known as benefit wear-away.
 Accrued benefits: Even though ERISA doesn’t prohibit your employer
from amending its plan to reduce the rates that benefits will accrue in
the future, your employer must give you written notice of a significant
reduction in the rate of benefits before the plan amendment goes into
effect. In some cases, the amendment will not be effective if the notice
isn’t given.
Spelling out fiduciary obligations
ERISA sets forth fiduciary obligations to protect your plan from mismanage-
ment and misuse of assets. These obligations apply to anyone who has cer-
tain responsibilities to the plan or exercises authority or control over the
plan, such as administering it, managing it, or disposing of the plan’s assets.
The primary responsibility of a fiduciary is to run the plan solely in the inter-
est of participants and beneficiaries. (In other words, he or she works on
behalf of your interests, not the company’s.) A fiduciary must exercise care,
skill, and prudence and also must diversify plan investments to minimize the
33
Chapter 2: Acquainting Yourself with Pension Rules

risk of large losses. He or she must follow the terms of the plan documents
unless, of course, the documents are inconsistent with ERISA. In that case,
ERISA should be followed.
In addition to these fiduciary duties, ERISA prohibits fiduciaries from getting
involved in a conflict of interest. A conflict of interest in this case could be,
among other things, dealing with plan assets in the fiduciary’s own interest,
acting in a manner that’s adverse to the interests of the plan or its partici-
pants, or receiving any consideration (dollars or other means of compensa-
tion) for the fiduciary’s own personal account.
No consent is necessary for a person to be considered a fiduciary. If a person
has authority or exercises authority or control as explained earlier in the sec-
tion, he or she can be considered a fiduciary. For example, the following indi-
viduals are considered to be plan fiduciaries:
 Plan trustees
 Plan administrators
 Members of a plan’s investment or administrative committee
 Investment managers
 Any person who selects or appoints any of the previously mentioned
people
Chapter 10 has what you need to know about keeping an eye on your pension
plan’s fiduciaries.
Providing the right to file suit
Under ERISA you have a responsibility to file a claim for the benefits that
you’re due under your plan. And even more importantly, your plan is
required to set forth a reasonable procedure for processing your benefits
claim and for appealing if your claim is denied. Review your SPD to see how
your plan’s claim procedure works (see the earlier section “Disclosing certain
plan information” for more about the SPD).
If your plan fails to set up a claims procedure, the law requires you to present
your claim to the plan administrator, an officer of your employer, or the unit
that usually handles claims procedures. Other than notifying the plan admin-
istrator or the other folks we mention, your hands are pretty much tied
because suing won’t get you very far (a procedure will likely be specified, but
you won’t be paid any damages for your troubles).
In the following sections, we explain the general procedure set forth by ERISA
for appealing a denied claim and filing suit.
34
Part I: Focusing on Pension Fundamentals 

Appealing a denial
Your claim for benefits may be denied in whole if you haven’t yet worked for
your employer for the minimum number of years, if you aren’t the required
age, or if you’re otherwise not eligible for benefits. Or it may be denied in part
(meaning you don’t get all the benefits you think you have coming) if you
weren’t properly credited for the time you worked for this employer, if the
benefits were computed with the wrong interest rate, or if the plan simply
wants you to submit additional information.
If your claim for benefits is denied in whole or in part, the plan is obligated to
notify you of this in writing. This notification must be given within 90 days of
the plan’s receipt of your claim for benefits, and it must state the reasons for
the denial and the special plan provisions upon which the denial is based.
The written notice of the denial must also explain how to file an appeal.
The plan must provide you with at least 60 days to appeal any denial, and
typically the plan then has 60 days within which to issue its ruling. If the plan
notifies you in writing that it must hold a hearing, it may take an additional 60
days to issue its ruling.
Exhausting your administrative remedies
Ultimately, the plan must notify you of its final decision regarding your
appeal. It must also include the reasons that support its decision and any ref-
erences to the relevant plan documents. If the plan rules against you and you
disagree with this final ruling, your ship is not yet sunk. As long as you’ve fol-
lowed and completed (in timely manner) all the steps available to you as
spelled out in your plan’s claim procedure, you’ve exhausted your administra-
tive remedies (yes, that’s a technical term). If you’ve made it this far, courts
will permit you to file a lawsuit seeking your benefits under ERISA.
If you don’t exhaust your administrative remedies, you could lose the right to
sue in court. Courts may excuse a failure to exhaust if exhaustion is impossi-
ble for some reason or if it would be a completely futile exercise, but if at all
possible, we recommend that you exhaust.
See Chapter 18 for full details about undergoing the appeal process.
Filing a civil action under ERISA
As long as you’ve exhausted your administrative remedies as outlined in your
plan’s claim procedure, you’re entitled to file a civil action in a federal district
court in order to do any of the following:
 Recover the benefits due to you and to enforce your rights under the plan
 Obtain access to the plan documents that you’re entitled to receive and
that you requested in writing (and that were never given to you)
 Clarify your right to future benefits
35
Chapter 2: Acquainting Yourself with Pension Rules

 Stop any act that violates the terms of your plan
 Stop any act that violates the fiduciary obligations of ERISA, such as the
plan’s failure to act for the exclusive benefit of the participants or using
the assets of the plan for interested parties
 Stop the plan from improperly valuing plan assets
 Enforce your right to be provided a statement of your vested benefits
after you’ve terminated employment
 Obtain review of any action of the PBGC that affects you adversely
We explain how to find and hire a pension attorney in Chapter 19 and how to
prepare for pension litigation in Chapter 20.
Knowing that your employer can’t retaliate
Luckily, ERISA prohibits employers from retaliating against its employees in
order to avoid paying a benefit. In other words, it’s unlawful for an employer
to discharge, fine, suspend, expel, discipline, or discriminate against any
employee or his or her beneficiary for the purpose of interfering with their
rights under the plan or the law.
If you’re worried about how the actions you take to enforce your legal rights
may affect your job or your work environment, stop right there and remember
this: Your employer can’t take any of these actions if you exercise any of your
rights or prospective rights under a plan or under ERISA (or if you give infor-
mation or testimony in a proceeding that’s related to ERISA). It goes without
saying that the use of force or violence to coerce or intimidate you for the pur-
pose of interfering with your rights or prospective rights isn’t permitted and is
punishable by a fine of up to $10,000 and/or up to one year in prison.
You should note, though, that some employers still do illegal things. If your
employer does retaliate against you, it sometimes can be a long and expensive
process to have the statute enforced.
Federally enforcing pension rights
ERISA was enacted to protect your rights in qualified private retirement plans
by setting the minimum standards we discuss in the previous sections and by
providing remedies for you in case all doesn’t go as planned. The Department
of Labor and the Internal Revenue Service are in charge of interpreting and
enforcing your rights under ERISA. If you have a defined benefit plan, it’s
most likely protected and insured by the PBGC.
36
Part I: Focusing on Pension Fundamentals 

The Department of Labor
The Department of Labor (DOL) has the authority to enforce Title I of ERISA,
which sets forth participant rights and certain employer and fiduciary duties.
The DOL is also responsible for making sure that pension plans operate prop-
erly and that their assets are managed prudently.
The DOL’s Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) is the agency
that enforces the rules governing the conduct of plan managers, the invest-
ment of plan assets, the reporting and disclosure of plan information, and the
enforcement of the fiduciary provisions of ERISA.
Any of the plan documents we identify earlier in the chapter can be obtained
directly from the DOL for a nominal copying charge, which they’ll bill you for.
You can find out more information about getting these documents from the
DOL by going to www.dol.gov/ebsa/publications/how_to_obtain_
docs.html.

here’s the mailing address and the phone number of the DOL:

The Internal Revenue Service
The U.S. Treasury Department’s Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is responsible
for ensuring compliance with the Internal Revenue Code and its rules for
operating a tax-qualified pension plan, including pension plan funding and
vesting requirements.
The IRS Web site (www.irs.gov) contains forms and documents that you
can easily download. It also provides information about a variety of tax
topics, including IRAs and other retirement plans. Finally, if you want to, you
can download publications dealing with tax changes and new legislation.
The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
ERISA established the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), which
is an agency of the federal government that guarantees and insures defined
benefit plans by administering the plan termination insurance program. For
example, if you’re in a defined benefit pension plan that doesn’t have enough
money to pay you all the benefits that you’ve been promised, the PBGC may
37
Chapter 2: Acquainting Yourself with Pension Rules

terminate your plan, take it over, and pay out benefits up to the current limits
set by law. (In 2007, the maximum amount guaranteed for retirees age 65 is
$49,500 per year. The max amount is a bit higher or lower depending on
whether you’re over or under age 65.)
How is the PBGC able to do this? The sponsors of the defined benefit plans pay
insurance premiums established by Congress, just like insurance premiums
you pay for things like auto or homeowner’s insurance. In addition to the
insurance premiums, the PBGC’s operations are financed by investment
income.
To find out more about the PBGC and to see whether it insures your pension,
go to www.pbgc.gov. You can also reach the PBGC by e-mail (through a link
on the Web site) or by mail or phone at:
PBGC
P.O. Box 151750
Alexandria, VA 22315-1750
Phone: 800-400-7242
When contacting the PBGC, it’s helpful if you provide your Social Security
number and the plan’s name or number, which is located in the upper left
corner of correspondence to you from the PBGC. You can also find this infor-
mation on the plan documents.

Tax-Qualified Plans
In This Chapter

T
he government supports employment-based retirement benefits that are
voluntarily provided by businesses. It shows its support by granting
employers favorable tax treatment as long as their retirement plans meet cer-
tain requirements set out by the Internal Revenue Code and the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). If a retirement plan satisfies
such requirements, it is considered tax-qualified. As we discuss in Chapter 2,
the perks of tax-qualified plans are a big deal for everyone: Employers can
take a tax deduction for their plan contributions, employees don’t pay taxes
on plan assets until they receive the money, and earnings on qualified plans
are tax-deferred.
In this chapter, we hit the highlights of qualified plans and discuss why some
plans are a better fit than others. See Appendix B for charts that compare the
major types of tax-qualified plans and list the limitations on contributions
and benefits.
You Get What You Give: Defined
Contribution Plans
Defined contribution plans are those in which you, your employer, or both of
you contribute money to an investment account whose purpose is to accrue
money for your retirement. In a defined contribution plan:

 An individual account is provided for each employee, into which the
employee or the employer (or both) contributes. The contributions can
be at a set rate or be based on a percentage of the employee’s compen-
sation. The contributions are then invested on the employee’s behalf.
Employer contributions may be either mandatory or discretionary,
depending on the type of plan.
 An employee has no way of knowing how much the plan will ultimately
provide upon retirement. The final payout is based on the amount of
yearly contributions made before retirement and how well the investments
perform (see Chapter 6 for more about the investing of plan assets).
 There are restrictions as to when and how the funds can be withdrawn
without being socked with penalties.
We discuss these important basics of defined contribution plans and the
many different types of plans in the following sections.
Beginning with basics on benefits, 
contributions, and limitations
Employers that are considering whether to sponsor a defined contribution
plan have several options. All the options take into consideration the benefits
that the employer hopes to offer employees, the contributions the employer
is able to make or wants to commit to making, and the maximum contribution
limits that change year to year in order to keep up with inflation.
What factors affect your ultimate retirement benefit?
Defined contribution plans are referred to as individual account plans. Each
participant’s ultimate benefit under the plan is dependent on the amount that
has accumulated in the participant’s plan account at the time the employee
begins receiving benefits. While the contributions are defined or determined
each year, the ultimate retirement benefit is based on these factors:
 Credits: A participant’s account under a defined contribution plan may
be credited with the following:
• Employer and employee contributions
• Investment earnings or losses
In the case of profit-sharing plans, the participant’s account is also cred-
ited with forfeitures from the accounts of other participants who termi-
nate employment before being fully vested under the plan.
 Deductions: Plan administrative expenses may be charged against the
account.
40
Part I: Focusing on Pension Fundamentals 

What’s the maximum contribution?
The maximum contribution to an individual’s account under a defined contri-
bution plan for a given year is the lesser of 100 percent of the individual’s
compensation or a specific dollar limit. For example, in 2007, the dollar limit
for employer and employee contributions and any forfeitures is $45,000.
These maximum contribution amounts by the employer and employee are
called the limitations on annual additions. Investment earnings aren’t part of
the annual additions.
Although the dollar limit is $45,000 in 2007, this amount is adjusted annually
due to inflation. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) typically issues a notice
in October or November of each year to unveil the limits for the following
year. Go to www.irs.gov to get this updated information.
Employee contributions to 401(k) plans (which we discuss later in this chap-
ter and also in Chapter 4) fall under their own set of limitations. In this type
of plan, an employee can elect to have the employer contribute, on a pretax
basis, a portion of his or her wages. These wages, which are deferred from
the employee on a salary reduction basis, are contributed directly to the
401(k) plan. These deferred wages are called elective deferrals.
The maximum elective deferral that an individual can defer into a 401(k) plan
for a given year is limited to the lesser of 100 percent of compensation or a
specific dollar amount set by the IRS, which is adjusted each year for infla-
tion. (The dollar amount for 2007 is $15,500.) Remember that the elective
deferrals are included in the maximum amount that can be contributed
yearly to a defined contribution plan. In other words, the $15,500 is part of
the $45,000 basic limit (for 2007).
Individuals age 50 or older are permitted to defer up to an additional $5,000
to a defined contribution plan each year. These additional contributions are
called catch-up contributions because they’re designed to help older employ-
ees who haven’t yet saved enough to “catch up.” These contributions are in
addition to both the normal elective deferral limits and the annual addition
limitations. So for 2007, an individual age 50 or older can defer a total of
$20,500 ($15,500 + $5,000) and receive total contributions to the plan of
$50,000 ($45,000 + $5,000).
How and when can you make withdrawals?
Withdrawals from defined contribution plans are subject to strict rules. As a
general rule, distributions aren’t allowed before you terminate employment
with the employer that’s sponsoring the plan. However, under certain circum-
stances, distributions can be made prior to termination. These distributions,
which are referred to as in-service distributions, are usually restricted to the
occurrence of certain events, such as when you reach a certain age (591⁄2, for
41
Chapter 3: Exploring the World of Tax-Qualified Plans

example) or when hardships occur (maybe you need money for medical
expenses or to prevent eviction or foreclosure). In Chapter 9, we discuss dis-
tributions in more detail.
In order for withdrawals or in-service distributions to even be considered,
they must be provided for in your plan document. Make sure you have a copy
of your summary plan description (SPD) early on to see what benefits your
plan provides in the event that you experience a hardship and need a little
help. (Check out Chapter 2 for more on the SPD.)
Surveying different defined 
contribution plans
These days more companies are offering defined contribution plans rather
than defined benefit plans. Part of the reason is because these plans provide
more options to employers in terms of when and how they choose to con-
tribute, or whether they contribute at all. Employees share the responsibility
of contributing to their defined contribution retirement plans with their
employers, thereby lessening the burden on those employers who choose 
to contribute to their employees’ retirement accounts. Defined contribution
plans also are inexpensive to set up and administer compared to defined ben-
efit plans. This is because defined benefit plans involve extra expenses, such
as hiring an actuary to determine the proper funding levels for future defined
benefits.
Depending on the employer’s size, how much it’s financially able to con-
tribute, and how much it’s willing to contribute, there are a variety of defined
contribution plans to choose from. We explain them in the following sections.
You’ll find two of the charts in Appendix B particularly helpful for comparing
these types of plans: the Comparison of Types of Tax-Qualified Retirement
Plans chart and the Retirement Plan Dollar and Percentage Limits chart.
Profit-sharing plans
Profit-sharing plans are the most flexible of all qualified plans and are used for
sharing profits from the business with employees, whether or not the busi-
ness has profits in a given year. If it has been a good year, the employer may
be more inclined to make a generous contribution, but that’s its choice. The
employer isn’t obligated to make contributions to the plan every year, but
each year that it does, it may contribute any amount between 0 percent and
25 percent (or 15 percent for plan years commencing prior to 2002) of the
annual compensation of the covered employees. Because employer contribu-
tions aren’t mandatory, the contributions that employers make are called dis-
cretionary contributions. Employees don’t contribute to these plans.
42
Part I: Focusing on Pension Fundamentals 

Profit-sharing plans are a great choice for employers that aren’t sure how
much they can contribute each year. Because these plans aren’t actually tied
to profits and because the contributions are totally discretionary on a year-
to-year basis, what’s not for the employer to like?
It’s also easy to see why profit-sharing plans are so popular among employees.
To employees, these plans mean that an additional chunk of money is being
put away for their retirement. And even though it’s discretionary whether
they’ll receive a profit-sharing contribution each year, when they do, it’s a
bonus, because employees receive it without contributing anything (unless
you count the time and energy that they contribute to the company each day).
401(k) plans
A 401(k) plan is a retirement plan sponsored by the employer that allows the
employees to elect to defer a portion of their compensation into the plan.
These deferrals, which are called elective deferrals, are typically made on a
pretax basis, meaning that the money is contributed with pretax dollars.
Taxes are deferred until the money is taken out.
It’s up to the employer whether it wants to have a 401(k) plan to which only 
the employees contribute or whether the employer itself will also contribute 
in some way, such as matching its employees’ contributions or making profit-
sharing contributions (which are referred to as employer nonelective contribu-
tions). A 401(k) plan is a good choice for employers that want their employees
to help with the funding of their retirement benefits.
With a 401(k) plan, not only are you provided with a retirement plan into
which you can (and should) defer wages, tax-free, but if your employer offers
to match your contribution or provide profit-sharing contributions, this is
like free money to you. Simply put, you’ll receive retirement contributions
that you wouldn’t otherwise get if you didn’t defer on your own. You’d be
crazy not to take full advantage of any match that’s offered.
Because of the recent popularity of 401(k) plans, which allow both employers
and employees to make pretax retirement contributions, we devote Chapter 4
to these plans.
Cross-tested profit-sharing plans
A cross-tested profit-sharing plan is a profit-sharing plan that allows employers
to provide different levels of contributions to different classifications of
employees. In other words, this plan allows employers to have a contribution
percentage formula for one category of participants that’s greater than the
contribution percentage formula for other categories of participants. These
plans are cross-tested, meaning that special tests (called nondiscrimination
43
Chapter 3: Exploring the World of Tax-Qualified Plans

tests) are applied to make sure the plan doesn’t discriminate in favor of the
highly compensated employees (HCEs). As with other profit-sharing plans, the
amount of the contribution is discretionary and employees don’t contribute.
Because cross-tested plans can be designed to provide higher levels of contri-
butions to some classes of employees and not others, employers can provide
older or more highly compensated employees (including the owners) with
larger retirement plan contributions than are provided to other employees.
HCEs often prefer increased retirement plan contributions over increased com-
pensation because they understand and appreciate the tax benefits of qualified
plans. The only downside to this type of plan is that it’s more complicated for
the employer to administer than an ordinary profit-sharing plan. However, this
disadvantage may be outweighed by the benefits.
As a general rule, the contributions under a cross-tested plan on behalf of
HCEs can’t be more than three times the percentage of compensation con-
tributed on behalf of non–highly compensated employees (NHCEs). For exam-
ple, if HCEs receive a contribution of 9 percent of compensation, NHCEs must
receive at least 3 percent of compensation.
Money purchase pension plans
A money purchase pension plan is funded by the employer, which may con-
tribute up to 25 percent of the compensation of all eligible employees. The
employer’s contributions to the plan are fixed without regard to the employer’s
profits. Instead, they’re usually based on a fixed percentage of each partici-
pant’s compensation. Employees don’t contribute to this type of plan.
The money purchase plan may be appropriate for employers that can deter-
mine profit trends and don’t mind being required to make yearly contribu-
tions to the plan. The obligation on the part of the employer to fund a money
purchase pension plan makes this type of plan different from most profit-
sharing plans. As we explain earlier in this chapter, it’s okay if employers
choose not to contribute to profit-sharing plans because their contributions
are discretionary. But with a money purchase pension plan, the company’s
contributions are mandatory. If the company fails to make a contribution, it
can incur a penalty tax. So if the company has a bad year financially and can’t
afford to make the contribution it said it would, it’s too bad, so sad for the
company. These days, employers are frequently choosing not to adopt
money purchase pension plans (or they’re rethinking the continuation of
them). This is because profit-sharing plans now provide companies tax-
deductible advantages, with flexibility and discretion to boot.
From your point of view as an employee, this is a great deal. Your employer
has committed to making annual contributions on your behalf. Essentially,
you’re being rewarded for your loyalty. Do remember that money purchase
plans require that the plan provide survivor benefits for spouses (unless the
employee and spouse agree to forego such benefits).
44
Part I: Focusing on Pension Fundamentals 

Plans that are collectively bargained by unions are often money purchase
pension plans because the collective bargaining agreements require manda-
tory employer contributions to the plans.
Target benefit pension plans
A target benefit pension plan is a type of defined contribution plan under
which contributions are weighted in favor of older employees. For example, a
55-year-old employee may receive a contribution equal to 20 percent of com-
pensation, while a 35-year-old employee may receive 8 percent in the same
plan. For the most part, target benefit plans have been replaced by cross-
tested profit-sharing plans, which provide greater flexibility in terms of both
contributions and plan design than target benefit plans.
Employee stock ownership plans
An employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) is a tax-qualified defined contribu-
tion plan that allows employees to become owners of their employer’s stock.
In fact, stock ownership is the whole purpose of ESOPs — they’re put into
place to encourage employees to participate in corporate ownership. An
ESOP is the only employee benefit plan that’s required by law to invest pri-
marily in the stock of the sponsoring employer.
ESOPs may be used by corporations to raise capital for the corporation or, in
the case of a privately held company, to purchase stock from a shareholder.
Tax advantages of the ESOP make the borrowing of funds less expensive
through the ESOP than if the corporation borrowed the funds directly from 
a bank.
One potential danger of an ESOP for plan participants is the lack of diversifi-
cation of the investments, because at least 50 percent of the plan’s assets is
required to be invested in stock of the sponsoring employer. It’s never a good
idea to have a majority of your assets in any particular investment, but it can
be particularly devastating when that one particular investment is in the
stock of your employer. In such a situation, the employer’s failure can cost
you not only your job but your retirement savings as well. Other downsides
for the participants can include the following:
 Employee securities can be improperly valued.
 Employee stock can be improperly allocated to individual participant
accounts.
 Voting rights may not be provided to plan participants.
 The employer’s loans aren’t primarily in the interests of plan 
participants.
 Fraud, embezzlement, theft, or other criminal actions can occur.

Benefits from the Boss: 
Defined Benefit Plans
Defined benefit plans are traditional retirement plans that promise a fixed
monthly benefit for life when an employee retires (much like Social Security).
The plan may state this promised benefit as an exact dollar amount, such as
$100 per month at retirement. Or the employer may calculate a benefit through
a plan formula typically based on the employee’s age, years of service, and
average compensation for a certain period of time. Defined benefit plans are
generally funded entirely by the employer, meaning that employees don’t
contribute to these plans.
The employer’s contribution in any given year isn’t fixed, but it’s determined
actuarially. For example, the plan’s actuary estimates how much the plan will
ultimately have to pay in benefits and how much investment return the plan
will earn. Using complex formulas, the actuary then tells the employer how
much it should contribute in each year so that the plan will be able to keep
its benefit promises. Because it’s unlikely that the actuary’s guesstimates
about the future will be completely accurate, the actuary is constantly adjust-
ing the amount that the employer will have to contribute in each future year.
For example, if the actuary guesses that the plan will earn 8 percent on invest-
ments but the plan actually makes 10 percent, the plan will then have more
assets than the actuary predicted, which means that the employer may be
able to reduce future contributions for a period of time.
Despite the large selection of defined contribution plans (which we discuss ear-
lier in this chapter), there are only three types of defined benefit plans: the tra-
ditional defined benefit plan, the cash balance (or hybrid) plan, and the 412(i)
plan. We discuss these plans, as well as basics about the benefits, contribu-
tions, and limitations to defined benefit plans, in the following sections.
A few terms may be new to you as you read more about defined benefit plans.
Understanding these terms will help you better understand the plans them-
selves (we go into more detail about these terms in Chapter 9):
 An accrued benefit is the portion of your normal retirement benefit that
you have earned at a given point in your career. For example, under a
traditional defined benefit plan, the accrued benefit is the amount that
you would receive monthly for life starting at the plan’s normal retire-
ment age (generally, age 62 to 65).
 An annuity is a series of equal payments to a person at evenly spaced
intervals, usually for life.
46
Part I: Focusing on Pension Fundamentals 

 A lump sum is exactly what it sounds like: You receive all your benefits at
once. However, if you want your benefits distributed in one fell swoop
rather than over a period of time, the lump-sum distribution must be the
present value of the accrued benefit. Present value simply means the
value, in today’s dollars, of promised future payments. Most traditional
defined benefit plans don’t permit lump-sum distributions.
Looking at benefits, contributions, 
and limitations
Unlike limitations to defined contribution plans that are based on annual con-
tributions to the plan, the limitations on defined benefit plans are based on
the benefits that can be distributed from the plan. The maximum annual ben-
efit under a defined benefit plan is the lesser of 100 percent of average annual
compensation or a specific dollar amount, which is adjusted each year for
inflation. (The dollar amount for 2007 is $180,000.) The annual benefit limit is
based on benefits commencing at age 62. So, the limit is reduced for benefit
payments commencing prior to age 62 and increased for benefit payments
commencing after age 65.
The IRS adjusts the dollar amounts each year based on the preceding 12-month
period rates of inflation. The updated dollar limits are usually announced after
September 30 each year, usually sometime in October. Go to www.irs.gov for
the updated dollar limits.
Benefits for participants with fewer than 10 years of participation under the
plan must be proportionately reduced. For example, a retiring participant
with five years of participation in a defined benefit plan would have a maxi-
mum annual benefit of 50 percent of compensation.
Checking out different 
defined benefit plans
The different types of defined benefit plans provide different advantages and
disadvantages. For example, traditional defined benefit plans are best for
older employees who have spent all or most of their careers with a single
employer. Younger employees who may change jobs several times during
their careers may benefit more from cash balance plans. We explain the
details in the following sections.
47
Chapter 3: Exploring the World of Tax-Qualified Plans

Traditional defined benefit plans
Under a traditional defined benefit plan, the level of benefits you’ll receive at
retirement is fixed by the plan’s formula. However, the employer’s contribu-
tion in any given year varies according to the plan’s actuarial assumptions,
methods, and experience. The plan is based on three factors: your age, your
salary, and the number of years you’ve generously given of yourself to your
employer’s workforce. Because of this, your pension benefit grows slowly at
first but takes off as you get older, your salary increases, and you’ve put more
years of service into the pot.
There can be an endless set of variations for the employer to choose from in
selecting a formula that designates how you receive a defined benefit plan’s
benefits. Your plan must state the selected formula in the SPD. Some exam-
ples of plan formulas include the following:
 Flat benefit plan: The benefit under the plan is a flat dollar amount after
a specified number of years. For example, a participant who has at least
10 years of service may receive a benefit of $500 per month at age 65.
 Fixed benefit plan: The benefit under the plan is a fixed percentage of
compensation — such as 10 percent of your average monthly compensa-
tion starting at age 65.
 Unit benefit plan: The benefit under the plan is based on either a speci-
fied unit dollar amount multiplied by years of service or a percentage of
compensation multiplied by years of service.
Contributions by the employer to a defined benefit plan are mandatory.
ERISA sets minimum funding rules to ensure that sufficient money is available
to pay promised future benefits to you when you retire. These funding rules
have been amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006. The employer is
now allowed to contribute larger amounts than projected to ensure proper
funding for the future defined benefit. However, if the plan investments fall
below what’s projected, the employer is required to make additional contri-
butions to make up for the shortfall. Any employer that fails to comply with
the minimum funding requirements is subject to severe sanctions provided
by ERISA for its failure to meet the funding obligations.
Some of the advantages of traditional defined benefit plans include the
following:
 Guaranteed retirement income security for employees
 No investment risk to participants
 Is funded entirely by the employer
 Rewards an employee’s longevity and age with higher benefits
48
Part I: Focusing on Pension Fundamentals 

Employers like the idea of providing their employees with a guaranteed level of
retirement benefits with the traditional defined benefit plan. But that’s about it
for the plus side; defined benefit plans are more expensive for employers to
administer than defined contribution plans. And they’re somewhat inflexible
due to the mandatory funding obligations.
Today, many traditional defined benefit plans are in trouble because the cash
that’s available to meet these promised future benefits is dependent on the
fluctuations of the plan’s investment portfolio. In other words, the employer
contributes to the pension plan, and the plan managers then invest the con-
tributions in order to earn interest and increase the fund balance. Because a
defined benefit plan funds a benefit to be paid in the future, the employer
bears the risk that the fund won’t be sufficiently funded at the time that
retirement distributions need to be paid out. When the stock market is stag-
nant or when the economy is poor, the fund’s investments may grow too
slowly. Over 70 percent of the companies in the S&P 500 have defined benefit
plans, and the deficits in these plans amount to more than $182 billion! In the
event that the plan isn’t sufficiently funded, the employer must increase its
contributions to the plan.
49
Chapter 3: Exploring the World of Tax-Qualified Plans
How did my defined benefit plan 
become underfunded?
Today, some defined benefit plans are under-
funded, which means that they don’t have
enough assets to pay all of the benefits that have
already been earned. How does this happen?
There are five major reasons:
 The plan may have suffered poor invest-
ment performance.
 The employer may not have been contribut-
ing enough to the plan, even though the
employer may have been complying with
ERISA’s minimum funding standards.
 Interest rates may have fallen, therefore
increasing the expense of paying benefits.
 Some employers increased benefit levels a
few years back and haven’t yet fully funded
those benefit increases.
 Some plans allow employees to choose
among different forms of benefits (for
example, an employee may be allowed to
choose a lump-sum distribution instead of
an annuity), and sometimes one benefit
turns out to be especially valuable and is
selected by larger-than-expected numbers
of employees.
Due to the uncertainty of the funding require-
ments, many employers have been terminating
their traditional defined benefit plans in recent
years and replacing them with 401(k) plans or
cash balance plans.

Cash balance or hybrid plans
A recent trend, especially among large employers, has been to convert tradi-
tional defined benefit plans to hybrid pension plans, which are also known as
cash balance plans. These plans are defined benefit plans that are designed to
mimic the benefits of defined contribution plans.
Even though cash balance plans are designed to mimic defined contribution
plans, they contain many of the most important advantages of defined benefit
plans. For example, benefits don’t depend on how much an employee is will-
ing or able to contribute, as in a 401(k) plan, and the employer bears the
investment risk (not the employee). And like the traditional defined benefit
plan, the cash balance plan offers payment of an employee’s benefit in the
form of a series of payments for life. Almost all cash balance plans, however,
also offer a lump sum payment option, which is the form of benefit that most
cash balance participants elect.
The retirement benefits in a cash balance plan are described differently than
in a traditional defined benefit plan, in which benefits are expressed as a
retirement annuity. In a cash balance plan the benefit is expressed as an
account balance, a dollar amount, that grows over time. The account is cred-
ited annually with the following two amounts:
 A pay credit, which is simply a percentage of the employee’s compensa-
tion for the year
 An interest credit on the balance of the account
At retirement, the account balance is converted to an annuity benefit under a
formula in the plan.
The way the benefit grows in a cash balance plan looks very much like a
defined contribution plan, but it’s different in a fundamental way: There
aren’t really accounts. These “accounts” are often referred to as hypothetical
accounts because they don’t reflect actual contributions to an account or
actual gains and losses of the account.
One major difference between a traditional defined benefit plan and a cash
balance plan is that older workers in a traditional defined benefit plan earn
more valuable benefits each year than younger workers. In cash balance
plans, however, the value of a year’s benefit accrual can be identical for older
and younger workers with the same salary.
Cash balance plans also often permit vested participants (those who have
worked enough years to have their benefits under the plan be vested, or 
not forfeitable) to choose to receive their benefits in a lump sum if they ter-
minate their employment (whether they quit or are fired) prior to retirement
50
Part I: Focusing on Pension Fundamentals 

age. If a participant has a spouse, this election must be accompanied by 
the spouse’s consent. (See Chapter 9 for more information about lump-sum 
distributions.)
Younger employees find cash balance plans particularly attractive because
their benefits are generally accrued at the same level as the benefits of older
employees. Cash balance plans are also advantageous for those who don’t
spend entire careers with one employer but instead work for several different
ones. This is because benefits in cash balance plans, like benefits in defined
contribution plans (but unlike most traditional defined benefit plans), tend to
be portable. In other words, the benefits are generally payable in a lump sum
to the employee upon termination of employment and can be rolled over to
an individual retirement account (IRA) or to the retirement plan of a subse-
quent employer.
Older employees, on the other hand, may not prefer cash balance plans. If an
employer switches from a traditional defined benefit plan to a cash balance
plan, older employees who’ve worked for the same employer for many years
can see their pension benefits drastically reduced. This reduction happens
because employees generally accrue the largest portion of their retirement
benefits after age 50 in traditional defined benefit plans. Benefit accruals for
older employees under cash balance plans are often much lower than the
benefit accruals under traditional defined benefit plans. It’s no wonder that
older employees see themselves at a disadvantage.
Employers may prefer cash balance plans because the level of contributions
tends to be more predictable.
412(i) plans
A 412(i) plan is a tax-qualified, employer-sponsored defined benefit plan that
promises employees that, upon retirement, they will receive a specific benefit
amount annually (or more frequently) based on a formula that considers com-
pensation, years of service, or both. Employers contribute to 412(i) plans just
as they do to other defined benefit plans. These plans are fully insured and
funded exclusively by a combination of life insurance and annuity investment
contracts, or annuity investment contracts alone. Investments are guaranteed
by the insurance company, so employees face no risk with regard to the invest-
ment aspect of the plan. Because the benefits are guaranteed and paid by an
insurance company, section 412(i) plans are often called fully insured plans.
Don’t be confused by the term annuity investment contract. When we talk
about annuities earlier in this chapter, we mean a form of payment that’s
spread out over a person’s life. Here we discuss insurance and annuity 
contracts as investment vehicles purchased from an insurance company.
51
Chapter 3: Exploring the World of Tax-Qualified Plans

These plans receive special treatment under Internal Revenue Code Section
412(i), which is why they’re called 412(i) plans.
A 412(i) plan may appear to be desirable to an employer that owns a highly
profitable small business or professional practice that has no more than five
to ten employees and that produces a steady stream of cash flow to meet the
annual or more frequent contributions required to be made to the plan. This
special type of defined benefit plan allows for maximizing tax-deductible con-
tributions, and it generates the maximum deduction allowed by any type of
plan on a fully guaranteed basis.
With 412(i) plans, however, the interest rates guaranteed by the insurance
company are often quite low, and the plans can be subject to high fees and
other charges. Additionally, these plans have been subject to special scrutiny
by the IRS due to perceived abuses with such plans. These abuses are largely
related to providing excessive benefits to the owners of the businesses that
are sponsoring the plans.
Section 412(i) plans may appear to be attractive to employees because an
insurance company guarantees a rate of return on the investment of the
plan’s assets and because these plans may provide greater contributions in
early years than other types of defined benefit plans. However, the guaran-
teed return is usually at a very low rate so that more of the benefits under the
plan will be based on the employer’s contributions to the plan and less will
be based on the plan’s investment performance. So, the employer may have
larger contributions in a 412(i) plan to produce the same level of benefits pro-
vided in a traditional defined benefit plan.
Something Special: Other 
Retirement Plans
In addition to defined contribution and defined benefit plans, there are two
special types of tax-qualified pension plans for certain employers. These
plans include the following:
 Section 403(b) plans, which provide benefits for certain tax-exempt
employers and employees of public schools
 Section 457 plans, which provide retirement benefits for employees of
state and local governments
52
Part I: Focusing on Pension Fundamentals 

Section 403(b) plans
A Section 403(b) plan is also known as a tax-sheltered annuity plan, or TSA.
The plan is referred to as a 403(b) plan because it is established pursuant to
Section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. It’s also covered under ERISA.
Any eligible employee can participate in a 403(b) plan. An eligible employee
includes the following people:
 Employees of tax-exempt organizations established under Section
501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code
 Employees of public school systems who are involved in the day-to-day
operations of a school
 Employees of cooperative hospital service organizations
 Certain ministers
Section 403(b) plans permit employees to elect to defer compensation in the
same manner as 401(k) plans, which we discuss earlier in this chapter.
Similar to 401(k) plans, 403(b) plans can also provide for employer matching
contributions and other employer nonelective contributions. The pros and
cons of these plans are the same as those of 401(k) plans.
Section 457 plans
Section 457 plans are retirement plans sponsored by state and local govern-
ments to provide retirement benefits for their employees. The tax treatment
of such plans is governed under Section 457 of the Internal Revenue Code.
Unlike other plans, however, such plans are governed by state law. The
design of the plans and the level of benefits for state and local government
employees are governed by the legislature of the particular state and by state
boards, such as a public employee retirement system governing board.
These plans frequently are based on a combination of employee and
employer (the employer being the state or local government) contributions
and benefits and are often restricted to annuity-type payouts providing
monthly benefits to the employee and the employee’s surviving spouse.
Each state’s plan is unique, so if you’re a state or local government employee
who wants to know more about Section 457 plans, contact the particular
board in your state.

Using 401(k) Plans 
to Your Advantage
In This Chapter
 Acknowledging the advantages of the 401(k)
 Surveying the basics of the traditional 401(k)
 Examining alternatives to traditional 401(k)s
I
n Chapter 3, you become familiar with the basics of defined contribution
plans; both you and your employer make contributions to such a plan. In
this chapter, we focus on a special, extremely popular type of defined contribu-
tion plan: the 401(k). With this type of plan, you may voluntarily contribute a
portion of your salary, pretax, to an account, and your employer may match
some or all of your contribution. Your contributions are deferred (paid directly)
into your account. So, you save money for retirement before you see it, and in
this way, you don’t really feel like you’re parting with it. Your funds grow, tax
free, until they’re withdrawn.
There is a wide variety of 401(k)s out there, and we give you an overview in
this chapter. Be sure to check out 401(k)s For Dummies by Ted Benna and
Brenda Watson Newmann (Wiley) for full details on these plans.
Chances are that your employer first tells you about the type of retirement
plan it offers when you’re either interviewing for a job or hired. Many work-
places these days have employee handbooks or personnel manuals that con-
tain information about working for the company, including a section on
retirement benefits offered, such as a 401(k). For more information about the
kind of 401(k) your company offers and whether it makes any contributions,
you can also request a copy of the plan’s summary plan description (SPD).
When it’s time to sign up for the 401(k), your employer will give you a form
known as an elective deferral form and provide you more specific information.

Understanding the Benefits 
of 401(k) Plans
If you’re an employee and you’re given the option to participate in a 401(k),
especially where your employer will match your contributions, you’d be a
fool not to take advantage of the opportunity. Basically, with this plan, you’re
getting free money just for saving a portion of your own salary. It doesn’t get
better than that!
Here are some additional reasons why you should love the 401(k):
 You get to decide whether you want to contribute to your account,
and you also get to decide how much you want to set aside. And to top
it off, these contributions are all done on a pretax basis (in other words,
you contribute money from your salary before taxes are taken out). If
your employer offers matching contributions, the more you contribute,
the larger the match and the quicker your retirement fund will grow. (We
discuss your contributions and your employer’s later in this chapter.)
 Participants age 50 and older are allowed to make additional “catch-
up” contributions to their accounts. These contributions allow folks
who are closer to retirement age to save more money for retirement. You
can find out more about catch-up contributions later in this chapter.
 You’re immediately 100 percent vested when it comes to your own
contributions. In other words, your contributions can’t be taken away
from you, no matter what. Your money is yours!
Employer matching contributions may not vest until a certain number of
years have passed. For example, if you leave your job with a company
before you’re 100 percent vested, the nonvested portion of your benefits
(those from your employer) will be forfeited. (We give you the scoop on
vesting later in this chapter.)
 The more you contribute pretax to your 401(k), the lower your taxes
will be. And who doesn’t want lower taxes?
 When you leave the company, you may be able to take your benefits
with you. Unlike many pension plans, with 401(k)s, generally all your
contributions can be moved from one company’s plan to the next com-
pany’s plan or to an IRA if you change jobs (see Chapter 5 for more
about IRAs). This ability to move your contributions is referred to in the
tax world as portability.
 The money that you and your employer contribute has the potential 
to grow and multiply (like rabbits!). This growth may happen through
investments in stocks, mutual funds, money market funds, savings
accounts, and other investment vehicles. (Chapter 6 has more informa-
tion about investments in pension plans.)
56
Part I: Focusing on Pension Fundamentals 

 Contributions aren’t taxed by the federal government at the time
they’re made. You don’t pay any taxes on the money until you take a
distribution from the plan. (Chapter 9 has pension distribution basics.)
 You can withdraw money without a penalty if you terminate employ-
ment with your employer after your 55th birthday. Although your
withdrawal before age 591⁄2 may be subject to a 10 percent penalty, if you
terminate employment with your employer after you turn 55, you aren’t
subject to that penalty.
 401(k) plans can permit loans and hardship withdrawals. If you run
into financial hard times, your plan may allow you to take a withdrawal
to pay certain specified hardships you’ve run into. We discuss these
perks later in the chapter.
 Your 401(k) is protected by the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974 (ERISA). It’s protected because it’s a personal investment
program for your retirement (Chapter 2 has more on ERISA).
Looking at the Traditional 401(k) Plan
A company of any type and size (whether it’s a start-up or an established big
business) that’s interested in allowing its employees to make a higher level of
salary deferral than they can in other retirement plans is likely to offer a tra-
ditional 401(k). Does that description fit your employer? If so, it’s essential to
understand the basics of the traditional 401(k) plan.
The rules governing the traditional 401(k)
A 401(k) plan is considered tax-qualified under Section 401(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code and enjoys tax-deferred benefits if it satisfies the general qualifi-
cation requirements for defined contribution plans that we discuss in
Chapter 2. What sets the 401(k) apart from other retirement plans is that it
must contain provisions regarding the following:
 Employees may elect to have a portion of their salary deferred to the
qualified retirement plan (sometimes called a trust).
 The amounts that an employee contributes to a plan may be distributed
only upon retirement, death, or termination of employment. Under cer-
tain situations, distributions may be made while the employee is still
working (these are called in-service distributions), but they’re usually
restricted to the occurrence of specific events, such as reaching age 591⁄2,
suffering a disability or hardship, or the termination of the plan.
 The amounts that employees contribute must at all times be fully vested.
57
Chapter 4: Using 401(k) Plans to Your Advantage

We know that you’ll groan if we introduce even more rules regarding 401(k)
plans, but we must (you don’t want to lose out on any money, do you?). So,
remember that 401(k)s are also subject to the following special qualification
rules:
 The eligibility requirement for joining a 401(k) can’t be more than one
year of service. (We discuss eligibility for pensions in Chapter 7.)
 Elective contributions must meet a nondiscrimination test — the Actual
Deferral Percentage (ADP) test — demonstrating that plans don’t dis-
criminate in favor of highly compensated employees. (See the nearby
sidebar for more about nondiscrimination tests.) The ADP test com-
pares the deferral rates of highly compensated versus non–highly com-
pensated employees to make sure that companies extend their 401(k)
plans to the rank-and-file employees, not just the higher-ups.
 Employer matching contributions and employee after-tax contributions
must meet a nondiscrimination test called the Actual Contribution Percent-
age (ACP) test. This test is virtually identical to the ADP test except that 
it doesn’t measure employee deferrals; instead, it measures employer
matching contributions and/or employee after-tax contributions.
58
Part I: Focusing on Pension Fundamentals 
Keeping the pieces of the pie equal 
with nondiscrimination tests
A nondiscrimination test doesn’t test for dis-
crimination based on race, sex, or religion.
Instead, it looks for discrimination based on
compensation. For instance, in the field of pen-
sion law, a company can’t discriminate between
highly compensated employees (HCEs) and
non–highly compensated employees (NHCEs).
Antidiscrimination rules are intended to prevent
HCEs and owners from unfairly benefiting from
a 401(k) plan. A company can discriminate
between different groups of HCEs and between
different groups of NHCEs, but it can’t discrimi-
nate in favor of HCEs over NHCEs. Simply put, if
a company offers a benefit to HCEs, the same
benefit must be offered to NHCEs.
So who, exactly, qualifies as a HCE? In a nut-
shell, any employee who’s paid well for doing
his or her job is considered a HCE. The impor-
tant thing to remember is that whether you’re
highly compensated in any given year is based
on your compensation from the employer for the
prior year. For example, if you receive compen-
sation of $100,000 or more in 2007, you’re consid-
ered to be highly compensated in 2008. (The IRS
set this limit, similar to the other dollar limits it
sets, and the limit is adjusted yearly for inflation
to keep up with the cost of living.) Also, you’re
considered to be highly compensated if you own
5 or more percent of the company — even if your
compensation is less than $100,000. The spouse,
parents, and children of employees who own 5
percent are also considered to be HCEs.
If your plan provides that if more than 20 percent
of an employer’s employees are paid more than
$100,000, the employer may elect to limit the
HCEs to the top 20 percent of employees in
order of pay.

 No individual participant can make an elective contribution that’s greater
than the annual dollar limitation set by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
The dollar amount, which is the lesser of 100 percent of compensation or
$15,500 for 2007, plus a $5,000 catch-up if you’re over 50, is adjusted each
year for inflation. (Flip to Chapter 3 for more on these and other contribu-
tion limitations.)
This dollar limit is a yearly amount that applies to all employee contri-
butions, so if you work for more than one employer, you don’t get to
double it.
The features of the traditional 401(k)
A 401(k) is a powerful tool in helping to promote financial security in retire-
ment. And of all of the 401(k) plans, the traditional 401(k) offers the most flex-
ibility (we describe the others later in this chapter). In the following sections,
we explain some important features of the traditional plan.
Knowing how much you can contribute
The great thing about 401(k)s is that you can decide how much to defer into
a traditional 401(k) each year. Your contributions are made on a pretax basis
from your salary and are referred to as elective deferrals. Typically, you’re
permitted to change the level of your deferrals as often as your plan pro-
vides. Contact your human resources department or your plan administrator
to find out how to change the level of your deferral.
Even though you can decide how much salary to defer each year, do remem-
ber that you can’t go over the set dollar limit (set by the IRS). In 2007, for
instance, the dollar limit is $15,500, and it increases yearly in $500 increments
based on cost-of-living adjustments. Your elective deferrals are also limited to
100 percent of your compensation. So in other words, your maximum elective
deferral is the lesser of these two numbers: the yearly dollar limit or 100 per-
cent of your compensation. For example, if your compensation is $7,000 in
2007, you can contribute only up to $7,000. However, if your compensation in
2007 is $15,500 or more, you can contribute up to $15,500.
If you’re highly compensated, your employer must advise you of any limits
that may apply to you.
If you contribute (accidentally or otherwise) more than the maximum pretax
limit to your 401(k), the excess amount must be withdrawn by April 15 of the
following year. The excess contribution, in addition to the earnings on the
excess, is considered nonqualified and can’t remain in your 401(k). As a result
of this violation, you may have to pay taxes and penalties on the excess.

Chapter 4: Using 401(k) Plans to Your Advantage

Because employee contributions are discretionary, there’s no minimum
amount that you’re required to defer. However, if your employer offers to
match your contribution and you don’t contribute anything, there’s nothing
to match. It’s your loss. We always opt for deferring as much income as you
can and saving wisely for your retirement; if your employer offers a match,
contribute the most you can. Otherwise, you’re losing out on a great opportu-
nity for essentially free money.
Catching up at age 50
Imagine for a moment that you didn’t defer quite as much money into your
401(k) during your early years, and now that you’re 50, you’ve realized what
kind of shape you’ll be in during retirement. Sounds pretty scary, huh? The
truth is that most of us never defer quite as much as we like or save as much
as we hope. Well, as long as you’re over 50 (or turn 50 within the plan year,
which is any consecutive 12-month period of time under which the plan 
operates) and your plan permits it, you can make an additional elective con-
tribution, called a catch-up contribution, over and above the regular 401(k)
contribution limits that we discuss in the previous section. Catch-up contri-
butions are a little perk for older employees who have fewer years ahead of
them to sock money away for retirement.
The dollar limit for the catch-up contribution is $5,000 for 2007. (This limit
increases in $500 increments each year.) Therefore, the maximum elective
deferral for someone who’s 50 or older is $20,500 for 2007 (the regular
$15,500 elective deferral limit plus the $5,000 catch-up).
Even if your salary is below the $15,500 elective deferral limit, you can defer
100 percent of your compensation up to $15,500 plus an extra $5,000 as a
catch-up contribution. So if you’re 50 or older and earn only $7,000 in 2007,
you may defer an additional $5,000 for your catch-up contribution.
Keep in mind that your employer isn’t required to allow catch-up contribu-
tions, but there’s not much reason for it not to because your contribution
dollars are at work. In addition, even if your employer agrees to match your
elective deferrals, it doesn’t match a catch-up contribution. Check with your
plan administrator or your employer’s human resources department to find
out whether your plan permits catch-up contributions. Whatever the case
may be, it’s our recommendation that you maximize whatever contributions
you can because it’s the best investment you’ll ever make!
Making a match with your employer
Employers have a number of options in terms of how they choose to con-
tribute to their employees’ accounts. The most popular method of contribut-
ing to an employee’s plan is for your employer to match your contribution.
Two types of matches exist:
60
Part I: Focusing on Pension Fundamentals 

 Discretionary match: In this type of match, your employer may choose
to kick in money for every dollar that you contribute, usually within
limits set by the plan or by law. Your employer sets the formula depend-
ing on how much it wants to contribute, and it has the discretion to
choose make a contribution on a year-to-year basis.
 Mandatory match: In this type of match, the plan requires the employer
to make a matching contribution according to a certain formula. The
employer may choose to fully match contributions, dollar for dollar, or 
it can partially match contributions.
For example, your employer can offer a matching contribution of 50 per-
cent up to 6 percent of your pay. Very simply, this means that for every
dollar you contribute to your plan, up to a limit of 6 percent of your pay,
your employer contributes 50 cents. If your elective deferrals are 6 per-
cent of your compensation or greater, your employer will contribute an
amount equal to 3 percent of your compensation. In other words, if you
defer 7 percent of your compensation, your employer contributes only 3
percent.
Your employer’s contributions, plus your own contributions, can’t exceed the
yearly overall IRS limits; for 2007, the limit is the lesser of 100 percent of your
compensation or $45,000 (plus $5,000 for a catch-up contribution, for a total
of $50,000, if you’re at least 50).
For example, if you’re over 50 and earn more than $15,500 in 2007, you can
make the maximum employee contribution of $20,500 ($15,500 plus a $5,000
catch-up contribution). Because the overall IRS contribution is $50,000 for
someone who’s at least 50, your employer can contribute up to $29,500 (the
$50,000 maximum limit minus your $20,500 maximum deferral).
Determining when you’re vested
Vesting is a term that’s related to how much of your 401(k) is actually yours.
With 401(k) plans, your contributions are 100 percent vested at all times. For
example, if you defer money to your 401(k) and then decide to leave your job,
you’re entitled to 100 percent of the contributions that you’ve made to your
plan. (These contributions are also called nonforfeitable contributions.)
But you have to remember that the same isn’t true with your employer’s contri-
butions. These contributions vest over a number of years according to a vest-
ing schedule (this is your employer’s way of trying to get you to stay at your job
as long as possible). So, if your employer made contributions to your plan, but
you haven’t worked at the company long enough to be vested, you won’t be
able to take all the employer’s contributions when you leave the company.
61
Chapter 4: Using 401(k) Plans to Your Advantage

Although the money you’ve contributed is 100 percent vested, the value of
the principal may either grow or shrink depending on how it’s been invested
and what’s going on in the marketplace. So keep in mind that $1,000 deferred
doesn’t automatically equal $1,000 withdrawn! Find out more about invest-
ments in Chapter 6.
Effective January 1, 2007, employer contributions made to defined contribu-
tion plans, including 401(k) plans, must be vested no less rapidly than under
a three-year cliff schedule or a six-year graded vesting schedule, as shown in
Table 4-1. This is faster than in the past.

Checking out investment options
You can select a variety of investment options when dealing with your 401(k).
As an employee participating in the plan, either you’ll be permitted to direct
the investment of your accounts or a trustee selected by your employer will
manage the fund on your behalf. (Chapter 6 has more on investing.)
Your account balance determines the amount of retirement income you’ll
receive from the plan. While contributions to your account and the earnings
on your investments will increase your account balance, fees and expenses
paid by your plan will reduce the growth.
Helping yourself to a hardship distribution
Under certain circumstances, you may be allowed to access funds in your
401(k) plan before retirement, but you’ll be hit with a penalty. For example, if
you’re an active employee and find yourself undergoing financial hardship,
62
Part I: Focusing on Pension Fundamentals 

your plan may permit you to make a withdrawal from the principal portion 
of the funds that you contributed (you can’t access the earnings on your 
contributions). Your plan may also permit a hardship withdrawal from your
employer’s contributions to your account.
You can receive distributions on account of hardship only if they’re neces-
sary due to your “immediate and heavy” financial need. Also, the distribution
can’t be greater than the amount needed to satisfy the hardship, and you
must not have other resources to satisfy the hardship. The plan must set
forth uniform standards as to what constitutes a hardship.
You should know what constitutes a hardship and how to request such a dis-
tribution; this information is contained in the summary plan description. See
Chapter 8 to find out how to request this and other important plan docu-
ments from your plan administrator. The following situations automatically
constitute an immediate and heavy financial need:
 You have unreimbursed medical expenses from healthcare for you, your
spouse, or any of your dependents. (Unreimbursed medical expenses are
those that you’re responsible for and that aren’t reimbursed by insur-
ance.) Amounts for medical expenses may be obtained prior to actually
incurring the expense if the plan has a specific procedure to permit such
withdrawals.
 You’re purchasing a principal residence.
 You need to make payments to prevent eviction from your principal resi-
dence or to prevent foreclosure on your mortgage.
 You have expenses for the repair of damage to your principal residence
due to fire, storm, or other casualty.
 You need to make tuition payments for the next 12 months of post-
secondary education for you, your spouse, or your dependents.
 You have burial or funeral expenses.
Your employer must determine that you’ve exhausted all your financial
resources before you can get a hardship distribution. Your employer must
rely on your good word that you were unable to gain funds from the following
resources:
 Reimbursement or compensation by insurance
 The selling of your assets
 The elimination of your elective contributions under the plan
 A nontaxable loan distribution from any employer’s plan
 A loan from a commercial source like a bank
63
Chapter 4: Using 401(k) Plans to Your Advantage

Because your employer relies on your representation that you have no other
resources available to you, including the stoppage of your elective contribu-
tions to the plan, participants who take a hardship withdrawal from their
plan are prohibited from making elective deferrals for six months following
the hardship distribution.
The Pension Protection Act of 2006 allows hardship distributions to any des-
ignated beneficiary, not just a spouse or dependent. In other words, since
August 17, 2006, this category has been expanded to include anyone you des-
ignate as your beneficiary, such as a domestic partner of the same or oppo-
site sex or simply a significant other or extended family member.
Getting a loan from your 401(k)
Yes, some employers’ 401(k) plans permit loans, but as you may guess, a
number of limitations and restrictions apply. To be sure that your loan isn’t
treated as a taxable distribution (called a deemed distribution from your
plan), it must meet these requirements:
 You must repay the loan within five years.
 The loan repayment schedule must be made in substantially equal pay-
ments consisting of both principal and interest and in at least quarterly
installments.
 The loan must be evidenced by an agreement that sets forth the terms
of the loan (including the date of the loan, the specific amount of the
loan, and the repayment schedule).
Flip to Chapter 13, where we cover loans from pension plans in greater detail.
Checking Out Other Varieties 
of 401(k) Plans
You may not work for a large company that offers the option of a traditional
401(k), but don’t worry; it’s entirely possible that your employer offers one of
the alternative plans in the following sections. We also explain the plan that
you may use if you’re self-employed.
Finding Safe Harbor 401(k) plans
Any type of employer and any size company may choose a Safe Harbor 
plan, which is funded by mandatory employer contributions and optional
employee contributions. This plan is used most often by employers that
64
Part I: Focusing on Pension Fundamentals 

don’t mind having mandatory funding obligations and that can afford to make
the contributions.
A Safe Harbor 401(k) allows employees of all different salary levels to make
the maximum salary deferral contributions, just as in a traditional 401(k)
plan. (For 2007, this contribution is the lesser of 100 percent of your compen-
sation or $15,500, plus an additional $5,000 catch-up contribution if you’re 50
or older.) If you’ve worked 1,000 hours in the previous year and are at least
21 years old, you’re eligible to participate in this type of plan.
One difference regarding the Safe Harbor 401(k) plan is that it doesn’t require
the discrimination testing that the traditional 401(k) requires (see the earlier
section “The rules governing the traditional 401(k)” for more info). Employers
are excused from this requirement because they agree to make mandatory
matching contributions to their employees’ salary deferrals or direct contribu-
tions to the accounts of all eligible employees.
The mandatory match is 100 percent of the employee elective deferrals up to
the first 3 percent of employee compensation, plus 50 percent of the next 2
percent. For example, if you choose to defer 5 percent of your compensation,
your employer contributes a match of 4 percent of your compensation.
3%
(100% match of the first 3%)
+ 1% (50% match of the next 2%)
4%
match
Instead of making a matching contribution, your employer may choose to
contribute an amount equal to at least 3 percent of compensation (called an
employer nonelective contribution) on behalf of all eligible employees, regard-
less of whether those employees actually defer into the Safe Harbor plan.
Another difference between the Safe Harbor 401(k) and traditional 401(k) is
that all eligible employees are 100 percent vested immediately in their contri-
butions and in their employer’s contributions (the 3 percent employer non-
elective contribution or the mandatory match). If your employer also makes
a discretionary contribution to the plan (see the earlier section “Making a
match with your employer” for more about discretionary contributions), you
aren’t automatically vested in these contributions, which are subject to a
vesting schedule as for other 401(k)s.
Easing into SIMPLE 401(k) plans
An employer that employs no more than 100 employees earning at least
$5,000 in compensation and that doesn’t maintain another qualified plan may
adopt a SIMPLE (Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees) 401(k).
65
Chapter 4: Using 401(k) Plans to Your Advantage

Employees may elect to defer some of their compensation to a SIMPLE 401(k),
but they aren’t required to do so. The maximum annual elective deferral that
may be made is $10,500 in 2007 and indexed for inflation in $500 increments. In
addition, employees age 50 or older can make a maximum $2,500 catch-up con-
tribution, also adjusted yearly for inflation in $500 increments.
In SIMPLE 401(k) plans, your employer can make either a dollar-for-dollar
contribution matching your elective deferral up to 3 percent of your compen-
sation for the year or a nonelective contribution of 2 percent of compensa-
tion for each eligible employee who earned at least $5,000 in compensation
during the prior plan year. Your employer can’t make any other contribu-
tions. You’re 100 percent vested in both your contributions and employer
contributions at all times.
Like the Safe Harbor 401(k), the SIMPLE 401(k) doesn’t undergo nondiscrimi-
nation testing, and the plan may permit participant loans and hardship 
withdrawals.
The SIMPLE 401(k) is just that: a simpler version of the 401(k). The drawback
to you and other employees is that the maximum elective deferral is smaller
than with other 401(k)s, but the plan is easier for small employers to adminis-
ter because of the easy-to-calculate benefit formula.
Going it alone with solo 401(k) plans
The solo 401(k), which may also be called the individual 401(k) or uni (k),
is designed specifically to benefit owner-only small businesses, the self-
employed, and independent contractors. To be eligible for this type of plan,
the sole proprietor must have no additional employees other than a spouse
or a business partner.
If they’re two different people, a business partner and a spouse both can’t
participate in this type of 401(k). Only the owner and spouse (who’s receiving
income from the business) or the owner and a business partner are allowed
to participate.
A business that employs part-time employees may still be eligible to partici-
pate in a solo 401(k) if the employees are
 Under age 21
 Employees with less than one year of service
 W-2 employees who work less than 1,000 hours per year
 Certain union employees
 Certain nonresident alien employees with no U.S. income
66
Part I: Focusing on Pension Fundamentals 

The contribution limit for a solo 401(k) is $45,000 in 2007 (the same limit 
for all defined contribution plans) plus the $5,000 catch-up contribution for
those 50 and older. This limit makes it an ideal choice for the sole proprietor
or self-employed individual who wants to max out on contributions and has
only one other person’s account to fund (a spouse’s or business partner’s).
Loans are permitted from your solo 401(k), up to 50 percent of the total
401(k) value with a $50,000 limit. See Chapter 13 for more information on
loans from pension plans.
As far as funding is concerned, the solo 401(k) is completely discretionary
and the owner (that’s you) can change the contribution levels depending on
whether it has been a good year.
To set up a solo 401(k), you should contact an attorney knowledgeable in
retirement plan matters, especially one who has experience in the drafting of
assorted retirement plan documents and who can explain the ins and outs 
of various plans to determine what’s best for your particular circumstances.
(We explain how to find a pension attorney in Chapter 19.)
Paying taxes up front with 
Roth 401(k) plans
When you contribute to a traditional 401(k) or any of the other previously
described 401(k) plans, you get a tax deduction on the contribution. Thanks
to this deduction, money that would ordinarily be paid to the government
remains in the account, tax deferred, until it’s withdrawn.
From your point of view, you hope your account will grow and add to your
retirement. From the government’s point of view, it hopes that your account
will grow, too, because when you retire and withdraw the money, that’s when
your tax deferral ends. At that point, the government hopes that there’s lots
of money to tax. So, the government gives you a tax break today to get more
taxes from you in the future!
The Roth 401(k), however, works in reverse. The money that you earn today
is taxed today. When you start your withdrawals, you receive them tax-free.
Who wouldn’t love to receive tax-free money during retirement? Certainly
you would enjoy it, but the government likes the Roth system as well. The
government likes this system because it’s getting paid today instead of sev-
eral years down the road. Wimpy knew when he said, “I’ll gladly pay you next
Tuesday for a hamburger today,” that he was getting the better end of the
bargain.
67
Chapter 4: Using 401(k) Plans to Your Advantage

The Roth 401(k) plan is provided primarily by larger employers that can
absorb the additional administrative costs and complexities that the plan
presents. Unlike the Roth IRA, which has income limitations that restrict
some individuals from participating (check out Chapter 5 for more on the
Roth IRA), the Roth 401(k) has no such income limits.
A Roth 401(k) is never established as a completely separate plan. Rather, when
it’s offered, it’s as an option as part of a traditional 401(k). In this case, you
have the opportunity to contribute some or all of your elective deferrals to a
Roth 401(k), a traditional 401(k), or a combination of the two. Just remember
that if you choose to contribute to both, you don’t get to contribute twice as
much money — contribution limits remain the same regardless of whether you
choose a traditional 401(k), a Roth 401(k), or both. The contribution limit for
2007 is $15,500 for people under age 50 and $20,500 when you add in the $5,000
catch-up contribution for those 50 and older. Employer contributions are iden-
tical for both traditional and Roth 401(k) plans.
The Roth tax treatment applies only to the employee’s elective deferrals.
Employer matching contributions or employer nonelective contributions con-
tinue to be treated as tax-deferred contributions and are taxable to you, the
employee, when distributed from the plan.
As in a traditional 401(k), any deferrals that exceed the maximum limits must
be removed no later than April 15 of the year following the year of the desig-
nated Roth contribution. Unlike the case with a traditional 401(k), however, if
the excess deferrals aren’t distributed by April 15, the contribution will be
taxed both in the year of contribution and the year of distribution (in other
words, it’s subject to double taxation). Earnings attributable to the excess
Roth deferral are taxed only in the year of distribution.
For the most part, distributions are subject to the same restrictions as tradi-
tional 401(k)s, but some differences do exist. The big one: Earnings are tax-
free only if the employee is age 591⁄2 or is disabled or deceased and the first
Roth 401(k) contribution was deposited five or more tax years ago. If the plan
allows rollovers (see Chapter 9 for rollover basics), the date to follow is the
date that the first Roth 401(k) contribution was made to the prior plan. The
plan administrator is responsible for tracking the five years and the basis on
the contributions to determine the tax that may be due upon distribution.
The five-year period is based on tax years, not the elapsed time from the first
contribution. (A tax year is the year for which the contribution was made.)
For example, if your first Roth deferral is on December 15, 2008, the first year
of the five-year period is 2008. However, if the initial Roth deferral is on
January 5, 2009, 2009 would be the first year of the five-year period.

Increasing Your Income 
with IRAs

I
ndividual retirement accounts, or IRAs, are different from the defined bene-
fit and defined contribution plans we discuss in Chapter 3 and from the
401(k) plans (a popular type of defined contribution plan) we discuss in
Chapter 4. Unlike 401(k)s and other plans established by employers to fund
retirement benefits for their employees, IRAs are tax-deferred personal retire-
ment plans set up by individuals to help fund their own retirement benefits.
In 1974, the U.S. Congress first authorized IRAs. By authorizing these new
plans, Congress hoped to give Americans a tax break on their hard-earned
income and hoped that the IRA would be an incentive for people to save
(saving is much more fun when you don’t first have to pay taxes on it!). 
At just about the same time as IRAs were born, some companies decided 
that they would no longer provide pensions or retirement benefits to their
employees. The IRA then became a great tool for employees to control their
own retirement funding.
So if your employer doesn’t offer a pension plan, you may find that an IRA is
right for you. It’s also a great option when you receive a distribution from an
employer’s retirement plan; you can set up either a traditional IRA or a Roth
IRA to hold and invest your retirement plan distributions. Other IRAs out
there, such as SIMPLE IRAs and Simplified Employee Pensions (SEPs), are
offered only by employers. We cover all the bases in this chapter.

You can set up IRAs or get information on IRAs from many investment firms.
For example, www.schwab.com and www.vanguard.com are two sites that
contain information on IRAs. These sites also can assist you in setting up 
an IRA.
The Fundamentals of Traditional IRAs
The traditional IRA is the basis for all other types of IRAs. In the following sec-
tions, we explain the fundamentals of traditional IRAs, including eligibility,
contributions, rollovers, investments, and distributions. (For a detailed look
at both rollovers and distributions of IRAs and tax-qualified plans, head to
Chapter 9.)
Beginning with the basic rules
Generally speaking, an IRA is a trust or custodial account (established with a
financial or investment institution) set up for the exclusive benefit of you or
your beneficiaries (like your spouse, domestic partner, and children). The
account, which can be set up at any time, is created by a written document
called a trust agreement or a custodial agreement. The agreement must state
the following rules:
 The trustee or custodian must be a bank, a federally insured credit
union, a savings and loan association, or an entity approved by the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to act as trustee or custodian.
 The trustee or custodian generally can’t accept contributions that
exceed the maximum dollar limit effective for a taxable year.
 Contributions, except for rollover contributions, must be in cash.
 You must have a nonforfeitable right to the assets of the IRA at all times.
 Money in your account can’t be used to buy a life insurance policy.
 Assets in your account can’t be combined with other property, except in
a common trust fund or common investment fund.
 You must start receiving distributions by April 1 of the year following
the year in which you reach age 701⁄2.
Although IRAs are among the easiest types of retirement accounts to estab-
lish and maintain, they still can be somewhat confusing, so talk to a financial
professional to set one up.
70
Part I: Focusing on Pension Fundamentals 

Determining your eligibility
Unfortunately, not everyone is eligible to set up a traditional IRA. So before
you proceed, you must determine your eligibility. You know that you can set
up and make contributions to a traditional IRA if you meet the following
requirements:
 You (or, if you file a joint return, your spouse) received taxable compen-
sation during the year. According to the IRS, compensation is what you
earn from working, including the following:
• Wages
• Salaries
• Tips
• Professional fees
• Bonuses
• Self-employment income
• Commissions
• Taxable alimony and separate maintenance payments that you
receive from your divorce decree or a separate maintenance order
for support
For the purpose of determining eligibility, the IRS treats as compensa-
tion any amount properly shown on your W-2 in Box 1.
 You didn’t become 701⁄2 years of age by the end of the year. (No minimum
age exists for setting up an IRA. You can set up IRAs for your kids if
they’ve earned income.)
In most cases, you can have a traditional IRA whether or not you’re covered
by any other retirement plan. However, if your modified adjusted gross income
(MAGI) is above a certain dollar amount, you may not be able to deduct all or
any of the contributions to your IRA if you (or your spouse) are covered by
an employer retirement plan. (We cover MAGI and deductible contributions
to IRAs in the later section “Types of contributions.”)
If both you and your spouse have compensation and are under the age of 701⁄2,
you have to set up separate IRAs. In other words, you can’t both participate
in the same IRA. The later sidebar “Double your pleasure: Contribution limits
when both you and your spouse have IRAs” has the nitty-gritty on the math
behind contributing to separate IRAs.
71
Chapter 5: Increasing Your Income with IRAs

Contributing to a traditional IRA
Several issues come into play when you begin talking about your IRA contri-
butions, including what types of contributions you can make, what the limits
are, whether catch-up contributions are permitted, and, of course, when you
can actually make contributions. We explain what you need to know in the
following sections.
No matter what, you can’t contribute any money to your traditional IRA after
you reach age 701⁄2.
Types of contributions
IRA contributions only come in the following two flavors:
 Deductible contributions: These can be deducted for tax purposes.
 Nondeductible contributions: These can’t be deducted. (Easy, huh?)
If you’re covered by an employer retirement plan, you can deduct the full
amount you contribute to your traditional IRA as long as your modified adjusted
gross income (MAGI) is, for 2007, $50,000 or less (or $80,000 or less if you’re
married and filing jointly).
If your MAGI is more than $50,000 and less than $60,000 (if you’re filing as a
single individual or head of household) or more than $80,000 and less than
$100,000 (if you’re married, filing jointly, or a qualifying widow/widower),
you’re still in luck. In this case, you can generally deduct a proportional part
of your contributions to your traditional IRA. But if your income is above
these limits, sorry, you can’t make a deductible contribution to your tradi-
tional IRA. However, you’re still free to make a nondeductible contribution.
You should be aware that the compensation limits restrict your ability to
make a deductible contribution to an IRA only if you’re an active participant
receiving contributions in an employer retirement plan.
Contribution limits
Like most retirement plans, IRAs are subject to contribution limits (the IRS
can’t possibly let you have too much of a good thing!). The most that can be
contributed to your traditional IRA is the lesser of the following:
 Your taxable compensation for the year
 $4,000, which is the limit for 2007
72
Part I: Focusing on Pension Fundamentals 

For example, if you’re 34 years old and single and you earn $25,000 in 2007,
your IRA contributions for 2007 are limited to $4,000, which is the set maxi-
mum for that year. On the other hand, if you’re a single college student who’s
working only part time and earning $3,500 in 2007, the maximum amount you
can contribute to your IRA is $3,500, which is limited to the total amount of
your compensation. Table 5-1 sets out the contribution limits for 2007 and
beyond.
Table 5-1
Maximum Dollar Amounts for IRA Contributions
For Taxable Years Beginning
Maximum Contribution Amount
2005–2007
$4,000
2008 and after
$5,000
The previously mentioned limits are the most that can be contributed regard-
less of whether the contributions are to one or more traditional or Roth IRAs
(we discuss Roth IRAs later in this chapter). In other words, if you have more
than one IRA, the limit applies to the total contributions made on your behalf
to all your traditional or Roth IRAs for that year. If you make more than the
allowed contributions, they’ll be subject to a 6 percent excise tax until they’re
corrected — either distributed from the plan or used toward a contribution
in a subsequent year.
The maximum contribution limit will increase yearly due to inflation starting
in 2009. However, the IRS will make adjustments only if the cost of living
increases by $500 or more. If the increase meets that requirement, the adjust-
ments will be made in multiples of $500, rounded down. For example, if the
increase in the cost of living is $499, no adjustment will be made. And if
there’s an increase of $999, this will create an adjustment of $500.
See the nearby sidebar “Double your pleasure: Contribution limits when both
you and your spouse have IRAs” for the math details on contributing to IRAs
when you’re married.
Catch-up contributions
Traditional IRAs, like 401(k)s and other retirement plans, allow catch-up con-
tributions for people who are 50 or older. If you meet this age requirement,
you can contribute an additional $1,000 annually to your IRA. These contribu-
tions apply on top of the maximum contribution limits. This means that if
you’re over 50 years old, you can make a total IRA contribution of $5,000 for
2007 (which consists of the $4,000 maximum limit plus the $1,000 catch-up).
73
Chapter 5: Increasing Your Income with IRAs

The timing of contributions
As we mention in the section “Beginning with the basic rules” earlier in this
chapter, all contributions (except for rollovers) must be in cash. Here’s when
you can make those cash contributions:
 Yearly: In this scenario, you write a check (money orders or cash both
work, too) once a year to your IRA for the maximum contribution or for
whatever amount you elect to contribute that year.
 Many times throughout the year: With this contribution method, you
make small contributions to your IRA throughout the year.
74
Part I: Focusing on Pension Fundamentals 
Double your pleasure: Contribution limits when
both you and your spouse have IRAs
If you and your spouse file a joint return and
your taxable compensation is less than that of
your spouse (even if your compensation is $0),
the most that can be contributed for the year to
your individual IRA is the smaller of the follow-
ing two amounts:
 $4,000 for 2007 ($5,000 if you’re age 50 or
older).
 The total compensation that can be included
in the gross income of both you and your
spouse for the year. However, that total must
be reduced by the following two amounts:
your spouse’s IRA contribution for the year
to a traditional IRA and your spouse’s contri-
butions for the year to a Roth IRA (we dis-
cuss Roth IRAs later in this chapter).
What this means to you is that the total com-
bined contributions that can be made for the
year 2007 to your IRA and your spouse’s IRA can
be as much as $8,000 ($9,000 if only one of you is
50 or older or $10,000 if both of you are 50 or
older) — even if one of you doesn’t make much.
Consider, for example, the scenario of Tarzan
and Jane. Jane, a full-time student in her 20s,
with no income during the year, marries Tarzan,
an older guy in his 30s who works at the local
zoo. By working at the zoo, Tarzan has taxable
compensation of $40,000. (Hard to believe
Tarzan found such a good job!) He’s a saver and
wants to contribute $4,000 to a traditional IRA.
If he and Jane file a joint tax return, each of
them can contribute $4,000 to separate tradi-
tional IRAs. The couple can do this even though
Jane has no compensation because Tarzan’s
compensation can be added to her zero com-
pensation (after reducing Tarzan’s compensa-
tion by his $4,000 contribution).
Look at it this way:
$40,000 (Tarzan’s compensation) + $0 (Jane’s
compensation) = $40,000
$40,000 – $4,000 (Tarzan’s contribution to his
own IRA) = $36,000
The amount of $4,000 is less than $36,000 (which
is Jane’s “compensation” for the purposes of
calculating her contribution limit), so Jane can
contribute $4,000 to her own IRA (the maximum
yearly limit).

You must make your contributions by April 15 of the year following a particu-
lar tax year. For example, you can wait until April 15, 2008, to make IRA con-
tributions for the 2007 tax year. However, make sure that your IRA statement
properly credits your contribution to the taxable year 2007 rather than 2008.
Picking your investments
An IRA isn’t an investment itself, but rather it’s an account into which you
contribute your money. You have the option to invest your contribution in
stocks, bonds, CDs, mutual funds, and other securities and investments,
including real estate. Read Chapter 6 for more on different types of 
investments.
Because your money grows tax-deferred in a traditional IRA, don’t invest in
something that grows tax-free in a regular account, such as a municipal bond.
Instead, choose investments that would be taxed if they were in a regular
account, such as a stock mutual fund or a CD.
IRA funds aren’t permitted to be invested in collectibles. If you do invest in
these items, the amount you invest is considered distributed in the year
invested, which means that you may have to pay an additional 10 percent tax
on these early distributions (find out more about distributions later in this
chapter). Collectibles include (among others) the following:
 Artwork
 Rugs
 Antiques
 Metals (except for certain kinds of bullion)
 Gems
 Stamps
 Coins (except certain coins minted by the U.S. Treasury Department)
 Alcoholic beverages
 Certain other tangible personal property
If you decide to go with a brokerage firm when you set up your IRA, you may
be restricted to choosing investments from that firm’s products, which may
include fees for the services they provide. Make sure that you get all the nec-
essary information regarding the investment of your IRA assets ahead of
time, including service charge fees, so that you can make educated decisions
and not be surprised down the road.
75
Chapter 5: Increasing Your Income with IRAs

Rolling over to a traditional IRA
A rollover is when you move your money from one tax-deferred place to
another without paying taxes. But to roll over successfully, your distribution
must be eligible for direct transfer, thereby avoiding tax consequences. Rules
also exist for who can roll over money into an IRA and when. For full details
on rollovers to IRAs (and to tax-qualified pension plans), see Chapter 9.
Taking your distribution
After you reach the magical age of 591⁄2, you can start withdrawing money
from your IRA without penalty (whether or not you’ve actually retired). Upon
withdrawal, your earnings will be subject to income tax (but remember that
these earnings have been growing tax-deferred for as long as you have been
saving!). Then, the April 1 after you reach the age of 701⁄2, you’re required to
start taking a minimum withdrawal each year. If you fail to take distributions
by that date, you’ll be taxed at a 50 percent rate on the amount that should
have been withdrawn.
So after you hit 701⁄2, you have to calculate your minimum required distribution
for a given tax year. To do so, divide the value of your account at the end of 
the previous year by the number of years in the Uniform Distribution Table in
Appendix B (this table shows life expectancy factors based on the age of a pen-
sioner). The table is based on a participant with a beneficiary 10 years younger
than the participant. However, your IRA distributions are based on the Uniform
Distribution Table even if your beneficiary isn’t 10 years younger than you.
For example, imagine that you’re 72 and your traditional IRA account is worth
$100,000 on December 31, 2007. The minimum distribution period at age 72 is
25.6 years (based on the Uniform Distribution Table). That means you need
to withdraw a minimum of $3,907 from your traditional IRA account in 2008.
($100,000 divided by the 25.6-year life expectancy equals $3,906.25; then you
round up to the higher dollar figure.) Your minimum withdrawal will change
every year based on the change in your account balance and in the life
expectancy in the Uniform Distribution Table.
Any withdrawals taken prior to reaching age 591⁄2 may not only be subject to
income taxes (as all withdrawals are), but they may also be subject to a 10
percent penalty imposed by the IRS for early withdrawal. As with most rules,
however, some exceptions apply to the early withdrawal rule. Here are the
situations when an exception applies:
 You have unreimbursed medical expenses that are more than 7.5 per-
cent of your adjusted gross income.
 The distributions are used to pay deductible medical expenses.
76
Part I: Focusing on Pension Fundamentals 

 You’re disabled.
 You’re the beneficiary of a deceased IRA owner.
 You’re receiving distributions in the form of an annuity payment spread
out over your life expectancy or the life expectancy of you and your 
beneficiary.
 The distributions are to be used for college expenses for yourself, your
spouse, your child, or your grandchild.
 You use the distributions to buy, build, or rebuild a first home (limited to
a lifetime limitation of $10,000).
For additional details on pension distributions, see Chapter 9.
You can’t borrow funds from your IRA or use your IRA as security for a loan.
If you do use your IRA for these purposes, all the funds in the IRA (not just
the loan amount) will be considered distributed (and therefore taxable).
Additionally, you can’t use an IRA to invest in a business you own or to buy
property from yourself.
The Nuts ’n’ Bolts of Roth IRAs
A Roth IRA, for the most part, is subject to the rules that apply to a traditional
IRA (which we cover earlier in this chapter). However, a Roth IRA has a few of
its own unique characteristics, which we explain in the following sections.
The Roth IRA is named for its chief legislative sponsor, the late U.S. Senator
William V. Roth, Jr. Roth IRAs became effective in 1998.
In order for the Roth IRA rules to apply, the account must be designated as a
Roth IRA when it’s set up. If the account isn’t initially set up as a Roth IRA, it
won’t receive Roth IRA treatment, so make sure that the application form
clearly indicates what you want. Roth IRAs are set up with the same institu-
tions and in the same manner as traditional IRAs (see the earlier section
“Beginning with the basic rules” for more information).
Eligibility requirements
In order to participate in a Roth IRA, you must meet the following 
requirements:
 You must be 18 years of age or older.
 You must have a MAGI of less than $110,000 (single) or $160,000 (mar-
ried and filing jointly). We discuss MAGI in the earlier section “Types of
contributions.”
77
Chapter 5: Increasing Your Income with IRAs

And remember that individuals with 401(k)s or other retirement plans are eli-
gible to participate in Roth IRAs.
Contribution rules
Unlike with a traditional IRA, you can’t deduct contributions to a Roth IRA 
for tax purposes. Rather than deducting a contribution up front, as with a
deductible traditional IRA, the tax benefits are backloaded (meaning that the
funds are distributed tax-free). Qualified distributions from Roth IRAs are
completely tax-free. So unlike deductible IRAs and tax-qualified plans that
provide tax deferral, Roth IRAs provide true tax-free buildup of investment
earnings. In addition, you can make contributions after you reach age 701⁄2,
and you can leave amounts in your Roth IRA as long as you live.
The contribution limits for a Roth IRA are the same as the limits for tradi-
tional IRAs and are limited to the lesser of $4,000 per year (not including
rollovers) or 100 percent of your compensation. Limits will remain at this
number until 2008 when they increase to $5,000.
The amount of your contribution depends on your income and on how you
file your tax return:
 Single filers: If you’re a single filer who earns up to a MAGI of $95,000,
you qualify for a full contribution. To qualify for a partial contribution,
you must earn $95,000–$110,000.
 Joint filers: If you and your spouse earn up to a combined MAGI of
$150,000, you qualify for a full contribution. To be eligible for a partial
contribution, together you must earn $150,000–$160,000.
Individuals can’t contribute if they exceed these income limitations. In fact,
excess contributions to a Roth IRA are subject to a 6 percent excise tax, and
these contributions are assessed annually until the excess is corrected.
With Roth IRAs, catch-up contributions are permitted for individuals who are
50 or older — just as they’re permitted with traditional IRAs. So if you’re 50
years old or older, you can contribute $5,000 per year for 2007 and $6,000 per
year in 2008. In the end, you’re allowed to contribute an extra $1,000 to catch
you up to where you want to be.
Contributions to a SEP or a SIMPLE IRA aren’t taken into account for pur-
poses of the IRA contribution limit ($4,000 in 2007 and $5,000 in 2008). In
other words, contributions to a SEP or SIMPLE IRA don’t affect the amount
that an individual can contribute to a Roth IRA. However, your contributions
to a traditional IRA do count toward the limit. We cover SIMPLE IRAs and
SEPs later in this chapter.
78
Part I: Focusing on Pension Fundamentals 

Conversions to a Roth IRA
Before 2008, you can’t roll over money from a tax-qualified plan directly into a
Roth IRA, but you can roll it into a traditional IRA. (Chapter 9 has all the info
you need on rollovers.) An existing traditional IRA then can be rolled over or
converted (we use these terms interchangeably) to a Roth IRA by a taxpayer
who has a gross income of less than $100,000 (not counting the conversion
amount) for the taxable year of the rollover. Conversions to Roth IRAs aren’t
available to married individuals filing separate returns.
The funds that you roll over from a traditional IRA into a Roth IRA are taxable
in the year of the rollover. For example, if you roll over $50,000 from a tradi-
tional IRA into a Roth IRA in 2009, you have to pay tax on the $50,000 in 2009.
Even though a conversion to a Roth IRA causes you to pay current taxes on
the amount rolled over, the amount will then grow tax-free in the Roth IRA.
Roth IRA rollovers work best if you have funds outside the IRA to use to pay
taxes on the rollover. For example, a rollover of $50,000 into a Roth IRA may
result in $10,000 in income taxes. It’s best to roll over the entire $50,000 and
pay the taxes with $10,000 that you have outside your IRA. If you need to take
$10,000 from your traditional IRA to pay the taxes, you wind up with only
$40,000 left to roll over into the Roth IRA.
A traditional IRA can be converted to a Roth IRA in one of three ways:
 Rollover: Assets from a traditional IRA can be contributed (rolled over)
to a Roth IRA within 60 days after their distribution.
 Trustee-to-trustee transfer: The financial institution holding the tradi-
tional IRA assets provides directions on how to transfer those assets to
the trustee of a Roth IRA with another financial institution.
 Same trustee transfer: The financial institution holding the traditional
IRA assets transfers those assets to a Roth IRA. In this case, the transfer
should be simpler because it occurs within the same financial institution.
Here are a few upcoming changes for conversions:
 Effective after December 31, 2007, direct rollovers from the tax-qualified
retirement plans we discuss in Chapter 3 to Roth IRAs will be permitted.
These rollovers are subject to the same rules that apply to conversions
from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA.
 Effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2009, the require-
ment that a taxpayer’s gross income not exceed $100,000 to be eligible
to convert a non-Roth IRA to a Roth IRA will be eliminated.
79
Chapter 5: Increasing Your Income with IRAs

 A special rule has been established for rollovers to Roth IRAs in 2010.
Amounts rolled over into a Roth IRA in 2010 aren’t included in your
income in 2010; instead, 50 percent of the amount is included in your
income in 2011 and 50 percent in 2012. That’s quite a deal for the year
2010 because none of the rollover will be included in your income. This
deal is something you should seriously consider.
Distribution details
Qualified (or tax-free) distributions from a Roth IRA aren’t included in your
gross income and aren’t subject to the 10 percent tax on early withdrawals.
But to be considered qualified, distributions must satisfy a five-year holding
period and must meet one of four criteria.
What’s a five-year holding period, you ask? It’s the period that begins with the
first taxable year in which you (or your spouse) made a contribution to a
Roth IRA. In the case of a rollover or conversion, the five-year period begins
with the taxable year in which the conversion was made or, if earlier, the tax-
able year in which a prior contribution was made to your Roth IRA. In other
words, the Roth IRA must have been in existence for at least five years prior
to your distribution. For example, if the Roth IRA is set up on April 5, 2007, for
the 2006 tax year, the initial year of the five-year period is 2006, and the five-
year period will be satisfied in 2010.
Distributions that have satisfied the five-year holding period will be qualified
if the distribution meets one of the four criteria:
 It was made on or after the date on which you become age 591⁄2.
 It was made to a beneficiary (or to your estate) upon or after your
death.
 It’s attributable to your disability.
 It’s a distribution made for qualified first-time home buyer expenses (up
to $10,000 over the taxpayer’s lifetime).
Any distributions from a Roth IRA that don’t meet the requirements to be a
qualified distribution aren’t taxable until they exceed the total amount of
your contributions to the Roth IRA. Because you’ve already paid taxes on the
amount of your original contribution, you don’t pay taxes twice, whether or
not the distribution is qualified. However, nonqualified distributions that are
over and above the amount of your original contributions (in other words,
the earnings on your contributions) are treated as taxable income.

Part I: Focusing on Pension Fundamentals 

The Simplicity of the SIMPLE IRA
A SIMPLE IRA is a Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees. This type of
plan applies to small companies (100 or fewer employees) that don’t offer 
a 401(k) or other type of retirement plan. Under a SIMPLE IRA plan, your
employer makes contributions to a traditional IRA that’s set up for each of its
eligible employees (we discuss traditional IRAs earlier in this chapter). You
can choose to make tax-deferred contributions to the SIMPLE IRA through
convenient payroll deductions. Sounds easy, doesn’t it? It is!
SIMPLE IRAs must satisfy certain requirements that include the following:
 The company must have 100 or fewer employees who received $5,000 or
more in compensation during the previous year.
 The SIMPLE IRA must be the only retirement plan that the employer pro-
vides. However, employers that maintain a qualified plan for collective
bargaining employees may maintain a SIMPLE IRA plan for their other
employees.
 An eligible employee is one who has earned at least $5,000 per year in
any two prior years and who’s expected to earn at least $5,000 this year.
 The contribution limit is the lesser of your compensation or $10,500 for
2007. An additional catch-up contribution of $2,500 is allowed for
employees who are 50 or older at the end of the calendar year.
 Employers must deposit employee deferrals as soon as possible (but no
later than 30 days following the month in which the employee would
otherwise have received the money).
 Employers must satisfy one of the following two contribution formulas:
• They must match 100 percent of employee elective deferrals up to
3 percent of compensation.
• They must make a nonelective contribution of 2 percent of com-
pensation for each eligible employee (regardless of whether the
employee defers compensation into the plan).
 Employers must deposit matching or nonelective contributions into the
plan before the due date, including extensions, of their tax returns.
 Employers must allow their participating employees to stop making
deferrals at any time.
 Each employee must always be 100 percent vested in (have ownership
of) all the money in his or her SIMPLE IRA (both employee and employer
contributions). See Chapter 7 for more about vesting.
81
Chapter 5: Increasing Your Income with IRAs

After contributions are made to your SIMPLE IRA account, you’re free to roll
over the funds to another IRA or to withdraw the funds and pay tax on the
distributions at any time. Contributions to a SIMPLE IRA don’t affect your
deductible contributions to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA.
The distribution rules for the SIMPLE IRA differ in one significant way from
those for the traditional IRA and the Roth IRA: If you take a distribution from
a SIMPLE IRA in the first two years, it’s subject to a 25 percent additional tax.
The Skinny on the Simplified Employee
Pension Plan (SEP)
An alternative variety of IRA is known as the Simplified Employee Pension
Plan, or SEP. SEPs provide a significant source of income at retirement
because employers are allowed to contribute directly to traditional IRA
accounts set up for their employees. It’s up to the employer, year to year,
whether it chooses to contribute that year. After the money goes into the
account, it becomes your money.
Who’s eligible?
Small businesses with a handful of workers typically establish a SEP. In this
instance, the owner and the workers of the business count as employees for
the purposes of the SEP. In addition, a self-employed worker can set up a SEP;
the employer and the employee, naturally, are the same person.
The employer must contribute to the SEP on behalf of each eligible employee
who meets the following requirements:
 Is 21 years old
 Has performed service for the employer for at least three out of the last
five years
 Performed service for the employer during the year that the contribu-
tion was made and received at least $450 (adjusted for cost-of-living
expenses) in compensation for such year (regardless of whether the
employee is still employed at the end of that year)
All eligible employees must participate in the SEP, including part-time
employees, seasonal employees, and employees who die or terminate
employment during the year.
82
Part I: Focusing on Pension Fundamentals 

How much can your employer contribute?
The amount that your employer is allowed to contribute is limited to the
lesser of $45,000 (for 2007, subject to cost-of-living adjustments) or 25 per-
cent of each employee’s compensation. But remember that no minimum 
funding standards are imposed for a SEP, and your employer isn’t locked into
making contributions every year. In fact, the employer decides each year
whether, and how much, to contribute to its employees’ SEPs.
All amounts contributed to your SEP belong to you. In other words, you’re
100 percent vested from the very beginning (see Chapter 7 for more details
on vesting).
How can you handle distributions 
and rollovers?
The rules for taking a distribution from a SEP are the same as those for tradi-
tional IRAs (we cover the basics of these distribution rules earlier in this
chapter). Money from a SEP can be rolled over tax-free to another SEP, to a
traditional IRA, or to another employer’s qualified retirement plan (provided
that the other plan allows rollovers).
Money withdrawn from a SEP and not rolled over to another plan is taxable. If
you withdraw money from a SEP before age 591⁄2, you may also be subject to
an additional 10 percent tax on the early withdrawal.

Chapter 6
Monitoring the Investments 
in Your Pension
In This Chapter
 Discovering and understanding investment information provided by your plan
 Watching closely when pension investment choices belong to others
 Tracking your own investment choices
S
o you know that your pension grows into a nice nest egg as you work
toward retirement. You also know that the money in your plan comes
from either your contributions or your employer’s. How all the money in your
plan accumulates for your retirement may be less obvious. Your plan, after
all, is made up of various investments that (hopefully) grow more and more
profitable over your working life, just in time for you to retire comfortably. To
ensure that this is the case, this chapter provides you with the basics about
the investment process and how to stay informed. Knowledge is protection,
and in order to properly monitor your investments you need to understand
the financial implications of self-directed versus plan-directed investments.
From the day you’re hired to the day you expire, and as soon as you begin to
participate in your pension plan, your goal should be to remain focused on
the investments in your plan, whether the plan selects them or whether
you’re in charge:
 If you’re in a defined benefit plan, investment decisions are out of
your control. This lack of control doesn’t mean, though, that you
shouldn’t stay informed as to how your plan is performing and how well
your advisors are doing their jobs.
 It’s critical to monitor those investments that you choose in a self-
directed plan (most defined contribution plans are self-directed).
Sometimes you have to make certain financial decisions that can dra-
matically affect your retirement nest egg.

In this chapter, we go over both types of plans: those with investments 
that are made by the plan and those that allow you to select your own 
investments.
The Form 5500 filed by your plan with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) con-
tains financial information, including investment information. Get in the habit
of reviewing your plan’s form and the schedules attached to it every year
after the new one is filed. Because the Form 5500 contains a wealth of infor-
mation on the company’s pension plan, the plan is required to provide you
with a copy if you ask for it. Request a copy in writing from your plan admin-
istrator (see Chapter 8 for details on obtaining plan information). You can
also review your employer’s Form 5500 online at www.freeerisa.com. If
you want to check out a blank Form 5500 and its various schedules, you can
do so at the IRS’s Web site (www.irs.gov/formspubs); just search by form
and instruction number, and then you can easily follow our discussion
throughout this chapter.
Staying Alert When Others Decide 
Your Pension’s Investments
If you’re part of a defined benefit plan, you can expect plan officials and
money managers to always make your investment decisions to ensure that
the earnings on those investments are sufficient to pay your plan’s promised
benefits. In defined contribution plans, some plans make the investment deci-
sions for you while others permit you to choose the investments. In a SEP or
SIMPLE IRA, you always direct the investments. But remember, you aren’t
permitted to self-direct the investments unless your plan documents specifi-
cally grant you this right. More on all this later in the chapter.
In a defined benefit plan, no individual account exists for each plan partici-
pant. Instead, the pool of money is maintained and managed for the benefit of
all participants. Because no separate account exists just for you, you and the
other pensioners have no opportunity to make investment decisions.
If you’re feeling a bit out of control with all this information, don’t worry. In
the following sections, we show you how to find out who’s investing your
pension’s money and how they’re doing so. We also explain how to check
your investments’ performance, recognize some warning signs of broken
rules, and take action against the plan if necessary.
86
Part I: Focusing on Pension Fundamentals 

Checking out who’s investing your money
In typical defined benefit plans, and even in some defined contribution plans,
you have no say as to where your plan’s funds are being invested. Instead,
these decisions are made by plan trustees, investment managers, or the plan
administrator. As you can imagine, then, it’s important for you to know
exactly who’s managing the plan’s money and making these decisions on
your behalf.
Why do you need to know this stuff? Because if your employer’s Uncle
Frederick, whose company Cleenumout and Gotcha has 17 complaints
against it for unethical practices, is managing your pension money, you have
reason to be worried that there may be a problem in the long run. If you’re
concerned that the plan’s money managers are more interested in lining their
pockets than yours (as would be the case if Uncle Frederick’s company is
involved), you can make a complaint to the Department of Labor (DOL), as
we explain later in this chapter.
To find out the identities of those who administer and provide services to the
plan, you need to review the plan’s Form 5500 and the schedules that are
attached to the form. In the following list, we explain what to look for on the
form and schedules to find out who’s managing your plan’s money:
 The plan administrator’s name and address can be found on the second
page of the plan’s Form 5500. The plan administrator may be responsible
for investing the funds, but that isn’t always the case. It’s also possible
that the plan administrator may be a committee or board of trustees
rather than a single person.
 If someone other than the plan administrator invests the money, such as
an entity outside the plan (for example, a bank, an investment manage-
ment firm, or an insurance company), look at Schedule C of the plan’s
Form 5500 to find out the names of those who provided services to the
plan.
 The funds from your pension plan may be thrown into a pot and pooled
with other pension plan money. These pooled funds may be maintained
and invested by an insurance company or bank. Unfortunately, detailed
financial information about pooled money isn’t included in the Form
5500. This important information is instead filed by the bank or insur-
ance company with the DOL and is available from the DOL upon request.
The forms filed with the DOL identify all pooled asset funds that your
plan participates in, including the names of the companies involved in
the pooling of assets. This information should also be on file with your
plan administrator. We provide the DOL contact information in the sec-
tion “Taking action if you have concerns” later in this chapter.

Chapter 6: Monitoring the Investments in Your Pension

Many insurance companies receive incredibly high fees to manage your pen-
sion money, and part of the problem is that you may be paying fees for items
that aren’t readily apparent, such as recordkeeping, audits, workshops, legal
advice, custodial fees, and revenue sharing. In fact, fees are one of the biggest
differences between a bank and an insurance company’s management of your
money.
If your pension money is being managed by an insurance company or through
an annuity contract, you need to look at Schedule A, which is attached to Form
5500. Schedule A provides specific information concerning insurance contract
coverage, fees, and commissions, including the amount of the commissions
and fees paid and the purpose for the fees. It also includes investment and
annuity contract information. If you can’t determine what the fees are for or
don’t understand the form, ask a professional to help you decipher it.
Surveying your plan’s selected investments
Depending on the size of your plan — whether it has more than or fewer than
100 employees — you must head to different Form 5500 schedules to dis-
cover your plan’s chosen investments. If you want to explore why one invest-
ment or another was chosen, however, that specific information may be
available only from the plan administrator or money managers employed by
the plan. To contact outside money managers, ask your plan administrator
for the name of the plan’s financial advisor and how to contact him or her.
No matter the size of your company, look for diversification in its investment
portfolio — you want to see a little of this and a little of that. If 80 percent of
your plan is invested in any single investment, be concerned. Your plan must
act prudently and with skill to minimize risk by diversifying its investment
portfolio. The plan shouldn’t be investing heavily in unusually risky invest-
ments, such as the following:
 Penny stocks or those equities that are trading for under a dollar
 Venture capital deals with no set value
 Real estate in exotic places or real estate connected to the plan sponsor
 Collectibles such as antiques, coins, or art
 Hedge funds
Keep the 10 percent rule in mind: With the exception of Employee Stock
Ownership Plans (ESOPs; see Chapter 3 for more details) and certain other
defined contribution plans designed to invest in employer stock, your plan
shouldn’t have more than 10 percent of the market value of its plan assets
invested in employer property or employer stock. ERISA generally prohibits
88
Part I: Focusing on Pension Fundamentals 

the investment of more than 10 percent of the plan’s assets in employer stock
or employer property in order to reduce the risk of a conflict of interest and
to diversify plan investments to prevent significant losses.
If you think that your plan is invested in unusually risky investments, discuss
your concerns with your plan administrator or the human resources depart-
ment. In extreme situations, you can consider contacting the Department of
Labor. See the later section “Taking action if you have concerns” for more
information.
Plans with more than 100 employees
If your pension plan has more than 100 employees and you want to know
what investments the plan owns, you need to go to Schedule H of Form 5500
to find out. There, you should look at Part 1, Item 1(c), where you can find
the current value of plan assets. The assets you can expect to find listed
include the following:
 Cash
 U.S. government securities, such as treasury bills
 Corporate debt instruments, which are bonds issued by corporations
 Corporate stocks
 Partnership and joint venture interests (basically business deals that the
plan is involved in)
 Real estate
 Loans
The value of these assets will be listed for the beginning of the year and the
value at the end of the year. The specific assets won’t be listed, so if you want
to know, for example, the specific stocks and bonds that the plan owns, you
should ask the folks who make your plan’s investments, such as your plan
administrator or the plan’s money managers.
Plans with fewer than 100 employees
Financial information for plans with fewer than 100 employees is found in
Schedule I, Part I, Item 3 of the Form 5500. The information for smaller plans
is limited to the value of specific assets at the end of the plan year that were
held during the plan year. Those assets include the following:
 Partnership and joint venture interests
 Employer real property, which is, for example, your company’s head-
quarters or the buildings it owns
89
Chapter 6: Monitoring the Investments in Your Pension

 Other real estate
 Employer securities (this is the stock of the company you work for)
 Participant and nonparticipant loans
For more specific information regarding the actual assets, you have to con-
tact the folks who make your plan investments, such as your plan administra-
tor or the plan’s money managers.
Keeping track of your investments’ 
performance
You have a couple of methods for checking the performance of your plan’s
investments: reviewing your benefit statement with an eagle eye and calculat-
ing the rate of return. If you have direct contact with the plan’s investment
advisors, ask them about the performance and risk of the various investment
options. If you don’t have direct contact, ask your plan administrator or your
own financial advisor, if you have one.
Your defined benefit plan has promised to pay you a set amount regardless of
your investments’ performance, so any ups and downs shouldn’t cause you
to worry yourself sick. Of course, it’s a different kettle of fish if your plan goes
belly up, as we explain in Chapter 12.
Reviewing your benefit statement
Examining your benefit statement (which we cover in more detail in Chap-
ter 8) is an easy way to see how your plan’s investments are performing, and
you don’t even have to lift a finger! The Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA)
has changed the rules as to when plans must provide their plan participants
with benefit statements. The type of plan you have determines when you get
your benefits statement. Here are the general guidelines:
 Participants in plan-managed defined benefit plans receive benefit state-
ments every three years, but you can request a benefit statement every
year.
 Participants in plan-managed defined contribution plans receive annual
benefit statements.
 Participants in defined contribution plans with participant-directed
investments receive quarterly benefit statements (every three months).
Your benefit statement should provide some very basic information that tells
you what you need to know about your investments’ performance. As a general
rule, the benefit statement should provide you with at least the amount of your
90
Part I: Focusing on Pension Fundamentals 

vested benefits (see Chapter 7 for more about vesting) and information on the
performance of the plan’s investments. Your statement may also include the
following:
 The total value of your assets
 The percentage of your account that’s vested
 The change in value of your assets since the last report
 A list of the plan’s specific holdings, including the cost and present value
of each asset
The rate of return or loss may be provided in the report, but if not, it’s simply
the percentage of increase or decrease from the previous reporting period.
So if you had a total value of $10,000 in your previous statement and jumped
to $30,000 in your new statement, you have an increase of $20,000. To get the
percentage of increase, divide the new number of $30,000 by the old number
of $10,000, which gives you a 300 percent increase.
You also need to take into account the contributions that were made to the
plan during the year when calculating investment return. For example, if the
total contributions to your plan account during the year were $7,000, the
investment gain in the previous example is only $13,000 of the total $20,000
increase in your plan account for the year.
Of course, even though a 300 percent increase is beyond the norm, what you
may see instead is a more modest gain or even a loss. If you started with
$10,000 but your new statement says that you have only $5,000, you have a
$5,000 loss since the previous statement. To get the percentage of loss, you
divide the new number of $5,000 by the old number of $10,000 and you come
up with a 50 percent loss. In reality, your gains and losses hopefully won’t
fluctuate so dramatically.
Calculating the rate of return
To determine whether your plan is getting a good return on its investments,
look at the financial information that’s listed in the plan’s Form 5500. To
roughly calculate the plan’s rate of return, add all the income (assets) and
losses (liabilities) for the year, and then divide that number by the net assets
from the beginning of the year. Here’s how to find this information:
 If your plan has more than 100 employees, go to Part I of Schedule H of
Form 5500. There, you will find the following:
• Total plan assets
• Total plan liabilities
• Net plan assets
91
Chapter 6: Monitoring the Investments in Your Pension

Go to Part II of Schedule H to check out the Income and Expenses
Statement. The following information is on this schedule:
• Total income (includes total contributions, earnings on invest-
ments, and any other income)
• Total expenses (includes benefit payments and payments to pro-
vide benefits, corrective distributions, deemed distributions, inter-
est expense, and administrative expenses)
• Net income or net loss (appears at Line 2k at the end of Part II)
 If your plan has fewer than 100 employees, go to Part I of Schedule I of
Form 5500. There, you find the following:
• Total plan assets
• Total plan liabilities
• Net plan assets
Here’s an example: WAG, Inc., a manufacturer of authentic ancient Egyptian
artifacts, has $10 million in its defined benefit plan at the beginning of the
year, according to its Form 5500. In 2009, the plan made $600,000 on income
from interest, dividends, and rents, but it also lost $100,000 on stock sales. 
To calculate the rate of return, subtract $100,000 from $600,000 for a total of
$500,000. Then divide $500,000 by the net assets from the beginning of the
year, which was $10 million. For the 2009 plan year, the rate of return was 5
percent (or 0.05). Make the same calculation for a number of years and you’ll
have an idea of how your plan’s investments are performing.
Your plan should outperform a savings account earning 4 percent yearly
interest; on the other hand, if the market was down 11 percent and your plan
lost only 7 percent, your advisors didn’t do so badly. When it comes to earn-
ings in the market, you need to refer to benchmarks to measure how well or
how poorly you’re doing.
These standard benchmarks can help you gauge your fund performance. If
you’re in a managed account with relatively high management fees, you have
every reason to expect that your account will outperform index funds that
have low fees and low turnover. An index fund is a fund that automatically
buys a little of this and a little of that to have a balanced and representative
sample of securities or fixed-income products. There are index funds for big,
medium, and small companies. The index funds include the following:
 The S&P 500 Index (SPX)
 The S&P Midcap Index (MID)
 The S&P Small Cap Index (IJR)
92
Part I: Focusing on Pension Fundamentals 

There are also index funds for long-term, intermediate, and short-term fixed
income. The point of comparing your fund to other funds is to get an objec-
tive measure of your plan’s performance and to give you a clue if your invest-
ments are doing well, poor, or average comparatively.
If the benchmarks are going one way and your account is going another, you
have reason to be concerned. If your plan permits you to choose various
mutual funds as investment options, review the investment options available
and compare their performance to the appropriate benchmarks. If you’re lim-
ited by the plan documents to a quarterly switch of plan choices, immedi-
ately begin to review the performance of the other options in your portfolio.
Seeing signs that the plan isn’t 
following investment rules
Some things can’t be repeated too many times. And this is one of them: You
can’t protect your pension investments if you don’t know the rules (and don’t
bother to check them out periodically). So, for your own sanity, please take
this section to heart.
The following rules are important, and you can check them out (by talking to
your plan administrator) if you think that they’re being abused:
 The pension money must be invested for your benefit. Nobody can use
the money for himself or herself, including the bosses, the money man-
agers, or their aunts and uncles.
 Your plan’s money can’t be used to reimburse pension employees for
treats such as lavish trips, expensive office furniture, or visits to the
health spa. If the pension managers are paid full time by the company or
a union, they can get reimbursement only for expenses that were prop-
erly incurred.
 The pension’s money managers must diversify the investments. If all of
the plan’s money is primarily in a single stock or office building, one poor
investment could tank the whole plan. The money managers shouldn’t
invest too much in any single stock, bond, or real estate. Neither should
all property owned by the plan be in one geographical area.
 Pension fund managers must use skill, care, and prudence when they
invest your money. They can be considered failing in this responsibility
if they take unreasonable risks or place the funds in a low- or no-interest
bank account.
93
Chapter 6: Monitoring the Investments in Your Pension

Beware, because if things are awry, the evidence is likely to be concealed.
However, the Form 5500 is a good place to look for possible problems. The
following sections list the likely places to find problems if your plan has more
than or fewer than 100 employees.
If the plan’s Form 5500 raises any questions, ask your plan administrator to
explain the entry. If you still have concerns after speaking to him or her, you
may want to take matters into your hands; see the later section “Taking
action if you have concerns” for more information.
Plans with more than 100 employees
In Part III of Schedule G (Form 5500), you can find detailed information about
prohibited transactions with a fiduciary (see Chapter 10 ) or disqualified
person, including who was involved, the amount of money involved, and a
description of the transaction.
A disqualified person includes your plan’s financial advisors, attorneys,
accountants, and actuaries as well as your employer. They’re disqualified
from certain transactions with the plan because they’re so closely connected
to the plan that they’re in a position to have a big influence on plan decisions.
The following are examples of prohibited transactions:
 Your fiduciary invests the plan’s money for his own benefit.
 The fiduciary gets a kickback from a vendor in exchange for doing busi-
ness with the plan.
 The fiduciary gets involved in a business deal that’s contrary to the best
interests of the plan.
 A disqualified person lends or borrows money from the plan.
 A disqualified person sells, exchanges, or leases property.
It’s to be expected that the plan will have administrative expenses for the
day-to-day management of the fund and that it will have to pay fees to finan-
cial consultants and money managers. However these expenses must be 
reasonable. In Schedule H, Part II, Item 2(i), there’s a line item for administra-
tive expenses, which lists different categories for such expenses, including
professional fees, contract administrator fees, investment advisory and man-
agement fees, and a category referred to as “other.” If the investment advi-
sory and management fees are more than 3 percent of the money under
management, the fees are grossly out of whack. Even 1 percent is high (but
acceptable). If any of the other expenses are high, you need to find out why. 
If you find $100,000 of unexplained expenses, it’s a good idea to ask what
they’re for.
94
Part I: Focusing on Pension Fundamentals 

In the same schedule, go to Part III (Accountant’s Opinion), which is where
the independent accountant can indicate his or her opinion of the plan. If the
independent accountant’s opinion indicates that the plan is unqualified or
adverse, or provides a disclaimer (these are boxes to be marked on the
form), find out what caused the accountant to indicate that there is a prob-
lem. When it comes to questions about your plan, the first place to make an
inquiry is to the plan administrator.
When you’re looking at Part IV (Transactions During Plan Year) in Schedule
H, a number of items can serve as tip-offs to a problem. For example, con-
sider these:
 Item 4(b) is where you find out whether any loans were listed as uncol-
lectible. These types of loans would include those to other businesses
that weren’t repaid and that the plan can’t collect. This item can be a red
flag that something is wrong with the way that the funds are invested.
95
Chapter 6: Monitoring the Investments in Your Pension
Checking out your plan’s financial status 
with the summary annual report
Your plan must prepare a summary annual
report (SAR) of the plan’s financial status. The
Form 5500 is the annual report for the plan; the
SAR is a summary of that information. The SAR
is usually distributed to employees at work and
mailed to retirees on an annual basis.
The SAR contains some important financial
information, including the following:
 Whether the plan’s investments lost large
amounts of money in the reporting year
 The amount of money spent on administra-
tive expenses for the year
 If money loaned by the plan wasn’t paid
back on time
 A list of items regarding the plan’s financial
transactions
The SAR can signal problems, but remember
that it’s only a summary. If you see items that
raise red flags or if you’re concerned for one
reason or another, you should look at the plan’s
complete financial statement and annual report
(Form 5500). The SAR explains how to get a copy
of the Form 5500. When requesting information,
be sure to specify the exact form that you need.
(See Chapter 8 for more on the SAR.)
Effective for plan years beginning after Decem-
ber 31, 2007, the Pension Protection Act of 2006
(PPA) has repealed the requirement that
defined benefit plans provide a SAR. Instead,
under the PPA, participants must be provided
with an annual funding notice (for each plan
year) that includes more specific information
than previously required in the SAR.
The point is this: With a little persistence and
some elbow grease, the type of information you
need to know is available. It’s when things go
awry that the information is most difficult to get.
The more difficult it is to get the information, the
more persistent you should be.

 Item 4(d) shows whether there were nonexempt transactions with plan
insiders (who are called parties in interest), such as an officer of the com-
pany selling the real estate he was given by his Aunt Cheryl and Uncle
Stanley to the plan.
 Item 4(f) explains any losses that the plan had due to fraud or dishonesty.
 Items 4(g) and 4(h) note whether the plan holds or receives assets
whose value can’t be readily determined.
 Item 4(j) is where you find out whether any plan transactions exceeded
5 percent of the current plan assets.
Plans with fewer than 100 employees
For the small plan, take a look at Schedule I (of Form 5500) to find where
there are some juicy secrets that might signal trouble. In Item 2 of Part I, you
can find the plan’s expenses. If you see big numbers listed under “other
expenses,” find out about those items. In other words, a plan with $1 million
in assets couldn’t have 5 percent of its assets (or $50,000) listed as “other”
expenses without a pretty good explanation.
In the same schedule, take a look at Part II, Item 4, which has some important
information that could signal problems. Consider these:
 Item 4(a) notes whether the plan failed to transmit employee contribu-
tions on time.
 Item 4(b) shows whether any loans were classified as uncollectible
(meaning that the loans won’t be repaid).
 Item 4(c) shows whether any leases were classified as uncollectible
(meaning that the tenant is a deadbeat and the rent is unpaid).
 Item 4(d) explains whether there were any nonexempt transactions with
any parties in interest.
 Item 4(f) states whether any losses were caused by fraud and dishonesty.
Taking action if you have concerns
If you’re concerned that your pension funds aren’t being handled properly,
contact the following government agencies, which are primarily responsible
for investigating possible violations, bringing lawsuits, and handing out fines
and penalties:
 The Department of Labor: The Department of Labor (DOL) investigates
fund mismanagement. If you’re concerned that plan trustees are violat-
ing the rules, you should contact the nearest regional field office of the
96
Part I: Focusing on Pension Fundamentals 

DOL’s Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA). These loca-
tions can be found online at www.dol.gov/ebsa/aboutebsa/
org_chart.html.
If a problem is found, the DOL can ask the plan trustees to return the
improperly removed funds and can take the plan fiduciaries to court.
The DOL could also ask a court to order penalties of 20 percent of the
recovered money and to bar the wrongdoers from ever dealing with pen-
sion plans again.
 The Internal Revenue Service: The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) can
investigate and impose penalties against anyone who’s taking advantage
of a close relationship with the plan by taking out improper loans or
making other party-in-interest inside deals. See www.irs.gov for infor-
mation on who to contact at the IRS.
A written claim for reward (for turning someone in to the IRS) that’s filed
with the Intelligence Division of the IRS may entitle you to 10 percent of
what’s collected by a penalty tax.
 Federal Bureau of Investigation: If actual stealing of pension money or
out-and-out embezzlement happens, both the DOL and the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) will step in. The FBI can turn evidence of a
crime over to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution.
If you contact the government, gather the important documents beforehand,
and be prepared to provide a clear and concise statement of your concerns.
And don’t worry: It’s unlawful for your employer to fire you or retaliate if you
give the government information about your pension investment issues.
The government may not be responsive to your claim — even when your 
concerns are well-founded. It may not pursue your claim because, given the
number of claims and the limitations on resources, the agency doesn’t share
your concern, or if it does, it doesn’t choose to pursue it. Fortunately pension
litigation is an area where a private attorney can be effective. In Chapter 19,
we provide advice on how to select the proper attorney to represent your
pension claim.
It’s Up to You: Choosing Your 
Own Pension Investments
If you’re in a defined contribution plan, you may have the opportunity to con-
trol your investment decisions. This option is referred to as a self-directed
account or a participant-directed investment, and it allows you to make invest-
ment choices from a variety of possible investments.
97
Chapter 6: Monitoring the Investments in Your Pension

However, your plan documents must provide that you, as a plan participant,
are in charge of choosing the investments. So be sure to carefully read your
plan documents (which we cover in Chapter 8) to make sure that you know
exactly who has the responsibility for making investment decisions. If you’re
in a defined contribution plan that doesn’t give you the opportunity to make
investment choices, your plan officials have the job of investing the plan’s
assets (as we explain earlier in this chapter).
You always direct the investments in SIMPLE IRAs and Simplified Employee
Pension Plans (SEPs; see Chapter 5 for more details).
Plans that provide for participant direction of investments want to satisfy the
requirements of ERISA Section 404(c). (ERISA stands for the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974; see Chapter 2 for more details.) In
order to satisfy Section 404(c), the plan must do the following:
 Provide for diversification by offering at least three different mutual
fund options with different risk/return characteristics. For example,
the plan must offer at least one bond fund, one stock fund, and one bal-
anced bond and stock fund.
Your fiduciary is legally responsible for watching and selecting the
investments that you choose from (see Chapter 10 for general info on
fiduciaries).
 Allow at least quarterly changes in investments by the participants.
The plan also must provide enough information about each investment
to allow you to make an informed decision.
Even though ERISA Section 404(c) only requires that you be permitted to
change your investments at least quarterly, most plans with participant-
directed investment options provide for 24/7 Internet access so that you
can review the investments in your plan account and make changes.
Compliance with Section 404(c) isn’t mandatory, and failure to comply with it
doesn’t cause a plan to violate ERISA. Failure to comply simply means that
plan fiduciaries may continue to be responsible under ERISA for participant-
directed investments. Fiduciaries need to continue to act prudently in select-
ing and retaining designated investment alternatives for the plan.
In the following sections, we point the way toward help with your investment
options, we explain how to monitor and change your investments, and we
warn you of what happens when you do nothing in a self-directed plan.
98
Part I: Focusing on Pension Fundamentals 

Getting help in making your 
investment choices
So how do you know which investments to pick? Our answer to this question
is “Don’t ask us; we’re lawyers.” Your best bet is to find a trusted financial
advisor who can guide you. This advisor can help you make the best choices
by taking into account your:
 Age
 Dependents
 Financial circumstances
 Health
 Tolerance for risk
Even though we may not be super at choosing investments, we do know that
as a general rule, stocks are riskier than bonds and some stocks are as risky
as the blackjack tables in Las Vegas.
Chapter 8 has details on finding a trustworthy financial advisor; be sure to
ask why he’s making his recommendations, and keep track of what invest-
ments you’ve purchased. Generally speaking, stocks, because of their ups
and downs, have to be watched more closely than bonds with fixed interest
rates. You can also check out Personal Finance For Dummies, 5th Edition, by
Eric Tyson, MBA (Wiley), to get a handle on the investment scene. However,
we suggest that you not ask your lawyer (or your doctor, for that matter) for
investment advice. This is the province of trusted financial experts.
Another option? Ask your plan’s fiduciary for help. (In this case, the fiduciary
in question is your plan’s financial advisor.) In the interest of making advice
more accessible to plan participants and prodding participants to take
advantage of professionally managed funds, the PPA has relaxed some of the
rules regarding plan fiduciaries giving advice on investment choices. Prior to
the act, it could be considered a conflict of interest for your fiduciary to use
his or her influence to make money as a result of advice provided directly to
you, the plan participant.
Now, because of the PPA, your fiduciary is permitted to give financial advice
directly to you as long as the following conditions are met:
 The fiduciary can’t increase his compensation with his advice. It 
doesn’t matter whether he recommends Fudgalot Hedge Fund or
Stikumtuyu Preferred Stock Certificates; as long as the advice results in
the same level fees regardless of the investment recommendation you
99
Chapter 6: Monitoring the Investments in Your Pension

select, the advice is within PPA limits. In other words, if the fees stay the
same (or level) and don’t go up as a result of the recommendation, it
doesn’t matter if he wants you to buy stock A or stock B.
 If the fiduciary wants to avoid the level fee restriction, his advice
must conform to a computer-designed program. The idea is that if he’s
restricted to a predesigned program, it can’t be tailor-made to take
advantage of you. The computer model must do the following:
• Use generally accepted investment theories that figure in the
returns of different types of assets over time
• Be relevant to you, your age, your risk tolerance, your other
assets, your life expectancy, and so on
• Not operate in a manner that’s biased in favor of the investment
advisor or his cohorts
• Use objective criteria to determine which investment options
under the plan are best for plan participants
• Consider the various options in the plan and properly evaluate
them before determining how your account should be invested
If you choose the computer investment model option, all the advice by
the financial advisor must be given through the computer model unless,
unprompted by your advisor, you independently ask for advice that isn’t
related to the computer model. Then, and only then, is he permitted to
offer unrestricted advice.
 Under the PPA, your investment advisor is obligated to advise you of
the amounts and the sources of his fees. In recent years in the world of
investment advice, amounts and sources of fees have often been closely
guarded secrets (much too sensitive to be indiscriminately shared with
those who are paying them). But luckily, the PPA now requires increased
disclosure of both the source and the amount of the investment advi-
sor’s fees.
Checking (and changing) 
your investments
You keep track of investments in a self-directed plan the same way that you
do in a plan-managed plan; see the earlier section “Keeping track of your
investments’ performance” for the full scoop. The main difference is that 
participants in self-directed plans receive benefit statements to review on a
quarterly basis.
100
Part I: Focusing on Pension Fundamentals 

If you, like many others, are investing your 401(k) with a broker, you may be
able to obtain a daily statement by using the Internet to go to the firm’s secure
Web site. There, you can look at your account and change investments.
Unlike with plan-managed investments, you have the option of making
changes to your self-directed investments on at least a quarterly basis. Your
plan is required to provide instructions regarding how to make changes to
the account. It must also note any fees from the transactions.
Failing to exercise your investment options
What happens if, given all the possible investment choices, you opt to go
spelunking instead of picking an investment option? Well, if you make no
choice at all, it’s then up to the fiduciary to make the investment prudently
on your behalf.
To provide fiduciary protection when a default investment is made on your
behalf, the PPA stepped in with a brand-new concept called the qualified
default investment alternative. This latest addition to the pension alphabet
soup is affectionately known by all bureaucrats and investment advisors as
the QDIA. A QDIA is treated as if you actually exercise control over the
account. In order to avoid investment liability, a QDIA must meet all the fol-
lowing requirements:
 You or your beneficiaries had to have the opportunity to self-direct your
investments (but for whatever reason, you didn’t).
 The investments must be diversified.
 At least once every quarter, you must have the right to switch without
penalty to another investment option offered by your plan.
 The investment must be managed by an investment company or fiduciary.
 You must receive a notice 30 days before the investment is first made 
on your behalf and 30 days in advance of the investment being made for
each following plan year. The notice must explain your right to direct the
investment yourself and explain how the account will be invested if you
make no choice. It also must be written so that it can be understood,
which is the exception for most financial documents.
 The plan must make available all the investment material that it receives
from the investment advisors or from the actual investment, such as a
mutual fund or stock (and it must send the materials to you upon your
request).
101
Chapter 6: Monitoring the Investments in Your Pension

 The investments must be one of the following three types:
• Balanced funds under which the investments are split between
stocks (equities) and bonds (fixed-rate investments)
• Managed accounts, which are set up and invested by the plan’s
investment advisor
• Age-based lifecycle or target funds, which adjust the investment
risk to be safer or more conservative as you get older
102
Part I: Focusing on Pension Fundamentals 
Special rules for special investment situations
Sometimes, for a certain period of time, your plan
doesn’t allow you to make any investment deci-
sions. This downtime in which you’re prevented
from directing your investment for more than
three consecutive business days is referred to as
a blackout. You may also run into times when the
plan is changing its investment options. This is
referred to as mapping, and it will involve a
blackout period. During a blackout period, your
plan has to follow some special rules:
 Because you have no control during a
blackout, in order to avoid liability for losses
during this time, your fiduciary must provide
you notice of the blackout at least 30 days
before it begins.
 When it comes to mapping, if the plan
changes from one investment option to
another and the two options are similar, the
plan won’t be liable for investment losses as
long as notice was provided.
Notice must be given at least 30 days, but
no more than 60 days, before the switch.
The notice must describe the change and
include a comparison with your current
investment. It must also advise you of your
right to invest in a different investment
option under the plan. Unless you make a
decision to change the investment, you
can’t bring a claim against the fiduciary for
any losses as a result of the change from
the prior investment option to the new
mapped investment option.

Making Sure That
You Receive

In this part . . .
C
ontrary to popular belief, pension benefits are fre-
quently miscalculated. For this reason, nothing’s
more important than making sure that when you retire,
you receive all the pension benefits that you’re entitled 
to. In this part, you discover how to be among those
retirees who get the right amount right off the bat. First,
we explain the basics of eligibility, accrual, and vesting 
in your pension plan. We then identify some helpful guide-
lines for planning your retirement while you’re still work-
ing. Finally, we give you an overview of the rules regarding
the distribution of your pension benefits.

Getting the Scoop on Eligibility,
Accrual, and Vesting
In This Chapter
 Meeting eligibility requirements for a pension plan
 Getting a grip on accrual
 Determining when the benefits are yours
E
ligibility, accrual, and vesting are the Three Musketeers of your pension
plan. Unless you meet all the requirements, no pension is on your hori-
zon. Here’s how the three work together in a nutshell:
 First, you must become eligible, or in other words, you must fulfill your
company’s minimum standards to participate in the plan. Generally,
these requirements relate to age and the length of time you work.
 As you work, you accrue (or accumulate) benefits in the plan. When and
how benefits accrue is central to your pension’s value. Accrual is like
building credit; until the benefits vest (or are no longer subject to forfei-
ture), the money you’ve accrued remains out of reach.
 Finally, and most critically, after your benefits are fully vested (in other
words, when they can’t be taken away from you), you can lay claim
(when the time is right) to all you have accrued.
This chapter lays out these bedrock concepts in detail.
Eligibility: Officially Entering a Plan
Your employer’s retirement plan can establish both age and service require-
ments that you must satisfy before you can participate in the plan. The
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), however, doesn’t

give a plan free reign; it sets minimum standards for age and service. The
plan can be more generous than those standards, but not less generous. The
first step to determine if you’re eligible is to check the plan’s language in the
summary plan description (SPD). (See Chapter 8 for more about the docu-
ments the plan must provide you and how you can request the SPD.)
The following sections outline common minimum standards and help you
determine whether you’re entitled to participate in your employer’s plan.
Meeting age requirements
A plan can establish a minimum age that employees must be to participate in
the plan, but it can’t set a maximum age. But the plan isn’t required to have a
minimum age requirement for eligibility, so if it wants to, it can permit partici-
pation for any employee, regardless of age. Here are the general guidelines:
 A plan can require that employees be at least 21 years old before they
can participate in the plan. However, a plan can’t require a minimum age
greater than age 21 for plan participation.
 Even though your plan can exclude employees younger than 21, it can’t
exclude employees because they’re older. For example, your plan can’t
have a rule that says employees older than 50 aren’t eligible to partici-
pate in the pension plan.
Surveying service requirements
Your plan can impose certain restrictions on the length of time (known as ser-
vice) you must work before you’re eligible to participate in the pension plan,
subject to certain limitations. Breaks in service can impact your eligibility,
too. We explain years of service and breaks in those years of service in the
following sections.
Starting with a year (or more) of service
It’s common for qualified retirement plans to require that employees complete
a full year of service before they can participate in the pension plan. However,
just because you aren’t yet eligible to participate in the plan doesn’t mean the
plan can’t count the work you’ve already performed when you do become 
eligible.
If the plan has eligibility requirements of age 21 and one year of service, you
begin to participate in the plan when you complete the later of the require-
ments. So if you began working for the company at age 19, you would already
have completed your one year of service before you reach age 21 and you
106
Part II: Making Sure That You Receive the Pension You Earned 

would complete your eligibility requirements on your 21st birthday. A plan, 
in any instance, can’t require more than two years of work for eligibility pur-
poses, and it can require this number of years only if the plan provides for
full and immediate vesting after the two years (we discuss vesting later in
this chapter).
The rules for a 401(k) are different from those for other types of pension
plans. If you’re in a 401(k) plan, you only need to work one year to meet the
minimum service requirement before you can contribute a portion of your
salary to the plan. Many 401(k) plans provide for shorter eligibility periods 
of 30 or 90 days. For general information about 401(k) plans, see Chapter 4.
Your plan can choose one of the following two methods for determining
whether you have earned a year of service:
 The actual-hours method of counting service: The plan may define a year
of service for eligibility purposes as up to 1,000 hours worked during a
consecutive 12-month period. An hour of work means an hour that you
were paid to work or were entitled to be paid (such as paid vacation time).
The 12-month period for crediting service for participation is generally
either the plan year (which could be a calendar year or a noncalendar
fiscal year) or the anniversary of your date of hire. Under this method,
your employer must keep track of the number of hours you actually work.
If the plan doesn’t want to count actual hours, the Department of Labor
has provided alternatives. For example, the plan can count days worked
(each day will be worth nine hours) or weeks worked (each week is
worth 45 hours). These are known as hour equivalencies.
 The elapsed-time method: Under this method, your employer simply
keeps track of the credited time since you started work. You basically get
one year of service for each full year you work, no matter how few hours
you actually work. But if your employer lays you off or you quit before the
end of the year, you don’t get a full year of service for that year — even if
you’ve actually worked more than 1,000 hours. This method of counting
can really hurt workers if they’re fired before the last day of the year in
which they would have fully vested in their benefits.
Look at your SPD to see which method your plan uses to calculate service.
Check out Chapter 8 for full details about this handy document.
Understanding breaks in service
If you leave work and then return, your plan may consider you to have a
break in service. A break in service is generally a plan year during which you
work fewer than 501 hours. Whether your leave is considered a break in ser-
vice may depend on why you take the break and how long you’re gone. If you
take time off to go skiing or help orphans in Africa, you’ll have a break in ser-
vice if you don’t work the 501 hours in a plan year.
107
Chapter 7: Getting the Scoop on Eligibility, Accrual, and Vesting

If you leave and go back to work after military service, however, your time
away from the office may not be treated as a break in service. And better yet,
you may get credit for the time you were in the military. (Another special
exception is maternity and paternity leave; see the next section.)
Sometimes you simply can’t help taking a break from your job, but keep in
mind that you can lose credit for the years you’ve already worked, depending
on the number of breaks and the previous years you’ve worked. You don’t
forfeit prior years worked because of a break in service unless you have at
least five consecutive breaks. For example, if you worked three years and
then took five consecutive breaks in service (you took time off to scuba dive
one year; you spent many weeks caring for a sick relative the next year; you
took a leave of absence to complete your MBA; and so on), you could lose the
unvested benefits you accrued those first three years. No matter how many
breaks in service you have, you won’t lose the portion of your plan benefits
that was vested prior to the break.
If you work more than 500 hours but fewer than 1,000 hours, that’s neither a
break in service nor a year of service, and you would essentially be in limbo
during each year, neither gaining nor losing benefits.
A special occasion: Going on maternity or paternity leave
Say you’re about to be a new mom or dad and you want to stay home for a
couple of months with your new son or daughter. Congrats! But the last thing
you want to worry about right now is how taking time off from your job will
affect your pension. You can relax. The rules for maternity or paternity leave
are straightforward.
As a rule, your absence from work must be for one of the following reasons:
 Your pregnancy
 The birth of your child
 An adoption by you
 Caring for your child right after the birth or adoption
The great thing about taking maternity or paternity leave is that you’re con-
sidered to have worked at least 501 hours when it comes to determining a
break in service. So if you go on maternity or paternity leave for 12 months,
that time doesn’t count as a break in service.
The total number of credited hours given to you by the company for mater-
nity or paternity leave isn’t required to exceed 501 hours. But it must be cred-
ited in the year the absence begins, and the credits are necessary to prevent
a break in service for that year or the following year.
108
Part II: Making Sure That You Receive the Pension You Earned 

For example, if you went on maternity leave in 2002 after working 750 hours
that year and if you returned to work in 2004, you wouldn’t have incurred a
break in service for either 2002 or 2003. You don’t have a break in service for
2002 because you worked more than 501 hours that year, and you don’t have
a break in service in 2003 because you were on maternity leave and entitled
to one free break in service that year.
To pensioners who took maternity or paternity leave: Check your SPD to find
out the company policy on maternity and paternity leave and your individual
benefit statement (or whatever document the plan provides you that details
your service credit) to see if you were given credit for the time you took off
for this reason. The whole idea of maternity and paternity leave is that you
can take the time off and not be penalized for it. So if you weren’t given the
credit you were entitled to, bring it to the attention of your plan administra-
tor for correction.
Checking that your plan follows 
the eligibility rules
Take a look at your SPD to confirm that your plan follows the rules as they
apply to eligibility. Both big plans and small plans make mistakes, so you
always need to be on the lookout. One of the main reasons we wrote this
book is to provide you with the rules that you need so that you can deter-
mine if they’re being followed. Here are few guidelines to keep in mind as
you’re reviewing your SPD:
 Your plan should specify the method used to compute the eligibility
period (actual hours versus elapsed time).
 If your plan credits hours of service when no work was performed (for
example, if you’re on a leave as a result of a work-related injury), it
should spell out the rules for crediting those hours. Generally, a plan
must credit service for all hours that you were paid, including paid 
vacation or paid personal time.
 The eligibility period for figuring a break in service should be the same
as the one used to figure a year of service. In other words, both time
periods should be computed by the same method.
 Your plan should make clear any age or service requirements.
 Your plan must provide credit hours to prevent a break in service for
maternity or paternity leave (which we cover in the previous section).
If you have questions regarding plan eligibility or you can’t understand the
explanation in the SPD, contact your plan administrator.

Chapter 7: Getting the Scoop on Eligibility, Accrual, and Vesting

Accrual: The Pension Is Almost Yours
Accrual is when your benefits grow or accumulate in your plan. As your bene-
fits accrue, they accumulate in your pension account. However, until those
accrued benefits vest (or are no longer subject to forfeiture), they can still be
taken from you (we cover vesting later in this chapter). We explain the basics
of accrual and discuss an important anti-cutback rule affecting your pension
rights in the following sections.
Grasping the basics of 
growing your benefits
Your benefits under a defined benefit plan are generally based on a formula that
includes your years of service and the level of your compensation. Your benefits
under a defined contribution plan are based on your account balance, which
includes both employee and employer contributions and investment earnings.
Forfeiture
In order to understand forfeiture, you first need to understand the relation-
ship between accrual and vesting. Accrual allows your account to grow, but
the money in the account still isn’t exactly yours because it can be taken
away from you or forfeited. When those accrued benefits vest, they’re yours
and are available to you when you retire. This is known as full benefit accrual
(see the next section). After accrued benefits are vested, they’re no longer
subject to being lost or forfeited, regardless of the reason.
A forfeiture occurs if you terminate employment prior to being fully vested in
your benefits under the plan. The nonvested portion of your benefits (accrued
but not yet vested) may be forfeited when you terminate employment, and your
benefit will consist only of the vested portion of your plan benefits. For exam-
ple, if you’re fired before you’re 100 percent vested, you forfeit only the portion
that isn’t vested. So if you were 25 percent vested with $100,000 of accrued ben-
efits, you would forfeit $75,000 and retain $25,000 — your vested portion.
Any time you put your own money into your pension as part of a defined con-
tribution plan, the money is all yours and can’t ever be forfeited.
Full benefit accrual
The size of your benefits and the rate at which they grow depends on the 
specific type of pension that you have and on whether it’s a defined contribu-
tion or defined benefit plan (see Chapter 3 for the basics on these plans). 
To estimate the size of the benefits that you’re accumulating, examine your
SPD. Make sure you understand how you earn service credit for full benefit
accrual and that you’re receiving the proper credit for each year.
110
Part II: Making Sure That You Receive the Pension You Earned 

When it comes to benefit accrual, generally the calculation of your service
counts only those years that you worked after you became a plan participant,
not from the time you started to work. A defined benefit plan, however, can
give you benefit credit for years before you started work in the plan. The
most common situation for this is when an employer adopts a plan; it may
give benefit credit for service before the plan even started. This credit is
known as past-service credit.
In order to accrue a benefit for a given year, a defined benefit plan can require
that you have 1,000 hours of service during a plan year. To receive a contribu-
tion in a defined contribution plan, however, the plan can require that you
have 1,000 hours of service during the year and that you’re employed by the
employer sponsoring the plan on the last day of the plan year.
You should be able to review the number of service credits that you’ve
accrued in your plan on your individual benefit statement (see Chapter 8 for
details on this document). So that you get what’s rightfully yours, always be
sure to keep track of the value of your credits and benefits throughout the
years that you work. If you think that your benefit statement hasn’t properly
credited your years of service with the company or doesn’t reflect your total
compensation, contact your plan administrator or your employer’s human
resources department.
Avoiding an improper retroactive 
reduction of your benefits
As a rule of thumb, the anti-cutback rule prevents your plan from reducing
your benefits after they’ve accrued. The plan can, however, reduce the rate 
at which future benefits may accrue. For example, if your plan is amended in
2009, benefits accrued before the date of the amendment in 2009 can’t be
reduced. Benefits accrued after the date of the 2009 amendment may, how-
ever, be modified or reduced.
In addition to the amounts that you’ve accumulated, your plan can’t retroac-
tively reduce or eliminate the following:
 Optional forms of benefits, such as the right to take your payment in a
lump sum instead of an annuity.
 Early retirement benefits, if your plan offers them.
 A retirement subsidy, which is when your plan provides an additional
perk and absorbs the cost. For example, your plan may decide to let
plan participants retire at age 60 and pay them the same benefits as if
they had continued working until age 65.
111
Chapter 7: Getting the Scoop on Eligibility, Accrual, and Vesting

Certain types of benefits, by their nature, may be reduced or terminated with-
out running afoul of the anti-cutback rule. This list includes the following:
 Social Security supplements
 Various types of insurance, such as accident, health, or life insurance
 The ability to take a loan from the plan (see Chapter 13 for more details)
 Self-direction of your investments (self-direction is when you’re permit-
ted to make decisions regarding how your pension money is invested)
Carefully look at all reductions of benefits and/or plan amendments to deter-
mine if rights you had before the change have been taken away wrongfully. Be
sure to read Chapter 12 for a more detailed discussion on plan amendments
involving the reduction or elimination of past and future benefits and the
notice requirements that your plan must follow.
Vesting: The Pension Is Yours, 
and No One Can Take It!
The idea behind vesting is that at some point, the accrued benefits are all
yours and can’t be forfeited if you quit, lose your job, or for any other reason.
Your plan, whether it’s a defined contribution or defined benefit plan, must
meet certain minimum vesting periods.
A vesting schedule is a time period over which your benefits under the plan
become nonforfeitable. Each schedule has two elements: years of vested ser-
vice (generally based on 1,000 hours in a plan year) and the percentage of
your accrued benefit that’s vested. All of your years of service with the
employer starting at age 18 count for vesting service, even if you weren’t yet
a participant in the plan. Two types of vesting schedules exist:
 Cliff vesting is all or nothing; you’re 0 percent vested until you fall off the
cliff and become 100 percent vested.
 Graded vesting provides for different vesting levels for different years of
service.
Your plan’s vesting schedule is stated in the SPD.
When you receive your individual benefit statement (see Chapter 8 for
details), review your accrued benefits and the percentage of your vested ben-
efits to see if the statement is accurate. If the benefits don’t seem to be cor-
rect, contact the plan administrator.
112
Part II: Making Sure That You Receive the Pension You Earned 

In the following sections, we describe different types of vesting schedules
and potential amendments to those schedules.
Employee contributions to defined contribution plans are 100 percent vested
at all times. The money started as yours and remains yours. Benefits under a
SEP or SIMPLE IRA are 100 percent vested at all times as well; see Chapter 5
for more about these types of plans.
Looking at accelerated vesting schedules
Effective for plan years beginning after 2006, the Pension Protection Act of
2006 (PPA) has accelerated the vesting of benefits in defined contribution
plans. Starting in 2007, contributions must take no longer than three years to
vest under a cliff vesting schedule and no longer than six years under a
graded vesting schedule. Defined benefit plans that are top-heavy also are
subject to these accelerated vesting schedules.
A top-heavy plan is a plan in which the present value of the accrued benefits
of the big, important employees (called key employees) is more than 60 per-
cent of the present value of the total benefits under the plan. A top-heavy
plan must use a vesting schedule no longer than a three-year cliff vesting or
six-year graded vesting schedule. The top-heavy schedules apply to both
defined contribution and defined benefit plans.
Under a three-year cliff vesting schedule, you aren’t vested at all for the first
two years, and then — ba-da-bing! — you’re 100 percent vested at the com-
pletion of the third year of eligible service. Table 7-1 shows the current post-
PPA vesting schedule as of 2007 using cliff vesting.

Under a six-year graded vesting schedule, you’re 20 percent vested after two
years, and then the amount increases by 20 percent each year until you’re
100 percent vested after six years. Table 7-2 shows the current graded vesting
schedule in use after the enactment of the PPA (as of 2007).

Viewing less rapid vesting schedules
While employer contributions to defined contribution plans after 2006 are
subject to accelerated vesting schedules, defined benefit pension plans are
subject to less rapid minimum vesting schedules. An employer may elect to
have two vesting schedules under a defined contribution plan: an accelerated
schedule for contributions made after 2006 and a longer or less rapid sched-
ule for contributions made before 2007. Because forfeitures of nonvested
funds under a plan can be used to offset and reduce employer contributions
for the year of the forfeiture, some employers choose to have the longest
possible vesting schedule.
The PPA, however, does require that vesting under a cash balance type of
defined benefit plan be no longer than three-year cliff vesting.
Table 7-3 shows the cliff vesting schedule for defined benefit plans and for
contributions to defined contribution plans before 2007.

Dealing with multiple vesting schedules
As we mention earlier, the PPA changed the minimum vesting schedules for
defined contribution plans. So, depending on when you earned your benefits,
your employer may have to keep track of multiple vesting schedules for your
account balances. The obvious, immediate impact of this change is that your
plan’s benefit statement may show more than one vesting schedule, which
means that some of your accrued benefits are vesting faster than others.
Due to the confusion that can be caused by using multiple vesting schedules,
many employers have elected to amend their plan to apply the three-year
cliff or six-year graded vesting schedules to all participants employed in 2007,
when the new schedule takes effect.
115
Chapter 7: Getting the Scoop on Eligibility, Accrual, and Vesting

Review your benefit statement each year to make sure that both your bene-
fits and your vested percentage are properly calculated. If they aren’t correct,
contact your plan administrator or your company’s human resources office.
Amending the vesting schedule
If it chooses, the plan can amend the vesting schedule. A defined benefit plan
may choose, for example, to change from a five-year cliff vesting to a seven-
year graded vesting schedule or to accelerate vesting with a three-year cliff
vesting schedule in order to enhance the value of the plan for its participants.
If the vesting schedule is amended, you aren’t without rights. If you have
completed at least three years of service, you can elect to remain under the
old vesting schedule. If you make no decision, you automatically go into the
new schedule, provided that you were notified of the change.
Of course, the plan still has to comply with the minimum vesting require-
ments imposed by law, and your benefits can never be less vested than they
were when the vesting schedule was amended.
Reviewing your plan’s vesting policies
Here are some quick (though not complete) guidelines that explain how your
plan should deal with vesting issues. By going over these guidelines, you’ll
see whether your plan is complying with the vesting rules under ERISA (see
Chapter 2). Because your plan may have service requirements in order for
you to be vested, you’ll notice some overlap with the earlier checklists.
 Your SPD and plan document should clearly spell out how hours of ser-
vice are credited toward vesting. (We discuss SPDs and plan documents
in Chapter 8, and we explain how to go about obtaining them if you don’t
already have them.)
 The SPD and plan document should define a break in service.
 If you leave your job with vested benefits and then return to employ-
ment, your prebreak service should be counted when determining your
vested benefits from employer contributions.
Vesting problems occur frequently. If you think that your vested percentage is
inaccurate (or you have other questions), contact your plan administrator.

Chapter 8
Planning for Retirement 
While You’re Still Working
In This Chapter
 Estimating your retirement costs
 Assembling the right pension information to prepare for retirement
 Putting everything together for a clear retirement picture
W
e all know that we need to save money for those things that we want
to buy, like a new car, a house, or a fancy, high-end TV set. Everything
costs money, and the cost of retirement is no different. In fact, your retire-
ment is one of the most costly things you’ll ever pay for. As we continue to
live longer, we’ll have more years of retirement during which we’ll need to be
supported. And the more years we live after retirement, the more expensive
retirement becomes.
These days, fewer employers are choosing to provide traditional defined ben-
efit pension plans (see Chapter 3) because of the funding requirements and
the expenses involved. Often companies instead offer retirement options
such as 401(k)s (see Chapter 4), which are paid for primarily by the employee
rather than the employer. Or the employer may choose not to offer retire-
ment benefits at all, putting the burden directly on the employee. In this case,
the employee must shoulder the responsibility of planning responsibly for
retirement.
To know how much you should save for retirement, you need to know what
you can expect your pension plan to provide you so that you can calculate
how it fits into your overall retirement savings plan. We show you the ropes
in this chapter.

Tallying the Cost of Your Retirement
For most American workers, the goal of retirement is to have a secure future.
And a secure future means different things to different people. For those people
who plan to settle into a modest lifestyle in a less expensive part of the coun-
try, retirement will be more affordable than for the person who plans to take
lavish vacations and live the high life. Likewise, it will be more affordable for
those who are planning to retire closer to the normal retirement age of 65 (or
even later) than it will be for those who are planning to retire well in advance 
of that age. Obviously, the more years you have to save, the better off you are.
We aren’t professional financial planners or financial counselors — we’ll leave
that job to someone else. These types of professionals can help you determine
exactly how much money you need to put aside now to ensure a secure retire-
ment later. (And we highly recommend that you consult a professional planner
or counselor for this type of help! We show you how to find a pro later in this
chapter.) But we can say with certainty that it’s difficult to save adequately for
retirement if you don’t know how much you need to put aside each month. And
of course that amount depends on your retirement plans: at what age you plan
to retire and what your expectations are for retirement.
To meet the goal of a secure future, it’s important to make retirement plan-
ning a priority. This planning starts in the following sections with a basic
understanding of the costs of retirement.
Calculating your current net worth
Your current financial resources directly affect your ability to reach your
retirement goals and your ability to protect those goals from potential finan-
cial crises. These resources are all those assets that are available to help you
meet life’s expected and unexpected occurrences. A good place to begin in
the examination of your resources is with a calculation of your net worth. If
you’re married, don’t forget to take into account the net worth of both you
and your spouse.
Your net worth is the total value of what you own (your assets) minus what
you owe (your liabilities). Your net worth is a picture of your financial health.
To determine the approximate value of your assets, add up the current
market value of the following:
 Your personal possessions
Of course, used clothes and well-worn furniture have little value, while
diamonds, expensive watches, collectibles, and art can be worth a
bundle. You don’t need to list every little item; the value of the pricier
items is just one part of your net worth, which is, after all, just an
approximation.
118
Part II: Making Sure That You Receive the Pension You Earned 

 Your vehicles (yours and your spouse’s)
 Your individual and joint checking accounts
 Your individual and joint savings accounts
 The cash value (not death benefits) of life insurance policies
 The current value of investments, including stocks, bonds, certificates of
deposit, retirement accounts, individual retirement accounts (IRAs; see
Chapter 5 for an introduction), and any pensions that you and your
spouse have
 The current value of all real estate
To determine your liabilities, add up the following:
 The outstanding mortgage on your home
 Family credit card debt
 Your loans and your spouse’s, including student loans, auto loans,
income taxes due and owing, and taxes due on the profits of any of your
investments (if you’ve cashed them in)
 Any other outstanding bills or debts that you and your spouse have or
may have in the future, including the present value of the cost of your
children’s educations and the present value of taking care of dependent
parents
Even though these items may not be current obligations, ignoring them
will give you an unrealistic picture of your financial health.
Subtract your liabilities from your assets to arrive at your net worth. Your
goal is to have a positive net worth that grows from year to year. You’ll rely
on this net worth to help support your future, and you can draw on these
funds when you’re faced with a financial crisis (which, of course, can happen
to anyone!).
Considering your retirement 
age and lifestyle options
A lot depends on when you want to retire and the kind of retirement you
want to enjoy — namely, how much you need to save between now and then
(don’t worry; we get to that in the next section).
If you plan to retire early, before the normal retirement age set forth in your
plan, you need to build a larger nest egg than if you retire later. That larger
nest egg is necessary because you’ll be living on it for a much longer period
of time, and early retirement may mean a smaller pension. This scenario is
especially true if you don’t plan on working during retirement.
119
Chapter 8: Planning for Retirement While You’re Still Working

You also need to consider your lifestyle options during retirement. Someone
who’s planning a quiet, modest retirement in a low-cost part of the country
needs a lot less money than someone who plans to live in a fancy gated com-
munity and to winter on the French Riviera.
Making a decision about your retirement lifestyle may be a bit easier if you
consider the following questions:
 Do you plan to live in an expensive part of the country (or world)?
 Do you plan to travel to foreign countries?
 Are you planning to work part time or volunteer?
 Are you healthy or do you anticipate a large portion of your retirement
going toward medical expenses?
 Will you go back to school?
 Are you planning to visit with your grandkids regularly or spend time
golfing at a country club?
 Will you have to support your parents or children or pay for your chil-
dren’s college educations?
 Do you want to leave an inheritance for your descendants?
Estimating how much you need to save
Consider the following questions when you begin to calculate how large your
retirement nest egg will need to be.
How much retirement income will you need?
The rule of thumb is that you need 70 to 90 percent of your preretirement
income in order to enjoy the standard of living to which you’ve become
accustomed. This number is often called the annual cost of your retirement.
The more caviar and champagne in your retirement plans, the higher the per-
centage of your preretirement income you’ll need.
Everyone’s expenses are different, of course, but typically, as a retiree, you
can expect that they will decline. However, as usual, there are a number of
exceptions to that rule. For example, if you still own a home, have kids in
school, have college debts to pay off, or have large medical bills to pay, your
expenses are likely to be more than the average retiree’s. Taxes are also usu-
ally smaller for retirees, and costs related to work usually disappear.
120
Part II: Making Sure That You Receive the Pension You Earned 

How many years are left until you retire?
The more years you have left, the less you have to save each month, and vice
versa.
There’s an advantage to saving as much as you can early, though, because
you’ll benefit the most from the compounding of investment income. You
should try to save the same percentage of your income throughout your life
and perhaps a larger percentage of your income when you’re young.
How long will you live during your retirement?
Obviously, your exact life span isn’t really known (or knowable) and you
don’t have complete control over it, but there are some statistics that can
help you with your planning. For instance, these days a man who retires at
age 55 can expect to live about 23 years into retirement. A woman who retires
at the same age can expect to live about 27 years into retirement. And the
likelihood that a male retiree will live at least 20 more years is more than 60
percent. For women retirees, that likelihood is about 75 percent.
These figures are only averages, however. For example, white-collar people
tend to live longer, and for every person who lives to the actuarial average,
there is another person who dies sooner or much later. You, of course, must
plan for your own circumstances. If you die early or haven’t made provisions
for the possibility of outliving the average life expectancy, you’re truly up the
creek without a paddle.
And don’t forget that the healthier you are, the longer you’ll live — especially
if you have good genes.
What other sources of income will be available 
to you when you begin to save for retirement?
Your net worth (which we show you how to calculate earlier in this chapter)
will tell you whether you’re going to be dependent on your pension to sup-
port you during retirement. Income in addition to your wages (for example, if
you receive income from rental property or dividends from investments) will
help as you begin to save for retirement.
When do you plan to start taking Social Security benefits?
The longer you can delay taking them, the higher they’ll be when you start
taking them. But keep in mind that the longer you delay them, the longer you
have to live in order to receive enough payments to make up for the delay in
taking them. Complications also arise if you take your Social Security benefits
before you reach the magic age of 65. Before you decide what’s best for you,
go to your local Social Security office and ask for guidance regarding your
particular situation.
121
Chapter 8: Planning for Retirement While You’re Still Working

Are you making adjustments to savings for inflation?
The less your money will be worth in future years, the more of it you’re going
to need. Because the annual inflation rate is certain to change over time, your
best bet is to assume a higher rate of inflation so that the purchasing power
of your available money won’t be seriously eroded.
What annual rate of return can you expect on your investments?
Just to play it safe, financial planners often rely on historical rates of return
based on the risk of the types of investments you choose. The greater the
risk, the bigger your potential return or the bigger your possible loss. In
other words, expect less, and then if you get more, you’ll be pleasantly sur-
prised.
Gathering the Goods on 
Your Pension Plan
After you have a clear picture of what your retirement years will look like,
you have to decide whether your company’s pension plan will be all you need
or whether it will just be a part of the solution. This decision depends on not
only the size of your pension, but also on the strength of the plan.
Our mission, then, is to help you understand how your pension plan factors
into your overall assessment of the income that you need for retirement. The
documents and information in the following sections help you determine later
on just how much retirement security you actually have and how secure it
really is.
The necessary pension plan papers
To find out what type of plan you have and what benefits it will provide, you
need to assemble your pension documents. It’s important to understand
what these documents provide so that you can better understand the rela-
tionship between your plan’s benefits and your overall retirement picture.
The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) requires plan
administrators to give you the following documents regarding your retire-
ment plan’s features and funding. Some documents must be given to you
automatically and regularly, while others are available to you upon request.
Head to Chapter 2 to find out when you can expect to receive these docu-
ments under ERISA regulations.
122
Part II: Making Sure That You Receive the Pension You Earned 

The summary plan description
One of the most important documents your plan administrator must provide
you is called the summary plan description (SPD). This summary of the retire-
ment plan gives you the following information:
 Details of how the plan works, including critical plan information and
whether it’s a defined benefit or defined contribution plan (see Chap-
ter 3 for details)
 What benefits it provides
 When an employee can begin participating in the plan
 How service and benefits are calculated
 When benefits becomes vested (see Chapter 7 for more about vesting)
 When and in what form benefits are paid
 How to file a claim for benefits
 Your rights and protections under ERISA
Revisions to the plan
If your retirement plan ever changes, you must be informed through a sum-
mary of material modifications (SMM) or a revised summary plan description.
The SMM is the notice that you’re entitled to receive of significant modifica-
tions to the plan, such as when an amendment will lower future benefit accru-
als. The revised SPD incorporates the changes into a new plan document.
The summary annual report and Form 5500
Under federal law, your pension plan must give you information about the plan
investments. The plan must automatically provide you, free of charge, with 
a summary of its finances for each year or a written notice of your right to
receive that summary. The summary is called a summary annual report, or SAR.
Effective for plan years beginning after December 31, 2007, the Pension
Protection Act of 2006 (PPA) has repealed the requirement that defined bene-
fit plans provide SARs. Instead, under the PPA, they must provide partici-
pants with an annual funding notice for each plan year that includes more
specific information than was previously required in the SAR.
In addition, if you ask in writing, your plan administrator must give you a
copy of the full annual report and the financial statements that the plan files
with the government, referred to as a Form 5500. The Department of Labor
(DOL) and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC; see Chapter 12)
jointly developed the Form 5500.
123
Chapter 8: Planning for Retirement While You’re Still Working

The SAR is usually one to two pages long and it summarizes the information
that’s in the retirement plan’s Form 5500 and the more detailed financial
statements and schedules. It gives you a sense of how well your pension
plan’s investments have performed. For example, it shows
 Whether the plan’s investments have lost large amounts of money
during a year
 The plan’s total administrative expenses for the year
 A list of items that can alert you to questionable financial arrangements
with individuals or organizations that are closely connected to the plan
 If any money loaned by the plan hasn’t been paid back on time
Your individual benefit statement
The individual benefit statement is a statement that describes your total
accrued and vested benefits (benefits earned to date). Before the PPA, this
statement was required to be provided to you upon your written request only
once every 12 months.
For plan years starting after December 31, 2006, benefit statements will be
provided to participants automatically, on a quarterly basis if you self-direct
your investments and on a yearly basis if you don’t. (See Chapter 6 for more
about self-directed investments.) The PPA has made significant changes to
what these statements must provide. It’s still not certain exactly what will be
required in the benefit statement, and the rules won’t be out before August
17, 2007 (after the writing of this book), but expect more detailed benefit
information on:
 Vesting (see Chapter 7)
 Account-related information regarding rates of return and investments
 An explanation of the limitations or restrictions on directing invest-
ments for those plans that permit participant direction
 An explanation of the importance of a well-balanced and diversified
portfolio
 A statement of the risk of holding more than 20 percent in the securities
of one company
 A cautionary instruction to take into account all your assets, including
savings outside the plan, in deciding how to invest
 A suggestion to periodically review your investment portfolio and objec-
tives and options under the plan
Before you finally retire and claim your pension distribution, you certainly
want to request your latest individual benefit statement so that you can do
the following:
124
Part II: Making Sure That You Receive the Pension You Earned 

 Confirm that you’re entitled to receive benefits at the point you decide
to retire (if it’s in advance of your normal retirement age)
 Find out the bottom line on what you can expect to receive either
through an annuity over the course of your lifetime or through a lump
sum payment
Chapter 9 has the full scoop on pension distributions.
Other documents under which the plan operates
In addition to the SPD, SAR, and SMM, other documents are important to
track down. These documents include the complete plan document, any col-
lective bargaining agreements, and trust agreements.
For instance, even though the SPD provides a summary of the entire plan
document, you still should request the complete plan document. In other
words, to be safe, you shouldn’t rely only on summaries of the plan; take the
time to read the whole plan. There have been instances where the SPD and
the plan document are in disagreement or inadvertently contradict each
other. The complete plan document is where you can find just about anything
you need to know about your plan.
A collective bargaining agreement is a pension plan that’s created through
employer and employee negotiations and that contains all the terms of the
pension (as does a plan created through a trust agreement).
This information is made available to you free of charge for your inspection
upon written request, or it can be duplicated for you for a reasonable copy-
ing fee.
Disclosure notice in underfunded plans
Pension plans that aren’t fully funded must notify their participants of this
fact. The PPA modified the levels at which this notice is required, but you still
must be notified if the plan isn’t 90 percent funded. Many exceptions and
qualifications to this rule exist, but if you get a notice, you’ll find out at what
percentage your plan is underfunded. The PBGC must be notified if the plan
is less than 80 percent fully funded. (See Chapter 12 for more information
about underfunded plans.)
Troubleshooting when you don’t get what you need
If your employer hasn’t provided you with a copy of the SPD, SAR, the annual
report, or any other previously discussed document that you may have
requested informally, you should formally request that your plan administra-
tor provide you with a copy. Make all requests for plan documents in writing,
and send your letter by certified mail. Clearly describe the items that you’re
looking for, and be sure to use your best business manners! The items you’re
125
Chapter 8: Planning for Retirement While You’re Still Working

requesting include a copy of the plan document and all amendments, the SPD
(including revisions) and the SMM, your individual benefit statement, and
copies of all communications between you and the plan. (Figure 8-1 shows a
sample request letter.) By law, your plan administrator has 30 days to provide
you these documents.
Here are some tips for maintaining records of your contact with a plan 
administrator:
 If you receive a verbal response to a verbal question, keep a written
record of the question and answer (and take names!). Confirm in writing
to the plan administrator the answer that was given to you. The idea is
to eliminate the possibility that along the way someone will deny that he
or she told you something.
 All communications with the plan administrator or other staff members
that affect your rights, including your request for documents (refer to
Figure 8-1) need to be sent via certified mail, return receipt requested.
This move is a safety precaution; if the plan says that it never received 
a request or a critical document, you’ll have proof that it was received,
along with the date it was received and the name of the person who
signed for the letter.

Part II: Making Sure That You Receive the Pension You Earned 

If you’re unable to obtain a copy of the pension documents to which you’re
entitled, you may be able to get a copy (for a nominal copying charge) by
writing to the U.S. Department of Labor at this address:
U.S. Department of Labor
Employee Benefits Security Administration
EBSA Public Disclosure Room
200 Constitution Avenue, NW, Room N-1513
Washington, DC 20210
Be sure to provide your name, address, and phone number so that the
Employee Benefits Security Administration can contact you to follow up on
your request. To help locate your plan documents, you should include as
much information about the plan as possible, including the name of the plan
and the city and state where it’s located.
Of course, because it’s the law, you would expect that there will be no problem
after you make a request for documents. The reality is quite different, though.
There may be situations when the plan inadvertently fails to honor your
request, and there may be instances when the plan intentionally fails to pro-
vide requested documents, fearing litigation. The law provides for a penalty of
$110 per day for failure to provide these documents in a timely manner. This is
easier said than done, though, because if you want to compel the plan to pro-
vide you the documents and pay the penalty, you need to file a court case (see
Chapter 20 for the basics of pension litigation).
Your personal information
To confirm the information that your employer has on file for you, you
should gather your personal information, such as your birth date and
employment dates. This information is important because if, for example, the
employer uses the wrong birth date in its calculation of the benefits that
you’re supposed to receive or if the wrong hire date is used and you aren’t
credited with enough years of service, your personal files can substantiate
the correct information.
Here’s the list of personal documents and information you need to dig out of
your lock box:
 Your birth certificate
 Your spouse’s birth certificate
 Documents reflecting your original date of hire with your employer, such
as letters welcoming you to the company or your first pay stub
127
Chapter 8: Planning for Retirement While You’re Still Working

 Documents reflecting any subsequent dates of hire
 Papers showing any and all termination dates with all your employers
 Records confirming that you worked at least 1,000 hours each year
 Memos or letters from your company, union, or bank that relate to your
pension plan (these may prove valuable in protecting your pension ben-
efit rights)
These personal items, in conjunction with the various official pension docu-
ments referenced in the previous section, tell you what you can expect to
receive from your plan benefits and help in determining whether your bene-
fits have been correctly calculated and legally applied.
Other helpful facts to have on hand
In this section, we put together a checklist of additional important information
about your pension plan and your benefits that you should keep current. You
can find most, if not all, of this information in your plan documents (which we
cover earlier in this chapter). As you begin to collect this information through-
out your working life, make note of it and then stash it away in a file folder so
you aren’t scrambling to retrieve it all when you reach retirement.
Here’s the list of information that we suggest collecting and continually
updating:
 The name of your pension plan
 The plan’s Employer Identification Number (EIN)
 The plan’s Plan Number (PN)
 The name of the plan administrator
 How you can contact the plan administrator
 The date you’ll be vested in the plan
 The date you’re entitled to take early retirement under the plan
 The normal retirement age at which you can retire with full benefits
 The date you’ll reach normal retirement age
 Whether your plan allows you to receive your benefits in a lump sum or
as an annuity in monthly installments for life
128
Part II: Making Sure That You Receive the Pension You Earned 

You must know this information to take advantage of early retirement bene-
fits or a lump-sum distribution if your plan allows them (see Chapter 9 for
general distribution information). It’s always better to depend on yourself to
maintain your own information than to rely on a pension plan that may count
you as one of thousands of participants.
Painting a Complete Picture 
of Your Retirement Income
After you’ve had a chance to collect and review the information in the previ-
ous sections, you’ll have a much better idea of how your plan benefits can
help support you, along with your other assets, during retirement. We walk
you through the process of putting it all together in the following sections.
Combining your estimated retirement 
costs and your pension benefits
To start completing your full retirement picture, estimate how much money
you need to save for your retirement, as we show you how to do earlier in this
chapter, and examine your existing financial resources (such as your savings
and any forms of income other than your wages). You can add to that amount
your anticipated pension benefits; you receive this information in your individ-
ual benefit statement, which provides you with your total accrued and vested
benefits (see Chapter 7 for more about vesting). The individual benefit state-
ment, which we cover earlier in this chapter, is the best snapshot of what you
can expect to receive if you retire as of a particular date.
Next, estimate your expenses in retirement. Don’t forget about things like
taxes, health insurance, and money to save in case of emergency.
If your future income will comfortably support you in retirement, congratula-
tions! Keep saving for retirement just as you’ve been doing. If your expenses
will outstrip your income, though, consider retiring at a later date or return-
ing to work if you’ve already retired. Try our guidelines for saving more
money to supplement your pension benefits in the following section. And we
know you don’t want to hear it, but you need to reduce your expenses in tune
with the reduction in available spending money that you’ll have in retirement.
Unlike the U.S. government, you can’t float a bond or spend for years with
money you don’t have.
129
Chapter 8: Planning for Retirement While You’re Still Working

Most folks don’t feel comfortable doing such major calculations on their own,
so it’s best to consult a financial professional to help you put all your infor-
mation together. We show you how to find a money guru later in this chapter.
Socking away money to supplement 
your pension benefits
In order to save for retirement, or better yet, to spend for retirement, spend
less than you earn! (Easier said than done, we know.) So how do you reach
the goal of building a retirement nest egg if you’re living paycheck to pay-
check? It’s tough, but it’s possible if you think of retirement as something you
have to buy. Create a budget, taking into consideration your monthly income
and expenses. Your retirement should be one of your main expenses at the
top of the list.
But what if your expenses exceed your income? Should you cut back on your
retirement expense? Hardly! Remember, your retirement is the number one
expense on your list, and it’s nonnegotiable. Consider your other options,
such as cutting back on your other expenses, increasing your income, or
both. Here are some suggestions:
 Pay yourself first. Have money automatically withdrawn from your
checking account every month to go toward retirement savings.
 Avoid bad debt that doesn’t provide a financial payoff. For example,
borrowing money to take vacations or eat out would be considered bad
debt. On the other hand, borrowing money to pay for your child’s educa-
tion or to advance your own skills leads to long-term financial benefits.
 Avoid loans with high interest rates. Always look before you leap; know
what the loan terms are and comparison shop.
 Comparison shop to help cut expenses. When you buy a new car and go
from dealership to dealership to get the best price, you’re comparison
shopping. You can shop this way for things such as insurance or other
big-ticket items.
 Take a second job or improve your skills and education to increase
your current income. If getting another job or going back to school isn’t
an option, suggest that your teenager get a job (if he or she doesn’t
already have one). Having a job not only teaches teens valuable money
lessons at an early age, but also gives them extra spending money that
they won’t hit you up for. All that money that was going toward clothes,
movies, and CDs can now be put away for savings.
130
Part II: Making Sure That You Receive the Pension You Earned 

The number one rule, no matter what, is to start saving as early as you can
and as much as you can. Make your money work for you as soon as possible!
Seeking out professional financial advice
Your funds have to last as long as you do. So unless you’re planning on manag-
ing your own money (which can be difficult), you need to seek out professional
advice. A good broker or money manager is an invaluable aid to a successful
retirement, but a bad one can mean disaster. Here are just a few suggestions to
help you tell the difference between a successful professional and a poor one:
 Watch out for promises of extravagant returns with little or no risk. If it
sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
 There’s no such thing as an investment with no fees — they’re there
even if you can’t find them.
 Beware of free lunches and dinners where the pitch for insurance prod-
ucts or expensive annuities will cost you a lot more than a steak dinner.
 Don’t be impressed with fancy-colored charts showing impressive
returns. In other words, just because a financial professional is good
with spreadsheet programs doesn’t mean that he’s an expert when it
comes to finances. And if that doesn’t convince you, remember the old
adage that goes like this: “Figures don’t lie, but liars can figure.”
 Separate the salesmen from the advisors. Use this book to find out if
your future financial guru knows anything about pensions or just wants
to make a sale. In fact, take the book with you; information is the pen-
sioner’s friend. But do rely on the advice of your respected professional
as it relates to your case in particular.
Any financial advisors worth their salt should at least make an informed
inquiry as to whether your pension is accurate before rushing to invest
your funds.
 Don’t be afraid to negotiate the fees you’ll be paying. Preserving your
assets is in your best interest; high fees aren’t. Fees for money mangers
are generally in the range of 1 percent of the total assets under manage-
ment, but they can also be as high as 3 percent or as low as 0.5 percent.
 You shouldn’t be expected to pay a fee on fixed assets, such as money
market accounts or bonds that you expect to hold until maturity. You
don’t need to pay someone to look at your money.
 Don’t confuse free tickets to your money manager’s luxury suite at the
ballgame with good advice and sound performance in your portfolio. Put
more simply — don’t allow yourself to be bribed into accepting shoddy
performance.
131
Chapter 8: Planning for Retirement While You’re Still Working

Good financial advisors look and dress alike. The worst advisors may sound
the best. Use trusted friends who’ve had good steady results for years to
make recommendations. Pay no attention to the friend who got a hot tip —
even if he quadrupled his money overnight.
There’s no one place you can go to find the right financial advisor for you.
There is, however, somewhere you can go to find a financial advisor you
don’t want: the Securities and Exchange Commission. This government
agency licenses brokers and maintains a Web site where you can find enforce-
ment actions that have been taken against financial advisors based on mis-
conduct. Go to www.sec.gov/litigation.shtml to find out who to stay
away from and perhaps pick up a tip or two about the tricks of the trade
employed by unscrupulous brokers.

Understanding the Rules 
of Pension Distributions
In This Chapter
 Deciding when to take your pension
 Seeing the differences between annuities and lump sums
 Making a claim for your distribution
O
ne of the most important issues with respect to your retirement plan is
knowing when and how to receive a distribution of your benefits. But be
prepared, because the rules are tricky and confusing. In fact, figuring out how
to receive a distribution from your plan is akin to rocket science. But have no
fear: We’re here to give you the basic rules of distributions in this chapter. 
We explain the different times when you can take a distribution from your
tax-qualified plan and from your individual retirement account (IRA; see
Chapter 5 for an IRA introduction) along with their tax consequences, and we
also go over the differences between your two payment options: annuities
and lump sums. Finally, we get you going on the actual claim process.
Knowing When You Can 
Take Your Distribution
Timing is everything (as they say), so before you make your claim for bene-
fits, you need to understand the basic rules regarding when you can make
your claim. The following sections outline the major categories: distributions
at regular retirement age, early distributions, distributions at age 701⁄2, and
distributions after your death.

Here are a few general rules to remember up front:
 Your distribution always comes from the vested amount in your pension
plan. (Chapter 7 has full details on vesting.)
 With a few exceptions, all distributions are subject to federal and state
income tax whether they’re in annuity or lump sum form (we cover
these options later in this chapter). Here are the exceptions:
• Roth IRA distributions (see Chapter 5) and Roth 401(k) distribu-
tions (see Chapter 4), which are generally distributed tax-free
• Distributions of after-tax contributions to IRAs and qualified plans,
on which only the earnings are taxable
 If you receive a distribution from a retirement plan or an IRA prior to age
591⁄2, the distribution is subject to an additional 10 percent tax unless it
fits into one of the exceptions (which we talk about later).
 Distributions generally must start by the time you reach age 701⁄2; other-
wise excise taxes may apply. The excise tax is 50 percent of the required
distribution at age 701⁄2 and thereafter.
All is well: Taking your distribution 
at regular retirement age
Even though the exact timing of retirement plan distributions is controlled 
by your plan, the Internal Revenue Code requires that pension distributions
be made available to participants by a certain date. For instance, under the
code, you’re eligible for a distribution no later than the 60th day after the
close of the plan year (the 12-month period under which the plan operates) 
in which the latest of the following occur:
 The date that you reach the earlier of age 65 or the normal retirement
age in your plan (check your summary plan description, or SPD, to see
what age your plan requires; see Chapter 8 for more about this and
other plan documents)
 The tenth anniversary of the year that you started your participation in
the plan (for example, if you start in the plan at age 58 and the plan’s
normal retirement age is 65, your tenth anniversary in the plan is at 
age 68, which is later than the normal retirement age)
 The date that you terminate your service with the employer
134
Part II: Making Sure That You Receive the Pension You Earned 

If you terminate your employment and your pension benefits exceed $5,000,
the plan can’t force you to receive a distribution of your plan benefits before
the later of either age 62 or the normal retirement age under your plan. If
your benefits are less than $5,000, however, the plan can force you to take an
early distribution of your benefits as a lump sum when you terminate your
employment. (We cover mandatory distributions later in this chapter.)
Tough times: Taking an early distribution
Most folks don’t need to take their distribution until they’re ready for retire-
ment, but sometimes people need to take an early distribution for whatever
reason. In the following sections, we cover two types of early distributions —
voluntary and mandatory — and the exceptions to additional taxing on such
early distributions.
Voluntary distributions
You may be able to take voluntary pension distributions even while you’re
still working. Here are some voluntary distribution rules for the most popular
types of pension plans:
 Defined benefit and defined contribution plans: For plan years begin-
ning after December 31, 2006, pension plans can, if they choose, provide
in-service distributions to participants who are age 62 or older. (An in-
service distribution is a fancy way to say “a distribution while you’re still
working.”) This change was made under the Pension Protection Act of
2006 (PPA) to permit phased retirement, in which individuals may choose
to continue to work and receive a portion of their pension benefits at the
same time.
If your pension plan has a normal retirement age prior to age 62, the
plan can permit distributions when you reach your normal retirement
age. However, most pension plans don’t permit in-service distributions
before age 701⁄2 (we discuss required distributions later in this chapter).
 Profit-sharing plans: If you’re in a profit-sharing plan that allows for in-ser-
vice distributions, amounts that have been in the account for at least two
years may be distributed before retirement or before separation from ser-
vice. (Check out Chapter 3 for a description of profit-sharing plans.)
 401(k) plans: You can take distributions from a 401(k) plan during
employment only if you’ve reached age 591⁄2 or if the distribution satis-
fies all the following requirements for hardship distributions:
• The distribution qualifies as a hardship, which is described by
Internal Revenue Service regulations as immediate and heavy
financial needs for which you don’t otherwise have the resources.
135
Chapter 9: Understanding the Rules of Pension Distributions

• The hardship withdrawal doesn’t exceed the principal portion of
your elective deferrals to the plan.
• The plan doesn’t allow you to make elective deferrals to the 401(k)
plan for six months after receiving the hardship distribution.
See Chapter 4 for general information about 401(k) plans.
In some instances, it may be necessary to get the consent of your spouse
before you can take an early distribution. Spousal consent is required for all
defined benefit plans and for profit-sharing and 401(k) plans containing annuity
forms of benefit. (We discuss annuities in more detail later in this chapter.)
Mandatory distributions
A mandatory distribution is a distribution made to a participant, without the
participant’s consent, before he or she reaches the later of either age 62 or
the normal retirement age under his or her plan.
Your plan may provide for a mandatory distribution of your pension, but only
if the present value of the total vested benefit doesn’t exceed $5,000. In other
words, if your account balance under the plan is less than $5,000 and you ter-
minate employment, the plan can distribute your plan benefits to you even if
you would prefer to leave them in the plan.
Mandatory distributions of more than $1,000 from a qualified retirement plan
to a plan participant (but not to a surviving spouse or alternate payee) must
automatically be rolled over into an IRA unless you elect to have the distribu-
tion rolled over to another retirement plan or to take it in cash. These auto-
matic rollover rules became effective March 28, 2005. (We provide general
rollover information later in this chapter.) Any mandatory distributions that
aren’t rolled over to an IRA or to another retirement plan are taxable.
Automatic rollover rules apply only to mandatory distributions. These rules
don’t apply to eligible rollover distributions made to a surviving spouse or a
former spouse, nor do they apply to mandatory distributions made to a par-
ticipant who’s reached the later of either age 62 or the normal retirement age
under the plan.
Your plan administrator must notify you in writing that your distribution may
automatically be rolled over into an IRA 30 to 180 days before the distribu-
tion. After receiving that notice, if you fail to elect either a direct rollover to
another qualified plan or a cash payment, the plan administrator may com-
plete the necessary documents to establish an IRA on your behalf and to
select a financial institution.
136
Part II: Making Sure That You Receive the Pension You Earned 

Information about the automatic rollover procedures must be provided in
your plan’s SPD or in a summary of material modifications (SMM). The infor-
mation must
 Describe the investment product
 Indicate how fees and expenses will be allocated within the IRA
 Identify the distributing plan and the plan sponsor
 Identify a plan contact
Many employers have amended their retirement plans to eliminate the provi-
sion that requires the plan to make mandatory single-sum distributions to
participants, or they’ve reduced the amount of the mandatory cash-out to
$1,000 in order to avoid the application of the automatic rollover rules to
their plans (because the automatic rollovers apply only to mandatory distrib-
utions greater than $1,000). Check your plan’s SPD to see whether the manda-
tory distribution rules apply.
Exceptions to additional taxing
Most distributions from qualified retirement plans are subject to an addi-
tional 10 percent tax if they’re made before you reach 591⁄2 and if they aren’t
rolled over to another qualified plan or IRA. (We discuss rollovers later in this
chapter.) The additional 10 percent tax on early distributions is payable at
the same time that regular income taxes are due.
However, some exceptions allow you to avoid the 10 percent additional tax
on early distributions. The most common exceptions include the following:
 Distributions that are paid as monthly, quarterly, or annual payments
over your life expectancy or the joint lives of you and your beneficiary
(which is typically your spouse). Note, however, that this exception
doesn’t apply unless you have separated from service.
After you begin receiving distributions under this exception, the pay-
ments must continue for five years or until you become 591⁄2 years old
(whichever is later). Otherwise, the additional 10 percent tax will apply
to all the payments that you’ve received.
 Separation from service with the employer that’s sponsoring the plan
after you reach age 55. This exception, which doesn’t apply to IRA distri-
butions, can also apply to self-employed individuals.
 Distributions that are used to pay deductible medical expenses. This
exception applies only to the extent that the amounts distributed would
be allowable as a deduction (whether or not you itemize your deduc-
tions and without regard to other limitations on such deductions).
137
Chapter 9: Understanding the Rules of Pension Distributions

 Distributions attributable to a disability that’s a physical or mental
impairment that can be expected to result in death or be of a long and
indefinite duration.
 Distributions to unemployed individuals to pay health insurance premi-
ums. This exception applies to IRAs only.
 Distributions for qualified higher education expenses furnished to you
(the taxpayer), your spouse, your child, or your grandchild. This excep-
tion applies to IRAs only.
 Distributions for qualified first-time home buyers. This exemption is sub-
ject to a $10,000 lifetime limitation and applies to IRAs only.
 Payments that are made to an ex-spouse or other alternate payee under
a qualified domestic relations order (QDRO); see Chapter 15 for more
info on QDROs.
 Distributions made on account of an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) levy
on your IRA or tax-qualified retirement plan.
 Being a reservist and being called to duty for more than 179 days
between the dates of September 11, 2001, and December 31, 2007. The
PPA provides this exemption. According to the PPA, you can even con-
tribute the amount you took out of your pension by the later of August
17, 2008, or two years after the last day of active service.
 Being a state or local firefighter, an emergency medical person, or a
police officer. These folks can avoid the 10 percent penalty when leaving
employment as long as they’re at least 50 years old.
Better do it: Taking your distribution 
when you’re 701⁄2
If you’ve reached age 701⁄2, you must begin taking at least a portion of your
pension benefits. (This distribution is referred to as a required minimum dis-
tribution.) The distribution for the year during which you reach age 701⁄2 may
be deferred until April 1 of the following year. However, the distribution for 
all subsequent years must be made by December 31. The minimum amount
that must be distributed in any year can be made in a series of installments
(versus one large distribution) as long as the total minimum payment is made
by the end of the year. Your plan can distribute more than the minimum in a
year, but you won’t receive credit for the additional amount in any subse-
quent year. And if you have funds in multiple retirement plans, you’re
required to receive minimum distributions from each one.
138
Part II: Making Sure That You Receive the Pension You Earned 

Your benefits may be delayed beyond age 701⁄2 to the date of your actual retire-
ment from the plan sponsor as long as you don’t own more than 5 percent of
the company that’s sponsoring the retirement plan. If you decide to delay the
distribution further, your required minimum distribution begins by April 1 of
the year following your retirement. If you’re a participant in a defined benefit
pension plan and delay your distributions beyond age 701⁄2 until the date you
actually retire, your accrued benefit must be actuarially increased to reflect the
value of the benefits that you would have received if your benefits had started
at age 701⁄2. For example, if you should have received $1,000 per month begin-
ning at age 701⁄2 and you instead deferred the payments until your actual retire-
ment at age 73, the $1,000 per month you would have received at age 701⁄2 will
be increased to reflect your now shorter life expectancy.
If you fail to take your required minimum distribution in the proper year,
you’re subject to an excise tax of 50 percent (yes, 50 percent!) of the required
minimum distribution that you should’ve taken.
You aren’t required to receive a distribution from each IRA that you own.
You’re permitted to add the totals from all your IRAs to calculate the required
minimum distributions and take the distributions from just one IRA if you
choose to. Required minimum distribution rules don’t apply to distributions
from a Roth IRA but do, however, apply to distributions from a Roth 401(k).
The goal is to spread out your pension over your life expectancy and over
your beneficiary’s life expectancy, based on the total amount of your bene-
fits. Depending on your ages and life expectancies, the amount of your distri-
bution changes. And as your ages change, your life expectancies do as well,
so the IRS has created tables to keep track of this information. You can see
these tables — the Uniform Distribution Table, the Single Life Table, and the
Joint and Last Survivor Table — in Appendix B.
Life expectancy is simply how long the tables say you can be expected to live.
The numbers in the tables aren’t arbitrary, by the way; they’re based on data
that’s crunched by actuaries. These tables are relied on for just this purpose.
These life expectancy tables, which contain quite a bit of information, are
used to predict how long you and/or your beneficiary will live and how your
ages will directly affect your distribution period. Each of these tables is used
for a different set of people. For example:
 The Uniform Distribution Table is used only by plan participants.
 The Single Life Table is used only by beneficiaries. (This table comes
into play only after your death; we cover distributions after death later
in this chapter.)
 The Joint and Last Survivor Table is used only by participants who have
a spouse more than ten years younger than the participant.
139
Chapter 9: Understanding the Rules of Pension Distributions

Using the Uniform Distribution Table
If you’ve reached age 701⁄2 and want to figure out your required minimum dis-
tribution, follow these steps:
1. Determine your plan account balance on December 31 of the prior
year.
2. Determine the life expectancy factor from the Uniform Distribution
Table based on your age on your birthday in the current year.
This factor is based on your birthday in the year for which the distribu-
tion is required. For example, if you turned age 70 in the year that you
reached age 701⁄2, the factor used is based on age 70. If you turned 71 in
the year that you reached age 701⁄2, the factor used is based on age 71.
3. Divide the balance in your plan account on December 31 of the 
year prior to the distribution by the life expectancy factor from the
Uniform Distribution Table to determine your required minimum 
distribution.
For example, assume that your account balance at the end of the prior
year was $400,000, and you turned age 70 in the year that you reached
age 701⁄2. The factor in the Uniform Distribution Table for age 70 is 27.4.
Your minimum distribution for the year is $400,000 divided by 27.4, or
$14,599.
For a defined contribution plan, the annual required minimum distribution
must equal at least the amount obtained by dividing your account balance on
December 31 of the prior year by the factor from the Uniform Distribution
Table for your age for the year of the distribution. For example, if your 75th
birthday is in 2010, your minimum distribution for 2010 is your account bal-
ance on December 31, 2009, divided by the factor from the Uniform
Distribution Table for age 75 (which is 22.9).
Using the Joint and Last Survivor Table
The distribution periods under the Uniform Distribution Table are based on a
participant with a beneficiary who’s ten years younger than the participant.
So, the minimum distribution period at age 70 is based on the calculation for
a 70-year-old with a 60-year-old beneficiary. Similarly, the distribution for an
85-year-old is based on the 85-year-old with a 75-year-old beneficiary.
However, if your sole beneficiary is your spouse who’s more than ten years
younger than you, you can base minimum distributions on the Joint and Last
Survivor Table. This table produces a distribution period that’s even longer
than the ten-year spread contained in the Uniform Distribution Table.
140
Part II: Making Sure That You Receive the Pension You Earned 

The determination of whether you use the Uniform Distribution Table or 
the Joint and Last Survivor Table is made annually. So, if your spouse dies
before you or the two of you get divorced, you go back to using the Uniform
Distribution Table. Similarly, if you marry a much younger spouse after your
required distribution date, you can switch, the next year, from the Uniform
Distribution Table to the Joint and Last Survivor Table.
Benefiting your loved ones: Distributions
after your death
The required minimum distributions after your death are based on the life
expectancies of the designated beneficiaries who inherit your benefits. (We
cover required minimum distributions in the earlier section “Better do it:
Taking your distribution when you’re 701⁄2.”) If you complete the designated
beneficiary form provided by your company and therefore choose a particu-
lar person as your beneficiary, he or she is considered your designated benefi-
ciary. If you don’t complete the form and don’t identify your beneficiary, the
plan kicks in and designates a beneficiary for you — usually your spouse, if
you have one.
If the beneficiary you select isn’t a person (for example, you leave your pen-
sion to a college), you’re deemed to have no designated beneficiary. Your
benefits will still be paid to the college, but the time period over which the
distribution can be made will be shorter than if you had named a person as
your beneficiary.
Your beneficiary selections are fixed at the time of your death, so new benefi-
ciaries can’t be designated after you die. It is possible, however, for some
beneficiaries to disclaim their benefits in favor of other beneficiaries who
were already named by you. For example, if your primary beneficiary is your
spouse and your secondary beneficiary is your daughter, your spouse can
disclaim her benefits and your daughter will become your primary benefi-
ciary. Your surviving spouse, however, can’t disclaim benefits in favor of
someone whom you had not named as a beneficiary before your death.
In the following sections, we explain how to use the Single Life Table shown
in Appendix B, which determines distribution periods for beneficiaries. We
also outline some special rules for distributions, depending on your age when
you die. For full details on the benefits that go to beneficiaries after your
death, see Chapter 14.
Using the Single Life Table
If your surviving spouse is your beneficiary, the applicable period for the dis-
tributions is her life expectancy. Your spouse’s life expectancy is recalculated
annually while she’s alive, but it becomes fixed upon death for a specific term
141
Chapter 9: Understanding the Rules of Pension Distributions

based on her age on her birthday in the year of her death. After your spouse’s
death, any remaining benefits must be paid to her beneficiaries over the
remaining fixed-term life expectancy based on the Single Life Table. The bal-
ance of the beneficiary’s account on December 31 of the prior year is divided
by the life expectancy factor for the current year to determine the required
minimum distribution for that year.
Here’s an example: If your spouse is age 60 in the year following the year of
your death, her life expectancy under the Single Life Table is 25.2 years. The
required minimum distribution is the account balance at the end of the prior
year divided by 25.2. The required minimum distribution for each subsequent
year is based on the account balance for December 31 of the prior year divided
by the life expectancy from the Single Life Table for each such year. If your
spouse dies at age 76 before all of your pension benefits have been distrib-
uted, her beneficiaries must receive distributions based on the 12.7-year life
expectancy for a 76-year-old under the Single Life Table. For each subsequent
year, the factor will be reduced by one. In other words, the next year’s life
expectancy would be 11.7, the year after that would be 10.7, and so on down
the line.
Instead of receiving a minimum distribution, your spouse may also roll over
the benefits to an IRA or to another qualified plan. We cover rollovers later in
this chapter.
If your individual beneficiary is someone other than a spouse, the applicable
distribution period is his life expectancy. The minimum required distribu-
tions are based on the fixed-term life expectancy of your beneficiary based
on his age in the year following the year of your death.
Here’s an example for when your beneficiary is someone other than a spouse:
If your beneficiary is age 60 in the year following the year of your death, his
life expectancy under the Single Life Table is 25.2 years, a fixed period that’s
reduced by one for each subsequent year in order to determine the minimum
distribution required for that year. In other words, the life expectancy of the
year after the 25.2-year fixed period will be 24.2, the year after that will be
23.2, and so on into the future. As with spousal beneficiaries, the required
minimum distribution for a given year is the account balance on December 31
of the prior year divided by the proper life expectancy factor.
Effective for distributions after December 31, 2006, the PPA provides that
benefits of a non-spouse beneficiary may be rolled over to an IRA. The IRA is
treated as an inherited IRA of the non-spouse beneficiary. Distributions from
the IRA must be paid over a period that doesn’t exceed the life expectancy of
the beneficiary and must commence no later than December 31 of the year
following the death of the participant. The benefits must be rolled over to an
IRA for your non-spouse beneficiary by December 31 of the year following the
year of your death.
142
Part II: Making Sure That You Receive the Pension You Earned 

Death before age 701⁄2
If you die before age 701⁄2, which is when you would have started receiving
your pension, the required minimum distribution from your retirement plan
generally must begin no later than December 31 of the year following the year
of your death. Here are some special rules on the distribution, depending on
who your beneficiary is:
 If your beneficiary isn’t a person or individual (for example, you desig-
nate a church or synagogue to receive your retirement benefits after you
die), you’re deemed to have no designated beneficiary (even though the
charity will still receive the money). In this case, your entire pension
account must be distributed no later than December 31 of the fifth year
following the year of your death (this is called the five-year rule). This
rule also applies if your retirement benefits are left to your estate.
 If your spouse is your beneficiary, he or she can delay the commence-
ment of retirement plan or IRA distributions until the year during which
you would have reached age 701⁄2 if you had lived.
 If a non-spouse is your sole individual beneficiary, he or she is required
to receive the distributions over a period not exceeding his or her life
expectancy.
 Multiple beneficiaries who are individuals and who haven’t established
separate accounts must receive the distributions over the oldest benefi-
ciary’s life expectancy. If the beneficiaries’ accounts are separate, the
required minimum distribution is based on the age of each beneficiary. 
If you have multiple beneficiaries and at least one of the beneficiaries
isn’t an individual, the entire account must be distributed under the 
five-year rule.
To avoid using the oldest beneficiary’s life expectancy, the various bene-
ficiaries must set up separate accounts with separate accounting for
profits and losses no later than December 31 of the year following your
death.
These are the minimum distribution requirements. Beneficiaries may elect to
receive distributions over a shorter period than their life expectancies.
Death after age 701⁄2
If you die after age 701⁄2, the required minimum distributions for the year fol-
lowing the year of your death are based on the applicable distribution period.
These rules are similar to the rules in the previous section for distributions
for death prior to age 701⁄2. However, the five-year rule and the special spousal
distribution rules described aren’t applicable.
143
Chapter 9: Understanding the Rules of Pension Distributions

Surveying Your Options for 
Distribution Payments
When you start receiving your pension distributions, you may be faced with
the choice between receiving your pension money as an annuity (which is a
regular stream of payments for as long as you or your beneficiary live) or as 
a single lump sum. In order to make a wise decision, your first task is to find
out whether the amount of money that you’ll receive in a lump sum is the
same as what you can expect to receive through an annuity that’s spread out
over your lifetime. After you’re sure that the annuity and the lump sum have
the same value and offer the same benefits, you have to consider the advan-
tages of each one.
Comparing the values of an 
annuity and a lump sum
The first and most important consideration in choosing between an annuity
and a lump sum is to make sure that both options have equivalent values. 
To make this determination, you must reduce the annuity to a lump sum by
making what’s called a present value calculation. A present value calculation 
is used to determine the value, in today’s dollars, of a sum of money to be
received in a future year, based on a specific interest rate. The higher the inter-
est rate used to convert your annuity to a lump sum, the lower the lump sum.
As an example of calculating present value, imagine that you won $1 million
in the lottery. A lottery winner is always given the choice of taking a single
payment today, which may be only $600,000, or receiving monthly payments
totaling $1 million spread out over ten years. In order to determine that the
million bucks has an actuarial equivalent (what it’s worth today) of $600,000,
a number cruncher will use interest rate tables to determine how much
money you’d need to receive in a lump sum today to equal $1 million if
spread out over ten years.
In determining the lump sum present value of your benefits under a defined
benefit plan, the plan’s actuary performs calculations similar to those per-
formed for a lottery winner who elects to receive a lump sum, except that the
pension plan also looks at a mortality table to take your life expectancy into
account in the calculation. (In a defined contribution plan, the lump sum
amount is your account balance, so complicated calculations aren’t needed.)
The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA; see Chapter 2)
has rules that determine the interest rates that plans must use to convert a
lump sum to an annuity. If these rules aren’t followed, the lump sum payment
could be much less than the annuity payments (which, of course, is a lawsuit
144
Part II: Making Sure That You Receive the Pension You Earned 

waiting to happen). Interest rates fluctuate and change, so check with your
tax advisor or accountant to verify that the proper interest rate was used by
your plan. If you do find that your plan used the wrong interest rate, contact
the plan and question whether the calculations are correct.
The PPA provides for a phase-in of higher interest rates from 2008 through
2012. This phase-in is important because as interest rates increase, the value of
the lump sum distribution decreases. So if you have the option of taking a lump
sum in 2008 or 2009 (rather than in 2012 or later), you may opt for the earlier
distribution because it’s likely that the interest rates will be higher in 2012.
Analyzing the advantages of annuities
What are the pros of accepting an annuity rather than a lump sum? Check out
these major advantages:
 You can’t outlive your annuity — it will keep paying you for life.
 You can provide a steady income for your surviving beneficiary.
145
Chapter 9: Understanding the Rules of Pension Distributions
Explaining early retirement subsidies
Defined benefit pension plans of large employ-
ers frequently provide for early retirement sub-
sidies that lessen the negative impact of
receiving distributions prior to the plan’s normal
retirement age. Without such subsidies, you
receive smaller monthly annuity benefits
because the lifetime annuity benefits are paid
over a larger period of time. Reductions for early
retirement benefits are often in the neighbor-
hood of 0.5 percent for each month (6 percent
per year) that you receive the benefits prior to
the plan’s normal retirement age. For example, if
the benefit is calculated at a normal retirement
age of 65, a benefit payable at age 62 may be
reduced by 18 percent (6 percent for each of
three years) from the age 65 benefit. For exam-
ple, if the age 65 benefit is $1,000 per month, the
age 62 benefit would be $820 per month.
A plan may provide early retirement subsidies to
employees who meet certain criteria. For exam-
ple, the plan may state that an employee with 
30 years of service can receive an unreduced
benefit at age 62. In the previous example, the
employee would receive an 18 percent early
retirement subsidy.
Here’s the tricky part. If you elect to receive a
lump sum benefit rather than an annuity, the
lump sum may be based on the benefit without
the subsidy. In other words, using the previous
example, if you take the annuity at age 62, you’ll
receive $1,000 per month (the benefit with the
subsidy). If, however, you elect to receive the
lump sum benefit, you may receive the equiva-
lent of $820 per month (the benefit without the
subsidy). In many cases, the value of the sub-
sidy isn’t required to be included in the calcula-
tion of the lump sum benefit.
So, if you have benefits with early retirement
subsidies, be sure that you have an accountant
or financial advisor carefully review the calcula-
tions to make sure that you’re comparing apples
to apples and receiving the correct benefit.

Another advantage is the fact that retirement plans usually offer several dif-
ferent annuity options, including the following:
 Straight life annuity: This type of annuity provides equal monthly pay-
ments for your life (and your life only). A straight life annuity provides
the maximum monthly payment because it’s based on one life with no
additional contingent benefits. An example of a straight life annuity pay-
ment is $1,000 per month.
 Qualified joint and 50 percent survivor annuity: This annuity provides
payments for your life, and then when you die, your surviving spouse
(or other beneficiary) receives payments equal to 50 percent of your
previous monthly payment. With this annuity, payments end when 
both you and your spouse (or other beneficiary) die. For example, you
would receive $800 per month for your life, and then your spouse would
receive $400 per month following your death. (We cover the basics of all
types of qualified joint and survivor annuities in Chapter 14.)
 Qualified joint and 75 percent survivor annuity: This annuity provides
payments for your life, and then when you die, your surviving spouse 
or beneficiary receives payments equal to 75 percent of your previous
monthly benefit. An example payment: $750 per month for your life and
$562.50 per month to your spouse following your death.
 Qualified joint and 100 percent survivor annuity: This annuity pro-
vides equal monthly payments to you with unreduced payments to your
spouse or beneficiary following your death. An example payment: $700
per month for your life and $700 per month to your spouse following
your death.
 Life and term certain annuity: This annuity provides equal payments
for your life with guaranteed payments for a specific period of time (for
example, 120 months or 180 months) to you or your beneficiary. In other
words, it provides payments through the later of either your life or the
term specified. An example: You receive $900 per month for your life
with 180 guaranteed monthly payments, which your beneficiary would
continue receiving if you died prior to the end of the 180-month period.
If you live beyond the 180-month period, you’ll continue to receive the
monthly payments guaranteed through the remainder of your life, but
there’ll be no payments remaining for your beneficiary.
In the event that both you and your beneficiary die before the 180-
month term certain, your beneficiary’s beneficiary will receive the 
payments — after all, they’ve been guaranteed for a minimum of 180
months.

Looking at the advantages of lump sums
The major advantage of a lump sum is obvious: You have the entire value of
your benefit at once, to do with as you see fit. This can be very good if you
invest it wisely or very bad if you spend it foolishly. It’s your choice! Consider
the additional advantages of lump sums:
 You can roll your lump sum into an IRA, where it will continue to grow
until you take a distribution from the IRA.
 An annuity ends when you (or you and your spouse) die, so if you think
you might die earlier than the average (for example, if you have a termi-
nal disease), you may be better off taking the lump sum.
 If you have other funds that you can live on during retirement, you can
use the lump sum to purchase a house or a condo or to plan an estate to
leave to your children.
Getting a Grip on Rollovers
A rollover is a term for when you move your money from one tax-deferred
place to another without paying taxes. But in order to roll over successfully,
you need to know whether the distribution that you receive from a qualified
plan is eligible for direct transfer to an IRA (or to a qualified plan, if you’re
still working), thereby avoiding tax consequences. We give you all the basics
you need in the following sections.
What are eligible rollover distributions?
The term eligible rollover distribution refers to any distribution that’s made to
you, an employee, of all (or any portion) of your balance in a qualified pen-
sion plan. However, the term doesn’t include the following:
 Distributions in the form of an annuity (which we cover earlier in this
chapter) or any distribution that’s one of a series of substantially equal
period payments (not less frequently than annually) made for your life
or the joint life expectancies of you and your designated beneficiary.
 Any minimum required distribution starting at age 701⁄2.
 Hardship distributions from your 401(k) elective deferrals or from your
403(b) elective deferrals.
147
Chapter 9: Understanding the Rules of Pension Distributions

If your distribution doesn’t fit into one of the categories previously listed, it’s
considered an eligible rollover distribution, which means that you may roll
over all or part of it into an IRA or a tax-qualified retirement plan. Any part
that you don’t roll over will be taxable to you when it’s distributed.
If property is involved during a rollover, you must roll over the actual prop-
erty or the proceeds from the sale of the property. You can’t retain the prop-
erty and roll over the fair market value of the distributed property. For
example, if your distribution from your employer’s plan is stock with a fair
market value of $25,000, you can roll over the stock directly to an IRA or you
can sell the stock and roll over the $25,000 proceeds from the sale of the
stock. But you can’t keep the stock and roll over $25,000 from your savings.
Who can roll over a distribution 
and when?
Your distribution must be either transferred directly to the IRA or other tax-
qualified plan (a direct rollover) or rolled over within 60 days after you
receive it — or after your surviving spouse or a former spouse, pursuant to a
QDRO (see Chapter 15), receives a distribution.
Effective for distributions after December 31, 2006, beneficiaries other than a
surviving spouse may roll over benefits into an IRA. However, such non-
spouse rollovers can be made only from plans that specifically permit such
rollovers. In this case, the IRA is treated as an inherited IRA of the non-
spouse beneficiary, and distributions from the IRA are subject to the distribu-
tion rules applicable to beneficiaries.
The IRS can waive the 60-day requirement for rollovers when a pensioner is
serving the military in a combat zone or when the president declares a disas-
ter. You can also receive a waiver of the 60-day rollover period if failure to
waive the requirement would be against equity or good conscience. For
example, if you transfer the rollover amount to a bank or a broker in a timely
manner, but the bank or broker mistakenly deposits the funds into a non-IRA
account, it would be unconscionable for the 60-day period not to be waived.
What are the tax consequences 
of rolling over?
If you want to roll over your benefits to an IRA or to another plan, it’s best to
have the funds transferred directly to the IRA or plan. Federal income tax is
withheld at a 20 percent rate on any eligible rollover distributions that aren’t
148
Part II: Making Sure That You Receive the Pension You Earned 

directly rolled over. So, what this means is that if the funds are distributed
directly to you (rather than directly rolled over), you’ll receive only 80 per-
cent of your benefits because 20 percent will be withheld for taxes. These
withholding requirements don’t apply to distributions from IRAs.
If after your death, your spouse rolls over your pension assets into his or her
own IRA, subsequent distributions from that IRA will be subject to the early
10 percent distribution tax if the surviving spouse is under age 591⁄2 at the
time of the distribution and isn’t eligible for any other exception. (We cover
this tax earlier in this chapter.)
What’s the rollover process?
Don’t worry: You don’t have to guess when it comes to rolling over your pen-
sion distribution. Your plan administrator is required to provide you with a
written explanation of the provisions. These provisions will likely state that:
 You can have your distribution directly transferred to an IRA or to
another eligible retirement plan.
 You must withhold tax on the distribution if it isn’t directly transferred
to an IRA or another eligible plan.
 The distribution won’t be subject to tax if it’s transferred to an IRA or
other eligible retirement plan within 60 days after the date on which you
receive the distribution.
The plan administrator must distribute the notice no fewer than 30 days and
no more than 180 days before making an eligible rollover distribution.
All you need to do to finish the rollover process is complete the appropriate
paperwork for both the plan you’re rolling out of and the plan or IRA that
you’re rolling the funds into.
Claiming Your Benefits
ERISA requires your plan to establish a written procedure that you and other
pensioners can follow when claiming your pension benefits and that the com-
pany can follow when providing you with your payments. Your SPD sets forth
all the procedures necessary to properly file your claim. You should familiar-
ize yourself with the requirements and assemble whatever documents are
necessary. If your plan has failed to establish a claims procedure, make the
claim for your benefits to the administrator of the plan.
149
Chapter 9: Understanding the Rules of Pension Distributions

All of your requests should be in writing, and it’s important that you keep a
copy of everything you submit for your records. It’s also a good idea to use
certified mail for your benefit application and other correspondence with the
plan so that you have proof that the documents were sent.
When you make a claim for your distribution, you also need to have a good
idea of what your benefits should be. By the time you’re ready to retire, you
should know what’s in your account balance, how it was calculated, how
much is vested (in other words, how much definitely belongs to you; see
Chapter 7 for more about vesting), and whether you’re entitled to any subsi-
dies or other special benefits. Chapter 17 has details on arming yourself with
information before retirement and spotting potential signs of trouble with
your distribution.
The plan has 90 days to tell you if your claim was approved. If your plan
needs more time to take a look at your claim, it can get an additional 90 days
as long as the following occur:
 The plan notifies you within the initial 90 days that more time is needed.
 The notice tells you why more time is needed and gives you the date
that the plan expects to make a decision.
If the 90- or 180-day time period has passed and you receive no notice, use
the plan’s rules for appealing a denial. The SPD describes the appeal proce-
dure if your claim is denied. (See Chapter 18 for more information on appeal-
ing your claim if it’s denied.)
150
Part II: Making Sure That You Receive the Pension You Earned 
What happens when you’re terminated 
and your plan loses track of you?
As surprising as it may seem, sometimes plans
lose track of their former employees who have
vested retirement benefits. Luckily, the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), the gov-
ernment agency whose main functions are to
take over failed pension plans and to guarantee
pension benefits, has a missing participants pro-
gram. It provides that if the plan administrator of
a terminating defined benefit or defined contri-
bution plan can’t locate a pension plan member
after a diligent search, the plan may satisfy the
distribution requirement by purchasing an annu-
ity from an insurer or by transferring the missing
participant’s benefit to the PBGC. Therefore, if
you can’t locate your former employer, or if the
plan has been terminated, you may be able to
contact the PBGC for your benefits.
Chapter 12 has more information about the
PBGC and terminated pension plans.

Part III
Guarding Your
Pension from Your
Employer

In this part . . .
Your company or plan can make many decisions that
impact your pension. So, in order to be prepared 
for possible changes instituted by your plan, you need 
to understand the plan’s basic rights, your basic rights,
and the steps you can take to protect your rights (and 
ultimately your pension).
In this part, we start with an overview of the responsibili-
ties of the plan’s fiduciaries to give you a framework of
what’s okay and what isn’t. From there we discuss the 
various changes that have the potential to impact your
plan and your retirement, and what you can do to best
guard your pension. These changes include the sale or
merger of your company and the amendment or termina-
tion of your pension plan. Also included are job changes
(voluntary or involuntary), which impact the pension 
benefits that you’ve earned up to that point.

Zeroing In on Fiduciaries
In This Chapter
 Figuring out exactly who is a fiduciary
 Understanding a fiduciary’s duties and restrictions
 Seeing how fiduciary liability has grown
 Taking charge when good fiduciaries go bad
You work hard and do a good job for your company. In return, that com-
pany provides you with a retirement plan so that when the time comes
to lay down the hammer or turn off your computer, there’s still food on the
table. If you have a defined benefit plan, the company has put money into
your retirement plan. If you have a defined contribution plan, you put the
money into the plan, and maybe your company did, too. Presumably this
money in the plan — yours and everybody else’s — didn’t go into a piggy
bank or get buried in a safety deposit box. Instead, it has been invested. This
chapter, then, is about the people who make the decisions about the invest-
ment of your money and who ultimately have a big say in the success of your
pension plan. These people are your fiduciaries.
A fiduciary is someone who’s entrusted to look after the affairs of a third
person and to act in that person’s best interest. A fiduciary can’t pass the
buck. In this chapter, we tell you what you need to know to be informed
about fiduciaries. In this case, what you don’t know can hurt you. Just
remember this: All the retirees in the Enron plan had fiduciaries. Some are
good and some are bad. All bear watching.
Generally speaking, any private employee benefit plan managed by either an
employer or an employee organization is subject to the protections of the
fiduciary rules set by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
(ERISA). These plans are regulated by ERISA, and their money experts are
provided specific guidance as to what they can and can’t do. (Whether these
experts pay attention to these rules is another story.) We focus on ERISA’s
fiduciary rules in this chapter.

Defining Who Is (and Isn’t) 
a Fiduciary under ERISA
The determination of whether someone is a fiduciary is important because 
a fiduciary is held to special standards of conduct. To find out how the law
defines a fiduciary, you have to look to ERISA, the law that regulates tax-
qualified pensions. But we’re guessing that reading through pages and pages
of legalese isn’t on your list of fun things to do. So in the following sections,
we save you some time by explaining who does and doesn’t qualify as a 
fiduciary.
Understanding who qualifies 
as a fiduciary
According to ERISA, the term fiduciary includes any person or entity (a fidu-
ciary can be a group of people) who:
 Exercises any discretionary authority or control with respect to a pen-
sion plan.
 Exercises any authority or control with respect to the management or
disposition of plan assets. This tells you that if somebody has the power
to decide how your money is invested, spent, or paid, she is a fiduciary.
154
Part III: Guarding Your Pension from Your Employer 
Ferraris, temptation, and fiduciaries: 
A combo that may cost you money
Fiduciaries running wild (and spending lots of
cash in the process) aren’t sexy, and they can
be a highly expensive problem to fix. Everyone
has heard of the Enron debacle, but in Ohio they
have their own story to tell. The investment
advisors of the Ohio Workers’ Compensation
Fund reportedly bought rare coins at inflated
prices and, as the story goes, other expensive
collectibles, such as autographs and even
Beanie Babies. Guardians of the funds sat by
and watched as an investment house lost hun-
dreds of millions of dollars that were set aside
for the injured workers of Ohio. Sure, people
went to jail, but the money is still gone.
The lesson is this: Know who your fiduciaries
are and pay attention to what they do and with
whom they do it. You may be the one paying for
the cherry-red Ferrari and the 90-foot yacht. For
some, access to large sums of money is an irre-
sistible temptation.

 Renders investment advice for a fee or some other compensation, or has
the responsibility to provide that advice. These people are fiduciaries —
even if they’re wearing a sign declaring that they aren’t.
 Has discretionary authority or the responsibility to administer the plan. In
other words, if this person has the power, she has the title of fiduciary.
In light of ERISA’s definition of a fiduciary, there are certain jobs involving your
pension plan that are so important that the people who do them are automati-
cally considered fiduciaries. For example, the following people carry this title:
 Plan trustees: These trustees are similar to a board of directors. They
oversee the plan administrator and set policy for the plan.
 Plan administrators: These staff members are in charge of the pension
plan and are considered chief executives of their respective funds.
 Members of the plan’s investment or administrative committee: These
people oversee investment decisions.
 Pension investment consultants: Pension investment consultants are
usually the outside hired gurus who advise the investment committee
on how the plan’s money should be invested.
 Broker-dealers: If these dealers are recommended by the pension con-
sultant and have the authority to make investment decisions for the
plan, they may be considered fiduciaries.
 Investment managers: These people are the consultants, individuals, or
committees that your plan designates to make investment decisions for
the plan’s assets.
 The hiring folks: The people or committees who have the responsibility
of choosing and hiring anyone who exercises discretion over the plan’s
funds are exercising the type of authority that makes them fiduciaries.
Other people can be fiduciaries as well, but we won’t list them all here. Just
remember that one of the important things to know is that some people are
fiduciaries for limited purposes only.
Recognizing who isn’t a fiduciary
Being a fiduciary doesn’t require consent. The test of who’s a fiduciary is 
a functional test based not only on the title, but also on the job. When you
have direct responsibility for someone else’s financial security, you are, and
should be, held to a higher standard, and you’re considered a fiduciary. Not
everybody involved with running a pension plan is a fiduciary, however,
because not everybody has the discretionary power that can wind up send-
ing you to the poorhouse.
155
Chapter 10: Zeroing In on Fiduciaries

The people who are doing what are considered “routine” or “ministerial jobs”
aren’t considered fiduciaries. For example, ministerial functions include the
following:
 Applying plan rules for plan benefits (for example, when an accountant
or a plan attorney uses and interprets the plan’s rules)
 Calculating benefits
 Preparing materials to communicate with employees
 Maintaining service records
 Preparing required reports
 Orienting new employees to their plan rights
 Collecting and allocating contributions to the plan
 Processing claims
Attorneys, actuaries, consultants, and other advisors generally aren’t consid-
ered fiduciaries unless — and this is an important unless — they’re invest-
ment advisors or they have authority or control over who is.
Surveying the Duties and Restrictions 
of a Fiduciary
The plan fiduciary has the power and discretion to exercise authority and
control on behalf of a third party. With that power, however, comes a limita-
tion: It can only be exercised on behalf of plan participants. Any time the
authority is exercised contrary to those interests, or when the fiduciary
places his own interests over and above those of the plan members, it’s con-
sidered a prohibited activity. In the following sections, we discuss what a
fiduciary can and can’t do.
Everything’s okay: Duties and 
permitted interactions
The important thing to remember about a fiduciary is that he’s supposed to
be concerned about you (the plan participant), and he isn’t allowed to act 
in his own best interest. And because he’s investing your money, he’s also
156
Part III: Guarding Your Pension from Your Employer 

supposed to be competent, thorough, and prudent. A fiduciary must do the
following:
 Act in the interest of plan members and beneficiaries.
 Act for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits and avoiding unrea-
sonable expenses in the administration of the plan.
 Act with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence expected of a person
with that responsibility.
 Diversify plan assets and minimize the risk of large losses unless it’s
clearly prudent not to diversify.
 Act in accordance with the plan documents except to the extent that the
document is inconsistent with ERISA itself.
To ensure that a fiduciary upholds these important obligations, his activities
in dealing with the pension plan are heavily restricted to avoid self-dealing
(see the following section). There are also restrictions on parties in interest,
which is a broader category than a fiduciary.
There are certain interactions, however, that are permitted between the fidu-
ciary and the plan. For example:
 The plan may deal with parties in interest to get office space and to hire
necessary legal or accounting services. A party in interest can be, for
example, a fiduciary, a provider of services to the plan, the plan’s attor-
ney, or the plan sponsor, who, because of his relationship with the plan,
is prohibited from entering into certain transactions. (See the later sec-
tion “Prohibited transactions for parties in interest” for more.)
 Certain insurance contracts can be entered into between the plan and
the employer/fiduciary.
 After December 31, 2006, a registered pension consultant (such as a
bank, an insurance company, an investment company, or a broker-dealer
that’s registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission) is per-
mitted to give financial advice to plan participants and recommend a
financial product that he sells. (See Chapter 6 for more information
about a fiduciary’s role in investment selection.)
Not gonna do it: Restricted activities
Because fiduciaries have control over your money and could benefit personally
if they choose to take advantage of the situation, many restrictions are placed
on their activities. We explain these restrictions in the following sections.
157
Chapter 10: Zeroing In on Fiduciaries

Prohibited transactions for fiduciaries
Because fiduciaries, like bankers, hold your money, the law applies special
restrictions on what they can do with it. But sometimes they disregard the
restrictions and do what they want anyway. These fiduciaries are ignoring the
fact that it doesn’t matter if the deal is ultimately fair and reasonable, with no
bad motives intended and no hint of scandal. Forbidden is forbidden. The
line is black and white, not gray, and the penalty for crossing this line is the
personal obligation to pay back all profits as well as losses. Here are several
examples of prohibited transactions for fiduciaries:
 A fiduciary isn’t allowed to invest the plan’s money, which includes your
money, in his own account or for his own benefit.
 The fiduciary can’t get involved in a transaction that’s against the inter-
ests of the plan or the participants of the plan.
 The fiduciary can’t get money or some other perk for his own account
from somebody who does business with the plan in connection with the
plan’s money.
Here’s an example of prohibited self-dealing by a fiduciary. Say your pension
plan hires Les Honest for investment advice. Les, who is now a fiduciary, rec-
ommends the firm of Sleazy, Greedy, and Sneaky to help the plan decide what
to buy and what to sell. What Les doesn’t mention to the plan is that he (Les)
is being paid by the Sleazy firm in exchange for the recommendation. Sounds
like Les isn’t so honest! Surprisingly, this goes on more than you might think.
Prohibited transactions for parties in interest
Some people are so intimately connected to a pension plan that they’re con-
sidered parties in interest. A party in interest includes fiduciaries, but all
those included as parties in interest may not be fiduciaries. The essential dif-
ference is that the fiduciary exercises discretion and control over the plan or
its assets, whereas a party in interest can unfairly influence the plan because
of his close relationship to the plan without the responsibility of a fiduciary.
The two concepts are closely related but not identical. All oranges are fruit,
but not all fruits are oranges. In the pension world, the fiduciary is the
orange, and the fruit is the party in interest.
The definition of party in interest is complicated and broad and covers a 
wide range of individuals, businesses, and other entities. A plan’s financial
advisor, for instance, is a fiduciary and is also considered to be a party in
interest because of his ability to influence plan decisions. Other parties in
interest include your employer and the plan’s attorneys, accountants, service
providers, actuaries, and other persons or entities that provide services to
the plan. All of these parties, while not considered fiduciaries, are prohibited
158
Part III: Guarding Your Pension from Your Employer 

from engaging in certain transactions with the plan because of their ability to
influence plan decisions. These prohibited transactions consist of everyday-
type activities if they involve your pension plan and include the following:
 Selling, exchanging, or leasing plan property (for example, the plan’s
attorney leasing to the plan the dilapidated building that he owns)
 Lending or borrowing money or getting an extension of credit from the
plan
 Furnishing or receiving goods or services to or from the plan (for exam-
ple, giving the uncle of the plan’s financial advisor the contract to pro-
vide copiers and fax machines to the plan’s office)
 Transferring or using for personal benefit any assets of the plan
Expanding the scope of fiduciary liability
Sometimes things happen that force everybody to take a fresh look at the cur-
rent situation. For example, in September 2003, a federal judge handling a suit
against Enron took the bull by the horns and expanded what a fiduciary could
be held accountable for. The court’s decision gave some concrete examples
that drew a clear line in the sand for fiduciaries who were thinking of conduct
in the fuzzy gray areas of what may or may not be permissible. Here’s a list of
the liabilities that a fiduciary may now be held accountable for:
 Liability for following imprudent directions: “I was just following
orders” is no longer an excuse. A directed trustee (a trustee following
directions) may be accused of breaching his fiduciary responsibility if
he knew or should have known that the directions were imprudent. So,
this means that the trustee still has a responsibility to find out if the
things he’s directed to do are in tune with ERISA’s fiduciary responsibil-
ity requirements.
Some courts have taken a hard line on this, but others have been a bit
more lenient unless the trustee actually was part of a plot. This is an
area of the law that’s still evolving.
 Liability for imposing a blackout: A blackout occurs when the fiduciary
puts a hold or restriction on your ability to make changes to your invest-
ments or to make choices regarding your pension funds. Blackouts
happen in instances when the plan is changing trustees or recordkeep-
ers. Plan administrators must provide a notice to the plan’s participants
and beneficiaries at least 30 days in advance of the blackout. This black-
out notice must describe the restrictions that are going to be imposed
and state how long the blackout period is expected to last. Liability can
159
Chapter 10: Zeroing In on Fiduciaries

be imposed, for instance, when the blackout isn’t lifted even though it
presents an extreme threat to your account balance. Ask the Enron pen-
sioners what blackouts did to their accounts.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 bars company directors and executive
officers from trading in employer securities during a blackout period. It
prohibits loans to company officers during this time period as well.
 Personal liability of the corporation’s board of directors: This liability
almost never happens, but it could. If the corporation you work for
serves as your plan’s financial decision maker, those officers and direc-
tors who provide financial advice to the plan may be held personally
liable as fiduciaries. For instance, if the board of directors doesn’t
clearly delegate authority to another financial advisor, the board is pre-
sumed to exercise such authority. So if the investment authority isn’t
specifically delegated, it may boomerang right back to the directors by
default.
 Liability of your employer’s auditor: Creative accounting has been
painfully common in recent history. One of the country’s largest
accounting houses, Arthur Andersen, was actually indicted and dis-
banded as a result of its accounting practices. So, remember that your
employer’s auditor may be liable under ERISA for knowingly taking part
in a breach of fiduciary duty when the employer is fraudulent in its
accounting practices.
Knowing Who Pays for What: Fiduciaries
and Lavish Spending
Fiduciaries are in a tough spot when it comes to balancing the administration
of the plan along with fees and expenses. The fiduciary’s job is to protect the
plan’s assets from being wasted on extravagant purchases and outrageous
fees. The fiduciary must make sure that the plan pays only reasonable fees
and expenses. Fiduciaries, however, are increasingly subject to lawsuits for
approving fees that are excessive or for failing to uncover hidden fees that
the plan ends up paying. All plans must have desks for the plan employees,
carpeting on the floor, and funds for the occasional seminar. But when the
desk is an antique French collector’s item, the carpets are rare Persians, or
the seminars are in Oahu, the fiduciary has breached her obligation to pro-
tect plan assets.
160
Part III: Guarding Your Pension from Your Employer 

Plan expenses
ERISA has a basic principle that says plan assets must be used only to pay
benefits to the plan members and their beneficiaries. But because the plan
has ongoing expenses, that money has to come from somewhere, including
occasionally from the plan’s assets. While the plan is permitted to spend plan
assets on activities that benefit the plan, such as financial or legal advice for
the plan, these questions remain: “What expenses can the plan legitimately
pay for and what expenses must be eaten by the employer?” When your 
fiduciaries decide to have fancy $200 lunches and meetings in the Bahamas
instead of in their own offices, you shouldn’t expect your plan to foot the bill.
As you can imagine, it costs money to run the plan. And it’s the job of the
plan administrator to oversee the day-to-day plan activities and to pay for
those services. The administrator is a fiduciary, so she isn’t free to spend as
she wishes. All expenses must be reasonable. If you want to see where your
company’s expenses are being spent, check out its Form 5500, which is a
joint tax form used by the Department of Labor and the Internal Revenue
Service. In this form, you can find the totals paid to consultants and lawyers
(and other such folks), the salaries for the people running the plan, and
expenses for things like rent and office supplies. (We explain the Form 5500 in
a bit more detail in Chapter 6.)
You can expect the plan to pay certain expenses. And because ERISA permits
plans to use plan assets to pay reasonable plan expenses, you can be sure
that they will. ERISA provides plan sponsors and fiduciaries with much dis-
cretion as to how to allocate plan expenses. As long as the method for charg-
ing the plan is provided for in the plan documents and isn’t inconsistent with
ERISA, the plan can be charged for the following reasonable expenses:
 Actuarial reports about required minimum payments to plan partici-
pants or their beneficiaries
 Preparation of summary plan descriptions (which we cover in Chapter 8)
 Liquidation of the plan when it’s terminated (see Chapter 12 for more
about pension terminations)
 Qualified domestic relations order (QDRO) charges (Chapter 15 has
more details about QDROs)
 Plan amendments relating to fiduciary functions or requirements
because the law changed
Your employer can pay for these expenses if it wants to (and your employer
just might pay them because these expenses generally are deductible
expenses). But your employer also can shift these expenses to the plan and,
in effect, to the employees.
161
Chapter 10: Zeroing In on Fiduciaries

Also, in defined contribution plans, some fees can be charged directly to par-
ticipants who cause the plan to bear a fee on their behalf. These fees include
those caused by the following:
 Processing hardship withdrawals
 Calculating benefits under different distribution options
 Making distributions
 Processing QDROs
For example, if Mr. Joe Employee gets a divorce, the plan incurs expenses 
for the processing and administration of a QDRO (see Chapter 15 for more
details). If the retirement plan is drafted to provide for this plan expense, the
plan can charge Joe’s account directly for the QDRO-related expenses.
Employer expenses
Of course, other expenses do come up, but some expenses can’t be properly
paid with the assets of the plan. So the expense has to be paid by the employer.
The employer usually absorbs these costs when the expense benefits the
employer rather than the plan or plan participant. Examples of these expenses
include
 Actuarial reports that provide the employer information about the finan-
cial impact of the plan on the company
 Consulting fees to design the plan

Keeping an Eye on Your 
Plan’s Fiduciaries
Improper activities can flourish only when they go undetected. So you do
yourself and your fiduciary a favor when you make the effort to find out for
yourself exactly what’s going on with your plan’s assets, investments, and
162
Part III: Guarding Your Pension from Your Employer 

spending. By requesting plan documents, asking questions, and raising 
concerns with the administrators or trustees, you make the plan administra-
tors and your fiduciaries aware that someone is watching and paying atten-
tion to what they’re doing. Sunlight not only uncovers some problems, but
also serves to remove the temptation to take that trip to Scotland or play
that round of golf on the plan’s tab. These and other improper activities can
be prevented by your watchful eye.
What are the signs of bad fiduciaries?
When you’re on the lookout for improper fiduciary activities, you simply
have to know the warning signs. Here are some of the most common:
 Failure to negotiate low fees from money managers
 Failure to establish appropriate benchmarks for the financial perfor-
mance of the fund
 Inappropriate distribution of plan assets for the size of the fund
 Failure to monitor financial advisors and their performance
The amounts paid to money managers and the allocation of plan assets are
listed on the Form 5500 (see Chapter 6 for more information).
Don’t be fooled if your fiduciaries tell you that the responsibility for inappro-
priate investments isn’t their problem. A fiduciary can’t shake his obligations
by delegating the work to someone else.
What can you do to get 
rid of bad fiduciaries?
If your plan fiduciaries have violated the rules, and if your questions or 
concerns haven’t been resolved, you can take action. You should contact 
the nearest field office of the Employee Benefits Security Office (EBSA) 
of the Department of Labor. The EBSA has the authority and power to 
investigate wrongdoing, and it can take action to correct the problem. Go to
askebsa.dol.gov for more information about how the EBSA can help you.
You can also contact the EBSA by calling 866-444-EBSA (866-444-3272).
If the EBSA is unable to help, you’ve reached the pinnacle. You may have to
protect your pension with your final recourse: a lawsuit against your fiducia-
ries. In this case, contact an attorney who can advise you of what steps you
163
Chapter 10: Zeroing In on Fiduciaries

need to take (check out Chapter 19 for the scoop on hiring an attorney).
These types of lawsuits are becoming much more common in the wake of
Enron and other corporate scandals. We address lawsuits further in Chap-
ter 20.
Unlawful party-in-interest transactions, such as cozy loans, are a matter to be
reported to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS); it’s the IRS that can impose
tax penalties on prohibited transactions.

Dealing with Your 
Employer’s Corporate and
Financial Changes
In This Chapter
 Understanding the implications when your company is merged or sold
 Looking at your options when your employment relationship is terminated
 Safeguarding your pension in spite of your employer’s bankruptcy
T
he primary reasons that the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974 (ERISA) exists are to protect the funds that you and your employer
deposit into your retirement plan while you’re still working and to ensure
that you have access to plan information whenever you need it. This protec-
tion and access to information is especially helpful if your company is about
to undergo major changes.
And let’s face it — life happens. You were never given any guarantees that
you’d be at the same job your whole life or that your company wouldn’t make
any changes. This fact is even truer in today’s ever-changing world. Our
hope, then, is that you’ll be armed with the right information to make wise
choices when you’re presented with some of the most common workplace
changes.
To help arm you with the right information, in this chapter we cover such
topics as company mergers and acquisitions and the very unfortunate but
real possibility that your employer declares bankruptcy. We also address job
changes that you decide to make or that are made for you. All these situa-
tions impact your pension in some way.

Keeping an Eye on Your Plan When Your
Employer Combines with Another
The following two major scenarios can affect your pension plan:
 Your company merges with another company to create a single new
company.
 Your company is sold to the highest bidder and operates under direct
control of the acquiring company.
Whatever change your company ultimately makes, you need to find out what
will happen to the benefits that you’ve already accrued (depending on the
type of plan you have), and you need to keep track of all changes so that you
fully protect your benefits.
Generally, corporate acquisition can occur in one of two ways:
 In a stock deal: In this type of deal, Company B purchases the stock of
Company A and thereby acquires both the assets and the liabilities
(debts) of Company A, including its pension liabilities.
 In an asset deal: In this type of deal, Company B purchases only the
assets of Company A and therefore is not responsible for Company A’s
liabilities.
What are the possible plan changes 
after a merger or acquisition?
Your company has the following retirement plan options if it merges with or
is acquired by another company:
 The new company can take over the plans of your company and allow
you (and other employees) to continue to be covered under those plans.
In this instance, you don’t have to deal with any plan changes.
 The new company can merge your company’s plan into its own plan, and
you can immediately begin to accrue benefits under the merged com-
pany’s plan.
 The new company can terminate your company’s plan. In this case, usu-
ally you have the opportunity to roll over your plan benefits into the
new company’s plan or into an individual retirement account (IRA; see
Chapter 5 for general information on IRAs).
166
Part III: Guarding Your Pension from Your Employer 

Also, in this case, the new company may have a choice as to whether it
will credit your service with your old employer for purposes of partici-
pating in its retirement plan. This means that you may begin to accrue
benefits under the new company’s plan on your first day (if you’re cred-
ited with prior service), or you may need to complete the same eligibil-
ity requirements as a newly hired employee (if you aren’t credited).
When your company merges with or is acquired by another company, you
can’t lose any of your accrued benefits under your old plan; this rule is
known as the anti-cutback rule (see Chapter 7 for details). But how the new
company handles your accrued benefits after a merger or acquisition differs
depending on whether you started with a defined contribution plan or a
defined benefit plan (see Chapter 3 for the differences between these two
types of plans). For example, consider these common scenarios:
 If you were in a defined contribution plan with Company A, which then
merges with or is acquired by Company B, and the new company either
has or sets up a defined contribution plan, Company A may directly
transfer your accrued benefits from the original defined contribution
plan to the new one that’s sponsored by Company B. Your accrued bene-
fits stay the same, and the transfer shouldn’t result in any negative tax
consequences to you as long as your plan administrator follows all the
rules (which will usually be the case).
It’s likely that the investment options under the Company B plan will be
different from the options under the Company A plan, so you may be
forced out of your old investments.
 If you were in a defined benefit plan with Company A, the new company
(Company B) is generally liable for the debts of Company A under corpo-
rate law principles — but only if it purchased Company A’s stock. So if
you’re worried that Company A didn’t make all the contributions that it
was supposed to, Company B will now have to follow through on that
obligation. In any case, your accrued benefits under the Company A plan
shouldn’t be reduced as a result of the acquisition.
However, if Company B purchases the assets of your old employer
(Company A), it doesn’t assume Company A’s debts. In this case, you
may have to leave benefits under the plan of your old employer
(Company A) and accrue further benefits under the plan of your new
employer (Company B).
Whenever your employer is acquired by or merges with another company,
it’s likely that changes to your defined benefit plan will result. Often the bene-
fit formula under the plan will change going forward. The benefit formula may
provide future benefits at a lesser rate than under your prior plan or it may
have a richer formula and provide better benefits. Or your benefits under 
the defined benefit plan may be frozen, meaning that you may accrue future
167
Chapter 11: Dealing with Your Employer’s Corporate and Financial Changes

benefits under a cash balance formula or under a separate defined benefit
plan. The point is that there are a lot of possibilities when an employer
merges with or is acquired by another company.
How do you keep track of all plan 
information and changes?
If your company is involved in a merger or an acquisition, you’ll receive certain
notices and communications from the plan about the upcoming changes in
benefits and investment choices. The notices may explain changes in the bene-
fit formula in a defined benefit plan, changes in employer contributions in a
defined contribution plan, or changes in investment options under your 401(k)
plan. If your old plan terminates or merges into a new plan, you receive specific
notification from your employer or the plan administrator. Review any notices
carefully, and if you don’t understand them, ask your company’s human
resources department for some guidance. (See Chapter 12, in which notices
regarding plan amendments and terminations are discussed.)
As co-author Jori’s husband always says, better to have something and not
need it than to need it and not have it. So, if you want to protect the benefits
that you’ve already earned, make it a habit to keep track of your benefits, and
maintain a file of all important pension activity. Be sure to keep records of the
following:
 All the places you’ve worked, including the dates that you started and
stopped and your year-end paycheck stubs that indicate your salary or
rates of pay
 Any plan documents that your plan sent you, including the summary
plan description (SPD) and plan amendments, the summary annual
report (SAR), the enrollment forms that confirm that you and other
family members are plan participants, and a copy of the benefit election
form (if you were provided an option as to the form of your distribu-
tions); see Chapter 8 for general information on these plan documents
 Your individual benefit statements (request these yearly to find out the
value of your account)
 All notices and communications regarding the plan and the merger or
the acquisition of the company (as we describe earlier in this section)
It isn’t enough to simply collect these documents like stamps; know what
they say about the vesting of your benefits and know when and under what
circumstances you’re entitled to receive them (see Chapter 7 for general
information about vesting). You should also know what the plan documents
say about mergers and acquisitions.
168
Part III: Guarding Your Pension from Your Employer 

One of the basic functions of the plan administrator is to advise participants
of their rights and options and to respond to your information requests. So if
you have any questions or concerns about what’s happening to your plan,
ask your plan administrator (or the new plan administrator, if you’re inquir-
ing after the fact).
If you find out that your old company will retain control of your retirement
plan after a merger or acquisition, make it a point to stay current on your old
employer’s address and phone number and any changes to its name. It’s also
always a good idea to make sure that your old company knows how to find
you. So be sure to tell your prior plan administrator or human resources
department whenever your current address and phone number are going to
change (and find out how to notify the company in the future if your address
changes again). And of course, continue to save and keep accessible all your
plan documents as you continue working.
Considering Your Options When You End
Your Relationship with Your Employer
Diamonds may be forever, but unfortunately, not much else is — especially
your relationship with your employer. When it comes to your job, one of the
following scenarios is bound to happen at one time or another:
 Your company decides that you need to go. Your being let go may 
be personal (for example, you’re being fired) or it may be that you’re
part of a workforce reduction as a result of your employer’s financial
troubles.
 You decide that you no longer want to continue working with the
same employer. You determine that it’s time to move on to bigger and
better things.
Regardless of whether your termination of employment is your employer’s
decision or yours, it shouldn’t make a difference in terms of how it impacts
the benefits you once enjoyed. Your goals, in either case, are to ensure that
you’ll have access to your pension funds and that your pension benefit
investments are safe.
If you think that your company terminated you in order to deny you benefits —
for example, your employer fires you just before you vest in your benefits —
ERISA provides you with a cause of action. Check out Chapters 18 and 20 for
further information about appealing such matters to your company and about
litigation to protect your rights.
169
Chapter 11: Dealing with Your Employer’s Corporate and Financial Changes

As a terminated employee, you’ll be allowed to receive your vested retirement
benefit when you reach the plan’s normal retirement date. However, the plan
may permit a reduced early retirement benefit at a date prior to the normal
retirement date. The plan may also offer a subsidized early retirement benefit
if you meet special requirements, such as reaching age 55 and having 30
years of service. But if the plan requires 30 years of service and you were ter-
minated after 27 years, you may receive a reduced early retirement benefit,
but you won’t qualify for the subsidized benefit. (See Chapter 9 for general
information on pension distributions.)
Defined contribution plans
If you’ve separated from a company where you had a 401(k), a profit-sharing
plan, or another type of defined contribution plan, it’s possible that the plan
may let you take a lump-sum distribution when you terminate employment.
However, you need to check your plan provisions in the SPD carefully to see
exactly what it says about the form of the distribution. You may have an
option to receive it as an annuity instead (see Chapter 9 for details on these
forms of distribution). You also need to find out the date that a distribution
becomes available to you. While some plans say that you can’t get a distribu-
tion until you reach a certain age, others say that you can’t get one until
you’ve been separated from the company for a certain amount of time.
If your plan offers a lump sum but also offers an annuity as one of the pay-
ment options, both you and your spouse (if you have one) must waive out of
the annuity in order for you to receive your distribution as a lump sum.
If you leave your current employer before normal retirement age and the plan
permits a lump-sum distribution, you have a couple of options regarding your
distribution: You can continue to defer taxes by rolling over your account bal-
ance to an IRA or a new employer’s plan or you can take your money now and
pay taxes on it now. Rolling your benefits over into an IRA or another
employer’s plan is usually the better choice.
Rolling over your money
If you leave your job and you aren’t at the right age to take your retirement dis-
tribution (or you just aren’t ready to take it yet), your new employer’s plan may
accept rollovers. In this case, the plan may allow you to roll over your defined
contribution plan money from your former employer’s plan directly into your
new employer’s defined contribution plan. If your plan allows it, this option is
the best because you don’t ever touch the money, meaning that no taxes are
withheld and no taxes are owed on the amount directly rolled over.
170
Part III: Guarding Your Pension from Your Employer 

However, not all plans allow rollovers. So if you can’t roll your money into
your new employer’s defined contribution plan, your next option is to roll
over your plan benefits into an individual retirement account, or IRA. If possi-
ble, your plan benefits should be rolled over directly to an IRA instead of
being paid directly to you so that you deposit the funds (within 60 days) 
into the IRA.
If your funds aren’t directly rolled over, your plan will write you a check for
your defined contribution plan account balance, but it will be subject to a
mandatory withholding of 20 percent for federal income tax (which your
former employer will ship right out to the Internal Revenue Service). You
then have 60 days to roll over all or any portion of the distribution to an IRA.
Remember, however, any portion that isn’t rolled over is subject to income
tax as a taxable distribution. The point is, to avoid losing 20 percent of the
money you’ve accrued, roll over your money directly!
Head to Chapter 5 for more details on IRAs and rollovers.
Taking your money now
If you want to take either all or a portion of the vested balance in your
account in cash before normal retirement age, you’ll be taxed and possibly
owe penalties for the early withdrawals. This of course reduces your retire-
ment income down the road, so plan accordingly (see Chapter 8 for general
details on planning for your retirement while you’re still working).
If you’re age 55 or older when you separate from the company where you par-
ticipate in a defined contribution plan, you can receive your benefits without
being socked with the additional taxes on distributions prior to age 591⁄2.
Defined benefit plans
If you’re in a defined benefit plan and you stop working for your employer
after you’ve become vested in your benefits but before the plan’s normal
retirement age, usually you’re required to leave the benefits with the retire-
ment plan until you become eligible to receive them. These types of plans
normally don’t permit you to withdraw your money early. In some instances,
however, your plan may offer early retirement options that may entice you to
leave the company sooner than you had planned — and take your benefits
with you. Check your SPD or other plan documents to see what they say
about early distributions.
171
Chapter 11: Dealing with Your Employer’s Corporate and Financial Changes

If you find that your money will be staying put until you reach the eligible age
(which is the most likely scenario), it’s important that you heed the pointers
that we set out for you in the earlier section “How do you keep track of all
plan information and changes?” Most important, you want to make sure that
you can track down the company (or that it can track you down) when the
time comes for you to retire.
Protecting Your Pension if Your 
Employer Goes Bankrupt
A bankrupt employer is quite different from a plan that doesn’t have enough
money to pay its participants, which is called underfunding of the plan. 
(See Chapter 12 for a discussion of that topic.) Generally speaking, if your
employer’s financial condition is such that it must declare bankruptcy, your
retirement plan assets shouldn’t be affected. This is because ERISA safe-
guards your assets by requiring employers to fund the promised benefits and
to keep the plan assets separate from their company’s assets.
There are typically two ways that your employer can declare bankruptcy:
 Chapter 7 bankruptcy: This type of bankruptcy is referred to as a liqui-
dation or straight bankruptcy. When a company files for Chapter 7 bank-
ruptcy, it will usually liquidate its assets to pay its creditors, and after
that it will cease to exist. In this situation, you can expect that your pen-
sion plan will be terminated (see Chapter 12 for full details on plan ter-
minations). Depending on what type of plan you have, different actions
will be taken when your company files for Chapter 7 bankruptcy:
• If you have a defined benefit plan, the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation (PBGC) will jump in and save the day. The PBGC may
assume responsibility for paying the benefits up to a certain maxi-
mum amount. For plans terminated in 2007, for example, that 
maximum amount is $4,125 per month. So, if your monthly pension
benefits before the termination of the plan were less than $4,125
per month, you’ll receive your full benefits. If they were greater,
you’ll receive only the maximum amount. However, certain ancil-
lary benefits (such as subsidized early retirement benefits) may
not be guaranteed by the PBGC.
• If you have a defined contribution plan, your benefit is your
account balance. So your employer’s bankruptcy shouldn’t nega-
tively impact your benefits under the plan.
172
Part III: Guarding Your Pension from Your Employer 

 Chapter 11 bankruptcy: This type of bankruptcy is referred to as a reor-
ganization, and it’s a bit different from a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. If your
company files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, it may not affect your pension
plan. In fact, it’s quite possible that your pension plan, whether it’s a
defined benefit or defined contribution plan, will continue to exist while
the company is trying to reorganize its financial situation under the pro-
tection of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court. It’s likely, however, that future ben-
efits or contributions to the plan will be reduced.
If your company files for bankruptcy, you should immediately contact your
plan administrator and ask for an explanation regarding the status of your
plan and your benefits. You want to make sure that your accrued benefits are
protected. Start with some basic questions like these:
 Has my company filed for Chapter 7 or Chapter 11 bankruptcy?
 Will the pension plan be terminated or will it continue?
 If the plan will be terminated, how will my accrued benefits be paid?
 Will the plan administrator change during the bankruptcy? Who will be
the trustee for the plan? (Get these people’s names and numbers so that
you can contact them when necessary.)
Don’t count on the plan or the company to notify you. Instead, take the initia-
tive and contact the company’s human resources department, the plan
administrator, or the bankruptcy trustee. If you’re in a defined benefit plan,
contact the PBGC to make sure that it’s aware of the bankruptcy.
Because of ERISA’s requirements stating that your employer must make its
plan contributions in a timely manner and that its assets must be kept sepa-
rate from the plan’s assets, your retirement funds should be fairly safe from
your company’s creditors if it declares bankruptcy. On top of that, ERISA
requires that the plan’s fiduciaries properly manage the fund and not abuse
the assets (head to Chapter 10 to find out more about fiduciaries).

Handling Plan Modifications 
and Terminations
In This Chapter
 Getting the lowdown on plan amendments
 Surveying the basics of standard plan terminations
 Finding out about distress and involuntary terminations
F
or your pension plan to be a qualified plan under the Employee Retire-
ment Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and receive preferential tax
treatment (see Chapter 2 for details), it had to be established by your
employer as a permanent plan when it was set up. However, down the road
your employer can amend some of the plan provisions as long as the plan
documents allow amendments to be made and as long as the benefits you’ve
accrued (or accumulated) prior to the amendment aren’t reduced. Because
your benefits can be changed, it’s important to know what your protected
benefits are at the time that your plan is modified. Knowing this information
can help you be sure that your benefits are actually being protected. We give
you the full scoop on plan amendments in this chapter.
Under ERISA, plan terminations are handled differently from amendments. 
We explain in this chapter the three ways that terminations can occur for a
defined benefit plan: through a voluntary standard termination, a voluntary
distress termination, or an involuntary termination.
The good news is that even if your company runs into financial troubles 
(and let’s face it, we all do), you’ll still have your pension. The bad news,
however, is that the amount you actually receive may be less than what 
you had anticipated.

The Particulars of Plan Amendments
If your company changes its pension plan, it must follow certain procedures
to make sure that you’re properly informed of the intended changes and the
nature of those changes. We give you what you need to know in the following
sections.
Finding out what your plan 
can’t (and can) change
Your qualified retirement plan contains lots of provisions regarding the benefits
that you’re entitled to and when you’re entitled to them. However, many of
these benefits are subject to being amended or eliminated by your employer. In
the following sections, we sift through the rules concerning what plan benefits
are protected, when they’re protected, and when they can be changed.
The summary plan description (SPD), which the plan administrator must pro-
vide to you and your beneficiaries, usually contains language that authorizes
plan amendments, the elimination of plan benefits, and plan termination. (See
Chapter 8, where we discuss SPDs in more detail, including how to obtain a
copy if you haven’t been provided one.)
Benefits protected from amendments
Under tax law, your accrued benefits are always protected. (Accrued benefits
are those that you, as a plan participant, have already accumulated and 
have a right to collect; see Chapter 7 for more information on accrual.) Tax-
qualified retirement plans (including defined benefit and defined contribution
plans) can’t be amended to eliminate or reduce retirement benefits that
you’ve already earned and have a right to.
It gets a little trickier, though, when you’re trying to determine the rights and
benefits that are protected as part of your benefit accrual. Some of your
rights and benefits that are protected include the following:
 Early retirement benefits: ERISA doesn’t require pension plans (including
both defined benefit and defined contribution plans) to provide partici-
pants with the option to retire earlier than at the plan’s normal retirement
age. But if your plan offers such an option, it generally can’t amend its 
provisions to eliminate your right to begin receiving a retirement-type
benefit at a particular date that comes after you stop working and before
normal retirement age.
176
Part III: Guarding Your Pension from Your Employer 

 Retirement-type subsidies: A protected retirement-type subsidy gener-
ally refers to a subsidized early retirement benefit. If the plan offers a sub-
sidized early retirement benefit, it pays the same benefit at an early
retirement age (for example, age 62) that it would at normal retirement
age (for example, age 65). Another type of subsidy is a subsidized quali-
fied joint and survivor annuity, which provides the same monthly pay-
ment over the joint lives of you and your spouse as over your life alone
(see Chapter 14 for more about these annuities). Because retirement-
type subsidies are protected, they can’t be eliminated retroactively. In
other words, the subsidy can be eliminated for benefits earned after the
amendment but not for benefits earned prior to the amendment.
Defined contribution plans don’t offer these benefits because your
employer is placing your contributions (and its own contributions) into
an individual account that’s yours when you retire.
 Benefit payment rights: Your defined benefit or defined contribution plan
may offer you the right to receive your benefit payment in optional forms.
For example, it may provide you the right to receive payment in a lump
sum instead of an annuity. Another example is when a plan permits a par-
ticipant to receive an in-service distribution (a distribution that you receive
while you’re still working for the employer that’s sponsoring the plan).
Generally, your right to receive an in-service distribution is protected.
Certain optional forms of payment may be eliminated, but a plan that
offers a lump-sum distribution can never eliminate that lump sum option.
Features subject to amendments
Even though qualified retirement plans can’t reduce the benefits that you’ve
already accumulated, they can change the rate at which you earn future bene-
fits. For example, if you’re accruing benefits at the rate of $10 per month for
your years of service through 2006, your defined benefit plan can be amended
to provide that for years of service starting in 2007, benefits will be credited at
the rate of $8 per month.
Defined contribution plans are usually funded by both employers and
employees, and your employer isn’t likely to amend the rate at which you
contribute to your plan. The employer may, however, change the amount of
the contributions it makes in the future. Depending on the plan terms, the
employer may also be allowed to reduce or even eliminate its future contribu-
tions to the plan.
Other defined contribution plan features that aren’t protected from amend-
ments include
 Your right to make contributions at a particular rate on either a before-
or after-tax basis
 Your right to direct investments (see Chapter 6)
177
Chapter 12: Handling Plan Modifications and Terminations

 Your right to a particular form of investment (see Chapter 6)
 Your right to take a loan from the plan (see Chapter 13)
Understanding the purpose of 
a determination letter request
If your employer intends to amend a provision of its pension plan, it has the
option of seeking an advance determination, called a determination letter, from
the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). This letter would inform the employer as to
whether the plan would retain its tax-qualified status if it were to go through
with the amendment. Why an employer wouldn’t take advantage of that option
is beyond us. It only makes sense that a company would want to be certain
that the changes it intends to make to its plan would be approved by the IRS
and that the plan would continue to receive favorable tax treatment.
Small employers may decide to forego filing for an IRS determination letter
due to the cost involved (primarily legal fees). However, the legal fees and IRS
filing fees (called user fees) for applying for a determination letter are small
when compared to the cost that could arise for an improper amendment that
may disqualify a plan.
Even though your employer isn’t required to request a determination letter
from the IRS to amend its plan, in order to exercise this option, the employer
must apply for the determination letter in writing. This request is known as a
determination letter request (pretty clever, huh?). After it receives the determi-
nation letter request from your employer, the IRS will review the plan and the
proposed amendment.
A favorable IRS determination means that the IRS believes that the terms of
the plan amendment meet the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code
and that the plan will continue to receive favorable tax treatment. What this
means to you is that you’re still participating in a qualified plan that enjoys
certain tax advantages, creditor protection, and the things we discuss more
fully in Chapter 2.
One of the advantages of the determination letter process is that if the IRS
doesn’t approve of the amendment, the amendment can be revised to satisfy
the IRS before it has an adverse impact on the plan’s tax-qualified status. In
other words, the IRS may require certain revisions in the amendment before
it will issue a favorable determination letter.
178
Part III: Guarding Your Pension from Your Employer 

Being notified of determination 
letters and amendments
When your employer intends to apply for a determination letter, the plan
administrator is required to give notice to all plan participants. You and all
other plan participants must be notified not less than ten days and not more
than 24 days before the application is filed.
You’re also required to receive advance notice of an amendment that will
reduce or modify the future accrual of benefits (called an ERISA 204(h) notice).
Your employer’s failure to provide this advance notice can cause the amend-
ment to be ineffective.
According to IRS Treasury Regulations, notice of a determination letter
request must be provided by any method that reasonably ensures that all
current employees eligible to participate in the plan and former employees
with benefits under the plan will receive the notice in a timely manner. Some
acceptable methods include electronic transmission, in person, and by mail.
A posting in the workplace is also acceptable. If notice is delivered electroni-
cally, it must be through an electronic medium that’s reasonably accessible,
such as e-mail.
When a pension plan amends any of the information that’s required to be
included in the SPD, this change is referred to as a material modification to
the plan. This change must be disclosed to plan participants and beneficia-
ries through a form called a summary of material modifications (SMM) or a
revised summary plan description.
The SMM must be distributed within 210 days after the close of the plan year
in which the change is adopted (a plan year can be a calendar year or any 
12-month period that the plan chooses to keep its records). Each participant
must receive a hard copy or an electronic copy of the SMM; mere posting of
the SMM in the workplace isn’t sufficient. (Flip to Chapter 8 for more on the
SPD, the SMM, and the other documents that you’re entitled to receive.)
If your employer mails a notice to you at your last known address (even if
you don’t live there anymore), this fulfills the notice requirement. The moral
of this ever-so-short story is to keep your plan updated with your current
address, phone number, and e-mail address so that you can be sure to receive
all disclosures that your employer or plan administrator provides.
The following rules from the IRS apply to electronic notification:
 The electronic medium must be reasonably designed to provide the
notice in a manner no less understandable to you than a written paper
document.
179
Chapter 12: Handling Plan Modifications and Terminations

 You must affirmatively consent to the delivery of the notice in this
manner. In other words, in order to receive an electronic notice instead
of a written notice, you must demonstrate that you can access the
notice in the electronic form used. You can do this by electronically con-
senting (which demonstrates that you’re able to access the notice) or in
writing (but only if you confirm your consent electronically).
 When the electronic notice is provided, you must be advised that you
may request and receive a hard copy at no charge.
The Standards of Standard 
Plan Terminations
Unfortunately, all good things come to an end, and pension plans can be
affected. Sometimes defined benefit plans go belly up and have to terminate.
Most defined benefit plan terminations, however, are standard terminations,
meaning that the plan has enough assets to pay all the benefits it owes to its
employees and beneficiaries. Why, then, would a company terminate a quali-
fied retirement plan? The IRS lists the following as some of the reasons:
 There has been a sale, transfer, or merger of companies resulting in a
change of ownership.
 The employer has liquidated or dissolved.
 The employer has undergone some adverse business conditions.
 A new plan was adopted.
We give you the nitty-gritty on standard terminations in the following sec-
tions. Mostly we talk about the termination of defined benefit plans. (A rarer
type of plan termination is a distress termination, which we discuss later in
this chapter.)
The rules governing standard terminations apply only to defined benefit plans
because these plans are insured by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation,
or PBGC. The PBGC, which was established by ERISA, is basically an insurance
company for your pension plan. In other words, vested accrued benefits from
defined benefit plans (meeting certain requirements of the PBGC), are pro-
tected up to a certain amount. So what does this mean if you have a defined
contribution plan (which isn’t protected by the PBGC)? These types of plans
are individual accounts, so whatever is in your account at the time the plan is
terminated is your account balance, and you’re entitled to these benefits.
180
Part III: Guarding Your Pension from Your Employer 

Even though the PBGC provides certain protections for defined benefit plans,
if the plan is terminating through a standard termination, the PBGC’s role is
very small at this point. It serves to oversee the termination and confirm that
in fact the plan has sufficient assets to pay the anticipated benefits. After
that, the PBGC simply ensures that the benefits are distributed and the plan
terminated. Later in this chapter, we talk about the PBGC’s expanded role in
the case of involuntary plan terminations (when the PBGC decides that termi-
nation is in order) and distress terminations.
Becoming 100 percent vested
A tax-qualified plan must provide that a participant’s accrued benefits
become 100 percent vested as of the date of the plan’s termination, to the
extent funded. The phrase to the extent funded simply means the amount that
has been paid into the plan by the employer as of the date of the plan’s termi-
nation. You’re always 100 percent vested in your own contributions, but when
your plan terminates, you’re required to be fully vested in your employer’s
contributions as well. This is a nonforfeitable right to 100 percent of your
employer’s contributions to your account balance (in the case of defined con-
tribution plans) and to your accrued benefits (in the case of defined benefit
plans). See Chapter 7 for more about accrual and vesting.
Finding out about a standard termination
In a standard termination, your plan administrator must first inform you in
writing that your pension plan is being terminated. This notice, called the
Notice of Intent to Terminate, must be provided at least 60 days and not more
than 90 days before the proposed termination date. It must inform you,
among other things, that:
 The plan administrator intends to terminate the plan as of a specific pro-
posed date.
 The plan assets must be sufficient to provide all plan benefits in order to
terminate in a standard termination.
 Benefit accruals will stop as of the termination date.
 Annuity contracts, if required, may be purchased from certain insurers,
which must be specifically identified.
 A written statement regarding your specific benefits will be provided 
to you.
181
Chapter 12: Handling Plan Modifications and Terminations

 If you’re already receiving monthly retirement benefits, your benefits
won’t be affected. But if your benefits will be affected, you must be given
an explanation as to how the amount will be affected.
When your company intends to terminate through a standard termination, it
also must notify the PBGC on a form called the Standard Termination Notice
Single-Employer Plan Termination. This form, which must be filed no later
than 180 days after the proposed termination date, certifies that the plan is
expected to have enough assets to provide all benefit liabilities.
The next notice your plan administrator will provide you is called the Notice
of Plan Benefits. This notice must be provided no later than the date that the
company files its Standard Termination Notice with the PBGC. Here are the
requirements for the Notice of Plan Benefits:
 It must be written in plain language.
 It must tell you the estimated amount of your benefits.
 It must tell you the form in which your benefit has been valued (either
an annuity or lump sum).
 It must include the information used in calculating your benefits, such as
your length of service, your age (or your beneficiary’s age, if you’re
deceased), your wages, and the interest rate assumptions.
In general, when a defined contribution plan terminates, the benefits are paid
in the form of an annuity unless the plan offers an optional form of benefit,
such as a lump-sum distribution, which you select instead.
The following are some other notices that must be provided to you in certain
situations:
 The Notice of Annuity Information: If your benefits can be distributed
in the form of an annuity, this notice must be provided to you no later
than 45 days before the annuity distribution date.
 The Notice of Identity of Insurers: The purpose of this notice is to help
participants make informed elections between lump sums and annuity
benefits. This notice must be provided to you no later than 45 days
before the annuity distribution date.
 The Notice of Annuity Contract: If you decide to receive your plan bene-
fits in the form of an annuity, the plan administrator must send this
notice to you no later than 30 days after the contract is available.
182
Part III: Guarding Your Pension from Your Employer 

Just as with the Notice of Intent to Terminate, these notices must be either
hand-delivered or delivered by first-class mail (or even courier service) 
to your last known address. The notices may be issued electronically if it’s
reasonably calculated that you’ll actually receive them. If you’re a participant
in a terminating defined benefit plan and you haven’t received proper notice
of the termination, contact your plan administrator.
Distributing the assets
The PBGC has 60 days from the date it receives notification of the plan’s 
intent to terminate to issue a notice of noncompliance if it determines that it’s
likely the plan assets won’t be sufficient to meet its benefit liabilities or if it
determines that the notice requirements haven’t been satisfied. If the PBGC
issues such a notice, the plan can’t terminate at that time and will need to con-
tinue until the plan assets are sufficient to cover the benefits under the plan.
Assuming that the PBGC doesn’t issue a notice of noncompliance and that
your plan qualifies for a standard termination, the PBGC allows the plan
administrator to complete the termination and distribute the plan assets by
doing either of the following:
 Purchasing annuities from an insurance company, which then pays bene-
fits to each participant upon retirement
 Making lump-sum distributions
The deadline that employers must meet to distribute all the participants’
benefits is normally the later of the following:
 180 days after the end of the PBGC’s 60-day (or extended) review period
 If the plan administrator has timely submitted a valid IRS determination
letter request, 120 days after receipt of a favorable determination letter
(this deadline may be extended)
After promised benefits are provided through the purchase of an annuity or
through a lump-sum distribution, the PBGC guarantee ends. Within 30 days
after the last distribution date, the plan administrator must certify to the
PBGC that the plan assets and benefits were distributed as required.
If you’re entitled to receive a lump sum from your plan when it terminates,
you can make a tax-free rollover into an individual retirement account (IRA).
But make sure it’s a direct rollover from your plan into the IRA so you can
defer taxes on your distribution until you begin receiving the benefits from
the IRA. See Chapter 5 for more about rollovers and IRAs.
183
Chapter 12: Handling Plan Modifications and Terminations

If your plan offers an optional form of benefit, don’t jump the gun and decide
to take your (lump sum) money and run without first considering this: The
calculation of the lump sum may turn out to be less than what the number
crunchers consider to be the present value of the retirement fund. Consult a
professional before you make this decision (also see Chapter 9, in which we
discuss the pros and cons of annuity versus lump-sum distributions).
The Details of Distress and 
Involuntary Terminations
If your defined benefit pension plan can’t satisfy the requirements for a stan-
dard termination, it can be voluntarily terminated if your employer meets 
the requirements for a distress termination. Usually this type of termination
happens when the plan is underfunded (meaning that the plan assets won’t be
sufficient to cover all benefit liabilities) and the employer is in such financial
distress that it can’t make up the plan’s underfunding. Sometimes, though, an
employer is in such chaos that the PBGC takes action on its own without
waiting for an employer’s application; this type of termination is an involun-
tary termination. We give you the lowdown on these terminations in the fol-
lowing sections.
If you’re in a plan that’s insured by the PBGC (in other words, if you’re in a
defined benefit plan), and the plan has been less than 80 percent funded for
the past year or two and less than 90 percent funded for several years, your
plan administrator is required to give you an annual written notice of the
plan’s funding situation and the limits on the PBGC’s guaranteed insurance.
But why wait to find out this information from a yearly plan notice? You have
a legal right to obtain information about your plan’s funding at any time by
requesting the information in writing from your plan administrator. (See
Chapter 17 for a more detailed discussion of underfunding as a warning sign
that your plan isn’t doing well.)
Like those of standard terminations (which we cover earlier in this chapter),
the rules governing distress and involuntary terminations apply only to
defined benefit plans that are insured by the PBGC.
What can you expect during a distress 
or involuntary termination?
As we mention earlier, a distress termination is the way your employer may
terminate a defined benefit retirement plan that doesn’t have enough assets
to pay all the benefits. However, to terminate a plan in this manner, the
184
Part III: Guarding Your Pension from Your Employer 

employer must prove to the PBGC that it’s in such poor financial condition 
or the pension costs are so burdensome that the employer can’t continue in
business and support the plan.
In certain dire financial circumstances (such as when the plan doesn’t have
enough money to pay benefits when due), you can expect the PBGC to take
action on its own to end a pension plan. This involuntary termination hap-
pens when the PBGC determines that plan termination is needed to protect
the interests of plan participants. In such a termination, the PBGC notifies the
plan administrator and often publishes a notice about its action in local and
national newspapers.
With either termination, if the plan can pay at least the PBGC-guaranteed 
benefits, the PBGC authorizes the plan administrator to distribute the plan
assets as in a standard termination (we cover the distribution of assets in a
standard termination earlier in this chapter). If the plan doesn’t have enough
money to pay even the PBGC-guaranteed benefits, the PBGC steps in, takes
the plan over, and uses PBGC funds to make sure that you receive your guar-
anteed benefits.
If the PBGC takes over your plan, it guarantees the payment of your vested
pension benefits up to the limits that are set by law (which means that you
may not receive all the benefits that are due to you). Benefits that aren’t 
guaranteed or that exceed the PBGC’s limits may or may not be paid. It all
depends on the plan’s funding and on whether the PBGC is able to recover
additional amounts from the employer.
For plans with a 2007 termination date, the maximum guarantee is $49,500
per year (or $4,125 per month), presuming that you’re age 65 with a single life
annuity. What does this mean to you? If your plan terminates, the PBGC guar-
antees that you’ll receive up to this amount. The guaranteed limit varies
depending on whether you’re under 65 (the guarantee is lower) or over 65
(the guarantee is higher). So if you’re due more than this amount in benefits,
at least you know you’ll be getting a good chunk of what has been guaran-
teed. For most people, these limits tend to be sufficient. For further details on
guaranteed limits set by law, head to the PBGC’s Web site at www.pbgc.gov.
What is the PBGC’s role in distress 
and involuntary terminations?
In a distress or involuntary termination, your plan administrator sends to 
the PBGC full information concerning your benefits. At this point, the PBGC
becomes trustee of your plan and notifies you (and all other plan partici-
pants) of this action. The time schedule in these situations is up to the PBGC.
185
Chapter 12: Handling Plan Modifications and Terminations

The process for both distress terminations and involuntary terminations
then goes something like this:
1. Initially the PBGC provides you with general information about the pen-
sion insurance program and its guarantees.
2. As trustee, the PBGC takes over your records. At this point, it continues
making benefit payments to current retirees (without interruption)
based on an estimate of the benefits that they should receive under the
PBGC insurance program.
3. The PBGC reviews the plan’s records, provisions, and assets, in addition
to your age and length of participation in the plan. With this information,
it calculates your benefits based on the form in which they’ll be paid
(either an annuity or a lump sum). Then the PBGC notifies you of the
amounts that you’ll receive and advises you of your right to appeal its
benefit calculation.
4. The PBGC begins making benefit payments to new retirees. If you aren’t
yet eligible for retirement, the PBGC provides you with your plan bene-
fits at the same time that you would have been eligible under the pen-
sion plan had it not been terminated.
186
Part III: Guarding Your Pension from Your Employer 
Freezing benefits as an alternative 
to a plan termination
In some cases, termination may be the only sen-
sible course of action. In most cases, however,
other options, such as freezing the benefits, can
be considered before terminating a defined ben-
efit plan. A frozen plan continues to operate and
pay benefits to plan participants upon retirement.
The only difference is that benefit accruals are
frozen as of a future date. In other words, an
employer may notify plan participants that no
additional plan benefits may be accrued after a
certain date.
Another option for the employer may be to freeze
participation in the plan but continue to provide
future benefit accruals for employees hired prior
to a certain date. For example, employees hired
before January 1, 2008, may still participate in
and receive future benefit accruals under the
defined benefit plan. Employees hired on or after
January 1, 2008, however, will be excluded from
the defined benefit plan (but may be able to par-
ticipate in a defined contribution plan). If your
employer’s plan is amended to either freeze ben-
efits or freeze participation, you’ll be notified by
your employer.

Part IV
Shielding Your
Pension from Life’s
Ups and Downs

In this part . . .
W
hether you’re facing financial difficulties, divorce,
or even bankruptcy, in this part we help you
understand how these situations affect your pension 
and the options that are available to shield your hard-
earned benefits.
Included in this part is a discussion of how and when 
you can get a loan from your pension plan. We go over 
the special hardship situations that make it easier to take
money out of your plan. If you’re going through a divorce,
this part can help you determine how your pension will be
allocated. We also explain the survivorship rules so that
you know what your spouse can expect to receive from
your pension in the event that you die before him or her.
And, just in case you run across some serious money
issues, we discuss the issue of creditor protection — how
best to protect your assets both in and out of bankruptcy.

 Deciphering loan termination and disqualified plans
L
et’s face it: Everybody needs money, and occasionally we need more
than our savings accounts can produce. Taking a loan from your pension
plan may sound like a good idea when you first say it out loud, but because
there are so many ins and outs involved with borrowing from your tax-qualified
plan, you may find that it isn’t always the best idea. In other words, if you
don’t know the rules regarding pension plan loans, you may end up making a
costly mistake. So protect yourself (and your hard-earned dough) by knowing
the rules before you take a loan from your plan. And remember, some plans
don’t even permit loans. So the first thing you should do is find out whether
your plan can grant you a loan. Simply check your summary plan description
(SPD) or ask the plan administrator to find out.
In this chapter, we discuss the pluses and minuses of taking out a loan from
your pension plan and guide you through the loan process. We also describe
what happens when good loans go bad and problems because of loan termi-
nations and plan disqualifications. The same loan rules apply to both defined
benefit plans and defined contribution plans.
You can’t, under any circumstances, pledge your plan benefits to a bank or
any party other than the plan as security for a loan or for any other purpose.
Also remember that loans from individual retirement accounts (IRAs) are 
prohibited. If you borrow money from your IRA or attempt to pledge your
IRA as security for a loan, the entire IRA is disqualified and taxable to you.
See Chapter 5 for the basics of IRAs.

Surveying the Pros and Cons 
of Borrowing from Your 
Pension Plan
In some cases, it may be smart to take a loan from your pension plan, but in
more cases than not, it may not be the best idea to use your future retirement
to take care of today’s debts. The following sections list the advantages and
disadvantages to consider.
The benefits
Here’s a list of some advantages to borrowing the money you need from your
pension instead of taking out a traditional loan:
 You can borrow the money for any reason at all. So what if you need
$5,000 to enter a poker tournament — no staid banker will be around
to give you the look.
 You can avoid extensive and intrusive paperwork and credit checks.
 You’ll have more control over when you get the loan. Most banks oper-
ate on their timetables, not yours. Presumably your plan will take less
time than a bank.
 Your interest rate will be a fair and reasonable one (we discuss interest
rates later in this chapter).
 When you pay back your loan, you’re really paying it back to yourself,
and depending on the interest rate, your account may have earned more
from the interest on the loan to yourself than it was earning in the plan
itself. (We cover the repayment of loans later in this chapter.)
 A loan from your plan isn’t taxable to you as long as you follow the
rules and repay the loan in accordance with the loan’s repayment 
schedule.
You may also consider borrowing from your plan if no one else will give you
a loan. If you’re facing an emergency, need the money, and can’t get it else-
where or soon enough, your pension plan may be the answer as long as you
follow the rules.
190
Part IV: Shielding Your Pension from Life’s Ups and Downs 

When you borrow money from your plan, if possible, take it from the invest-
ments that are paying the weakest returns. However, keep in mind that
depending on your plan, you may have no choice about where the fund takes
the money for your loan. For example, in a defined benefit plan, you don’t
have that option because everyone’s money is invested as a group. (See
Chapter 3 for the lowdown on defined benefit plans.) But the statement of the
investments in your defined contribution plan may show a money market
investment earning 4 percent and bonds earning 6 percent. It makes more
sense to liquidate the 4 percent investment to generate cash for the loan than
anything paying a higher yield.
The risks
While convenience and privacy are nice perks of a pension loan, they may
be outweighed by the disadvantages of dipping into your retirement. As we
point out in the later section “Recognizing loan requirements,” one disadvan-
tage is that you may need permission from your spouse to take a loan from your
plan — not good if you want to buy a Harley-Davidson with your loan. Also, the
folks who run the plan, who probably include management people from your
firm, may know that you’re short on cash and borrowing from the plan.
Here are some other disadvantages to consider:
 If you have only stocks available for liquidation, you may be forced to
cash them in at a low price.
 The interest that you pay on the loan may be at a lower rate than the
plan would otherwise earn on its investments.
 The results of a default on a loan from your pension plan — namely, a
taxable pension distribution — can be traumatic. In other words, if you
default on a loan, you’ll have to pay not only federal and state taxes,
but also the 10 percent federal tax penalty if you’re under age 591⁄2.
(We discuss defaults in more detail later in this chapter.)
 If you’re unexpectedly terminated from your job, you may be faced with
a double whammy: You will have lost your job and your loan may imme-
diately become due and payable.
 Loans to certain people who have clout with the plan (for example, the
employer that sponsors the plan) can result in harsh extra taxes.
 The interest on a pension plan loan usually isn’t deductible. Instead,
consider a home equity loan from a bank; the interest is deductible
from your taxable income.
191
Chapter 13: Hitting Yourself Up for a Loan

Walking through the Loan Process
If by chance you’ve concluded that a pension plan loan isn’t for you, feel free
to skip the rest of this chapter. If, however, you still want that plan loan, you
have some work to do.
Loans to plan participants must be specifically provided for in the plan docu-
ments that we describe in Chapter 8, and the language in the plan document
and the SPD must include the following information:
 The identity of the person who’s authorized to administer the participant
loan program (this can be a person who’s specially assigned this respon-
sibility, such as the plan administrator, or it can be a loan committee)
 The procedure for applying for loans
 The basis on which loans will be approved or denied
 The limitations (if any) on the types and amounts of loans offered
 The procedure for determining reasonable rates of interest
 The types of collateral that may secure a participant loan (in almost all
cases, your loan from the plan is secured solely by your vested benefits
under the plan)
 A description of the events that are considered default and the steps
that will be taken to preserve plan assets in case of such default
We go into more detail on these topics in the following sections.
If the critical loan information isn’t in your plan documents, ask your plan
administrator or human resources manager, in writing (certified mail, return
receipt requested), to provide you with the missing information.
Applying for a loan
The procedure for applying for a loan from your pension plan is specific to
your plan. Consult your plan documents to locate the language describing
how to apply for a loan, and follow that procedure to a T. You’ll have to fill
out loan applications and provide specific information. Keep in mind that
this is just like any other loan except that you’re borrowing the money from
yourself.
192
Part IV: Shielding Your Pension from Life’s Ups and Downs 

Approving (or denying) a loan 
with certain factors in mind
When making a loan, a plan can consider only those factors that would be
considered in the average commercial loan setting. Such factors may include
the applicant’s creditworthiness or financial need. Here are some other rules
that a plan must follow:
 The interest rate for the plan loan must be reasonable. In this case, a
reasonable rate is basically one that a bank would charge for a similar
loan. (See the later section “Determining a rate of interest” for more
information.)
 Your plan can establish a minimum loan amount of up to $1,000.
A loan from a pension plan also has a maximum. (See the later section
“The size of the loan” for details.)
 Loans can’t be limited to current employees. If a plan provides for
loans, those loans must be available to all plan participants, including
former employees with vested benefits in the plan.
 Your plan must offer the same loan percentage to everyone. With this
rule, even the fat cats can get loans. Congress intended for plans to lend
the same percentage of a person’s vested benefits to participants with
both large and small amounts of accrued benefits.
To get your plan approved, you need to follow the rules. In other words, if
you comply with the procedure for the loan and meet the financial criteria,
you should be approved.
The plan can’t make exceptions. If you’re unable to post adequate security, or
if you’re already over the dollar limit for a loan, no amount of pleading will
change a “no loan for you” decision to a yes.
Recognizing loan requirements
You must take seriously the requirements for borrowing from your pension
plan. Failure to follow these rules can have unfortunate consequences,
including causing your loan to be treated by the Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) as a taxable distribution (see Chapter 9 for more about distributions).
So, it’s helpful to know the requirements, and it’s absolutely necessary to
193
Chapter 13: Hitting Yourself Up for a Loan

comply with them — no exceptions. Here’s a list of the most important
requirements that you need to know:
 The loan must be in writing.
 The loan documents must constitute a legally enforceable agreement. In
other words, it must be evidenced by a document (either in writing or in
an electronic medium that satisfies certain conditions), and the terms
of the agreement must comply with the requirements for plan loans.
Usually the agreement is signed unless it’s enforceable under your state
law without being signed.
 The loan must be adequately secured (we cover security later in this
chapter).
 You must establish a true debtor–creditor relationship. In other words,
the loan has established terms in writing and is no different than a loan
from a bank or credit union, which means that it must be repaid in
accordance with the loan terms.
 The plan must charge a reasonable rate of interest. For example, if the
going rate is 7 percent, you can’t have a loan at 5 percent. (We discuss
interest rates later in this chapter.)
 A definite repayment schedule, consisting of amortized payments of prin-
cipal and interest paid at least quarterly (once every three months), must
be established (we give you details about repayment later in this chapter).
 Your pension plan can’t discriminate when it comes to the availability of
loans. If a loan is available to you, it has to be available to others on a
similar basis.
If your plan is subject to the automatic survivor annuity, your spouse’s con-
sent for a loan also is required because a portion of your retirement benefit
automatically goes to your spouse when you die. Because this survivor por-
tion is a pension right that belongs to your spouse, you aren’t permitted to
borrow from the fund without your spouse’s permission. We address survivor
annuities in more detail in Chapter 14.
Looking at loan limitations
Several limiting factors affect a loan from a pension plan: the length and
repayment of a loan and the size of a loan. We cover the ins and outs of
these factors in the following sections.
The length and repayment of the loan
The term of your loan (in other words, how long you have to pay it off) can’t
be longer than five years. The term of a loan that’s outstanding at the end of a
five-year period can’t be renegotiated, and the outstanding amount will be
treated as a pension distribution (which we cover in Chapter 9).
194
Part IV: Shielding Your Pension from Life’s Ups and Downs 

Double-check your loan paperwork! Even if you pay off the loan in three years,
if the loan document inadvertently says it’s a six-year loan (rather than a five-
year loan), the loan wouldn’t meet the following important requirements:
 The repayment schedule can’t be for a term longer than five years.
 The loan must actually be repaid within a five-year period.
This situation still constitutes a pension distribution at the time the loan was
made because the loan document violated the five-year rule.
You’ll be glad to know that there are a few exceptions to this mostly inflexible
five-year time period. But remember that these exceptions still have certain
requirements and they apply only if you find yourself in the following extenu-
ating circumstances:
 You’re taking a leave of absence: If you’re on a leave of absence without
pay, or if you’re working at a pay rate that’s less than the required loan
installments, the payment period may be suspended during the leave of
absence (for a maximum of one year). The kicker, however, is that the
loan must still be repaid within the five-year period.
 You’re in the military: If you’re in the military, your plan can suspend
your loan payments while you’re away from your job serving the coun-
try. Once you resume payment, your plan can give you a choice between
increased payments or payments at the old schedule with a balloon pay-
ment at the end.
 The loan is being used to build or purchase your home: If you’re buying
or building a home, your plan can, if it chooses, cut you some slack.
Instead of requiring you to repay the loan in five years, the plan can
require you to repay within a “reasonable time.” Even though there’s no
set rule on time limitations, the IRS has approved a 15-year limit. But
don’t think you can take your sweet time and pay whenever you want to:
A time and payment schedule must be agreed on when the loan is made.
 You’ve gone bankrupt: Prior to October 17, 2005, if you had an outstand-
ing plan loan and then filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy before the loan was
repaid, bankruptcy law required your employer to discontinue withholding
loan repayment amounts from your wages. Because the law required a
halt to certain activities, this is called an automatic stay. As a result, your
loan would go into default (which we discuss later in this chapter) and
you would face a taxable distribution and the possibility of an additional
early distribution penalty tax. If you filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, how-
ever, plans could continue to withhold loan repayments from your wages.
Under the new Bankruptcy Act that became effective on October 17,
2005, when a pension plan participant files for Chapter 13 bankruptcy,
the employer can continue to withhold payments from the employee’s
wages to repay the loan — and its withholding of the employee’s wages
doesn’t violate the automatic stay provision. Neither is the loan dis-
chargeable in bankruptcy.

Chapter 13: Hitting Yourself Up for a Loan

Loans from retirement plans must be repaid by level amortization (meaning
substantially equal payments) with at least quarterly payments of principal
and interest. You can’t just make interest payments on the loan and repay the
principal at the end of the loan term. Plans often require that loans be repaid
by salary withholding payments, with the payments withheld from each of
your paychecks until the loan is repaid. The payment schedule, such as
monthly or bimonthly, is an agreed-upon term of the loan.
The size of the loan
There are strict limitations on the amount that you’re permitted to borrow
from your pension plan. The outstanding balance of all your loans from all of
your employer’s plans may not exceed the lesser of $50,000 or 50 percent of
your nonforfeitable accrued benefits (those that you’re vested in and entitled
to; see Chapter 7 for more about accrual). Despite this rule, the plan may
permit you to borrow up to $10,000 even if the loan exceeds 50 percent of
your vested interest, provided that you have adequate security for such a
loan outside your pension plan. (We discuss adequate security later in this
chapter.)
For example, if your pension plan has an accumulated value of $120,000 at
the time you take out your loan, 50 percent of the accrued benefit is $60,000.
However, that amount would exceed the $50,000 limit, so all you can borrow
is $50,000.
If permitted by the plan, you can have more than one loan at a time, but com-
bined, your loans can’t exceed the loan limit rules. The $50,000 limitation is
reduced by the highest outstanding loan balance during the 12-month period
prior to the new loan. For instance, if you had a loan balance of $40,000
within the 12 months preceding a request for a new loan, the maximum per-
missible loan amount would be $10,000, which is the difference between the
$50,000 limitation and the $40,000 balance. It wouldn’t matter if, at the time of
your request for a new loan, you owed only $20,000, because within the past
12 months you had owed $40,000.
Exceeding a loan limit triggers a distribution — and that’s not a good thing,
because a distribution is taxable. The good news is that your failure to
comply with the limitations on loans results in a distribution only to the
extent that the dollar limitation is exceeded. So if you could have borrowed
$30,000, but you instead borrowed $40,000, only the extra $10,000 is subject
to being a taxable distribution. (See Chapter 9 for more about pension distri-
butions and taxes.)
196
Part IV: Shielding Your Pension from Life’s Ups and Downs 

Determining a rate of interest
An appropriate interest rate is determined by competitive bank rates for a
similar loan. If a bank would make the loan at 7 percent, that amount would
be considered an appropriate rate. The plan’s loan policy typically ties the
loan interest rate to a specific bank prime rate and usually states that the
plan loan rate is 1 percent or 2 percent over prime.
The Department of Labor believes that when interest rates are an issue, the
problem generally isn’t with interest rates that are too high. Instead, the
problem is with interest rates that are too low. Loans at interest rates that are
too low may be viewed by the IRS as a violation of the plan’s nonalienation
rules (plans can’t assign or alienate their benefits). This could result in the
loss of the plan’s tax-qualified status.
Ensuring adequate security
The requirement of adequate security for a loan is satisfied if the liquidation of
the security will pay off the loan. To determine whether a participant has ade-
quate security to take out a pension plan loan, the plan looks at the type and
amount of security that’s required in an otherwise identical transaction in an
average commercial setting. Simply put, if a $10,000 loan has security that
could be sold for $10,000, the security is adequate for the loan.
197
Chapter 13: Hitting Yourself Up for a Loan
Bankruptcy 101
You may think that bankruptcy is bankruptcy.
Honestly, you’re right — no matter how you look
at it, bankruptcy is never fun. But, in reality, the two
main types — Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 — are
quite different. Here are the important differences:
 In a Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceeding, you’re
able to liquidate all your debts in exchange
for the liquidation of your assets. (Liquidation,
in layman’s terms, is simply wiping out your
debts through the bankruptcy.) A trustee is
appointed to your case, and that person
sells your property and distributes the pro-
ceeds to your creditors. After your assets
are sold, your debts are officially wiped out.
 In a Chapter 13 proceeding, a repayment
plan is established so that your debtors can
be paid in full or in part over a three- to five-
year period. During this repayment period,
your creditors must suspend their collection
efforts.

In almost all cases, your plan loan will be secured by 50 percent of your
vested interest under the plan. Because your plan loans are generally limited
to 50 percent of your vested interest under the plan, your vested benefit is
adequate security for your plan loans.
The only time that it would be possible for your plan loans to exceed 50 per-
cent of your vested interest is if your total loans are less than $10,000. Most
plans don’t adopt the $10,000 exception and won’t let your loans exceed
50 percent of your vested interest. If a plan does permit your loans to exceed
50 percent of your vested interest (under the $10,000 exception), your loan
must be adequately secured by security other than your vested benefit.
The plan administrator and trustee must take great care to ensure that your
loans are adequately secured. For example, if you borrow more than 50 per-
cent of your vested accrued benefits under the plan and the loan is secured
solely by 50 percent of your vested accrued benefits under the plan, the loan
is inadequately secured. The penalty for an improper loan is that the loan will
be treated as a distribution and will be taxable. You can avoid the problem
only by taking loans from the plan that are less than 50 percent of your
vested interest.
Defaulting on a loan
A loan from your own pension plan is just like a loan from a hard-nosed bank:
After you receive your loan, you have to pay it back in the appropriate repay-
ment time frame. In fact, in some ways the penalties for being late or failing to
repay a pension loan are worse then a bank’s. For instance, if you don’t pay
your loan back on time, the loan is considered a distribution from your pen-
sion, called a deemed distribution.
Late loan payments can cause your loan to be in default. Your loan is in default
when you aren’t complying with the terms of the loan (such as not making
your payments on time). However, IRS regulations permit a grace period
(extra time in which to pay on the loan) for late payments before a plan loan
is considered to be in default. The grace period can’t extend beyond the end
of the calendar quarter following the calendar quarter during which the loan
payment was due.
For example, imagine that your loan payment is due on May 15, 2008. The cal-
endar quarter during which this payment is due ends on June 30, 2008. So, if
the missed May 15, 2008, payment hasn’t been paid by September 30, 2008
(which is the end of the calendar quarter following the calendar quarter
during which the payment was due), the loan is in default. And because it’s
in default, the entire balance due on the loan and the accrued interest
through the date of default is a deemed distribution and taxable to the plan
participant.
198
Part IV: Shielding Your Pension from Life’s Ups and Downs 

Even though the defaulted loan was taxable to you as a deemed distribution,
the loan is still considered by the plan to be outstanding for purposes of
determining amounts available to you for future plan loans.
If for some reason you fall behind, make sure you get back on track before the
IRS grace period has passed you by. If you fail to make up any missed payments
by the end of the grace period, the plan has no choice but to consider your
defaulted loan to be a taxable distribution to you.
Understanding Loan Termination 
and Plan Disqualification
Over-the-top abuses of plan assets can cause your plan to be disqualified as a
legitimate pension plan. Or your plan may decide that with all the rules and
risks involved, providing loans to its pensioners isn’t worth the headache.
Both situations are unpleasant, but don’t worry, because the next sections
give you the basics.
When the plan stops providing loans
You may ask yourself why your plan makes it so difficult to borrow what should
be your own money. Before you get too furious, though, remember that your
plan does not have to provide the right to receive a loan against your accrued
pension benefits. Under certain circumstances your plan can even stop allowing
you and other participants to borrow from your pensions. If your plan decides
that permitting participants to borrow from a pension plan is administratively
burdensome, or if there have been questionable loans, the loan provisions can
be removed for future loans. But if the loan provisions are removed, any cur-
rent outstanding loans must still be repaid in accordance with their terms.
When the plan is disqualified
Your company president can’t just borrow from the pension plan and then
turn around and loan the money to the company. Neither can the president
take the company’s pension money and loan it to herself (unless she’s a plan
participant and complies with all of the rules for participant loans discussed
in this chapter). If she does pull a sneaky move like one of these, the plan can
be disqualified, which means that all of the assets in the plan will become
currently taxable to you and the other plan participants. Further, you would
be unable to roll over money from a disqualified plan into a qualified plan or
into an IRA. These are serious consequences that can cost you your retirement.
199
Chapter 13: Hitting Yourself Up for a Loan

Plan disqualification is different from plan termination (see Chapter 12 for
more on plan terminations). With plan disqualifications, the IRS has revoked
the ability of the plan to take advantage of the tax benefits for pension plans.
Even loans to employees who aren’t disqualified persons can cause problems
for a pension plan. For example, the IRS once disqualified a plan for permit-
ting loans to plan participants at below-market rates of interest. Even a loan
to a rank-and-file employee can violate the rules. The moral is that you must
be careful about participant loans.
In the end, the most important thing to remember is that the money in your
company’s pension plan belongs to its participants, and it must be used for
their exclusive benefit. So, when money from the retirement plan is used for
any purpose other than paying pension benefits, the plan may be disqualified
by the IRS. Everyone (you and the company president) must adhere to the
strict loan requirements that we list earlier in this chapter. The rules aren’t
created just to make it difficult for you to borrow from your pension plan;
they were created to protect your money from being abused by those in charge.
The best protection against abuse of plan assets is to pay attention to your
plan. Review your plan’s Form 5500s for monkey business, and don’t be afraid
to ask questions if something doesn’t look right to you.

In This Chapter
 Beginning with basic facts about survivorship benefits
 Checking out survivorship benefits before and after retirement
 Knowing how and when to waive survivorship benefits
 Understanding how tough circumstances affect survivorship benefits
N
o one likes to think about his or her own death, but it’s smart to do
whatever you can right now to protect your loved ones. In this chapter,
you find out how to extend your pension benefits to your spouse and loved
ones after you die. These benefits, called survivorship benefits, are paid by
your pension plan to your designated beneficiary — usually a spouse —
when you die. Survivorship benefits are typically elected to protect your
spouse’s interest in your pension. Now, for the first time, some survivorship
benefits have been extended to same-sex couples and other non-spouse ben-
eficiaries. You can thank the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA) for this
extension of benefits.
The rules of survivorship benefits are pretty tricky. For starters, they’re dif-
ferent depending on whether you die before or after you retire. Have no fear,
though; we break down what you need to know and why you need to know it
in this chapter.
Keep in mind that all annuities are benefits, but not all benefits are annuities.
Survivorship benefits from defined contribution plans consist of your account
balance in the plan when you die, which aren’t necessarily paid out in an
annuity. Survivorship benefits from defined benefit plans, however, are gener-
ally paid in the form of annuity payments for the life of your spouse or other
beneficiary. So the information in this chapter regarding the various types of
survivor annuities relate primarily to defined benefit plans. (See Chapter 3 for
the basics about defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans.)

Understanding the Basics 
of Survivorship Benefits
In 1984, the Retirement Equity Act (REA) became law. One of the primary
goals of the REA was to protect the rights of a pensioner’s spouse in a tax-
qualified pension plan. Before the REA, you could elect, without consulting or
obtaining consent from your spouse, to provide no pension benefits to your
spouse when you died. Now, after the passage of the REA, your spouse has
automatic rights to a pension payment after you die.
The REA changed the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
(ERISA; see Chapter 2) in several important ways. For example, the REA
stated the following provisions:
 When you die, your surviving spouse has an absolute right to an annuity
(or payment) of no less than 50 percent of your vested pension benefit,
if it’s more than $5,000. (If your vested benefit is less than $5,000, you
can do what you want with it.) For your spouse to be entitled to the
50 percent, however, the plan can require that the two of you were 
married at least one year prior to your death.
Under the PPA, your plan has to provide the right to elect a 75 percent
survivor annuity if you and your spouse prefer that option to the 50 per-
cent survivor annuity. But the cost of this option is that the plan will pay
lower benefits during your life; in other words, your spouse receives
more if she outlives you, but you receive less while you’re alive.
 You and your spouse can waive the 50 percent entitlement, but you
both have to agree to it. (You find out more about waiving rights later
in this chapter.)
In the following sections, we discuss some additional fundamentals of survivor-
ship benefits, such as the basics of annuities, the plans that offer survivorship
benefits, the ways to find the details of such benefits, and the process of 
designating a beneficiary for such benefits.
Focusing on annuity fundamentals
To understand survivorship benefits, you need a basic grasp of the concept
of annuities. An annuity provides a series of regular payments under a con-
tract paid over a period of years.
In defined benefit plans, the benefit formula tells you how much the annuity is
worth. If you start the annuity before the plan’s normal retirement age, it may
be reduced to reflect the longer period of payout. In a defined contribution
plan that offers an annuity form of payment, the size of the annuity depends
on the available funds in your account when the annuity is purchased.
202
Part IV: Shielding Your Pension from Life’s Ups and Downs 

Here are some basics about annuities:
 The amount of the annuity depends on the value of your pension at the
time that the annuity is purchased. In other words, your vested benefits
determine the dollar value of your particular pension. (Chapter 7 has
more information about vesting.) The annuity payments are based on
the current lump sum value of your benefit and a projection of the 
interest that the plan will earn on the funds while it’s paying you your
benefits.
 You have to meet the plan’s eligibility requirements to get pension bene-
fits. (See Chapter 7 for more about eligibility.)
 Some pension plans will subsidize your annuity in some form or another
(we discuss subsidized annuities later in this chapter).
 Several types of annuities exist, including these:
• Fixed-period annuities: These annuities provide definite benefit
amounts at regular times for a fixed period of time (such as 20 years)
and can end before your death.
• Annuities for a single life: With these annuities, you receive regu-
lar payments for your life, and they end at your death. In other
words, when you die, your benefits can’t be passed on to a spouse
or other loved one.
• Joint and survivor annuities: These annuities provide payments
for the lives of two people (in this case, these people are called
annuitants). The first annuitant receives a fixed amount during his
life. After he dies, the surviving annuitant receives the same amount
or a smaller amount at regular intervals for the rest of her life.
(We cover these types of annuities in detail later in this chapter.)
 Before January 1, 2007, you had to choose the type of payment within
30 to 90 days prior to the beginning of your first payment. With the
enactment of the PPA, and after January 1, 2007, you now have 30 to
180 days prior to the payment commencement date to elect a payment
option (such as one of the different types of annuities or a lump sum;
see Chapter 9 for more about lump sums).
Knowing which plans offer which benefits
Only certain plans are required to offer survivorship benefits and annuities.
Here’s a list of the survivorship benefits that each of the different plans offer:
 Defined benefit plans must offer post- and preretirement survivor
annuities. Keep in mind that the survivor annuity rules cover only 
benefits that you (the employee) were entitled to and that you were
actually vested in before death. Vested benefits are those benefits that
you’re entitled to receive from the plan.
203
Chapter 14: Surveying Survivorship Benefits

 Defined contribution plans don’t have to offer survivor annuities in
all circumstances. If your defined contribution plan doesn’t provide for
an annuity form of payment (meaning that you’ll receive your retirement
benefits in a lump sum), the plan doesn’t have to offer a survivorship
benefit. If, however, one of the benefit options under your plan is an
annuity for your life, and that’s the option you choose, the qualified and
joint survivor annuity rules apply (we cover this type of annuity later in
this chapter).
Defined contribution plans that require mandatory employer contribu-
tions (such as money purchase plans or the very rare target benefit
plans) must offer annuity forms of benefit and survivor annuities.
Defined contribution plans such as 401(k) plans, profit-sharing plans,
and stock bonus plans may choose to offer an annuity as an optional
form of benefit. Any plan that provides for any type of annuity must also
provide for survivor annuities.
In a profit-sharing plan, your spouse has no right to your benefits prior
to your death, but he or she is entitled to 100 percent of them after
you die.
 Your spouse has no rights in individual retirement accounts (IRAs),
SIMPLE IRAs, or SEPs (see Chapter 5 for more about these types of
plans).
For plans that offer an annuity form of payment, the plan can’t pay you your
benefits without your spouse’s consent, and your spouse is entitled to 50 per-
cent of the benefits at the time of your death. For plans that don’t offer an
annuity form of payment, the plan can pay you your benefits without your
spouse’s consent, but your spouse is entitled to 100 percent of the benefits
when you die.
Finding out the details of your benefits
Survivorship rights are tricky, and they all have financial implications that
aren’t always apparent. Because of this difficulty, the law requires your plan
to give you (and your spouse) an explanation of the various survivorship
options in your plan documents (see Chapter 8 for details about these 
documents). The law also requires your plan to explain the relative value of
the different options, such as a 50 percent or a 75 percent survivor annuity.
Your plan also must advise you of the eligibility requirements and must tell
you whether the plan subsidizes any of the options (when there’s no change
in cost to you because the plan is making up the difference). Generally speak-
ing, you’re entitled to all this information before the annuity starts.
The written explanation provided by your plan must meet the following
requirements:
204
Part IV: Shielding Your Pension from Life’s Ups and Downs 

 It must explain your rights to waive the qualified joint and survivor
annuity (we discuss waivers later in this chapter).
 The explanation of the impact of the various options must be written in
a way intended to be understood by the average plan participant.
 It must provide a comparison of the value of your choices, and the 
comparisons must show the financial impact of the optional benefits at
various time periods (for instance, in the middle and at the end) so you
can see the pattern of the option’s values. You should be able to com-
pare the various benefits without a slide rule and without reference to
tables and charts.
 It should inform you of the amount that you can expect under a normal
benefit, such as a single life annuity.
 If you choose to waive the qualified joint and survivor annuity, your spouse
must consent, in writing, on a spousal consent form provided by your
plan administrator that explains, in plain language, the effect of a waiver.
Your spouse’s consent must acknowledge the effect of this waiver.
Now that you know you’re entitled to this information, make sure you have it
and understand the financial impact of your survivorship options before you
and your spouse make any decision. This information is mandated, so only
plan oversight or error would explain your failure to receive it. A request to
the plan administrator should correct the problem.
If your plan fully subsidizes the survivorship benefit, the plan generally doesn’t
need to provide the explanation. You find out more about subsidies later in
this chapter.
Designating your beneficiary
Your plan has a designation of beneficiary form that’s available from your human
resources department or pension office. It’s in your best interest to fill out the
form as soon as you know who you want to designate as your beneficiary. This
way, if you’re hit by the proverbial truck on your way home from work, your
beneficiary will be protected. You also must keep the form current because as
a result of death or divorce, your beneficiary can change. Without a completed
designated beneficiary form, your spouse is automatically your beneficiary.
The PPA made some changes regarding distributions to non-spouse bene-
ficiaries. For example, the PPA allows a plan participant’s retirement benefits
to be rolled over not only by a spouse, but also by a domestic partner or
any other non-spouse beneficiary, such as siblings, parents, and children.
Before the PPA, only you or your spouse could roll benefits over to an IRA
(see Chapter 5 for more about IRAs). Now the surviving partner (or other
beneficiary) can avoid taxes by rolling over the pension benefit to an IRA.
The benefit can be distributed over the beneficiary’s life.
205
Chapter 14: Surveying Survivorship Benefits

Under the old rule, the plan could require that a participant’s pension be taken
as a lump sum, resulting in immediate taxes. In this case, the pension could
put the survivor into a much larger tax bracket because it would be considered
taxable income to the surviving beneficiary in the year that it was distributed.
Plans aren’t required to provide for rollovers by non-spouse beneficiaries. If
your employer’s plan doesn’t provide for this option, ask your employer to
amend the plan to include rollovers for non-spouse beneficiaries.
Spelling Out the ABCs of Specific
Survivor Annuities
How much your spouse can receive when you die depends on the following
factors:
 Whether you die before or after eligibility for retirement
 If you die before retirement, whether you were eligible to retire at the
time you died
 Whether your pension plan is a defined benefit or a defined contribu-
tion plan
 The percentage of survivorship benefits you and your spouse choose
Based on these factors, you can have one of the following survivor annuities
provided by ERISA:
 A qualified joint and survivor annuity (QJSA)
 A qualified preretirement survivor annuity (QPSA)
We discuss the features of both types of survivor annuities in the following
sections.
The qualified joint and survivor annuity
If you, the plan participant, are alive on the annuity starting date (the date you’re
entitled to begin receiving your benefit payments), the annuity is known as a
qualified joint and survivor annuity (QJSA). In other words, this type of annu-
ity typically kicks in if you die after you retire. In the following sections, we
explain the amount and timing of benefits that a spouse receives with a QJSA.
206
Part IV: Shielding Your Pension from Life’s Ups and Downs 

The following changes take effect January 1, 2008, under the PPA (if you’re
part of a collectively bargained plan, these options are mandated after the
earlier date of January 1, 2009, or the expiration of the current contract):
 If a plan provides for the automatic 50 percent survivorship benefit, the
plan must provide the choice for participants to elect a 75 percent bene-
fit option.
 If the plan already offers a 75 percent option, it must provide an option
to elect a 50 percent survivorship benefit.
The amount of benefits
A QJSA is an annuity or series of payments paid over your life and your
spouse’s life if you die after you retire. Because a QJSA takes into account
your life as well as that of your spouse (who will continue to receive benefits
after you die), the amount of these payments to you will be smaller than if
they were going to be paid for only your lifetime.
However, after you die, the plan must provide an annuity to your spouse in
payments no less than 50 percent of the amount payable to you while you
were alive. For example, imagine that your annuity was $2,500 a month while
you were alive. After your death, your spouse gets one half of that amount, or
$1,250.
Even though the minimum payment to a surviving spouse is 50 percent, some
pension plans do provide for survivor monthly payments of up to 100 per-
cent of the monthly benefit that the plan participant received while he or
she was alive.
Some pension plans do this for everyone automatically. Other plans give you
a choice. But in such plans, the higher the survivorship benefit, the lower the
benefit during the life of you, the employee. Generally, under the PPA, all
plans subject to these rules must offer both 50 percent and 75 percent sur-
vivor annuity options.
The timing of benefits
While you’re alive, you’re entitled to receive payments as soon as you
reach the earliest retirement age under your plan. If your plan provides for
voluntary distributions when you leave the company, however, you could
leave the company and receive a payment. In that case, the plan documents
must be reviewed to determine how soon you would be eligible to receive
your pension.
207
Chapter 14: Surveying Survivorship Benefits

The qualified preretirement survivor annuity
If you, the plan participant, die before the annuity starting date (in other
words, typically before retirement), and if you have vested benefits from either
employee or employer contributions to your plan, your spouse is entitled to
receive survivorship benefits in the form of a qualified preretirement survivor
annuity (QPSA). A QPSA is an annuity for the life of your surviving spouse.
The calculation of the QPSA depends on when you die and on what type of
pension plan you have. In the following sections, we outline several scenarios
in which a spouse receives a QPSA.
Death after reaching the earliest retirement 
age in a defined benefit plan
If you die after reaching the earliest permitted retirement age in your plan
(but before you’ve actually retired), the payment to your surviving spouse
under the QPSA can’t be less than the survivor payment that your spouse
would have received if you had retired with a QJSA the day before you died.
(We explain QJSA basics earlier in this chapter.)
For example, assume that your plan at Intergalactic Shipping is a defined ben-
efit plan that required you to work ten years and reach age 55 before retiring.
Also assume that you died on August 2 (before you actually got around to
retiring) after working 12 years and after reaching age 55.
Because you could have retired after working ten years, and because you had
already reached age 55, you died after the earliest date that you could have
retired. So, for purposes of calculating your spouse’s survivorship benefits,
your plan pretends that you retired with a QJSA on the day before you actually
died — August 1. For your surviving spouse, then, the QJSA is worth 50 percent
of what you would have received while alive. In other words, your surviving
spouse will get 50 percent of what you would have been eligible to receive
after working 12 years and retiring with a QJSA. For instance, if you were 
entitled to $1,000 per month, your spouse will get $500 per month for life.
Death before reaching the earliest retirement 
age in a defined benefit plan
If you die before you reach the earliest permitted retirement age in your
defined benefit plan, the payment will be based on the assumption that you
lived until the earliest permitted retirement date. But remember, your benefi-
ciary can’t receive an annuity until the date when you could have first retired.
In this example, we change the facts slightly from the previous one, but do
presume that the plan’s requirements of working ten years and reaching age
55 stay the same. This time, however, assume that you die after working eight
years at Intergalactic Shipping.
208
Part IV: Shielding Your Pension from Life’s Ups and Downs 

In this scenario, the plan assumes that you left service at the date of death
but lived until the earliest time that you could have retired. So, the retirement
annuity is calculated on your working eight years and surviving to year ten.
But remember that your spouse has to wait two years before the annuity is
payable since that’s the earliest you could have retired if you had lived.
The amount your spouse receives is still 50 percent of what you would have
received, but retiring at the earliest time permitted (depending on the plans
rules) ordinarily results in a reduced benefit for a plan participant. Therefore,
your spouse receives 50 percent of a lower annuity.
If your surviving spouse doesn’t live the two years until you would have been
eligible to take your retirement, your defined benefit plan can deem the bene-
fit forfeited (in other words, that money couldn’t subsequently be passed on
to another beneficiary). Similarly, if your spouse chose to delay the payment
of the annuity until five years after your death and he or she suddenly died in
the fourth year, the plan can cancel the annuity.
Differences in a defined contribution plan
If you’re in a defined contribution plan, you need to be aware of some of its
differences when it comes to annuities:
 If your defined contribution plan has an annuity option, the preretire-
ment survivor annuity must have a value that’s at least 50 percent of
your vested account balance as of the date of your death.
 Your account balance can’t be lost — even if your surviving spouse dies
before the money in the account is used to purchase the annuity.
Your vested account balance in a defined contribution plan is your money.
If you die before you receive all your benefits in a defined contribution
plan, the balance in your account will be paid to your beneficiaries.
 The plan must permit your surviving spouse to direct the plan to pay
the money within a reasonable time after your death.
Now let’s assume that you work at Suburban Canoe and have a defined con-
tribution plan. At the time of your death, you have $200,000 in your account.
An annuity can be purchased for your survivor with the $200,000, or the sur-
vivor can direct that a lump sum payment of $200,000 be paid.
Subsidized annuities
An annuity for two lives ordinarily is more expensive to buy than an annuity
for one life. Your plan ordinarily passes this cost on to you by paying you less
while you’re alive if you have a survivorship benefit. However, if your plan
wants to, it can fully subsidize your QJSA or QPSA survivorship benefits.
209
Chapter 14: Surveying Survivorship Benefits

When your plan subsidizes your benefits you’ll experience no decrease in the
benefits. This is because your plan is making up the difference between the
cost of an annuity for one life and the extra cost of an annuity for two lives
(referred to as subsidizing the benefit) out of the plan’s pocket.
For example, with a fully subsidized QJSA, if your annuity pays you $100 per
month, the survivorship benefit is guaranteed not to decrease when you die.
So, your spouse can also count on receiving $100 per month.
If your company offers this benefit (your plan documents will explain the
benefit if that’s the case), it obviously loves its employees.
Steps for a beneficiary to take when
received payments are incorrect
If a beneficiary’s survivorship benefits are incorrect, the first step is to notify
the plan administrator and ask for a correction. Your beneficiary should pro-
vide any documents or other items in possession to fully explain why he or
she believes the benefit amount is incorrect.
If your beneficiary isn’t persuasive enough and the plan administrator won’t
budge, the next step is to file an administrative appeal. The administrative
appeal is done in-house to the plan administrator or whoever is designated to
handle such matters. Remember that there are specific time periods to follow
regarding how the appeal is handled. See Chapter 18 for more about appeals.
If your beneficiary still can’t get any satisfaction and the administrative
appeal is denied, the last resort is filing a lawsuit. These are the same rights
that plan participants have. We explain the litigation process in Chapter 20.
“Waiving” Goodbye to 
Survivorship Benefits
Before the REA came on the scene in 1984 (we describe its arrival earlier in
this chapter), you, the plan participant, could waive spousal survivorship
benefits without first notifying or getting permission from your spouse.
However, after the REA’s enactment, spousal consent became a requirement.
So now, by law, you can’t give up your spouse’s right to receive survivorship
benefits unless your spouse first signs a waiver with respect to such benefits.
In the following sections, we discuss reasons to waive benefits, explain what
needs to be in a waiver, and cover circumstances in which a waiver may be
challenged.
210
Part IV: Shielding Your Pension from Life’s Ups and Downs 

Checking out reasons to waive 
survivorship benefits
Survivorship benefits aren’t for everyone. In the following list, we review the
reasons why you may want to waive them:
 If your spouse has more than enough money to support himself or herself
after you die, it’s probably advantageous for you to waive the spousal
survivor annuity, because then you’ll be able to receive the maximum
annuity payment. (If your spouse is set to receive survivorship benefits,
you’ll receive a smaller benefit amount each month once you retire.)
 If the same financial protection can be provided to your surviving
spouse at a lower cost through the purchase of an insurance policy on
your life (rather than through a joint annuity), consider waiving the
spousal survivor annuity. By taking out an insurance policy at a lower
cost, you’re saving money, and you’ll receive more money down the road
(as we explain in the previous bullet).
 If it’s unlikely that your spouse will outlive you (because of age, health,
or bad genes), it may be a good decision to waive the survivorship bene-
fit because then your annuity won’t be reduced later.
Meeting mandatory requirements 
in a waiver
The QJSA is now automatic unless both you and your spouse waive these
rights. So, if you and your spouse decide that you want to waive the spousal
benefits, your waiver must meet these requirements:
 It must explain the effect of the waiver in easy-to-understand language.
 You must waive the benefit in writing.
 Your spouse must consent to the waiver in writing.
 You must designate a new beneficiary on a form that may not be changed
without the consent of your spouse. If your spouse has signed a waiver
in favor of a specific beneficiary, you can change your designated benefi-
ciary only if your spouse signs a new consent to the waiver. (You can
find out how to designate a beneficiary earlier in this chapter.)
 Your spouse’s consent to waive survivorship rights must acknowledge the
full effect of that decision (for example, your spouse needs to acknowledge
the fact that the waiver will diminish his or her survivorship benefits
that would otherwise apply).
 Your spouse’s consent must be witnessed by a representative of your
plan or it must be notarized.
211
Chapter 14: Surveying Survivorship Benefits

Say you die before you retire and your spouse receives a QPSA. Just as with
the QJSA, if you and your spouse don’t want this benefit, you both must
waive your rights it.
The waiver of a QJSA or a QPSA must be made after the pension plan partici-
pant reaches the age of 35. If a waiver was made before age 35, another one is
necessary after the plan participant reaches age 35.
A spouse’s consent to waive survivorship benefits isn’t required if:
 You have a court order that confirms that your spouse can’t be found.
 Your spouse has been declared incompetent by a court of law and his or
her guardian consents to the waiver.
 You have a court order establishing that you’re legally separated or
abandoned.
The election of a previous spouse as a beneficiary doesn’t have any effect
on the rights of a current spouse. If you and your current spouse haven’t
waived the survivorship benefits, the claim of your current spouse defeats
any beneficiary you named before your marriage to your current spouse.
Challenging a waiver
A waiver can be challenged by your spouse only if the waiver was unclear
and not understood by your spouse at the time of signing or if your spouse
signed under pressure. Otherwise, your spouse can’t revoke the consent to
the waiver. In other words, if a spouse changes his or her mind after waiving
212
Part IV: Shielding Your Pension from Life’s Ups and Downs 
Beware of waivers in prenuptial agreements
In today’s fast-paced world, with a 50 percent
divorce rate, prenuptial agreements are pretty
common. These agreements, which are entered
into prior to marriage, provide for a division of
marital assets in the event of a divorce or death.
Some couples put waivers of survivorship ben-
efits in their prenuptial agreements without
thinking things through legally. In other words,
they don’t realize that these waivers aren’t
valid! If a spouse wants to waive survivorship
rights, he or she has to be a spouse at the time
of the waiver. So, the problem here is that a
waiver of survivorship rights in a prenuptial
agreement is invalid because the waiver wasn’t
signed by your spouse — it was signed by your
soon-to-be spouse (because the signing took
place before the nuptials). Simply put, survivor-
ship rights can’t be waived in a prenuptial
agreement. The solution? Properly execute the
waiver after you’re married.

his or her survivorship benefits (for example, in favor of the kids from the
plan participant’s first marriage), it’s too late!
After the death of the plan participant, however, the surviving spouse may
elect to change the payment schedule of the annuity or to elect a lump sum
payment if it’s in fact permitted by the plan.
Looking at the Impact of 
Life’s Unpleasantries on 
Survivorship Benefits
If it’s not one thing, it’s another. Life is filled with challenges and obstacles,
and while some of these hardships can be anticipated, others can’t. This sec-
tion is an overview of some of life’s low points and how they can impact your
spouse’s survivorship rights.
Your plan is changed or terminated
Many things can happen to a pension plan. For instance, your company may
be sold and the pension plan taken over by another company. Or the plan
may be terminated or become underfunded and not have sufficient assets to
pay the benefits provided under the plan. In these cases, the plan may be taken
over by a government agency called the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
(PBGC). This agency guarantees benefits in defined benefit plans.
If any of the previously mentioned situations happen to come up with your
pension, there are protections for your spouse’s survivor annuity. For exam-
ple, consider the following:
 Even if your company is merged or spun off to a company with a pension
plan that doesn’t offer survivor annuities, your spouse’s annuity is still
good. (For more on mergers, see Chapter 11.)
 If your pension plan is modified or terminated, the survivor annuity
is still good. (For more on plan modifications and terminations, see
Chapter 12.)
 If the PBGC takes over your busted plan, the PBGC will pay your spouse’s
survivorship benefits. (For more on plans going belly up and being taken
over by the PBGC, see Chapter 12.)
213
Chapter 14: Surveying Survivorship Benefits

You have unpaid taxes
You can’t escape Uncle Sam. In other words, if you don’t pay your taxes, the
Internal Revenue Service can place a lien on your ERISA pension benefits to sat-
isfy your unpaid tax liability. However, this authority doesn’t extend to spousal
annuity survivorship benefits (unless the tax lien also applies to your spouse).
So if you want to get your hard-earned money, be sure to pay your taxes.
You go through a divorce
Just when you think that your divorce can’t get any messier, your spouse
decides that he or she wants to claim the survivorship benefits that are due
to him or her. The basic rule in this case is that if your soon-to-be ex-spouse
wants to receive survivorship benefits, he or she must first obtain an order
called a qualified domestic relations order, or QDRO, through the divorce pro-
ceedings. This issue is discussed in much greater detail in Chapter 15.
If you and your spouse separate but don’t actually divorce, your spouse still
gets the survivorship benefits.

I
f you have a pension and are divorced or considering divorce, this chapter
is a must. In the event of a divorce, a state divorce judge decides all the
issues surrounding the divorce, such as custody, alimony, and the division
of assets. Your qualified pension plan is one of those assets that must be
divided between you and your ex. Because the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974 (ERISA; see Chapter 2) preempts and trumps state law,
state court judges can’t divide up pension assets. But Congress, in its vast
wisdom, provided the qualified domestic relations order, or QDRO. A QDRO is
a court order that’s approved by a plan administrator and that divides your
benefits between you and your ex-spouse. It allows a state judge to allocate
federally regulated pension rights subject to a number of restrictions and 
limitations.
If you have a pension governed by ERISA and you get divorced, it’s likely that
you’ll have a QDRO as part of your divorce. If you can’t escape a QDRO, it’s
best to face it head on. So in this chapter, we give you the lowdown on QDROs,
including how they affect you, your ex, and your pension. Be sure to read this
chapter before you meet with your divorce lawyer!

Checking Out the Basics of a Qualified
Domestic Relations Order
As a general rule, ERISA doesn’t allow you to assign or in any way alienate
your interest in your pension plan to somebody else. The purpose of ERISA is
to make sure that your money is still yours when you retire and that it isn’t
lost in that poker match called life. An exception is made for the assignment
of pension benefits through a QDRO.
A QDRO is used exclusively to allocate pension benefits. A QDRO can be created
to allocate pension benefits in a divorce, to provide marital support from a pen-
sion, and to collect unpaid child support. Pension assets are part of what you
and your spouse have accumulated during your marriage and are therefore a
marital asset to be fairly divided in a divorce and available for child support.
Because federal law (through ERISA) controls most private pensions, and state
court judges applying state law grant divorces and arrange for alimony and
child support, the QDRO provides a way for a state court domestic relations
judge to reconcile state and federal law in order to divide pension assets.
The order issued according to state law starts off as a domestic relations order
and then becomes qualified, or a QDRO, only after meeting all the criteria and
being approved by the pension plan trustee or administrator (we walk through
the steps of qualifying an order later in this chapter). It isn’t necessary that
each party (the plan participant or the ex-spouse receiving the benefit)
endorse or approve the QDRO.
In the following sections, we explain a few basic facts about QDROs, such as
the folks they benefit, their common formats, and the details they include.
We also discuss the limitations of a QDRO.
Who benefits from a QDRO?
The QDRO is for the benefit of a person called an alternate payee, which is just
another term for your ex-spouse, soon-to-be ex-spouse, any other ex-spouses,
children, or other dependents. So the QDRO grants benefits not to you, but to
your ex-spouse or dependents. For instance:
 A separation agreement (an order of support while you’re still married)
awarding a portion of your pension benefits to your spouse can be a
QDRO.
 If you have a second divorce, any QDRO in place for your first ex-spouse
can’t be altered or changed. A second QDRO can divide only benefits
that haven’t been allocated in a prior QDRO.
 Any child or other dependent who’s recognized by the court can be 
entitled to all or a portion of your pension benefits. The QDRO can
216
Part IV: Shielding Your Pension from Life’s Ups and Downs 

order the benefits to be paid to a state child support agency on behalf of a
child, but the child, not the agency, is still the alternate payee. The QDRO
can be used to pay child support even if no divorce is pending.
What are the different forms of a QDRO?
QDROs are used to either divide marital property or provide support pay-
ments. These different objectives can result in different choices regarding the
method used to divide the assets in your pension plan. Here are the two
basic approaches to dividing retirement benefits through a QDRO:
 Separate interest: In this method, the QDRO divides the plan partici-
pant’s retirement benefit into two separate portions. This allows the
alternate payee the ability to receive a portion of the retirement benefit
at a different time and in a different form from that chosen by the plan
participant. The funds can be paid out to the alternate payee before the
earliest retirement date if the plan permits such a payout.
 Shared payment: In this method, the alternate payee doesn’t receive
any payments until the plan participant is eligible to begin to receive
payments. The benefit payments are split, with a portion paid to the
alternate payee and a portion paid to the participant.
Either of these approaches can be used for support purposes, for the division
of marital assets, or to allocate benefits from a plan, depending on the type of
retirement plan you have:
 Many defined contribution plans permit a lump-sum distribution from
the plan to be paid to the alternate payee when the QDRO is approved.
 Defined benefit plans often permit distributions to an alternate payee
only when the plan participant is also receiving his or her plan benefits.
See Chapter 3 for details on the differences between these plans.
217
Chapter 15: Dividing Your Pension between You and Your Ex
Doling out benefits to your ex if your 
plan isn’t covered by ERISA
If you get a divorce and your pension plan isn’t
covered by ERISA (which includes most if not all
government employees, schoolteachers, and
other public employees), your pension assets
will be handled differently depending on the
state you live in. Most states, however, have
implemented procedures similar to the QDRO to
provide for the distribution of pension benefits
to the ex-spouse. Your divorce lawyer can tell
you what the pension divorce distribution rules
are for your state and how they impact your
pension.

What information appears in a QDRO?
Any QDRO must include all of the following information:
 The last known name and address of the pension plan participant.
 The last known name and address of the alternate payee (spouse, ex-
spouse, or child or dependent).
 The amount or percentage of the participant’s benefit that’s payable to
the alternate payee or the method used to calculate the amount or per-
centage to be paid.
 The number of payments or the period to which this QDRO applies.
(An order to pay the benefits immediately takes care of this
requirement if the plan permits lump-sum distributions.)
 Identifying information for each pension plan to which the QDRO applies.
(Keep in mind that it’s possible to have more than one pension plan.)
 Information noting that the order is a court judgment, decree, or order.
 Information showing that the order is issued by a court of competent
jurisdiction and is signed by the judge.
What can’t a QDRO do?
The power of the QDRO is limited. To a large degree it’s confined by the
terms of your pension plan. But here are the basics. The QDRO can’t
 Require the pension plan to pay benefits that aren’t provided under the
plan. For example, if the plan provides benefits only in the form of an
annuity, the QDRO can’t require the plan to pay benefits to your ex-
spouse in a single lump sum payment. If, however, the plan provides for
a choice between an annuity and a lump sum under the separate interest
approach, each of you can make a different choice.
 Increase the benefits otherwise provided under the plan.
 Require the plan to change actuarial assumptions. Actuarial assumptions
are factors used by actuaries to project future financial conclusions, and
they may take into account life expectancies as well as interest rates in
order to make certain calculations.
 Change the QDRO benefits provided to an earlier payee when another
payee comes into the picture. For example, your second ex-spouse can’t
get any of your pension benefits previously awarded by a QDRO to your
first ex-spouse.
 Make one alternate payee pay another alternate payee. The QDRO can’t,
for instance, require your pension plan to pay your ex-spouse’s current
spouse or a subsequent ex-spouse of your ex-spouse.
218
Part IV: Shielding Your Pension from Life’s Ups and Downs 

 Provide for a payment earlier than the date the plan received the order.
In a shared payment, the QDRO can’t give your ex a payment before the
earliest date that you’ll reach retirement age or an earlier date permitted
by the plan.
Your earliest retirement age is the earlier of these two dates:
• The earliest date you can take a distribution under the plan
• The date you reach 50 or the first date you could get benefits if you
left work (whichever is later)
Qualifying a Domestic Relations Order
To transform itself from just an order by a domestic relations judge to a
QDRO, the order must be qualified. By qualification, we mean that before an
order can divide pension benefits, it must conform to the various safeguards
in place to protect federally regulated pensions. Until it’s qualified, the order
has no effect on your pension and no money can be distributed. The plan
administrator disperses the money and determines whether the domestic
relations order graduates to become a QDRO.
In the following sections, we show you the steps required to carry out the
qualification of a domestic relations order.
Sending the order to the plan administrator
Because the QDRO must be consistent with the terms of your divorce decree
or settlement, the attorney who’s responsible for preparing the proposed
QDRO needs to make sure that the language and terms of the QDRO reflect
your settlement agreement. Your attorney and your spouse’s attorney will
negotiate how your retirement benefits will be allocated and which attorney
will prepare the QDRO. Usually the attorney who prepares it makes sure that
your plan administrator gets a copy of the proposed QDRO after it’s issued
and signed by the court.
Knowing everyone’s responsibilities 
during the qualification process
Different people with different responsibilities play roles in the process of
qualifying a domestic relations order. In the following sections, we outline
the duties of the plan administrator and the plan participant (that’s you, of
course). Chapter 2 has more information about the general duties of a plan
administrator.
219
Chapter 15: Dividing Your Pension between You and Your Ex

The responsibilities of the plan administrator
A plan administrator has several important duties during the qualification
process:
 The administrator provides a copy of the QDRO procedures that are in
place for your pension plan and advises everyone involved of their
rights to receive all correspondence regarding the QDRO. The possible
alternate payee is entitled to all relevant plan documents and your bene-
fit statements. Your attorney needs this information to draft the QDRO.
 Of course, the administrator is in charge of determining the validity of
the order. To accomplish this task, the administrator must review the
QDRO and make sure that it clearly identifies the plan that the order
covers, that it provides only benefits permitted under the plan, that the
benefits are going to a person entitled to them, and that it specifies the
number of payments and the method of determining the amount of the
payments. To assist in this process, the administrator may send the
QDRO to the plan’s attorney to determine whether the QDRO meets all
the necessary requirements for qualification. The administrator should
make every effort to avoid unnecessary expenses and adopt policies
that are designed to make the administrative process more efficient.
 The QDRO review should be completed within 60 days. If an attorney, at
the request of the administrator, has to review the QDRO, the review
should be completed within 75 working days of receipt of the QDRO.
You and any alternate payees are entitled to be notified in writing of the
reason for the delay and the decision date of the validly of the QDRO.
 After a QDRO is determined to be valid, the plan administrator must
implement the QDRO in conformity with the plan provisions.
 According to ERISA, the plan administrator is responsible for making
sure that the alternate payee receives the same information that you,
the plan participant, receive — even if the plan is terminated.
Your responsibilities as a plan participant
Your first responsibility is to provide your attorney with any and all plan doc-
uments and plan information regarding your retirement benefits so that he or
she better understands what you’re entitled to. It’s difficult to resolve prop-
erty and support issues if your attorney doesn’t have an appreciation of the
extent of your assets; your pension benefits are part of those assets, and a
QDRO can’t be properly drafted without such information.
Your second responsibility is to make sure that your plan administrator
knows of any special circumstances, such as other QDROs you may have with
a prior spouse. You should continue to provide information that may affect
the QDRO as it becomes available.
You also need to do the following:
220
Part IV: Shielding Your Pension from Life’s Ups and Downs 

 It’s important that you and the alternate payees make sure that the plan
administrator has copies of any orders amending the QDRO. If the plan
administrator isn’t aware that the QDRO has been amended, it will pre-
vent him or her from properly complying with the QDRO.
 You have an ongoing obligation to give the administrator your current
address and to provide releases for necessary information that the
administrator may require.
 It’s your responsibility to submit information you believe may be impor-
tant to the plan administrator. And you have to do this within 15 days of
receiving the initial receipt letter.
 You’re responsible for all the administrative expenses of qualifying an
order. If the plan incurs expenses in processing or administering your
QDRO, your account could be charged as long as the expenses are rea-
sonable. Any charges must be explained to you in advance. This is the
current position of the Department of Labor, which reverses an earlier
position that stated that QDRO charges couldn’t be charged to your pen-
sion account. Now, if the plan so chooses, it can pass these costs on to
you, the plan participant.
Consider yourself forewarned! The agencies that issue the rules can and
do change their minds.
Following up with the qualification decision
In the following sections, we explain what happens after an order is or isn’t
qualified. If your plan administrator approved the order, it’s determined to be
qualified, and this means that the plan administrator has certain tasks to do.
If the QDRO isn’t approved (and therefore not qualified), the plan administra-
tor must notify the parties and segregate the funds that would have been 
subject to the QDRO.
Implementing a qualified order
If the plan administrator determines that the QDRO is qualified, the following
steps must be followed to implement the order:
1. The plan administrator sends a qualification letter via first-class mail
to you (the plan participant) and each alternate payee, stating the
amount of the benefit and when it will be available for distribution.
2. Payments begin as provided for in the QDRO.
Before payments begin, however, the plan administrator must have a
copy of the signed court order by the domestic relations judge. One of
the things you pay your attorney to do is to make sure that the plan
administrator receives the right documents in a timely manner.
221
Chapter 15: Dividing Your Pension between You and Your Ex

The payments under a QDRO stop either when the QDRO says they stop or
upon receipt of a court order that terminates the payments. If you’re the plan
participant and you die, payments to your ex-spouse stop unless the QDRO
provides for survivorship benefits. The QDRO should also state what happens
to the benefits if your ex dies before you. (See the later section “What if my
ex dies?” for more information on survivorship benefits.)
If language in the QDRO would terminate the benefits under certain conditions
such as a new marriage, it’s your responsibility to notify the plan administra-
tor so the appropriate modification can be made.
Determining that an order isn’t qualified
If the plan administrator decides that the proposed QDRO isn’t qualified, a
disqualification letter is sent by first-class mail to you (the plan participant)
and each alternate payee. This letter lists the reasons the proposed QDRO
doesn’t meet the standards for qualification.
If the plan administrator approves an order that doesn’t meet the requirements
for qualification, the mistake can result in sanctions such as plan disqualifica-
tion (meaning that the plan could lose its tax-deferred status). So, your plan
administrator needs to make sure any order received properly meets the
requirements for qualification before he or she approves it.
Disputing the validity of an order
If you question the validity of the QDRO, payouts won’t begin until the dis-
pute is resolved. The following actions occur at this time:
1. The assets being disputed with the QDRO should be segregated by the
plan administrator.
The segregated assets are those monies that are subject to being paid
from your pension plan to your ex-spouse if the QDRO had been deter-
mined to be qualified.
2. After the assets are separated, they’re placed in an escrow or special-
ized distribution account.
The money is held in safekeeping in this special account until it’s
decided where it should go and who gets it.
3. If the QDRO is determined to be valid and qualified, the administrator
pays your ex the segregated money, plus interest, at the time the pay-
ments are to begin.
If payments to your ex-spouse should have already begun, the first 
payment becomes due on or after the date the qualification is made.
After the payments begin, no future accrued benefits go to your ex.
4. If after 18 months the QDRO still hasn’t been qualified by the adminis-
trator, the administrator must pay the assets back to the plan, or to
you if you’re retired, as though an order hadn’t been provided to the
plan administrator.
222
Part IV: Shielding Your Pension from Life’s Ups and Downs 

Reviewing an order all over again
Some circumstances can cause the plan administrator to make a new review
of the qualification of a QDRO after an initial determination of its validity has
been made. Here are examples of these instances:
 If no payments are made to the ex-spouse or alternate payees for an
extended period of time after the QDRO is qualified, another determination
or qualification may be made before payments begin. The administrator,
for example, may have lost the QDRO or may have failed to process it in
a timely fashion. If changes were made to the plan documents during the
intervening time period, the QDRO must comply with these changes.
 If the QDRO is amended, the administrator must determine its qualified
status, as amended.
Handling Taxes on Qualified 
Domestic Relations Orders
Whether you expected it or not, you have to remember that Uncle Sam socks
you with taxes when you receive benefits under a QDRO. The following are
some important tax effects on QDRO distributions:
 Federal income tax must be withheld from the designated distribution
under the QDRO unless you elect not to have the withholding rules
applied. The withholding rules are applied for a QDRO as if the alternate
payee were the employee.
 Your ex-spouse may roll over an eligible QDRO distribution to an IRA or
other qualified plan.
 For eligible rollover distributions payable under a QDRO to a spouse or
ex-spouse, federal income tax is required to be withheld at a 20 percent
rate unless the distribution is paid (rolled over) directly to another qual-
ified plan or to an IRA. (Chapter 5 has information about IRAs; Chapter 9
has more information about rollovers.)
 Distributions to an ex-spouse are taxable to the ex.
 Distributions under a QDRO to a non-spouse alternate payee (a child, for
example) will be taxable to you and can’t be rolled over by the alternate
payee. These distributions also aren’t subject to the 20 percent with-
holding rules.
 If the QDRO orders child support paid to your ex, it’s taxable to your ex.
However, if the child support is paid to your child, it’s taxable to you.
For general rules about tax effects on pension distributions, check out
Chapter 9.

Chapter 15: Dividing Your Pension between You and Your Ex

Protecting Your Rights If You’re the Ex
If you’re trying to tap into your ex’s pension plan, remember this: Until the plan
administrator approves the QDRO, it’s just you and your attorney attempting
to navigate the complex world of pensions. To protect your rights, you must
be extra vigilant. So, in the following sections, we explain how you, the soon-
to-be former spouse, can protect your rights to your ex’s pension benefits.
Ensuring that your divorce attorney is
familiar with pensions and QDROs
Many attorneys aren’t familiar with the drafting of QDROs. In fact, many attor-
neys rely on outside consultants to assist them in the preparation of your
QDRO. Even though receiving outside help may mean that your QDRO meets
all the technical hurdles of the qualification process, it also means that your
attorney may not have obtained all the pension benefits that you were enti-
tled to receive. Some plans offer early retirement benefits or other options
that can increase the value of the plan. If a QDRO doesn’t take these features
into account, the administrator isn’t going to pay them to you if they kick in.
Your attorney must be sophisticated enough to understand the impact of
benefit provisions that may be obscure or not easily recognizable in order to
make sure that they’re factored into the equation.
To protect yourself, find out from your attorney how many QDROs he has
drafted or whether he has a consultant prepare them. Also make sure that
your attorney is aware of the type of benefits that your ex’s plan provides (or
that he can find out). Here are some questions you can ask your attorney:
 How will I be impacted if my ex dies?
 What happens if I remarry?
 Can my ex do anything to stop my benefits after the proposed QDRO
becomes a court order and is qualified by the plan administrator?
 What happens if my ex fails to apply for a pension, is injured, or waives
his or her pension?
As we point out in Chapter 19, for your attorney to be effective, he first must
be knowledgeable. In fact, when you first interview a prospective attorney, it’s
perfectly reasonable to determine what your attorney knows about QDROs,
because if your spouse has a pension, it’s going to be involved in the divorce.
224
Part IV: Shielding Your Pension from Life’s Ups and Downs 

The attorney is supposed to have answers to these all-important questions,
so consider yourself forewarned if he can’t answer them.
Obtaining plan information
You and your attorney have the right to receive all the documents from your
ex’s plan. This includes the summary plan description (SPD), which is a con-
densed version of the full plan document. You and your attorney also have a
right to the entire plan and all its amendments (as opposed to just the SPD).
To draft a proposed QDRO (which may be your attorney’s responsibility to
prepare), your attorney needs to know the type of plan that your ex-spouse
participates in (defined benefit or defined contribution; see Chapter 3 for
more details) and be familiar with the plan’s provisions and benefits. It’s pos-
sible that the SPD and the plan document may be inconsistent, and if that’s
the case, make sure that your attorney knows how to resolve the inconsisten-
cies if she’s drafting the QDRO.
You need to know the procedure that your ex’s plan has for handling QDROs.
And remember that your attorney needs to have this information from the
benefits office before the QDRO is drafted. If the plan has a procedure in
place to expedite qualification of the QDRO, your attorney should follow
the procedure (if she’s drafting the QDRO) or make sure that your ex-
spouse’s attorney is following the procedure (if she’s not responsible for
drafting it). Your attorney should also get any model QDROs from the plan
administrator and feel free to call the plan administrator, who generally is
helpful in answering questions. In addition, many plans are willing to take a
look at a proposed domestic relations order before it’s presented to your
domestic relations judge.
The number of years your soon-to-be-ex has worked for the company, his or
her salary, and the plan amendments can all impact the value of the pension
benefits. So we recommend that you and your attorney retain an expert to
review all the plan documents to determine the true value of the available
retirement benefits. There are pension gurus out there who know the ins
and outs of pensions and can assist your attorney in analyzing your plan and
ferreting out some less-than-obvious provisions that can affect the cash value
of the pension. The whole point of the QDRO is to allocate pension benefits,
but before you can even begin to divvy up the pot, you have to know what
it’s worth.
225
Chapter 15: Dividing Your Pension between You and Your Ex

Asking a few “what if” questions
In the following sections, we answer some important “what if” questions that
you, the soon-to-be ex, may ask during the QDRO qualification process. Some
situations may be more likely to occur than others; you should be prepared
for them and understand their consequences.
What if my ex’s pension plan fails?
As an alternate payee, you’ll receive a proportionally reduced benefit if
your former spouse’s plan tanks or can’t pay the benefits that have been
promised. Here’s why: A failed pension plan may be insured by the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), which is an agency that insures tax-
qualified defined benefit pension plans up to a certain amount. (Flip to
Chapter 3 for more on tax-qualified plans.) Defined contribution plans aren’t
generally covered by the PBGC. If your ex-spouse’s pension plan is under the
jurisdiction of the PBGC (meaning that it’s likely a defined benefit plan in
which the benefits are insured), any domestic relations order needs to be
approved by the PBGC.
In the event of a plan bankruptcy, the PBGC will proportionately adjust the
benefits to take into account the reduced benefits provided by the PBGC (as
long as no provisions prohibit this adjustment). When the PBGC has to take
over a failed plan, it usually provides only a portion of the benefits that the
pensioner would otherwise receive. When the PBGC takes over a plan in
which the plan administrator has already determined a QDRO to be qualified,
but before any payments are made, the PBGC must also evaluate the order to
see if it qualifies as a QDRO.
Chapter 12 has the full scoop on failed pension plans and the PBGC.
What if my ex has more than one pension?
Keep in mind that if your ex has a 401(k), was in a defined benefit plan from
a previous job, or has retirement savings, all these plans will be part of a
QDRO. It’s critical for your attorney, then, not only to assemble all your ex’s
pensions, but also to thoroughly understand their features. For example, he
needs to know answers to questions like “Does the plan provide for a cost-of-
living adjustment?” and “Does your ex have the right to early retirement ben-
efits or to receive benefits in a lump sum?” If the plan provides for benefit
increases that the QDRO doesn’t take into account, the plan administrator
won’t pay out such increases. In short, if all the benefits aren’t determined
before the QDRO is qualified, you may be shortchanged. So, you should make
sure that your attorney has all the documents necessary to ferret out all the
goodies in your ex’s plans.
226
Part IV: Shielding Your Pension from Life’s Ups and Downs 

What if my ex dies?
Make sure survivorship benefits are included in your ex’s plan. Otherwise you
may be in for an extra shock if your ex dies prematurely. In other words, if
survivorship benefits aren’t included, your payments stop.
The qualified joint and survivor annuity (QJSA) is the procedure put in place
to provide benefits to a spouse after a pensioner dies. But the QDRO is so
powerful that it can defeat a subsequent spouse’s survivorship right under
the pension plan. The QDRO generally coordinates with the QJSA annuity
requirements that exist at the time the QDRO takes effect to protect the
retirement rights of the former spouse (you) as well as the current spouse
(your ex’s new partner). If survivorship rights are made a part of your QDRO,
a new spouse won’t be able to get a survivorship benefit because it was
already guaranteed to you, the former spouse, by the QDRO.
Here are three situations that could change who receives the survivorship
benefit under the QJSA:
 If the plan participant dies, the plan pays the surviving spouse a
monthly survivorship benefit unless the QDRO specifies otherwise.
 If the plan participant dies after a divorce, the divorced spouse loses the
survivorship protection unless it’s preserved by the QDRO.
 If the plan participant remarries after a first divorce, the new spouse
gets the survivorship benefit unless the QDRO states otherwise.
But a QDRO can change these results. The QDRO can award the survivorship
benefit to the former spouse. For instance, if you didn’t waive your survivor-
ship rights to your ex-spouse’s pension plan while you were married, your
QDRO can provide that you, the alternate payee, be treated as the surviving
spouse for purposes of survivorship benefits. So, the QDRO can defeat the
survivorship rights of your ex’s current spouse in favor of you, the former
spouse, if you provide for it in your QDRO. And the plan administrator can’t
be forced to pay the survivorship benefits to the current spouse when the
QDRO already requires that such payment be made to you, the former spouse.
If there’s more than one divorce, any subsequent QDRO can grant only what’s
left from any previous QDRO.
If you think this is confusing, you’re right. That’s why it’s tough for even
lawyers and judges to get the QDRO right — all the more reason to be sure
that your attorney has a command of these tricky issues. A good attorney can
advise you of these possibilities and help you get the results you want.
Check out Chapter 14 for more details on survivorship benefits.
227
Chapter 15: Dividing Your Pension between You and Your Ex

Being vigilant throughout 
the qualifying process
If the proposed QDRO doesn’t strictly follow the rules, the plan administrator
will reject the QDRO. You can skip all this uncertainty by asking the plan
administrator to approve the QDRO in advance. This is a common practice.
Even after a preapproved QDRO is signed by the court and sent to the plan,
your attorney must follow up to make sure that it wasn’t lost and that the
plan administrator is implementing the order. Vigilance is the word when
you’re dealing with pensions and, in particular, QDROs.
Also important to remember is that your ex’s plan must accept the QDRO as
qualified before you can receive a distribution from the pension fund, and
you can’t receive a distribution from the fund until your spouse retires or
becomes otherwise eligible to receive plan benefits. In other words, before
you get too excited, you must look to the plan procedures and information to
see what it says about the payout of benefits.

Chapter 16
Protecting Your Retirement Funds
from Creditors and Bankruptcy
In This Chapter
 Distinguishing your protections if you’re not in bankruptcy
 Understanding your protections if you’re in bankruptcy
 Taking action to protect all your retirement funds
I
t’s bad enough when your financial situation hits rock bottom and credi-
tors are knocking at your door. But when you add in the worry about
whether you’ll lose your retirement benefits as well as everything else you’ve
managed to save, the night sweats and anxiety attacks really come on strong.
But, thanks to provisions set forth in the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), your tax-qualified
pension plan receives extensive protection from creditors. And you can give
even more thanks to the bankruptcy law enacted in 2005, which broadened
bankruptcy protection for your retirement funds and individual retirement
accounts (IRAs).
In this chapter, we cover the protections that your retirement funds receive
and steer you toward more help in protecting your money from creditors.
Inside or Outside? Looking at 
Levels of Creditor Protection
You have different levels of creditor protection depending on whether you’ve
filed for bankruptcy. The terms outside of bankruptcy and inside of bankruptcy
are common and pretty simple:
 The term outside of bankruptcy means that the individual (in this case, the
plan participant) who’s in financial trouble isn’t under the jurisdiction of
the federal bankruptcy court because he or she hasn’t filed for bankruptcy.

Creditors, however, can still go after these folks. Luckily, though, the
provisions of ERISA and the IRC apply to and protect individuals outside
of bankruptcy, although the protections are a bit different.
 Inside of bankruptcy is the term used when an individual (now called the
debtor) has filed for bankruptcy; at this point, the debtor is within the
control of federal bankruptcy laws, and his or her assets are considered
part of his or her bankruptcy estate. (A bankruptcy estate is the property
that you own when you file for bankruptcy; pensions are included in a
bankruptcy estate.) The 2005 Bankruptcy Act protects the assets of indi-
viduals inside of bankruptcy.
The provisions of ERISA and the IRC don’t protect pension benefits that
have already been distributed; the provisions only keep your benefits from
being reduced by creditors before they’re distributed. After the benefits are
distributed from the plan, a creditor’s rights are enforceable against the plan
participant but not against the plan itself. In other words, the plan is still 
protected, but the benefits you’ve received are fair game for your creditors.
Same goes for the benefits that are distributed from an IRA (see Chapter 5);
they’re also fair game for creditors. However, as a result of the 2005 Bankruptcy
Act, eligible rollover distributions are protected from creditors of those folks
who are inside bankruptcy. But remember, these eligible rollover distribu-
tions may be protected for only 60 days after they’re distributed if they aren’t
rolled into an IRA or a qualified plan.
Finding Protection Outside 
of Bankruptcy
Your tax-qualified pensions and IRAs receive different types of protection
when you’re outside of bankruptcy; in general, qualified pensions receive 
federal protection, and state law may protect IRAs. The state law protection
varies from state to state. (See the State Laws Protecting IRAs chart we pro-
vide in Appendix B for some guidance.) We sift through the differences in the
following sections.
Tax-qualified pension plans
Both ERISA and the IRC require that tax-qualified pension plans (generally,
the ones we list in Chapter 3) contain provisions that prohibit the assignment
or alienation of plan benefits (these provisions are known as anti-alienation
clauses). In other words, your benefits under a tax-qualified plan have been
insulated from creditors’ claims; your creditors simply can’t take away your
pension to pay off your debts.
230
Part IV: Shielding Your Pension from Life’s Ups and Downs 

As we say throughout this book, most rules have exceptions, and this one’s
no different. The following are considered exceptions to the rule; in these cir-
cumstances, the assets in your tax-qualified plan may not be protected from
certain creditors:
 Federal criminal penalties and fines: Within the past few years, several
federal courts have held that the general anti-alienation rules of ERISA
and the IRC don’t protect retirement plan assets from fines or penalties
that are imposed when you commit a federal crime. For example, if you’re
convicted of a federal drug offense, it’s possible that your retirement
plan assets could be seized to pay criminal penalties.
 Federal tax levies and judgments: The Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
can go after your retirement plan assets to enforce judgments against
you for taxes and penalties.
 Fiduciary violations against the retirement plan: If you’re a plan fiduciary
and commit a crime against the plan (such as a theft of the assets of
the plan), your benefits under the same plan may be offset to repay the
plan for the crime you committed against it. (Chapter 10 has general
information about fiduciaries.)
 Qualified domestic relations orders (QDROs): Retirement plan assets
are marital assets that are subject to division in divorce, and they may
be ordered to be distributed for child support. (See Chapter 15 for more
information about QDROs.)
Not only is your tax-qualified plan protected from your own creditors, but it’s
also protected from your employer’s creditors. The rationale behind this rule
is that a qualified retirement plan is established for the exclusive benefit of
employees and their beneficiaries. Because your employer doesn’t have any
significant rights with respect to your assets, your employer’s creditors don’t
either.
Traditional and Roth IRAs
As we explain in the previous section, individuals who are outside of bank-
ruptcy can generally rely on federal law protections under ERISA and the IRC
to protect their retirement plan assets from the claims of creditors. No such
federal law protections apply for assets in IRAs, though. Instead, IRA owners
must look to state law to see if their IRA assets are protected from creditors.
Appendix B features a table that reviews the state laws for all 50 states and
that notes whether traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs are protected in each state.
In most cases, even when the state law protects IRAs from creditors, the IRA
assets are still subject to division in divorce, attachment for child support,
federal tax levies, and federal criminal penalties.
231
Chapter 16: Protecting Your Retirement Funds from Creditors and Bankruptcy

Simple IRAs and SEP Plans
SIMPLE IRAs and Simplified Employee Pension Plans (SEP Plans), which are
employer-sponsored, are treated differently from individually created and
funded traditional and Roth IRAs. ERISA defines a pension plan under its
jurisdiction as any “plan, fund or program that is established or maintained
by an employer that provides retirement income to employees.” Typically the
pensions that we cover in Chapter 3 qualify. But the courts and the Department
of Labor say that even though the contributions are immediately allocated
to the employee’s IRA, SEP and SIMPLE IRAs also are ERISA pension plans
because they’re arranged by the employer.
The fact that SEPs and SIMPLE IRAs are considered ERISA pension plans can
create serious problems for debtors outside of bankruptcy because ERISA and
the IRC provide no creditor protection for IRAs. So outside of bankruptcy, IRAs
are governed by state laws for creditor protection. However, state laws may
be preempted by ERISA with respect to SEPs and SIMPLE IRAs. This preemp-
tion can put SEPs and SIMPLE IRAs in the unusual position of having neither
federal nor state law protection from creditor claims outside of bankruptcy.
If you live in a state that protects traditional IRAs but not SEPs or SIMPLE
IRAs, you may want to roll over your funds from those plans to a traditional
(rollover) IRA, because the traditional IRA is likely to have a better chance of
being protected from the claims of creditors. Talk to the custodian of your
SEP or SIMPLE IRA about rolling over the assets to a traditional IRA.
Understanding Protection 
Inside of Bankruptcy
The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005
(also known as the 2005 Bankruptcy Act) made noteworthy changes in the
bankruptcy rules and added specific protections for both tax-qualified retire-
ment plans and IRAs in bankruptcy.
If you go into bankruptcy, the assets in the tax-qualified plans that we list in
Chapter 3, including Section 403(b) plans and Section 457 plans, are pro-
tected from creditor claims against your bankruptcy estate. In other words,
your creditors can’t touch those assets even though you own them. Assets in
SIMPLE IRAs and SEPs also are protected from your creditors in bankruptcy.
The rules are different for traditional and Roth IRAs; these plans are pro-
tected to $1 million. For example, if you have $500,000 in either a traditional
or Roth IRA, creditors definitely can’t touch your money. However, if you have
$1.2 million in a traditional or Roth IRA, creditors can take up to $200,000
(the difference over $1 million).
232
Part IV: Shielding Your Pension from Life’s Ups and Downs 

SEPs and SIMPLE IRAs are exempt without a dollar limitation. Rollovers into
IRAs from qualified plans, Section 403(b) plans, and Section 457 plans aren’t
subject to the $1 million exemption limitation either.
Here are a few other rules in the 2005 Bankruptcy Act:
 Pending retirement plan contributions (such as amounts withheld from
your wages) are excluded from your bankruptcy estate; they don’t count
as part of the property you own when you file for bankruptcy, so credi-
tors can’t touch them.
 Eligible rollover distributions retain their exempt status after they’re 
distributed from the plan. But such distributions may be protected for
only 60 days if they aren’t rolled over to another retirement plan or IRA.
So act fast when you make a rollover!
 Pension benefits that were awarded to a plan participant’s former
spouse through a QDRO — before the participant filed for bankruptcy —
are excluded from the participant’s bankruptcy estate. The benefits 
subject to the QDRO are treated as if they’re the benefits of the former
spouse rather than the plan participant. QDROs filed after you’re in
bankruptcy may be stayed pending the conclusion of your bankruptcy.
(See Chapter 15 for more details about QDROs.)
Planning for Protection from Creditors
It’s true: You can do things to protect your pension from creditors, but you
have to be proactive, and you need professional help to make sure you avail
yourself of all the protection options available. Depending on your particular
situation, you may need to meet with a pension attorney, a civil defense/trial
attorney, or a creditor protection/bankruptcy attorney. For example:
 If you currently have no creditor claims against you, you should meet
with a retirement plan attorney or someone at your employer’s human
resources department to ensure that your retirement benefits are in a
tax-qualified retirement plan that’s protected both inside and outside of
bankruptcy. Find out what creditor claims will be protected and when,
based on the type of plan you have. Even though your employer’s plan is
probably tax-qualified and protected from creditors, it doesn’t hurt to
ask. (Chapter 3 has the full scoop on tax-qualified plans.)
 If you’re in serious financial difficulty and can’t pay your creditors (who
you fear will sue you, but they haven’t yet), even though you aren’t in
bankruptcy, now’s the time that you should meet with an attorney who
specializes in creditor protection and bankruptcy matters. Try to pursue
all possible settlement options before filing for bankruptcy, because
bankruptcy will negatively impact your ability to obtain credit for many
years down the road.
233
Chapter 16: Protecting Your Retirement Funds from Creditors and Bankruptcy

 If you aren’t in bankruptcy but creditors have filed claims against you,
you need to hire an attorney immediately to defend you from such claims
or lawsuits. Failure to respond to the suit doesn’t mean that it will just
go away. In fact, if you don’t respond in a timely manner (generally
within a month or so after the suit is filed against you, unless you’ve
been given an extension of an additional month or so), your lack of
action may result in a judgment being taken against you. At that point,
you lose your ability to settle the claim at a lower amount, and liens may
be filed against you and your assets.
Whomever you meet with, discuss the issues regarding protection of your
retirement plan and IRA assets, and make sure the attorney is familiar with
the new rules.
To find bankruptcy, creditor rights, or pension attorneys who are practicing
in your area, contact your local bar association for referrals or check Web
sites such as www.martindale.com and www.findlaw.com. Check out
Chapter 19, where we discuss how to find a lawyer in more detail. You may
also want to consider debt counseling or consumer creditor counseling ser-
vices that can assist you in getting your financial situation under control.

I
n the pension world, there’s a tremendous gulf between the power and
knowledge of the plan and the power and knowledge of the average pen-
sioner. Consider the advantages of the company and the plan:
 The company employs pension actuaries who are familiar with the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA; see Chapter 2)
and who fully understand the implications of the present value calcula-
tions and the life expectancy tables (see Chapter 9 for more about these
items).
 The company hires attorneys who advise the company regarding new
legislation and how pending cases impact on the rules. These attorneys
also lobby on behalf of the company to have an impact on legislation
that’s pending before Congress. Even your own authors have won a case
in court only to find that special legislation in Washington, D.C., threat-
ened the verdict.
 The pension plan employs a full-time administrator and staff not only to
run the plan, but also to keep the plan out of trouble.
The most common perception, or perhaps misperception, is that you and 
the plan are on the same team. But to your pension plan, you’re just a debt,
not a lovable old-timer who’s faithfully served your company. The plan has
its team, and you have only, well, yourself. The plan’s experts have spent
their careers learning the intricacies of pensions while you’ve been doing

your job. They know the rules, and they also know that you probably don’t.
What you have here, then, is a David and Goliath situation. But as you know,
David won that battle. You can win the same way David did. You can’t expect
to memorize all the pension laws and review all the court decisions, but you
can be aware of the red-flag situations. And you can take action if you dis-
cover an error in your pension distribution. It’s all very doable, and by the
end of this chapter, you’ll have a bag of stones for your slingshot.
If you’re still working, you’re more vulnerable to upheavals in your pension
plan than if you’re already retired, so it’s extra important for working folks to
watch out for the potential problems that we outline in this chapter.
Checking Out Common Mistakes in
Calculating Pension Distributions
When their long-awaited retirement finally arrives, most pensioners want 
to take their money and move on. Few, if any, ever question whether their
pension distribution is correct. And maybe they should have. We say this
because the government estimates that up to 30 percent of all pension calcu-
lations are incorrect. Math mistakes can be made, or the plan may simply
record the wrong information, which results in your pension calculation
being incorrect. Systemic violations can also affect every person in the plan.
What we’re getting at is that you must be on high alert so that you aren’t
among the millions who retire with less money than they’re entitled to
receive. A good place to start is to identify some of the most common errors,
which we do in the following sections.
Careless recordkeeping mistakes
Pension plans commonly make a number of just plain careless or negligent
mistakes when calculating your benefits. These mistakes have two things in
common: They aren’t usually discovered, and they can cost you a lot of
money. The list of potential errors is as long as your imagination, but that list
certainly includes the following errors:
 Your wages aren’t properly reported or recorded.
 Your company doesn’t give you credit for all your years of service.
 You were on maternity leave sometime during your employment, and
service prior to your leave isn’t credited when you retire.
238
Part V: Taking Action When Bad Things Happen to Good Pensioners 

 Commissions, bonuses, or overtime aren’t credited, even though your
plan documents say that they should be.
 Your plan ignores new vesting requirements or increases in pension 
benefits.
 Credit for work in a prior company isn’t included.
 The plan staff or the computer program muffs up the math.
 Your birth date or Social Security number is incorrect.
 The assets in your plan are incorrectly valued or valued on the wrong
date (for example, you’re in a defined benefit plan and your benefits are
to commence on August 1, 2009, but the value of your benefits is calcu-
lated as of August 31, 2008).
 Your company merges or goes out of business, and no one is sure which
benefits you’re entitled to (Chapters 11 and 12 have information on what
happens to a pension during mergers, bankruptcies, and other difficult
circumstances).
 The company loses your records and is having trouble re-creating your
file.
Mistakes made by pensioners
Sure, you can get angry when your company makes mistakes, but remember
that you can make them as well. Here are some examples of mistakes you
may make one day:
 You may fail to update your human resources office about your divorce,
your new marriage, or a death in your family. For example, if you’re mar-
ried and your spouse is listed as your beneficiary, your spouse will be
your beneficiary until he or she is removed. If you divorce and fail to men-
tion this fact to your company, and if you fail to advise your company that
your ex is no longer your beneficiary, he or she will have a claim to your
money when you die. (See Chapters 14 and 15 for more information about
survivorship benefits and the effect of divorce on your pension.)
 You may discover an error in your personnel file but do nothing about it
and tell no one. If you notice, for example, that the wrong year is
recorded for your birth or that the year you started working is off by a
year or two (or ten!), your benefits will be directly affected. The mathe-
matical formulas used to calculate your benefits are based on, among
other things, your age and years of service (see Chapter 7 for details).
The longer you’ve worked, the higher your benefits, and likewise with
your age. So if you notice this error, don’t keep it a secret, or you’re
likely to be the one who’ll suffer.
239
Chapter 17: Looking Out for Potential Distribution Problems

If you discover a mistake in your personnel file, bring it to the attention of
someone in your human resources department or advise the plan administra-
tor. Ask him or her to fix it pronto; we suggest that you do this in writing,
keeping a paper trail just in case you need it down the road. This doesn’t
mean you can’t call first. Just remember to follow it up in writing to make
sure the correction is made.
When it comes to pension mistakes, silence isn’t golden. Instead, it’s the
squeaky wheel that gets the oil.
Major (and really expensive) mistakes
The mistakes that we discuss in this section are those big mistakes that affect
everyone in the plan. If and when these mistakes are uncovered, they can
cost the plan millions. Chances are that if the company miscalculated your
benefits based on one of the following errors, the mistake was made across
the board for other retirees as well. Multiply the mistake on your behalf by
the number of other retirees, and the number adds up quickly! Here’s a list of
the most common mistakes:
 The plan administrator uses an incorrect or illegal formula to calculate
everyone’s benefits (therefore paying everyone more or less than
they’re entitled to). But keep in mind that we seldom hear about errors
in which the plan pays more benefits than it should; the calculations
almost always seem to err on the side of the employer.
 Your plan reduces your benefits for service already performed. In other
words, your plan doesn’t provide you with benefits that you earned
prior to the plan being changed. Even though the plan is amended to no
longer offer a benefit it previously provided, after you’ve earned it, it’s
yours, and you’re entitled to receive it.
There’s a little something called the anti-cutback rule that says, in a nut-
shell, that it’s okay to take away benefits in the future, but benefits can’t
be reduced retroactively. Suppose that your plan offers a subsidy to
employees who take early retirement. Under the subsidy, if you retire
early, your plan pays you a lump sum amount totaling the amount you
would have been entitled to if you hadn’t taken early retirement. If the
company eliminates the subsidy after you’ve worked under this premise
for 20 years, it can’t touch the subsidy for the 20 years that you’ve
already worked. It can, however, amend the plan for the remaining years
that you work before retirement.

 Your traditional defined benefit plan converts to a cash balance plan
(which we cover in Chapter 3), and your account balance is now smaller
than it was before the conversion.
 Your pension isn’t paid within a reasonable amount of time after you file
your request for benefits. As a general rule, you should start receiving
your distribution within about 45 days after your application is made
(which is done after you retire).
 Cost-of-living increases aren’t properly credited.
 You take a lump sum rather than an annuity, and the plan uses an
inflated interest rate to calculate your lump sum (resulting in an amount
that’s lower than you’re entitled to).
 À la Enron, your company is overinvested in shaky company stock.
 The boss is illegally dipping into the fund.
 The company delays making payments into your 401(k), and you lose
some investment earnings.
 As a result of improper investments or your plan’s failure to follow your
investment instructions, your fund is short of money.
241
Chapter 17: Looking Out for Potential Distribution Problems
Making plans to have your money 
last as long as you do
Consider what co-author Bob Gary’s slightly
ancient but lovable brother Gene likes to say: “I
have all the money I will ever need to retire as
long as I die next month.” He has the right idea;
the goal of your pension is for your money to last
at least as long as you do. Interestingly, studies
show that women underestimate their life
expectancy, while men overestimate. On aver-
age, women live five years longer than men of
the same age. But you should also know that the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) life expectancy
tables (see Chapter 9 for more information) are
unisex tables that don’t differentiate between
men and women.
Your mantra must be to plan and save to meet
and even exceed a typical life expectancy, and
to pack that life with the activities of your
choice. Today’s 75 is yesterday’s 60. We expect
that many people out there intend to mount a
motorcycle rather than a rocking chair in their
retirement. The secret to life is to never stop
living it. (Gene would tell you that if you were to
ever bump into him in Las Vegas.) Only you can
choose to seize the moment. Climb Mount
Kilimanjaro, scuba-dive in the Great Barrier
Reef, or take your grandchildren fishing at a
nearby lake. While the spark of life runs on
human energy (which is free), the ticket to the
play requires money and income. Much in this
world requires planning and sacrifice, and your
secure retirement is no different. So you need
to ensure that you receive all you’re entitled to.

Recognizing Red Flags That 
Signal Trouble Ahead
Most prospective pensioners are sailing blissfully toward retirement with the
full expectation that if they do their jobs well and avoid being canned or get-
ting hit by a truck, they’ll make it to their retirement day and all will be fine.
And while that attitude may sound like a good one to have, you have to
remember that the unexpected can happen at any moment. Consider, for
example, the iceberg that sank the unsinkable Titanic; no one was aware of
that icy rock hidden under the surface. Similarly, where your pension is con-
cerned, it’s your job to be aware of the red flags that signal that an iceberg is
ahead. Sometimes your gut can tell you when something is awry, but being on
the lookout for problems is the best way to avoid them.
Warning signs in defined 
contribution plans
The following is a short list of warning signs indicating that your pension may
be in trouble and that you may not receive all the money that you’ve earned.
These red flags are most relevant to defined contribution plans (see Chapter 3
for more about this type of plan):
 Your pension plan is always switching managers and financial consultants.
 You find investments in your portfolio that you didn’t authorize.
 Your company doesn’t provide your individual benefit statement with
the regularity required under new pension rules, resulting in fines to the
company.
Starting in 2007, the plan is required to:
• Distribute quarterly benefit statements to participants who can
direct the investment of their benefits under the plan
• Distribute annual benefit statements if the trustees direct the
investments under the plan
 Your account balance appears to be wrong.
 You have a big, unexplained drop in your account balance.
 Your employer has financial problems.
 Former co-workers are having trouble collecting their benefits.
242
Part V: Taking Action When Bad Things Happen to Good Pensioners 

 Your account statement shows that contributions from your paycheck
are late in being made or aren’t being made at all to your 401(k). Your
elective deferrals are supposed to be contributed as soon as reasonably
feasible, which the Department of Labor (DOL) interprets as a week after
deferral from your salary. Chapter 4 has the basics about 401(k) plans.
If you notice these errors, you should first contact your plan administrator or
human resources department for an explanation. If you still believe that the
plan has serious problems, you can contact a DOL pension attorney. (We give
you contact information for the DOL later in this chapter.)
Underfunding in defined benefit plans
Under a traditional defined benefit plan, the level of benefits you receive at
retirement is fixed, but the employer’s contributions in any given year are not
fixed. The benefit you’re promised to receive at retirement is set forth in your
summary plan description (SPD) and calculated by actuaries based on factors
such as your age, salary, and years of service. (See Chapter 3 for the basics of
defined benefit plans.)
To better understand how the current underfunding crisis came about (which
estimates that American defined benefit plans face a debt of about $600 bil-
lion), a bit of explanation is in order. ERISA and the Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) established minimum funding rules to ensure that employers fund the
retirement benefits earned by their employees. Friendly accountants and 
actuaries cooperate with optimistic assumptions for what these plans will 
earn over time and crunch numbers to determine the cost of these benefits.
However, prior to the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA), employers weren’t
required to fund their defined benefit plans at 100 percent; in fact, it was suffi-
cient if your plan was only 90 percent funded. So, your company’s insatiable
desire for a happy balance sheet may have cost you your future pension. The
more a company assumed that its pension portfolio would earn, the less it con-
tributed to fund the plan. In 2000, for example, the stock market went down,
but the pension obligations to present and future retirees marched on.
In an effort to solve this underfunding problem, the PPA has made the funding
requirements much more rigid. Effective for plan years beginning after 2007,
single-employer defined benefit plans must make contributions to meet 100
percent of their funding obligations. Plans currently underfunded have been
given three years to meet this funding requirement and seven years to make up
all shortfalls — quite a heavy obligation for an underfunded plan. In order to
reduce their funding obligations under defined benefit plans, many employers
are freezing benefits under defined benefit plans and providing for future bene-
fits under 401(k) plans that are funded in part by you. The PPA also imposes
243
Chapter 17: Looking Out for Potential Distribution Problems

new requirements so that plan participants receive notice within 30 days after
their plan has become subject to a restriction based on its funding status. If
you receive such a notice, it’s a red flag that your plan is in trouble.
What about the plan you participate in? Is it underfunded? Here’s how to get
the information you need to find out:
1. Ask your human resources department or plan administrator for a
copy of your company’s Form 5500, which is a required DOL financial
report about your pension plan.
If this tactic doesn’t work, you can check online for the form. If you know
the name of your plan, you can go to www.freeerisa.com for a copy of
the Form 5500. (See Chapter 8 for more about this form.)
2. When you have the Form 5500, go to Schedule B and find and make
note of the Current Value of Assets and Accrued Liability lines.
These lines show you the value of the plan assets and what it owes.
3. Divide the current assets by the accrued liability.
The result is the percentage of your plan that’s actually funded. If your
plan is less than 100 percent funded, it has to increase funding to
comply with the new 100 percent funding rules. Most plans currently
aren’t more than 90 percent funded. If your plan’s funding level is less
then 80 percent, it’s considered endangered and at risk, while less than
65 percent funded is considered to be at critical status.
There’s a strong possibility that a seriously underfunded plan will freeze all
future benefits. This suspension of benefits may be the prelude to eliminating
your defined benefit plan.
Some troubled companies have their pension plans taken over by the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC). See Chapter 12 for more about
this organization and for full details about underfunding.
Reviewing Your Pension Distribution 
for Mistakes
It’s not rocket science to know that when you retire, another set of eyeballs
(besides the plan’s) needs to confirm that everything is hunky-dory — and
those eyeballs, my friend, would be yours. Unfortunately, this task fits into
the category of easier said than done. So, in the following sections, we give
you a few pointers on this all-important job.
244
Part V: Taking Action When Bad Things Happen to Good Pensioners 

Arming yourself with important 
information
In anticipation of a battle, any good general would make a list of the neces-
sary weaponry to carry that day. The same goes for looking over your pen-
sion information. You should, at a minimum, have familiarity with the
following as you double-check your distribution papers:
 The plan documents, particularly as they relate to vesting, accrual of
benefits, distribution, early retirement, and lump sum issues (see
Chapter 8 for more about plan documents)
 All plan amendments, particularly those amendments that have altered
the benefits package
 The tables and assumptions that were used to calculate your pension ben-
efits (check out Chapter 9 for more on these important calculation tools)
 Whether your plan is a defined benefit plan or a defined contribution
plan, know the difference and know all the types of plans that you’ve
participated in during your employment, including individual retirement
accounts (IRAs; Chapter 3 introduces you to the wide array of retirement
plans out there)
 Mergers, terminations, and bankruptcy — none of these should escape
your vigilance (as you find out in Chapters 11 and 12)
 All the critical information regarding your work history, including rates of
pay, breaks in service, survivorship information, and divorce history (and
make sure that the plan has this same information recorded correctly)
Confirming a few facts before you retire
We recommend that you determine, prior to retiring, that:
 Your plan distribution complies with ERISA and any other rules that 
may impact the size of your pension. See Chapter 9 for the full scoop 
on distributions.
 Your plan has all the necessary information, that it’s correct, and that
the proper tables were used and the math calculated correctly. The cal-
culations need to conform to the benefit formula stated in the plan, and
the factual information needs to be correct. In Chapter 8, we explain the
necessary information that your plan should have.
245
Chapter 17: Looking Out for Potential Distribution Problems

Moving forward when you think 
you’ve found an error
If you believe that there’s an error in any of the factual data in the calculation
of your pension benefit, bring it to the attention of your plan administrator or
your human resources department; it will usually be corrected. If you have
other concerns regarding the benefit calculations, or if the plan administrator
doesn’t properly address your concerns, review the procedures in your SPD
for appealing your benefit calculations. See Chapter 18 for more information
about the appeal process.
Getting Guidance from the Right Places
You probably don’t have the time, nor is it necessary, to become a pension
expert in order to receive what you’ve rightfully earned. Instead, like David
fighting off Goliath with his slingshot, you must know where to focus your
attention. And you have to know who to go to when you run into trouble that
you can’t handle alone. Described in the following sections are private and
public organizations, along with pension professionals, that can assist you in
resolving issues with your pension plan. You can even consult fellow pension-
ers for advice.
As the need for these resources becomes more apparent, the list of public
and private resources to aid pensioners is growing. But remember, the indis-
pensable component is you. You must be willing to stand up and ask ques-
tions to determine that you’re receiving the proper pension, and you must be
prepared to challenge your plan if it becomes necessary to do so. Some of the
organizations listed in the following sections may be able to assist you in
determining whether your pension is correct.
Private groups
The following organizations have experience in reviewing pension benefit
issues and providing recommendations for government agencies or profes-
sionals to contact to further review the issues or claims.
The Pension Rights Center

Government agencies
The following government agencies oversee and regulate pension plans and
assist plan participants. We provide additional contact information for gov-
ernment agencies in Chapter 2.
The Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Labor
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Department of Labor (DOL) have
developed a number of publications on various pension issues. The Securities
and Exchange Commission is also a valuable resource for saving and invest-
ments. Go to www.irs.gov to reach the IRS home page, and from there, click
on Retirement Plans Community. You also can go directly to www.irs.gov/
retirement/participant/index.html to find out more about almost any
pension topic and to view publications. You can visit the DOL at www.dol.gov.
The Employee Benefits Security Administration
The Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) oversees private 
pensions and is responsible for administering and enforcing ERISA’s provi-
sions. It has 15 regional and district offices to answer questions from retirees.
The regional offices often will help you get documents and will sometimes
offer other help as well. The EBSA is part of the DOL and has an Office of
Participant Assistance.
Go to askebsa.dol.gov to find out how to send your inquiry via e-mail. You
also can reach a benefit advisor via telephone at the Employee and Employer
Assistance Hotline at 866-444-EBSA (866-444-3272).
The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) provides benefits to
retirees if their pension plans fail. The PBGC also has a missing pensioner
program. Visit www.pbgc.gov, or go directly to the page earmarked for
workers and retirees at www.pbgc.gov/workers-retirees/index.html
to find out more about the services that the PBGC provides and the basic
benefits that it guarantees.
Pension professionals
If you run into problems regarding your pension, it often helps to get in touch
with a pension professional. These professionals, who have the necessary skills
to even the playing field between you and the company, include the following:
 Pension lawyers: As we like to think, in the pension world the right
lawyer is like the Colt pistol in the Old West — both are the great 
levelers. A good pension attorney can cause your employer to treat 
249
Chapter 17: Looking Out for Potential Distribution Problems

your pension claim more seriously. (Head to Chapter 19 for details on
finding a lawyer.)
 Pension actuaries: These professionals calculate retirement benefits
and can review your pension benefit to see if it’s calculated properly.
 Accountants: Sharp accountants can spot when a company has over-
stepped its bounds and trashed the rules.
Fellow pensioners
As a member of a pension plan, you aren’t alone; you can always look to your
fellow pensioners for help and advice. Chances are that one of them will have
come across a similar problem to yours at one point in their lives. So remem-
ber, take advantage of your fellow pensioners (and we mean that in a good
way). Here are a few suggestions:
 Form a retirees group, exchange e-mail and home addresses, and
encourage the discussion of pension issues.
 Set up a Web site where you and other pensioners can post questions
and receive answers from other retirees who have had similar problems.
 Make a point of sharing pension issues, and encourage your co-workers
to do the same.
 If you need to hire a professional (like those we list in the previous sec-
tion) to answer a question that affects the group, encourage the other
pensioners to split the expenses. You should also ask your fellow pen-
sioners whether they have experience with a professional who’s knowl-
edgeable regarding pension issues.
The bottom line is to talk to your co-workers about your pension. They can
learn from you, and you can learn from them. When it comes to a pension
question or concern, you’re never alone.

Chapter 18
Tackling Denied Claims
In This Chapter
 Understanding claims denied in full and in part
 Appealing a denial of your claim
E
very pension plan governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974 (ERISA; see Chapter 2) is required to set up and maintain a pro-
cedure that you follow to claim your pension, along with a procedure to appeal
the decision if your claim is denied. This chapter discusses the importance of
following the appeal procedure and what to expect along the way.
Oh, No! Discovering That Your Claim 
for Benefits Has Been Denied
All plans governed by ERISA have set procedures for filing claims for benefits,
and your plan must tell you what these procedures are. This information is
usually outlined in your summary plan description (SPD), which you should
review before you file your claim. A claim is considered filed when you meet
the plan’s requirements of a “reasonable claim-filing procedure.” In other
words, simply follow the plan’s directions; for instance, if the plan specifies
where to file your claim or with whom to file your claim, do just that. Keep 
a copy of what you file, and remember to mail it via certified mail, return
receipt requested, so you have proof. If you don’t know how or where to file
your claim, ask your plan administrator. (See Chapter 8 for a review of how to
request the SPD or any other documents that you need; Chapter 9 has details
on the general process of filing a claim.)
If your plan hasn’t set up a formal filing procedure, your claim is considered
filed when you make, or your representative (someone acting on your 
behalf with your consent) makes, an oral or written request for benefits. 
This request must be made to someone from the plan who has the proper
authority to receive claims for pension benefits, such as your plan administra-
tor or someone to whom he or she has delegated the authority to accept the

paperwork for the request. (Remember, even though ERISA requires plans to
set forth claims procedures, it doesn’t mean your plan has done so. That’s why
ERISA provides that your claim will be filed simply upon your request for bene-
fits.) So, after waiting eagerly to hear about your claim, you find out that you’ve
been denied. Two types of denials exist:
 Denial in full: In this case, your claim may be denied because you aren’t
eligible for benefits under the plan. For example, maybe you haven’t 
been a participant in the plan for enough years, or maybe you aren’t the
required age. (Chapter 7 has the scoop on ensuring that you’re eligible to
receive benefits from your plan.) Your claim may also be denied because
you haven’t provided sufficient information that the plan requested from
you to complete your claim. (This is an important reason you need to file
your claim according to your plan’s procedures!)
 Denial in part: If your claim is denied in part, this generally means 
that the plan calculated your benefits at a lower amount than you had
expected to receive based on your account statements or on the individ-
ual benefit statements you received in the past.
If your claim has been denied in full or in part, your plan administrator must
inform you of this denial through a written notice, in language that you can
understand. (As we discuss in Chapter 2, the plan administrator is the guy 
or gal who runs your pension plan, determines your eligibility to participate,
and decides whether to accept your claim for the distribution of your bene-
fits.) At a minimum, the written notice must outline the following:
 The specific reason or reasons for the denial
 Specific reference to plan provisions on which the denial is based
 A description of any additional material or information necessary for
you to correct your claim, and an explanation of why this material or
information is necessary
 Appropriate information as to the steps that you need to take if you or
your beneficiary want to submit the denied claim for review (see the fol-
lowing section for details)
If you don’t receive notice from your plan that your claim was denied or
accepted, don’t assume that no news is good news. In this case, if notice isn’t
given to you within 90 days of your filing, the claim is considered denied —
unless, of course, special circumstances exist that would justify extending
the time period to process your claim. The plan can get a 90-day extension,
but to do so, the plan must
 Notify you within the initial 90 days that more time is needed
 Tell you why more time is needed and the date that the plan expects to
make a decision
252
Part V: Taking Action When Bad Things Happen to Good Pensioners 

If 90 more days go by and you receive no answer, you can consider the claim
to have been denied.
Undergoing an Appeal after 
Your Claim Is Denied
If you feel that your claim for pension benefits was wrongly denied (denied in
full) or incorrectly calculated (denied in part), you have an important weapon
at your disposal: an appeal. In the following sections, we explain the appeal
process and help you decide whether pension litigation is in your future.
The appeal process can be tricky, so it’s important that you follow not only
your plan’s requirements to appeal the denial, but also the specific time peri-
ods set forth by your plan for doing so. Generally, you have 60 days to appeal
the denial of your claim, but if you need more time, the plan may extend this
time period. However, remember that if you file beyond the 60 days without
first requesting an extension, you may have waived your right to appeal. The
plan may provide the procedure for requesting an extension. However, you
should always put requests in writing, retain copies, and send your request
via certified mail, return receipt requested. It’s critical that you present your
claim properly and follow all the rules for appealing the decision exactly as
the plan requires. This is known as exhausting your administrative remedies. If
you fail to go through this process properly, a court may have reason enough
to dismiss any related lawsuit that you file down the road. The reason for this
possible unfortunate outcome is that courts require you to take advantage of
the plan’s appeal process before you file a lawsuit.
The appeal process is known as an administrative appeal because it’s part of
the company’s overall appeal process, as opposed to a formal court proce-
dure. Likewise, the term administrative remedies refers to the company’s
detailed rules that must be followed in order to have the decision changed
(and your claim remedied).
The proper presentation of your claim from the start not only affects your
appeal, but also may impact your chances for success in any later litigation
regarding your pension. Given all these factors, we strongly recommend 
that you hire an attorney to assist you in the administrative appeal process.
The right attorney can properly present the basis for appealing your claim,
protect your rights, and preserve the record in case of a lawsuit. And your
attorney may be able to find additional claims for benefits that you didn’t
even know existed. (We discuss the process for hiring the right attorney in
Chapter 19.)
253
Chapter 18: Tackling Denied Claims

Gathering and submitting 
critical information
First things first: Make sure that your denial letter complies with the require-
ments that we set forth earlier in this chapter. This way, you know what you’re
appealing and how to appeal it. If the denial letter doesn’t include everything it
should, contact the plan administrator (or whoever signed the denial letter)
and ask that the missing information be provided to you immediately.
Even though you may request the information missing from the denial letter
face to face or over the phone, confirm in writing all conversations you have
regarding the missing information (send all correspondence via certified mail,
and request a return receipt). Also make sure to keep a copy of all the letters
that you send and receive on this matter. Creating a paper trail is always a
good idea!
The denial letter from your plan should refer to the section of the plan on
which the denial is based. It’s important for you to have this information so
you understand why the plan denied your claim; without it, you have no way
of knowing what to submit to ask the plan to reconsider. If a copy of this par-
ticular section isn’t provided to you, you may be able to find it in the SPD; if
you can’t, ask the plan administrator for a copy of the section. And remember
that the denial of access to this information, in some cases, is enough for a
court to find that you were denied a full and fair review. (This is fancy lan-
guage for whether you got a fair shake during the appeal process.)
Got all the information you need from the denial letter? Good! Now you can
move forward based on that information. If your plan asks you to provide addi-
tional information for an appeal, you should by all means collect that informa-
tion and provide it. For example, your plan may request a certified copy of
your birth certificate because your age needs to be confirmed. If you think that
additional information or evidence will benefit your case, provide that also.
The plan may not consider the additional information you submit to be helpful,
but you can submit whatever you or your attorney think will help substantiate
your claim. The main point is this: Make sure that you do what’s asked and that
you provide the requested information or materials within the time limits set
forth in the denial letter or the SPD. And don’t miss any deadlines!
Checking out the basic review procedure
Your plan must put a procedure in place for you or your representative (such
as an attorney) to appeal your claim to a duly appointed fiduciary (we discuss
fiduciaries in detail in Chapter 10). So who’s the duly appointed fiduciary 
who will decide whether you eat steak or hot dogs in your retirement? The
plan’s procedure should set out who’s designated to fulfill this responsibility.
254
Part V: Taking Action When Bad Things Happen to Good Pensioners 

Generally, the plan administrator is responsible, but the plan can designate
another person to review and make decisions regarding claims for benefits and
claim denials. Check the SPD or the plan document (the unabridged document
that the SPD summarizes) to find out who will be reviewing your appeal. It
never hurts to know who’s going to rule on your claim. It could be an ally, a foe,
or someone who’s never heard of you.
The person or committee conducting the review looks at all the additional
information you’ve submitted, along with everything you provided when you
initially made your claim. The reviewer also looks at additional information
that he or she considers relevant, such as a plan amendment or part of your
work record. The reviewer considers all the facts, the language of the plan
and its amendments, and the law, and then makes a determination.
The decision given after the review is either an acceptance of your claim
(great!) or yet another denial (not so great). It must be issued in writing and be
in language that you can understand, and it needs to include specific reasons
for the decision. You’re required to receive a decision no later than 60 days
after your plan receives your request for a review. In some cases additional
time may be needed, such as if the plan determines that a hearing is necessary.
In no case, however, should the decision be issued later than 120 days after the
plan receives your request. If the plan extends its decision beyond the 60 days,
you’ll receive a written notice of the extension before the expiration of the 60
days. If you hear nothing for 120 days, you should follow up with your plan
administrator. If the plan administrator doesn’t take action on your appeal, you
can contact the Department of Labor (DOL) or a private pension attorney to
take further action. (Chapter 2 has contact information for the DOL.)
Hearings on your appeal are rarely requested by the plan administrator or fidu-
ciary, so if one is requested, we suggest that you consider hiring an attorney 
at this stage. Why? A hearing may signal that the plan is unsure of the correct
response to your appeal and is looking for more information or clarification of
some point. (You can find more on hiring the right attorney in Chapter 19.)
It’s a good idea to have an attorney help you at the plan-review stage, but
keep in mind that fees for this purpose may have to come from your pocket,
because courts generally won’t award fees for time or expenses incurred
before a lawsuit is filed.
Deciding whether to litigate 
if the appeal fails
If your plan reviews your appeal and decides to stand by its decision to 
deny your claim, you’re left with one option: Take the plan to court. As a 
plan participant or beneficiary, you have the right to bring a civil action in
255
Chapter 18: Tackling Denied Claims

court to enforce your rights. For many, though, going to court and suing 
their employer’s pension plan is an emotional and difficult decision. After 
many years of working for the benefit of your employer and trusting that your
employer is acting in your best interests, litigation against that employer’s pen-
sion plan presents a personal challenge. Take a personal inventory before you
move on to litigation by answering the following questions:
 Is the financial impact of the plan’s adverse decision significant to you?
In other words, will you receive just a few bucks less a month, or will
you receive half the amount you think you should?
 Do you have the temperament and patience to participate in litigation
that can go on for years?
 Can you separate your experiences over the span of your work life with
the company and then challenge that same company in court?
 Can you give your attorney control of your fate as it relates to your 
pension?
 Can you accept the fact that just because you’re right doesn’t always
mean you’ll win?
 Can you avoid getting too emotionally involved in your case? The fact 
is that it isn’t healthy when your case consumes and reduces your qual-
ity of life.
After you consider these questions, if you conclude that you want to litigate
rather than accept what you consider an unfair result, the next and perhaps
only step available is getting started with the litigation.
If the civil action to enforce your rights is brought under ERISA, the action
will be brought in federal district court. However, an action involving a claim
not governed by ERISA may be brought in a state court according to the
applicable state law. (For more about pension litigation, head to Chapter 20.)

e’ll say it up front: Many people are uncomfortable with lawyers, and
nobody ever wants to have to hire one. Assume that you’ve done
everything you can to avoid confrontation or even a lawsuit against your 
pension plan. However, if you feel you’ve reached the end of your rope and
believe you’re entitled to more benefits, you may have no other choice but 
to shop for a legal representative. In this chapter, we explain how to find and
choose the best attorney for your needs. Your attorney will serve as your
advocate — a defender of your rights and a champion for your cause — to
help you get the benefits you believe you deserve. (Head to Chapter 20 for
full details on preparing for pension litigation.)
Searching for the Best Attorney 
for Your Needs
All attorneys went to law school, but that’s where their similarities end. There’s
an attorney for just about any situation. So, to find the best attorney for your
situation, you have to know three things:
 The type of pension plan you have
 The kind of attorney you need and the experience of that attorney
 Where to look to find acceptable candidates

In the following sections, we explain what you should know about searching
for an attorney while keeping these three considerations in mind.
Identifying the type of attorney you need
Attorneys specialize in all sorts of fields, and it’s no different when it comes to
pension law. Some pension attorneys practice exclusively in federal court, and
some practice exclusively in state court. Many attorneys have experience in
both. The type of plan you have determines whether your case will be heard in
state or federal court. You want an attorney who’s familiar with the state or fed-
eral court procedure that applies to your plan. But no matter which court your
case is in, the most important skill for your attorney to have is experience liti-
gating pension cases.
In the United States, we have the federal court system, with one set of rules,
and the state court system, in which each state has its own set of rules.
Here’s a rundown on the two types of courts:
 Federal court: These courts have jurisdiction, or authority, over private,
tax-qualified pension plans that are covered by ERISA. (ERISA stands 
for Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974; see Chapter 2 for
more information.)
 State court: These courts have jurisdiction over public employee pen-
sion plans covering employees of state and local governments. State
pension plans are a creation of a particular state’s legislature. So, for
example, if you’re in the New York state teacher pension plan, New York
state courts will interpret and enforce the New York pension laws.
So, you need to know whether you have a private, tax-qualified plan or a plan
regulated by state law (a public employee plan) before you hire an attorney.
You ideally want to find an attorney who’s both familiar with your type of
pension plan and experienced in practicing in the court that has jurisdiction
over your plan. In the following sections, we help you figure out the kind of
plan you have and give you a few pointers on the type of attorney you need
based on your plan.
What kind of plan do you have?
You shouldn’t have too much trouble figuring out what type of plan you have.
Simply look at any plan documents that you’ve received about your pension
plan (we describe these documents in detail in Chapter 8), and then follow
these guidelines:
 If your employer is a private company, you most likely have a tax-quali-
fied private pension plan. To verify this fact, flip through the first few
pages of your plan documents, including the summary plan description
258
Part V: Taking Action When Bad Things Happen to Good Pensioners 

(SPD). Typically, the word ERISA will appear in the table of contents or
the overview section.
Knowing the name of your plan is helpful in determining whether it’s a
private plan. For example, if your plan name is The Sydney Michael
Designer Watch Company Profit-Sharing Plan, you can be sure that your
employer is a private company.
 If you’re a government or public school employee, chances are that your
plan is a public plan (governed by state law) or a federal plan (governed
by federal law), and neither type of plan is covered by ERISA. The biggest
clue is where you work. Just remember that ERISA was created to regu-
late the private sector’s pension plans — from your podiatrist’s plan to
IBM’s — not the plans for local firefighters or state troopers.
If you’re still unsure whether you’re in a private or public plan, just ask your
company’s human resources manager. We’re sure that he or she will be glad
to tell you. Also, go to www.freeerisa.com and type in your company name
to find out what plans it offers. Or do a Web search for your company and
add pension plan to the search criteria. Many companies have information
posted on their Web sites about their pension plans. This type of info, such
as whether your company is involved in any current litigation regarding its
pension plan, is useful for your initial meeting with your attorney. The claims
in other cases may be relevant to your claims, or they may affect them in
some way.
What skills should your attorney have, based on your plan?
Your attorney must know how to litigate a pension claim (present your claims
in a lawsuit filed in court). You wouldn’t go to a heart doctor for brain surgery.
This is no different. You need a pension litigator, not a personal-injury attorney,
even if the personal-injury attorney is the best of the best in his field.
Your attorney should have experience in litigating ERISA claims if you have a
private pension plan or state claims if you have a public pension plan. The
rules aren’t the same for each, so, preferably, your attorney should be skilled
in the type of plan you have.
Pension litigation is unique because the case often depends on a complicated
legal analysis, not on the facts. Typically, your entire case will be decided on
whether the specific language of your plan documents conforms to the law
governing your plan (either federal or state). Your attorney needs to be more
than a smooth talker; she must understand this complicated area of the law,
be able to clearly communicate and write complex ideas, and have litigation
experience.
For more details about the skills and experience a pension attorney needs,
see the later section “Asking the right questions during the interview.”

Chapter 19: Hiring and Working with an Attorney

Finding a few good candidates
In your search for a capable pension attorney, many resources are available
to guide you and assist you in the process. We suggest that you start with
attorneys who come personally recommended. After that, continue with the
other options in the following sections, doing your research online first, not
only because it’s quicker and easier, but also because it provides you with
the most options. If you don’t have access to the Internet, later we also pro-
vide phone numbers to assist you.
Federal pension law (ERISA) is the same in every state, so the right attorney
can be located anywhere. Don’t be discouraged if you can’t find an appropri-
ate attorney in your area; you can cross state lines in your search if you have
to. In this case, if necessary, the attorney can obtain permission from the
court to handle a case in a court that he isn’t admitted to practice in. If you’re
in a public pension and your claim involves state law, your attorney must be
licensed in that state. Otherwise he must get permission from the trial judge
to represent you for just the one case.
Do not — we repeat, do not — go to your local Yellow Pages in search of an
attorney. The cute, young attorney from the phone book who won Aunt
Minnie $500 when she slipped at the supermarket isn’t for you. You need an
attorney who has both barrels loaded with the right stuff. That means experi-
ence in pension litigation dealing with the type of pension plan you have and
the ability to communicate effectively. Because the Yellow Pages directory
merely lists names, addresses, and phone numbers, you have no way of find-
ing out anything more concrete about your choices. The phone book isn’t
bad for looking up phone numbers, but don’t expect it to provide more infor-
mation than that.
Personal recommendations
Personal recommendations from respected attorneys or accountants (or
even friends who may have had similar problems) are your first option. Ask
around — you may be surprised by the resources and recommendations that
the right questions to the right person will uncover. Because it’s probably
safe to assume that you’d trust the recommendations of these people, listen
to what they tell you about their own personal experience and whether
they’d hire a particular attorney again. Was the attorney responsive to their
needs, such as promptly returning phone calls? Was the attorney responsive
to their concerns (for example, fear of retaliation)? Does the attorney person-
ally spend time with clients, or was their contact usually with a paralegal,
secretary, or junior attorney? Finally, you should ask whether the attorney
was successful in the case.
260
Part V: Taking Action When Bad Things Happen to Good Pensioners 

If you’re lucky enough to receive recommendations of some attorneys in the
pension-rights field, you can check them out further on the Internet (as we
discuss in the later section “General online resources”) or in books and arti-
cles that can be found at your local library. Some books rate attorneys and
identify the type of practice they have. And your prospective attorney may
have published an article (or a book), which can give you even more back-
ground her. Ask the librarian for help with this. Your librarian may also be
able to help you find the Martindale-Hubble directory for your state.
Organizations that provide pension counseling services
These types of organizations usually network with pension attorneys who
provide advice, serve on advisory boards, and even offer free legal services
when requested by the organization. Because these organizations are actively
following the legal issues that affect seniors and retirees, they generally know
who’s knowledgeable in the field. Here are two of the most common organiza-
tions that provide pension counseling services:
 The Pension Rights Center: This organization protects and promotes
retirement security through its regional Pension Information and
Counseling Project. This project consists of six private, nonprofit pro-
grams, broken down geographically throughout the United States and
primarily funded by the U.S. Administration on Aging. To find out more,
go to www.pensionrights.org/help/counseling.
If you’d rather get in touch with the center through the mail or by phone,
here’s the contact info: Pension Rights Center, 1350 Connecticut Avenue,
NW, Suite 206, Washington, DC 20036-1739; phone 202-296-3776.
 Pension Action Center: Like many of these organizations, the Pension
Action Center provides no-cost referrals to attorneys or other profes-
sionals who can advise retirees and assist them with legal issues involv-
ing their pensions. To find out more about the Pension Action Center, go
to www.pensionaction.org/npln.htm.
To write or call this group, use this contact information: National
Pension Lawyers Network, Gerontology Institute, University of
Massachusetts, 1000 Morrissey Boulevard, Boston, MA 02125-3393;
phone: 617-287-7324.
Because these are grass-roots organizations, they may have only certain
hours that someone is answering phones, but the Web sites are helpful in
making contact as well.
Bar associations
Contrary to their name, bar associations don’t serve alcohol, but attorneys.
There are local and state bar associations as well as a national bar associa-
tion. Each level provides different services to the legal profession. The 
local bar association may provide a lawyer referral service and may process
261
Chapter 19: Hiring and Working with an Attorney

grievances against attorneys. The state bar may act as a liaison to the courts,
maintain publications on the law, and process grievances. The American Bar
Association (ABA), which is the national association, sets policy for attorneys
and publishes on topics of importance to attorneys.
If your local bar association maintains an attorney referral service, it will direct
you to an attorney in your area who’s in good standing with that state’s bar
association (usually this means that the attorneys haven’t been disbarred). It
can also specify attorneys who are experienced with pension issues. Local bar
associations have the best referral information because they’re local to your
community.
But the ABA (www.abanet.org) also maintains a registry of lawyers by field
of practice. At the home page, you can click on the Find Legal Help link, or
you can go directly to the ABA page for lawyer referrals (www.abanet.org/
legalservices/lris/directory). Both of these Web addresses display 
a map of the United States. When you click on the state in which you’re
employed and/or live, you’re taken to a Web page that lists your state’s bar
association’s office phone numbers. If any are available, the site also lists
hyperlinks to Web sites with further information. From there, you can look 
for an attorney who handles pension issues, employee benefits, or retirement
plans.
You can also contact the ABA at 321 N. Clark Street, Chicago, IL 60610; phone
312-988-5000.
We can’t assure you that all local bar association offices have Web sites, 
and we can’t assure you that all bar associations that do have Web sites 
are contained on the ABA’s link. In fact, while writing this chapter, we dis-
covered that our local bar association, which has quite a terrific Web site
(loraincountybar.org), isn’t listed on the ABA’s Lawyer Referral page. 
If your local bar association isn’t on the Web, you can always call your local
bar association and ask if it provides a legal referral service.
General online resources
The Internet can be quite helpful when you’re looking for an attorney or
when you want to check out a recommendation from a friend. Here are some
resources that we recommend:
 The Martindale-Hubble directory (which you should be able to find at
your local library) and its online service (www.martindale.com) are
often used by attorneys to find out about their opponents, but it’s also a
good resource for anyone who’s looking for an attorney. This directory
is excellent because it’s organized geographically and by type of prac-
tice. It also rates attorneys.
 Search engines, such as Google and Yahoo!, are great when you want to
search by keyword. For example, you might go to www.google.com
262
Part V: Taking Action When Bad Things Happen to Good Pensioners 

and search for pension law attorney. You can also search by typing in an
attorney’s name or law firm.
Remember that the more specific you are, the more you narrow the
search. If your search is turning up too many hits, narrow it by state and
city or even by adding the words defined benefit plan to the search.
 FindLaw (www.findlaw.com) is helpful when you want to find out more
about an attorney you’re thinking about hiring. At this Web site, you
simply type in the criteria you want to search for and then settle in to
review the results.
Using the Web to find anything is an art form, and the best way to master it is
to just give it a try.
Interviewing a Prospective Attorney
After you’ve identified a few pension attorneys who may be able to help you,
set up your first appointment with the one who comes most highly recom-
mended and who also appears in one of the other resources outlined in the
previous section. In the first meeting, you’ll get to know this person a little
and will get a sense of whether you can work with her. A smooth working
relationship is necessary because, after all, some of these cases go on for
years. The discussion of the circumstances of your case should also help you
assess how knowledgeable the attorney is about your problem. You have no
obligation to hire an attorney in the first meeting, so don’t feel pressured to
make a decision on the spot.
In the following sections, we walk you through the all-important interviewing
process. If the first interview is positive, you won’t need to proceed to your
second choice.
Calling to set up the interview
A phone call to set up an initial meeting with an attorney shouldn’t be diffi-
cult or time-consuming. Just follow these steps:
1. When you call, ask the secretary or receptionist if you can speak
directly with the attorney; this is an acceptable and expected request.
Be prepared to give the secretary, the attorney, or both a brief explana-
tion that includes your name, your employer’s name, the length of time
of your employment, your age, and whether you’ve already retired.
Gather all your pension and employment information before you place
the call in case the attorney asks what documents you have.
263
Chapter 19: Hiring and Working with an Attorney

2. When you’re actually speaking with the attorney, explain the nature
of your concerns about your pension and what you’ve already done to
address those concerns.
You want the prospective attorney to confirm that he handles issues
such as yours. Ask if the attorney maintains a Web site, and if so, ask for
the address. Checking the site can help you figure out the focus of the
attorney’s practice.
3. If it sounds like the attorney can handle your complaint, schedule 
an appointment to meet and ask specifically what you should bring
with you.
4. Ask whether you’ll be charged for this appointment.
Most good pension attorneys won’t charge a fee for this initial meeting
(often called an initial consultation), but if you’re advised that you’ll be
charged, find out what the charge is, and ask how long you can expect
your appointment to last.
You should expect to be scheduled within a week or two; if not, the attorney
may be too busy to work on your case (unless she’s out of town, and that, of
course, is an exception). Presuming that your appointment is scheduled in a
reasonable period of time, you need to get ready for the face-to-face meeting.
Preparing for the interview
Keep in mind that your first meeting with an attorney is an interview, so you
should act like an interviewer. After all, you are interviewing the attorney to
hire him. Take a list of questions with you (see the following section) so you
can find out what the attorney knows about pensions and whether he’s the
right choice for you.
Even if you want to hire the attorney, the attorney may decide that he doesn’t
want the case. It could be that the attorney isn’t familiar with the law or that
he feels that the two of you may not be a good team. Or the attorney may feel
that there’s a conflict of interest between you because of a prior case he has
handled.
Before you make the trip to the attorney’s office, you need to be familiar with
the questions on your list. You can group them by category or topic, or you
can put an asterisk by the questions you consider most important.
Don’t forget to take the documents that the attorney identified in your initial
call. At the very least, take the following items with you to this meeting:
264
Part V: Taking Action When Bad Things Happen to Good Pensioners 

 The SPD and any amendments made to it
 Your individual benefit statement and your payout schedules
 Any communication from the plan regarding the problem with your pen-
sion or the calculation of your benefits
If you have them or can easily get them, it’s also helpful to bring along the fol-
lowing items:
 Your pay stubs
 If applicable, your collective bargaining agreement
 The plan’s Form 5500, which provides a summary of the plan’s financial
information
 Your employee personnel manual
If in doubt about whether to bring a document to the meeting, just bring it.
It’s better to have it and not need it than to need it and not have it.
Asking the right questions 
during the interview
During the initial consultation, you find out about the attorney’s background,
skills, and qualifications, and whether the attorney has any conflicts of interest
in regard to your case. Equally important, you can use the interview to get a
better understanding of what you can expect from the litigation process.
The most important question you can ask during an interview is “What are
my chances of recovery?” In other words, does the attorney think you’ll win?
You don’t just want happy talk. You want an attorney who will tell you the
unvarnished truth, particularly if your case is a long shot. Although it’s most
likely too soon for the attorney to have an opinion about the odds of your
winning (after all, you do want her to do her homework and research the
facts and legal issues before jumping to conclusions), she may able to tell
you if there are elements to your claim that are flat-out losers. If the attorney
doesn’t think you’ll win, even after looking into your claims further, she may
take a pass on your case and refer you to someone else. Then you’ll have to
decide if the risk of going to court is worth it.
Potential conflicts of interest
At your interview, you want to make sure that your potential representative
doesn’t have a conflict of interest that may arise if he has previously repre-
sented your plan or a financial institution that invests money for your plan. In
265
Chapter 19: Hiring and Working with an Attorney

other words, you want an attorney who’s going to look out for your best inter-
ests, not the plan’s best interest. If he has been involved as an attorney with
any aspect of your pension plan, he should disqualify himself. If he doesn’t dis-
qualify himself, do it for him, and end the interview at this point.
The questions you can ask to determine whether your case could be a con-
flict of interest for the attorney are pretty straightforward:
 Have you ever acted as the attorney for my pension plan, my company,
or any of the big shots at my plan or company?
 Do you have a personal relationship or friendship with any of the key
people at the plan or company?
 Is there any reason you might have a conflict of interest if you took my
case?
Pension litigation experience
Because you need to find out about the prospective attorney’s experience in
the field of pension litigation, you can uncover this information by asking the
attorney for details about her background. Here are some examples of ques-
tions you can ask and why you would ask them:
 How many years have you been doing work in the area of pension
law? Obviously, someone who has been involved in pension work for
several years is a better choice than someone who tells you that you’re
going to be his first pension client. The more years of experience, the
better. We don’t suggest hiring an attorney with fewer than five years of
experience.
 What percentage of your practice is involved in pension litigation? You
don’t want someone to gain the bulk of her pension litigation experience
on your case. You ideally want someone who has active pension cases 
on her docket (a list of cases that an attorney is currently handling) and
who’s handled at least five pension cases in the past. The preferred attor-
ney is someone whose practice focuses mostly on pension issues.
If because of location your choices are somewhat limited, find an attor-
ney who has litigation experience with sophisticated issues. If she han-
dles important civil (not criminal) matters and has litigated at least
some pension cases with good results, this attorney may be okay. As 
we mention earlier, it is possible to go across state lines to recruit an
attorney, but do remember that it may be difficult to find a qualified
attorney who’s willing to travel to your location (unless, of course, your
case is of special interest to the attorney).
 Have you handled matters involving public pension plans and/or 
private plans governed by ERISA? As discussed earlier in the section
“Identifying the type of attorney you need,” you want someone who’s
266
Part V: Taking Action When Bad Things Happen to Good Pensioners 

familiar with the type of plan that you have. Make sure the attorney
understands your type of plan and can explain to you the significant
legal issues that are typical with it. If he can’t, it’s the blind leading the
blind. After all, you’re buying expert advice, not just a cheerleader.
 Do you have courtroom experience? You want an attorney who not
only is familiar with pension plan documents, but also has courtroom
experience litigating pension claims.
 What types of claims have you litigated? Find out the types of claims
your attorney is familiar with and how her experience relates to your
possible case. For example, if your claim involves the plan’s violation 
of ERISA, you need an attorney who can handle those specifics. On the
other hand, an attorney who brings cases concerning the types of
investments that plans make won’t necessarily be as familiar with 
claims that involve violations of ERISA.
You won’t know her claims credentials unless you ask. In other words,
don’t be afraid to flesh this out during the interview. Simply ask how her
experience litigating bad investment claims, for example, makes her
qualified to bring an ERISA violation claim. You might be surprised.
 Have you litigated claims on behalf of pensioners as well as employers?
If you find an attorney who has represented only employers in the past
(not employees), before hiring the attorney, be sure that he’s committed
to your claim. You should ideally hire someone who understands and is
sympathetic to employee issues and concerns. You want someone with a
track record demonstrating that he’s looking out for the little guy or gal.
There are plenty of qualified employer-side attorneys, and you might
find the right one for your claim, but generally, pension attorneys repre-
sent one side or the other.
 What has your success rate been? If the attorney has handled a number
of pension cases and never won, before you say “Thanks, but no
thanks,” find out why she has never won a case. And keep in mind that
just because an attorney has won ’em all doesn’t mean she’s the best
around — she may take only the easy ones. Consider asking the attorney
to tell you about the cases she’s won and lost; attorneys like to share
war stories, and you’ll get a sense of how easy or complicated her victo-
ries or defeats were.
 Have any of your cases produced published decisions? A published
decision comes about when a case has gone to trial, the court has ruled,
and the decision is important enough that the court decides it should be
published. More commonly, however, published decisions are appellate
decisions, meaning that a trial court’s decision has been appealed to a
higher court called the Court of Appeals. If any of the attorney’s cases
have been published, this confirms that he’s been involved in important
pension litigation.
267
Chapter 19: Hiring and Working with an Attorney

Don’t forget to show the attorney the documents that she requested in order
to review your case. If you don’t already have an extra copy of these items,
ask the attorney if she can make a copy of them so that you can keep the
originals. Sometimes the documents may be too lengthy to copy at that
moment, so if you can’t wait for them, ask if you can pick them up later or if
they can be returned to you by mail.
The working process
Make sure that you can work well with the attorney by asking the following
questions:
 What sort of communications can I expect from you? You want some-
one who, at a minimum, returns your phone calls. You also want some-
one who’s up front with how he expects to communicate with you. In
other words, will he send you monthly or bimonthly updates even if
nothing has happened in that interim?
It’s important to know what’s going on, as it’s going on, and you should
find an attorney who will keep you up-to-date. Sometimes that means
you won’t hear anything for a while, and sometimes that’s okay. The
important things are that your attorney communicates with you when
something happens and that he sends you copies of important corre-
spondence and pleadings (the documents that are filed with the court).
Litigation in general can take an extended period of time, and pension
litigation is no exception. No matter how long the case takes, you should
ask and expect your attorney’s assurance that you’ll be kept up-to-date
as things happen and that your phone calls will be returned within 24
hours.
 Can I expect that you’ll be handling my case yourself, or will another
attorney from your firm handle it instead? If your prospective attorney
is going to hand you off to another attorney, this may not necessarily be
a bad thing. If the other attorney is just as experienced as your first
choice, you’re okay, but you need to know. Sometimes the entire law firm
has similar experience, and you end up with an attorney who has more
time to work on your case, not less. So, if another attorney is going to be
involved, meet that attorney and ask her all the previous questions.
Miscellaneous info
You will, of course, have other questions about how long the case will take,
what’s expected of you as the client, and even the consequences of winning
or losing. The anatomy of a pension suit is discussed in Chapter 20, but here
are some of the questions that all clients should ask their attorneys:
 What is the estimated value of my claim? After your attorney has deter-
mined that you have a claim, a pension actuary usually calculates the
estimated value of your claim (see the later section “Crunching Your
268
Part V: Taking Action When Bad Things Happen to Good Pensioners 

Pension Plan Numbers after You Hire an Attorney”). But estimates can
change after your attorney has all the information. If your estimate
changes, be sure to ask your attorney why.
 How long will my case take? Your attorney can give you an estimate
based on experience, but much depends on unknowns, such as which
judge is assigned to your case and whether opposing counsel is coopera-
tive or fights every issue. From personal experience, we can say that pen-
sion cases go faster than most court cases, but that can still mean years.
 What will I be expected to do? For the most part, your attorney will
take care of the case, but you may be expected to appear in court for
pretrials or settlement conferences. You’ll usually be required to provide
written answers to questions posed by the other attorneys and to pro-
vide live testimony under oath to the opposing attorneys about the case.
This is called discovery. If the case actually goes to trial, you’ll have to
take the stand and testify. (See Chapter 20 for details about your partici-
pation in the discovery process and trial.)
Discussing payment options
As you consider hiring an attorney, you might be thinking, “Who’s going to
pay for all this fine talent? Everyone knows you can’t spend $10 to collect $7.”
Attorneys are paid two ways: by the hour and by contingency contract. The
client often has the option to choose the preferred method of payment. So,
specifically ask the attorney about his fees and then base your follow-up dis-
cussion on his answer and your preference.
The fees you pay no matter what
The litigation expenses and court costs are the same whether you hire an
attorney on an hourly basis or on a contingency basis. A litigation expense
isn’t the same as the attorney’s fee for time spent working on your case. You
need to know what’s included in litigation expenses, and make sure that the
contract you’re asked to sign (if you hire the attorney) spells this out. Some
of the larger expenses will be incurred for pension actuaries or other experts
as well as court reporters and deposition transcripts (see the later section
“Crunching Your Pension Plan Numbers after You Hire an Attorney” for more
about actuaries). You’ll be expected to pay these expenses.
Ask the attorney if she’ll pay these bills for you as they come in (referred to
as advancing the expenses) or whether you’ll be expected to pay them at that
time. Most attorneys will advance payment on the larger expenses, but do
find this out in advance. The contract usually indicates that the attorney is
reimbursed for the expenses she advances out of your portion of the recov-
ery. Some of the smaller expenses that you might be charged for include, for
example, photocopy charges, postage, and long-distance phone calls.
269
Chapter 19: Hiring and Working with an Attorney

As far as court costs are concerned, the first court cost you’ll incur, if your
case is filed, is the filing fee. This is a set rate, depending on the court you’re
filing in. And each time a motion or pleading is filed with the court, regardless
of who files it, charges are incurred. The court clerk keeps track of these
charges. If the case doesn’t settle and goes to trial, additional charges are
incurred. Presuming that you win the case or settle it in your favor, the other
side typically pays (or reimburses) the court costs.
The hourly rate attorney
If your attorney is going to charge you by the hour, find out:
 What items she charges for and what items she doesn’t. Will you be
charged for time spent on phone calls, even if you only talk briefly? What
if you run into your attorney at a restaurant or on the golf course and
ask a question? Will you receive a bill in the mail? You need to under-
stand what goes into the hourly rate.
 An estimate of the charges and what they’re based on. Although an
attorney may not be able to estimate specifically the amount of time he
will spend, the attorney should be able to give you a ballpark guess as 
to how much time he’ll spend on each stage of your case. You may want
your attorney to assure you that you won’t be charged an hourly rate
until it’s determined that in fact you have a case. Otherwise, you’ll want
an estimate as to how much money it will cost you to find out whether
you have a case. If it’s going to cost too much money (more than you
have or are willing to pay) to make that determination, it may not be
worth it. That’s a choice you have to make.
 How attorney time is billed (for example, by a tenth of an hour, a
sixth of an hour, and so on). If the attorney responds that you’ll be
charged, for example, by a sixth of an hour, that means that every time
the attorney works on your case, you’ll be charged a minimum of ten
minutes time (a sixth of an hour), regardless if two minutes, eight min-
utes, or ten minutes of time are spent. On the other hand, if you’ll be
charged by a tenth of an hour, that means you’ll be charged a minimum
of six minutes time (a tenth of an hour), regardless whether two minutes
or six minutes are spent. The result is obvious: You want someone who
bills in the smallest increments possible so you don’t pay for time that’s
not spent on your case.
 When you will be billed. Some attorneys send a monthly bill, and some
wait until the case is over. Find out when you can expect to lay out cash.
Your attorney may also want an up-front payment or retainer. A retainer
is typically a payment for the attorney to get started and shouldn’t be
payment for all work and expenses in advance.
270
Part V: Taking Action When Bad Things Happen to Good Pensioners 

As with just about everything in life, hiring an hourly-rate attorney has its
pros and cons:
 Pros: If your case is resolved quickly, you end up paying an hourly-rate
attorney a lot less money than the contingency attorney because the
earlier the case settles, the less attorney time you’re paying for.
 Cons: The meter is always running. You’ll feel constrained to check on
your case if you’re charged for your call to the attorney. Top attorneys
charge from $300 to over $500 per hour. At those prices, some attorneys
may worry that they’re spending too much time on your case, while
others may run up your bill just because they can. These concerns are
avoided with the contingency attorney.
It’s often expensive to hire an attorney on an hourly basis. If your claim isn’t a
sure thing, and if the attorney needs to do a lot of research to make the deter-
mination, you can spend a lot of money only to discover that you don’t have
a case.
The contingency attorney
The attorney who works on a contingency is a totally different animal from one
who works on an hourly rate. Attorneys usually love contingency contracts,
and generally clients do too. If an attorney offers to handle your case and pro-
poses taking a percentage of your recovery, this is known as a contingency fee
contract. Simply put, the attorney gets paid only if you win the case, which is
why clients prefer contingency contracts. Attorneys favor them because they
get a percentage of the recovery in the end. And the larger the recovery, the
more the attorney (and the client) receive. It’s a win-win situation for everyone.
Because attorneys don’t usually handle cases on a contingency basis if they
don’t think they’ll win, they can devote as much time as necessary to ensure
victory and not worry that their clients think they’re running up the tab.
The typical range for contingency contracts is 25 percent to 40 percent of the
recovery. That means the attorney’s fee will be that percentage of however
much money your case settles for or that you win in your lawsuit. But if there
isn’t a settlement, and you lose the case in court, you won’t owe attorney’s
fees, and the attorney doesn’t get paid for her time. So if the attorney takes
your case, obviously she thinks your case is a winner.
In a typical contingency case, there’s no charge for the attorney’s time, but
you’re still responsible for the expenses that will be deducted from your por-
tion of the recovery. Some states allow contingency attorneys to advance liti-
gation expenses and agree to waive their repayment at the end of the suit, or
even to assume the expenses of litigation. Ask the attorney whether that’s
permitted in your state and whether he’ll agree to waive the repayment of
these expenses in the event that you lose the case and have no means of
repaying them.
271
Chapter 19: Hiring and Working with an Attorney

In a contingency contract, your attorney risks not earning a fee; therefore, if
you do win, the fee will likely be higher than on an hourly basis.
Generally, an attorney agrees to a contingency contract if your potential for
recovery is high and/or if she can serve as counsel on behalf of many people
who have a claim similar to yours. This is known as a class action lawsuit. You
can read more about class actions in Chapter 20. If your case is a class action
and you’re the class representative, the fees are awarded by the court, and
the expenses wind up being apportioned among all the members of the class.
So if there are 1,000 class members, each one is responsible for a small part
of the total expenses.
If you and your attorney are in agreement that the fee will be paid on a contin-
gency, make sure you read the contingency contract closely and understand 
its provisions. Be sure you know who’s responsible for the expenses and how
they’re to be paid in the event of a win or a loss. Many contingency contracts
provide a sliding fee scale in which the contingency percentage increases if the
case goes to trial. In other words, the attorney receives a lower percentage for
a settlement and a higher percentage when the case proceeds to trial.
Whether you make a decision that day or not, ask to see the contract that
you’ll be asked to sign. If there’s something in the contract that you don’t like
or don’t want to agree to, don’t be afraid to ask if the attorney is willing to
negotiate the terms. This isn’t an unusual request.
Making your decision
After your first interview is completed, if you feel this attorney meets your
needs, you can select this person. If you have any hesitation, however, or
simply want to have two candidates to compare, return to your list of attor-
ney choices and repeat the interview process with choice number two from
your list.
Trust your instincts. If you’ve done your homework and your prospective
attorney seems to know his stuff, you’re comfortable with him, and your
instincts tell you he has your best interests at heart, you’ve probably made a
good choice. But if from the get-go, something about the attorney makes you
uncomfortable, trust yourself and move on to your second choice, because
once you’re in the midst of litigation it may be too late to switch.
If you’ve decided not to hire this attorney, don’t forget to let him know (and
thank him for his time, of course). But if you’ve made the decision that this is
the attorney you want to hire, keep reading to find out what happens next. If
you didn’t sign the attorney–client contract (also called a retainer agreement)
in your first meeting with the attorney, call and tell him that you want to
retain his services, and then schedule an appointment to get the ball rolling.
272
Part V: Taking Action When Bad Things Happen to Good Pensioners 

At that appointment, you’ll sign the retainer agreement, which officially
authorizes the attorney to proceed on your behalf. The agreement spells out
the fee and expense arrangement, as we discuss in the earlier sections. Even
though some contracts include an appeal, many won’t. If an appeal isn’t
included, this can be handled through a new contract if and when the need
arises. Finally, both you and your attorney should be clear as to what the
agreement requires of each of you.
Crunching Your Pension Plan Numbers
after You Hire an Attorney
After interviewing your potential attorney candidates and selecting one that
fits the bill, what’s the attorney going to do for you? First, she’ll collect the
pension plan documents that we hope you’ve retained over the years and
perhaps brought with you to the interview. These may include any or all of
the following (which are more fully explained in Chapter 8):
 Benefit election form
 Collective bargaining agreement (if you’re in a union)
 Individual benefit statement
 Summary annual report (SAR)
 Summary of material modifications (SMM) or a revised summary plan
description
 Summary plan description (SPD)
 The trust agreement
 The full plan document
 Written correspondence, such as the following:
• Letters from the plan advising of modifications to the plan
• Letters informing you that you won’t be receiving a benefit
• Notices regarding the plan’s funding status
• Copies of written inquiries that you made to the plan requesting
information or action regarding your pension
If you haven’t previously requested or received the preceding information or
haven’t kept these items, your attorney sends a letter to the plan administra-
tor (which every plan is required by law to designate) requesting whatever
documents are missing. The administrator has a limited period of time to pro-
vide certain requested information.
273
Chapter 19: Hiring and Working with an Attorney

Upon receipt of the necessary plan information, your attorney meticulously
reviews the plan documents and compares them with the SPD to determine
whether the language between the plan and the SPD is consistent. The attor-
ney also reviews your plan documents to determine whether they’re consis-
tent with the federal or state laws that govern your plan.
If your attorney concludes that the plan violated the law, he must then deter-
mine whether you have a lawsuit. Your attorney may need to send your 
information to an expert number cruncher (called an actuary) to determine
whether you’ve suffered a loss, and if so, how much you’ve been damaged.
A pension actuary has very specialized training to calculate the value of pen-
sion benefits. He examines your pension plan and benefits calculations (what
you’re receiving or what you expect to receive based on the formula in the
plan) and compares those benefits with what you should have received if the
law was properly followed or the numbers correctly crunched. Ultimately, the
pension actuary figures out whether you lost any money and the tentative
amount of damages you may have suffered. This helps determine the poten-
tial value of your case, which in turn helps your attorney determine whether
your case is worth bringing.
Based on what the attorney learns from the actuary, if the attorney deter-
mines that you indeed have a case, it’s time to move forward, either with an
individual claim or a class action suit. Chapter 20 has the full scoop.
Keeping an Eye on Your Relationship
with Your Attorney
It goes without saying that you attract more bees with honey. So if you treat
your attorney with TLC, your positive attorney–client relationship can take
you a long way. If your attorney doesn’t respond to your TLC, you can take
steps to put your working relationship back on track. But if that doesn’t work
and all else fails, you can always end things and hire another attorney.
Giving a little TLC
Treat your attorney with TLC: Trust, Look, and Concern. For instance:
 Trust the attorney’s advice. Let your attorney develop the legal argu-
ments and deal with the pension plans. Don’t send letters to the plan or
the judge, offering your two cents. Your attorney is your legal represen-
tative, and all communications are now her responsibility.
274
Part V: Taking Action When Bad Things Happen to Good Pensioners 

 Look at the work that your attorney produces for you. This includes
the complaint he drafts on your behalf that sets forth the basis of 
your claims and any motions, pleadings, or briefs that he files with the
court.
Reviewing his work gives you the opportunity to see that all the proper
facts and information have been set out correctly, and it also assures
you that your attorney is actually doing the work.
 Show concern on an ongoing basis about the outcome of your case.
This is part of the squeaky-wheel maxim. Good attorneys are busy; you
want an attorney to resist the temptations to put your case at the bottom
of the pile. Although your lawyer is likely busy, she’ll still expect you to
call in every few weeks to see what’s happening. After all, even though
your attorney may have many cases, she knows that this is your only
case and will therefore understand your concern.
Although it may be amusing to the public to compare attorneys to sharks, the
simple truth is that without your own personal shark, you can’t navigate the
waters of the legal system. You aren’t hiring a predator; you’re hiring a dedi-
cated advocate who’s familiar with the deep waters you now find yourself in.
He’ll navigate the shoals, protect your interests, and defend your rights. Your
attorney will commit his skill, time, and heart to righting your wrong. Most
often an attorney’s motivation is not just a fee, but also a passion for justice.
You’ll be amazed at how much your attorney will treasure a simple “thank
you” for a job well done.
Seeing signs that your 
big shot is a big flop
Your lawyer works for you — not the reverse. Repeat after me: “The attorney
works for me.” Although no attorney likes to admit that bad attorneys are out
there, it’s true. As in every profession, there are good eggs and bad eggs. The
trick is to identify a bad egg before it spoils your breakfast. Here are some
warning signs:
 Your phone calls aren’t being returned.
 When you do reach your attorney, you find out that it’s been many
months since anything has happened, and the only explanation offered
is “I’ve been busy.”
 Your case has been filed in court, and the attorney has been on the
losing end of most of the battles.
275
Chapter 19: Hiring and Working with an Attorney

276
Part V: Taking Action When Bad Things Happen to Good Pensioners 
Losing a motion (a request to the court to rule in your favor on a particular
matter) doesn’t necessarily mean that your attorney is a bad egg, but the
combination of not winning and poor communication indicates that some-
thing isn’t right.
If you reach the point that you’re concerned about your lawyer, whether it’s
early on or down the road, it’s best to address your concerns with her head
on. Do this before you make the difficult decision to replace your attorney in
the midst of litigation. She may be able to resolve your concerns and assure
you that your fears were misplaced. Or she may be willing and able to make
an adjustment to resolve the problem. On the other hand, after discussing
your concerns with your attorney, it may become obvious that it’s time for a
change.
If you terminate your attorney–client relationship after the litigation has
begun, you must be certain that you have a replacement. A lawsuit without
an attorney is like a ship without a rudder. All cases have to be filed within
certain periods of time. So if you fire your lawyer just before the time is about
to run out to file your case, you may not be able to find an attorney to pre-
pare a complaint and get your case filed in time.
Terminating the relationship
If you’re dissatisfied with your attorney’s services and haven’t received a sat-
isfactory response to your concerns, send the attorney a letter terminating
his services. Make sure you do the following:
 Include a brief summary of your case, including all outstanding matters
that you’re aware of. Request that the attorney advise your new counsel
of any important deadlines in your case.
 Ask for a bill for services (if you’re paying by the hour) and a list of all
expenses to date.
 Obtain a release of your obligations under the contract, and be certain
that once your relationship is terminated you don’t owe him anything
else. If the dismissed attorney claims he’s entitled to something in the
event that your next attorney wins your case, clarify in writing what he
claims he’s entitled to. Likewise, release your attorney of his obligations
under the contract so that you can hire another attorney.
 Ask the attorney to prepare your file so you can pick it up.
If your attorney acts unethically or unprofessionally, you can file a complaint
with the grievance committee of your local bar association.

Dissecting a 
Pension Lawsuit
In This Chapter
 Getting a grip on ERISA’s rules for pension lawsuits
 Tracking a typical pension lawsuit from start to finish
 Examining the process of payment
W
hen diplomacy has failed, and you’ve done everything to follow the
rules in order to receive your rightful pension (and whether you
haven’t seen a penny or have been collecting the wrong benefits for years),
your final recourse is a lawsuit. But believe us when we say that a lawsuit is
the legal equivalent of an armed conflict. It isn’t always pretty.
At this point, you’ve probably done the following to try and get what belongs
to you:
 You’ve filed your request for a pension distribution (see Chapters 9 and
17), but the plan said, “Sorry, Charlie.” It had a different idea about the
amount you should get.
 You’ve filed your administrative appeal (see Chapter 18), and to that the
plan said, “Hit the road, Jack.”
 You’ve decided that despite the plan’s refusal to see it your way, you’re
right, and the plan is wrong. So you followed the steps in Chapter 19 and
found a qualified pension attorney who’s chomping at the bit to cham-
pion your cause.
Now that you’re ready for a lawsuit, this chapter takes you on a tour of what
to expect.

Examining ERISA’s Rules 
for Pension Lawsuits
The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA; see Chapter 2)
governs the tax-qualified pension plans that we describe in Chapter 3, so it
only makes sense that it has a say in how lawsuits against those pension
plans are carried out. In the following sections, we explain what you can sue
for and what your employer can’t do to you if you choose to sue under
ERISA’s provisions.
What does ERISA allow you to sue for?
If you’re a participant or beneficiary of a tax-qualified pension plan that’s 
governed by ERISA, you can initiate a civil action in court to enforce certain
rights. In other words, you can sue in order to do the following:
 Recover benefits owed to you and enforce your rights under the plan
 Gain access to plan documents that you requested in writing and that
weren’t provided within 30 days (you can find a list of these documents
in Chapter 8)
 Clarify your right to benefits that you have yet to receive
 Obtain relief from a breach of fiduciary duty; if the plan’s fiduciaries are
squandering the money that should be used for your pension, you can
go to court to put a stop to it and recover lost funds (see Chapter 10 for
details about fiduciaries)
 Require the plan to give you a statement of your vested benefits after
leaving work (Chapter 7 has the scoop on vesting)
 Get an injunction to prevent or restrain the plan from violating its own
provisions or ERISA
 Get a review of an action by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
(PBGC) that has harmed you (see Chapter 12 for more about the PBGC)
 Get a review of a final action of the Department of Labor (DOL) in order
to either restrain the DOL or force it to take action according to ERISA
The Secretary of Labor has discretion to join in lawsuits filed in federal court
to enforce ERISA rights. In other words, if the government thinks that the
issues in your case are important enough or will have a wide-ranging impact,
it can choose to get involved in your lawsuit in order to have a say in the 
outcome.

Chapter 20: Dissecting a Pension Lawsuit
Legal wins by the little guys
You can find example after example of pension-
ers taking on their plans and recovering the dis-
tributions that they were entitled to receive.
They may have required more than a slingshot,
but here are a few examples of David, the pen-
sioner, bringing down Goliath:
 A class of pensioners brought a case
against a bank, claiming that the bank vio-
lated its fiduciary obligation to the plan. The
pensioners recovered $15.45 million.
 Pensioners initiated a case against 
an employer, claiming that their lump sum
payments violated the anti-cutback rule.
More than 5,000 pensioners recovered
$48.5 million.
 Pensioners filed a claim that their lump-sum
distributions, which were paid from a cash
balance plan, weren’t the same as if they
had elected an annuity. Several thousand
pensioners recovered $240 million.
 A class of pensioners filed suit against their
plan for miscalculation of benefits, and they
recovered $2.9 million.
 Former employees sued their employer
because the plan used the wrong interest
rate to calculate their lump sums. Twelve
thousand pensioners won and recovered
$51 million.
 Employees sued because their company
attempted to get out of its pension obligation
by laying off employees who were close to
retirement. The employees won, and 2,500
workers were awarded $415 million.
 Pensioners brought an action against direc-
tors of a bank because corporate insiders
sold stock to an employee stock ownership
plan at inflated prices. Five hundred
employees received $9.35 million.
 Participants in a pension plan sued 
their company for wasting plan assets and
improperly paying certain investment
expenses out of the plan. Hooray for 
the pensioners — 40,000 recovered 
$141.73 million.
 Pensioners sued their company and its
pension plan because they overestimated
Social Security benefits and violated cer-
tain provisions of ERISA. Yet again, the pen-
sioners were victorious, and 75,000 received
$80.9 million.
 Early retirees (represented by your authors
and their law firm) sued their cash balance
pension plan because the lump sum benefits
they received weren’t the actuarial equiva-
lent of the benefits they would have been
entitled to receive at age 65. Judgment in the
amount of more than $46 million (the amount
of the underpaid benefits plus prejudgment
interest) was upheld by a court of appeals on
behalf of more than 1,200 pensioners.
The point is this: A plan can find a host of oppor-
tunities and reasons to not pay the benefits that
it owes (and to which you’re entitled!). From the
previous examples, you can see that the rea-
sons and opportunities range from using the
wrong interest rate in the calculation of lump
sums to laying off employees to avoid paying
them their pension benefits.
And remember that when pensioners sue as a
class, collectively they have the muscle to bring
about significant victories. This list is far from
complete, so don’t be fooled into thinking that
because the plan and company are big and
powerful, they can’t be beat. In a lawsuit, one
side wins and one side loses; in pension litiga-
tion, however, the law and the facts win out. If
you’ve been wronged, don’t be afraid to fight for
what you’ve earned.

Should you worry about retaliation 
from your employer?
When contemplating whether you should sue your employer’s pension 
plan, you won’t be the first employee to be concerned about possible retalia-
tion. Luckily, you don’t have to be concerned, because according to ERISA,
your employer can’t take any of the following actions just because you or
your beneficiary are attempting to enforce your rights under your pension
plan:
 Terminate your employment
 Fine you
 Suspend you
 Expel you from the workplace
 Discipline you (for example, by writing you up as a bad employee or
docking your pay)
 Discriminate against you
Neither can your employer take any of the previously listed actions against
you for testifying or providing information in a proceeding related to ERISA.
In fact, the use of force or violence to restrain, coerce, or intimidate you is a
criminal offense and punishable by a fine of up to $10,000 and/or a year in
jail. If your employer steps over the line with force, you can turn him in to 
law enforcement, and if he fires you, you can sue him. As a practical matter,
your employer knows that you have rights and usually will leave you alone.
Before You Begin: Preparing 
to File a Complaint
Before you even file a complaint (which is the first document you file to start
your lawsuit), you and your attorney must put in some prep time. You need
to hand over a lot of important paperwork, and you and your attorney must
make an important decision: whether to file your complaint individually or 
on behalf of the many people in the same circumstance as you.
280
Part V: Taking Action When Bad Things Happen to Good Pensioners 

Sharing your documents 
with your attorney
Your attorney needs certain documents from you in order to get started on
your case. These documents include the following critical plan records that
we mention in Chapter 8:
 The summary plan description (SPD)
 The plan document (the unabridged pension plan document, including
all its provisions, that’s summarized by the SPD)
 All plan amendments (usually found in a revised SPD or a summary of
material modifications)
 Your individual benefit statement, along with any and all documents pre-
pared by the company to explain what you’ll receive when you retire
 Any legal documents that the plan asked you to sign, such as a release of
claim (also known as a waiver of your rights)
 Any correspondence between you and the plan
 All the records that were submitted in your administrative appeal
 All opinions from the plan regarding your administrative appeal
Before your attorney can determine whether you have a case, he or she must
review what the plan says you’re entitled to receive. The attorney will have to
assess whether you’re getting what you’ve been promised or whether the
plan’s method of calculating your benefits somehow violates ERISA. To reach
these conclusions, the previously listed important plan papers must be care-
fully reviewed by your attorney (and perhaps a pension actuary) for further
analysis. When it comes to pension litigation, it’s all about the documents.
Pension law is complex, but almost all the necessary information is available
before you start a lawsuit.
Deciding whether to file solo 
or as part of a class action
It’s likely that if you had problems receiving the proper payout from your
pension plan, a number of other people are in the same boat as you. Your
attorney can determine whether your claim is unique to you or is the type of
error that will impact other pensioners the same way it impacts you. In this
case, one of the issues that you have to consider is whether to file a lawsuit
281
Chapter 20: Dissecting a Pension Lawsuit

that pertains to just you or to participate in a lawsuit that you file on behalf
of all others who are similarly situated. This type of lawsuit is referred to as a
class action.
Essentially, with a class action, you’re asking the court to consider your case
to be filed on behalf of all plan participants who have suffered the same type
of loss as you have. Class actions are quite common in pension litigation
because the plan usually treats all pensioners the same, so a mistake made 
in the calculation of your benefits may very well apply to a number of other
people.
So how do you decide whether to file as an individual or participate in a class
action suit? The primary advantages to filing an action on your own behalf
include the following:
 The particular procedures that are part and parcel of class action litiga-
tion can be avoided, which may mean that your case will proceed more
quickly. (We cover these particular procedures later in this chapter.)
 If you file your case individually, you’ll be more in control of the out-
come. In other words, if you decide to settle, it’s your decision alone,
and that decision won’t affect hundreds or thousands of other people
and require court approval.
There are, however, powerful benefits to filing your pension case as a class
action. For example, consider these advantages:
 When you’re part of a large group of people, it’s less likely that your
company can wear you down or stonewall the litigation.
 Top attorneys who have the necessary skill and resources to litigate
against major corporations will be more willing to represent your claim
on a contingency basis when they can represent hundreds or thousands
of people at one time through one lawsuit. Even though the attorney
won’t receive compensation if you lose the case, that’s a gamble that he
or she is willing to take because if you win, the attorney may be awarded
a substantial fee by the court. When a case is filed individually, however,
the attorney usually asks to be paid on an hourly basis. (Chapter 19 has
more information on paying an attorney.)
 Ultimately, the costs of the case may be spread out among the entire
class rather than being paid by just one person.
 If your case can be brought as a class action, your attorney may request
additional compensation for you, as the class representative, to reflect
the extra work that you’ll have to do. However, it’s within the discretion
of the court whether to award you that additional compensation. We dis-
cuss the responsibilities of a class representative later in this chapter.

Part V: Taking Action When Bad Things Happen to Good Pensioners 

Exactly what will you be getting yourself into if you decide to file a class
action suit and become a class representative? You’ll be expected to respond
to inquiries (known as discovery) from the pension plan’s attorney. These
inquiries will help him or her determine whether your claim is the same as
the claims of the other plan participants you want to include in your case.
(We elaborate on discovery later in this chapter.) Suffice it to say that as a
class representative, it’s your responsibility to participate in this process, to
look out for the interests of the other class members, and to follow through
with the lawsuit until its conclusion.
Get Ready to Rumble: Filing a Complaint
Every case starts with the filing of a complaint by an attorney. The complaint
is the legal document that describes your claims and puts your pension plan
(also known as the defendant) on notice of the claims being asserted against
it. Whether you’re filing on your own behalf or as a class representative, every
complaint must include certain basic components, which we discuss in the
following sections.
The essential elements of any complaint
Along with the name of the plaintiff (that’s you) and the identity of the 
defendant (your pension plan), a complaint always has the following crucial
components:
 The nature of the claim. For example, if your plan used the wrong interest
rate to convert your annuity to a lump sum, the complaint needs to say so.
 An explanation noting that the complaint is being filed as a class
action suit. So, if your claim is being asserted on behalf of all other pen-
sioners in your plan with the same problem, the complaint must say so,
and the identities of the retirees who make up the class must be speci-
fied. (See the following section for more about class action complaints.)
 A list of the errors made by the plan, a calculation of these damages,
and what you hope to recover from the lawsuit. What we mean is that
you must make note of the compensation that you (and the group or
class that you hope to represent) are seeking for the shortfall in your
pension, including your claim for interest and attorney’s fees.
 The identity of the court in which your case is being filed. For exam-
ple, if ERISA regulates your pension plan, a federal statute is involved,
and your case will presumably be filed in a federal court, such as the
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. If your pension plan
is a creature of state law, such as a state teachers’ or police pension
fund, the complaint will be filed in state court.
283
Chapter 20: Dissecting a Pension Lawsuit

The particulars of filing a 
class action complaint
As you can imagine, filing a class action suit can be complicated and time-
consuming. And, of course, as with any legal process, you have plenty of
rules to follow. So, in the following sections, we go over the process of filing a
class action complaint: meeting some special requirements, requesting class
certification, and distributing a class notice if your request is granted.
Meeting the requirements of a class action complaint
To be valid, a class action complaint must meet the following requirements:
 A sufficient number of pensioners must have the same problem. For
example, class actions typically range in class size from 30 up to tens of
thousands.
If the wrongdoing that’s alleged in your complaint is continuing, at some
point during the lawsuit the court will require your attorney to establish
a cutoff date for determining the members of the class. Without such a
date, you would never be able to determine the class’s size or its dam-
ages and therefore would never be able to resolve the case.
 At some point in the lawsuit, the class members must be able to be iden-
tified. If the members can’t be identified, you can’t make a claim on their
behalf. Usually the attorney filing the lawsuit must determine all the
people who are part of the class. This determination is easily accom-
plished from the plan’s records because the plan keeps track of all its
participants. If the court rules that your case can go forward as a class
action, all members of the class must be notified in writing about the
case. (We discuss this notice later in the chapter.)
 All the pensioners must have the same legal problem. This concept is
called commonality. An example is “all pensioners who worked at the
company during a certain stated period of time, who took their pension
benefits in a lump-sum distribution as opposed to an annuity, with their
benefits having been calculated with the wrong interest rate.”
 The claims stated in the complaint on behalf of you, the class represen-
tative, must be the same as or typical of the claims of the other pension-
ers whom you assert are part of the class. To be the class
representative, you must have a claim that’s the same as everyone
else’s. This is called typicality.
 The court must be convinced that your interest in bringing the case is in
the best interests of the rest of the group and that you picked a lawyer
who not only knows what he or she is doing, but also has class action
experience.
284
Part V: Taking Action When Bad Things Happen to Good Pensioners 

 A class action must be the best way to handle these claims, and the
common issues must be more significant than any differences that exist.
In other words, there’s no better way for the pensioners to assert their
claims; for example, it may be cost prohibitive for them to file their own
individual cases.
If you meet the special requirements to bring a class action, you don’t need
permission from the individual class members to proceed on their behalf.
Seeking class certification
If your complaint states that you’re seeking class action status, one of the first
pleadings that your attorney will file is called a motion to certify the class (certi-
fication of the class is necessary for the case to proceed as a class action).
Attached to that motion will be a memorandum that demonstrates how your
case satisfies all the requirements in the previous section. The more informa-
tion and documentation that your attorney includes to prove fulfillment of the
requirements, the better your chances that the court will certify the class. The
SPD and the other plan documents you submitted to your attorney (we cover
this task earlier in this chapter) indicate whether your problem impacts an
entire group or is a mistake that applies only to you.
As part of the U.S. judicial system, the opposing party (in this case, the pen-
sion plan) has the opportunity to oppose the motion to certify, and most
times it will do so after taking your deposition and after conducting other dis-
covery to refute your class action allegations. (We dive into the details of dis-
covery later in this chapter.) The party opposing the motion to certify will file
a motion with the court arguing that you haven’t met the requirements for
your case to be considered a class action. This battle between the attorneys
and the court will decide which side wins.
After the motion to certify has been successfully filed, the court has the
option to hold a hearing for further argument on the issue of class certifica-
tion. After any hearings take place, the court will rule on the motion to certify
the class. Obviously, the earlier you know, the better, because then you have
an idea of how to proceed with your lawsuit:
 If the court determines that you haven’t met all the elements to support
class certification, your case will proceed on your individual behalf and
for your claims only.
 If the court decides that you’ve satisfied the requirements for a class
action and that you’re a satisfactory class representative, the judge will
certify the class, and your lawsuit will proceed as a class action.
 The court may find that the case can be a class action but that the
person bringing the case (that’s you) isn’t the right person to represent
the class because your particular claim is different, you have some
285
Chapter 20: Dissecting a Pension Lawsuit

agenda that makes your interest incompatible with the class’s interest,
or your attorney isn’t experienced enough to represent the class. In
many of these situations, the problem can be corrected by using, if avail-
able, a more suitable class representative or adding an experienced
class action attorney to the legal team.
Check with your lawyer to determine whether you can appeal the court’s
ruling on class certification. The answer may differ depending on whether
you’re in state court or federal court.
Sending out a notice
After the court certifies your case as a class action, it will send out a notice to
all the people who are part of your proposed class and who will be affected
by any decision made in the case. So, if 2,000 people are in the class, the
court will send out 2,000 notices telling every pensioner about the case and
giving them a chance to opt out of the case if they don’t want to be included.
The notice must
 Be sent by first-class mail to the last known address of each class
member
 Describe the nature of the claims and define the class generally (for
example, “All participants in the ABC Pension Plan who retired between
January 13, 2005, and March 17, 2007”)
 Provide specific procedures for opting out if anyone decides not to par-
ticipate in the litigation
 Explain that if the class member stays in the case, he or she will be
bound by the result
 Identify the attorney (or attorneys) for the class
 Provide a method or person to answer the class members’ questions;
the attorney’s name and telephone number are included in the notice so
that potential class members can contact him or her with any questions
 Be published in local newspapers in a shorter form to notify those
people who fail to receive the notice by mail
Understanding the Plan’s Response 
to the Complaint
Your pension plan usually has the following two choices when responding to
the complaint, whether it’s an individual case or a class action:
286
Part V: Taking Action When Bad Things Happen to Good Pensioners 

 Filing a motion to dismiss: By filing a motion to dismiss, the plan can ask
the court to toss out your case, alleging that the complaint doesn’t set
out a legitimate claim that entitles you to compensation. It’s unusual for
a court to grant this motion and dismiss a case on the initial filing by the
plan, but it does happen. If such a motion is filed, you have 20 days to
respond; your attorney will file a brief with the court setting out the
legal reasons why your case shouldn’t be dismissed.
 Filing an answer: If the pension plan doesn’t file a motion to dismiss, or
if the court denies the plan’s motion to dismiss, the plan must file an
answer to the complaint.
The purpose of an answer to a complaint is to allow a plan to admit or
deny the specific allegations that are set forth in your complaint and to
raise its defenses. The plan must assert certain defenses now, or it loses
its right to raise them later. Defenses include such things as filing the
case too late or having previously signed a release, forever waiving your
rights to a claim.
Whatever option the plan chooses, the response must be filed in federal
court within 20 days of receiving the summons and the complaint. In state
court, this period of time may be a bit longer. But everyone knows, either
from personal experience or from those experiences of friends or families,
that if these short time periods were actually adhered to, litigation wouldn’t
drone on for years. So don’t be surprised when the plan requests an exten-
sion of time to respond (and kindly remember that you may need additional
time to respond to a motion down the road as well).
Getting the Goods: The Discovery Process
After the pension plan files its answer to your complaint, the next stage of 
litigation is called discovery. Your participation in discovery will be an impor-
tant part of the case, either as an individual plaintiff or as a class representa-
tive. Each party (both you and the pension plan) has the right to conduct
discovery, and each party is governed by the same rules. The purpose of 
discovery is to find out what the other party knows about the claims and
defenses asserted, to get all the details that will make or break your case, to
nail down people’s testimonies, and to gather all the critical documents.
Discovery is conducted in two ways: in writing (with interrogatories and
requests for production of documents) and orally (with depositions). Both
methods are described in the following sections.
287
Chapter 20: Dissecting a Pension Lawsuit

Interrogatories and requests 
for production of documents
Two types of written discovery are at your disposal:
 Interrogatories: This type of discovery is in the form of written ques-
tions, which are submitted by the lawyers to the opposing parties. As
the plaintiff, you’re expected to answer the questions. Your lawyer then
reviews your answers for accuracy and responsiveness to the questions.
In addition, if any questions are considered inappropriate, your attorney
objects to them and states the basis of the objection (such as the ques-
tion is beyond the scope of what the plan is allowed to ask you). Your
answers are then submitted in a timely manner to the defendant pension
plan, usually within the 30-day time period allotted (unless an extension
of time is requested).
Each party may submit more than one set of questions during the course
of the litigation. For example, the plan’s attorney may ask you to specify
your financial loss and ask you why you claim the plan is responsible.
 Requests for production of documents: The purpose of a request for pro-
duction of documents is to find out what documents the other party has
to support their claims or defenses. As a plaintiff, you’ll most likely be
asked to produce all the documents that you initially provided to your
attorney, such as your benefit statement and SPD, even though the plan
already has copies of these documents. The attorney for the plan wants
to know what your lawyer relied on to file your complaint. (We describe
the documents that you must provide to your attorney earlier in this
chapter.) You’ll likely be asked to provide other records relating to your
claim as well. These records may include your birth certificate (to con-
firm your age) and employment records from another job (if you had a
break in service during your employment). Your attorney will guide you
in deciding which documents you need to produce in response to the
plan’s request.
Just because the attorneys submit interrogatories and requests for produc-
tion of documents doesn’t guarantee that either side will provide the sought-
after information. For instance, the attorneys may object to providing the
information if they determine that the request is too broad or burdensome or
that the information isn’t relevant to the lawsuit. In the case of pension litiga-
tion, keep in mind that it’s the plan that has most of the documents, so it’s
the plan’s attorney who will be doing most of the objecting. And remember
that as the plaintiff, all the documents that you have are frequently docu-
ments that the plan has as well, so you have nothing to hide.
288
Part V: Taking Action When Bad Things Happen to Good Pensioners 

If either party refuses to provide relevant documents after good-faith attempts
to get the party to do so, the other party has one weapon to possibly turn
things around: It can file a motion to compel with the court. The purpose of
this motion is to ask the judge to compel the refusing party to answer the
interrogatories or to produce the requested documents. As with other motions
that are filed with the court, the opposing party is provided a limited period
of time to respond to your motion (usually less than a month, depending on
whether you’re in federal court or state court). The court then issues its
order and either grants the motion and orders that the documents or infor-
mation be provided, or denies the motion and refuses to compel the other
party to produce anything.
The battles that take place between the attorneys will be handled by the
attorneys, so the best advice that we can give you is to let your attorney do
his or her job and not let yourself get aggravated.
Depositions
In addition to the requests for production of documents and the interrogato-
ries, the other type of discovery available to the parties is known as the depo-
sition. A deposition, which is the oral form of discovery, is when the opposing
attorney asks you questions, under oath, about the claims asserted in your
lawsuit. During the testimony, a court reporter records your answers on a
special machine that’s made just for this purpose (the reporter frequently
also records the testimony digitally via a computer). Your attorney is present
at the deposition to make sure the opposing attorney asks you only proper
questions. If the opposing attorney does ask any inappropriate questions,
your attorney will pipe up before you answer and object.
Attorneys take oral depositions because they can get longer answers and
explanations to their questions and attempt to trip up the deponent (the
person answering the questions). Because you’re answering on the spot, with
little time to prepare an answer, it enables the attorney to judge your credibil-
ity and see how believable a witness you’ll be in court. After the testimony is
completed and transcribed by the court reporter, the deponent gets the
opportunity to review, but not change, his or her testimony.
Being deposed is a bit daunting, especially if you haven’t ever been through a
deposition, but your attorney is there to help you. He or she will fully explain
the routine in advance, do a bit of role-playing to help you feel comfortable,
and remind you to carefully listen to the question that’s being asked before
you answer it. Your attorney will also stop the other attorney from bullying
or intimidating you. But by far the best advice that your attorney will give
you is to always tell the truth.
289
Chapter 20: Dissecting a Pension Lawsuit

In It to Win It: Stating 
Your Case to the Court
After the discovery phase is concluded, you’ve reached a critical junction in
your pension case. At this point, essentially all the facts are known (they’ve
been discovered), and either or both parties may be eager to file a motion for
summary judgment with the court, asking that judgment be rendered in their
favor, without a trial. This motion saves time and further expenses. But even
if your attorney opts to file this motion, you still may find yourself going to
trial and even having to appeal a decision against you. But of course, we hope
your lawsuit ends with an acceptable settlement in your favor. In the follow-
ing sections, we walk you through the process of going to court.
Moving for summary judgment
When a party files a motion for summary judgment, it must allege that based
on the law and the facts, it’s entitled to judgment at that point because:
 No material facts are in dispute.
 The law supports their position and not their opponent’s.
Pension cases are somewhat different from other lawsuits, because both par-
ties usually agree on the facts but disagree about whether the facts consti-
tute a violation of the law. So, many pension cases are decided based on a
legal interpretation of whether the plan or the conduct of the plan violated
ERISA or some other law. The other side is always given the opportunity to
respond to the motion, and because this motion can ultimately end the case,
the opposing party usually has no fewer than 30 days to respond (this time
period can vary depending on whether your case is in federal court or state
court). Additional time is frequently extended to the parties.
If the court grants summary judgment, the party that filed the motion wins
the case, and the other side may appeal the decision (we discuss appeals
later in this chapter). If the court doesn’t grant summary judgment, the case
proceeds to trial.
Going to trial and awaiting judgment
Anyone who has a TV has likely seen a jury trial. Most pension cases, how-
ever, are tried without a jury because ERISA doesn’t provide for a trial by
jury. At a pension trial, you and the pension plan present the witnesses and
290
Part V: Taking Action When Bad Things Happen to Good Pensioners 

evidence gathered during the discovery process (which we cover earlier in
this chapter) to the court. At the conclusion of the testimony, the judge ren-
ders a decision, and the following happens:
 If the decision is in favor of the defendant (the pension plan), you, the
plaintiff, lose, but you have the right to appeal.
 If the judgment is in favor of the plaintiff or the plaintiff class (that’s
you), you win. The pension plan can appeal the decision.
The losing party has a limited period of time — usually 30 days — to file an
appeal. We discuss appeals in more detail later in this chapter.
Accepting a settlement if you win
As a practical matter, if you win the lawsuit, don’t expect the pension plan to
pull out its checkbook and simply write a check for the amount that it owes.
This rarely occurs. If there’s a judgment rendered against a plan, the plan usu-
ally attempts to compromise and settle at a lower amount. The motivation for
you to consider a settlement is to avoid the risk of the judgment being over-
turned on appeal, which is always a very real risk. (See the following section
for more about appeals.) It’s the job of your attorney, not you, to negotiate any
settlement, and it’s the attorney’s obligation to keep you informed about the
progress of the negotiations. The trial court has no say as to whether you settle
or not.
If you choose, you (in an individually filed case) can order your attorney to
settle even if he or she thinks it’s a bad idea. However, what’s the point of
hiring a good attorney and then ignoring the attorney’s advice? We recom-
mend that you listen to your attorney for the best results.
If after much negotiation, you’re ready to accept a settlement in an amount
less than the judgment, you’re free to do so as long as you’re proceeding as
an individual plaintiff in your own individual case (rather than as a class rep-
resentative). In fact, you’re free to settle at any amount that you deem accept-
able and that the plan agrees to pay.
If your case was initially certified as a class action, however, settlements are a
different story. It’s not your decision as the class representative to accept a
settlement offer. Your attorney is certainly free to negotiate with the plan to
see what it’s willing to pay to resolve the claims, but you don’t have the right
to accept a settlement. This is because as a class representative, you have an
obligation to proceed in the best interests of the class. And even though you
may not like the offer extended, it’s possible that the court will determine the
offer to be in the best interest of the class.
291
Chapter 20: Dissecting a Pension Lawsuit

If your attorney believes that the plan’s offer may be in the class’s best inter-
est, it’s up to the court to make the ultimate determination, and it will do 
so through a Fairness Hearing. This hearing determines whether you, as the
class representative, and your attorney have protected the best interests of
the class. To assure fairness to everyone, a hearing is held so that class mem-
bers can learn the details, and if they don’t approve, they have a chance to be
heard. Here’s a bare-bones outline of the typical hearing process:
1. A notice of the proposed settlement is sent to all class members describ-
ing the terms of the settlement.
2. The members of the class are given the date of the Fairness Hearing, and
then they have the opportunity to object to the settlement.
3. Each member of the class is given a chance to review all the court filings
and find out how much he or she will receive.
4. The court takes testimony and evidence at the Fairness Hearing and
determines whether the settlement is fair. The court also awards the
attorney’s fees and expenses.
Appealing the decision if you lose
So you’ve lost your lawsuit and want to appeal the decision. First things first:
If your original case was in a U.S. District Court, according to ERISA, you
appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for that district. Likewise, state cases that
took place in state trial courts will be appealed to state appellate courts.
If you lose and your case is a class action, the whole class loses, too. To appeal
your loss, your attorney must file a notice of appeal (either on your behalf, if
your case was filed on an individual basis, or on behalf of you and the class, if it
was filed as a class action) and order that the record of the case be sent to the
appropriate appellate court. Then your attorney has to file a legal brief with 
the court of appeals that specifies why the lower court’s decision was wrong.
The plan files an opposing brief. No new evidence is offered, and the case is
decided on whatever evidence was in front of the trial court (which is why the
entire record is sent to the appeals court).
If the plan loses the lawsuit and chooses to appeal, it must post a bond to
ensure that the judgment can be paid if it loses the appeal. If the plan loses
the appeal, and it’s an ERISA case, the final recourse is an appeal to the U.S.
Supreme Court (which chooses to hear very few cases). State pension cases
(in other words, non-ERISA cases involving state funds, teacher unions, and
so on) can be appealed to their respective state Supreme Courts, and after 
a loss at that level, an appeal may be made to the U.S. Supreme Court. Your
292
Part V: Taking Action When Bad Things Happen to Good Pensioners 

attorney will keep you informed during the appellate process, but because all
the evidence has already been submitted to the trial court, there’s nothing
more for you to do but wait for the decision.
Take the Money and Run: Getting 
Paid after Winning Your Lawsuit
After winning your court case, it’s almost time to enjoy the fruits of your
labor. In the following section, we cover the basics of receiving your payment
from your pension plan.
Paying out the money in different 
types of lawsuits
As you find out in the following sections, the process of payouts differs in
individual and class action lawsuits.
Individual cases
If your case was filed on an individual basis and if you settle or win at trial or
on appeal, the defendant (the plan) writes a check. The money is usually sent
to your attorney, who disburses it to you after he or she deducts expenses
and legal fees according to your contract (see Chapter 19 for more about
attorney contracts).
Class action cases
Upon the successful conclusion of a pension class action suit, the amount 
of money awarded may be in the tens of millions of dollars. To dole out this
money correctly and efficiently to the class members, the court usually
appoints an administrator to oversee the distribution.
In a pension class action case, each participant usually receives a different
payout amount because each class member is impacted differently. However,
the calculations are made using the same factors that are used in pension cal-
culations. These factors include age at retirement, length of time at the job,
salary, and so on.
A pension plan payment is taxable, so approximately 20 percent of the pay-
ment will be withheld. If you have questions about the taxability of your 
payment, we strongly recommend that you consult your accountant or a tax
attorney.
293
Chapter 20: Dissecting a Pension Lawsuit

After the money has been disbursed to all the class members, a report is
made to the court accounting for the final distribution, which tends to be
lower than the actual award. Less money is usually distributed because it
isn’t unusual, given the age and mobility of the class members, that some
people entitled to funds can’t be located. Their money is held in a special
account while the attorneys try to locate those missing class members.
If the case was settled, provisions usually are made for redistributing any
unpaid monies when missing class members, after a thorough search, can’t
be located. These unpaid funds may
 Be paid out to the identified class members in proportion to their origi-
nal payment from the lawsuit. For example, if $1 million is undistributed
due to missing class members who, despite all efforts, can’t be found,
the million bucks can be paid out in a second distribution to those
who’ve already received payments.
There are a number of methods to calculate how much extra money
each class member should receive. One way is to pay each class member
the same percentage of the total award that he or she received in the
first distribution. In other words, if a member’s initial payment is 2 per-
cent of the total amount, he or she is paid 2 percent of the undistributed
million dollars in a second distribution.
 Escheat to the state, which means that the money goes back to the gov-
ernment because the proper recipient can’t be found
 Be returned to the pension plan
 Be held in an account for a set number of years until heirs can be
located
 Be paid to a charity by order of the court
Including prejudgment and 
postjudgment interest
The payment you receive from your victorious lawsuit usually consists of
your share of the judgment amount plus interest (in an amount determined
by the court) from the time that your first pension distribution was due until
the date the initial judgment was rendered in your favor. This interest is
called prejudgment interest, and it’s calculated into your judgment amount.
After all, the plan continued to earn interest on the money that it didn’t pay
out when it should have. So, you’re entitled to the interest that you would
have earned on it.
294
Part V: Taking Action When Bad Things Happen to Good Pensioners 

During the appeal process and until all appeals have been exhausted, a judg-
ment amount, inclusive of prejudgment interest, continues to earn interest,
known as postjudgment interest. So in addition to prejudgment interest, the
plan must pay postjudgment interest from the date that judgment was ren-
dered until the date that the money is finally paid.
Awarding attorney’s fees
If you hired your attorney on a contingency basis (see Chapter 19 for more
information about this setup), keep in mind that while your lawsuit ground
on for years, your attorney worked for free, perhaps passing on other cases
because he or she was too busy working on yours. After winning your case,
you can stop feeling sorry for your lawyer; ERISA allows an award of attor-
ney’s fees and costs for the prevailing party. The court has discretion to
award attorney’s fees in a couple of different ways:
 The common fund award is a percentage of the total recovery (usually
between 20 percent and 331⁄3 percent).
 The lodestar and multiplier is a method in which the attorney is paid his
or her hourly rate (the lodestar) times a multiplier (for example, two or
three times his or her hourly rate) that the court determines.
The court can also award money based on a blend of both of these methods.
295
Chapter 20: Dissecting a Pension Lawsuit
Paving the way for future pensioners
Most pension mistakes aren’t discovered, and
even if a lawsuit is filed, the plan can delay pay-
ment by fighting the lawsuit. In the meantime,
the plan has the use of your money for free.
Lucky plan; poor you.
For example: If a plan loses the lawsuit and is
ordered to pay interest at the statutory rate (the
interest that a defendant pays after losing a law-
suit is set by law so the court knows what inter-
est rate to apply), this amount is most likely to be
less than the plan has been earning on its invest-
ments. So the plan has little to lose and a lot to
gain by not paying the plaintiff right off the bat.
Your own authors were involved in a class
action case in which the pensioners challenged
the plan’s payment of interest at the statutory
rate, and the pensioners won. The decision from
this case can potentially benefit you if you
decide to sue your plan. The court in our case
ruled that the pension plan must pay the greater
of the statutory interest rate or the interest that
the plan actually earned on the money while it
was wrongfully withholding it. As a result, the
plan didn’t benefit from holding the money, and
it had to pay what it earned on that money,
which amounted to an extra $13 million!
The moral of the story? If you bring a lawsuit
against your plan, your legacy may be that
you’ve improved the lot for all pensioners, not
just yourself.

 Setting the financial stage for retirement
 Gathering the right information
O
ne of the biggest changes in your life comes about when you leave the
workforce and enter retirement. And there’s nothing like a little advance
preparation to make the transition go smoothly. The best time to get set for
this next stage of your life is while you’re still working. This chapter gives
some suggestions to get you ready for the big day when you say sayonara to
the daily grind.
Be Familiar with Special Requirements
for Participating in Your Plan
Your plan may require that you work 1,000 hours during a consecutive 
12-month period to be eligible for participation in your pension plan that
year. The plan may also tell you that you have to be employed on the last day
of the year or meet a certain sales figure to be eligible. Whatever the rules
are, you need to know them. Why? If there are years that you aren’t eligible
for participation, you have to know why so that you’re able to verify whether
your benefit package is correct when it comes time to receive your distribu-
tion. See Chapter 7 for full details on eligibility, accrual, and vesting.

Keep Your Pension Documents 
Safe and Accessible
If we were to say, “Go get your summary plan description,” and your response
was “Give me a few days to find it,” you need to read on. However, if you imme-
diately go get the key to your strongbox, you can skip this section. You’ve 
done your job!
Your pension documents serve as your contract with the plan regarding 
your pension. Keep these documents together in a safe place where you can
easily get to them. It doesn’t need to be a safety deposit box or even a lock
box; a desk drawer, file folder, or any special place in your home will do. 
Over the years there will be amendments to the plan, communications from
the plan, benefit statements, Form 5500s, and other documents yet to be 
created by the Washington bureaucracy. This is all important stuff. Keep
everything. There’s a good chance that you’ll need these documents down
the road. (Check out Chapter 8 for more about these documents.)
If you’ve lost or tossed some of these papers, request copies from your plan
administrator. Make this request in writing, and send it certified mail, return
receipt requested.
Fill Out Those Pesky Beneficiary
Designation Forms
If you get hit by a truck tomorrow, your pension beneficiaries will be con-
soled by their memory of you and, well, by the survivorship benefits that
they’ll get because of you. But wait — you never filled out the forms. Or just
as bad, your former wife is still listed as your beneficiary.
To prevent a similar scenario in which your only legacy is that you were for-
getful and scatterbrained, don’t procrastinate! Fill out the proper beneficiary
forms, and if your circumstances change, be sure to make the necessary
changes to the forms; your beneficiaries will love you for it. See Chapter 14
for more information.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Take Advantage of Any and All
Investment Advice Available to You
The recent trend appears to be that companies are switching from defined
benefit plans to self-directed 401(k) plans, and the big fear with that switch 
is that without expert advice, pensioners may make bad investment deci-
sions. But never fear — you aren’t alone. Your plan may have financial advi-
sors that you can consult prior to making any investment decisions. Take
advantage of that advice, but be sure to develop a relationship with an 
independent financial advisor whom you can consult to get a second 
opinion.
Long before retirement, you should begin meeting with financial advisors 
to find one you trust and who’s best suited to your financial needs. There’s
usually no charge for an initial meeting. In fact, the advisors will be more 
than happy to meet with you, and they’ll probably buy you lunch as well.
Also, your company’s retirees may have an organization that can provide 
you with the names of financial advisors and keep you posted on what’s
going on with your pension plan from the retiree’s point of view. Head to
Chapter 6 for more information about investments in pension plans.
If Your Plan Invests in Employer Stock,
Determine Whether You Can Diversify
Your pension plan may, for any number of reasons, be invested in your 
company’s own stock. But just because you work for the company doesn’t
mean that it’s necessarily a good investment. So, for many different reasons
(for example, the future of the company may not be bright, or you’ve just
realized that it isn’t a great idea to have all your eggs in one basket), you 
may want to diversify your pension portfolio in other stocks.
Prior to the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA), it was up to the company
whether you could diversify out of employer stock, except for Employee
Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) special rules (see Chapter 3 for more about
ESOPs). Now, post-PPA, you can diversify your investments without the com-
pany’s permission. The PPA provides that after three years of service, you
can diversify 100 percent out of company stock. This new choice is being
301
Chapter 21: Ten Key Pension Issues for People Still Working

phased in over three years. For company contributions in employer stock
after three years of service, the following rules apply during the phase-in
period:
 In 2007, you can diversify 1⁄3 of your investments out of company stock.
 In 2008, you can diversify 2⁄3 out of company stock.
 In 2009, you can diversify 100 percent out of company stock.
The bottom line is this: If you’re holding mucho company stock, you may
want to consider hedging your bet by diversifying out of it. A balanced port-
folio of high- and low-risk stocks and bonds becomes even more important as
you grow older. And this is why you should have a financial consultant you
trust to help you with these decisions.
Know Whether You Can Check Plan
Benefits or Change Investments Online
You’re living in the age of the Internet. In fact, you can do just about anything
online — find a date, shop for groceries, watch the news, pay bills, and the list
goes on and on. And it may just be that your plan has established a way for you
and other participants to monitor and check your plan benefits online.
This online access to your pension plan is a terrific advantage for you
because now the information is as close as your computer; you no longer
have to wait for communication from the plan. And there’s no need to worry
about having to access your account during the normal nine-to-five workday
(when you may be at work as well), because you can usually access your
account 24 hours a day and seven days a week. Your plan may have also
established a mechanism for you to change your investments online. If that’s
the case, take advantage of the technology. Ask your plan administrator if
these features are available.
Get the Help of a Financial Advisor
Find a trusted financial advisor right now. If you don’t have a good financial
advisor, investment mistakes can sweep your retirement down the drain. 
The trick is to find an advisor who’s more interested in you than in the fees
that you create. However, remember that these top-notch advisors are much
more difficult to find than the average money-hungry ones. So, when search-
ing for the right advisor, you have to ask lots of questions, and you have to
remain skeptical. Chapter 8 helps you find a financial advisor.
302
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Know How Much You’re Really Saving
for Retirement
Discuss with your financial advisor how much money you’ll need when you
retire. Whether you need $50,000 or $500,000, you simply need to make a plan
to set aside money. And when you’re making that plan, take into account the
number of years you have until retirement, your available savings, and the
realistic projections by your financial advisor as to what your money can
earn. Here are a couple of considerations to keep in mind (head to Chapter 8
for more about planning for retirement):
 Beware of taxes. When you look at your retirement account balance, 
it may look pretty healthy. But you have to remember that those are
pretax dollars that you’re counting. In other words, your final amount
may be significantly less, depending on the tax rate.
For instance, when you retire, the tax rate may be higher than it is now,
even though your personal tax rate may decline if your income is lower
after retirement. There’s not much you can do about taxes except pay
them and remember that you may need to leave a safety cushion to
account for changes by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
 Keep inflation in mind when you look into the future. If you have ten
years until retirement, an inflation rate of 3 percent can have a big
impact when spread over those ten years. So, when you talk to your
financial advisor, make sure that you take a look at some inflation-resis-
tant investments, such as equities. You may be too young to have all
your eggs in a fixed-income basket.
Remember, the earlier you start saving, the better because of the interest
buildup. So, start putting money aside for retirement today — unless, of
course, it’s after 6 p.m. In that case, start tomorrow.
Max Out Matching Contributions 
in Your 401(k)
If a genie offered you an extra dollar for every dollar you put in the bank,
we’re guessing that you would scrape together every dollar you could. Better
yet, if that same genie could make a special deal with Uncle Sam that every
dollar you and the genie socked away would grow tax-free, you would be, and
should be, ecstatic.
303
Chapter 21: Ten Key Pension Issues for People Still Working

Matching, tax-deferred genies don’t exist, but matching, tax-deferred 401(k)s
do. Don’t greet this news with a yawn or with excuses why you don’t have
money to set aside. This special tax treatment is a gift from Uncle Sam; take
advantage of it. You owe it to the sweet old person you’ll become someday to
take 100 percent advantage of matching contributions. Skip the steak dinner
and the trip to the Bahamas if that helps you take advantage of matching 
contributions.
Even without a match, your 401(k) is one of the best deals going. If you can,
contribute the maximum, which in 2007 is $15,500 (if you’re over 50 and your
employer allows catch-up contributions, the maximum goes up to $20,500).
Tightening the belt today can save you from a diet of cold beans in your
golden years.
Head to Chapter 4 for full details on 401(k)s.
Confirm That the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation Insures Your Plan
Defined benefit plans are insured by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
(PBGC) in case they experience financial problems and can’t pay your pension.
If this happens, the PBGC will pay you up to $49,500 a year starting at age 65, if
your plan terminates in 2007 (the limit may increase during subsequent years).
However, if your plan is financially shaky, the PBGC may want your company to
pay a risk premium in order to get insurance from the PBGC. So, check with
your plan administrator to confirm that your plan is in fact insured by the
PBGC. See Chapter 12 for the full scoop on the PBGC.
Church-sponsored defined benefit plans; federal, state, or local government
plans; and defined benefit plans offered by professional-service employers
(doctors and lawyers, for example) with fewer than 26 employees usually
aren’t insured by the PBGC.

People Getting Ready to Retire
In This Chapter
 Making sure that your employer is using the right information for your benefits
 Knowing the implications of the choices that you make regarding your retirement
You must consider several pension issues before you retire. An obvious
biggie is whether the amount that your employer says you’ll receive for
your retirement is the correct amount. If your plan has fancy bells and whis-
tles, such as subsidies for early retirements or lump sum payment options,
you need to know whether these options are in your best interest — and cer-
tain factors will play into this decision. For example, you may want to work
past retirement age or go back to work after you retire. This chapter has tips
on all these issues and more.
Make Sure the Facts on Which Your
Pension Is Based Are Correct
The natural reaction to this suggestion is usually “Nah, I don’t need to know
these facts. The pension plan office knows all that stuff.” But don’t be so sure
that your pension plan has it right; a mistake can cost you big money. Many
parts and pieces go into your pension calculation, and not surprisingly, your
plan has more than just you to worry about.
Even though calculating your pension distribution requires some work on
your plan’s part, you also have to make sure that you do your part. For exam-
ple, here are some questions you want to be sure to answer:
 If you were under different vesting tables for the time that you worked,
has your company applied the correct schedule to the correct time 
periods?

 Has your company credited you for time off for military service or for
maternity or paternity leave?
 Does the plan have your correct birth date, marital status, and total time
with the company?
 Did you tell the plan if you divorced or selected a different beneficiary?
 Does the plan have your correct salary for the entire time that you
worked with the company?
Make sure that your plan has everything right before you walk out the door.
You’ll save yourself a lot of aggravation. Chapter 8 has checklists of all the
information that you should verify with your pension plan before you retire.
Verify That the Plan Is Using the Proper
Formula to Calculate Your Benefits
To calculate your benefits, your pension plan takes all your information and
applies it to the plan formula. For your own protection, you need to know what
that formula is. Compare the provisions in the unabridged plan document with
those in the summary plan description (SPD) to confirm that they’re the same.
The next step is to verify that the company is applying the correct formula to
your pension benefits. It’s quite possible that your company, if big enough,
has more than one pension plan and more than one formula. If the wrong one
is used, you could end up receiving substantially less money than you should.
Or if the right formula is used but applied incorrectly, the same thing could
happen.
When in doubt, hire an attorney (see Chapter 19) or an actuary to verify that
your plan is using the right formula (and following the law regardless of the
formula).
Be Sure the Plan Had the Right 
to Reduce Your Benefits (If 
They’ve Been Reduced)
As the years roll on, plans inevitably make amendments to the pension bene-
fits it provides. Some of these changes result in your pension becoming less
valuable to you. But just because the plan decides to eliminate a subsidized
306
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

benefit or stick in some additional hurdles for you to jump before you get
your pension doesn’t mean that it’s permitted to do so. There’s a fundamen-
tal rule stating that the plan can’t take away what you’ve already earned.
To find out whether your plan is staying within the law, keep a copy of all
plan amendments, especially those that have in any way made your pension
less valuable to you. Then determine when that change took effect. If the
reduction of your benefits is retroactive and eats into benefits that you
earned for service or work already performed at the time of the change, your
plan may have violated the anti-cutback rule. This violation, which is more
common than you may realize, is a big deal and can cost you thousands of
dollars in lost benefits. Head to Chapter 7 for more about the anti-cutback
rule and Chapter 12 for more about legal and illegal plan amendments.
Select Your Own Investments If Your
Plan Gives You the Opportunity
As you approach retirement, you must be increasingly vigilant in order to prop-
erly position your investments to best serve your own needs. The older you
get, the more important your investment choices become. The right invest-
ment for a 25-year-old isn’t necessarily the right investment for a 55-year-old.
The older you are, the less risk you should be taking with your money.
If your plan allows you the opportunity to select your own investments and
you don’t make a selection, the plan will make the investment choice for you.
This is referred to as a default investment. Having someone else make the
decision for you isn’t ideal, because only you know which options best suit
your situation. If you don’t exercise your freedom to choose, you have no
voice. And believe us when we say that the insurance companies and invest-
ment firms want to get their hands on the probable billions of pension dollars
that are invested by default when pensioners don’t make their own choices. If
you wind up in a high-risk, high-fee fund run by Feesaplenty Insurance Co. by
default, you can blame only yourself.
With the advent of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA), your fiduciary
now is permitted to give financial advice directly to you as long as the fidu-
ciary doesn’t increase his or her compensation based on his or her invest-
ment recommendations (meaning that the fees must stay the same as a result
of the recommendations made). However, if the fiduciary wants to avoid the
level fee restriction, his or her advice must conform to a computer-designed
program.
See Chapter 6 for much more information about investments in pension plans.
307
Chapter 22: Ten Key Pension Issues for People Getting Ready to Retire

Know What Fees You’re Paying
As you approach retirement, your investments and retirement distributions
will replace your salary and become your primary sources of income. So, the
steady drip, drip, drip of fees will become even more important for you to
bring under control. Make sure that you uncover all the fees that you’re
paying to your advisors. Whether the fees are hidden or not, they’re there
(and you’re paying big bucks for them!). There’s no such thing as a free
lunch, and if you select an investment, someone is making money on it — 
and that someone probably won’t be you.
When your broker tells you about a great risk-free investment paying 61⁄2 per-
cent, you’d better think twice if the fees for that low-risk investment are 3 per-
cent. At these numbers, the investment has to earn 91⁄2 percent just to get your
promised 61⁄2 percent — which is highly unlikely. If you think your fees are too
high, tell your broker. Fees, like everything else in the world of money, can be
negotiated.
Under the PPA, your investment advisor is obligated to advise you of the
amounts and the sources of his or her fees. In recent years in the world of
investment advice, amounts and sources of fees have often been closely
guarded secrets (much too sensitive to be indiscriminately shared with those
who are paying them!). Luckily, however, the PPA requires increased disclo-
sure of both the sources and the amounts of the investment advisor’s fees.
The bottom line is this: It’s wrong for all fees not to be disclosed, and it’s your
right to insist that they are.
Choose Carefully between a 
Lump Sum and an Annuity
If you’re given the option to select the form of your pension distribution, you
may be wondering whether you should choose a lump sum or an annuity. 
The question is simple; the answer, however, is not. If you’re ill or expect to
have a short life expectancy, you’re probably better off taking your pension
benefits in a lump sum. If, on the other hand, you expect to live a long life,
chances are that taking your benefits in the form of an annuity will deliver a
bigger bang for your buck.
For example, $1,000 per month for life is worth a lot more if you live for 20
years rather than five. Your accountant can tell you how long you have to 
live to make the annuity worth more than the lump sum. This information is
308
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

worth knowing before you decide on the form of your pension distribution.
You also have to figure in survivorship benefits; if you and your spouse are
both healthy and have good genes, for instance, an annuity with a spousal
survivorship benefit may be better over the long haul.
The PPA, passed in August 2006, increases the interest rate used to calculate
the lump sum equivalent of an annuity. As interest rates go up, lump sums go
down. So, lump-sum distributions calculated after the PPA will be less than
lump sums calculated prior to the PPA. This change makes lump-sum distribu-
tions a less attractive alternative to annuities than they were prior to the PPA.
Additionally, the PPA has eliminated certain calculations (called whipsaw cal-
culations) that previously had to be performed before a participant received 
a lump-sum distribution from a cash balance plan. For distributions after
August 17, 2006, a cash balance plan is permitted to pay the individual’s
hypothetical account balance as a lump-sum distribution (see Chapter 3 for
more on cash balance plans and hypothetical account balances). If you
received a lump-sum distribution from a cash balance plan before August 17,
2006, however, there’s a good chance that it wasn’t calculated properly and
that you received less than you should have. Consult a pension attorney to
review the lump sum calculations for distributions from cash balance plans
prior to August 17, 2006.
Check out Chapter 9 for more about annuities and lump sums.
Take Advantage of Rollovers
One of the great benefits of having funds in a tax-qualified pension plan is that
in many situations, they may be rolled over into another tax-qualified plan or
an individual retirement account (IRA). What this means to you is that you can
continue to have your retirement funds grow in a tax-deferred account and not
pay taxes on the money until it’s distributed to you. However, remember that
this perk applies only to eligible rollover distributions made to you, of all (or
any portion) of your balance in a qualified pension plan. It doesn’t apply to dis-
tributions made in the form of annuity payments, minimum required distribu-
tions made at age 701⁄2, or hardship distributions.
Your plan administrator must tell you in writing that your upcoming lump-
sum distribution may be rolled over into another tax-qualified plan or into an
IRA. Your distribution must be either transferred directly to the IRA or other
tax-qualified plan or rolled over within 60 days after you receive it — or after
your surviving spouse or a former spouse, pursuant to a qualified domestic
relations order (QDRO), receives the distribution (see Chapter 15 for more 
on QDROs).
309
Chapter 22: Ten Key Pension Issues for People Getting Ready to Retire

It’s best to have the funds transferred directly to the IRA or tax-qualified 
plan. (This type of transfer is called a direct rollover.) Federal income tax is
withheld at a 20 percent rate on any eligible rollover distributions that aren’t
directly rolled over. So, this means that if the funds are distributed directly to
you (rather than directly rolled over), you’ll receive only 80 percent of your
benefits because 20 percent will be withheld for taxes.
Effective for distributions after December 31, 2006, beneficiaries other than 
a surviving spouse may roll over benefits into an IRA. However, such non-
spouse rollovers can be made only from plans that specifically permit such
rollovers.
We tell you a lot more about what rolls into what and when in Chapter 9.
Have a Plan for Drawing Down 
Your Lump Sum Payout
The purpose of your pension plan is to provide sufficient funds for the rest of
your life. Spending the money in your account in a defined contribution plan or
an IRA is referred to as drawing down. When drawing down your account, you
have to consider what withdrawal rate (the percentage of your total account
balance that will be distributed to you each year) will provide you with suffi-
cient living expenses without breaking the bank when you select a lump sum
payout. For example, if you have $400,000 in your plan, a withdrawal rate of 
3 percent will give you $12,000 per year. It doesn’t matter if your withdrawal
rate is a conservative 3 percent or a risky 6 percent; you still need a plan. 
The rate can be adjusted if you live a long life, or it can be based on portfolio
performance.
You may need expert financial advice to help you form a realistic picture of
what your investments can realistically earn over your life. If your invest-
ment portfolio is projected to earn 8 percent, you can take more out each
year than if it will only earn 4 percent. As a rule of thumb, many investment
advisors suggest that you withdraw 4 percent of your account each year if
your account is invested in a balance of stocks and fixed-income investments.
But play it safe, because your investment advisor’s opinion as to how much
you’ll earn over a period of years may not always be on the money.
310
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Look Before You Leap and 
Take Early Retirement
Some companies offer incentives to older workers to retire before they had
originally planned to. These incentives include subsidized early retirement
benefits, which give senior employees the same monthly benefit at age 60, for
example, that they would get at age 65.
If the company offers a lump sum form of payment option in addition to the
annuity, it’s possible that the lump sum will be based on the unsubsidized
early retirement benefit rather than on the subsidized early retirement bene-
fit. (See Chapter 9 for more about the differences between lump sum and
annuity payments.) In this case, the lump sum payment will be worth a lot
less than the subsidized annuity payments.
Before you take early retirement, make sure that the company has provided
you with plenty of information, in easy-to-understand language, about the rel-
ative benefits of the various early retirement and payout options. If the costs
and benefits of the options are unclear to you, have an attorney or accoun-
tant review them and explain what you’re getting yourself into. In the end, 
the money that you use to hire an attorney or an accountant will be money
well spent.
Find Out How Returning to Work after
Retirement Affects Your Pension
After three weeks of playing golf and watching television, many retirees get 
a bit bored and decide that working wasn’t so bad. If you feel this way and
want to return to your job (and the company in fact wants you back), you
need to find out whether the time you work after retirement increases your
pension. You also want to find out whether you can draw your pension if you
do return to work. These are questions for your company’s human resources
manager (or the pension plan administrator, if your company doesn’t have a
human resources department).
If you return to the workforce at a new company instead of your old one, ask
your new human resources manager (or plan administrator) whether going
back to work will have any positive or negative impact on your retirement
benefits.

Ten Key Pension Tips for 
Small Business Owners
In This Chapter
 Knowing how much you can afford to contribute to your employees’ retirements
 Attracting new employees and keeping good ones with your offer of retirement benefits
 Selecting your administrator and investments
A
re you a small business owner in search of a smart pension plan? Here’s
the key: To look out for your employees, you also need to look out for
yourself. This chapter is devoted to you, the small business owner, to help
you make retirement plan decisions that you can afford in order to attract
and keep the best employees.
Before you select the best pension plan for your small business, keep the fol-
lowing information in mind:
 Charts in Appendix B provide an overview of the variety of different
plans and dollar limits. These charts enable you to compare features.
 Professional fees vary, depending on the type of plan you select. At a
minimum, you’ll incur expenses for legal services (to set up a retirement
plan and submit the required documents to the Internal Revenue Service
for plan qualification), accounting services, and actuarial services (if
you implement a defined benefit plan).
 Before you settle on a retirement plan, be sure to consult an attorney, an
accountant, an actuary, and/or a financial advisor to help you pick the
plan that best meets your objectives and to guide you through the ropes
as you introduce the plan into your business.

Be Certain You Can Afford a Retirement
Plan for Yourself and Your Employees
As a small business owner you can contribute $4,000 to a traditional individ-
ual retirement account (IRA) in 2007 ($5,000 in 2008), and if you’re over the
age of 50, you can contribute an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution. If
you have a spouse, you also can contribute on his or her behalf. So poten-
tially, you can put somewhere between $8,000 and $10,000 into an IRA, tax-
free, in 2007. This is your starting point. If you can’t afford to put this much
away for yourself (and your spouse, if you have one), regardless of how desir-
able a retirement plan is for your employees, you won’t be able to fund it.
However, if you can contribute more than this amount and want to do so, you
have several plan options; keep reading.
Think about a SIMPLE IRA If You 
Have Fewer Than 100 Employees
If you have fewer than 100 employees who received at least $5,000 in com-
pensation in the preceding year and you don’t sponsor any other type of
qualified plan, you can set up a SIMPLE IRA. In this type of plan, your employ-
ees can defer up to $10,500 per year in addition to a catch-up contribution of
$2,500 if they’re over age 50 (these are the maximums for 2007; check out
www.irs.gov/retirement/article/0,,id=96461,00.html for future
rates). As the employer, you have a choice of two contribution formulas:
 You can match 100 percent of an employee’s contributions up to 3 per-
cent of his or her compensation.
 You can make a nonelective contribution of 2 percent of compensation
for each eligible employee.
The major advantage of SIMPLE IRAs for employers is that they usually have
lower annual administration costs than other types of qualified plans. The
plans are easy and inexpensive to set up and operate, and no discrimination
testing is required. You generally have no filing requirements, and the annual
reporting required for qualified plans (Form 5500 series) isn’t required for
SIMPLE IRAs. Usually, the financial institution or broker that holds the plan’s
SIMPLE IRAs handles most of the other paperwork.
If you can afford to put away $10,500 for yourself plus the $2,500 catch-up con-
tribution if you’re over age 50 (and the same amounts for your spouse, if you’re
married and your spouse is employed by your business), and if you can afford
314
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

to make contributions to your employees’ accounts, a SIMPLE IRA may be the
plan for you. You’re still providing your employees an option to save, and for
the vast majority of employees, $10,500 per year may be sufficient.
Head to Chapter 5 for details on SIMPLE IRAs.
Consider a 401(k) Plan to Attract 
and Retain Good Employees
Employees have come to expect their employers to, at a minimum, sponsor 
a 401(k) plan that allows them to make their own tax-free contributions. In
addition to providing your employees with this opportunity to save their 
own funds, you can consider offering to match your employees’ contribu-
tions (if you can afford it, of course). These matching contributions will serve
as incentives to retain current employees and to attract new ones. A 401(k) is
an option that you should consider if you can contribute more than $10,500
per year to a plan for yourself.
Under a 401(k), which is a type of defined contribution plan, you set up a
plan in which your employees may elect to defer a portion of their compensa-
tion to their 401(k) plan, tax-free. They can defer up to $15,500 per year (in
2007) plus $5,000 as a catch-up contribution if they’re over age 50. If an
employee earned less than $15,500, he or she is permitted to contribute up to
100 percent of his or her compensation.
When you establish a 401(k) plan, you have the option to decide whether
your company will contribute to your employees’ accounts. If your company
will contribute, you also choose how the contributions are made. For example:
 You can match your employees’ contributions at an amount that you
determine (so if they don’t contribute, you have nothing to match).
 You can contribute up to a certain percentage of their income (called a
nonelective contribution). This percentage must fall within the current
legal limits.
 You can put both of the previous options in place.
The limit in 2007 for total contributions to all defined contribution plans
offered by an employer is 100 percent of compensation up to $45,000 per year
(plus an additional $5,000 catch-up contribution if the employee is over 50).
Total contributions are those from both the employee and you, the employer.
Even if you set up a 401(k) plan, you can also set up other retirement plans,
such as the profit-sharing plan we discuss in the next section. Also, your busi-
ness can be any size and still be eligible to set up a 401(k).

Chapter 23: Ten Key Pension Tips for Small Business Owners

The major advantages for you (the employer) are the following:
 If cash flow is an issue, you have the flexibility to change the amount of
your nonelective deferrals each year as well as your match, because
your contributions are discretionary.
 If you offer either a match or a nonelective contribution to your employ-
ees, you’re a good guy, but if you offer to do both, you’re a really good guy.
This gesture goes a long way toward employee satisfaction and provides
major incentives to your employees to save for their own retirements.
Even though you have the discretion to change your contribution amount (or
to even decide not to contribute), professionally speaking, it isn’t a good idea
to do this to your employees. If you tell your employees at the beginning of
the year that you’ll match their deferrals up to a certain percentage, you
should follow through. In some cases, your decision to change your contribu-
tion may not be a violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974 (ERISA), but it may quite possibly be a breach of contract to renege
after your employees have relied on your word.
Check out Chapter 4 for full details about 401(k)s.
Add a Profit-Sharing Plan to
a 401(k) for Extra Benefits
Another defined contribution plan option is the profit-sharing plan, which is
the most flexible of all retirement plans. When you set up a profit-sharing
plan in addition to a 401(k), the combo will be an attractive benefit incentive
for your employees because it provides them with extra retirement savings
that are completely contributed by you. It’s a bonus for you as well, because:
 You aren’t obligated to make contributions to the plan.
 You can make a year-by-year determination whether you want to con-
tribute or not.
 If you decide to contribute, you can contribute any amount between 0
percent and 25 percent of your covered employees’ compensation.
 Your contribution amounts can vary year-to-year. If you do make contri-
butions, you must make them according to a set formula written into the
plan for determining how profit-sharing contributions will be made.
Keep in mind that the maximum amount for 2007 that can be contributed 
to each covered employee’s defined contribution plan (both employee and
employer contributions, and for all defined contribution plans that you 
316
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

establish) is the lesser of 100 percent of the covered employee’s compensa-
tion or $45,000 per year (plus a $5,000 catch-up for those folks over 50). So, if
you can contribute $45,000 for yourself (or $50,000 if you’re over 50) and
have the ability to do so for your employees, a profit-sharing plan, along with
a 401(k), is an option that you can look into.
Find out more about profit-sharing plans (and other defined contribution
plans) in Chapter 3.
Consider Defined Benefit Plans for 
More Sizeable Contributions
If you can afford to contribute more than $50,000 per year for yourself to a
retirement plan and can also afford to contribute that much to your employ-
ees’ plans, you may want to consider a defined benefit plan. With this type of
plan, the level of benefits is fixed, and the contributions are determined by an
actuary.
Defined benefit plans, by their very nature, are more complicated than
defined contribution plans. So, unless you want to contribute more than
$45,000 (or $50,000 if you’re over age 50), there’s no reason to take on the
additional administrative costs and expenses of setting up and running a
defined benefit plan.
Because defined benefit plans can provide greater benefits for you and your
employees than defined contribution plans in a shorter period of time
(because you’re contributing more), the advantage to you is that you can
deduct more than you can with other retirement plans (your actuary can pro-
vide you with your actual deduction limits). Also helpful is the fact that your
plan can provide different levels of benefits to different classes of employees.
Flip to Chapter 3 for general information about defined benefit plans.
Weigh the Pros and Cons of Fixed 
versus Flexible Contributions
As an employer, you may be in the type of business in which profits fluctuate
yearly, making it difficult or impossible during the down years to contribute
toward your employees’ retirements. If you find yourself in that situation,
317
Chapter 23: Ten Key Pension Tips for Small Business Owners

consider a retirement plan in which you have the ability to make flexible
(rather than fixed) contributions. What’s the difference? Consider the 
following:
 With flexible contributions, you can decide each year how much to con-
tribute to the retirement plans that you’ve chosen to set up. For exam-
ple, a profit-sharing plan is an example of a flexible contribution; you,
the employer, can decide to contribute somewhere between 0 percent
and 25 percent of your employees’ compensation.
 A fixed contribution, on the other hand, is a mandatory contribution 
that you must make each year. For instance, even if you have a bad 
year financially, you still have to contribute at year’s end to a defined
benefit plan.
Encourage Your Employees to Contribute
Generally speaking, all employees appreciate matching contributions. In fact,
your matching contributions actually encourage them to save even more for
their own retirement (otherwise, they may not even save a penny!).
But even if you can’t afford to provide matching contributions for your
employees, you should encourage your employees to contribute to a 401(k)
plan to save for their own retirement. Your employees who think on a more
long-term basis will appreciate the opportunity that you’re providing them to
save pretax dollars in a 401(k).
It also doesn’t hurt to remind your employees that they’ll pay no current
income taxes on the contributions they make to the plan and that their
accounts will continue to grow, tax-free, until the benefits are distributed to
them. If you’re providing your employees with the option to direct their own
plan investments, you may also explain that self-direction puts them directly
in control of their own futures and destinies.
Carefully Select a Third-Party
Administrator
In small companies, the plan administrator is usually the owner or an officer
of the company. Because ERISA requires that fiduciaries (such as the plan
administrator) administer and manage their plans prudently and in the inter-
est of the plan’s participants and beneficiaries, expertise in areas that are
318
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

outside the plan administrator’s professional knowledge are frequently
required. If you lack the expertise to manage and administer your retirement
plan, you must hire someone with the professional knowledge to carry out
this function, such as a certified public accountant (CPA) or a third-party
administrator (TPA). TPAs are typically firms that do nothing but administer
retirement plans (because they deal with nothing but retirement plans, they
know the ins and outs like no one else). A TPA performs the following tasks
as a part of administering a retirement plan:
 Determines the manner in which contributions will be allocated
 Prepares the necessary forms, such as the Form 5500s, the annual
returns, and the participant benefit statements (see Chapter 8 for more
about pension plan documents)
 Distributes and files the necessary forms and notices
The TPA you’re looking for is going to administer your plan in a proper and
professional manner at a reasonable price. Survey a number of potential
TPAs, asking for the same information and providing the same requirements,
so you can make a meaningful comparison and selection. It’s always helpful
to talk to other business owners who have retirement plans to see who they
use, and consider referrals from your attorney or CPA.
Examine All Investment Options
As far as investment options for your plan are concerned, you want to 
offer primarily mutual funds because they provide diversified investments.
(Diversified investments are great because you lessen the risk of a loss if any
one investment goes down in value.) If your plan is a defined contribution
plan that provides for participant direction of investments, your options will
likely be limited to a selection of mutual funds that offer different investment
characteristics.
When examining your investment options, look at the expense ratio of the
funds compared to the annual cost to operate the fund. Expense ratios are
usually expressed in terms of basis points; a basis point is 1/100 of 1 percent.
For example, if a fund has an expense ratio of 125 basis points, this means
that 1.25 percent of the assets goes to expenses each year. So if a mutual fund
has a gross investment return of 7 percent but an expense ratio of 1.25 per-
cent, the net investment return to your account will be 5.75 percent. Most
actively managed funds typically have expense ratios of between 50 to 125
basis points. Generally speaking, you don’t want the highest investment
return because it comes with the highest risk.
319
Chapter 23: Ten Key Pension Tips for Small Business Owners

As a small business owner, the type of plan you select is partly determined by
how much it’s going to cost. And how much it’s going to cost depends on the
investment fees and plan administration expenses that the service provider
charges. You need to ensure that informed cost–benefit decisions are being
made so that the plan and your employees aren’t paying for a service that
they don’t need or that’s not financially justified.
Check the various fees attached to different funds, and examine their perfor-
mance history. Check out sites such as www.morningstar.com to look at
the investment performance volatility and expense ratios of the various
funds. Go to www.dol.gov/ebsa/pdf/401kfefm.pdf to view a sample
401(k) Plan Fee Disclosure Form.
Avoid annuity contracts as often as possible (they have high fees attached).
Also generally try to avoid funds with front-end loads (investment fees that
you pay up front) and funds with surrender charges or back-end loads (fees
that you pay at the end).
Just as with the selection of TPAs (see the previous section), you want to
seek out referrals for investments advisors. Talk to your attorney, your
accountant, and other business owners whom you know and trust. They’re
usually the ones who can provide the best recommendations. See Chapter 6
for general information about investments.
Uncover Hidden Fees
Most employers find it necessary to hire an outside pension consultant who
usually recommends a money manager for your plan. You should carefully
choose this consultant by interviewing several choices and finding out about
their fees. Make sure that the fees are transparent and that there are no hidden
or undisclosed fees. Ask the consultant whether he or she has a relationship
with the recommended money manager and whether he or she receives any
payment from the money manager. This is the type of fee that’s frequently not
disclosed, and it can have a big impact over the life of a pension.
If the pension consultant doesn’t disclose such information, you need to
know whether there are recordkeeping or administrative fees that also aren’t
disclosed. Hidden fees can be very expensive. Protect your plan participants
by requiring full disclosure of all fees and transparency of all business rela-
tionships from your pension consultant.

Appendix A
Glossary
I
n this glossary are the major terms that you need to know for protecting
your pension. Even though the important words and phrases are defined
within the first chapter in which they appear, this glossary serves as a handy
reference in case you forget what a word means or what an acronym stands
for. These definitions are found on Web sites and in publications of the
Department of Labor (DOL), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), and within legal statutes and
regulations.
accrued benefit: The portion of an employee’s normal retirement benefit that
has been earned at any given point during his or her career.
alternate payee: A person other than a plan participant — such as a spouse,
former spouse, child, or other dependent of the participant — who’s identi-
fied in a domestic relations order as having the right to receive all or some of
a participant’s pension benefits.
annuity: A series of regular payments made to a retiree or beneficiary over a
period of years at evenly spaced intervals that usually continue for the life-
time of the recipient.
anti-cutback rule: A rule stating that once you’ve earned certain rights or
benefits, your plan can’t take them away from you retroactively. The plan
may change your rights going forward, however.
bankruptcy estate: The property you own when you file for bankruptcy.
beneficiary: Any person or entity designated to receive your plan benefits
when you die, such as a spouse, child, or significant other. In tax-qualified
retirement plans, your spouse is your beneficiary unless you and your
spouse agree to a different beneficiary.
beneficiary designation form: A form that you complete and return to your
employer to designate your beneficiary. If you don’t complete the form, the
plan kicks in and designates a beneficiary for you, usually your spouse. See
designated beneficiary.

blackout: The period of time when a fiduciary puts a hold on your ability to
make changes to your pension investments. A blackout can be caused when
there’s a change in the plan’s investment advisors, trustees, or recordkeepers
or when the plan undergoes a merger or acquisition. During this time period,
plan participants can’t access their accounts.
break in service: A time period in which you’re absent from work. For exam-
ple, working fewer than 501 hours in a consecutive 12-month period desig-
nated by the plan is considered a one-year break in service in most plans.
catch-up contribution: An additional contribution for plan participants who
are over age 50 (or who turn age 50 within the plan year) and who want to
put away more money before retirement. If your plan permits catch-up contri-
butions, you can increase your contributions over and above the regular
401(k), 403(b), or IRA contribution limits.
class action lawsuit: A lawsuit in which one pensioner (or a few pensioners)
files on behalf of all others who have suffered the same type of loss. Class
actions are common in pension litigation because the mistakes made in the
calculation of benefits usually apply to a number of pensioners.
cliff vesting: A type of vesting schedule in which an employee is considered
100 percent vested in the company’s contributions after a specific number 
of years but is 0 percent vested prior to reaching that specified number of
years.
collective bargaining agreement: A contract between an employer and its
union employees that governs the terms and conditions of employment for a
stated period of time.
cost-of-living adjustment: An adjustment to a retiree’s qualified retirement
plan that reflects cost-of-living increases. These adjustments typically result
in small, incremental increases in retirement benefits in order to keep bene-
fits in line with inflation.
deemed distribution: A distribution from your pension plan that’s treated as
if it’s a payment from your plan, thus creating a taxable event. For example, if
you take out a loan from your plan and don’t pay it back on time, the money
you received is considered a distribution from your pension and is subject to
taxation at the time you default on the loan.
default investment: An investment decision made by your plan (instead of by
you). When you don’t choose an investment option provided by your plan,
your plan will choose the investment for you.
324
Part VII: Appendixes 

defined benefit plan: A plan that guarantees a certain payout at retirement
according to a formula that takes into consideration the employee’s salary
and years of service in the plan. The plan defines (or calculates) the benefit
as an annuity at retirement age.
defined contribution plan: A plan that provides a payout at retirement that’s
dependent upon the amount of money contributed by the participant, the
employer, or both, to the participant’s individual account provided by the
plan. The final benefit depends on the performance of the investments. These
plans are also referred to as individual account plans.
denial in full: A denial of your claim for pension benefits because you aren’t
eligible for benefits. Your claim may be fully denied for a number of different
reasons, such as you haven’t been a participant in the plan for enough years,
you aren’t the required age to receive benefits, or you didn’t provide suffi-
cient information to the plan to calculate your benefits.
denial in part: A partial denial of your claim for pension benefits because the
plan didn’t approve of some part of your claim or incorrectly calculated your
benefits. A denial in part generally means that your benefits will be lower
than you had expected to receive based on individual benefit statements or
account statements you received in the past.
Department of Labor (DOL): The agency that’s responsible for administering
the provisions of Title I of ERISA, which regulates the administration of pen-
sion and employee benefit plans.
designated beneficiary: An individual or an entity designated as a benefi-
ciary under the plan, whether you designate the beneficiary or not. In the
event that you don’t designate a beneficiary, the terms of the plan designate a
beneficiary for you. See beneficiary.
discretionary contribution: A contribution to a retirement plan (such as a
profit-sharing plan) where the amount is determined each year by the
employer sponsoring the plan. See flexible contributions.
discrimination test: A test in the field of pension law that ensures that plans
don’t discriminate between highly compensated employees (HCEs) and
non–highly compensated employees (NHCEs).
disqualified person: Someone who, because of his or her relationship with a
plan, isn’t permitted to enter into certain transactions with the plan. This
person is also referred to as a party in interest and can include a plan fidu-
ciary, a plan sponsor, and plan service providers. See parties in interest.
325
Appendix A: Glossary

distress termination: A procedure that allows your employer to voluntarily ter-
minate a defined benefit pension plan that doesn’t have enough assets to pay
the promised benefits. After termination, the plan is taken over by the PBGC.
distribution: Any payout from a retirement plan.
early retirement benefit: The option to retire earlier than the normal retire-
ment age set forth in your plan.
early withdrawal: Any withdrawal that’s made prior to reaching age 591⁄2.
Early withdrawals may be subject not only to income taxes, but also to a 10
percent penalty imposed by the IRS unless they satisfy certain exceptions.
elective deferrals: The employee contributions that you make on a salary
reduction basis, pretax, to a defined contribution plan. The formula and limit
of the amount that you elect to defer are set forth in the plan documents and
usually expressed in the form of a percentage of income.
eligible rollover distribution: A distribution from a qualified retirement plan
that may be rolled over (transferred) to another qualified retirement plan or
an IRA.
eligibility: The green light to participate in your employer’s pension plan. If
you’re eligible to participate, that means you’ve met the plan’s requirements,
such as age and years of service.
Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA): A division of the DOL
that’s responsible for enforcing the rules governing the conduct of plan man-
agers, the investment of plan assets, the reporting and disclosure of plan
information, and the fiduciary provisions of ERISA.
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA): The major pen-
sion legislation enacted in 1974 to protect the rights of participants and bene-
ficiaries of employee benefit plans. For a plan to be considered tax-qualified,
plan sponsors must design and administer their plans according to ERISA’s
qualification standards and fiduciary responsibilities.
exhaustion of administrative remedies: The rule stating that in order to file
a lawsuit when your company denies your request for benefits, you must first
comply with all the plan’s administrative requirements for an appeal. Your
failure to do so can be reason to dismiss a subsequent lawsuit.
fiduciary: Any person who exercises any discretionary authority, responsibil-
ity, or control over a plan, the administration of a plan, or the management 
or disposition of a plan’s assets, or anyone who renders investment advice
regarding a plan’s assets for a fee.
326
Part VII: Appendixes 

fixed contributions: The mandatory contributions set by a pension plan that
an employer must make each year.
flexible contributions: Contributions that are considered flexible because
the employer can decide each year how much to contribute to its chosen
retirement plans. See discretionary contribution.
forfeiture: The loss or surrender of your nonvested benefits. Your vested
benefits are nonforfeitable. All or a portion of your plan benefits may be for-
feited if you haven’t completed the required number of years stated in the
plan’s vesting schedule.
Form 5500: An annual financial report that most retirement plans must file
with the DOL. You’re entitled to receive a copy of this document yearly and
free of charge.
graded vesting: The type of vesting schedule that allows employees to earn
the right to employer contributions made on their behalf gradually (usually
over a set period of years).
individual account plans: A type of retirement plan in which the employee or
the employer contributes to an individual account on behalf of the employee.
Those contributions are then invested on the employee’s behalf. Eventually,
the employee receives the balance in his or her account based on how much
has been contributed and how much the account balance has fluctuated
based on the investments’ gains or losses. Individual account plan is another
name for a defined contribution plan.
individual benefit statement: A statement prepared by the plan administra-
tor that describes your total accrued and vested benefits.
individual retirement account (IRA): A type of account that individuals can
set up in order to make contributions. An IRA isn’t sponsored by an
employer, but is created and funded by the employee. Contributions to a tra-
ditional IRA are tax-deductible when they’re made; distributions from a Roth
IRA are distributed tax-free.
in-service distribution: A plan distribution paid to a participant while he or
she is still working for the employer that sponsors the retirement plan.
inside of bankruptcy: The term that’s used when a debtor has filed for bank-
ruptcy; at this point, the debtor is within the control of the federal bank-
ruptcy laws, and his or her assets are considered part of the bankruptcy
estate.
327
Appendix A: Glossary

Internal Revenue Service (IRS): The branch of the U.S. Treasury Department
that’s responsible for administering qualified retirement plans and other
retirement accounts and for enforcing the Internal Revenue Code. If you fail
to pay your taxes, the IRS serves as the tax collector.
involuntary termination: A termination of a defined benefit pension plan ini-
tiated by the PBGC if it determines that plan termination is necessary to pro-
tect the interests of plan participants (such as when a plan doesn’t have
enough money to pay benefits when they’re due).
lump sum: A form of distribution in which all your pension benefits are paid
to you at one time in a single payment.
mandatory distribution: A distribution made to a plan participant, without
the participant’s consent, before he or she reaches the later of either age 62
or the normal retirement age under his or her plan.
match: The most popular type of employer contribution to a 401(k) plan, in
which your employer contributes to your account, based on a percentage of
your contribution, up to a certain maximum amount set by the plan or by law.
multiemployer plan: A plan to which two or more unrelated employers con-
tribute according to a collective bargaining agreement.
optional benefits: Those benefits that a plan may offer its participants, such
as the option to retire earlier than the plan’s normal retirement age.
optional forms of benefits: The different ways in which you can receive your
pension distribution, such as through annuity payments or in a lump sum.
outside of bankruptcy: The term that’s used when a debtor isn’t under the
jurisdiction of the federal bankruptcy court (and so the bankruptcy act and
rules don’t apply). The term usually implies that the person is in financial
trouble but hasn’t (yet) filed bankruptcy.
parties in interest: Those people who are so intimately connected to a plan
that they’re considered to have an interest in the plan. These folks may
include a plan fiduciary, a plan sponsor, and plan service providers. See 
disqualified person.
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC): The federal agency that was
established pursuant to ERISA for the purpose of insuring private defined
benefit pension plans. The PBGC takes over and runs failed plans, providing
payments to retirees if their plans terminate and are unable to make the 
payments.
328
Part VII: Appendixes 

pension fund: The fund that’s made up of employer and employee contribu-
tions. This fund must be kept separate from the employer’s assets.
pension investment consultant: The independent consultant who’s hired to
advise the investment committee on how the plan should invest its money.
pension plan: An arrangement to provide people with an income or pension
during retirement when they’re no longer earning a steady income from
employment. Pension plans, which are also called retirement plans or plans,
may be set up by employers, the government, unions, or institutions such as
employer associations. They’re typically classified as defined benefit plans or
defined contribution plans, depending on how the benefits are determined.
Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA): The notable pension legislation
adopted in 2006. This act significantly alters employer-sponsored defined
benefit plans by amending sections of ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code.
It affects defined contribution plans as well. The act includes new notice
requirements and other requirements to ensure that plans are properly 
overseen and implemented.
plan administrator: The individual, group, or entity named in the plan docu-
ment that’s in charge of day-to-day operations of an employer’s plan.
plan document: The complete written document that describes all the terms
and conditions for the operation of the retirement plan sponsored by your
employer.
plan participant: Any individual who’s participating in a pension plan and
has an account in the plan by virtue of his or her employment with an
employer that offers this benefit.
plan sponsor: The company, employer, or firm that establishes a retirement
plan on behalf of its employees.
plan trustee: A person or organization with the duty to receive, manage, and
disburse the assets of a plan. Plan trustees are similar to a board of directors.
plan year: A period of 12 consecutive months designated by the plan for
keeping its records. It can be a calendar year or a noncalendar fiscal year.
present value: The value, in today’s dollars, of promised future payments.
present value calculation: A calculation that’s used to determine the value,
in today’s dollars, of a sum of money to be received in a future year. The cal-
culation is based on a specific interest rate stated in the plan or required by
the IRS.
329
Appendix A: Glossary

pretax basis: Those contributions that are made to your account prior to taxes
being paid. Because the monies weren’t included in your taxable income at
the time that they were deferred or contributed to the plan, they’ll be included
in your taxable income when they’re eventually distributed to you from the
plan.
prohibited transactions: Those activities that fiduciaries or parties in inter-
est can’t participate in because of the possibility of pension insiders bene
fiting from their relationship to the fund or because they may be able to exer-
cise undue influence over the fund. ERISA prohibits transactions with parties
in interest.
qualified default investment alternative (QDIA): An investment option that
plans use when you fail to choose an investment in a plan that permits you to
choose investments for yourself (thus forcing your plan to invest your funds
for you). A QDIA must meet certain requirements, such as diversification, in
order to avoid liability. QDIAs must be managed by an investment company
or a fiduciary, and they must allow you to switch to another investment at
least every quarter.
qualified domestic relations order (QDRO): An order made by a state court
judge that divides a plan participant’s retirement plan benefits with a soon-to-
be ex-spouse (in cases of divorce). The order becomes a QDRO only after it
meets certain criteria and is approved by the pension plan trustee or plan
administrator. The person who approves the QDRO also qualifies the order.
qualified joint and survivor annuity (QJSA): An annuity or series of pay-
ments paid over your life and your spouse’s life if you, the plan participant,
die first. Because a QJSA takes into account your life as well as that of your
spouse, the amount of these payments will be smaller than if they were just
going to be paid through your lifetime.
qualified preretirement survivor annuity (QPSA): An annuity that’s available
for the life of your surviving spouse. For example, if you, the plan participant,
die before you retire and have vested benefits, your spouse will be entitled to
receive survivor benefits in the form of a QPSA. The plan can require that this
annuity not take effect until the plan participant would have been eligible to
receive benefits under the plan, or it can permit an immediate annuity for the
life of the spouse.
rate of return: The amount of money that you’re earning annually on your
investment. This rate is expressed in terms of a percentage. For example, if
you’re earning $1,000 per year based on a $10,000 investment, your rate of
return would be 10 percent.
required minimum distribution: The minimum amount that must be paid each
year to a plan participant starting at the required beginning date (age 701⁄2).
330
Part VII: Appendixes 

Retirement Equity Act (REA): An act designed to safeguard the rights of a
participant’s spouse in a qualified plan. The act requires that benefits be paid
only in a form other than a QJSA if the participant’s spouse consents.
retirement plan: See pension plan.
retirement-type subsidy: An additional benefit paid under a plan that’s above
and beyond the benefit paid under the plan’s normal benefit formula. Your
employer can’t retroactively eliminate these types of subsidies, which usually
include subsidized early retirement benefits or subsidized qualified joint and
survivor annuities.
revised summary plan description: See summary of material modifications.
rollover: A tax-free transfer of your pension money from one tax-deferred 
place to another. For example, you may move your money from one employer-
sponsored plan to another or from an employer-sponsored plan to an IRA.
self-directed account: An account in a defined contribution plan under which
the investments are selected by the plan participant. The investment elec-
tions are usually limited to a specific selection of mutual funds chosen by the
plan administrator.
single-employer pension plan: A plan in which a single employer contributes
to a plan covering its own employees.
standard termination: A termination of a defined benefit pension plan
approved by the PBGC where the plan has sufficient assets to pay all the 
benefits due under the plan.
summary annual report (SAR): A summary of the Form 5500 Annual Financial
Report, which most retirement plans must file with the DOL. This document
must be given to you yearly and free of charge. For plan years beginning after
December 31, 2007, the SAR will be replaced with an annual funding notice that
includes more detailed information than required in the SAR.
summary of material modifications (SMM): A document that informs you of
a change in your retirement plan. This document must be given to you free of
charge.
summary plan description (SPD): A summary of the retirement plan docu-
ment that tells you what the plan provides and how it operates. This is one of
the most important documents you’re entitled to receive. If your retirement
plan is ever changed or amended, a revised SPD or a summary of material
modifications will be sent to you.

Appendix A: Glossary

survivorship benefits: Pension benefits that are extended (after you die) to
your spouse under a defined benefit plan. Your benefits under a defined con-
tribution plan (and under some defined benefit plans) may be left to anyone
whom you designate as your beneficiary. If you’re married, however, you
need spousal consent to designate a non-spouse beneficiary.
tax-deferred contribution: A contribution that’s made into an account on your
behalf without any tax obligation being due from you at the time the contribu-
tion is made. With this type of contribution, you’re deferring the taxes until 
you withdraw the money. Being able to have a portion of your compensation
paid directly (deferred) into a pension plan account each year is considered 
to be an employee benefit because it allows you to put money away for your
retirement.
tax lien: A hold placed by the IRS on pension benefits to satisfy a plan partici-
pant’s unpaid tax liability.
tax-qualified plan: Any plan that qualifies for favorable tax treatment 
according to the applicable sections of the Internal Revenue Code and its 
regulations.
third-party administrator (TPA): A firm selected by the plan sponsor that
administers retirement plans. To administer plans, the firm determines eligi-
bility and the manner in which pension contributions will be allocated, pre-
pares the necessary forms (such as the Form 5500s, the annual returns, and
the participant benefit statements), and distributes and files the necessary
forms and notices.
underfunded: A defined benefit plan that doesn’t have plan assets sufficient
to pay the benefits accrued under the plan.
vested: A term meaning that your accrued benefits belong to you, even if you
leave the company before retirement age. The amount of time that you must
work before you’re vested depends on your plan’s vesting schedule.
voluntary distribution: A distribution that you’ve requested from the plan.
With limited exceptions, distributions can’t be made prior to your termina-
tion of employment with the employer sponsoring the plan.
year of service: A plan year during which you work or are paid for at least
1,000 hours. For most plans, 1,000 hours in a plan year is considered a year 
of service for eligibility, vesting, and benefit accrual purposes.

Part VII: Appendixes 

Appendix B
Tables and Charts
A
ppendix B contains a variety of tables and charts that we reference
throughout this book and that serve to provide you with more complete
information on different pension topics:
 The Comparison of Types of Tax-Qualified Retirement Plans chart can
help you navigate through the various retirement plans that we describe
in Chapter 3. The chart helps you quickly find the features of the type of
tax-qualified plan that you’re interested in.
 The Retirement Plan Dollar and Percentage Limits chart provides you
comparative information on contribution limits by dollars or percentage
of income. (Chapter 3 has more information about contribution limits.)
 The Uniform Distribution Table is used to determine the distribution
period for required minimum distributions to an employee from a retire-
ment plan or an individual retirement account (IRA). We discuss this
table in Chapters 5 and 9.
 The Single Life Table is used to determine the life expectancy of a benefi-
ciary of a deceased plan participant for purposes of required minimum
distributions from a retirement plan or IRA following the death of the
participant. See Chapter 9 for more about this table.
 The Joint and Last Survivor Table is used to determine the joint and 
last survivor life expectancy for purposes of determining required mini-
mum distributions for a participant and a spouse who’s more than ten
years younger than the participant. Head to Chapter 9 for more about
this table.
 Because the laws regarding IRA exemptions from creditors vary state by
state, we include the State Laws Protecting IRAs chart, which provides
an analysis of the treatment of IRAs as exempt property for each state,
including yours. We talk about this chart in Chapter 16.

Contributions under a defined contribution plan
(other than a cross-tested profit-sharing or a
target benefit plan) are generally allocated based
on a participant's compensation, without regard
to age or service (e.g. a 50 year old employee with
20 years of service and a 30 year old employee
with 5 years of service will receive the same
contribution if they have the same compensation).
Cross-tested and target benefit plans take the
participant's age into account and test
contributions for nondiscrimination purposes
based on future projected benefits.

In a defined contribution plan, income, expenses,

affect the value of the participants' individual
accounts. In a defined benefit plan, investment
income, etc. affect the funding standard account
only -- not the ultimate amount of benefits paid to
an individual participant.

Profit-Sharing, 401(k), Cross-Tested Profit-Sharing, and Money Purchase Pension Plans are all classified as defined contribution plans and are subject to many of the same restrictions.

ROTH IRA
EXEMPT
SPECIAL STATUTORY
PROVISIONS
The exemption does not apply to amounts 
contributed within 120 days before the debtor 
files for bankruptcy.
The exemption does not apply to amounts 
contributed within 120 days before a debtor 
files for bankruptcy.
A bankruptcy court held that the creditor 
exemption for IRAs violates the Arkansas 
Constitution — at least with respect to 
contract claims.
IRAs are exempt only to the extent necessary 
to provide for the support of the judgment 
debtor when the judgment debtor retires and 
for the support of the spouse and dependents 
of the judgment debtor, taking into account all 
resources that are likely to be available for 
the support of the judgment debtor when the 
judgment debtor retires.
Any retirement benefit or payment is subject 
to attachment or levy in satisfaction of a 
judgment taken for arrears in child support; 
any pension or retirement benefit is also 
subject to attachment or levy in satisfaction 
of a judgment awarded for a felonious killing.
An IRA is not exempt from a claim made 
pursuant to Title 13 of the Delaware Code, 
which Title pertains to domestic relations 
order.
IRAs are exempt only to the extent necessary
for the support of the debtor and any 
dependent.
The exemption does not apply to contributions 
made to a plan or arrangement within three 
years before the date a civil action is initiated 
against the debtor.
The exemption only applies for claims of 
judgment creditors of the beneficiary or 
participant arising out of a negligent or 
otherwise wrongful act or omission of the 
beneficiary or participant resulting in money 
damages to the judgment creditor.
The exemption does not apply to any amounts 
contributed to an individual retirement 
account if the contribution occurred within 
120 days before the debtor filed for 
bankruptcy.  The exemption also does not 
apply to the right or interest of a person in 
individual retirement account to the extent 
that right or interest is subject to a court 
order for payment of maintenance or child 
support.

ROTH IRA
EXEMPT
SPECIAL STATUTORY
PROVISIONS
A retirement fund of a person supporting 
another person is exempt from receivers or 
trustees in bankruptcy or other insolvency 
proceedings, fines, attachment, execution, or 
foreclosure by a judgment creditor.
Additions to individual retirement accounts 
are not exempt from judgments if 
contributions were made after a date that is 
90 days before the interposition of the claim 
on which the judgment was entered.
The account must have been in effect for a 
period of at least one year. Each individual 
account is exempt to a limit of up to $100,000 
per account, with an aggregate limitation of 
$200,000 for all accounts.  The dollar limit 
does not apply to the extent the debtor can 
prove the property is reasonably necessary 
for the support of the debtor, spouse, or 
dependents.
SEPs and SIMPLE IRAs are not exempt.
The exemption does not apply to amounts 
contributed to the retirement fund within one 
year before the debtor filed for bankruptcy.
The exemption does not apply to an order of 
court pursuant to a judgment of divorce or 
separate maintenance, or an order of court 
concerning child support.
The debtor's right to receive individual 
retirement accounts and Roth accounts are 
exempt to the extent reasonably necessary 
for the support of the debtor and any 
dependent of the debtor.
Exempts "certain retirement benefits" up to 
$250,000.00.  Cites §401(a)(13) of Internal 
Revenue Code (Tax-Qualified Plan 
Non-Alienation Provision).  
The exemption does not apply to amounts 
contributed or benefits accrued by or on 
behalf of a debtor within one year before the 
debtor files for bankruptcy.
The exemption does not apply to the extent
 that the interest of the individual in the 
retirement plan would provide an annual 
benefit in excess of $25,000.00.  If an 
individual has an interest in more than one 
retirement plan, the limitation is applied as if 
all retirement plans constituted a single plan. 
 The Code provides a table from which the 
annual benefit may be determined.

*Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, and Tennessee:  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Lampkins v. Golden, 2002 
U.S. App. LEXIS 900, 2002-1 USTC par. 50,216 (6th Cir. 2002) held that a Michigan statute exempting SEPs and IRAs from
