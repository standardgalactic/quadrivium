Acknowledgments
This book is also dedicated to all my students who come to 
my studio week after week, month after month, and year 
after year, and honestly help keep me sane. (No easy task!) I 
am in awe of your constant loyalty and heartfelt friendships. 
I cannot imagine life without you and our time together. 
My studio is truly a healing place where life gives us a tiny 
glimpse of heaven. Some say that room is the world’s best-
kept secret! Here’s to many, many more years together, solv-
ing all the world’s problems in our favorite room!
Also, I would be remiss if I didn’t mention my wonderful 
publishing company. North Light Books has been my home 
for more than fi fteen years now. I have had the opportunity 
to work with some of the best editors in the industry. Without 
their expertise and professional guidance, my books would 
not be as successful as they are. They have meant the diff er-
ence between mediocrity and awesomeness, and I couldn’t 
begin to thank them enough. To all the wonderful editors I 
have had the pleasure of working with, thank you, from the 
bottom of my heart. I’m already looking forward to next time!
Dedication
This book belongs to Mel “Tice” Theisen. A more patient and 
kind person you will never fi nd! His wonderful support in all 
that I do, and help with anything I could possibly need, gives 
me the freedom to reach for the stars. Also, being able to 
work from his awesome photography helps make me look 
better than I really am. Anyone who knows me will surely 
agree that I am a much better person for having him in my 
world. For all those things, I am forever grateful! 
I also want to thank and acknowledge my sister, Cathi, 
who has artistically inspired me my whole life. She is a gifted 
artist (better than me, in my opinion!), and has always been, 
in many ways, my mentor. She still does not fully understand 
the wonderful infl uence she has had on my artistic career. 
When I was a child, watching her create her artwork was truly 
magical, and the need to create was passed on to me.

Introduction
When I was younger and experimenting with my natural 
urge to draw, I created some pretty wild images. I was raised 
in the 60s and 70s, when the trend in art was using bright, 
fl ashy colors and psychedelic impressions. It was called pop 
art and was fantastically fun, especially when viewed under 
a black light where the colors turned neon and seemed to 
glow. I spent hours drawing and painting fun things in the 
craziest designs possible. Everything in art was loud and 
exaggerated, much like my personality back then. 
Later, however, when I entered my late teens, I felt the 
need to be more realistic. I abandoned my wild designs, and 
tried desperately to capture on paper life as I really saw it. It 
wasn’t easy, but I discovered that my natural artistic self was 
that of a realist.
When studying art history in school, I fell in love with the 
works of sixteenth-century Europe. The awesome realism 
Realism Meets Personal Flare
My sister, Cathi, is an awesome artist, and 
I want the world to see a sample of her 
beautiful work. This drawing is a wonderful 
representation of realistic colored pencil. 
Fall Leaves

captured by Michelangelo, Rembrandt, Rubens and Renoir 
fueled my desire to do the same. My journey had begun! 
To this day, I try to go to as many art galleries and museums 
as possible to study original masters’ works. I also take my 
students to the Nelson-Atkins Museum here in Kansas City, 
Missouri, to discuss the techniques and analyze the colors 
and brush strokes up close. Many don’t know that I am an oil 
painter as well, and I try to replicate the beauty I see in my 
favorite artists’ artwork from the past.
This book is all about creating realism in your own artwork. 
It isn’t easy, and it requires great patience. If you put in the 
time, your work will take on a colorful, multi-dimensional 
quality that every realist craves.
Practice the projects in this book one at a time, in the 
order in which they appear. It will give you the training you 
need to begin to fully develop your colored pencil skills.

Colored Pencil Provides Variety
Study the two diff erent types of fruit in this illustration. The one on 
the left is a peach, while the other is a nectarine. Both were drawn 
with the same pencils and the same colors, yet they look completely 
diff erent! The peach was applied using the layering technique, 
giving it a fuzzy, textured appearance. The nectarine was burnished, 
fi lling in the paper to make the fruit’s skin look shiny.

About Colored Pencil
kindergartner’s crayon drawing, and had none of the realism 
that I had achieved in my graphite drawings. Needless to 
say, it was frustrating and a huge blow to my artistic ego. 
I blamed myself for being untalented and put my set of 
colored pencils away. I returned to graphite drawing, which I 
had honed into my creative comfort zone.
A couple of years later, something in my brain clicked, and 
I woke up one day wanting to try them again. I realized in the 
recesses of my mind that I had simply been applying them 
incorrectly. In the pages that follow, I’ll share with you my 
experiences, and how I worked through various obstacles. 
You can get completely diff erent looks with colored pen-
cils depending on how you apply the color. Light, layering 
application gives you texture; heavy, burnished applications 
fi ll in the bumps and grooves of the paper, giving the art a 
smooth, almost painted appearance and a shiny surface. 
It is this versatility that makes colored pencil a wonderful 
medium for capturing many diff erent looks. 
Colored pencil is now one of my favorite medi-
ums! Welcome to the wonderful experience of 
colored pencil. Let me help make it one of 
your favorites as well.
Colored pencil can be daunting. I have written many books 
on the subject, and have learned more and more with each 
one. In previous books, I used a variety of brands and types of 
colored pencils. It was fun experimenting, but a bit confusing 
to the reader and the students trying to follow my techniques.
For that reason, I have chosen to simplify this book by 
using only one brand: Prismacolor. You will have no problem 
fi nding Prismacolor pencils in your local art and hobby stores. 
They are of excellent quality and will give you fantastic results.
When I fi rst tried colored pencil drawing myself, it was 
disastrous. My eff orts rendered something resembling a 

After
After I showed LeAnne how to improve her shapes and technique, 
her drawing became much more realistic. She now loves to draw 
with colored pencils.
You Can Do It!
A few years ago when I was writing a book about birds, my 
daughter wanted to draw one, too. I gave her a photo out of 
my reference fi le and let her give it a try. She was sixteen at 
the time and had little practice drawing with colored pencil. 
As you can see by her fi rst attempt, much of her “crayon training” 
as a child resurfaced, and the drawing came out looking less 
than refi ned. As an experienced teacher, I knew that all she 
needed was a little guidance, and a better understanding of 
colored pencil application.
Her second attempt looks a lot more professional. By 
understanding the technique better than before, and apply-
ing some accuracy to her shapes, her drawing takes on a 
much more realistic appearance. Good job, LeAnne!

This is a typical example of a beginner’s fi rst 
attempt at colored pencil. If your drawings 
resemble this, don’t worry!

The moral of this story is … you can do it, too! All you need 
is a little guidance and some practice to undo the old memo-
ries of drawing with crayons. Colored pencil doesn’t have to 
be intimidating once you get the feel of it. For me, it went 
from a frustrating experience to one of my favorite things to 
do. It doesn’t happen overnight, but rather with persistence 
and solid practice. Not everything you do will be perfect and 
ready for hanging on the wall, so go easy on yourself. It’s just 
part of the process of learning. (I have many trash cans in 
my studio, and I’m not afraid to use them.) In time, you’ll be 
pleasantly surprised!

Before
Created outside of class, this was Jake’s fi rst 
attempt using colored pencil techniques. 
While the drawing is cute, the technique 
lacks polish. 
One mistake he makes is using colored 
pencil and graphite together. The graphite 
blends into the color, giving it a gray look. 
Drawings by Jake Ruchotzke
After
This is Jake’s second attempt after my 
instruction. The colors have been applied 
more evenly, and the drawing looks much 
more refi ned. Jake drew the face larger on 
the page for a better composition, which 
makes it look more like a portrait instead of a 
sketch. This portrait is a real success story. 

G
etting started with colored pencil does not require you to go 
out and buy a huge range of colors in an expensive boxed set. If 
you have never drawn with them before, start slow. Begin with 
just a few colors at fi rst and buy more as you continue. On page 19, you 
can see a drawing I did with just two colors. The portrait of Tice takes on 
the look of an old sepia-colored photo. But, because I used just a brown 
and black pencil, it didn’t require a lot of supplies to complete. Look for a 
reference that will lend itself to this technique, and ease yourself slowly 
into colored pencil. By going this route fi rst, you can hone your tech-
nique without being bogged down by color theory.
Start With Fewer Colors
This drawing of a horse was completed 
with only seven colors. It does not 
take many colors to render beautiful 
drawings. As you get more comfortable 
with colored pencil techniques, you can 
expand your pencil palette to include 
more colors.

the pencils
Prismacolor Pencils
Prismacolor pencils have a thick, soft, wax-based lead that 
provides a heavy application of color. They are excellent 
for achieving smooth, shiny surfaces and brilliant colors. 
The colors can be eas  ily blended to lend an almost painted 
appearance to your work. 
Each brand of colored pencil creates 
a unique look on paper. I can’t easily 
answer which pencil is the best to 
use or which one I like the most. That 
really depends on the fi nal outcome 
and overall look I wish to achieve. 
To keep it simple, I’m using only 
Prismacolor pencils in the examples 
and demonstrations of this book. 
However, feel free to experiment and 
fi nd the colored pencils that work 
best for you. By using a combin ation 
of pencils, you can create a lot of 
variety to the techniques used in the 
following pages. 
Prismacolor carries richly pig-
mented, wax-based colored pencils 
in more than 132 diff erent pigments. 
The thick, soft, wax-based lead allows 
you to lay down heavy layers of color. 
They are opaque (meaning you can’t 
see through them), and can com-
pletely cover the paper’s surface. The 
colors can be easily blended to pro-
duce an almost painted appearance 
in your work, or applied gradually and 
evenly with a very sharp point for a 
more layered look. 
Pencils come in a variety of set 
sizes. Buy enough pencils to practice 
some simple drawings, and then add 
to your color selection as needed. As 
your collection grows, you can create 
a system to keep them organized. I 
place my pencils into color groups, 
bind them with a hair tie or rubber 
band, and keep them in an old brief-
case. This may not be the fanciest way 
of doing things, but it works for me. 
And if I need to take them with me, I 
close the briefcase, and off  I go!

Various Art Supplies
materials for working in color
As with anything, the quality of your colored pencil art-
work is determined by the quality of the tools you employ 
for the job. The following is a list of supplies you will need 
to succeed.
PAPER
Quality paper is critical. There are many fi ne papers on the 
market. As you try various types, you will develop your 
personal favorites.
Before you try a paper, always check the weight. Many 
papers are just too thin. I learned this the hard way after 
a beautiful drawing of my daughter formed a permanent 
crease when I picked it up. No amount of framing kept my 
eye from focusing on it fi rst. So, you don’t want paper that 
easily bends when you pick it up. 
• Artagain by Strathmore is 60-lb. (130gsm) cover-weight 
paper that comes in a variety of colors, has a somewhat 
fl annel, speckled appearance and a surface with no 
noticeable texture. It is available in both pads and single 
sheets for larger projects.
• Renewal by Strath more is very similar to Artagain, but 
has the look of fi bers instead of speckles. I like it for its 
soft earth tones.
• Crescent Mat Board is my personal favorite because 
of the fi rmness. It doesn’t have to be taped down to a 
drawing board, making it easy to transport. 
• Crescent Suede Mat Board is another favorite of mine. It 
has a surface like suede or velveteen. Prismacolor pencils 
look like pastel when applied to this fuzzy surface. It 
comes in a variety of colors and can be purchased at 
your local frame shop.
PENCIL SHARPENERS
Many colored pencil techniques require a very sharp point 
at all times, making pencil sharpeners an important tool. 
An electric sharpener or battery-operated one allows 
you to insert the pencil straight on, reducing breakage. 
Handheld sharpeners require a twisting motion that tend 
to break pencil points. If you prefer a handheld sharpener, 
purchase a quality metal one with replacement blades.
ERASERS
Although colored pencil is very diffi  cult, if not impossible, 
to completely erase, erasers can be used to soften colors. 
Here are the three you will need for colored pencil:
• Kneaded erasers are like squishy pieces of rubber, good 
for removing your initial line drawing as you work. They 
will not damage or rough up your paper surface.
• Pink Pearl erasers are good for general cleaning and 
large areas, such as backgrounds. These, too, are fairly 
easy on the paper surface.
• Typewriter erasers look like pencils with little brushes 
on the end. Highly abrasive, they’re good for removing 
stubborn marks. They can also be used to get into tight 
places or to create clean edges. Be careful, though; these 
can easily damage the paper and leave a hole.
MECHANICAL PENCILS
These are great for initial line drawings. Because the lines 
are so light, they are easily removed with kneaded erasers, 
unlike ordinary drawing pencils. As you work, replace the 
graphite lines with color.
ACETATE GRAPHS
Acetate graphs are overlays to place over your reference 
photos. They have grid patterns on them that divide your 
picture into even increments, making it easier to draw 
accurately. 
I use them in both 1" (2cm) and 1⁄2" (1cm) divisions. They 
are easy to make using a permanent marker on a piece of 
acetate. You can also draw one on paper and have it copied 
to a transparency on a copy machine.
12

Match Your Colors With a Simple Color Finder
Punch one hole into two plain white pieces of paper or index cards. 
Place one hole over your reference photo or image to help you 
focus on the color. Place the second hole over your artwork to help 
you match the color. 
Create Long Pencils With Super Glue
Create a collection of elongated pencils by gluing an old one to a 
new one. Take what is left of the pencil and add a drop of super glue 
to the tip of a new, unsharpened pencil, and put the two together. 
(Only super glue works.) Run another drop around the joint for 
additional strength, and allow it to dry overnight. Make sure you 
hold the extended pencil closest to the sharpened end so it doesn’t 
snap apart. You can even sharpen right through the joint therefore 
extending the life of your pencils!
TEMPLATES
Templates are stencils that are used to obtain perfect 
circles in your drawing. Use them to get pupils and irises 
accurate.
REFERENCE PHOTOS
For practice, the best source for drawing material is maga-
zines. Tear out pictures of every subject and categorize 
them into diff erent bins for easy reference. Don’t replicate 
the exact images, just use them for practice.
CRAFT KNIVES
Craft knives can be used as drawing tools. The edge of 
the knife can gently scrape away color to create texture 
such as hair or fur. A knife can also be used to remove 
unwanted specks that may appear in your work. Take care 
with this approach to avoid damaging the paper surface.
FIXATIVES
Spray fi xative binds your artwork to the drawing surface. 
I use two diff erent types of fi nishing sprays.
• Workable fi xative  is undetectable when applied. 
Though you can continue drawing with graphite and 
charcoal once the spray has been applied, you cannot 
with colored pencil. The wax in Prismacolor pencils 
actually rises to the surface, making the colors appear 
cloudy and dull. Workable fi xative behaves as a resist, 
stopping this blooming eff ect and making the  colors 
true again.
• Damar varnish gives a high-gloss shine to Prismacolor 
drawings, making it look like an oil painting and the 
colors shiny and vivid. (Its primary use is to seal oil 
paintings.) This is great for drawings of fruit, fl owers 
and portraits.
DRAFTING BRUSH
Colored pencil leaves specks of debris as you work that 
can create diffi  cult-to-erase smudges if left on the paper 
or brushed away by hand. A horsehair drafting brush gen-
tly cleans your work area without smudging your art.
PENCIL EXTENDERS
These handy little tools are great for holding a short pen-
cil. The additional length they provide allows you to keep 
going, and gives you more length to stick into a pencil 
sharpener. It not only extends the length, it extends the 
life of the pencil.
COLOR FINDER
Use this homemade tool to identify and match the color in 
your drawing to the color in the reference photo. See the 
caption at left for instructions.

Cool Colors
Most of the colors on this page, with the

LEE’S 
LESSONS
It is important to 
understand the traits of 
warm and cool colors. 
Warm colors are often 
used to refl ect light off  
of subjects and appear 
to come forward. Cool 
colors are often used in 
shadows and appear 
to recede.
Study fi nished art 
and note how the artist 
uses warm and cool 
colors to create the 
piece’s light source and 
center of interest.

here are two basic techniques that you’ll need to know for work-
ing with Prismacolor colored pencils: layering and burnishing. 
Choose your approach depending on the subject matter you are 
attempting to capture, or the look or texture you’re trying to evoke. 
In many cases, a drawing will require you to combine techniques. 
Analyze the variety of surfaces in your piece and decide whether to use 
layering, burnishing or both to create them. Burnishing can be very 
useful for shiny objects or for fi xing a fl at background. If you are near the 
completion of a layered project and you feel something is missing, bur-
nish the background to make your subject matter pop from the page.
Bouncing and Refl ecting Colors
Not only can the use of color change 
the way something looks, color can 
actually bounce around and attach itself 
to objects. This Baltimore Oriole likes to 
come and drink the nectar we put in our 
hummingbird feeder. In this drawing, 
I captured the bright red color of the 
feeder refl ecting the brilliant yellow color 
of the bird. 
Look around you and see if you can 
see color bouncing and refl ecting off  
objects and surfaces in your home.

Burnished Butterfl y
This monarch butterfl y is much more vivid in color, and the powdery 
nature of the wings is not as evident. Burnishing makes the colors 
brighter and more intense. To make it stand out even further, I chose 
to fully develop the background with bright colors.

Sometimes it is not easy to decide whether to layer or 
burnish. The good thing is, if you begin with layering, you 
can always choose to deepen your tones and burnish an 
area if it doesn’t turn out the way you want. In most cases, a 
drawing will require both techniques, since the surfaces of 
people, places and things are all so diff erent. 
These butterfl ies are drawn using two entirely diff erent 
techniques, and each one has a unique look.
17

Step 1
Lightly draw two spherical stones on your 
drawing paper with a mechanical pencil.
Step 2
With Sandbar Brown and a sharp point, 
add some color to the stones. This is their 
undertone. With Cool Grey 70%, create the 
shadow edges to make the stones appear 
round (see more instruction on spheres 
on page 28). Make sure to leave the small 
area of refl ected light showing along the 
edges. Use a light touch when applying the 
colored pencil, and allow the paper texture 
to show through. Do not build up the tones 
too heavily.
With Cool Grey 70% and Black, create the 
cast shadow beneath the stones. 
layering
All colored pencil drawings begin with 
layering. It is done by applying the 
pencil with light layers, keeping a sharp 
point on the pencil at all times. The 
hallmark look of layering is when the 
texture of the paper shows through 
the pencil, giving it a somewhat grainy 
appearance. With the layering tech-
nique, you will also be able to see your 
Step 3
Add a small amount of Sand over the other 
colors to darken the stones. Add some of 
this color below the cast shadow as well. 
Practice creating this soft, layered look on 
other types of objects.
Colors Used
Sandbar Brown, Sand, Cool Grey 70%, Black
pencil strokes, giving your works a 
more hand-drawn appearance. 
Always remember, it requires 
patience to build the tones. Hurry-
ing with colored pencil will create an 
unevenness in the application and ruin 
the look of your drawing. Do not over-
lap too many diff erent colors, or they 
will build up and become opaque. 
18

Layering in Color
When layering in color, make sure you don’t 
overlap the colors to the point that they 
become opaque. Again, you should see the 
graininess of the paper showing through 
the colored pencil. 
Colors Used
Poppy Red, Crimson Red, Tuscan Red, Blue 
Violet, Indigo Blue, Limepeel, Grass Green, 
Dark Green, Yellow Chartreuse, Yellow 
Ochre, Dark Brown, Canary Yellow, Orange, 
Light Aqua, Aquamarine, Black, White
Layering Requires Patience
Using the layering technique requires 
patience, especially to create deep tones, 
but it’s well worth it for these results. This 
portrait of Mel “Tice” Theisen was created on 
ivory-toned mat board with just two tones.
Colors Used
Dark Brown, Black
19

burnishing
When you burnish, you apply colored 
pencil heavily with a fi rm pressure 
that makes the pigment totally cover 
the paper surface. Because of the wax 
content of Prismacolor pencils, the 
pigment goes on with a creamy feel, 
and the colors become very opaque 
with the heavy pressure. This can 
make the colored pencil mimic the 
look of oil painting, with bright colors 
and a shiny impression. Many of the 
subjects I used to paint in oils I now do 
in colored pencil with similar results. 
When you burnish layers of pencil, 
the colors mix together like paint 
instead of remaining independent. 
The texture or grain of the paper is 
fl attened by the pencil pressure, and 
the pigment and wax of the pencil 
fi ll it in completely. When practicing 
this technique, use pencils with a bit 
duller point to balance out the heavy 
pressure of application.
Step 1
Lightly draw the cherries’ shapes with a 
mechanical pencil. With a light touch and 
Carmine Red, layer the undertone of the 
cherries. Draw in the shadow edges of the 
cherries with Crimson Lake. (Refer to the 
sphere exercise on page 28 more instruc-
tion.) Add a hint of the cast shadow below 
them with Black.
Step 2
Using the same colors as in step 1, reap-
ply the colors using a heavier touch. Use 
enough pressure that the colors completely 
fi ll in the paper and it is no longer visible.
Start with Carmine Red, the undertone 
of the cherries. Be sure to leave the light area 
of the highlight open. Deepen the color of 
the shadows and curves with Crimson Lake. 
Deepen the color of the shadow edges with 
Dark Purple. Be sure to allow an edge of 
refl ected light to still show through. Just like 
the sphere exercise, this makes them look 
more rounded. 
With Black and a sharp point, create the 
left side and base of the cherry stems.
Step 3
Continue deepening your tones using fi rm 
pressure so the colors burnish together. 
With White, fi ll in the highlight areas to make 
the surface look shiny. Add Yellow Ochre 
to the right side of the cherry stems. Add 
a small amount of Crimson Lake over the 
Yellow Ochre on the right side as well. This is 
called refl ected color, which is bouncing up 
from the cherries below. 
To complete the drawing, enlarge the 
cast shadows below the cherries with 
Black. The direction of the shadows tells us 
the angle of the light source. Add a small 
amount of Yellow Ochre to the cast shadow 
to make it appear more realistic.
Colors Used
Carmine Red, Crimson Lake, Dark Purple, 
Yellow Ochre, White, Black

LEE’S LESSONS
You may notice a milky haze forming on your drawing as you 
burnish with wax-based colored pencils. The colors will look like 
they have a fi lmy coating over them. This is perfectly normal. It is 
just the wax of the pencil separating from the pigment and rising 
to the surface. You can buff  it a bit with your fi nger or a tissue and 
it will go away; however, it will soon return. To correct this problem, 
it is important to spray your drawing with a fi xative when you are 
fi nished. This seals the color, and prevents the wax from separating. 
Beware, though! Fixative alters the surface of the paper, aff ecting 
the way the pencil is applied. Spray your work only when you are 
entirely fi nished with it.
Burnishing in Action

do a lot to help this fantail goldfi sh stand out, but it’s the burnishing 
that really gives it shine and helps create the texture of the scales.

value scales/gradation
Regardless of which technique you are using when apply-
ing colored pencil, the pressure you apply is the most 
important part. Learning how to control your pressure 
to create an even application of tone is crucial to good 
colored pencil work.
While drawing value scales is not very exciting, it is a 
very important skill to know. It is the gradual application of 
tone that makes things look realistic. The drawing below is 
a great example of soft, subtle tonal changes. 
Look at these value scales. You can see the diff erence 
the application makes when it comes to how the colored 
pencil works. Each of these was created with Dark Brown, 
but the way the color was applied to the paper makes 
them all look very diff erent.
Correct Gradation
This is an example of a well-executed value scale. This was done with 
both burnishing and layering using very controlled pencil lines so 
the tones are even and full. This makes the tone gradual, with the 
tones gently fading from dark to light with no choppiness. Keep 
practicing to make your scales look like this. It is simply a matter of 
getting the “feel” of the pencil. Apply more pressure in the dark areas, 
and then gradually lighten your touch for the lighter areas. 
Incorrect Gradation
Gradation of tone is essential for good work. This looks choppy and 
very much like crayon. 
This example shows what usually happens when someone is 
new to colored pencils. The pencil strokes are way too visible and 
uneven for this to look good.
The Surface Can Aff ect Your Tones
This is also a well-executed gradation using the same color, but on 
suede board instead. You can see how the texture of the board not 
only changes the appearance, but seems to change the color as well.
Before you begin any project, test your colors on a scrap of the 
paper or board you are using to be sure of their appearance.

about color
A good understanding of colors and 
how they work is essential to drawing. 
It all begins with the color wheel, which 
shows how colors relate to one another. 
PRIMARIES AND 
SECONDARIES
There are three primary colors: red, 
yellow and blue. They are pure colors. 
Mixing these colors in diff erent 
 combinations creates all other colors. 
Mixing two primary colors makes 
a secondary color; for instance, red 
mixed with yellow makes orange. Sec-
ondary colors can be found in between 
the primary  colors on the color wheel. 
WARM AND COOL COLORS
The warm colors consist of yellow, 
yellow-orange, orange, red-orange, 
red and red-violet. The cool colors are 
violet, blue-violet, blue, blue-green, 
green and yellow-green. 
COMPLEMENTARY COLORS
Complementary colors are opposites 
on the color wheel; for example, red is 
opposite green. Complements can be 
used in many ways. Mixed together 
in equal amounts, complements 
become gray. For shadows, it is always 
better to mix a color with its comple-
ment rather than adding black.
A complementary color can also be 
used to make another color stand out; 
for instance, to make the color red 
stand out, place green next to it. This 
is used most frequently when work-
ing with fl owers and nature. Because 
almost all stems and leaves are green 
and many fl owers are red or pink, the 
fl owers have a very natural way of 
standing out.
SHADES AND TINTS
A shade is a darker version of a color. A 
tint, on the other hand, is a lighter ver-
sion. Shades and tints are the result of 
light and shadow.

Complementary Colors: Red vs. Green
Notice how the red in this fl ower stands out, 
even though it is drawn just like the other 
two examples. 
Complementary Colors: Blue vs. Orange
The orange tones of the fl ower are highlighted because of the blue background. Burnished 
background tones are a great way to provide stark contrast in your drawings.
Complementary Colors: Yellow vs. Violet
In this drawing, the yellow of the fl ower really 
pops out because violet is its complement. 
using color
Color can completely change the way something 
appears, and artwork can be altered by using diff erent 
color combinations. This fl ower is drawn the same each 
time using three colors: Canary Yellow, Orange and 
Crimson Red. However, each time I drew it I changed the 
background color. The results surprised even me! This is 
a good way to experiment with colors. See what you can 
do using the color wheel as a guide. When looking around 
for things to draw, I think you will be surprised how color 
aff ects the overall look of objects, and how important it is 
in a successful piece of art.

Complementary colors enhance 
one another. When you incorpo-
rate complements into your overall 
composition, you can achieve stun-
ning results that pop from the page. 
Whether you’re creating original art-
work or working from photographs, 
always consult the color wheel to 
help you choose exciting, vivid color 
combinations.
25

fi ve elements of shading
In order to create realistic drawings, 
you must be able to draw three-
dimensional forms and understand 
how light aff ects those forms. There 
are fi ve elements of shading that can 
be found in every three-dimensional 
shape. Practice creating these diff erent 
tones. Once you’ve mastered them, 
you can draw just about anything.
1 Cast shadow 
 This is the darkest part of your 
drawing. It is underneath the 
sphere, where no light can reach. 
2  Shadow edge 
 This is where the sphere curves and 
the rounded surface moves away 
from the light. 
3  Halftone area 
 This is the true color of the sphere, 
unaff ected by either shadows or 
strong light. 
4  Refl ected light 
 This is the light edge along the rim 
of the sphere that illustrates the 
roundness of the surface.
5  Full light 
 This is where the light is hitting the 
sphere at its strongest point. 
Value Key for Five Elements of Shading
The key to making things look multi-dimensional 
is contrast. This is what the tones of the sphere on 
this page look like when separated into a color key 
and placed in a value scale. 
When drawing, transition colors from very 
dark to very light, allowing the tones to overlap 
and fade into each other. To create a sphere, you 
need to have at least fi ve tones, hence the fi ve 
elements of shading.

basic shapes 
Basic Shapes in a Basic Object
Sometimes one object will be made up of 
multiple basic shapes. A cube, a sphere and 
a cylinder make up the basic structure of 
this footstool.
All subjects, no matter how complex, 
consist of underlying basic shapes. 
Learn to recognize these basic shapes, 
and you can draw anything by apply-
ing the fi ve elements of shading! 
The sphere. This shape is seen in all rounded 
objects such as fruit, vegetables and even the 
parts of a person’s face.
The egg. This shape is seen in birds, animals 
and the human head.
The cylinder. This shape is seen in arms, 
legs, trees and structures such as jars, 
glasses and cans.
The long cylinder. This 
shape can be seen in tree 
limbs, pipes, columns and 
other tubular structures.
The cone. This shape is seen in pointy objects 
such as party hats, building structures and vases.

1 
CREATE THE LINE DRAWING 
AND BEGIN THE SHADOWS
Tracing a round object, such as a glass 
or jar, or using a circle template or sten-
cil, lightly draw a circle with a mechani-
cal pencil and a very light touch. 
Determine where the light is coming 
from. With Dark Umber and a very sharp 
point, apply the cast shadow opposite 
the light source, here, below the circle 
on the lower left, indicating the light is 
coming from the right side. With a very 
sharp point, apply the shadow edge, 
leaving a small edge of refl ected light 
along the bottom of the circle. Be sure 
to apply the pencil lightly so the lines 
are not obvious. Use curved lines to rep-
licate the shape and form of the sphere. 
Straight pencil lines would represent a 
fl at object.
2 
PLACE THE HALFTONES
With Poppy Red and a very sharp 
point, overlap the Dark Umber and 
gradually move out to create the 
halftone. Maintain the same light touch 
and curved lines as used in step 1. Allow 
your tones to gradually fade into the 
color of the paper. It is important not to 
have any choppiness.
Apply some of the Poppy Red to the 
cast shadow as well, allowing it to fade 
into the paper. Shadows become lighter 
as they move away from the object.
3 
OVERLAP TO COMPLETE 
THE TONES
With Canary Yellow and a very sharp 
point, overlap the other colors and 
continue adding to the sphere. Allow 
the color of the paper to show in the 
full light area.
draw a sphere
Now it is time to practice applying what you’ve learned so far by drawing a 
sphere and an egg. This will help you commit the fi ve elements of shading to 
memory. By practicing simple shapes such as these, drawing more diffi  cult 
subjects later will be much easier.
Let’s start with the sphere. Take your time, and make it look as good as 
possible. For more practice, try it again on your own, using diff erent colors 
and diff erent shades of paper.

from the front, so the shadows are in 
the middle and along the sides.
Now, let’s apply the same techniques you used on the sphere to an egg.

using a grid to draw from photos
A Half-inch Grid
A One-inch Grid
Everything we draw can be done 
more accurately if we look at our sub-
ject matter as a group of interlocking, 
abstract shapes. Placing a grid over 
our reference photos can help us see 
things more objectively by dividing 
everything into small sections. The 
squares help us see our subject mat-
ter like a puzzle. You can even further 
your objectivity by turning the photo 
upside down.
There are two diff erent ways to 
grid your reference photos. The fi rst 
way is to have a color copy made 
of your photo. If the photo is small, 
enlarge it as well. Working from small 
photos is the biggest mistake most 
students make. The bigger the photo, 
the easier it is to work from.
Use a ruler to apply a one-inch or 
half-inch grid directly onto the copy 
with a permanent marker. Use the 
smaller grid if there is a lot of small 
detail in your photo. There is less room 
for error in the smaller box, so little 
things are captured more easily.
If you do not have access to a copier 
and your photo is large enough to 
work from, you can place a grid overlay 
on top of the photo. Make your own 
grid with a clear plastic report cover 
and a permanent marker, or have one 
printed from a computer on an acetate 
sheet. Then place the grid over the 
photo and work from that.
Once you place the grid over the 
photo, the image becomes a puzzle 
and each box contains shapes. Look at 
everything you want to draw as just a 
bunch of interlocking shapes.   
To draw the photo, draw a grid 
on your drawing paper with your 
mechanical pencil. Draw the lines 
so light you can barely see them 
because they will need to be erased 
later. This grid should contain the 
same size and number of boxes as 
the one over the photo.
You can enlarge the size of your 
drawing by placing the smaller grid 
on your reference photo and making 
the squares larger on your drawing 
paper. For instance, if you use the 
half-inch grid on the photo and a one-
inch grid on your paper, the image 
will double in size. Reduce the size of 
the drawing by reversing the process. 
As long as you are working in perfect 
square increments, the shapes within 
the boxes will be relative. 
30

create a line drawing with a grid
Create a Grid on Your Paper
On your drawing paper, lightly draw the same number of squares you see here.
Fill in the Shapes
Working on one box at a time, capture the shapes you see in each box. Go slowly and be accurate. The entire 
outcome of the drawing hinges on this stage of the game.
This exercise will show you how to 
draw from a graphed image. For now, 
don’t worry about the colors in this 
photo; just concentrate on using the 
grid as a guide to capture the basic 
shapes in an accurate line drawing. 
LEE’S 
LESSONS
For the exercises in 
this book, there is one 
exception to using 
the grid method: it 
cannot be done on 
suede board, because 
the mechanical pencil 
lines cannot be erased. 
Instead, use graphite 
transfer paper to trans-
fer your line drawing 
to the suede board. See 
Lee’s Lessons on page 
99 for more details on 
transfer paper.
Remember, you can increase the size 
of your drawing by drawing larger 
squares on your paper. Keep this 
fi nished line drawing for the step-by-
step exercise on pages 116–117.

BEGIN THE SHADOWS AND BUILD THE HALFTONES
With Sand, fi ll in the main color of the teapot, leaving the 
white of the paper exposed for the highlight areas. Apply Dark 
Brown to the outside edges of the teapot, making sure to vary 
them in line width and darkness. 
The light source is coming directly from the front, so the 
shadows are cast along the sides and behind the teapot. Use 
Dark Brown to add the cast shadow under the teapot and on 
the wall behind it, then begin building the halftones on the 
teapot, fading the tones toward the full-light area. The basic 
form of the teapot is now complete. You can see the refl ected 
light along the rim and bottom of the teapot.

After practicing the sphere and the egg, you can now advance to a more 
complicated object, such as this teapot. The overall shape is basically a 
sphere, and the handle, top and spout add unique dimensions.

ing sure your colors look even and

Finish the teapot by adding Black 
Raspberry to the contours to give the

Add a small amount of this color into 
the shadow areas behind and below 
the teapot.

PLACE THE FRAME OVER A PHOTO
Place the viewfi nder over your photo so only a small 
portion of the image is visible. This changes the photo into a 
composition of abstract shapes.

CREATE THE LINE DRAWING
Draw a square on your drawing paper 
the same size as the viewfi nder. With your 
mechanical pencil, freehand the shapes of 
your photo as accurately as possible. Use the 
outside of the square as a guide, visualizing 
how far from the edge the shapes are.
capture shapes with segment drawing
Just like using a grid, segment drawing breaks down large shapes into 
smaller, more manageable increments. It follows the same principles, but 
deals with only one large square instead of a grid of many squares. In this 
method, you crop very closely into a reference photo and concentrate on 
only shapes and lines.

CONTINUE LAYERING AND FINISH DETAILS
Continue layering the color with a very sharp pencil 
point, keeping the tones as even and smooth as possible. 
Once the Peach has fi lled in to create a good skin tone, add 
more Dark Brown to the shadow areas to intensify the look 
of refl ected light. It is most obvious along the edges of the 
face, along the edge of the tip of the nose and along the 
lips. Strengthen the dark tones with Black to create greater 
contrast. Be patient; this technique takes time to create 
smooth tones.
5 
FILL IN THE BACKGROUND AND MIDDLE VALUES
Fill in the background with Black to form the edges of 
the face, eliminating the outlines. Create the skin tone with a 
light layer of Peach. Vary the tone depending on the strength 
or weakness of the light source refl ection, and deepen the 
shadows with Dark Brown. The refl ection is strong under and 
alongside the nose, so use fewer layers of color there. Add a 
bit of Pink where the light directly hits the lip.
4 
ADD THE BASIC SHADOWS OF THE SUBJECT
Add shadows to the face with Dark Brown, using a very 
sharp pencil point. Note that the strong light source is com-
ing from the left, forming distinct shapes and edges of the 
shadows on the lower part and right side of the face.
Viewfi nders Can Be Any Size or Shape
Use your imagination to create viewfi nders in any size and shape. 
The smaller the opening, the more you will be able to divide your 
photo into unrecognizable shapes, thus making it easier to draw. 
Enlarge a smaller project. For instance, the face in this exercise 
could be blown up and drawn on a much larger scale. It would 
make an awesome drawing for the wall.

THINGS TO 
REMEMBER
• All colored pencil drawings 
begin with layering.
• If you begin with layering, 
you can always go back and 
burnish an area if it doesn’t 
turn out the way you want.
• When practicing burnishing, 
use pencils with a duller point 
to balance out the heavy 
pressure of application.
• Regardless of the technique 
you use, the pressure you 
apply is most important.
• For shadows, it is always better 
to mix a color with its comple-
ment than to add black.
• A shade is a darker version of a 
color. A tint is a lighter version.
• The fi ve elements of shading 
can be found in every three-
dimensional shape.
• To create a sphere, you need 
to have a least fi ve tones.
• Enlarge a reference photo if it 
is small. This makes it easier to 
work with.
Draw a border using a Black Prisma-
color pencil around each drawing for a 
cleaner-looking presentation. 
Start your own segment-drawing 
notebook as soon as possible and try 
to draw at least one image a day. You 
can do it. They are small exercises and 
don’t take very long, but the experi-
ence you gain is huge!

nderstanding the sphere and the fi ve elements of shading is 
vital for beginning artists. It is the basis for so many diff erent 
types of subjects—simply look around you. Think of this chap-
ter as the fl agship of your drawing instruction. With practice, you will be 
able to combine all of the basic shapes into any object you can imagine.

draw grapes
Grapes have a shiny skin that refl ects light in a unique way. Before you 
begin to draw, study how the light hits your subject to locate all the shad-
ows and edges of your drawing. Notice how the individual edge of each 
grape varies in the bunch. Where two grapes overlap, there is a light edge 
of refl ected light. Where the grapes contrast against the white background, 
there is a darker edge. It is always important to fi gure out the undertone, or 
lightest color of the drawing, before you begin.

CREATE THE LINE DRAWING
Sketch or trace a circle with a 
mechanical pencil. Lightly place in the 
Peach undertone, allowing the white 
of the paper to remain in the highlight 
areas. Lightly apply Black Raspberry 
along the edges of the grape, and cre-
ate the inside shadow edges.
2 
DEEPEN THE TONES
Add some Carmine Red to the 
shadow edges and continue to deepen 
the areas of Black Raspberry with more 
of the same. At this stage of the draw-
ing, the colors are still layered.
3 
BURNISH THE TONES 
TOGETHER
Burnish the colors to give the grape a 
shiny appearance. With Carmine Red, 
apply pressure and overlap the darker 
areas. Once the colors look smooth, 
take the White pencil and burnish into 
the highlight areas. If you aren’t happy 
with the way it looks, you can go back 
and forth with the colors, adding more 
lights or darks. Whenever you add a 
color to the drawing, make sure to bur-
nish the colors together with the lighter 
color and blend them together.
A Refl ective Bunch of Grapes
Grapes are round, shiny and refl ect a lot of 
light. Study your subjects for light and dark 
edges before you begin to draw.

red apple with highlights
An apple study is excellent practice for drawing a round, sphere-like subject. 
Because it has a waxy, shiny surface, the lighting of an apple is very distinct. 
The glare refl ecting off  the apple is usually dramatic. 
 When drawing colorful subjects, add the colors in layers, beginning with 
the lightest. I started this apple by drawing in the yellow undertones fi rst. If 
you look at the fi nished example, you can see how important the yellow is 
because it shines through the other colors.

1 
SKETCH THE APPLE AND APPLY THE BASE COLOR
Lightly draw the shape of the apple with a mechanical pencil. With Canary Yel-
low and fi rm pressure, fi ll in the entire apple, excluding the highlight areas. These 
spots should be left as the white of the paper. With Scarlet Lake, begin adding 
red tones to the shadow areas of the apple. Be sure to use curved pencil lines to 
help create the illusion of roundness. The apple skin has a lot of streaks, and these 
curved lines help create them. Use Tuscan Red to begin the stem and the shadow 
area around it.
2 
BUILD THE MIDTONES
Build the red tones with Scarlet Lake. The color is deeper toward the bottom of 
the apple and along the sides. Add some Tuscan Red to deepen the shadow areas. 
(Refer to the fi nished drawing for placement.) Again, the curved pencil lines are 
essential. While this drawing is utilizing the burnished technique, the streaks of the 
pencils’ lines should still be seen.
3 
FINISH THE DRAWING
Continue building the tones using a fi rm pressure until the colors become deep 
and rich. Be sure to allow the yellow to show through in areas, and the red to streak 
in curved lines. For deep red tones, use Tuscan Red and a thin layer of Black on the 
shadowed side of the apple. Burnish the Black with Tuscan Red to soften the color. 
Notice the tiny edge of light around the lower left side of the apple. Do not color 
the deep tones all the way to the edge. This will produce a rim of refl ected light and 
help create the illusion of dimension.
To fi nish the drawing, burnish White into the highlight areas, overlapping the red 
and yellow tones to create a refl ection of light. Complete the stem by placing Dark 
Brown on the right side and Limepeel to the left. To create depth in the stem, add a 
touch of Black along the top and sides, and to the rear shadowed area. To complete the 
stem, add a tiny bit of Limepeel on the apple skin behind the stem on the right side.

pear with a cast shadow
This exercise is drawn with many of the same colors as the apple project on 
the previous page. However, the shape has changed and the lighting is dif-
ferent, casting an obvious cast shadow.
1 
SKETCH THE PEAR AND PLACE 
THE UNDERTONES
Lightly draw the shape of the pear 
using a mechanical pencil. Base in the 
entire surface of the pear with Canary 
Yellow, except for the two highlight 
areas, which should be left as the white 
of the paper. Use fi rm pressure to bur-
nish the entire area. Create the shape of 
the cast shadow under the pear on the 
right side.
With Orange, lightly layer some color 
along the left and right sides of the 
pear. Apply a small amount of Limepeel 
to the right side as well.
2 
DEEPEN THE TONES AND 
CREATE THE CAST SHADOW
 Continue building the Orange color to 
deepen the hue, still leaving the white 
areas alone. Leave some yellow show-
ing along the bottom of the pear and 
along the edge of the recessed area on 
the pear’s base. Like the sphere exercise 
on page 28, this will form the rim of 
refl ected light to make the pear appear 
more rounded.
With Dark Brown, create the dark 
side of the stem. Also apply some of 
the Dark Brown to the recessed area 
on the bottom.
Add both Dark Brown and Limepeel 
to create the cast shadow, noting how 
it is divided in half with the two colors. 
3 
FINISH THE DRAWING
To fi nish the pear, continue the lay-
ers of color until the 3-D look is created. 
Apply Scarlet Lake to the left side of the 
pear to create a beautiful red glow and 
the illusion of the shape of the pear. 
Make sure to curve your pencil strokes 
to follow the contours of the pear.
Use Tuscan Red along the bottom of 
the left side to create the shadow area, 
and also add some of it into the cast 
shadow. Also apply the Tuscan Red to 
the upper left side of the pear and to 
the stem to complete it.
With White, burnish the highlight 
areas to make them appear shiny.

Now let’s go to a more complicated composition using many of the same 
colors used in the grape exercise on page 37. The colors used in the pumpkin 
and apples are deep and rich because of the light source and deep shadows, 
and are intensifi ed by the use of complementary colors in the background. 
Sketch out the shapes of the pumpkin and apples, using my drawing as 
a guide. Use a mechanical pencil so you can make corrections if you need 
to. Don’t worry if your drawing is not exactly like mine. With still-life objects 
such as fruit, perfection isn’t that important. It is the technique of applying 
colored pencil that is the focus.
1 
APPLY THE UNDERTONE AND INITIAL
 LAYERS OF COLOR
Create this drawing with many, many layers of color. Once 
you have the outline drawn, apply the fi rst layer of colors to 
the pumpkin and apples. As we did in the previous exercises, 
apply the Canary Yellow as the undertone. Because of the 
deep shadows of this piece, the yellow is more evident on 
the left side. 
After the Canary Yellow is applied, add Pumpkin Orange 
to the right side of the pumpkin. Use this color to create the 
ridges of the pumpkin skin. Add some of this color to the 
right side of the apples, too.
With Dark Brown, create the cast shadow of the apple 
onto the left side of the pumpkin in the yellow area. Add 
the Dark Brown to the lower area of the pumpkin to create 
the shadow area. This makes the pumpkin appear rounded. 
Apply Scarlet Lake to the right sides of the apples.
2 
DRAW THE BACKGROUND AND STEMS
Use Aquamarine for the background color behind the 
fruit. To create the dark color below, fi rst layer some Dark 
Brown, and then layer Black on top of it. Allow the Dark Brown 
to show around the edges of the shadow.
Create the stems of the fruit with Dark Brown. Use the 
Dark Brown to create the cast shadow that separates the two 
apples, and to deepen the shadow area on the pumpkin.

CONTINUE TO BUILD COLORS AND FINISH THE 
BACKGROUND
Finishing the drawing is really just a matter of doing more of 
the same. The colors continue to build up with every layer, 
until it becomes deep and rich. 
Be sure to pay attention to refl ected light, which is 
extremely important when drawing rounded objects. 
Refl ected light is seen anytime there is an edge or rim. You 
can see it along the edges of the apples, and along the upper 
edge of the pumpkin. But it is also seen along every ridge of 
the pumpkin, which makes those areas seem to protrude. 
Use Orange in these edges to make the refl ected light more 
obvious. Burnish the Orange in the front of the pumpkin to 
make the color shine. Burnish Canary Yellow into the apples 
to make them shiny, too. 
When the colors of the fruit are nice and deep, fi nish the 
drawing by detailing the stems with Dark Brown, Black and 
White. Again, make sure to include refl ected light around the 
upper edges.
Deepen the background with more Aquamarine, and 
layer Black directly behind the fruit for more depth of tone.
Add some of the Scarlet Lake to the ground in front. You 
can see how the shadow area becomes lighter as it moves 
away from the fruit. Make the shadows more intense under 
the fruit by layering Black on top. 
41

practice drawing rounded objects
Now that you’ve completed a few step-by-step exercises, 
try some drawings on your own using your acetate grid. To 
become profi cient in colored pencil drawing, it is impor-
tant to learn the patience required for layering color. These 
illustrations combine many of the drawing elements we 
reviewed on the previous pages. The overall shape is still a 
sphere. Follow the shapes of light and shadow to recreate 
common objects such as these lemons, pear and apple. 
Have fun and remember that good drawing takes time!
To Layer or Not to Layer
Sometimes you may not decide until the fi nal stages of a drawing 
whether it will be layered or burnished. I mostly used the layering 
approach to draw this bowl of lemons. During the fi nal stages of the 
drawing, I decided to burnish the background and the bowl’s cast 
shadow with Black to intensify the piece.
Practice Makes Perfect
Once you have mastered the basic techniques of drawing with col-
ored pencil, you can create more complicated drawings. This draw-
ing shows what is possible when you know how to draw a pear. 
Change the Colors of a Common Object
It is amazing to me how brilliant and realistic 
colored pencil can be. Here is another way 
to use the skills you just learned. Simply 
change the colors, and you can change the 
entire look! A simple apple can make a very 
dramatic drawing.

ellipses
So what happens when round objects no longer look 
perfectly round? If you look at a cylinder, you know that if 
you viewed it from the top it would look like a circle. But, 
when viewed from the side, you see a circle in perspective. 
This perspective represents distance and changes a circle 
into an ellipse.
Perspective Creates Ellipses
Circles viewed from the side, such as this wagon wheel, are no longer perfect circles. Seen in 
perspective, the circle appears fl attened and stretched out. The degree of perspective of an 
ellipse depends on the angle in which it is viewed.
Horizontal Ellipse
This is a circle viewed from above. Instead of 
a thick appearance, like the vertical ellipse, 
this ellipse seems fl attened out.
Vertical Ellipse
When viewed from a diff erent angle, 
perhaps closer to a side view, the shape 
appears thinner than the full circle. This is 
called an ellipse, which by defi nition is a 
circle in perspective.
Standard Circle
This is a circle viewed straight on.
LEE’S 
LESSONS
When drawing 
elliptical objects, you 
should be able to fold 
each ellipse in half in 
either direction, with 
all parts matching. 
This is called the equal 
quarters rule. 
Look at the wagon wheel below. If it was still on the 
wagon it would look like a perfect circle. But the wheel is 
lying on its side, so we see it in perspective. Receding lines 
are made shorter than they are in reality to create the illu-
sion of depth. This is a phenomenon called foreshortening. 
It is what turns a circle into an ellipse.
43

Observe the Cylinders and Ellipses in Everyday Objects 
Look around your home and observe just how many cylindrical 
household items fi ll your everyday life, such as bottles, vases, jars, 
candles and glasses. This antique butter churn is a complex col-
lection of textures, cylinders and ellipses. Notice the many ellipses 
along the top of the lid of this churn. When drawing, alter your 
edges a little at a time until your ellipses appear correct.

everyday cylinders
Drawing cylinders is all about keen observation and under-
standing your drawing subject’s lighting, perspective and 
texture. Flower stems, tubes, snakes and trees all have the 
same cylindrical elements to capture.
The top portion of a cylindrical object, viewed in any 
perspective, is always in the shape of an ellipse. It is impor-
tant to draw these accurately because the entire perspec-
tive of the object hinges on it. 
Study these everyday objects, and see how each one of 
them is made up of both a cylinder and an ellipse. 
Ellipses in Light
These candles are 
long cylinders. 
Because of the 
vantage point and 
the irregular tops, 
the ellipses are not as 
noticeable. Observe 
how the fi ve elements 
of shading diff er for 
each candle. The 
candle on the left is 
set against a very dark 
background making 
the edges appear very 
light. The candle on 
the right is set against 
a light background, 
making the right side 
of the candle appear 
dark. It is important 
to fully understand 
the lighting of your 
subject before you 
begin to draw.
Ellipses in Perspective
This spool of thread is 
drawn from a bird’s-eye 
view, which changes 
the perspective 
dramatically. The top 
of the spool appears 
much larger than the 
bottom, even though in 
reality they are identical 
in size. Keep in mind 
that ellipses within a 
drawing can change 
depending on your 
point of view.

BURNISH AND DEEPEN THE TONES
 Burnish over the colors with White to make 
them blend together. Reapply the Dark Umber 
to deepen the tones. Use Black to intensify the 
dark areas of the tree bark, giving it the illusion of 
heavy texture.
A tree limb or trunk is also a cylinder, just with a lot of texture. Use this 
exercise to practice drawing the cylindrical shape of a tree. Even though the 
surface is irregular and textured, the basic form is still a cylinder with the 
eff ects of light and dark creating the roundness.

LEE’S 
LESSONS
The edges of an ellipse 
should always be 
curved, with no fl at 
areas. The ends of an 
ellipse, at the tightest 
curves, should never 
appear pointed.
45

There is a mathematical way to produce an ellipse based on the degree of 
pitch and its angles. But you don’t need a formula to tell you when an ellipse 
is off . This drawing looks complicated, but it really isn’t. Follow along, and 
you can see for yourself. 
1 
CREATE AN ACCURATE LINE 
DRAWING 
Sketch the vase’s basic shape with a 
mechanical pencil. When drawing 
any object, having accu racy from the 
beginning is essential. It allows you the 
freedom of blending and shading with-
out having to make structural changes. 
Altering the shape is very diffi  cult after 
the tones have been added.
2 
OUTLINE THE ELLIPSES
The ellipses encompass the surface 
of the vase, all the way around. Drawing 
through the object to complete the 
ellipses helps the pot look symmetrical 
and realistic. You can cover your lines 
when you add color in the next steps, 
drawing through will help you visualize 
your shapes.
LEE’S 
LESSONS
When an ellipse is 
drawn incorrectly, your 
brain screams that 
something is wrong. 
Here are three tips 
to drawing ellipses 
correctly:
1 Remember, you are 
drawing a circular 
shape; there should 
be no fl at spots or 
pointy areas in the 
smallest area where 
the ellipse curves.
2 Visualize all sides of 
the elliptical object 
and draw the com-
plete ellipse before 
shading. Try to see 
through it.
3  Remember, you 
should be able to 
fold your ellipse in 
half, with all sides 
matching.

DEFINE THE HIGHLIGHTS AND BACKGROUND
This pot is full of refl ections and highlights. Lightly outline 
the shapes of the refl ections of windows using Blue Violet 
Lake. Using the same color, redraw the elliptical lines in the 
upper rim of the pot, and below it to show the curves. 
Burnish in the lightest undertone of the pot fi rst using Sky 
Blue Light, leaving the bright highlight areas exposed as the 
white of the paper.
With Clay Rose, fi ll in the inside area of the pot. Use 
enough pressure to fi ll in the paper completely with color. 
With Seashell Pink, fi ll in the base of the pot, the inside area 
of the upper rim and along the neck of the pot as seen in the 
illustration. This begins the look of refl ective color.
Move to the background. Use a ruler to divide the back-
ground into three sections. The tri-color background gives 
the drawing more contrasts and interest than a solid color 
would provide. By placing these colors behind the subject, 
the edges of the pot are defi ned. Burnish in Sky Blue Light 
in the top section. (Since the edge of the pot is white, this 
background color creates the upper edge.) Move on to the 
middle section with Clay Rose. Use light layering and a very 
sharp point to create an even tone to give the drawing some 
textural diff erence. Leave a small white strip below the Clay 
Rose. Next, lightly layer Black around the edge of the pot. Be 
careful not to lose the nice, round, symmetrical shape. Finally, 
layer some more Sky Blue Light in the lower section. 
4 
CONTINUE BURNISHING
Burnish more Sky Blue Light inside the rim and above 
the pot to make it deeper in tone. Use Blue Violet Lake to add 
more color to the inside rim and body of the pot. On the pot, 
use a circular motion with the fl at of the pencil lead, not the 
point. This will give the illusion of the speckling seen in the 
glaze. Look closely at the illustration and you can see where I 
used these circular strokes, and where the pencil lines are just 
drawn in.
Switch to Denim Blue, and build the dark tones on the pot. 
Intensify the color on the left side of the pot and the inside 
edge, being careful to create the window patterns in the 
highlight areas. Use this color to add the shadow edges to 
build the form and roundness of the pot.
Burnish the areas of Seashell Pink to make them more 
fi lled in. Burnish the black of the background to make it solid. 
Add Black under the pot to create a shadow. Deepen the col-
ors of the tabletop, burnishing with fi rm, horizontal strokes of 
Greyed Lavender, Clay Rose and Sky Blue Light, allowing the 
colors to overlap one another. This gives the look of a shiny, 
refl ective surface.
47

5 
FINISH THE DRAWING
Continue burnishing the colors. This process takes some time, but is more than worth the work 
involved. Study the example carefully, and you can see where I used the circular strokes, inside and out, to 
create the look of the glaze. To make the highlights look bright and shiny, burnish over them with White. 
Deepen the shadows by adding a small amount of Black. You can see it along the neck of the pot and 
along the left side. It is also seen in the edges of the rims. Add a bit of Black to the surface of the pot as 
well, using small, circular strokes.
Continue burnishing the tabletop, alternating colors to make it look streaky.

THINGS TO REMEMBER
• When drawing colorful subjects, it is important to add the colors in layers, 
beginning with the lightest.
• Figure out the undertone, or lightest color of the drawing, before you 
begin.
• Using a circular motion with the 
fl at of the pencil lead will give you 
the illusion of speckling like that 
found in pottery glazes.
• Look for the fi ve elements of 
shading, particularly refl ected 
light, when drawing rounded and 
spherical objects.
• Foreshortening is when the shape 
of an object appears distorted 
because of the angle in which it is 
being viewed.
• An ellipse is a circle in perspective.
• Your eyes will tell you when an 
ellipse is not symmetrical.
• An ellipse can always be divided 
into four equal parts. You should 
be able to fold it in half either 
direction with all parts matching.
• The edges of an ellipse should 
always be curved, with no fl at 
areas. The ends of an ellipse, at 
the tightest curves, should never 
appear pointed.

 Rectangular 
Objects & Perspective
M
any ordinary, everyday objects are angular in shape and 
made up of squares and rectangles. If it has a fl at surface and 
a corner, chances are its basic shape is a cube.
You learned in the previous chapters how to use tone and gradual 
shading to create the soft curves of a rounded object. The rules really 
change when you are dealing with rectangular objects. Instead of 
soft edges you have hard edges, where two sides come together. The 
changes in tone are more abrupt, because each side will take the light 
diff erently, giving them diff erent tones.
Every time you have a hard edge, you will also have refl ected light. 
Always remember, everything with an edge, lip or rim has refl ected light 
along it. Look around for the cube shape in everyday household items. 
Tables, chairs, books and stairs all share the same basic shape as their 
foundation. Even a soft, stuff ed chair is geometric in shape.
More Than Just Your Point of View
Without understanding the rules of 
perspective, it would be impossible to 
create a drawing of your home, like I 
did here. I’ve seen many a drawing or 
painting fall short because of inaccurate 
perspective.
Study and practice the exercises in 
this chapter and you will acquire a bet-
ter eye for perspective. It will help you 
see all the angles and slants that are so 
important in your drawings.

perspective basics
Entire books have been written about perspective. Basi-
cally, images change depending on the vantage point from 
which you view them. Areas that are closer seem much 
larger, while areas farther away seem to shrink. In realistic 
drawing, you must always remember this. Your artwork 
refl ects where you are in relation to your subject matter.
Two-Point Perspective at Eye Level
In this example, the cube’s horizon line falls right in the middle of the horizon line. You are 
viewing the cube straight on and are standing on the same level as it.
Get Out the Ruler!
When drawing rectangular objects, make 
sure that all vertical lines are perfectly 
straight and parallel to the edges of the 
paper. This will help ensure accurate 
perspective.
One-Point Perspective
A train track or road is large up front and 
converges into a point in the distance. When 
everything converges at one point out on 
the horizon it represents one-point perspec-
tive. That point is called the vanishing point. 
The vanishing point rests on the horizon line. 
This horizon line represents your own eye 
level when looking straight ahead.
Vanishing point

51

Two-Point Perspective Above Eye Level
The entire cube is above the horizon line, which means you are 
viewing it from a lower vantage point. You have to look up at the 
cube. If this were a building, you would be at the bottom of a slight 
hill, looking up the street. The light is coming from the left, making 
the side on the right appear darker.
perspective and vantage point
Above the Horizon Line, or Worm’s-Eye View
This cube is elevated, fl oating above the horizon line. It is much 
higher than eye level and you see its bottom. Can you see how the 
lines converge at the horizon line at the same points?
Below the Horizon Line, or Bird’s-Eye View
This time, we are much higher than the cube and the horizon line, 
looking down on it.
An Example of Inaccurate Perspective
This birdhouse is nothing but a little rectangular box in two-point 
perspective. Because it was made by a child, the surfaces don’t fi t 
together well, and it is a bit out of plumb. I decided not to fi x this in 
my drawing because I like the innocence of its construction and the 
story it tells. Even though the perspective is off , I love the pastel col-
ors of the wood against the background and the leaves in the trees.
Perspective can be daunting to the beginning artist, 
because it appears mathematical and complicated. 
Like anything else, a basic understanding and some 
practice go a long way. When viewing art, the fi rst 
step is locating the horizon to determine your van-
tage point, or the angle at which you are viewing an 
object (e.g., straight on, above or below).

everyday rectangular objects
Even Your Favorite Chair Is a Cube
This comfy chair is nothing more than a 
complex cube. Each cushion and arm rest is 
rectangular, as is the pillow. Look for rectan-
gular things in your own house to draw to 
give you practice with perspective.
Once you begin to look, you’ll see 
cubes all over. While all these sub-
jects are completely diff erent in the 
way they look and the function they 
perform, each one is made from the 
A Stack of Books in Perspective
Study photos of rectangular objects, like 
these books, and analyze the rules of 
perspective. Basic underlying shapes are 
the same. See how the rules of perspective 
apply to them? They seem to get smaller 
toward the back. If you drew lines continu-
ing out from the sides, those lines would 
converge at a common point in the horizon, 
creating a V shape.
A good way to better your understand-
ing of perspective is to study magazine 
photos of houses and furniture. Take a ruler, 
carry the lines out from the edges and see 
where the lines meet with the horizon.
Draw Stairs as Cubes
This staircase is made up of cubes (the stairs) and two cylinders (the 
columns). Each stair has four fl at surfaces that make up its rectan-
gular shape. Because of the perspective, you view each stair from 
a diff erent height and angle. The stairs seem to become smaller as 
they ascend, and you cannot see the top surface of the upper stairs. 
This is an illusion that can be very confusing when trying to draw. 
Our brains know that each stair is the same size, but our eyes see it 
diff erently. That is why understanding perspective is so important. 
same basic underlying shapes. Prac-
tice drawing rectangular objects in 
perspective, and it will soon become 
second nature to you!

demonstration
draw a room
When learning perspective, start with a simple one-point perspective draw-
ing, such as this living room scene. In the working drawing of step 1, notice 
how everything in the room meets at a single point in the center of the 
drawing. The arms of the couch, the edges of the coff ee table and even the 
books underneath lead to this one point. 
Each vertical line in the drawing—such as the legs of the table, the sides 
of the couch and the edges of the cups—are all perfectly vertical with no 
slants. 
1 
CREATE A WORKING DRAWING
Sketch your drawing’s main shapes with a mechanical pencil following the 
rules of one-point perspective. To begin the rendering, remove all the working lines 
with a kneaded eraser and use Dark Umber to start adding the dark tones in the 
shadow areas.

ADD THE DARK TONES
Add the dark tones once the 
working lines have been carefully 
removed. The darkest tones of the 
drawing are located in the shadow 
areas of the blanket on the couch and 
under the pillows and cushions. There 
are also dark shadows under the items 
on the table and on the couch legs. 
3 
FINISH THE SCENE
Complete the drawing using a sharp point. Use the layering technique to 
achieve a great number of tones ranging from dark to light. Remember, any object 
with an edge or rim has refl ected light. Allow your darkest tones to  emphasize 
your light tones.

This drawing is one that I created for a children’s book that I wrote and illus-
trated called A Snow Globe for Angel. One of the characters in the story 
is a little boy named Andrew who lives in a mansion on a hill. I created this 
house purely out of my imagination, based on how I envisioned the scene. It 
was fun to draw, so I selected it as a project for you. It is a benefi cial exercise 
for learning perspective. 
1 
CREATE THE GRID AND LINE 
DRAWING
Use the grid method to capture the 
shapes of the house based on this 
fi nished reference drawing. The grid is 
a helpful tool for emphasizing that the 
vertical lines of the house are perfectly 
vertical. This is very important.
2 
LOCATE THE HORIZON 
The horizon line for this drawing is very low since we are 
looking at the house from the bottom of a hill. Notice how 
the perspective lines seem to go off  the page toward a point 
on the horizon line that we can no longer see.

DEVELOP THE FRONT AND 
EDGES OF THE HOUSE
The lighting in this scene is coming 
from the right, illuminating the front of 
the house. Use White to fi ll in the front 
areas. Because of the tone of the paper, 
the white tones really stand out.
To create the edges along the right 
side of the house, add Dark Green to 
start the shapes of the trees. Roughly 
apply these tones with the side of the 
pencil; no details are really necessary at 
this stage. Note that the left side of the 
house is partially blocked because of a 
tree. Apply the shapes of this tree the 
same way, using Dark Green.
3 
REMOVE THE GRIDLINES AND 
CHECK THE PERSPECTIVE
Once you have the basic outline of the 
house drawn on your paper, remove 
the grid lines carefully with your 
kneaded eraser. Check your perspective 
using this guide. Follow the work-
ing lines to see where they go, and 
where they will eventually converge 
on the imaginary horizon line. You can 
use a long ruler to fi nd the point of 
convergence outside the paper edge, 
and then pivot the ruler down from 
one point on the house to another. To 
ensure accurate angles, hold the ruler 
tight on the horizon line point.
Use a ruler to straighten all your 
lines, especially the verticals. This stage 
is extremely important to hone the 
look of the fi nished drawing, so don’t 
rush these important steps, even if they 
seem tedious!
57

5 
DARKEN THE TONES AND BEGIN THE DETAILS
The left side of the house is darker because it is not facing the light. Using Cool Grey 70%, create the 
deep shadow directly under the upper front of the house behind the pillars. Use Cool Grey 50% to fi ll in 
the triangular areas on either side of the chimney. Lightly add Cool Grey 50% to the rest of the left side 
of the house. Then, add some Aquamarine over the gray as shown. Use the Aquamarine to create the 
shadow side of the pillars and on the house behind the pillars. Add some Aquamarine to the sky with 
horizontal strokes, and to the grassy area as well.
With Spring Green, add some color to the trees and the grassy area. Detail is not important; just 
use the fl at of the pencil to rough it in. Create the trunk of the trees with Dark Brown. This is not a solid 
line—it is broken up because of the tree limbs. Using Pink and the side of the pencil, loosely apply the 
colors of the fl owers. The illusion of garden fl owers is created even though you are adding little detail. 
Add Mediterranean Blue to the shutters. Create the chimney with Peach on the lighter side and 
Pumpkin Orange on the darker side. Also use Peach on the roof. With White, render many repeating 
ellipses to create the look of cobblestones on the driveway. Add some Aquamarine to the stones closer 
to the house to achieve a shadowed look. Add more color to the sky by adding Pink and White to the 
Aquamarine. Use light, horizontal strokes to create the illusion of clouds.
58

6 
FINISH THE DRAWING
To fi nish the drawing, deepen every color’s tone. Since I was not using a refer-
ence photo, I slowly added colors until I liked the look. Study the fi nished piece 
closely and you will see where all the colors have been intensifi ed. The biggest 
change was in the grassy area and the fl owers. Use White to give the fl owers more 
depth, and add Chartreuse to brighten the color of the grass. Add Dark Green to 
create the illusion of shadow.
Use White to lighten the right side of the tree trunk, and to add highlights to the 
bricks on the front of the chimney. To create the patterns of the other bricks, use 
Dark Brown with a sharp point and a ruler. Be careful to follow the perspective lines 
when outlining the bricks. Add some Cream to the cobblestones along the lower 
portion of the driveway and also to the sky. It is a subtle color, but it adds a nice 
fi nishing touch.
THINGS TO 
REMEMBER
• Everything with an edge, 
lip or rim has refl ected light 
along it.
• When drawing perspective 
remember that closer areas 
appear larger while areas 
farther away seem to shrink.

W
hen teaching, I fi nd that 
many of my students will 
avoid heavily textured 
items because they seem too com-
plicated or diffi  cult. Textures can be 
a wonderful addition to your artwork 
and can open the door to many fun and 
challenging projects. 
Uniquely textured objects can be 
found all around you. From the curtains, 
towels and blankets of your bedroom 
to the wood, stone and brick that make 
up the building where you live. Home 
improvement magazines and catalogs 
also off er a wealth of examples to help 
sharpen your skills. Start practicing, 
because learning to draw fabrics, folds 
and textures accurately can open up a 
whole world of artistic possibilities. 
Practice Drawing Unique Textures
This pineapple is made up of a variety of interesting 
patterns and textures. Notice how the segments of the 
pineapple change depending on the lighting. They 
appear dark on the left side, with the underside of the 
fl aps lighter in color. On the right side, the segments 
appear more of a yellow color, with the underside of the 
fl aps darker in color. I used both layering and burnishing 
techniques to create the diff erences in surface textures.

the fi ve basic folds
There are fi ve basic folds to look for when drawing fabric: 
drape, column or tubular, interlocking, coil and inert. Each 
one has very distinct characteristics, and each one should 
be committed to memory. 
Fabrics contain soft edges where the material gently 
curves, as well as hard edges where it creases and over-
laps. Many of these areas resemble the cylindrical shapes 
we studied in chapter three. The fi ve elements of shading 
are also applied when drawing the folds to make it look 
realistic. 
1 Drape Fold 
This fold is created when fabric is hung by two points of 
suspension. Can you see how diff erent the towel looks 
in this example? The fabric creates a U or V shape, and is 
often seen in things like cowl neck sweaters and shawls, 
or any time fabric is hung over something. The refl ected 
light is also obvious.
LEE’S 
LESSONS
Extreme lighting 
is often the most 
important element 
of artwork, off ering 
much more interesting 
shadows and contrast 
than an ordinary light 
source. Look for inter-
esting ways to light 
your subject matter 
when taking reference 
photos. 
Notice how the 
background colors of 
the pineapple on the 
previous page shift, 
going from deep, dark 
color on the left to 
bright, sunny color on 
the right. 
Drape Folds
61

2 Column or Tubular Fold 
This is the most common fold, 
and is often seen in clothing and 
drapery. To recognize it, look for 
the cylindrical, tube-like folds that 
are created by the fabric being 
suspended by one point. It requires 
the same principles as drawing a 
cylinder, so go back and review 
chapter three for practice. Look at 
how refl ected light is seen along 
the edges where the fabric folds 
and overlaps.
3 Interlocking Fold 
This fold is created when fabric falls 
in layers, and the folds nestle inside 
one another. This is often seen in 
bulky clothing such as coats and 
sweaters. Note that the recessed 
areas are deeply shadowed.
4 Coil Fold 
This fold is created when fabric is 
sewn into a tube shape and wraps 
around a cylindrical object. It is 
most obvious in sleeves, socks and 
pant legs. The fold takes on a spiral 
appearance.

4 Coil Fold
2 Column or Tubular Fold
62

Most Inert Folds Contain Other Folds
Look at this example of a blanket resting against a couch back. Most 
inert folds will also contain other types of folds as well. This blanket 
contains column folds where it hangs off  the edge. Look closer and 
you can fi nd some interlocking folds as well.
3 Interlocking Fold
2 Column or Tubular Fold
5 Inert Fold
5 Inert Fold 
This type of fold is found when fab-
ric is not suspended at all. A piece of 
fabric lying on another surface will 
have creases and folds that go in 
every direction.
63

demonstration
practice drawing a towel
Here is the fi rst step toward drawing fabric realistically. Follow the directions 
carefully, and you will see how everything we learned before about cylinders 
and the fi ve elements of shading applies to fabric as well.
This towel is divided into four separate cone-shaped folds. By using the 
layering technique, the texture of the paper shows through, creating the 
texture of a terry cloth towel.

1 
SKETCH THE TOWEL
With a mechanical pencil, 
lightly sketch the shape of the 
towel. There are four distinct 
columns created in the fabric, 
each resembling a cone. 
2 
ADD THE SHADOWS AND 
BEGIN LAYERING COLOR
With a light touch, use Black to add 
the shadow in the creases, separat-
ing each column fold. With Light 
Green, gently fi ll in the entire 
towel. Switch to Aquamarine and 
apply the shadow edges to each 
column, allowing the light of 
the paper to show through.
64

3 
DEEPEN THE TONES AND SHADOWS
With a sharp pencil, deepen the overall green color of the 
towel once more with Light Green and the layering tech-
nique. Deepen the Aquamarine tone in the middle crease 
of the towel and in the other shadow areas as shown. With 
Black, deepen the shadow edges. 
4 
FINISH THE DRAWING
Repeat the previous process until the color of the towel 
deepens to a solid blue-green tone. Be sure to leave areas of 
refl ected light along each of the edges, particularly where the 
fabric overlaps. This is what makes the surface look rounded, 
not fl at. 
When you are happy with the look of your drawing, add 
the border with Black and a very sharp point. Be sure the 
border follows the direction of the fabric, moving in and out 
of the folds.
65

wooden textures
Simply put, the key to creating 
convincing wood textures is patience 
with creating multiple layers of 
various colors. It is very important 
to follow the direction of the grain 
when drawing wood. Wood usually 
has a very distinct pattern to it, and 
the pencil lines should replicate the 
design. Notice that in the illustration 
of the door, the wood grain is verti-
cal. In the illustration of the lizard, the 
wood grain is horizontal. 
Wood in Bright Light
This drawing of a has many of the same colors and techniques as the drawing of the 
wooden door handle at right. However, to represent the intense light of the sun, the colors 
have been burnished to appear brighter. The orange color of the wood is refl ected in the 
textured skin of the lizard, and the blue of the sky is repeated in the white part of the wood 
above him.

draw wood grain
Most wood grain has many colors and patterns. It’s easy to draw when 
broken down into these three layers: the undertone, the pattern and the 
shine on top.
2 
DEEPEN THE TONES
Start with the lightest color fi rst—in this case, the Yellow 
Orange. Using the layered approach, place the wood grain 
lines down horizontally. With Dark Brown, create the oval 
shapes of the wood grain. Add some horizontal lines with 
Tuscan Red to create more of the wood grain. 
3 
BURNISH THE COLORS AND FINISH THE DRAWING
Continue to build up the colors with more pressure until they burnish 
together. Keep applying pencil lines, alternating back and forth between light and 
dark until the look of wood grain is achieved.

SKETCH THE LINE DRAWING
Lightly sketch the patterns of the wood grain with a 
mechanical pencil. Go over the lines with Dark Brown and a 
sharp point.

brick
Bricks create an interesting back-
ground pattern to a drawing because 
each brick is totally diff erent from 
another. No two are exactly alike.
It is important to draw bricks accu-
rately and in perspective. Refer to the 
perspective basics on page 51 when 
choosing to include bricks in your 
drawings. Without the proper angles 
and vantage point, placing bricks in 
your drawing could throw the whole 
thing off .
Practice Drawing Contrasting Textures 
and Colors
I am drawn to subjects that have multiple 
contrasting textures, like this drawing of a 
decanter on the mantel. The smooth, shiny 
surface of the glass against the bricks is not 
only a contrast of texture, it is a complemen-
tary color scheme. There are thousands of 
textures in the world, and each one off ers 
artists a wonderful creative opportunity.

Orange. Add Tuscan Red to the sides 
and bottom edge of the bricks. Add 
some Tuscan Red to the surface on top 
of the orange color. With Cool Grey 
50%, add the mortar around the bricks.
2 
BURNISH THE COLORS AND 
HONE THE EDGES
Build up the colors so they burnish. 
Add Dark Umber to create some of the 
darker color and texture. (Note that 
these bricks do not have the same 
amount of texture as the one in the fi n-
ished illustration on page 68.) Use White 
to create the lightest color on top. Use 
Black to create the edges.

Preserve Your Travel Memories With Drawings
This was a pot I saw on a recent trip to Pompeii, an ancient city 
located in western Italy that was buried by the volcanic eruption of 
Mt. Vesuvius nearly 2,000 years ago. I love the texture of the clay pot, 
and the variance of colors within its surface.

stone
Stones, pebbles and rocks can add 
wonderful texture to your drawings. 
This pot from Pompeii is beautiful, 
but alone in a drawing it would be 
somewhat lackluster. The real beauty 
of the drawing is created by all the 
surrounding stonework. The contrasts 
of color, texture and size relationships 
of the diff erent stones and pebbles 
bring the pot into a realistic context. 
Study and practice the close-up 
exercises of the textured areas on the 
next page.
THINGS TO 
REMEMBER
• Commit the fi ve basic fabric 
folds to memory.
• Consider using extreme light-
ing when taking reference 
photos to give your artwork 
extra spark.
• Always follow the direction of 
the grain when drawing wood.
• Make sure you have an 
accurate vantage point and 
angles when placing bricks in 
a drawing. 
• Think of stones and pebbles 
abstractly when drawing 
them. They should interlock 
like puzzle pieces.
70

demonstration
pebbles and stones
When drawing pebbles and stones, think of them abstractly. Small pebbles 
are a series of tiny circular marks, and wall stonework is a puzzle of inter-
locking shapes. Follow along with these exercises and see for yourself how 
simple it can be!
1 
CREATE THE LINE 
DRAWING
With Cool Grey 50%, hold 
the pencil slightly on the 
side and create tiny, circular 
marks. Render them ellipti-
cally, not in complete circles. 
Allow the tones to vary from 
dark to light.
There is no need to draw 
all the pebbles in the line 
drawing. Since pebbles 
are small and overlap one 
another, you must build 
them in layers.
2 
OVER LAP MORE 
PEBBLES
Alternating all the colors 
from the list, create the same 
small, oval marks with the 
side of the pencil. Overlap 
the marks and the colors for 
variety, creating the illusion 
that they are placed on top 
of one another. Add realism 
by varying each pebble’s size.
3 
FINISH THE DRAWING
Use a variety of gray tones and 
Black, with a touch of Peach and Sand, 
to layer color on each pebble. 
The colors of the pebbles should 
vary depending on the shadows. Notice 
how they are darker when closest to 
the pot, and more colorful when they 
are closest to the viewer. 
1 
SKETCH THE BASIC PATTERNS 
AND BURNISH THE UNDERTONE
With a mechanical pencil, lightly sketch 
in the patterns of the stones that form 
the stone wall. They should interlock 
like pieces of a mosaic.
Once the shape of each stone is 
drawn, burnish them with French Grey 
30% to create the undertone.
2 
LAYER THE TEXTURE 
AND COLOR
Layer Beige and Clay Rose on top of the 
burnished gray undertone to create the 
texture and color of each stone. Vary 
the colors, creating no two stones alike. 
You may choose to make some darker 
by using various Cool Grey tones.
 For the mortar around the stones, 
apply Cool Grey 50% using a light 
touch. Outline the edges of each of the 
stones with Cool Grey 70%.
3 
FINISH THE DRAWING
Continue building the colors in the 
diff erent stones. Some should appear 
beige, others darker and gray. Continue 
adding color until you are happy with 
the texture and tone of each stone.

hen you draw 
something trans-
parent, you ren-
der everything that refl ects 
off  it, rather than the actual 
object. Instead of visualizing 
these objects as “clear,” think 
of them as a shiny surface 
that refl ects shapes and tone 
to create diff erent patterns.
Experiment with drawing 
glass objects by placing them 
with various light sources and 
viewing them from multiple 
positions. Once you get used 
to viewing glass as patterns of 
shapes and tones, you’ll fi nd 
there is no end to the possibili-
ties of the beautiful colors that 
glass creates. 
Experiment With the Lighting and 
Posing of Glass Objects
This blue decanter from my kitchen is 
a wonderful example of refl ected color 
and light. My close friend Tice took about 
twenty pictures of this decanter with dif-
ferent angles, lighting and backgrounds. 
We moved it in and out of light and were 
amazed at how diff erent each photo 
appeared.

glass of milk
Try this exercise of drawing a glass of milk. The most important aspect of 
this drawing is achieving accurate ellipses shapes in the rim and the bottom 
of the glass. Start with the basic cylindrical shape, and follow along.
1 
CREATE THE LINE DRAWING
With a mechanical pencil, lightly 
draw the shape of the glass: a cylinder 
and two ellipses. Add Greyed Lavender 
to the milk line and the shadow edges 
in the glass. Repeat this color in the bot-
tom of the glass and in the refl ection on 
the table.
2 
DEEPEN THE TONES
With Cool Grey 70%, deepen the 
color around the rim. With a sharp 
point, render a double line to depict the 
thickness of the glass. Create the pat-
tern in the bottom of the glass.
3 
FINISH THE DRAWING
Add some Greyed Lavender to the 
rim of the glass within the double line. 
With Cool Grey 50%, add the shadow 
to the inside bottom of the glass and 
to the refl ection on the table. Finish the 
drawing by deepening the patterns in 
the bottom of the glass with Black.

1 
CREATE THE LINE DRAWING
With a mechanical pencil, either 
freehand sketch the wine glass shapes 
onto your drawing paper, or use an 
acetate grid overlay for more accuracy. 
Use a ruler to sketch the horizon, then 
draw light vertical lines down the 
middle of each glass. This will help you 
keep the shape equal on either side of 
the line.
3 
FINISH THE DRAWING
Deepen all the colors and add 
Cloud Blue to the tabletop using 
horizontal pencil strokes. To make the 
background stand out more against the 
glasses, add a touch of Clay Rose over 
the Lilac already applied.
Burnish the tabletop with Cloud Blue 
to make it look glossy and refl ective. 
Leave the background layered to give 
the drawing some textural contrast.
2 
BEGIN LAYERING THE COLORS
With a sharp point, layer the blue 
areas with Periwinkle. Use Lilac to create 
the lavender shapes in the glasses, the 
refl ections below the glasses and the 
area above the horizon line. With Cool 
Grey 50%, draw the dark patterns in the 
glasses. Leave the bright highlight areas 
empty, with the white of the paper 
exposed. Note the areas of refl ected 
light that the round shapes create 
along the edges of the glass and stems.
Drawing glassware is all about creating illusions. It is very important to 
draw from observation, not from memory. Our memories will trick us 
because we know glass to be “clear.” These wine glasses refl ect surround-
ing colors, making them appear quite colorful. The shapes are very sym-
metrical, so it is helpful to visualize the center point of the stems to ensure 
accuracy in shape. Also refer to the ellipses instruction in chapter three 
when drawing the rims and bases.

practice with unique glass patterns
As an artist, I am always attracted to unusual colors and 
shapes. While visiting a friend in Mexico, I was struck by 
this unique bottle sitting in her kitchen. I loved the way 
its asymmetrical shape refl ected colors; I simply had to 
take a picture of it knowing I would someday turn it into 
art in my studio. 
Create Fine Details With a Craft Knife
The tiny lettering on the bottle is best 
etched out with a small craft knife. The sharp 
blade removes thin hairlines of the pencil 
wax to achieve a delicate result.
Use the craft knife anytime you need 
a clean edge or tiny line of light in a drawing.
Practice Drawing Asymmetrical Objects
The asymmetrical shape of a tequila bottle inspired this drawing. Look for unique glass items 
like this to draw, and study them as abstract objects. Squint your eyes to detect all the light 
and dark patterns that make up transparent objects.

LEE’S 
LESSONS
It is essential to have 
a good layer of pencil 
wax on the paper 
before scratching away 
with a craft knife. You 
don’t want to acciden-
tally gouge your paper!
To create interesting reference photos of the bottle, I 
took it outside and placed it on the steps in her backyard. 
Notice the blue of the sky refl ecting in the glass, and the 
colors of terra cotta tiles shining through. I used a heavily 
burnished approach in this drawing to make the colors 
shiny and vivid.

Sometimes glass can be very complicated—not only in color, but in shape. 
This little Fenton glass basket is decorative and delicate looking with its 
ruffl  ed edges and braid-like handle. Such details must be studied carefully. 
Use the grid method to draw these shapes accurately, studying how the 
shapes of the glassware are captured within each box.

OUTLINE THE EDGES AND BEGIN THE PATTERNS
Start with just a few key lines of color. It is important to 
create the edges and patterns of the glass right away so they 
don’t get lost later. Draw in the lines as shown with Crimson 
Red. This creates the edges and side of the glass and begins 
the patterns of color. Add some to the handle, too. Notice 
that the lines are broken and fragmented because of the 
refl ections of light on the basket.
With Cool Grey 50%, add more lines to continue building 
the edges and details of the basket and handle.

CREATE THE LINE DRAWING
With a mechanical pencil, very lightly draw a grid on your 
drawing paper with the same number of boxes as the photo. 
Study the shapes inside and recreate them in each square. 
When you are happy with your drawing, erase the grid lines 
with your kneaded eraser.

BEGIN PLACING THE BASE COLORS
Use Crimson Red to add more lines to the top edge of 
the handle, and more streaks into the body of the basket. 
With Pink Rose, lightly fi ll in the handle, overlapping the col-
ors already there. Add this color to the inside of the basket 
as well.

DEEPEN THE TONES
Fill in the front of the basket with Hot Pink. Overlap the 
colors already in place, but leave a bit of white showing 
along the upper edge. This gives the basket its color, and also 
begins the shine of the glass. Add some Hot Pink to the inside 
of the basket to deepen the look of the shadow. Make note of 
the shadow’s diagonal edge.

BURNISH THE WHITE AREAS 
AND FINISH THE DRAWING
Finish the glass basket by deepening 
the gray tones with Cool Grey 70%, 
adding contrast to the drawing. With 
White, burnish the basket’s white areas 
to create the look of more shine.

Glass is very refl ective. Not only does it pick up refl ections of color and 
shapes from its surroundings, its appearance is aff ected by what is inside it. 
This glass of ice cubes is an amazing collection of patterns and geometric 
shapes. Use this graphed photo to obtain an accurate line drawing. Don’t 
worry too much about drawing perfect shapes—the illusion of cold ice 
cubes will be created once you add the tones.

CREATE A LINE DRAWING
Use the grid to create an accurate 
line drawing with a mechanical pencil. 
Every little shape need not be perfect, 
just try to capture the nonsense pat-
terns of the cubes. Make sure the arcs 
of the ellipses are rounded at the ends, 
not pointy.
2 
OUTLINE THE EDGES AND 
PATTERNS
Start your drawing with Black and a 
very sharp point. Render the ellipses 
that create the rim of the glass and the 
bottom. Then, study the shapes of the 
ice cubes, and add thick and thin lines 
to build the patterns.

CONTINUE TO DEEPEN THE 
TONES
With Black and a sharp point, add some 
tone to the background surrounding 
the glass. Layer this color around the 
entire glass. Add some tone to the 
inside of the glass to create the swirls in 
the ice.
4 
CREATE THE BACKGROUND 
AND FINISH THE DRAWING
With a ruler and the Black pencil, create 
clean, straight sides of the glass and 
draw a horizontal line to create the illu-
sion of a tabletop. To give the drawing 
more of a fi nished look, create a rectan-
gular box around the glass for a border. 
With Copenhagen Blue, overlap 
the black in the background, and fi ll 
it in toward the edges of the border. 
Using a sharp point on your pencil, fi ll 
it in slowly to make the tones even and 
smooth. Lightly add some Copenhagen 
Blue to the ice and insides of the glass. 
Be sure to leave the bright white edges 
of the glass empty for extra shine. With 
Black, fi ll in the tabletop. Allow the 
refl ection shapes below the glass to 
remain white.

opaque and semitransparent objects
Not all glass is transparent. Some is 
very opaque; some is semitranspar-
ent. Every object must be carefully 
studied and analyzed before you 
begin to draw it. Look for variances in 
color, and for any colors that may be 
refl ected from outside sources. Draw-
ing a nontransparent glass object can 
be fun and challenging. Remember, 
just because it varies in color doesn’t 
mean it is refl ecting light. 
Semitransparent Glass
These measuring jars were part of a collec-
tion dug up in the ruins of Pompeii. Each 
one is exactly one half the size of the one 
next to it.
The glass used in these jars is semitrans-
parent—you can just barely see through it. 
When you look at these jars, the color is very 
inconsistent. It goes in and out of dark and 
light. Some areas look very bright, and the 
color looks pure. Other areas appear dense 
in color, and somewhat cloudy and dull.
Colors Used
Light Aqua, Aquamarine, True Blue, Pale 
Sage, Light Green, Denim Blue, Cool Grey 
70%, Cloud Blue, Black, White
Burnish for Smooth Glass Texture
Burnishing blends colors together, giving 
them a very smooth texture, adding a shine 
to highlighted areas. Notice how the high-
lights show off  the curves of the sides of the 
jars, yielding a three-dimensional look.
Close-up of Background Shadows
Use a small amount of shadow color in the 
background to make a drawing appear fi n-
ished. Adding a border around your drawing 
will concentrate the colors in the corners 
and lead the eye to the middle, where the 
main subject is.
80

Practice Drawing Opaque Objects
Much like glassware, crockery’s surface is refl ective but opaque. You cannot see through it. Because crockery has a 
somewhat porous texture and the amount of glaze varies from piece to piece, it isn’t always as shiny as regular glass.
I created the crocks in this drawing using the layering technique on Gotham Grey Artagain Paper. Choose a 
shade of paper that closely matches the tone of the pottery’s porous surface to help emphasize its texture.
Colors Used
Peach, Burnt Ochre, Dark Brown, Dark Umber, French Grey 20%, French Grey 70%, Indigo Blue, True Blue, Black, White
Highlights Help Create Roundness
I applied White to the crocks to create 
the highlight areas and give them a shiny 
appearance. These highlights really help 
strengthen the roundness of the form. 
LEE’S 
LESSONS
Try cropping your 
photos for unique 
compositions. This 
drawing is an example 
of a segment draw-
ing (see page 33). The 
original photo wasof 
an entire kitchen scene. 
In the background, 
there where many 
shelves full of house-
hold items—this is only 
a small portion of the 
original photo. I delib-
erately cropped the 
image so it included 
the interesting shad-
ows in the background. 
I also cropped the 
crockon the left for 
better composition. 
Cropping is an eff ective 
way of balancing the 
shapes. If I had left the 
entire image showing, 
everything would have 
looked centered and a 
bit artifi cial.

This shiny glass pitcher is similar to the measuring jars 
on page 80. It also came from the ruins of Pompeii. If 
you look closely, you can see a variety of colors in the 
lights and darks of the pitcher’s curves, though the 
overall color is a dark blue. There is even some magenta 
bouncing off  objects in the background. I chose a solid 
black background to intensify the colors of this pitcher. 
It really helps the round edges stand out.
2 
LAYER THE INITIAL COLOR PATTERNS
Using the layered approach, apply the darkest shapes fi rst 
with Imperial Violet. These curved shapes create the illusion of 
roundness (see the fi ve elements of shading on page 26).
With True Blue, add the blue tones, leaving the white of 
the paper exposed for the highlight areas.

CREATE THE GRID AND LINE DRAWING
With a mechanical pencil, very lightly draw a grid on your 
drawing paper and recreate the jug. When you are happy with 
your drawing, erase the grid lines with your kneaded eraser.

CONTINUE BURNISHING AND FILL IN THE
BACKGROUND
To create a shiny, fi nished look, continue burnishing the 
colors so they build to completely cover the paper. You do 
not want to see any of the paper’s texture coming through. 
Use White to burnish the highlight areas, then add a bit of the 
Imperial Violet to the highlights. Continue burnishing with 
White to blend them together.
Fill in the background with Black using fi rm pressure 
and many layers. When you are completely fi nished, spray 
the piece with a fi xative to keep the drawing from appear-
ing hazy. This is necessary because of the heavy build-up of 
Black in the background. Without the fi xative, the wax from 
this layer of pencil will rise to the top of the paper, causing a 
cloudy, dull look.
3 
OUTLINE THE HIGHLIGHTED EDGES AND 
BURNISH THE DARK TONES
Add Black around the jug to make the bright, highlighted 
edges stand out. The rest will be fi lled in later. These edges are 
very important to this drawing, so take care not to lose them 
as you layer the drawing. 
Build up the colors from step 2 using the burnishing tech-
nique so they cover the paper more completely. Deepen the 
darker areas of the jug with Violet Blue using a heavier appli-
cation when applying the color. Also go over the areas of True 
Blue to deepen them using heavy pressure on the pencil.
Apply a small amount of Process Red to the edges and 
rims to create a subtle hint of reddish refl ection in the glass.
83

nontransparent bowl
We’ve already practiced how to draw transparent glass objects. Now, let’s 
try to draw some crockery. While it is not transparent, the surface of this 
sugar bowl is smooth, shiny and porous, and the type of paper you choose 
can help create this look. For this drawing, I chose a piece of colored 
paper that was very close to the color of the crockery. Using the layering 
technique allows the paper color to show through, enhancing the overall 
colors of the bowl.
2 
DEFINE THE EDGES AND BEGIN THE BACKGROUND
With Black and a very sharp point, create the edges 
of the bowl and apply a light layering of tone to the back-
ground. Work on the accuracy of the shapes of the ellipses 
and lightly fi ll them in to create the patterns. With Black 
Raspberry, create the edges and rim of the bowl to continue 
building the ellipses.
1
CREATE THE GRID AND LINE 
DRAWING
The ellipses required for this drawing 
are easier to obtain when using the grid 
method. Because there are so many, it 
might help to fi ll in the dark lines around 
the top and the neck of the bowls as you 
draw. This will help you avoid confusion 
among the many individual lines.
The ellipses are the most critical 
aspect of this drawing. Before adding any 
colored pencil, work on the ellipses with a 
mechanical pencil until they appear cor-
rect. It is much better to make corrections 
with regular graphite than colored pencil 
because graphite erases much easier.

THINGS TO REMEMBER
• Think of transparent objects as shiny surfaces 
instead of  “clear.”  You draw everything that the 
object refl ects, not the object itself.
• Draw glassware from observation, not memory.
• Have a good layer of pencil wax on the paper 
before using a craft knife.
• Just because an object’s color varies does not mean 
it’s refl ecting light.
84

3 
DEEPEN THE TONES AND CREATE THE SHADOWS
Once you have achieved accurate ellipses, deepen the 
colors of the stripes around the neck and the top of the bowl 
with Indigo Blue. Also add the small patterns to the handles 
with Indigo Blue.
Deepen the overall color of the bowl using the layering 
technique. This allows the color of the paper to come through, 
further enhancing the look of pottery. With Henna, deepen 
the color in the lower area of the bowl. Use Clay Rose to help 
the Henna color transition toward the upper area of the bowl.
Create the shadow on the right side of the bowl by layer-
ing Black. Notice the cast shadows to the right of the knob on 
the lid and to the left of the handle on the right. Deepen the 
tone in the background with Black.
Add Burnt Ochre to the tabletop on the left, and Black 
Raspberry to the tabletop on the right. Lightly apply White to 
begin the highlights.
4 
BURNISH THE BACKGROUND 
AND DEEPEN THE HIGHLIGHTS
Deepen all the tones with multiple 
layers of color, and burnish the back-
ground until smooth, using a ruler to 
create a defi nitive border.
Create the table’s wood grain look, 
keeping in mind the perspective of the 
pencil lines. Build the wood color with 
Burnt Ochre, and the wood grain with 
Dark Brown. Render the cast shadow on 
the right with Black Raspberry.
Slowly build the color of the sugar 
bowl with the layered approach. It is 
important to not allow the colors of the 
bowl to burnish—creating a smooth 
and refl ective surface would take 
away from the realistic appearance of 
crockery.
Shadow the top of the lid and in 
between the stripes on the neck with 
Dark Brown. Layer the rest of the bowl 
with more Henna and Black Raspberry, 
allowing the paper color to show 
through.
To fi nish the drawing, deepen the 
White highlights, then add the small 
freckles of the crockery with Dark Brown.

Metallic Objects
D
rawing a metallic 
surface is very much 
like drawing glass. 
They both have highly refl ective 
surfaces, which create extreme 
patterns of light and dark. When 
drawing an object in color, you 
must remember to look for col-
ors refl ecting from the object’s 
surroundings.
At right is a drawing of an 
old-fashioned metal vase. While 
the real color of the vase is a light 
pink, the bright colors of the 
surroundings and background 
change the vase’s appearance 
dramatically.
Practice drawing the diff erent 
types of metal surfaces in this 
chapter. Each one is very diff erent 
from the other, depending on its 
surface, color and surroundings. 
Accent Your Subject With Strong Background Tones
The colors of the background fading from dark to light help accent 
the colors of the African violets and the vase. You can use comple-
mentary colors to make your drawing subjects pop. To make the 
green colors of the leaves stand out, I used an abundance of red 
throughout the drawing. The violets stand out because of the yellow 
in the background.

Practice Drawing Shiny, Polished Metals
This shiny and polished silver creates powerful extremes of tone and refl ected shapes. The 
lighting is coming from the top, creating intense contrasts. The top looks extremely light, 
while the bottom is extremely dark.
The dark, layered background of this drawing contrasts sharply against the shiny surface 
of the teapot. This drawing was rendered entirely in gray tones. Because the background is 
all shades of gray, there are no refl ecting colors in this piece like the drawing of the goblet on 
page 92. A dark background is very important with polished silver, because it helps the light 
edges of the object stand out, and it gives stark contrast to the white areas. 
I used the layering technique in the background to contrast against the heavily bur-
nished approach used in the surface of the teapot.
polished silver & stainless steel
Polished silver and stainless steel are extremely shiny, with 
many extreme refl ections and tones. They are best created 
using the burnishing technique with a heavy application 
of tones and colors. Remember, smooth surfaces are bur-
nished and porous surfaces are layered. 
87

When drawing silver or stainless steel in colored pencil, it is important not to 
use just black and white. Your drawing will appear more realistic if you add 
some color. In this piece, I used some Metallic Gold to make the saucepan 
less stark. Follow along and draw the saucepan.

Leave the bright highlight areas the 
white of the paper.

BURNISH THE COLORS
Burnish the Black and the Metal-
lic Gold to make the patterns more 
intense. With White, burnish the gold 
areas to make it look shiny, and create 
the highlight areas. 
Add some Black to the cast shadow, 
leaving it layered so it has a grainy 
appearance.

Burnish to Create Polished Brass
Burnishing is usually used to create the look 
of polished brass. There are many colors 
seen in the spittoon that come from the 
surrounding textures in the background, 
such as the wood grain of the table and the 
rattan texture of the chair back.
polished brass
In general, it takes a shiny, burnished 
approach to create the look of 
polished brass. Because the surface 
of polished brass is so refl ective, it is 
important to incorporate all of the 
refl ections of light and color from sur-
rounding objects.
The diff erence between the two 
drawings on this page is that the 
spittoon is rounded with softer edges, 
and the teapot is angular with harder 
edges.  The refl ective lighting on the 
spittoon is more gradual because of 
the smooth curves of its surface, while 
the sharp angles of the teapot drasti-
cally change the refl ective lighting.
Refl ections of a Brass Teapot
I love the variety of colors and textures in this still life, and the way 
the colors refl ect off  the brass teapot. The red tones of the books 
bounce off  the right side of the pot, and the table’s wood color 
bounces off  its underside. 
This piece is also full of shadows. The light source is coming 
from the left side, so all the shadows bounce off  to the right of the 
objects. Study how the teapot’s shadow moves across the table and 
up the side of the books. Before you begin to draw, always study the 
eff ects of light on your subject matter and the shadows it creates.

metal ornament
This metal ornament is a great beginning project because it is a simple 
sphere. Once you have fi nished this project, try it again with diff erent colors. 
Try one in red, blue or your favorite color. 
1 
CREATE THE LINE DRAWING AND FILL IN 
THE UNDERTONE
Lightly trace a circle on your drawing paper using a mechani-
cal pencil. Use a template or trace around a glass or other 
round object for accuracy. Draw in the top of the ornament 
and the ribbon.
Fill in the undertone of the ornament with Canary Yel-
low. This is the basis of the drawing’s deep gold tone. Leave 
the bright highlight areas the white of the paper. Add the 
shadow edge to the lower portion of the ornament with 
Yellow Ochre.
2 
CREATE THE SHADOW EDGES
Continue adding color to create the shadow patterns. Start 
with Light Umber and subtly apply it to the outside edge of 
the ornament. It should not look like a solid outline. Also touch 
up the top neck of the ornament and the hanger. Add the dark 
spot in the center of the ornament with Light Umber. 
With Scarlet Lake, apply color along the inside edge of the 
ornament to create a shadow edge.
3 
ADD DETAILS AND BURNISH THE COLORS
Build up the color of the ornament using the same colors 
as before and burnish them together. Add White to the high-
light areas and burnish it to look smooth and shiny. Detail 
the neck and hanger. Notice how the edge of the hanger has 
a scalloped edge and is surrounded by refl ected light. Even 
though it is a small area, the tiniest details are still important.
With Scarlet Lake, add some color to the ribbon. Add Light 
Umber to the shadows to make them three-dimensional. 
Add a small amount of Scarlet Lake to the very top of the 
hanger to create a refl ection.

dull metal
Drawing dull metal is much diff erent 
than drawing shiny surfaces, such as 
brass and silver, because it is porous 
and less refl ective. The tones of dull 
objects are less extreme, and the pat-
terns of light and dark appear more 
gradual than shiny objects. To achieve 
a dull look, use the layering tech-
nique, making sure to allow some of 
the paper’s surface to show through.
Dull Metal Refl ects Many Colors
This goblet is another antique from the 
Pompeii museum of artifacts. It has many 
of the same elements as the stainless steel 
pan on pages 88–89, with many raised 
surfaces and patterns. But unlike the pan, 
the goblet’s surface is extremely dull. The 
ornamentation and raised patterns of this 
goblet create shadows that make for an 
interesting drawing. It is made of metal, but 
is not extremely polished and shiny—the 
surface almost looks pitted. 
How many colors do you see refl ect-
ing in this piece? Look for diff erent greens, 
oranges, grays and violets.
LEE’S 
LESSONS
Make sure to keep a 
sharp point on your 
pencil when layering 
to help you fade the 
colors gradually.

dull metal
The layering approach is used to create the look of dull metal in the goblet 
on the facing page. Because of its three-dimensional quality, the fi ve ele-
ments of shading apply to each raised area, such as the edges of the fi gures 
around the top of the goblet. Practice drawing the comma-shaped patterns 
from the middle of the goblet.
1 
CREATE THE LINE DRAWING 
AND LAYER THE UNDERTONES
Use Black to sketch in the basic shapes, 
or the recessed areas of the goblet’s 
decoration. 
To create the subtle colors and 
textures, use the layering approach and 
a small amount of Greyed Lavender for 
the undertone. Add a touch of Sienna 
Brown using a very sharp point. This will 
help the paper texture show through.
2 
DEEPEN THE TONES
Add a bit more Greyed Lavender 
along the rim, and some Sienna Brown 
to the edges of the motif. Add some 
blue tones with Non-Photo Blue in the 
upper area and Ultramarine Blue along 
the bottom edge.
3 
FINISH THE DRAWING
Deepen the shadow areas by 
layering Black over the colors previously 
applied. Make these areas deep in tone, 
but do not allow the black to burnish. 
It is important that the paper texture 
shows through.
THINGS TO REMEMBER
• Drawing a metallic surface is very much like drawing glass.
• A dark background is very important with shiny, polished brass because it 
helps the light edges of the object stand out.
• Don’t just use black and white when drawing stainless steel or silver. 
Colors make the drawing more realistic.
• When drawing polished brass, be sure to incorporate all the refl ections 
and colors from the objects surrounding it.
• Even the tiniest details are important, especially when drawing refl ective 
metal.
• Unlike polished metal, drawing dull metal requires the layering approach 
to achieve the less extreme tones and the porous look of full metal. To 
enhance this look, allow the paper’s texture to show through the colors.

Suede board is a wonder-
ful drawing surface for nature 
scenes and fl owers. It creates a 
pastel-like quality to the subject 
and makes sky tones and fl ower 
petals appear soft and smooth. 
Even though suede board is soft, 
it is still possible to use fi rm pres-

overlaps, which are important 
when drawing natural subjects.

Experiment With Complementary Colors in Flower Scenes
This red rose, drawn on light gray suede board, takes on a soft, dif-
fused look, and the background appears to be out of focus. This is 
a good example of a complementary color scheme—red against 
green. This color scheme is repeated often in drawings of fl owers 
and nature.
Flowers are a very popular subject for colored pencil artists not 
only because of their beautiful colors, but because they are made up 
of a multitude of shapes.

fl ower basics
Flowers are a fun and interesting 
drawing subject because there are so 
many colorful varieties. When observ-
ing fl owers to draw, keep in mind the 
many overlapping petals that create 
hard edges of refl ected light and cast 
shadows. 
Flowers also have many diff er-
ent textures. To achieve depth and 
realism, it is best to use the layering 
technique to draw dull, fuzzy surfaces,  
and to use the burnishing technique 
to draw shiny, refl ective petals. 
Create a Dramatic Look With a 
Black Background 
For a dramatic look, fi ll the entire 
background with black, like the 
exercise of the pink daisy on 
pages 96–97. The colors of this 
zinnia look very intense against 
the dark background. 
A Textured Red Flower
The red fl ower is drawn on mat 
board that has a touch of texture 
to it. Notice how the outside 
corners of the drawing are gently 
shaded and lead the viewer’s eye 
to the center. I chose a blue-gray 
background for the middle tone 
to help the bright white accents of 
the piece stand out. 
95

This fl ower has a lot of overlapping petals and an extreme light source. This 
combination creates many extremes of light and dark tones and shadows. 
The grid method for capturing shapes is really handy when drawing fl owers 
and helps to capture the tiny details.
1 
CREATE THE LINE DRAWING
Use the grid to create a line drawing 
with a mechanical pencil. When your draw-
ing is accurate, erase the gridlines with a 
kneaded eraser.

OUTLINE THE EDGES AND 
BEGIN THE SHADOWS
Fill in the center of the fl ower with 
Canary Yellow using circular pencil 
strokes. Once the Canary Yellow layer is 
complete, overlap it with Limepeel on 
the upper side of the fl ower’s center. 
Along the left side, overlap the Canary 
Yellow with Magenta. This will accentu-
ate the center of the fl ower.
With Magenta, begin outlining the 
petals. Look for areas that are extremely 
dark and areas that are lighter, and use 
thinner lines and less pressure in the 
light areas. Lightly fi ll in some of the 
shadow areas with Magenta to begin 
the look of overlapping petals.

Finish the drawing by building up the

Allow some of the white of the paper 
to show through to give the petals a 
streaked appearance.
You can leave the paper white if you 
like, or choose to fi ll in the background 
with a solid application of color. A black 
background really makes the fl ower 
stand out, but any color will work.

BUILD THE TONES
Continue building the tones of the 
fl ower. Add more creases to the petals 
with Magenta and fi ll the lower sides 
of the petals with Hot Pink. Use Process 
Red to layer the left sides of each petal’s 
shadows.
With Black, add some small circles to 
the fl ower’s center. Use a light touch—
you don’t want the circles too dark. Also 
use the Black to create the shadows 
along the edges of the fl ower’s center. 
Follow the patterns carefully, pay-
ing close attention to how the edges 
weave under some of the petals.

Practice drawing a fl ower against a completed background. I cropped 
the photo to focus on just one of the fl owers, and to eliminate some of the 
unnecessary subject matter. Create the drawing in the size you want the 
piece to be, and use transfer paper to place the line drawing to the suede 
board. Once the drawing is transferred to the board, you can clean up 
any smudges with a kneaded eraser. Do not use any other type of eraser, 
because it will damage the surface of the paper. 
1 
TRANSFER THE DRAWING ONTO SUEDE BOARD
Use the grid method to capture this fl ower on regular 
drawing paper. It is not possible to use the grid method on 
suede board, so the line drawing must fi rst be created on a 
regular piece of drawing paper and then transferred using 
transfer paper. (See Lee’s Lessons on the facing page for 
instructions.)
2 
BEGIN ADDING THE UNDERTONES AND THE 
BACKGROUND
Once you have successfully transferred the line drawing to 
the suede board, begin adding Canary Yellow to the fl ower 
petals and fl ower pods.
Begin adding the background color to create the edges 
of the fl ower. Use Parrot Green for the overall background 
tone, Spring Green for the leaf areas and Light Green for the 
pale leaves on the right side. At this point, all the undertones 
of the drawing should be placed on the suede board like a 
colored road map.

FINISH THE DRAWING
Add Crimson Red to the fl ower in the recessed areas in 
the center. Use the Crimson Red to create some of the crisp 
edges and the striations within the petals. With Tuscan Red, 
fi ll in the stamens and use Black for their edges. Use Tuscan 
Red to outline the edges of the petals in the center.
Continue deepening the colors of the background. Layer 
some Black over the Peacock Green in the upper right corner 
to create the illusion of depth. Develop the patterns and 
colors until your drawing comes to life.
3 
DEEPEN THE TONES
Continue adding color to the fl ower by overlapping the 
Canary Yellow with Orange. Use the Orange to outline the 
edges and ridges of the fl ower where it bends and curves.
Deepen the tones of the background with Peacock Green, 
which is mostly in the shadows. Use Dark Green and Black for 
the darkest green tones. Study the patterns of color closely in 
the fi nished example.
Add some Yellow Chartreuse to the brightly colored leaves 
and fl ower pods.
THINGS TO REMEMBER
• Complementary color schemes make fl owers pop 
on the page.
• Use the grid method when drawing fl owers to help 
capture tiny details.
• Only use kneaded erasers on suede board—others 
will damage the surface of the paper.
• Consider drawing fl owers on suede board for a 
softer, smoother appearance.
LEE’S LESSONS
Transfer paper can be found in any arts and 
crafts store. Sketch your line drawing on the 
back side of the transfer paper with a soft 
graphite pencil. Carefully place the paper, 
graphite side down, over the suede board. 
Outline the image with a regular pencil and 
the graphite underneath will transfer to the 
suede board.
Once the drawing is transferred, clean up 
any smudges with a kneaded eraser. Do not 
use any other type of eraser, because it will 
damage the surface of the paper.

water surfaces
Whenever you are drawing an object 
surrounded by water, you must include 
the refl ections in the water. Unlike 
shadows, which change depending on 
the light source, refl ections are always 
vertical and directly below the object. 
When drawing refl ections, remem-
ber that the movement of the water 
interrupts the image and somewhat 
distorts the shapes. 
Water Refl ections Are Always Vertical
This is a drawing of my grandson, Gavyn, at 
the beach. Study all of the colors refl ecting 
below him in the sand—such refl ections are 
always vertical and are never as bright as the 
original subject matter.

spheres and glass. Each droplet refl ects its surroundings just 
like a glass surface. Study diff erent photos of water droplets

water droplets
This is an exercise of the water droplets on the rose on page 101. Notice that 
it is the pink color of the petals that creates the tone of the droplets. Prac-
tice drawing droplets of diff erent sizes, shapes and colors. Adjust the light 
source to aff ect each drawing, and remember that there may be multiple 
highlights within each drop. 
2 
BUILD THE TONES
Apply the lightest color, Hot Pink, 
to the top edges of the droplets. With a 
medium color, Pink, add a shadow edge 
inside the droplets. Then with the dark-
est color, Mulberry, add a cast shadow 
below the droplets, making sure to 
leave a little white of the paper showing 
through for highlights. 
3 
BURNISH THE COLORS
Build each of the tones a bit more, 
then burnish the colors together with 
White to make them smooth. Take the 
White and lighten the refl ected light 
directly above the dark line of the cast 
shadow around the bottom edge of 
the droplet. Then, add the bright high-
lights on top.
1 
SKETCH THE LINE DRAWING
Lightly draw the shape of the 
droplets with a mechanical pencil. 
They should closely resemble a sphere, 
and could vary in shape from oval to 
teardrop. Add some Hot Pink around 
the droplets to represent the fl ower 
petal. With Pink and a sharp point, 
begin shading the lower edges of the 
droplets.

water droplets on a leaf
Now that you’re comfortable drawing droplets by themselves, practice 
them on a surface. Here, the dark greens of the leaf help the water stand 
out. Focus on the dark and light contrasts when capturing wet subjects in 
colored pencil.
1 
SKETCH THE LINE DRAWING
Lightly sketch in the shape of the 
leaf with a mechanical pencil. Draw in 
the water droplets—note that they are 
each a diff erent shape.
Lightly fi ll in the leaf with an even 
application of Grass Green. Make sure to 
leave the droplets the white of the paper. 
With Tuscan Red, apply the veins 
and edges of the leaf with a sharp point. 
Lightly layer this color to the outside 
edges of the leaf. With a sharp point 
and fi rm pressure, draw a distinct line 
of Tuscan Red underneath each water 
droplet to create their cast shadows. 
Also apply a shadowed edge to the 
leaf’s top and bottom droplets.
2 
DEEPEN THE TONES
Deepen the tones of the leaf using 
the same colors, also layering Dark 
Green to the left side of the leaf. With 
Grass Green, add shadow edges to the 
water droplets. Continue to leave the 
white of the paper exposed around the 
edges of the drops and their highlight 
areas. There is a light area down the left 
side of the center vein that needs to 
remain white as well.
3 
FINISH THE DRAWING
Finish the leaf and the droplets by 
burnishing each of the colors. The drop-
lets are brought to life by burnishing 
the highlights with White to make them 
shine. You can clearly see the sphere 
exercise practiced in each one.

This is a drawing of a photo I took in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. This par-
ticular shot captured the last few moments of daylight. The sun’s deep 
rays bounced magnifi cently off  the water, creating many light and dark 
patterns. Drawing water is similar to drawing clouds, because they both 
move horizontally. Follow along and learn how to capture the look of 
water and waves.
1 
CREATE THE LINE DRAWING 
AND PLACE THE UNDERTONES
With a mechanical pencil, lightly apply 
the horizon line, where the water and 
sky meet, about a third of the way 
down your paper. Draw a very light 
circle where the sun will be, and lightly 
sketch in the main waves.
Using the layered approach, apply 
Canary Yellow evenly across the top of 
the horizon, making sure there are no 
noticeable pencil lines. Do not go over 
the pencil drawing of the circle that 
represents the sun. The graphite will 
darken and you will not be able to erase 
it. Place Canary Yellow all around the 
circle, then remove the graphite with 
your kneaded eraser, creating the white 
spot. Add Canary Yellow all the way into 
the water directly under the sun. This is 
where the sunlight refl ection will be.
With Yellow Orange, fi ll in the small 
mountain on the left. With Orange and 
a light touch, fi ll in the water area on 
both sides of the refl ection. Add the 
main waves with Tuscan Red.

2
BUILD THE TONES OF THE SKY, SAND AND SUN
Continue building the color of the sky with the layered 
approach, taking care to disguise any pencil lines. Deepen 
the color with Canary Yellow, and make the color around the 
sun extra deep so that it looks bright white.
Deepen the sky with Yellow Orange, moving out from the 
sun. With Orange, continue out even farther. Create the sun 
rays by lifting them out with the kneaded eraser in a wagon-
wheel pattern. Don’t worry if you lift too much, you can add 
the color back in with Canary Yellow.
Use Celadon Green to depict the subtle hint of the blue 
sky showing in the upper corners. The yellow of the sun 
mixes with the blue of the sky to produce a green cast.
Deepen the colors of the yellow water refl ection with 
Canary Yellow and Yellow Orange. Create the shoreline with 
Orange. Add the deep red colors to the mountaintop, the 
waves, and the shoreline with Tuscan Red. Allow the Canary 
Yellow to show along the base of the mountain to create a 
hazy eff ect.
3 
DEEPEN THE WAVES AND FINISH THE DRAWING
Deepen the colors and patterns of the drawing by 
building all up the previous colors. Use Black to create the 
illusion of ripples and waves using pencil strokes that mimic 
the movement of water. In the distance, closer to the horizon 
line, the lines are straighter across and close together. As the 
waves get closer to the foreground, the patterns become 
more arched and pronounced. Go back and forth with the 
pencil lines to help create the patterns of water. Reapply 
the lighter colors of Canary Yellow and Orange until you are 
happy with the way it looks.
In the outer edges, of the drawing add some Celadon Green 
to the water to represent the refl ection of the blue sky tint.
Deepen the color of the sand with more Orange and 
Tuscan Red. With White, fi ll in the sun and soften its outer 
edges. Add a touch of White into the brightest highlight 
areas of the water.

This drawing of a duck will give you experience drawing mirror images 
refl ecting in water. The ripples here help the drawing appear more natural 
than the duck drawing from page 100.
2 
OUTLINE THE DARK EDGES AND CREATE THE SHADOWS
Begin applying Black to the drawing once the grid has been removed. Because the duck is white, 
it is important to create the edges and shadows of the duck fi rst so it doesn’t get lost. Notice how the 
shadow of the neck is repeated in the water. The movement of the water distorts the shapes, giving 
them a wavy appearance.

BUILD THE WATER AND BEGIN DRAWING THE DUCK
Identify the ripples of the water and draw them in with Black. Begin fi lling in the water with Grass 
Green. Leave the area directly behind, below and in front of the duck the white of the paper. Add Non-
Photo Blue into the duck’s wake.
Use Greyed Lavender to create the form of the duck. Make sure not to pull the Greyed Lavender all the 
way out to the edges where the refl ected light shines.
Base in the bill of the duck with Canary Yellow. Apply Orange over it, allowing the refl ected light to 
remain along the bottom. Add some Orange to the water area under the duck to represent the bill’s 
refl ection, the leg and the foot.
4 
BUILD AND BURNISH THE COLORS
Finish the drawing by building up the colors until they burnish together. Create the patterns of the 
water’s ripples by drawing elliptical shapes that mimic the movement of the water. In the water, use four 
diff erent shades of green—Limepeel, Apple Green, Grass Green and Dark Green—using the lightest tone 
at the top of the drawing. 
Add White to the refl ections and streaks of Non-Photo Blue. Add White to the duck’s highlighted areas 
and soften the Greyed Lavender and shadows. Using Black, continue to deepen the ripples of the water. 
Use elliptical shapes to create the illusion of water movement.

Create a Subtle Sunset With Complementary Colors 
This example shows what can be done with very few colors and the 
layering approach. Layering gives the drawing a gentle appearance, 
while the use of opposite colors adds punch. Study your reference 
photos carefully before you begin to draw, so you know which 
technique is required to obtain the look you want.
skies and clouds
Skies and clouds are one of the most beautiful things to 
draw. You can use a variety of approaches when creating 
skies and clouds because each one is diff erent. Thick, white 
clouds can be burnished to make them appear light and 
LEE’S LESSONS
Clouds and atmosphere always move side to 
side, not up and down. All pencil lines associ-
ated with a sky should be placed horizontally. 
Always study your subject or reference photo 
and note the direction of the sunlight. In the 
example at right, the sunshine is centrally 
located and peeks through the clouds a little 
off  center and to the right. It streaks through 
the sky in a horizontal fashion. 
Clouds Add Depth to Any Drawing
Clouds are like snowfl akes—no two are alike. Burnishing is what 
makes clouds look fl uff y and dimensional. The subtle tonal changes 
give them depth. I love the colors and shapes they create. This little 
drawing has a lot of depth because of the colors and the layers of 
the clouds. Although it is all in blue tones, it is very rich in hue. You 
can create the same drawing and turn it into an entirely diff erent 
look by simply adding or changing colors. You could also take this 
and use it as a background, adding some trees in the foreground. Or 
you could add a horizon line and create a lake or ocean below it.
Colos Used

fl uff y, and wispy clouds can be layered to help them fade 
into the sky, especially if they are darker in color than the 
sky. Here are some examples that show you the diff erent 
techniques for skies and clouds.

Use the White of the Paper to Create Rays of Light
This sky is a beautiful example of how intense the sky can be when 
drawn in colored pencil. Use the white of the paper to create con-
trast with bright, sunlit areas. See how the rays of light overlap the 
dark clouds below? Burnish the colors surrounding the white paper 
to create this intense separation.

When you draw an entire scene, you must work from back to front. In this 
landscape, objects in the foreground overlap the things in the distance. In 
this piece, we will start with the sky and all the great colors in it.
1 
LOCATE THE HORIZON AND 
CREATE THE LINE DRAWING
Locate the horizon line, or where the 
sky and the water meet. In this piece, 
the horizon line is low, about one fi fth 
of the way up from the bottom of the 
composition. Lightly draw a line across 
the paper, parallel to the lower edge, 
and lightly sketch in the palm trees. 
Begin by placing in the sunshine 
streaks with Lemon Yellow, noting the 
direction of the sunlight and rays. Add 
some Lemon Yellow to the water area 
below the horizon line.
Apply Peach to the water to the left 
side of the Lemon Yellow. Add it across 
the sky, and around the Lemon Yellow. 
Place Lavender and Parma Violet in hori-
zontal patches throughout the orange 
sky tones. 
Use China Blue and to create the 
deep blue tones along the horizon line 
that separate the ocean and the sky. 
Create the lighter colors in the water 
with Sky Blue Light.
2 
DEEPEN THE TONES
Repeat the previous steps using 
a fi rm pressure so the colors burnish 
together. Do you see how much 
smoother and creamier the colors 
look in this version as opposed to the 
layered tones of step 1?

ADD THE FOREGROUND DETAILS
Use your mechanical pencil to lightly sketch in the foreground shapes to use as a guide. Fill in the 
largest shapes fi rst, such as the trunk of the tree and the shoreline. With Black and a very sharp point on 
your pencil, apply the palm leaves, the small bush to the right of the tree, and the blades of grass. If you 
haven’t drawn a palm tree before, I would suggest practicing fi rst on a separate sheet of paper. 
Notice how the individual palms pull out from the center, resembling a feather and a quill. The 
tapered ends must be applied with quick strokes. The same is true for the grass. Be sure to use quick 
strokes, lifting your pencil at the end so the width of the line becomes very thin.
Apply the Black as dark as possible with fi rm pressure. Because this is a silhouette, no small details of 
the foreground should be visible. 
111

snowy landscape on suede board
In this landscape, the smooth fi nish of suede board adds to the softness and 
realism of the colors. The fuzziness of the paper diff uses the colors, creating 
a pastel-like fi nish.
Remember that you cannot draw a full grid on suede board. To get 
started, lightly sketch in a few guidelines to indicate the horizon line and 
basic background elements.
1 
LIGHTLY SKETCH THE
GUIDELINES
Lightly draw the horizon line on suede 
board about a third of the way down 
using a blue colored pencil. Lightly sketch 
an outline of the riverbank, the trees and 
some of the ice patterns in the water.

LAYER THE CLOUDS AND BASE IN THE RIVER
Create the clouds in the background using True Blue 
and horizontal strokes. With Goldenrod, apply some color to 
the trees in the background. Loosely apply the pencil to the 
suede board so no texture or real shape is created—only an 
undertone.
Fill in the river with Ultramarine Blue. Use a light pres-
sure so the pencil lines do not show and the color is applied 
more evenly.

DEEPEN THE TONES IN THE BACKGROUND AND 
FOREGROUND
Deepen the blue tones, but allow the ice fl ows to stay light 
in color. Apply a layer of Black over the colors in the water 
on the left side of the river. Apply a layer of Black over the 
trees as well.
Use White to create the ice fl ows. Notice how they appear 
smaller and closer together in the background, and larger 
and more distinct in the foreground. Use True Blue to create 
the streaky shadows of the ice fl ows in the foreground.
3 
CREATE THE TREES AND MOUNTAINS
With Black, create the illusion of texture in the pine trees, 
using vertical pencil lines to represent the tree trunks. Use 
the fl at side of pencil to create the texture of the trees using 
horizontal motions. 
 With True Blue and a light touch, add the small mountain 
in the far background along the horizon line. With the same 
color, accent the color in the water on the right. Defi ne the 
bottoms of the ice fl ows with Black.
THINGS TO REMEMBER
• Burnishing is what makes clouds appear fl uff y and 
three-dimensional.
• Water droplets always refl ect the color of the sur-
face they lie on.
• Focus on the light and dark contrasts when captur-
ing wet subjects in colored pencil.
• Refl ections are always vertical and directly below 
an object.
• The movement of water interrupts an image and 
somewhat distorts its shape in refl ection.
• Refl ections are never as bright as the original subject. 
• Drawing elliptical shapes creates the illusion of 
water movement.
• When drawing an entire scene, work from back to 
front to account for objects overlapping.
• Clouds and atmosphere always move side to side, 
so all pencil lines associated with them should be 
horizontal.
• The fuzziness of suede board diff uses the colors in a 
drawing, creating a soft, pastel-like fi nish.

and burnishing to capture your favorite animals in

Combine Many Drawing Techniques to Create Furry Animals
What I like about this drawing of my dog Penny is the contrast of 
colors, textures and many light and dark patterns. Because Penny 
is outdoors, the sunlight creates deep shadows around her body. 
The reddish hue of Penny’s fur is complemented by the green 
of the grass. Since green and red are opposites on the color wheel, 
pairing them creates a stark contrast. To create the texture of the 
grass, I used many shades of green and quick, vertical strokes.

drawing fur
The key to drawing realistic fur is to render it in multiple 
layers. Animal fur, no matter what type, is quite dense. To 
make it look believable, you must build it up, layer after 
layer, using many pencil strokes. Whether the fur is short or 
long, always pull your strokes the direction the fur is going.
Many Colors Refl ect Off  Black and White Colors

BUILD THE FUR AND ADD DETAILS 
Add Sienna Brown and Terra Cotta to build the fur color. At this stage in your 
drawing, the pencil lines must follow the direction that the fur fl ows to create 
texture. Add more Pink Rose around the eye.
As you draw, notice where the fur refl ects light and leave those areas exposed, 
showing the Goldenrod color. Add Cloud Blue where light is refl ected on the 
puppy’s back and legs to create form and dimension. This color brings the drawing 
together, giving it a fi nished element of realism.

With White, burnish the catchlight 
of the eye to make it appear refl ective.
Lightly layer the Limepeel with Dark 
Brown to make the eyes appear round 
and lifelike.
Add the inner color of the ears with 
Seashell Pink. Darken the outer edges of 
the ears with a light application of Black. 
Add a small amount of Seashell Pink to 
the tip and rim of the nose, and under

create the body’s outline and shade the 
main body shapes. Don’t worry about

middle area. Make sure to leave a rim of 
refl ected light around the nostrils.
Using a craft knife, lightly scratch out 
the whiskers and hairs inside the ears.  Be 
careful not to gauge the paper! Fill them 
in with White, using long, quick strokes 
to create a tapered look. If you make 
the lines too thick, narrow either of their 
sides with Cool Grey 30%. Use this color 
to add a few hairs in the ears and create 
the pores on the cat’s muzzle.
Finish the background with a light 
layer of Cool Grey 30% along the edges. 
With a sharp point, gradually overlap the 
Cool Grey 30% with Cloud Blue to defi ne 
the edges of the cat.

Drawing an animal on suede board can give fur a smooth, realistic appear-
ance. This white tiger is perfect for this technique, and the fi nished result is 
soft and beautiful. The way colors bounce off  the white fur is very similar to 
the drawing of Nubby on pages 118–119.

TRANSFER THE LINE DRAWING TO THE 
SUEDE BOARD
Use this drawing as a guide to transfer your line drawing to 
the suede board (see page 99 for more detailed instruction 
on transferring). Clean up any smudges with a kneaded 
eraser. Do not use any other type of eraser because it will 
permanently smudge the graphite on the suede board.

BUILD THE FACIAL TONES AND BACKGROUND
With Dark Brown, carefully and lightly apply the tones to 
the top of the head, around the eyes and down the sides of 
the nose. Continue adding the Dark Brown to the top of the 
nose and into the striped areas of the body.
Fill in the pupil and outline the outer edge around the 
eyes with Black. Use Light Cerulean Blue to fi ll in the eye color. 
Layer it more heavily around the pupil, and lighter as you 
work toward the outer edges. 
Use Black Raspberry to gently fi ll in the nose. Use a fi rmer 
pressure to deepen the edges and middle of the nose. Use 
this color to create the lips, adding a little bit below the mouth 
onto the chin. Use Black to outline the nose and create the 
nostril area. Also use Black to edge the lips and mouth area.
Add realism and warmth to the Dark Brown of the tiger’s 
features by using Black Raspberry to render the corners of the 
eyes and side of the nose. Add Black Raspberry to the inside 
of the ears as well. 
Using Cloud Blue, create the three-dimensional form and 
the illusion of soft shadows along the tiger’s back, chest and 
face. Place the Cloud Blue around the tiger to help create the 
soft edges. Adding this color here also makes its beautiful 
blue eyes stand out.
3 
BEGIN THE STRIPES AND DEEPEN THE 
BACKGROUND
With Black, begin adding the stripes of the tiger, following the 
patterns in the line drawing. Add some Black to the insides 
of the ears, but don’t fi ll them in completely. Use the Black to 
deepen the outlines of the mouth area. 
Continue adding Light Cerulean Blue to the background 
around the tiger, working the color toward the suede board’s 
edge. Deepen the tones on the right side of the tiger by add-
ing some Black over the Light Cerulean Blue. Allow it to fade 
out gradually with a light touch.
121

4 
DEEPEN THE TONES AND FINISH THE BACKGROUND
Deepen the tones throughout the drawing. Using Black and a very light touch, create more shadow 
eff ects on the tiger by adding various gray tones around the sides of the face and in the body. To soften 
these shadow areas, overlap the gray areas with Light Cerulean Blue.
 Finish the background by adding more layers of Light Cerulean Blue. Deepen the color directly 
around the tiger, and allow it to fade out toward the suede board’s edge. Soften the darker left side by 
overlapping the Black with Light Cerulean Blue.
Continue to deepen the tiger’s stripes with Black. Do not outline each stripe. They must look natural 
and soft on the edges. In the stripes around the edges of the face, use quick strokes, overlapping the 
white areas. This will render the appearance of individual furs on the face.
To fi nish the drawing, add white whiskers and small hairs with a White pencil. It is important to have a 
sharp point, but also to use fi rm, quick strokes. Make sure to taper the pencil lines at the end to create the 
realistic look of animal hair. It looks unnatural when a pencil line is the same width from beginning to end.
With White, add the whiskers and the hairs inside the ears. Add some White strokes to the outside 
edges of the tiger, overlapping the background. With White, add some small dots into the chin area for 
texture. Finally, add some White to the highlights in the eyes to make them shine.

horse in motion
This is a beautiful photograph of a horse in motion. The mane blowing in 
the wind gives the horse an elegant look and the viewer a feeling of action. 
The extreme contrasts also give the drawing a lot of visual impact. The 
drawing’s intense lights and darks as well as deep shadows are achieved by 
an exaggerated light source.

LAYER THE UNDERTONE AND BEGIN THE BACKGROUND
Base in the undertone of the horse with a light application of Orange. With Terra Cotta, create the 
patterns of muscles and contours of the horse’s body. Where the light heavily refl ects off  the shoulder of 
the horse, it resembles the ripples seen in a moving body of water. Use Terra Cotta to build the dark areas 
here and add color to the mane.
Start the blue background from the top and work down, carefully layering Non-Photo Blue. Allow the 
blue to outline the horse’s face, especially where there is the white blaze down the front of its head and 
nose. Use True Blue around the area of the nose and continue the color down to the lower edge. The sky 
gently fades from light to dark as it moves down the paper.
2 
ESTABLISH THE DARK TONES
Once the grid lines have been 
removed from your drawing paper, 
establish the darkest areas with Black. 
These will be under the horse, along the 
lower edge of the face and neck, and in 
the base of the mane.
124

4 
DEEPEN THE COLORS AND FINISH 
THE BACKGROUND
The fi nal stages of the drawing will take some time because 
the entire drawing is layered, not burnished. Use Tuscan Red 
for the darker areas—the contours of form and muscle—and 
Dark Umber and Black for the darkest shadows. Because you 
are using the layering process, you should still be able to see 
the Orange undertones. Keep a sharp point on your pencils 
so the tones remain smooth and transitional.
Build the color and density of the mane with quick strokes. 
Start at the base of the mane and allow the pencil strokes to 
taper at the ends to enhance the appearance of individual 
hairs. Make sure your pencils lines follow the direction of the 
mane. Build the light colors, alternating Orange and Terra 
Cotta. Alternate Tuscan Red and Black for the darker colors.
Finish building the color of the sky with True Blue and 
Non-Photo Blue. Again, keep a very sharp point at all times to 
ensure the background has an even tone.
THINGS TO 
REMEMBER
• White isn’t white and black isn’t black—both colors 
are neutral and refl ective in nature.
• When building fur color, make sure your pencil 
lines follow the direction that the fur fl ows to create 
texture.
• Consider using suede board when drawing ani-
mals—it gives fur a smooth, realistic appearance.
• To create realistic-looking hair, make sure to taper 
pencil lines at the end.
• Keeping a very sharp point on your pencil will 
ensure the background has an even tone.

People
N
othing is more 
rewarding than 
capturing the people 
you love in your very own work 
of art. Of all the types of art 
that I do, I love looking at the 
portraits I have created of my 
family members the most.
I recommend reading my 
book, Lifelike Portraits from 
Photographs, to use as a guide. 
It goes into much more detail, 
and is excellent for learning how 
to draw professional portraits. 
Enlarge your favorite photos on a 
color copier. This makes it easier 
to see the details and use the grid 
method. 
Tell a Story With a Colored Pencil Portrait
Adding a person to your artwork can 
change your art from a simple drawing of 
objects to one that actually tells a story. This 
drawing has a wonderful story to tell: my 
granddaughter, Taylor, experiencing a close 
encounter with a butterfl y at the zoo.
This is also a great example of art that 
includes a lot of color, both in the foreground 
and background. I chose to create the back-
ground out of focus to make Taylor stand out. 
It appears more as a grouping of light and 
dark green shapes, with little or no detail.
To achieve this blurry look, I heavily 
burnished the background. I also burnished 
the bright colors of her sundress and the 
butterfl y. However, I used a light layering 
approach to give her face the look of child-
like soft skin.

draw a nose
When teaching facial features, I always begin with the nose. It is the perfect 
fi rst step when learning to draw faces because it involves a sphere and the 
fi ve elements of shading. 
Reference Photo
Study the fi ve elements of shading on this 
close-up photo of a nose. Notice the obvi-
ous cast shadows and refl ected light, just 
like a sphere. Use the grid method to draw 
the nose, then carefully remove the grid 
lines with a kneaded eraser. 
1 
DEFINE THE DARKS AND CAST 
SHADOWS
Defi ne the darkest areas of the nose 
using Dark Brown and the layering 
approach. Keep a sharp point on your 
pencil. Leave the refl ected light around 
both of the nostrils, along the tip of 
the nose, and along the edges. Create 
the cast shadow of the right side of the 
nostril on the right, and under the nose.
2 
LAYER THE HALF TONES
With Seashell Pink, layer in the half 
tones of the skin. Make sure you don’t lose 
the areas of refl ected light. With the Dark 
Brown, deepen the shadow areas. With 
Black, fi ll in the nostrils, making it very dark 
under the nostrils’ edges, and allowing the 
tone to lighten as it moves down.
3 
DEEPEN THE TONES
Layer Carmine Red over the Dark Brown shadow areas 
to warm the skin tone. Extend the Carmine Red beyond the 
Dark Brown, allowing it to softly fade into the Seashell Pink.

Reference Photo
Study the subject’s complexion and subtle 
color changes in the lips. Use the grid 
method to draw the mouth, then carefully 
remove the grid lines with a kneaded eraser. 
Mouths and teeth are very important in creating the likeness of a person. 
The lips and each tooth must be exactly the right size, shape, placement 
and color, or it won’t look like the person you are trying to represent. These 
exercises will give you some valuable practice. But don’t stop here—get out 
the magazines and keep practicing! 
1 
DEFINE THE DARKS AND CAST 
SHADOWS
Fill in the dark areas within the corners of 
the mouth with Dark Umber. Lightly edge 
around the teeth to create their shapes. 
Do not use a hard outline. With teeth, a 
dark line represents space between, and 
usually teeth touch each other.
Continue applying Dark Umber 
with a sharp point to the shadow edge 
of the upper lip, to the cast shadow 
below the lower lip, and just above the 
edge of the lower lip. Leave the areas 
of refl ected light alone. Add more Dark 
Umber to the corner of the mouth on 
the right side, and to the indentation 
above the upper lip.
With Chocolate and a sharp point, 
apply tones to the left side of the 
mouth. Add a small amount to the right 
side of the lower lip as well, leaving an 
area of refl ected light.
2 
CREATE THE TONES
Add Peach to the upper lip. Layer 
into the refl ected light area along the 
edge of the lip, leaving the highlight 
the white of the paper.
Add some Peach to the top of the 
lower lip, but be careful not to fi ll in the 
refl ected light along the bottom edge. 
With Carmine Red, add some color to 
the bottom lip. This color is concen-
trated along the upper and bottom 
edges of the lip. Add a small amount of 
Black Raspberry to the right side of the 
upper lip, and use this color to create 
the center creases of the lower lip. Add 
some shadow to the lower teeth with 
Chocolate. Note that the teeth on the 
outside edges are darker since they are 
farther inside the mouth.
3 
DEEPEN THE TONES
Deepen all the tones with the 
layering approach. Burnish White into 
the teeth, using a little bit of Choco-
late to keep them looking natural. 
Add shadows to the lower teeth with 
some Peach.
Use White to burnish in the highlight 
areas and refl ected light around the lips. 
Create the creases of the lips by burnish-
ing White over the other colors with a 
fi rm touch. Do not overdo this detail 
because it will make the lips look aged.

CREATE THE DARK SHADOWS
With Dark Umber, create all the 
shadow areas of the nose and mouth. 
Notice the small, comma-like shape in 
the corner of the mouth. This is called 
the “pit,” and it is very important. It 
makes the mouth look recessed and 
three-dimensional.

Add Peach to the nose area above the 
upper lip and into the lower lip. Leave 
the areas of the highlights alone, allow-
ing the white of the paper to show.

DEEPEN THE TONES AND 
SHADOWS
Build the complexion with the layering 
approach. Using Chocolate and a sharp 
point, lightly create the shadow of the 
cheek along the left side of the nose. Also 
use this color to create the shadow edge 
along the side and edge of the nostril. Be 
sure to leave the refl ected light showing.
Deepen the shadow area between the 
nose and the mouth. Add Chocolate to 
the upper lip and into the small shadow 
above the corner of the mouth.
Using Henna, build the color along the 
lower side of the mouth and the rounded 
area of the chin. Leave the fullest part of 
the lips lighter in tone, with the Peach 
color exposed. Finish the drawing by care-
fully burnishing the highlights of the lip 
with White.

Some students tell me that drawing the ear is the most confusing aspect of 
drawing a portrait. This is because most of us don’t pay much attention to this 
complex feature. The ear is made of many interlocking shapes, and the best 
way to get used to drawing it is to practice over and over. Commit the anatomy 
of the ears to memory—the more you draw, the better you will get!

Eyes are the most important part of the portrait—they reveal all the emotion. The grid plays an 
important part in capturing eyes correctly. You will fi nd that every eye is diff erent, so it is important to 
study your references carefully.
When drawing eyes at an angle, the perfect circles of the irises and pupils turn into ellipses instead 
(circles in perspective). However, always center the pupil inside the circle of the iris for front-view por-
traits. The iris is nature’s perfect circle, so use a template to ensure the accuracy of these shapes.
Eyes are moist and refl ective, so there is always at least one highlight refl ected. No matter how 
many highlights your photo reference shows, reduce it to just one. Place the highlight halfway in the 
pupil and halfway in the iris, so it does not aff ect the gaze of the eye.
Reference Photo
Use the grid method to achieve a line drawing. Be particularly care-
ful with the irises and pupil, and take special note of the tilt of the 
eyes. When you are happy with your subject, remove the grid lines 
with a kneaded eraser.
1 
BURNISH THE IRIS AND PUPIL, CREATE THE EYELIDS
Burnish the entire iris with Artichoke. With Black, burnish the pupil completely, 
except for the small dot that represents the highlight or catchlight.
With Black, outline the outer edge of the iris and streak some into the iris to cre-
ate the line pattern that exists in the irises of many eyes. 
With White, burnish directly around the pupil. Avoid burnishing over the pupil’s 
refl ected light. Burnish the catchlight with White.
Using Black and a light touch, create the crease of the eyelid and the upper and 
lower lash lines. With Dark Brown, create the shapes of the eyebrows. Notice that 
on the lower lash line there is a shelf or ridge created by the thickness of the lower 
lid directly below the iris. The lashes grow out of the lowest edge. This lower lid 
thickness is essential when drawing eyes. With Peach and a sharp point, layer the 
skin color around the eye area, including the lower lid thickness.
2 
CONTINUE TO LAYER THE SKIN TONES AND SHADOWS
Deepen the skin tone around the eyes with Henna. Add this color into the 
corner membranes. Notice the ridge of refl ected light above the eyelid crease of 
the right eye.
With Seashell Pink, add a slight shadow to the eyeball in the corners. Also add it 
below the eye on the left to enhance the look of roundness.
3 
DEEPEN THE SKIN TONES, ADD THE EYEBROWS AND LASHES
Continue to build the color of the skin tone. Use quick strokes with Black to 
create the eyebrows and eyelashes, tapering the pencil stroke at the end. Study the 
length and direction of the diff erent types of hairs, and practice drawing them on a 
separate piece of paper. It requires a very short, quick stroke to make the line taper 
at the end. Keep a very sharp point on your pencil, especially for the short, sparse 
lower lashes.

drawing hair
You saw in the previous exercise how 
important the pencil line is to creating 
eyelashes and eyebrows. It is the same 
with drawing hair. The pencil lines 
represent the length of the hair, and 
they must be drawn in accordingly. 
It is very important to establish the 
skin tones of the face before begin-
ning on the hair. The skin will show 
through the hair and around the 
hairline. 
Study these close-up examples. 
You can see how they were created 
by applying diff erent types of pencil 
strokes. 
Close-up Study of Long, Dark Hair
To create long hair, make long, quick strokes in the direction that the 
hair grows. Strive to taper your pencil lines at the end of each strand. 
Because hair is multi-colored, work from light to dark as you are add-
ing the tones to make it look realistic. The dark tones will reinforce 
the shadows of the layers of hair and the curls. Repeat many applica-
tions of color, layer after layer, to build volume. Hair is made up of 
thousands and thousands of hair strands—it is impossible to create 
the look of thick hair with only twenty or thirty pencil strokes!
Colors Used
Peach, Terra Cotta, Dark Brown, Sky Blue Light, Black, White
Close-up Study of Curly, Dark Hair 
To create this type of hair, use your pencil “on the fl at” and very small, 
light, circular strokes. The hair is much thicker in the middle of the 
scalp, and becomes less dense toward the outer edge where it 
meets the face. Begin with the lightest color, then layer on top with 
darker tones.
Colors Used
Terra Cotta, Black
132

Close-up Study of Short, Gray Hair
Hair grows in layers that overlap to create patterns. With wavy hair, 
each area has both light and dark areas, and it must be built up with 
multiple pencil strokes. Study this example, and you can see how 
the dark pencil strokes are placed on top of light pencil strokes to 
create these patterns.
Colors Used
Cool Grey 70%, Cool Grey 50%, French Grey 70%, White
Close-up Study of the Band of Light
Long, shiny hair has a band of light that refl ects the light source 
along the curve of the head. This is where the roundness of the 
head is illuminated much like the full-light area of a sphere. Leave 
the highlight area the white of the paper and build layers of color 
around it from light to dark until it looks thick and smooth. Find 
more detail on creating blonde hair on pages 136–139.

Enhance Skin Tones With Colored Paper
The color of Martin Luther King Jr.’s skin is 
enhanced by the peach-toned drawing 
board. Some of the board shows through 
the drawing, enhancing the rich tones. I 
used many layers of Black in the background 
to make the portrait pop from the page.
I created his hair using the side of my 
pencil with tight, circular strokes. This 
technique makes the hair look full and richly 
textured.
Combine Techniques in Portraitures
I love this portrait of Ray Charles because of 
the many rich colors. Notice the combina-
tion of artistic methods, from the circular 
strokes depicting his hair to the refl ective 
color and light used to show dimension. 
Combining eff ects is a good way to achieve 
realism in your work. Remember, portraiture 
requires practice, skill and, above all, time!
The paper you use can help you create realistic skin tones.

paper. If you are drawing a darker complexion, choose a

PLACE THE PORTRAIT’S UNDERTONES AND SHADOWS
Study the colors of the reference photo, and lightly place all the tones of the portrait. Lightly edge the 
intense shadows along the right side of the face with Dark Brown. Use this color along the jaw lines, under 
the hair on the right side and down the entire side of the face. Also with Dark Brown, create the shape of 
the eyebrows, the edges of the nose and the mouth. Gently fi ll in the dark shade of the upper lip.
With Black, create the shapes of the eyes, irises and pupils. Do not fi ll in the iris yet. Also with Black, lightly 
fi ll in the collar of the jacket and edge along the fi ngers and hand, placing some tone into the tree bark.
Use Black Raspberry to create the shapes of the shadows on the face along the right side, and also 
where the hair casts a shadow on the left side of the face. Then add some of the shadows to the hand. 
These shadows create the dimension and form of the face.
Add Canary Yellow to the hair, deliberately leaving the band of light untouched. Pull the hair strands 
out in long strokes and in the same direction. With Goldenrod, add the dark tones on both sides of the 
part with shorter strokes. You should be able to detect the individual hair strands; this enhances the look 
of realistic texture.
Use True Blue and a light touch to begin the tones of the denim jacket. Begin to layer the back-
ground’s undertone with Apple Green.  
137

3 
DEEPEN THE TONES AND 
CREATE THE FORM
To build the skin tone, add Peach to 
both the face and the hand. On the 
hand, use an even layer of color over 
the entire area, overlapping the color 
already there. On the face, make the 
color deeper on the left side along the 
jaw by layering, keeping your pencil 
point sharp at all times. Overlap the 
Black Raspberry already there, allow-
ing the colors to merge together. 
You should begin to see the sphere 
exercises in the cheeks, the nose and 
the chin.
With Henna, add some color to the 
lower lip, and to the cast shadow of 
the hair below the eye on the left. Add 
Henna to the creases under the eyes 
as well.
Deepen the color of the hair by add-
ing more Canary Yellow. While you’re 
there, add a little to the background, 
just to the right side of the face. Create 
the darker areas of the hair with Light 
Umber using long, quick strokes to rep-
licate the hair’s texture. For the deeper 
shadow area on the right side, add 
some layers of Dark Brown. 
To create the fuzzy texture of the col-
lar, use your pencil on the fl at, and build 
the color with both Black and Dark 
Brown using small, circular strokes. It is 
identical to the way I created the dark, 
curly hair on page 132. 
Create more texture in the tree bark 
between the fi ngers and above the 
hand using Dark Brown and Black.
To create the look of creases and 
folds in the jacket, add Denim Blue to 
the shadow areas. You may recognize 
the interlocking fold from page 62.
THINGS TO REMEMBER
• The lips and each tooth must be exactly the right size, shape, placement 
and color, or it won’t look like the person you’re trying to represent.
• Enlarge photos on a color copier so you can see details and use the grid 
method more easily.
• The “pit” is the comma-like shape in the corner of the mouth. It makes the 
mouth look recessed and three-dimensional.
• Eyes are the most important part of a portrait because they reveal emotion.
• The iris is nature’s perfect circle, so use a template to ensure the accuracy 
of these shapes.
• Establish skin tones on a face before drawing hair.
• You must obtain permission to sell works of art that depict famous people.

Use more Henna to deepen the corners of the eyes and add more color to the lips. Use Seashell 
Pink to shadow the eyeballs for roundness. Also add Seashell Pink to the area between the nose and the 
mouth to soften the edges of the shadows, allowing it to fade into the white of the paper. Add Denim 
Blue to the irises to create the eye color.
Use Seashell Pink to soften and transition the colors of the skin on the hand. Create the ring with Black 
and White, burnishing the colors for the look of shiny silver.
Burnish the highlight areas of the hair with White, and add White to the tips of the hair for shine. To 
warm up the hair tones, streak a little bit of Henna into it in the shadow areas under the ear, where it over-
laps the face, and on the outside edge of the head on the right side.
Create the look of tree bark with harsh, heavy pencil lines. It is exactly like the examples on pages 45 
and 67. Overlap colors to give the illusion of texture. Add some Goldenrod for a warm color, then con-
tinue to build texture with Dark Brown and Black. Burnish in some White for the highlights. 
Using the layered approach, continue to build the blue tones of the denim jacket with True Blue and 
Denim Blue. In the deepest shadow areas of the interlocking fold, use Black. Finish the collar with more 
layers of circular strokes in Black and Dark Brown.
Create the illusion of leaves by adding subtle leaf shapes along the right side of the face using Grass 
Green and Dark Green. The subtlety of leaves will keep from overwhelming the portrait with a busy back-
ground. Add shadows behind the left side of the head using Grass Green to add depth.

At Grandma’s House
Look at the variety of textures, repeated tones, complementary colors and techniques used 
in this piece of art.
Sometimes a piece of art has just the 
right combination of color, shapes, 
composition and mood that qualifi es 
it as a true masterpiece. For me, this is 
one of those pieces. Personally, this is a 
very meaningful portrait of my grand-
mother, sitting in her favorite chair in 
the apartment that I remember so well 
as a child. Every item represented in this 
drawing evokes a very emotional mem-
ory for me. It tugs at my heart every 
time I look at it—it perfectly captures 
my grandma the way I remember her, 
making it seem like it was just yesterday 
that I was right there with her. 
A True Masterpiece

There clearly were not enough pages 
in this book, because I could go on and 
on and on. But, as they say, all good 
things must come to an end! While 
this may be the end of another Lee 
Hammond book, it should not be the 
end of your practice. The projects in this 
book are just the beginning for you. 
Continue enjoying the wonderful world 
of colored pencil. Scour magazines, 
books and most of all, your own photo 
albums for interesting subjects to draw 
and create amazing compositions using 
your trusty viewfi nders. You just never 
know when something will inspire you!
I’ll leave you with one of my favorite 
sayings: “There is never a lack of subject 
matter—just absence of creativity!“
Have fun!
