elcome to Customer Analytics For Dummies. This is a book about using 
data to make better decisions about — and for — your customers. 
With this book, you find out valuable ways of quantifying your customers’ 
journey, before, during, and after a product or service experience. You dis-
cover methods and metrics to improve a customer’s experience with a prod-
uct, service, and brand.
About This Book
You might already be familiar with some form of customer analytics through 
product development, marketing, sales, and customer services. But the heart 
of customer analytics is staying focused on the customer, which might be a 
new concept for you.
In Customer Analytics For Dummies, I discuss the finer points of customer 
analytics. Customer analytics involves gathering data about your customers 
at various stages of the buying experience, detecting patterns from that data, 
predicting actions your customers will take, and then making decisions about 
how to improve your business to attract more customers and keep the cus-
tomers you already have.
I also include real-world examples from some of the dozens of organizations 
I’ve worked with, both big and small, to collect, analyze, and help improve 
the customer experience. These examples, which include actual data and 
the methods used, show you what you can accomplish through customer 
analytics.
You don’t need to read this book cover to cover. You can if that appeals 
to you, but it’s set up as a useful reference guide to dip into as you need. 
Stumped by a certain situation? Look in the table of contents or index, find 
the topic you need, and then flip to the page to resolve your problem.
Whether you’re new to customer analytics or an experienced market analyst, 
you’ll find something that will help you.

Customer Analytics For Dummies 
Foolish Assumptions
To get the most from this book, you need to be interested in using data to 
improve the customer experience. And I assume you are, since you are hold-
ing this book (for which your humble author thanks you, by the way!). I also 
assume you are comfortable with computers and working with numbers and 
data. And although it isn’t necessary and I don’t assume you have it, it would 
helpful if you had access to a spreadsheet program, such as Microsoft Excel 
(and are familiar with how it functions). You should also have access to cus-
tomer data, be able to collect customer data, or at least want to collect and 
analyze customer data. Of course, I provide tips throughout this book to help 
you get started. (I’d be foolish not to, right?)
Icons Used in This Book
Throughout the book, you’ll see these little graphic icons to identify useful 
paragraphs.
	
The Tip icon marks tips and shortcuts that you can take to make a specific 
task easier.
	
The Remember icon marks the information that’s especially important to 
know. To siphon off the most important information in each chapter, just skim 
through these icons.
	
The Technical Stuff icon marks information of a highly technical nature that 
you can safely skip over without harm.
	
The Warning icon tells you to watch out! It marks important information that 
may save you headaches. Warning: Don’t skip over these warnings!

Chapter 1
Introducing Customer Analytics
In This Chapter
▶	Discovering the benefits of customer analytics
▶	Combining methods and metrics for customer insights
▶	Sorting through big and small data
T
 
he purpose of business is to create and keep a customer. This statement 
was made by Peter Drucker, the acclaimed 20th-century management 
consultant. A simple statement that reveals in just a few words that the 
long-term viability of a company is not just about maximizing revenue and 
minimizing costs. Long-term viability is about understanding what it takes to 
attract customers by continuing to meet and exceed their physical and psy-
chological needs.
Good customer management comes from good customer measurement. 
Metrics are numbers assigned to everything from website visitors, same-
store sales, and profit margin to call-center wait times. Analytics are metrics 
plus the methods that drive meaningful decisions. You can think of metrics 
as “informational,” while analytics are “strategic.” So while not all metrics are 
analytics, all analytics come from metrics. You need metrics to get analytics.
Increasingly, decisions are made on numbers. If you know the numbers 
better, and can articulate what those numbers mean and how you can differ-
entiate a product, organization, or brand, you can distinguish yourself from 
your competitors.
Defining Customer Analytics
Although it might not be called customer analytics, chances are, you’re 
already familiar with some form of customer analytics. The efforts and activi-
ties of product development, marketing, sales, and services are driven to 
anticipate and fulfill customer needs. That is, you can’t sell a product unless 
someone has a need for it.

Part I: Getting Started with Customer Analytics 
Customer analytics is a new term and is broadly used, but it generally 
includes the following actions and activities:
	
✓	Gathering data: Pull together customer purchase records, transactional 
data, surveys, and observational data at all phases of a customer’s journey.
	
✓	Using mathematical models to detect patterns: There are many number 
crunching, statistical analysis, and advanced modeling techniques that 
help turn raw data into more meaningful chunks.
	
✓	Finding the insight: From the patterns of the data come insights into 
causes of customer behavior.
	
✓	Supporting decisions: Understanding past behavior helps predict future 
customer behavior from data instead of relying on intuition.
	
✓	Optimizing the customer experience: Detect problems with features, 
purchases, and the product or service experience.
	
✓	Mapping the customer journey: From considering, purchasing, and 
engaging with products and services, mapping the touchpoints and pain 
points helps identify opportunities for improvement.
Customer analytics is different from many of the other metrics within an 
organization. The four critical ingredients of customer analytics are:
	
✓	Customer focused: The first word in customer analytics is customer. This 
means that the metrics collected need to come from customer actions or 
attitudes, or are derived in some way that’s connected to customers.
	
✓	At the individual customer level: You need access to the lowest level of 
customer transaction data, not data rolled up at the product or company 
level.
	
✓	Longitudinal: Customer analytics involves looking at customer behavior 
over time.
	
✓	Behavioral and attitudinal: You need a mix of what customers do and 
what customers think. Although customer actions (purchasing, recom-
mending) are ultimately what you care about, attitudes affect actions — so 
measuring and understanding customer attitudes helps to predict future 
behavior.
The benefits of customer analytics
The benefit of customer analytics is that better decisions are made with data, 
which leads to a number of tangible benefits:
	
✓	Streamlined campaigns: You can target your marketing efforts, thus 
reduce costs.

 Chapter 1: Introducing Customer Analytics
	
✓	Competitive pricing: You can price your products according to demand 
and by what customers expect.
	
✓	Customization: Customers can select from a combination of features or 
service that meets their needs.
	
✓	Reduced waste: Manage your inventory better by anticipating customer 
demands.
	
✓	Faster delivery: Knowing what products will sell when and where allows 
manufacturing efforts to anticipate demand and prevent a loss of sales.
	
✓	Higher profitability: More competitive prices, reduced costs, and 
higher sales are results of targeted marketing efforts.
	
✓	Loyal customers: Delivering the right features at the right price 
increases customer satisfaction and leads to loyal customers, which are 
essential for long-term growth
In the following sections, I go more in-depth about the data you collect with 
customer analytics.
Multidisciplinary
The realm of customer analytics crosses departments, skills, and traditional 
roles. It’s multidisciplinary and typically involves input from and output to:
	
✓	Marketing: This encompasses the messaging, advertising, and the cus-
tomer demographics and segments.
	
✓	Information Technology (IT): The IT department usually has access to 
the databases of customer transactions and data.
	
✓	Sales: Front-line contact with customers, knowledge of pricing, revenue, 
transactions, and reasons for lost customers are included here.
	
✓	Product development: This includes product features, functions, and 
usability.
Multimetric
No single metric can define customer analytics. It requires a combination of 
both behavioral and attitudinal data. Some common ones include:
	
✓	Revenue: Simple enough, this is your top line and you’re probably track-
ing this for your accountant already.
	
✓	Transactions: How many transactions are you completing in a given time 
frame? Digging deeper into the data, transactions become important for 
finding patterns.
	
✓	Customer Lifetime Revenue: The total top line revenue a customer gen-
erates over some “lifetime,” which can be days, months or years (see 
Chapter 6).

Part I: Getting Started with Customer Analytics 
	
✓	Future intent: Will your existing customers buy from you again (see 
Chapter 11 and Chapter 12)?
	
✓	Likelihood to recommend: How likely will customers recommend your 
company and products (see Chapter 12)?
	
✓	Product usage: Which features are your customers actually using (see 
Chapters 10 and 13)?
	
✓	Website visits: Are potential customers finding your website and 
doing what you expect — finding information or buying a product (see 
Chapter 10)?
	
✓	Return rates: How many products are being returned due to dissatisfac-
tion (see Chapter 11)?
	
✓	Abandonment rates: Did a customer start a transaction and then quit 
before completing (see Chapter 10)?
	
✓	Conversion rates: How many potential customers do you convert into 
actual customers (Chapter 10)?
	
✓	Satisfaction: Are customers satisfied with your product, company, and 
service (Chapter 9)?
	
✓	Usability: Do customers have problems using your products (see 
Chapter 15)?
	
✓	Findability: Can customers find the features they’re looking for in your 
products, or find what they’re looking for in your website? I discuss find-
ability in Chapter 15.
Multimethod
No single method defines customer analytics. Some common methods, most 
of which are discussed throughout this book, include:
	
✓	Surveys analysis: This involves collecting, analyzing, and posing deci-
sion questions directly to your customers. Chapter 9 has more details 
on what to ask.
	
✓	Customer segmentation: Not all customers have the same backgrounds, 
goals, or buying patterns; grouping your customers into similar patterns 
helps identify opportunities for better marketing and product develop-
ment. Chapter 4 has more details.
	
✓	Customer journey mapping: Understanding the process customers go 
through as they engage with a service uncovers pain points and oppor-
tunities for improvement (see Chapter 7).
	
✓	Transactional analysis: This examines the purchase frequency, amount, 
and the type of products purchased together for patterns and predictions.
	
✓	Factor analysis: This statistical technique helps identify clusters of 
similar customers (see Chapter 4) and similar response patterns from 
survey results (see Chapter 9).

 Chapter 1: Introducing Customer Analytics
	
✓	Cluster analysis: Similar to factor analysis, this statistical technique groups 
customers together into clusters (see Chapter 4) and identifies the best 
labels for customers to find items in website navigation (see Chapter 15).
	
✓	Regression analysis: This statistical technique identifies the key 
variables that have the biggest impact on customer satisfaction (see 
Chapter 9) and customer loyalty (see Chapter 12).
	
✓	Neural networks/machine learning: Advanced software programs can 
adapt to patterns learned from data mining and better predict customer 
needs. This is covered in Predictive Analytics For Dummies by Anasse 
Bari, Mohamed Chaouchi, and Tommy Jung (Wiley).
Using customer analytics
Customer analytics are used across industries in both small and large organi-
zations. Examples of customer analytics at work include:
	
✓	Retail: Targeted promotions based on past purchase for individual cus-
tomers mean retailers anticipate needs and send coupons for things like 
home improvement or diapers.
	
✓	Finance: Credit card companies can understand when customers are 
more likely to cancel their account based on non-usage, as well as detect 
fraud based on unusual purchases.
	
✓	Online: An understanding of which designs, layouts, navigation structures, 
and even how the color of buttons affect customer purchases (called con-
version rates) is used extensively across most Internet retailers.
	
✓	Software: Customers who need sales force automation software often 
also need accounting software and human resources software.
Professionals who specialize in customer analytics typically have a back-
ground that includes a mix of mathematical and software skills. These indi-
viduals typically go by titles such as:
	
✓	Data scientist
	
✓	Statistician
	
✓	Database analyst
Just as most organizations are already measuring customer analytics, most 
businesspersons also can use customer analytics. You don’t need a PhD in 
statistics or even a specialization in math. All you need is some desire to 
better understand a customer and a willingness to answer business questions 
with data. Customer analytics is therefore also done by

Compiling Big and Small Data
Customer analytics is often associated with big data. Big data refers to extremely 
large datasets, often containing millions or billions of customer transactions or 
records. These large datasets are analyzed with sophisticated software to reveal 
patterns, trends, and associations. Big data allows you to detect very subtle 
trends and patterns that may have a large impact on revenue.
But customer analytics is also about small data. While not as trendy as big 
data, small data refers to finding insights with datasets that often contain less 
than 30 customers. With small data, you’re limited to seeing larger patterns in 
attitudes.
While the field of customer analytics is still being defined and varies across 
organizations and industries, it usually involves some combination of the 
following:
	
✓	Past behavior: Customer analytics is about using data from the past to 
predict future behavior. This is both a definition and a warning. What 
customers did in the past is no guarantee of what they will do in the 
future. If a certain type of customer purchased one type of product in 
the past, he is probably more likely to do so again in the future; however, 
there’s no guarantee.
	
✓	Predictive modeling: Software programs are able to detect patterns in 
behavior, even subtle ones that are difficult for humans to detect with 
intuition or just inspecting data. For example, software can determine 
quickly that a certain segment of customers, such as higher-income 
mothers, are more likely to purchase certain products and aren’t sensi-
tive to changes in price.
	
	A model is a description of a customer interaction, process, or behavior 
that can be used to predict future outcomes. For example, the sales price 
of a house can be estimated by its total square footage. In general, bigger 
houses sell for more than smaller homes in the same neighborhood.
	
	This book focuses on the methods and metrics that help answer busi-
ness questions and set the groundwork for predicting. There is a special 
branch of customer analytics that deals exclusively with making predic-
tions with software. See the appendix for a primer on getting started 
with prediction.

 Chapter 1: Introducing Customer Analytics
	
✓	What-if scenarios: Customer analytics allows you to test “what-if” sce-
narios by looking at past customer data and estimating how future data 
may change based on manipulating things like product features, prices, 
messaging, or some combination of those elements.
	
✓	Customer experience: While customer analytics often involves the hard 
numbers of transactional data, sales, and profitability, it also involves 
understanding the customer’s experience with a product or service.
	
	Measuring the customer experience involves collecting metrics for the 
entire journey a customer has with a brand or organization — including 
awareness, purchasing, and long-term usage. This involves collecting a 
mix of metrics about behaviors and attitudes.
	
	Customer analytics includes the metrics for the customer experience. 
It’s as much about how the customer uses a product as it is about what 
goes into the product.

Embracing the Science 
and Art of Metrics
In This Chapter
▶	Quantifying and qualifying data
▶	Identifying types of data
▶	Deciding on the correct sample size
▶	Knowing what to measure
C
 
ustomer analytics largely involves turning customer actions and atti-
tudes into data. Not all data is the same, and knowing what type of data 
you’re dealing with guides you through what you can do with it. When you 
can interpret the data that’s available to you, you can start making better 
decisions about product features and service experiences.
In this chapter, I help you understand the different types of data, and show 
you how to work with quantitative and qualitative data. I also cover best 
practices for identifying the best metrics to manage.
You’ll have to put on your analytical thinking cap (the science of metrics) and 
your creative thinking cap (the art of metrics). If you aren’t a numbers person 
and decide to hire someone who is, that’s okay. But this is still a useful chap-
ter because you need to know how to talk to your analytics person. And you 
still need to know how to interpret the numbers so you can make sound deci-
sions about how to improve your business.
Adding up Quantitative Data
Quantitative data is information that’s broken down by concrete numbers — 
for example, how many products a customer places in the shopping cart (3) 
or how much revenue you earn from a specific customer ($2,000).

16
Part I: Getting Started with Customer Analytics 
Quantitative data falls into two categories:
	
✓	Discrete (countable items)
	
✓	Continuous (measurements)
You encounter a lot of numbers when quantifying customer experience with 
products and services. Knowing whether the data is discrete or continuous 
dictates the method you use in your analysis and reporting.
Discrete and continuous data
Discrete data has finite values, or buckets. You can count them. For example, 
the number of questions correct would be discrete: There are a finite and 
countable number of questions.
Other examples of discrete data are
	
✓	Number of products in your catalog
	
✓	Number of employees you have
	
✓	Number of customer reviews for a specific product
Continuous data technically has an infinite number of steps, which form a 
continuum. The time to find a product on a website is continuous because it 
could take 31.627543 seconds. Time forms an interval from 0 to infinity.
Other examples of continuous data are
	
✓	Dimensions of a specific product
	
✓	Miles to your retail store from a customer’s location
	
✓	Time for a customer to find the information he or she is looking for on 
your website
	
✓	Days until a product ships to a customer
	
You can usually tell the difference between discrete and continuous data 
because discrete data can’t be broken into smaller meaningful units. You can’t 
have half a customer, but you can have half a minute.
Levels of data
Another way customer analytics data gets divided is by the four levels of 
measurement. They’re levels because they start with data that’s more limit-
ing in the type of analysis you can perform to the least limiting:

 Chapter 2: Embracing the Science and Art of Metrics
	
✓	Nominal: This includes discrete data such as the name of your company, 
type of car you drive, or name of a product. Nominal means essentially 
“in name only”; if you have a name, it belongs in this category. Nominal 
data is qualitative data.
	
✓	Ordinal: This includes data that has a natural ordering. The ranking of 
customers by oldest to newest, the order of callers in a queue for a call 
center, the order of runners finishing a race, or more often, the choice 
on a rating scale, such as from 1 to 5.
	
	With ordinal data, you cannot know with certainty whether the intervals 
between each value are equal. In measuring customers’ attitudes toward 
their experience with products and services, you have to rely heavily on 
questionnaire data that uses rating scales. For example, on an 11-point 
rating scale, the difference between a 9 and a 10 is not necessarily the 
same as the difference between a 6 and a 7.
	
✓	Interval: This is data that has equally split intervals between each value. 
The most common example is temperature in degrees Fahrenheit. The 
difference between 29 degrees and 30 degrees is the same magnitude 
as the difference between 78 degrees and 79 degrees (I much prefer the 
latter of these two examples).
	
✓	Ratio: This is interval data with a natural zero point. For example, time 
to find a product on a website is ratio, because 0 time is meaningful. 
Degrees Kelvin has a 0 point (absolute zero). The steps in both these 
scales have the same degree of magnitude.
	
	Whenever you can establish that data is ratio, you can make reasonable 
deductions, such as “customers are twice as satisfied using a new product 
version compared to an old version.”
	
	Just because customers’ average rating on one product is a 4 and the 
rating on another product is a 2 doesn’t mean customers are twice as 
satisfied. The first rating is definitely twice as high, but unless the scale 
is both ratio, and calibrated so the numbers correspond to customer 
behavior, making such claims is risky. It’s best to simply say the rating 
was twice as high.
Many organizations, statisticians, and even software programs use this hier-
archy so it’s important to understand the terms when you encounter them. 
Some analysts even restrict their analysis based on it (see the sidebar “The 
history of levels of measurement” for more information).
Figure 2-1 shows how the levels of measurement fit into the broader categori-
zation of qualitative and quantitative data.

The history of levels of measurement
Where did the levels of measurement come 
from and why should you care? Well, you 
should at least care about identifying nominal 
or categorical data. If it isn’t nominal, then it’s 
quantitative. So why all the fuss?
In the 1940s, when behavioral science was in its 
infancy, there was much concern about trying 
to make the practice as legitimate as possible. 
Psychology and other social and behavioral sci-
ences are considered soft sciences as opposed 
to the hard sciences of chemistry and physics. 
It was thought that applying some of the same 
thinking from the hard sciences would improve 
the legitimacy of these soft sciences — as well 
as the veracity of the claims made.
One approach was to map types of scaling to 
more natural laws (something akin to the physi-
cal laws of gravity and motion). This classification 
system was proposed in 1946 by S.S. Stevens. In 
the article, Stevens went so far as to say that you 
should only take averages on at least interval 
and ratio data. Nominal and ordinal data should 
only be counted and described in frequency 
tables — no means and standard deviations.
One of the more famous articles showing the 
fallacy of such rigid thinking was by an eminent 
statistician named Lord, who in his article “On 
the Statistical Treatment of Football Numbers” 
showed how the means of nominal data can be 
meaningful too!
In practice, rating scales are ubiquitous in 
companies and rarely have they been shown to 
have interval, much less ratio scales (what is 
the 0 point of customer satisfaction ?) 
In summary, it’s generally OK to take means 
and apply statistical tests to ordinal data, just 
be careful about making ratio claims such as 
“twice as satisfied.”

Variables
A variable is a characteristic of a product or service that varies, which can 
often be manipulated. For example, price, delivery time, and color are prod-
uct variables. Customer variables can include gender, income, geography, 
new customer versus existing customer, and type of industry, to name a few. 
When you look at product and customer variables, you can understand how 
different product attributes attract more or less sales and how different cus-
tomers respond to different products and feature combinations.
There are two types of variables:
	
✓	Dependent variables are usually the things you care about but can’t affect 
directly, such as profitability, customer satisfaction, and customer loyalty. 
You can influence dependent variables by changing the independent vari-
ables. An example of this relationship is shown in Figure 2-2.
	
✓	Independent variables can be directly controlled or manipulated.
	
	For example, independent variables include price, features, advertising, 
and usability.
	
Often, independent variables correlate with dependent variables, but the cor-
relation doesn’t equal causation. Other variables that you’re not measuring 
can “mediate” or be responsible for the relationship. For example, higher sales 
(dependent variable) might be attributed to a new marketing campaign (inde-
pendent variable) but the increase is actually just due to a growing economy 
that’s helped all businesses (mediator variable). See the appendix for more 
discussion on measuring correlation and causation between variables.
	
You can think of independent variables as the ingredients you use to cook a 
stew. The soup is the dependent variable (what you care about), but adjusting 
the ingredients and their combinations is what you can control.
Variables often come in the form of words instead of numbers — for example, 
new customer or existing customer, male or female, high income or low 
income. To make analysis of these qualitative values easier, you can code 
them into dummy variables by assigning them a number (for example, new 
customers get coded a 1 and existing customers get coded a 0; men get 
coded as 1 and women coded as 0 [or vice versa]).
With your variables coded as 1s and 0s, you can compute the percentage of 
customers with each variable.

Quantifying Qualitative Data
Qualitative data is often helpful by itself to explain the “why” behind low sat-
isfaction rates, higher sales, or high customer turnover rates. For example, 
if you see customers complaining that they don’t know what the total price 
of their order is in local currency or how to change the currency in a website 
shopping cart, you know what you can fix.
Comments provide immediate insight and potentially action (improve the 
currency display on checkout).
	
Always take the time to sort and count customer comments. Just because 
customer information is qualitative doesn’t mean you can’t use quantitative 
methods to interpret qualitative data to make better decisions. If you find that 
a significant portion of comments revolve around a specific issue (say 20% of 
the comments center around currency issues), you’ve just turned your quali-
tative data into quantitative data.

Quantifying iTunes experiences
My company asked 56 customers to rate their experience with iTunes. Customers answered sev-
eral questions about the ease of use and quality of iTunes and whether they would recommend it 
to their friends. (See Chapter 12 for more on customer loyalty.) Customers who provided low scores 
were asked to briefly describe what motivated the rating.
For example, one customer said
I used to use iTunes much more often before they raised their prices from 99 cents to $1.29 per 
song. I still use the iTunes player to transfer songs to my iPod but I usually buy songs on Amazon.
com now because it’s a much better deal.
And another said
I dislike iTunes. It’s unnecessary and can be annoying and difficult to use.
In total, 16 customers were rather dissatisfied with the iTunes experience. To understand the main 
drivers behind the dissatisfaction and the prevalence of some of these issues in the larger popula-
tion, similar comments were first grouped, followed by the total number of comments in each of 
the groups. This table shows the results.

Conclusions from this data indicate that one of the primary reasons users are unlikely to recom-
mend (called detractors) iTunes is because it is difficult to use, with four users making comments 
about ease.
Usability is often a key driver of product loyalty, and iTunes is no exception. (See Chapter 14 for 
more on usability.) I was 95% confident that between 9% and 50% of all iTunes detractors feel ease 
of use is one of the main reasons for not recommending the product to a friend.
I generated a 95% confidence interval around each group of comments using the online calculator 
(www.measuringu.com/wald.htm) to get an idea about how prevalent these reasons would 
be in the whole iTunes user population.

Part I: Getting Started with Customer Analytics 
Quantifying the frequency of customer comments helps you understand how 
prevalent a certain attitude may be in your entire customer population. Some 
examples of open-ended responses (often called verbatim responses) are 
common for things such as:
	
✓	Reasons why customers are not recommending your product
	
✓	Observations from customers using a product at their workplace
	
✓	Product complaints in customer service calls
	
Here are three steps you can follow to turn qualitative data into quantitative 
data to estimate the prevalence of responses:
	
1.	Group similar comments and behaviors.
	
	 Customers will use their own words to describe how they feel. Group 
similar phrases, behaviors, or concepts together. Some comments will 
be virtually identical and grouped easily. Others will differ and require 
additional layers of grouping.
	
	 There can be a high amount of variability between people grouping 
items. If possible, consider having multiple people independently cat-
egorize comments.
	
2.	Count the frequency.
	
	 Count the number that appear in a category and the total number. If 5 
out of 50 comments are related to price, for example, then an estimate of 
how often price is a concern is 10% (5/50).
	
3.	Estimate the frequency.
	
	 You can estimate how common an issue is with the entire customer base 
by using a confidence interval (discussed later in this chapter). 
	
Collecting data from a sample of customers costs a lot less and takes a lot less 
time than measuring every customer. The level of precision you get from even 
a small sample is usually sufficient to make decisions from the data.
Determining the Sample Size You Need
It would be good to know what customers think or what product features 
they like so you can build better products. How do you get this information? 
By asking your customers to take a poll.
But the problem is you rarely can ask all your customers to take your poll. 
That would be too time intensive and expensive, and you’d be swimming in 
data. Instead you collect data from a sample of customers. Your sample size 
can be small — 5 to 10 customers, or very large — 10,000+ customers. The 
data you collect from your sample represents all your customers.

Surveying a sample of customers is a tried and true method. Polling agencies 
that measure electoral votes take the same approach: They ask only a subset 
of the voting population to predict how the entire electorate will vote.
You can achieve a rather low margin of error after just sampling a small frac-
tion of the entire population. There is a diminishing return from increasing 
sample sizes beyond a certain point. While you want your estimate to be 
accurate, you have to determine the sample size you can afford based on 
your budget and company resources.
Table 2-1 shows a table of confidence intervals around different sample sizes. 
You can see how the margin of error and width of the confidence interval 
decrease as the sample increases. As a general approximation, you need to 
quadruple your sample size in order to cut your margin of error in half.

Polling sample sizes
In August 2014, Gallup reported the presiden-
tial job approval rate was 41% with a margin of 
error of +/- 3%, using a 95% level of confidence.
Gallup derived this approval rate by asking 
1,500 representative voters. Fifteen hundred 
responses represent some 240 million citizens, 
or just .001%!
This small proportion has a small margin of error. If 
Gallup were somehow to ask every voter whether 
he or she approved of the president, the best esti-
mate of the job approval rating is between 38% 
and 44% (41% - 3% and 41% + 3%, respectively). 
This range is created by adding and subtracting 
the margin of error to the sample percentage.

For example, at a sample size of 381, your sample estimate will have a margin 
of error of approximately plus or minus 5%. That means if a survey to cus-
tomers indicates that 50% say they would repurchase their subscription in 
the following year, you can be 95% confident that between 45% and 55% of 
all customers actually will. The sample size needed when making compari-
sons (say, between different product designs) will differ, and is covered in 
Chapters 10, 14 and 15.
Estimating with a confidence interval
Rarely will you be able to survey every customer. Instead you need to take 
a sample of customers and use this sample to make inferences about all 
customers. You have to accept that the sample estimate has a risk of being 
inaccurate.
	
Even if your sample size is small, you can still use it to make sound decisions, 
especially when you use techniques like confidence intervals.
You can measure the amount of error with a confidence interval. Confidence 
intervals tell you how much you can expect sample estimates to fluctuate 
based on sample size. They provide you with the most likely range for the 
unknown customer population numbers you’re trying to predict. The larger 
the sample size, the better the estimate is. By building a 95% confidence 
interval around a sample, you can expect that 95% of the time your interval 
will contain the actual customer population average.
	
Confidence intervals and all data you collect will only accurately predict the 
customer population if your sample is representative of the actual customer 
population. If you sell products mostly in Europe but most of your survey data 
comes from the U.S., it’s unlikely your estimates will be accurate (unless U.S. 
customers respond similarly to European customers).

Computing a 95% confidence interval
To compute a 95% confidence interval, you need three pieces of data:
	
✓	The mean (for continuous data) or proportion (for binary data)
	
✓	The standard deviation, which describes how dispersed the data is 
around the average
	
✓	The sample size
In the following sections, I show you how to calculate a confidence interval 
when you have continuous data or discrete data.
Continuous data example
Imagine you asked 50 customers how satisfied they were with their recent 
experience with your product on an 7-point scale, with 1 = Not at all satisfied 
and 7 = Extremely satisfied. These are the steps you would follow to compute 
a confidence interval around your sample average:
	
1.	Find the mean by adding up the scores for each of the 50 customers 
and divide by the total number of responses (which is 50).
	
	 If you have Microsoft Excel, you can use the function =AVERAGE() for this 
step. For the purpose of this example, I have an average response of 6.
	
2.	Compute the standard deviation.
	
	 You can use the Excel formula = STDEV() for all 50 values. I have a 
sample standard deviation of 1.2.
	
3.	Compute the standard error by dividing the standard deviation by the 
square root of the sample size.
1.2 / √(50) = .17
	
4.	Compute the margin of error by multiplying the standard error by 2.
.17 x 2 = .34
	
5.	Compute the confidence interval by adding the margin of error to the 
mean from Step 1 and then subtracting the margin of error from the 
mean, like this:
6 +.34 = 6.34
6 -.34 = 5.66
	
	 You now know you have a 95% confidence interval of 5.66 to 6.34. The 
best estimate of what the entire customer population’s average satisfac-
tion is ranges between 5.66 and 6.34.

If you have a smaller sample, you need to use a multiple greater than 2. You 
can find what multiple you need with the online calculator available at www.
measuringu.com/ci-calc.php.
Discrete data example
Imagine you asked 50 customers if they are going to repurchase your service 
in the future. Using a dummy variable, you can code Yes = 1 and No = 0. If 40 
out of 50 report their intent to repurchase, you can use what is called the 
Adjusted Wald technique to find your confidence interval:
	
1.	Find the average by adding all the 1s and dividing by the number of 
responses.
40 / 50 =.8
	
2.	Adjust the proportion to make it more accurate.
	
a.	Add 2 to the numerator (the number of 1s).
  40 + 2 = 42
	
b.	Find the adjusted sample size by adding 4 to the denominator 
(total responses).
  50 + 4 = 54
	
c.	Divide the result to find the adjusted proportion.
  42 / 54 = .78
	
3.	Compute the standard error for proportion data.
	
a.	Multiply the adjusted proportion by 1 minus the adjusted proportion.
  .78 × (1 -.78)=.17
	
b.	Divide the result (.17) by the adjusted sample size from Step 2.
  .17 / 54  = .0031
	
c.	Determine the square root of the value from the preceding step.
   √.0031 = .057
	
4.	Compute the margin of error by multiplying the standard error (result 
from Step 3) by 2.
.057 × 2 = .11
	
5.	Compute the confidence interval by adding the margin of error from 
the proportion from Step 1 and subtracting the margin of error from 
the proportion.
.78 + .11 = .89
.78 - .11 = .67
	
	 The 95% confidence interval is .67 to .89. The best estimate of the entire 
customer population’s intent to repurchase is between 67% and 89%.

Determining What Data to Collect
The art and science of customer analytics means turning metrics into insights. 
But you need metrics to begin with. Metrics can be found all across an orga-
nization and a customer’s journey (see Chapter 7). I discuss in detail the right 
metric to collect depending on your goals and methods throughout this book. 
But first it’s a good idea to get a better understanding of problems and oppor-
tunities for your customers.
You need to collect data from each of the following four customer analytics 
data types.
	
✓	Descriptive: The descriptive data becomes the template for whom you 
measure. It includes demographic data like gender, age, geography, and 
income. It also includes self-described attitudes and preferences toward 
products, categories, and technology. From this data, you can create 
meaningful segments (for example, early adopters or value-seekers) and 
personas (see Chapter 5).
	
	You can collect this data from purchases, registrations, surveys, inter-
views, and contextual inquiries.
	
✓	Behavioral: The behavioral data becomes the framework for testing 
experiences. It is the general pattern customers exhibit when using your 
products and services. It includes making purchases, registering, brows-
ing, and using different devices.
	
	For example, customers of certain product categories, like consumer 
electronics or home furniture, tend to browse products on their tablet at 
night and make purchases on their desktop during the day.
	
✓	Interaction: The interaction data becomes the task scenarios that you 
simulate and measure during a usability test (see Chapter 14). It includes 
the clicks, navigation paths, and browsing activities found on websites 
and software.
	
	The classic usability test typically focuses on this level of granularity by 
simulating real interactions. You can use real-time data from A/B testing, 
Google Analytics, and lab-based or unmoderated testing to collect data 
for this grouping (see Chapter 10).
	
✓	Attitudinal: Preference data, opinions, desirability, branding, and senti-
ments are usually captured in surveys, focus groups, and usability tests. 
This is where questionnaires like the SUPR-Q (www.suprq.com), System 
Usability Scale (SUS; www.measuringu.com/sus.php), or the Net

Part I: Getting Started with Customer Analytics 
Promoter Score (www.netpromoter.com) quantifies how interactions 
and behaviors affect attitudes. These attitudes will then affect some self-
described descriptive attributes quantified in the descriptive grouping 
(see Chapter 9).
	
	Improvements you make that affect attitudinal data, like increased trust 
and loyalty, drive further buying behavior.
Managing the Right Measure
If you can’t measure the customer experience, you can’t manage it. Improving the 
customer experience starts with measuring. But you must be sure you’re getting 
the right measure (or usually measures) to manage. The right measure(s) will:
	
✓	Identify problem areas
	
✓	Track improvements over time
	
✓	Be meaningful to the customer
The wrong measure(s) can:
	
✓	Identify wrong areas of focus
	
✓	Miss problems all together
	
✓	Lead to unintended consequences
	
✓	Alienate customers
Here are some different ways of thinking about measuring experiences:
	
✓	Conversion rate versus number of conversions: Conversion rates are 
the central metric for testing better designs, ads, and campaign effec-
tiveness (covered in Chapter 10). The ratio of total users who purchase, 
register, or click (convert) to all users who viewed the page is an effec-
tive ratio because you can compare low traffic and high traffic pages.
	
	While this is a convenient metric, the total number of conversions likely 
has a bigger impact on your bottom line than the rate. Wouldn’t you 
rather have 100 conversions from 100,000 page views than 10 conver-
sions from 100 page views?
	
✓	Number of clicks versus time to destination: When you’re trying to 
make a more efficient experience, reducing the number of clicks to 
accomplish a goal seems like a good way to measure. Putting all func-
tionality and content on one page would certainly reduce the number of 
clicks, but that probably is not what your customers have in mind.

 Chapter 2: Embracing the Science and Art of Metrics
	
	Too much functionality or content on one page makes for an overwhelm-
ing experience; just make sure the paths customers need to complete a 
task are clear (see Chapter 15).
	
✓	Call time or call satisfactorily resolved: Wonder why those often scorned 
customer service agents you call to complain to speak so quickly? If you 
want to reduce call time in a customer support center, you can instruct 
agents to get off the phone faster, but have you really increased service or 
quality if customers have to call back?
	
	Often a simple follow-up question sent via email can solve this problem.
	
✓	Customer satisfaction as a bonus motivator: Many companies pay bonuses 
based on achieving and exceeding certain customer satisfaction goals. 
Unfortunately and not surprisingly, this can lead employees to improve 
their chances for getting the bonuses in ways that make measures less 
meaningful.
	
✓	Likelihood to recommend or likelihood to repurchase: With the popu-
larity of the Net Promoter Score (see Chapter 12), it may seem like word 
of mouth is the only measure you should care about. But if everyone 
already knows about and owns your product or visits your website, like-
lihood to purchase again might be a better measure of growth.
	
	For measuring customer loyalty, I recommend using both repurchase 
rates and likelihood to recommend. This provides a mix of both behav-
ior and attitude.
	
✓	On-time arrival versus on-time departure: Have you ever been on a plane 
that pulled away from the Jetway only for it to sit on the tarmac waiting 
for mechanical issues or other delays? You then arrive at your destination 
late? It’s likely that the flight segment still counted as an on-time depar-
ture. You can’t argue with the measure: The plane did pull away from the 
Jetway on time and that does mean something. However, that action just 
doesn’t mean that much to the customer sitting in the idled plane.
	
Measuring is good. Knowing what to measure is better. Finding the right measure 
means taking multiple measures and seeing which one best tracks customer 
sentiments and revenue.

Planning a Customer Analytics 
Initiative
In This Chapter
▶	Outlining the scope and goals of an analytics initiative
▶	Choosing metrics, methods, and tools
▶	Setting budgets and sample sizes
L
 
aunching a customer analytics initiative can be confusing on where to 
start and which method to use when. In this chapter, I review the best 
practices for defining, collecting, and analyzing your customer analytics to 
help make better decisions from your customer data.
There are a number of ways of thinking about goals, methods, and outcomes. 
Your organization may already have a project scoping process that you can 
adapt for your customer analytics initiative. In this chapter, I use an approach 
based loosely on the Six Sigma methodology, tailored to customer analytics. 
It’s a framework that’s flexible and familiar and works across disparate prod-
ucts and companies.
The basic framework is to define what you want to do, find the right ways to 
measure it, do something about the measures, and put processes in place to 
continue using customer analytics to make better business decisions.
A Customer Analytics Initiative Overview
Before you start on your initiative, keep these four things in mind:
	
✓	Access to the right data: It’s hard to increase the frequency of customer 
purchases, conversions, or attitudes if you don’t know what customers 
are purchasing, when they are purchasing it, or what they are thinking. 
Be sure you know that the data you need exists, or that you’ll be able to 
collect and analyze it.

Part I: Getting Started with Customer Analytics 
	
✓	Customer level data: To do the most with customer analytics, you’ll 
want to gather data for each customer, not aggregated data at product 
or company levels.
	
	Because customer analytics is about understanding the customer from 
past data to predict future data, you need to identify transactions, rev-
enue, and survey data for each customer. You can then roll this lower 
level customer data up to product or company level summaries as 
needed.
	
✓	Analytics that focus on the customer: The “right” analytics depend 
on the method. But one thing that all good customer analytics have in 
common is that they are meaningful to the customer. Just like airlines 
should care more about on-time arrivals than on-time departures, your 
analytics should be felt by customers at all phases of their journey.
	
	If you want to improve the customer support experience, customer 
satisfaction with the call outcome is a better metric than the number of 
calls answered in an hour. The latter is an example of company centric 
and the former is customer centric.
	
✓	Getting buy-in: Planning, collecting, and analyzing data is only good if 
something is going to be done about the insights.
	
	All too often, I see organizations spend a lot on research and customer 
measurement projects but the results stop at the executive presentation 
meeting. Unfortunately, insights aren’t acted upon because the people 
who can change the product, price, or experience aren’t involved with 
the data collection and planning. They are naturally resistant to outsid-
ers telling them what to do. This can happen with both internally and 
externally collected data. Get buy-in from the people you need to imple-
ment your insights and minimize the “not invented here” attitude.
	
	Customer analytics should be shared with not only executives, but also 
with product development, sales, and support staffers. As part of the 
planning and getting buy-in, be sure the analytics will cross customer 
touchpoints and be accessible across the organization.
	
Not all customer analytics initiatives lend themselves well to the more system-
atic methodology I include here. So don’t try to force extra steps or complex-
ity just to meet this framework.
A lot of creative thinking goes into making a plan. Don’t feel like you need to 
fit every project into this process. That’s especially the case if your goals and 
methods are narrow in scope. The rest of this chapter covers the details of 
putting together your customer analytics initiative.

 Chapter 3: Planning a Customer Analytics Initiative
Defining the Scope and Outcome
The first stage is goal setting: where you define the scope and outcome of 
your project.
	
Don’t overlook or rush through this stage. Collecting customer analytics takes 
time and money. You can easily exceed your budget if you compiled the wrong 
data.
	
1.	State the goals of the initiative.
	
	 Think in terms of the intended outcome (for example, an increase of 10% 
in revenue of a product line over the next year). The more specific you 
can be, the more attainable the endeavor.
	
2.	Write down the questions you want to answer.
	
	 Data is meaningless unless it’s collected for a reason. Articulate what 
business questions you’re hoping to answer. Avoid being vague and 
large in scope. Start small and specific and itemize your questions.
	
	 You want to be SMART: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and 
Timely.
	
	 Some examples of questions customer analytics can answer include:
	
•	Which product feature should I add to this product?
	
•	What is preventing customers on the website from completing a 
purchase?
	
•	What labels should I change in the website navigation?
	
•	Why are customers not recommending a product and how can 
I improve positive word of mouth?
	
•	What percent of high-income mothers are aware of the brand and 
website?
	
•	Who are the most profitable customers?
	
•	How long until a customer makes a repeat purchase?
	
There’s a good chance you aren’t the first person to collect and use customer 
analytics in your organization. Look for past initiatives, past projects, and what 
worked and what didn’t work. The documents, results, and people involved in 
past initiatives will save you a lot of effort and prevent you from reinventing 
the wheel.

Identifying the Metrics, 
Methods, and Tools
During this step, identify the metrics and methods you’ll use to answer your 
questions and achieve your goals:
	
✓	Look for metrics that are meaningful to customers. Think on-time arriv-
als instead of on-time departures. See Chapter 2 for ideas on the right 
data to collect.
	
✓	Identify what tools you’ll need for data collection.
	
	Consider collecting customer data by surveying existing customers. 
Even something as simple as surveying customers requires several inputs.
Table 3-1 shows how you can go from question (from the preceding section) 
to metric to method, and finally to the right tools for the two examples of cus-
tomer loyalty (see Chapter 12) and findability (see Chapter 15).

 Chapter 3: Planning a Customer Analytics Initiative
You also need to understand your baseline scores. It’s hard to know if you’ve 
improved anything if you don’t have a baseline measure.
After surveys, customer transactions and purchase data are popular sources 
for finding baseline data. You need
	
✓	Access to customer data: This is often guarded in organizations because 
it contains both sensitive company and customer data.
	
✓	Transaction data at the right level of detail: Total revenue by product 
is often at too high a level to understand what’s driving purchases. In 
many cases, you want to obtain customer transaction data at the prod-
uct level. This way, you can understand who these customers are (demo-
graphics and so forth), when they made the purchase, for how much, 
and how often (for repeat purchases).
Some of the most important insights companies gain from their customer 
analytics comes from merging survey data with transactional data. One of the 
biggest challenges is being able to properly match customer survey results 
with past and future transactions. You may need the help of a database 
administrator or IT person to be sure you can merge survey data with trans-
actional data.
Setting a Budget
Every project requires a budget — whether it’s large or small. Consider the 
following as you prepare your project:
	
✓	Software: If you have millions of customers and as many monthly trans-
actions, you’ll benefit from sophisticated software that integrates into 
sales and accounting systems. Products offered from SAS, IBM, and 
Oracle can cost upwards of six figures to implement and service.
	
	Some of the best insights still come from simple calculations in Excel or 
a calculator. Don’t think you need to wait to get approval to purchase 
expensive software to begin making decisions from customer analytics.
	
✓	Time: You can spend a lot on the hard costs of software and services as 
well as the softer costs of employee time. Software packages that can 
fit the budget for single-person companies to the largest enterprises are 
available. Throughout this book, most methods and analysis can be con-
ducted with Excel, free web software, or options that don’t require very 
expensive software.

Part I: Getting Started with Customer Analytics 
	
While it’s easy to calculate the cost of purchasing software and services or 
hiring additional employees to handle an initiative, be sure to consider the 
cost of business as usual:
	
✓	How many customers are defecting to a competitor?
	
✓	What percent of customers are not returning?
	
✓	How many customers are discouraging others from using your product 
or service?
Determining the Correct Sample Size
If you aren’t measuring every transaction or surveying every customer, you’ll 
have to deal with the uncertainties that come with sampling a portion of your 
customer population. Even if you sample everyone, you’ll likely want to make 
estimates about future customers or future transactions, and to do so, you’ll 
still have to deal with the uncertainty.
	
In general, it costs more money and takes more time to either sample or ana-
lyze data from a large database, so you must put some thought into how large 
of a sample size you need.
Sampling over census
With faster computers and better software and 
the buzz around big data, there’s a tendency to 
want to measure every customer scenario and 
every transaction over years (like a census). 
While this will provide all the relevant data, 
many business questions can be answered 
from sampling a subset of transactions or cus-
tomers for a fraction of the cost and effort.
For example, the Internal Revenue Service 
has piles of taxpayer information contained in 
bloated documents for millions of people. It’s 
estimated that in 2012, $6.7 billion in taxes went 
uncollected from almost half a million taxpayers 
simply because the IRS couldn’t find the people 
who owed the taxes!
To find the root cause of this problem, the IRS 
reviewed a sample of that year’s reports and 
investigated what happened. The major reason 
in almost 60% of the reports was that IRS 
employees didn’t follow all the steps to locate 
people.
Using a confidence interval on this sample, 
the IRS can be 95% confident at least 54% of 
all the half-million returns would also have this 
as the main problem. (See Chapter 2 for how 
to compute confidence intervals.) A sample of 
just .01% of the data of interest can lead to the 
same insights. More importantly, something can 
be done about the findings a lot quicker.

 Chapter 3: Planning a Customer Analytics Initiative
I include ways of coming up with the right sample size for each method in 
each chapter. In general, you should consider two important concepts when 
planning your sample sizes:
	
✓	You need larger sample sizes to detect smaller differences.
	
	A new design, promotion, or feature may improve customers’ attitudes 
or sales, but if the increase is small (something like a 5% increase), 
unless your sample size is large enough, that difference won’t be distin-
guishable from random fluctuations in the data.
	
✓	For very large sample sizes, almost all differences will be statistically 
significant.
	
	Statistically significant essentially means that the differences are not 
likely due to sampling error. However, statistically significant does not 
mean the findings are noteworthy or important. Will customers notice a 
one-second reduction in the time it takes to rent a car online? Probably 
not. Although it’s a good idea to drive increases in positive attitudes 
and sales, watch out for spending a lot of effort for little return. See the 
appendix for more of a discussion of statistical significance.
Analyzing and Improving
In the analyze phase, you want to be able to describe the current state of the 
customer, often by segment (see Chapter 4), and identify the root causes of 
problems or insights to make improvements.
For example, if you’re measuring customer loyalty, you’ll have customers’ 
likelihood to recommend scores, satisfaction ratings on other parts of an 
experience, and open-ended comments. From this you can
	
✓	Compute the baseline Net Promoter Score
	
	Examine the open-ended comments for the reasons for ratings
	
✓	Conduct a key driver analysis to understand which features or attributes 
of the experience are having the biggest impact on customers’ likelihood 
to recommend
	
	See Chapter 12 for more on this approach.
Improving is often the most challenging part of any project, and that’s making 
changes to a product or process. The goal of the improving phase is to imple-
ment solutions that address the root causes of customers’ pain points.

Part I: Getting Started with Customer Analytics 
During the improving stage, you use the data collected in the measure phase to 
show quantifiable improvements (or reductions) in your metric. This can include
	
✓	Conversion rates (converting more browsers to buyers online)
	
✓	Improvements in customer attitudes
	
✓	Increases in revenue
	
✓	An increase in the number of repeat purchases
One of the worst things that happens is collecting analytics that clearly show 
a problem with the customer experience but then doing nothing about it. 
It can frustrate customers and lead to analytics initiatives that were just an 
exercise in measuring.
	
✓	For some methods, the improvement process is built into the measure step.
	
	For example, when conducting an A/B test on a website (see Chapter 10), 
the improvement has to be built so implementation is easy.
	
✓	In other cases, making changes is much harder. If you find that one of 
the primary reasons customers aren’t repurchasing or recommending 
your product or service is because of price, making changes to the price 
usually involves corporate politics, entrenched ideas, and shareholders.
Controlling the Results
A lot of effort can go into planning and collecting data. You can prevent waste 
and rework by putting in place systems to reduce the time between data col-
lection and action. Some things to consider are
	
✓	Automatic reporting: Look for ways to output key dependent variables 
to executive and team dashboards or scorecards that provide real-time 
insights into customers’ experiences.
	
✓	Access to data: It can take a long time to jump through corporate hoops 
to get access to purchase history or customer details. Have a docu-
mented process that others can follow and a way for your employees 
and data scientists to get creative with the data.
	
✓	Putting the right people and procedures in place: You don’t want to 
have an initiative that’s entirely dependent on the knowledge of one 
person. Be sure to document
	
•	Procedures for how to get access to the data
	
•	Methods that go into analyzing it
	
•	People who are responsible for the analysis and decision-making
	
•	Who is impacted by the results

 Chapter 3: Planning a Customer Analytics Initiative
A few words of caution
If you can’t measure it you can’t manage it. But 
sometimes more measurement brings more 
management. Some analytic initiatives receive 
enormous funding and also scrutiny from com-
panies. Once processes are in place for mea-
suring customer satisfaction, loyalty, repeat 
purchases, referrals, or any number of metrics, 
it seems inevitable that companies use these 
new metrics to decide on their employees’  
promotions, bonuses, pay  —  and even 
terminations.
While it’s good to have accountability toward 
customer-facing metrics, be careful about 
tying employee performance to those metrics. 
Employees will start to “game the system” by 
finding ways of inflating scores or working 
around the metrics so the numbers improve 
while the customer experience doesn’t.
To minimize the negative effects of having a 
measurement system drive undesirable behav-
ior, consider having steps in place, such as
	✓	Multiple sources of data
	✓	Third-party audits
	✓	Periodic review to see if the reward system 
is causing more harm than good for the 
employees and customers

Segmenting Customers
In This Chapter
▶	Applying the advantages of segmenting customers
▶	Following the segmentation process
▶	Transforming customer data into segments
U
 
nless you have only one customer, you’ll want to understand how your 
customers differ and how you can adapt to the differences. Customer 
segmentation is a powerful technique to focus efforts and serve customers 
better.
A customer segment is a grouping of customers that share certain character-
istics. Understanding your customers — their similarities and differences — is 
one of the most fundamental and essential steps in quantifying the custom-
ers’ relationship with your product and company. Not only does segmenting 
customers tell you how to better serve current customer demographics, but it 
also allows you to discover any unmet needs and deliver better products and 
services in the future.
In this chapter, you discover how customer segmentation can improve the 
way you do business and increase your profits. First, I discuss the advantages 
of customer segmentation. Then, I introduce you to the type of information 
you need about your customers in order to build a sound segmentation strat-
egy. Finally, you discover how to objectively segment your customers and 
determine which segments are the most profitable.
Why Segment Customers
Customer segments enable you to understand the patterns that differentiate 
your customers. However, collecting and analyzing data just to understand 
patterns and differences is not useful unless you’re going to do something 
with the information. Analyzing customer segments enables you to customize

Part II: Identifying Your Customers 
your products, services, prices, and marketing strategies to better increase 
profitability and customer satisfaction for your segment. Some of the valu-
able results of segmentation enable you to effectively:
	
✓	Identify the most and least profitable customers. All customers are not 
created equal. An examination of revenue by customer segment usually 
reveals that a minority of customer segments is responsible for the 
majority of profits. This is called the Pareto Principle.
	
	Identifying more profitable segments allows you to focus your efforts on 
keeping these customers happy while increasing their purchases. What’s 
more, segmenting can reveal underserved customers for whom specially 
designed and marketed products or services can be created.
	
✓	Improve marketing focus. Segments often have different interests, 
values, tastes, and reasons to purchase what you offer. Vastly dispa-
rate segments may not respond to the same marketing messages or 
campaigns.
	
✓	Predict future purchase patterns. Knowing that certain customers are 
more likely to purchase other products based on past purchases helps 
with planning and marketing. If you’ve ever watched a show on Netflix or 
purchased a book on Amazon, then you’ve seen the value of segmenting 
to predict and encourage future purchases.
	
	This practice is called predictive analytics.
	
✓	Build loyal relationships. Fully meeting the customers’ expectations 
through customized service and uniquely designed products at a price 
they can afford helps build customer loyalty. Loyal customers are more 
likely to do business with you again and recommend you to their friends 
and colleagues.
	
	In addition, segmentation may reveal what kinds of incentives cause 
each segment to choose your business over the competition over and 
over again.
	
✓	Price products differently. Why lose money by reducing prices if some 
customers aren’t motivated by price? By acquiring an in-depth knowl-
edge of customer motivations and gauging how much they are willing 
to spend (price sensitivity), you can develop more effective pricing 
strategies.
	
✓	Develop better products and customize products or service features. 
Segmentation provides the knowledge you need to tailor your products 
and services to maximize your profits within each segment:
	
•	Do you lose sales because your product lacks prestige for the target 
segment?
	
•	Is the product’s large number of features making its price prohibitive?

 Chapter 4: Segmenting Customers
	
•	Are customers more interested in the competition’s products because 
it has better features?
	
•	Do you need to develop a whole new line of products?
	
	Properly customizing products for each segment becomes easier as 
more understanding of the target segments is acquired.
	
✓	Create personas. A persona is a fictional person who represents the 
characteristics and goals of a customer segment. Personas are used to 
help make better product development and marketing decisions. See 
Chapter 5 for more information on creating personas.
This list is not exhaustive. The advantages of segmentation depend on the 
type of product or service you offer. Once you become more acquainted with 
the process of segmenting and researching your customers, you will find 
which ones apply to your business and possibly discover other unexpected 
advantages. For now, identifying a few objectives and positive outcomes is a 
good place to start.
	
One of the first steps to take in customer segmentation is to think about what 
makes sense for your organization. Is the gender of a customer something that 
determines what products he or she buys or is it the time of purchase? Or is 
gender just a proxy for another important variable? For example, an online 
sports website typically has men purchasing shirts and jerseys most of the 
year. During the Christmas shopping season, however, the gender balance 
shifts to women. Is that because women start appreciating sports around the 
holidays or are customers purchasing gifts for the men in their lives? Gender 
in this case is just a proxy for the time of purchase.
As another example, airlines want to segment their customers by how 
frequently they fly. A customer who flies once a year for pleasure is differ-
ent from a customer who flies over a hundred thousand miles a year for 
business. The occasional traveler spends a lot less money with the airline, 
less time on the website and with customer service, but also has different 
needs and expectations. Email marketing and promotions should be tai-
lored differently to both types of travelers. While airlines, like most com-
panies, want to retain as many customers as possible, some segments are 
more valuable in terms of annual and lifetime revenue, something I cover 
in Chapter 6.
It is helpful to decide what you want to know about your customers before 
starting. While the type of product or service determines the customer attri-
butes that are worth segmenting, there are some fundamental attributes most 
organizations should be familiar with. These are key areas on which data 
should be collected.

Tips for successful customer segmentation
Customer segmentation is more than a simple 
process. It requires a combination of facts 
and intuition to put yourself in your customers’ 
shoes. Follow these guidelines to success:
	✓	Start with the end goal in mind.
	
	 Define what you will do with the segmenta-
tion data before you begin. If your segmen-
tation goal is to increase the sales of one 
of your product’s optional features, data 
should be gathered about who buys the 
feature, which income bracket they belong 
to, and what their motivations are (low-cost 
solution or a premium high-quality option).
	✓	Be open-minded.
	
	 Patterns emerge from data analysis. It’s fine 
to have preconceived ideas about what to 
expect, but don’t let that dictate how you 
look for patterns. Let the data do the talking.
	
	 One of the goals of segmentation is to 
learn new and possibly unexpected things 
about how your customers are similar. For 
example, when my company wanted to 
understand the most important features 
to customers on a healthcare web appli-
cation, the stakeholders felt they already 
knew what those features were. However, 
the survey results from a representative set 
of customers showed the top three features 
were different from what the stakeholders 
were sure they knew.
	✓	Use existing data.
	
	 The data you need may already exist. There’s 
no need to commission an expensive survey 
if the data is already collected, say, for 
example, during the process of a sale or 
while on a call to customer service. What’s 
more, you don’t want to overburden your 
customers with questions about their details 
if you already have them. When my com-
pany wanted to know which versions of a 
software product customers were using, 
instead of asking them, we were able to find 
the information by reviewing the software 
purchase data.
	✓	Use multiple sources of data.
	
	 Try not to rely on a single source of data. 
Look at existing customer lists, surveys, and 
third-party reports.
	
	 For example, on a customer segmentation 
survey my company conducted for a soft-
ware company, we looked at the response 
rates by product lines and compared 
them to actual sales by product line. We 
ensured that the composition of custom-
ers responding to questions about their 
product usage would match the actual 
breakdown by product. Running smaller 
surveys with open-ended questions and 
conducting a few interviews can provide 
a lot of insight into what questions to ask. 
Customer surveys are usually easy to 
implement. Some companies offer perks 
such as drawings or a discount on a future 
purchase as a reward for participating in a 
survey.
	
	 When possible, use more than one source 
and plan on cross-referencing data.

 Chapter 4: Segmenting Customers
Segmenting by the Five W’s
Segmenting customers can seem daunting: Where do you start and how do 
you segment? While the answer depends on your goals and products, it can 
be helpful to think in terms of the five W’s (who, where, what, when, why, and 
how) when segmenting.
	
Okay, it’s actually five W’s and an H.
Who
At the most basic level, you should know the demographics of your custom-
ers. Characterizing customers based on demographics is the simplest and 
easiest way to start segmenting. Demographic questions are not subjective: 
They give you real, verifiable information about your customers.
The core “who” demographic subjects include:
	
✓	Gender
	
✓	Age
	
✓	Income
	
✓	Education level
	
✓	Occupation
	
✓	Marital status
	
✓	Number and ages of children
Knowing these basic demographics is interesting in itself. For example, an 
airline company interested in determining who the most frequent users of 
its company-brand credit card are may find that they are high-paid men who 
travel for business. This type of information helps with identifying effective 
sources of advertising or products that this group is more likely to purchase.
Figure 4-1 displays two core demographics, gender and age, for a photogra-
phy company. The data came from 4,000 responses to a customer survey. The 
results show an even split in gender. One consequence of this split is that 
gender-based marketing messages or targeted selling would likely exclude 
half the customer base. If the gender split was more like 80% to 20%, targeting 
one gender would likely make more sense.

Gender and 
age distribu-
tion for a

business 
from a 
survey 
of 4,000 
customers.
	
However, it’s clear from the data that around 92% of the customer base is 
between 25 and 70 with the largest age segment being baby boomers between 
the ages of 51 and 60.
When analyzing demographic customer data, one strategy is to understand 
where your customer segments are disproportionate relative to the total 
population. In comparing this age distribution to the latest U.S. Census data, 
the age groups from 25 to 60 represent a higher percentage than the general 
U.S. population. While this age range is a bit wide, it can still narrow the focus 
of marketing activities and product strategies to this age range. It may also 
suggest to the company that there is an underserved market for younger and 
older photography enthusiasts.
Where
Knowing where customers live isn’t just an exercise in placing pins on a map. 
Instead, it’s about understanding the geographic diversity or concentration 
of your customers. It helps with locating better business locations, decreas-
ing delivery time/distance, and so forth. If most of your customers live far 
away from your physical location, you may decide to open a new location 
that is closer to them.
Geographic attributes can include:
	
✓	Rural versus urban
	
✓	Domestic versus international
	
✓	City names and market size (for example, San Francisco versus St. Louis)

✓	Regions and states
	
✓	Zip codes
My company conducted a study for a U.S.-based mobile phone carrier to 
understand problems customers had when purchasing phones and paying 
bills online. As part of the study, the company wanted to understand the geo-
graphic breakdown of its online customers so it collected the zip codes of the 
participants. Figure 4-2 shows the locations of customers who participated 
in the study, which enabled the company to see the urban concentration and 
geographic diversity of the participants.

What
In thinking about the “what,” you should think about past, present, and 
future. What have customers done, what are they doing, what are they think-
ing, and what are they likely to do?
What they have done
The easiest place to start is the past. What have customers done that distin-
guishes them? If helpful, think in terms of recency, frequency, and monetary 
value (revenue and profits) for segments:
	
✓	Most recent purchase
	
✓	Total number of transactions
	
✓	Product experience
	
✓	Total revenue
	
✓	Total profit

Part II: Identifying Your Customers 
	
✓	Time spent with support
	
✓	Actual number of referred customers
From the answers to these questions, you learn how your customers inter-
acted with your business in the past, and who your best customers were. 
Comparing this data with the data from other W’s, you will be able to identify 
the characteristics of your least and most profitable customers.
For example, Figure 4-3 shows the amount of experience customers have with 
a software product used for drawing and design. The responses from almost 
2,000 customers reveal that most customers have more than ten years of 
experience using the product.
	
Figure 4-3:

a software 
product

industry.
	
As another example, the retailer L.L.Bean sends different catalogs to custom-
ers based on how recently customers have purchased, how frequently they 
purchase, and the type of products they purchase. That means your neighbor 
probably has a different L.L.Bean catalog than you do.
What they are doing
Understanding the context, goals, and motivations of customers will help you 
to identify gaps in product features and opportunities for improvement. Use 
segmenting to define key areas such as:

51
 Chapter 4: Segmenting Customers
	
✓	Motivations: Business or pleasure
	
✓	Experience level: Power versus novice user
	
✓	Goals: Perhaps looking for a lawyer versus getting answers to a legal 
question
A customer who uses only a few features of a software product has different 
needs than a “power user” who uses all the functionality. Power users may be 
more interested in new features and upgrades than the more occasional or 
novice user.
What they think
Look to identify attitudes and psychographics that differentiate the following:
	
✓	Lifestyles: Traveler versus homebody
	
✓	Values: Frugal versus spendthrift
	
✓	Technology: Early adopter versus tech laggard
	
✓	Personalities: Risk seeking versus risk averse
	
✓	Overall product satisfaction: Low versus high
	
✓	Investing habits: Active versus occasional investor
These questions are more subjective than objective, but are nonetheless fun-
damental. For example, if a majority of your customers typically wait until all 
their friends have a technology before making a purchase (tech laggard) then 
marketing that emphasizes cutting-edge technologies won’t be appealing.
What they are likely to do
You also want to think in terms of long-term relationships and the lifetime 
value of a customer. Using a combination of surveys and past behavior can 
help you estimate:
	
✓	Likelihood to recommend to friends
	
✓	Likelihood to repurchase
This helps you identify the customer segments with whom you can reason-
ably expect to benefit from long-term relationships. Identifying loyal custom-
ers is instrumental in keeping them. Offering perks such as discounts when 
using your company-brand credit card, participation in sweepstakes, or free 
products and services for their loyalty is an effective way to get customers to 
choose your company over the competition. Customer loyalty is covered in 
detail in Chapter 12.

Part II: Identifying Your Customers 
When
There are often significant differences in the types of customers you have, 
based on when you measure.
	
✓	Seasons: Christmas shopping versus ordinary time
	
✓	Weekends versus weekdays
	
✓	Life events: After a baby, marriage, or move
	
✓	Daytime versus evening
	
✓	Periodic activities: Get haircuts and buy toothpaste every five weeks
Why
The “why” is pretty obvious, isn’t it? The customer wants or needs what you 
have to offer!
As touched on in the beginning of this chapter, customer segmentation can 
help answer many business questions. Among those include:
	
✓	What are my customer segments and how are they defined?
	
✓	How many distinct groups do we serve — and how are they different?
	
✓	What customer segments deliver the most revenue and profit?
	
✓	What products and services appeal to which customer segments?
	
✓	How can I tailor communication to better address customers’ needs?
	
✓	Which consumers tend to shop/interact exclusively online and why?
	
✓	How and where should I leverage my customer loyalty program further?
How
How do customers interact with the product or service?
	
✓	Online versus in store
	
✓	Phone versus in person
	
✓	Through a reseller versus direct
Knowing how customers already interact with your business gives insight 
into what can be improved and what is already working to its full potential. 
For example, say you are trying to improve the sales of your software and 
you realize that most users buy it from a reseller. Perhaps that means that

 Chapter 4: Segmenting Customers
your website is difficult to use and so less tech-savvy people therefore turn to 
a third party. This is very valuable information and could indicate that your 
website needs improvement in order to meet the needs of your less tech-
savvy customer segment.
	
It isn’t essential to collect every one of these attributes about your customers: 
Some may not apply and some may not make a huge difference. It all depends 
on the kinds of products or services you offer and the goals you have in mind. 
Are you looking for an optimal store location to reach wealthy clientele? Focus 
on geographical and demographic questions to identify where the well-to-do 
segment of your customer base resides or shops. Use your judgment and 
knowledge of your own business to pinpoint the attributes that are the most 
meaningful to your study.
Analyzing the Data to Segment 
Your Customers
After you’ve collected the data, you can do a number of things to make your 
segmentation as realistic and objective as possible. Customer segmentation, 
especially when dealing with large volumes of data, needs to be well thought out 
and organized. Predictive analytics technology can discover automatically which 
groupings exist in customer data and find relevant patterns that are likely to be 
much more subtle, extracting much greater predictive insight than traditional 
segmentation. However, you don’t need sophisticated software to uncover the 
major customer segments. You can manage it by following these four steps.
Step 1: Tabulate your data
The first step is to organize the data in a way that is simple to analyze. It can 
be helpful to tabulate your data in a spreadsheet.
For example, the data shown in Table 4-1 is a small sample from a larger 
survey of United Airlines website customers that my company performed 
in May 2014. In this table, each row is from a different customer and each 
column contains the answers to specific questions about how each customer 
typically interacts with the United Airlines website.
	
Where possible, survey responses should be coded with simple numeric 
responses. For example, customers who have a United Airlines credit card are 
coded 1 and those who don’t have one are coded 0. For categories that have 
a natural ordering, maintain the sequence by coding categories from low to 
high or from high to low. For example, the most frequent visitors in the survey 
represented in Table 4-1 are coded with a high frequency of 1, for visiting on 
average once a day, and 5 for once in the last year (low frequency).

You can then create new variables to simplify the segments. The column 
“High frequency of website visits” is created by reducing the multiple levels 
in the “Frequency of website visits” column to just high and low frequency (a 
binary variable). Customers who visit at least a few times a week (scores of 1, 
2, or 3) are coded a 1 and those visiting less frequently (scores of 4 and 5) are 
coded a 0.
Step 2: Cross-Tabbing
Now that your data is tabulated, the next step is to refine your analysis by 
“crossing” more than one variable. Cross-tabbing helps you visualize inter-
relations between two variables by explicitly revealing that some customer 
attributes usually appear (or do not usually appear) in conjunction with 
other attributes. Table 4-2 illustrates this concept by showing the interrela-
tion between the customers’ ownership of an airline credit card and the fre-
quency of their visits to the airline website.

 Chapter 4: Segmenting Customers
Each cell in Table 4-2 contains the number of customers who fit in the cat-
egory on the top and side of the table. For example, 29 customers own an 
airline credit card and visit the airline website frequently. Next, to facilitate 
analysis, the numbers in Table 4-3 can be converted to percentages, using the 
following simple equation:
% of customers in cell = # of customers in cell* 100%
= total # of customers surveyed
Here, the total number of customers surveyed is 111. Therefore, a new table 
with percentages can be created and is easier to interpret:
Table 4-3	
Cross-Tabbing with Percentages
Low frequency of 
website visits
High frequency of 
website visits

76%
Customer does not 
own an airline credit 
card
12%
12%
24%
Total
62%
38%
100%
A lot of useful information can be drawn from Table 4-3. For example, there  
appears to be no association between owning an airline credit card and 
the frequency of website use (12% low frequency, 12% high frequency). For 
customers who do own a credit card, a counterintuitive result emerges: A 
majority of them visit the website infrequently (50% low frequency, 26% high 
frequency). This initial analysis suggests that airline credit card ownership is 
not associated with more frequent visits to the airline website.
	
This data comes from just a sample of customers. Any sample has random 
variation. To know if the difference between card ownership and website 
frequency is statistically significant (beyond what you would expect from 
random variation), you would conduct a Chi-Square Test of Independence. See 
the appendix on on how to conduct and interpret this statistical test.
	
When cross-tabbing, look to mix many of the different dimensions to find pat-
terns or valuable segments. You may uncover surprising trends and learn 
something new about your customers!

Part II: Identifying Your Customers 
Step 3: Cluster Analysis
A more advanced technique used to identify segments is based on clustering 
algorithms such as cluster analysis, factor analysis, and multiple regression 
analysis. These techniques identify statistical patterns that are hard to detect 
intuitively. You’ll want to call in the professionals to help with this because 
it involves both sophisticated software and statistical know-how. You may 
encounter some output of cluster analysis, however. There is more discus-
sion on finding similarities with customer analytics in the appendix and in 
the book Predictive Analytics for Dummies (Wiley).
A common output of a cluster analysis is a visual map (called a dendrogram) 
that shows how customers cluster based on responses to the same ques-
tions. For example, Figure 4-4 shows an example of a dendrogram for how 
customers shop for consumer electronic devices on their smartphones. 
Each line represents a particular feature that consumers find important, 
such as reading consumer reviews, or the capability to customize products 
or watch product videos. The closer the lines are, the more similar custom-
ers each feature. So customers find similar importance with features A, B 
and with features C, and D. However, features C and D aren’t closely related 
with either feature A or B as they are far apart in the dendrogram.

 Chapter 4: Segmenting Customers
Step 4: Estimate the size of each segment
When your data is organized, you can estimate how many customers are in 
a particular segment. The purpose of estimating the size of the segment is to 
understand the total percent of current customers who make up each and to 
estimate the total size of the segment for non-customers too. If the potential 
market size is large, then it presents more opportunity for growth.
To estimate the size of each segment, you need to know the total size of your 
market and some data about the appropriate segment. For example, if market-
ers at United Airlines want to calculate the size of the segment of its customers 
who frequently visit its website, United Airlines can use the following equation:
Estimated # of customers

Unless you survey every single customer, there is a sampling error with your 
percentages. The best way to understand the sampling error is to use confi-
dence intervals (as covered in Chapter 2). Confidence intervals put bound-
aries around the upper and lower percentages to understand how much 
percentages could fluctuate based on your sample. For example, if 5 out of 100 
survey respondents are over age 65, a good estimate about this segment is 5%. 
Using confidence intervals, you can be 95% confident that the actual percent-
age of all customers over age 65 is between 2% and 11%. In other words, it’s 
highly unlikely more than 11% or fewer than 2% of customers are over age 65.
To compute confidence intervals with binary data, use the free calculator online 
at http://www.measuringu.com/wald.htm. Figure 4-5 shows a screen shot 
of what you enter and the results. Enter 5 in the “Passed” box and 100 in the 
“Total Tested” box. The row labeled “Adj. Wald” provides the confidence interval.
Step 5. Estimate the value of each segment
To determine which customer segments are economically the most important 
to you, estimate the percentage of customers in a specific segment who are 
going to purchase your product within a specific time period and the amount 
of revenue you expect from each sale. Ideally, you already have good esti-
mates from the experience of operating your business and from the informa-
tion gathered in the preceding steps. The following equation can be used to 
calculate the revenues expected from a specific segment:

# of customers in the segment
x % of customers who will purchase your product
x revenue per sale of your product (in $)
= potential revenues (in $) from this segment
For example, if there are an estimated 100,000 potential customers in a seg-
ment and 5% will likely purchase a $100 product, the potential revenue is 
100,000 × .05 × 100 = $500,000.
	
Figure 4-5:

Use both the lower and upper boundaries of the confidence intervals to 
create “conservative” and “best-case” scenarios for estimating the value of a 
segment.
Using attitudinal variables like the Net Promoter Score (NPS) is useful to dif-
ferentiate between “good” and “bad” profits. The NPS is an indication of 
how likely customers are to recommend your product or service to a friend 
or coworker. The scale ranges from 0 (not at all likely to recommend) to 10 
(very likely to recommend). If a customer’s NPS is:
	
✓	9 or 10: The customer is called a promoter and is likely to talk positively 
about your product.
	
✓	7 or 8: The customer is called passive and probably will not talk posi-
tively or negatively about your product.
	
✓	Below 7: The customer is called a detractor and will likely talk negatively 
about your product.

The proportions of promoters, passives, and detractors among your custom-
ers reveal how customers and their friends and colleagues view your prod-
uct. Customers who generate a high proportion of revenue but who have a 
bad experience are more likely to say negative things and lead to decreasing 
revenue streams (bad profits). This topic is discussed in Chapter 12.
	
You can cross-tab responses to the Net Promoter question with other impor-
tant questions about future revenue and include confidence intervals. For 
example, say you want to understand how software renewal rates would 
differ based on how likely customers are to recommend a product to a friend. 
Figure 4-6 shows the percentages of customers who said they would renew 
their software licenses based on whether they were promoters, passives, or 
detractors. Only 18% of customers who are detractors are likely to renew their 
licenses. In contrast, 53% of promoters are likely to renew. The small lines that 
are placed on top of each bar in the graph are visualizations of the confidence 
interval. They tell you that between 50% and 55% of all customers who are 
promoters would renew their licenses.

Don’t try to do everything at once. Collect enough data to get a good handle 
on your customers, but don’t hesitate to go in stages. Finally, try to focus your 
efforts by having some research questions and hypotheses to answer before 
collecting data, but don’t be afraid of following the patterns that emerge from 
the analysis.

Chapter 5
Creating Customer Personas
In This Chapter
▶	Applying personas in product development
▶	Identifying sources of data to build a persona
▶	Turning data into a persona
P
 
ersonas are fictional customers based on real data obtained from cus-
tomer segmentation analyses, ethnographic research, surveys, and 
interviews.
The purpose of a persona is to better focus product development and market-
ing efforts on real customer needs and goals rather than just abstract demo-
graphics. To make personas more realistic, they get names like “Marcus” or 
“Shannon” and have pictures or can even be life-sized cardboard cutouts.
While the people and pictures can be fictional, the details should be factual: 
Their goals and characteristics should represent the real needs of a larger 
group of customers.
In this chapter, I discuss the ways personas can help product development 
and marketing efforts for an organization. I walk you step by step through the 
persona creation process with examples and show you how they can answer 
important questions.
Recognizing the Importance of Personas
When you’re busy developing a product, it’s easy to start wondering what a 
hypothetical customer could want to do and build in new features to support 
these possible scenarios.
I’ve worked with many development teams building consumer and busi-
ness software products. Product managers and developers spend lots of 
time discussing all sorts of scenarios. That’s part of product development:

Part II: Identifying Your Customers 
understanding what customers need and meeting that need (see Chapter 9). 
However, there’s a difference between making sure a product meets core 
customer goals and getting bogged down in making sure a product can do 
everything.
	
Unusual scenarios are called edge-cases and include all the things a customer 
might do with software but probably wouldn’t do most of the time. A customer 
might want to customize the toolbar in a software program. A customer might 
want to access the command line. A customer might want to code plug-ins.
The problem with the “coulds” and “mights” is that there is an almost endless 
list of things one customer could do or might want to do with any product. 
Trying to build for every possible scenario means building a product that 
doesn’t work well for the most common scenarios customers want.
If you try to build for all users, you build for no users. A persona is intended to 
focus design thinking. If a persona named Marcus represents 70% of your cus-
tomers’ goals, behaviors, and profiles, most design questions can be answered 
by asking: Would Marcus do this? Personas are powerful if they are specific.
When you understand your customers’ motivations, expectations, and abilities, 
you have a more accurate picture that helps to design better products for them 
and how to make them choose your product over your competitors’ offerings.
Counterintuitively, precisely defining the goals, motivations, and needs of a 
narrow slice of customers and designing for them will not necessarily narrow 
your market. On the contrary, it enables you to fully focus your efforts on 
entirely satisfying these customers, gaining their loyalty, and letting them 
take care of marketing your product in the most effective way: by recom-
mending it to those around them.
Now boarding
An example of a dramatically successful 
product that was specifically designed for a 
comparatively small customer segment is the 
roller-board suitcase as featured in the book 
The Inmates Are Running the Asylum (Sams - 
Pearson Education). If you’ve been on an air-
plane in the last ten years, then you’ve seen 
these getting put in the overhead bins.
The roller-board suitcase, complete with retract-
able handle and wheels, was not originally 
designed for you and me, but for airline flight 
crews. It perfectly met their needs: It was com-
pact, simple, easy to haul around busy airports, 
and just the right size to fit a few changes of 
clothes. As a result, flight attendants were 
extremely satisfied with it and popularized 
it so much that roller-board suitcases have 
since become the norm for air travel. Personas 
can help you design such perfectly adapted 
products.

 Chapter 5: Creating Customer Personas
It’s important to create a persona that represents the primary segment of 
customers for a product. The advantages of thoroughly researched and well-
developed personas are:
	
✓	As stand-ins for real users, they guide decisions about design and 
functionality.
	
	What is Marcus going to use this product for? If Marcus’s needs and 
skill level are already defined, it is simple to figure out how to serve him 
better. Personas help prevent programmers or designers from creating 
products that would be perfect for themselves or from making guesses 
about what customers want. A persona helps keep the end user involved 
in the product development.
	
✓	They allow you to concentrate on designing for a manageable target 
who represents a larger group.
	
	Focusing on one customer segment and fully satisfying it is much more 
efficient to increase sales and profits. Trying to satisfy all your custom-
ers at once does not work.
	
✓	They give a common and consistent goal to the design and marketing 
teams.
	
	Marcus, with his particular motivations and level of proficiency with the 
product, needs to be on everyone’s mind. If everybody works to satisfy 
him, not only the design of the product but also the message sent to  
customers will be consistent and more convincing.
	
✓	Prioritizing design elements and resolving design disagreements can 
be done in an economical way.
	
	Personas are great communication tools. In explaining decisions to col-
leagues or people higher in the company hierarchy, use of personas 
helps refocus the conversation on the target customer.
	
✓	Identifying opportunities and product gaps to drive strategy becomes 
easier.
	
	Having a precise idea of the target customer, actually trying to see things 
from his point of view, is an excellent starting point for brainstorming. 
Novel feature or product ideas can emerge from this single customer-
oriented thinking.
	
✓	Designs can be continually evaluated and validated based on perso-
nas to reduce the frequency of usability testing.
	
	If the whole programming team strives to make a product designed 
for Marcus, there should be fewer surprises when conducting real-life 
testing.

Part II: Identifying Your Customers 
Working with personas
When you embark on the process of creating customer personas, multiple 
personas typically emerge as you identify various customer segments and 
use cases. The number and type of personas reflect the diversity of your cus-
tomer base.
For example, automotive websites like Cars.com, Kelley Blue Book, and 
Edmunds.com have different types of customers that research information on 
cars. Some customers are auto enthusiasts, others are parents with kids, and 
still other significant segments of the customer base are young professionals 
intimidated by the car-buying process.
One such car company created seven personas from the data it collected from 
interviews and surveys on how customers researched automotive information 
online. The company broke the seven personas into four primary and three 
secondary personas. Breaking the personas into primary and secondary groups 
helps website developers decide on the prominence of automotive informa-
tion. The primary customer segments are embodied in primary personas that 
want many details about car specifications. The designers then cater to this 
primary class of users by providing multiple views on engine, body, perfor-
mance, and feature details. However, they can’t ignore the secondary personas 
who represent another significant portion of website visitors — those who are 
intimidated or less interested in the minutiae of car specs.
In building the personas, the key characteristics identified in surveys and 
interviews that defined the persona were the type of car (new versus used) 
and the emphasis on price versus style.
One primary persona, Bill, is 34, single, and possesses strong opinions about 
car brands and style. He’s less interested in other people’s ratings and loves 
to research cars whenever he has time. His defining quote is: “I have to have 
a new car every year.” An abbreviated version of the Bill persona is shown in 
Figure 5-1.
In contrast, a secondary persona is represented by Sam (see Figure 5-2). Sam 
doesn’t like researching cars, and this is the first one she’s buying on her 
own. She’s just out of college and is looking for a good deal on a used car. She 
wants something reliable but fun. Her defining quote is: “Buying cars is intimi-
dating but I have friends I can ask.”
Having the relevant information about primary personas like Bill means the 
designers should be sure car enthusiasts can get to all the technical specs 
they want on the website. The designers balance the Bills with the Sams, who 
will visit the website to look for basic information like features and reviews.

Sam isn’t interested in technical jargon, so the designers have summary infor-
mation and graphics to denote high and low gas mileage vehicles and price, 
and display the rates prominently on the car detail page.

It’s common to use stock photography for personas (as in this chapter). While 
it’s fine to use actual customer pictures, it can be difficult based on customer 
privacy concerns. Give the persona a face, but don’t be too concerned if it’s a 
model rather than a real customer.

Part II: Identifying Your Customers 
Getting More Personal with  
Customer Data
A few simple steps are required when you need to build an effective persona.
Step 1: Collecting the appropriate data
The most important rule in building a persona is that the information you 
use for it should not be made up or based on opinion. Base your persona 
on actual data. Collecting, aggregating and analyzing customer data from 
customer databases and social media helps provide input into a data-driven 
persona process.
That said, although you want customers to like your product, the best data 
to start with is not obtained by asking your customers what they like or 
don’t like.
Personas concentrate on what a user does, what frustrates him, and what 
makes life a bit easier. A good persona is a narrative that describes a person’s 
typical day and experiences, as well as skills, attitude, background, environ-
ment, and goals. Personas identify the motivations, expectations, aspirations, 
and behaviors common to a large segment of customers.
Start with demographic data from a customer segmentation analysis: gender, 
age, industry, how frequently they use the product, and so forth. This tells 
you a lot about who your customers are; however, it rarely includes informa-
tion about motivations and goals, which are essential in building a persona.
To understand what your customers are trying to do, use the following 
methods.
Conducting a new survey
Surveys are one of the most cost-effective ways of gathering data from lots 
of customers. You can survey existing customers from customer lists or pro-
spective customers by using panel agencies that recruit qualified customers 
or prospective customers. In addition to basic demographics, ask questions 
about motivations, goals, and challenges.
	
See Chapter 13 for ideas on conducting a top-tasks analysis that gets to the 
primary things customers really want to do with your product.

 Chapter 5: Creating Customer Personas
Interviewing customers
Interview customers to get a better understanding of motivations, goals, and 
challenges. You can conduct the interviews in person or over the phone.
	
Don’t cold call customers. When collecting customer information, be sure a 
customer opts-in to being contacted. Allow customers to opt-out of being con-
tacted again if they wish.
	
Avoid focus groups if possible. Unless your product or service is used by 
groups of people at the same time, conduct one-on-one interviews. Group ses-
sions can easily be influenced by personalities and are often best for generat-
ing new ideas to test later. In the interviews, have customers talk about their 
problems, frustrations, and goals.
Observing
Watch users as they use your product, a competitor’s product, or just try 
and solve problems on their own. This is often referred to as ethnographic 
research or field studies. In observing, you can see things that are hard for 
customers to articulate.
For example, while I worked at Intuit, we watched customers as they entered 
their information into point-of-sale cash registers, then exported their sales 
at the end of the day into QuickBooks. The process of exporting and import-
ing was both time consuming and error-prone. This frustrating process 
inspired the Intuit design teams to come up with ideas about how to make 
balancing the books easier.
Usability testing
Have users attempt common tasks with your product or service. Don’t ask 
users what they like or dislike; instead, watch them interact with it and look 
for pain points and opportunities to improve your offering. (See Chapter 14.)
Secondary research
If interviews cannot be conducted or surveys commissioned, partial second-
hand information can be obtained from within your company: in sales, mar-
keting, product, customer support, and tech support. While it’s not ideal to 
rely on secondhand information, personas from secondhand data are usually 
better than not building personas at all.
	
Use a mix of methods, both surveys and interviews, and minimize opinions 
and guesses. You’ll often notice a behavior in an interview or field study and 
then you can look to understand its prevalence by conducting a follow-up 
survey to a larger set of customers.

Part II: Identifying Your Customers 
	
Avoid asking for opinions and concentrate on motivators. Many times, users do 
not know exactly what they need, but they do think about what they want.
While there is an art and science to writing good survey and interview ques-
tions, in general you don’t want to lead customers down a predetermined 
path. Avoid questions that suggest an answer or have simple yes or no ques-
tions. For example, “Would you like this product to be easier to use?” is not 
the best question because in most cases customers will say yes. A better 
question would be, “If you could fix only one thing about the product, what 
would it be?”
	
Like building customer segments, just because you have data (like detailed 
demographics) doesn’t mean it will be relevant to constructing a persona.
Step 2: Dividing data
After gathering data about your customers, look for themes and patterns that 
are relevant and based on behaviors and goals. Categorize open-ended com-
ments or actions observed in field studies with other similar comments and 
actions to identify patterns. In particular, look for patterns around:
	
✓	What they expect to accomplish with your product
	
✓	How they go about achieving their goals
	
✓	What their technical background or product proficiency is
At this point, it is useful to brainstorm:
	
✓	Do you need more information?
	
✓	Can you group the data in other ways?
For example, we were conducting research on the major email providers such 
as Gmail, Yahoo!, and Hotmail. After surveying 1,000 users, we found repeti-
tive comments about how Yahoo! changed its interface too often. This would 
be a good candidate for understanding how often Yahoo! actually changes its 
interface and what type of customer is averse to the changes.
Step 3: Identifying and refining personas
From the most important groups identified in Step 2, define an initial set of 
primary personas as described in the earlier automotive website example. 
These will constitute your “set of characters” the product or marketing teams 
should focus on.

 Chapter 5: Creating Customer Personas
For each persona, create a realistic portrait.
	
✓	Create an identity with details that make the persona more real:
	
•	Name
	
•	Picture
	
•	Personal history
	
✓	Create a portrait with data that connects a persona to a customer 
segment:
	
•	Goals
	
•	Habits
	
•	Expectations
	
•	Skills
	
•	Attitudes
	
•	Motivations
	
•	Environment
	
Some personas in your set of characters are not among your target customers. 
In fact, some of them could be examples of whom you are not designing or 
marketing for.
	
Don’t overdo the persona process. Although personas provide many cost- and 
time-saving benefits, there is a diminishing return if you spend too much time 
and effort developing them. Don’t get too bogged down in documenting every 
detail or spend too much time creating bloated documents. If development 
teams and marketers are faced with too much information, it will get ignored.
Creating a good persona requires composing both qualitative and quantita-
tive research, but it should be presented in no more than about one or two 
pages. It is not a job description. Stay away from minutiae like tasks, duties, 
and responsibilities. Concentrate on skills, attitudes, motivations, environment, 
and goals.
	
Follow these guidelines as you develop a persona:
	
✓	Use multiple sources of data: Segmentation, interviews, surveys, and 
observations.
	
✓	Get buy-in: Interview stakeholders from sales, product development, 
product support, and marketing to look for agreement and insight.
	
✓	Don’t base it on one customer and his idiosyncrasies.

Part II: Identifying Your Customers 
	
✓	Distinguish types of data:
	
•	Data that connects a persona to a customer segment (for example, 
proficiency level with your software)
	
•	Data that only makes the persona more real to you (for example, his 
name is Andy MacPherson)
Creating a persona in three steps
Here’s an example of using all three steps 
to build a persona. My company helped the 
National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS) 
with the redesign of its website. As part of the 
effort, we needed to define who uses the web-
site, and then build a set of personas to help 
the new development team design for this cast 
of characters.
This figure shows an example of a persona 
called “Vanessa.” It was created as one of 
ten distinct personas representing archetypal 
members or people otherwise interacting with 
the website:
	✓	We started with demographic data obtained 
from 1,000 visitors to the current website 
collected over a two-month period.
	✓	We supplemented this demographic data 
with six stakeholder interviews to under-
stand whom NMSS was targeting and to 
ensure the new website aligned with the 
organization’s mission.
	✓	We conducted 30 in-person interviews that 
matched the customer segments identi-
fied from the surveys and stakeholder 
interviews.
	
	 During the one-hour interviews, website 
users also showed us how they use the 
current website, the type of questions they 
have, and how they go about using the 
website to answer their questions.
Observing the portrait of Vanessa reveals 
several strategies you can use to build better 
personas:
	✓	Vanessa is introduced not only by a name 
and a picture, but also by a defining quote.
	✓	Although simple and conversational, the 
main body of the text reveals important 
information: how the disease of multiple 
sclerosis concretely affects her life, her 
attitude about it, and how she interacts 
with the Society. These are real pieces of 
information gathered through research 
and interviews about a certain segment of 
people living with MS.
	✓	The text is written in the first person, like a 
testimony. This is another strategy to make 
Vanessa more true to life.
	✓	Key information, both fictional and from 
research, is emphasized on the right side.

 Chapter 5: Creating Customer Personas
Answering Questions with Personas
Personas provide details to important questions that a customer cannot 
define:
	
✓	How can you make your product easier to use?
	
✓	What is your product’s top task?
	
✓	What motivates customers to use this specific product over a 
competitor’s?
	
✓	How do you develop a successful marketing strategy for the product?
By using a persona to answer these questions, design and marketing teams 
can actually be in the user’s shoes, and can better meet a real user’s needs and 
wants. The following scenario illustrates how personas make that possible.
Will Swanson is a 52-year-old civil engineer working for a consulting firm 
involved with multiple projects in China. He travels to Beijing or Shanghai at 
least once every two months, always flying from Chicago. Additionally, once 
a year, Will and his wife (Sarah) fly to Hawaii for a week to visit his parents.

72
Part II: Identifying Your Customers 
Will routinely flies with United Airlines and usually pays for his flights online 
using his United credit card. He visits the United website about once every 
two weeks.
Laurie O’Reilly is a 30-year-old K-12 English teacher who lives in Albany, NY. 
Once a year, carrying coloring books and pencils, she flies to Florida with 
her husband (Ben) and their two young children. There, they enjoy some 
family time in the sun. Twice, Laurie found a special deal and they went to 
the Bahamas instead. Laurie has some flexibility around her traveling dates, 
which enables her to look for the best prices. She does not own an airline 
credit card, but she does buy tickets on the Internet. She does not have any 
special preferences for United Airlines; however, she visits the website about 
once every two months to check ticket prices.
Will and Laurie are very different personas; they will not answer questions 
in the same way. An example of a question could be, “What is the most 
important feature of the United Airlines website?” For Will, the website’s 
most important feature is to allow him to quickly find the exact flight that he 
needs: right time, right destination, no layover. For Laurie, the most impor-
tant feature is the ability to find the best possible deal: She is flexible with 
time and exact destination and does not mind layovers, but she wants to pay 
as little as possible. Therefore, if both of the customer segments represented 
by these personas are to be satisfied, both of these tasks need to be easy to 
perform (without getting in the way of one another).
United Airlines’ marketing team can also use Will and Laurie’s personas to 
segment the airlines’ customers and reach them in different ways. Will is 
likely to be more responsive to emails promoting special frequent flyer bene-
fits, while Laurie might appreciate time-sensitive emails from United, alerting 
her when there has been a price drop on family-friendly beach destinations, 
such as Florida or the Caribbean.
This is just a simple example of how personas enable you to efficiently and 
effectively understand, identify, and communicate what the user needs. 
Usability testing is another strategy to identify specific opportunities to 
improve, innovate on, and bridge the gaps to make sure you are delivering a 
fully functional and usable product. Usability testing is covered in detail in 
Chapter 14.
Another example of a product designed for one user that reached a surpris-
ingly wide audience is the GoPro camera prototyped and developed by surfer 
Nicholas Woodman. Woodman designed a wrist strap with an attached video 
camera to record himself surfing. He hoped to produce professional qual-
ity footage of himself while on the water. For that task, he had very specific 
needs: a camera that had a very wide viewing angle, that was waterproof, 
that could be positioned in different ways, and that was not too expensive.

 Chapter 5: Creating Customer Personas
He soon realized that he would have to design not only the wrist strap, but 
also the camera. Focusing only on his own specific needs, Nicholas Woodman 
had created a product that was perfect for millions of other amateurs like 
him. It exceeded its original market, California’s surf culture, and is now sold 
to snowboarders, skiers, social activists, and countless others all over the 
world.
While most products are not designed by the user, similar results can be 
obtained with a persona-centered perspective.

f you’ve ever signed up for a credit card that had a low introductory interest 
rate, or enjoyed a low cable subscription in the first year of signing up, then 
you’ve experienced marketing strategies informed by a company’s analysis of 
customer lifetime value (CLV).
The CLV is the total profit that an individual customer generates for your 
business over his or her lifetime. The customer lifetime is the time period 
that starts when a customer first uses your business (in person or online) 
and ends when he buys his last service or product from you. The CLV covers 
the entire relationship you have with that specific customer, or segment of 
customers.
In Chapter 4, I discuss the importance of segmenting customers. One of the 
primary reasons for segmenting customers is that not all customers generate 
the same revenue or profits for an organization. Certain segments are more 
profitable than others. Now, the next step is to understand how segments of 
customers differ in the duration of their relationship with your business. The 
CLV is intimately linked to customer loyalty (see Chapter 12). Some customer 
segments are more prone to loyalty and are therefore more likely to cultivate 
a long-term relationship with your business, thus generating more revenue 
over their lifetime. Identifying the CLV of different segments enables you to 
balance the acquisition costs of a new customer with expected long-term 
revenue. This knowledge also helps you fine-tune your marketing strategy to 
acquire more high-CLV customers.

Part II: Identifying Your Customers 
Why Your CLV Is Important
The CLV metric serves many purposes. The most obvious is that it gives you 
a good idea of how much total profit you can expect from a customer. It isn’t 
a hard science, but solid calculations based on data yield a reasonably accu-
rate estimate to work with. Knowing the total lifetime profit (or loss) created 
by a specific client can also help you determine which goods or services jus-
tify higher marketing costs or sales compensation. Moreover, calculating the 
CLV of different customer segments helps orient your marketing strategy.
Aside from gaining a holistic view of the client, CLV is a good tool for forecasting 
future sales and profits, using resources efficiently, and controlling costs. Cable 
companies are a good example of effectively utilizing the concept of CLV. The 
reason cable companies offer such low upfront fees is that they’ve calculated 
the lifetime value of their customers and therefore know they can afford to ini-
tially lose a certain amount of money in order to acquire long-term customers.
As another example, the financial services firm Charles Schwab has the 
lifetime revenue of individual customers ready for managers and employ-
ees when resolving problems customers encountered with their service. 
Employees have the ability to credit customers with free trades, and in some 
cases, even help offset the losses based on the lifetime value of a customer. 
It doesn’t make sense to haggle over $100 with a customer who has spent 
$10,000 over 10 years with the firm. This philosophy has helped make Charles 
Schwab a financial firm with one of the highest customer loyalty levels.
Using CLV to acquire customers
Knowing how long the average customer who 
initially benefits from low fees does business 
with them, organizations can determine how 
much money they can lose to acquire new cus-
tomers. Consider these examples:
	✓	Eastman Kodak which used to take a loss 
on selling its cameras because it knew 
it could make the loss up with the sales 
of film.
	✓	Razor blades are relatively cheap and, 
in some cases free, when you purchase 
them with a new shaver. It’s the years (and 
therefore, the additional money) customers 
spend buying the refill blades that allows 
for the initial low prices.
	✓	If your printer breaks, it doesn’t make sense 
to repair it. You can buy a new color printer 
for under $50 now. The reason is that the 
printer companies are willing to sell you a 
printer at a loss in order to get the years of 
ink-toner purchases.
	✓	Remember the old record/CD clubs like 
Columbia House? They’d charge a penny for 
ten CDs, because they knew they’d lock you 
in to purchasing ten overpriced ones even if 
you didn’t want them over the next year.
All of these are examples of companies calcu-
lating the lifetime value of their customers and 
basing their customer acquisition strategy on 
that piece of information.

 Chapter 6: Determining Customer Lifetime Value
A daring customer acquisition strategy like those used by cable companies 
could be a financial catastrophe without appropriate data to back it and pre-
dict customer behavior. Although the CLV concept has been around for years, 
few companies have the technology to track each customer, know the usage 
on an individual basis, and implement this metric in order to quantify behav-
ior. In the next section, I explain how to effectively calculate and use the CLV.
Applying CLV in Business
The CLV can be used to evaluate the amount of money that can reasonably be 
devoted to customer acquisition. In order for your business to be profitable 
and financially sustainable, it is essential that the CLV outweigh the customer 
acquisition costs. Otherwise, your business is bound to lose considerable 
amounts of money. If it costs $1,000 to acquire a new customer through mar-
keting, sales, and production costs, but the customer generates only $75 over 
the typical lifetime, then that’s a losing strategy.
To develop a marketing budget, you need to reflect on how much and where 
you will invest your money:
	
✓	Explore allowable acquisition cost: How much can you afford to spend 
to get a customer who will continue to return for repeat business?
	
✓	Explore investment acquisition cost: How much is it going to cost to 
acquire new customers?
	
Certain customer segments are more loyal and generate more profits than 
others over their lifetime. Focusing the customer acquisition strategy on those 
more profitable segments helps ensure that the customers you invest money 
to acquire are going to stay with you and keep generating revenue.
Calculating Lifetime Value
Calculating customer lifetime value can involve some complex math with 
many variables and equations that can be quite intimidating. There is even 
very expensive software to compute complicated CLVs for all different types 
of customers and products. Fortunately, you don’t have to be a mathemati-
cian or computer scientist to compute a basic, helpful CLV estimate.
The analysts at KISSmetrics present a simple way to calculate the CLV using 
an infographic on its website, and I summarize a similar approach here. 
Remember that the more data you can gather about your customers’ buying

habits, the more accurate your results will be. However, the method is quite 
easy and you can get a good estimate of your CLV with relatively little data. 
It’s a three-part process:
	
1.	 Estimate revenue.
	
2.	 Calculate the CLV.
	
3.	 Identify profitable customers.
Estimating revenue
I recommend this process to estimate a typical customer’s revenue:
	
1.	Calculate how much money a typical customer (or a typical customer 
from a specific segment) generates per purchase.
	
	 One way to do that is to average the revenues from several customers 
(within a segment or from your market as a whole).
	
	 For example, the typical revenue from a customer’s purchase in a sand-
wich shop can be around $8. Figure 6-1 shows fictional purchase data 
from six different customers, as well as the average.
	
Figure 6-1: 
Customer 
purchase 
data.
	
	
	 The larger the customer sample, the more precise the results are. The 
CLV can’t be more precise than the data it is calculated from. Therefore, 
look at “hard” data such as historical or current sales, to obtain accurate 
averages.
	
2.	Estimate the frequency of the customer’s purchases.
	
	 The appropriate time frame, called the purchase cycle, depends on the 
industry. A sandwich shop may find that the most relevant time frame is 
one week, and that each customer purchases about three times per week

(like some of my colleagues), as illustrated in Figure 6-2. For purchasing 
desktop and laptop computers, it’s likely two to four years, and for rental 
cars and airline tickets it may be a few times per year, depending on the 
customer segment.
	
Figure 6-2: 
Frequency 
of customer 
purchases.
	
	
3.	Calculate the revenue per customer over a certain time period.
Multiply the revenue per purchase by purchase frequency:
Revenue per purchase x Frequency of purchase = Revenue over a certain 
time period
In the sandwich shop example, the result would be expressed in dollars per 
week:
$8/purchase × 3 purchases/week = $24/week
Figure 6-3 shows the breakdown of this average for the same six customers.

Part II: Identifying Your Customers 
Calculating the CLV
The simplest way to compute the customer lifetime value is to evaluate how 
long the average customer does business with your company and to calculate 
how much revenue is generated during that period:
Revenue per purchase
x Frequency of purchase
x Customer lifetime
CLV
In the sandwich shop example, assuming that the revenue per purchase is $8, 
the frequency of purchase is three times per week, and the customer lifetime 
is 20 years, the CLV is:
$8/purchase x 3 purchases/week x 52 weeks/year x 20 years = $24,960
However, to make the result more precise, other factors should be taken into 
account if the data is available. Using the revenue generated from a customer 
will almost always overestimate the customer’s true lifetime value because 
it doesn’t factor in the costs of things like employees, building and/or equip-
ment lease, and advertising. In fact, without factoring in costs, CLV is usually 
referred to as customer lifetime revenue (CLR).
It therefore makes sense to factor in the profit margin, which is the percentage 
of the revenue left over after subtracting all the company’s expenses. A more 
realistic CLV can then be calculated using the following equation:
Revenue per purchase
x Frequency of purchase
x Customer lifetime
x Profit margin
CLV
In this example, with a 21% profit margin, the CLV becomes $5,242. Profit mar-
gins vary significantly by industry and product type. For example, General 
Electric’s lighting business has profit margins of less than 5% and its industrial 
business has margins around 15%. Computer software typically has margins 
above 70%.
	
Do the best you can to compute a realistic margin based on your business and 
products because it has a substantial effect on computing an accurate lifetime 
value calculation.

 Chapter 6: Determining Customer Lifetime Value
Two values can be used to refine your CLV calculation:
	
✓	Retention Rate: The customer retention rate is the percentage of the 
customers who repurchase over a specific period of time.
	
	As a simple example, if 800 out of 1,000 customers are still customers 
after a year, the retention rate is 80%. If you have the data, look at mul-
tiple years to generate a more accurate rate of retention.
	
✓	Discount Rate: The discount rate is an economic notion that is used to 
calculate the present value of future revenues.
	
	The basic idea is that having money today is worth more than having 
that same amount of money at some distant point in the future. Would 
you rather have $10,000 today or $10,000 in ten years?
	
	The same principle applies to company profits. Future profits are dis-
counted to account for their current value.
	
	If the lifetime of a customer is short (weeks, months, or a year or so), 
then the discount rate won’t have as much of an effect as if the lifetime 
lasts years or decades.
The CLV equation becomes more accurate if retention rate and discount rate 
are taken into account:
Revenue per purchase
x Frequency of purchase
x Customer lifetime
x Profit margin
x ( retention rate) / (1 + discount rate – retention rate)
CLV
If the retention rate is 75% and the discount rate is 10%, you obtain a CLV of 
$11,233 for the previous example. While the retention rate is always lower 
than 100% and therefore reduces the CLV, taking the value of future money into 
account using the rate of discount results in a higher yet more realistic CLV.
As with most of the customer analytics discussed in this book, the precision 
of the CLV depends on the quality of the data available and the number of 
variables that can be evaluated. However, even imperfect results can be used 
to compare different customer segments and identify the most profitable 
customers.

Part II: Identifying Your Customers 
Identifying profitable customers
Calculating the lifetime value of different customer segments enables you to 
identify the segments that are worth the investment of large acquisition costs.
To find the most profitable customers, calculate the CLV for your different cus-
tomer segments and compare with the average CLV. Differences in lifetime value 
between segments can be rather large and should help focus your customer 
acquisition strategy. It may be more expensive to gain the good customers’ loy-
alty, but in the long run, they will generate more revenue.
If, for example, the sandwich shop’s frequent customers generate about 
$3,000 more than the infrequent customers over their lifetime, then an invest-
ment of say $500 spent marketing to acquire these more frequent customers 
would pay off.
Marketing to Profitable Customers
Identifying the most profitable customer segments can be done in a sound, 
data-driven manner using the CLV. However, even increasing the number of 
your “good” customers may not be worth an expensive marketing campaign 
or costly incentives. To find out whether your efforts will pay off in the 
future, calculate your marketing campaign (or customer acquisition efforts) 
return on investment (ROI).
	
The CLV can be used to evaluate the success of a marketing campaign. Looking 
back at the money spent for customer acquisition during a certain time period 
and dividing by the number of customers acquired during that time, you obtain 
the average amount of money spent to acquire each individual new customer. 
You can then calculate the ROI of your marketing campaign to evaluate whether 
it was a financial success or failure.
To calculate the ROI of your marketing campaign to acquire new customers, 
use the following equation:
ROI = (CLV – Marketing cost per customer acquired) / Marketing cost per 
customer acquired
For example, if the sandwich shop spends $5000 on advertising and finds that 
it obtains 50 new customers, the cost to acquire a new customer is $100. The 
ROI of the advertising campaign will depend on the type of customer (fre-
quent or infrequent) that’s gained.

83
 Chapter 6: Determining Customer Lifetime Value
For example, using the CLV of $5,242 for the frequent customers from the pre-
vious example, the ROI of this campaign is:
($5,242 − $100) / $100 = $51
For every $1 spent on advertising, $51 is gained over the frequent customer 
lifetime.
However, if the advertising campaign attracts infrequent customers who may 
only purchase $6 once a month over 5 years, generating lifetime revenue of 
$360 and a CLV of $75.60 (after factoring in the profit margin of 21%). The ROI 
is then:
($75.60 − $100) / $100 = $−0.24
In other words, if the advertising campaign attracts infrequent customers, 
over a 5 year period, the campaign will result in a loss of 24 cents for every 
dollar spent. Not a good investment at all.
A negative ROI means that the marketing campaign was a money loser. CLV 
thus provides crucial information about just how much should be spent 
on a marketing campaign or how much you can afford to lose by offering 
incentives.
	
Just like acquiring new customers by creating attractive incentives and market-
ing specifically to them, increasing your existing customers’ CLV by boosting 
their satisfaction helps your business grow:
	
✓	A higher satisfaction rate increases the frequency of purchases, the 
amount of revenue generated each time, and your customer lifetime. All 
those factors contribute to a higher CLV.
	
✓	Satisfied and loyal customers are more likely to recommend your products 
or services to their friends and colleagues (see Chapter 12), thus enlarging 
your customer base.
	
✓	The cost of acquisition of new customers is often much higher than 
what needs to be spent to retain existing customers and increase their 
purchases.
	
✓	Customers who are highly satisfied provide free word-of-mouth 
marketing!

I
 
n this chapter, I discuss the importance of mapping out customer journeys 
and walk you through an example showing how to create one for your-
self. A customer journey map is a visualization of the stages customers go 
through as they become aware of, purchase, and use a product or service. It 
has clearly defined stages and details customer touchpoints and metrics that 
quantify each stage.
The goal of a customer journey map is to identify problem areas custom-
ers have while engaging a product or service and identify opportunities for 
improvement. It can also help unify often disparate and competing efforts 
within the same organization by providing different departments with a 
single document that maps the customer’s entire experience with a product 
or service.
Working with the Traditional 
Marketing Funnel
For about as long as people have been selling products, they’ve been thinking 
about where to find customers and how to reach them. The classic sales and 
marketing funnels date back to the late 1800s and provide a simple metaphor 
to think about the path a customer takes on the way to purchase. The sales

funnel in Figure 7-1 is a common example of how a funnel can map the jour-
ney a person takes from prospect to customer. It can also be used as a start-
ing point in building a journey map.
	
Figure 7-1: 
An example 
of a typical 
purchase 
funnel.
	
Funnels, like the one shown in Figure 7-1, show that people move from 
becoming aware of a product or company to becoming interested to eventu-
ally making a purchase. They provide some clear stages for understanding 
the customer journey and targeting marketing, advertising, and sales efforts 
accordingly. For example, it doesn’t make much sense to talk about pricing 
when people don’t want or haven’t heard of your product.
Just about every marketing organization has or should have a funnel. In fact, 
the funnel concept of AIDA (Awareness, Interest, Desire, and Action) was at the 
center of a famous scene with Alec Baldwin in the movie Glengarry Glenn Ross.
Organizations likely have different names for each of the stages. Table 7-1 
shows some popular examples of marketing and sales funnels your organiza-
tion might use. Despite some minor differences, funnels generally share a 
similar pattern of customer behavior:
	
1.	 Contemplate a purchase.
	
2.	 Narrow down on a choice.
	
3.	 Purchase the chosen product.
	
4.	 Experience post-purchase effects.
It’s a theme you’ll use with the customer journey map you create as well. 
Table 7-1 compares different types of marketing funnels to illustrate their 
similarities.

The marketing funnel is a linear process as the metaphor suggests. People 
start at the large end of the funnel and then make their way through the 
stages. The narrowing of the funnel conveys the smaller percentage of people 
who make their way through. Linearity in mapping the customer journey can 
be limiting because it assumes every customer starts in the same spot, pro-
ceeds through the same steps, and finishes at the same end point. You can 
overcome this challenge by incorporating loops back through earlier stages.
Another adaptation to the model, like one from McKinsey in Figure 7-2, empha-
sizes that customers’ loyalty is less of an end point, but the beginning of a 
loop where the customer goes back to the consideration phase before the next 
purchase point. This is especially the case with products and services that are 
purchased regularly, like rental cars, coffee, computers, or hotel reservations.
I always thought the funnel metaphor was a bit odd. After all, as any kinder-
gartner will tell you, everything that goes in one end of the funnel comes out 
the other. That would be like every prospect turning into a purchaser. If that 
were true, all you’d need to do is make and advertise a product and you’d be 
the next Bill Gates!
So unless you’re working for the IRS or have some sort of mandatory prod-
uct, customers will drop out of the funnel at some stage. A better metaphor 
might be the marketing filter or marketing sieve.
Despite some recent criticism of the linearity of the marketing funnel (and 
the flaw with the metaphor), the marketing funnel will probably continue 
to endure. One reason is that modifications to the model are still generally 
linear, as you see with the customer journey map.

What distinguishes a journey map?
The customer journey is a natural extension of 
the marketing funnel and shares many of the 
same components and goals. Both attempt to 
map the process a customer goes through with 
a product or service. Here are four main areas 
that differentiate a customer journey map from 
a marketing or sales funnel:
	✓	More detail: A journey map is like Google 
Earth: You can go from a 30,000 foot view to 
get high-level insights but still zoom into the 
street-level view to understand the micro-
interactions in each stage. The typical sales 
funnel focuses more on the macro view 
(say above 10,000 feet) and leaves the micro 
interactions to separate departments.
	✓	Focus on touchpoints: The moments of fric-
tion or delight where companies can dif-
ferentiate themselves are hallmarks of the 
journey map and aren’t typically addressed 
by the sales funnel. Touchpoints happen 
well before, during, and after a sale and 
across media.
	✓	More emphasis on post -purchase behav-
ior: There isn’t much direct selling going 
on when a customer is using most prod-
ucts, yet long-term usage, usability, and 
experience impacts a user’s intent to 
repurchase and recommend the product 
to his or her networks. Journey maps pro-
vide this detail to identify opportunities for 
improvement.
	✓	Not just for the sales and marketing 
teams: The customer journey may be one 
of the only documents that shows an orga-
nization how a customer interacts with it 
from beginning to end. Typically the mar-
keting and sales teams are only the ones 
that care about converting leads into 
sales, while the product team is primar-
ily concerned with fixing problems and 
adding new features. The customer jour-
ney map should, and can, act as a unifying 
document for disparate departments with 
different goals.

 Chapter 7: Mapping the Customer Journey
What Is a Customer Journey Map?
Like a marketing funnel, a customer journey map is a visualization of the 
phases a customer goes through when engaging with a product or service. 
Almost any experience can be mapped, including the following examples:
	
✓	The shopping experience at Whole Foods, from parking to unpacking
	
✓	The birthing experience: Admittance to the hospital to taking home 
baby
	
✓	New customer download experience: From software trial download to 
installation to long term customer
But unlike typical marketing funnels, a customer journey map illuminates 
stages in the journey with touchpoints. Touchpoints are moments when a cus-
tomer comes in contact with things like a website, a physical store, a support 
representative, or an advertisement. The journey map should also have some 
way of quantifying the experience for each step in the journey.

computer is shown in Figure 7-5. Notice how this journey starts before the 
customer has engaged with a company or product. You work on building this

 Chapter 7: Mapping the Customer Journey
One of the core ideas behind mapping the customer journey is that it helps 
employees understand how their role has an impact on sales and revenue, 
even if they don’t directly sell or market to customers. The map should pro-
vide ideas for stakeholders to develop ways of treating the customer more 
holistically, rather than perpetuating a fragmented experience where each 
department rules an isolated fiefdom. It’s like telling your story to one person 
on a phone call, getting transferred to someone else (of course, being placed 
on hold first, for who knows how long — ugh!), waiting for the next person 
to talk to, and then having to restate your information all over again to that 
individual!
Define the Customer Journey
Building a customer journey can sound like something akin to writing 
Homer’s Odyssey — a lengthy, complicated and time-consuming exercise. 
While it’s important to do research and include the relevant stakeholders 
when mapping a customer’s journey, it doesn’t have to be overly compli-
cated. In fact, it should be just detailed enough to communicate the stages, 
touchpoints, and influences that lead to actions.
	
Ernest Hemingway is attributed with writing a six-word story: “For Sale: baby 
shoes, never worn.” He considered it his best work. If the Nobel Prize winning 
author of The Old Man and the Sea finds such value in only six words, then 
surely a customer journey doesn’t have to be long, either. When mapping the 
customer journey, start simple and think Hemingway instead of Homer.
Finding the data
The customer journey should be based on data that describes reality, not any 
idealistic image or impression you might have. Here are approaches for gath-
ering data to build the customer journey:
	
✓	Look for existing data: Before planning an extensive research campaign, 
look for existing sources of information.
	
	Surveys, customer interviews, and call logs to customer support usually 
have great insights into what the customer experiences. When the data’s 
already collected, there’s no reason not to use it.
	
✓	Follow Me Home: One technique for conducting your own primary 
research is a technique called Follow Me Home. As the name suggests, 
you follow customer volunteers to their house or workplace and 
observe them.

	Intuit (maker of QuickBooks and TurboTax) used this extensively at one 
time. The idea is to immerse yourself into your customers’ typical lives 
to understand how they use and perceive your products and company.
	
	This is a great opportunity to get quotes and interview people face to 
face. Most importantly, it gives you an opportunity to observe what cus-
tomers do rather than rely on what customers say.
	
✓	Analytic thinking: If you have a good idea about how the process works, 
you can start by putting yourself in the customer’s shoes and walking 
through his journey.
	
	This can be an easy way to get a journey map off the ground, but be 
prepared to validate your thinking and make room for corrections. You 
don’t want the journey to be based just on what you think.
	
✓	Stakeholder interviews: Interview the sales team, the marketing team, 
accounting, a support person — anyone who has direct contact with 
customers at different stages.
	
	Look for patterns but don’t immediately dismiss one-off data points — 
look to corroborate them with later methods and data.
	
✓	Survey customers: Surveys are one of the most efficient ways for col-
lecting data from customers. Find a way to survey current, former, and 
prospective customers, and have them describe their process for decid-
ing, purchasing, and using a product.
	
	Look for patterns and consider using third-party research firms that can 
present a more objective face to customers who may engage with your 
organization and its competition.
Sketching the journey
With some data at your disposal, it’s time to sketch the journey. Start with a 
persona, or at least a specific customer segment, and then work from general 
to specific details. You can sketch out the journey using paper and pen, a 
whiteboard, or a charting program like Microsoft PowerPoint. You can follow 
along with the figures in this section by using PowerPoint.
1. Pick a persona or segment
With customers segmented by demographics and behavior, you have many of 
the important pieces of the customer journey ready. It helps to create a cus-
tomer journey map for each of your personas. In many cases, some or all of 
your personas will share similar goals, touchpoints, and journeys, so you can 
consolidate later. (See Chapter 5 for more detail on creating personas.)

 Chapter 7: Mapping the Customer Journey
Let’s start with a persona called Pragmatic Phil for a consumer electronics 
device like a laptop computer. Phil’s computer takes a long time to boot up, 
crashes frequently, and has limited memory, causing Phil to delete files to 
make room for new software. The details of Phil’s persona suggest that he’s 
value-oriented (seeks out deals) and is not a technology laggard, but doesn’t 
need cutting-edge technology, either. His goal is to have one PC that he can 
use for both work and personal use. It should be durable but also compact 
enough to take on airplanes and watch movies with his kids.
2. Determine the stages
As the name “journey” suggests, journey maps are usually constructed 
around a sequence of events that happen in a timeline. The timeline can then 
be broken into stages and then smaller steps.
	
For each stage, be sure to focus on the goals of your customers and what they 
are trying to accomplish.
If there are some existing stages from prior research, use those. It’s likely 
they’ll be similar to the five phases discussed in the sales funnels (Awareness, 
Consideration, Preference, Action and Loyalty); that’s what we’ll start with, as 
shown in Figure 7-6:
	
✓	Awareness: Phil’s computer is getting slow and he’s contemplating get-
ting a new computer or perhaps just trying to get it fixed. He talks to 
his friends about their computers and what he should do. He eventually 
decides he needs a new laptop.
	
✓	Consideration: Next Phil starts doing research to see what new laptops 
cost and what the features are. He’s price conscious but wants some-
thing that will last. At this stage, he’s researching many different product 
models.
	
✓	Preference: Phil narrows his choices down to a few brands and prod-
ucts based on research and recommendations from his friends.
	
✓	Action: Phil makes his decision to purchase a new laptop from the Dell.
com website. He receives it a few weeks later, takes it out of the box, sets 
it up, and begins to get used to the fast, new machine.
	
✓	Loyalty: Phil’s been using his Dell computer for several months. He’s 
taken it on trips, on airplanes, and back and forth from work and his 
home. There are parts of the hardware and software he likes and parts 
he wishes were better. He’s mentioned to a friend that he wishes the 
hard drive had more space and that it was lighter, but he’s already rec-
ommended it to two colleagues.

the stages 
of the 
journey.
3. Define the steps
From the research, construct a sequence of major steps the customer takes 
from awareness to post-purchase. The steps are basically more finely grained 
segments to describe the sequences through the journey. The steps often, 
but don’t always, align with the higher level stages.
Figure 7-7 shows the stages Phil goes through when considering a new laptop. 
I use a circle to differentiate the steps from the stages used in Step 2.

stages.
	
4. Identify the touchpoints
A touchpoint is a physical or digital interaction your customers experience 
during their relationship life cycle with your product or service. Here are 
some examples of common touchpoints:
	
✓	Website
	
✓	Salesperson
	
✓	Store
	
✓	TV and radio advertisements
	
✓	Search engine results
	
✓	Direct mail
	
✓	Email
	
✓	Social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook

 Chapter 7: Mapping the Customer Journey
The example PC purchasing journey identifies the touchpoints as advertise-
ments, the product/company website, and different support channels like 
chat, phone, and forums, as shown in Figure 7-8.
	
Figure 7-8: 
Touchpoints 
added to the 
customer 
journey.
	
5. Identify customer questions at each stage
During the research stage, such as when conducting the “Follow Me Home” 
technique, ask your target customers what questions they have about the 
product or service. This helps craft branding messages, opportunities for 
product improvements, and the metrics to collect to determine how well 
you’re addressing each stage. Figure 7-9 shows examples of representative 
customer quotes to capture the sentiments at each stage.
	
Figure 7-9: 
A few 
quotes can 
shed light 
on oppor-
tunities for 
improve-
ment.
	
	
It’s good practice to use the most precise metrics available to quantify an 
experience. However, a single quotation from a user will often convince and 
compel more people to action than any metric ever could. Look for represen-
tative quotations that indicate the challenges and opportunities at each stage.

6. Find the pain points
At each step, understand where the customer, or prospective customer, 
encounters barriers or friction to making a purchase.
Here are several pain points you can identify through the PC journey for Phil:
	
✓	Awareness Stage
	
•	Prospective customers aren’t aware of the company.
	
•	Prospective customers don’t know a product exists.
	
•	Prospective customers aren’t aware of their need for a product.
	
✓	Consideration
	
•	Customers misunderstand features and product offerings.
	
•	The perception of quality is low.
	
•	The perception of value is low.
	
•	Customers are unable to find information about your company/
product.
	
✓	Preference
	
•	It’s unclear what features differentiate the products.
	
•	Technical review details don’t resonate.
	
•	Competitors appear stronger.
	
✓	Action
	
•	Configuring a PC is complicated online.
	
•	It takes three to five weeks to receive the laptop.
	
•	The setup process is difficult and time-consuming.
	
✓	Loyalty
	
•	Certain software downloads corrupt the operating system.
	
•	The hard drive fills up fast.
7. Define metrics for each stage
It’s likely that your organization collects at least a few metrics already. In 
defining the metrics for each stage, look for metrics that are already being 
collected in your organization or by a third party, or attempt to collect them 
yourself. I cover metrics for the different phases of the customer journey in 
detail throughout Part III.

99
 Chapter 7: Mapping the Customer Journey
Here are some examples of metrics for the stages in the PC journey.
	
✓	Awareness Stage
	
•	Annual Computer Sales: Understand the current market of how 
many PCs are sold and the average sales amount.
	
•	Average Life Span of a Laptop Computer: Knowing the typical churn 
rate helps to anticipate the need for existing customers.
	
•	Advertising Recall: Understand if prospects recall your advertising 
message or associate your brand to features and products.
	
✓	Consideration
	
•	Product Market Share: Track which models are sold the most and 
what the trends are. This information is often publicly available for 
many industries.
	
•	Feature Affinity: Identify which features are driving sales and 
word-of-mouth.
	
✓	Preference
	
•	Brand Leaders & Laggards: Quantify how often a brand is men-
tioned relative to its competition (see Chapter 9).
	
•	Social Media: Find the number of mentions, especially positive 
ones, on social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook. Use 
a free version of a social analytics tool such as Topsy (http://
topsy.com/) or Social Mention (http://socialmention.
com/) to help you determine what customers are talking about and 
their sentiment toward your company or product.
	
✓	Action
	
•	Click-Through Rates (CTR): The percent of visitors who are clicking 
on call-to-action buttons like “buy,” “register,” or “add to cart.”
	
•	Shopping Cart Abandonment Rate: The percent of visitors who had 
items in their carts but never purchased them.
	
•	Average Time on Site: This is a measure of engagement. If users 
don’t spend much time browsing a website, there’s less opportu-
nity to connect with them and convert browsers to buyers. Time 
on site and other engagement metrics can be measured with web-
site analytics tools, including Google Analytics.

Part III: Analytics for the Customer Journey 
	
✓	Loyalty
	
•	Net Promoter Score (NPS): Asking how likely customers are to rec-
ommend a product is a good way to measure word-of-mouth. For 
details about measuring customer loyalty, see Chapter 12.
	
•	Likelihood to Repurchase: For products and services that are used 
repeatedly (for example, rental cars and hotel visits), you’ll want to 
have as many customers with a high propensity to repurchase the 
product.
8. Identify who is accountable for each stage in the journey
A final step in completing your journey map is to be sure someone is account-
able to each stage — and ideally, each step. Different disciplines, from prod-
uct development to marketing to usability, know their domain and metrics 
best. These teams will likely be familiar with relevant third-party research 
on customer habits and demographics, and know how to measure the 
touchpoints.
One of the key goals behind the journey map is to identify opportunities 
for improvement. If you find problems and have some ideas but no one is 
accountable for implementing them, then the full potential of the journey 
map won’t be realized.
9. Uncover the opportunities
One of the main goals of the journey map is to fix problems and propose solu-
tions that aren’t as readily noticeable when the journey is fragmented.
In a “Follow Me Home” conducted at Intuit (I describe this earlier in the chap-
ter), small-business owners were observed at their location of business while 
checking out customers on their point-of-sale (POS) registers. At the end of 
the day, the merchants would then export their data from the POS machine 
and import it into QuickBooks. This was a clear pain point for the customers, 
even if some didn’t directly articulate it. The design team wondered if they 
could eliminate that step and came up with QuickBooks POS — an integrated 
check-out and accounting solution. Be honest about identifying and map-
ping the pain points. From pain comes opportunity. Look at each of the pain 
points as an opportunity for innovation and improvement — not just as 
damage control.
10. Periodically validate
When you create your first journey map, you’ll likely have made some 
assumptions and worked off data that will become stale over time. Plan on 
revisiting your journey map to see what information has changed and needs 
to be updated.

101
 Chapter 7: Mapping the Customer Journey
If critical pieces of information become invalid, like shifting customer demo-
graphics or new competition, an out-of-date journey map may be worse than 
no journey map at all.
Flag areas that change frequently and be sure people who are accountable for 
the stages have a way of getting the latest data and can update the journey 
map.
Making the map more useful
Here are three important guidelines to make your journey map more useful 
and effective.
	
✓	Make the journey map interactive: As more work goes into a journey 
map, it will inevitably get bigger and packed full of information. Trying 
to fit all that on one flat page may get unwieldy.
	
	Consider having an HTML version of your journey map that allows your 
organization to drill into the stages. Some organizations even connect 
their internal sales and metrics systems right into the stages of their 
journey maps.
	
✓	Make it interesting: You don’t have to stick with the typical flow-chart 
shapes of circles and squares.
	
	If you need inspiration, look at a subway map with symbols and how a 
lot of information can be conveyed in a dense graphic.
	
✓	You don’t have to include everything: The more dimensions you add, 
the more complex the journey map becomes. For some phases, you’ll 
need to drill down to many details, such as in the online purchase 
process.
	
	It may make more sense to include these details on an auxiliary map 
(hyperlinked from an electronic version) that allows the organization to 
access it without getting bogged down in the details.

Determining Brand Awareness 
and Attitudes
	
▶	 Valuing brand awareness and attitudes
	
▶	 Measuring brand awareness
	
▶	 Asking aided and unaided branding questions
W
 
hen marketers talk about brands, familiar companies and products 
come to mind — think Coca-Cola, Nike, BMW, or Rolex. But think 
about the last time you purchased something in a category about which you 
were unfamiliar with the brands — perhaps ceiling fans, windshield wipers, 
or website hosts.
All things being equal, consumers prefer brands they know rather than 
brands they have not heard of.
Customers generally progress through stages of the hierarchy of effects: 
They become familiar with a brand, form an attitude about the brand through 
repeated usage, and finally, become loyal to that brand. (It’s part of the cus-
tomer journey; if you’re unfamiliar with the customer journey, see Chapter 7.)
The hierarchy of effects provides a framework for you to measure. Customers’ 
attitudes toward brands and products are constantly changing. In this chapter, 
I show you how to measure brand awareness, attitudes, and experiences.
Measuring Brand Awareness
You measure brand awareness using two approaches:
	
✓	Unaided awareness: Asking customers what their favorite brands are
	
✓	Aided awareness: Asking customers to rank brands from a list that you 
provide
www.it-ebooks.info

104
Part III: Analytics for the Customer Journey 
	
You can ask aided and unaided brand questions in the same survey to current 
or prospective customers. When you do, ask the unaided questions first to 
minimize the suggestion bias and to discover which brands are top of mind. 
Then ask the aided branded questions by listing relevant brands and include 
an “Other” option so participants can provide any brands you might not have 
considered competition.
Unaided awareness
The best way to measure unaided brand awareness is to ask customers 
which brands come to mind when thinking about a particular product or ser-
vice. Here are some examples:
	
✓	List mobile phone manufacturers.
	
✓	List three makes and models of family sedans.
	
✓	Name four rental car companies.
Keep your unaided awareness questions open ended so customers provide 
written responses. Categorize each response and then compute the frequency 
of each response. This number can constitute a benchmark from which you 
measure future improvements.
	
Finding a benchmark is helpful before key events, such as an advertising cam-
paign or prior to a new product introduction. It also provides an idea about 
the competitive landscape by providing a relative rank of where your product 
falls relative to the others that participants mention.
Count the number of participants who mention a brand and convert that 
total to a percentage; then put confidence intervals around the percentage. 
(See Chapter 2 for a reminder on how to use confidence intervals). The confi-
dence intervals provide the best estimate for how aware all prospective cus-
tomers are about a brand from the sample of customers.
For example, in a survey of brand awareness for computers, 120 prospec-
tive customers were asked to list the brands they’d consider if they were to 
purchase a new laptop in the next six months. In total, participants listed 
ten brands; 60% of respondents mentioned Apple and 20% listed Sony (see 
Figure 8-1). According to the results, although Apple clearly has more top-
of-mind share than Sony, this data suggests that sales can be increased by 
increasing prospective laptop buyers’ awareness of Sony’s laptop products. 
The confidence intervals indicate how much the mind share would change 
if more customers were sampled (these are shown as the small black lines 
in Figure 8-1). The lower and upper bounds of the Sony unaided awareness

 Chapter 8: Determining Brand Awareness and Attitudes
are 14% and 28%, respectively. This means we can be 95% confident that at 
least 14% and no more than 28% of prospective customers have Sony in mind 
when considering laptop purchases.
	
Figure 8-1: 
More con-
sumers men-
tion Apple 
over Sony.
	
Aided awareness
With aided awareness, you provide a list of brands to the customers and ask 
them to identify which ones they are familiar with. Your aided awareness 
questions are multiple-select questions, meaning customers can select as 
many companies or products that they recognize. For example:
Which of the following laptop manufacturers are you familiar with (select 
all that apply)?
Samsung
Acer
Dell
Gateway
Apple
Lenovo
Toshiba
Sony
Prionsonic
Zenith

106
Part III: Analytics for the Customer Journey 
	
Aided awareness questions are less of an indication of top-of-mind awareness 
and more a measure of familiarity. Similar to a multiple-choice test, the mere 
suggestion of a brand may lead customers to select brands they aren’t familiar 
with.
	
To get an idea about how suggesting brands may unintentionally prompt your 
customers, include some “distractor” brands to see which percentage of cus-
tomer select it. For example, in the list of laptops from earlier, Prionsonic is 
fake and Zenith doesn’t make laptops. You can use the percentage of custom-
ers who select these distractor brands as a way to gauge how reliable your 
aided brand results are.
Measuring product or service knowledge
Having awareness with a brand is one level of familiarity. But most brands 
have a range of products and services. For example, Apple has iTunes, iPad, 
and iCloud. Google has Gmail, Drive, and Search. Customers may be more or 
less familiar with different products, and it’s often helpful to dig deeper into 
both product familiarity and knowledge.
You can better understand how effective your advertising campaigns are, and 
which channels (mobile, website, or TV, for example) are most effective when 
you follow up your unaided and aided awareness questions with specific 
questions about how participants heard about your specific brand. You can 
then attribute a higher or lower brand awareness to different campaigns. For 
Intel brand and product awareness
Intel wanted to determine how well consum-
ers understood its class of laptops called 
Ultrabooks — lightweight laptops with solid-
state hard drives and premium features.
The study involved asking unaided, and then 
aided, questions about features. Via an open-
ended Comment box, participants were asked 
what they thought an Ultrabook was:
	✓	Customers used phrases like “A very thin 
laptop” and “A laptop with superior fea-
tures.” Both responses exhibited knowl-
edge about the new product category.
	✓	Other comments, however, illustrated 
confusion  — for example, “It’s a laptop 
without any added features.”
Then survey participants were asked to select 
from a number of alternatives features that 
defined Ultrabooks, such as solid-state hard-
drives, to assess how strong their product 
knowledge was. This information was used 
to understand how effective marketing cam-
paigns had been and identify the messages that 
needed to be reinforced on Intel’s website and 
in its TV advertisements.

107
 Chapter 8: Determining Brand Awareness and Attitudes
example, if participants report higher awareness through a Facebook ad, you 
know how effective that ad was.
	
Always measure awareness separately for different customer segments. In 
the awareness survey, have participants select which customer segment best 
describes them and then analyze the awareness separately. You may find sig-
nificant difference in awareness by geography, age, or gender, for example.
Measuring Brand Attitude
As you progress through the hierarchy of effects, it’s important to measure 
the current ideas, beliefs, and associations that customers have toward a 
brand and product. Brand attitude is both what customers think and how 
strongly they feel. They may be completely familiar with your product, but 
may have an unfavorable — or at best, neutral — attitude.
To measure brand attitude and its strength, have a representative set of pro-
spective customers rate how much they agree or disagree toward a number of 
statements that go from general to specific concepts, as shown in Figure 8-2.
Figure 8-2: 
Customers 
can rate 
specific 
features of a 
brand.
	
A rating scale with 5, 7, or 11 points is common, but if your organization uses 
another scale with a different set of points, use that.
In most branding studies, you should ask about brand favorability for the 
product and a set of competitors. For example:
On a scale from 1 to 7, how would you describe your overall attitude 
toward the following airlines?
American Airlines
Delta
United Airlines
Southwest

Part III: Analytics for the Customer Journey 
Identifying brand pillars
After asking general questions about brand satisfaction, ask specific ques-
tions about characteristics associated with the brand, product, or experi-
ence. These are typically called brand pillars (think of pillars holding up a 
house). Brand pillars are the most important attributes and principles you 
want to communicate through your brand. While these differ depending on 
the industry and brand, they usually revolve around the following traits:
	
✓	Value: How much value customers feel for the amount of money they 
spend on the products.
	
✓	Quality: How well customers think a product is built, including the type 
of materials and process.
	
✓	Trust: Do customers feel like their data is safe, or that the company will 
deliver what it says?
After participants rate their satisfaction on brand attributes, have them also 
describe, in their own words, how they arrived at their rating. This is an 
excellent opportunity to collect insights both on the key drivers of satisfac-
tion (see later in this chapter) and what you can do to improve the product 
attributes and brand perception.
Checking brand affinity
A brand affinity analysis identifies the words customers associate with your 
brand and experience. These attributes can be manipulated or neglected. It’s 
usually the job of the marketing team to work on getting the right positive 
associations with the brand.
Think of the toothpaste you use. What words come to mind? Maybe it’s some-
thing like
Good Attributes
Bad Attributes
Clean
Expensive
Fresh
Messy
White
Tastes Terrible
Healthy
Guilt
To measure what terms customers associate with your brand and product, 
use the same framework I describe throughout this chapter:
	
1.	Ask customers which words come to mind when they think of a prod-
uct or brand.
	
	 Have them list as many as they can.
www.it-ebooks.info

109
 Chapter 8: Determining Brand Awareness and Attitudes
	
2.	Count the responses to see what terms are most common.
	
3.	Provide a list of specific words you want or don’t want associated with 
a brand and have customers pick from that list.
For example, customers were presented with 24 terms — 12 positive and 
12 negative — that represented the website experience for an automotive 
information brand. Figure 8-3 shows that 59% selected “Informative,” and 
35% selected “Valuable” and “Convenient.” Fortunately, only a few partici-
pants selected negative words. However, approximately one out of every 
five customers selected “Hard to Navigate” and “Complicated.” This sug-
gests the website experience could use some improvements to make it 
easier to use.

When choosing phrases to present to customers, use terms that reflect the 
brand pillars to see how well these fundamental concepts resonate with 
customers.

Part III: Analytics for the Customer Journey 
Measuring Usage and Intent
The final stage of the hierarchy of effects is measuring usage — how much a 
customer has used the product in the past and what the customer plans to 
do in the future (intent).
Finding out past usage
You need to understand how frequently and how often customers purchase 
your products and your competitors’ products or services. This provides 
an overall view of how customers interact with each brand and how strong 
or weak the relationship is for different customer segments. For example, in 
a study of airline and travel website usage, customers who recently booked 
flights online were asked the following questions:
Which website have you used in the last year to book airfare?
How frequently per year do you book tickets for business and pleasure?
Do you belong to the airline loyalty program (for example, United 
MileagePlus or Southwest Rapid Rewards)?
Do you own a rewards credit card for the airline?
Understanding how frequently these customers and prospective customers 
interact with your products allows you to understand how usage is affected 
by brand attitude, and to some extent, brand awareness.
Measuring future intent
Measuring customer usage with a brand helps describe what’s happened 
in the past. But of equal importance is what’s likely to happen in the future. 
Asking customers or prospective customers their future intent helps provide 
information about awareness and attitude to predict future sales. Examples of 
future intent questions include the following:
If you had to make a laptop purchase today, which brand would you 
choose?
How likely are you to continue flying on American Airlines?
How likely are you to recommend Dell laptops to a friend or colleague?
Intent questions can be more sophisticated and combine brand and product 
questions with questions about pricing and features (see Chapter 13). Asking

about customers’ likelihood to recommend is such an important topic that I 
cover it in detail in Chapter 12.
Understanding the Key 
Drivers of Attitude
With all the data collected around awareness, attitude, and usage, you need 
to summarize each question type to understand the strengths and weak-
nesses of your brand or product. If your brand or product is not known, or 
only known by a small percentage of prospective consumers, then campaigns 
to increase awareness will improve customer awareness. See Marketing For 
Dummies, by Alexander Hiam (Wiley) for ideas on increasing awareness.
If your product and brand is known, you need to understand what’s driving 
high or low satisfaction ratings. While any number of variables impact cus-
tomers’ attitudes toward your brand, usually only a few variables, called key 
drivers, have a disproportionate impact on attitudes. It may be that custom-
ers find the product is too expensive for what they get (value), or perhaps 
customers find the product difficult to use.
The first way to understand the drivers is to examine the comments cus-
tomers provide in the survey (see Chapter 2 for categorizing verbatim com-
ments). Look for patterns and concrete examples about what customers do 
and don’t like.
A more sophisticated way of examining key drivers is using a statistical tech-
nique called multiple regression analysis (which I also discuss in the appendix). 
Customers’ attitudes toward brand attributes are often correlated. That is, 
customers who are satisfied with the quality of a product are often also satisfied 
with the value and overall brand. Multiple regression analysis examines the cor-
relation between the independent and dependent variables to determine which 
attributes contribute most to consumers’ overall brand attitude. Seek the help 
of a statistician to assist you with running a multiple regression analysis. See 
Chapter 9 for an example using customer satisfaction as the dependent variable 
in a key driver analysis.
Structuring a Brand Assessment Survey
This chapter covers a lot of ways to measure consumers’ ideas and beliefs 
about brands. Much of this data can be collected in the same survey, but be 
aware about how you arrange your questions. For example, by asking unaided

questions before aided questions or asking participants to list adjectives 
before you have them pick from a selection. Also use a survey program that 
has branching and logic techniques that enable you to direct participants to 
different questions depending on their previous answer. Some platforms that 
use these techniques include UserZoom, Qualtrics, and SurveyAnalytics.
Here is one structure for a branding survey that works well.
	
✓	Screening questions: Ask qualifying questions (“Have you purchased a 
car in the last 6 months?”) and key demographic questions (gender, age) 
to both screen and segment your responses. You only want qualified 
participants taking your survey.
	
✓	Unaided branding: Without prompting participants with any names, ask 
them to list products or brands that come to mind.
	
✓	Aided branding: Ask participants to select which brands they are famil-
iar with among a list of alternatives. Consider adding some distractor 
brands.
	
✓	Brand satisfaction: For brands that participants select as being familiar 
with, ask them to rate their satisfaction on a rating scale.
	
✓	Specific product knowledge: Dig deeper into the product category by 
asking participants to list the features or attributes that distinguish your 
product from the competition’s or from other categories. Start with an 
unaided question (open comments) and then move to an aided question 
(listing features to select from).
	
✓	Brand affinity: For a specific brand, have participants provide the 
words or concepts that come to mind when thinking about a brand or 
product. Start with an unaided question (open comments) and then 
move to an aided question (selecting from a set of positive and negative 
terms).
	
✓	Product satisfaction: Have participants rate how satisfied they are using 
the key attributes about a product (for example, quality, value, or features).
	
✓	Future Intent: Ask participants which product or brand they intend to 
purchase.

C
 
ustomers have a range of attitudes. But when measuring a product or 
service experience, you usually can only measure a certain number of 
attitudes, including satisfaction, usability, trust, loyalty, luxury, and delight.
In Chapter 8, I cover the hierarchy of effects, which includes awareness, atti-
tudes, and usage from a broad brand perspective. In this chapter, I focus in 
more detail on customer attitudes: customers’ ideas, sentiments, feelings, 
and beliefs toward a brand and product. I first cover the most common ways 
of measuring customer attitudes and then move on to constructing the right 
questions and scales.
Gauging Customer Satisfaction
By far the most common and fundamental measure of customer attitudes is 
customer satisfaction. Customer satisfaction is a measure of how well a prod-
uct or service experience meets customer expectations. It’s considered a 
staple of customer analytics scorecards as a barometer of how well a product 
or company is performing. You can measure satisfaction on everything from a 
brand, a product, a feature, or a website to a service experience.
Satisfaction measures how a particular customer is satisfied based on his or 
her expectations of a product or service. If you’re selling a low-priced car, a 
budget-conscious consumer will be more satisfied with it than with a luxury, 
high-end car, even though the less expensive car might not have many fea-
tures. Your customer’s main satisfaction comes from the value (price for the 
features and quality offered).

Part III: Analytics for the Customer Journey 
	
Customer satisfaction is the first step of the customer journey. It leads to cus-
tomer loyalty and recommendation. It’s therefore a good idea to have some 
measure of customer satisfaction at each point in your customer journey. This 
includes everything from the product and its features, the buying process, ser-
vice, and even how responsible you are toward your employees, shareholders, 
and the environment.
There are two levels of measuring customer satisfaction:
	
✓	General (or relational) satisfaction
	
✓	Attribute (or transactional) satisfaction
General satisfaction
Asking customers about their satisfaction toward a brand or organization 
is the broadest measure of customer satisfaction. It is often referred to as a 
relational measure because it speaks to customers’ overall relationship with 
a brand. It encompasses repeated exposure, experiences, and often repeat 
purchases.
To measure general satisfaction, ask customers to rate how satisfied they 
are with your brand or company using a rating scale. Figure 9-1 shows an 
example where participants were asked to rate their level of satisfaction with 
their bank, US Bank.
Figure 9-1: 
Ask your 
customers 
about their 
level of 
satisfaction.
Because customer satisfaction is such a fundamental measure for gaug-
ing your company’s performance with your customers, a number of firms 
offer a standardized set of satisfaction questionnaires and reports to allow 
you to compare your satisfaction scores with those of your competitors 
and industry. (This chapter outlines the benefits of using standardized 
questionnaires.)

 Chapter 9: Measuring Customer Attitudes
One of the most common industry surveys of company satisfaction is the 
American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI; theacsi.org). ACSI uses a 
standard set of questions and surveys thousands of U.S. customers each year 
on products and services they’ve used. ACSI provides a series of benchmark 
reports across dozens of industries, including those for computer hardware, 
hotels, manufacturing, pet food, and life insurance, to name a few.
The ACSI reports enable you to see how satisfied U.S. customers are with 
your company. In some cases, satisfaction benchmarks are also provided at a 
more specific product level.
	
While you should always collect your own customer satisfaction data, data 
from third parties provides a more objective view of your brand and provides 
insights into former and prospective customers as well.
Attitude versus satisfaction
Although there is a slight difference between customer attitude and customer 
satisfaction, they are highly related and tend to predict customer loyalty (see 
Chapter 12).
	
Here’s how to remember the difference:
	
✓	Potential customers have an attitude toward a brand or product they’ve 
never used.
	
✓	Actual customers rate their satisfaction after having experienced a brand 
or product.
	
Customer attitude and satisfaction are often used interchangeably in practice.
For example, customers can rate their opinions toward Apple before ever 
being a customer (attitude), their level of satisfaction with Apple after 
making a purchase (general satisfaction), their satisfaction with iTunes 
(product satisfaction), and with syncing iTunes with their iPhone (attribute 
satisfaction).
Attitude
If you’re interested in the beliefs, ideas, and opinions of prospective custom-
ers, you have to measure attitudes.
For example, prior to evaluating customers on two rental car websites, par-
ticipants were asked about their attitudes toward the most common U.S. 
rental car companies, as shown in Figure 9-2.

One benefit of checking customer attitudes at the beginning of a survey is 
that you can screen out participants who have a very strong negative attitude 
toward your brand. While you don’t want to ignore these customers — in fact, 
you’ll want to follow up with them in the future — for this survey, you want 
to hear from prospective customers who are willing to use your product or 
service.
Attribute and product satisfaction
While customer satisfaction provides a broad view of a customer’s attitude, 
you’ll also want to find out whether or not your product or service is exceed-
ing expectations.
To generate more specific and diagnostic measures of customer attitudes, ask 
about the satisfaction with features, or more specific parts of an experience. 
This is often referred to as attribute or transaction satisfaction because cus-
tomers are rating attributes (features, quality, ease of use, price) of a product 
or the most recent transaction. Examples of attribute satisfaction include
	
✓	Check-in experience
	
✓	Registering
	
✓	Download speed
	
✓	Price
	
✓	Product (for brands with multiple products)
	
✓	Website
	
✓	In-store experience
	
✓	Online purchase process
	
✓	Product usability

 Chapter 9: Measuring Customer Attitudes
To measure attribute satisfaction, use the same type of scale and questions 
as used to measure general satisfaction, but direct respondents to reflect on 
the specific attribute you’re interested in (the check-in experience, the search 
results page, the download speed).
	
In addition to collecting closed-ended rating scale data from participants, offer 
a space for customers to add a comment about their attitude. You can use 
these comments to help understand what’s driving high or low ratings. You 
can even turn these comments into quantifiable data (see Chapter 2 for how 
to do so).
Rating Usability with the 
SUS and SUPR-Q
Ease of use is usually one of the biggest differentiators in the customer expe-
rience: If people don’t find your product easy to use, they aren’t going to be 
very satisfied or loyal.
The process of measuring usability involves both observing customers using 
a product and their attitude toward it. You can get half the equation (cus-
tomer attitude) through a survey. For the other half of the equation, turn to 
Chapter 14, where I cover usability testing in detail.
To measure attitudes toward usability, ask customers to rate how satisfied 
they are with the ease of use of a product or a more specific feature or expe-
rience (attribute satisfaction), or use one of two common industry ques-
tionnaires. These two questionnaires provide a reliable measure along with 
industry benchmarks (see “Writing Effective Customer Attitude Questions,” 
later in this chapter, for tips about developing survey questions).
System Usability Scale (SUS)
The most common measure of customer attitude toward usability is the 
System Usability Scale (SUS). It was developed by John Brooke in 1986. It con-
sists of ten items that customers rate from Strongly Disagree (1) to Strongly 
Agree (5).
	
✓	I think that I would like to use this system frequently.
	
✓	I found the system unnecessarily complex.

✓	I thought the system easy to use.
	
✓	I think that I would need the support of a technical person to be able to 
use this system.
	
✓	I found the various functions in this system well integrated.
	
✓	I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system.
	
✓	I would imagine that most people would learn to use this system very 
quickly.
	
✓	I found the system very cumbersome to use.
	
✓	I felt very confident using the system.
	
✓	I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with this system.
The word “system” in the SUS is replaced with the name of the product or 
website you are testing. Figure 9-3 shows the response option format of 
the SUS.

naire.
	
To score the SUS, follow these steps:
	
1.	For odd items, subtract 1 from the user response.
	
2.	For even-numbered items, subtract the user responses from 5.
	
	 This scales all values from 0 to 4 (with 4 being the most positive 
response).
	
3.	Add up the converted responses for each user and multiply that total 
by 2.5.
	
	 This converts the range of possible values from 0 to 100 instead of from 
0 to 40.
	
4.	Average together the scores for all participants.

 Chapter 9: Measuring Customer Attitudes
For example, if a participant in a survey responds with the following 
responses to the ten SUS items, his SUS score is 72.5.
What is a good SUS score?
A major benefit of using existing scales and 
questionnaires is to compare your score to 
a meaningful comparison (as discussed in 
Chapter 2). The average SUS score from over 
500 studies is 68. That means a SUS score 
above 68 is considered above average and 
anything below 68 is below average.
The best way to interpret your score is to con-
vert it to a percentile rank through a process 
called normalizing. The following figure shows 
how the percentile ranks associate with SUS 
scores and letter grades.
This process is similar to “grading on a curve” 
based on the distribution of all scores. For 
example, a raw SUS score of 74 converts to a 
percentile rank of 70%. A SUS score of 74 has 
higher perceived usability than 74% of all prod-
ucts tested. It can be interpreted as a B-.
You’d need to score above 80.3 to get an A (the 
top 10% of scores). This is also the point where 
users are more likely to recommend the product 
to a friend. Scoring at the mean score of 68 gets 
you a C and anything below a 51 is an F (putting 
you in the bottom 15%).
The SUS is considered a technology agnos-
tic questionnaire, meaning the items aren’t 
specific to any technology or platform. You 
can ask the SUS about physical products, 
software, mobile phones, websites, and even 
interactive voice response systems. For exam-
ple, Intuit QuickBooks has a SUS score of 75 
(above average usability), whereas Adobe 
Photoshop has a SUS score of 64 (below aver-
age usability).

Standardized User Experience Percentile 
Rank Questionnaire (SUPR-Q)
For measuring customers’ attitudes toward your website quality, includ-
ing usability, use an eight-item questionnaire called the Standardized User 
Experience Percentile Rank Questionnaire (SUPR-Q www.suprq.com). The 
SUPR-Q provides a reliable and valid measure of customer’s attitude toward 
the quality of a website experience. While there are a number of variables 
that impact the quality of a website experience, previous research has iden-
tified four of the most common dimensions: usability, trust, loyalty, and 
appearance.
To administer the SUPR-Q, ask users to respond to seven of the eight items 
using a five-point Disagree to Agree scale (1 = Strongly Disagree and 5 = 
Strongly Agree). For one item (“How likely are you to recommend this web-
site to a friend or colleague?”), users respond to an 11-point scale (0 = Not at 
All Likely and 10 = Extremely Likely). The following are the eight items in the 
SUPR-Q and what they measure:
	
✓	Usability
	
•	The website is easy to use.
	
•	It is easy to navigate within the website.

 Chapter 9: Measuring Customer Attitudes
	
✓	Trust
	
•	I feel comfortable purchasing from the website.
	
•	I feel confident conducting business on the website.
	
✓	Loyalty
	
•	How likely are you to recommend this website to a friend or 
colleague?
	
•	I will likely return to the website in the future.
	
✓	Appearance
	
•	I find the website to be attractive.
	
•	The website has a clean and simple presentation.
A score is generated by taking half the score with the item with the 11-point 
scale and averaging it with the other seven items that use the 5-point scale.
Like the SUS, the SUPR-Q has a reference dataset that enables you to pur-
chase access to industry data to understand how well a website scores. If you 
have a score of 50%, your website ranks as average. A score of 25% means 
your website ranks below average, while a score of 75% ranks above average.
For example, Figure 9-4 shows the overall SUPR-Q scores for airline and air 
travel aggregator websites. The average score for this industry is 83%. United 
Airlines had a below-average score of 65% compared to Southwest’s above-
average score of 91%.

You can also find similar questionnaires that include industry data for prod-
ucts from ForeSee (ForeSee.com) and WAMMI (wammi.com).
Measuring task difficulty  
with SEQ
Sometimes you need more specific data than the SUS and SUPR-Q provide 
you about a specific product.
Ask your customers how difficult they found a task, using the Single Ease 
Question (SEQ). It’s a seven-point scale from Very Difficult (1) to Very Easy (7); 
scores above 5.1 translate into easier than average and scores below 5.1 indi-
cate harder than average. Figure 9-5 shows a sample SEQ.
Figure 9-5: 
The SEQ 
measures 
customers’ 
attitudes 
about the 
difficulty of 
an experi-
ence or 
transaction.
If you’re interested in using a SEQ, check out Chapters 14 and 15, where I dis-
cuss it more in-depth.
	
You can ask more than one question after customers attempt a task. However, 
similar questions about the perception of time, satisfaction, and confidence 
tend to correlate highly with the Single Ease Question, so typically only a bit 
more information is gained by asking more than one question. You need to 
decide if more is better — or just more.
Figure 9-6 shows the SEQ scores for making a reservation on three airline 
websites. Participants in the study found the American Airlines reservation 
process more difficult than on the United Airlines website.

Scoring Brand Affection
Emotions play an important role in how attached a customer feels toward 
a brand. While emotions are harder to quantify than other attitudes about 
experiences, there are some effective ways to measure these softer attitudes.
	
Emotions impact customer loyalty. See Chapter 12 for more about loyalty.
One way you gauge the emotional connection customers have toward your 
brand or product is to ask questions around emotional attachment.
In the Journal of Consumer Psychology, Matthew Thompson suggests measures 
of connection, affection, and passion.
Have participants rate their level of agreement to the following items on 
a seven-point scale (1 = Strongly Disagree) and (7 = Strongly Agree) to ten 
adjectives, including “attached,” “delighted,” and “affectionate.”
	
✓	Connection
	
•	Connected
	
•	Bonded
	
•	Attached

You can get two measurements from these scales:
	
✓	A specific measure for each emotional attachment: Average together 
only the items in each category. For example, if you’re interested in the 
passion category, average together the scores to Passionate, Delighted, 
and Captivated.
	
✓	Overall connection measure: Average together the scores in all 
categories.
Figure 9-7 shows the brand attachment toward airline and online travel 
websites. United Airlines customers had the lowest emotional connection 
(scoring around 4) compared with high scores for American Airlines (scoring 
around 5). The average for this group was 4.7 out of 7.

 Chapter 9: Measuring Customer Attitudes
Finding Expectations: Desirability 
and Luxury
Customer satisfaction in many respects is a measure of how well customers’ 
expectations are met.
	
If a product does what it is supposed to, for a reasonable price, and is gener-
ally easy to use, customers are generally satisfied. When you exceed custom-
ers’ expectations, they go from being satisfied to delighted. After delight 
comes desirability. Customers who are so delighted with your products or 
services will always come back to you.
Desirability
Researchers at Microsoft developed a way to test customer desirability. They 
identified a set of 118 positive and negative words that customers can select 
when describing their attitude toward a product, such as advanced, annoying, 
appealing, difficult, innovative, predictable, simplistic, useful, and valuable. Ask 
participants to select three to five adjectives they associate with a product 
or experience. Then calculate the ratio of positive (for example, appealing, 
clean) to negative words (for example, busy, dull, frustrating). There are no 
published benchmarks on the percentage of positive words or the ratio of 
negative to positive words. You’ll want to compare performance over time or 
to other comparable products. At the very least, you’ll want more positive 
than negative words.
	
You can find all the adjectives online at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Microsoft_Reaction_Card_Method_%28Desirability_Testing%29
	
Chapter 13 covers the Kano model, which is another technique to help differ-
entiate between features customers expect and those which delight them.
Luxury
Luxury products set themselves apart in the market through their capability 
to go above and beyond satisfaction — to delighting consumers. Delight is an 
emotional response, often described as a combination of surprise and joy.

Part III: Analytics for the Customer Journey 
This means that, especially in the luxury brand market, measurement tools 
need to aid in the differentiation between how consumers describe an 
experience cognitively and how they feel about it emotionally. One way of 
measuring customer attitude toward the perceived luxury is to have a set 
of representative customers rate a brand or product using a series of adjec-
tives. This is part of a questionnaire called the Brand Luxury Index (BLI). 
Figure 9-8 shows a selection of the items in the BLI. Participants mark an “x” 
on the line between the adjectives when rating the luxury of an item or expe-
rience. More information about the BLI can be found in the Journal of Brand 
Management.

Measuring Attitude Lift
One way to understand how a product or service experience impacts custom-
ers’ attitudes is to measure lift — the difference between attitudes before and 
after the experience.
Earlier in the chapter, I introduce the idea of customer attitude as a measure 
that’s appropriate for both existing and new customers. To understand how 
an experience impacts attitude, you measure your customers’ attitudes 
before they use your product and again after they use your product. The 
difference is the lift in attitude. The lift can be positive or negative, where a 
negative lift means the attitude declined after exposure.
For example, in a study of the Enterprise and Budget rental car websites, cus-
tomers were asked to rate their attitude toward each brand prior to and after 
renting a car through each website.
Figure 9-9 shows the average brand favorability of Budget increased 12% after 
participants rented a car through its website (from 4.7 to 5.3). In contrast, 
the brand favorability declined 15% for participants after renting through 
Enterprise.com (from 5.3 to 4.5). More details about this study are discussed 
in Chapter 14.

Calculate your lift measures with these steps:
	
1.	Subtract the post measure from the pre measure, then change the 
order of the numbers.
	
	 For Enterprise, this was
4.5 - 5.3 = -.8
	
2.	Divide the difference by the pre measure.
-.8 / 5.3 = -.15
	
3.	Multiple by 100 to get a percentage.
-.15 * 100 = -15% 
	
	 The result is a 15 percent decline in brand lift (a negative lift) for 
Enterprise.

Part III: Analytics for the Customer Journey 
Asking for Preferences
Customers inevitably make choices between competing brands. To under-
stand how your products stack up against each of your competitors’ prod-
ucts, have participants select which brand they prefer given a set of likely 
alternatives.
When measuring preference data, collect data on both choice and intensity. 
That is, you want to know which brand customers would pick if they had to, 
and how strongly they feel. You only need one question to get this data because 
the direction of the intensity (for or against one brand) includes the preference.
	
Collect preferences both before and after a product or service experience.
For example, in the rental car website study, 62 participants were asked to 
rate which rental car website they preferred (see Figure 9-10) after having a 
chance to rent a car through both websites.
	
Figure 9-10: 
Which site 
did custom-
ers prefer?
	
The distribution of the 62 responses is shown in the following table. For 
example, 20 participants selected seven (Strongly Preferred Budget). These 
participants showed both a preference for Budget and strong intensity 
toward it. Note that 7 other participants selected 5, meaning they preferred 
Budget, but only slightly.

 Chapter 9: Measuring Customer Attitudes
To compute the percentage of customers who preferred each brand, follow 
these three steps:
	
1.	Add all the customers who selected a 5, 6, or 7 as customers who pre-
ferred Budget (45 people).
	
	 Participants who selected 1, 2, or 3 preferred Enterprise (13 people).
	
2.	Exclude the four participants who preferred neither Enterprise nor 
Budget.
	
	 This step leaves a total of 58 participants.
	
3.	Compute the percentage preferring each brand.
	
	 45/58 = 78% prefer Budget and 13/58 = 22% prefer Enterprise.
	
4.	Test for statistical significance.
	
	 Don’t forget to calculate the error rate. You can use the online calculator 
at www.measuringu.com/onep.php. There’s less than a .01% chance 
this difference in preference is due to chance. See Figure 9-11.

of par-
ticipants

significant.
	
Repeat the same process for customers who expressed the most intensity 
toward each brand. Twenty out of 58 (34%) strongly preferred Budget com-
pared to only seven (12%) who strongly preferred Enterprise. This difference 
is also statistically significant.
Finding Your Key Drivers 
of Customer Attitudes
Having all the data on customer attitudes is one thing; you now have to take 
all that data and interpret it to know what to do in order to improve your cus-
tomer attitudes. What you need to look at are your key drivers — the features

Part III: Analytics for the Customer Journey 
and attributes of the product or experience that contribute the most to your 
brand reputation.
You can find your key drivers with two methods:
	
✓	Open-ended questions: Analyze the responses to your open-ended ques-
tions. These can give you a good idea of what customers think is most 
important.
	
	You can group these comments into categories and rank their impor-
tance by quantity.
	
	With fuzzy concepts like satisfaction, usability, and luxury, always give 
participants space to write their own comments.
	
✓	Multiple regression analysis: Multiple regression analysis examines the 
correlation between the independent and dependent variables to deter-
mine which attributes contributed most to consumers’ overall brand 
attitude. I cover multiple regression analysis in the appendix, but you 
should plan on enlisting the help of a statistician to assist you with run-
ning a multiple regression analysis.
For example, customers’ satisfaction with a web-based software product was 
measured by averaging customers’ responses to a product satisfaction ques-
tion and a loyalty question, as shown in Figure 9-12. Customer loyalty is cov-
ered in detail in Chapter 12.
Figure 9-12:

tions to 
determine 
customer 
satisfaction.
Participants also rated their level of satisfaction on 14 product attributes, 
including trust, reliability, specific technical features of the product, and 
usability.

 Chapter 9: Measuring Customer Attitudes
The results of the key driver analysis are shown in Figure 9-13. It shows only 
seven variables drive most customer satisfaction with the product. The verti-
cal axis is how important each variable is in predicting customer satisfaction. 
The numbers refer to how much each of these variables will increase cus-
tomer satisfaction. Improving customer attitude toward being “more produc-
tive” by 1 point would improve customer satisfaction by .14 point.
The horizontal axis is how satisfied customers are on the seven-point scale. 
The two biggest drivers of customer satisfaction are customers’ attitude 
toward the software helping them do their job quicker, and their perceived 
quality of the product. Both drivers have relatively low ratings (below 5 on a 
seven-point scale) and suggest that improving these two aspects of the prod-
uct would have the biggest impact on customer satisfaction.
The R-Square value describes how much the combination of independent 
variables predict the dependent variable — customer satisfaction. (See the 
appendix for more information on the R-Square value.) In this case, 55% of 
customer satisfaction is predicted using just seven variables.

Writing Effective Customer 
Attitude Questions
The process of measuring customers’ attitudes involves asking the right 
questions in the right way with the right scales. It can seem daunting, but 
here are tips to make the process easier.

132
Part III: Analytics for the Customer Journey 
	
✓	Look for existing questionnaires. While you have to create your own 
questions that are specific to your product, look for questions that exist 
in published literature. Many existing questionnaires have gone through 
a process of standardization. This includes testing the reliability (how 
stable customers respond) and validity (whether the questions actually 
measure what they are supposed to). If possible, look for existing ques-
tionnaires (like the SUPR-Q and SUS) that have benchmark data you can 
compare your score to.
	
✓	Don’t obsess over scale steps. Just pick a scale and stick with it. What 
matters, what makes a measure meaningful, is comparing the same 
responses to other products or over time.
	
	Having more scale points is generally better (for example, seven 
versus five points); this matters most when you have only one or a few 
response scales. The more responses (for example, the SUS had ten 
5-point scales), the less it matters.
	
✓	Avoid double-barrel questions. When writing questions, avoid using 
two concepts in one question (for example, “How satisfied are you with 
the price and quality of the product?”) Is the customer rating quality or 
price? While the two concepts may illicit the same response, separate 
them into two questions.
	
✓	Be concrete and specific. While general satisfaction is high level, more 
specific attribute satisfaction requires clearly stating what you want cus-
tomers to rate. Be sure customers know what feature you’re referring to, 
and avoid using jargon.
	
✓	Stay positive. Phrase questions as positives rather than negatives. 
Participants often make mistakes when responding (usually in a hurry) 
and forget to reverse score the question. For example, here is an exam-
ple of a positively worded item:
	
	This website was easy to use.
	
	And a negatively worded item:
	
	It was difficult to find what I needed on this website.
	
Pretest your questions with a small sample of participants. Look for incon-
sistent responses or ask participants if any questions confused them. If you 
plan to use a set of questions repeatedly, hire a statistician to help validate the 
phrasing and scales.

M
 
any times before customers make a purchase, they come across your 
company — they see your website, an advertisement, or read a review.
This is the awareness step. When you can get those potential customers 
interacting with your company — maybe they download a brochure from 
your website or sign up for your newsletter — those customers have moved 
into the consideration phases.
The places where potential customers interact with your company in the 
awareness and consideration steps are touchpoints (see Chapter 7). When 
you identify the touchpoints, you need to prioritize which touchpoints have 
the largest influence on your customers’ decisions. You need to understand 
how each touchpoint impacts customers’ decisions, then measure the 
strength of the impact and understand what can be improved.
Identifying the Consideration 
Touchpoints
Touchpoints are the places where customers find out about your company 
and products. (See Chapter 7.) Touchpoints can be media driven by your 
company — ads on TV, radio, or newspapers, for instance. But touchpoints 
can also be customer driven — reviews on websites and social media.

Part III: Analytics for the Customer Journey 
Before you can quantify the consideration phase, you have to know where 
customers are being influenced. To do so, you need to understand all the 
touchpoints that influence customers as they decide.
Company-driven touchpoints
Company-driven touchpoints are what you probably think of as advertising. 
It’s generally paid for by the company and includes more than ads on TV.
	
✓	Broadcast media: Television, radio, newspapers, and magazines are still 
popular touchpoints for consumer brands with big marketing budgets.
	
✓	Direct mail: Postcards, catalogs, coupons, or anything that gets sent in 
traditional snail mail.
	
✓	Email newsletters: Your inbox is probably full of email communication 
from websites and companies that you’ve purchased from or signed up 
with, or that somehow just keeps showing up.
	
✓	In person: The in-store experience or interactions at places like a 
convention.
	
✓	Company and product websites: The company website is often one of 
the only touchpoints customers see. Product web pages are often linked 
directly from ads or directly from Google searches.
Customer-driven touchpoints
Customer-driven touchpoints are typically areas you don’t have control over: 
	
✓	Friends and colleagues: Few things have a bigger influence on customer 
behavior than the opinion of a trusted friend or colleague. It’s this word-
of-mouth marketing power that lies at the heart of the Net Promoter 
Score system (see Chapter 12).
	
✓	Social media: Sites like Twitter, Pinterest, Houzz, Facebook, and LinkedIn 
are electronic extensions of word-of-mouth from friends and colleagues. 
They have a way of taking one person’s experience and making it viral — 
affecting an enormous number of potential customers with little control 
over the message or reach.
	
✓	Bloggers and influencers: The bigger the product or service, the more 
experts are writing about it, from airlines, technology, and restaurants to 
fashion.
	
✓	Consumer reviews: Potential customers rely heavily on customer 
reviews and will often use Amazon’s reviews when considering a pur-
chase (even on websites other than Amazon).

 Chapter 10: Quantifying the Consideration and Purchase Phases
Measuring the Customer-Driven 
Touchpoints
The positive or negative experiences customers share about your brand 
and product potentially reach thousands of potential and existing custom-
ers on social media sites like Twitter and Facebook. Online services such 
as Brandwatch, Netvibes, Radian6, Sysomos, and Social Mention offer a 
service to measure and report on the positive and negative sentiments. 
You can track these positive and negative sentiments over time and associ-
ate changes with advertising campaigns, new product launches, or other 
events.
Even without these services, Twitter provides basic analytics on how many 
mentions or retweets or replies a company, brand, or product receives. 
More advanced software from products like Hootsuite will also tell you 
which links people are clicking on and growth in Twitter mentions over a 
period of time.
While these companies will aggregate the data for you, you can also compute 
it yourself by monitoring your own social media streams:
	
1.	Count all the times your product or brand was mentioned.
	
	 In Twitter, for example, you can search by hashtag #, @, or the name of 
the company or product.
	
2.	Categorize the comments into positive, neutral, and negative.
	
	 Negative comments can include everything from a bad purchase experi-
ence to a high price or failed product.
	
	 For example, a positive tweet posted to Twitter for an airline might be “I 
can’t wait for @ajaxair to launch nonstop service to @curacaotravel from 
JFK. Just in time to save the summer tan #ILuvAjaxAir.”
	
	 And a negative tweet might be “Very sad @ajaxair Shifted our Xmas 
travel flight 10 hours today. Forcing $ plan changes that will cut into 
family time.”
	
3.	Compute the percentage of positive and negative sentiments by divid-
ing the number of positive by the total number of mentions.
	
	 For example, if you count 10 positive comments out of 85 neutral and 
5 negative, 10% of the total are positive mentions. Repeat this for the 
negative comments and graph the difference by week or month.

Figure 10-1 shows the proportion of positive and negative mentions of a hard-
ware manufacturer over a six-month period. In January, the ratio was even 
at 14% positive to 14% negative, then it fluctuated a bit until June, when the 
negative percentage was more than 1.5 times the positive percentage (15% 
versus 9%).
	
Figure 10-1: 
The com-
parison of 
positive and 
negative 
comments 
on Twitter.
	
You can expect the changes to fluctuate due to random chance variation, so 
include confidence intervals (or run statistical comparisons) when making 
decisions. Figure 10-2 shows the graph updated to include 90% confidence 
intervals (see Chapter 2 for more about confidence intervals). When the 
intervals overlap, you can’t be sure the difference isn’t due to chance alone 
(for example, in Jan, Feb, and March). However, in June, the confidence inter-
val error bars don’t overlap (notice the small gap), meaning the percentage of 
negative comments exceeds the percentage of positive comments.
	
It’s just as important to measure positive and negative comments via word of 
mouth. Turn to Chapter 12 to find out how to do that.

 Chapter 10: Quantifying the Consideration and Purchase Phases
Measuring the Three R’s of  
Company-Driven Touchpoints
To measure the effectiveness of company-driven touchpoints, including direct 
mail (postcards and coupons), email newsletters, TV and radio ads, and com-
pany websites, measure the three R’s: reach, resonance, and reaction.
Reach
Understand the total number of customers your advertising is reaching:
	
✓	For TV and radio, this can be estimated by market share and is usually 
provided by the media outlet or companies like Nielsen.
	
✓	For newspapers, magazines, and trade journals, this can be estimated by 
circulation rates.
	
✓	For online advertisements, use page views that are recorded using web-
site hosting log files or Google Analytics (see the section on website ana-
lytics, later in this chapter).
Resonance
It could be that prospective customers saw your ad, email, or postcard and 
even recall some of its details. It’s important to understand how well the mes-
sages are resonating. Company websites are often the most seen forms of 
communication and branding opportunities and play a major role in shaping 
the customer decisions. Most websites convey important branding messages, 
benefits, and features of purchasing a product service.
Ask a series of open- and closed-ended questions to gauge customers’ attitudes 
toward the message. See if customers can correctly list the benefits of what’s 
being offered and understand the value proposition the company is offering.
For example, I worked with the website team at PayPal after a redesign of 
its home page. The new home page introduced a major design departure by 
highlighting new offerings, as shown in Figure 10-3.

Figure 10-3:

changes

with 
customers.
To measure how the new PayPal home page design resonated with prospec-
tive and current customers, we had several participants answer questions 
about both the old and new website designs.
Reaction
After understanding how the message works, measure whether customers’ 
attitudes and behaviors changed. Use the measures of customer attitude, sat-
isfaction, and future intent to assess the reaction, as described in Chapter 9.
To measure behavior, measure customer purchases (if possible) by looking 
at revenue or the number of transactions at the stores or online (see the A/B 
discussion section later in this chapter).
Attribution modeling
To improve brand awareness, companies need 
to get the word out using marketing meth-
ods such as advertising and word of mouth. 
Advertising can be online, on television, on the 
radio, or a number of other forms.
You can better understand how effective adver-
tising campaigns are by asking participants in 
the branding survey where participants heard 
of the product or brand (on their mobile phones, 
a website, or on TV, for instance).
You can then attribute higher or lower brand 
awareness to various campaigns. For example, 
if participants report higher awareness and  
also report having seen a recent Facebook 
ad, then there’s at least a tenuous link to this 
campaign.

 Chapter 10: Quantifying the Consideration and Purchase Phases
Measuring resonance and reaction
You can test resonance and reaction before or in conjunction with a company-
driven touchpoint. For example, I worked with computer manufacturer Lenovo 
to understand the resonance and reaction for its new convertible laptop adver-
tisement. It was a new concept and the advertisement would cover TV and the 
web, so we wanted to see how well it resonated with customers, and how it 
impacted their attitudes and their potential reaction (to purchase). We used 
this process to measure resonance and reaction, and you can too:
	
1.	Measure existing attitudes, such as brand favorability or purchase 
intent, before showing a stimulus such as an advertisement or 
newsletter.
	
2.	Show the stimulus (the advertisement or newsletter).
	
3.	Measure the attitudes, comprehension, and intent to purchase after 
the exposure.
	
	 Look for changes in attitudes (see Chapter 9 for measuring lift) and how 
well participants’ attitudes and sentiments match the intended attitude.
Tracking Conversions and Purchases
A purchase is a conversion, but a conversion is not always a purchase. 
Potential customers often engage with a company in multiple ways during 
the consideration phase. These actions, such as signing up for the company’s 
email list or downloading a product brochure from the company website, can 
also be considered a type of conversion, or a micro conversion.
Like purchases, micro conversions that happen online can be tracked and 
quantified, giving you a clearer picture of the customer journey to purchase 
(see Chapter 7). These conversions also can be considered leads that can 
turn into customers. Giving potential customers in the consideration phase 
a way to engage with your business through micro conversions is one form 
of lead generation: the process of creating sales leads that might convert into 
sales. You can help nurture a lead that engages with your company through a 
micro conversion to make a purchase through additional communication, or 
touchpoints, along the customer’s journey to purchase.
In order to turn a potential customer who engages with your company web-
site via a micro conversion into a paying customer, you first have to create 
micro conversions and a way to record them.

Part III: Analytics for the Customer Journey 
Tracking micro conversions
To start measuring micro conversions and ultimately conversions on a web-
site, you need to set up an analytics tool. A number of analytics tools allow 
you to track website interaction. The most popular solution (free) is Google 
Analytics (http://www.google.com/analytics).
Web analytics tools allow you to collect the following metrics on online 
interactions.
	
✓	Page views: One of the most fundamental measures of engagement on 
a website is which pages customers are viewing and how many times 
those pages are viewed. This will become a key metric for tracking con-
version opportunities.
	
✓	Average session duration: Average session duration is simply the total 
duration of all sessions on your site divided by the number of sessions. 
In other words, it’s how long, on average, visitors spend on your site. 
Sometimes also referred to as time on site, this metric can give you 
insight into whether visitors are spending a significant amount of time 
browsing your site or leaving quickly after arriving.
	
	This metric can be measured over time to compare how visitor behavior 
changes. For example, if you add additional page content, you can com-
pare average session duration before and after the change was made to 
determine if the new content had an impact on how long visitors were 
interacting with the website.
	
✓	Bounce rate: Bounce rate is the percentage of single-page sessions. This 
means that site visitors immediately left the website from the page they 
first entered without interacting with the page.
	
	A high bounce rate, generally upwards of 60 percent, can be an indica-
tion that website visitors aren’t finding what they anticipated when they 
clicked through to your site. On the flip side, it can also be an indication 
that website visitors found the information that they wanted quickly and 
had no need to view additional content. A low bounce rate, generally 
below 40 percent, means that most website visitors are engaging with 
multiple pages on your website.
	
✓	Pages per session: Related to session duration is the metric pages per 
session, which measures on average, how many pages on your website 
a visitor looks at during his or her visit. This can give you an indication 
of how visitors are spending their time on your website, not just for 
how long.

 Chapter 10: Quantifying the Consideration and Purchase Phases
	
	Like average session duration, pages per session can be compared over 
time to help determine if changes made to your website or marketing 
campaigns affect how much content visitors are interacting with.
	
✓	New versus returning users: This metric tells you what percentage of 
visitors to your site are visiting for the first time versus visiting for a 
second or subsequent time.
	
	Looking at the new versus returning visitor metric can be helpful in ana-
lyzing user behavior and on-site engagement (as discussed in Chapter 4 
on customer segmentation). You may find, for example, that visitors who 
have previously visited your website spend more time on-site and view 
more content than those who visit it for the first time. You may also find 
that returning visitors are more likely to move from the consideration 
phase to the purchase phase as they become more aware of your products 
and services and gain confidence in buying from you versus a competitor.
Creating micro-conversion opportunities
Even if your ultimate goal is to drive sales of your product, online or offline, 
think about what other actions your potential customers might take as they 
work their way through the consideration phase. Use your segments and 
personas to determine offers that resonate with customers’ pain points and 
needs. (See Chapter 5 for the scoop on setting up personas.)
You may already have some micro conversions on your website, perhaps 
a form that allows visitors to sign up for an email newsletter, or a phone 
number at the top of the page that will allow them to contact customer ser-
vice or the sales team.
Other examples you might consider adding include:
	
✓	Web form for the user to request prices or general information
	
✓	Web form that allows the visitor to send an email to the company
	
✓	White papers, case studies, e-books, or other downloadable assets
	
✓	Digital product catalogs or brochures that can be downloaded
	
✓	A form that allows a user to request a brochure or catalog by mail
	
✓	Video tutorials or product demonstration presentations
	
✓	Calculators and other useful utilities
	
✓	Capability to create a user account on your website

Part III: Analytics for the Customer Journey 
Setting up conversion tracking
Once you have created micro conversions on your website, be sure that you 
can track their behavior. Google Analytics allows you to track micro conver-
sions and sales through the setup of Goals.
Google Analytics Goals can currently track four types of actions a visitor 
takes on your website:
	
✓	Destination: Visitor reaches a specific page
	
✓	Duration: Sessions that last for equal to or longer than a specified 
amount of time
	
✓	Pages/screens per session: Visitor views a specified number of pages or 
screens
	
✓	Event: Action specified as an event is triggered (for example, a video is 
played)
Say, for example, that you have created an email sign-up form and a brochure 
download as micro conversions on your site. In each case, the site is set up 
so that the visitor reaches a confirmation page, thanking her for taking the 
action. You can set up two separate destination goals in Google Analytics: 
one that records each email sign-up and another that records a brochure 
download as a type of goal completion.
In addition to tracking micro conversions, you need to track online purchases. 
Google Analytics also offers e-commerce tracking that passes information about 
the purchased product, including quantity purchased, associated revenue, 
and tax and shipping costs, as well as how many times a user visited your site 
before completing a transaction.
Google Analytics provides extensive documentation on how to set up a pro-
file for your website and how to create goals on its support site (https://
support.google.com/analytics).
Measuring conversion rates
Conversion rate is the number of website visitors taking a desired action 
divided by the total number of visitors. Conversion rates can be measured for 
your entire website, a single page, or even for individual marketing channels 
that drive traffic to your website, like search engine listings or social media 
platforms. You can also track conversion rates for individual conversion or 
micro-conversion types.

 Chapter 10: Quantifying the Consideration and Purchase Phases
Say you want to determine what the overall conversion rate for your website 
is over the past year. Here’s how you find your conversion rate:
	
1.	Look at the total number of users who visited your site during the last 
12 months.
	
2.	Add up the completed online conversions.
	
3.	Divide the number of completed online conversions by the total 
number of users.
	
	 For example, if you had 350,000 visits to your site last year and 3,500 of 
those turned into a purchase, you would divide 3,500 by 350,000 for a 
resulting conversion rate of 1%.
	
	 If those 350,000 visits had led to 7,000 conversions, your conversion rate 
would be 2%.
Determining what a “good” conversion rate is depends on the type of web-
site, the industry, and what customers are being asked to do:
	
✓	For signing up for an online newsletter, the conversion may be between 
1 percent and 20 percent.
	
✓	If you’re asking people to make a purchase or donate money, expect the 
conversion rate to be small, usually less than 1 percent.
	
	When I helped Wikipedia measure and improve its online donations, the 
conversion rate was below 0.1 percent.
What makes a strong conversion rate for your site is best measured against 
your previous conversion rate.
Measuring Changes through A/ B Testing
The true success of company-directed messages is to measure how changes 
to your message affect recipients’ behavior. Here are two common methods:
	
✓	Usability testing is done ahead of time. It’s ideal for testing major new 
concepts with qualified participants in a study before you launch to 
your full customer base. This provides an insight into how designs will 
affect conversion rates and is covered in Chapter 14.
	
✓	Real-time testing involves running a live experiment with your prospec-
tive and current customers on a specific touchpoint. Savvy direct mar-
keters have used this technique for decades. It’s used extensively on 
websites, online ads, email newsletters, and even email subject lines. It’s 
best used when you aren’t introducing major new concepts, but rather, 
want to tweak or optimize existing designs to improve conversions.

Part III: Analytics for the Customer Journey 
The approach is often referred to as A/B testing because there are usually 
two alternatives being tested: option A and option B.
	
You can test more than two alternatives (A/B/C testing). It’s called split testing 
(because different alternatives are split between your customers).
The idea behind A/B testing is that customers are randomly presented with 
one of two alternatives and in real time, you measure which alternative gener-
ates a better outcome. Outcomes in this case are one of a number of metrics 
that measure engagement, consideration, and purchasing. Typically only one 
variable is changed for each design (for example, a color, picture, or price). 
That enables you to properly attribute responses to the respective variable. 
(See Chapter 2 for a reminder on variables.)
Offline A/B testing
One example of A/B testing is direct mailing two alternative promotions in 
two different color envelopes (white versus manila) to prospective custom-
ers. If the offer contained in these envelopes has customers follow through, 
you can compare the percentage of A versus B envelopes to tell you which 
promotion is more effective.
For example, I worked with a national advertising agency that placed ads in 
weekly newspapers. The goal was to understand the increase (or decrease) in 
revenue from a coupon for Pier 1 Imports, a U.S. retailer. Newspaper readers 
in a handful of U.S. cities received the coupon, and the sales that weekend in 
those specific cities were statistically compared to results for cities that did 
not receive the coupon. We also controlled for differences in the market by 
accounting for same-store sales the prior month and year. We were able to 
see that the discount from the coupon was offset by the increase in sales.
Online A/B testing
While A/B testing gives you a lot of insight, there is a hard cost in mailing and 
printing different design alternatives. It can take a long time to realize that a 
significant portion of people throw out one color envelope more than another 
color. If a significant portion of customers toss the envelopes in the trash, 
you’ve lost money. Not a good thing!
Online A/B testing has no printing or postage costs, and the feedback is 
immediate. For those reasons, it’s very popular to optimize websites and 
online advertising.

 Chapter 10: Quantifying the Consideration and Purchase Phases
By far, the most common type of A/B testing metric is the conversion rate 
described earlier in the chapter. As a reminder, a conversion can be anything 
from clicking a button, subscribing to email, or adding an item to a shopping 
cart, to making a purchase.
Here are the five steps to take to go from data to insights:
	
1.	Determine your metric.
	
	 The two most common metrics are conversion (or micro conversion) 
and average order value for a purchase.
	
2.	Find your variable.
	
	 Identify one salient element on the website: a button, headline, image, or 
layout. Choose two alternatives.
	
	 For example, PayPal tested two alternative designs of its Check-out 
button. Small changes resulted in major differences in conversions and 
average order value.
	
3.	Randomize and test.
	
	 The secret to a successful A/B test is randomization. Alternate which 
design (A or B) the next customer coming to a web page receives.
	
	 It isn’t always possible to randomize designs; some companies run them 
sequentially (for example, Design A goes from Monday to Wednesday 
and Design B from Thursday to Sunday). Watch out for daily and weekly 
seasonality. You may have a different type of customer during the eve-
ning or weekends and running tests sequentially means you can’t tell if 
different conversion rates are the result of the designs or just the differ-
ent customers.
	
4.	Determine your sample size.
	
	 Differences in A/B test results are often very small, usually less than 5 
percent or even 1 percent. For high-traffic websites, though, increasing 
conversion rates by even .1 percent can result in a substantial increase 
in sales.
	
	 For example, I worked with Wikipedia to help measure the best banner 
ads to increase donations. The differences in conversion rates were 
often less than .05 percent. But because millions of people viewed each 
website monthly, differences this small translated into thousands of 
dollars.
	
	 The sample size you need depends on the size of the difference you 
hope to detect (if one exists). The smaller the difference, the larger the 
sample size you need. Table 10-1 shows the number of customers you 
need for each design alternative.

	 For example, to detect a 1% difference in conversion rates (5% compared 
to 6%), you should plan on randomly assigning 12,856 participants to 
Design A or Design B. One approach to sample size planning is to take 
the approximate “traffic” you expect on a website and split it so half 
receives treatment A and half receives treatment B. If you expect approx-
imately 1,000 page views a day, then you need to test for about 13 days. 
At that sample size, if there was a difference of 1 percentage point or 
larger (for instance, 5% versus 6%), then that difference would be statis-
tically significant.
	
	 If you want to determine if your new application has at least a 20 percent 
higher completion rate than the older application, plan to test 80 people 
(40 in each group).
	
5.	Compare the difference.
	
	 Don’t be fooled by randomness by eyeballing the results. A higher con-
version rate could be from chance fluctuations. To determine if two 
conversion rates are statistically different, use an A/B test calculator, 
like this one (http://www.measuringu.com/ab-calc.php) (see 
figure 10-4).
	
	 For example, if 100 out of 5,000 users click through on an email (2% 
conversion rate) and 70 out of 4,800 click through on a different version 
(1.46% conversion rate), the probability of obtaining a difference this 
large or larger, if there really was no difference, is 4% (p-value = .04). 
That is to say, it’s statistically significant — you just don’t see differ-
ences this large very often from chance alone. The input and output of 
the A/B test are shown in Figure 10-4. See the appendix for how to com-
pute the statistical difference between percentages.

Use online 
calculators 
to test for 
statistical 
significance.
	
	
Just because you get results that are statistically significant doesn’t mean 
they are practically significant. Practical significance means the increase will 
have some practical meaning to the company or customers. For instance, a 
new design may increase the number of customers (statistically significant), 
but the increase might be so small (say, .01%) that it will have no noticeable 
impact on sales.
	
While your goal may be to optimize conversions (more click-throughs and pur-
chases), don’t forget to consider the total revenue. In some cases, more cus-
tomers will click through a design, but if it results in a smaller average order 
value, then you’re ultimately losing money even though more customers are 
converting!
The changing visitors of Wikipedia
I helped the Wikipedia team better under-
stand the conversion rate data that they 
were monitoring during their donation period. 
Wikipedia is the online encyclopedia that is 
ad free and free to all. It raises money by 
having a donation drive a couple weeks each 
year. It’s therefore important to have as many 
customers as possible donate during that 
short window of time.
A lot of A/B testing of banners is used to see 
which messages and images elicit the highest 
response. The test banner that performs better 
is kept in place.
Wikipedia traffic is enormous: Hundreds of 
millions view it every day. That means statis-
tical significance is reached quickly, usually 
within hours instead of days, as on many 
other sites.
One perplexing result the Wikipedia analytics 
team noticed was that they’d reach statisti-
cal significance but then the conversion rate 
would no longer be significant as the day pro-
gressed. After double-checking their numbers, 
it turned out that as it got later in the day in 
the U.S., more international readers started 
coming online and they reacted differently to 
the banners than did U.S. visitors. The conclu-
sion was to split out banners by region. This 
illustrates the importance of understand-
ing how your customers may change, even 
throughout the day!

Part III: Analytics for the Customer Journey 
Testing multiple variables
A/B testing typically involves measuring only one variable at a time, like a web-
site button size, placement, or color to increase conversion rates. But design 
elements have a way of interacting with each other in unpredictable ways. It 
can be that one type of image works well with only a certain color button. Or 
perhaps a headline, image, and location increase the conversion rate, while 
another combination decreases the conversion rate. Software from companies 
like Adobe can be used to test and implement multivariate tests.
	
The Which Test Won website, https://whichtestwon.com/, provides 
plenty of examples of online A/B and multivariate testing. It’s surprising how 
people’s intuition can be a poor judge of what design combinations will actu-
ally increase conversions.
Making the Most of Website Analytics
Website analytics tools contain a wealth of data and metrics that can help you 
quantify your customers’ behavior and improve user experience. As you dive 
into the wealth of information tools like those that Google Analytics provides 
about your users, here are some guidelines for making the most of them:
Multivariate testing leads to surprising results
Testing multiple variables at the same time 
saves time, and more importantly, provides the 
optimal combination of variables. For example, I 
was helping a credit card company understand 
which combination of elements on a registra-
tion form led to higher conversions (applying 
for a card was the conversion outcome). During 
early tests, the two variables used were asking 
participants their Social Security Number (SSN) 
and offering a 0% introductory interest rate. In 
separate A/B tests, we found that prospective 
customers, not surprisingly, were more likely to 
apply with a 0% introductory rate.
Also, we found that asking just the last four 
digits of customers’ SSN also increased their 
likelihood to apply. Both options cost the com-
pany money (in lower interest and higher costs 
to validate someone’s identity). However, we 
found that customers were actually slightly 
more likely to apply even when there wasn’t a 
0% introductory offer when they were asked 
just the last four digits of the SSN. In other 
words, the interaction of these two variables 
led to a different optimal result than testing 
them separately.

✓	Start with a goal. With so much information at your fingertips, it can 
be easy to get lost in the data. You may find that you’re spending a lot 
of time looking at information without taking action on it. The best way 
to combat this and make the data useful is to use the tool with specific 
goals in mind.
	
	Write down one to three goals and use them to guide your time spent in 
Google Analytics. If you find yourself wandering off in another direction, 
remind yourself of your purpose for the current session and refocus.
	
✓	Use historical data to put current data in context. You can find out 
whether your current methods are in line or significantly different 
than previous time periods, which is incredibly helpful to decide when 
you need to make changes. Choose the date range you’re interested 
in — usually the previous period, previous year, or a custom date range.
	
✓	Use annotations. Annotations are an incredibly helpful tool for flagging 
unusual spikes or drops in website traffic and other metrics. You can note 
a higher number of conversions due to a limited time offer or a drop in 
conversion following a website change. When you review historical data, 
you can remember what may have caused the change in your data.
	
	Set your annotations to allow others to see them. Shared annotations 
can save your team a lot of work while looking for the cause behind data 
irregularities.
	
	Use annotations for any data irregularities that you are aware of, as 
well as for noting when marketing campaigns launch or your company 
receives earned media mentions, so that you and your team can easily 
tie performance changes back to your initiatives and other external 
forces.
	
✓	Use advanced segments. Advanced segments are a powerful way to iso-
late subsets of your website traffic for analysis. Google Analytics comes 
with predefined segments, as well as the option to build your own, 
in order to compare and contrast how different segments of visitors 
behave on your website.
	
	For example, you may find that users who visit the site via organic 
search results stay longer on-site and view more pages per session than 
those who come through another channel, such as referral from a social 
media page.
	
✓	Create dashboards and shortcuts for views you use often. Dashboards 
are a way to quickly view data that you use frequently, such as bounce 
rate, user locations, and more. You can create up to 20 dashboards in 
your Analytics profile, with up to 12 widgets that display different met-
rics on each of them.

✓	Use alerts to stay on top of performance changes. If there is a sudden 
spike or drop in conversion rates, or bounce rate, you need to know so 
you can address it.
	
✓	Examine your search data. Search data can be incredibly valuable: It 
lends some insight into the minds of users and can sometimes even tell 
a bit about their intent as they interact with your content. If you’re using 
pay-per-click (PPC), or paid search, to drive traffic to your website, you 
have a wealth of information about the keywords and related search 
queries that drove people to your site.

ou probably think that once a potential customer becomes an actual 
customer, your job is done. Not so fast! You may have put a lot of effort 
into getting that customer to make a purchase, but it’s just as important to 
put additional effort into turning that customer into a repeat and loyal cus-
tomer. Not only can that customer make additional purchases from you, but 
he or she also just might recommend your business, which could lead to 
even more customers.
As soon as the transaction is complete, customers move into a phase in 
which you provide service, support, and fulfilling the promises made during 
the pre-purchase process. This phase of the customer journey can be one 
of the longest, especially for products or services that aren’t purchased fre-
quently. During this phase, customers can move toward being loyal or less 
loyal, reconsider the competition, and even be negative influencers. This can 
lead to an improvement in the perception of the brand or its degradation. 
This outcome of the post-purchase phase will influence the next purchase 
consideration for the current customer and for other potential customers as 
they become influenced by positive and negative word of mouth in person or 
on social media.
In the post-purchase phase, you continue to measure customers’ attitudes, 
especially customer satisfaction, brand and product loyalty, and future 
intent.
In this chapter, I use many of the measures introduced in Chapter 9. The 
same techniques you use in the pre-purchase phase and consideration 
phases work in the post-purchase phase, too.

Part III: Analytics for the Customer Journey 
Dealing with Cognitive Dissonance
In the post-purchase phase, you either confirm or alter the ideas and beliefs 
customers have of you from the pre-purchase and consideration phases. The 
mismatch between customers’ expectations and their actual experience leads 
to delight or disappointment and cognitive dissonance.
	
Cognitive dissonance describes the mental discomfort people feel when their 
actions and beliefs don’t align. In this case, the beliefs or attitudes are that 
the product was not a good value and didn’t do what they believed — in other 
words, buyer’s remorse.
Three of the main causes of cognitive dissonance are
	
✓	Value: The price or total payment cost isn’t worth what was paid.
	
✓	Quality: The product or service doesn’t perform as expected, is missing 
features, or breaks.
	
✓	Better alternatives: Buyer’s remorse is more intense when a customer 
has rejected a lot of alternative products.
Reducing dissonance
Customers with cognitive dissonance will take actions to reduce it, which can 
mean returning a product, spreading negative word of mouth, or not purchas-
ing the product again. Look for evidence of cognitive dissonance, and where 
possible, correct and prevent it so positive emotions are associated with the 
purchase and brand.
Customers with high cognitive dissonance can do several things.
	
✓	Take no action: The consumer gets over her dissonance (but likely 
remembers for future purchases).
	
✓	Cancel or return the product: This results in a lost sale and cost of han-
dling the return.
	
	For service agreements such as software maintenance contracts, mobile 
phone service, or cable TV, the cancellation of a customer represents a 
major loss because of the loss of recurring revenue (see Chapter 6 on 
calculating customer lifetime value). To keep this customer, offer future 
discounts or more channels to prevent a cancellation, and assuage 
dissonance.
	
	When customers return a product, you have to track the return rate. See 
the upcoming section on dealing with returns.

153
 Chapter 11: Tracking Post-Purchase Behavior
	
✓	Purchase another product: Although the sale is made, the relationship 
with the company and future purchases are in jeopardy.
	
✓	Contact customer support or customer service representatives: This 
costs your company money in terms of time spent listening to the cus-
tomer and fixing the problem.
	
	How you handle customers through customer service is vitally impor-
tant. You have the opportunity to turn a dissatisfied customer into a sat-
isfied one, which could lead to a loyal repeat customer.
	
✓	Take legal action: Probably the worst outcome, customers feeling like 
they need to sue to get out of a contract or get their money back.
Turning dissonance into satisfaction
Product warranties, free return policies, free shipping, and free return ship-
ping help reduce the changes for dissonance.
To address customers’ dissonance, each of these reasons can be addressed 
using the following approaches.
	
✓	Offer a better value. Change the price or increase the offerings for the 
same price.
	
✓	Improve quality. Improving quality is easier said than done. Identify 
the root cause of the quality concern, whether it be features or 
performance.
	
	One way to diagnose the root causes of problems is a cause-and-effect 
diagram. Turn to the later section “Finding the Root Cause with Cause-
and-Effect Diagrams” for more information.
	
✓	Confirm the initial choice. Messaging, in email newsletters, ads, and 
follow-up calls, reassures customers that they made the right choice and 
that the purchase does conform to their attitudes and beliefs.
More information about marketing options to reduce cognitive dissonance 
can be found in Marketing For Dummies, by Alexander Hiam (Wiley).
Tracking return rates
One of the actions customers can take is to return a product. A return guar-
antee is key to alleviating cognitive dissonance, but it can be expensive to 
maintain if you suffer a spate of returns.

Part III: Analytics for the Customer Journey 
	
When a product is returned, it not only represents a lost sale, but increased 
costs in repackaging (or an unsalable item) and the logistics to handle the 
returns.
Once a customer returns a product, there isn’t much that can be done for 
that customer, but you can learn a lot to prevent future returns.
	
1.	Collect the return rates, dates, and details.
	
2.	Look to other clues that can predict the root cause of returns.
	
3.	Predict the return rates based on patterns in the root causes.
For example, I worked with a U.S.-based cellular service provider that car-
ried a number of phones from different manufacturers, including Apple, 
Samsung, and Motorola. The cellular service provider collected the return 
rates for each type of phone and then looked into the causes of the returns. 
One reason for the returns was that customers found certain phones harder 
to use. The company started collecting usability data on all its phones, 
then associated that with the return rates. Based on the data, the com-
pany stopped selling the phones that lacked a decent usability score. (See 
Chapter 9 to find out how to use the System Usability Scale, or SUS.)
Measuring the Post-Purchase 
Touchpoints
The data you collect in the post-purchase phase aids in understanding how 
well the experience is at each stage and also how to improve the experience 
for current and future customers. It could be that customers had great first 
impressions but had a poor service experience. Measuring at different post-
purchase touchpoints helps identify opportunities for improvement.
	
To easily collect data, establish a feedback loop. Problems, frustrations, and 
improvements are properly channeled back to the product development 
teams.
One of the quickest ways to identify opportunities for improvement is to ask 
customers in a post-purchase survey their level of satisfaction with each of 
the touchpoints.
Keep the surveys short and ask a mix of open- and closed-ended questions. 
You should include:
	
✓	An overall measure of satisfaction about the product or experience, 
using a rating scale (see Chapter 9)
www.it-ebooks.info
WWW.EBOOK777.COM

free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
155
 Chapter 11: Tracking Post-Purchase Behavior
	
✓	More detailed questions about each touchpoint (also using a rating 
scale)
	
✓	Questions about future intent, such as likelihood to recommend or likeli-
hood to repurchase
	
✓	Open-ended questions for customers to describe in their own words 
their feelings (both positive and negative) about the experience and spe-
cifically how they’d improve the product
Digging into the post-purchase 
touchpoints
You can deploy your surveys at different intervals to correspond with a 
touchpoint. It’s often most efficient, and less of a burden on the customer, if 
you ask customers to complete only one survey at a key point in the post-
purchase process — say, after the customer has used the product for some 
time.
Some common touchpoints include:
	
✓	Shipping and delivery
	
✓	Unboxing (opening the product)
	
✓	Installation and setup
	
✓	Customer support
	
✓	Feature usage
	
✓	Overall satisfaction
Shipping and delivery
When customers decide to purchase something, they want it right away. For 
an in-store purchase, this isn’t much of an issue when the item is in stock. For 
catalog and Internet purchases, the delay of receiving the goods attenuates 
the impulsiveness of the purchase decisions. Customers set firm expecta-
tions about when they expect a product to arrive. Amazon.com’s next-day 
(and even same-day) shipping helps alleviate the gap in time that otherwise 
causes cognitive dissonance to fester. Even if you can’t deliver products the 
next day, you can measure and improve the customer’s expectations.
For example, when looking at the customer satisfaction of the purchasing 
process with computer manufacturer Lenovo, the promised production and 
delivery time are paramount.

Part III: Analytics for the Customer Journey 
Unboxing
The experience of removing a product from its package is one of the first 
physical touchpoints you have to influence the emotional connection a 
customer has with the brand. For example, the unboxing experience of the 
iPhone helps reinforce Apple’s branding as being cutting edge, clean, and 
easy to use; see Figure 11-1.
Figure 11-1:

experi-
ence helps 
reinforce 
the brand 
attributes 
of a clean, 
cutting-edge 
design.
Installation and setup
For many products, after the unboxing experience, the setup and installa-
tion process defines the first moments of the post-purchase phase. A lot of 
customers lose enthusiasm for a product after unsuccessfully trying to get 
it to work. Asking about the installation and setup experience in your post-
purchase surveys helps identify how much this step influences customers’ 
overall attitudes and future intent. It also helps identify problems that can be 
addressed.
For example, in the mid-1980s, my friend Jim Lewis was helping the IBM 
printer division understand the impacts of the setup and installation phase 
of a new series of IBM printers. They discovered an error in the documenta-
tion that could potentially cause a problem in installation. This would lead 
to product returns, calls to customer support (see the next section), and a 
poor experience. But reprinting all the manuals to fix the problem would also 
be costly. So a team of IBM researchers wanted to see if adding a large “Read 
This First” paper with the correct instructions on top of the printer and origi-
nal installation instructions would prevent the problem. After asking several 
customers to open and set up the printer, IBM researchers watched as most

157
 Chapter 11: Tracking Post-Purchase Behavior
of these study participants completely ignored the “Read This First” paper 
and incorrectly set up the printer. IBM decided to reprint the manuals instead 
of risking high returns and a failed installation experience.
Customer support
Customer support is one of the most common post-purchase touchpoints. 
This usually consists of a call center, email support, or online chat feature. 
In many companies, the sales team is comprised of employees who have the 
charm and personality to make the sales process smooth. Unfortunately, that 
isn’t necessarily the same experience the customer encounters when work-
ing with the support teams. Call centers and support teams are often out-
sourced, which may create a language, cultural, or physical distance barrier 
between the customer and this important company touchpoint.
Customer support is not just an opportunity to satisfy a current customer by 
addressing a question or complaint; it’s also an opportunity to delight a cus-
tomer by exceeding her expectations. This leads to more loyal customers.
The customer support touchpoint plays such an important role in post-
purchase satisfaction that it often deserves its own (usually short) survey 
that’s sent immediately after the interaction. Figure 11-2 shows an example 
customer support survey from Amazon.
	
If you find that most customers don’t take your post-purchase survey, offer an 
incentive to do so, such as a discount off a future purchase.

Part III: Analytics for the Customer Journey 
Feature usage
It’s often the case that customers will purchase a product for a set of features 
during the consideration phase, but use only a subset in the post-purchase 
phase. Collect data about which features of the product customers are actu-
ally using and those they are not using. Also ask what features are missing 
that they would like. (See Chapter 14 for ideas on measuring usability.)
Assessing post-purchase satisfaction ratings
You can create your own customer satisfaction questions, but remember that 
consumer-advocate organizations often also measure customer satisfaction 
for a variety of things: products, services, and websites:
	
✓	The magazine Consumer Reports publishes customers’ complaints and 
ratings, including their opinions about repair service, for everything from 
appliances to electronics to automobiles. This information becomes valu-
able input for prospective customers in the consideration phase.
	
✓	Companies such as JD Power and the American Satisfaction Customer 
Index provide customer satisfaction rates on a number of products.
	
✓	The Amazon product rating system is an often cited reference for cus-
tomers in the consideration phase.
You can use these published sources of customer satisfaction as a bench-
mark to your own efforts by seeing how competitors (and your product) 
compare with similar products.
Zappos . . . if the shoe fits (or doesn’t)
Zappos.com is an online store that offers dis-
counted shoes. Buying shoes online comes 
with some risk since customers can’t try them 
on and may end up with a pair of shoes they 
don’t want and the hassle of returning them. 
Prospective customers naturally want to mini-
mize the chances of buying shoes that don’t fit 
or that they don’t like (avoiding cognitive dis-
sonance). Zappos minimizes the risk to the cus-
tomer by offering free returns and free return 
shipping.
What’s more, Zappos provides one of the best 
customer service experiences. Zappos cus-
tomer service reps are known for staying on 
calls for as long as it takes to resolve a cus-
tomer’s problems. (The longest call on record 
lasted seven hours!) The company’s even 
been known to refund money, let customers 
keep the shoes, and even send a new pair, all 
to exceed expectations and keep customers 
coming back and telling friends about their 
experience.

Finding Problems Using 
Call Center Analysis
A number of analytics measure the customer call center experience. The 
point of these analytics shouldn’t just be about finding ways to cut costs or 
improve your support staff’s efficiency. Although it’s important to control 
costs, it’s equally important to meet customer expectations, which leads to 
higher levels of satisfaction and customers who are more likely to recom-
mend and repurchase from you. Your metrics must be meaningful to the 
customer.
Here are six of the most common call center analytics to track, in addition to 
the satisfaction:
	
✓	Customer satisfaction: As with every post-purchase touchpoint, be sure 
your customer lets you know how well his expectations were met.
	
	Use a simple rating scale, something like that from Amazon (refer to 
Figure 11-2).
	
✓	Call resolution: Was the reason for the call successfully addressed?
	
	Don’t rely exclusively on the customer support agent to provide this 
detail. Collect data from the customer, if possible. Many call centers 
pay attention to the percent of calls resolved, which can incentivize 
prematurely marking issues as resolved. Look at customer satisfaction 
along with call resolution to be sure expectations are met and problems 
are solved. See the nearby sidebar on request closed versus request 
resolved.
	
✓	Hold time: People don’t like to listen to music or hear a recording about 
how valuable a customer they are while they are on hold. Long waits 
only increase the frustration of an already undesirable situation. It isn’t 
an easy thing to fix, but it’s an essential metric to track.
	
✓	Call abandonment: Long hold times lead to customers hanging up. 
These abandoned calls contribute to frustration and a degradation of 
the brand.
	
✓	Reason for call: Have customer support agents describe (using a categori-
zation system or comments field) the reason and resolution for the call. All 
too often, I’ve worked with call-center data to address spikes in calls only 
to see data that has little information regarding the reason for the call.
	
✓	Call duration: A support call takes customers’ time and call agents’ 
time. While it’s good to get to a resolution as quickly as possible, be 
careful that you aren’t incentivizing agents to prematurely end calls. In 
general, no one likes to feel rushed when dealing with an issue. A rushed 
call might lead to another call, a return, or disloyal customer.

Part III: Analytics for the Customer Journey 
Finding the Root Cause with  
Cause-and-Effect Diagrams
Many problems in the post-purchase phase are often symptoms of other 
problems:
	
✓	Customer complaints
	
✓	Returns
	
✓	Calls to customer support
	
✓	Low customer satisfaction ratings
One tool that is particularly handy at getting to root causes is the aptly 
named cause-and-effect diagram. It is also called the fishbone for its fishlike 
skeletal shape. An example is shown in Figure 11-3.
Cause-and-effect diagrams provide a visual display of possible causes of a prob-
lem. Most importantly, they remind you that there are usually multiple causes 
of problems that lead to low customer satisfaction. It would be nice if one 
reason always explained your complex problems — but that’s rarely the case.
Fishbones are low-tech; you need only a piece of paper or a white board for 
team settings (no need to save the bones from dinner last night).
Customer ticket closed or customer 
request resolved?
The frontlines of the customer experience are 
often the customer support channels — phone 
and email. I had a problem with one of my online 
bank accounts. After trying several tweaks over 
a few months, I finally got around to submitting 
a problem ticket via email. Within 24 hours, I 
received a response (as promised).
Eight hours later, I was told that this sort of 
thing happens from time to time and is most 
likely a temporary issue, and that trying again 
in a day or so should work. I was then told the 
ticket was closed. Yikes! The next day, the tem-
porary problem was still there. It was another 
six months before the “temporary issue” was 
resolved. So while the ticket was closed and 
closed quickly (both were positive metrics for 
the call center), my issue lingered.

diagram).
	
Creating a cause-and-effect diagram
Here’s how to use a cause-and-effect diagram in five steps.
	
1.	Define the problem you want to avoid.
	
	 Ideally, you want this statement to be as specific as possible. So if you’re 
dealing with customer returns, a problem statement would be
	
	 “Customer return rates are higher than 10%.”
	
	 The problem statement goes at the head of the fish.
	
2.	Brainstorm possible causes for the problem.
	
	 For high customer return rates, this would be something like
	
•	Customers are unable to set up the product properly.
	
•	Shipping takes too long or is unclear.
	
•	Customers don’t use the product after opening it.
	
•	The price is too high relative to what customers are getting.
	
•	The product breaks or stops working.
	
	 These problems become the bones in the fish. You should think caus-
ally (for example, what causes customers to improperly set up the 
product?).
	
	 Don’t just use the fishbone to propose solutions. For each cause, ask 
“Why does this happen?” In fact, ask “why” as many times as you can 
(like a 3-year-old child does).

	 For example:
	
•	Customers are unable to set up the product properly: Why?
	
•	The directions are long and unclear: Why?
	
•	It’s complicated to explain the setup: Why?
	
•	Many features and steps need to be explained: Why?
	
3.	Sort the causes into clusters, remove duplicates, and rearrange the 
bones of the fish.
	
	 In Figure 11-4, I filled in two branches of the fish.
	
4.	Name the main bones something descriptive of the causes.
	
	 I used Pricing and Product.
	
5.	Identify areas that need data or investigation.
	
	 Some causes are obvious (is there any indication of shipping?), whereas 
others need data (where are customers making mistakes in the setup?). 
You should get something that looks like Figure 11-4.
	
Figure 11-4: 
A part of a 
cause-and-
effect dia-
gram with 
reasons for 
high cus-
tomer return 
rates.
	
Now that the causes are in the fishbone, you’ll likely see connections 
between the causes. Also use this opportunity to continue asking “why” to 
get at root causes.
	
Use the cause-and-effect diagram in all stages of the customer journey to 
brainstorm root causes for product and service problems. It becomes excel-
lent input for finding design solutions and turning negative thinking into posi-
tive user experiences.

o you find yourself buying the same products over and over again? Do 
you have a preferred airline? The last time you chose a new computer, 
did you ask a friend for a recommendation?
Consumer decisions are heavily based on prior experience and on the experi-
ence of friends and colleagues. A once happy customer is likely to be a cus-
tomer again and to recommend a specific company to the people around him.
If a friend or family member helps you when in need, you are happy to recip-
rocate. You may feel a sense of duty, a sense of loyalty to people who have 
been there for you. The emotions that cement a customer’s relationship with 
a company are similar. If the computer you purchased four years ago met or 
exceeded your expectations and customer service was outstanding, you’ll 
purchase a similar model again. When a friend asks what computer you have, 
you’re happy to recommend it. When you rent a car and the car is clean, the 
price is fair, and the pick-up and drop-off experiences are easy and quick, 
you’re much more likely to use the same rental car company in the future.
In this chapter, I help you understand the importance of customer loyalty and 
explain common ways of measuring it. I also introduce methods for identify-
ing what makes customers more likely to recommend a company’s products 
or services.

Part III: Analytics for the Customer Journey 
Measuring Customer Loyalty
Understanding how to measure customer loyalty is an essential first step in pre-
dicting the potential future growth or decline of a product, service, or company.
The “best” metric for measuring customer loyalty depends on the industry, 
company, and type of product or service. Two that are applicable to most prod-
ucts and industries are the repurchase rate and the likelihood to recommend.
Repurchase rate
Probably the first way to gauge customer loyalty is to compute the percent-
age of customers who are repurchasing, reusing, or returning to a product or 
service. This data can be collected from past sales or from surveying custom-
ers about their past or future intent. Data can also be obtained from histori-
cal purchasing records, which are often captured in Customer Relationship 
Management (CRM) systems.
Valuing customer loyalty
Loyal customers are more likely to repurchase, 
reuse, and say good things about their experi-
ence to their friends and colleagues. Products, 
websites, software, and services that have 
more loyal customers therefore possess an 
advantage over competitors with less loyal 
customers.
Shareholders of companies care most about 
top-line revenue, profit, and growth. It’s 
therefore important for company managers, 
employees, and owners to also strive for higher 
profits and growth. Crocs footwear, Lulu Lemon, 
Netflix, and the car service Uber are examples 
of companies that deliver a product or service 
that grew in popularity largely due to custom-
ers repurchasing and telling their friends. But 
Crocs, Lulu Lemon, and Netflix are examples of 
cases where the company’s signature products 
fell in popularity: The same word of mouth that 
led to their rise contributed to their demise.
Stories of Crocs shoes being stuck in escala-
tors spread, as did problems with the transpar-
ency of Lulu Lemon’s yoga pants. As for Netflix, 
it split the company’s products into two services 
and angered customers.
In all three cases, revenues took a hit, but 
even worse, the popularity of the products and 
brands suffered substantially. Therefore, what 
management, employees, and shareholders 
want to know is whether a product or company 
is going to grow or decline before it actually 
does.
Measuring customer loyalty is one way of 
estimating how well a company or product is 
positioned to grow or shrink. While not a per-
fect measure of actual future growth, there is 
some evidence that positive measures of cus-
tomer loyalty correlate strongly with increasing 
earnings.

 Chapter 12: Measuring Customer Loyalty
For example, a 2013 survey of smartphone users by the Yankee group found 
that 91 percent of iPhone owners indicated they will repurchase another 
iPhone.
In contrast, the repurchase rate for Android customers is a much lower 
76 percent. Of the 24 percent of current Android customers who said they’d 
switch, 18 percent are considering purchasing an iPhone.
Repurchase habits are measured differently, depending on the type of prod-
uct or service offered:
	
✓	For rental car companies, the repurchase rate is a good indicator of loy-
alty as certain customer segments rent multiple times per year and have 
many companies to choose from.
	
✓	For car dealerships, a variation on the repurchase rate as a measure of 
loyalty is repeat repair and maintenance visits.
	
✓	For software companies, a similar measure of repurchase loyalty is the 
maintenance contract renewal rates.
	
	At many software companies like the software giant Oracle where I 
worked, customers purchase new database, accounting, and human 
resource software packages about only once every decade, because 
the installation and the migration processes are costly and disruptive. 
The large time span between sales means the repurchase rate lags too 
much to gauge loyalty. While the original sales brought in revenue, the 
real value was having customers sign and resign service agreements. 
Such agreements typically bring in around 20 percent of the original 
sales price and were lucrative, as they are paid annually. One of the ear-
liest indicators of the likelihood that a customer would purchase from 
a competitor was the canceling or non-renewal of service agreements. 
Consequently, this is one of the key measures of loyalty the company 
tracked.
	
Watch out for “false-profits.” Customers who repeatedly purchase may be 
unsatisfied with their experience but feel they have no choice but to continue 
purchasing. Merge both purchase history and customer attitudes to help 
determine if the profits are from satisfied and truly loyal customers or custom-
ers who have no choice.
A repurchasing matrix takes the repurchase rate and displays the relative 
rates for a set of competitors or comparable products within the same com-
pany. To build one, compute the percentage of customers who repurchase a 
product or a competitor’s product.

Table 12-1 is a repurchasing matrix for laptop computers using hypothetical 
data:
	
✓	The first cell indicates that 68 percent of customers who bought a 
Lenovo computer ended up buying a second one.
	
✓	The second cell indicates that 3 percent of the customers who first 
bought a Lenovo laptop chose Dell the second time around.

The values on the diagonal (the large numbers where each brand’s column 
and row intersects) are the repurchase rates. The values off each diagonal 
are the competitors to which the customers are defecting.
	
The values often don’t add up to 100%, because not all competitors are 
considered.
In looking at this example data, you can see that Apple customers are about 
twice as loyal as Asus’s customers. Apple has a repurchase rate of 77% com-
pared to 38% for Asus.
Given that actual repurchase rates can take years to collect, especially for 
products that aren’t purchased frequently, building a repurchasing matrix 
can take years. To speed up the process and gauge your customers’ loyalty 
before they defect, you can ask their intent to repurchase as well as their like-
lihood to refer a friend, which is the metric I discuss next.
Net Promoter Score
Word of mouth is a powerful and organic force that can’t easily be controlled 
like an advertising campaign:

 Chapter 12: Measuring Customer Loyalty
	
✓	On one hand, when customers continue to purchase and tell their 
friends about a positive experience, word of mouth can spread as 
fast as the norovirus in winter through social media and in-person 
conversations.
	
✓	However, ill will and customer defection spread like a virus, too, if cus-
tomers have bad experiences.
The Net Promoter Score (NPS) is a popular way of measuring customer loy-
alty through understanding word-of-mouth marketing. It is based on a single 
question: “How likely are you to recommend [product or service] to a friend 
or colleague?” This type of question was found to be the best or second-
best predictor of repeat purchases or referrals in 11 out of 14 industries. Net 
Promoter, NPS, and Net Promoter Score are trademarks of Satmetrix Systems, 
Inc., Bain & Company, and Fred Reicheld.
Most companies I work with use or have used the Net Promoter Score. 
Because of its popularity, I explain the scoring and its usage in more detail in 
the next section.
Computing the NPS
One of the most appreciated aspects of the Net Promoter Score is how it’s 
presented as a percentage, which is appealing to executives.
Follow these steps to calculate the Net Promoter Score:
	
1.	Ask your customers how likely they are to recommend your product 
or service to a friend or colleague.
	
	 Use an 11-point scale: 0 = Not at all likely and 10 = Extremely likely. 
Figure 12-1 shows a layout example for this question.
	
Figure 12-1: 
The Net 
Promoter 
Score.
	
	
2.	Compute the proportions of promoters, passives, and detractors.
	
	 Part of the research into building a Net Promoter Score is finding which 
numbers on the scale map to customers who are more likely to say good 
things, more likely to say bad things, or not say much of anything to 
friends about an experience.

Part III: Analytics for the Customer Journey 
	
	 They can be divided into three groups:
	
•	Promoters are customers who rate a 9 or 10 on the response scale.
	
	These are the customers who were found to be most likely to 
speak favorably and recommend your product or service based on 
the research by Bain and Fred Reicheld. You want to have as many 
promoters as possible for your product or service.
	
•	Passives are customers who rate a 7 or 8 on the response scale.
	
	Passive customers are generally satisfied with their experience and 
are loyal. However, they are less likely to recommend your product 
or service to friends. The goal is to turn passives into promoters.
	
•	Detractors are customers who rate a 0 to 6 on the response scale.
	
	These customers are not only the least loyal, but also the most 
likely to actually discourage friends and colleagues from purchas-
ing or using your product. Some detractors can be turned into pas-
sives or promoters by identifying their dissatisfaction and fixing it. 
Some detractors, however, are “lost” customers and no amount of 
product improvement will keep them.
	
	 Once you identify who the promoters, passives, and detractors are, con-
vert them to percentages by dividing the number in each category by 
the total number of customers who answered the likelihood to recom-
mend question. For example, if 100 customers answered the likelihood 
to recommend question and 10 responded with numbers between 0 
and 6, then 10 percent of the sample are detractors.
	
3.	Compute the NPS.
	
	 To compute the NPS, subtract the percentage of detractors from the per-
centage of promoters.
	
	 For example, if 50 out of 100 customers responded with 9’s or 10’s, then 
50% of the sample are promoters. If 10 responded with numbers between 0 
and 6, then 10% of the sample are detractors. The Net Promoter Score 
for this sample of data is then 50% – 10% = 40%. The NPS can range 
from –100% (all detractors) to 100% (indicating all promoters).
A sample of data from a 2014 survey of customers to the United Airlines web-
site is displayed in Table 12-2. Customers were asked whether they would 
recommend using the United Airlines website to a friend or a colleague on 
the 11-point likelihood to recommend scale. Although more than 100 cus-
tomers were surveyed, this example shows only the answers of the first 10 
respondents.

This data sample shows six promoters and one detractor out of the ten 
respondents. Therefore, the promoter percentage is 60% and the detractor 
percentage is 10%, making the NPS 50%.
	
Like all survey data, the Net Promoter Score has a sampling error and fluctu-
ates from sample to sample. A very different Net Promoter Score could have 
been obtained in the preceding example if more (or less!) data had been used 
in Table 12-2. Sampling error depends primarily on the sample size, because 
most companies cannot survey their entire customer base. Only a small 
fraction of the customers, a sample, is considered. Usually, the larger the 
sample, the more its answers are representative of the whole customer base. 
Therefore, a larger sample translates into smaller sampling errors. Knowing 
the sampling error, confidence intervals can be calculated.
Due to the way the NPS is calculated, however, the confidence intervals are 
actually twice as wide as when using a simple proportion or computing the 
average score. Why? Because there is an uncertainty on both the percentage 
of promoters and the percentage of detractors.
	
The simplest thing to do is to compute a confidence interval around the mean 
score and calculate the confidence interval around that. Otherwise, contact 
your favorite statistician to help you compute the confidence intervals.
What’s a good NPS?
As with any metric, you want to know what constitutes a good score and 
bad score. While a repurchase rate has its own intuitive appeal (people can 
understand that 48% means a bit less than half of customers are repurchas-
ing), the NPS is less obvious because it involves two percentages.

Part III: Analytics for the Customer Journey 
In general, you want your NPS to be positive, which indicates there are more 
promoters than detractors. A negative NPS means there are more detractors 
than promoters, and consequently, a lot of negative word of mouth relative to 
positive word of mouth.
The best way to assess your NPS is to compare it to
	
✓	Other products or services in your company
	
✓	Published industry benchmarks
The average NPS varies quite substantially between industries and between 
business-to-consumer (B2C) and business-to-business (B2B) companies, 
so look to find the most relevant comparison. More NPS benchmarks 
for software can be found at https://www.measuringu.com/blog/

Tracking the NPS over time
Getting access to competitive data can be difficult for some industries and 
products. Even without competitive data, though, the best comparison is 
often measuring the same product, service, or company over time.
For example, in 2011, Netflix was one of the most recommended and poplar 
companies in the database of Net Promoter Scores my company tracked. In

 Chapter 12: Measuring Customer Loyalty
February 2011, the Netflix NPS was a very high 73%. In the fall of 2011, the 
company decided to split off its home delivery of DVDs and the streaming 
service into two companies. While this switch might have made sense to the 
company, it angered customers, who took to the web and social media to air 
their complaints. We surveyed Netflix customers a month after the change 
and the found the NPS plummeted 70 points to –7%. Netflix at this point had 
more detractors than promoters.
Figure 12-2 shows the results of the NPS survey of customers over time. The 
lines on top of the bars in the graph show the 95% confidence intervals, 
which indicate how much to expect the NPS to fluctuate from sample to 
sample. See Chapter 2 on how to compute and interpret confidence intervals.

Score for

Predicting with the NPS
The Netflix example shows that the NPS does track changes that occur 
in products or companies — in this case, for the worse. Netflix ultimately 
reversed its decisions based on word of mouth, and soon, data from another 
company showed the Netflix NPS hovering around 50%.
The value of measures like the NPS is that they help estimate what will 
happen to word of mouth while something still can be done to avoid disas-
ters. One way to estimate the effect of splitting the company would have been 
for Netflix to test the idea on a subset of customers and then measure the Net 
Promoter Score. More than testing the idea, Netflix could have tested a small 
sample of users on its new website and product categories and then seen how 
that group’s Net Promoter Score differed from the larger control group.
Perhaps Netflix did perform such testing and anticipate losing customers. 
The much larger loss is likely due to other factors and perhaps to untested 
customer correspondence and the geometric effect of negative word of 
mouth. But using the Net Promoter Score as a predictive analytic tool can 
help prevent disasters and identify winners early.

Part III: Analytics for the Customer Journey 
You use the NPS as a key measure to understand the effects of product 
changes before they are released to customers. You can test feature changes 
and user interface design changes, as well as changes in pricing and services. 
For example, I worked with a large mobile phone maker to determine which 
phones customers would like.
A key metric for this company was the return rate of the phones. Customers 
had up to 30 days to return their phone without incurring a fee. Naturally, 
returned phones cost the company money and in some cases, lost custom-
ers. The company wanted to predict which phones would have too high of a 
return rate before being released into thousands of stores in the U.S. We had 
a sample of customers use a series of phones they were considering and had 
them respond to a number of measures, including the Net Promoter Score (as 
well as the System Usability Scale; see Chapter 14 for measures of usability). 
We collected data for months and found that the Net Promoter Score had a 
high association with return rates. That is, phones with lower Net Promoter 
Scores in the testing had higher rates of customers returning them within 
30 days.
Phones with average Net Promoter Scores below –25% had twice the return 
rate as phones with Net Promoter Scores above 30%. These Net Promoter 
Scores became a new benchmark for testing new phones, and the return rate 
and NPS score correlation continued to be monitored.
Finding the reason for the ratings
Collecting the NPS is the first step in measuring customer loyalty. But just 
knowing the NPS for your product or company is not enough. You immedi-
ately want to know why some customers are defecting and what about the 
experience makes others promote it.
One of the easiest and most effective ways to collect the “why” behind the 
numbers is to simply ask participants to provide some rationale for their 
ratings:
	
✓	At the very least, allow customers to tell you the reason for their rating 
using an open-ended question.
	
✓	A slightly more sophisticated approach is to customize the questions 
you ask to promoters, passives, and detractors:
	
•	For promoters: What about their experience makes them most likely 
to recommend it to friends?
	
•	For passives: What can be done to get them to be more likely to 
recommend?
	
•	For detractors: What can be done, fixed, or improved to get them to 
recommend the product or service to a friend?

 Chapter 12: Measuring Customer Loyalty
You should spend time reading through the open-ended comments to look for 
patterns in each of the three categories. Look also to find some quick wins on 
how to fix problems with detractors. As datasets get larger, it can take longer 
to review each open-ended comment, so you may consider separating out the 
responses between multiple analysts.
	
One of the best ways to take action from Net Promoter Score data is to send 
those responsible for the product or specific functions the raw open-ended 
comments customers provide and their Net Promoter Scores. Even better, 
have a system in place so customers who have a problem are contacted to let 
them know you’re trying to fix it.
Combining qualitative and quantitative data
A powerful way of making qualitative, open-ended comments more actionable 
is to combine them with a closed-ended rating scale response question, like 
the Net Promoter Score.
In addition to the open-ended reasons from the likelihood to recommend 
question, I often ask customers to name what could be improved. This way, I 
collect suggestions, even from promoters who are happy but still might have 
ideas to help improve the experience.
An example is shown in Figure 12-3. A survey on an automotive website 
netted 110 open-ended comments from customers. Customers were asked to 
name one thing they would improve on the website.

My team took the open-ended comments about what to improve and put 
them into categories. We then computed the Net Promoter Score for each of 
the suggestion categories.

To help prioritize what areas to focus on, we saw that comments related to 
website navigation and product filters are high in frequency and come from 
users who are likely generating negative word of mouth (notice the negative 
NPS). In contrast, design/layout comments and advertisements, while rela-
tively high in frequency, appear to be minor issues for the users. This was an 
important finding for the company, as it had just introduced ads and wanted 
to know how much of a burden those ads would be for its customers. This 
analysis suggested that while customers didn’t like the ads, they didn’t seem 
to mind them based on the high Net Promoter Scores from customers who 
said they’d like them removed.
Bad profits
How does it feel to pay the check at the restaurant where you had terrible 
service and bad food? Or how do you feel when you pay your cable bill each 
month? And how about paying $150 to change your airline ticket reservation?
In all cases, the companies get your money. It’s revenue in their books. But if 
you’re like me, you aren’t happy about the experience and will remember it 
next time you have a choice. Nobody likes to pay for a subpar or overpriced 
product or for bad service. Bad profits are made when companies financially 
benefit from these negative experiences.
Bad profits are a ticking time bomb. They lead to customer resentment and a 
decrease in customer loyalty, and eventually impact profits negatively.
Each company generates a certain share of bad profits and it is useful to 
know how much it represents to re-orient the company’s strategy. But how 
are bad profits effectively and objectively measured? In the next section, I 
present two methods to do just that.
By combining Net Promoter Score data with customer-by-customer revenue 
data, you can estimate the amount of revenue derived from bad profits. Even 
if you don’t have access to financial data for your company or a competitor, 
you usually can estimate the percentage of revenue from bad profits. For 
example, when my company measured customers of consumer software prod-
ucts a couple years ago, we found that about 17 percent of Adobe Photoshop 
users were detractors. Assuming that everyone pays around the same price 
for a Photoshop license, then around 17 percent of Adobe’s revenue from 
Photoshop comes from detractors.
While it’s bad to generate revenue from dissatisfied customers, it’s worse if 
a large proportion of your revenue comes from detractors. With too much 
detractor revenue for a product or entire company, you are more susceptible 
to new competition, alternatives, or abandonment.

 Chapter 12: Measuring Customer Loyalty
With cable companies, government services, or utilities, there often isn’t 
much of a choice. So even though these industries have some of the lowest 
Net Promoter Scores, they continue to survive. However, competition from 
satellite, other cable providers, and now content delivered via the Internet 
(called OTT) threatens the revenue models of cable providers.
If a product is sold for one price, then it’s easier to estimate the percentage of 
revenue that comes from detractors. When there are multiple products and 
prices, you need to match up customers’ attitudes with their historical rev-
enue. This isn’t as easy as it sounds. Customer revenue data is often tightly 
controlled by companies’ finance gurus, and other departments, usually mar-
keting or customer experience, run the surveys. But even a sample of cus-
tomers will give you some idea about revenue and how it relates to customer 
experience.
As another example, I helped analyze the survey data from a large software 
company. It has dozens of products, different pricing models, and sales chan-
nels. After merging the sales data for the prior year with the Net Promoter 
Scores, we found that around 17 percent of revenue came from detractors.
	
So how much revenue is too much from detractors? While that depends on 
the industry and the switching costs (more competition leaves less room for 
detractors), a common threshold is to obtain no more than 10 percent of rev-
enue from detractors.
	
If more than 10 percent of company or product revenue comes from detrac-
tors, there are two things you can probably do:
	
✓	Stop selling to these customers. While that may seem crazy, in some 
cases, getting rid of mismatched customers may better your reputation 
and increase your profits in the long run.
	
✓	Find out the reasons these customers are spreading negative word of 
mouth and attempt to fix it:
	
•	Start by analyzing the comments of these detractors in surveys to 
identify the low-hanging fruit.
	
•	Next, conduct a key driver analysis using multiple regression to 
understand what factors in their experience have the biggest effect on 
customers’ likelihood to recommend.
	
	Understanding the reasons for detractors is the first step. Doing some-
thing about the information is usually a lot harder because it often 
involves adjusting the price, quality, and features to meet the customers’ 
expectations. But that’s usually what separates the best-in-class compa-
nies from the rest — their ability to make changes based on data.

Part III: Analytics for the Customer Journey 
Working with the NPS
The Net Promoter Score is a useful but imper-
fect tool. It is used in numerous companies. In 
fact, some companies take it so seriously that 
they pay bonuses based on how much they 
manage to increase their Net Promoter Scores. 
While it has often been referred to as the “only 
number you need,” it has some drawbacks:
	✓	People are poor predictors of their own 
behavior. The Net Promoter Score is meant 
to be a forward-looking indicator: Without 
looking at any actual facts, the score is 
solely based on what customers say they 
will do. However, just because people say 
they will do something doesn’t mean they 
will.
	
	 As a way to gauge how many customers 
who say they will actually recommend a 
product or website, you can also ask cus-
tomers if they have in the last 12 months. 
This percentage most likely differs sub-
stantially from the percentage of customers 
saying they will recommend. But it’s less 
important to nail down the exact number 
of customers who will actually recommend 
than to understand how that estimate, with 
its imperfections, differs across compa-
nies and products. As with most measures, 
scores make much more sense when 
compared.
	✓	The scoring inflates the margin of error: 
By converting an 11-point scale into a 
2-point scale of detractors and promoters 
(throwing out the passives), information is 
lost. What’s more, this new binary scale 
doubles the margin of error around the 
net score (promoters minus detractors). 
Unfortunately, that means that if you want 
to show an improvement in Net Promoter 
Scores over time, it takes a sample size that 
is around twice as large to calculate the dif-
ference; otherwise, the difference won’t be 
distinguishable from the sampling error.
	✓	Some organizations look at NPS dash-
boards and investigate why the NPS has 
gone up or down over a period of time. In 
too many cases, adding some error bars 
to the graphs shows that the changes 
are within the margin of error. The simple 
work-around is to use the raw mean and 
standard deviation when running statisti-
cal comparisons. The mean likelihood to 
recommend responses can predict the Net 
Promoter Score quite well. You can use the 
net scoring system for the executives, but 
use the raw data for the statistics.
	✓	Use other ways of measuring customer 
loyalty. While the NPS is sold as the “only” 
measure you need, there are other ways of 
measuring customer loyalty and customers’ 
likelihood to recommend.
	
	 For example, if you’re interested in esti-
mating how many customers are likely 
to positively or negatively talk about your 
company, take a look at another way to 
measure word of mouth, called the word 
of mouth index (WoMI) from Larry Freed. It 
distinguishes between positive and nega-
tive word of mouth by asking customers 
both the likelihood to recommend question 
and if they would discourage others from 
doing business with a company. Top 100 
U.S. brands, the WoMI index score, and the 
Net Promoter Scores have a high average 
correlation of r = .8.

 Chapter 12: Measuring Customer Loyalty
Finding Key Drivers of Loyalty
One of the most effective ways to understand what drives customer loyalty 
is to conduct a key driver analysis. A key driver analysis uses a statistical 
technique employing multiple regression analysis. It tells you which features 
or aspects of a product or service have the largest statistical impact on cus-
tomer loyalty. It can be conducted for all customers but also for each of your 
different customer segments (see Chapter 2 for more on finding customer 
segments).
Here are three steps to conducting a key driver analysis:
	
1.	Obtain a baseline set of Net Promoter Scores (or whatever measure of 
loyalty you use).
	
	 If you aren’t doing so already, survey your customers to get a current 
baseline of how likely customers are to recommend the product to a 
friend. Ask the 11-point LTR (short for “likely to recommend”) ques-
tion about both the brand and the product. In fact, you can extend the 
LTR question down to feature and functional areas if you have a lot of 
functionalities. Include an open-ended question to ask what’s driving 
users to give the ratings they gave. These surveys should be conducted 
monthly or quarterly or set up to collect data in some systematic way. 
You can email customers, use a pop-up window on the website, or use a 
third party to gain perspective. Ideally, use all three approaches — they 
all provide different perceptions of the experience.
	
	 Ask a handful of key questions about features and functions: Many prod-
ucts and websites have vast amounts of features and functions. While 
you can’t expect to obtain detailed metrics for every one of these, you 
should be able to collect data at a level that allows you to narrow your 
focus. For example, are poor quality reviews, advertisements, check-out 
forms, or shipping costs driving detractors?
	
2.	Conduct a multiple regression analysis.
	
	 With the NPS scores and items about features and the experience, you 
likely can identify the pool of candidates who are driving word of mouth 
for better or worse.
	
	 To determine which are having the biggest impact, you can use a multi-
variate technique called multiple regression analysis. It can determine 
statistically what aspects are having the biggest impact on NPS and 
allow you to prioritize. More details on conducting a key driver analysis 
are provided in the appendix.
	
	 The chart in Figure 12-4 shows an output of a key driver analysis for a 
publishing company’s educational software product. Over 3,000 custom-
ers were asked to rate their satisfaction on 20 features and aspects of 
the product, including its speed, accuracy, and usability. Customers’

impressions of usability had the largest impact on their likelihood to rec-
ommend this software product to friends and colleagues. What’s more, 
their overall satisfaction with the usability was relatively low (at about 
75%), indicating that poor usability is reducing the probability that cus-
tomers will recommend the product.
	
3.	Identify the most popular or unpopular features or aspects of your 
product or service and have customers rate that experience as well.
	
Figure 12-4: 
Output of a 
key driver 
analysis 
from a 
web-based 
software 
application.
	
By understanding both the value of positive word of mouth and the cost of 
negative word of mouth, you can estimate the net value of word of mouth for 
a product or services for a group, or for all customers.
Valuing positive word of mouth
While companies should strive to obtain as many promoters as possible, 
it’s often helpful to understand how valuable a promoter is, both in terms of 
revenue and in how many new customers a promoter brings to a company. 
With the lifetime value of a customer understood (see Chapter 6), money and 
effort can be spent to turn detractors and passives into promoters if it makes 
financial sense.
The best way to understand how much revenue a promoter generates is to 
tie actual sales to survey responses to see how many promoters actually rec-
ommended someone, and how many of those people who heard the recom-
mendation actually became customers.

 Chapter 12: Measuring Customer Loyalty
Reading a key-driver chart
Here’s how to read a key-driver chart, such as 
the one shown in Figure 12-4. In this case, it’s 
a chart showing the relationship between two 
variables, customer satisfaction with a feature, 
and how much the feature contributes to cus-
tomer loyalty:
	✓	The vertical (y-axis) in Figure 12-4 shows 
the relative importance of each item, 
using the beta coefficient from the multiple 
regression analysis.
	
	 This is a standard output that your statisti-
cian and most statistical programs provide. 
It tells you how much each item contrib-
utes to the users’ likelihood to recommend. 
For example, the customers’ satisfaction 
with the usability of the software was the 
biggest driver (highest on the y-axis). A 
one-point increase in satisfaction with 
usability results in a .55-increase in custom-
ers’ likelihood to recommend.
	
	 Usability is about five times as important 
as the next most important driver, stability, 
which increases likelihood to recommend 
by .12 points for every point increase in cus-
tomer satisfaction.
	✓	The horizontal axis (x-axis) shows the rela-
tive customer satisfaction with each feature.
	
	 For example, a particular feature of the 
software (Feature C) has the highest rela-
tive satisfaction of the drivers, at around 87 
percent compared to the other features. It 
has a smaller impact on customer loyalty, 
likely driving positive word of mouth.
Common key drivers of customer loyalty
What customers value in your company may 
vary widely. Results of NPS surveys across 
multiple industries reveal that four main areas 
affect customer loyalty:
	✓	Quality: Are you products and services of a 
high quality or are they unreliable and don’t 
work as expected?
	✓	Value: Customers don’t like to feel ripped 
off and like a bargain (some segments more 
than others). The total cost and the price 
relative to what customers receive for their 
money can generate a lot of detractors 
or promoters, especially for business-to- 
consumer products and services.
	✓	Utility: Do your products offer all the 
essential features your customers need 
and value? A product doesn’t have to do 
everything, but it should do the right things 
for your customers.
	✓	Ease of Use: A product or website can have 
all the bells and whistles, but if it’s hard to 
use, or an otherwise frustrating experience, 
the features might as well not work.

Part III: Analytics for the Customer Journey 
However, the databases in many companies can be so fragmented that con-
necting customer survey data to sales data is too difficult. It isn’t that it’s 
technically difficult; it’s usually because the data and initiatives are owned 
by different teams (usually marketing and IT) who work on different projects. 
But Owen and Brooks, in their book Answering the Ultimate Question (pub-
lished by Jossey-Bass), provide a good way to estimate the value of a pro-
moter from survey data alone.
Here are six steps to estimate the value of a promoter from customer survey 
data.
	
1.	Positively Referred: Ask all customers in a survey if they recall actually 
referring anyone to consider using a product or service in the past year. 
People have notoriously inaccurate memories but this can give you a 
rough idea of a historic referral rate.
	
	 As shown in the upper-left corner of Figure 12-5, it was 61% from a 
sample of TurboTax customers (2011 data).
	
Figure 12-5: 
The esti-
mated 
value of a 
promoter 
from data 
collected 
on the tax 
preparation 
software 
TurboTax.
	
	
2.	Conversion Rate: Ask each customer if a friend or colleague referred 
him/her to the product. Again, memories are faulty, but this gives you 
some idea about the percentage of current customers who visited the 
website or purchased the product or service based on a referral.
	
	 For TurboTax, it was 42%.
	
3.	Referral Impact: By multiplying the percentage that made a positive 
referral by the percent of current customers who were referred, you have 
an idea about the number of customers you get through each referral.
	
	 0.61 x 0.42 = 0.2562

 Chapter 12: Measuring Customer Loyalty
	
	 Note: The slight difference from 25% shown in Figure 12-5 to 25.62% is 
due to rounding.
	
4.	Referrals Needed: Because there aren’t quarters of people walking 
around, it helps to get a whole number of customers you need to gener-
ate a referral.
	
	 Dividing 1 by the referral impact gets you the total number of referrals 
you need to generate one new customer, like this:
	
	 1/0.25 = 4
	
5.	Promoter Referral Rate: Keep in mind that despite the guidance that 
answers of 9’s and 10’s are more likely to recommend a website or 
product, it doesn’t necessarily mean all the respondents actually will 
recommend.
	
	 While people’s ability to recall past behavior can be poor, their ability 
to predict future behavior is even worse. To help account for that uncer-
tainty, look at which promoters say they referred someone else in the 
last year and use that as a proxy for those who are more likely to refer 
someone in the future.
	
	 I also call this the Promoter Efficiency Rate.
	
	 For TurboTax, 81% of the sample of promoters said they referred some-
one else to the product in the last year.
	
6.	Promoters Needed: By dividing the Referral Impact Rate by the Promoter 
Referral Rate, you get the number of promoters needed to gain a new 
customer.
	
	 This works out to be five new promoters needed to generate one new 
TurboTax customer.
With some estimate of the number of promoters you need to gain a new 
customer, you can then weigh the cost of new programs, features, pricing, 
and promotions to determine if the benefit from new customers outweighs 
the cost. For websites, a new “customer” might just be a new visitor or sub-
scriber, so the cost of gaining new promoters can be important.
	
The estimates used in the preceding TurboTax example are based on survey 
data and, therefore, aren’t as reliable as actual internal numbers. If actual 
referral rates or conversion rates are available from historical data, then those 
can be used to supplement or supplant the survey data. Keep in mind that 
past behavior is no guarantee of future success, so having data on the past 
and potential future is a prudent approach.
	
With any survey data comes a margin of error because you almost always are 
dealing with a small fraction of the customer population. As an added step, I 
also like to compute a conservative estimate of the value of the promoter. For 
the boxes labeled “Positively Referred,” “Conversion Rate,” and “Promoter 
Referral Rate,” I also use the lower boundary of the confidence interval.

Part III: Analytics for the Customer Journey 
For example, from the sample of 117 TurboTax customers surveyed, while 
61% said they referred someone in the past year, the 90% confidence interval 
is 52% to 68%. So the more conservative estimate is to use the lower end of 
52% instead of the average of 61%.
Valuing negative word of mouth
While companies should strive for more promoters, it’s often the customers 
who are least satisfied with their experience who have a much larger impact 
on referrals and the brand. Research supports that customers who are dis-
satisfied with a product or service experience are actually more likely to be 
vocal and tell more friends and colleagues about their bad experience than 
generally satisfied customers.
	
For example, I have been an avid user of the online personal finance website 
Mint.com for years. Its website allows you to see your personal and small-
business finances, expenses, and investments all in one place. Unfortunately, 
the product team recently turned off the small-business categorization feature 
with no notice to customers. This meant hundreds of hours of logging small-
business expenses were lost and unrecoverable. Understandably, a lot of loyal 
customers were upset and let the company know. While it’s unclear what will 
happen to the product, the experience has been so frustrating that I’ve shared 
it with at least a dozen close friends who manage small businesses and track 
their personal finances with Mint.com. This one change turned a promoter 
into a detractor.
The negative effects of detractors can outweigh the positive effects of pro-
moters. You can estimate this negative effect by using a similar procedure for 
estimating the value of promoters.
	
1.	Negative Word of Mouth Rate: Ask all customers in a survey if they 
recall actually discouraging anyone from using or purchasing the prod-
uct. Convert this to a percentage.
	
	 For example, if 20 out of 100 people discouraged someone else from 
using the product, the rate is 20%.
	
2.	Number Discouraged: Ask customers to estimate approximately how 
many people they discouraged from purchasing.
	
	 If you don’t have this information from customers, use the number 4 as a 
placeholder. There’s some evidence that dissatisfied customers tell on 
average four friends and colleagues about their poor experience.
	
3.	Conversion Rate: Use the same conversion rate used in estimating the 
value of a promoter. This is calculated as the percent of respondents 
(from a survey) that were referred to a product by a friend or colleague.
	
	 In the TurboTax example, it is 42%.

 Chapter 12: Measuring Customer Loyalty
	
4.	Cost of Discouragement: Multiply these values to compute the cost of a 
discouragement:
	
•	Negative word of mouth rate
	
•	Number discouraged
	
•	Conversion rate
	
	 For this example, the negative word of mouth rate (20%), the number 
discouraged (4), and the conversion rate (.42) work out to be 34%.
	
	 You can divide 1 by this number to get the number of discouragements 
that result in one lost customer. In this case, it’s 3.
	
5.	Detractor Discouragement Rate: Not all detractors will discourage cus-
tomers from using a company’s product, especially those detractors 
who score higher, such as 5’s and 6’s on the LTR question. Find the per-
centage of detractors who also negatively referred to friends from the 
survey data.
	
	 Use as an example that roughly 50% of detractors actually discouraged 
others. Divide 3 by 50%, and you get 6. That means for every six detrac-
tors, on average one customer is lost. The calculations are shown in 
Figure 12-6.

agement

Developing Products That 
Customers Want
In This Chapter
▶	Ranking customers’ top tasks
▶	Matching company needs to customers’ needs
▶	Discovering opportunities to delight customers
I
 
f you build it, they will come. At least you hope so! Understanding what 
customers want and what they will purchase is one of the holy grails of 
product development and is rife with analytics to help improve the process. 
Your product must meet customer needs (or perceived needs) better than 
your competition’s and at a comparable or better price.
One of the most effective ways to produce products and experiences that 
customers want is to first understand what customers want to accomplish. 
For software products, that can be tasks such as accurately filing taxes, cre-
ating professional looking movies from raw clips, or organizing and sharing 
photos. For physical products, this can be tasks such as recording a show to 
a DVR, drilling a hole in concrete, or painting a room faster. For websites, cus-
tomers are usually looking to answer questions or to accomplish tasks like 
purchasing a product or paying a bill online.
	
Some of the most innovative products don’t come from what customers are 
asking for, but instead fixing problems with existing products and services.
In this chapter, I cover several methods to help you define and prioritize 
what features to include in your products.
Gathering Input on Product Features
Even if you already have a list of tasks and features ready to prioritize, here 
are four additional sources to come up with data (also see Chapter 7).

Part IV: Analytics for Product Development 
	
✓	Stakeholder interviews: Start with the people who know the product 
and customers the best. Sales and support teams hear complaints and 
probably have a lot of ideas about what customers want. In fact, there are 
probably already long lists of feature requests, bug fixes, enhancements, 
and wish lists. Combine and mine these to generate a list of requirements.
	
✓	Follow me home: A technique I learned while working at the software 
company Intuit was “follow me home.” You literally follow a customer 
home or to his workplace and then spend the day watching him do his 
job. Look for pain points and problems in how he does his job to look for 
opportunities of improvement.
	
	During one such follow-me-home, a team of researchers noticed that 
retail customers were exporting their transactions from their point-of-
sale cash registers into QuickBooks to manage their books. This extra 
step took time and could cause problems if done incorrectly. The devel-
opers came up with the idea of integrating QuickBooks with a cash regis-
ter that eliminated a step for customers.
	
✓	Customer interviews: Ask customers directly about the types of prob-
lems they have and the features they think they need. Customers can be 
notoriously bad at articulating what they want. A skilled facilitator can 
ask questions in a way that gets at the underlying root of the problem. 
Have customers describe a typical day as they encounter your product 
(or any type of product).
	
	Use the 5 Why’s technique when interviewing customers. It’s a question-
asking technique that explores the cause-and-effect relationship that 
underlies a problem. See www.isixsigma.com/tools-templates/
cause-effect/determine-root-cause-5-whys/ for more informa-
tion on the 5 Why’s technique.
	
✓	Voice of customer survey: A voice of customer survey allows customers 
to provide direct feedback about existing products by answering a few 
survey questions. These surveys are one of the most cost-effective ways 
of gathering feedback about customers’ experiences with your products 
and services.
Finding Customers’ Top Tasks
While there are hundreds to thousands of things users can accomplish on 
websites and software interfaces, there are a critical few tasks that drive 
users to visit a website or use a software or product.
Think of all the features Microsoft Word provides. It supports document edit-
ing, mail merging, desktop publishing, and a full range of HTML. By one esti-
mate, it has around 1,200 features. Now think of the most important features 
that you need when you create or edit a document — the features you couldn’t 
live without. These features likely support your top tasks.

 Chapter 13: Developing Products That Customers Want
Prioritizing tasks is not a new concept. Having users rank what’s important is 
a technique that’s been used extensively in marketing and conjoint analysis 
(I cover this topic later in this chapter). But having users force-rank hundreds or 
thousands of features individually would be too tedious for even the most dili-
gent of users (or even the most sophisticated, choice-based conjoint software).
In the following sections, I outline the steps on how to prioritize your top tasks.
Listing the tasks
Identify the features, content, and functionality you want people to consider. 
The tasks can be specific to a website or to a class of websites. For example, 
here are a few things you can do on a healthcare insurance company website:
	
✓	Look up the address of a doctor.
	
✓	Find the office hours of a doctor.
	
✓	See if a healthcare provider accepts your insurance.
	
Avoid internal jargon as much as possible and make sure tasks are phrased as 
something a person can relate to and that are actionable.
The total number of tasks you need depends on how focused and extensive the 
functionality you are testing is. A broader experience (an entire e-commerce 
website) will have more tasks compared to a more focused experience (for 
example, on-demand videos for a cable provider). You might have as few as 20 
or as many as 150.
Finding customers
Recruit a representative set of customers to determine the top tasks. As with all 
sampling methods, be sure the participants who take your study share the same 
characteristics as the larger customer base you are making inferences about.
The following table shows the sample size you’d need to have a desired 
margin of error (plus or minus around each percentage). For example, to 
achieve a margin of error of approximately plus or minus 7%, you should 
plan on a sample size of around 136. This percentage is based on the 
assumption that the percentage will fall at around 50%, at a 90% level of 
confidence (see Chapter 2 for details about confidence levels).
In top-tasks analysis, most items will actually only be selected by a small per-
centage of users, making the sample sizes shown on the high side for most 
of the items. In other words, this is a worst-case scenario sample size and 
means that sample sizes as low as ten customers still provide insights.

Selecting five tasks
Present the enumerated list of tasks in random order to representative custom-
ers using software. You want to randomize because customers don’t consider 
tasks individually, but scan your list for recognizable key words. With a random-
ized list, tasks have an equal chance of being near the top or bottom of the list.
	
You can use software to randomize the order of your tasks. UserZoom and 
SurveyMonkey are two that allow you to randomize.
Have users pick their top five tasks from the list.
	
It’s hard to know every task a customer would like to accomplish. Therefore, 
include an “Other” option so customers can provide their own top task.
There’s nothing sacred about picking 5; it’s just a good number that works 
when you have 50 or more tasks. With fewer tasks, say 20 to 30, you can 
adjust the number down to 3 for users to select. This ensures users are 
forced to pick the really important tasks from the nice-to-have tasks.
Graphing and analyzing
After you collect the results of your survey, follow these steps to compute 
the customers’ top tasks:
	
1.	Count the votes each task received.
	
2.	Divide the vote total by the number of participants who voted.
	
	 This gives you the percent of times a task was selected.
	
3.	Sort the tasks by percentage in descending order.

The characteristic shape of the top-task graph is the “long neck” of the vital 
few tasks your customers care about. Figure 13-1 shows four examples. 
Notice the handful of tasks that really stand out near the left side of each 
graph? They are the top tasks.
	
Figure 13-1: 
The long 
neck of the 
popular and 
least popu-
lar tasks.
	
You also see the long tail of the trivial tasks that are less important. Of 
course, you can’t just stop supporting your less important tasks, but you 
should be sure that customers can complete top tasks effectively and effi-
ciently. These top tasks should become the core tasks you conduct bench-
mark tests around and the basis for design efforts.
You can also add confidence intervals around top-tasks graphs to help stake-
holders understand the margin of error around each item. This way, if there 
are strong opinions about how important or trivial a task is, one or two votes 
in general won’t matter statistically. Figure 13-2 shows a larger version of the 
graph from Figure 13-1, with 90% confidence intervals. The gap after the fifth 
task (and the non-overlap in the confidence intervals) provides a good break-
ing point for prioritization. This particular top-tasks study was around what 
features consumers look for when researching consumer electronic devices 
on their smartphone.
Taking an internal view
Have the internal team working on the product also take the top-tasks analysis. 
This can be product managers, executives, designers, and developers. Compare

these results with the customers’ top tasks. Identify areas where there is agree-
ment or disagreement. Where the two groups agree are the areas you should 
focus your attention.

But can’t I just look at Google Analytics?
For websites and even software products, 
log files record the pages and screens where 
customers visit and spend the most time. It 
would seem that this would eliminate the 
need for conducting a top-tasks analysis. And 
although resources like Google Analytics (see 
Chapter 10) will tell where customers are going, 
they don’t do a good job of telling you why. This 
is best illustrated in an example with an auto-
motive information company I worked with.
When we collected the tasks to prioritize in a 
top-tasks analysis for the website, a product 
manager said that he knew what customers 
wanted and were doing. In looking at the log 
files, most page views and time were spent on 
the Car Details page. The problem was that 
while customers did go to the Car Details page, 
we didn’t know why they were going there or 
even which, if any, of the dozens of car details 
customers were driven to.
Using the top-tasks analysis, we found that the 
top task that customers wanted was informa-
tion about each car’s fuel efficiency. The only 
place that information existed was on the Car 
Details page! This top-tasks analysis led the 
design team to place the Miles per Gallon infor-
mation on the Car Summary page.

 Chapter 13: Developing Products That Customers Want
Conducting a Gap Analysis
A complementary approach to the top-tasks analysis is a gap analysis. With 
a gap analysis, you understand how important customers find a feature and 
how satisfied they are with it in completing their tasks. If you have an existing 
customer base of people who have experience with a product (or competitive 
product), a gap analysis is what you need.
A gap analysis is a survey using two sets of items to be rated: importance and 
satisfaction.
	
Keep it to a smaller set of features or tasks than the top-tasks analysis, 
because you’re asking participants to rate each item twice.
To conduct a gap analysis, follow these steps.
	
1.	Have customers rate how important a particular function or task is, 
using a numbered scale anchored with Not at all important to Very 
important.
	
	 A 7-point scale is popular, but almost any number from 5 to 11 will work.
	
2.	Ask customers to rate how satisfied they are with the same features 
using the current product.
	
	 Use the same numbered scale from Not at all satisfied (1) to Very satis-
fied (7).
	
3.	Use the following formula on each participant’s task/feature scores: 
Importance + (Importance – Satisfaction).
	
	 This will reveal the “gap” or opportunity for improvement. This formula 
provides both a prioritization of features and also gives a higher score to 
features that are rated higher in importance.
An example of tasks and functionality for a web-based email system and some 
sample data are shown in the following table. Notice how the feature “Add con-
tacts to an address book easily” and “Search for messages older than 6 months” 
both have the same “gap” in the Importance – Satisfaction column. But because 
adding contacts was rated as more important than searching for older mes-
sages (a 7 versus a 4), it gets a higher priority score (a 10 compared to a 7).

Mapping Business Needs to 
Customer Requirements
Techniques like the gap analysis help prioritize the features from the cus-
tomers’ perspective. But it’s also important to consider the organization’s 
priorities. One such technique is Quality Function Deployment (QFD). QFD is 
a structured way to prioritize features, functions, or even website content by 
taking into account both business priorities (the voice of the company) and 
the customer/user priorities (the voice of the customer).
QFD separates what you do from the how you do it. In the rush to complete 
long lists of feature requests, it’s easy to lose sight of what customers need.
The QFD’s main output is a decision matrix, which looks like a house 
(see Figure 13-3). You might hear “house of quality” used interchangeably 
with QFD.
The following sections show you how to build a QFD, using an example of a 
website redesign for a multinational electronics company that sells through 
channel partners.
This is a simple QFD that balances the internal need to build and improve 
with a clear prioritized top-tasks list of customers. It helps narrow the scope 
and improve the quality of redesign.
	
You can build a more advanced QFD by incorporating competitive informa-
tion, specifications, and positive and negative relationships between the 
“How’s.” Adding each of these parts to the house takes extra time, but it can 
be worth it depending on the complexity and consequences of the project.

Identifying customers’ wants and needs
Brainstorm as many possible features, functions, and task-based activities 
that customers would want to do. Look at the competition, survey and inter-
view existing and former customers, review call center data, and interview 
stakeholders. These are your “What’s.”
For an informational-based website, most customer requirements are the 
tasks that users attempt, so a good task analysis can help identify these.
Here’s a selection of some tasks from the B2B electronics website:
	
✓	Find detailed technical specifications (like CPU and power 
consumption).
	
✓	Find and download drivers.
	
✓	Contact a salesperson.
	
✓	Have a personalized profile to save products I’m interested in.
	
✓	View products for an industry (for example, entertainment or medical).
	
✓	Share my purchase with others.

Part IV: Analytics for Product Development 
Identifying the voice of the customer
Ask customers to tell you what they think is important, not what you want 
them to think is important. An essential part of this step is realizing that 
everything can’t be important. If you ask customers and users what’s impor-
tant, they will often tell you everything is important. You need a way to force 
users to choose which tasks are really important and which features are nice 
to have.
	
You can get sophisticated with conjoint analysis, but the fastest and easiest 
way to get a forced rank is to run a top-tasks analysis or a gap analysis, as 
explained in the previous sections.
Use the average importance rating or the percent of users who pick each task 
as the weights in the QFD. Use higher numbers to indicate higher importance, 
so if you use ranks, reverse them so a “1” represents the least important. The 
following table shows the relative rank and the percent of users who picked 
the task as one of their top five (out of 35 possible tasks) in a top-tasks 
survey.

power consumption).

tainment or medical).

Identifying the How’s (the 
voice of the company)
Either use existing lists of enhancements and fixes or generate a new list 
based on the customer rankings.
The following are some example “How’s” for the electronics website:
	
✓	Integrate Facebook and Twitter into the product pages to promote 
sharing.
	
✓	Improve the search function and search results.

✓	Integrate product videos.
	
✓	Provide 3D rotation of products.
	
✓	Add a customization feature.
	
✓	Add a Filter by Location.
	
✓	Integrate detailed product specs and drivers from the main product 
page.
Building the relationship between the 
customer and company voices
Next determine how each “How” impacts each customer “What,” using the 
following scale:
9 = Direct and strong relationship
3 = Moderate relationship
1 = Weak/Indirect relationship
Blank = no relationship
The 1’s, 3’s, and 9’s are mostly a convention and help accentuate the differ-
ences when you prioritize. Place each value in the cell where the “What” and 
the “How” meet, and leave the cell blank if there’s no relationship.
In the example, “Integrate Facebook and Twitter buttons into the product 
pages” has a strong association with “Share my purchases with others.” 
Something like product videos will probably have a modest impact on 
detailed specifications because users could view the products to get a better 
sense of size and even see what external ports are supported.
Figure 13-4 shows the “What’s” and the “How’s” and the relationships 
between the two in the cells, with higher numbers indicating a stronger rela-
tionship, and blank cells meaning no relationship.
Generating priorities
Multiply the importance by the relationship and add up each sum in the 
“How” columns. The sum of each column represents the overall magnitude 
that each feature/function will have on the customer. Higher numbers repre-
sent more of an impact.

and the 
voice of the 
company 
(the How’s) 
across the 
top.
	
The actual value of each of the totaled columns is less important than the 
relative ranking, which the tool also calculates. For example, “Find detailed 
technical specifications” (a “what”) has a weight of 80 and “Improve the 
search functionality and results” (a “how”) has a strong relationship of a 9. 
This cell generates a score of 9 × 80 = 720. “View products for an industry” 
(a “what”) has a weight of 13 and has a weak relationship with “Improve 
the search function and results.” This cell has a score of 13 × 1 = 13. The 
search feature raw score is found by adding these two cell scores, 720 + 
13 = 733, which is the second-highest score relative to the other features 
considered.
Examining priorities
You should see gaps between features. The two highest ranked features (inte-
grating the product specs and improving search) are well above the next five. 
A blank row means that a customer want isn’t supported. That isn’t neces-
sarily a bad thing if it’s a low priority task. In this example, none of the new 
features supported “Contact a salesperson.” Assuming adding the contact 
information doesn’t introduce new problems, it would also be a good addi-
tion to the redesign.

Measuring Customer Delight 
with the Kano Model
Differentiating a product from the competition often isn’t about just meeting 
customer needs — it’s about exceeding those needs and expectations.
Beyond a set of expected features, some features so exceed expectations that 
they “delight” customers into purchasing, repurchasing, and recommending 
a product. The Kano model helps differentiate between features customers 
expect and features that delight customers. For example, customers expect 
cars to be reliable and include features like power steering, radios, and air-
conditioning. Up until the early 1980’s, cup holders in vehicles were after-
market add-ons. Cup holders, and the total number of cup holders, became a 
feature that delighted customers, so they were integrated into minivans and 
then to every type of car.
Named after Japanese professor Noriaki Kano, the Kano model is based on 
asking customers two questions about features. Features are categorized into 
one of six groupings.
	
✓	Delighting: The feature provides extra satisfaction when present but 
does not harm when absent.
	
✓	One-dimensional: The more of the feature the better.
	
✓	Must-Haves: Lack of the feature would lead to dissatisfaction.
	
✓	Indifferent Attribute: Customers don’t care about the feature and it nei-
ther increases nor decreases customer satisfaction.
	
✓	Reverse: Including this feature leads to dissatisfaction.
	
✓	Questionable: Conflicting customer responses make it unclear whether 
this feature adds or detracts from satisfaction.
Here are the steps to take to understand what customers expect and what 
delights them:
	
1.	Aggregate the features in a similar way as you do for a gap analysis 
and top-tasks analysis.
	
	 The features should be articulated in a way that is meaningful to a cus-
tomer, so avoid using internal company jargon and acronyms unless cus-
tomers also use them.
	
2.	For each feature, ask participants two questions.
	
	 The first is called the functional question: What are your feelings when 
the feature is included?

Part IV: Analytics for Product Development 
	
	 The second is called the dysfunctional question: What are your feelings 
when this feature is NOT included?
	
	 For both questions use the following 5-point response scale:
	
	1 = I like it that way.
	
	2 = It must be that way.
	
	3 = I am neutral.
	
	4 = I can live with it that way.
	
	5 = I dislike it that way.
	
3.	Tabulate the responses.
	
	 Table 13-1 shows how to score the responses to assign them one of the 
six categories. For example, if a customer responds to the functional 
question toward a feature as “I like it” and responds “I can live with it 
that way” for the dysfunctional question, the feature is a delighter. In 
comparison, if a customer responds to the functional question toward a 
feature as “Neutral” and responds “I like it” for the dysfunctional ques-
tion, the feature is a reverse (less of it in the product).

Assessing the Value of Each 
Combination of Features
A more advanced method that identifies both the value (called the utility) 
and the optimal combination of individual features is called conjoint analysis. 
Where the Kano analysis identifies which features delight or dissatisfy cus-
tomers individually, conjoint analysis identifies how the addition and reduc-
tion of features presented in more realistic combinations will lead to more or 
less interest in purchasing a product.

A conjoint analysis uses more advanced statistics and is usually done with 
software from companies like Survey Analytics (www.surveyanalytics.
com), QuestionPro (www.questionpro.com), or Sawtooth Software (www.
sawtoothsoftware.com).
To conduct a choice-based conjoint, you enter all the features, including 
price, into the software. These features are presented to customers in a 
survey format and the pairing of features helps identify how much each fea-
ture contributes to likelihood to purchase.
Kano airline analysis
My company recently ran a Kano analysis on how customers feel about the airline travel experi-
ence and features. One hundred participants who flew in the last year completed the survey. They 
rated the following items, using the two Kano questions:
Wi-Fi onboard
Full meal service
Free drinks (Non-alcoholic)
Purchase snacks on board
Extra legroom
Duty-free items for sale
Free carry-ons
Pillows and blankets
Free checked bag
Reclining seats
Early boarding
No change fees on tickets
In-seat TVs
Pick seat when booking online
We tabulated the responses by feature; two examples are shown in the following table. For exam-
ple, for having Wi-Fi Internet access onboard the airplane, 22% found that feature delighting and 
35% were indifferent toward it. In contrast, 33% of participants rated the Free Checked Bag as one- 
dimensional, meaning more free checked bags the better. Eighteen percent rated a free checked 
bag as a must-have and 14% would be delighted by that feature.

Through a mathematical combination of features presented to the customer, 
the software identifies which features have the biggest impact on likelihood-
to-purchase scores. This uses a similar statistical approach as the key drivers 
analysis described in Chapters 9 and 12.
Finding Out Why Problems Occur
Sometimes the best improvement that you can make to a product is not 
adding more features but instead, fixing features that don’t work well or other 
problems with the experience that lead to undesirable outcomes.
A technique that works well for understanding the negative impacts of unde-
sirable actions is the Failure Mode Effects Analysis (FMEA).
Things go wrong quite frequently in the customer experience, both online 
and elsewhere. Customers forget their passwords, install printers incorrectly, 
and experience long wait times on customer support. They are unable to 
find products, they take too long to make a purchase, and their information 
can be stolen. While you ultimately want a great customer experience, mea-
suring poor experiences helps you understand how to prevent things from 
going wrong and generate better experiences. The following case study walks 
through an example of using an FMEA to identify problems with an online 
experience. It can be applied to offline experiences, too.

 Chapter 13: Developing Products That Customers Want
Imagine you’re interested in buying a new car. Should you trade yours in or 
try and sell it yourself? Either way, you want the most money for your car, 
and knowing its true value is essential information. Many websites (for exam-
ple, Edmunds, Kelley Blue Book, Autotrader, and Cars.com) offer a tool that 
tells you how much your car is worth.
The task seems simple: Enter your make and model, condition, and mileage, 
and like the Magic 8 ball, you get a value. Of course, a number of details com-
plicate the process and things can go wrong. You can pick the wrong make, 
be unable to accurately describe the condition or understand automotive 
jargon, or leave off features — or the entire process can take so long that you 
finally give up.
Applying the FMEA in finding the value of your car can help the designers of 
these websites prevent nuisances and failures (such as taking longer to find 
the value of your car, or getting the incorrect value altogether).
To conduct an FMEA, follow these steps:
	
1.	Identify the steps in the process.
	
	 Break down a typical scenario into small steps to identify failure points 
or bottlenecks. Ideally, you can do this by watching the path users go 
down from a usability test (see Chapter 14) or from existing data.
	
2.	Identify what can go wrong.
	
	 Here’s where recording poor experiences comes in handy. Are users 
taking too long, getting the wrong car value, making errors, or not 
recommending the website or product because of pricing or policies? 
Usability problem lists with severity ratings can be especially helpful in 
identifying the sort of failures you want to avoid. Are users entering the 
wrong make, picking the wrong condition, getting slowed down by too 
many pages or intrusive ads, or are they stopping at a preliminary esti-
mate before getting the right value? Use any and all data sources to get 
a good picture about problems. These sources include call center data, 
surveys, third-party reports, former customers, and competitive data.
	
3.	Determine how common the problems are.
	
	 Not all problems affect all users. Watch just a handful of users in a 
usability test and you’ll see that some users struggle with one step 
while others breeze through all of them. For example, in a test of the 
Enterprise Rental Car website, most users had a problem finding the 
total price for their rental car, while only a few users had difficulty 
picking the correct car type. For the FMEA, rank problems from least 
common (assigned a 1) to most common (assigned a 10). Even if a prob-
lem isn’t terribly harmful, if most users encounter it, it can be worth 
addressing.

Part IV: Analytics for Product Development 
	
4.	Determine how severe the problems are.
	
	 Just because a problem affects a small percentage of users doesn’t mean 
that it isn’t a big deal. If a few users are getting the wrong car value and 
losing money on their trade-in, the negative experience can snowball 
after the dissatisfied customers tell their friends. In the FMEA, prioritize 
the severity of the problem from cosmetic/minor (assigned a 1) to lead-
ing to task failure, loss of money, or loss of life as a 10. The rankings are 
largely context dependent, so don’t get bent out of shape arguing over 
whether a problem is a 4 or 5.
	
5.	Identify how hard the problems are to detect.
	
	 Some of the most pernicious problems are the ones that are hard to 
detect. If a problem is harder to detect, it’s harder to diagnose and pre-
vent. It’s like when you take your car to the mechanic because of the 
noise it’s making, but when the mechanic goes to listen, it’s fine.
	
	 For example, the wording of a condition of a car might confuse users 
trading in a certain model and year as well as those who have never 
traded a car in before. Or, the layout of an interface might only affect 
users on old versions of Internet Explorer with low resolution screens. 
Like the previous two steps, assign problems that are easiest to detect 
as 1’s and the hardest to detect as 10’s.
	
	 When in doubt, use a 5, and then change the rating when you feel more 
confident about how easy or difficult it is to detect. Using a 5 has the 
effect of neutralizing the detection aspect of the FMEA, and this gives 
more weight to frequency and severity.
	
6.	Calculate the Risk Priority Number (RPN).
	
	 The RPN is found by multiplying the ranking of occurrence by severity 
by detection (RPN = F × S × D). The higher the RPN, the higher the prior-
ity the feature has to be addressed.
	
	 Figure 13-5 shows three examples of possible problems in the car 
appraisal and purchasing process. Like the QFD discussed earlier in 
this chapter, the raw value is less important than the relative rank or 
the magnitude of the difference. In the example data, the “Estimated Car 
Value” function has a higher problem possibility than the “Finding if a 
car is available in a zip code” function.

7.	Identify the root causes of the failures.
	
	 Ranking what problems to address is one thing; finding ways to avoid 
them is another. For each of the undesirable outcomes, think of the root 
causes of the problem.
	
	 Sometimes the causes are obvious, while other times it can be helpful 
to use the 5 Why’s technique. Ask “Why?” until you uncover root causes 
instead of symptoms:
	
•	Why are users getting the wrong car value?
	
	They don’t scroll down to see the additional features section.
	
•	Why don’t they scroll?
	
	The options take up more than a single page.
	
•	Why do they take up more than a page?
	
	The screens are smaller to allow for more ads.
	
•	Why so many ads?
	
	These pages are among the highest visited on the site and ads gen-
erate a significant portion of revenue.

f you’ve ever struggled to change the time on an alarm clock, couldn’t 
figure out how to work a remote control, or failed to successfully apply for 
insurance on a website, you have some idea about how important the ease of 
use of a product or experience is.
Your product can have all the features a user wants, but if it’s too difficult to 
use, then the user will move on to another product.
Recognizing the Principles of Usability
If you make your products too difficult to purchase online, or make a form 
too difficult to fill out, customers will leave or call your customer support 
line. Both of these are expensive, undesirable outcomes.
Good usability can lead customers to recommend your product; poor usability 
leads customers to discourage their friends and colleagues from purchasing a 
product. (See Chapter 12 to find out how important customer loyalty is.)
	
Usability is different than other data collected from market research in that it 
measures both customer attitudes and customer actions. Usability is as much 
about what customers do as what they say.

A product or website is usable if
	
✓	Customers can complete what they want to do (effectiveness)
	
✓	Customers can complete their task quickly (efficiency)
	
✓	Customers don’t find the experience frustrating (satisfaction)
There isn’t a usability thermometer that tells you how usable an experience 
is. Instead you have to rely on the outcome of experiences by measuring the 
effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of the experience.
A usability problem is anything in the interface, buttons, labels, designs, or 
layout that prevents users from completing their task, makes the task difficult, 
or leads to longer task times. In this chapter, I show you how to run a usability 
test so you can discover and fix your usability problems and provide a quanti-
fied better customer experience.
Conducting a Usability Test
One of the best ways to identify usability problems is to conduct a usability 
test. The basic idea behind a usability test is that you watch users complete 
(or fail at) tasks with software, hardware, or a website and see what problems 
they run into.
	
You might be tempted to help participants or just ask if they like software or a 
website. But the point of a usability test is to observe your participants and 
not interfere with their process.
Here are the steps to conduct a usability test:
	
1.	Determine what you want to test.
	
2.	Identify your goals.
	
3.	Outline your task scenarios.
	
4.	Recruit users.
	
5.	Test your users.
	
6.	Collect as many metrics as possible.
	
7.	Code your data and analyze it.
	
8.	Summarize and present the results.
The following sections provide the details to complete each of these steps.

 Chapter 14: Gaining Insights through a Usability Study
Determining what you want to test
You can rarely test everything about a product or website that you want to at 
once. That would simply overwhelm your participants.
Narrow the scope of your study by focusing on known problem areas, high 
usage areas, or some combination of the two. See Chapter 13 for ideas on pri-
oritizing features for testing.
	
Eye-tracking usability tests involve special equipment that track where partici-
pants look as they use websites and software. Eye-tracking studies are more 
involved and require special equipment, but can help answer questions about 
whether customers’ eyes are attracted to features or content.
	
If you’re developing a new product, you don’t have to wait to test its usability. 
You can conduct usability tests on sketches or partially completed products. 
The earlier you find problems in the development process, the easier they are 
to fix. Test early and often to get the most of your usability testing.
Identifying the goals
While a usability test is primarily about observing customers and uncovering 
the problems they have, the approach you take depends on your goal.
Identify what the main goals of your study are:
	
✓	Are you trying to find and fix as many usability problems as possible?
	
✓	Do you want a benchmark of usability and performance?
	
✓	Are you comparing an application with a competing product or alterna-
tive design?
Each of these three testing goals requires slightly different testing parameters 
and sample size requirements (see Chapter 2). Many studies will also combine 
the goals. For example, you can have a study to compare your product to a 
competitor, and find out which tasks take longer to complete.
Outlining task scenarios
The task scenario is the hallmark of the usability test.
A task is made up of the steps a user has to perform to accomplish a goal. 
A task scenario describes what you want the participant to achieve. Crafting 
task scenarios is a balance between providing enough information so users

210
Part IV: Analytics for Product Development 
aren’t guessing about what they’re supposed to do and not providing too 
much information (which could overwhelm them). Your goal is to simulate 
the discovery and nonlinearity of real-world application usage.
Follow these guidelines for creating task scenarios for your usability test:
	
✓	Be specific. Give participants a reason or purpose for performing the 
task. Instead of giving generalities like “find a new kitchen appliance,” 
ask them to find a blender for under $75 that has high customer ratings.
	
	In the real world, users usually start searching with general ideas of 
what they want, and then quickly narrow their selection based on price, 
quality, and recommendations. In the artificial world of usability testing, 
users encounter problems if what you provide is too vague, and they will 
look to a moderator (if there is one) for what they should do. Don’t be so 
vague in your task that users have to guess what you want them to do.
	
	For example, “You need to rent a mid-sized car on July 21 at 10 a.m. and 
return it on July 23 at noon from Boston’s Logan Airport” is specific.
	
✓	Don’t tell the user where to click and what to do. While providing spe-
cific details is important, don’t walk the users through every step. Such 
hand-holding will provide biased and less useful results.
	
	For example, instead of saying “Click the small check box at the bottom 
of the screen to add GPS,” just say “Add GPS to your rental car.”
	
✓	Use the customer’s language, not the company’s language. It’s a 
common mistake to mirror the internal structure of a company on a 
website’s navigation or on software screens. It’s also bad practice to ask 
participants to do things based on internal company jargon or terms.
	
	False positive test results or outright confusion may result if users don’t 
understand the terms used in a scenario. Do users really use the term 
“asset” when referring to their kids’ college funds? Will a user know what 
a product “configurator” is or an “item-page” or even the “mega menu”?
	
✓	Have a correct solution. If you ask a user to find a rental car location 
nearest to a hotel address, there should be a correct choice. This makes 
the task more straightforward for the user and allows you to more easily 
know if a task was or wasn’t successfully completed.
	
	The problem with “Find a product that’s right for you” tasks is that 
participants are in the state of mind of finding information to solve prob-
lems. At the time, there probably isn’t a product that’s right for them; 
they’re more interested in getting the test done and collecting their hon-
orarium. This can lead to a sense that any product selection is correct 
and inflate basic metrics like task completion rates.

 Chapter 14: Gaining Insights through a Usability Study
	
✓	Avoid making tasks dependent on each other. It is important to alter-
nate the presentation order of tasks so not all tasks are presented in the 
same sequence. Participants get “warmed-up” during a usability test 
and this can make earlier tasks seem harder and later tasks seem easier. 
When your tasks have dependencies (for example, create a file in one 
task, then delete the same file in another task), if a user fails one task, he 
or she fails the other.
	
	Avoiding dependent scenarios isn’t always possible if you’re testing 
something like an installation process, but be cognizant of both the bias 
and complications introduced by adding dependencies.
	
✓	Provide context but keep the scenario short. Get the users thinking as 
if they actually need to perform the task, but don’t go overboard with 
details.
	
	For example, “You will be attending a conference in Boston in July and 
need to rent a car.”
	
While there isn’t a “right” number of tasks for a usability test, try to identify 
three to five tasks for your test participants to accomplish.
	
Make the tasks realistic and representative of what users actually do. Don’t just 
ask participants if they like or will use an application or website. Have them 
register, log in, fill out a form, search for information, answer a question, or pur-
chase a product. See Chapter 13 for more ideas on identifying the top tasks.
Write the task scenario in a way that gives participants enough information 
to complete a task but not too much that leads them step-by-step down a 
path. For instance, provide product names, specific price ranges, and brands.
Here’s an example:
Task Example: Update a saved expense report.
Earlier you started to create an expense report but ran out of time. You 
saved your work with the description, “Industry Conference.” You want 
to add an expense for sending a FedEx package to the report. Find the 
report and add the FedEx package as a new expense for $26. Submit the 
report for approval when you are done.
	
If you’re testing different types of customers or users, you may need to set up 
a different set of test scenarios based on
	
✓	User needs. For example, software that both teachers and students use 
(like Blackboard) has different tasks.
	
✓	User skills and experience. For example, international non-English 
speaking users often have a different perspective than domestic U.S. 
users when browsing a website.

Part IV: Analytics for Product Development 
Recruiting users
You need customers in order to do usability testing. It can be a small-scale, 
do-it-yourself usability test or a large sample corporate usability test, but 
finding available (and willing) participants can be difficult. In fact, it’s often 
cited as one of the reasons usability testing isn’t done more often.
The process by which you find your users will vary depending on what you are 
testing, the types of users you need, and the stage of testing (early versus late).
Here are six sources to help find users.
	
✓	Hallway testing: Grab anyone who is unfamiliar with the application or 
website you’re testing. These can be coworkers, friends, family, or folks 
at the local coffee shop.
	
	Hallway testing works well for general purpose websites or apps and when 
you’re looking to uncover the more obvious problems with the interactions 
(problems, of course, always seem obvious after you find them).
	
	Don’t rely too heavily on this method, especially when the design is 
more refined or users have specialized skills. When users don’t have an 
interest in a product or service, they will be happy to give you an opin-
ion on matters — but relying on them may generate false positive results 
and overlook issues that actual users will encounter.
	
✓	Existing users: Your existing users are an obvious wellspring for testing. 
If you’re offering a brand-new product, you won’t have this source, of 
course. But, if your company makes similar products, then it makes sense 
to leverage those customers:
	
•	Finding existing users off your website is an easy place to start. You 
can use pop-ups (offered by UserZoom and Ethnio) or fixed opt-in 
boxes to solicit volunteers. Marketing and sales departments usu-
ally have customer contact information you can tap.
	
•	You can work with the customer support department and ask custom-
ers if they’d be interested in participating in follow-up studies. While 
existing customers sound like a panacea for finding users, volun-
teers may not have the time or availability to commit to an hour-
long study, so you often have to rely on other sources.
	
✓	Usertesting.com: This website not only delivers audio and video of users 
using a website or mobile app, but it also has a large panel of users. 
www.Usertesting.com allows you to recruit based on age, gender, and 
geography. You can also ask participants to self-select by asking them 
to participate only if they’ve used a certain website, own a particular 
product, have health insurance, or have a 401(k) account, among other 
things. Although it isn’t a solution when you need hundreds of responses

213
 Chapter 14: Gaining Insights through a Usability Study
or very specific recruiting criteria, or to test software and hardware, get-
ting a source of users and a 15- to 20-minute usability testing for under 
$40 per participant is often very effective.
	
	Similar services are offered by the websites www.TryMyUI.com and 
www.YouEye.com.
	
✓	Craigslist and Facebook: When your recruiting requirements become 
more specific, you can post ads on Craigslist or Facebook. Marketing 
agencies have posted ads for focus groups for years in classifieds, so 
you should have no problem finding willing participants (usability test-
ing is, of course, not a focus group, so be prepared to set expectations). 
Craigslist works for in-person and remote usability testing. In addition 
to the cost of the posting, be prepared to spend between $50 and $200, 
depending on the commitment and type of user you need.
	
	Don’t count on Craigslist for finding participants with highly specialized 
skills or who are high-income earners. You tend to get people who have 
time on their hands and are looking to make some extra cash. With the 
right posting and honorarium, you can usually find a great pool of par-
ticipants for most usability tests.
	
✓	Panel agencies: For unmoderated usability testing or surveys where 
you need hundreds to thousands of respondents, consider using a panel 
agency. Panels have huge databases of people from around the world. 
They keep track of all the usual demographic variables but allow you to 
find people like small-business owners, IT managers, Costco shoppers, 
or tablet owners.
	
	Opinions for Good (Op4G; op4g.com) helps non-profits raise money by 
having its members participate in the studies. The participants keep 
a portion of the honorarium and a portion gets donated. This model 
allows them to reach many people with specialized job skills and high-
income individuals who normally wouldn’t be interested in taking an 
online survey for a few dollars. You can also try Toluna (toluna.com) 
and Research Now (researchnow.com). Plan on paying between $15 and 
$55 per completed response.
	
✓	Market research recruiters: Looking for hardware engineers, lawyers, 
medical professionals, chief financial officers, or people with $100K+ in 
two investment accounts? When you need to find very specific skills for 
in-person testing, you’ll likely need the help of professional recruitment 
firms. Firms like Fieldwork (fieldwork.com) and Plaza Research (plazare-
search.com) maintain huge local and international databases to match 
almost any recruitment need you may have.
	
	Plan on paying a recruiting company between $150 and $300 per 
recruited participant plus an honorarium of between $100 and $250 per 
participant. This approach can get expensive, so be sure you put as 
much effort into creating effective tasks and asking the right questions 
as you do in finding the right test participants. Don’t obsess over per-
fectly matching every demographic variable.

Part IV: Analytics for Product Development 
Find a sample of participants who represent the larger customer base you are 
interested in understanding. The total number of users you’ll need to test will 
largely depend on your testing goals (see the earlier section “Identifying the 
goals”).
	
✓	If your goal is to find and fix problems, then aim for between five and 
ten participants for each round of testing. See the later sidebar, “Sample 
sizes for a usability test.”
	
✓	If your goal is to find a benchmark of usability performance, you need a 
sample size that achieves a tolerable margin of error around your met-
rics. See Chapter 2 for a table of sample sizes.
	
	For example, if you had 32 participants and 50% of them successfully 
completed the task, you can be 90% confident the percentage of all cus-
tomers completing the same task would be between 36% and 64%.
	
✓	If your goal is to compare products, the sample size is affected by a 
number of variables (including the confidence, power, and type of 
metric).
	
	You can usually approximate the needed sample size based on two 
factors:
	
•	How large a difference you want to detect (if one exists)
	
•	Whether the same users will attempt tasks on both products (called 
within-subjects) or if a different set will attempt tasks on each product 
(called between-subjects)
	
	The following table shows the approximate difference you can detect in 
metrics, such as the completion rate or any other binary measure (at a 
50% completion rate).

	For example, at a sample size of 426 (213 in each group), you can detect a 
12% difference for a between-subjects design (see the row that starts with 
12%). So if 50% complete a task on one product and 62% on a competitive 
product, the difference would be statistically significant.
	
These estimates are conservative but recommended when planning a study 
without prior data. For continuous measures like perceived difficulty and task 
time, you can detect smaller differences at the same sample size.
	
If you have the time and budget to test 15 users, it’s more effective to test 5 
users, fix the problems you see, then test another 5 users, fix those problems, 
and then test with a final 5 users.
Testing your users
When you’re ready to test, plan on 60 to 90 minutes per participant. Participants 
start to get fatigued after 90 minutes. Aim for most tasks to take 10 minutes or 
less. This leaves time for an introduction, pre-study questions, three to seven 
tasks, post-study questions, debriefing, and to solve any technical problems 
that pop up.
	
To uncover problems during a usability test, have your participants think out 
loud. Tell them to articulate their thoughts: what doesn’t make sense and what 
confuses them as they attempt the tasks. Don’t stop participants while they 
are working through details. Instead, wait until they get stuck or after a task 
to have them explain something they didn’t understand. See the later section, 
“Finding and Reporting Usability Problems,” for more information.

Part IV: Analytics for Product Development 
Collecting metrics
In addition to usability problems, you should collect three core usability met-
rics when you want to understand the experience a customer has with your 
product. The following task-based metrics correspond to the three areas of 
usability: effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
	
✓	Completion Rate: If a participant completed the task, code it Success (1); 
if the participant didn’t complete the task, code it as Fail (0). Figure 14-1 
shows the completion rate for two tasks on two different websites.
	
✓	Task Time: Measure how long a user took to complete a task.
	
✓	Perceived Difficulty: After a participant attempts a task, ask her to 
rate how difficult it was. A 7-point scale with 1 being Very Difficult and 7 
being Very Easy is common.
	
Record the errors users make, such as clicking on the wrong link, making 
typos, or not seeing the search results on a page. Keep this data for a findabil-
ity study (see Chapter 15).
In addition to these task-based measures, capture at least one overall study 
measure that has participants rate their satisfaction with the overall experi-
ence with the product or website. Good questionnaires include the SUS and 
SUPR-Q (see Chapter 9).

 Chapter 14: Gaining Insights through a Usability Study
Sample sizes for a usability test
Finding the right sample size is a trade-off between the cost of running participants and the capa-
bility to detect usability problems. The larger the sample size, the more usability problems that get 
uncovered. There is, however, a diminishing return as fewer new usability problems get uncovered 
with each additional user. Not all usability problems uniformly affect all customers. Some problems 
only affect 30% or 5%. The fewer customers a problem impacts, the larger the sample size you will 
need to have a good chance of observing the problems in a test.
The recommended way to make a sample size decision is to follow these three steps:
	 1.	 Pick a problem occurrence percentage that you want to detect.
	
	 For example, 5%, 10%, or 20% of customers will have a problem with a task or element of a design.
	 2.	 Pick a percent of these problems you want to observe.
	
	 For example, you might decide you want to observe 80%, 85%, or 90% of customers.
	 3.	 Use the binomial probability formula to determine the sample size needed.
For example, if you want to identify problems that impact 10% or more of your customers and you 
want to have an 85% chance of seeing them (if they exist) in a usability test, then you need to plan 
on observing 18 users. See http://www.measuringu.com/problem_discovery.
php for calculations and background.
At the sample size of ten, most problems that affect 20% or more of customers will be observed. A sample 
size of five (for example, using a “new customer” versus an “existing customer” subset) will still uncover 
68% of the issues impacting as few as 20% of users. At both sample sizes, virtually all issues experienced 
by 40% or more of users will be observed (given the tasks performed and type of user recruited).
The following figure shows the percent of usability problems uncovered by testing five and ten 
customers. For example, around 90% of problems that impact 20% or more of users will likely be 
seen after testing ten users. That is, if a problem exists that would affect 20% of all users, there’s 
about a 90% chance of seeing it at least once in a usability testing with ten users.

Part IV: Analytics for Product Development 
Coding and analyzing your data
After you observe users attempting tasks, summarize the task and test 
metrics and include confidence intervals (see Chapter 2). Look for high 
and low performance across the metrics, and then look to understand 
“why” by summarizing what problems users encountered and what com-
ments they made.
Summarizing and presenting  
the results
Correlate your results with graphs and a report or briefing. Report the results 
of the usability metrics, the usability problems found, and overall findings 
from the study. Conclude with actionable items that you can accomplish to 
make the tasks easier for customers to complete.
For example, in a usability test of Enterprise.com, the site lacked a total 
price for the rental car. A clear action item would be to add a total to the 
confirmation page. If a total can’t be added because of variation in taxes or 
prices per state, for example, then provide a clear estimate in a prominent 
location on the page and an explanation of why a precise total can’t be 
provided.
Considering the Different 
Types of Usability Tests
Usability testing originally was conducted only in expensive corporate 
facilities. These usability labs had two-way mirrors and expensive video 
and audio equipment. Participants had to take the time to come to the lab 
for testing. Only big-budget firms could afford to conduct these types of 
usability tests.
In the last 15 years, however, technological improvements have allowed mar-
keters to collect task-oriented data from customers without needing them to 
come to a physical location.
There are three major approaches to usability testing. Each has its advantages 
and disadvantages:

 Chapter 14: Gaining Insights through a Usability Study
	
✓	Lab-based: This is the classic approach to usability testing. Customers 
physically come to a lab, often with a two-way mirror, and are observed 
by a team of product developers or researchers. This is still the primary 
method for testing physical products, like remote controls or mobile 
applications. A facilitator moderates the session, so it’s often referred to 
as moderated in-person testing.
	
	While many companies may have a dedicated lab for testing customers 
(our company has two) and specialized software, you don’t need much 
to conduct a usability test. You just need a conference room, office, or 
some other space where your product can be used by a customer. You 
also need adequate time to set up the study.
	
✓	Remote moderated: Customers log into screen-sharing software like 
GoTo Meeting (gotomeeting.com) or WebEx (webex.com) and 
attempt the same tasks as if they were in a lab. The software allows 
customers from anywhere in the world to share their screen and even 
control your computer. You can even have them turn on their webcam to 
see their faces. A facilitator still guides the participant through the tasks, 
but the customer and facilitator can be in different cities or countries.
	
✓	Remote unmoderated: Software from companies like UserZoom 
(userzoom.com) and Loop11 (loop11.com) walk customers through 
tasks and questions. It’s particularly well suited for testing websites or 
web applications. Everything about the interaction can be recorded, 
including a recording of what testers did on-screen, and their facial 
expressions captured by their web cam. This technology also works for 
mobile devices so you can have testers from anywhere in the world.
	
	This method can give you stats that you might not be able to replicate in 
a moderated or lab-based environment. Figure 14-2 shows how UserZoom 
offers a heat map, showing where testers first start to complete a task.
	
	A variation on this method is a service from usertesting.com. 
Usertesting.com has a panel of users who are trained to think out loud 
as they walk through tasks. You can get feedback from five users the 
same day you launch a study. It’s called remote unmoderated because 
you don’t need a test facilitator to walk participants through each task. 
This allows you to collect a lot of data quicker and with less cost than 
with other methods.
	
Combine multiple methods to fully understand a customer’s experience with 
a website or software. For example, you can have 300 users complete tasks 
using the remote unmoderated method and then have 10 to 15 users come 
into a lab so you can follow up on interesting interactions or problems.

Finding and Reporting 
Usability Problems
When you have a usability test, one of your primary goals will be to find and 
fix as many usability problems as you can.
Follow these steps to uncover usability problems:

Part IV: Analytics for Product Development 
	
1.	Record the undesirable outcome.
	
	 Did users make a mistake, not notice an element, take a long time to com-
plete a task, or fail to complete the task altogether? These actions are 
symptoms, but not guarantees of usability problems. Errors are undesir-
able, but they aren’t necessarily caused by a problem with the interface 
(think typos). Both first-time and experienced users commit errors.
	
2.	Identify what in the interface is causing the problem.
	
	 Sometimes it’s obvious (maybe users don’t know what an icon means), 
but other times, knowing the context, what the user was doing, and what 
he was asked to do is essential for extracting a usability problem.
	
3.	Determine if the issue is global or local.
	
	 It can often be helpful to identify whether a problem affects the entire 
interface or just a section of it. For example, if users have problems 
turning on filters on a mobile TV app, it’s likely local to the filtering func-
tionality. However, if users don’t understand what a name in the global 
navigation on a website means, it’ll affect the entire website experience.
	
	 Just because an issue is local doesn’t make it less important. Rather, it 
helps you and the design team understand both the scope of the prob-
lem and the potential impact of the change.
	
4.	Assign a severity rating.
	
	 You want to separate the catastrophic problems from the cosmetic ones. 
One of the best ways is to assign a severity rating, from minor (1) to 
major (3). Most usability studies will reveal a lot of problems, many of 
which can’t be addressed. The severity ratings help prioritize what to 
fix first.
	
5.	Recommend possible solutions, if appropriate.
	
	 Every usability issue doesn’t have to have a proposed solution, but if 
there is an obvious fix, then suggest it or implement it if you’re in charge 
of the development. You can often recommend solutions when a new 
design can fix multiple issues. Usability problem descriptions should be 
usable and useful. Often just a well-described usability problem can help 
developers generate ideas for design alternatives.
	
6.	Present usability problems.
	
	 While the “right” way to find and present usability problems will depend 
on the purpose of the study (finding and fixing versus comparing to 
previously identified problems), it’s ultimately about balancing priori-
ties, design, and business constraints to determine what to fix. Providing 
a list of usability problems is the simplest and most straightforward 
approach to presenting usability problems. Include the percent of users 
who encountered each problem and the assigned severity.

	 For example, in a usability test of a new email program that tested six 
users, here are four problems found, with the percent of users who 
encountered the issues, and the interpretation of each issue’s severity 
(on a 3-point scale: 1 = Minor, 2 = Moderate, 3 = Severe).
Percentage of Users
Severity
Description
67
2: Moderate
Participants were confused that you 
can only drag and drop after click-
ing a check box, not by clicking any-
where within the email cell.
67
2: Moderate
Participants had trouble locating 
the “Add Contact” button.
67
2: Moderate
It was not immediately clear that 
the envelope icon means send an 
email.
50
1: Minor
Participants expected the email to 
show full screen instead of split screen.
	
Add screen shots, videos, and additional descriptions to help everyone under-
stand the issues — especially if the usability issues are controversial. To aid 
comprehension, include a simplified problem list at the beginning of a report 
and a more detailed follow-up section with screen shots to provide the neces-
sary context.
You can also chart your users and problems. In Figure 14-3, the users are 
numbered on the y-axis (1 to 30) and the issues have each been given a 
number (1 to 28) and sorted from most to least frequent. Each black square 
represents which user encountered which problem. You can compute such 
matrices by task or across tasks for the whole usability test.
Displaying problems in a type of matrix allows you to see three problems 
from three perspectives:
	
✓	Frequency by problem: For example, the most common problem (far 
left) involved users having trouble adding a GPS navigation to their rental 
(they had to do it after they entered their personal details). This problem 
impacted 24 out of 30 users (80%). You can be 95% confident between 62% 
and 91% of all users would also have this problem. (See Chapter 2 for a 
refresher on confidence intervals.)
	
✓	Frequency by user: The first user in the matrix encountered 9 of the 28 
problems (32%), while user 28 encountered only 1 problem (3%), and 
users 29 and 30 encountered no problems while renting the car.
	
✓	Problems that affected only one user (the long tail of usability prob-
lems): The last nine problems were encountered by only a single user (3%).

What 3 users can tell you that 3,000 cannot
Just because you have a small sample size 
doesn’t mean you can’t identify major problems 
with a customer’s experience. Software com-
pany Autodesk had a problem with a software 
download. The company noticed a large spike 
in customer support calls related to a trial ver-
sion of AutoCAD. A usability study was set up to 
observe how customers downloaded the soft-
ware from the website.
During the study, 3 out of 11 customers unknow-
ingly downloaded the wrong version of the 
software. Not until several minutes into the 
installation did they encounter a problem — a 
bizarre error message telling them their operat-
ing system wasn’t supported.
This message led customers to call the support 
line. It turns out that these users were confused 
about which version of software to choose from 
the layout of the trial download page.
Using confidence intervals, the company could 
be 90% confident that somewhere between 11% 
and 52% of all customers would be also strug-
gling with this design element. In other words, 
with just 11 users, it could virtually be certain at 
least 1 out of 10 customers would have a prob-
lem and that many of them would call support.
Remember: It’s easier to detect that a product 
experience is unusable with a small sample size 
than it is to conclude that the product experi-
ence is usable. More common problems will 
come up in a test with just a few participants, 
indicating an unusable experience. However, 
just because you don’t observe a problem with 
a small sample doesn’t mean that the prod-
uct is usable. There can be problems but they 
may affect a smaller percentage of users. You 
can’t be as confident the product experience is 
usable with a small sample size.

 Chapter 14: Gaining Insights through a Usability Study
Facilitating a Usability Study
Facilitating a usability test takes practice, interpersonal skills, and the ability 
to juggle many things at once in order to collect data from a test participant. 
Here are some guidelines for facilitating a moderated usability test:
	
✓	Be prepared to listen. You need to talk to moderate a session, but don’t 
let the talking get in the way of discovering.
	
	Like in any relationship, you’ve got to know
	
•	When to talk
	
•	When to listen
	
•	When to move on
	
✓	Don’t lead the user. Even if a user asks if she “did it right” or is going 
down the wrong path and asks, “Is this the right way?” try and deflect 
such questions by asking back, “What would your inclination be?” or 
“Where would you go to look for that?”
	
✓	Don’t put the participant on the defensive. One of your goals as a facili-
tator is to get into the heads of your customers as they use the product. 
You need to know why users are clicking in different areas or not under-
standing a term or concept, for instance. It’s only natural to ask users 
why they did something. Instead of directly asking, “Why did you click 
that link?” ask “What about the link led you to click on it?” This will get 
the participant thinking about her motivations and mental models and 
not feeling defensive and respond with less helpful “because I thought 
I was supposed to go there.” Balancing question asking without putting 
the user on the defensive takes some practice.
	
✓	Probe users about interaction problems between tasks. If you wait 
until after a participant is done, then you get an accurate reading of how 
long a task takes and you don’t interrupt the user or inadvertently sug-
gest ideas on how to complete a task.
	
✓	Have a note taker and separate facilitator, if possible. The facilitator 
is often kept busy asking follow-up questions, troubleshooting technical 
issues, answering user questions, and keeping the study on track. It’s 
easy to miss valuable insights if one person is performing both functions.
	
✓	Review the observations and problems after each user. Review the 
issues when they’re fresh — with another person, such as a note taker 
or stakeholder. It helps get the problem list out faster and allows you 
confirm or deny hypotheses about what’s causing problems and what 
might fix them with your next set of users.

226
Part IV: Analytics for Product Development 
	
✓	Record positive issues, suggestions, and usability problems. Don’t just 
collect the bad news. Collect those suggestions and positive comments 
and features that go smoothly. Although a development team will often 
want to get right to the problems, most will also appreciate that users 
and usability professionals aren’t all gloom and doom.
	
✓	Illustrate issues using screen shots and categorize problems. Sorting 
problems into logical groups such as “buttons,” “navigation,” and 
“labels,” along with a good picture, can really help with digesting long 
lists. Figure 14-4 shows responses to open-ended questions about what 
problems users had while renting a car. The open-ended comments were 
categorized and then charted. The vertical lines show the 90% confi-
dence intervals around each percentage of comments (See Chapter 2 
for a reminder on converting qualitative data to quantitative data and 
adding confidence intervals). The two biggest issues uncovered in the 
comments are from participants having problems finding the total price 
of the rental car (“Totaling”) or finding the GPS and car seat to add on to 
the rental (“Finding Extras”).
	
✓	Use highlight videos. Small clips of the most common usability prob-
lems or illustrative examples are helpful for stakeholders who rarely 
have time to view videos in their entirety.

Comparative usability test of 
Enterprise and Budget.com
Here’s how a comparative usability study 
between two rental car companies, Budget and 
Enterprise, was conducted.
Study Goals
How well prospective and current customers 
can use the websites, which websites custom-
ers preferred, and what problems customers 
encountered while trying to find the price of a 
rental car.
Participants
Asked 62 qualified participants (people who had 
rented a car online in the last year) to complete 
two tasks on both websites. Half the partici-
pants attempted the tasks on Budget first and 
the other half on Enterprise first.
Method
Unmoderated remote testing setup using soft-
ware from UserZoom, with audio and video 
recordings.
Tasks
Two tasks were created.
	✓	Find the nearest location.
	
	Find the address of the nearest rental office 
to the Hilton Hotel located at 921 SW Sixth 
Avenue, Portland, Oregon, United States 
97204. Write down or copy the name of the 
street of the nearest location.
	✓	Rent a car.
	
	Location: Logan Airport, Boston, MA
	
	Rental Period: Friday, April, 13, 2012, at 
11:00 a.m. to Sunday, April 15, at 5:00 p.m.
	
	Class: Intermediate (No SUVs)
	
	Extras: GPS navigation and car seat for a 
2-year-old
	
	If asked, use the following identification:
	
	Name: John Smith
	
	Email: john112233@mailinator.com
	
	Phone: 303-555-1212
	
	Credit Card: Visa
The total price for the rental determines if 
participants were successful in picking the 
right class of car, for the right dates and the 
add-ons.
Study Metrics
Brand attitude and usage were collected before 
the study and perceptions of website quality 
were collected at the end of the study.
Task Metrics
Completion Rate: The participants provided 
the correct price of the rental car from a list 
of options. If participants selected the correct 
price, it was coded as a 1; incorrect answers 
were coded as a 0.
Task Time: How long participants spent on each 
website.
Task Difficulty: Participants rated how easy or 
difficult the experience was; 1 = Very Difficult 
to 7 = Very Easy.
Results
Task-Based Metrics Results
Completion Rate: If users can’t complete a 
task successfully, then not much else matters. 
In both cases, Budget had higher comple-
tion rates. The completion rate on finding the 
price of a rental car was statistically higher 
with a completion rate over twice as high as 
Enterprise. (Refer to Figure 14-4.)
(continued)

Part IV: Analytics for Product Development 
Task Time: The data shows that customers took 
statistically longer to complete both tasks on 
Enterprise than on Budget.
Task Difficulty: Users found it easier to find a 
location and to rent a car on Budget. The differ-
ence was also statistically significant.
These three task-based metrics were combined 
into a Single Usability Metrics (SUM), which 
averages together each attribute of usability, 
as shown in the following figure. It provides 
a single view that shows Budget had a more 
usable experience.
Click Maps
UserZoom provided a heat map showing 
where users clicked first. The heat map for 
Enterprise (refer to Figure 14-2) showed only 
a small fraction of users looked in the correct 
place — in the Rent a Car menu in the upper-
left corner, suggesting problems with labels 
and navigation. (See Chapter 15 for more on 
findability.)
The heat map for the Budget website showed 
a substantial portion of participants correctly 
clicked the Location tab and most participants 
(84%) successfully found the nearest location.
Study-Based Metrics Results
SUPR-Q scores summarizing the participants’ 
perception of the quality of the experience are 
shown in the following figure. Scores were 
overwhelmingly more favorable for Budget 
than for Enterprise. This was also reflected in 
the Net Promoter Score (NPS). Not surprisingly, 
participants preferred Budget over Enterprise 
by more than a 3:1 ratio.

 Chapter 14: Gaining Insights through a Usability Study
Examining the Verbatims
Here are a few comments users made during 
this study while on the Enterprise website.
	
	 It didn’t give the whole total with the extras; 
I had to add that myself.
	
	 Took the price of the car and manually 
added on 3-day price of car seat ($10.99*3) 
and same for GPS but still unsure of total 
because unsure if these items are taxed.
	
	 I saw no area to add the extras.
	
	 I saw no way to add GPS or child seat.
These open-ended comments were catego-
rized into groups and charted in Figure 14-4. The 
two biggest issues, and areas for improvement, 
are fixing the total price of the rental and find-
ing the GPS and car seat to add on to the rental. 
Correcting both problems will likely improve the 
metrics and the customers’ experience with the 
website.

I
 
f customers can’t find what they’re looking for on your website — say your 
navigation is poor or your search function isn’t working — customers will 
move on and find what they’re looking for with another company. All your 
effort in regards to pricing, features, marketing, and packaging won’t matter; 
the end result will be a lost opportunity. Your customers have to be able to find 
things quickly and easily.
In this chapter, I show you how to determine what customers are trying to 
find, then how to measure their capability to find the items (findability). I also 
give you ways to improve your findability and then measure whether changes 
you’ve made actually improve your findability.
	
While this chapter mostly talks about websites, findability is more that just 
your website. It pertains to wherever customers interact with your company. 
That could be software or mobile apps they’re navigating, or how you display 
products in your bricks-and-mortar store. You can apply the information in 
this chapter to every area of your company.

Part IV: Analytics for Product Development 
Finding Your Areas of Findability
If you’ve ever looked for a product on a website, tried to change the settings 
on your iPhone, hunted for food in a supermarket, or searched for a movie on 
cable TV, you have some idea about findability.
Findability is the percent of items that a customer can find successfully, how 
quickly items are found, and how much difficulty customers have in locating 
an item.
Customers expect quick and easy access to products and information. How 
do customers find items on your website? Take a critical eye to these areas of 
your website:
	
✓	Search boxes: Search functions are vital to visitors finding what they want.
	
✓	Categories: If you categorize your items and label each category appro-
priately, then visitors can find what they’re looking for.
	
	You can offer categories in the form of links that visitors can click through 
or offer drop-down lists that visitors can drill down to find what they’re 
looking for. Categories (called navigation) are usually listed on the left or 
right side of the page for quick access.
	
✓	Breadcrumb links: Breadcrumb links are useful navigation tools so 
visitors don’t get lost in your website. These links show visitors the 
path they’ve taken to get to the page they’re currently viewing. These 
are generally links at the top or bottom of the page that matches the 
navigation, and visitors can click to move back to where they’ve been 
in the path.
	
✓	Suggested items: If you already know a customer is interested in a  
product — based on a search term or past browsing (or buying) history — 
you can also offer a list of similar products. Something in that list might 
be exactly what your customer is looking for.
Figure 15-1 shows how one popular company, Amazon, uses these navigation 
features to enhance its findability.
	
The capability to find the right item or function can mean the difference 
between a potential customer completing a sale or moving on to another 
website. You have to make sure that your findability is as good as it can be in 
order to prevent losing those customers.

Identifying What Customers Want
The first step in understanding findability is to know what your customers 
are looking for. If you have a diverse customer base, you need to identify 
a target segment and persona to use for your findability study. Check out 
Chapters 4 and 5 to split your customer base into segments and then create a 
persona for each segment.
	
If you have a diverse customer base that buys different products, you’ll need 
to conduct your findability study for each target segment.
Identify a good cross-section of products or pieces of information that your 
target segment would likely look for on the website. Although you might have 
thousands of products, pages, and content, you don’t need to be comprehen-
sive; just pick a representative sample.

Part IV: Analytics for Product Development 
	
Narrow the list to no more than 30 items. You should only ask participants in a 
study to spend no more than around 30 minutes. Anything more and partici-
pants lose focus and drop out, making data collection more costly.
Here are some ideas on how to identify those items:
	
✓	Search logs: See what users are searching for on the website’s internal 
search function. If customers are searching for a product, then it’s a 
good indication that they’re looking for that product.
	
✓	Your website analytics program: Analytics programs like Google 
Analytics provide key words and traffic logs to see which pages are most 
visited and what external search words customers are using.
	
✓	Purchase records: Products that are purchased more frequently will 
have the most traffic, and even small improvements in findability can 
result in substantially higher revenue.
	
✓	Comments and complaints: An easy place to find problems with your 
categorization system is to see if customers have complained about not 
being able to locate items.
	
✓	Your existing customers: Ask customers to pick their top five products 
or things they look for when browsing or purchasing. You can also ask 
them which product, if any, they recall looking for and whether they 
were able to find it.
	
	You can ask website visitors to take a 5-minute survey using a website 
intercept. Questions to ask could be who they were, why they were visit-
ing, and to pick the top five most important pieces of information they 
want to locate on the website.
	
✓	New and known issues: Sometimes you’ll know that items can’t be found. 
In other cases, you have a new product that you’ll want to know if cus-
tomers can find.
	
	For example, maybe you have a seasonal item that you only offer during 
certain times of the year. You know ahead of time that visitors might not 
be able to find the item or not know that you carry it (because it’s sea-
sonal), and you can figure out ways to make it more findable.
	
People usually search for products by category (for example, barbeque grills) 
and by brand (for example, Weber Grill). Look at existing customer data to 
see how customers search for items. If they use brands or generic categories 
when searching, you’ll want to use the same terms because you’re measuring 
findability.

Prepping for a Findability Test
Before you can launch your findability study, you have to do some things 
to prepare for it. You need to know what your existing findability is — after 
all, you need to know where you’re at now to know what changes you need 
to make your findability and navigation better in the future. Setting up your 
existing navigation in a tree test can aid in your findability study. These tasks 
set you up for a successful findability study.
Finding your baseline
You need to find what your existing findability rate is — baseline findability — 
for items before you start making changes. You need to understand how well 
customers can find the items using your existing navigation structure. It’s 
important to know how findable items are now so that when you make changes 
to labels, names, and navigation structures you have something to compare 
them to. Make sure you aren’t making it harder for customers to find products!
For a baseline findability study, you need participants who represent your 
customer base to try to locate a typical set of items using your current web-
site navigation. The resulting metrics will become your baseline findability.
	
You may think that customers always use the search box on your website. But  
research I’ve conducted shows that around half of customers start with a 
“browse-first” approach on most websites.
Although the fonts, layout, colors, and overall look and feel of a website play 
a major role in helping or hindering customers from finding items, isolate 
problems with the taxonomy — the order, labels, structure, and hierarchy of 
categories that contain the products or information — as a separate issue 
from navigation. After you have a good navigation structure, you can then 
test the design and know that the navigation is likely not the culprit causing 
problems.
Designing the study
For electronic product searches (websites, software, mobile apps), the best 
way to test findability is to replicate your existing navigation structure into a 
tree test. It’s called a tree test because it looks like a tree trunk and branches, 
much like old versions of Windows Explorer.

While you can conduct a tree test using pencil and paper, the most efficient 
way to test a navigation structure is using software. Software can streamline 
the process by automating a lot of the functions and doing the hard work for 
you. You can find software from companies like UserZoom (www.userzoom.
com) and Optimal Workshop (www.optimalworkshop.com).
The following steps show you how to conduct a tree test using UserZoom:
	
1.	Replicate your website navigation structure.
	
	 This should be the top two to three levels of your navigation structure. 
Figure 15-2 shows the navigation structure for the National Multiple 
Sclerosis Society replicated in UserZoom.
	
Figure 15-2:

structure in 
UserZoom 
mirroring 
the actual 
navigation 
from the 
website.
	
	
2.	Add the items you want to test, and the search terms visitors typically 
use to find those items.
	
	 To understand what items visitors were looking for, review the page views 
and search logs for what pages and terms were the most popular, ask the 
web and content teams for what kind of content people typically want, and 
conduct a survey on the website. If you aren’t sure what your customers 
are looking for, see the earlier section “Identifying What Customers Want.”

3.	Identify the correct paths users should take to find each item.
	
	 As part of the study setup, identify which locations (the leaves in the 
tree) are correct paths users can take to find the information. The soft-
ware tracks the paths users take and compares them to the paths you’ve 
identified as correct. Figure 15-3 shows the navigation tree with the cor-
rect paths identified.

Looking at your findability metrics
Before you launch your findability study, you need to know which data 
UserZoom collects for your baseline metrics. I discuss the most common 
metrics in the following sections.

Part IV: Analytics for Product Development 
Findability
Your key metric is findability or findability rate: whether the customer suc-
cessfully finds the product or piece of information successfully. This is just like 
the completion rate in a usability study (see Chapter 14). Did the customer 
find the intended item (yes/no)? This answer gets coded as 1 for Found and 0 
for Not Found. For example, if 70 out of 100 participants found the item, then 
the findability rate is 70%.
	
An item can live in multiple places, so double-check “right answers.” Remember: 
Participants and real customers will often look in many different places.
Time to find
If you ask users to locate an item, they assume the item can be found. 
Otherwise, why would you ask them? This is one of the inherent biases in 
findability testing. If users eventually find the item but it takes them a long 
time, then you have a findability issue. The tree-testing software records how 
long it takes participants to locate (or fail to locate) an item.
The median time on task is an excellent way to understand the average time 
it takes participants. To also gain perspective of how consistent the experi-
ence is, look at the variability of found item times. Divide the standard devia-
tion of the task time by the mean time. High values indicate high variability 
(this metric is called the coefficient of variation).
Task Difficulty
If you ask participants how easy or difficult it was to locate the item after 
they finish looking for it, you can use a rating scale to measure the perceived 
difficulty. A seven-point rating scale called the Single Ease Question (SEQ) 
(discussed in Chapter 9) gauges how hard it is for users to locate items. So if 
there are 12 items to locate, you have responses to 12 items.
Scores below about a 6 on the seven-point scale are below average in ease 
(and therefore are more difficult).
Open-Ended responses
If participants rate an item as relatively difficult to locate, you can ask them 
to describe in their own words the problem they encountered. These remarks 
become excellent ideas for improving the navigation and findability. They 
help provide the “why” behind the numbers.
Card sorting
If you want to test how clear your category labels are, ask participants to sort 
your items into their own categories and then label them (a technique called 
card sorting). Check responses against the way you have your categories 
labeled, which can help you understand the thought process your customers 
use in finding products.

 Chapter 15: Measuring Findability and Navigation
National Multiple Sclerosis Society
The National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS) 
wanted to redesign its website. Members and 
visitors loved the wealth of information that the 
NMSS maintained online, but had trouble find-
ing information when they needed it. Instead of 
just starting with a brand new website with a 
new navigation structure, the NMSS conducted 
a findability study in UserZoom. First, it mea-
sured the baseline findability.
To understand what items visitors were look-
ing for, page views and search logs for what 
pages and terms were the most popular were 
reviewed. The web and content teams were 
asked to create a list of information that people 
typically want. In total, people were looking for 
64 pieces of information, including information 
about newly approved medications, information 
about specific symptoms, and ways of sharing 
information via social media.
To reduce the items for website visitors to find, 
the NMSS needed input from qualified partici-
pants. It’s difficult to find participants in the MS 
community from a panel agency, so the soci-
ety used a website intercept launched from its 
website (www.nmss.org). For two weeks, 
website visitors were asked to answer a five-
minute survey about who they were and why 
they were visiting, and to pick the top five most 
important pieces of information they wanted to 
locate on the website. In total, data was col-
lected from 1,300 website visitors using their 
desktop computers or mobile devices (tablets 
or smartphones).
Ranked in order, the top ten items were 
selected for the findability study. The terms the 
visitors used in the tasks were added into the 
UserZoom software for testing.
The discovery: 77% of participants found the 
location for information around new treatments, 
a reasonably high findability rate, as shown in 
the first figure. In comparison, only 44% found 
the information about vitamin D as a treatment, 
and an even smaller number of participants, 
only 9%, located information around financial 
assistance programs. Both these tasks have 
high difficulty ratings as well, which isn’t sur-
prising: the NMSS already knew the items were 
difficult for participants to find. But it did find 
out that although the New Treatments task had 
relatively high findability at 77%, participants 
thought it was about average in difficulty, as 
shown in the second figure. To find out how 
these problems were fixed, see the “Improving 
Findability” section.

Part IV: Analytics for Product Development 
Conducting Your Findability Study
When you have your tree test set up the way you want it, you can add profile 
and demographic questions to the beginning or end of your study. You can 
also ask participants which items they found the most difficult to locate. 
Figure 15-4 shows a schematic for a typical tree test.
	
Figure 15-4: 
The hier-
archy of 
tree-testing 
metrics.
	
	
Be careful about what you ask your participants so they don’t feel like you’re 
invading their privacy. If you ask for income, age, or other personal questions, 
consider making these questions optional if it makes a difference between 
someone continuing your study and opting out.
The total time it takes to collect responses for a tree test depends on your 
sample size and how difficult it is to recruit participants. Typically, you need 
50 to 300 participants to take a tree test and you collect the data within a 
week or two.
Determining sample size
The ideal sample size for running a baseline findability study is based on 
identifying the tolerable margin of error around the estimate (see Chapter 2 
for a reminder on the margin of error). The following minitable, which is 
derived using the margin of error from a 50% binary (yes/no) response 
question, shows the approximate sample size needed to achieve a specific 
margin of error.

For example, if 103 customers completed a tree-test study and 50% found an 
item, you can be 90% confident the percentage of all customers locating the 
item in the tree test would be between 42% and 58%.
Recruiting users
Like a usability study or survey, you need to find qualified participants who 
represent your customer base, and then have them attempt to locate items. 
Generally, you can find customers to participate in a findability study in three 
places:
	
✓	Customer lists: If you keep lists of current customer contact information 
and have permission to contact them, then you can simply ask, and usu-
ally, you compensate these customers to participate in a study.
www.it-ebooks.info
WWW.EBOOK777.COM

free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
242
Part IV: Analytics for Product Development 
	
✓	Panel agencies: Companies such as Op4G (http://op4g.com), Toluna 
(www.toluna-group.com), and Research Now (www.researchnow.
com) have active panels of millions of people with a range of profiles that 
mimic the U.S. or international populations. You provide these companies 
with the type of customer you want and then pay per completed study.
	
	Panel agencies recruit physicians, engineers, IT administrators, CFOs, 
attorneys, and small-business owners to participate in findability studies. 
You can also recruit based on habits, such as people who have a Costco 
membership or who have recently purchased a car.
	
✓	Website intercepts: For testing website navigation, one of the best places to 
find qualified participants is from customers actively visiting the website. 
Using a pop-up intercept from companies like UserZoom (www.userzoom.
com) and Ethnio (http://ethn.io), a simple line of code will pop up and 
ask website visitors to participate in a study. It will even redirect them to an 
online study, allowing for virtual real-time data collection.
Analyzing the results
With the data collected, summarize the findability metrics by task: findability, 
task difficulty, and task time.
	
1.	Calculate the findability rate as your first (or gateway) metric.
	
	 If users can’t even locate the item, then it’s a findability issue. While it’s 
unrealistic to expect 100% of participants to find each item, you should 
aim for findability rates in the high 80%–90% range. Figure 15-5 shows 
findability rates for products on Target’s website. Around half the prod-
ucts had reasonable findability rates, with a few, including the Wildkin 
Kaleidoscope Backpack, had very low findability rates.
	
	 A high findability rate doesn’t mean participants think an item is neces-
sarily easy to locate. Participants may still take a long time or found the 
number of steps or choices too difficult. Finding an item is necessary 
but not sufficient to achieve high findability.
	
2.	Examine how difficult it was to find the item by looking at the average 
score to the difficulty question.
	
	 For 7-point rating scales, the average score should be above a 6 — that’s the 
average level of difficulty. Figure 15-6 shows the perceived difficulty of find-
ing the same items. Even though nine items had findability rates above 50%, 
only four items had difficulty ratings that were above average. These lower-
rated items are good candidates for you to improve their findability.
	
3.	Calculate the median time to find the item.

243
 Chapter 15: Measuring Findability and Navigation
	
	 For the participants who did find the item successfully, compute the 
median time to find the item. The median is the middle value of a set of 
times. It can be found using the Excel function =Median(). While the 
actual time it should take to find an item depends on the complexity of 
the tree, aim for times to be less than 30 seconds.

Part IV: Analytics for Product Development 
Improving Findability
When you’ve collected all your baseline data, it’s time to do something about 
improving the findability. Here’s how to dissect the information gleaned from 
your tree-testing software:
	
1.	Look for items that were hardest to find.
	
2.	Look for items that were rated more difficult (even if they were 
found).
	
3.	Look for items where users took too long to locate.
	
	 Anything that takes over a minute to find is too long; ideally items 
should take less than 30 seconds to find.
	
4.	Examine the open-ended responses participants provided to see why 
items are difficult to find.
In the following sections, I offer insights into how to fix the issues you find.
Cross-linking products
Tree-testing software tells you not only whether customers found the item, 
but also the paths they took, as well as the paths taken by customers who 
didn’t successfully find the items. Look to see where customers are going and 
if possible, add a cross-link or recategorize your products or information.
	
Cross-linking is especially useful for websites and software where you don’t 
need to physically place items.
For example, in a baseline findability study with the National Multiple 
Sclerosis Society’s website, only 12% of participants found the correct loca-
tion for financial assistance information — one of the top reasons people visit 
the website.
Figure 15-7 shows the output from part of the tree test. The correct location 
was “Society Programs and Services,” as indicated with the checkmark and 
box. The first percentage shows that 12% of participants at some point con-
sidered this option, and the second percentage, 9%, shows the percentage 
of participants who ultimately selected this as the location. In looking at the 
options immediately above the Society and Program Services, a substantial 
percentage (44%) selected Insurance and Money Matters as the place they’d 
expect to find information on financial assistance programs. Adding a cross-
link from Insurance and Money Matters or moving the content solves the 
problem.

Figure 15-7: 
In this 
example, 
44% of 
participants 
looked in 
a category 
that didn’t 
have 
the right 
information.
	
Regrouping categories
One of the biggest problems you might have with findability is the category 
names you use. You might use jargon or terms that are familiar with you, but 
less so with your customers. Your customers can have problems navigating 
your website if your categories aren’t labeled properly — for them, not you.
Tree-testing software can show you what your customers expect category 
names to be. A complementary method, called card sorting, helps identify 
labeling problems. With card sorting, users take your products and sort them 
into categories and then give their categories names. Look at those customer-
provided names and consider changing or adding to your categories to aid in 
better navigation.
Rephrasing the tasks
Sometimes, low findability rates can be caused by participants not fully 
understanding what they are looking for. For example, gift cards are popular 
purchases on retail websites. In a target.com tree test, the most difficult item 
www.it-ebooks.info
WWW.EBOOK777.COM

246
Part IV: Analytics for Product Development 
to find was the “Iconic Puppy Gift Card $5–$1,000.” Participants were con-
fused when looking for the item. In reading the comments, participants didn’t 
know if the item they were looking for was a gift card or a $5 puppy!
If you get a lot of similar comments, try rephrasing your tasks to be sure par-
ticipants understand what to look for.
Measuring findability after changes
Now it’s time to find out whether the changes you’ve made to your navigation 
actually improve the findability and navigation of your website. Here’s where 
having the baseline data pays off. The way to know if you made improve-
ments or made things worse is by comparing the findability of the same items 
after you’ve implemented changes.
	
✓	Findability: Did your users find more of your items using your new 
navigation? Aim for findability rates above 70% (but any improvement is 
good!).
	
	For example, in a tree test on a retail website, an item of children’s fur-
niture had an initial low findability rate of 29%, but it improved to 74% 
after changes were implemented. The baseline test showed users split 
across categories; the improvement came from adding links to the cor-
rect department from those categories.
	
	Figure 15-8 shows the 90% confidence intervals for the percent of users 
who found the item before and after the change. The difference was both 
statistically significant (p <.01) and practically significant (the findability 
rate more than doubled!). See the appendix for what p-values are and 
how to interpret them when comparing two percentages.
	
✓	Difficulty: Did users find it less difficult to find the items? You should 
find overall that the difficulty rate went from harder than average to 
easier than average.
	
	Figure 15-9 shows the perceived difficulty of finding the children’s furni-
ture using the rating scale of difficulty. Higher scores indicate an easier 
experience finding the item, compared to hundreds of other tasks. 
Before the findability fixes, the item scored easier than 37% of all tasks. 
After the change, the perceived ease score was easier than 59% of all 
tasks in the database.
	
	As with measuring the user experience in general, measuring findability 
in particular involves multiple metrics and multiple methods to show a 
quantifiable better navigation.

	Figure 15-10 shows that only 1% of participants were able to locate a prom 
dress on a department store website using the old category “Guys and 
Juniors.” After changing the category to “Teens,” based on the input from 
participants in a card-sorting study, the findability rate improved to 74%!
	
✓	Task time: When users located the item both before and after the 
change, were they able to find it in the same amount of time or quicker 
after changes were made based on the first set of results? Figure 15-11 
shows the median task time for three items found on a ski resort web-
site. Customers were able to find vacation package deals faster on the

tasks, the times were not statistically different, suggesting changes that 
benefited one task didn’t harm the others.

Considering the Ethics of 
Customer Analytics
In This Chapter
▶	Getting informed consent
▶	Continuing ongoing experiments
I
 
n 1963, Yale Psychologist Stanley Milgram paid volunteers $4 to “teach” 
another volunteer new vocabulary words. If the learner got the words wrong, 
he or she received an electric shock! Or so the participants believed . . . no 
shocks were actually given. Regardless, a majority of participants believed that 
they were shocked, which led to a concern over the ethical treatment of study 
participants.
Even though no one is getting shock treatments for wrong answers anymore, 
the debate over ethical treatment continues. There will always be problems 
with the way some companies handle data, especially companies that exploit 
new technology that people aren’t familiar with. But you can avoid being one 
of those companies.
	
If you don’t treat your customers or study participants in a fair manner (or in a 
manner they expect), not only will you risk losing your current customers, but 
it also may turn loyal customers who are currently promoters into former cus-
tomers who discourage others from purchasing or using a product or service.
Getting Informed Consent
In the years since the Milgram studies, it’s become common to provide par-
ticipants with an informed consent form. It lets participants know the general 
topic of the study, and informs them that they can stop (opt out) any time, 
regardless of what the experiment demands. Here’s how you go about getting 
informed consent from your participants:

✓	Get signatures. Even when you’re not conducting a lab-based study, you’re 
collecting data from volunteers and subjecting them to questioning, analy-
sis, and observation. If the data deals with sensitive information (financial 
data or other personal data), consider having them sign an informed con-
sent document stating that they understand the purpose of the test, what 
their participation means, and what their remuneration (if any) is.
	
✓	Offer a verbal explanation. Whether or not you provide a formal docu-
ment for participants to sign, always explain what participants will be 
asked to do (at least in high-level terms) and ask if participants under-
stand or have questions.
	
✓	Be as clear as possible. A lot of user research happens well beyond the 
confines of a laboratory. No matter what environment you conduct your 
experiments in, always make it clear what users are volunteering for. 
New technology and methods can lead to a blurring of ethical lines.
	
✓	Include how you are using their data. Everyone always wants to know 
how his or her data is being used. Reassure participants that their data 
will remain private.
In the following sections, I discuss some interesting experiments conducted 
by well-known brands that ultimately went wrong because their users didn’t 
understand what they were consenting to. I also explain how you can avoid 
the same mistakes.
Facebook
Early in 2014, Facebook made headlines for conducting a large-scale experi-
ment on a small fraction of its billion users — small still being 700,000 users.
Users unknowingly had their newsfeeds manipulated for one week to show 
them either positive or negative postings. The results of the study showed that 
exposure to positive posts resulted in users producing positive posts, too. The 
same was true of the negative posts. In other words, emotional sentiments 
were contagious. Good news didn’t lead to people feeling glum; it actually led 
them to feel better.
The results were quickly overshadowed by outrage over Facebook using 
information to manipulate users.
Facebook discloses the latitudes it can take in its privacy policy and terms 
of use, but few people read, much less understand, the implications of terms 
and conditions and privacy policies. For example, on average, customers 
spend just six seconds looking at the terms and conditions of their software 
products. These are documents that, if read in full, can take several minutes 
to read, so those six seconds probably represent the time it takes customers 
to click “Accept” without considering what they are consenting to.

251
 Chapter 16: Considering the Ethics of Customer Analytics
The big takeaway for you is to always make sure your participants know 
they’re agreeing to participate in a study, even if they sign a consent form. 
After all, those Facebook users all agreed to Facebook’s terms of uses, but 
not many knew that meant Facebook could filter what they saw on their 
timelines.
OKCupid
The dating website OKCupid admitted that, among other things, it paired 
up people who were poor matches according to their dating algorithm. The 
results of the experiment suggested that the act of telling someone that she 
was a good match was as important as actually being a good match. Users 
were notified that they were involved in a study and were shown the correct 
compatibility percentages after it was concluded.
This sort of manipulation was likely covered under the terms and conditions 
the users agreed to when using the website. But just like with Facebook, most 
users probably didn’t read or understand those terms and conditions.
Also, OKCupid told users about the study after it was over. To avoid the same 
mistake, be up front with customers about how information may be changed 
and give them a way to opt out. If you explain how the data manipulations 
and analysis will ultimately benefit them, you may have a high opt-in rate, and 
likely fewer irate customers.
Amazon and Orbitz
Amazon has been a pioneer of many things on the web. In 2000, it was revealed 
that Amazon was adjusting the pricing of some of its products based on past 
browsing behavior. So one customer would pay more or less than the next 
person who bought the same item.
Orbitz also came under fire for revealing that it prioritizes hotels based on 
data that showed Mac users were 40 percent more likely to book a 4- or 5-star 
hotel than PC users. Mac users would be shown more expensive alternatives 
when searching.
The line between using customer segments to personalize products and 
experiences is a fuzzy one. Be sure customers understand how recommenda-
tions will change based on their preferences or profile.

Mint.com
The financial planning website Mint.com invited some participants to use a 
new beta feature that separated business and personal accounts. After a year 
of collecting data from users who meticulously entered financial information, 
Mint.com turned off the feature without notice. Previously entered data and 
reports were no longer accessible. These actions were permissible under the 
terms of use.
Your takeaway is to always tell participants what you’re doing with their 
data, and what access they’ll have to their own data. Most people are reas-
sured when their data ultimately remains under their control.
Deciding to Experiment
Most people understand that their actions and data are being monitored and 
used for commercial purposes. But you can minimize their concerns by fol-
lowing these tips:
	
✓	Privacy/anonymity: Where possible, ensure both privacy and anonymity. 
When you collect survey data or conduct a usability or findability study, 
avoid collecting personally identifiable information unless it’s absolutely 
necessary. When it is, be sure the participant is informed and take effec-
tive measure to keep that information secure. The National Security 
Agency (NSA) has made headlines for how it has data on millions of 
Americans and that data is associated with names, Social Security 
Numbers, and addresses. In the commercial world, real names and identi-
ties are generally less important.
	
✓	Disclosure: At the very least, you need to disclose what you’re doing — 
or might do — with user information. Write the language in the terms of 
use clearly. Avoid legalese that few understand.
	
✓	Retention and access to customer data: If you collect data from custom-
ers, especially data that requires labor (like providing content), make it 
available for those customers to download or use in other forms. The 
more sensitive the data (family photos, financial information, taxes), the 
more important it is. If that’s not possible, make it clear up front.
Privacy, disclosure, and anonymity are necessary but not sufficient when 
your goal is to treat your participants in an ethical manner. You can take the 
additional step to make sure users comprehend what they’re participating in. 
This gives users an opportunity to opt out of your study if they want to.

 Chapter 16: Considering the Ethics of Customer Analytics
	
Test how well users actually understand the terms they’re agreeing to. You can 
set up a study to assess how well participants comprehend the terms and con-
ditions. For example, I worked with a large credit card issuer and presented 
several variations on wording and images so customers understood things 
like interest rates and fees. A series of open- and closed-ended questions was 
asked to assess their comprehension after being exposed to the terms. Terms 
were picked that led to the highest level of comprehension and helped iterate 
the language to write more understandable terms.
The popular practice of A/B testing is one of the most effective ways for web-
site owners to understand which design elements lead to higher purchases, 
donations, or registration rates (see Chapter 10). But at what point does 
A/B testing — and other techniques that manipulate customers and their 
data — become unethical? 
Professional organizations like the User Experience Professionals Association 
(UxPA) available at http://www.usabilityprofessionals.org/
about_upa/leadership/code_of_conduct.html and Direct Marketing 
Association (DMA) have codes of conduct that offer a good guide for 
researchers (https://thedma.org/wp-content/uploads/DMA-
Ethics-Guidelines.pdf). Among other things, the codes cover similar 
topics I discuss here, including consent and disclosure. The organizations’ 
guides also delve into marketing to children and using sweepstakes.

Ten Customer Metrics You 
Should Collect
In This Chapter
▶	Identifying the most useful metrics
▶	Improving revenues by improving your knowledge about your customers
Y
 
ou can quantify the value of your customers throughout the customer 
journey in myriad ways. While the “best” metrics depend on your goals 
and specific context, most organizations should collect these ten.
These metrics are a mix of the four types of customer analytics to collect: 
descriptive, behavioral, interaction, and attitudinal (as described in Chapter 2).
Customer Revenue
Understanding where, when, and how much top-line revenue is being gener-
ated is probably already being done. However, it’s often not being effectively 
tracked on a customer-by-customer basis. Tracking how much revenue is 
generated by each customer allows you to understand both which custom-
ers and which customer segments are responsible for the majority of your 
revenue.
	
The Pareto Principle says that usually a minority of customers is responsible 
for the majority of your revenue.
See Chapter 4 for more details on using the Pareto Principle.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
Customer Satisfaction
Revenue doesn’t last if customers aren’t happy. Fortunately, you can measure 
customer satisfaction in many ways. Ask customers how satisfied they are 
with your product or service on a numbered scale. The American Customer 
Satisfaction Index (ACSI) database, maintained by the University of Michigan, 
is a popular tool that consists of multiple questions and provides a reference 
database.
	
Don’t worry too much about the phrasing of customer satisfaction questions 
or the total number of response options. It’s more important to collect satis-
faction data early and often.
Use multiple sources of data (existing customers, former customers, and 
third-party reports) and different points in time to understand how your 
product or service is perceived. Chapter 9 provides more information on 
measuring customer attitudes and Chapter 11 digs into customer satisfaction.
Customer Profitability
Companies don’t stay in business (at least not for long) by selling for $5 prod-
ucts that cost $10 to make. Knowing revenue by customer is the first step. 
The next step is to understand the cost associated with that revenue.
Certain customer segments will be more profitable, due to factors such as 
low price sensitivity or less use of customer support. Identify these particu-
larly valuable customers and, in most cases, treat them differently by offering 
customized incentives, perks (first-class upgrade, anyone?), product features, 
or other means of gaining and retaining their loyalty.
See Chapter 4 for guidance on segmenting your customers.
Customer Lifetime Value
Have you ever wondered why cable companies offer really low prices for the 
first few months then increase the rates? The total revenue over the lifetime 
as a customer (usually years) offsets the losses the providers absorb in the 
initial period to gain a customer. A long-term projection into the future profit-
ability of a customer is called the customer lifetime value.

259
 Chapter 17: Ten Customer Metrics You Should Collect
A customer lifetime isn’t usually the life span of a person, but rather the 
days, months, or years a customer spends using your products or services. 
Acquiring a customer often comes with large initial costs, but these are 
(hopefully) offset by higher revenue over time.
The steps you need to compute the lifetime value of your customers (and 
segments) can be found in Chapter 6.
Brand Awareness
How many customers even know a product or company exists? You can mea-
sure brand awareness using unaided or aided recall. With unaided recall, you 
ask participants to name the brands or products that come to mind when 
considering a certain category — for example, toothpaste or luxury watches. 
You can also have customers or prospects rate how familiar they are with 
certain brands using simple scales from not at all familiar to familiar.
Methods for measuring brand awareness can be found in Chapter 8.
Top Tasks
Every product, website, or software application has multiple functions, but 
customers are usually interested in only a handful of them. Identify these 
tasks and be sure users can effectively complete them and are satisfied with 
the experience. A top-task analysis helps to separate the many trivial tasks 
from the critical few that matter to your customers.
	
Think about all the tasks Microsoft Word can do: mail-merging, macros, desk-
top publishing. Yet, most users only want to accomplish a few core tasks, such 
as writing and formatting documents.
The same observation applies to health-insurance websites: They are full of 
places to click, information to read, and features to use. Yet, when my com-
pany conducted a top-task analysis with customers, it found that only two 
actions — finding a doctor and seeing if insurance would pay for a specific 
procedure — were top tasks. Unfortunately, many insurance provider web-
sites don’t make accomplishing these tasks easy. This affects both customer 
satisfaction and loyalty.
Read Chapter 13 for information about identifying customers’ top tasks.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
Customer Loyalty
Customers who come back, repurchase, or recommend a product to friends 
or colleagues, are key drivers of a product’s long-term viability.
The popular Net Promoter Score (NPS) is one way to measure customers’ 
likelihood to say positive or negative things about their experiences with 
products or services. The likelihood to recommend is often a good indicator 
of future company growth. To measure loyalty, you should track both
	
✓	Intentions (are you likely to repurchase or recommend?)
	
✓	Actions (did customers actually repurchase or recommend?)
See Chapter 12 for a detailed discussion on measuring customer loyalty.
Conversion Rate
For online campaigns, direct marketing, donations, or just sales copy, it is 
useful to determine the percentage of customers who are exposed and who 
ultimately purchase a product (or sign up for a service). It enables you to 
understand how small changes in design, pricing, features, or content can 
increase or decrease the percentage of prospective customers who are 
gained or kept.
When I helped the Wikipedia team understand the differences in donation 
rates they saw on their website, we looked at the different images, copy, 
and the time of day that led to higher rates of browsers becoming donating 
customers.
See Chapter 10 for tracking conversion rates and customer purchases.
Completion Rate
Customers want to get things done. If they can’t complete tasks, especially 
their top tasks, with a product or website, not much else matters.
	
I often call completion rates the gateway customer experience metric.

261
 Chapter 17: Ten Customer Metrics You Should Collect
Completion rates are applicable to activities like finding products, searching 
for information on websites, solving tasks in architecture software, entering 
a journal entry in accounting software, or getting a problem solved by a cus-
tomer service representative. Poor task completion rates lead to lower satis-
faction levels and a drop in the likelihood to recommend.
Chapter 15 provides more information on measuring completion rates as part 
of usability evaluations.
Churn Rate
It isn’t just about getting customers; it’s also about keeping them. If custom-
ers never repurchase a product or service, or abandon as soon as they can, 
that has a long-term negative effect on profitability.
This so-called churn rate is especially true because the cost of acquiring cus-
tomers is generally higher than the cost of keeping them. Valuable pieces of 
information include the percentage of customers who abandon at time inter-
vals (for example, after one or two years) or stages (for example, renewal 
time or product upgrades) and the reason for abandonment. For example, 
while offering products like a cable subscription at a low price for a few 
months to lure customers may generate more total customers, if too many 
abandon when the prices increase, it may outweigh the new customer incen-
tives and drive potential customers away.
Chapter 12 shows the effects of churn and customer retention rates.

Ten Methods to Improve the 
Customer Experience
In This Chapter
▶	Understanding your customers
▶	Improving your customers’ experience
▶	Prioritizing improvements
M
 
easuring, managing, and improving the customer experience involves 
collecting good metrics and keeping track of them. Following are ten 
methods to use to improve the customer experience with websites, mobile 
apps, software, and hardware and services.
True Intent/Voice of Customer Study
You can be a successful company for quite a while without really knowing 
who your customers are. At some point, though, it makes financial sense to 
understand the basic demographics of the people who purchase, repeat pur-
chase, and recommend your company and products to friends.
For companies with a strong web presence, a True Intent Study with a web 
intercept or conspicuous link and survey allows willing customers to let 
you know who they are (age, gender, occupation, salary) and what they are 
trying to do (goals, tasks, and interests). This becomes vital information for 
subsequent customer metrics and methods.
In addition to website intercepts, you should also target past customers to 
understand the same core aspects of who they are and what they do or want 
to do with your product and company. This way, you aren’t relying exclusively 
on website visitors who may not be representative of your customer base.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
Customer Segmentation
All customers are not created equal. With data from a True Intent Study, 
Voice of Customer Survey, and other data sources, you can begin to under-
stand what differentiates your customers based on demographics, behaviors, 
and profitability. Not only does segmenting customers tell you how to better 
serve current customer demographics, but it also allows you to discover any 
unmet needs and deliver better products and services in the future.
Read Chapter 4 to learn how to segment your customer base.
Persona Development
It’s hard to develop for a conceptual group of hypothetical customers. 
A persona helps focus product development and marketing efforts on 
real customer needs and goals rather than just abstract demographics. 
It embodies the key characteristics of a customer segment by highlighting 
salient demographics, goals, and top tasks for development teams.
Personas represent fictional customers but should be based on real data 
obtained from customer segmentation analyses, ethnographic research, sur-
veys, and interviews. Chapter 5 provides more information on personas and 
their development process.
Journey Mapping
Rarely do customers follow a simple linear path from prospect to customer. 
A customer journey map helps identify problem areas customers encounter 
while engaging a product or service and can locate opportunities for improve-
ment. It can also help unify often disparate and competing efforts within the 
same organization by providing different departments with a single docu-
ment that maps the customer’s entire experience with a product, service, or 
company.
In Chapter 7, I explain how to map the customer journey more precisely.
Top-Task Analysis
A product or website can’t do everything for everyone. Despite there being 
dozens to hundreds of features and functions supported by products and 
websites, customers usually want to perform only a small number of tasks.
www.it-ebooks.info
WWW.EBOOK777.COM

free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
265
 Chapter 18: Ten Methods to Improve the Customer Experience
A top-task analysis helps separate the critical few tasks from the trivial many 
by having customers pick their most essential tasks. Targeting your efforts 
on significant tasks and delivering a solid experience where it has the biggest 
impact means more satisfied customers and customers who are more willing 
to repeat purchase, return, and recommend to friends.
See Chapter 13 for more details on conducting top-task analyses.
Usability Study
Just because a product has all the right features and is priced right doesn’t 
mean it will be a big seller. If customers find it difficult to use your product or 
website, they’ll look for easier alternatives and are less likely to reuse, repur-
chase, and recommend.
Observing just a few customers who use the product can uncover most of the 
common problems with an interface. Use data from a top-tasks analysis to under-
stand what users want to accomplish and find users who match your customer 
segments. The most important concept to understand in a usability study is that 
it is not what customers think or want that matters, but to observe them using 
the product.
Read Chapter 14 for conducting usability studies.
Findability Study
One of the biggest pain points on the web and with software is just trying to 
find where features are buried. A findability study is a specialized usability 
study that focuses on the taxonomy (labels and hierarchy) and ignores dis-
tractions such as the design, layout, and search capabilities. It’s used for test-
ing everything from cable TV interfaces and the Settings screen on an iPhone 
to product categories on a large e-commerce website.
Findability studies use the methods of tree testing and card sorting to uncover 
problems and identify fixes. If this sounds complicated, Chapter 15 can help 
you understand better.
Conjoint Analysis
Customers usually want a lot of features for a low price, or for free. Just 
asking customers what they want is usually insufficient for understanding 
what really matters. A statistical technique called Choice Based Conjoint 
www.it-ebooks.info
WWW.EBOOK777.COM

266
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Analysis produces a more accurate view of customer ratings by isolating 
which features have the biggest impact on preference. A conjoint analysis 
is typically used in the product development stages to understand which 
features to build or how changing price or options affects customers’ future 
behavior. The conjoint analysis is one of a number of prioritization tech-
niques used to help get the biggest bang for the development buck.
See Chapter 13 for more details on prioritizing customer requirements.
Key Driver Analysis
A key driver analysis identifies which features contribute the most to cus-
tomer satisfaction, customer loyalty, or any other key variable of interest. 
Have customers rate their satisfaction with the most important features or 
functional areas of an experience. Include items on quality, features, value, 
service, and usability where appropriate. A key driver analysis provides the 
relative weight of each of these ratings using multiple regression analysis. 
A key driver analysis is typically performed after a product, website, or ser-
vice has been in use for a while to evaluate what to improve, add, or remove.
Read the appendix and Chapter 12 to learn how to conduct a key driver 
analysis.
Gap Analysis
Conjoint analyses and key driver analyses usually require advanced soft-
ware and some statistical sophistication to conduct and interpret. Another 
prioritization technique, called a gap analysis, can be performed more easily 
by asking customers to first rate or rank the most important features and 
aspects of a product or service. Then, have the same customers rate or rank 
how satisfied they are with each of the features. For each feature, find the 
“gap” by subtracting the average satisfaction rating from the average impor-
tance rating. The largest gap identifies the features that are the most impor-
tant but with which customers are least satisfied and therefore presents the 
best opportunities for improvement.
In Chapter 13, I cover how to conduct a gap analysis.

Ten Common Analytic Mistakes

▶	Increasing analysis efficiency
C
 
ollecting, analyzing, and making decisions from data is the heart of cus-
tomer analytics. But whether you’re new to data analysis or have been 
doing it a while, ten common mistakes can affect the quality of your results. 
You should be on the lookout for them. They follow, and I include some ideas 
on how to avoid them as well.
Optimizing around the Wrong Metric
Metrics exist for just about anything in an organization and most probably 
are collected for a good reason. Be sure the metric you want to optimize will 
achieve not just your goals, but also your customers’ goals.
If airlines optimize around on-time departure instead of on-time arrival, an 
airplane that pulls away from the gate and sits on the tarmac is a metric suc-
cess even though the customers feel the experience is disappointing as they 
arrive at their destination an hour late. If you optimize around the number 
of calls answered in one hour at a call center, you are placing quantity over 
quality. While customers generally want to get resolution quickly, are their 
issues being properly addressed?
	
Be sure your metrics are meaningful to your customer and that optimizing 
those metrics makes for a better experience.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
Relying Too Much on Behavioral 
or Attitudinal Data
Mining customer transactions can reveal a lot of patterns in things like what 
products customers purchase together or the average time between pur-
chases. But this behavioral data doesn’t necessarily help you understand the 
attitudes and motivations behind why customers purchase things together. 
This attitudinal data can more easily be collected using surveys or other 
methods of asking customers.
Not Having a Large Enough Sample Size
If you’re looking to detect small differences in metrics, like conversion rates 
or customer attitudes, and you’re measuring a sample of customers or data, 
be sure your sample size is large enough to detect that difference. Use the 
sample size tables in this book or consult a statistician to know what sample 
size you’ll need ahead of time.
	
A lot of cost and effort are wasted on looking for very small differences in cus-
tomer attitudes, such as satisfaction, perception of usability, or likelihood to 
recommend after making very small changes to products or websites with too 
small of a sample size.
Eyeballing Data and Patterns
I call it “eyeballing statistics.” It’s the tendency to think you can detect pat-
terns from data by examining it without any statistics. For very large pat-
terns, you can see these easily without any computations, but these sorts of 
obvious patterns rarely show up. To minimize the chance that you’re being 
fooled by randomness in data, use statistics and mathematical computations 
to differentiate the news from the noise.
Confusing Statistical Significance 
with Practical Significance
With a large sample size, you’ll be able to detect very small differences and 
patterns that are statistically significant. Statistical significance just means 
that the pattern or difference is not due to random noise in your data. But 
www.it-ebooks.info
WWW.EBOOK777.COM

269
 Chapter 19: Ten Common Analytic Mistakes
that doesn’t mean that what’s detected will have much practical importance. 
Analytics programs will flag different patterns and differences, but you need 
to determine if a 1% difference in conversion rates results will have a major 
or negligible impact. This depends on the context but means you’ll need to 
exercise judgment and not blindly follow the software. Don’t immediately 
think every statistically significant result is meaningful. Think through the 
business implications of the result carefully. See the appendix for more of a 
discussion on statistical versus practical significance.
Not Having an Interdisciplinary Team
If you have a stats PhD crunching numbers in your company basement, it 
may generate the right insights; but if sales, marketing, service, or product 
teams aren’t involved, it’s going to be difficult to get buy-in and implement 
the insights. Get the right people and teams involved in your initiative early 
and look to have complementary skills, including mathematical, software, 
business, marketing, and product experience.
Not Cleaning Your Data First
Garbage In, Garbage Out (GIGO) is a common phrase data junkies like to use 
to explain that data that has problems before analysis will have problems 
after analysis. This can be anything from mismatched data pulled from data-
bases (customer names don’t match transactions) or missing values. If the 
data is bad going in, you’ll have bad insights coming out. Before running any 
analysis, do a quality check on your data by selecting a sample of data and 
auditing it for quality. Corroborate it with other sources to verify its accuracy.
Improperly Formatted Data
When you analyze your data, at least half of the effort is spent formatting 
the data so your software can properly analyze it. This often involves dis-
aggregating and getting customer transactions or survey data in rows and 
columns.
	
Skimping on proper formatting usually means a lot of rework later, so be sure 
your data is formatted properly — and early.

Not Having Clear Research 
Questions to Answer
Sometimes it’s fine to have a fishing expedition and examine patterns in data. 
But don’t stop with the fishing expedition; use what you find to form hypoth-
eses about customer behavior and look to confirm, refine, or reject these 
hypotheses with additional data.
Waiting for Perfect Data
Every dataset tends to have some problem of some sort. Some are minor, 
like a few missing fields; others are major, with lots of missing fields and mis-
matched data. For survey data, there always seems to be a concern about 
how a question was asked and to whom it was asked. That said, expect some 
imperfection in all your datasets and surveys. But don’t let it stop you from 
working with what you have. Just be cautious about your interpretation.

Ten Methods for Identifying 
Customer Needs
In This Chapter
▶	Finding sources of customer data
▶	Visualizing the customers’ experience
A
 
n innovative product doesn’t come from a law passed by the govern-
ment. It also doesn’t come from venture capitalists looking for a higher 
return on an investment. Innovation comes from identifying customers’ needs 
and providing solutions that meet those needs.
Companies like Uber, Airbnb, and Intuit understand this. Uber’s success, for 
example, has come not from building new, better taxis, but from seeing — and 
then solving — people’s transportation problems.
Want to know where to put your innovation efforts? Uncover your customers’ 
unmet needs using the methods I discuss in this chapter.
	
Although you might not be working on the next Airbnb, Uber, or even a prod-
uct you think is exciting, like business software, or temperature controls, 
understanding and identifying customer needs may lead to a revolutionary 
innovation. After all, Nest revolutionized the rather mundane industry of ther-
mostats and changed how everyone heats and cools houses.

Starting with Existing Data
You most likely have existing data at your fingertips. Review past surveys, 
customer interviews, and customer-support call logs. There’s no point in 
funding an extensive and expensive research campaign if the data you need is 
already collected.
	
Save the budget for data you don’t have and more advanced questions you 
need answered.
Interviewing Stakeholders
Why not begin with the data you don’t have to pay for: the collective knowl-
edge stakeholders have. Start with sales and support teams. They know the 
product and the customer. They often have a list of feature requests, bug 
reports, and enhancements — straight from the customer’s mouth.
Combine these to generate a preliminary list of requirements. Look for pat-
terns, but don’t automatically dismiss one-offs — look to corroborate them 
with findings from other methods.
Mapping the Customer Process
If you know your customer’s process, map it out.
For example, before Uber, to get a ride you called a taxi company, waited to 
reach a dispatcher, waited for a car to be dispatched, hoped the driver would 
find you, and hoped you had enough cash when you reached your destina-
tion. With Uber, you open your smartphone and summon the nearest car 
with one tap; you already know how far away the car is because you can see 
it in real time on a map. The driver also sees your location so he or she can 
come right to you. Figure 20-1 shows a simple process map comparing these 
experiences.

Mapping the Customer Journey
A customer journey map is a visualization of the process a customer goes 
through when engaging with a product or service. It takes process map-
ping to a new level by including multiple phases and touchpoints a person 
goes through — from prospect to loyal customer. It’s a document meant to 
unify fragmented efforts and identify points of friction and opportunities for 
improvement.
Finding and fixing the pain points in a customer’s journey isn’t just about 
damage control: It’s also about the innovation that comes from fixing the 
pain. See Chapter 7 for examples and how to map the customer journey.

Conducting “Follow Me Home” Research
“Follow me home” research relies on observation by literally following a cus-
tomer home or to work. You follow a customer to her workplace, spending 
the day watching her do her job. You observe process pain points and then 
look for opportunities for improvement.
For example, during a “follow me home” exercise, a team of researchers at 
Intuit noticed that retail customers were exporting their transactions from 
their point-of-sale cash registers into QuickBooks to manage their books. 
This step took time and sometimes led to failure and frustration. The inno-
vative solution? Developers integrated QuickBooks into a cash register and 
eliminated the export step for customers and created a new version called 
QuickBooks Point of Sale (POS).
Interviewing Customers
Go right to the source: Ask customers what problems they have and what 
features they want. Even when customers can’t articulate their needs clearly, 
you can often gain insights that lead to successful innovations.
	
Use the “Five Whys” technique to help you discover what needs people don’t 
even know they have, needs that no one has recognized before: Keep asking 
why until you get at the root cause of the problem and not a symptom. (It’s 
called “Five Whys” because you often have to go through five levels before you 
get to the point where you can make a change that addresses the problem.)
Conducting Voice of  
Customer Surveys
Voice of Customer surveys collect data, from email or from a pop-up on a 
website, about the attitudes and expectations of existing or prospective cus-
tomers. Use a mix of open- and closed-ended questions to see what produces 
the most useful data.
Although customers aren’t necessarily good at identifying their needs, this 
type of survey often yields data from which you can discern customer goals, 
challenges, problems, and attitudes, and then recommend opportunities for 
improvement.

 Chapter 20: Ten Methods for Identifying Customer Needs
Analyzing Your Competition
Consider using research firms that might present a more objective face to 
customers who engage with your organization and its competition. Consider 
using the SWOT rule: Identify your competitors’ strengths, weaknesses, oppor-
tunities, and threats. You can use a SWOT for a brand, product, or even an 
experience.
	
Define the competition both narrowly and broadly. Don’t just look at your 
competition in the same industry, but other industries as well. For example, 
when I tested the online-checkout experiences for a U.S.-based mobile carrier, 
I considered the competitors in the same industry (Sprint, Verizon, and AT&T) 
as well as companies in other industries (DirecTV and Comcast) whose web-
sites have a checkout process that integrates products and service contracts.
Analyzing Cause-and-Effect 
Relationships
No one will disagree that it’s usually good to think positively, but sometimes, 
negative thinking can solve problems more effectively. Through observations, 
surveys, and other data sources, you may find problems that are actually just 
symptoms of other root cause problems.
Task failures, errors, and long task times are usually the symptoms of multi-
ple underlying problems. These can be problems in the interface or a discon-
nection with the user’s goals. Through the process of asking “Why?” multiple 
times and segmenting different causes, you can help identify and address 
root problems in the user experience.
Recording Experiences 
through Diary Studies
Sometimes opportunities reveal themselves over time. One cost-effective 
longitudinal method is a diary study. Ask participants to record problems, 
frustrations, positive experiences, or thoughts at intervals throughout a 
day, week, or even a year. This can be low tech, with customers writing their

experiences and thoughts down on paper and mailing it in, or high tech, in 
which you send text messages or emailed surveys to customers at particular 
intervals.
Because you’re asking your customer to do the data collection for you, be 
sure you have targeted questions and clear hypotheses you want to test with 
all the data that gets collected.
Expect a good percentage of customers to drop out or not be 100% diligent 
about filling out their diaries. Still, any information you can garner is better 
than no information at all. After all, you can’t fix what you don’t know about.

In This Appendix
▶	Recognizing relationships

P
 
redictive analytics comprises several methods to analyze what happened in 
the past to predict what will most likely happen in the future. You use your 
historical and transactional customer data to identify risks and opportunities.
You’ve almost surely encountered the results of predictive analytics as a cus-
tomer yourself. Some examples you likely encounter include
	
✓	Amazon’s recommendation: Probably one of the most famous examples 
of predictive analytics that touch the customer is Amazon’s recommen-
dation engine. This includes the “customers who purchased this book, 
also purchased this book.”
	
✓	Facebook and LinkedIn: Social media websites like Facebook and 
LinkedIn use algorithms to determine both whom you might want to 
connect to and which stories and updates you want in your timeline 
based on patterns in your viewing behavior and people with similar 
behavior to you.
	
✓	Netflix: Netflix recommends which movie or TV show you’ll like based 
on your past views and matching that to customers with similar 
behavior.
	
✓	Return rates: I worked with a mobile carrier to predict which phones 
customers would return most often based on the opinion of customers 
evaluating the phone’s usability.
	
✓	Credit cards: Your credit score and credit report are the results of the 
banking and credit industry wanting to predict who is more likely to pay 
on time and those who will more likely default.

✓	Insurance: Life insurance, car insurance, and health insurance providers 
notoriously collect a number of data points about customers to predict 
which customers will more likely get sick and need care, have a higher 
chance of dying prematurely, or are more likely to get into a car accident.
In all these examples, some past customer data is being used to predict 
future events. The same principle applies to customer analytics: using past 
customer behavior to predict future behavior. Throughout this book, I’ve cov-
ered both what customer analytics to collect and methods to collect them.  
With these analytics collected to describe the customers’ current and past 
experience with products and services, you can also predict the future. This 
appendix is a primer to help you get started with the skills needed to predict 
with customer analytics.
Three essential techniques to make predictions with customer analytics 
include
	
✓	Finding similarities: Identify how customers are similar, either based on 
behavior like purchase history or attitudes like customer satisfaction
	
✓	Identifying trends and patterns: Predict when customers will purchase, 
future revenue, website page views, subscription rates, or same-store 
sales.
	
✓	Detecting differences: Understand how customers differ or respond dif-
ferently to product features and designs, which allows for customizing 
products, experiences, and pricing.
Finding Similarities and Associations
Finding similarities and associations with customer analytics data is the most 
common analysis technique to predict future customer behavior. Some exam-
ples of the types of questions based on making associations with customer 
data include:
	
✓	For customers who purchase product A, what other products do they 
purchase?
	
✓	Will coupons increase same-store sales?
	
✓	Does a longer time on a website result in more purchases?
	
✓	Will a reduced price mean higher sales?
	
✓	Is customer loyalty tied to future company growth?
	
✓	Does the change in home page design cause higher conversions?

 Appendix: Predicting with Customer Analytics
Understanding the relationship between variables, how strong that associa-
tion is, and ultimately the cause of outcome variables, is a fundamental and 
useful skill for predicting with customer analytics.
Visualizing associations
You can visualize the relationship between two variables by graphing them in 
a scatterplot. Scatterplots are a useful tool to identify associations and exam-
ine the strength of the relationship.
Figure A-1 shows the relationship between the time it takes customers to 
make a purchase on a website using their mobile phone and how many 
finger taps the purchase took. This data came from a usability study (see 
Chapter 14) from 181 participants on an e-commerce mobile site.
	
Figure A-1: 
A scat-
terplot 
between 
mobile 
phone 
“taps” 
and the 
amount of 
time it took 
to make a 
purchase.
	
In Figure A-1, each dot represents 1 of the 181 customers’ time and how many 
taps it took them to make the purchase:
	
✓	The horizontal axis (called the x-axis) shows the number of taps.
	
✓	The vertical axis (called the y-axis) shows the number of seconds it took 
for each participant to check out.
Figure A-2 shows the same scatterplot with an arrow pointing to one customer 
who took 50 seconds to make the purchase with 16 taps.
As the number of taps increase, so too does the time it takes the customer to 
check out. You can infer a positive association between the two pieces of data.

tomer took

Quantifying the strength of a relationship
You can numerically quantify the strength of an association by using the 
Pearson Product Moment Correlation. It’s often just called the correlation 
coefficient and is represented by the symbol r. The correlation is used to 
quantify the association between two continuous variables, (such as reve-
nue, time, or rating scales). (See Chapter 2 for a reminder on the difference 
between continuous and discrete variables.) I cover associations between 
binary variables later in this appendix.
The correlation coefficient varies from an r of -1, which indicates a perfect 
negative correlation to 1, which means a perfect positive correlation. Figure A-3 
shows three examples of scatterplots that show a perfect negative correlation 
(r = -1), no relationships (r = 0), and a perfect positive relationship (r = 1).

 Appendix: Predicting with Customer Analytics
	
Using two perfectly correlated variables isn’t helpful. They’re redundant; if 
you have the value for one variable, you can perfectly predict the other.
In practice, correlations are weak to strong. Some examples of correlations of 
different strengths include:
	
✓	Height and Weight: r = .8
	
✓	Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) and First-Year College Grades: r = .5
	
✓	Usability and Customer Loyalty: r = .7
The correlation between variables means that one variable can predict the 
value of the other variable:
	
✓	If you know a customer’s height, you can estimate his weight.
	
✓	If you know a customer’s weight, you can estimate his height.
But because these aren’t perfect correlations, the further a correlation is 
from 1 or -1, the more error you have in predicting one variable based on the 
other.
Computing a correlation
You can compute the correlation coefficient by hand, or use software like 
Excel to compute it for you.
To compute a correlation on a set of data using the Pearson Correlation for-
mula, follow these steps. (Refer to Figure A-1 for the data I’m using.)
	
1.	Set up the data in rows and columns in Excel.
	
	 Have one column for each variable and the customers’ IDs. Each row 
should represent the same customer’s data on two variables. Figure A-4 
shows 17 customers’ time to make the purchase and the number of taps 
needed for the purchase.
	
2.	In any cell, type
=PEARSON(
	
3.	Select all the values for the first variable.
	
	 My data for time appears in column B and the data goes from cell B2 to 
cell B182.
	
4.	Type a comma (,) and select all the values for the second variable.
	
	 My data appears in column C and the data goes from cell C2 to cell C182.
	
	 Be sure to select the same number of values for both variables.

5.	Close the parenthesis and then press Enter to get the correlation.
=PEARSON(B2:B182,C2:C182)
	
	 The correlation for this data, between taps and time, is .560666. As the 
scatterplot in Figure A-1 shows, there’s a positive correlation between 
time and taps.
	
Figure A-4: 
Setting up 
the data 
in Excel to 
compute a 
correlation.
	
Interpreting the strength of a correlation
Once you compute a correlation, you need to interpret the strength of the 
relationship. The correlation between taps and time is r = .56. Is that a strong 
correlation? It depends.
The strength of a correlation is context dependent. A “strong” correlation in 
one context may be a weak correlation in another. It depends on how much 
error you can tolerate and the consequences for being wrong in your pre-
dictions. Predicting time from taps probably won’t involve a loss of life or 
money, so it’s strong enough to be useful. In fact, it’s about the same strength 
of an association as between the SAT and first-year college grades — where 
there’s a lot at stake!
While correlations are context dependent, it can help to have some guidance 
on what you’ll likely see with customer analytics data. A famous researcher 
by the name of Jacob Cohen examined correlations in the behavioral

 Appendix: Predicting with Customer Analytics
sciences, something similar to measuring customer behavior, and provided 
the following rules based on how common the correlations were reported in 
the peer-review literature:
	
✓	Small r = .10
	
✓	Medium: r = .30
	
✓	Large r = .50
Therefore, one simple interpretation of correlation of r = .56 between taps 
and time is that it’s large. But there is another way of interpreting the correla-
tion coefficient, which I cover next.
Coefficient of determination r2
Multiplying the correlation coefficient by itself (squaring it) produces a 
metric known as the coefficient of determination. It’s represented as r2 (pro-
nounced r-squared) and provides a better way of interpreting the strength of 
a relationship.
For example, a correlation of r = .5 squared becomes .25. Note that r2 is often 
expressed as a percentage, 25%. For the correlation between taps and time, 
the r2 is 31%. That means taps can explain 31% of the variation in time. And 
conversely, time explains 31% of the variation in taps. As you can see, even 
a strong correlation of above r = .5 still explains a minority of the differences 
between variables.
Height, for example, explains around 64% of the variation in weight. That 
means that knowing people’s heights will explain most — but not all — of 
why they are a certain weight. Other factors explain 36% of the variation. That 
would include things like exercise, eating habits, or genetic factors that make 
some people weigh more at a certain height than others of the same height.
Use this same approach when correlating customer analytics. Find the correla-
tion, square it, and then interpret the r-squared value. When stakes are high, 
you want to have high correlations and explain most of the variation between 
variables. With customer analytics, there are usually multiple variables that 
predict another variable. I get to multiple regression later in this appendix.
Correlation is not causation
One of the most important concepts about correlation that you will hear 
repeated, because it’s worth repeating, is that correlation is not causation. 
That means just because one variable is correlated with another, doesn’t 
mean one variable is caused by another variable. Time doesn’t cause taps. 
SAT scores don’t cause higher grades. Net Promoter Scores don’t cause 
higher revenue (see Chapter 12).
You can say there is an association, but that association doesn’t imply causa-
tion. See the later section on ways to determine causation.

It could be that a new design causes higher website conversion rates or it 
could be that a coupon increases same-store sales. However, there could be 
other variables that are actually affecting the outcome variable. For example, 
it could be that same-store sales were already increasing because of an 
increase in customers. Or it could be that more customers are converting on 
a website (making a purchase) because the competitor website sold out of 
the same product — not because of your website design change. Always con-
sider what other variables might be affecting the relationship when making 
statements about causation.
Associations between binary variables
Very often in customer analytics, you encounter binary data that takes the 
form of yes/no, purchase/didn’t purchase, agree/disagree, and so forth (see 
Chapter 2). You need to understand the association between binary variables 
just as you need to understand the association between continuous variables 
that I describe in the preceding section. While the principle of correlation is 
the same with binary data, however, the computations are different.
One of the most famous and visible examples of predictive analytics with 
binary data is the Amazon recommendation engine, as shown in Figure A-5.
Figure A-5: 
Amazon’s 
recom-
mendation 
engine.
While the exact algorithm Amazon uses is proprietary, it’s known that much of 
it is based on an association that indicates that a person who purchases one 
book also purchases another book. The recommendations are based on binary 
variables. To generate a recommendation, Amazon computes the proportion 
of customers who purchase one book and the proportion of the same custom-
ers who purchase any number of other books. (See Chapter 2 for a reminder 
on binary data and proportions.) Books with the highest association are

recommended first, the next-highest associations next, and so forth. Figure A-6 
shows transactions from 15 customers across four books. These could just as 
likely be software, groceries, songs in a playlist, TV shows, or any products or 
services customers can select from.
If the customer purchased the book, there’s a 1 in the row; if she didn’t, there’s 
a 0. For example, Customer 1 purchased Book A and Book B, but not C or D. 
Customer 2 purchased only Book B.

tomer

as a yes/no

To compute the association between any two book purchases, follow these 
steps:
	
1.	Count the number of customers who purchased each of these combi-
nations of books:
	
•	Neither book
	
•	Both books
	
•	Only Book A
	
•	Only Book B
	
2.	Put the totals in a table, like this:
Book B
Book A
Y
N
Y
6
2
N
3
4
	
	 For example, six customers bought both Books A and B.

3.	Label the table cells A to D, like this:
Book B
Book A
Y
N
Y
a
b
N
c
d
	
4.	Use the formula for the correlation between binary variables:
	
	
	
5.	Fill in the values for the books to find the correlation between binary 
variables, like this:
	
	
	
	 In this case, the correlation between customers who purchase Book A 
and Book B is .327.
	
	 A correlation between binary variables is called phi, and is represented 
with the Greek symbol .
	
You can interpret the association between binary numbers the same way as 
the Pearson Correlation r. In fact, phi is a shortcut method for computing r. 
You get the same results by using the Excel Pearson formula and computing 
the correlation for all sets of data.
Figure A-7 shows the data setup in Excel. I computed the correlation between 
all pairs of books using the =PEARSON() Excel function.
I then created a matrix of correlations for each pair of books, as shown in 
Figure A-8.
Confirming the earlier result, the correlation between Book A and B is .33. 
The second-highest correlation is between Book A and Book D at .25.
The correlation between Book B and Book C is -.48. This negative correlation 
means that customers who purchase Book B are less likely to purchase Book C.
So if a customer is viewing and considering purchasing Book A, it would make 
sense to recommend (and possibly offer that customer an incentive) to also 
purchase Book B and D, but not Book C.

Determining Causation
While correlation alone is not causation, there are ways to determine and 
show causation between customer variables. The amount of faith you can 
have in claims of causation depends on the method used to collect the data. 
While you may think that a new web page design resulted in more page views, 
it could be that page views were already increasing.
You can use any of five methods to make claims about causation, starting 
from the strongest and proceeding through the weakest.
Randomized experimental study
Randomly assigning participants to different design treatments and/or a con-
trol in a research study is an experimental design. For example, if you wanted 
to know which design customers would understand the most on a check-out 
page, you can create three different designs:
	
✓	The dependent variable could be something like
	
•	Accuracy in answering questions
	
•	Difficulty in checking out
	
•	Confidence in checking out
	
•	Time to check out
	
✓	The independent variable is the design — with three variations.
The hallmark of experimental research is randomly assigning participants to 
different treatments. You identify the design that users correctly selected and 
were most confident in using to make their selection.
There are all sorts of variables you can’t control for — or are unaware of — 
that could impact results. But by randomly assigning participants to different 
designs or treatment conditions, you spread those nuisance variables evenly 
across designs. This increases the internal validity and generalizability of the 
findings.
As another example, researchers in Europe conducted an experiment in which 
they manipulated both the usability and visual appeal of an online e-commerce 
website. They essentially took one website, made the navigation intuitive 
or not intuitive, and then changed the colors and contrast to be appealing 
or unattractive. They found that customers find more usable websites more

 Appendix: Predicting with Customer Analytics
attractive. The researchers concluded that better usability increases opinions 
about attractiveness. Their conclusion is well-substantiated because they used 
a randomized experimental design.
Experiments (with random assignment) provide the strongest controls 
against extraneous variables and provide the highest levels of internal valid-
ity. These generate the strongest types of research results. But what happens 
if you cannot randomly assign participants?
Quasi-experimental design
If you want to test different conditions, but you cannot randomly assign par-
ticipants to the different conditions, then the study is quasi-experimental. 
For example, you might want to know if customers find the beta version of 
a software product more usable than an existing version. Customers of beta 
software usually volunteer to use the software during the beta-test period. 
This self-selection (non-random) assignment introduces a potential source of 
bias into the results. It has higher external validity because these groups are 
naturally segmented, but has lower internal reliability.
When you compare attitudes of usability (say from the SUS or SUPR-Q, as dis-
cussed in Chapter 9) from the beta software customers to the existing version 
customers and find a difference, the difference could be due to differences in 
the type of people using the software and not actual differences in the attitude. 
This type of problem is confounding and makes the quasi-experimental design 
type less internally valid than the experimental condition.
As another example, I worked with a national retailer a few years ago that 
wanted to know the effects of direct mail coupons for in-store purchases. 
I used two markets: One received one new coupon (treatment) and the other 
acquired the standard coupon (control) from newspaper inserts mailed 
to homes. I compared the sales of stores prior to the coupon and after the 
coupon in both markets.
I couldn’t randomly assign people to live in different cities, so I used two 
similarly sized midwestern advertising markets and looked to see what the 
new coupon did to sales. While I was able to show more sales with the new 
coupon, there was still some uncertainty about whether that difference was 
just due to other differences in the markets.
	
The weakness with quasi-experimental studies is that you can never be as 
sure as you can with random assignment that any increase in sales is attribut-
able to the variable (in this case, sales) or to other nuisance variables (in this 
case, just differences between the markets).

Correlational study
A correlational study, as the name suggests, is when you look at the relation-
ship between two variables and report the correlation. For example, the rela-
tionship between product usability and likelihood to recommend is a strong 
positive correlation (meaning ease is strongly associated with, and likely pre-
dicts, much of why users do and don’t recommend products).
	
While correlational studies provide valuable results, they don’t have random 
assignment and the independent variables aren’t manipulated, which lessens 
the internal validity of the findings and weakens the case for causation.
	
The next time you hear that one customer metric causes another metric, look 
to identify how that was determined. Chances are it was done with either a 
correlational study or a quasi-experimental design. That doesn’t mean one 
variable doesn’t cause another; it just means you can’t be as confident.
Single-subjects study
It’s often the case that getting access to customers is extremely difficult. For 
example, you might be interested in whether a new interface to a PET scan-
ner reduces the time it takes attending radiologists to adjust a setting on the 
scanner.
If you had access to one of these customers, you could ask her to perform 
a task on the existing software version three times, record how long it took 
to complete, have her attempt the same task three times on the new soft-
ware, and finally, have her attempt it again three times on the old version. 
Figure A-9 shows how this data looks on a scatterplot.
This type of single-subject study uses what’s called an ABA condition (where 
A is the existing software and B is the new software). The repeated trials help 
establish stability in the measures and increase the internal validity of the 
finding (as much as you can from a single subject).
	
The obvious limitation with the single-subject design is generalizability. All 
you know is that when you manipulate an independent variable (the software), 
task time goes down for one user. There could be a number of variables you’re 
not accounting for. For this reason, single-subject designs aren’t used very 
often in customer research.

You can actually use more than one participant in a single-subject design (for 
example, two or three radiologists) and use the same technique to establish 
the pattern. To be more sophisticated in your analysis, you can also use time 
series analysis to examine trends over time and by condition for each user or 
the data in aggregate (I discuss time series analysis later in this chapter).
Anecdotes
Unfortunately, many business decisions are made based on opinion or hear-
ing from a vocal customer or sales rep. While a good story of a successful 
product strategy can be convincing emotionally, it carries little weight when 
establishing causation.
Predicting with Regression
While a correlation speaks to the strength of a relationship between two 
variables, and the r2 helps explain that strength of the relationship, what you 
need to do to predict one variable from another is to use an extension of cor-
relation called regression analysis. Regression analysis is known as a “work-
horse” in predictive analytics. The math isn’t too complicated, and most 
software packages support regression analysis.

Regression analysis extends the idea of the scatterplot used in correlation 
and adds a line that best “fits” the data.
	
One of the requirements of using correlations and regression analysis is that 
the data is linear. Linear means a line can reasonably describe the relationship 
between variables and then be used to predict values that don’t appear in 
your data (future customer data points). If the scatterplot of your data forms a 
curve, or any shape that a line doesn’t fit well, you may get misleading results.
While there are many ways to draw lines through the data, the least squares 
analysis is a mathematical way that reduces the distance between the line 
and each dot in the scatterplot. This analysis can be done by hand or by 
using software such as Minitab, SPSS, SAS, R, or Excel.
Figure A-10 shows the least squares regression line from the scatterplot of 
taps and time (refer to Figure A-1).

The software gives you the equation to the regression line above the graph:

✓	  (pronounced y-hat): This is the predicted value of the dependent vari-
able: predicted time.
	
✓	b0: Called the y-intercept, this is where the line would cross (or inter-
cept) with the y-axis.
	
✓	b1: This is the slope of the predicted line (how steep it is).
	
✓	X: This represents a particular value of the independent variable: taps.
	
✓	e: represents the inevitable error the prediction will contain.
So in this example, the regression equation indicates that the predicted 
amount of time it takes a customer to make a purchase is equal to 86.57 (the 
y-intercept) plus 4.486 (the slope) multiplied by the number of taps (X).
Predicting with the regression line
It’s the regression formula that allows you to predict customer values that 
don’t exist in your data. It allows you to perform “what-if” analyses on 
future customer values. This is the “predictive” part of predictive customer 
analytics.
For example, using the regression equation from the preceding example, you 
can predict how long a customer takes to make a purchase with 38 taps. You 
just fill 38 in the regression equation.
Time = 86.57 + 4.486(38)
Time = 86.57 + 170.47 = 257.04
A customer needs 257 seconds, or a bit longer than four minutes, to make a 
purchase that requires 38 taps.
	
The dependent variable is denoted “Y” and is displayed on the y (vertical) 
axis. The independent variable is called X and is displayed on the horizontal 
(x) axis. (See Chapter 2 for discussion about independent and dependent 
variables.)
Instead of predicting a customer’s task time from taps, this same approach 
can be used to predict other customer analytics, including:
	
✓	Customer revenue from advertising revenue
	
✓	Likelihood to recommend from usability data
	
✓	Number of conversions from website page views

Creating a regression equation in Excel
To create a regression equation using Excel, follow these steps:
	
1.	Insert a scatterplot graph into a blank space or sheet in an Excel file 
with your data.
	
	 You can find the scatterplot graph on the Insert ribbon in Excel 2007 and 
later.
	
2.	Select the x-axis (horizontal) and y-axis data and click OK.
	
	 Put what you want to predict in the y-axis (so my time data is in column 
B). The taps are in column C.
	
	 You now have a scatterplot.
	
3.	Right-click on any of the dots and select “Add Trendline” from the 
menu.
	
	 The Format Trendline dialog box opens, as shown in Figure A-11.

4.	Select Trendline Options on the left, if necessary, then select the 
Display Equation on Chart and Display R-Squared Value on Chart 
boxes.
	
	 You now have a scatterplot with trendline, equation, and r-squared value, 
as shown in Figure A-12. The regression equation is Y = 4.486x + 86.57. 
This is the same regression equation from the earlier “Predicting with the 
regression line” section, except that the y-intercept (86.57) is after the 
slope.
	
	 The r2 value of .3143 tells you that taps can explain around 31% of the 
variation in time. It tells you how well the best-fitting line actually fits 
the data.

Going beyond the ends of observed values is risky when using a regression 
equation. There’s no guarantee that the regression line will continue to be 
linear because it extends before and after the data points.
Watch out for the following three things when correlating customer analytics 
data and using regression analysis:
	
✓	Range restriction: Two variables might have a low correlation because 
you’re only measuring in a narrow range. For example, height and weight 
have a strong positive correlation, but if you measure only National 
Basketball Association (NBA) players, the correlation would mostly 
go away. This can happen, for example, if you are looking at a narrow 
range of customers — say, the ones with the highest incomes or most 
transactions.

✓	Third variables: It’s often the case that another variable you aren’t 
measuring is actually the cause of the relationship. For example, high 
school grades are correlated with college grades. It may seem like better 
studying in high school leads to better grades in college. However, it’s 
often the case that a third variable, Socio Economic Status (SES) is a 
better explanation of both high school and college grades. Students in 
families with higher SES tend to have higher grades in high school and 
college than students from families with low SES. In customer analytics 
an improving economy or a growing company may be the reason for 
increases in sales, and not your marketing campaign or feature changes.
	
✓	Nonlinearity: The relationship between variables needs to be linear — 
that is, follow a line somewhat. If the relationship curves downward or 
upward, a correlation and regression equation will not properly describe 
the relationship.
Multiple regression analysis
When you have one independent variable predicting one dependent vari-
able, it’s called bivariate regression. You can extend the idea of regression to 
include more than one independent variable, which then becomes multiple 
regression. As with the Tap and Time data, taps only predict 31% of the varia-
tion in time. Other variables also predict customer time. Multiple regression 
analysis includes additional variables to see how much, if at all, they contrib-
ute to explaining variations in the dependent variable, beyond the variables 
already included.
In Chapter 12, I discuss the value of a key driver analysis for predicting which 
variables best predict customer loyalty. A key driver analysis typically uses 
multiple regression analysis (another technique is Shapley Value Analysis, 
which uses a different algorithm but provides similar output).
With multiple regression, you build the regression equation with two or more 
variables. You can then see how important each independent variable is, rela-
tive to the others included.
With another independent variable, the regression formula becomes 
:
	
✓	  (pronounced y-hat): Represents the predicted value of the dependent 
variable: predicted time.
	
✓	b0: This is the y-intercept.
	
✓	b1:  The regression coefficient “weight” for variable 1. 
	
✓	b2:  The regression coefficient “weight” for variable 2. 
	
✓	X1: Represents a particular value of independent variable 1

✓	X2: Represents a particular value of independent variable 2
	
✓	e: Represents the inevitable error a prediction will contain
For example, 2,584 customers rated their likelihood to recommend a learning 
management system (LMS) used at a university:
	
✓	They rated their likelihood to recommend on a 0 to 10 scale (0= not at all 
likely to recommend and 10 = extremely likely).
	
✓	These customers rated their satisfaction on several other variables 
using a five-point scale from not at all satisfied (1) to very satisfied (5). 
They rated attributes including 
	
•	Stability of the system (whether it crashed)
	
•	Satisfaction with customer support
	
•	Efficiency (how quickly customers get their tasks done)
	
	See Chapter 9 for ideas on measuring customer attitudes.
	
•	Usability of the product across four 5-point questions for a total of 
20 points.
Here’s how I used a bivariate regression equation to see how much custom-
ers’ satisfaction with the product’s stability predicts their likelihood to rec-
ommend it.
	
1.	 I computed the correlation and found that satisfaction with stability has 
a reasonably strong correlation r = .49.
	
2.	 I performed a regression analysis using the statistical software SPSS.
	
	 You can also use Minitab, SAS, and R, and online calculators, to perform 
a multiple regression analysis.
	
	 In SPSS, I chose Analyze➪Regression➪Linear Regression. In the Linear 
Regression dialog box, I used the satisfaction with the product stability 
(labeled Stability) of the software to predict the likelihood to recom-
mend (labeled NPS), as shown in Figure A-13.
	
	 I got the following table of results shown in Figure A-14. While there are 
a lot of numbers, what you’re interested in is the regression equation in 
the B column. This column contains the B’s in the regression equation 
described earlier (the y-intercept and slope). The estimate of likelihood 
to recommend = 1.950 + 1.423 (Stability). The “Sig” column values show 
that the predictor of Stability Satisfaction is statistically significant (not 
just a chance association) because the values of .000 are less than .05. 
See the sidebar discussion on statistical significance. The r2 value is .24, 
meaning stability explains around 24% of customers’ likelihood to rec-
ommend (this is found from squaring the correlation of .49).

output from 
SPSS.
	
	
	 Next I wanted to see if usability adds any predictive power to customers’ 
likelihood to recommend, beyond what is being explained by their satis-
faction toward the stability.
	
3.	 I ran the correlation between usability and likelihood and got a strong 
correlation of r = .733.
	
	 The correlation between usability and stability is also medium-strong, 
r = .477. It’s often the case that independent variables will correlate with 
each other and the dependent variable. But you don’t want to include 
variables that provide completely redundant information. It could be 
that when customers rate the usability of the software, they are already 
considering its stability. Multiple regression can tell you if the stability 
satisfaction is adding anything that usability isn’t already adding (and 
vice versa).

4.	 I repeated the procedure with the updated table of results.
	
5.	 I added in usability to the regression equation. The results are shown in 
Figure A-15.
	
Figure A-15: 
Multiple 
regression 
output from 
SPSS.
	
Look at the B column to see the regression weights and to build the equation 
for likelihood to recommend:
Likelihood to Recommend = -.937 + .541 (Stability)+ .419 (Usability)
Again, both predictors are statistically significant because the values in the 
“Sig” column are under .05. The r2 for this equation is .561, meaning these two 
variables together predict around 56% of likelihood to recommend.
	
If the correlation between independent variables is too high, an undesirable 
condition called multicollinearity occurs, which can provide a misleading 
regression equation. I get concerned when the correlations exceed r >.9 and I 
use additional tests to be sure multicollinearity isn’t occurring.
This regression equation output reveals a few things.
	
✓	Adding usability as a variable substantially increased the explanatory 
power compared to just stability alone:
	
•	With stability alone, you could predict 24% of likelihood to 
recommend.
	
•	When you add in usability along with stability satisfaction, the 
explanatory power more than doubles to 56%, which is the 
majority of variation.
	
✓	You can predict a customer’s likelihood of recommending the software 
product by inserting values for stability and usability ratings.

	For example, a stability satisfaction rating of 4 (out of 5) and a usability 
score of 15 (out of 20) would result in a likelihood to recommend score of
Likelihood to Recommend = -.937 + .541 (4)+ .419 (15) = 7.5
	
	That would place this customer in the Passive category, not terribly 
likely to recommend, but probably someone who also won’t detract (see 
Chapter 12).
	
✓	The relative importance of each of these two variables in predicting like-
lihood to recommend.
	
	The weights of each value are the coefficients in the regression ­equation 
(.541 for stability and .419 for usability). While this appears to show 
that stability has the higher weight, and therefore importance, this is 
misleading because the items used different scales (a 5-point versus a 
20-point scale).
	
	To better understand the importance, look at the standardized coef-
ficients to find the relative importance. The standardization process 
converts each raw score into a standard score, making the values 
comparable. You see this value in the Standardized Coefficients 
column (refer to Figure A-15). The stability has a standardized weight 
of .188. This means that increasing customers’ satisfaction with the 
stability increases the likelihood to recommend by .188 points. In 
comparison, the standardized weight of usability is .641. That means 
a 1-point increase in the standardized usability score increases the 
likelihood to recommend by .641. In other words, usability is more 
than three times as important as stability in predicting customer loy-
alty (.641 / .188 = 3.4).
Predicting with binary data
The regression examples used in the preceding section both use ­continuous 
dependent and continuous independent variables. You can use also use cat-
egorical predictor variables with two, three, or more specific categories — 
for example, task-completion, agree-disagree, or a customer segment (high 
income, medium income, or low income), as long as they are dummy coded 
with 1’s and 0’s, where the 1 represents the category presence and 0 the 
absence. See Chapter 2 for a reminder on dummy coding. For regression analy-
sis, the dependent variable needs to be a continuous variable. A special form of 
regression analysis called logistic regression can handle categorical data as the 
dependent variable.

 Appendix: Predicting with Customer Analytics
Predicting Trends with 
Time Series Analysis
A natural extension of regression analysis is time series analysis, which uses past 
customer data collected over regular intervals to predict future customer data 
on the same intervals. Time series analysis can be used to predict things like
Statistical significance and p-values
When dealing with customer analytics in gen-
eral, you’ll encounter the phrase statistically 
significant. You’ll also run into something called 
a p-value. There’s a lot packed in that little p and 
there are books written on the subject. Here’s 
what you need to know.
In principle, a statistically significant result 
(usually a difference) is a result that’s not attrib-
uted to chance. More technically, it means that 
if the Null Hypothesis is true (which means 
there really is no difference), there’s a low prob-
ability of getting a result that large or larger.
Consider these two important factors.
	✓	Sampling Error. There’s always a chance 
that the differences we observe when 
measuring a sample of customers is just 
the result of random noise; chance fluctua-
tions; happenstance.
	✓	Probability; never certainty. Statistics is 
about probability; you cannot buy 100% 
certainty. Statistics is about managing risk. 
Can we live with a 10-percent likelihood that 
our decision is wrong? A 5-percent likeli-
hood? 33 percent? The answer depends on 
context: What does it cost to increase the 
probability of making the right choice, and 
what is the consequence (or potential con-
sequence) of making the wrong choice? 
Most publications suggest a cutoff of 5% —
it’s okay to be fooled by randomness 1 time 
out of 20. That’s a reasonably high standard, 
and it may match your circumstances. It 
could just as easily be overkill, or it could 
expose you to far more risk than you can 
afford.
The p-value is one of the outcomes of a sta-
tistical test when making a comparison, say, 
between the conversion rate in a test of one 
marketing campaign compared to another.
The p-value stands for probability value. The 
p-value is the probability of obtaining the differ-
ence you see in a comparison from a sample (or 
a larger one) if there really isn’t a difference for 
all customers.
Some examples of p-values are .012, .21, or .0001; 
a p-value of .012 indicates that the difference 
observed would only be seen about 1.2% of the 
time, if there really is no difference in the entire 
customer population.
Given that this is a pretty low percentage, in 
most cases, researchers conclude that the dif-
ference observed is not due to chance and call it 
statistically significant. By convention, journals 
and statisticians say something is statistically 
significant if the p-value is less than .05. There’s 
nothing sacred about .05, though; in applied 
research, the difference between .04 and .06 is 
usually negligible.
Statistical significance doesn’t mean practical 
significance. Only by considering context can 
you determine whether a difference is practically 
significant (that is, whether it requires action).

For example, requiring customers to register for updates with a website 
is a way to nurture lead generation. With customers providing their email 
addresses, they are also giving permission for an organization to directly 
communicate, market, and (attempt to) convert them into paying customers.
Figure A-16 shows the total number of subscribers from January 2012 through 
February 2014 from a B2B services company website. With this data, you can

To estimate the cumulative number of subscribers in the future, follow these 
steps to use time series analysis in Excel:
	
1.	Create a line graph from the data by month and year in Excel. Insert a 
line graph into an Excel sheet with the data.
	
2.	Add the cumulative column as the series values in the graph in the 
Edit Series dialog box.
	
3.	To create x-axis date labels, select both the month and year columns 
in the Axis Labels dialog box.
	
	 Figure A-17 shows the cumulative number of subscribers by month and 
year.
Figure A-17:

	 You can see that pattern of cumulative subscribers is generally linear 
(forming a line going up). By adding a regression equation, you can pre-
dict the future number of subscribers (assuming subscriber growth con-
tinues to exhibit this linear pattern).
	
4.	Add a regression equation:
	
•	Click on the data line and right-click “Add Trendline.”
	
•	In the Format Trendline dialog box, select the Display Equation on

Figure A-18 shows a linear regression equation. The best fitting line does a 
good job of describing the relationship. This r2 value is .988, meaning this line 
explains 98.8% of the variation in subscriber rates, which is excellent.

Figure A-18:

to the graph.
The only independent variable used here is the sequence of time over 26 
months (from 1 to 26). The regression equation for subscribers for the 26 
months is:
Subscribers = 81.109(x) +1896.8
You can now predict the number of subscribers for a specific month — say, 
May 2014, which would be the 29th data point (3 into the future).
The estimated total number of subscribers for May is:
May Subscribers = 81.109(29) +1896.8 = 4249
	
Any judgment about the future is susceptible to errors. It’s important to under-
stand the limitations of using past data to predict the future.
Exponential (non-linear) growth
One of the benefits of first graphing data is that you can examine the relation-
ship to be sure a line does a good job of fitting it. Customer growth is a key 
metric for social media companies like Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter. Over 
short intervals (weeks and months), growth looks linear, but over longer peri-
ods of time, the growth is exponential. It will often be the case that an expo-
nential (non-linear) equation fits your data better and will provide a better 
prediction.

You can see if an exponential trendline better describes the subscriber 
growth than a linear one:
	
1.	Right-click the data and choose Format Trendline.
	
2.	Choose Exponential in the Format Trendline dialog box.
An updated trendline with an exponential regression equation is shown in 
Figure A-19.

Here is the new regression equation.
Number of Subscribers = 2027.6e0.0273 (x) = 4249
The “e” represents a constant, which is approximately 2.71828, and is raised 
to the power of .0273 and multiplied times the number of months. You can 
see why it’s called an exponential equation, as the month is now part of an 
exponent. The r² value is 0.9988, which is actually higher than the linear equa-
tion (which had an r² value of 0.988), meaning this equation fits better.
The prediction for May, the 29th data point, is:
May Subscribers = 2027.6e0.0273 (29) = 4475
In Excel, use the function =EXP(0.0273*29) × 2027.6 to get 4475.

Customer Analytics For Dummies 
Training and validation periods
A more sophisticated and often essential approach to time series analysis 
involves partitioning your customer data into training and validation periods. 
In the training period, you build a regression equation on the earliest section 
of data (approximately two-thirds to three-fourths of your data). You then 
apply the regression equation to the later part of your data in the validation 
period to see how well the earlier data actually predicts the later data.
With the subscriber data, you could use the first 20 months (January 2012 
through August 2013) as the training period and September 2013 to February 
2014 as the validation period. This approach is testing the equation using 
data you already have, which is as close as you can get to testing how well a 
prediction might perform when new data comes in.
The regression equation for the first 20 months is:
Subscribers = 2033.9e0.0269x
The r² = 0.9979, which shows a good fit for the exponential line. You can then 
use this regression equation to see how well it predicts the final six months 
of the dataset. The last six months are 21 through 26. Figure A-20 shows the 
predicted and actual values for August 2013 through February 2014, labeled 
the Validation (in the Period column).
To assess how well this prediction actually is, I created two additional col-
umns. The first is the raw error from the actual number to the prediction. For 
example, in September 2013, the prediction was short by 5 subscribers. In 
February 2014, it was short by 28. This sort of raw error can itself be under-
standable, if you’re familiar with the customer data you’re working with. 
When communicating how much error your predicted values have, it’s often 
easier to speak in terms of percentage error.
The Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) can be a bit more understand-
able to stakeholders. It’s computed by finding the absolute value of the differ-
ence between the actual and predicted values, then dividing that difference 
by the actual value to compute the absolute percentage error. This is then 
averaged for each value.
The APE column shows the absolute percentage error. For example, for 
January 2013, the regression equation predicted 2,885 subscribers; the actual 
number of subscribers was 2,844, meaning the equation overpredicted by 41 
subscribers.

Applying the Excel formula for the absolute percentage error (APE) generates 
an error of 1.4%:
=ABS(2885-2844)/2885 = .014 or 1.4%
The MAPE for the training period is .589%. The MAPE for the validation 
period is .870%, which is a bit higher, but both are still under 1%.
Finally, the predictions for March, April, and May 2014 are 4,205, 4,320, and 
4,437.
=EXP(0.0269*27)*2033.9= 4205

Customer Analytics For Dummies 
There are a number of more sophisticated techniques that can make more 
accurate models by taking into account seasonality and autocorrelation, and 
then smoothing the data to better interpret patterns. Software such as JMP 
and Minitab have these features built in.
	
Predicting the future is always risky because you’re assuming the future will 
have similar patterns as the past. In most cases it does and can be an excellent 
predictor of customer behavior. However, unusual events (outraged ­customers 
on social media, a terrorist attack, or recession) that are unpredictable can 
­substantially affect the accuracy of your predictions. Treat predictions as a 
guide, not an absolute.
Detecting Differences
Determining if differences are statistically significant is another valuable tool 
for predicting with customer analytics. In fact, I cover three different applica-
tions in other parts of this book: A/B tests (see Chapter 10), usability tests 
(see Chapter 14), and findability tests (see Chapter 15). All three of these 
tests use sample customer data to make inferences about a larger customer 
population.
The particular statistical test you use depends on the type of data you have. 
Because binary data is so common in customer analytics, I cover comparing 
two proportions (recall that a percentage is just a proportion times 100) in 
this section.
Common questions include
	
✓	Do higher-income customers purchase at a higher rate than lower-
income customers?
	
✓	Is there a difference in buying habits between men and women?
	
✓	Does one online advertisement result in more click-through than 
another?
	
✓	Will a green button lead to more purchases than a blue button?
To determine if there are statistical differences between proportions, you 
use a similar contingency table just as you do when computing correlations 
between binary variables.
	
A key difference here is that you’re working with between-subjects data:

 Appendix: Predicting with Customer Analytics
	
✓	Of the customers who considered Book B, what proportion of customers 
ultimately purchased Book B?
	
✓	Is the difference in proportions from a sample of customers greater than 
what you’d expect from chance alone?
	
Even if you don’t sample your customer data, but instead compute analytics 
on all transactions in a given period (for example, on a website for a month), 
you’re interested in what will happen in the future. So you are using the cur-
rent customer data as a sample of all future customer data. For that reason, 
you need to take into account chance variation, which is what computing sta-
tistical significance is all about.
Say you want to know if more customers are likely to click on an advertise-
ment using one marketing message (Ad A) or are more likely to click through 
using an alternate message (Ad B). Imagine 435 customers were randomly 
served either Advertisement A or Advertisement B on a web page during a 
week. If 18 out of 220 clicked through on Ad A (8%) and 6 out of 215 clicked 
through on Ad B (3%), is there enough evidence that more future customers 
will click on Ad A over Ad B? There is a 5 percentage point difference in click-
through rates, but is this difference just random variation or does it repre-
sent a real difference in the effectiveness of ads?
The type of statistical test used for detecting statistical differences between 
binary variables is a Chi-Square test. It is represented with the Greek symbol 
X2 (Chi). Follow these steps to conduct a Chi-Square test.:
	
1.	Set up the data, like this:
Purchased
Didn’t Purchase
Totals
Ad A
a
b
m
Ad B
c
d
n
Total
r
s
N
	
2.	Apply the X2 formula (which works for small and large sample sizes):
	
	
	
	 Here are the values filled in.
Purchased
Didn’t Purchase
Totals
Ad A
18
202
220
Ad B
6
209
215
Total

3.	Fill in the values in the formula to get the Chi-Square statistic.
	
	
	
4.	Apply the Excel formula and obtain a p-value. 
	
	 In this case, you use the Chi-Square statistic of 6.05:
=CHIDIST(6.05, 1) = .014
A p-value this low indicates that a difference of 5 percentage points or greater 
would only happen about 1.4 times in 100, if there really was no difference. A 
difference this large is probably not just random noise (see the earlier side-
bar on statistical significance and p-values). So Advertisement A would likely 
get more customers to click through and would be a more effective ad to 
implement going forward.
