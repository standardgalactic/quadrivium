Introduction
This introduction explains what asset accounting is, discusses the integration of asset accounting into other 
SAP modules, explains who should use this book, and includes a quick overview of the book’s content. 
Asset Accounting (FI-AA)
Asset accounting is a subsidiary ledger to the general ledger in SAP R/3 and it provides an enterprise-
detailed way to relate to all the transactions that took place in the system related to fixed assets. Asset 
accounting serves as a component in SAP R/3 for managing and monitoring fixed assets. The SAP system 
comes with various fixed asset country-specific standard settings, which cut across industries. The country-
specific features make the asset accounting component adaptable and easy to customize. To minimize the 
spookiness that can be involved in customizing, SAP provides standard country-specific settings for most 
countries where necessary. 
Integration of Asset Accounting to Other SAP Modules
Due to the robust nature of integration modules in SAP R/3, transactions posted in other modules can be 
transferred to asset accounting (FI-AA). For example, assets purchased or produced in-house can be posted 
directly from MM (Material Management) to FI-AA, and depreciation and APC (acquisition and production 
cost) values can be posted from FI (Financial Accounting) to FI-AA.
Easy Access
The Easy Access menu is a user-specific point of entry into the SAP system. It is the first screen that comes 
up when you log on to SAP. It is designed as a tree structure containing a list of several key items, which 
allow you to navigate the system and perform tasks and business processes. For example, you can perform 
transactions, generate reports, and access web addresses (where you can access documents from a remote 
Internet server).

■ Introduction
IMG
The implementation guide (IMG) is a generic tool you can use to customize asset accounting requirements 
to meet specific needs of a company. SAP contains three implementation variants:
•
SAP Reference IMG. A standard structured hierarchical tool in the R/3 system (real-
time three-tier architecture) that contains the procedure for customizing various 
country settings and application modules.
•
Project IMG. The configuration process can be very daunting. To help manage the 
complexity involved in customizing when using the reference IMG, you can create 
each implementation project based on specific functions needed for business 
processes and the project requirements. For example, you can reduce the project 
scope to specific objects such as countries.
•
Project View IMG. You choose certain properties by specific criteria in order to 
generate views to organize your project activities. For example, a project view could 
hold each activity required in a project IMG. 
Matchcodes
Matchcodes are user-friendly search functions designed specifically to help you look up or retrieve data 
records stored in the system. They provide an efficient way of looking for records stored in the system when 
you do not remember the key.  
Real-Time Three-Tier Architecture (R/3)
SAP supports a real-time three-tier architecture made up of these three layers:
•
Presentation Layer: This is the first layer in a typical three-tier architecture and it 
serves as the input device that is used to control a SAP system. It is a user-friendly 
Graphical User Interface (GUI) used by the end users to input data into the system. 
It also serves as a data output device. The presentation layer communicates with the 
application layer.
•
Application Layer: This is the middleman in the SAP system, where all the 
processing takes place. The application layer could be referred to as the central 
processing unit (CPU). It collects data from the database, processes it, and passes it 
to the presentation layer.
•
Database Layer: It allows data to be stored, called up, and modified.
The real-time three-tier architecture allows separate business processes to function under a single, 
integrated business management information system.
Who Should Read this Book
This book is specifically written for SAP FI, MM, and SD functional consultants, application consultants, 
business analysts, accountants, SAP support teams, and project management teams in charge of asset 
accounting.

■ Introduction
A Quick Overview of the Book’s Contents
Each chapter follows a step-by-step sequence to customize asset accounting (FI-AA) in SAP from start to 
finish. The sequence has been arranged in a systematic manner to give you the opportunity to gain adequate 
hands-on experience in configuring SAP FI-AA. Each chapter includes all the configuration concepts or 
activities necessary for customizing, or draws on a previous chapter. 
Chapter 1 sets the scene by explaining what the organizational structure is. It defines charts of 
depreciation with emphasis on the legal requirements for calculating depreciation and asset valuation 
management for country-specific disclosure requirements. It also explores asset classes and screen layout 
rules.
Chapter 2 explains and defines the system settings required for integrating asset accounting. It also 
provides specifications for layout control parameters for G/L accounts, how to set input tax indicators for 
transactions that are not subject to taxes, how to specify financial statement versions for asset accounting, 
and how to specify document types for periodic posting of asset balance sheet values.
Chapter 3 explores the chart of depreciation in-depth and explains the importance of the chart of 
depreciation in asset accounting. Other aspects that this chapter explores include parallel valuations, low 
value assets, and fiscal year variants.
Chapter 4 explains and defines system settings for ordinary depreciation, unplanned depreciation, and 
various valuation methods. It also defines the cutoff value key and the maximum base value.
Chapter 5 explores the purpose of special valuation in asset accounting. It explains and defines reserves 
for special depreciation by specifying gross or net procedures for special depreciation. This chapter also 
examines how to determine the general ledger accounts for the write-off or allocation of special reserves, 
and explains how to define investment support measures, the revaluation of fixed assets, and index 
replacement values in special valuation of fixed assets. 
Chapter 6 looks at asset master data, the purpose of screen layouts, how to define screen layouts for 
asset master data, how to define screen layouts for asset depreciation areas, how to define asset master 
records, including group assets and subnumbers, and how to display asset master records.
Chapter 7 looks at accounting treatment of asset retirement and explains how to post transactions in 
asset accounting for asset acquisitions. It defines transaction types for acquisitions, asset retirements, and 
asset transfers, the determination of gain/loss posting variants, and the specification of posting variants 
for retirement transfers. It also explains how to define the account assignment category for asset purchase 
orders and intercompany asset transfers. It covers how to define cross-system depreciation areas and the 
capitalization of assets under construction. You learn how to allow transfer types for asset classes and how to 
post asset transactions with external acquisition, credit memos, and in-house production.
Chapter 8 looks at validation and substitution in asset accounting, and the customizing steps involved.
Chapter 9 looks at system settings for report selection in the asset accounting information system and 
introduces how to generate various asset reports. 
Chapter 10 looks at the appropriate asset data transfer by performing the following settings in the 
system: setting the company code status, specifying the sequence of depreciation areas, specifying 
parameters for data transfer, and defining transaction types for transferring open items. 
Chapter 11 explores the preparation for production start-up in asset accounting and looks at other 
configuration steps involved in production settings.
Chapter 12 looks at processing periodic programs in asset accounting, which includes depreciation 
runs, display logs, and year month/year end closings.
Appendix A covers most of the appropriate G/L accounts needed for your configuration.
Appendix B provides some useful transaction codes that allow you to access tasks easily rather than 
going through the menu path, which may be time-consuming.

Chapter 1
Customizing Organizational 
Structures in SAP Asset 
Accounting (FI-AA)
This chapter introduces you to the basic aspects of Asset Accounting (FI-AA) and explains how they are 
configured in SAP ERP. You will learn how to:
•
Create settings for country-specific disclosure requirements
•
Copy reference chart of depreciation/depreciation area
•
Copy reference chart of depreciation
•
Assign chart of deprecation to company code
•
Specify number assignment across company codes
•
Define asset classes
Organizational Structures
Organizational structures are the minimum basic settings in Asset Accounting (FI-AA) needed to meet 
various business functions. They also determine how assets accounts are managed. They depict how 
business processes are broken into manageable units that allow the classifications and assignments of FI-AA 
components to other organizational units at a given point in time in the SAP system (e.g., cost centers, plants, 
etc.). The classification of assets plays a significant role, because it allows you to organize assets accounting 
based on defined accounting criteria (e.g., according to asset classes, depreciation methods, etc.).
Asset Accounting (FI-AA) is a component in SAP R/3 that serves as a subsidiary ledger to the Financial 
Accounting (FI) general ledger containing information that relates to fixed asset transactions posted in the 
system.
Specifying the Setting for Country-Specific Disclosure Requirements
Asset accounting disclosure requirements vary from country to country based on the accounting standards 
prevalent in a particular country. For example, the amount allowed for Low Value Assets (LVA) differs from 
country to country.

SAP comes with settings for most countries. Hence, you don’t need to do anything here, but it’s smart to 
check the existing settings to make sure that they meet your requirements.
You check your country-specific settings from the Change View “Asset Accounting: Country 
information”: Overview screen (see Figure 1-1). To access this screen, use the menu path: IMG ➤ Financial 
Accounting (New) ➤ Asset Accounting ➤ Organizational Structures ➤ Check Country-Specific Settings. The 
screen shown in Figure 1-1 appears.

Defining Chart of Depreciation and Depreciation Areas
It is important to note that in SAP R/3 system all GL accounts are defined in the chart of accounts and 
Asset Accounting works with the chart of accounts assigned to the company code in FI. A chart of accounts 
dictates the structure of general ledger accounts and contains the list of G/L accounts used by a company 
code(s) for business processes and for posting daily financial transactions from which financial statements 
and balance sheet are drawn at any given time. A detailed discussion of the charts of accounts is outside 
the scope of this book. However, the chart of accounts is covered in the book entitled SAP ERP Financial 
Accounting and Controlling: Configuration and Use Management (Apress 2015), which can serve as a very 
good reference.
Chart of Depreciation
A chart of depreciation is a list of country-specific depreciation areas supplied by SAP to meet legal and 
business disclosure requirements for your company code. Depreciation areas are predefined settings for 
calculating different values in parallel for individual fixed assets to meet certain disclosure requirements.
SAP comes with a predefined sample chart of depreciation for most countries that you can use. The 
system also allows you to create your own chart of depreciation by copying existing chart of depreciation in 
the system and modifying them to meet your requirement. This will be discussed in detail in the “Copying 
Reference Chart of Depreciation/Depreciation Areas” section later in this chapter. The chart of deprecation 
is country specific. It means that chart of depreciation varies from country to country. Hence it is important 
to use the chart of depreciation that is applicable to your country. Like chart of accounts, each company 
code is only entitled to use one chart of deprecation. Just as it is possible for several company codes to 
use the same chart of accounts, more than one company code can use the same chart of depreciation 
simultaneously.
Depreciation Area
The depreciation area is defined in the chart of depreciation with two numeric digits. SAP ERP comes with 
predefined depreciation areas, which specifically meet each country’s accounting treatment and disclosure 
requirements. It is also possible for you to define your own depreciation area. Whether you want to use the 
chart of depreciation supplied by SAP or define your own chart of depreciation is a matter of choice. Once 
the depreciation key is defined and assigned to the asset master record, it is then possible to post values and 
depreciation to the assigned accounts.
The chart of depreciation contains different depreciation areas with depreciation keys such as 01- Book 
depreciation, 15-Tax Balance sheet, 20-Cost-accounting depreciation, 41-Investment support deducted 
from asset, etc. Depreciation key 01 is usually the leading depreciation area in SAP ERP. SAP ERP has the 
flexibility that allows you to display different depreciation areas with the same value and depreciation terms 
in different currencies. The system also allows different assets valuation to be carried out to meet different 
needs. For example, to produce financial statements to meet local requirements, for internal management 
reporting, financial statements according to IAS, US GAAP, etc.
Copying Reference Chart of Depreciation/Depreciation Areas
This is where you actually commence the customizing of your chart of depreciation. The chart of 
depreciation is nothing other than a list of depreciation areas that hold the appropriate parameters that 
enable you to conform to certain countries legal requirements on asset valuation. You can only define chart 
of depreciation by copying the country-specific reference charts of depreciation provided by SAP. When you 
copy the required predefined chart of deprecation for your company code country, the system copies all 
the depreciation areas in the reference chart of deprecation. Go through the depreciation area carefully and 
delete the unwanted depreciation areas.

Specifying the Use of Parallel Currencies
Values posted in asset accounting can be updated in various currencies, and at the same time, a parallel FI 
document can be posted in the FI as a local currency (company code currency) amount. The bottom line 
is for the system to supply the corresponding posting documents with additional values from the defined 
depreciation areas. In order for the system to perform this task, you must make sure that:
•
Currency type and the currency in the depreciation area are the same, with the 
corresponding parallel currency defined in your company code.
•
The depreciation terms and acquisition values managed in the depreciation area are 
identical.
Complete the following steps:	
1.	
To go to the screen where you specify the use of parallel currencies for your 
assets valuation in the depreciation area, follow this menu path: IMG: Financial 
Accounting (New) ➤ Asset Accounting ➤ Valuation ➤ Currencies ➤ Specify 
the Use of Parallel Currencies. The Change View “Set Up Parallel Currencies”: 
Overview screen appears (Figure 1-7). Update these currency types: using 
Currency Type 30-Group Currency and 40-Hard Currency.

■Note   You may not be able to assign the chart of depreciation you have defined to your company code
unless key important settings are already defined in Financial Accounting for your company code (7200) such
as currency, chart of accounts, fiscal year variant, and input tax indicator for non-taxable transactions. So you
have to first complete these entries. (We cover these entries in SAP ERP Financial Accounting and Controlling:
Configuration and Use Management). Otherwise, if you try to save your settings, an information screen comes
up with the message “Company code entries for 7200 (your company code) are incomplete – See long test”.
Asset Classes
Assets are structured systematically into groups often referred to as asset classes. For example, assets 
with similar characteristics are classified in the same asset class such as machinery, furniture and fittings, 
motor vehicles, land and buildings, etc. You can define several asset classes in the system. Like charts of 
depreciation, asset classes are created at the client level. This makes asset classes available to all company 
codes. Each asset class usually has master data and depreciation area sections. Master data is data about the 
asset class held in the system database that remains relatively unchanged over a period of time. It contains 
information that needs to be used over and over, over a period of time, the same way.
In asset class customizing, we will be looking at the following control parameters:
•
Account determination
•
Screen layout rules
•
Number ranges
Specifying Account Determination
Account determination for asset accounting is defined in the asset class and it serves as the primary 
connection between asset accounting and the G/L accounts in FI. Posting all related assets values in 
the system to the general ledger is determined by the company code chart of accounts, the depreciation 
area, and the account determination key. Based on the specification of account determination in your 
customizing, the system will automatically calculate all the changes in the asset values arising from 
depreciation, asset revaluation, and other form of reduction in value and update the asset values. Depending 
on your configuration, the system will perform online updates for the master data depreciation area, while 
all other depreciation areas are posted directly or during periodic processing.
When defining account determination for your asset classes, you should take the number of G/L 
accounts on your asset balance sheet into consideration. In other words, you should make sure that the 
account determination you are creating in this activity is the same number of G/L accounts defined for your 
assets. Interestingly, you may not need to create account determinations in practice, because the standard 
account determinations supplied by SAP will be sufficient. However, we have decided to define our own 
account determination in this activity in order to take you through the steps involved just in case you need to 
create an account determination.

■Note   There is no hard rule on how to define account determination. It is possible to define your account
determination using numbers (i.e., 1000, 2000, etc.) or you can use alphabetic or alphanumeric characters. It
is purely a matter of choice or based on your company’s requirements. You will also notice that the company
code is added to the name of the account determinations in Figure 1-9. This allows you to identify your account
determination with ease, especially in an environment where you have other people using the same platform
with you.

determinations.■
■Note   The system will not allow you to use account determination numbers that are already used by the
system. So if you are creating a new account determination, use a new identification number as your account
determination key.
Creating Screen Layout Rules
The screen layout controls the field status in the asset master record. For example, the screen layout 
determines whether a field is required, optional or suppressed.
In this activity, you will create the appropriate keys for your screen layout rules and descriptions. 
Normally, the field group rules for screen layouts are defined in the asset master data. You create the  
screen layout rules by copying the standard screen layout rules supplied by SAP and adjust them to meet 
your requirements. It is possible to use the predefined screen layout instead of creating your own screen 
layout rules.	
1.	
You can create screen layout rules using the menu path: IMG: Financial 
Accounting (New) ➤ Asset Accounting ➤ Organizational Structures ➤ Asset 
Classes ➤ Create Screen Layout Rules. The Change View “Asset Accounting: 
Screen Layout for Master Record”: Overview screen is displayed, as shown in 
Figure 1-10. Although you will be creating your own screen layout rules for asset 
accounting in this activity, we recommend that you stick to the standard screen 
layout rules supplied by SAP.

Defining the Number Range Interval
It is important to classify asset portfolio on the basis of structured number ranges for better asset 
management. It is customary to define number ranges for asset classes for your company code, which is 
used for assigning main asset number to your asset. Each asset class is assigned a number range from which 
the system automatically can draw when you post an asset in the system. Number range interval assignment 
may not necessarily be assigned internally; it is also possible to assign number ranges externally. Internal 
number range assignment is done by the system automatically in a sequential manner. External number 
range assignment is done by the users when they enter an asset document into the system.
However, it is recommended that you use internal number range assignment for your asset classes to 
keep the complexities of asset management to a minimum.
When customizing number range intervals, we recommend that you copy the standard number range 
interval supplied by SAP. Although it is possible to create your number range intervals afresh, but it is a lot 
easier to copy existing number range intervals and adjust them to meet your requirements. Better still, you 
can use existing number range intervals already created in the system.
In this step, you will be copying the number range intervals from company code 1000. Company code 
1000 is a standard company code supplied by SAP. Using company code 1000 as the template in the creation 
of the number range is ideal.	
1.	
To define number range intervals for your company code, use the menu path: 
IMG: Financial Accounting (New) ➤ Asset Accounting ➤ Organizational 
Structures ➤ Asset Classes ➤ Define Number Range Interval. The Range 
Maintenance: Asset Number screen is displayed, as shown in Figure 1-12.
Figure 1-12.  The initial screen where number range intervals are created or copied	
2.	
Since you are copying number range intervals in this activity, enter the company 
code 1000 in the Company code field and click the Copy 
 button at the top-left 
side of the screen. The Copy Company Code dialog screen pops up. Update the 
following fields:
•
From: The Company code 1000 you are copying is the system default. You can 
overwrite it if you chose to.
•
To: Enter the target company code 7200 in this field. This is the company code 
you are transporting the company code 1000 number range intervals to.

Click the Copy 
 button at the bottom of the Copy Company Code screen to 
copy the number range intervals for company code 1000 to your company code 
7200. The Transport Number Range Intervals screen is displayed with a message, 
as shown in Figure 1-13.	
4.	
 Click the Continue 
 button at the bottom-right side of the screen. The system 
will notify you at the bottom of the Range Maintenance: Asset Number screen 
that “the company code 1000 was copied to 7200”.
Defining the Asset Classes
Assets are structured into classes in Asset Accounting (FI-AA) for efficient asset portfolio management and 
for asset reporting purposes. You assign assets to the appropriate asset class. Therefore, asset classes are a 
vital aspect of asset accounting.
Asset classes are an important aspect of Asset Accounting in FI-AA. It allows assets to be structured 
in a systematic manner by assigning assets to the appropriate asset classes. The benefit of asset classes is 
that they allow efficient management of your asset portfolio and asset reporting purposes. You can assign 
multiple assets to an asset class, as depicted in Figure 1-14. On the other hand, it is not possible to assign an 
asset to more than one asset class.
Figure 1-13.  The system message explaining the transport number range intervals you have copied

The importance of asset classes:
•
Correct assignment of assets and related business transactions to appropriate GL 
accounts.
•
Clearer asset distinctions are made at the asset class levels rather than in GL 
accounts.
•
It allows default values to be assigned when creating assets.
•
It allows adequate asset grouping for reporting purposes.
In this activity, you will define the following asset classes:
•
Land—Freehold
•
Building—Factory
•
Plant & Machinery
•
Office Equipment
•
Fixtures & Fittings
•
Vehicle—Carriage
•
Low Value Assets
•
Assets under Construction

Update the following fields:
•
Asset Class: Enter your proposed asset class key for the object you are defining 
the asset class for (AS1000 Lan—Freehold) in this field. Make sure you use a 
meaningful asset class as your asset key. For example, AS1000, AS2000, 
AS3000, etc.
•
Short Text: Enter a short description that best describes the asset class you are 
defining. For example, Land-Freehold, Building-Factory, Plant & Machinery, etc.
•
Account Determ: Enter the appropriate account determination for your asset 
class object from the list of account determinations you defined earlier in the 
Account Determinations section. For example, in this activity the account 
determination for Land-Freehold is AD1000, Building-Factory is AD2000, and so 
on. You can access the account determinations list using the matchcode by the 
account determination field. Matchcode is the search function provided by SAP 
and it allows you to search or lookup items codes in the system.
•
Scr.layout Rule: Enter the appropriate screen layout for your asset class object 
defined in the Screen Layout Rule section. You can access this list using the 
matchcode. Examples of screen layout you defined in this activity are: Land-
Freehold – S100, Building-Factory S200, Plant & Machinery – S300, etc.
•
Number Range: Enter a number range key from the list of the number range 
intervals you defined in the Number Range section. The number range key you 
entered in this field will allow the system to assign numbers internally to assets 
entered in the asset class. For example, for Land-Freehold, you use number 
range key 01, for building-factory, you use number range key 02, and so on. 
What happens is that when you post an asset in the the asset class for Land-
Freehold, for instance, the system automatically assigns a number to the posted 
asset within the number range assigned to the number range key (01).
•
Status of AuC: In this section of the screen, you have three options you can 
choose from. For example No AuC or summary management of AuC, Line item 
settlement and Investment measure. For assets that did not fall into the category 
of assets under construction, select No AuC or summary management. If you 
want to carry out a line item settlement for assets under construction, select 
the Line Item Settlement option. Finally, select Investment Measure from the 
options represented by SAP if you want to plan and monitor investments that are 
not directly capitalized due their scope or size of in-house production.
•
Real Estate Indicator for Asset Class: You have two options to choose from 
in this section. For assets that are not real estate, specify “Other Asset Without 
Real Estate Management” and for assets that are real estate, specify “Real Estate 
Property or Building”.	
4.	
Click the Enter 
 button at the top-left side of the screen and save 
 your asset 
class.

Summary
In this chapter, you looked at how to customize organizational structure in asset accounting. You 
checked country-specific settings provided by SAP in the system to see if it meets your country disclosure 
requirements. You learned what the chart of accounts and chart of depreciation are. You learned how to 
copy the reference chart of depreciation and depreciation areas. You customized this activity to take you 
through the steps involved in parallel currencies specifications and assign chart of depreciations to your 
company code.
Finally, you looked at the various customizing steps in asset classes. In this step, you defined account 
determinations, created screen layout rules, and defined number range intervals for your asset classes.
In the next chapter, you will be looking at how to integrate asset accounting with G/L account in FI, 
specify posting keys for asset posting, define field status variants for asset accounting, assign input tax 
indicator for non-taxable acquisitions, specify financial statement version for asset reports, and then specify 
document types for posting depreciation and posting rules.

Chapter 2
Integrating Asset Accounting with 
the General Ledger (FI-GL)
This chapter looks at the steps involved in the integration of asset accounting with the general ledger and 
also explains the various steps involved in the integration of asset accounting with the general ledger. You 
will learn how to:
•
Define how depreciation areas post to the general ledger
•
Assign G/L accounts
•
Specify posting key for asset posting
•
Change the field status variant of the asset G/L accounts
•
Assign the input tax indicator for non-taxable acquisitions
•
Specify financial statement versions for asset reports
•
Post depreciations to the general ledger
•
Specify document type for periodic posting of asset balance sheet values
Defining How Depreciation Areas Post to the 
General Ledger in FI
Technically, the setting you carry out in this step will allow you to determine how depreciation areas are 
posted in the general ledger. A list of standard options regarding depreciation areas are posted in general 
ledger are supplied by SAP in Post to G/L accounts. For example:
0- Area does not post
1- Area posts in real time
2- Area posts APC and depreciation on specific basis
3- Area posts depreciation only
4- Area posts APC directly and depreciation
5- Area posts APC only
6- Area posts only APC directly

Chapter 2 ■ Integrating Asset Accounting with the General Ledger (FI-GL)
26
Again, APC in asset accounting is acquisition and production cost. This applies when an asset is 
purchased from an outside vendor (externally) or produced in-house (internally). The definition of how 
depreciation areas post to G/L accounts will determine whether APC transactions and/ or depreciation 
areas in asset accounting should be directly transferred to FI.
In this activity, you will specify the APC transactions and/or deprecation areas you defined in Chapter 1 
in “Copying Reference Chart of Deprecation/Depreciation Areas” section.

■Note   The system normally comes with predefined G/L posting specifications. You can either use the
predefined specifications or specify your own. Before proceeding to the next step in this activity, assigning G/L
accounts, it is advisable that you create the required GL accounts that will be needed for account assignment
first. We have provided a list of G/L accounts that you can use in Appendix A. For a recap on how to create
G/L accounts, refer to our book titled SAP ERP Financial Accounting and Controlling: Configuration and Use
Management.
Assigning G/L Accounts
The assignment of G/L accounts is simply integrating general ledger accounts to asset accounting. The 
customizing you carry out in this step will allow asset accounting transactions to post automatically to the 
general ledger accounts based on your specifications. As part of your configuration you can specify the 
balance sheet accounts, the depreciation accounts, and the special reverse accounts that you want asset 
accounting transactions to be posted in FI.

Specifying the Posting Key for Asset Posting
Posting key is defined using two characters. In order for the system to be able to carry out automatic posting 
when posting fixed asset accounts, the specification of posting key for asset posting must be in place. SAP 
comes with standard posting keys in the system. For example:
•
G/L account posting from asset posting: Debit 40 and Credit 50
•
Asset posting: Debit 70 and Credit 75
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 2 ■ Integrating Asset Accounting with the General Ledger (FI-GL)
34
We recommend that you use the standard posting key specifications supplied by SAP because they 
are sufficient. Secondly, creating your own posting keys may be a daunting exercise and time consuming 
because you will need to change the settings in the associated tables. However, it is important to check the 
standard default values to make sure they meet your requirements.	
1.	
To check the standard posting keys for asset posting, use this menu path: IMG: 
Financial Accounting (New) ➤ Asset Accounting ➤ Integration with the General 
Ledger ➤ Specify Posting Key for Asset Posting. The Configuration Accounting 
Maintain: Automatic Posts-Procedure screen is displayed in Figure 2-6, 
containing a list of procedures (e.g., Additional Accounts for Asset Accounting, 
Asset Posting, and G/L Account Posting from Asset Posting).

appropriate posting keys for asset posting.■
■Note   The additional accounts for Asset Accounting that are displayed on the procedure list can only be
used with the intercompany asset transfer function.
Changing the Field Status Variant of the Asset G/L Accounts
Field status variants are variants that hold the field status groups in SAP R/3. A field status group defines the 
screen layout for a general ledger account entry and controls document creation within a company code. 
Based on your specification, the field status groups determine which fields accept input during document 
entry, as well as whether a field should be inactive, be required, or be optional.
In SAP R/3, field statuses are defined as part of global settings, assigned field status groups and are 
independent of company codes (that is, they are available to all company codes in the client). Normally, field 
status variants are created when defining company code and it may not be necessary to define field status 
variant again in asset accounting if you have already defined field status variant in FI. However, SAP comes 
with standard field statuses with associated field status groups you can adapt and assigned to your company 
code. The field status group controls the appearance of certain data entry fields in the data screen for G/L 
accounts. When customizing the field status variant, it is important that you make sure that the group field 
indicators for asset and asset retirement are set as required entries for input.

■Note   It best to simply copy the standard field status variants supplied by SAP and modify them the copied
field status variants to meet your requirements. By copying another field status variant, you are also copying its
account group as well.
As part of the customizing activity in this step, you will be taught how to define field status variants, field 
status groups, and assign your company code to field status variant.
Defining Field Status Variants
As part of field status variants customizing, you can define field status variants and assign your company 
code to the field status variant you have defined.

37
The next step in this activity is to define your field status variant. You will define 
your field status variant by copying the standard field status variant supplied by 
SAP and modify them to meet your requirements. When you copy the standard 
field status variant, you are also copying the associated field status variant  
groups with it.	
2.	
Select the field status 1000 (IDES Group) from the list of displayed status group 
on the screen and click the Copy 
 button at the top left of the screen. The 
Change View “Field status variants”: Overview of Selected Set screen appears, 
displaying the field status variant key and name of 1000(IDES Group) you copied. 
Change the field status key 1000 to your own field status key (7200) and change 
the field status name IDES Group to your field status name (Field status for 
7200). We recommend that you use your company code as your field status key. 
This is important as it helps you to identify your field status variant with ease, 
especially in an environment where you have several field status variants in 
the system.	
3.	
Click the Enter 
 button at the top left of the screen to confirm your changes. 
The Specify object to be copied screen pops up stating that “Entry 1 of the entries 
to be copied has dependent entries. You can copy the entry with all dependent 
entries, or just the entries”.

■Note   As mentioned earlier, the field status variant holds the field status groups and the field status group
holds the field attributes. The field status groups controls the input fields in the data screen for G/L accounts.
For example, whether fields are required, optional, or suppressed. Unlike the field status variant assigned to
company code, the field status group is assigned to a G/L account.
In this activity, you will not be defining your own field status group, because when you copied the standard field 
status variant in the “Define Field Status Variant” section above, you also copied all the dependent attributes 
(field status groups) with it. However, it is important to check the field status variant groups you copied.

Summary
The chapter looked the steps involved in the integration of asset accounting with general ledger in FI. You 
learned how depreciation areas are posted to general ledger in FI and went on to look at how to assign G/L 
accounts to the depreciation areas in the balance sheet accounts and depreciation. You then went on to look 
at how to specify posting keys for asset posting and G/L account posting from asset posting. You also learned 
how to define field status variant of the asset G/L accounts, define field status groups, and assign field status 
group to your company code. Afterward, you looked at how to assign input tax indicator for non-taxable 
acquisitions. You then looked at how to specify financial statement versions for asset reporting and, finally, 
you assigned financial statement versions to your depreciation areas and assigns document types to the 
company codes for periodic posting of asset balance sheet values.
In the next chapter, you will be looking at the valuation of fixed assets. You will look at how to set chart 
of depreciation, specify transfer of APC (acquisition and purchase costs), specify transfer of depreciation 
terms, set up areas for parallel valuation, specify maximum amount for low-value assets, specify other 
versions at the company code level, define depreciation area for foreign currencies, and define group assets.

Chapter 3
Valuation of Fixed Assets
This chapter looks at the steps involved in the configuration of the valuation of fixed assets in asset 
accounting and also explains the various steps involved in defining depreciation for foreign currencies in 
asset accounting. In this chapter, you will learn how to:
•
Define depreciation areas in asset accounting
•
Determine depreciation areas in the asset class
•
Set up areas for parallel valuation
•
Specify maximum amount for low-value asset
•
Specify rounding of net book value and/or depreciation
•
Specify other versions on company code level
•
Specify other versions on depreciation area level
•
Define depreciation areas for foreign currencies
•
Specify the use of parallel currencies
Setting the Chart of Depreciation
The treatment and disclosure requirements of depreciation and valuation of assets varies from country to 
country. SAP comes with various charts of depreciation in an attempt to meet individual country-specific 
legal disclosure requirements. Therefore, charts of depreciation are always country-specific. Often, charts 
of depreciation are independent of other company codes outside the same country. All company codes 
in the same country are assigned the same chart of depreciation, since they fall under the same legal 
disclosure requirements and therefore need the same chart of depreciation. For example, if Company Code 
1 and Company Code 2 are UK companies, they should be assigned to the same chart of depreciation for 
the UK. Likewise, all company codes operating in the United States can use the same chart of depreciation 
specifically for the United States, and so on.
Benefits of chart of depreciation include:
•
The ability to define and manage assets’ valuation and depreciation parameters in 
the same chart of depreciation.
•
Asset valuation can be performed using parallel approaches to meet different 
purposes via depreciation areas such as balance sheet or cost accounting or tax 
purposes.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 3 ■ Valuation of Fixed Assets
48
•
Fiscal year adjustments can be performed to reflect certain depreciation 
calculations.
•
Methods of valuation can be held in depreciation keys. SAP comes with most of the 
keys (you can change or add to these keys).
It is important to set the chart of depreciation in an environment where you have more than one chart 
of depreciation in the system. In order to indicate the chart of depreciation you want to customize, it is 
important to set appropriate chart of depreciation. The configuration you then carry out will be specific to 
the chart of depreciation you set. Based on the settings, the system can determine the chart of depreciation 
you are working on. For example, if you have only one chart of depreciation, the system will automatically 
use it. On the contrary, if more than one chart exists, the system will prompt you to specify which chart of 
depreciation you are using. The chart of depreciation you specify will remain active in the system until you 
specify another depreciation area.
To set chart of depreciation, use this menu path: IMG: Financial Accounting (New) ➤ Asset  
Accounting ➤ Valuation ➤ Set Chart of Depreciation. The Chart of Depreciation Selection screen is 
displayed in Figure 3-1.
Figure 3-1.  Chart of depreciation selection screen
Enter your chart of depreciation (B10) in the ChDep field (this is the chart of depreciation key you 
defined in Chapter 1 in the Copy Reference Chart of Depreciation/Depreciation Areas section). Then click the 
Enter button at the bottom-left side of the screen. This will take you back to the Display IMG screen. In the 
status bar at the bottom of the screen, the system will notify you that the chart of depreciation B10 was set.
Depreciation Areas
Depreciation was explained in depth in Chapter 1. In this step you will define depreciation areas for 
your asset accounting. During this customizing activity, you will also specify area type, specify transfer of 
APC values, specify transfer of depreciation terms, and set up areas for parallel valuation for your asset 
accounting according to IAS/IFRS standard.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 3 ■ Valuation of Fixed Assets
49
Depreciation areas are important because they allow you to calculate various asset values in parallel 
for individual fixed assets for different purposes. For example, you may want to generate values for the 
balance sheet, which may be different from costing accounting for internal management purposes. The 
depreciation terms and values for asset valuation are managed in the depreciation area. You can create up to 
99 depreciation areas in SAP ERP. Depreciation areas are grouped in the chart of depreciation according to 
country-specific requirements.
Defining Depreciation Areas
In this step, you define the depreciation areas and specify the area type that will allow you to calculate asset 
values in parallel for each asset for various purposes. SAP comes with various county-specific depreciation 
areas you can adopt and adjust to meet your requirements.	
1.	
To define depreciation areas, use this menu path: IMG: Financial Accounting 
(New) ➤ Asset Accounting ➤ Valuation ➤ Depreciation Areas ➤ Define 
Depreciation Areas. The Choose Activity screen pops up with the option to 
define depreciation areas or specify area type (see Figure 3-2).

right side of the screen. The Determine Work Area: Entry screen pops up. This 
screen will allow you to specify the chart of depreciation you want to define for 
your depreciation areas.	
3.	
Enter your chart of depreciation (B10) in the Chart of Dep. field and click the 
Continue button at the bottom of the screen. You’ll proceed to the screen where 
you will carry out the specification of the depreciation areas for your chart of 
depreciation. The Change View “Define Depreciation Areas”: Overview screen 
appears (see Figure 3-3), showing the associated depreciation areas.■
■Note   You may not need to carry out any specifications in this activity, because the Standard Chart of
Depreciation (1GB) for your country you copied in Chapter 1 contains the corresponding settings needed for the
settings in this step.

Check the displayed chart of depreciation to see if it meets your requirements. 
You may also want to delete unwanted depreciation areas. To delete any 
unwanted depreciation areas, select the depreciation area you want to delete 
from the list of the displayed depreciation areas and click the Delete 
 button at 
the top-left side of the screen. Then save 
 your depreciation area.
Specify Area Type
SAP comes with standardization of depreciation areas you can assign to your depreciation area. You can 
access the list of standardization of depreciation areas supplied by SAP using the matchcode by the Type 
field for each depreciation area. The specification of area type will allow you to determine the valuation 
method applicable to each depreciation area. For example, when you specify the standardization of 
depreciation area 18 (balance sheet according to other guidelines, such as IAS) for Book depreciation area 
01, the system will apply this specification strictly to depreciation area 01. Likewise, when you specify the 
standardization of depreciation area 04 (Net Worth Valuation) to a given depreciation area, the system will 
use the net worth in the valuation of an asset for the specified depreciation area.	
1.	
The screen where you can specify area type for your depreciation area can 
be accessed on the Choose Activity screen shown previously in Figure 3-2 by 
double-clicking Specify Area Type from the displayed list on the screen. The 
Chart of Depreciation Selection screen then pops up. This screen will allow you 
to specify the chart of depreciation you are working on.

Chapter 3 ■ Valuation of Fixed Assets
52■
■Note   On this screen, you will notice that the area types are defaulted. You can overwrite them by entering
the area types of your choice in the type field.
You may not need to carry out any specifications in this activity because when you copied the standard chart of 
depreciation (1GB) for your country in Chapter 1, the area types for each depreciation areas were copied with 
the chart of depreciation.
Specify Transfer of APC Values
The standard system copies the asset balance sheet values from depreciation area 01 to all other 
depreciation areas during posting. (The only exceptions to this rule are areas for revaluation and for 
investment support, as well as derived depreciation areas.) Therefore, you only need to carry out this step if 
you want to copy posting values from a different depreciation area, not depreciation area 01.
In this step, you define transfer rules for posting acquisition values of depreciation areas. These transfer 
rules let you ensure that certain depreciation areas have identical acquisition values. For example, you can 
ensure that the depreciation areas holding foreign currency values use the same values in local currency.
Figure 3-4.  The Change View “”Actual Depreciation Areas: Area Type””: Overview screen

Update the following fields:
•
ValAd: This ensures that the acquisition costs are copied from a given 
depreciation area to the defined depreciation areas. For example, when you 
enter 01 as the acquisition value for book depreciation area 02, this will ensure 
that depreciation area 02 adopts the acquisition value from depreciation area 01.

Click the Enter 
 button at the top-left side of the screen to confirm your entries 
and save 
 your acquisition values’ transfer rules.
Specify Transfer of Depreciation Terms
The specifications you carry out in this step will allow you to define the transfer rules for the depreciation 
terms of the depreciation areas assigned to your chart of depreciation. This will allow you to determine 
the depreciation area from which the terms are copied. You have the option of specifying whether the 
depreciation terms for a depreciation area are optional or mandatory. The importance of specifying transfer 
of depreciation terms is that it allows you to maintain identical or uniform depreciation for the specified 
depreciation areas, as you will not be able to maintain other depreciation terms for the copying depreciation 
areas in the asset master record.
As part of your customizing, you should ensure that the depreciation areas holding foreign currency 
values use the same values in the local currency.

Setting Up Areas for Parallel Valuation
When setting parallel valuation you have to create additional accounting principles for one real and one 
derived depreciation area in asset accounting. The derived depreciation makes it possible to determine new 
asset value from a predetermined asset value. The derived depreciation applies mathematical formulas to 
ensure that the values of the asset subledger are the same in the general ledger accounting.
In this activity, you set up parallel valuation to meet certain accounting principles (for example, IAS or 
US GAAP) and disclosure requirements using the wizard tool. The wizard helps you define parallel valuation 
in asset accounting when you use the new general ledger in conjunction with the ledger approach in the new 
general ledger. You may not necessarily need to use the wizard if you have been using the account approach. 
You can also perform your settings manually instead of using the wizard.

To create valuation areas for parallel valuation, follow this menu path: IMG: 
Financial Accounting (New) ➤ Asset Accounting ➤ Valuation ➤ Depreciation 
Areas ➤ Set Up Areas for Parallel Valuation. The Chart of Depreciation Selection

the leading ledger (0L).
The bottom line is that you want to use the accounting principle LGAP (Local 
GAP) for the ledger group that contains the leading ledger. At the same time, use 
the accounting principle IAS (International Accounting Standards) for another 
ledger group for real and derived depreciation areas and assign the ledger group 
to them.

Determining Depreciation Areas in the Asset Class
In this activity, you maintain the depreciation term for your asset class in the depreciation class. An asset in 
the asset class uses the same depreciation terms. The depreciation terms contain the depreciation key and 
the asset’s useful life. The depreciation key holds the values needed for determining depreciation amount 
(depreciation key will be discussed in great detail in Chapter 4). The asset useful life is the estimated period 
an asset will be used for. Importantly, when you have maintained depreciation terms in the asset class, you do 
not have to maintain it again in the asset master record, rather they can be default values from the asset class.	
1.	
To determine depreciation areas in the asset class, use this menu path: IMG: 
Financial Accounting (New) ➤ Asset Accounting ➤ Valuation ➤ Determine 
Depreciation Areas in the Asset Class. The Change View “Asset class”: Overview 
screen is displayed. This screen contains the list of the asset classes.	
2.	
Using the 
 button at the bottom-left side of the screen, search for 
your asset classes. Select the asset class you want to determine depreciation area 
(AS3000 Plant & Machinery) and double-click the Depreciation areas folder on 
the left pane of the screen. This will take you to the Change View “Depreciation 
Areas”: Overview screen (see Figure 3-10). This screen contains the depreciation 
areas in the chart of depreciation that you assigned to the asset class for Plant 
and Machinery. On this screen, you will activate the depreciation areas you want 
to assign to the depreciation key and the asset’s useful life, and specify the screen 
layout rule you are applying to each depreciation area. The screen layout dictates 
the field status in the asset master record. For example, the screen layout 
determines whether the input fields are required, are optional entry fields, or are 
suppressed.

For your rounding specifications in this activity, you should perform the 
following specifications:
•
Net book value at year end: This indicator specifies that net book value of an 
asset should be rounded to whole units of currency at the end of the fiscal year.
•
Replacement value: Select the check box for replacement value. This 
specification will allow the system to perform automatic rounding of fixed 
assets at the replacement value. The replacement value is important for cost 
accounting or to determine insurance values.
•
Arithmetic Rounding: Select the Arithmetic Value check box. This allows the 
system to automatically determine rounding rules. For example, 5.49 is rounded 
to 5 and 5.50 is rounded to 6.

Now return to the Change View “Rounding Specifications”: Details screen using 
the Back 
 button at the top-left side of the screen to specify the rounding rules 
for the remaining depreciation areas displayed on the screen.
Specify Memo Value
In this activity, you can specify the memo value for depreciation areas and specify asset classes without a 
memo value for each depreciation area for your company code. The memo value is the value that is not 
depreciated, so that memo posting for an asset that has already exceeded its planned useful life can be 
made. The planned depreciation per annum is the year that the asset is acquired and it’s reduced by the 
memo value by the system.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 3 ■ Valuation of Fixed Assets
69
You can access the screen where you can specify memo value using this menu path: IMG: Financial 
Accounting (New) ➤ Asset Accounting ➤ Valuation ➤ Amount Specifications (Company Code/
Depreciation Area) ➤ Specify Memo Value. You specify that asset classes without a memo value not be taken 
into account by using the indicator in the asset class.
We recommend that you not manage memo values, because the memo value functions are provided 
for the management of memo values from a previous system in FI-AA. Secondly, the system often takes the 
gross values into consideration and does not just adjust the remaining asset book value. This allows fully 
depreciated assets with a 0 book value to be disclosed legally in the balance sheet. The gross value is the 
asset acquisition amount and the adjusted amount. However, if you the specify memo value, it is compulsory 
that you make sure all the related assets have equivalent book value amounts as the memo value.
Defining the Fiscal Year
The fiscal year is normally your company code accounting year or annual accounting period. A fiscal year 
variant defines your company’s accounting posting periods. A proper business accounting transaction 
normally covers a 12-month period. The normal rule is that business transactions are assigned to the period 
during which the transaction took place. The fiscal year variant is customized to match your company’s 
fiscal year, which does not necessarily have to be the same as the normal calendar year (that is, January 
to December). SAP ERP is dynamic enough to fit into your company’s calendar or fiscal year. For details 
on how to define the fiscal year, refer to our book entitled SAP ERP Financial Accounting and Controlling 
Configuration and Use Management.
In this activity, you’ll make specifications for the fiscal year in asset accounting. You can define a 
different fiscal year for calculating depreciation in asset accounting from the FI fiscal year. You will look at 
how to specify other versions on company code levels and specify other versions on depreciation area levels.
To specify the fiscal year variant for asset accounting, use this menu path: Accounting (New) ➤ Asset 
Accounting ➤ Valuation ➤ Fiscal Year ➤ Fiscal Year Variants.
Specify Other Versions on Company Code Levels
In this step, you carry out the specifications of the fiscal year version for asset accounting on your company 
code only if the fiscal year you are applying to your asset accounting is different from your general ledger in 
FI’s fiscal year. In practice, it is rare to use different fiscal years for asset accounting and for the general  
ledger in FI.
To access the specification of other versions on the company code level, use this menu path: 
Accounting (New) ➤ Asset Accounting ➤ Valuation ➤ Fiscal Year ➤ Fiscal Year Variants ➤ Specify Other 
Version on Company Code Level. The Change View “FI-AA Fiscal year version for company code”: Overview 
screen appears. This is the screen where you assign the fiscal year variant for asset accounting to the general 
ledger in FI for your company code. Search for your company code from the displayed list of company codes 
(7200) by clicking the 
 button at the bottom of the screen. Update the following field:
FV: This is the field where you specify the fiscal year version of your asset 
accounting to the general ledger in FI. This specification will allow the system to 
use the specified fiscal year variant for posting asset values to the general ledger 
in FI. We advise that you leave this field blank, which means the system will 
automatically use the fiscal year variant you assigned to your company  
code in FI.

Specify Other Versions on Depreciation Area Levels
In this step, you assign the fiscal year version to each depreciation area for your company code. This 
specification will allow the system to apply the specified fiscal year to each depreciation area differently from 
the fiscal version for your company code.
To access the screen where you perform the specification, use this menu path: Accounting (New) ➤ 
Asset Accounting ➤ Valuation ➤ Fiscal Year ➤ Fiscal Year Variants ➤ Specify Other Version on Depreciation 
Area Level. The Change View “Company codes”: Overview screen appears displaying the company codes 
in the system. Search for your company code (7200) from the list of the displayed company codes. Select 
your company code and double-click the Fiscal Year folder on the left pane of the screen. The Change View 
“Fiscal Year Variant”: Overview screen appears displaying the depreciation areas defined for your company 
code. Update the following field:
Fyear version: Enter the fiscal year version you want to apply for posting asset 
values to the general ledger in FI. You can access the fiscal year versions already 
in the system using the depreciation area’s matchcode. We recommend that you 
leave this field blank for this activity. By leaving this field blank, the system  
will automatically use the fiscal year variant you assigned to your company code 
in FI.
Specifying Currencies in Asset Accounting
The currencies are represented in the SAP ERP company code currency and additional currency (parallel 
currency). In FI, you specify that the currency ledgers be managed for each company code. The currency for 
company code is often referred to as local currency or the national currency of the company code. All other 
currencies other than the company code currency are referred to as foreign currencies from the company 
code view. Foreign currencies allow you to manage ledgers in two parallel currencies (namely, group 
currency and hard currency) in conjunction with your company code currency. Group currency is used for 
consolidated financial reports and hard currency is used in countries with high inflation rates.
In this activity, you will define a depreciation area for foreign currencies for the valuation of fixed assets 
on the level of asset accounting and specify the use of parallel currencies for the legal consolidation of your 
fixed assets.
Define Depreciation Areas for Foreign Currencies
To manage asset values in a foreign currency FI-AA, it is important to define depreciation areas for foreign 
currencies. In asset accounting, you can manage depreciation areas in any currency specifically on group 
currency. This enables you to meet certain legal disclosure requirements relating to the legal consolidation 
of the corporate group activities and for the corporate group consolidation of financial statements. 
Particularly when the valuation of assets at the group level is completely different from the company code 
valuation, it is recommended that you use a separate depreciation area for group currency for coordinating 
the group activities and for historical management of values.

Specify the Use of Parallel Currencies
You can specify parallel currencies in addition to the company code currency in the asset accounting 
module. The foreign currency specifications can be used for the legal consolidation of fixed assets. Your 
specifications in this activity will allow you to post asset values within asset accounting and, at the same 
time, update values in several currencies. You can also make postings simultaneously in the FI document in 
parallel with the posted amount in the company code currency in FI. The following settings must be in place 
for this function to work effectively:
•
The parallel currency you assigned to your company code must have the same 
currency type and the same currency of the depreciation area.
•
The depreciation terms and APC values managed in the depreciation area must be 
identical to the book depreciation.
When these settings are in place, the system will be able to post the corresponding documents with 
additional values automatically from each depreciation area. It is important to note that the SAP asset 
accounting module also supports postings made periodically to the general ledger in FI (i.e., parallel 
currencies not posted online).

Defining Group Assets
Depreciation calculation and posting of depreciation normally takes place at the level of individual assets. 
In some countries it is important to carry out special calculations to meet certain tax requirements. For 
example, in the United States certain tax reporting requirements are compulsory. Hence, these settings will 
be ideal for calculating depreciation at a higher level. To achieve this objective, you can group assets together 
into asset groups. For example, assets can be grouped together per depreciation area.
In this activity, you will be looking how to specify depreciation areas for group assets and how to specify 
asset classes for group assets.

Summary
This chapter looked the steps involved in the configuration of the valuation of fixed assets in asset 
accounting and explained the steps involved in defining depreciation areas for foreign currencies. In the 
process, you looked at how to set a chart of depreciation and the benefits of a chart of depreciation. You 
then learned about the customizing of depreciation areas. As part of the customizing steps involved in 
defining depreciation areas, you looked at how to specify area types for depreciation areas, specify transfer 
of APC values, and transfer of depreciation terms. We also showed you how to set up areas for parallel 
valuation using the wizard tool. Using the wizard tool, you saw how to assign a master area to a ledger 
group, enter an area for parallel valuation, create or select a delta area and, finally, saw the settings needed 
to carry out parallel valuation. We also took you through the steps involved in the amount specifications for 
your company code and depreciation areas by specifying maximum amount for low-value assets classes, 
rounding of netbook value, and specifying memo values.
As part of the valuation of fixed asset accounting configuration, we explained what fiscal year is and 
looked at how to define additional fiscal year variants in asset accounting at the depreciation level. You 
looked at how currencies are represented in the system and learned about depreciation area for foreign 
currencies, specifically the use of parallel currencies. Finally, you looked at how to specify depreciation areas 
for foreign currencies and asset classes for group assets.
In the next chapter, you will look at the configuration of depreciation in asset accounting. You will 
look at how to define ordinary depreciation, special depreciation unplanned depreciation, the valuation 
methods, and posting control. Further settings in asset depreciation include the definition of the cut-off 
value key, maximum base value, and the asset-specific base value percentages.

Depreciation
This chapter explains the steps involved in configuring and defining depreciation in asset accounting. In this 
chapter, you will learn how to:
•
Define ordinary depreciation
•
Define special depreciation
•
Understand planned and unplanned depreciation
•
Define valuation methods
•
Define a depreciation key
•
Define the cutoff value key
•
Specify asset-specific base value percentages
Defining Depreciation
Depreciation is simply a technical reduction in the book value of an asset due to wear and tear arising from its 
use over a period of time (often referred to as the useful economic life [UEL] of the asset). The UEL of an asset 
is the estimated period that the asset will be used. For example, the UEL of an asset may be 5 years, 15 years, 
or 20 years, etc. The UEL of an asset is determined based on the nature of the asset. Simply put, depreciation 
sets a fractional amount aside systematically over the UEL of the asset based on the asset’s value.
The money set aside is often referred to as depreciation. Depreciation is treated in the accounts as an 
expense and it reduces the profit for the fiscal year. The depreciation you set aside annually is accumulated 
for the UEL and it is often referred to as provision for depreciation or accumulated depreciation. The essence 
of provision for depreciation is setting money aside for the replacement of the asset at the end of its UEL. 
When calculating depreciation, the various factors are taken into consideration: The value of the asset, 
the UEL of the asset and the expected value of the asset at the end of its UEL (scrap value). Depreciation 
calculation can be performed using various methods. For example, there is straight-line method, declining 
or reducing balancing depreciation, sum of the digit depreciation, etc. This section describes the types of 
depreciation supported by SAP ERP.
Planned Depreciation
Planned depreciation reduces the value of the asset systematically over a given planned period. This 
could be one month, one year, etc. The idea behind this concept is to depreciate the value of the asset 
systematically over its UEL based on plan defined parameters. This method will allow you to ascertain the 
value of the asset at any time during the economic life of the asset. Typical examples of planned depreciation 
are ordinary depreciation and special depreciation.

Chapter 4 ■ Depreciation
78
Ordinary Depreciation
Ordinary depreciation is the planned reduction of a specified given period. When customizing ordinary 
depreciation, you determine depreciation areas in which you want to manage ordinary depreciation and the 
general ledger accounts in which the ordinary depreciation is posted.
Determining Depreciation Areas
In this activity, you specify the depreciation areas you want to apply to ordinary depreciation. The value you 
specify in this step will be applicable to the respective depreciation area. When you enter corresponding 
depreciation terms in the asset master record, the system will not will issue an error message.
To determine depreciation areas for ordinary depreciation, use this menu path: IMG: Financial 
Accounting (New) ➤ Asset Accounting ➤ Depreciation ➤ Ordinary Depreciation ➤ Determine 
Depreciation Areas. The Change View “Specify Depreciation Areas for Ordinary Depreciation”: Overview 
screen appears (Figure 4-1). It contains the list of depreciation areas you defined in Chapter 3 when defining 
depreciation areas.
Figure 4-1.  The specification of depreciation areas for ordinary depreciation
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 4 ■ Depreciation
79
Specify the depreciation areas you want to manage in ordinary depreciation by clicking the Ord. 
Depreciation check boxes on the right side of the screen as shown in Figure 4-1. The next step in this activity 
is to determine the rule for the positive and negative amounts the ordinary depreciation is allowed to have in 
each depreciation area.
To proceed to the screen where you will carry out the specifications for the respective depreciation 
area, select a depreciation area (for example, 01 Book depreciation) from the list area and click the Details 
 button on the top-left side of the screen. The Change View “Specify Depreciation Areas for Ordinary 
Depreciation”: Detail screen (Figure 4-2) is displayed. It contains four rules for positive/negative signs for 
ordinary depreciation options you can choose from. The system will automatically default to the Only 
Negative Values and Zero Allowed options. This option ensures that only negative depreciation amounts  
are allowed in the depreciation area in question if you want to calculate the negative depreciation or  
positive APC.
Figure 4-2.  specification of the rule for positive/negative sign for ordinary depreciation
You can override the defaults by simply specifying the option(s) of your choice based on the 
requirements of your company. For example, if you want to calculate the positive depreciation of a positive 
APC, you can specify “Only Positive Values and Zero Allowed” as the rule. This specification will then allow 
the system to ensure that only positive depreciation amounts are allowed in the depreciation area.
Likewise, if you choose All Values Allowed as the rule for ordinary depreciation, this option will allow 
both positive and negative depreciation amounts in the respective depreciation area.
Assigning Accounts
Assigning accounts is the same as determining accounts. You covered this step in Chapter 2 in the “Assigning 
G/L Accounts” section. In this activity you determine the general ledger accounts in FI where ordinary 
depreciation in Asset Accounting are posted. You can assign the general ledger accounts for ordinary 
depreciation using the menu path: IMG: Financial Accounting (New) ➤Asset Accounting ➤ Depreciation ➤ 
Ordinary Depreciation ➤Assign Accounts.

Unit-of-Production Method of Depreciation
The unit of production depreciation method is quite different from the conventional methods of 
depreciation, which are based on the passage of time (estimated usage years of an asset). Rather, this 
method takes the movement of fluctuation in activity in a given period into consideration when calculating 
depreciation. Unit of production method of depreciation calculation is based on units of activity of expected 
output or an asset’s usage. For example, the depreciation of a given asset is calculated on the basis of 
production output in a given period (i.e., in proportion to the estimated production capacity of the asset).
As part of the customizing of the unit-of-production method of depreciation, you will define the 
depreciation key for unit of depreciation and assign the estimated total number of units for the asset and 
the actual quantity produced for individual depreciation period. The system will then determine the 
depreciation amount using the total units, the actual units produced, and the APC or the net book value. 
APC is the acquisition cost of the asset or the replacement value and the net book value is APC less the 
provision for depreciation.	
1.	
To define the depreciation key and specify the number of units for the 
depreciation keys for the unit of production method of depreciation, use 
this menu path: IMG: Financial Accounting (New) ➤ Asset Accounting

Update the following fields:
•
Year: Enter the accounting fiscal year (2015) the asset relates to.
•
Per: Enter the related accounting period in this field. Accounting period is based 
on the number of months in an accounting year. This is usually 12 months. For 
example, if your accounting fiscal year is from January to December, January will 
be period 1, February will be period 2, March will be period 3, and so on.
•
Total Units: This is the estimated production units of the asset with which the 
asset is depreciated.■
■Note   The total number of units applied to the depreciation calculation for an individual period can
be changed in any given period. The system then applies the new total number of units to calculate the
depreciation.
Special Depreciation
In some cases, special depreciations are calculated purely for the wear and tear of qualifying assets for 
tax-based purposes. Qualifying assets are the assets that meet the conditions defined by the tax authority as 
considered for tax purposes. To define system settings for determining and posting special depreciation, you 
will need to first determine whether ordinary depreciation should be calculated before special depreciation.■
■Note   Some countries don’t use special depreciation, so you may not need to configure special
depreciation.
Determining Depreciation Areas
Before you determine depreciation areas, you may want to manage special depreciation. It is important that 
you create at least a chart of depreciation of your own in asset accounting. By specifying the depreciation 
areas for special depreciation, this will allow the value type to be accepted by the system without issuing an 
error message when you enter related depreciation terms in the asset master record.
To determine the depreciation area for your special depreciation, use this menu path: IMG: 
Financial Accounting (New) ➤ Asset Accounting ➤ Depreciation ➤ Special Depreciation ➤ Determine 
Depreciation Areas. The Change View “Specify Depreciation Areas for Special Depreciation”: Overview 
screen is displayed. It contains the list of depreciation areas in your chart of depreciation. Click the 
Special Depreciation check box for the appropriate depreciation areas in the depreciation area for special 
depreciation.

Calculating Ordinary Depreciation before Special Depreciation
The SAP system distinguishes between the depreciation types (ordinary depreciation, special depreciation, 
unplanned depreciation, and transaction reserves). There is no hard rule as to how the system determines 
the different types of depreciation. To specify that the system should calculate ordinary depreciation before 
special depreciation, use this menu path: Financial Accounting (New) ➤ Asset Accounting ➤ Depreciation ➤

Click the Enter 
 button at the top-left side of the screen and save 
 your work.
Unplanned Depreciation
Unplanned depreciation allows you apply an unplanned value adjustment due to an unforeseen occurrence 
of an event resulting in the permanent reduction in the value of an asset. For example, advancement in 
technology necessitates a drastic reduction in the value of an asset.
Determining Depreciation Areas
Before you determine depreciation areas, you want to manage your unplanned depreciation, because it is 
important that you create at least a chart of depreciation of your own. By specifying the depreciation areas 
for unplanned depreciation, this will allow the value type to be accepted by the system without issuing an 
error message when you enter related depreciation terms in the asset master record.
To determine depreciation area for your unplanned depreciation, use this menu path: IMG: Financial 
Accounting (New) ➤ Asset Accounting ➤ Depreciation ➤ Unplanned Depreciation ➤ Determine 
Depreciation Areas. The Change View “Asset Accounting: Define if Unplanned Deprec.Pos/Neg”: Overview 
screen is displayed. It contains the list of depreciation areas in your chart of depreciation (Figure 4-5).

www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 4 ■ Depreciation
84
Specify the depreciation areas you want to manage in unplanned depreciation by clicking the UDep 
check box on the right side of the screen. The next step in this activity is to determine the rule for positive 
and negative signs for the unplanned depreciation in each depreciation area.
To proceed to the screen where you will carry out the specifications for the respective depreciation 
areas, select a depreciation area (for example 01 Book depreciation) from the list of depreciation areas and 
click Details 
 at the top-left side of the screen. The Change View “Asset Accounting: Define if unplanned 
deprec. Pos/neg”: Overview screen is displayed containing four rules for the positive/negative sign for 
ordinary depreciation option you can choose from. The system automatically defaults to Only Negative 
Values and Zero Allowed. This option will ensure that only negative depreciation amounts are allowed in the 
depreciation area in question if you want to calculate the negative depreciation of a positive APC.
You can override the defaults by simply specifying the option of your choice based on the requirements 
of your company. For example, if you want to calculate the positive depreciation of positive APC, you 
can specify Only Positive Values and Zero Allowed as the rule for ordinary depreciation for the respective 
depreciation area. This specification will then allow the system to ensure that only positive depreciation 
amounts are allowed in the depreciation area.
Likewise, if you choose All Values Allowed as the rule for unplanned depreciation, this option will allow 
both positive and negative depreciation amounts in the respective depreciation area.
Assigning Accounts
We covered this step in Chapter 2 in the “Assign G/L Accounts” section. In this activity, you determine the 
general ledger accounts in FI where unplanned depreciation in Asset Accounting are posted. You can assign 
or determine the general ledger accounts for ordinary depreciation using the menu path: IMG: Financial 
Accounting (New) ➤ Asset Accounting ➤ Depreciation ➤ Unplanned Depreciation ➤ Assign Accounts.
Defining Transaction Types for Unplanned Depreciation
Normally, unplanned depreciation values are corrected manually in SAP when posting in asset accounting. 
When posting unplanned depreciation in asset accounting, a transaction type for unplanned depreciation 
is mandatory. Transaction types identify individual business transactions posted in asset accounting. 
SAP comes with standard transaction types you can use. It is recommended that you stick to the standard 
transaction types supplied by SAP. So do not have to do anything in this activity.■
■Note   Although we suggest that you stick to the standard transaction types, you may need to define your
own transaction types in the following situations:
·	
When you need to make postings to specific depreciation areas in the chart of depreciation.
·
	When the standard transaction types supplied by SAP do not meet our desired
requirements (limitations).
However, we recommend that you take a look at the standard settings supplied by SAP.
To get to the screen where you can define transaction types for unplanned depreciation, use this menu

Valuation Methods
In asset accounting, automatic depreciation calculations are carried out in valuation methods using 
predefined depreciation keys that contain the calculation methods you define in this activity. In valuation 
methods, you define your own depreciation keys holding calculation methods and other control parameters 
used for the calculation of depreciation by the system. Most depreciation keys and calculation methods are 
supplied by SAP.
Depreciation keys are predefined keys that hold the calculation methods containing mathematical 
functions expressed in percentages used to calculate depreciation. This enables you to determine the 
value of assets at a specific time. Therefore, depreciation keys hold the calculation methods (mathematical 
formulas) used by the system for calculating depreciation and for the settings that control various types 
of depreciation, such as ordinary depreciation, special depreciation, scrap value (cutoff value), interest 
calculation, etc.
In this step, you will look at the calculation methods you can use to calculate depreciation in FI-AA.
Calculation Methods
The calculation methods are very important for defining depreciation methods, because they contain 
the parameters used by the system for automatic calculation of depreciation. The following depreciation 
calculation methods are represented in SAP:
•
Base methods
•
Declining-balance methods
•
Maximum amount methods
•
Multi-level methods
•
Maintain period control methods

Defining Base Methods
Base methods are assigned to a depreciation key in SAP and are independent of the chart of depreciation 
(i.e., it is not country specific). SAP comes with various base methods that you can use or adapt to meet your 
requirements. The base methods supplied by SAP are generally sufficient. However, if you need to define 
one, follow these steps:

•
Dep. Method: Using the drop-down by the Dep. Method field, select Sum-of-
the-years-digits method depreciation from the list of displayed depreciation 
methods. The Sum-of-the-years-digits method depreciation is based on the 
concept of calculating depreciation based on the sum of the number of years 
contained in an asset useful economic life (UEL). This is often referred to as

Defining Declining-Balance Methods
Declining-balance methods are calculated by applying a constant depreciation rate (for example, 10%, 15%, 
20%, etc.) to the net book value (NBV) of an asset. This method is also referred to as accelerated depreciation 
in the sense that it allocates higher depreciation expenses to an asset in the earlier years of its life.■
■Note   You may not need to define your own calculation methods for declining-balance methods. The
calculation methods supplied by SAP are usually sufficient.
In this activity, you may define declining-balance methods of depreciation that you eventually assign to 
certain depreciation keys. To define declining-balancing methods, use this menu path: IMG: Financial 
Accounting (New) ➤ Asset Accounting ➤ Depreciation ➤ Valuation Methods ➤ Depreciation Key ➤ 
Calculation Methods ➤ Define Declining-Balance Methods. The Change View “Declining-Balance Method”: 
Overview screen is displayed. Click the 
 button at the top-left side of the screen to go to the standard 
screen where you will maintain the calculation methods for declining-balance methods. The New Entries: 
Overview of Added Entries screen is displayed. Maintain the declining-balance methods using up to three 
digits and their descriptions, as shown in Figure 4-9. Then specify a multiplication factor for determining the 
depreciation percentage rate and an upper limit for the depreciation percentage rate.

Defining Multi-Level Methods
A multi-level method is the process where you use a different percentage rate for depreciation for different 
years or periods. This method is more suitable when you may want to apply higher rate in the calculation 
of assets in the initial years and subsequently use a lower rate in the later years. For example, you can use a 
high rate in the earlier years when the asset is deemed to be more productive and a lower rate when the asset 
is deemed to be less productive as a result of wear and tear arising from the use of the asset.
SAP provides you with the flexibility to specify different rates of depreciation for different years or 
periods. Individual level represents the period of validity for each percentage rate of depreciation. At the end 
of the validity (year/period) of a percentage rate of depreciation, the system will automatically apply the next 
percentage rate of depreciation for the valid year/period (i.e., the next level). This is repeated systematically 
at the end of each year/period.■
■Note   SAP comes with standard multi-level methods you can use for the calculation of depreciation in most
cases.
When defining multi-level methods for your depreciation calculation, you will carry out the following 
functions:
•
Maintain the multi-level method using a three-digit character as your multi-level 
method identifier and a description.
•
Enter the parameters of the multi-level method.
Complete the following steps to define multi-level methods:	
1.	
Use this menu path: IMG: Financial Accounting (New) ➤ Asset Accounting ➤

Maintaining Depreciation Keys
A depreciation key contains the calculation methods and the parameter that controls ordinary and special 
depreciations. It also contains the parameter that controls other items like the scrap value of assets and 
the calculation of interest. Depreciation keys are maintained by assigning calculation methods to the 
depreciation keys. The duration of depreciation can be split into a number of phases in the system, so 
that when a changeover method is entered for a phase, the system moves automatically to the next phase 
when the conditions specified in the changeover method occur. The system then executes the depreciation 
calculation based on the calculation method for the phase.
When maintaining depreciation keys, you carry out the following functions:
•
Define additional depreciation keys using four-digit characters as the depreciation 
key. This includes a short description that best describes your depreciation key.
•
Assign calculation methods to the depreciation keys and activate the depreciation key.■
■Note   SAP comes with standard depreciation keys for different depreciation types that are sufficient for
this activity.

Defining the Cutoff Value Key
For some technical reasons or to meet legal requirements, it may become necessary to end the depreciation 
of some assets at a certain value level. For example, you can end the depreciation of assets before the net 
book value reaches zero. The point where you end the depreciation is referred as scrap value or cutoff value. 
SAP enables to define a cutoff value for each depreciation area. You can do this by entering an absolute scrap 
value in the asset master record or by specifying a cutoff percentage in the cutoff value (calculation) key.
SAP provides standard cutoff value keys you can adapt to meet your requirements by revising the time 
specifications of the scrap value keys that come with it.	
1.	
You can define your cutoff value key using this menu path: IMG: Financial 
Accounting (New) ➤ Asset Accounting ➤ Depreciation ➤ Valuation Methods ➤
Further Settings ➤ Define the Cutoff Value Key. The Change View “Cutoff Value

Key field.	
4.	
Next, specify the date you want the system to start calculating the percentages 
for your cutoff key in the Start Date of Calculation of Percentages section of the 
screen. In this section, you have four options you can choose from:
•
FROM asset capitalization date
•
FROM ordinary depreciation start date for the asset
•
FROM special depreciation start date for the asset
•
FROM original acquisition date for asset under construction
For the current activity, select FROM Asset Capitalization Date. This will allow 
the system to carry out calculations using the asset capitalization date.

Defining the Maximum Base Value
This step is not necessary if the limited acquisition value is not required as a base for calculating 
depreciation. Limited acquisition value simply indicates that the system uses the maximum amount as the 
base value for depreciation. When calculating depreciation, the system uses the acquisition value of the 
asset as the basis for calculating depreciation, if the value is below the specified maximum amount. On the 
other hand, if the asset acquisition value exceeds the specified maximum amount you specified as the base 
value, the system will automatically use the asset acquisition value as the basis for calculating depreciation.
Maximum base values are not delivered by SAP. To define maximum base values, use this menu path: IMG: 
Financial Accounting (New) ➤ Asset Accounting ➤ Depreciation ➤ Valuation Methods ➤ Further Settings ➤

Summary
This chapter defined depreciation and looked at the various depreciation methods supported by SAP (for 
example, planned and unplanned depreciation). Under planned/unplanned depreciation, you learned 
about ordinary depreciation. You then went through the steps involved in customizing depreciation areas. 
You went on to look at how to define unit of production depreciation. The next thing you did was look at 
what special depreciation is. Then you learned how to determine depreciation areas, calculate ordinary 
depreciation before special depreciation, and define transaction types for unplanned depreciation. You also 
looked at valuation methods represented by SAP and then went on to learn to define your own calculation 
methods and other control parameters specific to your calculation methods. This included defining various 
calculation methods (i.e. base methods, declining-balance methods, maximum amount methods, multi-
level methods, and period control methods). You also looked at how to maintain depreciation keys and 
assign calculation methods to depreciation keys.
Finally, the chapter briefly touched period control and further settings in depreciation in asset 
accounting. This included how to define cutoff value keys, define a maximum base value, and specify an 
asset-specific base value key.
The next chapter looks at special valuation and the various activities involved in customizing special 
valuation. This includes the specifications involved in reserves for special depreciation, transfer of reserves 
(differed gain), investment support, and how to define investment support measures, and revaluation of 
fixed assets.

Special Valuation
This chapter looks at the steps involved in the configuration of special valuation in Asset Accounting and 
also explains the various steps involved in defining special value adjustments to assets (investment support, 
special depreciation reserves) in asset accounting.
Some assets are classified as special assets and are treated differently by using a special valuation 
adjustment approach. In SAP, special valuation component plays an important role when calculating asset 
values for a specialized purpose. In this chapter, you will be defining system settings for:
Special valuation adjustments: for example, reserves for special depreciation, 
investment support, and index series.
Special valuation purposes: for example, cost accounting replacement values, 
interest, and revaluation of fixed assets
You will learn how to define the following aspects of special valuation:
•
Reserves for special depreciation
•
Transferred reserves (deferred gain)
•
Investment support
•
Revaluation of fixed assets
Reserves for Special Depreciation
In most countries, tax depreciation rates can be used for book depreciation. Hence, it is important to 
differentiate between tax depreciation and normal depreciation. For this reason, book depreciation is 
conducted based on the normal requirements and the allowed depreciation by tax law. The tax depreciation 
that exceeds the book depreciation is treated as special reserves and disclosed as liabilities in the balance 
sheet. Tax depreciation is an expense and is deductible from taxable income for a given period based on 
certain tax laws. The differentiation and disclosure of book depreciation and tax depreciation in a derived 
depreciation area in SAP is achieved using special reserves component. This is a common practice in 
Germany, for example.
In the next step, you will specify net reserves for special depreciation and assign accounts that special 
reserves are posted.

Specifying Gross or Net Procedure for Reserves
In this customizing step, you will specify whether the system should apply gross or net procedure to balance 
amounts when allocating or writing off reserves on the same asset in the same posting run against each 
other (net posting).■
■Note   It is recommended that you use the net posting procedure because this meets legal requirements in
most countries.

Determining Depreciation Areas for Transferred Reserves 
(Deferred Gain)
Transferred reserves, as the name suggests, is a component that allows you to technically transfer all or 
part of deferred gain (sometime referred to as balancing charges or undisclosed reserves) generated from 
the sale of assets to newly acquired assets. The benefit of this technique is to use the gain from the sale to 
reduce the depreciation base of the acquired assets. On the contrary, if the reserves arising from the sale of 
asset are not applied to assets in the year in which they arise, because no new assets were acquired in that 
year, you can create a special reserve and carry the gain to the special reserve on the liability side of the 
balance sheet. The tax law in most countries allows this practice and the gains are not counted as part of 
profit made by the company. It is expected that the special reserves are transferred to newly acquired assets 
within a few years.
In this step you will specify the depreciation areas for which you want transfer reserves (deferred gain) 
and determine the general ledger accounts the reserves are posted. This specification will avoid the  
system from issuing error message when corresponding depreciation terms are entered into the asset 
master record:

Investment Support
In some countries, the government gives incentives as subsidies for special investments based on stipulated 
conditions. This form of investment subsidy is technically referred to as “investment support.” This subsidy 
simply reduces the Acquisition and Production Costs (APC) value or valuation adjustment. In practice, the 
investment support can either be treated as a reduction if the APC value in the balance sheet or disclosed 
separately valuation adjustment on the liabilities side of the balance sheet. The investment support 
component in SAP is specifically geared toward the management of government subsidies in order to meet 
legal treatment and disclosure requirements.
When defining investment support in SAP, you carry out the following steps:
•
Determine the depreciation areas you want to manage investment support
•
Define investment support measures
•
Assign the account you want to post subsidies

Defining Investment Support Measures
The investment support measure is the component in SAP that holds the parameters which determines 
how investment support is managed in SAP. Subsidies can be used to reduce the acquisition and production 
costs (APC) of the asset in question on the asset side of the balance sheet or as valuation adjustment on the 
liabilities side of the balance sheet. In your configuration, you must decide whether the investment measure 
is managed on the liabilities side or as APC reduction on the asset side of the balance sheet.■
■Note   You should manage the investment support in the book depreciation area of your chart of
depreciation if you chose to have the investment support reduce the APC value. On the contrary, if you chose
to manage the investment support as an adjustment value on the liabilities side, then you should do this in the
special depreciation area (and not in the book depreciation area). However, for reporting purposes you can also
manage additional investment measure in other depreciation areas.

Invest.support: This is defined by using a two-digit character (01) as the 
identification key for your investment support and a short text that best 
describes your investment support.
•
Support area: You enter the depreciation area key of the depreciation area in 
which you want to manage the investment support (for example, depreciation 
area 41 – Investment support deduction from asset). You can access the list of 
depreciation key using the matchcode by the support area field. A Matchcode is 
a search function provided by SAP in the system, which allows you to search or 
look up items codes in the system.
•
Inv.supp. type: Investment support type is defaulted by the system based from 
the settings that you made when specifying the depreciation areas that you want 
to carry out investment support. Setting determines how investment support 
measure should be carried out, either as a value adjustment on the liabilities 
side of the balance sheet or as a reduction of APC.

that you want to start the investment support calculation. To access the list 
of options you want to use as the start dates, click the pull down arrow by the 
per. from field. Choose “From capitalization date.” This is the date the asset in 
question was acquired.
•
Repayment type for premature retirement: This function allows to choose 
from four options. This is the indicator that controls the proportion of the 
investment support you claimed on a premature retired asset which need to be 
paid back within the specified retention period. For example, the “Investment 
support is paid back completely.” This option will allow you to pay back the 
investment support received due to premature retirement of an asset. A 
premature retirement of an asset may arise due to the premature write-back
of asset retirement for investment support valuation adjustment on the
liabilities side.

Revaluation of Fixed Assets
An enterprise in most cases (depending on the activities of the enterprise) holds fixed assets for the purpose 
of producing goods or rendering services as opposed to be held as the primary object of business. A typical 
example of fixed assets that fell under this category include, properties, machineries, licenses/patents, 
and so on. Some of the assets held by an enterprise may appreciate (increase in value) or depreciate 
(reduction in value) in market value over time due to certain prevailing conditions (i.e., inflation, deflation, 
technological obsolesces, etc.). For example, in recent times we have seen high appreciation in market value

of properties today as compared to the original value of the properties few years ago in most countries of the 
world due to inflation. In finance in order for the asset in question to be disclosed in the balance sheet at its 
true value, it is important to revise the value of the asset to be in line with the prevailing fair market value 
using the revaluation of fixed assets technique.
To avoid the abuse of revaluation of fixed assets, the finance regulatory bodies in several countries have 
come up with various accounting standards and GAAPs to ensure uniform standards applied consistently in 
the treatment of fixed assets revaluation.
In order to be able to account for revaluation of fixed assets arising from an inflation-related increase or 
reduction in the value of fixed assets. Revaluation of fixed assets is important for one of these reasons:
•
For management internal reporting to aid decision making
•
Proper accounting treatment for tax requirements
SAP provides the following functions for the treatment of revaluation of fixed assets:
•
Index replacement values
•
Revaluation for the balance sheet
Index Replacement Values
Apart for being able to determine the historical APC of an asset, the system uses index series to determine 
the asset replacement values. The determined asset replacement value is then uses as a base for calculating 
depreciation in Asset Accounting.
The replacement value may be used under the following conditions:
•
In a high inflation environment. For example, a country where interest rate is 
significantly high. It makes sense to use replacement value as a basis for determining 
depreciation.
•
For cost accounting purposes, it is ideal to consider price changes of investment 
goods as a reasonable pricing policy.
•
For a comparison of companies with similar real estate, the use replacement value as 
the basis of depreciation is an important reserves policy.
The index series you specify will allow the system to automatically take periodic value changes into 
consideration when depreciation that is asset-specific or class-specific is posted. When you cost your own 
product price, it is advisable to take normal price rate rise into consideration by simply transferring the 
depreciation derived from the replacement value to controlling. When defining index replacement values in 
Asset Accounting you carry out the following steps:
•
Determine the depreciation areas for indexed replacement values
•
Define index series
Determining Depreciation Areas
In this activity, you will specify the depreciation areas that you want to manage replacement values:

Defining Index Series
If you want to calculate depreciation replacement values, you definitely need index figures. You need to 
define index series and historical index figure for your index series. For the system to calculate replacement 
value, you need to maintain index figures which starts at the time the oldest asset with an index series was 
acquired, up to the takeover time of the old assets data:

Summary
In this chapter, we started with how assets are classified and treated using special valuation adjustment 
components. We explained how permitted book depreciation that exceeds the book depreciation are 
treated as special depreciation and disclosed in the liabilities side in the balance sheet. We then taught 
how to customize the specification of gross or net procedure and how to assign accounts that they are 
posted in general ledger. The thing we looked at was transferred reserves (differed gain). In doing this, we 
looked at the customizing steps involved in determining depreciation areas. Thereafter, we looked at what 
investment support and took you through the steps involved in defining investment support by looking 
at how to determine the depreciation areas for managing investment support, how to define investment 
support measures, and how to assign them investment support measures to the accounts where you want to 
post subsidies. We went on to look at the purpose of fixed assets revaluation. For example, for management 
internal reporting to aid management decision making and for proper accounting treatment for tax 
requirements.

Finally we looked at the function provided by SAP for the treatment of fixed assets. These include 
index replacement values and revaluation for balance sheet. In index replacement values, we looked at the 
purpose of index replacement values as replacement values and various conditions for when replacement 
values may be used, for example, in a high inflation economy, for cost accounting purposes, and for real 
estate valuation in order to show a fair market value. We then finally briefly looked at the revaluation for the 
balance sheet.
In the next chapter we will be looking at the customizing steps in defining master data in FI-AA. This 
will include defining screen layout for asset master data, screen layout for asset depreciation areas, and how 
to specify tab layout for asset master record. We will then go on to look at how to create a master record for 
assets, group assets, and subnumbers. Finally, we will then look at how to change assets and group assets 
master records, respectively.

Customizing Master Data
This chapter looks at the steps involved in the configuration of master data in Asset Accounting and also 
explained the various steps involved in customizing master data in asset accounting.
In this chapter, you will learn what master data is and how to:
•
Define screen layouts for asset master data
•
Define screen layouts for asset depreciation areas
•
Specify tab layouts for asset master record
•
Define substitution for mass changes
•
Maintain a depreciation key
•
Create a master record for assets, group assets, and subnumbers
•
Change assets and group assets master records
•
Display master records
What Is Master Data?
Master data in Asset Accounting is critical data about the fixed assets held in the system that remains 
relatively unchanged over a period of time. Using master data in Asset Accounting you can create, change, 
and display asset data.
The master asset master record holds the basic asset master data, which contains the specific 
information about the fixed assets. This includes the general information about the asset (such as the asset 
description, asset main number text, account determination, etc.), the time-dependent aspects (such as 
business area, cost center, plant, location, functional area, and real estate key), investment measures, trading 
partner, net worth valuation, real estate, and similar rights, and so on. And the calculation aspect of the 
master data for calculating the fixed assets APC and depreciation (for example, the depreciation key, the 
asset useful life, the depreciation methods, the asset scrap value, etc.).
In SAP FI-AA, you can customize the settings for needed for master data. In this chapter we will be 
looking at how to define screen layouts and create asset master records.

Screen Layout
Screen layout holds the screen layout rules that allow you to define the structure of your asset master 
records. In SAP FI-AA, the master records come with a large number of fields to meet varied needs. Some of 
the fields may not be need for your own use, so it is important that during the customizing of master data, 
you maintain your master record by carrying out the following specifications to meet your requirements:
•
Define a screen layout for asset master data
•
Define a screen layout for asset depreciation areas and
•
Specify a tab layout for asset master record
Defining the Screen Layout for Asset Master Data
Here you define the screen layout for asset master data. Your specifications allow you structure the asset 
master record in the asset class for each asset class individually. The importance of the screen layout  
for asset master data is that the specification you make controls the field group features in the asset  
master record.■
■Note   SAP comes with defined screen layout you can use as reference when defining your screen layout
for asset master data. We recommend that you look the predefined screen layout supplied by SAP in the
system, before attempting to define your own screen layout.
To define screen layout for asset master data, perform the following steps:	
1.	
Use this menu path: IMG: Financial Accounting (New) ➤ Asset Accounting ➤ 
Master Data ➤ Screen Layout ➤ Define Screen Layout for Asset Master Data. The 
Choose Activity screen comes up with activities you can choose from (Define

optional, or suppressed.
•
The maintenance level of the master record screen. This is the other part of 
screen where you define the maintenance level for a field, for example, the 
main asset number and the asset subnumber. This setting will allow the field to 
receive a default value from the asset class. However, the default value can be 
over written during the master data maintenance.
•
The final specification is to define the master record can be copied; for example, 
you can use the master record as a reference master record when creating a new 
master record.

Specifying the Tab Layout for Asset Master Records
Data relating to assets are stored in master record via several input fields. In order to be able to manage the 
large number of fields contained in the asset master record, the master record component is divided into 
tab pages. Each page holds a certain number of fields. Tab pages use the principle of the conventional index 
cards. SAP provides standard predefined tab layout rule containing all field groups which you can use for 
this activity. Therefore, creating you own tab pages and input fields are not necessary.
In this activity you can determine which tab pages are displayed for each asset class. The field groups 
that should appear in each tab page and the order which the tab pages should appear in the master record.

Creating a Master Record
Because we have completed defining the control parameters for an asset master record, the next step is to 
look at how to create the asset master record.
Asset Master Record contains two parts:
•
The part that hold general data, which relates to general information about the asset, 
which seldom change
•
The part that holds data for calculating Asset Values. Here you make specifications 
for depreciation terms in the asset master record for each depreciation area in the 
chart of depreciation. This section of the master record contains an overview of the 
depreciation areas. There is also a detailed display for each depreciation area. The 
depreciation areas that are not needed for specific asset can be deactivated at the 
asset level.
In this activity we will be creating a master record for assets, group assets, and subnumbers and taking a 
look at how to change/edit and display asset master record.
Creating Assets
Use the following steps you can create an asset in the asset master data:	
1.	
Use this menu path: Accounting ➤ Financial Accounting ➤ Fixed Assets ➤ Assets ➤ 
Create ➤ Asset. The Create Asset: Initial screen is displayed (Figure 6-7).

2.	
Update the following fields using Figure 6-7 as a reference:
•
Asset Class: For each master record, you must assign one asset class. Enter 
the appropriate asset class (for example AS3000 for Plant & Machinery) for the 
asset in question you are creating the master record in this field (You can refer 
to chapter one on more details on asset classes.) You can access the list of asset 
class in the system, use. To access the list of asset class in the system you can use 
the matchcode by the asset class field.
•
Company Code: Enter your company code (7200) in this field. This is the 
company code you want to manage the asset master record.
•
Number of similar assets: This is defaulted by the system. This function will 
allow you to create multiple identical assets in a single master data transaction.

•
Business Area: Business area is a specific business segment of operation of an 
organizational unit, entrusted with the responsibility of external accounting that 
relates specifically to its own activities in an enterprise. Enter the appropriate 
business area key (1000) for your asset master record in this field. This entry 
will allow every posting to an asset balance sheet to be automatically posted by 
the system to this business area. So you do not need to manually make account 
assignment for a business area.
•
Cost Center: Enter the cost center (1100) that you want to manage your asset 
master record in this field. Cost center is used for internal purpose to records 
costs with reference to plan values. For internal accounting purposes, it is 
important to assign asset costs to cost centers. You can assign individual asset in 
Asset Accounting to exactly one cost center.

Repeat the same process for the remaining asset classes.
Specifying Depreciation Areas for Group Assets
Normally, depreciation is calculated for each asset at the level of individual asset in FI-AA for each 
asset main number or subnumber. The asset main number is a unique number that identifies an asset, 
whereas the asset number allows you to identify the individual subassets separately. This is the case in an 
environment where you have an asset consisting of several component assets.
The group assets specification allows you to group several assets together for the calculation and 
posting of depreciation. In some countries, in order to meet certain tax disclosure requirements, such 
as for Asset Depreciation Rang (ADR) in the United States, SAP FI-AA Group assets component allows 
you to calculate asset depreciation at a higher level to meet these requirements, rather than calculating 
depreciation at individual asset level. (ADR is an accounting method businesses can use for calculating asset 
depreciation, which is generally acceptable by IRS for determining asset classes and year of acquisition.)■
■Note   In SAP FI-AA, the asset group is represented with a separate master record different from the normal
master record.
Before managing group asset, first you must specify each depreciation area that you want to manage on 
group asset level in your company code:

Creating Subnumbers
Subnumbers are used to manage asset with several components. This is ideal in an environment where an 
asset has several components and the management want to be able to control each component individually, 
although for external and tax reporting purposes, it may be ideal to depreciate the entire asset uniformly. By 
contrast, for cost accounting purposes, the subassets are usually depreciated individually. You can create a 
subnumber for each asset or group asset.
Creating a Subnumber for Assets
To create a subnumber for an asset, complete the following steps:

Summary
In this chapter, we talked about master data and its importance in Asset Accounting. We then talked briefly 
about various screen layouts provided by SAP in the system and their uses. We then took you through the 
customizing steps involved in defining screen layout for asset master data, depreciation areas, and how 
to specify tab layout for asset master record. We then went on to look at how to create master record. In so 
doing, we looked how to define the control parameters for asset master record for asset and group assets. As 
part of the master record customizing, we looked at how to define subnumbers for assets components for 
asset and group assets.
Finally, we taught you how to change master record and display master record in Asset Accounting.
In the next chapter, we will be looking at ow to define transactions in Asset Accounting. In so doing, we 
will define transaction types for asset acquisitions, account assignment category for asset purchase orders, 
define transaction types for asset retirements, define gain/loss posting, define transaction types for asset 
transfers, and capitalization of assets under construction. We will then go on to look at how to post asset 
acquisition, post capitalized assets under construction, post asset transfer, and asset retirement.

Transactions
Customizing transactions is important for posting transactions in asset accounting. To post asset 
acquisitions, asset retirements, and asset transfers in asset accounting, you need to define the important 
transaction types for each posting activity for asset accounting. Transaction types are used to distinguish 
various transactions posted in the account. In this activity, we will be looking at how to define transaction 
types for asset acquisition, asset retirements, and asset transfers.
Asset Acquisitions
Asset acquisition transactions can either be an external acquisition (with a vendor or from an affiliated 
company) or in-house production. It is important that you define transaction types for asset acquisition that 
will differentiate asset acquisitions from other transactions when posting them in the system.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 7 ■ Customizing Transactions
138
Defining Transaction Types for Acquisitions
You can define transaction types for asset acquisitions and limit transaction types to certain depreciation 
areas in this customizing step. If you limit transaction types to certain depreciation areas, the system 
will generate a popup window, which will only propose the depreciation areas that can posted during 
transaction posting. You do not need to do anything in this step. SAP comes with standard transaction types, 
which are usually sufficient for these requirements.■
■Note   We recommend that you use the standard transaction types supplied by SAP, as they are almost
always sufficient for your requirements. Secondly, defining your own transaction types may be cumbersome
and time consuming, as you will also need to define the associated tables.
To define transaction types for asset acquisitions, follow these steps:	
1.	
Use this menu path: IMG: Financial Accounting (New) ➤ Asset Accounting ➤
Transactions ➤ Acquisitions ➤ Define Transaction Types for Acquisitions. The 
Choose Activity screen is displayed (Figure 7-1), showing the activities you can 
choose from.

Update the following fields:
•
Trans. Type: You can enter up to a three-digit character as your transaction type 
key and short text describing your transaction type.
•
Transaction Type Grp: You specify the transaction type group you want to 
assign your transaction type. SAP comes with a list of transaction type groups 
you can choose from. You can access the supplied transaction type groups by 
using the matchcode next to the Transaction Type Grp field.
•
Debit Transaction: By selecting this button, the system will automatically post 
transactions using this transaction type as a debit in the account.■
■Note   It is also possible to specify that transactions should be posted as credits to the account by selecting
an account assignment for credit transaction. 	 	 
•
Capitalize Fixed Asset: You may instruct the system to capitalize a fixed asset 
by checking this box. This specification will allow the system to recognize the 
transaction as an asset and capitalize it.
•
Document Type: Specify the document type (AA) you want to apply to your 
transaction type. SAP comes with standard document types. You can access 
the list of document types supplied by SAP using the matchcode. A document 
distinguishes the business transaction to be posted. The document type AA is for 
asset posting.
•
Do Not Post to Affiliated Co.: By clicking this button, when you use this 
transaction type, you will not be able to post to an affiliated company.
•
Post Net: The capitalization amount, excluding input tax and cash discount, is 
used when you post an asset acquisition.
•
Consolidation Transaction Type: Specify the consolidation transaction type 
(120-Acquisition) for your transaction type. It groups transaction types together 
for legal consolidation. SAP comes with a list of predefined consolidation types. 
You can access the list of consolidation types using the matchcode.
•
Asst Hist Sheet Grp: Specify the asset history sheet group you want to use for 
your transaction type. This allows you to group similar items together. You can 
access the list of asset history sheet groups using the matchcode.

Defining the Account Assignment Category for Asset Purchase Orders
SAP comes with settings for account assignment categories you can use your asset purchase order. When 
processing purchase orders in material management (MM), you can post asset acquisitions. Purchase orders 
can also be posted using account assignment to an asset. Based on the settings of the account assignment 
category, when you post goods receipt (GR) or invoice receipt (IR), the system will automatically capitalize 
the asset in question.■
■Note   Make sure that you have already created the asset in order to make this account assignment.
The account assignment category is entered in the system when you create a purchase order. For 
example, account category A informs the system that the transaction is a fixed asset purchase order. 
Secondly, you should also specify in the account assignment category whether you want the system to 
valuate GR.■
■Note   We recommend that you use the standard categories provided by SAP instead of creating new ones.
To define an account assignment category for an asset purchase order, perform the following steps:	
1.	
Use this menu path: IMG: Financial Accounting (New) ➤ Asset Accounting ➤
Transactions ➤ Acquisitions ➤ Define Account Assignment Category for Asset 
Purch. Orders. The Change View “Account Assignment Categories”: Overview 
screen is displayed, showing the list of account assignment categories.

Assigning Accounts
Account assignment was covered in Chapter 2, when we defined how depreciation areas post to the general 
ledger. Basically, the account you assigned in this customizing step will allow the system to post asset 
transactions to the general ledger in FI.	
1.	
In order to define general ledger accounts for asset acquisition, you can use 
this menu path: IMG: Financial Accounting (New) ➤ Asset Accounting ➤ 
Transactions ➤ Acquisitions ➤ Assign Accounts. The Chart of Depreciation 
Selection screen pops up. This screen allows you to specify the chart of 
depreciation for account determination.	
2.	
Enter your chart of depreciation (B10) in the Chart of Depreciation field and click 
the Enter 
 button at the bottom-left side of the screen. The Change View 
“Chart of Accounts”: Overview screen is appears containing your chart of 
accounts (INT – Chart of accounts – international).	
3.

determination in the system appears.	
4.	
Click the 
 button at the bottom of the screen to search for your 
account determinations (you created account determination in Chapter 1 in the 
“Specifying Account Determination” section). You have to assign accounts you 
want to post asset transactions to each account determination individually.■
■Note   You don’t need to do any account assignment in this step, because you already did this in Chapter 2.
Asset Retirements
When an asset is retired, it simply means the asset is removed from the asset portfolio. The removal of asset 
can be complete or removal from the asset portfolio. Retirement can be performed in the following ways:
•
Asset sold for a profit to a customer (this is a customer with a customer account in 
the system) or to someone else (not a customer account in the system)
•
Asset retirement by scrapping
•
Asset sold to an affiliated company
Defining Transaction Types for Retirements
Transaction types play a significant role in asset retirement, especially when differentiating between the 
business transactions that led to asset retirement. In this activity, you can define transaction types for 
posting fixed asset retirements, to limit transaction types to depreciation areas, or to define transaction types 
for subsequent costs/revenues.
When you limit transaction types to depreciation areas, only the depreciation areas you specified are 
proposed for posting by the system. When posting transaction, the system will generate a popup window, 
displaying the depreciation areas that can be posted.

Gain/Loss Posting
When transaction types are used, the system will automatically create gain or loss posting in addition to the 
revenue clearing entry when you use the standard transaction types. However, the gain and loss posting 
are not dependent on transaction types. The gain/loss from retirement indicator in the definition of the 
transaction type determines or controls the automatic creation of the gain/loss postings. It is also possible 
for gain/loss to be posted manually by not setting this indicator in this customizing step. In some cases, asset 
retirements accounting are treated differently as a result of different legal requirements in each particular 
country. So it is important to carry out the settings necessary to meet the needs of these requirements.
In this activity, we will look at how to:
•
Determine posting variants
•
Define transaction types for write-ups due to gain/loss
•
Post a net book value instead of gain/loss
Determining Posting Variants
Variants allow you to group assets according to each country’s legal requirements. SAP come with up to five 
variants. They allow you to determine the bookkeeping technique you want to apply for the treatment of 
gain/loss for a fixed asset retirement for each depreciation area:
•
Variant 0: Retirement with gain/loss allows you to post gain/loss to the profit 
and loss account. This is the standard asset retirement transaction type. This is a 
commonly used variant to meet legal requirements in most countries.
•
Variant 1: Enter gain/loss in bal.sheet only if NBV <= APC. This allows you to post 
gain/loss to the value adjustment account on the liability side for asset retirement 
in order to meet American asset depreciation range (ADR) legislation requirements. 
ADR is a standard procedure acceptable by Inland Revenue Services (IRS) used by 
companies in determining the useful economic life (UEL) of certain asset classes by 
applying upper and lower limits based on the UEL of the depreciable assets.
•
Variant 2: Balance revenue allows you to post the total amount of sales to the liability 
side of the asset for asset retirement. This treatment of asset retirement also allows 
you to meet the American ADR legislation requirements.
•
Variant 3: Post gain/loss to special assets for gain/loss. Gain/loss can be posted to 
special assets for gain/loss at asset retirement.
•
Variant 4: Enter gain/loss in the bal.sheet even if over APC. This allows you to post 
gain/loss arising from the retirement of assets even if it exceeds the acquisition and 
production cost of the asset.
To specify transaction type you want to use to manage posting variants, use the following steps:	
1.	
To determine posting variants, use this menu path: Financial Accounting (New) 
➤ Asset Accounting ➤ Transactions ➤ Retirements ➤ Gain/Loss Posting ➤ 
Determine Posting Variants. The Chart of Depreciation Selection screen pops up.	
2.	
Enter your chart of depreciation key (B10) in the ChDep field and click then the

Defining Transaction Types for Write-Ups Due to Gain/Loss
This is another method of asset retirement in FI-AA. This step is essential only when you want to post gain/
loss on special assets, rather than posting gain/loss to the profit and loss account. This method is applicable 
in certain countries (for example, the United States). SAP comes with standard transaction types for gain/
loss (770). It is strongly recommended that you stick to this transaction type and it is not necessary to 
create your own transaction type in this step. However, we will be taking you through the customizing steps 
involved in transaction types for write-ups due to gain/loss for illustrative purposes only.	
1.	
Transaction types for write-ups due to gain/loss can be defined using this menu 
path: Financial Accounting (New) ➤ Asset Accounting ➤ Transactions ➤

Posting Net Book Value Instead of Gain/Loss
This setting is only necessary if you want to post the net book value (NBV) of the asset at asset retirement, 
instead of posting gain/loss to the profit and loss account. In this activity, you specify the company code you 
want to use to manage NPV at asset retirement.
You can specify the company code using this menu path: Financial Accounting (New) ➤ Asset 
Accounting ➤ Transactions ➤ Retirements ➤ Gain/Loss Posting ➤ Post Net Book Value Instead of Gain/
Loss. The Change View “FI-AA: “Posting Remaining Value””: Overview screen appears, displaying the list of

Asset Transfers
Assets can be transferred using intracompany or intercompany asset transfer methods. By using the 
intracompany asset transfer method, an asset or an asset component is simply transferred in the same 
company code to a different asset master record. One of the following factors may necessitate the need to 
carry out intracompany asset transfers:
•
When you mistakenly create an asset in a wrong asset class, because an asset class 
cannot be modified in the asset master data. The only way to remedy this error is to 
transfer it in the company code to which the asset relates in the appropriate master 
record.
•
When an asset component is transferred between assets in the same company code.
•
When an asset under construction is transferred to a finished asset.

We will be looking at intercompany asset transfers in detail in the “Intercompany Asset Transfer” 
section.
In this activity, we will be looking at how to:
•
Define transaction types for transfers
•
Specify the posting variant for retirement transfers
Defining Transaction Types for Transfers
In this customizing activity, you define transaction types for asset retirement transfers, for asset acquisition 
transfers and limit transaction types to depreciation areas. By limiting a transaction type to a depreciation 
area, the transaction type in question can only be applicable to the assigned depreciation area. In this 
situation, the transaction posting is carried out from the sending company’s (the company carrying out the 
transfer) viewpoint.
There are two basic transaction types represented in SAP for transfers between assets. Namely:
•
For asset retirement from a sending asset. A sending asset is the asset making a 
transfer to another asset (the receiving asset)
•
For asset addition to a receiving asset■
■Note   SAP comes with standard transaction types sufficient for this function, which you can adapt to meet
your requirements.
To define your transaction types for asset transfers, perform these steps:	
1.	
Use this menu path: Financial Accounting (New) ➤ Asset Accounting ➤ 
Transactions ➤ Transfers ➤ Define Transaction Types for Transfers. The Choose 
Activity -screen pops up with a list of activities you can carry out, as shown in 
Figure 7-7.

make an offsetting entry of acquisition transfer, using the prior year acquisition 
from capitalization.
•
Acquisition in Same Year: Enter the appropriate acquisition in the same year 
(320 – Retirement transfer: Current-year acquisition). This specification will 
allow the system to make an asset retirement transfer, using the current year of 
the asset acquisition.	
6.	
Click the Enter 
 button at the top-left side of the screen and then save 
.
Specifying the Posting Variant for Retirement Transfers
The specification you perform in this step enables you to determine how you want to treat asset retirement 
transfers in each depreciation area in the chart of depreciation for your company code. It is important to 
define different transaction types to post fixed asset APC retirements and the retirement of proportional 
value adjustments for asset retirement. You have two options for specifying posting of variant for retirement 
transfers:
•
The asset retirement transfer is carried out using the asset APC and proportional 
value adjustment
•
The transfer of asset acquisition and production costs (APC) with proportional value 
adjustment or transfer of APC without proportional value adjustment is carried out
The transfer of asset APCs without the proportional value adjustment option is accepted by the IRS in 
the United States for grouping assets to meet ADR requirements.■
■Note   The standard transaction types are sufficient for this requirement. You don’t need to do anything in
this activity. We recommend that you use the standard transaction types for this requirement.
Follow these steps to specify posting variants for retirement transfers:	
1.	
Use this menu path: Financial Accounting (New) ➤ Asset Accounting ➤ 
Transactions ➤ Transfers ➤ Define Transaction Types for Transfers. The Change 
View “Transaction Type Selection”: Overview screen appears, displaying the list 
of transaction types supplied by SAP.	
2.	
The next step is to specify the depreciation areas you want manage the transfer 
of APC only for this transaction type. To do this, select the transaction type you 
want to use from the list of transaction types displayed and double-click the 
Special Handling of Transfer Posting in Transaction Type selection on the left 
pane of the screen. The Change View “Special Handling of Transfer Posting”: 
Overview screen appears, showing the list of depreciation areas you defined for 
your chart of accounts.

Intercompany Asset Transfers
Intercompany asset transfers, simply put, are transfers of assets between two company codes in the same 
corporate group. Unlike intracompany transfer, the assignment of the asset cannot be changed through 
maintenance in the asset master record. For intercompany transfer transactions, you need another asset 
master record in the receiving company code. The receiving company code is the company to which the 
asset is being transferred. You can post intercompany code asset transfers two ways in SAP:
•
Automatic intercompany transfer
•
Manual intercompany transfer
As part of automatic asset transfers, you define the control parameters that allow the automatic 
intercompany asset transfers by carrying out the following settings:
•
Define cross-system depreciation areas
•
Define transfer variants
During document posting, you only post asset transfer on the sender company code and the system 
automatically executes the posting in the target (receiving) company code.

Defining Cross-System Depreciation Areas
The cross-system depreciation areas control the transfer of values during intercompany asset transfer. The 
company codes involved in asset transfer may not have the same chart of depreciation. However, they may 
have depreciation areas in their chart of depreciations that have the same function with different keys. In this 
activity, you define cross-system depreciation to ensure that the depreciation areas with the same function 
are assigned even though they have different charts of depreciation. Your assignment will allow all the 
depreciation areas to use a common key that’s valid in all clients. When customizing, you specify individual 
transfer methods in a transfer variant for each cross-system depreciation area and assign the local settings to 
the cross-system depreciation areas.	
1.	
You can define cross-system depreciation areas using this menu path: Financial 
Accounting (New) ➤ Asset Accounting ➤ Transactions ➤ Intercompany Asset 
Transfers ➤ Automatic Intercompany Asset Transfers ➤ Define Cross-System 
Depreciation Areas. The Choose Activity screen pops up with the following 
activities:
•

Capitalization of Assets under Construction (AuC)
An asset can be acquired externally or produced in-house. Assets you produced in-house are often referred 
to as assets under construction (AuC). Assets under construction are a special form of fixed assets; they 
require different accounting treatments and disclosures in the balance sheet. The fixed assets of this nature 
usually fall under two phases: the construction phase and the useful life phase (when the asset is completed 
and put into use). In each of these phases, assets are shown as different items in the balance sheet. The 
transaction of an asset from assets under the construction phase to the useful life phase is referred to as 
capitalization of assets under construction.
In the customizing steps involved in the capitalization of assets under construction, we will look at the 
following activities:
•
Allowing transfer transaction types for asset classes
•
Defining cost elements for settlements to CO receivers
•
Defining/assigning settlement profiles

Allowing Transfer Transaction Types for Asset Classes
In this activity, you carry out the specifications of asset classes for each transaction type group for making 
asset transfer of assets under construction to completed assets. SAP provides the following transaction type 
groups you can specify for asset classes. These transaction type groups and their individual characteristics 
cannot be changed:
15 – Down payment
16 – Down payment balance from previous years
38 – Retirement transfer prior year acquisitions – AuC summary
39 – Retirement transfer current year acquisition - AuC summary
In order to specify the asset classes that allow the system to transfer AuC to completed assets,  
follow these steps:	
1.	
Use this menu path: Financial Accounting (New) ➤ Asset Accounting ➤
Transactions ➤ Capitalization of Assets under Construction ➤ Allow Transfer 
Transaction Types for Asset Classes. The Display View “Transaction Type Group 
Selection”: Overview screen appears, containing the list of transaction type 
groups supplied by SAP.	
2.	
In this step, you will need to perform the specification of asset classes for each 
transaction type group. Select the first transaction type group (15 – Down 
payment) from the displayed transaction groups on the screen and double-click 
the Specification of Asset Classes folder in the Transaction Type Group selection 
on the left pane of the screen. The Change View “Specification of Asset Classes”: 
Overview screen appears.

Determining Cost Elements for Settlements to CO Receivers
To be able to determine cost elements for the settlement of assets under construction to the controlling 
(CO) receivers (i.e., the cost centers), this customizing is important. Controlling is nothing other than 
management accounting. Management accounting is the gathering, analyzing, and interpretation of 
financial data to provide management with information on which to base managerial decisions. It is 
important that you specify the cost element to which the line item of asset under construction is to be settled 
to the CO receivers. A cost center is a function in an organization that incurs its own costs and the cost 
element reconciles cost postings between FI and CO.
You can determine the cost element for settlement to cost receiver using the following procedure:	
1.	
Use this menu path: Financial Accounting (New) ➤ Asset Accounting ➤ 
Transactions ➤ Capitalization of Assets under Construction ➤ Allow Transfer 
Transaction Types for Asset Classes. The Chart of Depreciation Selection screen 
pops up.	
2.	
Specify the chart of depreciation you are using to manage the cost element for 
the settlement to Co receiver by entering your chart of depreciation (B10) in the 
ChDep field. Click the Continue 
 button at the bottom-left side of the screen. 
The Change View “Chart of Accounts”: Overview screen appears showing the 
chart of accounts (INT – Chart of accounts – international) assigned to your chart 
of depreciation.

Defining/Assigning Settlement Profiles (TC: OAAZ)
In this activity, you will be looking at how to define/assign settlement profiles and maintain number ranges 
for settlement documents.
Settlement profiles are defined so you can enter a settlement rule for a sender. A sender is the object or 
the cost center releasing its costs to be settled to the receiver(s). A settlement profile will allow you to settle 
the cost each time to one cost center or G/L account.
The settlement profile you defined in this activity for assets under construction is assigned to your 
company code. During settlement of asset under construction in your company code, the system will 
automatically use this key as a basis for settlement of asset under construction.
To define/assign settlement profiles, you can use these steps:	
1.	
Use this menu path: IMG: Financial Accounting (New) ➤ Asset Accounting ➤
Transactions ➤ Capitalization of Assets under Construction ➤ Define/Assign 
Settlement Profiles. The Choose Activity screen pops up with the following 
options:
•

Fixed Asset Posting
Fixed asset posting is carried out on the user side of the system. Users can post asset acquisitions, asset 
transfers, asset retirements, assets under construction, asset capitalization, reverse documents, etc. in SAP.
Asset Acquisition
The Asset Accounting component supports various business processes, ranging from the acquisition of 
assets and/or the capitalization of products or services produced in-house in the system. Asset acquisition 
can be posted in the system in asset accounting via integration with accounts payable (AP) without reference 
to a purchase order, or via clearing offsetting without reference to accounts payable and without reference 
to a purchase order, or it can be posted in material management (MM), either upon good receipt or invoice 
receipt with reference to the asset.
External Acquisitions
This business process is the purchasing of assets from a business partner. Assets acquired externally can be 
posted in the system in different ways in asset accounting:
•
With the vendor
•
Acquisition with an automatic offsetting entry
Asset Posting with a Vendor (TC: F-90)
This is possible in asset accounting with integration to accounts payable, without reference to a purchase 
order. This function allows you to post the asset acquisition and the associated business partner 
simultaneously in a single transaction. This appears to be the most effective way of posting assets acquisition 
externally.
Follow these steps to post an external acquisition with a vendor:	
1.	
Use this menu path: Accounting ➤ Financial Accounting ➤ Fixed Assets ➤ 
Posting ➤ Acquisition ➤ External Acquisition ➤ With Vendor. The Acquisition 
from Purchase w. Vendor: Header Data screen appears.■
■Note   To avoid having problems posting asset acquisitions, make sure that you have defined the document
number ranges in FI for Documents in Entry View and Documents in General Ledger View for the current fiscal
year. Secondly, you need to specify the amount of authorization for customer/vendor line items in your company
code (7200) for the user group you assigned in FI. We recommend that you refer to our book entitled SAP ERP

Credit Memos
A credit memo is an acceptable systematic way of reducing the original acquisition and production costs of 
an asset. A credit memo may be raised to reduce an invoice amount for a number of reasons. For example, 
goods were accidently damaged, the product or service delivered did not quite meet the standard, etc. 
When a vendor is posted in the system, the bookkeeping treatment is that the asset is debited (increase in 
asset) and the vendor account is credited. When a credit memo is posted, the vendor account is reduced. It’s 
debited with the credit memo and the asset is credited. Credit memos can be posted in the current invoice 
year or in the year after the invoice.

Capitalizing Assets under Construction (AuC)
Assets produced in-house, like normal assets, incur costs at the production stage. Costs of production arising 
from assets produced in-house are capitalized in accounting at the completion of the asset. Assets produced 
in-house go through different phases of production, which are disclosed in the balance sheet. The change of 
an asset from one phase to another during the asset production is referred to as capitalization of AuC.
The AuC master record can be managed in two ways: as a normal asset record or as a master record 
with line item management. An AuC is capitalized and transferred to a completed asset by distribution/
settlement. This will enable the system to use different transaction types to segregate transactions related to 
the current year from the previous years. AuC can be capitalized as a lump sum or with line item settlement. 
Line item settlement allows you to decide which line item to settle at any given time. You may not need to 
necessarily settle all the line items at the same time. Secondly, you can settle some line items completely.■
■Note   To settle an asset to another asset/object, you must assign a distribution rule to the asset master
record.
AuC - Distribute (TC: AIAB)
This is the aspect of AuC component where line item settlement is performed using distribution rules. 
A combination of distribution rules is referred to as distribution rule group. By using a distribution key 
and receiver, you can assign distribution groups to line items. The amount of AuC can be distributed 
systematically using:
•
Percentage rates
•
Equivalent quantities or the amount being settled to respective receivers■
■Note  A receiver is that part of the AuC capitalization that needs to be settled to capitalized assets. On the
other hand, other costs that do need not to be capitalized as part of the asset are treated as expenses and
settled as adjustment postings to respective cost centers on a fiscal year basis.
Use the following steps to distribute AuC:	
1.	
Use this menu path: Accounting ➤ Financial Accounting ➤ Fixed Assets ➤ 
Posting ➤ Capitalize Asset u, Const. ➤ Distribute. The Settlement AuC: Initial 
screen is displayed.	
2.

Transfers
There are two types of asset transfers in the SAP R/3 system:
•
Intracompany transfers (transfers with a company code)
•
Intercompany transfers
Transferring Within a Company Code (TC: ABUMN)
Intra-company transfers are SAP R/3 components that allow you to transfer assets or a part of an asset from 
the sending asset to a different asset (receiving asset) master record within the same company code. Intra-
company asset transfer is possible when one of the following conditions is present:
•
When an asset is mistakenly created in a wrong asset class. Since it is not possible to 
change the asset class in the master record, the only option is to transfer the asset to 
another master record in the same company code.
•
When an asset is split up or a component of the asset is moved to another asset.
•
When an AuC is settled and transferred to a normal asset.

Intercompany Transfers (TC: ABT1N)
Intercompany transfer is when an asset is transferred between two company codes in the same corporate 
group. You can carry out intercompany transfer when one of the following conditions is satisfied:
•
An asset’s location has changed, which means the original asset must be assigned to 
a new company code.
•
Changes in organizational structure have necessitated the change to an original 
asset.

Chapter 7 ■ Customizing Transactions
180■
■Note   In both cases, the system will not allow you to carry out asset assignment to the company codes
involved through master record maintenance. For each asset, you need a new master record in the receiving
company code. For a partial transfer, you need an existing asset.
To perform intercompany transfer, you can use this menu path: Accounting ➤ Financial Accounting ➤ 
Fixed Assets ➤ Posting ➤ Transfer. ➤ Intercompany Asset Transfer.■
■Note   The steps for carrying out an intra-company transfer are similar to the intercompany asset transfer
process.
Since a second company code wasn’t created in this exercise, you will not be able to perform this function. 
Hence, this function is skipped.

Summary
This chapter talked briefly about transactions involved in posting assets and asset acquisitions in asset 
accounting. You then went on to look at how to define transaction types for asset acquisitions, account 
assignment category for asset purchase orders, and how to assign accounts to acquisition transactions. You 
then went on to look at how to define asset retirements at the following asset retirement levels:
•
Assets sold with revenue to a customer and without a customer
•
By scrapping
•
When an asset is sold to an affiliate company
You then learned about the transaction types for retirements as they relate to gain/loss posting. You 
then looked at how to determine posting variants and how to define transaction types for write-ups due to 
gain/loss when an asset is retired.
You learned about asset transfers and learned how to define transaction types for asset transfers. You 
also looked at how to specify variants for asset retirement transfers. You also looked at the steps involved in 
defining cross-system depreciation areas and learned how to assign local assets to cross-system depreciation 
areas. You looked how to capitalize assets under construction (AuC) and how to determine cost elements 
for settlement of the controlling receiver. You then looked at how to define settlement profiles and assign 
settlement profiles to a company code.
Figure 7-24.  Line items display of asset retirement by scrapping

Chapter 7 ■ Customizing Transactions
186
Finally, you looked at how to fix asset posting on the user side of the system. In doing this, you looked 
at how to post assets with vendor and acquisition of assets with automatic offsetting entries. You then went 
on to look at how to post credit memos for asset acquisitions in the current year and in the next year, post in-
house productions, and capitalize assets under construction. In the capitalization of AuC, you looked at how 
to distribute and settle AuC. You also looked at how to reverse the settlement of AuC and how to transfer 
an asset within a company code. Lastly, you went on to look at how to post asset retirements based on asset 
sales with customers, asset sales without customers, and asset retirement by scrapping.
In the next chapter, you will be looking at validation in asset accounting. During the process, you will 
look at the application areas in validation, including how to define validation for posting. Finally, you will 
learn how to customize substitution, by looking at the substitution procedure, and learn how to define

Customizing Validation 
and Substitution
This chapter looks at validation and substitution and the customizing steps involved in the configuration of 
validating and substituting in asset accounting. In this chapter, you learn how to:
•
Define an application area for validation and understand what validation is
•
Define validation for posting
•
Define an application area for substitution and understand what substitution is
•
Define substitution in an accounting document
Validation in SAP
This section first looks at validation in SAP generally and then goes through the practical details of working 
with validation in SAP.
What Is Validation?
Validation is a control component in SAP that allows the system to perform checks on the integrity of the 
data as it’s being entered in the system to ensure that required conditions are met based on the defined 
validation rules. The validation rule is a control mechanism containing the rule manager that carries out 
checks on data entered into certain fields. The rule manager validates the data you enter in certain fields 
according to the defined conditions. If these conditions are not met, the system will issue an error message 
and reject your entry.
You can define validation rules using Boolean logic (which allows you to reduce values of variables to 
true or false). This makes it possible for the system to check the validation rule to ensure it is syntactically 
correct. Validation is maintained in an application area in asset accounting. SAP comes with standard 
validations in the system. You can create your own validation without having to make changes to the

Chapter 8 ■ Customizing Validation and Substitution 
188
standard validations. In SAP, a validation can consist of up to 999 steps. Therefore, it is possible that before 
data is posted in the system, it can be validated against any Boolean statement. You can use a:
•
Prerequisite statement. This statement determines conditions that are met 
before the validation can be carried out. If the prerequisite statement is false, the 
transaction continues without validation.
•
Check statement. Unlike the prerequisite statement, the check statement checks 
whether values entered meet the defined conditions. If the check statement is true, 
the values are accepted and the transaction continues. If the check statement is false, 
the system will issue an error message.
It is possible that you may want to create a user-defined Boolean statement for certain entries in a 
different way not represented by the standard system. You can do this by creating your own validation 
without making changes to the existing standard system. Validations are created and maintained in the 
application areas.
Defining Validations for the Asset Master Data in the Application Area
The application area contains the list of application areas (for example, Asset Accounting, Cost Accounting, 
Financial Accounting, etc.), and this is where the validation, substitution, or rule can be created or 
maintained.
To define validation for your asset master data, you perform the following steps:	
1.	
Use the menu path: Financial Accounting (New) ➤ Special Purpose Ledger ➤
Tool ➤ Maintain Validation/Substitution/Rules ➤ Maintain Validation. The 
Change Validation: Overview screen appears showing the application area and 
the list of application areas where you can define validation.

7.	
Click the Enter 
 button at the top-left side of the screen and save 
 your work.
Now let’s create an asset master record to see how the validation you created works.
Creating an Asset Master Record
To see how validation works, we advise that you create one or more asset master records using asset class 
AS3000 and use a different cost center number instead of the cost center 1100 you specified in the validation 
you created. When you do this, an error message is displayed on the status bar at the bottom of the screen: 
“Asset Class is not valid with cost center”. You will not be able to complete your transaction.■
■Tip   We covered how to create an asset master record in Chapter 6. You can use the steps outlined in
Chapter 6 as a reference.
Substitution in SAP
This section explains what substation is and then steps through its practical applications in SAP.
What Is Substitution?
Substitution, like validation, is a control mechanism with similar structure, but it functions differently from 
validation. When data is entered in the system, the substitution rules check to see if defined conditions are 
met and carry out a substitution. In other words, the substitution rule substitutes the data entered in the 
system by the users with other data, according to the defined substitution rule using the integration manager 
if the specified conditions are met (for example, if A is entered during the transaction, the system should 
substitute it with B). Integration manager uses the conditions in the rule manager to perform substitution. 
Substitution is defined using Boolean logic and the substitution process contains up to 999 steps.
You can define a substitution rule for mass change of assets, when creating assets, changing business 
areas, changing cost centers, and so on, within the asset master data. Before data is posted in the system, the 
values can be substituted using a Boolean statement.
Figure 8-8.  Activating the validation in your company code
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 8 ■ Customizing Validation and Substitution 
197
The Substitution Procedure
The substitution procedure involves the substitution steps containing the following statements:
•
Prerequisite Statement. Determines the conditions that must be fulfilled before 
substitution can be carried out. If the condition is false (i.e. the conditions are not 
satisfied), the transaction is carried out without performing the substitution. If the 
conditions are true (i.e. the conditions are satisfied), the substitution is performed.
•
Substitution Value(s). This could be a numerical value, a string of letters, or a string 
of alphanumeric characters that replace the value for the substitution.
Defining Substitution for Asset Master Data
You define substitution in SAP using Boolean statements. Conditions are linked together in Boolean 
statements using operators (for example, AND and OR). In order to remove the complications involved in 
customizing substitution, you will be working through an example, as depicted in Figure 8-9.
Figure 8-9.  Flow chart diagram depicting the steps involved in defining substitution
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 8 ■ Customizing Validation and Substitution 
198
When an asset is acquired and entered into the system, you want the system to check the defined 
conditions in the Boolean statement (if condition 1 is true, check condition 2; if condition is true, perform 
substitution). For example, if asset acquisition price is >=80,000 (condition 1) and the depreciation key 
=LINS (condition 2), substitute depreciation key with LINA and end.
To define a substitution for asset master data, follow these steps:	
1.	
Use the menu path: Financial Accounting (New) ➤ Special Purpose Ledger ➤ 
Tool ➤ Maintain Validation/Substitution/Rules ➤ Maintain Substitution. The 
Change Substitution: Overview appears, displaying a list of the application area 
on the substitution section of the screen.

Key) of your substitution in the Substitution field.	
5.	
Click the Enter 
 button at the top-left side of the screen for the system to accept 
your entries. You will notice that a folder AA-SUB1 (Purchase price, Depr. Key) is 
created for your substitution on the left pane of the screen for the Master Data.	
6.	
Click the 
 button at the top-left side of the screen. The Substitutable field 
(Class 030) screen pops up with list of substitutable fields you can use.

It is purported that the asset was acquired from an external vendor. It is also 
assumed that the asset is a newly acquired asset. So activate the Asset purch. 
New check box and enter the acquisition year (2015) in the Orig.Acqis.Year field.	
9.	
Finally, click the Deprec. Areas tab to move to the depreciation area of the screen. 
The depreciation key (LINS) and the asset useful life (10) are defaulted by the 
system for each depreciation area from your previous settings. Otherwise, you 
can enter them yourself. Enter the ordinary depreciation start date (01.01.2015) 
in the ODep Start field. This may be defaulted by the system. Otherwise, 
enter them yourself. This is the date you want the system to start calculating 
depreciation for your asset.	
10.	
Click the Enter 
 button and 
 save your master data.
Posting Asset Transactions
Using your discretion, post some transactions with values over 150000 for external acquisition with vendor 
using the asset number 3003 (Machine Z), which you created in the asset master data in asset class (AS3000) 
you used for your substitution.■

This chapter explained what validation is and covered the various Boolean statements that can be used in 
validation. For example, prerequisite statements, check statements, etc. You learned how to define validation 
for asset master data. As part of validation configuration, you looked how to test the validation defined using 
validation simulation. Finally, you learned how to activate validation.
Secondly, you looked at what substitution is. In the process, you looked at the procedure involved 
in defining substitution. You then went on to look at statements involved in substitution, such as the 
prerequisite statement and substitution value(s). You then learned how to define substitution for asset 
master data using Boolean logic/statements and operators like AND and OR. To simplify the complications 
involved in customizing substitution, you saw a flowchart diagram that illustrated how substitution is 
performed. After defining substitution, you performed a substitution simulation to validate if values are true 
or false. You finally looked at how to activate substitution and display substituted fields.
The next chapter looks at information systems by looking at the customizing steps involved in defining 
history sheet versions and history sheet groups. You will be looking at other aspects of information systems, 
like individual assets using asset explorer, and asset balances by performing depreciation comparison and 
manual depreciation. Finally, you will look at the day-to-day activity reports for asset transaction, asset 
acquisitions, and asset retirements.

Reporting with Asset Accounting
This chapter looked at how to customize information systems and generate day-to-day activities reports. In 
this chapter, you learn:
•
What an information system is
•
How to define asset history sheet
•
How to use asset explorer
•
How to display asset balances reports
•
How to create depreciation reports in explanations for profit and loss account 
statement
•
How to generate day-to-day activities report
Information Systems in Asset Accounting
In order for management at varied levels to be able to make decisions concerning the utilization of assets, 
they need to be equipped with some important information in the form of a report. An information system 
provides these needs—such as asset monitoring, controlling, and planning—to meet specific requirements. 
Therefore, an information system is a flexible tool for collecting, analyzing, and evaluating data in FI-AA. In 
SAP, the information system component contains a variety of standard reports that are modifiable to meet 
your reporting needs.
The entire fixed asset portfolio in an organization can be massive. Therefore, when report generation 
can impair the performance of the system, it is recommended that reports be generated using background 
processing. This can be carried out in the selection screen of the report program.
As part of customizing the information system, you will define:
•
Sort versions for asset reports
•
Asset history sheets for asset history sheet versions and asset history sheet groups

Chapter 9 ■ Reporting with Asset Accounting

Sort Versions for Asset Reports
Sort versions are used to determining sorting keys and totaling data records for asset reports. SAP comes 
with standard sort versions that you can use when you run the report. We recommend that you stick to 
the standard sort versions supplied by SAP, instead of creating your own sort version. However, to define 
information systems in asset accounting, you can use this menu path: Financial Accounting (New) ➤ Asset 
Accounting ➤ Information System ➤ Define Sort Versions for Asset Reports.
The Asset History Sheet
Asset history sheet has a vital role as a substitute to the balance sheet from the asset accounting viewpoint. 
Changes in the asset portfolio can be displayed in a history sheet in a given fiscal year. You can define any 
number of history versions in FI-AA. In the asset history sheet configuration, you define the following:
•
Asset history sheet versions
•
History sheet groups
SAP comes with standard asset history sheet versions you can use as is or adapt to meet your 
requirements.
Defining Asset History Sheet Versions
The asset history sheet version defines the format and content of the report. In this step, you define the 
individual asset history sheet versions for your asset history sheet reporting. The asset history sheet is made 
up of up to 99 columns, and from column 00 to column 99, you can enter values for your report. Asset history 
sheet versions are used in report RAGITT01 (the technical name for ABAP report for asset history sheet). The 
report GAGITT01 is for defining asset history sheets according to country-specific requirements and other 
reports relating to asset transactions.
SAP comes with standard history sheet versions such as total depreciation, acquisition values, asset 
history sheet in compliance with EC directive 4, transferred reserves, asset history sheet for Denmark, etc.
The asset history sheet versions supplied by SAP are typically sufficient for this requirement and we 
advise that you stick with them, as they are industry-specific.
To define asset history sheet versions, you can use the following procedure:	
1.	
Use this menu path: Financial Accounting (New) ➤ Asset Accounting ➤ 
Information System ➤ Asset History Sheet ➤ Define History Sheet Versions. The 
Choose Asset History Sheet Version screen appears. It contains the list of asset 
history sheet versions, as shown in Figure 9-1.

history sheet version you want and click the 
 button at the top-left side of the 
screen. The Information screen pops up with the information “Do not change 
objects in the SAP name range”.	
3.	
Click the Continue 
 button at the bottom-right side of the screen. The

■Note   Do not make any changes here, as this may affect the asset history sheet version functionality.
Defining History Sheet Groups
The classification of transaction types for the definition of history sheet groups are carried out by assigning 
them to a history sheet group. SAP delivers the standard transaction type groups relevant for the asset 
history sheet. It is therefore, recommended that you use the standard history sheet groups supplied by 
SAP instead of creating your own. You can define a history sheet group using this menu path: Financial 
Accounting (New) ➤ Asset Accounting ➤ Information System ➤ Asset History Sheet ➤ Define History Sheet 
Groups. The Change View “Asset History Sheet Group and Name” Overview screen appears. It lists the list of 
defined asset history sheet group numbers and names predefined by SAP, as shown in Figure 9-3.

Creating Reports in Asset Accounting
In this activity, you will be looking at how to execute reports for individual assets, asset balances, and day-to-
day activities.
Using Asset Explorer
In individual assets you can use the Asset Explorer for each asset in the system. Asset Explorer shows 
an overview of an asset transactions and comparison values for a number of years, which include APC 
transactions, acquisition value, and planned ordinary depreciation for each depreciation area represented in 
your company code.
You can access the Asset Explorer screen and its information using the following steps:	
1.	
Use this menu path: Accounting ➤ Financial Accounting ➤ Fixed Assets ➤ 
Information System ➤ Reports on Asset Accounting ➤ Individual Assets ➤ Asset 
Explorer. The Asset Explorer screen appears.

Creating an Asset History Report
The asset history sheet has an important reporting function in SAP. From an asset accounting point of view, 
asset history is often seen as an important addenda to the balance sheet in the sense that it shows changes in 
the asset portfolio arising from transactions during the fiscal year. SAP provides standard asset history sheets 
in the system that you can use for your report. You can display asset history sheets using subnumber, asset 
class, or business area. Asset history sheets can be called up as list assets, main number only, or group  
totals only.

Summary
This chapter looked at what information system means in asset accounting. You learned about the steps 
involved in customizing information systems, saw sort versions for asset reporting, and learned how to 
define asset history sheet versions.
Finally, you looked at how to use asset explorer in asset accounting and explored various ways of 
generating reports in asset accounting, such as asset balances and day-today activities reports.
In the next chapter, you will be looking at asset data transfers. As part of asset data transfer 
customization, you will look at how to set company code status, specify a sequence of depreciation areas, 
and define parameters for data transfer with date specifications.

Transferring Asset Data
This chapter introduces you to the basic aspects of asset data transfer and explains how they are configured 
in SAP ERP. You will learn how to:
•
Set company code status
•
Specify sequence of depreciation areas
•
Set parameters for data transfer
Customizing Legacy Data Transfer
When the configuration of Asset Accounting component and the classification of your assets are complete, 
the next step is to carry out legacy data transfer. Legacy data transfer is the transfer of the old asset data 
from the previous system to the SAP system. The asset master records and asset transactions are transferred 
from the fiscal year up to go-live. The transfer of assets transactions does not update the corresponding 
reconciliation accounts in Financial Accounting (balance sheet) automatically. A manual reconciliation is 
carried out later in another step in the balance sheet.
The following options are available in Asset Accounting for transferring legacy data to SAP system:
•
Automatic data transfer
•
Manual online transfer
•
Legacy data transfer using Microsoft Excel
We will only be looking at manual data transfer in this chapter.
The following steps are required as part of the customizing of legacy data transfer:
•
Setting company code status
•
Specifying the sequence of depreciation areas
•
Setting the parameters for data transfer
In this section, we cover each of these steps.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 10 ■ Transferring Asset Data
224
Set Company Code Status
In this customizing step, you will specify the status of asset data transfer in the company code for old  
asset data transfer from the previous system to Sap system. SAP provides four options of status you can 
choose from:
0 - Asset data transfer completed (the specification of this status is important 
after go-live. This allow posting only and no transfer will be carried out).
1 - Asset data transfer not yet completed (this is a transfer status; asset values can 
be changed during transfer, but posting is not possible).
2 - Test company code with data transfer always allowed (this status is a test 
mode; in this company code you carry out data transfer and carry out posting).
3 - Company code deactivated – later reporting allowed (this status when 
specified, you will not be able to perform transfer and posting in this company 
code; only reporting is possible)
In our example, we’ll use 2:

226
Specifying the Sequence of Depreciation Areas
In this activity, you will define the number sequence for each depreciation area in your company code. This 
specification will determine how the asset data transfer transaction are presented in the system. There is 
no hard rule to how this is done. You can use any number sequence of your choice. For example, you can 
use number sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on, or number sequence 2, 4, 6, 8, and so on, for your depreciation 
area sequence. In our example, we used the number sequence 02 for Book depreciation 01, No. 04 for Book 
depreciation 02, No. 06 for Book depreciation 03, No. 8 for Net worth valuation 10, and so on (see Figure 10-3).
It is recommended that you begin your number sequence with the nondependent depreciation areas 
first and the dependent depreciation areas last in your specification. The dependent depreciation areas are 
those depreciation areas which inherit values and depreciation terms from other depreciation areas:

Setting the Parameters for Data Transfer
You will specify the parameters for data for the asset data transfer in this step. The transfer date is simply 
the cut-of date of legacy data. As part of the customizing of parameters for data transfer you perform data 
specifications which includes the transfer date/last closed fiscal year, last period posted in previous system 
(transfer during fiscal year) and other customizing options.
Date specification
Two date settings are specified in relation to time of the old data takeover from the previous system to the 
SAP system:
•
Specify transfer date/last closed fiscal year
•
Specify last period posted in previous system (Trans.during FY)
Specify Transfer Date/Last Closing Fiscal Year
Data transfer is carried out not at the actual date the asset data transfer is performed. It is therefore a 
prerequisite for you to determine the takeover date you want the system to us for the asset data transfer. The 
takeover date you specify will determine the status of the posting the system will use for your asset transfer. 
All postings up to the specified takeover date will be included by the system in your asset data transfer. The 
takeover date includes the last closing fiscal year as well. This specification tells the system you want to carry 
out your asset data transfer during the fiscal year. The transfer of transaction/depreciation posted can be 
performed in the current fiscal year or at the end of the fiscal year without transactions.
In most cases, transfer date is usually at the last day of the fiscal year. If this is not the case, the system 
treats your asset data transfer as transfer during the fiscal year. One of the drawbacks of asset data transfer is 
that the system cannot transfer historical transactions. Only cumulative values are transferred from the end 
of the last fiscal year. The system can also perform transfer of the transactions that took place in the current 
fiscal year, but this is only possible in for transfer during the fiscal year.■
■Note   If the actual asset transfer date for example is 1 January 2015, the go-live date must be one
day later (i.e., 2 January 2015). Go-live is the phase in system implementation to cut over to live productive
operation.
Follow these steps to specify the transfer date and last closing fiscal year:

Specify Last Period Posted in Prv.System (Transf.During FY)
This specification is rarely used in practice. It is only used when you want to carry out an old asset takeover 
during the fiscal year. In this step, you will specify the period in which depreciation was posted in the 
previous system.

Options
Options customizing is part of parameter for data transfer specifications. The specification of options is an 
enhancement to the configuration of asset data transfer. You can specify the following options in SAP Asset 
Accounting:
•
Specify Entry of Net Book Value without accumulated ordinary depreciation
•
Recalculate depreciation for previous years
•
Recalculate base insurable values
•
Recalculate base replacement values
•
Transfer foreign currency areas
Specify Entry of Net Book Value (No Accum. Ordinary Depre.)
You can carry out this specification if the net book values method of asset valuation is used in the previous 
system. Net book value is asset value less depreciation. Historical APC and accumulated depreciation 
method is quite different from net book value method. The transfer of net book value can only be performed 
manually, you will not be able to perform this function using the automatic data transfer (i.e., using batch 
input procedure). Batch input is one of the general methods you can use to transfer bulk data into SAP 
system.
You can perform the specification of entry of net book value, you can use this menu path: Financial 
Accounting (New) ➤ Asset Accounting ➤ Asset Data Transfer ➤ Parameters for Data Transfer ➤ Options ➤ 
Specify Entry of Net Book Value (No Accum. Ordinary Depre.). The Change View “FI-AA: Legacy data 
transfer, entry of net book value”: Overview screen appears, displaying the list of possible company code you 
can specify entry of net book value. Using the 
 button at the bottom left of the screen, search 
for your company code and activate the Enter net book value checkbox. Click the Enter 
 button at the top 
left of the screen and save 
 your specification.
Recalculate Depreciation for Previous Years
This specification allow you to recalculate the accumulated depreciation from the previous years during the 
legacy asset data transfer, based on defined SAP depreciation rules. This is possible when a depreciation 
area is newly entered and the values for a depreciation area need to be recalculated in the system.

You can carry out recalculation based on the condition that the APC was acquired at the time of 
the asset capitalization, whereas the recalculation is only possible for the book depreciation area in the 
company codes that are still in test mode:	
1.	
To carry out the recalculation of depreciation for past years, you can use this 
menu path: Financial Accounting (New) ➤ Asset Accounting ➤ Asset Data

Recalculate Base Insurable Values
This customizing step is necessary only when you want to recalculate base insurable values. The 
specification you carry out will determine if the system should recalculate the base insurable value during 
old asset data takeover.
To carry out base insurable values recalculation, you can use this menu path: Financial Accounting 
(New) ➤ Asset Accounting ➤ Asset Data Transfer ➤ Parameters for Data Transfer ➤ Options ➤ Recalculate 
Base Insurance Values. The change View “FI-AA: Legacy data transf., recalculate base insurance value 
overview screen comes up. This is the screen where you will specify if you want the system to recalculate 
base insurable values during old asset takeover by simply enabling the CumIn.val checkbox on the screen for 
your company code.
Recalculate Replacement Values
This customizing step is necessary if you want the system to calculate new replacement values using the 
index series stored in the system when performing legacy data transfer.
Follow these steps to perform the depreciation area/company code specification which you would want 
the replacement values to be calculated during the legacy asset data transfer:	
1.

with line item management. Line items from the view point of Asset Accounting are the display of asset 
values for each transaction. Line item contains items such as the transaction type, asset value date, posted 
amount, depreciation, proportional value adjustments, and so on. The specification of transaction types for 
transfer of open items is not necessary if you do not have any asset under construction during old asset data 
transfer.

Summary
In this chapter, we introduced you to the basic concepts of asset data transfer and looked at the configuration 
steps involved in asset data transfer. We started by explaining what legacy data transfer is and outlined 
various options available to you when performing Asset legacy data transfer—for example, automatic data 
transfer, manual data transfer, and legacy data transfer using Microsoft Excel. We then went on to look at 
various steps involved in the customizing of legacy data transfer. As part of the customizing process of legacy 
asset data transfer, we taught you how to set company code status, specify sequence of depreciation areas. 
We then looked at the settings involved in the customizing of parameters for data transfer. In so doing, we 
looked at how to specify transfer date/closing fiscal year and the specification last period posted in previous 
system. The next thing we looked at in parameters is the customizing of options such as the specification 
of entry of net book value, the recalculation of depreciation for previous years, the recalculation of base 
insurable values, the calculation of replacement values, the transfer of foreign currency areas, and how to 
define transaction types for transfer of open items.
Finally, we looked at how to configure manual legacy asset data transfer. We taught you how to create, 
change, display, and create a subnumber for legacy asset, both for individual asset and group asset.
In the next chapter, we will be looking at how to set or reset reconciliation accounts, transfer balances, 
and activate company code in production startup.

Chapter 11
Preparing for Production Startup
This chapter looks at the basic steps involved in preparing for production startup that are necessary for your 
SAP system before going live after you have completed your functional requirements and the corresponding 
customizing. In this chapter you will learn how to:
•
Perform consistency checks
•
Set or reset reconciliation accounts
•
Activate company codes
•
Perform an expert overview
Checking Consistency
Once you have completed the technical aspects of your functional configuration and the corresponding 
customization, it is important that you perform check on their consistency. It is recommended that you carry 
out a complete check on your settings by working through all of the previous steps and that you print out the 
settings before production startup. In this step you will carry out consistency overview reports on:
•
Asset classes
•
Charts of depreciation
•
Company codes
•
Depreciation areas
•
Asset G/L accounts
•
FI-AA customizing
In practice, it is necessary to print out all the reports.
To check the plausibility of your system settings, you can use this menu path: Financial Accounting 
(New) ➤ Asset Accounting ➤ Preparing for Production Startup ➤ Check Consistency. The Choose Activity 
screen appears, displaying possible activities that you can carry out, as shown in Figure 11-1.

Production Startup
In production startup, you can determine G/L accounts for transfer balances and set the company code 
status to live production. In this activity, you will perform the following steps:
•
Transfer Balances
•
Activate Company Code
Transferring Balances
In the Transfer balances function, balances can be posted to G/L accounts that are defined as reconciliation 
accounts. You can only make these corrections as long as the company code is not live for Asset Accounting. 
When you transfer legacy data using a legacy asset transaction, the corresponding balances of the 
reconciliation accounts in FI (Financial Accounting) are not affected.
The transfer of asset data to the component Asset Accounting (FI-AA) from a legacy system using the 
legacy data transfer transaction has no influence on the corresponding reconciliation accounts in SAP 
Financial Accounting. This means that there is no automatic creation and reconciliation of balances. The 
system does not automatically perform account reconciliation balances. Instead, reconciliation of balances 
is conducted manually:	
1.	
To proceed to the initial screen where you can perform transfer balance, use 
this men path: Financial Accounting (New) ➤ Asset Accounting ➤ Preparing 
for Production Startup ➤ Transfer Balances. The Enter Transfer Posting: Initial 
Screen appears. The system automatically updates the document date and the 
posting date using the current date, and the period using the accounting period.	
2.	
Enter the company code (7200) you use to make your transfer balances in the 
Company Code field and enter the document type (AA – Asset Posting) in the 
Document Type field. When you click the Enter 
 button at the top left of the 
screen, the Enter Transfer Posting: Transfer Data screen appears. This is the 
screen where you will assign the G/L accounts for the transfer of balances.	
3.	
Specify the G/L account that you want to transfer balances.	
4.	
Click the Enter 
 button at the top left of the screen and save 
 your settings.■
■Note  You can copy balances from any suspense accounts to the FI-AA reconciliation accounts.
Activating Company Code
In this customizing step, you will activate the company code by setting the status to the live indicator (0) 
for the company code from the test phase (2) when you have completed all your legacy data transfer. The 
importance of setting your company code to live indicator is to ensure that the program that deletes test data 
did not delete data from live company codes.■
■Note  Reconciliation accounts for FI are not affected by transfer of legacy data, it is therefore important
to perform account balances reconciliation before you set your company code to live status after legacy
data transfer.

supplied by SAP in the system using the matchcode function.	
4.	
When you have entered the appropriate status in the status field for your 
company code, click the Enter 
 button at the top left of the screen and save 
your settings.
Overview for Experts
Overview for experts provides additional check functions. It does not give you the facility to perform any 
additional customizing functions. Instead, it provides an overview of all of the steps that you carried out in 
when customizing in FI-AA using object or activities approach. You can check the customization that you 
performed in other IMG settings.
Asset Accounting is structured according to functions in SAP to make customizing steps easy to apply. 
However, because most customizing for Asset Accounting is structured systematically based on functions, 
this means that your organization’s requirements are structured according to functions as portrayed by the 
functions in FI-AA component. For example, depreciation areas as a function can be maintained within a 
single IMG node.■
■Note  The overview for experts only offers an integrated approach of viewing the settings you made in
other customizing steps. It does not offer the function that allows you to perform customizing settings.
You can check the customizing settings in other places in FI-AA for the following objects and activities 
in the Overview for experts: Depreciation areas:
•
Real depreciation areas
•
Company code
•
Depreciation areas of company codes
•
Legacy data transfer
•
Account assignments
•
Transaction types
•
Asset classes
In this activity, we will only be checking the settings for depreciation areas and company code settings. 
You can check the remaining settings yourself in your spare time. The steps for checking customizing activity 
is the same.

Processing Periodic Programs
This chapter introduces you to the basic settings or the special programs you need to run in a number of 
applications within SAP ERP at the end of each fiscal year in order to ensure that adequate settings and 
processes relating to the appropriate applications for the following fiscal year is ready for you to work in. You 
will learn how to perform:
•
Depreciation Runs
•
Log for Posting Runs
•
APC Values Posting
•
Asset Fiscal Year Changes
•
Year End Closing
Depreciation Run
Depreciation is part of periodic processing and it is executed at the company code level. Data relating to 
depreciation, such as capitalisation date, useful life, scrap value, value date, and so on are defined in each 
asset master record. Depreciation is run periodically to take care of the calculation of assets depreciation. 
Once a depreciation run is carried out, the system automatically post planned depreciation to the 
corresponding general ledger control accounts. To see how this works, we will post some external asset 
acquisitions.
Posting External Asset Acquisitions
In this section we will post some external asset acquisitions that you will be applying to you’re the 
depreciation run in the next section. To post external asset acquisitions, complete the following steps:

APC Values Posting
Periodic asset posting program allows you to post APC values of depreciation areas that you assigned to the 
chart of depreciation periodically. The benefit of this program is that it allows the system to post the values of 
depreciation areas directly to the general ledger in FI, thereby avoiding the use of batch-input session which 
is now discontinued. During transaction posting, it is possible to update the values of depreciation areas to 
a ledger. The system can update values directly from other depreciation areas including APC values in the 
depreciation areas according to the specifications you made in your customizing definition.■
■Note  Before performing APC Values Posting make sure that:
·
The depreciation area is set to post APC and depreciation periodically to the
general ledger in the chart of depreciation.
·
Account assignments are maintained for each depreciation area.
·
A document type is specified for the periodic posting run.
You can perform APC value posting, using these steps:	
1.	
Use this menu path: Accounting ➤ Financial Accounting ➤ Fixed Assets ➤ 
Periodic Processing ➤ APC Values Posting. The Periodic Asset Posting screen 
appears (Figure 12-8).

Asset Fiscal Year Change
Fiscal Year Change is nothing other than merely changing from the previous calendar year to the current 
calendar year. It is the opening of a new fiscal year in Asset Accounting for a given company code. When you 
perform a fiscal year change, the asset values balance from the old fiscal year are carried forward to the new 
fiscal year. Upon the completion of fiscal year change, you can post asset values both the new and the old 
fiscal year at the same time.■
■Note   The following are some things worth knowing about fiscal year change:
·
When fiscal year changed is carried out, the cumulative asset values from the old
fiscal year are carried forward to the new fiscal year.
·
As long as the year-end closing has not been conducted, you can still make postings
to the old fiscal year.
·
When you start a report in the update mode assets values are carried forward from
the old fiscal year to the new fiscal year. At this junction you can make postings to
the new fiscal year.
·
    A fiscal year change is only carried out for the new fiscal year.
·
You will not be able to post business transactions in the new fiscal year, not until you
have performed fiscal year change.
·
In SAP R/3 you have the option of opening up to a maximum of two fiscal years at
any given point in time.
·
You can only carry out fiscal year change in the last month of the old fiscal year.
·
The asset values carried forward in the fiscal year affected by postings arising from
the old fiscal year are automatically corrected by the system.
·
The system performance can be enhanced by first performing fiscal year change in
test run mode with assets not exceeding 1000 in the foreground, while productive
fiscal year change is carried out in background processing.
·
You may not necessarily need to carry out year-end closing in order to be able to
carry out fiscal year change.
You can carry out fiscal year change, using this menu path: Accounting ➤ Financial Accounting ➤ Fixed 
Assets ➤ Periodic Processing ➤ Fiscal Year Change. The Asset fiscal year change screen appears  
(Figure 12-9).

We will go through a test run first and then make a productive fiscal year change.
Test Run
To complete a test run fiscal year change, complete the following steps:	
1.	
On the Asset fiscal year change screen, update the following fields:
•
Company code(s): Enter your company code (7200) in this field. This is the 
company code you carry out fiscal year change.
•
New fiscal year: Enter the new fiscal year (2015) in this field. This is the year 
after the old (current) year.
•
Test run: Because it is recommended that you first carry out a test run fiscal year 
change, and then activate the test run checkbox. By activating this checkbox, 
this allows you to perform test run. Because the test run is activated, the system 
updates data in the database. This process can be run in the forefront or in 
background.

Year-End Closing
Asset Year End Closing is part of periodic processing in the SAP R/3 system for closing the fiscal year for at 
one or more company codes. In order to ensure that asset values included in the balance are accurate and 
not subsequently charged, it is absolutely imperative to perform a year-end closing. The main function of 
year-end closing is to block prior year values from be included in further depreciation calculations.
Generally, at the end of each fiscal year, it is compulsory that an enterprise produce a report of 
their performance in the form of a balance sheet, Profit and loss statement which is in line with the legal 
requirements of the country in which it operates. To generate an annual financial report including balance 
sheet, profit and loss statement, and notes to the accounts (the additional information relating to the 
financial statement) in the SAP R/3 system, you must first perform a year-end closing procedure.■
■Note   Before executing a year-end closing, you must have completed the following:
·
When a fiscal year is closed, it will no longer be possible to carryout modifications or
post asset values in Asset Accounting for the closed fiscal year.
·
It is recommended first of all to perform a year-end closing in Asset Accounting
before you carry out the year-end closing in FI (General Ledger Accounting).
·
You must carry out fiscal year change first before performing a year-end closing
Figure 12-16.  The status of thefiscal year change carried out

Chapter 12 ■ Processing Periodic Programs
289
·
Before carry out a year-end closing, you must make sure that depreciations have
been completely posted to the appropriate General Ledger in FI and that no error
occurred during the depreciation calculation.
·
You must make sure that all adjustments made to asset values have been completed
and posted.
·
You can only close the previous fiscal year. The current fiscal year must stay open.
Prior to year-end closing, the system carries out some checks make sure that:
•
adjustments to asset value in the asset master record and depreciation calculations 
completed and accurate during posting.
•
planned depreciation from automatic posting areas are posted accurately to the 
appropriate general ledger.
•
depreciation balances that form part of period postings are posted completely and 
accurately to the appropriate general ledger.
•
asset acquired during the period in question are fully capitalized. This check does 
not include assets under construction. It is therefore advisable in the asset class that 
you prevent this check being carried out on asset under construction.
In the event of any error, the system will display an error list and the reasons for those errors in the year-
end closing log.
Performing Account Reconciliation
The account reconciliation function will allow the system to carry out the reconciliation of asset accounting 
balances with the corresponding GL accounts in FI.■
■Note   Here are a few things you need to know before performing account reconciliation:
·
Make sure that before performing this function, the last depreciation for the year
has been completed and posted
·
The report must be performed in background processing only
·
Make sure that no asset posting is made while the report is running
·
Make sure that the report is run before performing the year-end closing.
To carry out a year-end closing account reconciliation, complete these steps:	
1.	
Use this menu path: Accounting ➤ Financial Accounting ➤ Fixed Assets 
➤ Periodic Processing ➤ Year End Closing ➤ Account Reconciliation. The 
Reconcil. Program FI-AA <-> G/L: List of accounts showing differences screen

Executing a Year-End Closing
For the benefit of the financial statement, the execution of a year-end closing is important. A year-end 
closing allows the system to block the recalculation of depreciation values of the previous year fiscal and 
thus avoid the balanced values of fixed assets from the previous year fiscal year being changed.
Once you have executed a year-end closing in the SAP R/3 system, it will no longer be possible to post 
changed values within asset accounting as this function will block the closed year against a depreciation 
recalculation.

Summary
In this chapter we looked at how to perform periodic programs and other special programs needed for 
year-end closing activities. First, we looked at how to execute a depreciation run for each period and how 
depreciations are posted to the appropriate G/L accounts in FI. We looked at how to perform depreciation 
run both in test-run mode and in productive mode respectively. We then looked at how to view the status of 
the depreciation you performed in Job Overview.

Chapter 12 ■ Processing Periodic Programs
294
Second, we looked at the importance of a log for post run for posting depreciation and how the log for 
posting run is carried out. We also briefly talked about APC Values Posting and the checks that you need 
to carry out before performing APC values posting. We then went on to look at the processes involved in 
executing APC values posting.
Third, we explained briefly that we explained what asset fiscal year change is and what happens when 
you carry out fiscal year change. We then took you through the steps involved in executing fiscal year change 
in both test run mode and productive run. We went on to look at how to execute a fiscal year change in 
background processing and how to view the fiscal year change that you have executed.
Finally, we discussed the importance of year-end closing. We learned how to perform account 
reconciliation which is part of year-end closing and how to execute a year-end closing.

Appendix B
Useful Transaction Codes
This appendix includes some of the important transaction codes you can use as a reference in getting to 
a task within the system. Each screen within SAP system is assigned a unique transaction code which you 
can use to navigate a system task within SAP quicker instead of following the conventional navigation menu 
path that uses a tree structure that may be time consuming. You can access a task in the system by entering a 
transaction code into the command field at the top left of the screen.
