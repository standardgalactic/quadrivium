Edward C. Baig writes the weekly Personal Technology column in USA 
TODAY and is co-host of the weekly USA TODAY’s Talking Tech podcast with 
Jefferson Graham. Ed is also the author of Macs For Dummies, 10th Ed. (Wiley 
Publishing). Before joining USA TODAY as a columnist and reporter in 1999, 
Ed spent six years at Business Week, where he wrote and edited stories about 
consumer tech, personal fi nance, collectibles, travel, and wine tasting, among 
other topics. He received the Medill School of Journalism 1999 Financial 
Writers and Editors Award for contributions to the “Business Week Investor 
Guide to Online Investing.” That followed a three-year stint at U.S. News & 
World Report, where Ed was the lead tech writer for the News You Can Use 
section but also dabbled in numerous other subjects. 
Ed began his journalist career at Fortune magazine, gaining the best basic 
training imaginable during his early years as a fact checker and contributor 
to the Fortune 500. Through the dozen years he worked at the magazine, Ed 
covered leisure-time industries, penned features on the lucrative “dating” 
market and the effect of religion on corporate managers, and was heav-
ily involved in the Most Admired Companies project. Ed also started up 
Fortune’s Products to Watch column, a venue for low- and high-tech items.
Bob LeVitus, often referred to as “Dr. Mac,” has written or co-written more

iTunes Book, 3rd Edition, and The Little iDVD Book, 2nd Edition, for Peachpit 
Press. His books have sold more than one million copies worldwide. Bob has 
penned the popular Dr. Mac column for the Houston Chronicle for the past 
ten years and has been published in pretty much every magazine that ever 
used the word Mac in its title. His achievements have been documented in 
major media around the world. (Yes, that was him juggling a keyboard in USA 
TODAY a few years back!) 
Bob is known for his expertise, trademark humorous style, and ability to 
translate techie jargon into usable and fun advice for regular folks. Bob is 
also a prolifi c public speaker, presenting more than 100 Macworld Expo train-
ing sessions in the U.S. and abroad, keynote addresses in three countries, 
and Macintosh training seminars in many U.S. cities. 


Dedications
I dedicate this book to my beautiful wife, Janie, for making me a better person 
every day I am with her. And to my incredible kids: my adorable little girl, 
Sydney (one of her fi rst words was “iPod,”) my little boy, Sammy (who is all 
smiles from the moment he wakes up in the morning), and, of course, my 
“canine” son, Eddie. They all got their hands on the iPhone at one time or 
another. I am madly in love with you all.
— Ed Baig
This book is dedicated to my wife, Lisa, who taught me almost everything 
I know about almost everything except computers. And to my children, 
Allison and Jacob, who love their iPhones almost as much as I love them 
(my kids, not my iPhone).   
— Bob LeVitus

iPhone For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

Introduction
P
recious few products ever come close to generating the kind of buzz 
seen with the iPhone. Its messianic arrival received front-page treat-
ment in newspapers and top billing on network and cable TV shows. People 
lined up days in advance just to ensure landing one of the first units. Years 
from now, people will insist, “I was one of them.”
But we trust you didn’t pick up this book to read yet another account about 
how the iPhone launch was an epochal event. We trust you did buy the book 
to find out how to get the very most out of your remarkable new device.
Our goal is to deliver that information in a light and breezy fashion. We 
expect you to have fun using your iPhone. We equally hope you have fun 
spending time with us.
About This Book
Let’s get one thing out of the way right from the get-go. We think you’re pretty 
darn smart for buying a For Dummies book. That says to us that you have the 
confidence and intelligence to know what you don’t know. The For Dummies 
franchise is built around the core notion that all of us feel insecure about cer-
tain topics when tackling them for the first time, especially when those topics 
have to do with technology.
As with most products coming out of Apple, the iPhone is beautifully 
designed and intuitive to use. And though our editors may not want us to 
reveal this dirty little secret (especially on the first page, for goodness sake), 
the truth is you’ll get pretty far just by exploring the iPhone’s many functions 
and features on your own, without the help of this or any other book.
Okay, now that we spilled the beans, let’s tell you why you shouldn’t run 
back to the bookstore and request a refund. This book is chock-full of useful 
tips, advice, and other nuggets that should make your iPhone experience all 
the more pleasurable. So keep this book nearby and consult it often.
Conventions Used in This Book
First, we want to tell you how we go about our business. iPhone For Dummies, 
2nd Edition, makes generous use of numbered steps, bullet lists, and pic-
tures. Web addresses are shown in a special monofont typeface, like this.

iPhone For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
We also include a few sidebars with information that is not required reading 
(not that any of this book is) but that we hope will provide a richer under-
standing of certain subjects. Overall, we aim to keep technical jargon to a 
minimum, under the guiding principle that with rare exceptions you don’t 
need to know what any of it really means.
How This Book Is Organized
Here’s something we imagine you’ve never heard before: Most books have 
a beginning, middle, and end, and you do well to adhere to that linear 
 structure — unless you’re one of those knuckleheads out to ruin it for 
the rest of us by revealing that the butler did it.
Fortunately, there is no ending to spoil in a For Dummies book. So although 
you may want to digest this book from start to finish — and we hope you 
do — we won’t penalize you for skipping ahead or jumping around. Having 
said that, we organized iPhone For Dummies, 2nd Ed., in an order that we 
think makes the most sense, as follows.
Part I: Getting to Know Your iPhone
In the introductory chapters of Part I, you tour the iPhone inside and out, find 
out how to activate the phone with Apple’s partner in the U.S., AT&T, and 
get hands-on (or, more precisely, fingers-on) experience with the iPhone’s 
unique virtual multitouch display.
Part II: The Mobile iPhone
There’s a reason the iPhone has phone in its name. Part II is mostly about 
all the ways you can make and receive calls on the device. But you also dis-
cover how to exchange text messages and play with the Calendar, Clock, and 
Calculator applications.
Part III: The Multimedia iPhone
Part III is where the fun truly begins. This is the iPhone as an iPod, meaning 
that music, videos, movies, pictures, and other diversions come to life.
Part IV: The Internet iPhone
Part IV covers the mobile Internet. You master the Safari browser, e-mail, 
maps, and more. We discuss the faster 3G or third-generation wireless net-
work that the latest iPhone can tap into. And, speaking of maps, your iPhone 
has the capability to locate your whereabouts through GPS (in the case of the 
iPhone 3G) and other location-tracking methods.

 Introduction
Part V: The Undiscovered iPhone
In Part V, you find out how to apply your preferences through the iPhone’s 
internal settings, how to find and obtain new applications at the iTunes App 
Store, and discover where to go for troubleshooting assistance if your iPhone 
should misbehave.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
The Part of Tens: Otherwise known as the For Dummies answer to David 
Letterman. The lists presented in Part VI steer you to some of our favorite 
iPhone apps, a bevy of terrific iPhone-related Web sites, and last, but not 
least, some handy tips and shortcuts.
Icons Used in This Book
Little round pictures (icons) appear in the left margins throughout this book. 
Consider these icons miniature road signs, telling you a little something extra 
about the topic at hand or really hammering a point home.
Here’s what the four different icons used in this book look like and mean.
 
These are the juicy morsels, shortcuts, and recommendations that might 
make the task at hand faster or easier.
 
This tip emphasizes the stuff we think you ought to retain. You may even jot 
down a note to yourself in the iPhone.
 
Put on your propeller beanie hat and pocket protector; this text includes the 
truly geeky stuff. You can safely ignore this material; but if it weren’t interest-
ing or informative, we wouldn’t have bothered to write it.
 
You wouldn’t intentionally run a stop sign, would you? In the same fashion, 
ignoring warnings may be hazardous to your iPhone and (by extension) your 
wallet. There, you now know how these warning icons work, for you have just 
received your very first warning!
Where to Go from Here
Why straight to Chapter 1, of course, (without passing Go).
In all seriousness, we wrote this book for you, so please let us know what 
you think. If we screwed up, confused you, left something out, or — heaven

iPhone For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
forbid — made you angry, drop us a note. And if we hit you with one pun too 
many, it helps to know that as well.
Because writers are people too (believe it or not), we also encourage posi-
tive feedback if you think it’s warranted. So kindly send e-mail to Ed at 
baigdummies@aol.com and to Bob at iPhoneLeVitus@boblevitus.com. 
We’ll do our best to respond to reasonably polite e-mail in a timely fashion.
Most of all, we want to thank you for buying our book. Please enjoy it along 
with your new iPhone.
Note: At the time we wrote this book, all the information it contained was 
accurate for the original iPhone, the iPhone 3G, and the latest version of 
iTunes. Apple is likely to introduce a new iPhone model or new version of 
iTunes between book editions. If you’ve bought a new iPhone or your version 
of iTunes looks a little different, be sure to check out what Apple has to say 
at www.apple.com/iPhone. You’ll no doubt find updates on the company’s 
latest releases.

Part I
Getting to Know 
Your iPhone

You have to crawl before you walk, so con-
sider this part basic training for crawling. 
The three chapters that make up Part I serve as a 
gentle introduction to your iPhone.
We start out nice and easy in Chapter 1, with a 
big-picture overview, even letting you know 
what’s in the box (if you haven’t already peeked).  
Then we examine just some of the cool things 
your iPhone can do. We ﬁ nish things off with a 
quick-and-dirty tour of the hardware and the soft-
ware, so that you’ll know where things are when 
you need them.
Next, after you’re somewhat familiar with where 
things are and what they do, we move right along 
to a bunch of useful iPhone skills, such as turning 
the darn thing on and off (which is very impor-
tant) and locking and unlocking your phone 
(which is also very important). Chapter 2 ends 
with useful tips and tricks to help you master 
iPhone’s unique multitouch interface so that you 
can use it effectively and efﬁ ciently.
Then, in Chapter 3, we explore the process of syn-
chronization and how to get data — contacts, 
appointments, movies, songs, podcasts, and such — 
from your computer into your iPhone, quickly and 
painlessly.

Unveiling the iPhone
In This Chapter

▶ Checking out the iPhone’s applications
C
ongratulations. You’ve selected one of the most incredible handheld 
devices we’ve ever seen — and one that’s much more than just a great 
wireless phone. Of course, the iPhone is one heck of a wireless telephone, 
complete with a capable 2-megapixel digital camera. But it’s actually three 
awesome handheld devices in one. In addition to being a killer cell phone, 
it’s a gorgeous widescreen video iPod — and the smallest, most powerful 
Internet communications device yet.
In this chapter, we offer a gentle introduction to all three “products” 
that make up your iPhone, plus overviews of its revolutionary hard-
ware and software features.
The Big Picture
The iPhone has many best-of-class features, but perhaps 
its most unusual feature is the lack of a physical keyboard 
or stylus. Instead, it has a 31/2-inch super-high-resolution 
touchscreen (160 pixels per inch if you care about such 
things) that you operate using a pointing device you’re 
already intimately familiar with: your finger.
And what a display it is. We venture that you’ve never seen a 
more beautiful screen on a handheld device in your life.
Another feature that knocked our socks off was the iPhone’s built-in sen-
sors. An accelerometer detects when you rotate the device from portrait to 

8
Part I: Getting to Know Your iPhone 
landscape mode and adjusts what’s on the display accordingly. A proximity 
sensor detects when the iPhone gets near your face, so it can turn off the dis-
play to save power and prevent accidental touches by your cheek. And a light 
sensor adjusts the display’s brightness in response to the current ambient 
lighting situation. (Let’s see your Palm Treo or RIM Blackberry do that!)
In this section, we take a brief look at some of the iPhone’s features, broken 
down by product category.
The iPhone as a phone and a digital camera
On the phone side, the iPhone synchronizes with the contacts and calendars 
on your Mac or PC. It includes a full-featured QWERTY soft, or virtual, key-
board, which makes typing text easier than ever before — for some folks. 
Granted, the virtual keyboard takes a bit of time to get used to. But we think 
What’s in the box
Somehow we think you’ve already opened the 
handsome black box that the iPhone came in. 
But if you didn’t, here’s what you can expect to 
find inside:
 ✓ Stereo headset: Use this headset for music 
videos and, yes, phone calls. The headset 
contains a built-in microphone for making 
yourself heard during phone calls.
 ✓ Dock connector–to–USB cable: Use this 
handy cable to sync or charge your iPhone. 
You can plug the USB connector into your 
PC or Macintosh to sync or plug it into the 
USB power adapter described next.
 ✓ USB power adapter: Use this adapter to 
recharge your iPhone from a standard AC 
power outlet.
 ✓ Some Apple logo decals: Of course.
 ✓ Cleaning cloth: Expect the iPhone to get 
smudges on it. Use the cloth to wipe it 
clean. We’d steer clear of Lemon Pledge.
 ✓ Finger Tips pamphlet: You’ll find handy tips 
from Apple on using the new object of your 
affection.
 ✓ Important Product Information Guide pam-
phlet: Well, it must be important because it 
says so right on the cover. You’ll find basic 
safety warnings, a bunch of legalese, war-
ranty information, and info on how to dis-
pose of or recycle the iPhone. What! We’re 
getting rid of it already? A few other pieces 
of advice: Don’t drop the iPhone if you can 
help it, keep the thing dry, and — as with all 
cell phones — give full attention to the road 
while driving.
 ✓ SIM eject tool: Use this tool instead of a 
bent paper clip in the event you need to 
eject your SIM card.
 
 There’s even a handy diagram showing how 
to use the SIM eject tool inside the little 
black folder the tool is affixed to.
 ✓ iPhone: You were starting to worry. Yes, the 
iPhone itself is also in the box.

 Chapter 1: Unveiling the iPhone
that many of you eventually will be whizzing along at a much faster pace than 
you thought possible on a mobile keyboard of this type.
The 2-megapixel digital camera is accompanied by a decent photo-management 
application, so taking and managing digital photos is a pleasure rather than the 
nightmare it can be on other phones. Plus, you can automatically synchronize 
iPhone photos with the digital photo library on your Mac or PC. Okay, we wish 
the iPhone camera took better photos and could capture video, but it’s still way 
better than no camera at all.
Finally, one of our favorite phone accoutrements is visual voicemail. (Try 
saying that three times fast.) This feature lets you see a list of voicemail 
messages and choose which ones to listen to or delete without being forced 
to deal with every message in your voice mailbox in sequential order. Now, 
that’s handy!
Those are merely a few of the iPhone’s excellent telephony features. Because 
we still have many more chapters to go, we’ll put the phone coverage on hold 
for now (pun intended).
The iPhone as an iPod
We agree with Steve Jobs on this one: The iPhone is a better iPod than almost 
any that Apple has ever made. (Okay, we can quibble about the iPod Touch 
or wanting more storage.) You can enjoy all of your existing iPod content — 
music, audiobooks, audio and video podcasts, music videos, television shows, 
and movies — on the iPhone’s gorgeous high-resolution color display, which is 
bigger, brighter, and richer than any iPod display that came before it.
Bottom line: If you can get the content — be it video, audio, or whatever — 
into iTunes on your Mac or PC, you can synchronize it and watch or listen to 
it on your iPhone.
The iPhone as an Internet communications device
But wait — there’s more! Not only is the iPhone a great phone and a stellar 
iPod, but it’s also a full-featured Internet communications device with — we’re 
about to drop a bit of industry jargon on you — a rich HTML e-mail client that’s 
compatible with most POP and IMAP mail services, with support for Microsoft 
Exchange ActiveSync. (For more on this topic, see Chapter 11.) Also on board 
is a world-class Web browser (Safari) that, unlike other phones, makes Web 
surfing fun and easy.
Another cool Internet feature is Maps, a killer mapping application based on 
Google Maps. By using GPS (3G hardware) or triangulation (on the original 
iPhone), it can determine your location, let you view maps and satellite imag-
ery, and obtain driving directions and traffic information regardless of where 

10
Part I: Getting to Know Your iPhone 
in the United States you happen to be. You can also find businesses such as 
gas stations, pizza restaurants, hospitals, and Apple stores with just a few taps.
You might also enjoy using Stocks, a built-in application that delivers near-
real-time stock quotes and charts any time and any place.
In other words, the Internet experience on an iPhone is far superior to the 
Internet experience on any other handheld device.
Technical specifications
One last thing before we proceed. Here’s a list of everything you need before 
you can actually use your iPhone:
 
✓ An original iPhone or the newer iPhone 3G
 
✓ A wireless contract with AT&T (formerly Cingular)
 
✓ Internet access (required) — broadband wireless Internet access 
 recommended
Plus you need one of the following:
 
✓ A Mac with a USB 2.0 port; Mac OS X version 10.4.10 or later; and 
iTunes 7.7 or later
 
✓ A PC with a USB 2.0 port; Windows Vista or Windows XP Home or 
Professional with Service Pack 2 or later; and iTunes 7.7 or later
A Quick Tour Outside
The iPhone is a harmonious combination of hardware and software, so let’s 
see just what it’s made of. In this section, we take a brief look at what’s on the 
outside. In the next section, we peek at the software.
On the top
On the top of your iPhone, you’ll find the headset jack, the SIM card tray, and 
the Sleep/Wake button, as shown in Figure 1-1:
 
✓ The Sleep/Wake button: This button is used to lock or unlock your 
iPhone and to turn your iPhone on or off. When your iPhone is locked, 
you can still receive calls and text messages but nothing happens if you 
touch its screen. When your iPhone is turned off, all incoming calls go 
directly to voicemail.

11
 Chapter 1: Unveiling the iPhone
 
✓ SIM card tray: The SIM card tray is where you remove or replace the 
SIM card inside your iPhone.
 
 A SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) card is a removable smart card used 
to identify mobile phones. It allows users to change phones by moving 
the SIM card from one phone to another.
 
✓ Headset jack: The headset jack lets you plug in the included iPhone 
headset, which looks a lot like white iPod earbuds. Unlike the iPod ear-
buds, however, the iPhone headset has a microphone so that you can 
talk as well as listen.
 
 The headset jack on the original iPhone is recessed, so most third-
party earphones (such as those made by Shure, Etymotic, and Future 
Sonics) won’t work with it. Starting at around $11, however, you can 
buy an adapter from companies such as Belkin that enables you to use 
just about any brand or style of earphones you like with your iPhone. 
Fortunately, Apple listened to customers. The iPhone 3G doesn’t have a 
recessed headset jack and doesn’t require an adapter.

Figure 1-1: The top side of the iPhone 3G.
On the bottom
On the bottom of your iPhone, you’ll find the speaker, dock connector, and 
microphone, as shown in Figure 1-2:
 
✓ Speaker: The speaker is used by the iPhone’s built-in speakerphone and 
plays audio — music or video soundtracks — if no headset is plugged in. 
It also plays the ringtone you hear when you receive a call.

Figure 1-2: The bottom side of the iPhone 3G.
 
✓ Dock connector: The dock connector has two purposes. One, you can 
use it to recharge your iPhone’s battery: Simply connect one end of the 
included dock connector–to–USB cable to the dock connector and the 
other end to the USB power adapter. Two, you can use the dock connec-
tor to recharge your iPhone’s battery as well as synchronize: Connect 
one end of the same cable to the dock connector and the other end to a 
USB port on your Mac or PC.
 
✓ Microphone: The microphone lets callers hear your voice when you’re 
not using a headset.
On the sides and front
On the front of your iPhone you’ll find the following (labeled in Figure 1-3):
 
✓ Ring/Silent switch: The Ring/Silent switch, which is on the left side 
of your iPhone, lets you quickly switch between ring mode and silent 
mode. When the switch is set to ring mode — the up position, with no 
orange dot — your iPhone plays all sounds through the speaker on the 
bottom. When the switch is set to silent mode — the down position, 
with an orange dot visible on the switch — your iPhone doesn’t make a 
sound when you receive a call or when an alert pops up on the screen.
 
 The only exceptions to silent mode are alarms you set in the built-in 
Clock application, which do sound regardless of the Ring/Silent switch 
setting.
 
 If your phone is set to ring mode and you want to silence it quickly, you 
can press the Sleep/Wake button on the top of the iPhone or press one 
of the Volume buttons.
 
✓ Volume buttons: Two Volume buttons are just below the Ring/Silent 
switch. The upper button increases the volume, the lower one decreases 
it. You use the Volume buttons to raise or lower the loudness of the 
ringer, alerts, sound effects, songs, and movies. And during phone calls, 
they adjust the loudness of the person you’re speaking with, regardless 
of whether you’re listening through the receiver, the speakerphone, or a 
headset.

13
 Chapter 1: Unveiling the iPhone
 
✓ Receiver: The 
receiver is the speaker 
that the iPhone uses 
for telephone calls. 
It naturally sits close 
to your ear whenever 
you hold your iPhone 
in the “talking on the 
phone” position.
 
 You should be the 
only one who hears 
sound coming from 
the receiver. If you 
have the volume set 
above about 50 per-
cent and you’re in a 
location with little 
or no background 
noise, someone 
standing nearby may 
be able to hear the 
sound, too. So be 
careful.
 
 If you require privacy 
during phone calls, 
the included Apple 
headset (or an optional Bluetooth headset — as discussed in Chapter 13) 
is a better bet.
 
✓ Touchscreen: You find out how to use the iPhone’s gorgeous high-
 resolution color touchscreen in Chapter 2. All we have to say at this 
time is . . . try not to drool all over it.
 
✓ Home button: No matter what you’re doing, you can press the Home 
button at any time to display the Home screen, which is the screen 
shown in Figure 1-3.
 
✓ Application buttons: Each of the 18 buttons launches an included 
iPhone application. You’ll read more about these applications later in 
this chapter and throughout the rest of the book.
On the back
On the back of your iPhone is the camera lens. It’s the little circle in the top-
left corner. For more on the camera, see Chapter 9.

Part I: Getting to Know Your iPhone 
Status bar
The status bar, which is at the top of the screen, displays tiny icons that pro-
vide a variety of information about the current state of your iPhone:
 
 
✓ Cell signal: The cell-signal icon tells you whether you’re within range of 
your wireless telephone carrier’s cellular network and therefore can 
make and receive calls. The more bars you see (five is the highest), the 
stronger the cellular signal. If you’re out of range, the bars are replaced 
with the words No service.
 
 If you have only one or two bars, try moving around a little bit. Even 
moving just a few feet can sometimes mean the difference between no 
service and three or four bars.
 
 
✓ Airplane Mode: You’re allowed to use your iPod on a plane after the 
captain gives the word. But you can’t use your cell phone except when 
the plane is in the gate area before takeoff or after landing. Fortunately, 
your iPhone offers an Airplane Mode, which turns off all wireless fea-
tures of your iPhone — the cellular, 3G, GPRS, and EDGE networks, Wi-Fi, 
and Bluetooth — and makes it possible to enjoy music or video during 
your flight.
 
 
✓ 3G: This icon informs you that the high-speed 3G data network from 
your wireless carrier (that’s AT&T in the U.S.) is available and that your 
iPhone can connect to the Internet via 3G.
 
 
✓ GPRS: This icon says that your wireless carrier’s GPRS (General Packet 
Radio Service) data network is available and that your iPhone can use it 
to connect to the Internet.
 
 
✓ EDGE: This icon tells you that your wireless carrier’s EDGE network is 
available and you can use it to connect to the Internet.
 
 
✓ Wi-Fi: If you see the Wi-Fi icon, it means your iPhone is connected to the 
Internet over a Wi-Fi network. The more semicircular lines you see (up 
to three), the stronger the Wi-Fi signal. If you have only one or two semi-
circles of Wi-Fi strength, try moving around a bit. If you don’t see the 
Wi-Fi icon in the status bar, Internet access is not currently available.
 
 Wireless (that is, cellular) carriers may offer one of three data networks. 
The fastest is a 3G data network, which, as you probably guessed, is avail-
able only on the iPhone 3G. The device first looks for a 3G network and 
then, if it can’t find one, looks for a slower EDGE or GPRS data network.
 
 Wi-Fi networks, however, are even faster than any cellular data net-
work — 3G, EDGE, or GPRS. So all iPhones will connect to a Wi-Fi network 
if one is available, even if a 3G, GPRS, or EDGE network is also available.
 
 Last but not least, if you don’t see one of these icons — 3G, GPRS, EDGE, 
or Wi-Fi — then you don’t currently have Internet access.

15
 Chapter 1: Unveiling the iPhone
 
 
✓ Network Activity: This icon tells you that some network activity is 
occurring, such as over-the-air synchronization, sending or receiving 
e-mail, or loading a Web page. Some third-party applications also use 
this icon to indicate network or other activity.
 
 
✓ VPN: This icon shows that you are currently connected to a virtual pri-
vate network (VPN).
 
 
✓ Lock: This icon tells you when your iPhone is locked. See Chapter 2 for 
information on locking and unlocking your iPhone.
 
 
✓ Play: This icon informs you that a song is currently playing. You find out 
more about playing songs in Chapter 7.
 
 
✓ Alarm: This icon tells you that you have set one or more alarms in the 
Clock application.
 
 
✓ Bluetooth: This icon indicates the current state of your iPhone’s Bluetooth 
connection. If it’s blue, Bluetooth is on and a device (such as a wireless 
headset or car kit) is connected. If the icon is gray, Bluetooth is turned 
on but no device is connected. If you don’t see a Bluetooth icon at all, 
Bluetooth is turned off. Chapter 13 goes into more detail about Bluetooth.
 
 
✓ Bluetooth Headset battery: This icon displays the battery level for your 
optional Apple iPhone Bluetooth headset (S.R.P. $99) if you have one and 
it’s currently paired with your iPhone.
 
 
✓ Battery: This icon reflects the level of your battery’s charge. It’s com-
pletely filled with green when your battery is fully charged, and then 
empties out as your battery becomes depleted. You’ll see a lightning 
bolt inside it when your iPhone is recharging.
 
 
✓ TTY: This icon informs you that your iPhone is set up to work with a 
teletype (TTY) machine for those who are hearing- or speech-impaired.
 
 You need an optional Apple iPhone TTY Adapter (SRP $19) to connect 
your iPhone to a TTY machine.
The iPhone’s Elegant Eighteen
Tap the Home button at any time to summon your iPhone’s Home screen. The 
Home screen offers 18 icons by default, each representing a different built-in 
application or function. Because the rest of the book covers each and every one 
of these babies in full and loving detail, we merely provide brief descriptions here.
 
Three steps let you rearrange icons on your iPhone:
 
1. Press and hold any icon until all of the icons begin to “wiggle.”
 
2. Drag the icons around until you’re happy with their positions.
 
3. Press the Home button to save your arrangement and stop “wiggling.”

16
Part I: Getting to Know Your iPhone 
If you haven’t rearranged your icons, you’ll see the following applications on 
your Home screen, starting at the top left:
 
✓ Text: The Text application lets you exchange text messages with almost 
any other cell phone user. We’ve used a lot of mobile phones in our day 
and this application is as good as it gets.
 
✓ Calendar: No matter what calendar program you prefer on your PC or 
Mac (as long as it’s iCal, Microsoft Entourage, or Microsoft Outlook), 
you can synchronize events and alerts between your computer and your 
iPhone. Create an event on one and it’s automatically synchronized with 
the other the next time they’re connected. Neat stuff.
 
✓ Photos: This application is the iPhone’s terrific photo manager. You can 
view pictures that you take with the iPhone’s built-in camera or photos 
transferred from your computer. You can zoom in or out, create slide-
shows, e-mail photos to friends, and much more. Other phones may let 
you take pictures; the iPhone lets you enjoy them in many ways.
 
✓ Camera: Use this application when you want to shoot a picture with the 
iPhone’s 2-megapixel camera.
 
✓ YouTube: This application lets you watch videos from the popular 
YouTube Web site. You can search for a particular video or browse 
through thousands of offerings. It’s a great way to waste a lot of time.
 
✓ Stocks: If you follow the market, this application lets you monitor your 
favorite stocks, which are updated in near-real time.
 
✓ Maps: This application is among our favorites. View street maps or satel-
lite imagery of locations around the globe, or ask for directions, traffic 
conditions, or even the location of a nearby pizza joint.
 
✓ Weather: This application monitors the six-day weather forecast for as 
many cities as you like.
 
✓ Clock: This program lets you see the current time in as many cities as 
you like, set one or more alarms for yourself, and use your iPhone as a 
stopwatch or a countdown timer.
 
✓ Calculator: The Calculator application lets you perform addition, sub-
traction, multiplication, and division. Period.
 
✓ Notes: This program lets you type notes while you’re out and about. You 
can send the notes to yourself or anyone else through e-mail or just save 
them on your iPhone until you need them.
 
✓ Settings: Use this application to adjust your iPhone’s settings. If you’re 
a Mac user, think System Preferences; if you’re a Windows person, think 
Control Panel.

17
 Chapter 1: Unveiling the iPhone
 
✓ iTunes: Tap here to access the iTunes Wi-Fi Music Store where you can 
browse, preview, and purchase songs, albums, and more.
 
✓ App Store: This icon enables you to connect to and search the iTunes 
App Store for iPhone applications you can purchase or download for 
free over Wi-Fi or cellular data network connection.
 
✓ Phone: Tap this application icon to use the iPhone as a phone. What a 
concept!
 
✓ Mail: This application lets you send and receive e-mail with most POP3 
and IMAP e-mail systems.
 
✓ Safari: Safari is your Web browser. If you’re a Mac user, you know that 
already; if you’re a Windows user, think Internet Explorer on steroids.
 
✓ iPod: Last but not least, this icon unleashes all the power of a video iPod 
right on your phone.
Okay, then. Now that you and your iPhone have been properly introduced, 
it’s time to turn it on, activate it, and actually use it. Onward!

B
y now you know that the iPhone is very different from other cell 
phones. If you got caught up in the initial iPhone frenzy of 2007, you 
may have plotted for months about how to land one. After all, the iPhone 
quickly emerged as the ultimate fashion phone. And the chic device hosted 
a bevy of cool features. (Keep reading this book for proof.)
To snag the very first version, you may have saved up your pennies 
or said, “The budget be damned.” Owning the hippest and most-
hyped handset on the planet came at a premium cost compared 
with rival devices.
Something else was different about the iPhone purchasing 
experience in 2007: the way it was activated. No salesper-
son was going to guide you through the process, whether 
you picked up your newly prized possession in an Apple 
retail store, an AT&T retail store, or on the Web. Instead, 
you had to handle activation solo, in the comfort of your 
own home.
Unless you were among those people who experienced acti-
vation hiccups in the days soon after the phone was released in 
June 2007, the process of getting up to speed with the iPhone was 
(for the most part) dirt simple and fun — as it is with most products 
with an Apple pedigree.
Well, forget all that has gone before. You no longer have 
to break the bank. Apple has lowered the price — a lot.

As of this writing, the cheapest iPhone starts at $199 — 
$400 below its stratospheric launch price. (Though we are obliged to point 
out that AT&T’s monthly service plans are higher — thus eliminating the cost 
savings over the course of the required two-year contract.)
Something else has changed — the way you activate the phone. Kindly read on.
Activating the iPhone
You’re now supposed to activate the iPhone in the Apple or AT&T Wireless 
store where you bought the thing, just as you do with other cell phones. 
You’ll choose your desired monthly bucket of voice minutes and SMS or text 
messages.
If you’re already an AT&T subscriber, the salesperson will give you the 
option of keeping your current phone number.
 
It’s not surprising why Apple and AT&T want you in their stores: After they 
get you in the door, they have the opportunity to sell you other stuff. And 
they can help crack down on those techies who want to unlock or “jailbreak” 
the iPhone to defect to a rival carrier.
Otherwise, this time around, the same two prerequisites for enjoying the 
iPhone are in place as with the original release — at least for U.S. customers. 
First, there’s the aforementioned business of becoming an AT&T (formerly 
Cingular) subscriber, unless you’re already in the fold. You’ll have to ink 
that new two-year term. If you’re in the middle of a contract with a rival car-
rier, read the sidebar titled “The Great Escape: Bailing out of your wireless 
 contract.”
Second, make sure you download the latest version of iTunes software onto 
your PC or Mac. Apple doesn’t supply the software in the box, so head to 
www.apple.com/itunes if you need to fetch a copy, or launch your current 
version of iTunes and then choose Check for Updates. You can find it under 
the Help menu on a Windows machine and on the iTunes menu on a Mac.
For the uninitiated, iTunes is the nifty Apple jukebox software that iPod 
owners and many other people use to manage music, videos, and more. 
iTunes is at the core of the iPhone as well, because an iPod is built into the 
iPhone. You’ll employ iTunes to synchronize a bunch of stuff on your com-
puter and iPhone: contacts, calendars, e-mail accounts, bookmarks, photos, 
videos, and (of course) music.
We get into all that syncing business in Chapter 3.

 Chapter 2: iPhone Basic Training
Turning the iPhone On and Off
Apple has taken the time to partially charge your iPhone, so you’ll get some 
measure of instant gratification. After taking it out of the box, press and hold 
the Sleep/Wake button on the top-right edge. (Refer to Chapter 1 for the loca-
tion of all buttons.) The famous Apple logo should show up on your screen, 
followed a few seconds later by a stunning image of Earth.
Not so subtle, as messages go: Apple has ambitious aspirations about captur-
ing global market share.
The Great Escape: Bailing out of your
wireless contract
In most instances, a wireless provider will sell 
you a deeply discounted phone or even issue 
you a free model. But there’s one expensive 
catch: You’re subject to hefty termination fees 
if you bail out of your (typical) two-year contract 
early.
The iPhone is one Cingular . . . make that 
AT&T . . . sensation (bad pun intended), so you’ll 
have to wave sayonara to Sprint, Verizon, or other 
carriers if you want this device. But breaking a 
cell phone contract is not easy, and some of the 
options for doing so may not be quite the outs you 
had in mind: You can enlist in the military, move 
overseas, even die. (Sorry, but no guarantee that 
AT&T’s coverage, 3G or otherwise, will reach the 
heavens.)
Fortunately, there are other strategies, although 
none are assured of working:
 ✓ Complain loudly and often: If you’ve been 
having problems with your existing carrier, 
contact the phone company and tell them 
how lousy your coverage is. Document your 
complaints in writing and be as specific 
as possible about spots where your calls 
drop out.
 ✓ Keep an eye out for price hikes: If the car-
rier ups rates dramatically on text messag-
ing, say, you may have a legal out in your 
contract. The Consumerist.com Web site 
advises you to read any notices of changes 
to your Terms of Service that come your 
way. These may void the original agreement 
and you’ll have about a month to cancel 
your contract.
 ✓ Use online matchmaking: Sites such as 
www.celltradeusa.com and www.
cellswapper.com are in the business of 
matching users who want to get out of their 
contract with other folks who are seeking a 
bargain. The person trying to ditch a contract 
pays a modest fee to these sites. So what’s 
the motivation for the person who takes the 
contract off your hands? Those who get their 
phone service this way need not pay an acti-
vation fee to the carrier, and they incur no 
long-term commitment of their own.
 ✓ Roam, roam on the range: If you keep using 
your phone outside your carrier’s network, it 
may become uneconomical for them to want 
to keep you. That’s because your phone com-
pany picks up expensive roaming charges.

Part I: Getting to Know Your iPhone 
To turn the device completely off, press and hold the Sleep/Wake button 
again until a red arrow appears at the top of the screen. Then drag the arrow 
to the right with your finger. Tap Cancel if you change your mind.
Locking the iPhone
Carrying a naked cell phone in your pocket is asking for trouble. Unless the 
phone has some locking mechanism, you may inadvertently dial a phone 
number. Try explaining to your boss why he or she got a call from you at 4 
a.m. Fortunately, Apple makes it a cinch to lock the iPhone so this scenario 
won’t happen to you.
In fact, you don’t need to do anything to lock the iPhone; it happens automat-
ically, as long as you don’t touch the screen for a minute.
Can’t wait? To lock the iPhone immediately, press the Sleep/Wake button. To 
unlock it, press the Sleep/Wake button again. Or press the Home button on the 
front of the screen. Either way, the on-screen slider appears but your iPhone 
doesn’t actually awaken until you drag the slider to the right with your finger.
By now, you’re picking up on the idea that your fingers play an instrumental 
role in controlling your iPhone. We talk more about the responsibility your 
digits have later in this chapter.
Mastering the Multitouch Interface
Virtually every cell phone known to mankind has a physical (typically plastic) 
dialing keypad, if not also a more complete QWERTY-style keyboard, to bang 
out e-mails and text messages. The iPhone dispenses with both. Apple is once 
again living up to an old company advertising slogan to “Think Different.”
Indeed, the iPhone removes the usual physical buttons in favor of a so-called 
multitouch display. It is the heart of many things you do on the iPhone, and 
the controls change depending on the task at hand.
Unlike other phones with touchscreens, don’t bother looking for a stylus. 
You are meant, instead — at the risk of lifting another ancient ad slogan — to 
“let your fingers do the walking.”
It’s important to note that there are actually a half-dozen keyboard layouts in 
English, all variations on the alphabetical keyboard, the numeric and punc-
tuation keyboard, and the more punctuation and symbols keyboard. These 
six keyboards are shown in Figure 2-1. The layout you see depends on the 
application you are working in. For instance, the keyboards in Safari differ 
from the keyboards in Notes.

Part I: Getting to Know Your iPhone 
The iPhone keyboard contains five keys that don’t actually type a character: 
Shift, Toggle, International keyboard, Delete, and Return:
 
✓ Shift key: If you’re using the alphabetical keyboard, the Shift key 
switches between uppercase and lowercase letters. If you’re using either 
of the other two keyboards, pressing Shift switches to the one you’re not 
currently using.
 
 To turn on Caps Lock and type in all caps, you first need to enable Caps 
Lock. You do that by tapping the Settings icon, then tapping General, 
and then tapping Keyboard. Tap the Enable Caps Lock item to turn it 
on. Once the Caps Lock setting is enabled (it’s disabled by default), you 
double-tap the Shift key to turn on Caps Lock. (The Shift key turns blue 
whenever Caps Lock is on.) Tap the Shift key again to turn off Caps Lock. 
To disable Caps Lock completely, just reverse the process by turning off 
the Enable Caps Lock setting (tap Settings, General, Keyboard).
 
✓ Toggle key: Switches between the different keyboard layouts.
 
✓ International keyboard key: Only shows up if you’ve turned on an inter-
national keyboard, as explained in the sidebar below.
 
✓ Delete key: Erases the character immediately to the left of the cursor.
 
 If you hold down the Delete key for a few seconds, it begins erasing 
entire words rather than individual characters.
 
✓ Return key: Moves the cursor to the beginning of the next line.
The incredible, intelligent, and virtual 
iPhone keyboard
Before you consider how to actually use the keyboard, we’d like to share a bit 
of the philosophy behind its so-called intelligence. Knowing what makes this 
keyboard smart will help you make it even smarter when you use it:
 
✓ It has a built-in English dictionary that even includes words from today’s 
popular culture.
 
✓ It adds your contacts to its dictionary automatically.
 
✓ It uses complex analysis algorithms to predict the word you’re trying to 
type.
 
✓ It suggests corrections as you type. It then offers you the suggested 
word just below the misspelled word. When you decline a suggestion 
and the word you typed is not in the iPhone dictionary, the iPhone adds 
that word to its dictionary and offers it as a suggestion if you mistype 
the word in the future.
 
 Remember to decline suggestions (by tapping the characters you 
typed as opposed to the suggested words that appear beneath what 
you’ve typed), as doing so helps your intelligent keyboard become even 
smarter.

25
 Chapter 2: iPhone Basic Training
A keyboard for all borders
Apple continues to expand the iPhone’s reach 
globally. English isn’t the primary language 
for many overseas customers, if they speak 
English at all. Fortunately, Apple doesn’t take 
a parochial approach with iPhone. As part of 
iPhone 3G and version 2.0 of iPhone software, 
the company now supplies international key-
board layouts for 21 languages as of this writ-
ing. To access a keyboard that isn’t customized 
for Americanized English, tap Settings, General, 
Keyboard, and International Keyboards — and 
then flick through the list to select any keyboard 
you want to use. (Alternatively, tap Settings, 
General, International, and Keyboard.) Up 
pops the list shown in the figure included here, 
with custom keyboards for Korean, German, 
Japanese, Spanish, Russian, and numerous 
other languages. Apple even supplies two 
versions of Portuguese to accommodate cus-
tomers in Brazil and Portugal, two versions 
of French (including a keyboard geared to 
Canadian users), and two versions of Chinese. 
Heck, there’s even a U.K. version of English.
Have a multilingual household? You can select 
as many of these international keyboards as you 
might need by tapping the language in the list so 
that the On button appears in blue. Of course, 
you can call upon only one at a time. So when 
you’re inside an application that summons a 
keyboard, tap the little international keyboard 
button sandwiched between the toggle and 
space keys (refer back to Figure 2-1) until the 
keyboard you want to call on for the occasion 
shows up. Tap again to pick the next keyboard 
on the corresponding list of international key-
boards that you turned on in Settings. If you 
keep tapping, you come back to your original 
English keyboard.
One more note about the Chinese keyboards: 
You can use handwriting character recognition 
for simplified and traditional Chinese, as shown 
here. Just drag your finger in the box provided, 
as shown here. We make apologies in advance 
for not knowing what the displayed characters 
here mean (neither one of us speaks Chinese).

✓ It reduces the number of mistakes you make as you type by intelligently and 
dynamically resizing the touch zones for certain keys. You can’t see it, but it 
is increasing the zones for keys it predicts might come next and decreasing 
the zones for keys that are unlikely or impossible to come next.
Training your digits
Rice Krispies has Snap! Crackle! Pop! Apple’s response for the iPhone is Tap! 
Flick! and Pinch! Yikes, another ad comparison.
Fortunately, tapping, flicking, and pinching are not challenging gestures, so 
you’ll be mastering many of the iPhone’s features in no time:
 
✓ Tap: Tapping serves multiple purposes, as will become evident through-
out this book. You can tap an icon to open an application from the Home 
screen. Tap to start playing a song or to choose the photo album you 
want to look through. Sometimes you will double-tap (tapping twice in 
rapid succession), which has the effect of zooming in (or out) of Web 
pages, maps, and e-mails.
 
✓ Flick: Just what it sounds like. A flick of the finger on the screen itself 
lets you quickly scroll through lists of songs, e-mails, and picture thumb-
nails. Tap on the screen to stop scrolling, or merely wait for the scrolling 
list to stop.
 
✓ Pinch/spread: Place two fingers on the edges of a Web page or picture 
to enlarge the images or make them smaller. Pinching and spreading (or 
what we call un-pinching) are cool gestures that are easy to master and 
sure to wow an audience. If you need practice, visit the Apple iPhone 
blogs at
 
www.theiphoneblogs.com/2007/01/12/practice-your-apple-
iphone-pinch/
The Home screen we discuss back in Chapter 1 may not be the only screen 
of icons on your phone. After you start adding apps from the iTunes App 
Store (which you discover in Chapter 14), you may see two or more tiny dots 
between the Phone, Mail, Safari, and iPod icons and the row of icons directly 
above them. Those dots denote additional screens, each containing up to 16 
additional icons. To navigate between screens, either flick from right to left 
or left to right across the middle of the screen or tap directly on the dots.
 
You must be very precise, or you’ll open one of the application icons instead 
of switching screens.

27
 Chapter 2: iPhone Basic Training
Fingers or thumbs?
There is one last thing: Should you use your fin-
gers or thumbs to type? The answer is: Both. It 
seems somewhat easier to hold the iPhone in 
your non-dominant hand (that is, your left hand 
if you’re right-handed or vice versa) and type 
with the index finger of your dominant hand, 
especially when you’re first starting out with the 
iPhone. And that’s what we suggest you try first.
Later, when you get the hang of typing with one 
index finger, you can try to speed things up by 
using both hands. There are two possible ways 
you can do that:
 ✓ Set the iPhone on a sturdy surface (such 
as a desk or table) and tap with both index 
fingers. Some users prefer this technique. 
But you can’t easily use it when you’re 
standing up with no sturdy surface of the 
proper height available.
 ✓ Cup the iPhone with both hands and type 
with both thumbs. This technique has the 
advantage of being possible in almost any 
situation with or without a sturdy surface. 
The downside is that your thumbs are bigger 
than your fingers so it takes more practice 
to type accurately with them — and if you 
have larger than average thumbs, well, 
you’re flirting with trouble.
Which is better? Don’t ask us — try it both ways 
and use the method that feels the most com-
fortable or lets you type with the best accuracy. 
Better still, master both techniques and use 
whichever is more appropriate at the time.
The number of dots you see represents the current number of screens on 
your iPhone. The dot that’s all white denotes the screen you’re currently 
viewing. Finally, the four icons in the last row — Phone, Mail, Safari, and 
iPod — are in a special part of the screen known as the dock. When you 
switch from screen to screen as described above, these icons remain on the 
screen. In other words, only the first 16 icons on the screen change when 
you move from one screen to another.
Finger-typing
Apple’s multitouch interface just might be considered a stroke of genius. And 
it just might as equally drive you nuts, at least initially.
If you’re patient and trusting, you’ll get the hang of finger-typing in a week or 
so. (We’ve gotten pretty good at it.) You have to rely on the virtual keyboard 
that appears when you tap a text field to enter notes, compose text messages, 
type the names of new contacts, and so forth.
 
Apple’s own recommendation — with which we concur — is to start typing 
with just your index finger before graduating to two thumbs.

28
Part I: Getting to Know Your iPhone 
As we’ve already noted, Apple has built a lot 
of intelligence into its virtual keyboard, so 
it can correct typing mistakes on the fly and 
take a stab at predicting what you’re about 
to type next. The keyboard isn’t exactly 
Nostradamus, but it does a pretty good job 
in coming up with the words you have in 
mind.
As you press your finger against a letter or 
number on the screen, the individual key 
you press gets bigger and practically jumps 
off the screen, as shown in Figure 2-2. That 
way, you know that you struck the correct 
letter or number.
  Sending a message to an overseas pal? Keep 
your finger pressed against a vowel, and a 
row of keys showing variations on the letter 
for foreign alphabets pops up, as shown in 
Figure 2-3. This lets you add the appropri-
ate accent mark. Just slide your finger until 
the key with the relevant accent mark is 
pressed.
Meanwhile, if you press and hold the .com 
key in Safari, it offers you the choice of .com, 
.net, .edu or .org. Pretty slick stuff.
Alas, mistakes are common at first. Say that 
you meant to type a sentence in the Notes 
application that reads, “I am typing a bunch 
of notes.” But because of the way your fingers 
struck the virtual keys, you actually entered 
“I am typing a bunch of npyrs.” Fortunately, 
Apple knows that the o you meant to press 
is next to the p that showed up on the key-
board, just as t and y and the e and the r are 
side by side. So the software determines that 
notes was indeed the word you had in mind 
and places it in red under the suspect word, 
as shown in Figure 2-4. To accept the sug-
gested word, merely tap the Space key. And 
if for some reason you actually did mean to 
type npyrs instead, tap on the suggested word 
(notes in this example) to decline it.
Figure 2-3: Accenting your letters.
Figure 2-2: The ABCs of virtual typing. 

29
 Chapter 2: iPhone Basic Training
 
Because Apple knows what you’re up to, the 
virtual keyboard is fine-tuned for the task at 
hand. If you’re entering a Web address, for 
example, the keyboard inside the Safari Web 
browser (see Chapter 10) includes dedicated 
period, forward slash, and .com keys but no 
Space key. If you’re using the Notes applica-
tion (see Chapter 5), the keyboard does have 
a Space key. And if you’re composing an 
e-mail message, a dedicated @ key pops up 
on the keyboard.
 
When you’re typing notes or sending e-mail 
and want to type a number, symbol, or 
punctuation mark, you have to tap the 123 
key to bring up an alternative virtual key-
board. Tap the ABC key to return to the first 
keyboard. It’s not hard to get used to, but 
some may find this extra step irritating.
 
See Chapter 18 for a great tip (Do the Slide 
for Accuracy and Punctuation) that demon-
strates a slick trick for avoiding the extra 
step involved in moving between the 123 
and ABC keys. The technique takes a bit of 
practice, but it reduces the irritation and is 
worth learning sooner rather than later.
Editing mistakes
It’s a good idea to type with reckless aban-
don and not get hung up over the characters 
you mistype. Again, the self-correcting key-
board will fix many errors. That said, plenty 
of typos will likely turn up, especially in the 
beginning, and you’ll have to make correc-
tions manually.
 
A neat trick for doing so is to hold your 
finger against the screen to bring up the 
magnifying glass shown in Figure 2-5. Use 
it to position the pointer to the spot where 
you need to make the correction.
There — you’ve survived basic training. 
Now the real fun is about to begin.

you out.

and from Your iPhone
In This Chapter
▶ Starting your first sync
▶ Disconnecting during a sync
▶ Synchronizing contacts, calendars, e-mail accounts, and bookmarks
▶ Synchronizing ringtones, music, podcasts, video, photos, and applications
W
hen you have passed basic training (in Chapter 2), the next thing 
you’re likely to want to do is get some or all of your contacts, 
appointments, events, mail settings, bookmarks, ringtones, music, movies, 
TV shows, podcasts, photos, and applications into your iPhone.
We have good news and . . . more good news. The good news is 
that you can easily copy any or all of those items from your 
computer to your iPhone. And the more good news is that 
once you do that, you can synchronize your contacts, 
appointments, and events so they’re kept up-to-date auto-
matically in both places — on your computer and your 
iPhone — whenever you make a change in one place or 
the other. So when you add or change an appointment, an 
event, or a contact on your iPhone, that information auto-
matically appears on your computer the next time your 
iPhone and computer communicate.
This communication between your iPhone and computer is 
called syncing (short for synchronizing). Don’t worry: It’s easy, 
and we’re going to walk you through the entire process in this 
chapter.
But wait. There’s even more good news. Items you manage on your com-
puter, such as music, movies, TV shows, podcasts, photos, and e-mail 
account settings, are synchronized only one way: from your computer to 
your iPhone, which is the way it should be.

Part I: Getting to Know Your iPhone 
Starting to Sync
Synchronizing your iPhone with your computer is a lot like syncing an iPod 
with your computer. If you’re an iPod user, the process will be a piece of 
cake. But it’s not too difficult even for those who’ve never used an iPod:
 
1. Start by connecting your iPhone to your computer with the USB cable 
that came with your iPhone.
 
 When you connect your iPhone to your computer, iTunes should launch 
automatically. If it doesn’t, chances are you plugged the cable into a USB 
port on your keyboard, monitor, or hub. Try plugging it into one of the 
USB ports on your computer instead. Why? Because USB ports on your 
computer supply more power to a connected device than USB ports on a 
keyboard, monitor, or most hubs.
 
 If iTunes still doesn’t launch automatically, try launching it manually.
 
 One last thing: If you’ve taken any photos with your iPhone since the 
last time you synced it, your photo-management software (iPhoto on the 
Mac; Adobe Photoshop Album or Elements on the PC) will launch and 
ask whether you want to import the photos from your phone. (You find 
out all about this later in the chapter.)
 
2. Select your iPhone in the iTunes source list.
 
 You see the Set Up Your iPhone pane, as shown in Figure 3-1. If you’ve 
already set up and named your iPhone, you can skip steps 3 and 4a and 
start with Step 4b.
 
 If you don’t see an iPhone in the source list, and you’re sure it’s con-
nected to a USB port on your computer (not the keyboard, monitor, or 
hub), restart your computer.
 
 
iPhone selected in source list
 
 
Figure 3-1: This is the first thing you see in iTunes.

33
 Chapter 3: The Kitchen Sync: Getting Stuff to and from Your iPhone
 
3. Name your iPhone.
 
 We’ve named this one Lisa’s iPhone.
 
4a. Decide whether you want iTunes to automatically synchronize your 
iPhone and your contacts, calendars, e-mail accounts, and bookmarks.
 
• If that’s what you want, click the check box next to Automatically 
Sync Contact, Calendars, Email Accounts, and Bookmarks to make 
a check mark appear. Then click the Done button and continue 
with the “Synchronizing Your Media” section later in this chapter.
 
• If you want to synchronize manually, make sure the check 
box is unchecked, as shown in Figure 3-1, and click Done. The 
“Synchronizing Your Data” section tells you all about how to con-
figure your contacts, calendars, e-mail accounts, and bookmarks 
manually.
 
 We’ve chosen to not select the check box because this computer has 
four e-mail accounts and we don’t want all of them to synchronize with 
the iPhone.
 
4b. After you click the Done button (applies only to those who just per-
formed steps 3 and 4a), the Summary pane should appear. If it doesn’t, 
make sure your iPhone is still selected in the source list and click the 
Summary tab near the top of the window, as shown in Figure 3-2.
 
Summary tab
 
Figure 3-2: The Summary pane is pretty painless.

5. If you want iTunes to sync your iPhone automatically whenever 
you connect it to your computer, click to put a check mark in the 
Automatically Sync When This iPhone Is Connected check box (in the 
Options area).
 
 Don’t select this check box if you want to sync manually by clicking the 
Sync button at the bottom of the window.
 
 Your choice in Step 5 is not set in stone. If you select the Automatically 
Sync When This iPhone Is Connected check box, you can still prevent 
your iPhone from syncing automatically in several different ways:
 
• Way #1: After you connect the iPhone to your computer, click the 
Summary tab in iTunes and uncheck the Automatically Sync When 
This iPhone Is Connected check box. This prevents iTunes from 
opening automatically when you connect the iPhone. If you use 
this method, you can still start a sync manually.
 
• Way #2: Launch iTunes; then, before you connect your iPhone 
to your computer, press and hold Command+Option (Mac) or 
Shift+Ctrl (PC) until you see your iPhone in the iTunes source list. 
This method prevents your iPhone from syncing automatically just 
this one time, without changing any settings.
 
6. If you want to sync only items that are selected in your iTunes library, 
select the Only Sync Checked Songs and Videos check box.
 
7. If you want to turn off automatic syncing in the Music and Video 
panes, check the Manually Manage Music and Videos check box.
And, of course, if you decide to uncheck the Automatically Sync When This 
iPhone Is Connected check box, you can always synchronize manually by 
clicking the Sync button in the bottom-right corner of the window.
By the way, if you’ve changed any sync settings since the last time you syn-
chronized, the Sync button will instead say Apply.
Disconnecting the iPhone
When the iPhone is syncing with your computer, its screen says Sync in 
progress and iTunes displays a message that says that it’s syncing with your 
iPhone. When the sync is finished, iTunes displays a message that the iPhone 
sync is complete and it’s okay to disconnect your iPhone.
 
If you disconnect your iPhone before a sync is completed, all or part of the 
sync may fail.

35
 Chapter 3: The Kitchen Sync: Getting Stuff to and from Your iPhone
To cancel a sync so that you can safely disconnect your iPhone, drag the 
slider on the iPhone (the one that says Slide to Cancel) during the sync.
If you get a call while you’re syncing, the sync is cancelled automatically so 
that you can safely disconnect your iPhone and answer the call. When you’re 
finished with the call, just reconnect your iPhone to restart the sync.
Synchronizing Your Data
Did you choose to set up data synchronization manually by not selecting the 
Automatically Sync Contacts, Calendars, Email Accounts, and Bookmarks 
check box in the Set Up Your iPhone pane shown in Figure 3-1? If you did, 
your next order of business is to tell iTunes what data you want to synchro-
nize between your iPhone and your computer. You do this by clicking the 
Info tab, which is to the right of the Summary tab.
The Info pane has six sections: MobileMe, Contacts, Calendars, Mail Accounts, 
Web Browser, and Advanced. The next sections look at them one by one.
MobileMe
MobileMe is Apple’s $99-a-year service for keeping your iPhone, iPod touch, 
Macs, and PCs synchronized. It is the latest iteration of what Apple used to 
call .Mac (pronounced dotMac). The big allure of MobileMe is that it can 
“push” information such as e-mail, calendars, contacts, and bookmarks from 
your computer to and from your iPhone and keep those items synchronized 
on your iPhone and computer(s) wirelessly and without human intervention.
If you want to have your e-mail, calendars, contacts, and bookmarks synchro-
nized automatically and wirelessly, click the Set Up Now button. Your Web 
browser will launch and instructions appear for subscribing to MobileMe 
if you’re not already a subscriber or for setting up each of your devices for 
MobileMe if you are already a subscriber.
If you’re going to use MobileMe to sync your e-mail, calendars, contacts, 
and bookmarks, you can safely ignore the information in four of the next 
five sections: Contacts, Calendars, Web Browser, and Advanced. Those four 
sections deal with using iTunes for synchronization, and you won’t need 
them if you’re using MobileMe. You should probably read the fifth section, 
Mail accounts, even if you’re using the MobileMe service for e-mail, because 
it applies to syncing your mail settings for MobileMe and/or other e-mail 
accounts.

Contacts
The Contacts section of the Info pane determines how synchronization is 
handled for your contacts. One method is to synchronize all your contacts, 
as shown in Figure 3-3. Or you can synchronize any or all groups of contacts 
you’ve created in your computer’s address-book program; just select the 
appropriate check boxes in the Selected Groups list, and only those groups 
will be synchronized.
 
 
Figure 3-3: Want to synchronize your contacts? This is where you set things up.
The iPhone syncs with the following address book programs:
 
✓ Mac: Address Book and other address books that sync with Address 
Book, such as Microsoft Entourage
 
✓ PC: Windows Address Book (Outlook Express), and Microsoft Outlook
 
✓ Mac and PC: Yahoo! Address Book, Google Contacts
On a Mac, you can sync contacts with multiple applications. On a PC, you can 
sync contacts with only one application at a time.
If you use Yahoo! Address Book, click Configure to enter your Yahoo! ID and 
password. If you use Google Contacts, click Configure to enter your Google ID 
and password.
Syncing will never delete a contact from your Yahoo! Address Book if it has 
a Messenger ID, even if you delete that contact on the iPhone or on your 
 computer.
 
To delete a contact that has a Messenger ID, log in to your Yahoo! account 
with a Web browser and delete the contact in your Yahoo! Address Book.
 
If you sync with your employer’s Microsoft Exchange calendar and contacts, 
all your personal contacts and calendars will be wiped out.

 Chapter 3: The Kitchen Sync: Getting Stuff to and from Your iPhone
Calendars
The Calendars section of the Info pane determines how synchronization is 
handled for your appointments and events. You can synchronize all of your 
calendars, as shown in Figure 3-4. Or you can synchronize any or all indi-
vidual calendars you’ve created in your computer’s calendar program. Just 
select the appropriate check boxes.
 
 
Figure 3-4: Set up sync for your calendar events here.
The iPhone syncs with the following calendar programs:
 
✓ Mac: iCal, plus any tasks or events that currently sync with iCal on your 
Mac, such as events and tasks in Microsoft Entourage
 
✓ PC: Microsoft Outlook 2003 or 2007
On a Mac, you can sync calendars with multiple applications. On a PC, you 
can sync calendars with only one application at a time.
 
One cool thing about syncing your calendar is that if you create reminders, 
alerts, or alarms in your computer’s calendar program, they appear (and 
sound) on your iPhone at the appropriate date and time.
Mail accounts
You can sync account settings for your e-mail accounts in the Mail Accounts 
section of the Info pane. You can synchronize all of your e-mail accounts (if 
you have more than one), or you can synchronize individual accounts as 
shown in Figure 3-5. Just select the appropriate check boxes.
The iPhone syncs with the following mail programs:
 
✓ Mac: Mail and Microsoft Entourage
 
✓ PC: Microsoft Outlook 2003 or 2007 and Microsoft Outlook Express

38
Part I: Getting to Know Your iPhone 
 
 
Figure 3-5: Transfer e-mail account settings to your iPhone here.
 
E-mail account settings are synchronized only one way: from your computer 
to your iPhone. If you make changes to any e-mail account settings on your 
iPhone, the changes will not be synchronized back to the e-mail account on 
your computer. Trust us, this is a very good feature and we’re glad Apple did 
it this way.
By the way, the password for your e-mail account may or may not be saved 
on your computer. If you sync an e-mail account and the iPhone asks for a 
password when you send or receive mail, do this: Tap Settings on the Home 
screen, tap Mail, tap your e-mail account’s name, and then type your pass-
word in the appropriate field.
Web browser
The Web Browser section has but a single check box, which asks if you want 
to sync your bookmarks. Select it if you do; don’t select it if you don’t.
The iPhone syncs bookmarks with the following Web browsers:
 
✓ Mac: Safari
 
✓ PC: Microsoft Internet Explorer and Safari
Advanced
Every so often the contacts, calendars, mail accounts, or bookmarks on 
your iPhone get so screwed up that the easiest way to fix things is to erase 
that information on your iPhone and replace it with information from your 
 computer.
If that’s the case, just click to select the appropriate check boxes, as shown 
in Figure 3-6. Then the next time you sync, that information on your iPhone 
will be replaced with information from your computer.

39
 Chapter 3: The Kitchen Sync: Getting Stuff to and from Your iPhone
 
 
Figure 3-6: Replace the information on your iPhone with the information on your computer.
 
Because the Advanced section is at the bottom of the Info pane and you have 
to scroll down to see it, it’s easy to forget that it’s there. Although you prob-
ably won’t need to use this feature very often (if ever), you’ll be happy you 
remembered that it’s there if you do need it.
Synchronizing Your Media
If you chose to let iTunes manage synchronizing your data automatically, wel-
come back. This section looks at how you get your media — your ringtones, 
music, podcasts, video, and photos — from your computer to your iPhone.
 
Ringtones, music, podcasts, and video (but not photos) are synced only one 
way: from your computer to your iPhone. Deleting any of these items from 
your iPhone does not delete them from your computer when you sync.
Ringtones, music, podcasts, and video
You use the Ringtones, Music, Podcasts, and Video panes to specify the 
media that you want to copy from your computer to your iPhone. To view 
any of these panes, make sure that your iPhone is still selected in the source 
list and then click the Music, Podcasts, or Video tab near the top of the 
window.
Ringtones
If you have any custom ringtones in your iTunes library, select the Sync 
Ringtones check box. Then you can choose either all ringtones or choose 
individual ringtones by selecting their check boxes.
Music
To transfer music to your iPhone, select the Sync Music check box in the 
Music pane. You can then select the button for All Songs and Playlists or 

40
Part I: Getting to Know Your iPhone 
Selected Playlists. If you choose the latter, click the check boxes next to par-
ticular playlists you want to transfer. You also can choose to include music 
videos by selecting the check box at the bottom of the pane (see Figure 3-7.)
 
 
Figure 3-7: Use the Music pane to copy music from your computer to your iPhone.
 
If you choose All Songs 
and Playlists and have 
more songs in your iTunes 
library than storage space 
on your iPhone — more 
than about 7GB on an 8GB 
iPhone and 14.5GB on a 
16GB iPhone — you’ll see 
one or both of the error mes-
sages shown in Figure 3-8 
when you try to sync.
To avoid these errors, 
select playlists that total 
less than 7 or 15 gigabytes.
 
Music, podcasts, and video 
are notorious for chewing 
up massive amounts of stor-
age space on your iPhone. 
If you try to sync too much media, you’ll see lots of error messages like the 
ones in Figure 3-8. Forewarned is forearmed.
 Figure 3-8: If you have more music than your iPhone has 
room for, this is what you’ll see when you sync.

41
 Chapter 3: The Kitchen Sync: Getting Stuff to and from Your iPhone
Podcasts
To transfer podcasts to your iPhone, select the Sync check box in the 
Podcasts pane. Then you can choose All Podcasts or Selected Podcasts, as 
shown in Figure 3-9.
 
 
Figure 3-9: The Podcasts pane determines which podcasts are copied to your iPhone.
Regardless of whether you choose to sync all podcasts or only selected pod-
casts, a pop-up menu allows you to specify which episodes you want to sync, 
as shown in Figure 3-10.
 
 
Figure 3-10: This menu determines how podcasts are synced with your iPhone.

42
Part I: Getting to Know Your iPhone 
Video
To transfer rented movies, TV shows, and movies to your iPhone, select the 
appropriate check boxes in the Video pane, as shown in Figure 3-11.
 
 
 Figure 3-11: Your choices in the Video pane determine which 
rented movies, TV shows, and movies are copied to your iPhone.
The procedure for syncing TV shows is slightly different from the procedure 
for syncing movies. First, select the Sync check box to enable TV show sync-
ing. Then choose either All TV Shows or Selected. If you go with Selected, 
you can then choose between TV Shows and Playlists from the pop-up menu 
(which says TV Shows in Figure 3-11).
Next, choose how many episodes you want to sync from the pop-up menu 
shown in Figure 3-12 (which says 3 Most Recent Unwatched).

43
 Chapter 3: The Kitchen Sync: Getting Stuff to and from Your iPhone
 
 
Figure 3-12: This menu determines how TV shows are synced with your iPhone.
To sync rented movies or movies you own, first select the Sync Rented 
Movies or Sync Movies check box, and then select the check boxes of the 
individual movies you want to sync.
 
We don’t have any rented movies in our iTunes library, so there’s nothing to 
check in the Rented Movies section in Figure 3-11 or Figure 3-12. Rest assured 
that if we did have rented movies, they would definitely appear right there in 
the Rented Movies section.
Photos
Syncing photos is a little different from syncing other media because your 
iPhone has a built-in camera and you may want to copy pictures you take 
with the iPhone to your computer, as well as copy pictures stored on your 
computer to your iPhone.
The iPhone syncs photos with the following programs:
 
✓ Mac: iPhoto version 4.03 or later, Aperture, and any folder that contains 
images
 
✓ PC: Adobe Photoshop Album 2.0 or later, Adobe Photoshop Elements 3.0 
or later
You can also sync photos with any folder on your computer that contains 
images.
To sync photos, click the Photos tab near the top of the window. In the Photos 
pane, select the Sync Photos From check box and then choose an application 
or folder from the pop-up menu (which says iPhoto in Figure 3-13).

44
Part I: Getting to Know Your iPhone 
 
 
Figure 3-13: The Photos pane determines which photos will be synchronized with your iPhone.
If you choose an application that supports photo albums, as in Figure 3-13 by 
choosing iPhoto, you can then select specific albums to sync. If you choose a 
folder full of images, you can create subfolders inside it which will appear as 
albums on your iPhone. But if you choose an application that doesn’t support 
albums, or a single folder full of images with no subfolders, you have to trans-
fer all or nothing.
Because we selected iPhoto in the Sync Photos From menu, and iPhoto ’08 
(the version installed on our Mac) supports Events in addition to albums, we 
have the option of syncing events instead of albums if we prefer.
 
If you have lots of albums or events, you can rearrange the list so that the 
ones you expect to check or uncheck most often are near the top. Simply 
click an album or event name and drag it up or down in the list.
If you’ve taken any photos with your iPhone since the last time you synced 
it, the appropriate program will launch (or the appropriate folder will be 
selected), and you’ll have the option of downloading the pictures to your 
computer. The process is the same as when you download pictures from 
your digital camera.

45
 Chapter 3: The Kitchen Sync: Getting Stuff to and from Your iPhone
Applications
If you have downloaded or purchased any iPhone applications from the 
iTunes App Store, click the Applications tab and then select the Sync 
Applications check box. Then you can choose either All Applications or 
choose individual applications by selecting their check boxes.
How much space did I use?
If you’re interested in knowing how much free space is available on your 
iPhone, look near the bottom of the iTunes window while your iPhone is 
selected in the source list. You’ll see a chart that shows the contents of your 
iPhone, color-coded for your convenience. As you can see in Figure 3-14, this 
16GB iPhone has roughly 1.53GB of free space available.
 
 
Figure 3-14: This handy chart shows you how much space is being used on your iPhone.
The chart appears at the bottom of the iTunes window, regardless of which 
pane is currently selected.
 
Here’s a cool trick: Click directly on the chart and watch the units of measure 
switch from gigabytes/megabytes to songs/items/photos and days/hours.
 
In case you’re wondering, Other is the catch-all category for contacts, calen-
dars, appointments, events, bookmarks, applications, and e-mail stored on 
your phone. In our case, the total of these items is a mere 333MB, a tiny frac-
tion of the total storage space available on this iPhone.

Part II
The Mobile iPhone

Your iPhone is ﬁ rst and foremost a mobile 
phone, so in this part we explore how to use 
typical mobile phone features, starting with all the 
neat ways to make an outgoing phone call. You 
also ﬁ nd out how to answer or ignore the calls 
that come in and discover iPhone’s clever visual 
voicemail feature, which lets you take in messages 
on your terms, rather than in the order in which 
the messages arrived on the phone. You also 
ﬁ gure out how to juggle calls, merge calls, and 
decide on a ringtone.
After you’ve mastered all the calling and listening 
stuff, you are ready to become a whiz at sending 
and retrieving what are called SMS text messages. 
As journalists, we especially appreciate what 
comes next: ﬁ nding out how to become a cham-
pion note-taker.
We close this part by investigating all those 
C-word programs — namely, Calendar, Calculator, 
and Clock. These handy applications not only 
enable you to solve arithmetic problems on the ﬂ y 
(with one or two nifty calculators), but they also 
help you stay on top of your appointments and — 
thanks to a built-in alarm clock — show up for 
them on time.

Understanding the
Phone-damentals
In This Chapter
▶ Making a call
▶ Visualizing visual voicemail
▶ Recording a greeting
▶ Receiving a call
▶ Choosing ringtones
▶ Setting up conference calls
You may well have bought an iPhone for its spectacular photo 
viewer, marvelous widescreen iPod, and the best darn pocket-
sized Internet browser you’ve ever come across. Not to mention 
its overall coolness.
For most of us, though, cool goes only so far. The iPhone’s 
most critical mission is the one from which its name is 
derived — it is first and foremost a cell phone. And no 
matter how capable it is at all those other things, when 
push comes to shove you had best be able to make and 
receive phone calls.
That puts a lot of responsibility in the hands of AT&T, the 
iPhone’s exclusive wireless carrier in the U.S. As with any 
cell phone, the strength of the wireless signal depends a 
great deal on your location and the robustness of the carrier’s 
network.
As noted in Chapter 1, the cell-signal status icon at the upper-left corner of 
the screen can clue you in on what your phone-calling experience may be 
like. Simply put, more bars supposedly equate to a better experience. What 
you hope to avoid are those two dreaded words . . . No Service.

Part II: The Mobile iPhone 
Cell coverage aside, this chapter is devoted to all the nifty ways you can 
handle wireless calls on an iPhone.
Somewhere Alexander Graham Bell is beaming.
Making a Call
Start by tapping the Phone icon on the Home screen. You can then make 
calls by tapping any of the icons that show up at the bottom of the screen: 
Contacts, Favorites, Recents, Keypad, or Voicemail. Depending on the cir-
cumstances, one of these could be the most appropriate method. Let’s take 
them one by one.
Contacts
If you read the chapter on syncing (Chapter 3), you know how to get the 
snail-mail addresses, e-mail addresses, and (most relevant for this chapter) 
phone numbers that reside on your PC or Mac into the iPhone. Assuming that 
you went through that drill already, all those addresses and phone numbers 
are hanging out in one place. Their not-so-secret hiding place is revealed 
when you tap the Contacts icon inside the Phone application or the Contacts 
icon on one of the Home screen pages.
Here’s how to make those contacts work to your benefit:
 
1. Inside the Phone application, tap Contacts.
 
2. Flick your finger so the list of contacts on the screen scrolls rapidly up 
or down, loosely reminiscent of the spinning Lucky 7s (or other pic-
tures) on a Las Vegas slot machine.
 
 Think of the payout you’d get with that kind of power on a One-Armed 
Bandit.
 
 Alternatively, you can move your fingers along the alphabet on the right 
edge of the Contacts list or tap one of the teeny-tiny letters that make up 
that alphabet to jump to names that begin with that letter.
 
 As part of the 2.0 software upgrade for iPhone, you also can find a list of 
potential matches by starting to type the name of a contact in the new 
search field near the top of the list. Or you can type the name of the 
place your contact works. You may have to flick to get the search field 
into view.
 
3. When you’re at or near the appropriate contact name, stop the scroll-
ing by tapping the screen.
 
 Note that when you tap to stop the scrolling, that tap doesn’t select an 
item in the list. That may seem counterintuitive the first few times you 
try it, but we got used to it and now we really like it this way.

51
 Chapter 4: Understanding the Phone-damentals
 
 Tap the status bar to automatically scroll to the top of the list. This is 
useful if you’re really popular (or influential) and have a whole bunch of 
names among your contacts.
 
4. Tap the name of the person you want 
to call.
 
 As shown in Figure 4-1, you can see a 
bunch of fields with the individual’s 
phone numbers, physical and e-mail 
addresses, and possibly even a mug 
shot.
 
 Odds are pretty good that the person 
has more than one phone number, so 
the hardest decision you must make is 
choosing which of these to call.
 
5. Tap the phone number, and the iPhone 
initiates the call.
If you lumped your contacts into Groups 
on your computer, reflecting, say, different 
departments in your company or friends 
from work, friends from school, and so on, 
you can tap the Groups button on the upper-
left side of the All Contacts screen to access these groups.
 
Your own iPhone phone number, lest you forget it, appears at the top of 
the Contacts list, provided you arrived in Contacts through the Phone 
 application.
You can also initiate text messages and e-mails from within Contacts. Those 
topics are discussed in greater depth in Chapters 5 and 11, respectively.
Favorites
Consider Favorites the iPhone equivalent of speed-dialing. It’s where you can 
keep a list of the people and numbers you dial most often. Merely tap the per-
son’s name in Favorites and your iPhone calls the person.
 
You can set up as many favorites as you need for a person. So, for example, 
you may create separate Favorites listings for both your spouse’s office 
phone number and cell number.
Setting up Favorites is a breeze. When looking at one of your contacts, you 
may have noticed the Add to Favorites button. When you tap this button, all 
the phone numbers you have for that person pop up. Tap the number you 
want to make into a favorite and it turns up on the list.
Figure 4-1: Contact me.

52
Part II: The Mobile iPhone 
 
You can rearrange the order in which your favorites are displayed. Tap Edit, 
and then, to the right of the person you want to move, press your finger 
against the symbol that looks like three short horizontal lines stacked on top 
of one another. Drag that symbol to the place on the list where you want your 
favorite contact to appear.
You can designate new favorites from within the Favorites application 
by tapping the + symbol at the upper-right corner of the screen. Doing so 
brings you back to Contacts. From there, choose the appropriate person and 
number. A star appears next to any contact’s number picked as a favorite.
If any of your chosen folks happen to fall 
out of favor, you can easily kick them off the 
Favorites roster. Here’s how:
 
1. Tap the Edit button in the upper-left 
corner of the screen.
 
 You’ll notice that a red circle with a 
horizontal white line appears to the left 
of each name in the list.
 
2. Tap the circle next to the A-lister get-
ting the heave-ho.
 
 The horizontal white line is now verti-
cal and a red Remove button appears 
to the right of the name, as shown in 
Figure 4-2.
 
3. Tap Remove.
 
 The person (or one of his or her given 
phone numbers) is no longer afforded 
the privilege of being in your iPhone 
inner circle.
 
Booting someone off the Favorites list does 
not remove that person from the main 
Contacts list.
Recents
Tapping the Recents icon displays the iPhone call log. The Recents feature 
houses logs of all the, well, recent calls made or received, as well as calls that 
you missed. Here’s a tricky concept: Tap All to show all the recent calls and 
Missed to show just those you missed. Under the All list, completed calls are 
shown in black and missed calls are in red.
Figure 4-2: I don’t like you as much 
anymore.

53
 Chapter 4: Understanding the Phone-damentals
By tapping the small blue circle with the right-pointing arrow next to an 
item in the list, you can access information about the time a call was made 
or missed, as well as any known information about the caller from your 
Contacts information.
To return a call, just tap anywhere on the name.
 
If one of the calls you missed came from someone who isn’t already in your 
Contacts, you can add him or her. Tap the right-pointing arrow, and then tap 
the Create New Contact button.
If the person is among your Contacts but has a new number, tap the Add to 
Existing Contact button.
When the list gets too long, tap Clear to clean it up.
Keypad
From time to time, of course, you have to 
dial the number of a person or company 
who hasn’t earned a spot in your Contacts.
That’s when you’ll want to tap the keypad 
icon to bring up the large keys of the virtual 
touch-tone keypad you see in Figure 4-3. 
Despite what you may have read elsewhere, 
we find it surprisingly simple to manually 
dial a number on this keypad. Just tap the 
appropriate keys and tap Call.
 
To add this number to your address book, 
tap the + key (it’s the one with the silhou-
ette) on the keypad and click either Create 
New Contact or Add to Existing Contact.
Quibble: You won’t be able to dial without 
looking at the screen; dialing without looking 
is possible on at least some of the handsets 
with physical keypads. Moreover, at least 
until some third party apps came along, you 
couldn’t dial Phone by voice either. Voice 
dialing on some phones lets you call Mom 
simply by saying out loud, “Call Mom.”
Figure 4-3: A virtually familiar way 
to dial.

54
Part II: The Mobile iPhone 
You can use the iPhone’s keypad also to remotely check your voicemail at 
work or home.
Come to think of it, what a perfect segue into the next section. It’s on one of 
our favorite iPhone features, visual voicemail.
Visual voicemail
How often have you had to listen to four or five (or more) voicemail mes-
sages before getting to the message you really want, or need, to hear? As 
shown in Figure 4-4, the iPhone’s clever visual voicemail presents a list of 
your voicemail messages 
in the order in which calls 
were received. But you 
need not listen to those 
messages in order.
How do you even know 
you have voicemail? 
There are a few ways:
 
✓ A red circle show-
ing the number of 
pending messages 
awaiting your atten-
tion appears above 
the Phone icon on 
the Home screen, or 
above the Voicemail 
icon from within the 
Phone application.
 
✓ You may also see 
a message on the 
iPhone display that 
says something like, 
“New voicemail from 
Ed (or Bob).”
Whatever draws you in, tap that Voicemail icon to display the list of voice-
mails. You see the caller’s phone number, assuming this info is known 
through CallerID, and in some cases, his or her name. Or you see the word 
Unknown.
The beauty of all this, of course, is that you can ignore (or at least put off lis-
tening to) certain messages. We are not in the advice-giving business on what 
calls you can safely avoid; if you ignore messages from the IRS or your parole 
officer, it’s at your own risk, okay?

Figure 4-4: Visual voicemail in action.

55
 Chapter 4: Understanding the Phone-damentals
A blue dot next to a name or number signifies that you haven’t heard the 
message yet.
To play back a voicemail, tap the name or number in question. Then tap the 
tiny Play/Pause button that shows up to the left. Tap once more to pause the 
message; tap again to resume. Tap the Speaker button if you want to hear the 
message through the iPhone’s speakerphone.
 
Tap the blue arrow next to a caller’s name or number to bring up any contact 
info on the person or to add the caller to your Contacts.
 
The tiny playhead along the Scrubber bar (refer to Figure 4-4) shows you the 
length of the message and how much of the message you’ve heard. If you 
hate when callers ramble on forever, you can drag the playhead to rapidly 
advance through a message. Perhaps more importantly, if you miss some-
thing, you can replay that segment.
Returning a call is as simple as tapping the green Call Back button. And you 
can delete a voicemail by pressing Delete.
If you have no phone service, you’ll see a message that says Visual Voicemail 
is currently unavailable.
The globetrotting iPhone
Apple has managed to cram ten radios into the 
latest iPhone. It’s got four GSM/Edge radios 
(850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz), three UMTS/HSDPA 
radios, plus radios for Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and 
GPS. And here’s a little bit of trivia: The metal 
ring around the iPhone camera is part of the 
antenna design.
Before you break into a sweat over the termi-
nology, know that all we’re really talking about 
is a 3G or “third-generation” phone you can 
use to make calls (and do more) while travel-
ing abroad. You’ll have to have AT&T turn on 
something called international roaming (unless, 
of course, you live in a foreign land and have a 
local carrier). Contact AT&T for the latest rates, 
which were fairly harsh at the time this book 
was being prepared. Go to www.wireless.
att.com/learn/international for 
details.
If you’re calling the U.S. while overseas, you 
can take advantage of International Assist. It’s 
a feature that automatically adds the proper 
prefix to U.S. numbers dialed from abroad. Tap 
Settings, Phone, and then International Assist. 
Make sure you see the blue On button instead 
of the white Off button.
Although iPhone started out as a U.S.-only prop-
osition, Apple launched versions of the iPhone 
in nearly two dozen countries in the summer of 
2008, with at least 70 in all planned by the end of 
the calendar year.

56
Part II: The Mobile iPhone 
 
You can listen to your iPhone voicemail from another phone. Just dial your 
iPhone number and, while the greeting plays, enter your voicemail password. 
You can set up such a password by tapping Settings from the Home screen 
and then tapping Phone. Tap Change Voicemail Password. You’ll be asked 
to enter your current voicemail password, if you already have one. If one 
doesn’t exist yet, tap Done. If it does exist, enter it and then tap Done. You’ll 
then be asked to type the new password and tap Done, twice.
Recording a greeting
You have two choices when it comes to the voicemail greeting your callers 
will hear. You can accept a generic greeting with your phone number by 
default. Or you can create a custom greeting in your own voice. The steps:
 
1. Inside the voicemail application, tap the Greeting button.
 
2. Tap Custom.
 
3. Tap Record and start dictating a clever, deserving-of-being-on-the-
iPhone voicemail greeting.
 
4. When you have finished recording, tap Stop.
 
5. Review the greeting by pressing Play.
 
6. If the greeting is worthy, tap Save. If not, tap Cancel and start over at 
Step 1.
Receiving a Call
It’s wonderful to have numerous options for making a call. But what are your 
choices when somebody calls you? The answer depends on whether you are 
willing to take the call or not.
Accepting the call
To accept a call, you have three options:
 
✓ Tap Answer and greet the caller in whatever language makes sense.
 
✓ If the phone is locked, drag the slider to the right.
 
✓ If you are donning the stereo earbuds that come with the iPhone, click 
the microphone button.
 
Actually, you have a fourth option if you wear a wireless Bluetooth headset 
or use a car speakerphone. Click the Answer button on your headset or 
speakerphone (refer to the manual if the process isn’t intuitive). For more on

 Chapter 4: Understanding the Phone-damentals
 
If you are listening to music in your iPhone’s iPod when a call comes in, the 
song stops playing and you have to decide whether to take the call. If you do, 
the music resumes from where you left off once the conversation ends.
Rejecting the call
We’re going to assume that you’re not a cold-hearted person out to break a 
caller’s heart. Rather, we assume that you are a busy person who will call 
back at a more convenient time.
Keeping that positive spin in mind, here are three ways to reject a call on the 
spot and send the call to voicemail:
 
✓ Tap Decline. Couldn’t be easier than that.
 
✓ Press the Sleep/Wake button twice in rapid succession. (The button is 
on the top of the device.)
 
✓ Using the supplied headset, press and hold the Microphone button for a 
couple of seconds and then let go. Two beeps let you know that the call 
was indeed rejected.
 
Sometimes you’re perfectly willing to take a call but you need to silence the 
ringer or turn off the vibration. To do so, press the Sleep/Wake button a 
single time, or press one of the volume buttons. You’ll still have the opportu-
nity to answer.
Choosing ringtones
At the time this book was written, Apple 
included 25 ringtones in the iPhone, ranging 
from the sound of crickets to an old car horn. 
Read the “iTunes and ringtones” sidebar to 
figure out how to create your own custom 
ringtones.
To choose a ringtone, follow these steps:
 
1. From the Home screen, tap Settings.
 
2. Tap Sounds.
 
3. Tap Ringtone to access the list of avail-
able ringtones, shown in Figure 4-5.
 
4. Flick your finger to move up or down 
the list.
Figure 4-5: Ring my chimes: The 
iPhone’s ringtones.

58
Part II: The Mobile iPhone 
 
5. Tap any of the ringtones to hear what it will sound like.
 
 A check mark appears next to the ringtone you’ve just listened to. If 
need be, adjust the volume slider in Sounds.
 
6. If satisfied, you need do nothing more. Unbeknownst to you, you have 
just selected that ringtone. If not pleased, try another.
 
You can easily assign specific ringtones to individual callers. From Contacts, 
choose the person to whom you want to designate a particular ringtone. Tap 
Edit and then tap Assign Ringtone. This displays the aforementioned list of 
ringtones. Choose the one that seems most appropriate (a barking dog, say, 
for your father-in-law).
To change or delete the ringtone for a specific person, go back into Contacts, 
and tap Edit. Either tap the right arrow to choose a new ringtone for that 
person or tap the red circle and Delete to remove the custom ringtone 
 altogether.
iTunes and ringtones
When Apple first launched iPhone in June 2007, 
we were disappointed that we couldn’t use 
snippets of music from our iTunes library for 
ringtones. It took a couple of months, but iPhone 
owners can now turn some of the songs they’ve 
purchased (or will buy) into custom ringtones. 
You must fork over 99 cents for songs that are 
already in your iTunes library on your computer 
or pay $1.98 for a new song from the iTunes 
Store online (which lets you also get full use of 
the track on your PC or Mac.)
The ringtone-ready music in your own iTunes 
collection is designated by a little bell symbol. 
Clicking that symbol brings up a ringtone editor 
that resembles Apple’s GarageBand music 
 editing software. Drag the editor over the  portion 
of the song you want to use as your ringtone — 
up to 30 seconds worth. You can choose to 
have the ringtone fade in or out by checking the 
appropriate boxes in the editor. Click Preview to 
make sure that you’re happy with the result, and 
click Buy when you’re satisfied.
Connect the iPhone to your computer to syn-
chronize the ringtone.
Actually, you can also create custom ringtones 
in GarageBand and through such third-party 
utilities as iToner. Head to Chapter 18 for more 
details on GarageBand ringtoning. (We love 
coining new verbs).

 Chapter 4: Understanding the Phone-damentals
While on a Call
You can do lots of things while talking on an iPhone, such as consulting your 
Calendar, taking notes, or checking the weather. Tap the Home button to get 
to these other applications. You’ve just witnessed the multitasking marvel 
that is the iPhone.
 
If you’re using Wi-Fi or 3G, you can also surf the Web (through Safari) while 
talking on the phone. But you can’t surf while you talk if your only outlet to 
cyberspace is the EDGE network.
Other options:
 
✓ Mute a call: From the main call screen 
(shown in Figure 4-6) tap Mute. Now 
you need not mutter under your breath 
when a caller ticks you off; the caller 
can’t hear you. Tap Mute again to un-
mute the sound.
 
✓ Tap Contacts to display the Contacts 
list.
 
✓ Place a call on hold: Again, pretty self-
explanatory. Just tap Hold. Tap Hold 
again to take the person off hold. You 
might put a caller on hold to answer 
another incoming call or to make a 
second call yourself. The next section 
deals with more than one call at a time.
 
✓ Tap Keypad to bring back the keypad: 
This is useful if you have to type touch-
tones to access another voicemail 
system or respond to an automated 
menu system. Heaven forbid you actually 
get a live person when calling an insurance company or airline. But we 
digress. . . .
 
✓ Use the speakerphone: Tap Speaker to listen to a call through the 
iPhone’s internal speakers without having to hold the device up to your 
mouth.
 
✓ Make a conference call: Read on.
Figure 4-6: Managing calls.

60
Part II: The Mobile iPhone 
Juggling calls
You can field a new call when you’re already 
talking to somebody. Or ignore it (by tapping 
Ignore).
To take the new call while keeping the first 
caller on hold, tap the Hold Call + Answer 
button that appears, as shown in Figure 4-7. 
You can then toggle between calls (placing 
one or the other on hold) by tapping either 
the Swap button or the first call at the top 
of the screen.
If this is too much for you and that second 
caller is really important, tap End Call + 
Answer to ditch caller number one.
Conference calls
Now suppose caller number one and caller 
number two know each other. Or you’d like to play matchmaker so they 
get to know each other. Tap Merge Calls so all three of you can chitchat. At 
first the phone number of each caller will scroll at the top of your screen 
like a rolling ticker. A few seconds later the ticker is replaced by the word 
Conference with a circled right-pointing arrow to its immediate right.
Now let’s assume you have to talk to your whole sales team at once. It may 
be time to initiate a full-blown conference call, which effectively takes this 
merge-call idea to its extreme. You can merge up to five calls at a time. In 
fact, creating such a conference call on the iPhone may be simpler than get-
ting the same five people in a physical room at the same time.
Here’s how you do it. Start by making a call and then placing the caller on 
hold as noted earlier in the “Juggling calls” section. Tap Add Call to make 
another call and then Merge Calls to bring everybody together. Repeat this 
exercise to add the other calls.
Other conference call tidbits:
 
✓ iPhone is actually a two-line phone, and one of the available lines can be 
involved in a conference call.
 
✓ If you want to drop a call from a conference, tap Conference and then 
tap the red circle with the little picture of the phone in it that appears 
next to the call. Tap End Call to make that caller go bye-bye.
Figure 4-7: Swapping calls.

61
 Chapter 4: Understanding the Phone-damentals
 
✓ You can speak privately with one of the callers in a conference. Tap 
Conference, and then tap Private next to the caller you want to go hush-
hush with. Tap Merge Calls to bring the caller back into the Conference 
so everyone can hear him or her.
 
✓ You can add a new incoming caller to an existing conference call by tap-
ping Hold Call + Answer followed by Merge Calls.
There’s even more you can do with iPhone the phone. Check out Chapter 13 
for extra phone tips. Meanwhile, we recommend that you read the next chap-
ter to figure out how to become a whiz at text messaging.

Texting 1, 2, 3: 
SMS Messages and Notes
In This Chapter
▶ Sending and receiving SMS text messages
▶ Using the Notes application
T
here has never been a device like the iPhone, so chances are this is your 
first experience with an intelligent virtual keyboard. In the beginning, it 
will probably feel awkward. Within a few days, however, many iPhone users 
report that they not only have become comfortable using it but have become 
proficient virtual typists as well.
By the time you finish this chapter, we think you’ll feel 
comfortable and proficient, too. You discover all about using the 
virtual keyboard in Chapter 2. In this chapter, we focus on two 
of the iPhone applications that use text — namely Text (SMS) 
and Notes.
Texting
The Text application lets you exchange short text 
messages with any cell phone that supports the SMS 
protocol (which is almost all cell phones today).
 
SMS is the acronym for the Short Message Service protocol, 
often known as text messaging or just plain texting.
 Typing text on a cell phone with a 12-key numeric keypad is an unnatural 
act,  which is why many people have never sent a single SMS text message. The 
iPhone will change that. The intelligent virtual keyboard makes it easy to com-
pose short text messages,  and the big,  bright,  high-resolution screen makes it a 
pleasure to read them.

Part II: The Mobile iPhone 
But before we get to the part where you send or receive SMS messages, let’s 
go over some SMS basics:
 
✓ Both sender and receiver need SMS-enabled mobile phones. Your 
iPhone qualifies, as does almost any mobile phone made in the past four 
or five years. Keep in mind that if you send SMS messages to folks with 
a phone that doesn’t support SMS, they will never get your message nor 
will they even know you sent a message.
 
✓ Some phones (not the iPhone, of course) limit SMS messages to 160 
characters. If you try to send a longer message to one of these phones, 
your message may be truncated or split into multiple shorter messages. 
The point is that it’s a good idea to keep SMS messages brief.
 
✓ AT&T iPhone plans no longer include SMS text messages. Individual 
SMS text messages cost 20¢ each unless you subscribe to one of the 
optional SMS text message plans, which start at $5 per month for 200 
messages.
 
 Each individual message in a conversation counts against this total, 
even if it’s only a one-word reply such as “OK,” or “CUL8R” (which is 
Teenager for “see you later”).
 
✓ You can increase the number of SMS messages in your plan for a few 
more dollars a month. This is almost always less expensive than paying 
for them à la carte.
 
✓ You can send or receive SMS messages only over your wireless car-
rier’s network (which is AT&T in the U.S.). In other words, SMS mes-
sages can’t be sent or received over a Wi-Fi connection.
Okay, now that we have that out of the way, let’s start with how to send SMS 
text messages. 
You send me: Sending SMS text messages
Tap the Text (SMS) icon on the Home screen to launch the Text application, 
and then tap the little pencil-and-paper icon in the top-right corner of the 
screen to start a new text message.
 
 At this point, the To field is active and awaiting your input. You can do three 
things at this point:
 
✓ If the recipient isn’t in your Contacts list, type his or her cell-phone 
number.
 
✓ If the recipient is in your Contacts list, type the first few letters of the 
name. A list of matching contacts appears. Scroll through it if necessary 
and tap the name of the contact.
 
 The more letters you type, the shorter the list becomes.

65
 Chapter 5: Texting 1, 2, 3: SMS Messages and Notes
 
✓ Tap the blue plus icon on the right side of the To field to select a name 
from your Contacts list.
There’s a fourth option if you want to compose the message first and address 
it later. Tap inside the text-entry field (the oval-shaped area just above the 
keyboard and to the left of the Send button) to activate it, and then type your 
message. When you’ve finished typing, tap the To field and use one of the 
preceding techniques to address your message.
When you have finished addressing and composing, tap the Send button to 
send your message on its merry way. And that’s all there is to it.
Being a golden receiver: Receiving SMS 
text messages
First things first. If you want to hear an alert sound when you receive an SMS 
text message, tap the Settings icon on your Home screen, tap Sounds, tap the 
New Text Message item, and then tap one of the available sounds. You can 
audition the sounds by tapping them.
 
You hear the sounds when you audition them in the Settings app, even if you 
have the Ring/Silent switch set to Silent. After you exit the Settings applica-
tion, however, you won’t hear a sound 
when an SMS message arrives if the 
Ring/Silent switch is set to Silent.
If you don’t want to hear an alert when 
an SMS message arrives, instead of tap-
ping one of the listed sounds, tap the 
first item in the list: None.
If you receive an SMS text message 
when your phone is asleep, all or part 
of the text message and the name 
of the sender appear on the Unlock 
screen when you wake your phone.
If your phone is awake and unlocked 
when an SMS text message arrives, all 
or part of the message and the name 
of the sender appear on the screen in 
front of whatever’s already there, along 
with Close and Reply buttons. At the 
same time, the Text icon on the Home 
screen displays the number of unread 
messages. You can see all of this in 
Figure 5-1.

Sender’s name
Message
Figure 5-1: What you see if your iPhone is 
awake when an SMS text message arrives.

66
Part II: The Mobile iPhone 
To read or reply to the message, tap Reply.
To read or reply to a message after you’ve tapped the Close button, tap the 
Text icon. If a message other than the one you’re interested in appears on 
the screen when you launch the Text application, tap Messages in the top-left 
corner of the screen, and then tap the recipient’s name; that person’s mes-
sages appear on the screen.
To reply to the message on the screen, 
tap the text-entry field to the left of the 
Send button, and the keyboard appears. 
Type your reply and then tap Send.
Your conversation is saved as a series of 
text bubbles. Your messages appear on 
the right side of the screen in green bub-
bles; the other person’s messages appear 
on the left in gray bubbles, as shown in 
Figure 5-2.
You can delete a conversation in two 
ways:
 
✓ If you’re viewing the conversation: 
Tap the Clear button at the top right 
of the conversation screen.
 
✓ If you’re viewing the list of text 
messages: Tap the Edit button at the 
top left of the Text Messages list, 
tap the red minus icon that appears 
to the left of the person’s name, 
and then tap the Delete button that 
appears to the right of the name.
Smart SMS tricks
Here are some more things you can do with SMS text messages:
 
✓ To send an SMS text message to someone in your Favorites or Recents 
list, tap the Phone icon on the Home screen, and then tap Favorites 
or Recents, respectively. Tap the blue > icon to the right of a name or 
number, and then scroll down and tap Text Message at the bottom of 
the Info screen.
What you said
What they said
Figure 5-2: This is what an SMS 
conversation looks like.

67
 Chapter 5: Texting 1, 2, 3: SMS Messages and Notes
 
✓ To call or e-mail someone to whom you’ve sent an SMS text message, 
tap the Text icon on the Home screen, and then tap the person’s name 
in the Text Messages list. Tap the Call button at the top of the conversa-
tion to call the person, or tap the Contact Info button and then tap an 
e-mail address to send an e-mail.
 
 You can use this technique only if the contact has an e-mail address.
 
✓ To add someone to whom you’ve sent an SMS text message to your 
Contacts list, tap the person’s name or phone number in the Text 
Messages list and then tap the Add to Contacts button.
 
✓ If an SMS message includes a URL, tap it to open that Web page in Safari.
 
✓ If an SMS message includes a phone number, tap it to call that number.
 
✓ If an SMS message includes an e-mail address, tap it to open a pre-
addressed e-mail message in Mail.
 
✓ If an SMS message includes a street address, tap it to see a map in Maps.
And that’s all there is to it. You are now an official SMS text-message maven.
Take Note of Notes
Notes is an application that creates text 
notes that you can save or send through 
e-mail. To create a note, first tap the Notes 
icon on the Home screen, and then tap the 
plus button in the top-right corner to start 
a new note. The virtual keyboard appears. 
Type the note. When you’re finished, tap 
the Done button in the top-right corner to 
save the note, as shown in Figure 5-3. (The 
Done button only appears when the virtual 
keyboard is on-screen, however, so you can’t 
see it in the figure.) 
After a note is saved, you can do the 
following :
 
✓ Tap the Notes button at the top-left 
corner of the screen to see a list of all 
your notes. When the list is on-screen, 
just tap a note to open and view it.
 
✓ Tap the left or right arrow button at the 
bottom of the screen to read the previous 
or next note.
Figure 5-3: The Notes application 
revealed.

68
Part II: The Mobile iPhone 
 
✓ Tap the letter icon at the bottom of the screen to e-mail the note using 
the Mail application (see Chapter 11 for more about Mail).
 
✓ Tap the trash can icon at the bottom of the screen to delete the note.
And that’s all there is to it. You now know everything there is to know about 
creating and managing notes with Notes.

Calendars, and Calculators, 
and Clocks, Oh My
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding the calendar’s different views and functions
▶ Calculating with your iPhone
▶ Using the clock as an alarm, a stopwatch, and a timer too
T
he iPhone is a smartphone. And as a smart device it can remind you of 
appointments, tell you the time where you live (or halfway around the 
world), and even solve simple arithmetic.
Over the next few pages we look at three of the iPhone’s core — if frankly 
unsexy — applications. Indeed, we’d venture to say none of you 
actually bought an iPhone because of its calendar, calculator, or 
clock. Just the same, it’s awfully handy having these programs 
around.
Working with the Calendar
The Calendar program lets you keep on top of your 
appointments and events (birthdays, anniversaries, and 
the like). You get there by tapping the Calendar icon on 
the Home screen. The icon is pretty smart in its own right 
because it changes daily; the day of the week and date are 
displayed.
You have three main ways to peek at your calendar: List, Day, and 
Month views. Choosing one is as simple as tapping on the List, Day, or 
Month button at the bottom of the Calendar screen. From each view, you can 
always return to the current day by tapping the Today button.
A closer look. . . .

70
Part II: The Mobile iPhone 
List view
Nothing complicated with the List view. As 
the name indicates, the List view, shown 
in Figure 6-1, presents current and future 
appointments in a list format. You can drag 
the list up or down with your finger. Or flick 
to rapidly scroll through the list. The List 
view pretty much compensates for the lack 
of a week-at-a-glance view, though Apple cer-
tainly could add such a feature, perhaps even 
by the time you read this book.
If you’re a Mac user who uses iCal, you can 
create multiple calendars and choose which 
ones to sync with your phone (as described 
in Chapter 3). What’s more, you can choose 
to display any or all of your calendars.
 
The iPhone can display the color-coding you 
assigned in iCal. Cool, huh?
 
But be careful: To-do items created in iCal are 
not synced and won’t appear on your iPhone.
Day view
The Day view, shown in Figure 6-2, reveals the appointments of a given 
24-hour period (though you’ll have to scroll up or down to see an entire day’s 
worth of entries).
Month view
By now you’re getting the hang of this. In Month view you can see appoint-
ments from January to December. In this monthly calendar view, you see 
a dot on any day that has appointments or events. Tap that day to see the 
list of activities that the dot represents. It’s just below the month in view, as 
shown in Figure 6-3.
Figure 6-1: The List view.

Adding Calendar Entries
In Chapter 3 you discover pretty much every-
thing there is to know about syncing your 
iPhone. And that includes syncing calendar 
entries from your Windows machine (via the 
likes of Microsoft Outlook) or Mac (via iCal or 
Microsoft Entourage).
Of course, in plenty of situations you’ll want to 
enter appointments on-the-fly. It’s very easy to 
add appointments directly to the iPhone:
 
1. Tap the Calendar icon at the top of the 
screen, and then tap the List, Day, or 
Month button.
 
2. Tap the + button at the upper-right 
corner of the screen.
 
 The + appears whether you are in 
List, Day, or Month view. Tapping + 
displays the Add Event screen, shown 
in Figure 6-4.
Figure 6-4: You are about to add an 
event to your iPhone.

72
Part II: The Mobile iPhone 
 
3. Tap the Title/Location field and finger-type as much (or as little) infor-
mation as you feel is necessary.
 
 Tapping displays the virtual keyboard.
 
4. Tap Save.
 
5. If your calendar entry has a start time 
or end time (or both):
 
a. Tap the Starts/Ends field.
 
b. In the bottom half of the screen 
that appears (see Figure 6-5), 
choose the time the event starts 
and then the time it ends.
 
 Use your finger to roll separate 
wheels for the date, hour, minute 
(in 5-minute intervals), and to 
specify AM or PM. It’s a little like 
manipulating one of those com-
bination bicycle locks or an old-
fashioned date stamp used with 
an inkpad.
 
c. Tap Save when you’re finished.
 
6. If you are entering a birthday or 
another all-day milestone, tap the All-
day button so that On (rather than Off) 
is showing. Then tap Save.
 
 Since the time isn’t relevant for an all-day entry, you’ll note that the bottom 
half of the screen now has wheels for just the month, day, and year.
 
7. If you are setting up a recurring entry, such as an anniversary, tap 
the Repeat window. Tap to indicate how often the event in question 
recurs, and then tap Save.
 
 The options are Every Day, Every Week, Every 2 Weeks, Every Month, 
and Every Year.
 
8. If you want to set a reminder or 
alert for the entry, tap Alert. Then 
tap on a time, and then tap Save.
 
 Alerts can be set to arrive on the 
actual date of an event, 2 days 
before, 1 day before, 2 hours before, 
1 hour before, 30 minutes before, 
15 minutes before, or 5 minutes 
before. At Alert time, you’ll hear a 
sound and see a message like the one shown in Figure 6-6.
Figure 6-5: Controlling the Starts and 
Ends fields is like manipulating a bike 
lock.
Figure 6-6: Alerts make it hard to forget.

73
 Chapter 6: Calendars, and Calculators, and Clocks, Oh My
 
 Are you the kind of person who needs an extra nudge? You can set 
another reminder by tapping on the Second Alert field.
 
9. Tap Calendar to assign the entry to a particular calendar and tap the 
calendar you have in mind (Home, Work, and so on). Then tap Save.
 
10. If you want to enter notes about the appointment or event, tap Notes. 
Type your note, and then tap Save.
 
 A virtual keyboard pops up so you can type in those notes.
 
11. Tap Done when you have finished entering everything.
 
You can choose a default Calendar by tapping Settings, tapping Mail, 
Contacts, Calendars, and by flicking the screen until the Calendar section 
appears. Tap Default Calendar and select the Calendar you want to show up 
regularly.
If you travel long distances for your job, you can also make events appear 
according to whatever time zone you selected for your calendars. In Calendar 
settings, tap Time Zone Support to turn it on, and then tap Time Zone. Type 
the time zone location on the keyboard that appears.
When Time Zone Support is turned off, events are displayed according to the 
time zone of your current location.
 
You can turn off a calendar alert by tapping Settings, tapping Sounds, and 
then making sure that the Calendar Alerts button is turned Off.
If you want to modify an existing calendar entry, tap the entry, tap Edit, and 
then make whatever changes need to be made. To wipe out a calendar entry, 
tap Edit and then tap Delete Event. You’ll get a chance to confirm your choice 
by tapping either Delete Event (again) or Cancel.
Calendar entries you create on your iPhone are synchronized with the calen-
dar you specified in the iTunes Info pane.
A pushy calendar
If you work for a company that uses Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync, calen-
dar entries and meeting invitations from coworkers can be pushed to your 
device so they show on-screen moments after they’re entered, even if they’re 
entered on computers at work.
Setting up an account to facilitate this pushing of calendar entries to your 
iPhone is a breeze, although you should check with your company’s tech 
or IT department to make sure that your employer allows it. Then follow 
these steps:

74
Part II: The Mobile iPhone 
 
1. Tap Settings.
 
2. Tap Mail, Contacts, Calendars.
 
3. Tap Add Account.
 
4. From the Add Account list shown in 
Figure 6-7, Tap Microsoft Exchange.
 
5. Fill in the appropriate e-mail address, 
username, password, and description 
in the fields provided and tap Next.
 
6. Enter your server address on the 
next screen that appears. The rest of 
the fields should be filled in with the 
e-mail address, username, and pass-
word you just entered, as shown in 
Figure 6-8. Tap Next.
 
7. Tap the On switches for all the infor-
mation types you want to synchronize 
using Microsoft Exchange, from among 
Mail, Contacts, and Calendars.
 
8. You should be good to go from here, 
although some employers may require 
you to add additional passcodes to 
safeguard company secrets.
 
If your business-issued iPhone is ever lost 
or stolen — or it turns out you’re a double-
agent working for a rival company — your 
employer’s IT administrators can remotely 
wipe your device clean.
 
If your company uses Microsoft Exchange 
2007, you won’t have to enter the address of 
your Exchange server. iPhone can determine 
it automatically.
 
Only one account taking advantage of 
Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync can be con-
figured to work on your iPhone.

Responding to meeting invitations
There’s one more important button, located just to the right of the List, Day, 
and Month buttons — but you see it only when Exchange calendar syncing is 
turned on. The Invitations button shows up if you have an invitation on your 
calendar. It’s represented by an arrow pointing downward into a half-rectangle.
Tap the Invitation button now to view your pending invitations, and then tap 
any of the items on the list to get more details.
Suppose that a meeting invitation arrives from your boss. You can see who 
else is attending the shindig, check scheduling conflicts, and more. Tap 
Accept to let the meeting organizer know you’re in, tap Decline if you’ve got 
something better to do (and aren’t worried about upsetting the person who 
signs your paycheck), or tap Maybe if you’re waiting for a better offer.
 
You can choose to receive an alert every time someone sends you an invita-
tion. In Calendar settings, tap New Invitation Alerts so that the On button in 
blue is showing.
If you take advantage of Apple’s $99-a-year MobileMe service (formerly .Mac), 
you can keep calendar entries synchronized between your iPhone and PC or 
Mac. So when you make a scheduling change on your iPhone, it’s automati-
cally updated on your computer, and vice versa. Choose MobileMe from the 
Add Account screen listed earlier in Step 4 to get started.
You learn more about configuring MobileMe when we discuss the Fetch New 
Data setting in Chapter 13.
 
Apple was grappling with some MobileMe snags as this book was being pub-
lished. We’re confident they’ll have been resolved by the time you read this.
Calculate This
Quick, what’s 3,467.8 times 982.3? Why, the answer (of course) is 
3,406,419.94.
We can solve the problem quickly thanks to the iPhone’s calculator, buried 
(until needed) under another of those Home screen icons.
Your handy iPhone calculator does just fine for adding, subtracting, multiply-
ing, and dividing. Numbers and symbols (such as a C for clear, and M+ for 
memory) are large and easy to see.

Part II: The Mobile iPhone 
But you might be thinking: “This isn’t exactly the most advanced calculator 
I’ve ever used.” And you’d be right. It can’t handle a sine or a square root, 
much less more advanced functions.
Fortunately the math whizzes at Apple were thinking right along with you. To 
see what they came up with, rotate the iPhone. As if by sleight of hand, your 
pocket calculator is now a full-fledged scientific calculator capable of tackling 
dozens of complex functions. Take a gander at both calculators in Figure 6-9.
 
 
Figure 6-9: Solving simple — and more complex — mathematical problems.
Isn’t it nice to know just how much smarter a smartphone can make you feel?
Punching the Clock
Here’s another thing you must be thinking: “So the iPhone has a clock. Big 
whoop. Doesn’t every cell phone have a clock?”
Well, yes, every cell phone does have a clock. But not every phone has a world 
clock that lets you display the time in multiple cities on multiple continents. 
And not every cell phone has an alarm, a stopwatch, and a timer to boot.
Let’s take a look at the time functions on your iPhone.

77
 Chapter 6: Calendars, and Calculators, and Clocks, Oh My
World clock
Want to know the time in Beijing or Bogota? 
Tapping on World Clock (inside the Clock 
application) lets you display the time in 
numerous cities around the globe, as shown 
in Figure 6-10.
Tap the + symbol at the upper-right corner of 
the screen and start typing a city name with 
the virtual keyboard. The moment you type 
the first letter, in fact, the iPhone displays 
a list of cities or countries that begin with 
that letter. So typing V will bring up both 
Vancouver, Canada, and Caracas, Venezuela, 
among myriad other possibilities. You can 
create clocks for as many cities as you like, 
though the times in only four cities appear in 
a single screen. To see times in other cities, 
scroll up or down.
To remove a city from the list, tap Edit, 
and then tap the red circle with the white 
 horizontal line in it to the left of the city you 
want to drop. Then tap Delete.
You can also rearrange the order of the cities displaying the time. Tap Edit, 
and then press your finger against the symbol with three  horizontal lines to 
the right of the city you want to move up or down in the list. Then drag the 
city to its new spot.
Alarm clock
Ever try to set the alarm in a hotel room? It’s remarkable how complicated 
setting an alarm can be, on even the most inexpensive clock radio. As with 
most things, the procedure is dirt simple on the iPhone:
 
1. Tap Clock on the Home screen to display the Clock application.
 
2. Tap the Alarm icon at the bottom of the screen.
 
3. Tap the + sign at the upper-right corner of the screen.
 
4. Choose the time of the alarm by rotating the wheel on the bottom half 
of the screen.
 
 This is similar to the action required to setting the time an event starts 
or ends in your calendar.
Figure 6-10: What time is it in 
Budapest?

78
Part II: The Mobile iPhone 
 
5. If you want the alarm to go off on other days, tap Repeat and tell the 
iPhone the days you want the alarm to be repeated.
 
6. Tap Sound to choose the ringtone (see Chapter 4) that will wake you 
up. You can even use the custom ringtone you created yourself.
  
 This is a matter of personal preference, but we can tell you that the 
ringtone with the appropriate name Alarm managed to wake Ed out of a 
deep sleep.
 
7. Tap Snooze to have the alarm appear on the screen accompanied by a 
Snooze button.
 
 Tap the Snooze button to shut up the alarm for 9 minutes.
 
8. If you want to call the alarm something other than, um, Alarm, tap the 
Label field and use the virtual keyboard to type another descriptor.
 
9. Tap Save when the alarm settings are to your liking.
You’ll know that an alarm has been set and activated thanks to the tiny status 
icon — surprise, surprise, it looks like a clock — that appears in the upper-
right corner of the screen.
 
An alarm takes precedence over any tracks you are listening to on the iPod. 
So songs momentarily pause when an alarm goes off and resume when you 
turn off the alarm (or press the Snooze button).
 
When your Ring/Silent switch is set to silent, your iPhone doesn’t ring, play 
alert effects, or make iPod sounds. But it will play alarms from the Clock 
application. That’s good to know when you set your phone to Silent at a 
movie or the opera. And although it seems obvious, if you want to actually 
hear an alarm, you have to make sure your iPhone’s volume is turned up.
Stopwatch
If you’re helping a loved one train for a marathon, your iPhone’s Stopwatch 
function can provide an assist. It’s accessible by tapping Stopwatch in the 
Clock application.
Just tap Start to begin the count and tap Stop at the finish line. You can also 
tap a Lap button to monitor the times between laps.

79
 Chapter 6: Calendars, and Calculators, and Clocks, Oh My
Timer
Cooking a hard-boiled egg or Thanksgiving turkey? Again, the iPhone comes 
to the rescue. Tap Timer (within the Clock app) and then rotate the hour 
and minute wheels until the time you have in mind is highlighted. Tap When 
Timer Ends to choose the ringtone that will signify that time’s up.
After you’ve set up the length of the timer, tap Start when you’re ready to 
begin. You can watch the minutes and seconds wind down on the screen if 
you have nothing better to do.
But if you’re doing anything else on the iPhone — admiring photos, say — 
you hear the ringtone and see a Timer Done message on the screen at the 
appropriate moment. Tap OK to silence the ringtone.
Now it’s time to move on to the stuff that makes the iPhone really sexy — and 
fun: songs, video, and photos.

Part III
The Multimedia 
iPhone

Your iPhone is arguably the best iPod ever 
invented. So in this part we look at the multi-
media side of your phone — audio, video, and still 
pictures, too. There has never been a phone that 
was this much fun to use; in this part we show you 
how to wring the most out of every multimedia bit 
of it.
First we explore how to enjoy listening to music, 
podcasts, and audiobooks on your iPhone. Then 
we look at some video, both literally and ﬁ gura-
tively. We start off with a quick segment about 
how to ﬁ nd good video for your iPhone, followed 
by instructions for watching video on your 
iPhone. 
Before we leave the video scene, you also see how 
to have a blast with video from the famous 
YouTube Web site, using iPhone’s built-in YouTube 
application. We wrap up this multimedia part with 
everything you always wanted to know about 
photos and iPhones: how to shoot them well, how 
to store them, how to sync them, and how to do all 
kinds of other interesting things with them.

Get in Tune(s): Audio 
on Your iPhone
In This Chapter
▶ Introducing the iPod inside your iPhone
▶ Taking control of your tunes
▶ Customizing your audio experience
A
s we mention elsewhere, your iPhone is also one heck of an iPod — 
especially when it comes to audio and video. In this chapter, we show 
you how to use your iPhone for audio; in Chapter 8 we cover video.
We start with a quick tour of the iPhone’s iPod application. Then we look 
at how to use your iPhone as an audio player. After you’re nice and 
comfy with using it this way, we show you how to customize the 
listening experience so it’s just the way you like it. Finally, we 
offer a few tips to help you get the most out of using your 
iPhone as an audio player.
We’re going to assume that you’ve synced your iPhone 
with your computer and that your iPhone contains audio 
content — songs, podcasts, or audiobooks. If you don’t 
have any audio on your iPhone yet, we humbly suggest that 
you get some (flip back to Chapter 3 and follow the instruc-
tions) before you read the rest of this chapter — or the next 
chapter, for that matter.
Okay, now that you have some audio content on your iPhone to 
play with, are you ready to rock?

Part III: The Multimedia iPhone 
Introducing the iPod inside Your iPhone
To use your iPhone as an iPod, just tap the iPod icon in the bottom-right 
corner of the Home screen. At the bottom of the screen that appears, you 
should see five icons: Playlists, Artists, Songs, Video, and More.
If you don’t see these icons, tap the Back button in the top-left corner of the 
screen (the one that looks like a little arrow pointing to the left).
Or, if you’re holding your iPhone sideways (the long edges parallel to the 
ground), rotate it 90 degrees so it’s upright (the short edges parallel to 
the ground).
 
You’ll understand why your iPhone’s orientation matters when you read the 
section on Cover Flow, which is coming up in a few pages.
Playing with playlists
Tap the Playlists icon at the bottom of the screen and a list of playlists 
appears. If you don’t have any playlists on your iPhone, don’t sweat it. Just 
know that if you had some, this is where they’d be. (Playlists let you organize 
songs around a particular theme or mood: opera arias, romantic ballads, 
British Invasion, whatever. Younger folks call ’em mixes.)
Tap a playlist and you see a list of the songs it contains. If the list is longer 
than one screen, flick upwards to scroll down. Tap a song in the list and it 
plays.
And that’s all there is to selecting and playing a song from a playlist.
Artistic license
Now let’s find and play a song by the artist’s name instead of by playlist. Tap 
the Artists icon at the bottom of the screen and a list of artists appears.
Tap an artist’s name and a list of songs by that artist appears. If the list is 
longer than one screen, flick upwards to scroll down. Tap a song in this list 
and it plays.
Are you starting to see a pattern here?

85
 Chapter 7: Get in Tune(s): Audio on Your iPhone
Song selection
Finally, let’s find a song by its title and play it. 
Tap the Songs icon at the bottom of the screen 
and a list of songs appears.
Now, chances are your list of songs is quite 
a bit longer than your lists of playlists and 
artists. So in addition to flicking upwards to 
scroll down, you can tap a letter on the right 
side of the screen to jump to songs that start 
with that letter. In Figure 7-1, for example, that 
letter is M.
Notice that those letters are extremely small, 
so unless you have very tiny fingers you may 
have to settle for a letter close to the one you 
want or tap several times before you get it 
added.
Taking Control of Your Tunes
Now that you have the basics down, here’s a look at some of the other things 
you can do when your iPhone is in its iPod mode.
Go with the (cover) flow
Finding tracks by playlist, artist, or 
song is cool, but finding them with 
Cover Flow is even cooler. Cover Flow 
lets you browse your music collection 
by its album artwork. To use Cover 
Flow, turn your iPhone sideways (that 
is, long edges parallel to the ground). 
As long as you’re not browsing or 
viewing video (and, of course, you’ve 
tapped the iPod icon on the Home 
screen so your iPhone behaves like an 
iPod), Cover Flow fills the screen, as 
shown in Figure 7-2.
Tap
Figure 7-1: Tap the M on the right 
side of the screen to jump to song 
titles that begin with M.
Play/Pause
Info
Figure 7-2: Go with the Cover Flow.

86
Part III: The Multimedia iPhone 
It’s simple to flip through your cover art in Cover Flow. All you have to do is 
drag or flick your finger left or right on the screen and the covers go flying 
by. Flick or drag quickly and the covers whiz by; flick or drag slowly and the 
covers move leisurely. Or tap a particular cover on the left or right of the cur-
rent (centered) cover and that cover jumps to the center.
Try it, you’ll like it! Now here’s how to put Cover Flow to work for you:
 
✓ To see the tracks (songs) on an album, tap the cover when it’s centered 
or tap the info button (the little i) in the lower-right corner of the screen. 
The track list appears.
 
✓ To play a track, tap its name in the list. If the list is long, scroll by drag-
ging or flicking up and down on it.
 
✓ To go back to Cover Flow, tap the title bar at the top of the track list or 
tap the little i button again.
 
✓ To play or pause the current song, tap the Play/Pause button in the 
lower-left corner.
 
If no cover art exists for an album in your collection, the iPhone displays a 
plain-looking cover decorated with a single musical note. The name of the 
album appears below this generic cover.
And that, friends, is all there is to the iPhone’s cool Cover Flow mode.
Flow’s not here right now
As you saw earlier in the chapter, when you hold your iPhone vertically (the 
short edges parallel to the ground) and tap the Playlists, Artists, or Songs 
button, you see a list instead of Cover Flow.
The controls are different depending on which way you hold your iPhone 
as well. When you hold your iPhone vertically, as shown in Figure 7-3, 
you see controls that don’t appear when you hold your iPhone sideways. 
Furthermore, the controls you see when viewing the Playlists, Artists, or 
Songs lists are slightly different from the controls you see when a song is 
playing.
Here’s how to use the controls that appear when the iPhone is vertical:
 
✓ Back button: Tap this to return to whichever list you used last — 
Playlists, Artists, or Songs.
 
✓ Switch to Track List button: Tap this to switch to a list of tracks.
 
 If you don’t see the next three controls — the Repeat button, the 
Scrubber, and the Shuffle button — tap the album cover once to make 
them appear.

87
 Chapter 7: Get in Tune(s): Audio on Your iPhone
 
✓ Repeat button: Tap once to repeat 
songs in the current album or list. 
The button turns blue. Tap it again 
to repeat the current song over 
and over again; the blue button 
displays the number 1 when it’s 
in this mode. Tap it again to turn 
it off. The button goes back to its 
original color, gray.
 
✓ Scrubber bar: Drag the little dot 
(the playhead) along the Scrubber 
bar to skip to any point within 
the song.
 
✓ Shuffle button: Tap once to 
shuffle songs and play them in 
random order. The button turns 
blue when shuffling is enabled. 
Tap it again to play songs in order 
again. The button goes back to its 
original color, gray.
 
 You can also shuffle tracks in any 
list of songs — such as playlists 
or albums — by tapping the word 
Shuffle, which appears at the top 
of the list. Regardless of whether 
the Shuffle button has been 
tapped, this technique always 
plays songs in that list in random 
order.
 
✓ Restart/Previous Track/Rewind button: Tap this once to go to the 
beginning of the track. Tap it twice to go to the start of the previous 
track in the list. Touch and hold it to rewind through the song at double 
speed.
 
✓ Play/Pause button: Tap this to play or pause the song.
 
✓ Next Track/Fast Forward button: Tap this to skip to the next track in 
the list. Touch and hold it to fast-forward through the song at double 
speed.
 
✓ Volume control: Drag the little dot left or right to reduce or increase the 
volume level.
 
If you’re using the headset included with your iPhone, you can squeeze the 
mic to pause, and squeeze it again to play. You can also squeeze it twice in 
rapid succession to skip to the next song. Sweet!

When you tap the Switch to Track List 
button, the iPhone screen and the con-
trols change, as shown in Figure 7-4. And 
here’s how to use those controls:
 
✓ Switch to Now Playing button: Tap 
this to switch to the Now Playing 
screen for the current track (refer 
to Figure 7-3).
 
✓ Rating bar: Drag across the rating 
bar to rate the current track with 
zero to five stars. The track shown 
in Figure 7-4 has a four-star rating.
The tracks are the songs in the current 
list (album, playlist, artist, and so on) 
and the current track indicator shows 
you which song is currently playing (or 
paused). Tap any song in a track list to 
play it.
And that, gentle reader, is pretty much 
all you need to know to enjoy listening 
to music (and podcasts and audiobooks, 
too) on your iPhone.
Customizing Your Audio Experience
We should cover a few more things before you move on to the video side of 
your iPhone-as-an-iPod in Chapter 8. In this section you find a bunch of stuff 
you can do to make your listening experience even better.
If you still want more . . .
If you’d prefer to browse through your audio collection by criteria other 
than playlists, artists, or songs, there is a way. That way is to tap the More 
button at the bottom-right corner of the screen. The More list appears. Tap 
a choice in the list — albums, audiobooks, compilations, composers, genres, 
or podcasts — and your audio collection is organized by your criterion.
But wait, there’s more. You can swap out the Playlists, Artists, Songs, and 
Video buttons for ones that better suit your needs. So, for example, if you 
listen to a lot of podcasts and never watch video, you can replace the Video 
button with a Podcasts button.

 Chapter 7: Get in Tune(s): Audio on Your iPhone
Here’s how:
 
1. Tap the More button at the bottom-right corner of the screen.
 
2. Tap the Edit button at the top-left corner of the screen.
 
3. Drag any button on the screen — Albums, Podcasts, Audiobooks, 
Genres, Composers, Compilations — onto the button at the bottom of 
the screen that you want it to replace.
 
4. You can also rearrange the five buttons now by dragging them to the 
left or right.
 
5. When you have everything just the way you like it, tap the Done 
button to return to the More list.
 
You can always browse your audio collection by buttons you replace this 
way by tapping the More button and choosing the item that corresponds to 
the button you replaced in the More list.
Setting preferences
You can change a few preference settings to customize your iPhone-as-an-
iPod experience.
Play all songs at the same volume level
iTunes has an option called Sound Check that automatically adjusts the 
level of songs so they play at the same volume relative to each other. That 
way, one song never blasts out your ears even if the recording level is much 
louder than that of the song before or after it. To tell the iPhone to use these 
volume settings, you first have to turn on the feature in iTunes on your com-
puter. Here’s how to do that:
 
1. Choose iTunes➪Preferences (Mac) or Edit➪Preferences (PC).
 
2. Click the Playback tab.
 
3. Select the Sound Check check box to enable it.
Now you need to tell the iPhone to use the Sound Check settings from iTunes. 
Here’s how to do that:
 
1. Tap the Settings icon on the iPhone’s Home screen.
 
2. Tap iPod in the list of settings.
 
3. Tap Sound Check to turn it on.

90
Part III: The Multimedia iPhone 
Set the audiobook playing speed
You can make audiobooks play a bit faster or slower than usual if you like. To 
do so:
 
1. Tap the Settings icon on the Home screen.
 
2. Tap iPod in the list of settings.
 
3. Tap Audiobook in the list of iPod settings.
 
4. Tap Slower or Faster to slow down or speed up audiobook playback.
Choose an equalizer setting
An equalizer increases or decreases the relative levels of specific frequencies 
to enhance the sound you hear. Some equalizer settings emphasize the bass 
notes (low end) in a song; other equalizer settings make the higher frequen-
cies more apparent. The iPhone has more than a dozen equalizer presets, 
with names such as Acoustic, Bass Booster, Bass Reducer, Dance, Electronic, 
Pop, and Rock. Each one is ostensibly tailored to a specific type of music.
The way to find out whether you prefer using equalization is to listen to 
music while trying out different settings. To do that, first start listening to a 
song you like. Then, while the song is playing, follow these steps:
 
1. Tap the Home button on the front of your iPhone.
 
2. Tap the Settings icon on the Home screen.
 
3. Tap iPod in the list of settings.
 
4. Tap EQ in the list of iPod settings.
 
5. Tap different EQ presets (Pop, Rock, R&B, Dance, and so on) and 
listen carefully to the way it changes how the song sounds.
 
6. When you find an equalizer preset you think sounds good, tap the 
Home button and you’re finished.
If you don’t like any of the presets, tap Off at the top of the EQ list to turn off 
the equalizer.
 
If you’ve set an equalizer preset for a song using the Track Info window in 
iTunes, that setting is applied automatically to the song when you sync it to 
your iPhone. That’s pretty cool. Alas, custom equalizer settings — ones you 
create in iTunes that are not presets like Rock, Pop, Bass Booster, and such — 
won’t be applied on the iPhone.

91
 Chapter 7: Get in Tune(s): Audio on Your iPhone
Set a volume limit for music (and videos)
You can instruct your iPhone to limit the loudest listening level for audio or 
video. To do so, here’s the drill:
 
1. Tap the Settings icon on the Home screen.
 
2. Tap iPod in the list of settings.
 
3. Tap Volume Limit in the list of iPod settings.
 
4. Drag the slider to adjust the maximum volume level to your liking.
 
5. (Optional) Tap Lock Volume Limit to assign a four-digit passcode to 
this setting so others can’t easily change it.
 
The Volume Limit setting only limits the volume of music and videos. It 
doesn’t apply to podcasts or audiobooks. And although it does work with 
any headset, headphones, or speakers plugged into the headset jack on 
your iPhone, it does not affect sound played through your iPhone’s internal 
speaker.
Make a playlist on your iPhone
Of course you can make playlists in iTunes and sync them with your iPhone, 
but you can also create playlists on your iPhone when you’re out and about. 
Here’s how:
 
1. Tap the iPod icon in the bottom-right corner of the Home screen.
 
2. Tap the Playlists button at the bottom of the screen.
 
3. Tap the first item in the list, On-the-Go.
 
 An alphabetical list of all the songs on your iPhone appears. To the right 
of each song is a little plus sign.
 
4. Tap the plus sign next to a song name to add the song to your 
On-the-Go playlist.
 
 To add all of these songs to your On-the-Go playlist, tap the plus sign 
next to the first item in the list, Add All Songs.
 
5. Tap the Done button in the top-right corner.
If you create an On-the-Go playlist and then sync your iPhone with your 
computer, that playlist is saved both on the iPhone and in iTunes on your 
computer. The first time you save one, it is named On-the-Go 1 automatically. 
Subsequent lists you create are auto-named On-the-Go 2, On-the-Go 3, and 
so on.

92
Part III: The Multimedia iPhone 
The playlists remain until you delete them from iTunes. To do that, select the 
playlist’s name in the source list and then press Delete or Backspace.
You can also edit your On-the-Go playlist. To do so, first tap the Playlists 
button at the bottom of the screen, tap the first item in the list, On-the-Go, 
and tap the Edit button. Then:
 
✓ To move a song up or down in the On-the-Go playlist: A little icon 
with three gray bars appears to the right of each song. Drag the icon up 
to move the song higher in the list or down to move the song lower in 
the list.
 
✓ To add more songs to the On-the-Go playlist: Tap the plus button in the 
top-left corner.
 
✓ To delete a song from the On-the-Go playlist: Tap the minus sign to the 
left of the song name. Note that deleting a song from the On-the-Go play-
list doesn’t remove the song from your iPhone.
 
✓ To clear the On-the-Go playlist of all songs: Tap the first item in the list, 
Clear Playlist.
When you’ve finished editing, tap the Done button in the top-right corner.
And that’s all you have to do to create and manage On-the-Go playlists.
Set a sleep timer
If you like to fall asleep with music playing but don’t want to leave your 
iPhone playing music all night long, you can turn on its sleep timer.
Here’s how:
  
1. Tap the Clock button on the Home screen.
 
2. Tap the Timer icon in the lower-right corner.
 
3. Set the number of hours and minutes you want the iPhone-as-an-iPod 
to play, and then tap the When Timer Ends button.
 
4. Tap the first item in the list, Sleep iPod.
 
5. Tap the Set button in the top-right corner.
 
6. Tap the big green Start button.
That’s it! After the appropriate period of time, your iPod stops playing and 
your iPhone goes to sleep.

iPhone Video: Seeing Is Believing
In This Chapter
▶ Finding videos
▶ Playing videos on your iPhone
▶ Screening YouTube
P
icture this scene: The smell of popcorn permeates the room as you and 
your family congregate to watch the latest Hollywood blockbuster. A 
motion picture soundtrack swells up. The images on the screen are stunning. 
And all eyes are fixed on the iPhone.
Okay, here comes the reality check. The iPhone is not going to replace a wall-
sized high-definition television as the centerpiece of your home  theater. 
But we do want to emphasize that with its glorious widescreen 
31/2-inch  display — the best we’ve seen on a handheld device — 
watching movies and other videos on the iPhone can be a 
 cinematic delight.
Let’s get on with the show!
Finding Stuff to Watch
The video you’ll watch on the iPhone generally falls into 
one of four categories:
 
✓ Movies, TV shows, and music videos that reside in 
iTunes software on your PC or Mac that you synchro-
nize with your iPhone. (For more on synchronization, refer 
to Chapter 3.) You can watch these by tapping the iPod icon at 
the bottom of the Home screen and then tapping Videos.

94
Part III: The Multimedia iPhone 
 
 Apple’s own iTunes Store features dedicated sections for purchas-
ing episodes of TV shows (from The Larry Sanders Show to Dora the 
Explorer) and movies (such as Atonement or Ratatouille). Typical price 
as of this writing is $1.99 per episode for TV shows and $9.99 to $14.99 
for feature films.
 
 You can also rent some movies, typically for $2.99 or $3.99. You’ll have 
30 days to begin watching a rented flick, and 24 hours to finish once 
you’ve started. Such films appear in their own Rented Movies section on 
the video list, which you get to by tapping iTunes and then Videos. The 
number of days before your rental expires is displayed.
Are we compatible?
Sidebars in this book are considered optional 
reading, but we secretly hope you’ll digest every 
word because you may discover something, or 
be entertained, or both. But you can safely skip 
the material contained herein — no matter how 
much you want to curry favor with your teach-
ers, um, authors.
Still, we present this list of video formats sup-
ported by the iPhone as a courtesy to those 
with geek aspirations (you know who you are). 
And just to point out how absurd the world 
of tech can sound sometimes — even from a 
consumer-friendly company such as Apple — 
we are quoting this passage from Apple’s Web 
site verbatim:
Video formats supported: H.264 video, up to 1.5 
Mbps, 640 by 480 pixels, 30 frames per second, 
Low-Complexity version of the H.264 Baseline 
Profile with AAC-LC audio up to 160 Kbps, 48kHz, 
stereo audio in .m4v, .mp4, and .mov file formats; 
H.264 video, up to 2.5 Mbps, 640 by 480 pixels, 
30 frames per second, Baseline Profile up to 
Level 3.0 with AAC-LC audio up to 160 Kbps, 
48kHz, stereo audio in .m4v, .mp4, and .mov file 
formats; MPEG-4 video, up to 2.5 Mbps, 640 by 
480 pixels, 30 frames per second, Simple Profile 
with AAC-LC audio up to 160 Kbps, 48kHz, stereo 
audio in .m4v, .mp4, and .mov file formats.
Got all that? Here’s the takeaway message: 
The iPhone works with a whole bunch of video, 
although not everything you’ll want to watch 
will make it through. And you may not know if 
it will play until you try. Indeed, several Internet 
video standards — notably Adobe Flash, Java, 
Real, and Windows Media Video — were not 
supported when this book was in production. 
And we should probably point out that some 
video that will play on an iPod Classic or iPod 
nano might not play in the iPhone for technical 
reasons we won’t bore you with right now. (This 
may have changed by the time you read this.)
Then again, with the appropriate utility software, 
you may be able to convert some non-working 
video to an iPhone-friendly format. If something 
doesn’t play now, it may well in the future — 
because Apple has the capability to upgrade 
the iPhone through software.

✓ The boatload of video podcasts, just about all of them free, featured in 
the iTunes Store. Podcasts started out as another form of Internet radio, 
although instead of listening to live streams, you downloaded files onto 
your computer or iPod to take in at your leisure. There are still lots of 
audio podcasts, but the focus here is on video.
 
✓ Homegrown videos from the popular YouTube Internet site. Apple 
obviously thinks highly of YouTube because it devoted a dedicated 
Home screen icon to the site. More on YouTube’s special place in the 
iPhone later in this chapter.
 
✓ The movies you’ve created in iMovie software or other software on 
the Mac or, for that matter, other programs on the PC. Plus all the 
other videos you may have downloaded from the Internet.
 
You may have to prepare these videos so that they’ll play on your iPhone. 
To do so, highlight the video in question after it resides in your iTunes 
library. Go to the Advanced menu in iTunes, and click Convert Selection for 
iPod/iPhone.
For more on compatibility, check out the “Are we compatible?” sidebar in 
this chapter (but read it at your own risk).
Playing Video
Now that you know what you want to watch, 
here’s how to watch it:
 
1. On the Home screen, tap the iPod icon 
and then tap the Videos icon.
 
 Your list of videos pops up. As shown in 
Figure 8-1, videos are segregated by cat-
egory (Movies, TV Shows, Music Videos, 
Podcasts) and accompanied by thumb-
nail images and the length of the video.
 
2. Flick your finger to scroll through the 
list, and then tap the video you want to 
play.
 
 You’ll see a spinning circle for just a 
moment and then the video will begin.
 
3. Turn the device to its side because the 
iPhone plays video only in landscape, 
or widescreen, mode.
 
 For movies, this is a great thing. You can 
watch flicks as the filmmaker intended, in a cinematic aspect ratio.
Figure 8-1: Choosing the video to 
watch.

4. Now that the video is playing, tap the screen to display the controls 
shown in Figure 8-2.
 
5. Tap the controls that follow as needed:
 
• To play or pause the video, tap the Play/Pause button.
 
• Drag the volume slider to the right to raise the volume and to the 
left to lower it. Alternatively, use the physical Volume buttons to 
control the audio levels. If the video is oriented properly, the but-
tons will be to the bottom left of the iPhone.

• Tap the Restart/Rewind button to restart the video or tap and hold 
the same button to rewind.
 
• Tap and hold the Fast Forward button to advance the video. You can 
skip ahead also by dragging the playhead along the Scrubber bar.
 
• Tap the Scale button to toggle between filling the entire screen 
with video or fitting the video to the screen. Alternatively, you can 
double-tap the video to go back and forth between fitting and fill-
ing the screen.

97
 Chapter 8: iPhone Video: Seeing Is Believing
 
 Here’s the distinction between fitting and filling. Fitting the video 
to the screen displays the film in its theatrical aspect ratio. But you 
may see black bars above or below the video (or to its sides), which 
some people don’t like. On the other hand, filling the entire screen 
with the video may crop or trim the sides or top of the picture, so 
you aren’t seeing the complete scene that the director shot.
 
6. Tap the screen again to make the controls go away (or just wait for 
them to go away on their own).
 
7. Tap Done when you’ve finished watching (you’ll have to summon the 
controls back if they’re not already present).
 
 You return to the iPhone’s video menu screen.
To delete a video manually, swipe left or right over the video listing. Then tap 
the small red Delete button that materializes. To confirm your intention, tap 
the larger Delete button that appears.
 
Sometimes you want to hear a song from a music video but don’t want to 
watch it. Instead of tapping the Videos icon to grab that selection, choose the 
ditty by tapping the Songs or Artists icon instead.
Hey You, It’s YouTube
YouTube has come to define video sharing on the Internet. The wildly popu-
lar site, now owned by Google, has become so powerful that American presi-
dential hopefuls and even politicians in other countries campaign and hold 
debates there. As you might imagine, YouTube has also generated contro-
versy. The site has been banned in some foreign countries. And Viacom sued 
YouTube for more than $1 billion over alleged copyright infringements. (We’ll 
leave that fight to the lawyers.)
All the while, of course, YouTube staked a humongous claim on mainstream 
culture. That’s because YouTube is, well, about you and us and our pets and 
so on. It is the cyberdestination, as YouTube boldly proclaims, to “Broadcast 
Yourself.”
Apple has afforded YouTube its own cherished icon on the Home screen. 
Somewhere north of 50 million videos are available on the iPhone, pretty 
much the complete YouTube catalog.
 
The back catalog of YouTube videos was converted to the H.264 video-
 compression standard that the iPhone, the iPod Touch (and another Apple 
product called Apple TV) can recognize.

98
Part III: The Multimedia iPhone 
As with other videos, you can tap the screen when a YouTube video plays to 
bring up hidden video controls. Many of these controls are identical to the 
controls in Figure 8-2. But as Figure 8-3 shows, YouTube displays special con-
trols of its own, notably for adding bookmarks and sending e-mail links of the 
video you’re watching.

Hunting for YouTube gems
So where exactly do YouTubers find the videos that will offer them a bliss-
ful, albeit brief, respite from the rest of their day? By tapping on any of the 
 following:
 
✓ Featured: Videos recommended by YouTube’s own staffers.
 
✓ Most Viewed: What the YouTube community is watching. Tap All to see 
the most watched YouTube videos of all time. Tap Today or This Week 
to check out the videos most currently in vogue.
 
✓ Bookmarks: After stumbling on a video you like, bookmark it by tapping 
the Bookmark control.
 
✓ Search: Tap the Search icon, and then tap the blank YouTube search field 
at the top of the screen. Up pops one of the iPhone’s virtual keyboards. 
Type a search phrase and then tap the Search button to generate results. 
(In Figure 8-4, we typed Steve Jobs.)

99
 Chapter 8: iPhone Video: Seeing Is Believing
 
✓ More: Tapping More leads to more but-
tons or icons. As in those that follow. . . .
 
✓ Most Recent: Newly submitted videos.
 
✓ Top Rated: The people’s choice. 
YouTube’s audience chooses the best.
 
✓ History: Videos you recently viewed.
 
Only four YouTube icons (besides the More 
button) appear at the bottom of the screen 
at any one time. If you’d prefer a different 
button than one of the four shown — Top 
Rated instead of Bookmarks, say — you can 
make it one of your Fab Four icons.
To change the icons shown on that first 
YouTube screen, tap More and then tap 
Edit. Then simply drag your preferred icon 
(Top Rated in this example) over the one 
you want to relegate to the YouTube bench 
(Bookmarks in this case). You can also 
rearrange the order of the icons by dragging 
them left or right.
While the movie you’ve selected is downloading — and how fast it arrives 
depends on your network coverage from AT&T or Wi-Fi, as discussed in 
greater detail in Chapter 10 — you see a black-and-gray screen with video 
controls and the YouTube logo. This screen is shown in Figure 8-5. The con-
trols disappear when the movie starts playing.

Part III: The Multimedia iPhone 
Sharing YouTube videos
We were as enthralled as that harshest of critics Simon Cowell was by 
Paul Potts, the British mobile-phone worker turned opera singer. His star 
turn on the American Idol-like Britain’s Got Talent has been immortalized 
on YouTube by millions.
You can share such a video as you are watching it, by tapping the E-mail 
button (refer to Figure 8-3). When you do so, one of the iPhone’s virtual key-
boards pops up. iPhone has already filled in the e-mail subject line with the 
name of the video. And the body of the message is populated with a link to 
the video on YouTube. All you need to do is fill in the To field with the e-mail 
address of the person you are sending the link to along with any additional 
comments.
Alternatively, from the list of videos, tap the blue button with the right-
pointing arrow to see all sorts of details on a particular video. You’ll see a 
description of the video, the number of people who viewed it, the date it was 
added, and other information. From there, tap the Share button to bring up 
the e-mail program described in the preceding paragraph.
Restricting YouTube usage
If you’ve given an iPhone to your kid or someone who works for you, you may 
not want that person spending time watching YouTube videos. You want him or 
her to do something more productive like homework or the quarterly budget.
That’s where new parental (or might we say “Mean Boss”) restrictions come in. 
Please note that the use of this iron-fist tool can make you really unpopular.
Tap Settings, tap General, and tap Restrictions. Then tap Enable Restrictions. 
You’ll be asked to establish or enter a previously established passcode. 
Twice. Having done so, tap YouTube so that the Off button rather than the 
On button is what’s showing. (You’ll notice you can also prevent access to 
explicit content, the Safari browser, iTunes, and the App Store.)
Now, when you return to the Home screen, the YouTube icon is missing in 
action. Same goes for any other restricted activities. To restore YouTube 
or other privileges, go back into Restrictions, and tap Disable Restrictions. 
You’ll have to re-enter your passcode.
 
These restrictions can also be applied to iTunes, Safari, and more as you see 
when we further delve into Settings (see Chapter 13).
With that, let’s roll the closing credits to this chapter.

amera phones may outsell dedicated digital cameras nowa-
days, but with relatively few exceptions, they’re rather 
mediocre picture takers. Come to think of it, most mobile 
phones don’t show off digital images all that well either.
Of course, most mobile phones aren’t iPhones.
The device you have recently purchased (or are lusting 
after) is a pretty spectacular photo viewer. And though 
its built-in digital camera isn’t the one we’d rely on for 
snapping pictures during an African safari, say, or even 
Junior’s fast-paced soccer game, the iPhone in your steady 
hands can produce perfectly acceptable photos.
Over the next few pages, you discover how best to exploit the 
iPhone’s camera. We then move on to the real magic — making 
the digital photos that reside on the iPhone come alive — whether 
you imported them from your computer or captured them with the iPhone’s 
camera.

Part III: The Multimedia iPhone 
Taking Your Best Shot
Like many applications on the iPhone, you’ll find the Camera application icon 
on the Home screen. Unless you’ve moved things around, it’s positioned on 
the upper row of icons all the way to the right and adjacent to its next-of-kin, 
the Photos icon. We’ll be tapping both icons throughout this chapter.
Might as well snap an image now:
 
1. Tap the Camera icon on the Home screen.
 
 This tap turns the iPhone into the rough equivalent of a Kodak 
Instamatic, minus the film and flash, of course.
 
2. Keep your eyes fixed on the iPhone’s display.
 
 The first thing you’ll notice on the screen is something resembling a 
closed camera shutter. But that shutter opens in about a second, reveal-
ing a window into what the camera lens sees. In case you were wonder-
ing, the lens is hiding behind the small foxhole at the top-left corner of 
the back of the iPhone. (The position of the camera lens is shown in 
Chapter 1, Figure 1-3.)
 
3. Aim the camera at whatever you want to shoot, using the iPhone’s 
brilliant 31/2-inch display as your viewfinder.
 
 We’ve been marveling at the display throughout this book; the camera 
application gives us another reason to do so.
 
4. When you’re satisfied with what’s in the 
frame, tap the camera icon at the bottom of 
the screen (see Figure 9-1) to snap the 
picture.
 
 
Be careful. The Camera icon is directly 
above the Home button. We’ve seen more 
than one iPhone user erroneously hit the 
Home button instead.
 
 You’ll experience momentary shutter lag, so be sure to remain still. 
When the shutter reopens, you see the image you have just shot, but 
just for a blink. The screen again functions as a viewfinder so that you 
can capture your next image.
 
 And that’s it; you’ve snapped your very first iPhone picture.
 
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 to capture additional images.
 
If you position the iPhone sideways while snapping an image, the picture is 
saved in landscape mode.

 Chapter 9: You Oughta Be in Pictures
There are a couple more things to keep in mind while snapping pictures with 
the iPhone.
In our experience, the iPhone camera button is super-sensitive. We have acci-
dentally taken a few rotten snapshots because of that. So be careful; a gentle 
tap is all that’s required to snap an image.
 
If you have trouble keeping the camera steady, try this trick. Instead of tap-
ping the Camera icon at the bottom of the screen (as suggested previously 
in Step 4), keep your finger pressed against the icon and only release it when 
you’re ready to snap an image.
Importing Pictures
You needn’t use only the iPhone’s digital camera to get pictures onto the 
device, of course, and in most cases, we suspect that you won’t. Instead, you 
can synchronize photos from a PC or Macintosh using the Photos tab in the 
Tasty pixels and other digital camera treats
The iPhone is a 2-megapixel digital camera. And 
if you’ve been shopping for a digital camera of 
any type, you are already aware that mega-
pixels are marketed like chocolate chips: You 
know, the more of them, the tastier the cookie, 
or (in the case of digital photography) the better 
the camera. But that may not always be true. 
The number of megapixels counts, for sure, but 
so do a bevy of other factors — including lens 
quality and shutter lag.
The important thing to remember about mega-
pixels is that they are a measure of a cam-
era’s resolution, or picture sharpness, which 
becomes particularly important to folks who 
want to blow up prints well beyond snapshot 
size. For example, you’d probably want at least 
a 4-megapixel standalone digital camera if you 
hope to print decent 8-by-10-inch or larger 
photos.
Which brings us back to the iPhone. From a 
camera-phone perspective, 2 megapixels is 
still considered fairly decent, although you can 
certainly find more and more cell phones with a 
higher megapixel count. Still, we figure most of 
you will be more than satisfied with the pictures 
you take with the iPhone, as long as you keep 
your expectations in check and don’t expect to 
produce poster-size images.
We’re obliged to point out, however, that the 
digital camera in the iPhone lacks some features 
found on rival camera phones, notably a flash and 
the capability to shoot short video clips. (We are 
hoping a third-party developer may add this video 
functionality through the App Store discussed in 
Chapter 14.) And the iPhone has no advanced 
photo-editing features.
All that said, those other camera phones can’t 
hold a candle to the iPhone when it comes to 
showing off those images, as the rest of this 
chapter proves. The iPhone’s high-resolution 
480-x-320 screen — yep, it’s measured in pixels 
— is simply stunning.

Part III: The Multimedia iPhone 
iTunes iPhone page, which is described in Chapter 3. (The assumption here 
is that you already know how to get pictures onto your computer.)
Quickie reminder: On a Mac, you can sync photos via iPhoto software version 
4.03 or later and Aperture. And on a PC, you can sync with Adobe Photoshop 
Album 2.0 or later and Adobe Photoshop Elements 3.0 or later. Alternatively, 
with both computers, you can sync with any folder containing pictures.
When the iPhone is connected to your computer, click the Photos tab in 
the iTunes iPhone page. Then click the appropriate check boxes to specify 
the pictures and photos you want to synchronize. Or choose All Photos and 
Albums if you have enough storage on the iPhone to accommodate them.
Syncing pictures is a two-way process, so photos captured with the iPhone’s 
digital camera can also end up in the photo library on your computer.
 
Mac users: Connecting the iPhone with photos in the Camera Roll usually 
launches iPhoto in addition to iTunes.
Where Have All My Pictures Gone?
So where exactly do your pictures hang out 
on the iPhone? The ones you snapped on 
iPhone end up in a photo album appropri-
ately dubbed the Camera Roll. Of course, the 
photos you imported are readily available 
too (and grouped in the same albums they 
were on the computer). We’ll show you not 
only where they are, but how to display them 
and share them with others — and how to 
dispose of the duds that don’t measure up to 
your lofty photographic standards.
So get ready to literally get your fingers 
on the pix (without having to worry about 
smudging them):
 
1a. From the Camera application, tap the 
Camera Roll icon (refer to Figure 9-1).
 
 The shutter closes for just an instant 
and is replaced by the screen depicted 
in Figure 9-2, which shows thumbnail 
images of the complete roll of pictures you’ve shot with the iPhone. This 
is the Camera Roll.
Figure 9-2: Your pictures at a glance.

105
 Chapter 9: You Oughta Be in Pictures
 
1b. Alternatively, you can tap the Photos icon on the Home screen, and 
then tap Camera Roll or any other album in the list of Photo Albums.
 
 Using the method described in Step 1a, you can access only the Camera 
Roll. Using the method described in Step 1b, you can access the Camera 
Roll and all your other photo albums.
 
2. Browse through the thumbnail images in the album until you find the 
picture you want to display.
 
 If the thumbnail you have in mind doesn’t appear on this screen, flick 
your finger up or down to scroll through the pictures rapidly or use a 
slower dragging motion to pore through the images more deliberately.
 
3. Tap the appropriate thumbnail.
 
 The picture you’ve selected fills the entire screen.
 
4. Tap the screen again.
 
 The picture controls appear, as 
shown in Figure 9-3. We discuss 
what these do later.
 
5. To make the controls disappear, 
tap the screen again, or just wait 
a few seconds and they’ll go away 
on their own.
 
6. To transform the iPhone back into 
a picture-taker rather than a 
picture-viewer, make sure the pic-
ture controls are displayed and 
then tap the Camera icon at the 
upper right.
 
 Note that this option is available 
only if you arrived at the Camera 
Roll from the Camera application. 
If you didn’t, you have to back out 
of this application altogether and 
tap the Home button and then the 
Camera application icon to call the 
iPhone’s digital camera back into 
duty.
 
7. To return to the thumbnails view 
of your Camera Roll or the thumb-
nails for any of your other albums, 
make sure the picture controls are 
displayed. Then tap the Camera 
Roll button at the upper left.

albums if you’re trying to return to that collection of pictures instead.
Admiring Pictures
Photographs are meant to be seen, of course, not buried in the digital equiva-
lent of a shoebox. And the iPhone affords you some neat ways to manipulate, 
view, and share your best photos.
You already know (from the preceding section) how to find a photo and view 
it full-screen and bring up picture controls. But you can do a lot of maneu-
vering of your pictures without summoning those controls. Here are some 
options:
 
✓ Skipping ahead or viewing the previous picture: Flick your finger left 
or right, or tap the left or right arrow control.
 
✓ Landscape or portrait: The iPhone’s wizardry (or more specifically, the 
device’s accelerometer sensor) is at work. When you turn the iPhone 
sideways, the picture automatically reorients itself from portrait to land-
scape mode, as the images in Figure 9-4 show. Pictures shot in landscape 
mode fill the screen when you rotate the iPhone. Rotate the device back 
to portrait mode, and the picture readjusts accordingly.
 
✓ Zoom: Double-tap to zoom in on an image and make it larger. Do so again 
to zoom out and make it smaller. Alternatively, take your thumb and index 
finger and pinch to zoom in, or un-pinch the photo to zoom out.
 
✓ Pan and scroll: This cool little feature is practically guaranteed to make 
you the life of the party. Once you’ve zoomed in on a picture, drag it 
around the screen with your finger. Besides impressing your friends, you 
can bring the part of the image you most care about front and center. 
That’ll let you zoom in on Fido’s adorable face as opposed to, say, the 
unflattering picture of the person holding the dog in his or her lap.

 Chapter 9: You Oughta Be in Pictures
Launching Slideshows
Those of us who store a lot of photographs on computers are familiar with 
running slideshows of those images. It’s a breeze to replicate the experience 
on the iPhone:
 
1. Choose your Camera Roll or another album from the Photo Albums list.
 
 To do so, tap the Photos icon from the Home screen or tap the Camera 
Roll button in the Camera application.
 
2. If you see the Play button at the bottom of the thumbnails screen, tap 
it and you’re finished.
 
3. If you don’t see the Play button at the bottom of the thumbnails screen, 
tap a thumbnail to choose a photo, and then tap the Play button.
 
 You may have to tap the picture a second time to bring up the Play button.
Enjoy the show.
Special slideshow effects
You can alter the length of time each slide is shown, change the transition 
effects between pictures, and display images in random order. Here’s how.
From the Home screen, tap Settings and then scroll down and tap Photos. 
Then tap any of the following to make changes:
 
✓ Play Each Slide For: You have five choices (2 seconds, 3 seconds, 
5 seconds, 10 seconds, 20 seconds). When you’re finished, tap the 
Photos button to return to the main Settings screen for Photos.
 
✓ Transition: This is the effect you see when you move from one slide 
to the next. Again, there are five choices (cube, dissolve, ripple, wipe 
across, wipe down). Why not try them all to see what you like? Tap the 
Photos button when you’re finished.
 
✓ Repeat: If this option is turned on, the slideshow continues to loop 
until you stop it. If it’s turned off, the slide show for your Camera Roll 
or album plays just once. The Repeat control may be counterintuitive 
for some. If Off is showing, tap it to turn on the Repeat function. If On is 
showing, tap it to turn off the Repeat function.
 
✓ Shuffle: Turning this feature on plays slides in random order. As with 
the Repeat feature, tap Off to turn on shuffle or tap On to turn off 
random playback.
Tap the Home button to leave Settings and return to the Home screen.

Part III: The Multimedia iPhone 
Adding music to your slideshow
Ed loves backing up slideshows with Sinatra, Sarah Vaughan, or Gershwin, among 
numerous other artists. Bob loves using Beatles songs or stately classical music.
Adding music to a slideshow couldn’t be easier. Just tap iPod and begin play-
ing a song. Then return to the Photo application to start up a slideshow as 
described in the beginning of the “Launching Slideshows” section.
Deleting pictures
We told a tiny fib by intimating that photographs are meant to be seen. We 
should have amended that by saying that some pictures are meant to be 
seen. Others, well . . . you can’t get rid of them fast enough. Fortunately, the 
iPhone makes it a cinch to bury the evidence:
 
1. From the Camera Roll, tap the objectionable photograph.
 
2. Tap to display the picture controls, provided they’re not already displayed.
 
3. Tap the trash can icon.
 
4. Tap Delete Photo (or Cancel if you change your mind).
 
 The photo gets sucked into the trash can and mercifully disappears.
More (Not So) Stupid Picture Tricks
You can take advantage of the photos on the 
iPhone in a few more ways. In each case you 
tap the picture and make sure the picture 
controls are displayed. Then tap the icon at 
the bottom left (the one that looks like an 
arrow trying to escape from a rectangle). That 
displays the four choices shown in Figure 9-5. 
Here’s what they do:
 
✓ Use as Wallpaper: The default back-
ground image on the iPhone when you 
unlock the device is a gorgeous view of 
Earth. Dramatic though it may be, you 
probably have an even better photo-
graph to use as the iPhone’s wallpaper. 
A picture of your spouse, your kids, or 
your pet, perhaps?
Figure 9-5: Look at what else I can do!

109
 Chapter 9: You Oughta Be in Pictures
 
 When you tap the Use as Wallpaper 
button, you see what the present image 
looks like as the iPhone’s background 
picture. And as Figure 9-6 shows, you’re 
given the opportunity to move the 
picture around and resize it, through 
the now familiar action of dragging or 
pinching against the screen with your 
fingers. When you’re satisfied with what 
the wallpaper will look like, tap the Set 
Wallpaper button. Per usual, you also 
have the option to tap Cancel. (You 
can find out more about wallpaper in 
Chapter 13.)
 
✓ Email Photo: Some photos are so pre-
cious that you just have to share them 
with family members and friends. When 
you tap Email Photo, the picture is auto-
matically embedded in the body of an 
outgoing e-mail message. Use the virtual 
keyboard to enter the e-mail addresses, 
subject line, and any additional comments you’d like to add. You know, 
something profound like, “Isn’t this a great-looking photo?” (Check out 
Chapter 11 for more info on using e-mail.)
 
 Alas, Apple isn’t directly supporting picture messaging through what’s 
called MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service) as we write this. By the time 
you read this, however, it’s quite possible the capability will be included 
in some programs in the App Store.
 
✓ Assign to Contact: If you assign a picture to someone in your Contacts 
list, this image pops up when you receive a call from that person. To 
make it happen, tap Assign to Contact. Your list of contacts appears on 
the screen. Scroll up or down the list to find the person who matches 
the picture of the moment. As with the wallpaper example, you can drag 
and resize the picture to get it just right. Then tap Set Photo.
 
 As you may recall from Chapter 4, you can also assign a photo to a con-
tact by starting out in Contacts. As a refresher, start by tapping Phone 
and then tapping Contacts. From Contacts, choose the person, tap Edit, 
and then tap Add Photo. At that point, you can take a new picture with 
the iPhone’s digital camera or select an existing portrait from one of 
your onboard picture albums.
Figure 9-6: Beautifying the iPhone 
with wallpaper.

Part III: The Multimedia iPhone 
 
 To change the picture you’ve assigned to a person, tap his or her name 
in the Contacts list, tap Edit, and then tap the person’s thumbnail pic-
ture, which also carries the label Edit. From there, you can take another 
photo with the iPhone’s digital camera, select another photo from one of 
your albums, edit the photo you’re already using (by resizing and drag-
ging it to a new position), or delete the photo.
 
✓ Send To MobileMe: If you’re a member of Apple’s $99-a-year MobileMe 
service (formerly .Mac), you can publish a photo album in the MobileMe 
Gallery. Tap the Send To MobileMe control and tap the appropriate 
Gallery album to which you want to add the picture. Enter the title of 
the photo in the subject heading of the e-mail message box that appears. 
You also have to check an Album Setting box in the Gallery that has a 
strangely worded label: Adding of Photos via e-mail or iPhone.
 
Before leaving this photography section, we want to steer you to the iPhone 
App Store, which we explore in greater depth in Chapter 14. As of this writing, 
more than two dozen photography-related applications, many free, are avail-
able. These apps come from a variety of sources, including Pangea Software’s 
Pangea VR (a utility for viewing interactive panoramas) and Connected Flow’s 
Exposure (putting the popular Flickr service in your pocket.)
We also want to point out that many picture apps take advantage of the 
iPhone’s location smarts. Pictures can be geotagged with the location in 
which they were shot. The first few times you use the iPhone’s Camera appli-
cation, it asks for your permission to use your current location. Similarly, 
third-party apps ask if it’s okay to use your location. Later on, you might plot 
a picture’s location on a map or use geotagged images to see where friends 
or like-minded individuals are hanging out.
You have just passed Photography 101 on the iPhone. We trust the course-
work was a, forgive the pun, snap.

Part IV
The Internet 
iPhone

T
he commercials for the iPhone say that it pro-
vides you with the real Internet — and it does. 
So this part looks at the Internet components of 
your phone, starting with a chapter covering the 
best Web browser ever to grace a handheld 
device, Safari. We reveal how to take advantage of 
links and bookmarks and how to open multiple 
Web pages at the same time. We show you how to 
run a Web search on an iPhone. And we spend 
time discussing EDGE, 3G, and Wi-Fi — the wire-
less networks that are compatible with the device.
Then we visit the Mail program and see how easy 
it is to set up e-mail accounts and send and 
receive real honest-to-goodness e-mail messages 
and attachments.
Finally, we examine three superb Web-enabled 
applications. In Maps, you determine the busi-
nesses and restaurants you’d like to visit, get driv-
ing directions and the trafﬁ c en route, and take 
advantage of the iPhone’s capability to ﬁ nd you. In 
Weather, you get the forecast for all the cities you 
live in or plan on visiting. And in Stocks, you can 
get the lowdown on how well the equities in your 
portfolio are performing.

“T
he Internet in your pocket.”
That’s what Apple promised the iPhone would bring to the 
public when the product was announced in January 2007. 
Steve Jobs & Co. has come tantalizingly close to delivering 
on that pledge.
For years, the cell-phone industry has been offering some 
sort of watered-down mobile version of the Internet, but 
the approaches have fallen far short of what you’ve come 
to experience sitting in front of a computer.
Apple, however, has managed for the most part to replicate 
the real-deal Internet with the iPhone. Web pages look like 
Web pages on a Windows PC or Macintosh, right down to 
swanky graphics and pictures — and at least some of the video.
In this chapter, you find out how to navigate through cyberspace on 
your iPhone.

Living on the EDGE
You can’t typically make or receive phone calls 
on a wireless phone without tapping into a cel-
lular network. And you can’t prowl the virtual 
corridors of cyberspace (or send e-mail) on 
a mobile phone without accessing a wireless 
data network. In the U.S., the iPhone works with 
Wi-Fi, AT&T’s EDGE, and AT&T’s 3G. (It also 
works with another wireless technology called 
Bluetooth, but that serves a different purpose 
and is addressed in Chapter 13.) The iPhone 
also works with a data network called GPRS.
The iPhone automatically hops onto the fast-
est available network, which is almost always 
Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi is the friendly moniker applied to 
the far geekier 802.11 designation. And “eight-
oh-two-dot-eleven” (as it is pronounced) is fol-
lowed by a letter, typically (but not always) b, g, 
or n. So you’ll see it written as 802.11b, 802.11g, 
and so on. The letters relate to differing techni-
cal standards that have to do with the speed 
and range you can expect out of the Wi-Fi con-
figuration. But we certainly wouldn’t have you 
lose any sleep over this if you haven’t boned up 
on this geeky alphabet.
For the record, the iPhone adheres to 802.11b 
and 802.11g standards, which means it works 
with most common Internet routers available 
to the masses and most public and private 
Internet hotspots, found at airports, colleges, 
coffeehouses, and elsewhere. If you have to 
present a password to take advantage of a for-
fee hotspot, you can enter it via the iPhone’s 
virtual keyboard.
The problem with Wi-Fi is that it is far from 
ubiquitous, which leads us right back to EDGE 
or 3G. If you’re ever on a million-dollar game 
show and have to answer the question, EDGE 
is shorthand for Enhanced Datarate for GSM 
Evolution. It’s based on the global GSM phone 
standard.
Meanwhile, 3G stands for third generation; 
3G Web sites typically download two times 
faster than EDGE in our experience, and some-
times faster than that. But again, Wi-Fi down-
loads are even zippier.
The bottom line is this: Depending on where you 
live, work, or travel, you may feel like you are 
teetering on the EDGE in terms of acceptable 
Internet coverage, especially if Wi-Fi and/or 
true 3G are beyond your reach. We’ve used the 
iPhone in areas where Web pages load really 
slowly, not-so-vaguely reminiscent of dial-up 
telephone modems for your computer.
You may wonder why Apple and AT&T chose 
EDGE for the iPhone in the first place? One 
reason was that EDGE blanketed a good part 
of the country, whereas 3G’s “footprint” was 
far smaller. And the 3G networks also hog more 
power than EDGE, putting a serious crimp on 
the iPhone’s battery life. Of course, Wi-Fi can 
put strains on a battery too. Finally, 3G networks 
weren’t standardized until pretty far into the 
iPhone’s development. Even now, in our expe-
rience, Internet coverage can be a bit flaky.

 Chapter 10: Going On a Mobile Safari
Surfin’ Dude
A version of Apple’s Safari Web browser is a major reason the Net is the Net 
on the iPhone. Safari for the Mac, and (more recently) for Windows, is one of 
the best Web browsers in the computer business. And in our view it has no 
rival as a cell-phone browser.
Exploring the browser
It is worth starting our cyber-
expedition with a quick tour 
of the Safari browser. Take a 
gander at Figure 10-1: Not all 
the browser controls found 
on a PC or Mac are present. 
Still, the iPhone’s Safari has a 
familiar look and feel. We get 
to these and other controls 
throughout this chapter.
Before plunging in, we recom-
mend a little detour. Read the 
“Living on the EDGE” sidebar 
to find out more about the 
wireless networks that let you 
surf the Web on the iPhone in 
the first place.
Blasting off into 
cyberspace
So, we’ve told you how great 
Web pages look on the iPhone 
and you’re eager to get going. 
We won’t hold you back much 
longer.
When you start by tapping 
the address field, the virtual 
keyboard appears. You may 
notice one thing about the keyboard right off the bat. Because so many 
Web addresses end with the suffix .com (pronounced “dotcom”), the virtual 
keyboard has a dedicated .com key. For other common Web suffixes, such 
as .edu, .net, and .org, press and hold the .com key and choose the relevant 
domain type.

Part IV: The Internet iPhone 
116
Of equal importance, both the . (period) 
and the / (slash) are on the virtual keyboard 
because you frequently use them when you 
enter Web addresses.
The moment you tap a single letter, you see a 
list of Web addresses that match those 
letters. For example, if you tap the letter E 
(as we did in the example in Figure 10-2), 
you see Web listings for EarthLink, eBay, 
and so on. Tapping U or H instead may bring 
up URLs for USA TODAY or the Houston 
Chronicle, shameless plugs for the newspa-
pers where Ed and Bob are columnists.
The iPhone has two ways to determine Web 
sites to suggest when you tap letters. One 
method is the Web sites you’ve already book-
marked from the Safari or Internet Explorer 
browsers on your computer (and synchro-
nized as described in Chapter 3). More on 
bookmarks later in this chapter.
The second method iPhone uses when suggesting Web sites when you tap a 
particular letter is to suggest sites from the History list — those cyberdesti-
nations you’ve recently hung your hat in. Because history repeats itself, we 
also tackle that topic later in the chapter.
You might as well open your first Web page now — and a full HTML page at 
that, to borrow from techie lingo:
 
1. Tap the Safari icon at the bottom of the Home screen.
 
 It’s another member of the Fantastic Four (along with Phone, Mail, and 
iPod).
 
2. Tap the address field (labeled in Figure 10-1).
 
 If you can’t see the address field, tap the status bar or scroll to the top 
of the screen.
 
3. Begin typing the Web address, or URL (Uniform Resource Locator 
for you trivia buffs), on the virtual keyboard that slides up from the 
bottom of the screen.
Figure 10-2: Web pages that match 
your search letter.

117
 Chapter 10: Going On a Mobile Safari
 
4. Do one of the following:
 
a. To accept one of the bookmarked (or other) sites that show up on 
the list, merely tap the name.
 
 Safari automatically fills in the URL in the address field and takes 
you where you want to go.
 
b. Keep tapping the proper keyboard characters until you’ve entered 
the complete Web address for the site you have in mind, and then 
tap Go at the bottom-right corner of the keyboard.
 
 It’s not necessary to type www at the beginning of a URL. So if you 
want to visit www.theonion.com (for example), typing theonion.
com is sufficient to transport you to the site in question.
 
Even though Safari on the iPhone can render Web pages the way they’re 
meant to be displayed on a computer, every so often you may run into a site 
that will serve up the light, or mobile, version of the Web site, sometimes 
known as a WAP site. Graphics may be stripped down on such sites. Alas, 
the producers of these sites may be unwittingly discriminating against you 
for dropping in on them via a cell phone. Never mind that the cell phone in 
this case is an iPhone. You have our permission to berate them with letters, 
e-mails, and phone calls until they get with the program.
I Can See Clearly Now
Now that you know how to open up a Web page, we’ll show you how radically 
simple it is to zoom in on the pages so you can read what you want to read 
and see what you want to see, without enlisting a magnifying glass.
Try these neat tricks:
 
✓ Double-tap the screen so that 
that portion of the text fills up 
the entire screen: It’ll take just a 
second before the screen comes 
into focus. By way of example, 
check out Figure 10-3. It shows two 
views of the same Sports Illustrated 
Web page. In the first view, you 
see what the page looks like when 
you first arrive. In the second, you 
see how the middle column takes 
over the screen after you double-
tapped on it. To return to the first 
view, double-tap the screen again.
Figure 10-3: Doing a double-tap dance 
zooms in and out.

Part IV: The Internet iPhone 
118
 
✓ Pinch the page: Sliding your thumb and index finger together and then 
spreading them apart (or as we like to say, un-pinching) also zooms in 
and out of a page. Again, wait just a moment for the screen to come into 
focus.
 
✓ Press down on a page and drag it in all directions, or flick through a 
page from top to bottom: You are panning and scrolling, baby.
 
✓ Rotate the iPhone 
to its side: Watch 
what happens to the 
White House Web site 
shown in Figure 10-4. 
It reorients from por-
trait to a widescreen 
view. The keyboard is 
also wider, making it a 
little easier to enter a 
new URL.
Opening multiple Web pages at once
When we surf the Web on a desktop PC or laptop, we rarely go to a single 
Web page and call it a day. In fact, we often have multiple Web pages open 
at the same time. Sometimes it’s because we 
choose to hop around the Web without clos-
ing the pages we’ve visited. Sometimes a link 
(see the next section) automatically opens 
a new page without shuttering the old one. 
(If they’re advertisements, these additional 
pages aren’t always welcome.)
Safari on the iPhone lets you open multiple 
pages simultaneously. Tap the Pages icon 
(labeled in Figure 10-1), which is on the right 
side of the navigation bar at the bottom of 
the screen, and then tap New Page on the 
screen that pops up next. Tap the address 
field and type a URL for your new page.
The number inside the Pages icon lets you 
know how many pages are open. To see the 
other open pages, flick your finger to the left 
or right, as shown in Figure 10-5. Tap a page 
to have it take over the full screen.
Figure 10-4: Going wide.
Figure 10-5: All open for business.

119
 Chapter 10: Going On a Mobile Safari
To close one of your open Web pages, tap the white X in the red circle, which 
appears in the upper-left corner of each open page.
Lovable links
Surfing the Web would be a real drag if you had to enter a URL each time you 
wanted to navigate from one page to another. That’s why bookmarks are so 
useful. And it’s why handy links are welcome too. Because Safari functions 
on the iPhone the same way browsers work on your PC or Mac, links on the 
iPhone pretty much behave the same way too.
Text links that transport you from one site to another are underlined. Merely 
tap the link to go directly to that site.
But tapping on some other links leads to different outcomes:
 
✓ Open a map: Tapping on a map launches the Google Maps application 
that is, um, addressed in Chapter 12.
 
✓ Prepare an e-mail: Tap an e-mail address and the iPhone opens the Mail 
program (see the next chapter), and pre-populates the To field with that 
address. The virtual keyboard is also summoned so you can add other 
e-mail addresses and compose a subject line and message.
 
✓ Make a phone call: Tap a phone number embedded in a Web page, and 
the iPhone offers to dial it for you. Just tap Call to make it happen, or 
Cancel to forget the whole thing.
 
To see the URL for a link, press your finger against the link and keep it there. 
This is also a way to determine whether a picture has a link.
 
Not every Web link will cooperate with the iPhone. As of this writing, the 
iPhone didn’t support some common Web standards, notably Adobe Flash 
video and Java. It’s a void we hope is addressed — and Apple can apply such 
an upgrade (if it so chooses) through a software update. In the meantime, if 
you come upon an incompatible link, nothing may happen — or a message 
may be displayed about having to install a plug-in.
Book(mark) ’em, Dano
You already know how useful bookmarks are and how you can synchronize 
bookmarks from the browsers on your computer. It’s equally simple to book-
mark a Web page directly on the iPhone:

Part IV: The Internet iPhone 
120
 
1. With the page you want to bookmark 
open, tap the + at the bottom middle of 
the screen.
 
 The Add Bookmark screen appears, 
as shown in Figure 10-6, with a default 
name and folder location.
 
2. To accept the default bookmark name 
and default bookmark folder, tap Save.
 
3. To change the default bookmark name, 
tap the X in the circle next to the name, 
enter the new title (using the virtual 
keyboard), and then tap Save.
 
4. To change the location where the 
bookmark is saved, tap the > in the 
Bookmarks field, tap the folder where 
you want the bookmark kept, and then 
tap Save.
To open a bookmarked page after you’ve set it 
up, tap the Bookmarks icon at the bottom of the screen (labeled in Figure 10-1), 
and then tap the appropriate bookmark.
If the bookmark you have in mind is buried inside a folder, tap the folder 
name first and then tap the bookmark you want.
Altering bookmarks
If a bookmarked site is no longer meaningful, you can change it or get rid of it:
 
✓ To remove a bookmark (or folder), tap the Bookmarks icon and then tap 
Edit. Tap the red circle next to the bookmark you want to toss off the 
list, and then tap Delete.
 
✓ To change a bookmark name or location, tap Edit and then tap the book-
mark. The Edit Bookmark screen appears, showing the name, URL, and 
location of the bookmark already filled in. Tap the fields you want to 
change. In the Name field, tap the X in the gray circle and then use the 
keyboard to enter a new title. In the Location field, tap the > and scroll 
up or down the list until you find a new home for your bookmark.
 
✓ To create a new folder for your bookmarks, tap Edit and then tap the 
New Folder button. Enter the name of the new folder and choose where 
to put it.
Figure 10-6: Turning into a bookie.

121
 Chapter 10: Going On a Mobile Safari
 
✓ To move a bookmark up or down on a list, tap Edit and then drag the 
three bars to the right of the bookmark’s name.
Letting History repeat itself
Sometimes you want to revisit a site that you failed to bookmark. But you 
can’t remember what the darn destination was called or what led you there 
in the first place. Good thing you can study the history books.
Safari records the pages you visit and keeps the logs on hand for several 
days. Tap the Bookmarks icon, tap History, and then tap the day you think 
you hung out at the site. When you find it, tap the listing. You are about to 
make your triumphant return.
 
To clear your history so nobody else can trace your steps — and just what 
is it you’re hiding, hmmm? — tap Clear at the bottom of the History list. 
Alternately, tap Settings on the Home page, tap Safari, and then tap Clear 
History. In both instances, per usual, you’ll have a chance to back out with-
out wiping the slate clean.
Launching a mobile search mission
Most of us spend a lot of time on the Internet 
with search engines. And the search engines 
we summon most often are Google and 
Yahoo! So it goes on the iPhone.
Although you can certainly use the virtual 
keyboard to type google.com or yahoo.com 
in the Safari address field, Apple doesn’t 
require that tedious effort. Instead, you tap 
into Google or Yahoo! via the dedicated 
search box shown in Figure 10-7. The default 
search engine of choice on the iPhone is 
Google, with Yahoo! the first runner-up.
To conduct a Web search on the iPhone, tap 
the address field and then tap the Google 
(or Yahoo!) search field. Enter your search 
term or phrase and then tap the Google (or 
Yahoo!) button at the bottom-right of the 
keyboard to generate pages of results. Tap 
any search results that look promising.
Figure 10-7: Conducting a Google 
search about iPhone on the iPhone.

Part IV: The Internet iPhone 
122
 
To switch the search box from Google to 
Yahoo! and vice versa, tap Settings on the 
Home page, scroll down and tap Safari, tap 
Search Engine, and then tap to choose one 
search behemoth over the other.
Saving Web pictures
You can capture most pictures you come 
across on a Web site (but be mindful of any 
potential copyright violations depending on 
what you plan to do with the image). To copy 
an image from a Web site, press your finger 
against the image and tap the Save Image 
button that slides up (along with a Cancel 
button and sometimes an Open Link button), 
as shown in Figure 10-8. Saved images end up 
in your Camera Roll, from which they can be 
synced back to a computer.
Smart Safari Settings
Along with the riches galore found on the Internet are places in cyberspace 
where you’ll get hassled. Some of you may take pains to protect your privacy 
and maintain your security.
So return with us now to Settings, by tapping the Settings icon on the Home 
page. Now tap Safari.
You’ve already discovered how to change the default search engine and clear 
the record of the sites you’ve visited through Settings. Now see what else you 
can do:
 
✓ Clear cookies: We’re not talking about crumbs you may have acciden-
tally dropped on the iPhone. Cookies are tiny bits of information that a 
Web site places on the iPhone when you visit so that Web site will recog-
nize you when you return. You need not assume the worst; most cookies 
are benign. But if this concept wigs you out, you can do a few things.
 
 Tap Clear Cookies at the bottom of the screen and then tap it again 
(instead of tapping Cancel). Separately, tap Accept Cookies and then tap 
Never. Theoretically, you will never receive cookies on the iPhone again. 
A good middle ground is to accept cookies only from the sites you visit. 
To do so, tap From Visited. You can also tap Always to accept cookies 
from all sites.
Figure 10-8: Hold your finger against 
a picture in Safari to save it to the 
iPhone.

123
 Chapter 10: Going On a Mobile Safari
 
 If you don’t set the iPhone to accept cookies, certain Web pages won’t 
load properly.
 
 Tap Safari to return to the main Safari settings page.
 
✓ Clear the cache: The cache stores content from some Web pages so 
they load faster the next time you stop by. Tap Clear Cache and then tap 
Clear Cache again on the next screen to (you guessed it) clear the cache.
 
✓ Turn JavaScript on or off: This setting is on when the blue On button 
is showing and off when the white Off button is showing. Programmers 
use JavaScript to add various kinds of functionality to Web pages, from 
displaying the date and time to changing images when you mouse over 
them. However, some security risks have also been associated with 
JavaScript.
 
✓ Turn plug-ins on or off: These are typically associated with certain 
types of video.
 
✓ Block pop-ups: Pop-ups are those Web pages that show up whether you 
want them to or not. Often they are annoying advertisements. But at 
some sites you’ll welcome the appearance of pop-ups, so remember to 
turn blocking off under such circumstances.
 
✓ Developer: Unless you happen to be a developer, we wouldn’t ask you 
to pay too much attention to this setting. It lets you turn a debug con-
sole (showing errors, warnings, tips, logs, and such details that develop-
ers find useful) on or off.
Taming Safari is just the start of exploiting the Internet on the iPhone. In 
upcoming chapters, you discover how to master e-mail, maps, and more.

The E-Mail Must Get Through
In This Chapter
▶ Setting up your accounts
▶ Sending e-mail messages
▶ Reading and managing e-mail messages
▶ Setting e-mail preferences
C
hapter 5 shows you how well your iPhone sends SMS text messages. 
But SMS text messages aren’t the iPhone’s only written communication 
trick, not by a long shot. One of the niftiest things your iPhone can do is send 
and receive real, honest-to-gosh e-mail, using Mail, its modern e-mail applica-
tion. It’s designed not only to send and receive text e-mail messages, but also 
to handle rich HTML e-mail messages — formatted e-mail messages complete 
with font and type styles and embedded graphics.
Furthermore, your iPhone can read several types of file attachments, includ-
ing PDF, Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, and Excel documents, as well as 
stuff produced through Apple’s own iWork software. Better still, all 
this sending and receiving of text, graphics, and documents can 
happen in the background, so you can surf the Web or talk to a 
friend while your iPhone quietly and efficiently handles your 
e-mail behind the scenes.
Prep Work: Setting Up Your Accounts
First things first. To use Mail you need an e-mail address. 
If you have broadband Internet access (that is, a cable 
modem or DSL), you probably received one or more e-mail 
addresses when you signed up. If you are one of the handful 
of readers who doesn’t already have an e-mail account, you can 
get one for free from Yahoo! (http://mail.yahoo.com), Google 
(http://mail.google.com), and many other service providers.

Many (if not all) free e-mail providers add a small bit of advertising at the end 
of your outgoing messages. If you’d rather not be a billboard for your e-mail 
provider, either use the address(es) that came with your broadband Internet 
access (yourname@comcast.net, yourname@att.net, and so on) or pay a few 
dollars a month for a premium e-mail account that doesn’t tack advertising 
(or anything else) onto your messages. You can get a me.com e-mail account 
as part of Apple’s $99-a-year MobileMe service.
Set up your account the easy way
Chapter 3 explains the option of automatically syncing the e-mail accounts 
on your computer with your iPhone. If you chose that option, your e-mail 
accounts should be configured on your iPhone already. You may proceed 
directly to the “Darling, You Send Me (E-Mail)” section.
If you have not yet chosen that option but would like to set up your account 
the easy way now, go to Chapter 3 and read that section, sync your iPhone, 
and then you, too, may proceed directly to the “Darling, You Send Me 
(E-Mail)” section.
Set up your account the less easy way
If you don’t want to sync the e-mail accounts on your computer, you can 
set up an e-mail account on your iPhone manually. It’s not quite as easy 
as clicking a box and syncing your iPhone, but it’s not rocket science 
either.
If you have no e-mail accounts on your 
iPhone, the first time you launch Mail you’ll 
be walked through the following procedure. 
If you have one or more e-mail accounts on 
your iPhone already and want to add a new 
account manually, start by tapping Settings 
on the Home screen, and then tap Mail, 
Contacts, Calendars, and Add Account.
Either way, you should now be staring at 
the Add Account screen, which is shown 
in Figure 11-1. Proceed to one of the next 
two sections, depending on your e-mail 
account.

now. If your account is with a provider other than these four, tap the Other 
button and skip ahead to the next section — that is, with one important 
exception. If you’re setting up company e-mail through Microsoft Exchange, 
skip the next section and read the one after that.
Enter your name, e-mail address, and pass-
word, as shown in Figure 11-2. There’s a 
field for a description of this account (such 
as work or personal), but it tends to fill in 
automatically with the same contents in the 
Address field unless you tell it differently.
Tap the Save button in the top-right corner of 
the screen. You’re finished. That’s all there is 
to setting up your account.
Setting up an account with 
another provider
If your e-mail account is with a pro-
vider other than Yahoo!, Google, AOL, or 
MobileMe, you have a bit more work ahead 
of you. You’re going to need a bunch of infor-
mation about your e-mail account that you 
may not know or have handy.
We suggest that you scan the following 
instructions, note the items you don’t know, 
and go find the answers before you continue. 
To find the answers, look at the documenta-
tion you received when you signed up for your e-mail account or visit the 
account provider’s Web site and search there.
Here’s how you set up an account:
 
1. On the Add Account screen, tap the Other button.
 
2. Fill in the Name, Address, Password, and Description in the appro-
priate fields, same as if you were setting up a Yahoo!, Gmail, AOL or 
MobileMe account.
Optional field
Figure 11-2: Just fill ’em in, tap Save, 
and you’re ready to rock.

Part IV: The Internet iPhone 
 
 With any luck, that’s all you’ll have to do, although you may have to 
endure a spinning cursor for awhile as the iPhone attempts to retrieve 
information and validate your account with your provider. Otherwise, 
continue on with step three.
 
3. Tap the button at the top of the screen 
that denotes the type of e-mail server 
this account uses: IMAP or POP, as 
shown in Figure 11-3.
 
4. Fill in the Internet host name for your 
incoming mail server, which should 
look something like mail.provider-
name.com.
 
5. Fill in your username and password.
 
6. Enter the Internet host name for your 
outgoing mail server, which should 
look something like smtp.provider-
name.com.
 
 You may have to scroll down to the 
bottom of the screen to see the outgoing 
mail server fields.
 
7. Enter your username and password in 
the provided fields.
 
8. Tap the Save button in the upper-right 
corner to create the account.
 
 Some outgoing mail servers don’t need your username and password. The 
fields for these items on your iPhone note that they are optional. Still, we 
suggest that you fill them in anyway. It will save you from having to add them 
later if your outgoing mail server does require an account name and pass-
word, which many do these days.
Setting up corporate e-mail
The iPhone has gotten a lot friendlier for business users of late, notably 
because the device makes nice with the Microsoft Exchange servers that are 
such a staple in large enterprises.
Figure 11-3: If you’re not a Yahoo!, 
Google, AOL, or MobileMe user, you 
may have a few more fields to fill in 
before you can rock.

129
 Chapter 11: The E-Mail Must Get Through
What’s more, if your company supports something known as Microsoft 
Exchange ActiveSync, you can exploit “push” e-mail, so that messages arrive 
pronto on the iPhone, just as they do on your other computers. For push to 
work, your company must be simpatico with 
Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync 2003 or 2007.
Setting up Exchange e-mail isn’t particularly 
taxing, although there’s a good chance you’ll 
have to consult your employer’s IT or tech 
department for certain settings.
Start out by just touching the Microsoft 
Exchange icon on the Add Account screen. 
Fill in what you can: your e-mail address, 
username (usually as domain\user), and 
password. Or again call on your IT staff for 
assistance. 
On the next screen, shown in Figure 11-4, enter 
the Server address, assuming Microsoft’s 
Autodiscovery service didn’t already find it. 
That address usually begins with exchange.
company.com.
 
The company you work for doesn’t want 
just anybody having access to your e-mail — 
heaven forbid if your phone is lost or stolen. 
So your bosses may insist that you change the 
passcode lock inside Settings on the phone. 
(This is different than the password for your 
e-mail account.) Skip ahead to Chapter 13 on 
settings for instructions on adding or chang-
ing a passcode. We’ll be back here waiting for 
you. And if your iPhone does end up in the 
wrong hands, your company can remotely 
wipe the contents clean.
After your corporate account is fully con-
figured, you have to choose which infor-
mation you want to synchronize through 
Exchange. You can choose Mail, Contacts, 
and Calendars. Tap each one that you want 
to synchronize through Microsoft Exchange. 
After you choose an item, you see the blue On 
button next to it, as shown in Figure 11-5.
Figure 11-4: You’re on your way to a 
corporate e-mail account.
Figure 11-5: Keeping Mail, Contacts, 
and Calendars in sync.

130
Part IV: The Internet iPhone 
 
By default, the iPhone keeps e-mail synchronized for three days. To sync for a 
longer period, head to Settings and tap Mail, Contacts, Calendars, and then 
tap the Mail account using ActiveSync. Tap Mail Days to Sync and tap No 
Limit or pick another time frame (1 day, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month).
 
Sorry, but you can configure only one Exchange ActiveSync account per 
iPhone. If you tap Microsoft Exchange on the Add Account screen of an 
iPhone that already has an ActiveSync account set up, you’ll get no further.
Darling, You Send Me (E-Mail)
Now that your account or accounts are set up, let’s look at how to use your 
iPhone to send e-mail.
Makin’ messages
There are several subspecies of messages: pure text, text with a photo, a par-
tially finished message you want to save and complete later (called a draft), a 
reply to an incoming message, forwarding 
an incoming message to someone else, 
and so on. The following sections exam-
ine these subsets one at a time.
Sending an all-text message
To compose a new e-mail message, tap 
Mail on your Home screen. You should 
see a screen that looks pretty much like 
the one in Figure 11-6.
Don’t worry if yours doesn’t look exactly 
like this or if your folders have different 
names.
Now, to create a new message, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Tap the New Message button 
(labeled in Figure 11-6) in the 
lower-right corner of the screen.
 
 A screen like the one shown in 
Figure 11-7 appears.
Tap to see other e-mail accounts

 Chapter 11: The E-Mail Must Get Through
 
2. Type the names or e-mail addresses 
of the recipients in the To: field, or 
tap the + button to the right of To: to 
choose a contact or contacts from your 
iPhone’s address book.
 
3. (Optional) Tap the field labeled Cc/
Bcc/From:. Doing so breaks these out 
into separate Cc:, Bcc:, and From: 
fields. The Cc/Bcc: label stands for 
carbon copy/blind carbon copy. If you 
haven’t used Bcc: before, it enables 
you to include a recipient on the mes-
sage that other recipients can’t see has 
been included. It’s great for those secret 
agent e-mails! Tap the respective Cc: or 
Bcc: field to type in names. Or tap the 
+ that appears in those fields to add a 
contact. If you tap From instead, you can 
choose to send the message from any of 
your e-mail accounts on the fly, assum-
ing, of course, you have more than one 
account.
 
 If you start typing an e-mail address, e-mail addresses that match what 
you’ve typed appear in a list below the To: or Cc: field. If the correct one 
is in the list, tap it to use it.
 
4. Type a subject in the Subject field.
 
 The subject is optional, but it’s considered poor form to send an e-mail 
message without one.
 
5. Type your message in the message area.
 
 The message area is immediately below the Subject field.
 
6. Tap the Send button in the top-right corner of the screen.
Your message will wing its way to its recipients almost immediately. If you 
are not in range of a Wi-Fi network or the AT&T EDGE or 3G data network 
when you tap Send, the message is sent the next time you are in range of 
either network.
Sending a photo with a text message
Sometimes a picture is worth a thousand words. When that’s the case, here’s 
how to send an e-mail message with a photo enclosed.
Figure 11-7: The New Message 
screen appears ready for you to 
start typing the recipient’s name.

132
Part IV: The Internet iPhone 
Tap the Photos icon on the Home screen and then find the photo you want 
to send. Tap the button that looks like a little rectangle with a curved arrow 
springing out of it in the bottom-left corner of the screen, and then tap the 
Email Photo button.
An e-mail message appears on-screen with the photo already attached; in fact 
the image appears to be embedded in the body of the message but the recipi-
ent will receive it as a regular e-mail attachment. Just address the message 
and type whatever text you like, as you did for an all-text message in the pre-
ceding section, and then tap the Send button.
Saving an e-mail message so you can send it later
Sometimes you start an e-mail message but don’t have time to finish it. When 
that happens, you can save it as a draft and finish it some other time.
Here’s how: Start an e-mail message as described in one of the two previous 
sections. When you’re ready to save it as a draft, tap the Cancel button in the 
top-left corner of the screen. Now tap the Save button if you want to save this 
message as a draft and complete it another time. If you tap the Cancel button, 
you cancel the cancel command and go right back to the message and can 
continue working on it now.
 
If you tap the Don’t Save button, the message disappears immediately with-
out a second chance. Don’t tap Don’t Save unless you mean it.
To work on the message again, tap the Drafts mailbox. A list of all the mes-
sages you’ve saved as drafts appears. Tap the one you want to work on, and 
it reappears on the screen. When you’re finished, you can tap Send to send it 
or tap Cancel to save it as a draft again.
 
The number of drafts appears on the right of the Drafts folder, the same way 
that the number of unread messages appears on the right of other mail fold-
ers such as your Inbox.
Replying to or forwarding an e-mail message
When you receive a message and want to reply to it, open the message and 
then tap the Reply/Reply All/Forward button, which looks like a curved arrow 
at the bottom of the screen, as shown in Figure 11-8. Then tap the Reply, 
Reply All, or Forward button.
The Reply button creates a blank e-mail message addressed to the sender of 
the original message. The Reply All button creates a blank e-mail message 
addressed to the sender and all other recipients of the original message. In 

133
 Chapter 11: The E-Mail Must Get Through
both cases the subject is retained with 
a Re: prefix added. So if the original 
subject was iPhone Tips, the reply’s 
subject would be Re: iPhone Tips.
Tapping the Forward button creates 
an unaddressed e-mail message that 
contains the text of the original mes-
sage. Add the e-mail address(es) of 
the person or people you want to 
forward the message to, and then 
tap Send. In this case, instead of a 
Re: prefix, the subject is preceded 
by Fwd:. So this time the subject 
would be Fwd: iPhone Tips.
 
You can edit the subject line of a 
reply or a forwarded message or 
edit the body text of a forwarded 
message the same way you would 
edit any other text. It’s usually 
considered good form to leave the 
subject lines alone (with the Re: or 
Fwd: prefix intact), but there may be 
times when you want to change them. 
Now you know that you can.
To send your reply or forwarded 
message, tap the Send button as 
usual.
Settings for sending e-mail
You can customize the mail you send and receive in lots of different ways. 
In this section, we explore settings for sending e-mail. Later in this chapter, 
we show you settings that impact the way you receive and read messages. In 
each instance, you start by tapping Settings on the Home screen. Then:
 
✓ To hear an alert when you successfully send a message: Tap the Sound 
icon on the main Settings screen, and then turn on the Sent Mail setting. 
If you want to change other settings, tap the Settings button in the top-
left corner of the screen. If you’re finished setting settings, tap the Home 
button on the front of your iPhone.

Part IV: The Internet iPhone 
 
 The preceding paragraph is similar for all the settings we discuss in this 
section and later sections, so we won’t repeat them again. To summa-
rize, if you want to continue using settings, you tap whichever button 
appears in the top-left corner of the screen — sometimes it’s called 
Settings, or Mail, or Accounts, or something else. The point is that the 
top-left button always returns you to the previous screen so that you 
can change other settings. And the same applies to pressing the Home 
button on the front of your iPhone when you’re finished setting a set-
ting. That always saves the change you’ve just made and returns you to 
the Home screen.
 
✓ To add a signature line, phrase, or block of text to every e-mail 
message you send: Tap Settings, tap Mail, Contacts, Calendars, and then 
tap Signature. (You may need to scroll down to see it). The default signa-
ture is Sent from my iPhone. You can add text before or after it, or delete 
it and type something else. Your signature is now affixed to the end of all 
your outgoing e-mail.
 
✓ To have your iPhone send you a copy of every message you send: Tap 
Settings, tap Mail, Contacts, Calendars, and then turn on the Always Cc 
Myself setting.
 
✓ To set the default e-mail account for sending e-mail from outside the 
Mail application: Tap the Settings icon on the Home screen, tap Mail, 
and then tap Default Account. Tap the account you want to use as the 
default. For example, when you want to e-mail a picture directly from the 
Photos application, this designated e-mail account is the one that will 
be used. Note that this setting applies only if you have more than one 
e-mail account on your iPhone.
And that’s what you need to know about the settings that apply to sending 
e-mail.

Working with Messages
The other half of the mail equation is receiving and reading the stuff. 
Fortunately, you’ve already done most of the heavy lifting when you set up 
your e-mail accounts. Getting and reading your mail is a piece of cake.
You can tell when you have unread mail by looking at the Mail icon, in the 
bottom of your Home screen. The cumulative number of unread messages 
appears in a little red circle on the top-right of the icon.

135
 Chapter 11: The E-Mail Must Get Through
Reading messages
To read your mail, tap the Mail icon on the Home screen. The Accounts list 
appears, and the Inbox in that list displays the number of unread messages in 
a blue oval to the right of its name.
 
If you have more than one e-mail account, you may have to tap the Accounts 
button in the upper-left corner and then choose the appropriate e-mail 
account before you see the Inbox with the unread messages.
To see the list of unread messages, tap Inbox in the list of mailboxes and then 
tap a message to read it. When a message is on the screen, buttons for man-
aging incoming messages appear below it (refer to Figure 11-8).
Managing messages
When a message is on your screen, you can do the following in addition to 
reading it (all buttons are labeled in Figure 11-8):
 
✓ View the next message by tapping the next message button.
 
✓ View the previous message by tapping the previous message button.
 
✓ Check for new messages by tapping the check for new messages button.
 
✓ File this message in another folder by tapping the file message button. 
When the list of folders appears, tap the folder where you want to file 
the message.
 
✓ Delete this message by tapping the delete message button. You’ll have a 
chance to cancel in case you tapped the delete message button by 
mistake.
 
✓ Reply, reply to all, or forward this message (as discussed previously) by 
tapping the Reply/Reply All/Forward button.
 
✓ Create a new e-mail message by tapping the new message button.
You can delete e-mail messages without opening them in two ways:
 
✓ Swipe left or right across the message and then tap the red Delete 
button that appears to the right of the message.
 
✓ Tap the Edit button in the upper-left corner of the screen, tap the red 
minus (–) button to the left of the message, and then tap the red Delete 
button that appears to the right of the message.

136
Part IV: The Internet iPhone 
 
As part of the iPhone 2.0 software upgrade, 
Apple lets you delete or move messages in 
bulk. Tap Edit, and then tap the circle to the 
left of each message you want to delete or 
move so that a check mark appears. Tap the 
Delete or Move button at the bottom of the 
screen shown in Figure 11-9, depending on 
which action you want to take. Deleted mes-
sages are moved to the Trash folder. If you 
chose Move, tap the new folder in which you 
want those messages to hang out.
Don’t grow too attached to attachments
Your iPhone can even receive e-mail mes-
sages with attachments in a wide variety 
of file formats. What file formats does the 
iPhone support? Glad you asked.
Here is the list of file formats that your 
iPhone can receive as attachments, care 
of Apple:
 
✓ Images: .jpg, .tiff, .gif
 
✓ Microsoft Word: .doc and .docx
 
✓ Microsoft PowerPoint: .ppt and .pptx
 
✓ Microsoft Excel: .xls and .xlsx
 
✓ Web pages: .htm and .html
 
✓ Apple Keynote: .key
 
✓ Apple Numbers: .numbers
 
✓ Apple Pages: .pages
 
✓ Preview and Adobe Acrobe: .pdf
 
✓ Text: .txt
 
✓ Contact information: .vcf
 
If the attachment is a file format not supported by the iPhone (for example, a 
Photoshop .psd file), you’ll see the name of the file but you won’t be able to 
open it on your iPhone.
Figure 11-9: Wiping out, or moving 
messages, en masse.

137
 Chapter 11: The E-Mail Must Get Through
Here’s how to read an attachment:
 
1. Open the mail message containing the attachment.
 
2. Tap the attachment (it appears at the 
bottom of the message so you’ll prob-
ably need to scroll down to see it).
 
 The attachment, like the one shown in 
Figure 11-10, downloads to your iPhone 
and opens automatically.
 
3. Read the attachment.
 
4. Tap the Message button in the upper-
left corner of the screen to return to 
the message text.
More things you can do with messages
But wait! You can do even more with your 
incoming e-mail messages:
 
✓ To see all the recipients of a message, 
tap the word Details (displayed in blue) 
to the right of the sender’s name.
 
 If all recipients are displayed, the 
word in blue will be Hide rather than 
Details. Tap it to hide all names but the 
sender’s.
 
✓ To add an e-mail recipient or sender to your contacts, tap the name or 
e-mail address at the top of the message and then tap either Create New 
Contact or Add to Existing Contact.
 
✓ To mark a message as unread, tap Mark as Unread, which appears near 
the top of each message in blue with a blue dot to its left. When you do, 
the message is again included in the unread message count on the Mail 
icon on your Home screen and its mailbox and will again have a blue dot 
next to it in the message list for that mailbox.
 
✓ To zoom in, double-tap the place you want to zoom in on. Double-tap 
again to zoom out.
 
 For more precise control over zooming, pinch and un-pinch instead of 
double-tapping.
Figure 11-10: Text from a Microsoft 
Word file that was attached to an 
incoming e-mail message.

138
Part IV: The Internet iPhone 
 
✓ To follow a link in a message, tap the link. Links are typically displayed 
in blue. If the link is a URL, Safari opens and displays the Web page. If 
the link is a phone number, the Phone application opens and offers to 
dial the number. If the link is a Map, Maps opens and displays the loca-
tion. And last but not least, if the link is an e-mail address, a new pre-
addressed blank e-mail message is created.
 
 If the link opens Safari, Phone, or Maps, and you want to return to your 
e-mail, press the Home button on the front of your iPhone and then tap 
the Mail icon.
Setting your message and account settings
This final discussion of Mail involves more settings that deal with your vari-
ous e-mail accounts.
Checking and viewing e-mail settings
Several settings affect the way you can check and view e-mail. You might 
want to modify one or more, so here’s what they do and where to find them:
 
✓ To set how often the iPhone checks 
for new messages: Tap the Settings 
icon on the Home screen and then tap 
Fetch New Data. You are entering the 
world of fetching or pushing. Check out 
Figure 11-11 to glance at your options. 
If your e-mail program supports Push 
and you have Push turned on (the On 
button is showing) fresh messages are 
sent to your iPhone automatically as 
soon as they hit the server. If you’ve 
turned Push off (Off is showing), or your 
e-mail program doesn’t support Push 
in the first place, the iPhone fetches 
data instead. Choices for fetching are 
Manually, Every 15 Minutes, Every 30 
Minutes, and Hourly. Tap the one you 
prefer.
 
 Tap Advanced at the bottom of the 
screen to determine these Push/Fetch 
settings for each individual account. 
Tap the account in question. Push is 
shown as an option only if the e-mail account you’ve tapped supports 
the feature.
 
 As of this writing, Yahoo!, MobileMe (Me.com), and Microsoft Exchange 
ActiveSync accounts were awfully pushy (but only in a good way).
Figure 11-11: Fetch or Push? 
Your call.

139
 Chapter 11: The E-Mail Must Get Through
 
✓ To hear an alert sound when you receive a new message: Tap the Sounds 
icon on the main Settings screen and then turn on the New Mail setting.
 
✓ To set the number of recent messages that appears in your Inbox: Tap 
the Settings icon on the Home screen, tap Mail, Contacts, Calendars, 
and then tap Show. Your choices are 25, 50, 75, 100, and 200 recent mes-
sages. Tap the number you prefer.
 
 You can always see more messages in your Inbox regardless of this set-
ting by scrolling all the way to the bottom and tapping Download More.
 
✓ To set the number of lines of each message to be displayed in the mes-
sage list: Tap the Settings icon on the Home screen, tap Mail, Contacts, 
Calendars, tap Preview, and then choose a number. Your choices are 0, 
1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 lines of text. The more lines of text you display in the list, 
the fewer messages you can see at a time without scrolling. Think before 
you choose 4 or 5.
 
✓ To set the font size for messages: Tap the Settings icon on the Home 
screen, tap Mail, Contacts, Calendars, and then tap Minimum Font Size. 
Your options are Small, Medium, Large, Extra Large, and Giant. Use trial and 
error to find out which size you prefer. Choose one and then read a mes-
sage. If it’s not just right, choose a different size. Repeat until you’re happy.
 
✓ To set whether or not the iPhone shows the To and Cc labels in mes-
sage lists: Tap the Settings icon on the Home screen, tap Mail, Contacts, 
Calendars, and then turn the Show To/Cc Label setting on or off.
 
✓ To turn the Ask Before Deleting warning on or off: Tap the Settings icon 
on the Home screen, tap Mail, Contacts, Calendars, and then turn the Ask 
Before Deleting setting on or off. If this setting is turned on, you need to 
tap the trash can icon at the bottom of the screen and then tap the red 
Delete button to confirm the deletion. When it’s turned off, tapping the 
trash can icon deletes the message and you never see a red Delete button.
Altering account settings
The last group of settings we explore deals with your e-mail accounts. Most 
of you will never need most of these settings, but we’d be remiss if we didn’t 
at least mention them briefly. So here they are, whether you need ’em or not:
 
✓ To stop using an e-mail account: Tap the Settings icon on the Home 
screen, tap Mail, Contacts, Calendars, and then tap the account name. 
Tap the switch to turn off the account.
 
 This setting doesn’t delete the account; it only hides it from view and 
stops it from sending or checking e-mail until you turn it on again.
 
✓ To delete an e-mail account: Tap the Settings icon on the Home screen, 
tap Mail, and then tap the account name. Scroll to the very bottom and 
tap the red button that says Delete Account. You are given a chance to 
reconsider. Tap Delete Account if you’re sure you want this account 
blown away or Cancel if you change your mind and want to keep it.

140
Part IV: The Internet iPhone 
The last settings are somewhat advanced and are all reached the same way: 
Tap the Settings icon on the Home screen, tap Mail, Contacts, Calendars, and 
then tap the name of the account you want to work with. Then:
 
✓ To set how long until deleted messages are removed permanently 
from your iPhone: Tap Advanced, and then tap Remove. Your choices 
are Never, After One Day, After One Week, and After One Month. Tap the 
choice you prefer.
 
✓ To set whether drafts, sent messages, and deleted messages are stored 
on your iPhone or on your mail server: Tap Advanced, and then 
choose the setting (Stored on my iPhone or Stored on the server) for 
Drafts, Sent Messages, and Deleted Messages. If you choose to store any 
or all of them on the server, you won’t be able to see them unless you 
have an Internet connection (Wi-Fi, EDGE, or 3G). If you choose to store 
them on your iPhone, they are always available, even if you don’t have 
Internet access.
 
 We strongly recommend that you not change these next two items 
unless you know exactly what you’re doing and why. If you’re having 
problems with sending or receiving mail, start by contacting your ISP 
(Internet service provider), e-mail provider, or corporate IT person or 
department. Then, only change these settings if they tell you to.
 
✓ To reconfigure mail server settings: Tap Host Name, User Name, or 
Password in the Incoming Mail Server or Outgoing Mail Server section of 
the account settings screen and make your changes.
 
✓ To adjust Use SSL, Authentication, IMAP Path settings, or Server Port: 
Tap Advanced, and then tap the appropriate item and make the neces-
sary changes.
And that, as they say in baseball, retires the side. You are now fully qualified 
to set up e-mail accounts and send and receive e-mail on your iPhone.

Monitoring Maps, Scrutinizing 
Stocks, and Watching Weather
In This Chapter
▶ Mapping your route with Maps
▶ Getting quotes with Stocks
▶ Watching the weather with Weather
I
n this chapter we look at three of the iPhone’s Internet-enabled applica-
tions: Maps, Stocks, and Weather. We call them Internet-enabled because 
they display information collected over your Internet connection — whether 
Wi-Fi or wireless data network — in real (or in the case of Stocks, near-real) 
time.
Maps Are Where It’s At
In the first edition of this book we said that the Maps fea-
ture was one of the sleeper hits of our iPhone experience 
and an application we both use more than we expected 
because it’s so darn handy. Since then, Maps has only 
gotten better and more capable. With Maps, you can 
quickly and easily discover exactly where you are, find 
nearby restaurants and businesses, get turn-by-turn driv-
ing instructions from any address to any other address, and 
see real-time traffic information for any location.
Finding your current location with Maps
 
 Let’s start with something supremely simple yet extremely useful — 
 determining your current location. At the risk of sounding like self-help 
gurus, here’s how to find yourself: Tap the Maps icon and then tap the little 
compass in the lower-left corner.

142
Part IV: The Internet iPhone 
If you have an iPhone 3G, a pulsating blue 
marker indicates your location on the map 
when its GPS is used to find your location 
(see Figure 12-1). Otherwise, a somewhat 
larger circle is used to show your approxi-
mate location. Either way, when you move 
around, iPhone can update your location 
and adjust the map so the location indicator 
stays in the middle of the screen.
 
If you tap or drag the map, your iPhone con-
tinues to update your location; but it won’t 
re-center the marker, which means that the 
location indicator can move off the screen.
Finding a person, place, 
or thing
To find a person, place, or thing with Maps, 
tap the search field at the top of the screen 
to make the keyboard appear. Now type 
what you’re looking for. You can search for 
addresses, zip codes, intersections, towns, 
landmarks, and businesses by category and 
by name, or combinations, such as New York, 
NY 10022, pizza 60645, or Auditorium Shores 
Austin TX.
 
If the letters you type match names in your 
Contacts list, the matching contacts appear 
in a list below the search field. Tap a name 
to see a map of that contact’s location. Maps 
is smart about it, too; it displays only the 
names of contacts with a street address.
When you finish typing, tap Search. After a 
few seconds, a map appears. If you searched 
for a single location, it is marked with a 
single pushpin. If you searched for a category 
(pizza 60645, for example), you see multiple 
pushpins, one for each matching location, as 
shown in Figure 12-2.
So that’s how to find just about anything with 
Maps. Now here’s a look at some ways you 
can use what you find.
Figure 12-1: With an iPhone 3G, 
a blue marker shows your GPS 
location.
Figure 12-2: Search for pizza 60645 
and you see pushpins for all nearby 
pizza joints.

Views, zooms, and pans
 
 First, find out how to work with what you 
see on the screen. Four views are available at 
any time: Map, Satellite, Hybrid, and List 
(Figure 12-2 shows the Map view). Select one 
view by tapping the curling page button in 
the lower-right corner. The map then curls 
back and reveals several buttons, as shown 
in Figure 12-3.
In Map, Satellite, or Hybrid view, you can 
zoom to see either more or less of the map — 
or scroll (pan) to see what’s above, below, or 
to the left or right of what’s on the screen:
 
✓ To zoom out: Pinch the map or double-
tap using two fingers. To zoom out even 
more, pinch or double-tap using two fin-
gers again.
 
 This is a new concept. To double-tap 
with two fingers, merely tap twice in 
rapid succession with two fingers rather 
than the usual one finger. (That’s a total 
of four taps, input very efficiently as two 
taps per finger.)
 
✓ To zoom in: Un-pinch the map or double-tap (the usual way — with just 
one finger) the spot you want to zoom in on. Un-pinch or double-tap 
with one finger again to zoom in even more.
 
 An un-pinch is the opposite of a pinch. Start with your thumb and a 
finger together and then flick them apart.
How does it do that?
Maps uses iPhone’s Location Services to deter-
mine your approximate location using available 
information from your wireless data network, 
local Wi-Fi networks (if Wi-Fi is turned on), and 
GPS (in iPhone 3G only).
If you’re not using Location Services, turning it 
off will conserve your battery. (Tap Settings, tap 
General, and then tap Location Services.)
Don’t worry if Location Services is turned off 
when you tap the compass — if so, you’ll be 
prompted to turn it on.
Finally, Location Services may not be available 
in all areas at all times.
Figure 12-3: The map curls back to 
reveal these buttons.

144
Part IV: The Internet iPhone 
 
 You can also un-pinch with two fingers or two thumbs, one from each 
hand, but you’ll probably find that a single-handed pinch and un-pinch is 
handier.
 
✓ To scroll: Flick or drag up, down, left, or right.
Maps and contacts
Maps and contacts go together like peanut butter and jelly. For example, if 
you want to see a map of a contact’s street address, tap the little bookmark 
icon in the search field, tap the Contacts button at the bottom of the screen, 
and then tap the contact’s name.
Or type the first few letters of the contact’s name in the search field and then 
tap the name in the list that automatically appears below the search field.
After you find a location by typing an address into Maps, you can add that 
location to one of your contacts. Or you can create a new contact with a 
location you’ve found. To do either, tap the location’s pushpin on the map, 
and then tap the little > in a blue circle to the right of the location’s name or 
description (shown next to Gullivers Pizzeria in Figure 12-2) to display its Info 
screen (see Figure 12-4).
 
 
 Figure 12-4: The unscrolled Info screen for Gullivers Pizzeria (left), 
and the same screen when you scroll to the bottom (right).
Now tap either the Create New Contact button or the Add to Existing Contact 
button on the Info screen. You’ll probably have to scroll to the bottom of the 
Info screen to see these buttons (shown on the right in Figure 12-4).

145
 Chapter 12: Monitoring Maps, Scrutinizing Stocks, and Watching Weather
 
You work with your contacts by tapping the Contacts icon on your Home 
screen or tapping the Phone icon on your Home screen and then tapping the 
Contacts icon at the bottom of the Phone screen.
You can also get driving directions from any location including a contact’s 
address to any other location including another contact’s address. You’ll see 
how to do that in the “Smart map tricks” section.
Timesaving map tools: Bookmarks, 
Recents, and Contacts
 
 Maps offers three tools that can save you from having to type the same loca-
tions over and over again. All three appear in the Bookmarks screen, which 
appears when you tap the little blue bookmark icon that appears on the right 
side of the search field when it’s empty (refer to Figure 12-3).
 
The fastest way to erase the search field and make the bookmark icon appear 
is to tap the little x on the right, which causes the contents of the search field 
to disappear instantly.
At the bottom of the Bookmarks screen, you find three buttons: Bookmarks, 
Recents, and Contacts. The following sections give you the lowdown on these 
buttons.
Bookmarks
Bookmarks in the Maps application work like bookmarks do in Safari. When 
you have a location you want to save as a bookmark so that you can reuse it 
later without typing a single character, tap the little > in a blue circle to the 
right of its name or description to display the Info screen for that location. 
Tap the Add to Bookmarks button on the Info screen. (You may have to scroll 
down the Info screen to see the Add to Bookmarks button.)
You can also drop a pin anywhere on the map by tapping the curling page 
button in the lower-right corner, and then tapping the Drop Pin button. Once 
you’ve dropped a pin you can drag it anywhere on the map. When it’s where 
you want it, tap the pin if you don’t see the words Drag To Move Pin above 
it and Drag To Move Pin and a little > in a blue circle will appear. Tap the 
little > and the Info screen for the dropped pin appears. Now tap the Add to 
bookmarks button on the Info screen.
After you add a bookmark, you can recall it at any time. To do so, tap the 
bookmarks icon in any search field, tap the Bookmarks button at the bottom 
of the screen, and then tap the bookmark name to see a map of it.
 
The first things you should bookmark are your home and work addresses 
and your zip codes. These are things you use all the time with Maps, so you 
might as well bookmark them now to avoid typing them over and over.

146
Part IV: The Internet iPhone 
 
Use zip code bookmarks to find nearby businesses. Choose the zip code 
bookmark, and then type what you’re looking for, such as 78729 pizza, 60645 
gas station, or 90201 Starbucks.
To manage your bookmarks, first tap the Edit button in the top-left corner of 
the Bookmarks screen. Then:
 
✓ To move a bookmark up or down in the Bookmarks list: Drag the little 
icon with three gray bars that appears to the right of the bookmark 
upward to move the bookmark higher in the list or downward to move 
the bookmark lower in the list.
 
✓ To delete a bookmark from the Bookmarks list: Tap the minus sign to 
the left of the bookmark’s name.
When you’re finished using bookmarks, tap the Done button in the top-right 
corner of the Bookmarks screen to return to the map.
Recents
Maps automatically keeps track of every location you’ve searched for in its 
Recents list. To see this list, tap the bookmarks icon in any empty search 
field, and then tap the Recents button at the bottom of the screen. To see a 
map of a recent item, tap the item’s name.
To clear the Recents list, tap the Clear button in the top-left corner of the 
screen, and then tap the Clear All Recents button.
When you’re finished using the Recents list, tap the Done button in the top-
right corner of the screen to return to the map.
Contacts
To see a map of a contact’s location, tap the bookmarks icon in any search 
field, and then tap the Contacts button at the bottom of the screen. To see a 
map of a contact’s location, tap the contact’s name in the list.
To limit the Contacts list to specific groups (assuming you have some groups 
in your Contacts list), tap the Groups button in the top-left corner of the 
screen and then tap the name of the group. Now only contacts in this group 
are displayed in the list.
When you’re finished using the Contacts list, tap the Done button in the top-
right corner of the screen to return to the map.
Smart map tricks
The Maps application has more tricks up its sleeve. Here are a few nifty fea-
tures you may find useful.

147
 Chapter 12: Monitoring Maps, Scrutinizing Stocks, and Watching Weather
Get route maps and driving directions
You can get route maps and driving directions to any location from any loca-
tion in a couple of ways:
 
✓ If there is already a pushpin on the screen: Tap the pushpin and then 
tap the little > in a blue circle to the right of the name or description. 
This action displays the item’s Info screen. Now tap the Directions to 
Here or Directions from Here button to get directions to or from that 
location, respectively.
 
✓ When you’re looking at a map screen: Tap the Directions button at the 
bottom of the map screen. The Start and End fields appear at the top of 
the screen.
 
 Type the starting and ending points or choose them from your book-
marks, recent maps, or contacts if you prefer. If you want to swap the 
starting and ending locations, tap the little swirly arrow button to the 
left of the Start and End fields.
 
 When the start and end locations are correct, tap the Route button in 
the bottom-right corner of the screen and the route map appears, as 
shown on the left side in Figure 12-5.
 
 If you need to change the start or end location, tap the Edit button in 
the top-left corner. If everything looks right, tap the Start button in the 
top-right corner to receive turn-by-turn driving directions, as shown 
on the right side in Figure 12-5. To see the next step in the directions, 
tap the right-facing arrow in the top-right corner; to see the previous 
step, tap the left-facing arrow in the top-right corner.
 
 
 Figure 12-5: The route map from Bob’s first house in Skokie to Gullivers 
Pizza in Chicago (left) and the first step in the step-by-step driving 
directions for that route (right).

148
Part IV: The Internet iPhone 
If you prefer your driving directions dis-
played as a list with all of the steps, as shown 
in Figure 12-6, tap the curling page button in 
the lower-right corner and then tap the List 
button.
When you’re finished with the step-by-step 
directions, tap the Search button at the 
bottom of the screen to return to the regular 
map screen and single search field.
 
As well as this works, we wish the iPhone 
offered the type of audible turn-by-turn 
directions feature found on some rival GPS 
devices. You know — where some friendly 
male or female voice barks out instructions 
(such as “turn right on Main Street”). Of 
course, it’s entirely possible that Apple or 
one of its third-party application developers 
may have added this capability by the time 
you read this.
Get traffic info in real time
You can find out the traffic conditions for 
whatever map you’re viewing by tapping the 
curling page button in the lower-right corner 
and then tapping the Show Traffic button. 
When you do this, major roadways are color-
coded to inform you of the current traffic 
speed, as shown in Figure 12-7. Here’s the key:
 
✓ Green: 50 or more miles per hour
 
✓ Yellow: 25 to 50 miles per hour
 
✓ Red: Under 25 miles per hour
 
✓ Gray: No data available at this time
 
Traffic info doesn’t work in every location, 
but the only way to find out is to give it a 
try. If no color codes appear, assume that it 
doesn’t work for that particular location.
Figure 12-6: Step-by-step driving 
directions displayed as a list.
Figure 12-7: Traffic is moving really 
slow where the road is red, kind of 
slow where it’s yellow, and nice and 
fast where it’s green.

149
 Chapter 12: Monitoring Maps, Scrutinizing Stocks, and Watching Weather
More about the Info screen
If a location has a little > in a blue circle to the right of its name or descrip-
tion (refer to Figure 12-2), you can tap it to see the location’s Info screen.
As we explained earlier in this chapter, you can get directions to or from that 
location, add the location to your bookmarks or contacts, or create a new 
contact from it, but there are still two more things you can do with a location 
from its Info screen:
 
✓ Tap its phone number to call it.
 
✓ Tap its URL to launch Safari and view its Web site.
Taking Stock with Stocks
Stocks is another Internet-enabled application on your iPhone. It’s a one-trick 
pony, but if you need its trick — information about specific stocks — it’s a 
winner.
Every time you open the Stocks application by tapping its icon on the Home 
screen, it displays the latest price for your stocks, with two provisos:
 
✓ The quotes may be delayed by up to 20 minutes.
 
✓ The quotes are updated only if your iPhone can connect to the Internet 
via either Wi-Fi or a wireless data network.
So tap that Stocks icon and take a peek.
The first time you open Stocks, you see information for the Dow Jones 
Industrial Average (^DJI), Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG), Yahoo! (YHOO), 
and AT&T (T) as the default stocks. Because the chance of you owning that 
exact group of stocks is slim, this section shows you how to add your own 
stocks and delete any or all of the default stocks.
Here’s how to add a stock:
 
1. Tap the i button in the bottom-right corner of the initial Stocks screen.
 
 The i is for info.
 
2. Tap the + button in the top-left corner of the Stocks screen.
 
3. Type a stock symbol, or a company, index, or fund name.
 
4. Tap the Search button.
 
 Stocks finds the company or companies that match your search request.

150
Part IV: The Internet iPhone 
 
5. Tap the one you want to add.
 
 Repeat Steps 4 and 5 until you’re 
through adding stocks.
 
6. Tap the Done button in the top-right 
corner.
And here’s how to delete a stock:
 
1. Tap the i button in the bottom-right 
corner of the initial Stocks screen.
 
2. Tap the – button to the left of the 
stock’s name.
 
3. Tap the Delete button that appears to 
the right of the stock’s name.
 
 Repeat Steps 2 and 3 until all 
unwanted stocks have been deleted.
 
4. Tap the Done button.
That’s all there is to adding and deleting 
stocks. Figure 12-8 shows my Stocks screen 
after I deleted one stock and added two 
others.
Here are a few more things you can do with Stocks. By default, Stocks 
displays the change in a stock’s price in dollars. You can see the change 
expressed as a percentage in two ways. The easy way is to tap the number 
next to any stock (green numbers are positive; red numbers are negative). 
That toggles the display for all stocks. So if they’re currently displayed as dol-
lars, tapping any one of them switches them to percent — and vice versa.
The second way to do the same thing takes more steps: Tap the i button 
in the bottom-right corner of the initial Stocks screen. Then tap the % or 
Numbers button at the bottom of the screen. The numbers are displayed in 
the manner you choose. Tap the Done button in the top-right corner.
Now refer back to Figure 12-7 and note the chart at the bottom of the window. 
At the top of the chart, you see a bunch of numbers and letters, namely 1d, 
1w, 1m, 3m, 6m, 1y, and 2y. They are buttons you can tap to change the time 
period shown on the chart. They stand for 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 
6 months, 1 year, and 2 years, respectively. Tap one of them and the chart 
reflects that period of time.
Info button
Figure 12-8: The Stocks screen.

151
 Chapter 12: Monitoring Maps, Scrutinizing Stocks, and Watching Weather
Finally, to look up additional information 
about a stock at Yahoo.com, first tap the 
stock’s name to select it, and then tap the Y! 
button in the lower-left corner of the screen. 
Safari launches and displays the Yahoo.
com finance page for that stock, as shown in 
Figure 12-9.
Weather Watching
Weather is a simple application that provides 
you with the current weather forecast for the 
city or cities of your choice. By default, you 
see a six-day forecast for the chosen city, as 
shown in Figure 12-10.
If the background for the forecast is blue, as 
shown in Figure 12-9, it’s daytime (between 
6:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m.) in that city; if it’s a 
deep purple, it’s nighttime (between 6:00 
p.m. and 6:00 a.m.).
To add a city, first tap the i button in the 
bottom-right corner. Tap the + button in the 
upper-left corner and then type a city and 
state or zip code. Tap the Search button in 
the bottom-right corner of the screen. Tap 
the name of the found city. Add as many 
cities as you want this way.
To delete a city, tap the i button in the 
bottom-right corner. Tap the red – button to 
the left of its name, and then tap the Delete 
button that appears to the right of its name.
You can also choose between Fahrenheit and 
Celsius by first tapping the i button in the 
bottom-right corner and then tapping either 
the °F or °C button near the bottom of the 
screen.
When you’re finished, tap the Done button in 
the top-right corner of the screen.

page for Apple (AAPL).

Austin, TX.

Part IV: The Internet iPhone 
If you’ve added more than one city to 
Weather, you can switch between them by 
flicking your finger across the screen to the 
left or the right.
 
See the three little dots — one white and 
two gray — at the bottom of the screen in 
Figure 12-10? They denote the number of 
cities you have stored (which is three in 
this case).
Last, but not least, to see detailed weather 
information about a city at Yahoo.com, tap 
the Y! button in the lower-left corner of the 
screen. Safari launches and then displays the 
Yahoo.com weather page for the current city, 
as shown in Figure 12-11.
Figure 12-11: Detailed weather on 
Yahoo.com is just a tap away.

Part V
The Undiscovered 
iPhone

T
his part is where we show you what’s under 
the hood and how to conﬁ gure your iPhone to 
your liking. Then we look at the things to do if 
your iPhone ever becomes recalcitrant. 
In Chapter 13 we explore every single iPhone set-
ting that’s not discussed in depth elsewhere in the 
book. iPhone offers dozens of different prefer-
ences and settings to make your iPhone your very 
own; by the time you ﬁ nish with Chapter 13, you’ll 
know how to customize every part of your iPhone 
that can be customized. 
We love going on a shopping spree as much as the 
next guy. Chapter 14 is all about learning to shop 
in the brand new iPhone App Store, an emporium 
replete with a gaggle of neat little programs and 
applications. Best of all, unlike most of the stores 
you shop in, a good number of the items can be 
had for free. 
iPhones are well-behaved little beasts for the most 
part, except when they’re not. Like the little girl 
with the little curl, when they’re good they’re 
very, very good, but when they’re bad, they’re 
horrid. So Chapter 15 is your comprehensive 
guide to troubleshooting for the iPhone. It details 
what to do when almost anything goes wrong, 
offering step-by-step instructions for speciﬁ c situ-
ations as well as a plethora of tips and techniques 
you can try if something else goes awry. You may 
never need Chapter 15 (and we hope you won’t), 
but you’ll be very glad we put it here if your 
iPhone ever goes wonky on you.

re you a control freak? The type of person who must have it your way? 
Boy, have you landed in the right chapter.
Throughout this book we’ve had an occasion to drop in on Settings, which 
is kind of the makeover factory for the iPhone. For example, we’ve 
come to Settings (by tapping its Home screen icon) to set ring-
tones, change the phone’s background or wallpaper, and specify 
Google or Yahoo! as the search engine of choice. We’ve also 
altered security settings in Safari, tailored e-mail to our liking 
(among other modifications), and gotten a handle on how 
to “fetch” or “push” new data.
 
Settings on the iPhone is roughly analogous to the Control 
Panel in Windows and System Preferences on a Mac.
Because we covered some settings elsewhere, we won’t 
dwell on every setting here. But there’s plenty still to dis-
cover to help you make the iPhone your own.

Part V: The Undiscovered iPhone 
Sky-High Settings
When you first arrive in Settings, you see the 
scrollable list shown in Figure 13-1. In all but 
Airplane Mode (at the very top of the list), a 
greater-than symbol (>) appears to the right 
of each listing. This symbol tells you the list-
ing has a bunch of options. Throughout this 
chapter, you tap the > symbol to check out 
those options.
If you scroll down to the bottom of the 
Settings list, you may see settings that per-
tain to some of the specific third-party apps 
you’ve added to the iPhone (as discussed in 
Chapter 14).
Airplane Mode
Using a cell phone on an airplane is a no-no. 
But there’s nothing verboten about using 
an iPod on a plane to listen to music, watch 
videos, and peek at pictures. At least, once 
the craft’s reached cruising altitude.
So how do you take advantage of the iPhone’s built-in iPod (among other 
capabilities) while temporarily turning off its phone, e-mail, and Internet func-
tions? By turning on Airplane Mode.
To do so, merely tap Airplane Mode on the Settings screen to display On 
(rather than Off).
That act disables each of the iPhone’s wireless radios: Wi-Fi, Edge, 3G (if appli-
cable), and Bluetooth. While in Airplane Mode, you can’t make or receive calls, 
surf the Web, watch YouTube, or do anything else that requires an Internet 
connection. The good news is that Airplane Mode keeps your battery running 
longer — particularly useful if the flight you’re on is taking you halfway around 
the world.
 
 The appearance of a tiny airplane icon in the status bar at the upper left 
reminds you that Airplane Mode is turned on. Just remember to turn it off 
when you’re back on the ground.
Figure 13-1: Presenting your list of 
Settings.

157
 Chapter 13: Setting You Straight on Settings
 
If you plug the iPhone into an iPod 
accessory that isn’t necessarily com-
patible because of possible interfer-
ence from the iPhone’s wireless 
radios, it offers to turn on Airplane 
Mode for you, as the message dis-
played in Figure 13-2 indicates.
Wi-Fi
As we’ve mentioned before, Wi-Fi is 
typically the fastest wireless network 
you can use to surf the Web, send 
e-mail, and perform other Internet 
tricks on the iPhone.
You use the Wi-Fi setting to determine which Wi-Fi networks are available to 
you and which one to exploit based on its signal.
Tap Wi-Fi and all Wi-Fi networks in range 
are displayed, as shown in Figure 13-3. 
(Alternatively, you can reach this screen by 
tapping the General setting, tapping Network, 
and then tapping Wi-Fi.)
A signal strength indicator can help you 
choose the network to connect to if more 
than one is listed; tap the appropriate Wi-Fi 
network when you’ve reached a decision. If a 
network is password-protected, you’ll see a 
lock icon.
You can also turn the Ask to Join Networks 
setting on or off. Networks that the iPhone 
is already familiar with are joined automati-
cally, regardless of which one you choose. 
If the Ask feature is on, you’re asked before 
joining a new network. If it’s off, you have to 
select a network manually.
 
If you’ve used a particular network automati-
cally in the past but you no longer want your 
iPhone to join it, tap the > symbol next to the 
network in question (within Wi-Fi settings) and then tap Forget This Network. 
The iPhone develops a quick case of very selective amnesia.
Figure 13-2: Saying yes to this message may 
eliminate the static.
Figure 13-3: Checking out your Wi-Fi 
options.

158
Part V: The Undiscovered iPhone 
 
In some instances, you have to supply other technical information about a 
network you hope to glom onto. You encounter a bunch of nasty-sounding 
terms: DHCP, Boot IP, Static, IP Address, Subnet Mask, Router, DNS, Search 
Domains, Client ID, HTTP Proxy, and Renew Lease. (At least this last one has 
nothing to do with real estate or the vehicle you’re driving.) Chances are that 
none of this info is on the tip of your tongue — but that’s okay. For one thing, 
it’s a pretty good bet that you’ll never need to know this stuff. What’s more, 
even if you do have to fill in or adjust these settings, a network administrator 
or techie friend can probably help you out.
Sometimes, you may want to connect to a network that’s closed and not 
shown on the Wi-Fi list. If that’s the case, tap Other and use the keyboard 
to enter the network name. Then tap to choose the type of security set-
ting the network is using (if any). Your choices are WEP, WPA, WPA2, WPA 
Enterprise, and WPA2 Enterprise. Again, it’s not exactly the friendliest termi-
nology, but we figure that someone nearby can provide assistance.
 
If no Wi-Fi network is available, you have to rely on 3G or EDGE. If that’s not 
available either, you won’t be able to rocket into cyberspace until you regain 
access to a network.
Settings for Your Senses
The next bunch of settings control what the iPhone looks like and sounds like.
Sounds
Consider Sounds the iPhone’s soundstage. Here’s where you can turn audio 
alerts on or off for a variety of functions: new voicemails, new text messages, 
new mail, sent mail, and calendar alerts. This is also where you set ringtones 
(as described in Chapter 4).
Other options: You can decide whether you want to hear lock sounds and 
keyboard clicks. You can determine whether the iPhone should vibrate when 
you get a call. And you can drag the volume slider to determine how loud 
your ringer and alerts will be.
There is an alternative: You can use the physical Volume buttons on the side 
of the iPhone for this purpose, provided you’re not already on a call or using 
the iPod to listen to music or watch video.

Brightening up your day
Who doesn’t want a bright, vibrant screen? 
Alas, the brightest screens exact a tradeoff: 
Before you drag the brightness slider shown 
in Figure 13-4 to the max, remember that 
brighter screens sap the life out of your 
battery more quickly.
 
That’s why we recommend tapping the Auto-
Brightness control so that it is On. It adjusts 
the screen according to the lighting condi-
tions around the iPhone while being consid-
erate of your battery.
Wallpaper
Choosing wallpaper is a neat way to dress 
up the iPhone according to your taste. You 
can sample the pretty patterns and designs 
that the iPhone has already chosen for you 
by tapping the thumbnails shown in Figure 
13-5. Of course, although the Mona Lisa is 
one of your choices, DaVinci 
may not quite compete with 
the masterpieces in your 
own photo albums (more 
about those in Chapter 9). 
After making a selection, tap 
the image and then tap Set 
Wallpaper.
In General
Certain miscellaneous set-
tings are difficult to pigeon-
hole. Apple wisely lumped 
these under the General 
settings moniker. Here’s a 
closer look.

adjusts screen brightness.

Part V: The Undiscovered iPhone 
About About
You are not seeing double. This section is all about the setting known as 
About. And About is full of trivial (and not-so-trivial) information about the 
device. What you’ll find here is pretty straightforward:
 
✓ Name of your network.
 
✓ Number of songs stored on the device.
 
✓ Number of videos.
 
✓ Number of photos.
 
✓ Storage capacity used and available. Because of the way the device is 
formatted, you’ll always have a little less storage than the advertised 
amount of flash memory.
 
✓ Software version. We were up to 2.0 as this book was being published. 
But as the software gets tweaked and updated, your device goes a little 
beyond. So in parentheses next to the version number, you’ll see some-
thing like 5A347. That (or another string of numbers and letters) is the 
build number of the software version you have. It changes when the 
iPhone’s software is updated.
 
✓ Serial and model numbers.
 
✓ Wi-Fi address.
 
✓ Bluetooth address. (More on Bluetooth shortly.)
 
✓ IMEI and ICCID. Say what? These stand for the International Mobile 
Equipment Identity and Integrated Circuit Card Identifier (or Smart 
Card) numbers. Hey, we warned you some of this was trivial.
 
✓ Modern firmware. The version of the cellular transmitter.
 
✓ Legal. You had to know that the lawyers would get their two cents in 
somehow. All the fine print is here. And fine print it is. Although you can 
flick to scroll through these lengthy legal notices, you can’t pinch the 
screen to enlarge the text. (Not that we can imagine more than a handful 
of you will bother to read this legal mumbo-jumbo.)
Using Usage
Think of the Usage setting as one of the places to go on the iPhone for sta-
tistics on how you actually employ the device. You get other information in 
the About setting (under General on the Settings screen), described a little 
earlier in this chapter.

161
 Chapter 13: Setting You Straight on Settings
You can scroll up or down the Usage list to discover the following:
 
✓ The amount of time since you last fully charged your iPhone: This 
is indicated in days and hours, both for the time when the iPhone 
has been unlocked and used and also when it’s been locked and in 
standby mode.
 
✓ Call time: Shown for the current period and for the lifetime of the
 product.
 
✓ Cellular Network Data: The amount of network data you’ve sent and 
received over EDGE or 3G. You can reset these statistics by tapping the 
Reset Statistics button at the bottom of the screen.
Network
There are four major controls under Network settings, one of which, Wi-Fi, 
we have already addressed. The others are Enable 3G, Data Roaming, and 
VPN. In this section, we tackle them one by one.
Enable 3G
As you’re aware by now, the major benefit of AT&T’s 3G network is that it’s a 
lot faster than EDGE (though still not as zippy as Wi-Fi). That said, you’re not 
always going to be carrying the iPhone in a 3G area — and even when you are 
in coverage, you won’t always need to take advantage of faster data speeds. 
Under these circumstances, tap the Enable 3G button so that Off is showing. 
Why turn off 3G? The faster network also drains your battery a lot faster. Tap 
Enable 3G to turn the network back on when you need to.
Of course, the Enable 3G option only turns up on the iPhone 3G.
Data Roaming
You may unwittingly rack up lofty roaming fees when using Safari, exchanging 
e-mails, and engaging in other data-heavy activities while traveling abroad. 
Turn off Data Roaming to avoid those excess charges.
FYI on VPN
 
A virtual private network, or VPN, is a way for you to securely access your 
company’s network behind the firewall — using an encrypted Internet con-
nection that acts as a secure “tunnel” for data. The 2.0 version of the iPhone 
software supports something called Cisco IPSec VPN, which apparently pro-
vides the kind of security network administrators want.

162
Part V: The Undiscovered iPhone 
iPhone also supports VPN protocols known as L2TP (Layer 2 Tunneling 
Protocol) and PPTP (Point-To-Point Tunneling Protocol).
You can configure a VPN on the iPhone by tapping VPN under Network, 
tapping Add VPN Configuration, and by tapping one of the aforementioned 
protocols. Then using configuration settings provided by your company, fill 
in the appropriate server information, account, password, encryption level 
(if appropriate), and so on. Better yet, lend your iPhone to the techies at the 
place you work and let them fill in the blanks on your behalf.
After you’ve configured your iPhone for VPN usage, you can turn that 
capability on or off by tapping (yep) the VPN On or Off switch inside 
Settings.
Brushing up on Bluetooth
Of all the peculiar terms you may encounter in techdom, Bluetooth is one of 
our favorites. The name is derived from a tenth-century Danish king named 
Harald Blåtand, who, the story goes, helped unite warring factions. And, 
we’re told, Blatand translates to Bluetooth in English. (Bluetooth is all about 
collaboration between different types of devices, get it?)
Blåtand was obviously ahead of his time. Although we can’t imagine he ever 
dialed a cell phone, today he has an entire short-range wireless technology 
named in his honor. On the iPhone, you can use Bluetooth to communicate 
wirelessly with a compatible Bluetooth headset or hands-free car kit. Such 
optional headsets and kits are made by Apple and many others. They’ve 
become more of a big deal as a number of states and municipalities around 
the U.S. make it illegal to hold a phone up to your mouth and ear to gab while 
you’re driving.
To ensure that the iPhone works with one of these devices, it has to be wire-
lessly paired, or coupled, with the chosen device. With the optional iPhone 
Bluetooth headset that Apple sells, you can automatically pair the devices by 
placing the iPhone and headset in a dual dock (supplied with the headset), 
which you connect to your computer.
If you’re using a third-party accessory, follow the instructions that came with 
that headset or car kit so that it becomes discoverable, or ready to be paired 
with your iPhone. Then turn on Bluetooth (under General on the Settings 
screen) so that the iPhone can find such nearby devices, and the device can 
find the iPhone. Bluetooth works up to a range of about 30 feet.

163
 Chapter 13: Setting You Straight on Settings
 
 You’ll know Bluetooth is turned on when you see the Bluetooth icon in the 
status bar. If the symbol is blue or white, the iPhone is communicating wire-
lessly with a connected device. (The color differences are to provide contrast 
to whatever is behind it.) If it’s gray, Bluetooth is turned on in the iPhone but 
a paired device is not nearby or is not turned on.
To unpair a device, select it from the device 
list shown in Figure 13-6 and tap Unpair.
 
As of this writing, the iPhone’s Bluetooth 
capability was pretty limited compared 
to what Bluetooth can do on some other 
devices. It doesn’t work with stereo Bluetooth 
headsets. You can’t use Bluetooth to 
exchange files or sync with a computer wire-
lessly. Nor can you use it to print stuff from 
the iPhone through a Bluetooth printer. 
That’s because the iPhone does not support 
any of the Bluetooth profiles (or specifica-
tions) required to allow such wireless stunts 
to take place.
Location Services
Location, location, location. Through Maps, 
through (several) Apps, and by geotagging 
photos taken with its camera, the iPhone 
makes good use of knowing where you are. 
The iPhone 3G exploits its built-in GPS, but 
even the older-generation iPhone can find your general whereabouts (by tri-
angulating signals from Wi-Fi base stations and cellular towers).
If that creeps you out a little, don’t 
fret. To protect your right of privacy, 
individual apps will pop up a quick mes-
sage (like the one shown in Figure 13-7) 
asking whether you would like them to 
use your current location. But you can 
also turn off Location Services right 
here in Settings. Not only is your pri-
vacy shielded, but you’ll also keep your 
iPhone battery juiced a little longer.

unpairing devices.

where you are.

Part V: The Undiscovered iPhone 
Auto-lock
You can set the amount of time that elapses before the phone automatically 
locks or turns off the display. Your choices are five minutes before, four min-
utes before, and so on, all the way down to one minute. Or you can set it so 
that the iPhone never locks automatically.
 
If you work for a company that insists on a passcode (see next section), the 
“Never” Auto-lock option will not be on the list your iPhone shows you.
Don’t worry if the iPhone is locked. You can still get calls and text messages 
and adjust the volume.
Passcode
You can choose a passcode to prevent people from unlocking the phone. 
Tap Passcode Lock. Then use the virtual keypad to enter a 4-digit code. 
During this setup, you have to enter the code a second time before it is 
accepted.
You can determine whether a passcode is required immediately, after 1 
minute, after 5 minutes or after 15 minutes. Shorter times are more secure, 
of course.
You can also change the passcode or turn it off later (unless your employer 
dictates otherwise), but you need to know the present passcode to apply any 
changes. If you forget the passcode, you have to restore the iPhone’s soft-
ware, as described in Chapter 15.
One more security setting you’ll find in the Change Passcode section: You get 
to choose whether to show an SMS (text message) Preview or not to show 
such a Preview.
Restrictions
Parents and bosses may love the new Restrictions settings, but kids and 
employees usually think otherwise. You can turn on settings to prevent a 
user from encountering explicit language, using the Safari browser, YouTube, 
or iTunes, and installing new Apps. When restrictions are in place, the icons 
for those off-limits functions can no longer be seen.
Stop feeling guilty: You only have users’ best interests at heart.

165
 Chapter 13: Setting You Straight on Settings
There’s no place like the Home button
You can assign one of three shortcuts to double-tapping the Home button. 
The first, Home, takes you to the Home screen on your iPhone; the second, 
Phone Favorites, instantly transports you to the Phone Favorites screen; 
the last, iPod, opens the iPod app. The default is like Dorothy of Kansas . . . 
if you don’t change this setting, double-tapping the Home button will bring 
you back to the Home screen. Why? Because there’s no place like Home. 
(Groan.)
Finally, switch the iPod Controls setting to On if you want iPod controls to 
appear when you double-tap the Home button while music is playing.
Date and time
In our neck of the woods, the time is reported as 11:32 PM (or whatever time 
it happens to be). But in some circles, it’s reported as 23:32. If you prefer the 
latter format on the iPhone’s status bar, tap the 24-Hour Time setting (under 
Date & Time) so that it’s On.
This is just one of the settings you can adjust under Date & Time. You can 
also have the iPhone set the time automatically, using the time reported by 
the cellular network (and adjusted for the time zone you’re in).
If automatic time-setting is turned off, you’ll be asked to choose the time zone 
and then set the date and time manually. Here’s how:
 
1. Tap Set Automatically so it’s Off.
 
 You see fields for setting the time zone and the date and time.
 
2. Tap the Time Zone field.
 
 The current time zone and virtual keyboard are shown.
 
3. Tap out the letters of the city or country whose time zone you want to 
enter until the one you have in mind appears. Then tap the name of 
that city or country.
 
 The Time Zone is automatically filled in for that city.
 
4. Tap the Set Date & Time field so that the time is shown. Then roll the 
bicycle-lock-like controls until the proper time is displayed.
 
5. Tap the date shown so that the bicycle-lock-like controls pop up for 
the date. Then roll the wheels for the month, day, and year until the 
correct date appears.
 
6. Tap the Date & Time button to return to the main Date & Time settings 
screen.

166
Part V: The Undiscovered iPhone 
Keyboard
Under Keyboard settings, you can turn Auto-Capitalization on or off and turn 
Enable Caps Lock on or off.
Auto-capitalization, which the iPhone turns on by default, means that the 
first letter of the first word you type after ending a previous sentence with a 
period, question mark, or exclamation point will be capitalized.
If Cap Locks is enabled, all letters are uppercased LIKE THIS if you double-tap 
the Shift key. (The Shift key is the one with the arrow pointing north.)
You can also turn on a keyboard setting that inserts a period followed by a 
space when you double-tap the spacebar. Additionally, you can choose to 
use an international keyboard (as discussed in Chapter 2), which you choose 
from the International setting — the very next setting after Keyboard in the 
General settings area.
Reset
As little kids playing sports, we’d end an argument by agreeing to a “do-over.” 
Well, the Reset settings on the iPhone are one big do-over. Now that we’re 
(presumably) grown up, we’re wise enough to think long and hard about 
the consequences before implementing do-over settings. That said, you may 
encounter good reasons for starting over; some of these are addressed in 
Chapter 15.
Here are your reset options:
 
✓ Reset All Settings: Tapping here resets all settings, but no data or media 
is deleted.
 
✓ Erase All Content and Settings: This resets all settings and wipes out all 
your data.
 
✓ Reset Network Settings: This deletes the current network settings and 
restores them to their factory defaults.
 
✓ Reset Keyboard Dictionary: As we pointed out early on, the iPhone’s 
keyboard is intelligent. And one reason it’s so smart is that it learns from 
you. So when you reject words that the iPhone keyboard suggests, it 
figures the words you specifically banged out ought to be added to the 
keyboard dictionary. Tapping Reset here removes those added words 
from the dictionary.
 
✓ Reset Home Screen Layout: All the icons will be back the way they were 
at the factory.
 
✓ Reset Location Warnings: These too will be restored to factory defaults.

Phoning In More Settings
We’ve already covered most of the remaining settings in previous chapters 
devoted to e-mail, calendars, the iPod (photos and music), Safari, and e-mail. 
Still, there are few more we didn’t get to — ’til now.
Sorting and displaying contacts
Do you think of us as Ed and Bob or Baig and LeVitus? The answer to that 
question will probably determine whether you choose to sort your Contacts 
list alphabetically by last name or first.
Tap Mail, Contacts, Calendars, scroll down to the Contacts section, and peek 
at Sort Order. Then tap Last, First or First, Last.
You can also determine whether you want to display a first name or last 
name first. Tap Display Order and then choose First, Last, or Last, First.
Nothing phone-y about these settings
Long ago and far away in Chapter 4, we tipped our hand and indicated that 
we’d save a few more phone tricks — those found in Phone settings — for 
this chapter.
So tap Phone now to review some of the choices we didn’t get to previously. 
Be aware that you have to scroll down the screen to find Phone settings.
Call forwarding
If you expect to spend time in an area with poor cell-phone coverage or none 
at all, you may want to temporarily forward calls to a landline or other por-
table handset. Here are the simple steps:
 
1. On the Settings screen, tap Phone and then tap Call Forwarding.
 
2. Tap to turn on Call Forwarding.
 
3. Use the virtual keypad to enter the number where you want incoming 
calls to ring.
 
4. Tap the Call Forwarding button to return to the main Call Forwarding 
screen.
To change the forwarding number, tap the circle with the X in the phone 
number field to get rid of the old number, and then enter a new one.

168
Part V: The Undiscovered iPhone 
Remember to turn off Call Forwarding to receive calls directly on your iPhone 
again.
 
You must have cellular coverage while setting the Call Forwarding feature.
Call waiting
Tap the Call Waiting button to turn the feature on or off. If Call Waiting is off 
and you are speaking on the phone, the call is automatically dispatched to 
voicemail.
Displaying Caller ID
Don’t want your name or number displayed on the phone you’re calling? 
Make sure to tap Show My Caller ID so it is Off. If privacy isn’t a concern, you 
can leave this setting On.
TTY
Folks who are hearing impaired sometimes rely on a teletype, or TTY, machine, 
to hold conversations. You can use the iPhone with standard TTY devices by 
plugging a cable from the TTY device into an optional $19 iPhone TTY adapter 
and then plugging the adapter into the iPhone. Make sure the TTY setting on 
the phone is turned On.
Locking your SIM
The tiny SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) card inside your iPhone holds 
your phone number and other important data. Tap to turn on SIM PIN and 
enter a password with the keypad. That way, if someone gets hold of your 
SIM, he or she can’t use it in another phone without the password.
 
If you assign a PIN to your SIM, you have to enter it to turn the iPhone off and 
on again.
AT&T Services
There’s a major difference between the iPhone and all the other Apple prod-
ucts you might buy. That’s because you are entering into a relationship not 
only with Apple but also with the phone company. Tap AT&T Services and 
then tap any of the following for a shortcut phone call to
 
✓ Check Bill Balance: The phone dials *225# and, if all goes according to 
plan, you receive a text message with the due date and sum owed. Such 
text messages are not counted against your messaging allotment.
 
✓ Call Directory Assistance: The phone dials 411.

169
 Chapter 13: Setting You Straight on Settings
 
✓ Pay My Bill: The iPhone dials *729 and you are connected to an auto-
mated voice system. You can pay your bill with a checking account, 
debit card, or credit card by following the voice prompts.
 
 You are billed for phone service from AT&T, not Apple. Of course, 
charges for any music or other content purchased in iTunes from your 
computer are paid to Apple through whichever credit card you have on 
file, as with any iPod.
 
✓ View My Minutes: This time *646# is called. You again receive a text 
reply that doesn’t count against your messaging allotment.
 
✓ Voice Connect: The iPhone dials *08 to connect you to automated news, 
weather, sports, quotes, and more. Just bark out the kind of informa-
tion you’re looking for, such as “finance,” and follow voice prompts for 
stock quotes, business news, and so on. Or say “sports” and follow voice 
prompts to get the latest scores of your favorite team.
 
 Not all AT&T Services make a phone call. If you tap the AT&T 
MyAccount button, Safari opens an AT&T account management page 
on the Web.
We trust that you control freaks are satisfied with all the stuff you can manage 
inside Settings. Still, the iPhone may not always behave as you want. For the 
times when things get out of control, we highly recommend Chapter 15.

O
ne of the best things about the iPhone these days is that you 
can download and install applications created by so-called 
“third parties,” which is to say not created by Apple (the first 
party) or you (the second party). At this writing, hundreds of 
applications are available; by the time you read this there 
will no doubt be thousands. Some are free, others cost 
money; some are useful, others are lame; some are per-
fectly well-behaved, others quit unexpectedly (or worse). 
The point is that a lot of apps are available — and some 
are better than others.
You can obtain and install applications for your iPhone in 
two ways:
 
✓ On your computer
 
✓ On your iPhone
To use the App Store on your iPhone, it must be connected to the Internet. 
And if you obtain an app on your computer, it won’t be available on your 
iPhone until you sync it with your computer.

172
Part V: The Undiscovered iPhone 
But before you can use the App Store on your iPhone or your computer, you 
first need an iTunes Store account. So if you don’t already have one, we sug-
gest you launch iTunes on your computer and choose Store➪Create Account 
to set one up.
 
Let’s put it this way: If you don’t have an iTunes Store account, you won’t be 
able to download a single cool app for your iPhone. ’Nuff said.
Using Your Computer to Find Apps
Okay, start by finding cool iPhone applications using iTunes on your com-
puter. Follow these steps:
 
1. Launch iTunes.
 
2. Click the iTunes Store in the source list on the left.
 
 
3. Click the App Store link.
 
 The iTunes App Store appears as shown in Figure 14-1.
How to look for apps from your computer
Now that you’ve got the iTunes App Store on your screen, you have a couple 
of options for exploring its virtual aisles. Allow us to introduce you to the 
various “departments” available from the main screen.
Browsing the App Store screen
The main departments are featured in the middle of the screen, and ancillary 
departments appear on either side of them. Let’s start with the ones in the 
middle:
 
✓ The New department has eight visible icons (Vicinity to Shazam in 
Figure 14-1) representing apps that are (what else?) new.
 
 There are only eight icons visible, but the New department actually has 
more than that. Look to the right end of the title bar for each depart-
ment shown down the center section of the screen. Notice the little 
arrow inside a circle and the words See All? Click the See All link to show 
all the apps in that department on a single screen. Or, you can click the 
little arrow inside a circle on the left or right edge of the departments to 
see another screen full (eight more in the case of the New department) 
of icons. Finally, the little dots in the middle of the title bar for each 
department tell you how many screens that department contains (three 
in the case of the New department).

Figure 14-1: The iTunes App Store in all its glory.
 
✓ The What’s Hot department features eight icons (SmugShot to PayPal in 
Figure 14-1) representing apps that are popular with other iPhone users.
 
✓ The Staff Favorites department shows eight icons (although you can see 
only the first four — Critter Crunch to Phone Saber — and a tiny bit of 
the tops of the next four in Figure 14-1) of apps that are highly recom-
mended by the iTunes Store staff.
 
Apple has a habit of redecorating the iTunes Stores every so often, so allow 
us to apologize in advance if things don’t look or act exactly as described 
here.

174
Part V: The Undiscovered iPhone 
There are also display ads for six featured apps between the New and What’s 
Hot departments (Texas Hold ’em to Jott for iPhone).
The little dots in the middle of the title bars of these departments — three dots 
for the New and What’s Hot departments and two dots for Staff Favorites — tell 
you how many screens of additional apps are available. And the little arrows 
on the left and right sides of the departments let you navigate to these addi-
tional screens.
Two other departments appear to the right of the main ones: Top Paid Apps, 
and one of our favorite departments, Top Free Apps. The number-one app 
displays both its icon and its name; the next nine apps show text links only.
Finally, to the left of the main departments is a special navigation department 
known as Categories, with text links to describe each one. Click these links to 
see the available apps that fit each category description.
Using the Search field
Browsing the screen is great, but if you know exactly what you’re looking for 
we have good news and bad news. The good news is that there’s a faster way. 
Just type a word or phrase into the Search iTunes Store field in the upper-
right corner of the main iTunes window, as shown in Figure 14-2, and then 
press Enter or Return to initiate the search.
 
 
Figure 14-2: I’d like to be able to use my iPhone as a flashlight, so I searched 
 
for the word flashlight.

175
 Chapter 14: Apply Here (to Find Out About iPhone Apps)
The bad news is that you have to search the entire iTunes Store, which 
includes music, television shows, movies, and other stuff in addition to 
iPhone apps.
Ah, but there’s more good news: Your search results are segregated into 
categories — one of which is Applications, as shown in Figure 14-2. And 
here’s even more good news: If you click the See All link at the right end of 
the Application category’s title bar, all iPhone applications that match your 
search word or phrase appear.
Getting more information about an app
Now that you know how to find apps in the App Store, this section delves a 
little deeper and shows you how to find out more about an application that 
interests you.
Checking out the detail screen from your computer
To find out more about an application icon, featured app, or text link on any 
of the iTunes App Store screens, just click it. A detail screen like the one 
shown in Figure 14-3 appears.
 
 
 Figure 14-3: The detail screen for Tap Tap Revenge, a nifty little free game that’s kind of like 
Guitar Hero for your iPhone.

176
Part V: The Undiscovered iPhone 
This screen should tell you most of what you need to know about the applica-
tion, such as basic product information and a narrative description, what’s 
new in this version, the language it’s presented in, and the system require-
ments to run the app.
 
Bear in mind that the application description on this screen was written 
by the application’s developer and may be somewhat biased. Never fear, 
gentle reader; in the next section we show you how to find reviews of the 
application — written by people who have actually used it.
Notice that this application is rated 4+, as you can see below the Get App 
button near the top of Figure 14-3. That means that this app contains no 
objectionable material. Here are the other possible ratings:
 
✓ 9+: May contain mild or infrequent occurrences of cartoon, fantasy, or 
realistic violence; or infrequent or mild mature, suggestive, or horror-
themed content that may not be suitable for children under the age of 9.
 
✓ 12+: May contain infrequent mild language; frequent or intense cartoon, 
fantasy, or realistic violence; mild or infrequent mature or suggestive 
themes; or simulated gambling that may not be suitable for children 
under the age of 12.
 
✓ 17+: May contain frequent and intense offensive language; frequent and 
intense cartoon, fantasy, or realistic violence; mature, frequent and 
intense mature, suggestive, or horror-themed content; sexual content; 
nudity; depictions of alcohol, tobacco, or drugs that may not be suitable 
for children under the age of 17. You must be at least 17 years old to 
purchase games with this rating.
One other feature of the detail pages is worth mentioning, and that is the col-
lection of useful links below the application description. In Figure 14-3, these 
links include Tapulous Web Site, Tap Tap Revenge Support, All Applications 
By Tapulous, Tell A Friend, and so on. We urge you to explore these links at 
your leisure.
Reading reviews from your computer
If you scroll down the detail screen, near the bottom you’ll find a series of 
reviews by the app’s users (you can’t actually see these reviews in Figure 
14-3). Each review includes a star rating, from zero to five. If an app is rated 
four or higher, it’s a pretty good indication that the application is well liked 
by people who own it.
If you could scroll down the screen shown in Figure 14-3, you’d see that this 
application has an average rating of four-and-a-half stars based on 1,041 user 
reviews. You’d also see three or four recent reviews with their star ratings. And

Downloading an app
This part is simple. When you find an application you’d like to try, just click 
its Get App button. At that point, you have to log in to your iTunes Store 
account, even if the application is free.
After you’ve logged in, the application begins downloading. When it’s fin-
ished, the app appears in the Applications section of your iTunes Library, as 
shown in Figure 14-4.
 
Downloading an application to your iTunes Library is only the first half of get-
ting it onto your iPhone. After you download an app, you have to sync your 
iPhone before the application will be available on it.
Updating an app
Every so often the developer of an iPhone application releases an update. 
Sometimes these updates add new features to the application, sometimes 
they squash bugs, and sometimes they do both. In any event, updates are 
usually a good thing for you and your iPhone, so it makes sense to check for 
them every so often. To do this using iTunes, click the Check for Updates link 
near the bottom-right corner of the Applications screen, which you can see in 
Figure 14-4.
 
 
Figure 14-4: Applications you’ve downloaded appear in the Applications section of your 
 
iTunes Library.

Part V: The Undiscovered iPhone 
 
If you click the Get More Applications link next to the Check for Updates link, 
you’ll find yourself back at the main screen of the iTunes App Store, as shown 
in Figure 14-1.
Using Your iPhone to Find Apps
Finding apps with your iPhone is almost as easy as finding them using 
iTunes. The only requirement is that you have an Internet connection of 
some sort — Wi-Fi or wireless data network — to browse, search, download, 
and install apps.
 
 To get started, tap the App Store icon on your iPhone’s Home screen.
When you launch the App Store, you’ll see 
five icons at the bottom of the screen, repre-
senting five ways to interact with the store, 
as shown in Figure 14-5.
How to look for apps 
from your iPhone
The first three icons at the bottom of the 
screen — Featured, Categories, and Top 
25 — offer three ways to browse the virtual 
shelves of the App Store.
Browsing the iPhone App Store
The Featured section has two tabs at the top 
of the screen: New (shown in Figure 14-5) and 
What’s Hot. These two tabs represent two 
different pages full of apps.
The Top 25 section works the same way. Its 
two tabs — Top Paid and Top Free — repre-
sent pages of popular apps that either cost 
money (paid) or don’t (free).
 
Each page displays roughly 20–25 apps, but you see only four or five at a 
time on the screen. So remember to flick up or down if you want to see the 
others.
The Categories section works a little bit differently. It has no tabs and its 
main page contains no apps. Instead it offers a list of categories such as 
Figure 14-5: The icons across the 
bottom represent the five sections of 
the App Store.

179
 Chapter 14: Apply Here (to Find Out About iPhone Apps)
Books, Games, Lifestyle, Utilities, and so on. Tap a category to see a page full 
of apps of that type.
Using the Search icon
If you know exactly what you’re looking for, instead of simply browsing you 
can tap the Search icon and type a word or phrase.
Getting more information about 
a particular application
Now that you know how to find apps in the App Store, the following sections 
show you how to find out more about a particular application.
Checking out the detail screen from your iPhone
To learn more about any application on any 
page, tap it, and a detail screen like the one 
shown in Figure 14-6 appears.
 
Remember that the application description 
on this screen was written by the developer 
and may be somewhat biased.
 
Oddly enough, as of this writing, only the 17+ 
rating appears on a detail page. The other 
age ratings (4+, 9+, and 12+), discussed in 
the earlier section “Checking out the detail 
screen from your computer,” don’t appear.
Reading reviews from your iPhone
Scroll down to the bottom of any detail 
screen, and you find a star rating for that 
application. It’s also the link to that appli-
cation’s reviews; tap it to see a page full of 
them. At the bottom of that page is another 
link called More Reviews. Tap it to see (what 
else?) more reviews.
Downloading an App
To download an application to your iPhone, tap the price button near the top 
of its detail screen. In Figure 14-6, it’s the blue thing that says Free. You may 
or may not be asked to type your iTunes Store account password before the 
App Store disappears and you’re taken to the Home screen page where the 
Figure 14-6: This is the detail screen 
for Remote, a free application from 
Apple that lets you control iTunes or 
AppleTV from your iPhone.

180
Part V: The Undiscovered iPhone 
new application’s icon resides. The new icon 
appears, slightly dimmed, with the word 
Loading beneath it and a blue progress indica-
tor near its bottom, as shown in Figure 14-7.
By the way, if the app happens to be rated 
17+, you see a warning screen after you type 
your password. You have to click the OK 
button to confirm that you’re over 17 before 
the app downloads.
 
The application is now on your iPhone, but it 
won’t be copied to your iTunes library on your 
Mac or PC until your next sync. If your iPhone 
suddenly loses its memory (unlikely), or if 
you delete the application from your iPhone 
before you sync (as described later in this 
chapter), that application is gone forever.
After you download an app to your iPhone, 
the next time you sync your phone you’ll see 
a dialog box that informs you: “iTunes has 
found purchased items on the iPhone that 
are not present in your iTunes library. Do you 
want to transfer these items from this iPhone 
back to your iTunes library? If you do not 
transfer these purchased items to your iTunes library they will be removed 
from your iPhone.”  Your options are Transfer or Don’t Transfer. Click one.
By the way, although the dialog box refers to “purchased items,” you’ll see it 
even if the application was a freebie.
 
If an application is less than10MB in size, you can download it directly to the 
iPhone through the 3G cellular network or Wi-Fi. Larger programs require 
Wi-Fi or require you to sync up through iTunes on your PC or Mac.
Updating an app
As mentioned earlier in the chapter, every so often the developer of an 
iPhone application releases an update. To check for updates using the App 
Store on your iPhone, tap the Updates icon at the bottom of the screen.
If you see (in the middle of the screen) a message that says, “All Apps are 
Up-to-date,” none of the apps on your iPhone will require an update at this 
time. If an app needs updating, it appears with an Update button next to it. 
Tap the button to update the application. If more than one application needs 
updating, you can update them all at once by tapping the Update All button 
at the bottom of the screen.
Progress bar
Figure 14-7: This application is being 
downloaded; here the blue progress 
bar indicates that it’s about one-third 
done.

181
 Chapter 14: Apply Here (to Find Out About iPhone Apps)
 
If you try to update an application purchased from another iTunes Store 
account, you are prompted for that account’s ID and password. If you can’t 
provide them, you won’t be allowed to download the update.
Working with Applications
That’s almost everything you need to know about installing third-party appli-
cations on your iPhone. However, you might find it helpful to know how to 
delete, review, or report a problem with an app.
Deleting an app
You can delete an application in two ways: In iTunes on your computer or 
right from your iPhone.
To delete an application in iTunes, click Applications in the source list, and 
then either
 
✓ Click the application’s icon to select it and then choose Edit➪Delete.
 
 Or
 
✓ Right-click (Control+click on a Mac) the 
application’s icon and choose Delete.
Either way, you see a dialog box asking 
whether you’re sure you want to remove the 
selected application. If you click the Remove 
button, the application is removed from your 
iTunes library, as well as from any iPhone 
that syncs with your iTunes library.
Here’s how to delete an application on your 
iPhone:
 
1. Press and hold on any icon until all the 
icons begin to “wiggle.”
 
2. Tap the little “x” in the upper-left 
corner of the application you want to 
delete, as shown in Figure 14-8.
 
 A dialog box appears, informing you that 
deleting this application will also delete 
all its data.
 
3. Tap the Delete button, as shown in 
Figure 14-8.
Little Xes
Delete button
Figure 14-8: Tap an application’s little 
x, and then tap Delete to remove it 
from your iPhone.

182
Part V: The Undiscovered iPhone 
 
If you’ve synced your iPhone since you downloaded the application and 
transferred it to your iTunes library, deleting it from your iPhone won’t get 
rid of it permanently. The next time you sync, it will return to your iPhone 
like a bad penny. To get rid of it for good, you have to remove it from your 
iTunes library.
Writing an app review
Sometimes you love or hate an application so much that you want to tell the 
world about it. In that case, you should write a review. You can do this in two 
ways: In iTunes on your computer or right from your iPhone.
To write a review using iTunes, follow these steps:
 
1. Navigate to the detail page for the application in the iTunes App Store.
 
2. Scroll down the page to the Reviews section and click the Write a 
Review link.
 
 You may or may not have to type your iTunes store password at this point.
 
3. Click the button for the star rating you want to give the application 
(1 to 5).
 
4. In the Title field, type a title for your review.
 
5. In the Review field, type your review.
 
6. Click the Preview button when you’re finished.
The Preview screen appears. If the review looks good to you, click the Submit 
button. If you want to add something or edit it, click the Edit button. If you 
decide not to review the app after all, click the Cancel button.
To write a review from your iPhone, follow these steps:
 
1. Tap the App Store icon to launch the App Store.
 
2. Navigate to the detail screen for the application.
 
3. Scroll down the page to the Reviews item and tap it.
 
 
4. From the Reviews screen, tap the New Document icon.
 
5. Tap the Write a Review button.
 
 You may or may not have to type your iTunes store password at this point.
 
6. Tap one to five of the dots at the top of the Submit Review screen to 
rate the application.

183
 Chapter 14: Apply Here (to Find Out About iPhone Apps)
 
7. In the Title field, type a title for your review.
 
8. In the Review field, type your review.
 
9. Tap the Send button in the upper-right corner of the screen.
Whichever way you submit your review, Apple will review your submis-
sion. As long as it doesn’t violate the (unpublished) rules of conduct for app 
reviews, it will appear in a day or two in the App Store, in the Reviews section 
for the particular application.
Reporting a problem
Every so often you get an app that’s recalcitrant — a dud that doesn’t work 
properly, crashes, freezes, or otherwise messes up your iPhone. When this 
happens, you should definitely report the problem so that Apple and the 
developer know of the problem and (hopefully) can fix it.
We’re beginning to sound like parrots here, but once again, you can do this 
two ways: In iTunes on your computer or right from your iPhone.
Here’s how to report a problem with an app from iTunes:
 
1. Launch iTunes, choose Store➪Sign In, type your account name and 
password, and then click the Sign In button.
 
2. Choose Store➪View My Account.
 
3. Click the Purchase History button (even if the application was free).
 
4. Click the Report a Problem button at the bottom of the Purchase 
History screen.
 
5. Click the arrow to the left of the application that has the problem.
 
6. Click the Report a Problem link for the application that has the problem.
 
7. Choose a problem from the Problem drop-down menu. If your prob-
lem isn’t listed, choose “My concern isn’t listed here” and write about 
the problem in the Comments field.
 
8. Click the Submit button.
Frankly, we think it’s a bit easier to report a problem with an app from your 
iPhone. Here’s how to do that:
 
1. Tap the App Store icon to launch the App Store.
 
2. Navigate to the detail screen for the application.

184
Part V: The Undiscovered iPhone 
 
3. Scroll down the page to the Reviews item and tap it.
 
 
4. From the Reviews screen, tap the New Document icon.
 
5. Tap the Report a Problem button.
 
 You may or may not have to type your iTunes store password at this point.
 
6. Tap one of the three buttons to identify the type of problem you’re 
reporting: This application has a bug; This application is offensive; 
or My concern is not listed here.
 
7. Type your report in the Comments field.
 
8. Tap the Report button in the upper-right corner of the screen to 
submit the report. 
And there you have it — you now know everything you need to know to find, 
install, delete, review, and report problems with iPhone applications!
As Steve Jobs is so fond of saying in his keynotes, there is one last thing. . . . 
In a few pages (Chapter 16 to be precise), we tell you about ten of our favor-

I
n our experience, iPhones are usually reliable devices. And most users 
we’ve talked to have reported trouble-free operation. Notice our use of the 
word most. That’s because every so often, a good iPhone goes bad. It’s not 
a common occurrence, but it does happen. So in this chapter we look at the 
types of bad things that can happen, along with suggestions for fixing them.
What kind of bad things are we talking about here? Well, things 
such as
 
✓ Problems with the phone itself
 
✓ Problems making or receiving calls
 
✓ Problems with wireless networks
 
✓ Problems with synchronization, computers (both 
Mac and PC), or iTunes
After all the troubleshooting, we tell you how to get even 
more help if nothing we’ve suggested does the trick. And 
finally, if your iPhone is so badly hosed that it needs to go 
back to the mothership for repairs, we offer ways to survive 
the experience with a minimum of stress or fuss.

Part V: The Undiscovered iPhone 
iPhone Issues
Our first category of troubleshooting techniques applies to an iPhone that 
is frozen or otherwise acting up. The recommended procedure when this 
happens is to perform the six Rs in sequence. What are the six Rs? Glad you 
asked. They are
 
✓ Recharge
 
✓ Restart
 
✓ Reset your iPhone
 
✓ Remove your content
 
✓ Reset settings and content
 
✓ Restore
So if your iPhone acts up on you — if it freezes, won’t wake up from sleep, 
won’t do something it used to do, or in any other way acts improperly — 
don’t panic; this section describes the things you should try, in the order we 
(and Apple) recommend you try them.
If the first technique doesn’t do the trick, go on to the second. If the second 
one doesn’t work, try the third. And so on.
Recharge
If your iPhone acts up in any way, shape, or form, the first thing you should 
try is to give its battery a full recharge.
 
Don’t plug the iPhone’s dock connector–to–USB cable into a USB port on your 
keyboard, monitor, or USB hub. You need to plug it into one of the USB ports 
on your computer itself. That’s because USB ports on your computer supply 
more power than the other ports.
 
You can use the included USB power adapter to recharge your iPhone from 
an AC outlet rather than from a computer.
Restart
If you recharge your iPhone and it still misbehaves, the next thing to try is 
restarting it. Just as restarting a computer often fixes problems, restarting 
your iPhone sometimes works wonders.

187
 Chapter 15: When Good iPhones Go Bad
Here’s how to restart:
 
1. Press and hold the Sleep/Wake button.
 
2. Slide the red slider to turn the iPhone off, and then wait a few seconds.
 
3. Press and hold the Sleep/Wake button again until the Apple logo 
appears on the screen.
 
4. If your iPod is still frozen, misbehaves, or doesn’t start, press and hold 
the Home button for 6 to 10 seconds to force any frozen applications 
to quit, and then perform Steps 1 to 3 again.
If this doesn’t get your iPhone back up and running, move on to the third R, 
resetting your iPhone.
Reset your iPhone
To reset your iPhone, merely press and hold the Sleep/Wake button and then 
press and hold the Home button on the front. When you see the Apple logo, 
release both buttons.
Resetting your iPhone is like forcing your computer to restart after a crash. 
Your data shouldn’t be affected by a reset — and in many cases it will cure 
whatever was ailing your iPhone. So don’t be shy about giving this technique 
a try. In many cases, your iPhone will be back to normal after you’ve reset it 
this way.
 
Remember to press and hold the Sleep/Wake button before you begin to press 
and hold the Home button. If you press both at the same time, you’ll create a 
screen shot — a picture of whatever is on your screen at the time — instead 
of resetting your iPhone. (Such screen pictures, by the way, are stored in 
the Photos app’s Camera Roll. Find out more about this feature at the end of 
Chapter 18.)
Unfortunately, sometimes resetting doesn’t do the trick. When that’s the case, 
you have to take stronger measures.
Remove content
Up to now, nothing you’ve done should have taken more than a minute or 
two. We hate to tell you, but that’s about to change. Because the next thing 
you should try is removing some or all of your data to see whether perhaps 
it’s the cause of your troubles.

188
Part V: The Undiscovered iPhone 
To do so, you’ll need to sync your iPhone and reconfigure it so that some 
or all of your files are not synchronized (which will remove them from the 
phone). The problem could be contacts, calendar data, songs, photos, 
videos, or podcasts. If you suspect a particular data type — for example, you 
suspect your photos because whenever you tap the Photos icon on the Home 
screen your iPhone freezes — try removing that data first.
Or, if you have no suspicions, uncheck every item and then sync. When 
you’re finished, your iPhone should have no data on it.
If that fixed it, try restoring your data, one type at a time. If the problem 
returns, you have to keep experimenting to determine which particular data 
type or file is causing the problem.
If you’re still having problems, the next step is to reset your iPhone’s settings.
Reset settings and content
This is actually two steps: The first one, resetting your iPhone settings, resets 
every iPhone setting to its default — the way it was when you took it out of the 
box. Resetting the iPhone’s settings doesn’t erase any of your data or media. The 
only downside is that you may have to go back and change some settings after-
wards. So this is a step you can try without trepidation. To do it, tap the Settings 
icon on your Home screen, and then tap General, Reset, and Reset All Settings.
 
Be careful not to tap Erase All Content and Settings, at least not yet. Erasing 
all content takes more time to recover from (because your next sync takes a 
long time), so you should try Reset All Settings first.
Now, if resetting all settings didn’t cure your iPhone, you have to try Erase All 
Content and Settings. You’ll find it in the same place as Reset All Settings (tap 
Settings, General, Reset).
 
This will delete everything from your iPhone — all of your data, media, and 
settings. Because all these things are stored on your computer — at least in 
theory — you should be able to put things back the way they were with your 
next sync. But you will lose any photos you’ve taken, as well as contacts, cal-
endar events, and On-the-Go playlists you’ve created or modified since your 
last sync.
After using Erase All Content and Settings, check to see whether your iPhone 
works properly. If it doesn’t cure what ails your iPhone, the final R is restor-
ing your iPhone using iTunes.
Restore
Before you give up the ghost on your poor, sick iPhone, you can try one more 
thing. Connect your iPhone to your computer as though you were about to 

189
 Chapter 15: When Good iPhones Go Bad
sync. But when the iPhone appears in the iTunes source list, click the Restore 
button on the Summary tab. This will erase all of your data and media, and 
reset all your settings as well.
 
Because all of your data and media still exist on your computer (except for 
photos you’ve taken, contacts, calendar events, and On-the-Go playlists you’ve 
created or modified since your last sync, as noted previously), you shouldn’t 
lose anything by restoring. Your next sync will take longer than usual, and you 
may have to reset settings you’ve changed since you got your iPhone. But other 
than those inconveniences, restoring shouldn’t cause you any additional trouble.
Okay. So that’s the gamut of things you can do when your iPhone acts up. If 
you tried all this and none of it worked, skim through the rest of the chapter 
to see whether anything else we recommend looks like it might help. If not, 
your iPhone probably needs to go into the shop for repairs.
 
Never fear, gentle reader. Be sure and read the last section in this chapter, “If 
Nothing We Suggested So Far Helped.” Your iPhone may be very sick, but we’ll 
help ease the pain by sharing some tips on how to minimize the discomfort.
Problems with Calling or Networks
If you’re having problems making or receiving calls, problems sending or 
receiving SMS text messages, or problems with Wi-Fi or your wireless car-
rier’s data network, this section may help. The techniques here are short and 
sweet — except for the last one, restore. Restore, which we describe in the 
previous section, is still inconvenient and time consuming, and it still entails 
erasing all your data and media and then restoring it.
But first, here are some simple steps that may help. Once again, we suggest 
you try them in this order (and so does Apple).
 
1. Check the cell signal icon in the top-left corner of the screen.
 
 If you don’t have at least one or two bars, you may not be able to use the 
phone or SMS text-message function.
 
2. Make sure you haven’t left your iPhone in Airplane Mode, as 
described in Chapter 13.
 
 In Airplane Mode, all network-dependent features are disabled, so you 
can’t make or receive phone calls, send or receive SMS text messages, or 
use any of the applications that require a Wi-Fi or data network connec-
tion (that is, Mail, Safari, Stocks, Maps, and Weather).
 
3. Try moving around.
 
 Changing your location by as little as a few feet can sometimes mean the 
difference between four bars and zero bars, or being able to use a Wi-Fi 
or wireless data network or not. If you’re inside, try going outside. If 

190
Part V: The Undiscovered iPhone 
you’re outside, try moving ten or twenty paces in any direction. Keep an 
eye on the cell signal or Wi-Fi icon as you move around, and stop when 
you see more bars than you saw before.
 
4. Turn on Airplane Mode by tapping Settings on the Home screen and 
then tapping the Airplane Mode On/Off switch to turn it on. Wait 15 or 
20 seconds and then turn it off again.
 
 Toggling Airplane Mode on and off like this resets both the Wi-Fi and 
wireless data-network connections. So if your network connection was 
the problem, toggling Airplane Mode on and off may very well correct it.
 
5. Restart your iPhone.
 
 If you’ve forgotten how, refer to the “Restart” section a few pages back. 
As we mentioned, restarting your iPhone is often all it takes to fix what-
ever was wrong.
 
6. Make sure your SIM card is firmly seated.
 
 
A SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) card is a removable smart card used 
to identify mobile phones. It allows users to change phones by moving the 
SIM card from one phone to another.
 
 To remove the 
SIM card, use the 
included SIM-eject 
tool (if you have 
an iPhone 3G), or 
find a very fine-
gauge paper clip, 
straighten one end, 
and then stick the 
straight end gently 
into the hole on the 
SIM tray, as shown 
in Figure 15-1.
 
 When the SIM tray 
slides out, care-
fully lift out the 
SIM card and then 
reinsert it, making 
sure it’s firmly 
situated in the tray 
before you gently 
push the tray back 
in until it locks.
Figure 15-1: Removing the SIM tray.

191
 Chapter 15: When Good iPhones Go Bad
If none of the preceding fixed your network issues, try restoring your iPhone 
as described previously in the “Restore” section.
 
Performing a restore deletes everything on your iPhone — all of your data, 
media, and settings. You should be able to put things back the way they were 
with your next sync. If that doesn’t happen, for whatever reason, you can’t 
say we didn’t warn you.
Sync, Computer, or iTunes Issues
Our last category of troubleshooting techniques applies to issues that involve 
synchronization and computer/iPhone relations. If you’re having problems 
syncing or your computer doesn’t recognize your iPhone when you connect 
it, here are some things to try.
Once again, we suggest that you try these procedures in the order they’re 
presented here.
 
1. Recharge your iPhone.
 
 If you didn’t try it previously, try it now. Go back to the “iPhone Issues” 
section at the beginning of the chapter and read what we said about 
recharging your iPhone. Every word there also applies here.
 
2. Try a different USB port or a different cable if you have one available.
 
 It doesn’t happen often, but occasionally USB ports and cables go bad. 
When they do, they invariably cause sync and connection problems. So 
it’s always a good idea to make sure that a bad USB port or cable isn’t to 
blame.
 
 If you don’t remember what we’ve said about using USB ports on your 
computer rather than the ones on your keyboard, monitor, or hub, we 
suggest you reread the “Recharge” section, earlier in the chapter.
 
3. Restart your iPhone and try to sync again.
 
 We describe restarting in full and loving detail in the “Restart” section, 
earlier in the chapter.
 
4. Reinstall iTunes.
 
 Even if you have an iTunes installer handy, it’s probably a good idea 
to visit the Apple Web site and download the latest and greatest ver-
sion, just in case. You’ll always find the latest version of iTunes at www.
apple.com/itunes/download/.

More Help on the Apple Web Site
If you’ve tried everything suggested so far and are still having problems, 
don’t give up just yet. Here are a few more places you may find help. We 
recommend that you check out some or all of them before you throw in the 
towel and smash your iPhone into tiny little pieces (or ship it back to Apple 
for repairs, as described in the next section).
First, Apple offers an excellent set of support resources on its Web site at 
www.apple.com/support/iphone. You can browse support issues by cat-
egory, search for a problem by keyword, or use the iPhone Troubleshooting 
Assistant to resolve common problems, as shown in Figure 15-2.
 
Troubleshooting Assistant link
 
Figure 15-2: Apple’s iPhone support pages offer several kinds 
 
of helpful information.
 
We wouldn’t advise putting a lot of hope in the Troubleshooting Assistant. 
If you’ve tried everything we’ve suggested in this chapter, then you’ve prob-
ably tried everything the Troubleshooting Assistant will suggest. However, 
since it’s easier to update a Web site than it is to update a book, the 
Troubleshooting Assistant could offer techniques we didn’t know when we 
wrote this. So, although it may just repeat things you already know, it could 
also have something new. Give it a try.

193
 Chapter 15: When Good iPhones Go Bad
While you’re visiting the Apple support pages, another section could be 
helpful: the discussion forums. You’ll find them at http://discussions.
apple.com, and they’re chock-full of questions and answers from other 
iPhone users. It’s been our experience that if you can’t find an answer to a 
support question elsewhere, you can often find something helpful in these 
forums. You can browse by category (Integrating iPhone into your Digital 
Life, for example, in Figure 15-3) or search by keyword.
Either way, you’ll find thousands of discussions about almost every aspect 
of using your iPhone. Better still, frequently you can find the answer to your 
question or a helpful suggestion.

Part V: The Undiscovered iPhone 
Now for the best part: If you can’t find a solution by browsing or searching, 
you can post your question in the appropriate Apple discussion forum. Check 
back in a few days (or even in a few hours) and some helpful iPhone user may 
very well have replied with the answer. If you’ve never tried this fabulous 
tool, you’re missing out on one of the greatest support resources available 
anywhere.
Last, but certainly not least, before you give up the ghost you might want to 
try a carefully worded Google search. It couldn’t hurt and you might just find 
the solution you’ve spent hours searching for.
If Nothing We Suggested So Far Helped
If you’ve tried every trick in the book (this one) and still have a malfunction-
ing iPhone, it’s time to consider shipping it off to the iPhone hospital (better 
known as Apple, Inc.). The repair will be free if your iPhone is still under its 
one-year limited warranty.
 
You can extend your warranty to up to two years from the original purchase 
date if you want. To do so, you need to buy the AppleCare Protection Plan for 
your iPhone. You don’t have to do it when you buy the phone, but you must 
buy it before your one-year limited warranty expires. The cost is $69.
Here are a few things you should know before you take your phone in to be 
repaired:
 
✓ Your iPhone will be erased during its repair, so you should sync your 
iPhone with iTunes before you take it in, if you can. If you can’t, and 
you’ve entered data on the phone since your last sync, such as a con-
tact or an appointment, the data won’t be there when you restore your 
iPhone upon its return.
 
✓ Remove any third-party accessories such as a case or screen protector.
 
✓ Remove the SIM card from your iPhone (as described in the “Problems 
with Calling or Networks” section) and keep it in a safe place.
 
 Do not, under any circumstances, forget this step. Apple will not guarantee 
that your SIM card will be returned to you after a repair. If you do forget 
this step, Apple suggests that you contact your local AT&T store and 
obtain a new SIM card with the proper account information. Ouch.

195
 Chapter 15: When Good iPhones Go Bad
Although you may be able to get your iPhone serviced by AT&T or by 
mail, we recommend that you take it to your nearest Apple Store for two 
reasons:
 
✓ No one knows your iPhone like Apple. One of the geniuses at the Apple 
Store may be able to fix whatever is wrong without sending your iPhone 
away for repairs.
 
✓ Only the Apple Store offers an Advance Replacement plan for iPhones 
needing repairs. The AppleCare Advance Replacement Service costs 
$29 plus tax when your iPhone is under warranty or covered by the 
AppleCare Protection Plan. This service provides you with a new iPhone 
before you have to send in your old one for service.
 
If your iPhone isn’t under warranty or AppleCare, you can still take advan-
tage of the Advance Replacement Service but it’ll cost you a lot more — $228 
(8GB) or $328 (16GB) plus tax as of this writing.
If you choose the AppleCare Advance Replacement Service, you won’t have 
to activate the new phone, and it will have the same phone number as the 
phone it replaces. All you need to do is pop your old SIM card into the new 
phone, sync it with iTunes to fill it with the data and media files that were on 
your sick iPhone, and you’re good to go.

The Part of Tens

I
t’s written in stone somewhere at Wiley world 
headquarters that we For Dummies authors 
must include a Part of Tens in every single For 
Dummies book we write. It is a duty we take quite 
seriously. So in this part, you’ll ﬁ nd a list of ten of 
our favorite applications plucked from the iPhone 
App Store. These include programs to turn your 
iPhone into a capable Internet radio, a couple of 
really addictive games, and even an app to help 
you ﬁ nd a place to eat. We then move on to our 
diverse collection of ten fabulous Web resources 
every iPhone user should know about. We tell you 
about online destinations to practice typing on 
iPhone’s multitouch display, calculate tips, and 
compile a shopping list. Even your very fortune 
awaits you in these next few pages.
We close the show with one of our favorite topics: 
hints, tips, and shortcuts that make life with your 
iPhone even better. Among the ten, you discover 
how to look at the capacity of your newly-favored 
device in different ways, ﬁ nd out how to share 
Web pages, and pick up another trick or two on 
using iPhone’s virtual keyboard.

K
iller app is familiar jargon to anyone who has spent any 
time around computers. It refers to an application so 
sweet or so useful that just about everybody wants or must 
have it.
You could make the argument that the most compel-
ling killer app on the iPhone is the very App Store we 
expound on in Chapter 14. This online emporium has an 
abundance of splendid programs — dare we say killer 
apps in their own right? — many of which are free. These 
cover everything from social networking tools to entertain-
ment. Okay, so there are some rotten apples in the bunch 
too. But we’re here to accentuate the positive.
With that in mind, we offer an arbitrary list of 10 favorite apps. But 
we encourage you to keep poking around for your own killer 
programs.

Pandora
We’ve long been fans of Pandora on the computer. So we’re practically deliri-
ous that this custom Internet radio service is available gratis on the iPhone.
It works on the phone in much the same way it does on a PC or Mac. You 
type in the name of a favorite musician or song title and Pandora creates an 
instant personalized radio station with selections that exemplify the style you 
chose. Figure 16-1 shows some of the eclectic stations we created. Tapping 
Quick Mix plays musical selections across all your stations. Tapping the + 
brings up the iPhone keyboard so that you can add a new station.
 
 
Figure 16-1: Eclectic online radio stations from Pandora.
Say you type Beatles. Pandora’s instant Beatles station will include perfor-
mances from John, Paul, George, and Ringo, as well as tunes from other acts.
And say you type in a song title, such as Have I Told You Lately. Pandora will 
construct a station with similar music after you tell it whether to base tunes 
on the Van Morrison, Rod Stewart, or other rendition.
Pandora comes out of the Music Genome Project, an organization of musicians 
and technologists who analyze music according to hundreds of attributes 
(melody, harmony, vocal performances, and so on).
You can help fine-tune the music Pandora plays by tapping the thumbs-up or 
thumbs-down icon below the album cover of the song being played, as shown 
in Figure 16-2.
If you tap the triangular-icon you can bookmark the song or artist being played — 
or head to iTunes to purchase it directly on the phone (if available).

201
 Chapter 16: Ten Appetizing Apps
 
 
Figure 16-2: Have we told you lately how much we like Pandora?
AOL Radio
Whereas Pandora is all about creating your own fresh radio stations on the 
fly, AOL Radio is about playing regular stations that already exist. These 
include AOL’s own Internet radio stations, broken out by genre, and more 
than 150 terrestrial radio stations owned by CBS Radio.
If you tap the Locals icon, the iPhone looks for stations in the very area in which 
you are listening, using GPS, cellular or Wi-Fi to determine your whereabouts. 
But you can also pick stations in some other locale, letting a New Yorker, say, 
listen to a station in St. Louis, or more than two dozen other locations.
When you stumble upon a station you really like, tap the star in the upper-
right corner of the screen to add it to your list of favorites. Then just tap 
Favorites to find the station later. Or tap Recents to return to stations you 
recently took in.
Of course, you need Internet access to be able to hear these stations.
Tap to return to station list
Tap for explanation of why song is playing
Tap when you don’t like song being played
Tap to bookmark a song 
or artist or to buy from iTunes
Tap when you like song being played
Tap to skip to next track
Tap to pause song

202
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Midomi Mobile
Hum a few bars and fake it. That’s precisely what you’ll find yourself doing 
with the appealing Midomi Mobile app from Melodis Corp. You hum a melody 
into the iPhone. Midomi attempts to name that tune.
More often than not, in our tests, it did — Midomi correctly identified 
“Hotel California,” “Yesterday,” “Smile,” and “People,” among other songs in 
our humming repertoire. And while Midomi didn’t properly ID every song, 
every time — it couldn’t possibly be because we were, gulp, humming out 
of tune — the program still earned our respect.
 
You can bolster Midomi’s accuracy by humming 10 seconds or longer.
There are other ways to identify a song via Midomi. You can say the name of 
a song or artist, type in a search, or hold your iPhone up to the radio when a 
song is playing (see Shazam, later in this chapter).
Just tap the appropriate Sing, Say, Grab, or Type icon at the bottom of the 
screen to search a song or artist by your method of choice. When you make a 
match, you can jump to YouTube videos or purchase the track in iTunes.
For us, though, the most fun was hearing other people hum the very songs we did. 
We’ll pass no judgment on their musical talents (and hope they return the favor).
Urbanspoon
You’re looking for a place to eat in an unfamiliar city. Or 
maybe you’re just bored with the same old haunts in 
your own neck of the woods. Either way, Urbanspoon 
can help you find a place to dine serendipitously.
As Figure 16-3 shows, Urbanspoon’s screen looks 
something like a Las Vegas slot machine with three 
spinning wheels. The first wheel represents the neigh-
borhood you might eat in. The second designates a 
food type (Ethiopian, Indian, Tacos, you name it). And 
the third gives you a rough idea of how much eating 
in some joint is going to cost you, using a scale of one 
to four $ signs.
When you literally shake the iPhone (or, alternatively, 
tap the Shake button), the wheels spin until they land on 
a random restaurant. Tap the little circle with the right-
pointing arrow for the address and phone number of the chosen restaurant. You 
can tap on the number to call it. Or tap More Info to check out any reviews.
Figure 16-3: Hungering for 
a new place to eat?

203
 Chapter 16: Ten Appetizing Apps
If the choice exceeds your budget or doesn’t meet your dietary standards — 
what do you mean you don’t want donuts for dinner? — merely shake the iPhone 
and try again. You can press one or more of the little lock icons under each spin-
ning wheel to filter your restaurant search by a given criteria.
With your permission, Urbanspoon uses the iPhone’s GPS or other location-
finding smarts to find a nearby restaurant. Or you can direct a search manu-
ally from a list of more than 60 cities. Best of all, Urbanspoon is free.
Crash Bandicoot Nitro Kart 3D
We admit it — we’re suckers for racing games. Vivendi Games Mobile’s Crash 
Bandicoot is pretty darn addictive, although you will have to fork over ten 
bucks. The challenge is to steer your race car through a dozen colorful tracks 
by tilting the phone to activate the iPhone’s accelerometer motion sensor.
 
If you have trouble, tap Options from the main Crash Bandicoot menu and 
tap Accelerometer to adjust the sensitivity.
If you’re a video-game newbie or find yourself in desperate need of an iPhone 
Driver’s Ed course, we recommend tapping Tutorial under the Start Game 
menu. It offers helpful hints as you race, as shown in Figure 16-4.
 
 
Figure 16-4: Hoping to avoid crashing in Crash.
The game is rated 4+, meaning parents can safely let their kids have at it.

204
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Shazam
Ever heard a song on the radio or television and wondered what it was called 
or who was singing it? With Shazam you may never have to wonder again. 
Just launch Shazam and hold your iPhone near the source of the music and in 
a few seconds the song title and artist’s name will magically appear on your 
iPhone screen, as shown in Figure 16-5.
 
 
Figure 16-5: Point your phone at the music (left) and 
 
Shazam tells you the artist, title, and more (right).
In Shazam parlance, that song has now been tagged. Now if tagging were all 
Shazam could do, that would surely be enough. But wait, there’s more . . . 
after Shazam tags a song you can
 
✓ Buy the song at the iTunes store
 
✓ Watch related videos on YouTube
 
✓ Take a picture and attach it to a tag
 
✓ E-mail a tag to a friend
It isn’t great at identifying classical music or opera, nor is it adept at identifying 
obscure indie bands (or, as with Midomi, picking up on humming). But if you 
use it primarily to identify popular music, Shazam is amazing. It even worked in 
a noisy airport terminal. And you can’t beat the price: Shazam is free.
Remote
Leave it to Apple to come up with one of the coolest iPhone apps money 
can’t buy (because it’s free). It’s called Remote, and it lets you control music 
playing in iTunes on your computer, Apple TV, or AirPort Express.

205
 Chapter 16: Ten Appetizing Apps
With Remote, you can use your iPhone to do almost everything you can do 
in iTunes: Play, pause, skip, shuffle, search, or browse your iTunes library. 
Better yet, you can do it from anywhere in your house that has Wi-Fi.
 
Because the interface is almost exactly the same as the iPod application on 
your iPhone, you already know how to use it. (If you need help with the iPod 
function on your iPhone, see Chapter 7.)
Remote is free, but it does require a couple of basics: a computer running 
Apple’s iTunes software and a Wi-Fi network.
MotionX Poker Dice
MotionX Poker is a five-card poker game played by rolling five dice. Each 
hand pits you against the dealer and gives you three chances (rolls) to make 
the best hand, as shown on the left in Figure 16-6.
You roll the dice by shaking your iPhone, which is a cool use of your iPhone’s 
accelerometer. Combine that with the superb sound effects and judicious use 
of your iPhone’s ability to vibrate, and the experience is quite realistic.
Increasing your chip count unlocks beautiful new dice sets (as shown on the 
right in Figure 16-6), new tables, commemorative gems, and more.
 
 
Figure 16-6: (Left) My last roll and three aces so far. . . .  
 
(Right) The more you win, the more dice you get to choose from.
The only bummer is that the version of the game available when we wrote 
this froze up occasionally. If that happens, you can tap the Home button to 
exit the game and then tap the MotionX Poker icon to restart it — and things 

206
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
pick up where you left off. While this bug has never affected our iPhones’ 
functionality, it is annoying, especially in a game that’s otherwise enjoyable 
and polished. With any luck, the developer will have squashed the bug before 
you read this.
Even so, the game is very pretty, lots of fun, and way more addicting than you 
might expect such a simple game to be. In spite of the occasional hiccups, we 
can’t seem to stop playing. MotionX Poker Dice is $4.99 (and worth it).
Tap Tap Revenge
Are you a fan of the Guitar Hero or Rock Band console 
games? If so, you’ll love the free Tap Tap Revenge 
game. The object is to tap musical “beats,” which 
appear as colored dots hurling toward you. Tap them 
as they pass over the white line near the bottom of 
the screen to score points. When an arrow appears, 
tilt the iPhone in that direction to score. Figure 16-7 
shows a game in progress.
Tap Tap Revenge is a lot like those more expensive 
games, but you can play it anytime and anywhere. 
Alas, you have only a very limited number of songs 
available. And unlike the repertoire in Guitar Hero or 
Rock Band, we guarantee you’ve never heard of any 
of the songs or artists.
Even so, it’s free and it’s a lot of fun. We think you’ll 
find yourself playing again and again as you try to 
beat your high score. Now, if you’ll excuse us, we’ve got beats to tap.
Box Office
We like movies, so we use the Box Office app a lot. Feed it your zip code and 
then browse local theatres by movie, show time, rating, or distance from 
your current location. Another nice feature is the capability to buy tickets to 
most movies from your iPhone with just a few additional taps.
There are other free movie apps out there, but we like Box Office best for its 
clean interface and ratings from RottonTomatoes.com. Oh, and Box Office is 
free. What a concept.
Figure 16-7: The game 
thinks I’m doing great, so 
it must be true.

A
ll through this book you’ve heard us rave about how great 
the iPhone Internet experience is. But you can’t have a 
great experience without some great Web sites to visit. And 
so here are ten Web sites that will make your iPhone even 
more useful or fun.
If you type faster on your computer than on your iPhone, 
bookmark these sites on your computer and then sync 
those bookmarks with your iPhone. And if you have more 
than a few iPhone-specific bookmarks, create an iPhone 
bookmark folder on your computer and put all of them into 
it. Then the next time you sync, that bookmark folder will 
appear on your iPhone, making it easy to use all of your favor-
ite iPhone sites.
Wi-Fi Hotspot Finder Extraordinaire
Sure, you can use the Maps application to find a Wi-Fi hotspot in a pinch. Just 
tap Maps, then type hotspot and the zip code you want to search. Assuming 

208
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
that zip code has some Wi-Fi hotspots, a map full of 
pushpins appears. But Maps doesn’t discern between 
free hotspots and the ones you have to pay for. And 
Maps doesn’t offer a review of the hotspot’s signal 
quality. Although Maps is plenty easy to use, we know 
an ever better, easier way. It’s called JiWire Wi-Fi 
Finder, and it has a clean interface that makes it easy 
to search for hotspots in more than 150,000 loca-
tions in 135 countries. It also allows you to limit your 
search to free hotspots, as shown in Figure 17-1.
After you download the application and tap the Go 
button, a list of hotspot locations appears. Tap the 
name of a found hotspot, and you see another screen 
with its name, address, phone number, and three but-
tons: Call, Map, and Info. The Call and Map buttons do 
what you’d expect: dial the phone number and display 
the location in the Maps application, respectively. But 
the Info button is the best; it tells you more about the business and the qual-
ity of its wireless network.
JiWire Wi-Fi Finder is easy to use, it’s elegant, it does stuff Maps doesn’t, 
and best of all, it’s free. How can you not love that? Go to http://iphone.
jiwire.com.
iPhone News, Tips, and More
We’ve long had enormous respect for our tech brethren at CNet Networks. 
And the folks over there have created a comprehensive Web resource called 
iPhone Atlas, with news, troubleshooting tips, and discussion groups sur-
rounding your prized possession. User forums tackle a gaggle of iPhone-
related issues: the legality of unlocking an iPhone, how to send pictures via 
SMS, how to handle voicemail setup problems, to name just a few.
iPhone Atlas is simply laid out, even if it’s hardly the prettiest site we’ve ever 
seen. And while we’re quibbling, we’d have preferred to be able to access the 
full HTML iPhone Atlas site on our phones’ Safari browsers, rather than the 
lighter mobile-oriented version of the site.
Still, iPhone Atlas is chock-full of the kind of information that iPhone junkies 
can’t seem to get enough of. Start at http://www.iphoneatlas.com.
Figure 17-1: JiWire Wi-Fi 
Finder is a better way to 
find Wi-Fi hotspots.

Fast, Easy Shopping with OneTrip Shopping List
No matter how good of an iPhone typist you are, we have a faster, easier way 
to make shopping lists. It’s called OneTrip Shopping List. Rather than typing 
items for a list, you tap them. Here’s how it works:
 
1. Tap a category (see Figure 17-2 left).
 
2. Tap an item or items in the category (see Figure 17-2 middle).
 
3. At the store, tap each item as you toss it into your shopping cart and a 
check mark magically appears next to its name (see Figure 17-2 right).
 
 
 Figure 17-2: First tap a category (left), then tap an item or items in that category (middle) 
to create a OneTrip Shopping List (right).
You can edit a list any time you like, and you can type any item not included 
in one of the categories. With another tap, you can e-mail the list to yourself 
or anyone you want. OneTrip Shopping List has one last great feature — it’s 
free. Go to http://onetrip.org/onetrip/.

210
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Calculating Tips Has Never Been Easier
Sure you can use the iPhone’s calculator to figure 
out how much of a tip to leave, but using Danny 
Goodman’s Tip Calculator, at http://dannyg.com/
iphone/tipCalc, is a whole lot easier. Just tap the 
Food & Bevs or Tax field and a numeric keypad pops 
up on the screen.
Specify the number of diners and the amounts for 
food and tax, and the Tip Calculator does the rest by 
calculating the gratuity, total, and total amount per 
diner, as shown in Figure 17-3.
If you tap the little i to the left of Gratuity, you can 
even choose how the tip is calculated — as a percent 
of the food and beverage total or as a multiple of the 
sales tax.
Tip Calculator, like the other items in this chapter, 
is 100% free of charge, leaving you extra cash to be a 
 generous tipper.
Match Three Gems
Bejeweled, at www.popcap.com, is a free Web version of PopCap’s bestsell-
ing “match three gems” game. If you’ve ever played Bejeweled on the Mac or 
PC, or JewelToy on the Mac, you know exactly how Bejeweled works on the 
iPhone.
For those unfamiliar with these enjoyable and addictive games, the goal is to 
arrange three or more matching gems in a line either horizontally or verti-
cally. To move the gems, you tap one, and then tap any adjacent gem to swap 
their places, as shown on the left in Figure 17-4.
A swap occurs only if doing so will form a line of three or more matching 
gems. In Figure 17-4, swapping the purple triangle and the yellow diamond 
creates a vertical line of three purple triangle gems. The three purple gems 
disappear, as shown in the figure, and you score 10 points!
New gems fall from the top of the board to fill in any gaps. If you create gaps 
lower in the board, gems slide downward to fill them, and new gems fall from 
the top. The more lines of three or more gems you make, the higher your 
score. The game ends when no more lines of three or more matching gems 
can be created.
Figure 17-3: Specify the 
number of diners and the 
amount of food, drink, and 
tax; the Tip Calculator 
does the rest.

 Figure 17-4: (Left) You’ve created a row of three purple triangles. 
 (Right) The three purple triangles disappear, and you score 10 points!
It’s simple, mindless fun, but more addictive than you might think. Games 
only take a few minutes and you can’t beat the price (free).
By the way, if you find you enjoy this game, you’ll probably like Bejeweled 2 
even better. It has exclusive features like Power Gems and Hyper Cubes and 
is available in the iTunes App Store for $9.99.
Practice Typing
By now, you’ve probably done a fair share of typing using the iPhone’s multi-
touch keyboard. Some of you may still be struggling with it. For others, let’s 
just say you’re getting a tad cocky. “Look at me. I’m hot stuff. This keyboard 
thing is really a piece of cake.”
Think so? Why not put your skills to the test? That’s what the iPhone Typing 
Test site (http://www.iphonetypingtest.com/) is all about. You can try 
your hand, um, fingers at two types of tests.
In the first test, your goal is to type a sentence as quickly and accurately as 
possible. The sentence appears in a yellow box at the top of the screen. The 
test begins when you tap inside the blue field just below the yellow field. At 

212
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
that moment, the sentence you are trying 
to match and the virtual keyboard appear 
simultaneously.
When you are finished typing, tap Done to see 
how you fared, as shown in Figure 17-5. Are 
you still feeling cocky?
The second exam is a freestyle test in which 
you get to type anything you want for as long 
as you want. When you tap Done, your words-
per-minute are calculated. Before leaving the 
site, check out the typing tips section.
An Instant Messaging Workaround
We were surprised that instant messaging was among the features Apple 
left out when the iPhone was launched. Apple has long included a fine IM 
program called iChat on Macs. And IM is a popular feature on some rival cell 
phones.
Apple may well add a version of iChat on the iPhone, possibly even by the 
time you read this. But if they haven’t gotten around to it yet, check out 
JiveTalk from BeeJive (http://iphone.beejive.com/).
The site was still in a beta testing stage as this book was being prepared, 
but you could already head there and log onto your existing AOL Instant 
Messenger (AIM), Google Talk, ICQ, Jabber, MSN Messenger, or Yahoo 
Messenger account.
It’s easy to set up these accounts so that they’ll work through JiveTalk. Tap 
the + button at the JiveTalk Home screen, and then tap the downward arrow 
next to the Network field to choose an IM network from the list that appears 
at the bottom of the screen. Tap Done and enter your username and pass-
word. If you so choose, tap the Save Account check box so you don’t have to 
enter this information every time you want to engage in an IM session.
You can log into all your IM accounts at the same time. Your compadres 
across all your accounts appear in one integrated buddy list; a little icon next 
to a name indicates which IM account each person is associated with. A vir-
tual keyboard slides up from the bottom the moment you tap the text box to 
type a message to a buddy. The actual IM dialog appears in text bubbles.
Figure 17-5: You get to see how 
fast — and accurate — you are.

213
 Chapter 17: Ten Terrific Web Resources
Through the JiveTalk’s settings, you can choose whether or not to display 
offline buddies, show status messages, and display emoticons (smiley faces 
and the like).
 
There is an official AOL/AIM chat application available in the iTunes App 
Store, but we have found JiveTalk more responsive, more stable, and just 
plain better behaved.
One last thing: The BeeJive folks are working on a BeeJive iPhone application 
you can use instead of this Web application. By the time you read this, it may 
be available at the iTunes App Store (price unknown at press time).
Wassup with Widgets?
Some people refer to useful Web sites or applications for your iPhone as wid-
gets. If you’re looking for a widget — from a handy little periodic table of the 
elements to a cheap gas finder, or whatever — one of the most comprehen-
sive widget lists we’ve found is the iPhone Widget List, at http://iphone
widgetlist.com/.
Listed apps carry user ratings and status updates. You also can tap a See It 
Now button to get a closer peek at the widget.
iPhone Network Speed Tester
Ever wonder if your Internet connection — Wi-Fi or EDGE — is faster or 
slower than average? If so, you’re going to enjoy using the iPhone Network 
Test at http://www.iphonenetworktest.com/. Just tap the Start Test 
link on the front page, and after a few seconds your network speed appears, 
as shown on the left in Figure 17-6.
 
Kbps (kilobits per second) is a common measure of your data transfer rate. A 
kilobit is 1,000 bits, so one kilobit per second equals 1,000 bits per second.
If you tap the link for EDGE, 3G, or Wi-Fi (which you can’t see on the left in 
Figure 17-6) beneath the words “How are you connected to the Internet?” 
your EDGE, 3G, or Wi-Fi speed is recorded for posterity. Then, if you tap the 
Results button that appears (and also appears on the front page of the site), 
you see the average speeds for all network tests — all Wi-Fi tests and EDGE 
tests in this figure, as well as all 3G tests which you can’t see in the figure.

 Figure 17-6: The network speed for this test was 735.4 kbps (left). 
Average speed for all network tests: Wi-Fi, EDGE, and 3G (right).
What can we discern from all this? Well, our Wi-Fi speed of 735.4 kbps is 
slightly faster than the average Wi-Fi test speed over the past week. Put 
another way, our Wi-Fi connection is a little bit faster than the average Wi-Fi 
network.
Read Your Fortune
“Your great attention to detail is both a blessing and a curse.” “It takes more 
than good memory to have good memories.” “There is a true and sincere 
friendship between you and your friends.”
Profound thoughts, huh?
We picked up these pearls of wisdom at iPhone Fortune Cookie 1.0 at 
http://m.digitaljoven.com/fortune/index.html. When you first 
arrive at this amusing site, you see the fortune cookie shown at the top of 
Figure 17-7.
Then when you rotate the phone to landscape mode, the cookie breaks 
in half and your fortune is revealed, as shown in the figure on the bottom. 
Repeat this little drill to request another fortune. Alas, some of the fortunes 
are as stale as the cookies we’ve eaten in real Chinese restaurants. Samples: 
“A pleasant surprise is in store for you.” “You will live a long, happy life.”
Guess that’s just the way the cookie crumbles. (Hey, we couldn’t help ourselves.)

fter spending a lot of quality time with our iPhones, 
it’s only natural that we’ve discovered more than a 
few helpful hints, tips, and shortcuts. In this chapter, we 
share some of our faves.
Do the Slide for Accuracy and 
Punctuation
Here’s a tip that can help you type faster in two ways. First, it 
helps you type more accurately; second, it lets you type punctuation 
and numerals faster than ever before.
Over the course of this book you’ve found out how to tap, how to double-tap, 
and even how to double-tap with two fingers. Now we want to introduce you 
to a new gesture we like to call the slide.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
To do the slide, you start by performing the first half of a tap. That is, you 
touch your finger to the screen but don’t lift it up. Now, without lifting your 
finger, slide it onto the key you want to type. You’ll know you’re on the right 
key because it pop ups — enlarges.
First, try the slide during normal typing. Stab at a key and if you miss, rather 
than lifting your finger, backspacing, and trying again, do the slide onto the 
proper key. Once you get the hang of it, you’ll see that it saves a lot of time 
and improves your accuracy as well.
Now here’s the best part: You can use the slide to save time with punctuation 
and numerals, too. The next time you need to type a punctuation mark or 
number, try this technique:
 
1. Start a slide action with your finger on the 123 key (the key to the left 
of the Space key when the alphabetical keyboard is active).
 
 This is a slide, not a tap, so don’t lift your finger just yet.
 
2. When the punctuation and numeric keyboard appears on-screen, slide 
your finger onto the punctuation mark or number you want to type.
 
3. Lift your finger.
The cool thing is that the punctuation and numeric keyboard disappears and 
the alphabetical keyboard reappears — all without tapping the 123 key to 
display the punctuation and numeric keyboard and without tapping the ABC 
key (the key to the left of the Space key when the punctuation and numeric 
keyboard is active).
Practice the slide for typing letters, punctuation, and numerals, and we guar-
antee that in a few days you’ll be typing faster and more accurately.
Auto-Correct Is Your Friend
Here are two related tips about auto-correction that can also help you type 
faster and more accurately.
Auto apostrophes are good for you
First, before moving on from the subject of punctuation, you should know that 
you can type dont to get to don’t, and cant to get to can’t. We’ve told you to put 
some faith in the iPhone’s auto-correction software. And that applies to con-
tractions. In other words, save time by letting the iPhone’s intelligent keyboard 
insert the apostrophes on your behalf for these and other common words.

219
 Chapter 18: Ten Helpful Hints, Tips, and Shortcuts
 
We’re aware of at least one exception. The iPhone cannot distinguish 
between it’s, the contraction of “it is,” and its, the possessive adjective and 
possessive pronoun.
Make rejection work for you
Along those same lines, if the auto-correct suggestion isn’t the word you 
want, instead of ignoring it, reject it instead. Finish typing the word and then 
tap the x to reject the suggestion before you type another word. Doing so 
makes your iPhone more likely to accept your word the next time you type it, 
and less likely to make the same incorrect suggestion again.
Here you thought you were buying a tech book, and you get grammar and typing 
lessons thrown in at no extra charge. Just think of us as full-service authors.
Assault on batteries
Because this is a chapter of tips and hints, 
we’d be remiss if we didn’t include some ways 
that you can extend your battery life. First and 
foremost: If you use a carrying case, charging 
the iPhone while it’s in that case may generate 
more heat than is healthy. Overheating is bad 
for both battery capacity and battery life. So 
take it out of the case before you charge it.
If you’re not using power thirsty  3G or Wi-Fi net-
works, or a Bluetooth device (such as a headset 
or car kit), consider turning off the features you 
don’t need in Settings. It could mean the differ-
ence between running out of juice and being able 
to make that important call later in the day.
Activate Auto-Brightness to enable the screen 
brightness to adjust based on current lighting 
conditions. Using this setting can be easier on 
your battery. Tap Settings on the Home screen, 
tap Brightness, and then tap the On/Off switch, 
if necessary, to turn it on.
Turning off Location Services (tap Settings, tap 
General, and then tap the On/Off switch to turn 
Location Services off) and Push (tap Settings, 
tap Fetch New Data, and then tap the On/Off 
switch to turn Push off) can also help to con-
serve battery life.
Finally, turning on EQ (see Chapter 7) when you 
listen to music can make it sound better, but 
it also uses more processing power. If you’ve 
added EQ to tracks in iTunes via the Track 
Info window, and you want to retain the EQ 
from iTunes, set the EQ on your iPhone to flat. 
Because you’re not turning off EQ, your battery 
life will be slightly worse. But your songs will 
sound just the way you expect them to sound. 
Either way, to alter your EQ settings, tap Settings 
on the Home screen, tap iPod, and then tap EQ.
Apple says a properly maintained iPhone bat-
tery will retain up to 80% of its original capac-
ity after 400 full charge and discharge cycles. 
You can replace the battery at any time if it no 
longer holds sufficient charge. Your one-year 
limited warranty includes the replacement of a 
defective battery. Coverage jumps to two years 
with the AppleCare Protection Plan. Apple will 
replace the battery if it drops below 50% of its 
original capacity.
If your iPhone is out of warranty, Apple will 
replace the battery for $79 plus $6.95 shipping, 
plus local tax, and will also dispose of your old 
battery in an environmentally friendly manner.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Three Ways to View the iPhone’s Capacity
When your iPhone is selected in the source list in iTunes, you see a colorful 
chart at the bottom of the screen that tells you how your iPhone’s capacity is 
being used by your media and other data.
By default, the chart shows the amount of space your audio, video, and 
photo files use on your iPhone in megabytes (MB) or gigabytes (GB). But you 
knew that. What you probably don’t know is that when you click the colorful 
chart, it cycles through two more slightly different displays. The first click 
changes the display from the amount of space used to the number of items 
(audio, video, and photos) you have stored. Click once more, and the display 
changes to the total playing time for audio and video, as shown in Figure 18-1.
This is particularly helpful before you go on a trip. Knowing that you have 
5.6 hours of video and 1.8 days of audio is far more useful than knowing how 
many gigabytes you’re packing.
 
 
Figure 18-1: Click the colorful chart, and what’s stored on your iPhone is expressed 
 
in different ways.
So You Want to Sync Notes, Do You?
As you’ve no doubt discovered by now, there’s no easy way to synchronize 
notes between iPhone’s Notes application and your computer. There are some 
third-party apps that synchronize notes between your computer and iPhone or 
a Web page — Evernote, OmniFocus, FileMagnet, and Jott, to name a few — but 
none of them synchronizes notes between computer and phone for free.

221
 Chapter 18: Ten Helpful Hints, Tips, and Shortcuts
So, if you’d like to sync a note or notes, we know of a kludge that won’t cost 
you a penny. Forget about using the Notes application or any notes appli-
cation and use your contact manager program and the Contacts list in the 
Phone application. You see, each contact has its own notes field, and each 
notes field can contain a decent amount of text.
So the kludge is to create a fake contact or contacts and use their notes fields 
for notes you want to sync. Then, after you sync, and assuming you remem-
ber the names of your fake contacts — try AAA for the first and last names 
so the note appears as the first item in the alphabetical contact list on your 
iPhone — your notes will be on both your phone and your computer.
It may not be the most elegant solution, but it does work — and best of all, 
it’s free!
Tricks with Links and Phone Numbers
The iPhone does something special when it encounters a phone number or URL 
in e-mail and SMS text messages. The iPhone interprets as a phone number any 
sequence of numbers that looks like a phone number: 1-123-555-4567, 555-4567, 
1.123.555.4567 and so on. The same goes for sequences of characters that look 
like a Web address (URL), such as http://www.WebSiteName.com or www.
WebSiteName.com. When the iPhone sees what it assumes to be a URL, it 
appears as a blue link on your screen.
If you tap a phone number or URL sequence like the ones just shown, the 
iPhone does the right thing. It launches the Phone application and dials the 
number for a phone number, and it launches Safari and takes you to the 
appropriate Web page for a URL. That’s useful, but somewhat expected. 
What’s more useful and not so expected, is the way Safari handles phone 
numbers and URLs.
Let’s start with phone numbers. When you encounter a phone number on a 
Web page, give it a tap. A little dialog box appears on the screen displaying 
that phone number and offering you a choice of two buttons: Call or Cancel. 
Tap Call to switch to the Phone application and dial the number; tap Cancel 
to return to the Web page.
Here’s another cool Safari trick, this time with links. If you press and hold on 
a link rather than tapping it, a little floating text bubble appears and shows 
you the underlying URL.
 
You also see the underlying URL if you press and hold on a URL in Mail or 
Text. We find that having this information provided here is even more useful 
because it enables you to spot bogus links without switching to Safari or 
actually visiting the URL.

222
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Finally, here’s one last Safari trick. If you press and hold on most graphic 
images, a Save Image button appears. Tap it and the picture is saved to the 
Camera Roll in the Photos application.
Share the Love
Ever stumble on a Web page you just have to share with a buddy? The 
iPhone makes it dead simple. From the site in question, tap the + button at 
the bottom of the browser. Then tap the Mail Link to this Page button that 
appears on-screen. When you do this, a mail message appears with the sub-
ject line pre-populated with the name of the Web site you’re visiting, and the 
body of the message pre-populated with the URL. Just type something in the 
message body (or don’t), supply your pal’s e-mail address, and tap the Send 
button.
Choosing a Home Page for Safari
You may have noticed that there’s no home page Web site on the iPhone ver-
sion of Safari as there is in the Mac and PC versions of the browser (and for 
that matter every other Web browser we know of). Instead, when you tap the 
Safari icon, you return to the last site you visited.
The trick is to create an icon for the page you want to use as your home page, 
and the technique is called creating a Web clip of a Web page. Here’s how to 
do it:
 
1. Open the Web page you want to use as your 
home page and tap the + button.
 
2. Tap the Add to Home Screen button.
 
 An icon that will open this page appears on your 
Home screen (or one of your Home screens if 
you have more than one).
 
3. Tap this new Web clip icon instead of the 
Safari icon, and Safari opens to your home 
page instead of to the last page you visited.
 
You can even rearrange the icons so that your 
home page icon, instead of the Safari icon, appears 
in the dock (the bottom row that appears on every 
home screen), as shown in Figure 18-2. See the tip 
in Chapter 1 for rearranging icons if you’ve forgot-
ten how.
Figure 18-2: Notice that 
the My Home icon appears 
where Safari usually 
appears in the dock.

Storing Files
A tiny Massachusetts software company known as Ecamm Network is sell-
ing an inexpensive piece of Mac OS X software that lets you copy files from 
your computer to your iPhone and copy files from the iPhone to a computer. 
(There is no Windows version.) Better still, you can try the $19.95 program 
called PhoneView for a week before deciding whether you want to buy it. Go 
to www.ecamm.com to fetch the free demo.
In a nutshell, here’s how it works. After downloading the software onto your 
Mac, double-click the program’s icon to start it. To transfer files and fold-
ers to the iPhone (assuming there’s room on the device), click the Copy To 
iPhone button on the toolbar and click to select the files you want to copy. 
The files are copied into the appropriate folder on the iPhone. Alternatively, 
you can drag files and folders from the Mac desktop or a folder into the 
PhoneView browser.
To go the other way and copy files from your iPhone to your computer, high-
light the files or folders you want copied, and click the Copy From iPhone 
button on the toolbar. Select the destination on your Mac where you want 
to store the files and then click Save. You can also drag files and folders 
from the PhoneView file browser onto the Mac desktop or folder. Or you can 
double-click a file in the PhoneView browser to download it to your Mac’s 
Documents folder.
If you need access to the files on your iPhone, or if you want to use your 
iPhone as a pseudo-hard disk, PhoneView is a bargain.
Create Ringtones for Free in GarageBand
Though it was beyond the purview of the ringtone discussions earlier in 
the book, it is relatively easy to create free iPhone ringtones with Apple’s 
GarageBand application (which is bundled with every Mac). Start by launch-
ing GarageBand and creating a new Music project. Then:
 
1. Click the Media Browser button to reveal the Media Browser pane.
 
2. Click the disclosure triangle to reveal the contents of your iTunes 
library.
 
3. Click your iTunes music library to reveal its contents.
 
4. Click the song you want to turn into a ringtone and drag it onto the 
timeline (Hello Muddah, Hello Faddah! in Figure 18-3).

224
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
 
Figure 18-3: Creating a custom ringtone, part I.
 
 You can’t use songs purchased from the iTunes store for ringtones 
because they are protected by Apple’s digital rights management copy 
protection. GarageBand won’t let you drag a protected song onto its 
timeline. So you can make ringtones only out of songs you’ve ripped 
yourself from CD or downloaded without rights management or other 
copy protection (such as MP3s from Amazon.com).
 
5. Click the Cycle Region button to enable the Cycle Region.
 
6. Click in the middle of the Cycle Region and drag it to the portion of 
the song you want to use as your ringtone.
 
7. Fine-tune the beginning and end points by clicking and dragging the 
Cycle Region’s left and right edges, as shown in Figure 18-4.

 For best results, keep your ringtones under 30 seconds.
 
8. Click the Play button to hear your work. When you’re satisfied with it, 
choose Share➪Send Ringtone to iTunes.
The next time you sync, your new ringtone becomes available on your 
iPhone. To use it as your ringtone, tap Settings, tap Sounds, tap Ringtone, 
and then tap the ringtone in the list of available sounds. To associate it with 
a specific contact or contacts, find the contact in either the Contacts applica-
tion or the Phone app’s Contacts tab, tap Ringtone, and then tap the ringtone 
in the list of available sounds.

Taking a Snapshot of the Screen
True confession: We threw in this final tip because, well, it helps people like us.
Permit us to explain. We hope you’ve admired the pictures of the iPhone 
screens that are sprinkled throughout this book. We also secretly hope that 
you’re thinking what marvelous photographers we must be.
Well, the fact is, we couldn’t take a blurry picture of the iPhone using its 
built-in (and undocumented) screen-grab feature if we wanted to.
Press the Sleep/Wake button at the same time you press the Home button, 
but just for an instant. The iPhone grabs a snapshot of whatever is on the 
screen.
The picture lands in the iPhone’s Camera Roll, from where you can synchro-
nize it with your PC or Mac, along with all your other pictures. And from 
there, the possibilities are endless. Why, your picture could wind up just 
about anywhere, including in a For Dummies book.
