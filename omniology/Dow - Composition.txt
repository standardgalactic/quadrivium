BEGINNINGS
IN
writing this book my main purpose
is to set forth a way of thinking about
art.
The most that such a book can
do
is
to
direct the thoughts, awaken a
sense of power and point to ways of con-
trolling it.
The principles of art teaching here out-
lined might be
illustrated in other ways
and with better examples.
I hope
the
reader will see how each chapter can be
developed into many sets of lessons. The
progressions
can
be
varied,
materials
changed, lessons amplified and different
designs
chosen, providing
there
is
no
sacrifice of essentials.
The book
is based upon my experience
in painting and teaching for more than
twenty years.
The first edition of Com-
position was published in 1899.
In this
revision
I have made many additions
and used new illustrations without de-
parting from theory or principles.
Composition was
chosen as a
title be-
cause that word expresses the idea upon
which
the method
here
presented
is
founded
the
"putting
together"
of
lines, masses and colors to make a har-
mony.
Design, understood in
its broad
sense,
is
a
better
word,
but
popular
usage has restricted
it to decoration.
Composition, building up
of harmony,
is the fundamental process in all the fine
arts. I hold that art should be approached
through composition rather than through
imitative drawing.
The many different
acts and processes combined in a work
of art may be attacked and mastered one
by one, and thereby a power gained to
handle them unconsciously when they
must be used together.
If a few elements
can be united harmoniously, a step has
been taken toward further creation.
Only through the appreciations does the
composer recognize a harmony.
Hence
the
effort to find art-structure
resolves
itself into a development of appreciation.
This faculty
is a common human pos-
session but may remain inactive. A way
must be found to lay hold upon
it and
cause
it to grow.
A natural method
is
that
of
exercises
in progressive
order,
first building up very simple harmonies,
then proceeding on to the highest forms
of composition. Such a method of study
includes
all
kinds
of drawing,
design
and painting.
It offers a means of train-
ing for the creative artist, for the teacher
or for one who studies art for the sake
of culture.
This approach to art through Structure
is absolutely opposed to the time-hon-
ored approach through Imitation.
For
a
great while we have been
teaching
art
through
imitation
of nature and
the "historic styles" -leaving structure
to take care of itself; gathering knowl-

edge
of facts but acquiring
little power
to use them. This is why so much mod-
ern painting is but picture-writing
; only
story-telling, not art
; and so much archi-
tecture and decoration only dead copies
of conventional motives.
Good drawing results from trained judg-
ment, not from the making of fac-similes
or maps. Train the judgment, and ability
to draw grows naturally.
Schools that
follow the
imitative
or academic way
regard drawing as a preparation for de-
sign, whereas the very opposite
is the
logical order
design a preparation for
drawing.
Soon after the time of Leonardo da Vinci
art
education was
classified
into Rep-
resentative
(imitative), and Decorative,
with separate schools for each
a seri-
ous mistake which has resulted
in
loss
of public appreciation.
Painting, which
is
essentially a
rhythmic harmony
of
colored
spaces, became
sculptural, an
imitation of modelling.
Decoration be-
came trivial, a lifeless copying of styles.
The true
relation between
design and
representation was lost.
This
error
is
long-lived.
An
infinite
amount of time is wasted in misdirected
effort because tradition has a strong hold,
and because artists who have never made
a study
of education keep
to
old
ruts
when they teach.
This academic system of art-study ig-
nores fundamental structure, hence the
young pupil understands but few phases
of art.
Confronted with a Japanese ink
painting, a fresco by Giotto or a Gothic
statue he is unable to recognize their art
value.
Indeed he may
prefer modern
clever
nature-imitation
to
imaginative
work of any period.
Study of composition of Line, Mass and
Color leads to appreciation of
all forms
of art and of the beauty of nature.
Draw-
ing of natural
objects then becomes a
language of expression. They are drawn
because they are
beautiful
or because
they are
to be used in some art work.
Facility
in
drawing
will
come more
quickly in this way than by a dull rou-
tine of imitation with no definite end in
view.
The history of this structural system of
art
teaching may
be
stated
in a few
words
; and here
I am given the oppo'
tunity to express my indebtedness *'
whose voice is now silent.

in Japan.
He was a philosopher and
logician gifted with a
brilliant mind of
great analytical power.
This, with rare
appreciation, gave him an

THE THREE ELEMENTS
I.
LINE
NOTAN
COLOR
ARCHITECTURE,
Sculpture,
Painting, Music and Poetry
are
the principal fine
arts.
Of these
the first three are called Space arts, and
take
the
various
forms
of
arranging,
building, constructing,
designing, mod-
elling and picture-painting.
In the space arts there are three struct-
ural
elements
with
which
harmonies
may be built up
:
1.
LINE.
The chief element of beauty
in
architecture, sculpture, metal work,
etching, line design and
line drawings.
Nos.
i, 2, 3, 6, 23, 38.
2. NOTAN.
The chief element in illus-
tration,
charcoal
drawing,
mezzotint,
Oriental ink painting and
architectural
light and shade.
Nos. 5, 59, 60, 61.
3. COLOR. The chief element in paint-
ing,
Japanese
prints,
textile
design,
stained
glass,
embroidery,
enamelling
and pottery decoration.
Nos.
8,
9, and
Chap. XIV.
Ni. LINE
The term LINE refers to boundaries of
shapes and the interrelations of lines and
spaces.
Line-beauty means harmony of
combined lines or the peculiar
quality
imparted by special treatment.
The term NOTAN, a
Japanese word
meaning "dark, light", refers to the quan-
tity of light reflected, or the massing of
tones of different values.
Notan-beauty
means the harmony resulting from the
combination of dark and light spaces
--
whether
colored
or
not - - whether
in
buildings, in pictures, or in nature.

Careful distinction should be made be-
tween NOTAN, an element of universal
beauty, and LIGHT AND SHADOW,
a single fact of external nature.
The term COLOR refers
to quality of
light.
These three structural elements are
in-
timately related.
Good color is depend-
ent upon good notan, and that in turn is
dependent upon good spacing.
It seems
reasonable then that a study of art should
begin with
line.
One
should learn to
think in terms of line, and be somewhat
familiar with simple spacing before at-
tempting notan or color. There is danger,
however, of losing interest by dwelling
upon one subject too long.
Dark-and-
light massing will reveal the mistakes in
spacing and stimulate to renewed effort.
Color will reveal the weakness of dark-

and-light.
Very
young
pupils
should
begin with color but the instructor will
take pains to include spacing and notan
in each
lesson.
In
general, however,
the best plan is to take up exercises
in
each element
in turn; then go back to
them separately and make more detailed
studies
; then combine them, proceeding
toward advanced compositions.
What-
ever be the choice of progression, there
must
be
a thorough grounding in
the
elementary relations of space cutting and
simple massings of dark-and-light.
This
is essential to successful work in design-
ing, drawing, modelling, painting, archi-
tecture and the crafts.

JAPANESE MATERIALS AND BRUSH PRACTICE
JAPANESE
brushes,
ink and paper
are to be preferred for exercises
in
line drawing, tracing, notan massing
and washes in grays.
Long brushes are best for long continu-
ous lines, short brushes for sharp corners
and broken lines.
For lettering, clip the
point of a long line-brush, (see p. 55)

.Unprinted wall paper
(lining paper)
is
serviceable for practice work.
"Bogus"
paper and cover papers can also be used
for line or mass.
Japanese ink must be ground upon the
ink-stone, a slab of slate. Intense black-
ness
can
be
secured
immediately
by
using only a few drops of water.
Dry the ink
stick, and wrap
in paper;
never leave it soaking. Ink of good qual-
ity, and a clean stone are essential.
Tools perfected by ages
of practice
in
line drawing and brush work, afford the
best training for hand and eye. Painting
with the Japanese brush leads directly
to oil painting.
If Japanese materials are
not to be obtained or are not desired, the
exercises can be carried on with pencil,
charcoal, water colors, crayons, and even
oil paint.
Japanese paper for artists' use is made
of the bark of the mulberry tree, and is

PRACTICE
For line drawing the brush
is held in a
perpendicular position, that it may move
freely
in
all
directions, much
like
the
etcher's needle.
The brush
should
be
well charged with ink, then pressed firm-
ly down upon the paper
till it spreads to
the width desired for the line.
Draw with the whole hand and arm in
one sweep, not with the fingers.

made by mere momentum, but by force
of will controlling the hand.
By draw-
ing slowly the line can be watched and
guided as it grows under the brush point.
Slight waverings are not objectionable
;
in fact they often give character to the
line.
EXERCISE
Begin with straight lines, remembering
that straightness of direction is the essen-
tial thing, not mere geometric straight-
ness.

This practice work can
be done upon

paper.
The aim
of such an
exercise
is to put the hand under con-
trol of the will, but too much time should
not be given to mere practice, apart from
design.
Quality and power of line are
illustrated
in the drawings of masters,

These may be copied
later on, for a study of advanced drawing.

PRINCIPLES OF COMPOSITION
III. WAYS OF CREATING HARMONY
FINE
art, by its very name, implies
fine relations.
Art study
is the at-
tempt
to
perceive
and
to
create
fine
relations
of
line, mass and
color.
This is done by original effort stimulated
by the influence of good examples.
As fine relations (that is, harmony, beau-
ty) can be understood only through the
appreciations,
the whole
fabric
of art
education should be based upon a train-
ing in appreciation.
This power cannot
be imparted
like information.
Artistic
skill cannot be given by dictation or ac-
quired by reading.
It does not come by
merely learning
to
draw, by imitating
nature, or by any process of storing the
mind with facts.
The power
is within
the question
is
how to reach
it and use
it.
Increase of power always comes with
exercise.
If one uses a little of his appre-
ciative faculty in simple ways, proceed-
ing on gradually to the more
difficult
problems, he
is
in
the
line of natural
growth.
To put together a few straight
lines, creating a harmony of movement
and spacing, calls
for exercise of good
judgment
and
appreciation.
Even
in
this seemingly limited field great things
are
possible
;
the
proportions
of
the
Parthenon and
Giotto's Tower can be
reduced to a few straight lines finely re-
lated and spaced.
Effective
progress
in
composition
de-
pends upon working with an organized
and definite series of exercises, building
one experience upon another, calling for
cultivated judgment to discern and de-
cide upon finer and finer relations.
Little
can be expressed until lines are arranged
in a Space.
Spacing is the very ground-
work of Design. Ways of arranging and
spacing I shall call
PRINCIPLES OF COMPOSITION
In my experience these
five have been
sufficient
:
1.
OPPOSITION
2.
TRANSITION
3.
SUBORDINATION
4.
REPETITION
5. SYMMETRY
These names are given to five ways of
creating harmony,
all being dependent
upon a great general principle, PROPOR-
TION or GOOD SPACING.
I.
OPPOSITION.
Two lines meeting
form a simple and severe harmony.
21

TION
III
PRINCIPLES
Examples will be found in Greek door-
OF COMPOSI- ways, Egyptian temples and early Re-
naissance architecture
;
in plaid design
;
also
in landscape where
vertical
lines
cut the horizon (see pp. 21, 45, 46.)
This principle is used in the straight line
work in squares and rectangles, pp.
32,
33
39. and m combination with
other
principles, pp. 25, 29.
N*l)
2.
TRANSITION.
The arrangement
thus designated involves a step beyond
Opposition.
Two straight lines meeting
in opposing
directions give an impres-
sion of abruptness, severity, or even vio-
lence
; the difference of movement being
emphasized.
If a third line is added, as
in the sketches below, the opposition
is
softened and an effect of unity and com-
pleteness produced.
This combination typifies
beauty
itself
which has been defined as consisting of
elements
of
difference harmonized by
elements of unity.
A very common example of Transition
is the bracket, No. 15.
The straight line
is modified into curves and may be elab-
orated with great complexity of model-
ling.
Instead of a drawn line of transition there
may be only a suggestion of one, but the
effect is the same
; a softening of the cor-
ner angle, No. 14 and pp. 58, 60.
In pic-
torial art the vignette, in architecture the
capital, are examples
of the
transition
principle.
In design an effect of Transi-
tion may be produced by radiation.
(Il-
lustrations below.)
Accidental transitions occur in nature in
the
branching
of
old
trees, where the
rhythmic lines are thus unified.

For
convenience
the
suggestions
for
class work are grouped together in the
following
EXERCISE
Opposition. Copy the sketches and illus-
trations, enlarged.
Design straight-line
arrangements
of mouldings, plaids and
rectangular panellings, Nos. 13, 18, 24.
Find examples
in nature, and draw
in
line, with brush, pen or pencil without a
border.

Copy the

fore.

;

Find
examples
in nature and draw

line. No. 18.
It is important in all such work to make
a number
of sketches from which the
best may be chosen.
3. SUBORDINATION.
Neither of the
foregoing principles is often found alone
as the basis of a single work.
Transition
in particular, usually serves to harmo-
nize the parts of a composition. The prin-
ciple Subordination is a great construct-
ive idea not only in the space arts but in
all the fine arts
:
To form a complete group the parts are
attached
or
related
to a
single domi-
nating element which
determines
the
character of the whole.
A tree trunk with its branches is a good
type of this kind of harmony
; unity se-
cured through the
relation
of principal
and subordinate, even down to the vein-
ings of leaves
a multitude of parts or-
ganized into a simple whole.
This way of creating beauty
is conspic-
uous
in the
perfect spacing and
line-
rhythm of Salisbury cathedral, St. Ma-
clou of Rouen and the Taj Mahal
;
in
Piero della Francesca's "Resurrection"
and Millet's "Goose-girl"
; in some By-
zantine design and Persian rugs (see pp.
58,65,
98.)
It governs the distribution of masses in
Dark-and-Light
composition,
and
of
hues in Color schemes.
It appears
in poetry
(the Odyssey
for
example) in the subordination of all parts
to the main idea of the subject.
It is used
constructively in musical composition.
Whenever unity
is to be evolved from
complexity, confusion reduced to order,
power
felt
through concentration, or-
ganization, leadership
then will be ap-
plied the creative
principle called here
Subordination.
In
Line Composition the arrangement
by
principal and
subordinate may be
made in three ways, No. 16
:
1.
By grouping about an
axis, as leaf
relates to stem, branches to trunk.
2.
By radiation, as in flowers, the ro-
sette, vault ribs, the anthemion.
3.
By size, as in a group of mountain
peaks, a cathedral with its spire and pin-
nacles, tree clusters, or Oriental rug with
centre and border
; p. 65.

Art-interest in any
of these
lies in the
fineness of relation. A throwing together
of large and small
; mere geometric ra-
diation; or conventional branching can
never be other than commonplace.

EXERCISE
The instructor draws flower or fruit with
stem and leaves. The pupil arranges this
motif in various rectangular spaces (page
25), combining the ist and 3rd forms of
subordination,
and
using
his
critical
judgment in a way that is of great value
to the beginner in composition. The pupil
now draws the same or similar subjects
from
nature, acquainting
himself with
their form and character
; then composes
them in decorative or pictorial panels -
an art-use of representative drawing as
well as exercise in appreciation.

Of all ways of creating harmony this is

and the dance, in
its primitive form, is

In early forms of art

From
the

on
Indian
bowls
and
pots, or
painted in earth colors on wigwam and
belt, or woven on blanket, this form of
space art has grown, through the com-
plexities of Egyptian and Peruvian textile
design to the splendor of Byzantine mo-
saic, the jewel patterns of the Moguls,
and Gothic sculpture
; from rock-cut pil-
lars of cave temples to the colonnade of
the Parthenon.

PRINCIPLES
OF COMPOSI-
TION
III
SYMMETRY.
The most common and
obvious way of satisfying the desire for
order is to place two equal lines or shapes
in exact balance, as in a gable, windows
each side of a door, or objects on a shelf.
The term Symmetry applies
to
three-
and four-part groups,
or
others where
even balance
is made, but here it refers
mainly to a two-part arrangement.
Sometimes construction produces Sym-
metry, as in the human
body
;
ships
;
Greek and
Rennaissance
architecture
;
furniture
; pottery
; books.
Partly from
this cause and partly through imitation,
Symmetry, like Repetition, has come to
be used in cheap and mean design where
no regard is paid to beauty of form.
Japanese
art, when
influenced by Zen
philosophy, as Okakura Kakuzo tells us
in "The Book of Tea", avoids symmetry
as uninteresting. In Gothic art, the prod-
uct of richly inventive and imaginative
minds, symmetry was never used in a
commonplace way.
This
Principle of
Composition
when
united to fine spacing,
produces, in ar-
chitecture an effect of repose and com-
pleteness
; in design a type
of severely

beautiful form, as seen in a Greek vase
or the treasures of the Sho-so-in at Nara
where so much of the older Japanese art
has been preserved.
A few examples of Symmetry are given
here
; the student will readily find others.
Exercises can be easily
devised, follow-
ing the steps suggested under other prin-
ciples.
See opposite, and Nos. 42, 43.
PROPORTION or GOOD SPACING.
Principles
of Composition,
I must
re-
peat, are only ways of arranging lines
and shapes
; art is not produced by them
unless they are used in combination with
this general
principle,
Good Spacing.
They are by no means recipes
for
art,
and their names are of little consequence.
Appreciation of fineness of relations must
always govern the method and form of
composition.
It is possible to use all the
principles here
discussed, and to com-
plete
all the exercises, without gaining
much, if any, art experience.
The main
thing
is
the
striving
for
the
best,
the
most harmonious, result that can be ob-
tained.
One way to accomplish
this is
to
compare and
choose
continually -
making many designs under one subject
and selecting the best.
The great general
principle of Propor-
tion needs no special illustration or exer-
cise, because it is so intimate a part of all
other principles and exercises.
It may
be studied in every example of supreme
art.
It is the foundation of all the finest
work in line and mass.
The mystery of
Spacing will be revealed
to
the mind
that has developed Appreciation.

working with the principles
long enough to understand
their
nature,
and to see what
can be
done with them, the student is ready for
problems
in
composition.
Practice
in
line arrangement is a preparation for all
kinds of art work, be
it design, painting,
sculpture or architecture.
Choose an enclosed area of definite and
regular
shape, and break
it up
into a
harmonious group of smaller areas by
drawing lines.
For these elementary ex-
ercises
in
composition
the square and
circle are best because their boundaries
are
unchangeable, and
attention must
be fixed upon interior lines. Take first the
square, using straight lines of equal thick-
ness drawn with the brush as suggested
in chapter
II.
The
result should be a
harmony of well-cut space, a little musi-
cal theme in straight lines and grouped
areas.
Make many
trial arrangements,
sketching lightly with charcoal on " bo-
gus" or
lining paper.
Select the best,
correct them, and draw with brush and
ink over the charcoal lines. From these
choose the most satisfactory, place thin
Japanese paper over them and trace in
firm black lines, freehand, with the Jap-
anese brush.
Avoid hard wiry lines and
all that savors of rule and compass or
laborious pains-taking.

Tracing,
for the art-purpose of improv-

proportions and
acquiring an

help to
the
production
of good work.
Architects use tracing-paper for changes
in
plans.
Japanese
artists trace again
and again until satisfied with the quality
of touch and strength of drawing.
Straight
line
is
chosen
for
elementary
practice because of its simplicity, and be-
cause
it prepares for work with curves.
The finest curve is measured by a series
of straight lines in harmonic relations of
rhythm and
proportion
(p.
42).
After
some experience with straight
line, cut
areas with
curved,
geometric, flower,
fruit, landscape or figure.
Equal thickness of line is advisable now,
to fix attention upon direction, touch and
spacing.
Variation in width will come
later in notan of line (page 54) and in rep-
resentative drawing (page 51) where tex-
ture and modelling are to be indicated.
The main purpose of this and
all exer-
cises in this book is the creation of har-
mony, hence if the result has but a slight
degree of line-beauty it can be considered
a first step in Art.

VARIATION
IN
the search for finer relations there
must be every opportunity for choice
;
the better the choice, the finer the art.
The square and circle allow choice only
as to interior divisions, but the rectangle
is
capable
of
infinite
variation
in
its
boundary lines.
The scientific mind has sought, by anal-
ysis of many masterpieces, to discover
a set of perfect proportions, and to re-
duce them
to
mathematical
form,
for
example, 3
: 5, or 4
: 7.
The secret of spacing in Greek art has
been looked
for in the "golden mean",
viz
: height is to length as length is to the
sum
of height and
length.
Doubtless
such formulae were useful for ordinary
work, but the finest things were certainly
the product of feeling and trained judg-
ment, not
of mathematics.
Art
resists
everything that interferes with free choice
and
personal
decision;
art knows no
limits.
Poverty of ideas is no characteristic of
the
artist;
his mind
is ever striving to
express itself in new ways.
The personal choice of proportions, tones
and colors stamps the work with indi-
viduality.
A master
in
art
is always
intensely individual, and what he does
is an
expression
of
his own
peculiar
choices.
The beauty of proportion in your rec-
tangle
is measured by your feeling
for
fine relations, not by any formula what-
ever.
No work has art-value unless
it
reflects
the
personality
of
its
author.
What everybody can do
easily,
or by
rule, cannot be art.
The study of Variation tends to lead the
mind away from the conventional and
humdrum, toward
original and individ-
ual expression.
Variation has no place
in academic courses of art teaching, but
in composition
it
is
a most
important
element.
The masters of music have shown the
infinite
possibilities
of
variation
the
same theme appearing again and again
with new beauty,
different quality and
complex accompaniment.
Even so can
lines, masses and colors be wrought into
musical harmonies and endlessly varied.
The
Japanese
color
print
exemplifies
this, each copy of the same subject being
varied in shade or hue or disposition of
masses to suit the restless inventive en-
ergy of its author.
In old Italian textiles
the same pattern appears repeatedly, but
varied in size, proportion, dark-and-light
and color.
In times when art
is deca-
dent, the designers and painters lack in-
ventive power and merely imitate nature
or the creations of others.
Then comes
Realism, conventionality, and the death
of art.

COMPOSITION
OF
POTTERY
FORMS.
Makers of modern commer-
cial ware usually
leave beauty
of line
out of account, thinking only of utility,
of the piece of pottery as a feeding-dish,
or as a costly and showy object.
The
glaring
white
glaze, harsh
colors and
clumsy shapes
of common table-ware
must be endured until there is sufficient
public appreciation to demand something
better;
yet even
this
is
less
offensive
than the kind that pretends to be art-
bad
in
line
and
glittering
with
false
decoration.
Pottery, like other craft-products, is truly
useful when it represents the best work-
manship,
combined
with
feeling
for
shape,
tone,
texture
and
color,
in a
word, fine art.
Such quality is found, to mention only
a few
cases,
in some
of the "peasant
wares";
in the best Japanese
pottery,
ancient and modern
;
in Chinese, espec-
ially of the Sung period (A. D. 960-1280)
;
in Moorish, Persian, Rhodian and Greek.
When each maker tried to improve upon
older
models, and had the
taste
and
inventive genius to do
it, the art grew to
supreme excellence
;
even fragments of
such handicraft are now precious.
The difference between the contours of
a really
great piece of pottery and an
ordinary one may seem very slight, but
in just this little difference lies the art.
EXERCISE
One good way to stimulate invention in
composing pottery shapes
is
to evolve
them from
rectangles.
In the
straight
line there is strength
; a curve is measured
by a series of straight lines connected in
rhythm.
No. 323.
This principle is rec-
ognized in blocking out a freehand draw-
ing,
a process often misunderstood and
exaggerated.
Curved
profiles are only variations
of
rectangular forms, for example the bowl
in No. 32 b.
Change the height and a series of new
shapes will result.
As the top and bot-
tom lines remain the same we have to
compare the curved sides only.
Another
effect
(c) comes from varying
42

the width
; and still another (d) by chan-
ging both height and width.
In No. 33 are students' drawings of pot-
tery profiles evolved from rectangles.
For brushwork, in this exercise, it is well
to indicate the lines of the rectangle in
pale
red,
the
pottery
in black.
Make
many sketches, select the best
profiles,
improve them by tracing in ink, and com-
pare with historic pieces.
Drawing from
the
finest examples
of
pottery, and making original variations
of the forms, will aid
in drawing from
the cast or the nude, because of the inti-
mate study of the character of curves.
FLOWERS and other forms as LINE-
MOTIVES'. The rectangular space may
be subdivided, as was the square, by a
simple line-motif,
flower, fruit, still life,
animal or figure,
following some Prin-
ciple
of Composition.
In
chapter
III,
under
Subordination,
an
exercise was
suggested and
illustrated;
it could be
taken up again at this point, with new
subjects, for a study of Variation. As rect-
angular compositions will be found un-
der Notan and Color,
it is not necessary
to
consider them further here as
pure
line, except
in the case of Landscape,
to which a special chapter is given.

LANDSCAPE COMPOSITION
THE
modern
arbitrary
division of
Painting
into
Representative and
Decorative
has
put
composition
into
the background and brought
for-
ward nature-imitation
as a
substitute.
The picture-painter is led to think of like-
ness to nature as to the most desirable
quality for
his work, and the designer
talks of "conventionalizing"; both judg-
ing their art by a standard of Realism
rather than of Beauty.
In the world's art epochs there was no
such division.
Every work of space-art
was regarded as primarily an arrange-
ment, with Beauty as
its raison d'etre.
Even a portrait was
first of all a com-
position, with
the
facts and the
truth
subordinate
to
the
greater
idea
of
aesthetic structure.
Training in the fund-
amental principles of Composition gave
the
artists a wide
field
they were at
once architects, sculptors, decorators and
picture-painters.
Following this thought of the oneness of
art, we find that the picture, the plan, and
the pattern are alike in the sense that each
is a group of synthetically related spaces.
Abstract design is, as it were, the primer
of painting, in which principles of Com-
position appear
in a clear and definite
form.
In the picture they are not so ob-
vious, being found in complex interre-
lations and concealed under detail.
The designer and
picture-painter
start
in the same way.
Each has before him
a blank space on which he sketches out
the main lines of his composition.
This
may be called his Line-idea, and on
it
hinges the excellence of the whole, for no
delicacy of tone, or harmony of color can
remedy a bad proportion. A picture, then,
may be said to be in
its beginning actu-
ally a pattern of lines.
Could the art stu-
dent have this fact in view at the outset,
it would save him much time and anx-
iety.
Nature will not teach him compo-
sition.
The sphinx
is not more
silent
than she on this point.
He must learn
the secret as Giotto and della Francesca
and Kanawoka and Turner learned
it,
by the study of art itself in the works of
the masters, and by continual
creative
effort.
If students could have a thorough
training in the elements of their profes-
sion they would not fall into the error of
supposing that such a universal idea as
Beauty of Line could be compressed into
a few cases like the "triangle," "bird's-
wing," "line of beauty," or "scroll orna-
ment," nor would they take these notions
as a kind of receipt for composing the
lines of pictures.
Insistence upon the placing of Compo-
sition above Representation must not be
considered as any undervaluation of the
latter.
The
art student must learn
to
44

represent nature's forms, colors and ef-
fects
; must know the properties of pig-
ments and how to handle brushes and
materials.
He may have
to study the
sciences
of perspective
and
anatomy.
More or less of this knowledge and skill
will be required in his career, but they
are only helps to
art, not substitutes for
it, and
I believe that
if he begins with
Composition, that
is, with a study of art
itself, he will acquire these naturally, as
he feels the need of them.
Returning now to the thought that the
picture and the abstract design are much
alike in structure, let us see how some of
the simple spacings may be
illustrated
by landscape.
Looking out from a grove we notice that
the trees, vertical straight lines, cut hor-
izontal lines,
an arrangement in Oppo-
sition and Repetition making a pattern
in rectangular spaces. Compare the ging-
ham and landscape on page 22.
This is
a common effect in nature, to be trans-
lated into terms of art as suggested in the
following exercise.

No. 34 is a landscape reduced to its main
lines, all detail being omitted.
Make an enlarged copy of this, or design
a similar one.
Then, in the attempt to
find the best proportion and the best way
of setting the
subject upon canvas
or
paper, arrange this in rectangles of vary-
ing shape, some nearly
square,
others
tall, others long and narrow horizontally
as in No. 35.
To bring the whole land-
scape into all these will not, of course, be
possible, but in each the
essential lines
must be retained.

EXERCISE
To discover the best arrangement, and
to get the utmost experience in line and
space composition, the landscape should
be set into several boundaries of differing
proportions,
as
in Chapter V, and
as
shown in the examples, keeping the es-
sential
lines of the subject, but varying
them to
fit the boundary.
For instance,
a tree may be made taller in a high ver-
tical
space
than
in
a low
horizontal
space, (No. 37 below).
After working out this exercise the pupil
may draw a landscape from nature and
treat it in the same way.
Let him rigor-
ously exclude
detail, drawing only the
outlines of objects.

COMPOSITION
IN REPRESENTATION
IN
academic art teaching representa-
tion is the starting-point.
This means
that one must
first of all "learn
to
draw", as power in art is thought to be
based upon ability to represent accurate-
ly and truthfully either nature's facts or
historic ornament.
I use the word "aca-
demic"
to define
all teaching founded
upon representation. The theory may be
summed up in two points
:
1.
Store the mind with facts, to be used
in creative work later on.
2.
Technique
is
best
acquired by the
practice of object and figure drawing.
The first is a purely scientific process, a
gathering up of data, with no thought of
harmony or originality
; hence drawing
with such an end in view is not
strictly
art-work.
Nor does the
artist need to
lumber up his mind
; nature is his store-
house of facts.
The second
point has
more reason, but when the aim is for mere
accuracy, only a limited amount of skill
is acquired and that often hardly more
than nice workmanship
not
art-skill.
The powerful drawing of the
masters
is largely derived from other masters,
not from copying nature.
It is an inter-
pretation with the purpose of attaining
a high standard.
Such drawing aims to
express character and quality in an indi-
vidual way
a thing quite different from
fact-statement.
Nature-drawing,
wrongly
placed
and
misunderstood, has become a fetich in
our modern teaching. Our art critics talk
of "just" rendering, "true" values, "con-
scientious" painting and the like; terms
that belong to morals, not art, and could
not be applied to Architecture, Music or
Poetry.
These stock-phrases are a part
of that tradition of the elders
that eight-
eenth century academism still lingering.
Representation has but a small place in
the
art of the world.
This
is roughly
shown in the two lists below
:
NON-REPRESENTATIVE
Architecture
Furniture.
Wood carving.
Pottery.
Modelling,
mouldings and pattern.
Metal work.
Inlay,
mosaic, etc.

COMPO-
SITION IN
REPRESEN-
TATION
The nature-imitators hold that accurate
representation is a virtue of highest or-
der and to be attained in the beginning.
It is undeniably serviceable, but to start
with it is to begin at the wrong end.
It is
not the province of the landscape paint-
er, for example, to represent so much to-
pography,
but to
express an emotion;
and this he must do by art.
His art will
be manifest in his composition;
in his
placing of his trees, hills and houses in
synthetic relations to each other and to
the space-boundary. Here is the strength
of George Inness; to this he gave his chief
effort.
He omits detail, and rarely does
more than indicate forms.
This relation among the parts of a com-
position is what we
call Beauty, and
it
begins to exist with
the
first few lines
drawn.
Even the student may express a
little of it as he feels
it, and the attempt
to embody it in lines on paper will surely
lead to a desire to know more fully the
character and shapes of things, to seek
a knowledge of drawing with enthusi-
asm and pleasure.
These things are said, not against nature-
drawing
I should advise more rather
than less
but against putting it in the
wrong place.
The main difference between Academic
and Structural (Analytic and Synthetic)
is not in the things done, but in the rea-
son
for doing them, and
the
time
for
them.
All processes are good
in their
proper places.
The
relation of representative drawing
to a synthetic scheme is this
:
One uses
the facts of nature to express an idea or
emotion.
The
figures, animals, flowers
or
objects
are chosen
for the
sake
of
presenting some great historical or relig-
ious thought as in della Francesca's An-
nunciation (No. 36), for decoration of an
architectural space (Reims capital, No.
38), because the landscape has
special
beauty as in Hiroshige's print (No. 8), or
because the objects have form and color
suggesting a high order of harmony, as
in Chinese and Japanese
paintings
of
flowers, or Leonardo's drawings of in-
sects and reptiles.
Another reason for drawing
is found in
the use of the shapes or hues in design.
Desire to express an idea awakens inter-
est in the means.
Observation
is keen,
close application is an easy task, every
sense
is alert to accomplish the under-
taking. This is quite different from draw-
ing anything and everything for practice
only.
Mere accuracy has no art-value what-
ever.
Some of the most pathetic things
in the world are the pictures or statues
whose only virtue is accuracy. The bare
truth may be a deadly commonplace.
Pupils
should look for character; that
includes all truth and all beauty.
It leads
one to seek for the best handling and to
value power in expression above success
in drawing.
Composition is the greatest aid to repre-
sentation because
it cultivates judgment
as to relations of space and mass. Com-
position does not invite departure from
nature's truth, or encourage inaccuracies
of any kind
it helps one to draw in a
finer way.

NOTAN OF LINE.
As
long
as the

of a
design are kept of uniform
width, the beauty
is limited to propor-

Dark-and-Light.
The textile designers who are restricted
to straight
lines, have recourse
to
this
principle.
They widen lines, vary their
depth of tone, glorify them with color,
and show
that what seems a narrow
field is really one of wide range.
EXERCISE
Choose some of the previous geometric
line patterns, and widen certain of the
lines, as illustrated in the plate.
Incident-
ally this will give good brush
practice,
as the lines are to be drawn at one stroke.

LETTERING.
When forming part of
an artistic composition, in books, posters,
manuscripts,
illuminations,
etc.,
letter-
ing should be classed as Notan of Line.
Obviously the spacing of masses of let-
ters has
first consideration, and is usu-
ally a simple problem in rectangular com-
position. The effect is a tone or group of
tones more or less complicated according
to sizes of letters, thickness of their lines
and width of spaces between and around
them.
I have found
the reed-pen and
the Japanese brush (clipped) the best in-
plements for students' lettering (see be-
low).
Having suggested that Lettering,
including Printing, as an
art,
is a prob-
lem in composition of line and notan,
it
seems hardly worth while
to introduce
special
exercises
here.

reader is referred to his book " Writing,

There may be several starting-

or charcoal upon paper, by copying the

photographs of
masterpieces, or by making scales.
Ex-
perience has shown that the straight-line
design and the
flat black ink wash are
most satisfactory for earlier exercises in
two values.
Instead of black and white,
or black and gray, one might use two
grays of different values, or two values
of one
color
( say light blue and dark
blue) according to need.
The aim being to understand Notan as
something by which harmony may be
created,
it
is best to avoid Representa-

FLOWER COMPOSITIONS
TWO VALUES
Flowers, having
great
variety
of
line
and
proportion,
are
valuable,
as
well
as
convenient
subjects
for elementary
composition.
Their
forms and
colors
have furnished themes for painters and
sculptors since the beginning of Art, and
the treatment has ranged from abstrac-
tions to extreme realism;
from
refine-
ments of lotus-derived friezes to poppy
and rose wall papers of the present time.
In the exercise here suggested, there
is
no intention of making a design to apply
to anything as decoration, hence there
need be no question as to the amount of
nature's
truth
to
be
introduced.
The
flower may be rendered
realistically, as
page 23.) A small spray in the middle of
a big oblong, or disconnected groups of
flowers, cannot be called compositions;
all the lines and areas must be related
one to another by connections and plac-
ings, so
as
to form a beautiful whole.
Not
a
picture of a flower
is sought,
that can be left to the botanist
but rather
an irregular pattern of lines and spaces,
something far beyond the mere drawing
of a flower from nature, and laying an
oblong over
it, or vice versa.
EXERCISE
The instructor chooses one of the best
flower compositions done under Line, or
draws a flower in large firm outlines on
the blackboard, avoiding confusing de-
tail, and giving the character as simply
as possible.
The pupil
first copies the
in some Japanese design, or reduced to
instructor's drawing, then he decides up-
an
abstraction
as

the Greek, with-
out in the least affecting the purpose in

In this part of the exercise the arrange-
ment of shapes of light with shapes of
dark, occupies the attention, rather than
shading, or the rendering
of shadows.
Hence the flowers and leaves and stems,
or parts of them, may be black or white,
according to the feeling of the
student.
Let him choose out of his several draw-
ings those which he considers best. The
instructor can then criticise, pointing out
the best and the worst, and explaining
why
they
are
so.
A mere aimless or
mechanical blackening of paper, without
effort to arrange, will
result in nothing
of importance.
The examples show the variety of effects
produced by flowers of different shapes,
and the beauty resulting from schemes
of Dark-and-Light in two values.

TEXTILE PATTERNS AND RUGS
TWO VALUES
A
line-scheme
underlies
every
notan
composition, and a notan-scheme under-
lies every color composition.
The three
elements have
the
closest
relation one
to another.
For purposes of study, how-
ever,
it is necessary to isolate each ele-
ment, and even the separate principles
of each.
In the present
instance, Notan can be
separated from Line by taking a
line-
design of acknowledged excellence and
making many Notan
variations
of
it;
being
sure
of beauty of line, the only
problem is to create beauty of tone.
As
this
brings
in
historic
art,
let me
note that the works of the past are best
used, in teaching, as illustrations of com-
position,
(p. 40).
While the knowledge of a " style
" may
have a commercial value,
it has no art-
value
unless
the
designer
can
make
original and
fine
variations
of
it,
not
imitations.
The
first essential
is to appreciate
the
quality of historic examples, hence the
student should work from the
objects
themselves,
from
photographic
copies,
from tracings, or from casts.
The com-
monplace lithographic plates and rude
wood cuts in some books of design are
useless for our purpose.
They give no
hint of the original.
If the actual paint-
ing on an Egyptian mummy case is com-
pared with a page of one of these books,
the poor quality of the latter is instantly
apparent.
Chinese and Japanese " orna-

of such
books

Copying a part or the whole
of some
good rug
in line and color
is the best
way to become aquainted with the spac-
ing, motives and quality.
Then design
a rug with border and centre, the shapes
to be pure inventions or symbols.
Bor-
der and centre must differ, and there are
many ways of doing this even
in two
values,
for instance
:
Border
: Black figures on white ground.
Centre :White figures on black ground.

a
line-art, when de-
signed to enrich architectural spa-
ces, may have the aid of notan in
the form of relief and shadow. The range
of tone is narrow and the field seems lim-
ited, but the masters have shown that the
creative imagination knows no bounds.
They have expressed every emotion-
divine calm, serenity, excitement,
fury,
horror
; and effects of light, atmosphere,
distance.
The pediment and metopes of the Greek
temple owed as much to notan as to line
;
we can infer from the restorations what
the original scheme was.
Greek archi-
tecture, however, did not admit of exten-
sive
enrichment
with
sculpture; there
were few spaces to
fill, and those not ad-
vantageous as to position, shape or light-
ing.
As
the
temple
evolved
into the
Christian church, the new forms of build-
ing and the new story to tell called for
sculpture.
Through Byzantine and Ro-
manesque
it took a fresh
start, pushing
upward and outward
until
it
flowered
abundantly
in
Gothic.
Although
the
church selected the themes, the sculptor
might interpret form and facial expres-
sion
as
his
imagination
directed, and
compose his groups as he chose.
Old
conventions were abandoned
; the artist
might now seek motifs in his own mind
or in nature. The result of this liberation
of individual creative power was great
art.
The Gothic designer used
notan
with
dramatic
invention and
magical
strangeness.
The French cathedrals of
the best period (XI to XIV century) not-
ably Paris, Chartres, Amiens and Reims,
show how
sculptural
traditions
were
boldly broken and the most daring
ef-
fects accomplished without forgetting the
character of stone
or the
architectural
requirements.

Much ap-

In addition to original composition, the
student should copy from masterpieces
of design and
pictorial
art,
translating
them into three values.
LANDSCAPE AND PICTURES
For three-value
studies one may
use
ink, charcoal or oil paint.
The two latter
are
particularly
suitable
for landscape
designs
and
illustrative
work.
Char-
coal
should be used
lightly
and
very
freely.
It gives
effects of vibration, at-
mosphere, envelope and
light, but
the
handling
requires
special
study
and
much practice.
The first few exercises in charcoal land-
scape may be in flat tones
( see No.
55,
page 85 ), and the student may find it well
to make a scale of three values in this
medium;
he must
learn however

Nos. 55, 57, and p. 57.
After the
principle of three values has
been demonstrated, and the student can
appreciate definite intervals of tone, the
instructor should allow great freedom in
execution, not even limiting to three notes
but adding one or two others if necessary
to good expression.
For oil painting, mix the three tones in
quantity sufficient to paint several stud-
ies.
Ivory Black and Burnt Sienna will
give a good neutral gray.
For the color
of blue china or the Abruzzi towels, use
Prussian Blue, Black and White.
Opin-
ions differ as to the use of diluting medi-
ums, and sizes of brushes, for oil painting.
I should advise thinning the color with
linseed oil and turpentine (half and half),
and using large flat bristle brushes.
Can-
vas should be fairly rough in texture.
If
the surface to be painted on is smooth,
either wood,
pasteboard,
or canvas,
prepare a ground with thick paint, leav-
ing brush-marks.
~
APPLICATIONS, THREE VALUES
Use of the principle of three values in
out-door sketching and
in
illustration,
has been explained above.
There is one
application, among
others,
that should
be made by the student at this point
composition of a book-page.
The usual illustrated page is an arrange-
ment in three tones,
white paper, gray
type, dark picture.
The value to the pub-
lisher depends quite as much upon the
picturesque
effect of the
illustration as
upon its drawing.
Size and placing, dis-
position of type, amount of margin, are
matters of Line Composition ; but choice
of type, and the tone of the
illustration
belong to Notan
Composition.
Hence
the student will gain much from design-
ing pages, in ink, charcoal or oil, using as
pictures the copies from masters, or orig-
inal studies.
Picture, title, initial letter,
and body of type must be so composed
that the result will be effective and har-
monious, No. 58.

or seven tones, the student can undertake
original composition.

dations enter where needed for finer ef-
fect.
Study the work of the best illustra-
tors,
noting the tone-scheme
and

ETCHING
Etching, pen drawing and pencil sketch-
ing are line-arts.
The needle, pen and
lead pencil are tools for drawing
lines,
and there
is much reason in Whistler's
contention that tone and shading should
not be attempted with them.
The tool
always gives character to work, and the
best results are obtained when the pos-
sibilities of tools and materials are fully
appreciated.
If a sharp point is used in
drawing,
it will produce pure line, whose
quality may reach any degree of excel-
lence.
Whistler, in his etchings, worked
for the highest type of line-beauty
; shad-
ows and tones were
felt,
but
not
ex-
pressed.
On the other hand the artist is not subject
to restrictions and fixed laws.
He can-
not allow even a master to interfere with
his freedom; there is no " thou shalt " and
" thou shalt not "
in art.
Admitting the
value of all the arguments for restricting
the use of the needle to line only,the artist
observes that clustering of lines inevita-
bly produces tone and suggests massing
(notan of line, page 54)
that
this
effect
is developed in rich gradations by wip-
ing the etching-plate
in the process of
printing.
Etchers are thus tempted
to
use tone, and many masters, from Rem-
brandt down, have worked in tone more
often than in line.
PEN DRAWING
is a dry, hard process but one of great
value in modern illustration owing to the
ease with which
it may be reproduced.
It need not be as inartistic as
it usually
appears; observation
of pen work
will
show that, aside from faults in composi-
tion, failure in interest lies largely in the
handling.
Perhaps one pen only is used,
and
all textures treated
alike, whereas
every texture should have its own char-
acteristic handling; cross hatching or any
uniform system of shading with the pen
is deadly.
Study the rendering
; suggest
surface-quality
rather than
imitate
or
elaborate
; use a variety of pens.

ton has shown with what
art the reed

The brush may be used as a pen, values

PENCIL SKETCHING
Much that has been said of etching and
pen drawing
is equally true of the hard
lead pencil; but the soft pencil has many
of

qualities
of
charcoal.
It may
even be made to resemble the ink wash.

work
is
that
in which
line
is the main
thing,
shading being
only
suggested.
These
darks, whether meant for shadows, lo-
cal tone, or color, will form a " spotting "
to which is largely due the interest of the
sketch.
If shading is attempted, the tones, wheth-
er gray or dark, are made by laying lines
side by
side, not by cross-hatching or
going over twice.
A pencil sketch must
be off-hand, premier coup, brilliant and
characterful.
Two examples are given

pencil, pen or

COLOR THEORY
COLOR,
with
its
infinity
of rela-
tions, is baffling
;
its finer harmo-
nies, like those of music, can be
grasped by the appreciations only, not
by reasoning or analysis.
Color, in art,
is a subject not well understood as yet,
and there are violent differences of opin-
ion among
artists, teachers and
critics,
as to what constitutes good color-instruc-
tion.
The most that I can do here is to
outline a simple method of study.

For those who intend to use color in cre-

The
words " Value " and " Chroma " are used
in this connection by Albert H. Munsell,
to whose book "A Color Notation" the
reader is referred for a very convincing
exposition of color theory.
Mr. Munsell has invented a photometer
to measure values of light and color, and
has prepared scales, spheres, charts and
pigments for school use.

APPLICATION.
Choose a line-design,
and paint the spaces with colors from
the
second
circle.
The
effect
will
be
peculiar because there are no differences
of dark-and-light or intensity
; the only
harmony possible comes from interplay
of hues, a kind
of iridescence and
vi-
bration
; see opposite page.
Colors that stand opposite in circle
as
blue, yellow-red
; or
red, blue-green -
will, if placed side by side, increase each
other's power and produce violent con-
trast.
Opposition of Color is analogous
to Opposition of Line (page 21) and Op-
position of Notan (black and white). To
unite these extremes of difference, bring
in a third hue
related to each, for ex-
ample,
red, green-yellow, blue-green;
yellow,
yellow-red,
purple-blue.
This
is the principle of Transition (page 22)
;
see also page 82, three values.
Practice in composing with few and sim-
ple elements, of deciding when contrast-
ing colors are
of equal value, or equal
intensity, is of direct use in art. The land-
scape painter opposes the whole sky to
the whole ground
; he wants a vibration
of color in each, without disturbing the
values;
the
designer
in
stained
glass
sometimes desires to fill a space with ir-
idescent color, perhaps as a background
for figures.
The student may, if he likes, use black
with these colors, producing a very bril-
liant effect like a Cairo window
; but here
the hues
are measured
against black,
rather than against each other.

ed for practice in color
;
it does not re-
place nature-painting or original design,

COPYING COLOR from TEXTILES.
The
exercises described above may be
taken with textiles. Beauty of color in the
finest of these is due to good composition,
the softening of dust and age-stain, and
the atmospheric envelope caused by re-
flection of light from the minute points of
the web.
For some kinds of textile the
charcoal paper, as above, may be useful
;
for others, gray paper and wax crayons.
The latter are excellent for copying rugs
and can be used in original designs
for
rugs.
As to models, work from originals in mu-

The process
of wood block printing
is
very simple, and in my opinion of special
educational value.
After observation of
the craft in India in 1904
I determined
to introduce
it
into
art
courses
both
for adults and children.
The method is
outlined below :
1. Design the pattern in pencil or ink.
2. Draw the unit, with attention to its
shape and proportions and the
ef-
fect when repeated.
3. Paste this face down upon a wood
block; pine, gum wood, or a hard
wood of close grain.

As the block is

Printing. Lay a piece of felt upon
a slate, or upon a glass, pour a few
drops of mucilage upon the felt, and
mix with
it either common water
color, or dry color.
Distribute this

Wrapping paper can be found in many
colors, tones and textures, and
is inex-
pensive.
Damp paper will
give
clear-
cut impressions.
Lay the paper upon the large pad; charge
the block upon the small pad, and stamp
the pattern.
If the impression
is poor,
the cause may be:
(a) Face of block
is not level ; rub
it upon a sheet of fine
sand-paper;
(b) large pad is uneven; (c)
paper
is wrinkled
or
is too
glossy; (d)
color is too thick or too wet.
Practice
will overcome these small difficulties.
PRINTING
on CLOTH.
The
best
effects are obtained with dyes, but their
manipulation is not easy, and their per-
manence is doubtful unless one has expert
knowledge
of the processes
of dyeing.
The most convenient medium
for the
student is oil color thinned with turpen-
tine (to which may be added a very little
acetic acid and oil of wintergreen). This,
when
dry,
is
permanent and
can
be

but

with
hot water
or

With the design in fixed form upon the
block,
effort can be
concentrated upon
the make-up of the pattern, and the col-
or-harmony. By cutting a block for each
color the designer may vary the schemes
almost to
infinity.
Where choices are

can have free play.

are given on page zai.

cult, but fascinating form of this art-craft.

binding all together.
For these qualities
the Japanese process is best, with its per-
fected tools and methods. In theory it is
very simple: The outline is drawn in ink
upon
thin paper, and the sheet pasted
face down upon the flat side of a board;
the block
is then engraved with a knife
and gouges, the drawing being left in re-
lief; the paper is removed from the lines
with a damp cloth, and the block charged
with ink.
Dry black mixed with mucil-
age and water, or any black water color
will answer.
For charging, the Japanese
use a thick short brush,
a round bristle
brush
will
serve
the
purpose.

is scrubbed evenly over the whole

Artists often say that it matters not how

it. This
is misleading ;
it does matter,
the great-
est painters get their
effects
in
a
fine
way.
Methods
of handling
oil
color may be
reduced to two general classes
:
(a) the
paint
is used thin, as a wash, on a pre-
pared canvas, or (b)
it is put on in thick
opaque touches.
In either case the aim
is the same
to paint for depth, vibra-
tion, illusion of light and color.
If brush
strokes are to be left intact, each of them
must have shape and meaning,
that is,
line
;
if color
is put on
in a
thin wash,
then its value, gradation, hue and texture
are the main points,
and these belong
to structural harmony.
Mural painting is the highest form of the
art, demanding perfect mastery of Com-
position.
The subject takes visible form
in terms of Line ; then is added the mys-
tery, the dramatic counter-play of Notan,
and the illumination of Color.

ative spirit moves onward absorbing in
its march all drawing, perspective, anat-

CONCLUSION
I have not attempted
to overthrow old
systems, but have pointed out their faults
while
trying
to
present
a
consistent
scheme of art study.
The intention has
been to reveal the sources of power; to
show the student how to look within for
the
greatest help; to teach him not to
depend on externals, not to lean too much
on anything or anybody.
Each subject has been
treated sugges-
tively rather than exhaustively, pointing
out ways of enlargement and wide ap-
plication.
If some subjects have seemed
to receive rather scant attention it is not
because
I am
indifferent
to them, but
because I did not wish to depart from the
special theme of the book
; some of these
will be
considered
in
future
writings.
The book will have accomplished its pur-
pose if I have made clear the character
and meaning of art structure
if the stu-
dent can see that out of a harmony of
two lines may grow a Parthenon pedi-
ment or a Sorbonne hemicycle; out of
the rude dish
of the Zuni a Sung tea-
bowl, out of the totem-pole a Michelan-
gelo's " Moses "
; that anything in art is
possible when freedom
is given to the
divine gift APPRECIATION
