Preface
The output voltage of a power inverter is a pure sinusoidal waveform with minimum 
distortion. However, for practical inverters, the output voltage is a series of rectangular 
waveforms. The major issue for the control of the power inverters is obtaining suitable 
modulation methods to control the output rectangular waveforms in order to synthe-
size the desired waveforms. Therefore, a modulation control method is ­required to get 
a desired fundamental frequency voltage and to eliminate higher-order harmonics as 
much as possible.
Higher frequencies are employed in traditional pulse width modulation (PWM) 
methods because the undesirable harmonics present at higher frequencies, which can 
be filtered easily and several kilohertz, is well above the acoustic noise level. However, 
the traditional PWM methods cause electromagnetic interference (EMI). The rapid 
change in voltage (dv/dt) is the cause of EMI. A high dv/dt produces ­common-mode 
voltages across the windings of motor and leads to damage it.
In multilevel inverters, as the switching involves several small voltages, the rapid 
change in voltage is smaller. Further, switching at the fundamental frequency will 
also result in a decrease in the number of times these voltage changes occur per 
­fundamental cycle. However, harmonic elimination is a major issue for multilevel 
inverters. The harmonic elimination in multilevel inverters has been proposed in this 
book for the following reasons:
i.	
Harmonics in output voltage create power losses in equipments.
ii.	 Harmonics are the source of EMI. Protecting devices like snubber circuits and 
filters have to be incorporated in the designed circuits to eliminate harmonics. 
Hence, the cost of the circuits increases.
iii.	 EMI can interfere with signals used to control power electronic devices and radio 
signals.
iv.	 Harmonics can create losses in power equipments. Harmonic currents in an 
induction motor will dissipate the power in the stator and motor windings.
v.	
Harmonics can lower the load power factor.
As mentioned earlier, multilevel inverters result in a better approximation of the 
­sinusoidal waveform because of the increased number of DC voltage levels. The 
­increased number of DC voltage levels provides an opportunity to eliminate more 
­harmonic contents. The remaining harmonic content can be easily eliminated by less 
expensive smaller filters; because of large number of DC voltages used in multilevel 
inverters to block smaller voltages, several switches are needed. Since switch stress 
is reduced and lower switch ratings are used, if any component fails in the inverter, it 
will be still usable at reduced power level. In a multilevel inverter, there will be more 
than one way to generate the desired voltages due to switching redundancies. This will 
allow for the utilization of smaller and more reliable components. One ­disadvantage

 Preface
of multilevel inverters is that they require more devices than traditional inverters. The 
system cost may increase. The probability of system failure increases and the control 
of the switches is also more complicated because of more devices.
There are four kinds of control methods for multilevel inverters: traditional PWM 
control method, selective harmonic elimination method, space vector control method, 
and space vector PWM method. Space vector PWM is considered a better technique of 
PWM implementation owing to its associated advantages such as better fundamental 
output voltage, better harmonic performance, and easier implementation in digital 
signal processor and microcontrollers.
For these reasons, in this book, space vector PWM-based algorithms are proposed 
and implemented for neutral point-clamped multilevel inverter fed induction motor. 
These space vector-based algorithms generate not only the desired fundamental 
frequency voltages, but also eliminate the harmonics up to the maximum possible 
extent and results in reduces total harmonic distortion (THD).
The work presented in this book offers a general approach for PWM techniques 
and multilevel inverter topologies. The main objective of this book is to provide 
detailed analysis and implementation of space vector PWM technique applied to 
neutral point-clamped multilevel inverter. This book is extremely useful for undergra-
duate students, postgraduate students, industry people, and especially for research 
scholars working in the area of multilevel inverters.
This book presented various space vector PWM-based algorithms for multilevel 
neutral point-clamped inverter fed induction motor. The performance of these algo-
rithms are evaluated in terms of inverter output voltage, current waveforms, THD, 
speed of induction motor, and torque ripples, and the results have been analyzed and 
presented.
Chapter organization of the book
This book is organized in the following manner: 
Chapter 1 discusses pulse width modulation, various basic pulse width modulation 
techniques, advanced modulation techniques, space vector pulse width modulation 
technique, and the advantages of pulse width modulation techniques.
Chapter 2 presents the features of space vector pulse width modulation, space vector 
concept, and the two-level inverter. The implementation of space vector pulse width 
modulation technique is explained in detail and is applied to a two-level inverter.
Chapter 3 presents the introduction to multilevel inverter, multilevel inverter topo-
logies, and their working principles. The advantages and disadvantages of various 
topologies are discussed in detail.

Chapter 4 presents the space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) algorithm for a 
three-level inverter fed induction motor. This SVPWM algorithm provides high-safety 
voltages with fewer harmonic components compared with two-level structures. The 
results and analysis of this method have been presented and analyzed in this chapter. 
Chapter 5 presents a method for the generation of space vector PWM for multilevel 
inverters based on fractal approach for three- and five-level inverters. The fractal 
approach reduces algorithm complexity and execution time. The results and analysis 
of this method have been presented and analyzed in this chapter.
Chapter 6 explains a qualitative space vector pulse width modulation algorithm for 
neutral point-clamped multilevel inverter. In this method, the duty cycles of reference 
voltage vectors are corrected accordingly to identify the location of the reference 
voltage vector in each region. The appropriate switching sequence of the region and 
calculation of the switching ON times for each state are estimated. The results of this 
qualitative space vector pulse width modulation method have been presented and 
analyzed in this chapter.
Chapter 7 describes a space vector pulse width modulation algorithm using the 
decomposition method for seven-level inverter. In this method, the space vector 
diagram of the seven-level inverter is decomposed into six space vector diagrams of 
four-level inverters. In turn, each four-level inverter is decomposed into three-level 
inverters, and finally, the three-level inverter is decomposed into six space vector dia-
grams of two-level inverters. The proposed method reduces algorithm complexity and 
execution time. It can also be applied to the multilevel inverters above the seven-level.
Chapter 8 presents an analytical space vector pulse width modulation for multilevel 
inverters, which improves inverter performance. This method is based on the intrin-
sic relation between multilevel and two-level space vector pulse width modulation, 
and the dwelling time of vector calculation is derived from a two-level inverter. This 
method is applied up to the eleven-level inverter, which can be extended to the n-level 
inverter as well. The results have been presented and analyzed.

1 Pulse width modulation techniques
In power electronic converters, the electrical energy from one level of voltage/current/
frequency is converted into another using semiconductor-based electronic switch. 
The essential characteristic of these types of circuits is that the switches are operated 
only in one of two states – either fully ON or fully OFF – unlike other types of electrical 
circuits where the control elements are operated in a linear active region.
As the power electronics industry developed, various families of power electronic 
converters have evolved, often linked by power level, switching devices, and topolo-
gical origins [3]. Application areas of power converters improved vastly in semicon-
ductor technology, which offer higher voltage and current ratings as well as better 
switching characteristics. Meanwhile, the main advantages of modern power electro-
nic converters are high efficiency, low weight, small dimensions, fast operation, and 
high-power densities.
The process of switching the electronic devices in a power electronic converter 
from one state to another is called ‘modulation’. Each family of power converters has 
preferred modulation strategies associated with it that aim to optimize the circuit ope-
ration for the target criteria most appropriate for that family. Parameters such as swit-
ching frequency, distortion, losses, harmonic generation, and speed of response are 
typical of the issues that must be considered when developing modulation strategies 
for a particular family of converters. The output voltage of power inverter should be 
a pure sinusoidal waveform with minimum distortion. However, for practical inver-
ters, the output voltage is a series of rectangular waveforms. The major issues for 
the control of the power inverters are to get suitable modulation methods to control 
the output rectangular waveforms to synthesize the desired waveforms. Therefore, 
a modulation control method is required to get a desired fundamental frequency 
voltage and to eliminate higher-order harmonics as much as possible.
In modern converters, pulse width modulation (PWM) is a high-speed process 
ranging depending on the rated power from a few kilohertz (motor control) up to 
several megahertz (resonant converters for power supply). Therefore, first, we discuss 
about the principle and different topologies regarding PWM.
1.1 Pulse width modulation
The PWM technique is one of the most widely used strategies for controlling the ac 
output of power electronic converter. In this technique, the duty cycle of converter 
switches can be varied at a high frequency to achieve a target average low frequency 
output voltage or current. Modulation theory has been a major research area in power 
electronics for over three decades and continues to attract considerable attention and 
interest.

 1 Pulse width modulation techniques
In principle, all modulation schemes aim to create trains of switching pulses 
that have the same fundamental volt-second average as a target reference waveform 
at any instant. The major difficulty with these trains of switched pulses is that they 
also contain unwanted harmonic components that should be minimized. Hence, for 
any PWM scheme, the primary objective can be identified, which is to calculate the 
converter switching ON times, which creates the desired (low-frequency) target output 
voltage or current. Having satisfied this primary objective, the secondary objective 
for a PWM strategy is to determine the most effective way of arranging the switching 
process to minimize unwanted harmonic distortion, switching losses, or any other 
specific performance criterion [7].
The dc input to the inverter is chopped by switching devices in the inverter. The 
amplitude and harmonic content of the ac waveform is controlled by varying the duty 
cycle of the switches. The fundamental voltage V1 has a maximum amplitude of 4 Vd/π 
for a square wave output, but by creating notches, the amplitude of V1 is reduced.
Usually, the power switches in one inverter leg are always either in ON or OFF 
state. Therefore, the inverter circuit can be simplified into 3 two-position switches. 
Either the positive or the negative dc bus voltage is applied to one of the motor phases 
for a short time. PWM is a method whereby the switched voltage pulses are produced 
for different output frequencies and voltages. A typical modulator produces an average 
voltage value, equal to the reference voltage within each PWM period. Considering a 
very short PWM period, the reference voltage is reflected by the fundamental of the 
switched pulse pattern. The concept of pulse width modulation is shown in Fig. 1.1.

There are several different PWM techniques, differing in their methods of 
­implementation. However, in all these techniques, the aim is to generate an output 
voltage, which after some filtering, would result in a good-quality sinusoidal output 
voltage waveform of desired fundamental frequency and magnitude. However, in the 
case of inverters, it may not be possible to reduce the overall voltage distortion due to 
harmonics, but by proper switching control, the magnitudes of lower-order harmonic

voltages can be reduced, often at the cost of increasing the magnitudes of higher order 
harmonic voltages. Such a situation is acceptable in most cases, as the harmonic vol-
tages of higher frequencies can be satisfactorily filtered using lower sizes of filters and 
capacitors. Many of the loads, like motor loads, have an inherent quality to suppress 
high-frequency harmonic currents, and hence, an external filter may not be neces-
sary. To judge the quality of voltage produced by a PWM inverter, a detailed harmonic 
analysis of the voltage waveform needs to be done.
In fact, after removing a third and multiples of third harmonics from the pole 
voltage waveform one obtains the corresponding load phase voltage waveform. The 
pole voltage waveforms of three-phase inverter are simpler to visualize and analyze, 
and hence, the harmonic analysis of load phase and line voltage waveforms is done 
via the harmonic analysis of the pole voltages. It is implicit that the load phase and 
line voltages will not be affected by the third and multiples of third-harmonic compo-
nents that may be present in the pole voltage waveforms.
1.2 Basic pulse width modulation techniques
1.2.1 Single pulse width modulation
In single PWM control, the width of the pulse is varied to control the inverter output 
voltage, and there is only one pulse half per cycle. By comparing the rectangular 
reference signal with the triangular carrier wave the gating signals are generated, 
as shown in Fig. 1.2. The frequency of reference signal determines fundamental 
­frequency of the output voltage.
The advantages of this technique are that the even harmonics are absent due to the 
symmetry of the output voltage along the x-axis and that the Nth harmonics can be eli-
minated from inverter output voltage if the pulse width is made equal to 2π/n. However, 
the disadvantages are that the output voltage introduces a great deal of harmonic 
content and that at a low output voltage, the distortion factors increases significantly.
1.2.2 Multiple pulse width modulation
In multiple PWM, several equidistant pulses per half cycle are generated, as shown 
in Fig. 1.3. Using several pulses in each half cycle of the output voltage, the harmonic 
content can be reduced.
In this technique, the amplitudes of lower-order harmonics are reduced and the 
derating factor is reduced significantly. However, the fundamental component of the 
output voltage is less, the amplitudes of higher-order harmonics increases signifi-
cantly, and switching losses are increased.

1.2.3 Sinusoidal pulse width modulation
In many industrial applications, to control the inverter output voltage sinusoi-
dal PWM (SPWM) is used. SPWM provides good performance of the drive in entire 
range of operation between 0 and 78% of the value that would be reached by square 
wave operation. If the modulation index exceeds this value, the linear relation-
ship between the modulation index and the output voltage is not maintained, and 
over-modulation methods are required. The SPWM refers to the generation of PWM 
outputs with sine wave as the modulating signal. In this modulation method, the ON 
and OFF instances of the PWM signals can be determined by comparing a reference 
signal with a high-frequency triangular wave, as shown in Fig. 1.4. The frequency 
of the output voltage can be determined by the frequency of the modulation wave. 
The peak amplitude of the modulating wave determines the modulation index and 
in turn controls the RMS value of the output voltage. When the modulation index is 
changed, the RMS value of the output voltage also changes. This technique improves 
the distortion factor significantly compared to other ways of multiphase modulation. 
It eliminates all harmonics less than or equal to (2n − 1), where n is defined as the

where (VA0)1 is the fundamental frequency component of the pole voltage VAO. The 
frequency modulation ratio (mf), which should be an odd integer, is the ratio between 
the PWM frequency and the fundamental frequency.
i.	
If mf is not an integer, subharmonics may exist at output voltage.
ii.	 If mf is not odd, dc component may exist and even harmonics are present at 
output voltage.
iii.	 mf should be a multiple of 3 for three-phase PWM inverter.
iv.	 An odd multiple of three and even harmonics are suppressed.
1.3 Advanced modulation techniques
1.3.1 Trapezoidal modulation
By comparing a triangular carrier wave (Vc) with a reference trapezoidal wave (Vr), 
the switching instance to semiconductor devices are generated as shown in Fig.1.5. 
This type of modulation increases the peak fundamental output voltage up to 1.05 Vd, 
but output voltage contains lower-order harmonics.
1.3.2 Staircase modulation
In staircase PWM, the modulated wave eliminates specific harmonics. To obtain the 
desired quality of the output voltage, the modulation frequency ratio mf and the 
number of steps are chosen as shown in Fig. 1.6. If the number of pulses is less than 15 
per half cycle, this is optimized PWM.

1.3.3 Stepped modulation
In this modulation, the signal is stepped wave. To control the magnitude of the fun-
damental component and to eliminate specific harmonics, this wave is divided into 
specific intervals, with each interval being controlled individually as shown in Fig. 1.7. 
When compared to that of normal PWM control, this type of control gives low distor-
tion but higher fundamental amplitude.
1.3.4 Harmonic-injected modulation
In this modulation, the signal is generated by injecting harmonics to the sine wave as 
shown in Fig. 1.8. The result is a flat topped wave form and it reduces the amount of 
over modulation. A higher fundamental amplitude and low distortion of the output 
voltage is provided. The amplitude of fundamental components is approximately 15% 
more than that of normal SPWM.

1.3.5 Delta modulation
In this modulation, a triangular wave is allowed to oscillate within a defined window Δv 
above and below the reference wave Vr. From the vertices of the triangular wave Vc, the 
output voltage is generated as shown in Fig. 1.9. This type of modulation is also known 
as hysteresis modulation. If the frequency of modulating wave is changed while keeping 
the slope of the triangular wave constant, the number of pulses and pulse widths of 
modulated wave would change. The fundamental output voltage can be up to Vs and is 
dependent on peak amplitude Ar and frequency fr of the reference voltage. This modula-
tion can control the ratio of voltage to frequency. Depending on the permissible harmo-
nic content in the inverter output voltage, machine type, power level, and semiconductor 
switching devices employed for a particular application, the particular PWM is chosen.
1.3.6 Space vector pulse width modulation
This modulation is a relatively new and popular technique in controlling motor 
devices. In the space vector PWM (SVPWM) method, the output voltage is approxima-
ted using the nearest three output vectors that the nodes of the triangle containing the

changes from one region to another, it may induce an abrupt change in the output 
vector. In addition we need to calculate the switching sequences and switching time 
of the states at every change of the reference voltage location.
1.4 Advantages of pulse width modulation techniques
i.	
Using PWM techniques, lower-order harmonics can be eliminated or minimized 
along with its output voltage control. The filtering requirements are also mini-
mized.
ii.	 Both output voltage control and frequency control are possible in a single power 
stage of the inverter without any additional components.
iii.	 The presence of constant dc supply permits the parallel operation of several 
independent PWM inverters on the same rectifier power supply. The PWM inver-
ter has a transient response that is much better than that of a quasi-square wave 
rectifier.
iv.	 The commutative ability of PWM inverters remains substantially constant com-
pared to variable dc-link inverter, irrespective of the voltage and frequency 
­settings.

The power factor of the system is good, as a diode rectifier can be employed on 
the line side.
vi.	 With constant dc supply used in PWM, we can obtain commutation even at low 
voltage, whereas a six-step inverter needs an auxiliary dc supply for commutating 
thyristors at low output voltages.
vii.	 The amplitude of the torque pulsations are minimized even at low speeds.
viii.	A sophisticated PWM technique eliminates lower-order harmonics in the motor 
current, low-speed torque pulsations, and cogging effects.

In this chapter, the necessity of PWM in various power electronic converters is pre-
sented in detail as well as the basic and advanced PWM techniques. The advan-
ced modulation techniques such as trapezoidal modulation, staircase modulation,

2 Space vector pulse width modulation  
technique
One of the most popular modulation approaches for two-level converters is space 
vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM), which is increasingly being used in the 
control of multilevel converters. This is an advanced and computation-intensive PWM 
technique. The SVPWM increases the output capability of sinusoidal PWM without 
distorting the line-to-line output voltage waveform.
The concept of space voltage vectors corresponding to various switching states 
has been applied in the study of impact of various switching states on the capaci-
tor charge balancing. An advantage of the SVPWM is the instantaneous control of 
switching states and the freedom to select vectors in order to balance the NP. Addi-
tionally, one can realize output voltages with almost any average value using the 
nearest three vectors, which is the method that results in the best spectral perfor-
mance. The SVPWM method is an advanced, computation-intensive PWM method 
and is possibly the best among all the PWM techniques for variable frequency drive 
applications. Because of its superior performance characteristics, it has been finding 
widespread application in recent years. If the switching frequency is high enough, the 
losses due to the harmonics can be almost neglected, and the SVPWM is a better solu-
tion in terms of inverter output voltage, harmonic losses, and number of switching  
per cycle [13].
2.1 Features of SVPWM
The SVPWM technique is more popular than conventional technique because of the 
following excellent features:
i.	 	It achieves the wide linear modulation range associated with PWM, third-harmonic  
injection automatically.
ii.	 	It has lower base band harmonics than regular PWM or other sine-based  
modulation methods, or otherwise optimizes harmonics.
iii.	 	15% more output voltage than conventional modulation, i.e. better dc-link  
utilization.
iv.	 	More efficient use of dc supply voltage.
v.	 	Advanced and computation-intensive PWM technique.
vi.	 	Higher efficiency.
vii.		Prevent unnecessary switching hence less commutation losses.
viii.	A different approach to PWM modulation based on space vector representation 
of the voltages in the α-β plane.

2.2 Space vector concept
The space vector concept is derived from the rotating field of ac machine that is used 
for modulating the inverter output voltage. In this modulation technique, the three-
phase quantities can be transformed to their equivalent two-phase quantity either 
in synchronously rotating frame or in stationary frame. From this two-phase compo-
nent, the magnitude of the reference vector can be found and is used for modulating 
the inverter output. The process of obtaining the rotating space vector is explained in 
the following section, considering the stationary reference frame.
Let the three-phase sinusoidal voltage component be
	
Va = Vm sin ωt
	
Vb = Vm sin ωt −2π
3 
	
Vc = Vm sin ωt + 2π
3  .	
(2.1)
When this three-phase voltage is applied to the ac machine, it produces a rotating 
flux in the air gap of the ac machine. This rotating flux component can be represented 
as single rotating voltage vector. The magnitude and angle of the rotating vector can 
be found by means of Clark’s transformation as explained below in the stationary 
reference frame. The representation of rotating vector in complex plane is shown in 
Fig. 2.1.

2.2.1 Principle of SVPWM
The SVPWM treats the sinusoidal voltage as a constant amplitude vector rotating at a 
constant frequency. This PWM technique approximates the reference voltage Vref by a 
combination of the eight switching patterns. A three-phase voltage vector is transfor-
med into a vector in the stationary d-q coordinate frame, which represents the spatial 
vector sum of the three-phase voltage.
2.2.2 Definition of space vector
The space vector Vsr constituted by the pole voltages Vao, Vbo, and Vco is defined as
	
Vsr = Vao + Vbo.ej 2π
3 + Vco.ej 4π
3 .	
(2.9)

16 
 2 Space vector pulse width modulation technique
The relationship between the phase voltages Van, Vbn, and Vcn and the pole voltages 
Vao, Vbo, and Vco is given by
	
Vao = Van + Vno; Vbo = Vbn + Vno; Vco = Vcn + Vno.	
(2.10)
Since Van + Vbn + Vcn = 0,
	
Vno =  ​ 
Vao + Vbo + Vco 
 
___________ 
3 
​,	
(2.11)
where Vno is the common mode voltage. From Eqs. (2.9) and (2.10), it is evident that 
the phase voltages Van, Vbn, and Vcn also result in the same space vector Vsr  . The space 
vector Vsr can also be resolved into two rectangular components, namely Vd and Vq. 
It is customary to place the d-axis along the A-phase axis of the induction motor.
Hence,
	
Vsr = Vd + jVq.	
(2.12)
2.2.3 Advantages of SVPWM
SVPWM is considered a better technique of PWM implementation owing to its associ-
ated advantages mentioned below:
i.	
Better fundamental output voltage.
ii.	 Better harmonic performance.
iii.	 Easier implementation in digital signal processor and microcontrollers.
2.3 SVPWM for the two-level inverter
2.3.1 Three-phase voltage source inverter
A three-phase two-level inverter with a star connected load can be represented, as shown 
in Fig. 2.2, where Vao, Vbo, and Vco are the inverter output voltages with respect to their 
return terminal of the dc source marked as ‘O’. These voltages are called pole voltages and 
Van, Vbn, and Vcn are the load phase voltages with respect to neutral (n). Each switching 
circuit configuration generates three independent pole voltages Vao, Vbo, and Vco. There 
are eight possible switching configurations, called the operating states or inverter states.
2.3.2 Determination of switching states
The possible pole voltages that can be produced at any time are +0.5 Vdc and −0.5 Vdc. 
For example, when switches S1, S6, and S5 are closed then a-phase and c-phase are



connected to the positive dc bus and b-phase is connected to negative dc bus, the 
corresponding pole voltages are:
	
Vao = +0.5 Vdc
	
Vbo = −0.5 Vdc
	
Vco = +0.5 Vdc
Using this procedure, the inverter state in the above equation is represented by the 
notation (+ − +) or 1 0 1 and the corresponding switching state is denoted by V6. Thus, 
every phase of a three-phase voltage source inverter (VSI) can be connected either to 
the positive or the negative dc bus. The switching states are shown in Fig. 2.3, which 
are designated using the code numbers 0 to 7.

In case of switching states V0 and V7 , all the three poles are connected to the same 
dc bus, effectively shorting the load and there will be no power transfer between 
source and load. These two states are called ‘null states’ or ‘zero states’. In case of 
other switching states, power transfers between source and load. Hence, these states  
(V1, V2,…V6) are called ‘active voltage vectors’ or ‘active states’.
In terms of phase voltages of inverter, the voltage space vector can be written as 
shown below:
	
Vsr = Van + Vbnej 2π
3 + Vcnej 4π
3 .
(2.13)
In terms of the pole voltages of the inverter, the voltage space vector can be written as
	
Vsr = Vao + Vbo.ej 2π
3 + Vco.ej 4π

In the implementation of SVPWM, the (a, b, c) reference frame voltage equations 
are transformed into the d-q reference frame, which is a stationary reference frame, 
as depicted in Fig. 2.4. As described in Fig. 2.4, this transformation is equivalent to 
an orthogonal projection of [a, b, c] onto the two dimensions perpendicular to the  
vector [1, 1, 1] (the equivalent d-q plane) in a three-dimensional coordinate system. The 
desired reference voltage vector Vref is obtained in the d-q plane by applying the similar

The switching times of the SVPWM-based inverter can be calculated using the volt-second 
relation. Figure 2.6 represents the calculation of switching times based on the voltage-
second relation of the reference vector Vsr. The volt-second produced by vectors V1, V2, and 
V7 or V0 along the d and q axes are the same as those produced by the reference vector Vref.

2.3.4 Optimized switching sequence
The aim of SVPWM is to approximate the reference voltage vector (Vref) in a samp-
ling period by time averaging the three voltage vectors. In the SVPWM strategy, the 
total zero voltage vector time is equally distributed between V0 and V7 . Further, the  
zero voltage vector time is equally distributed symmetrically at the start and at  
the end of the subcycle in a symmetrical manner. Moreover, to minimize the swit-
ching frequency and reduce the number of commutations, it is desirable that the 
switching sequence between the three voltage vectors involves only one commuta-
tion when there is a transfer from one state to the other. This requires the use of both 
zero vectors (V7 and V0) in a given sector and a reversal of the switching sequence 
every subcycle.
Thus, SVPWM uses V0 - V1 - V2 - V7–V7 - V2 - V1 - V0 in sector I, V0- V3- V2- V7–V7- V2- V3- V0 
in sector II, and so on. Table 2.1 depicts the switching sequence for all sectors. The 
switching times of the two-level inverter at each sector are shown in Tab. 2.2.
The two-level inverters have certain drawbacks:
i.	
These are not suitable for high-power levels.
ii.	 High-dc-link voltage requires series connection of devices.
iii.	 Difficulty in dynamic voltage during switching.
iv.	 Multilevel topology has been applied in several situations, such as high-voltage 
ac drive, FacTS, SVC, and so on.

Multilevel topology has the following advantages over traditional two-level 
topology:
i.	
The voltage blocked by the power device is decreased tremendously.
ii.	 Multilevel inverters produce low harmonic distortion for ac currents even for 
moderate switching frequency operation and the switch losses are lower than 
two-level inverters.

2.4 Conclusions
In this chapter, the most recommended PWM technique applied to power electronic 
inverters has been discussed in detail as well as the features of the space vector modu-
lation technique, concept of space vector with principle of operation, theoretical ana-
lysis of SVPWM, pros and cons, and finally, analysis of space vector modulation to 
two-level inverter. The analysis of VPWM, including the determination of switching 
states and calculation of switching times and optimized switching sequence when 
applied to a two-level VSI, has been presented with operation state diagrams. The 
main objective of this chapter is to help the reader understand how space vector modu-
lation is implemented in case of a two-level VSI. To enrich the analysis, the simula-
tion results of space vector pulse width-modulated two-level inverter are furnished at  
the end.

3 Multilevel inverter topologies
Recently, the multilevel inverter technology has emerged as a very important alternative  
in the area of medium-voltage, high-power applications. As the name indicates, mul-
tilevel inverters can produce more than two levels at its output phases. Multilevel 
inverters also provide benefits such as improved output voltage spectrum. Multile-
vel inverters offer many benefits for higher-power applications. In particular, these 
include the ability to synthesize voltage waveform with lower harmonic content than 
two-level inverters and operation at higher dc voltages using series-connected semi-
conductor switches. Multilevel inverters with neutral point-clamped (NPC) or diode-
clamped technology were introduced in 1980. In the 1990s, new multilevel inverter 
topologies were introduced. Some important multilevel inverter topologies are NPC 
multilevel inverter, flying-capacitor multilevel inverter, and cascaded H-bridge multi-
level inverter. However, due to simple construction features and other advantages, the 
NPC topology is widely used.
Higher frequencies are employed in traditional pulse width modulation (PWM) 
methods because of the undesirable harmonics occurring at higher frequencies, 
which can be filtered easily and several kilohertz well above the acoustic noise level. 
However, the traditional PWM methods cause electromagnetic interference (EMI). The 
rapid change in voltage (dv/dt) is the cause of EMI. A high dv/dt produces common-
mode voltages across the windings of motor and leads to damage.
In multilevel inverters, as the switching involves several small voltages, the rapid 
change in voltage is smaller. Further, switching at the fundamental frequency will 
also result in the decrease of the number of times these voltage changes occur per 
fundamental cycle. However, harmonic elimination is the major issue for multilevel 
inverters. For the following reasons, harmonic elimination in multilevel inverters has 
been proposed in this book.
i.	
Harmonics in output voltage create power losses in equipments.
ii.	 Harmonics are the source of EMI.
iii.	 Protecting devices such as snubber circuits and filters have to be incorporated 
in the designed circuits for the elimination of harmonics. Hence, the cost of the 
circuits increases.
iv.	 EMI can interfere with control signals used to control power electronic devices 
and radio signals.
v.	
Harmonics can create losses in power equipments. Harmonic currents in an 
induction motor will dissipate power in stator and motor windings.
vi.	 Harmonics can lower the load power factor.
As mentioned earlier, the use of multilevel inverters results in a better approximation 
to a sinusoidal waveform because of increased number of dc voltages. These increased 
number of dc voltages provides the opportunity to eliminate more harmonic contents.  
DOI 10.1515/9783110470420-003

24 
 3 Multilevel inverter topologies
The remaining harmonic content can be easily eliminated by less expensive, 
smaller filters. Because of the large number of dc voltages used in multilevel inver-
ters, several switches are needed to block smaller voltages. Since switch stress is 
reduced and lower switch ratings are used, if any component fails in the inverter, 
it will be still usable at reduced power level. In a multilevel inverter, there will be 
more than one way to generate the desired voltages due to switching redundancies 
[20]. This will allow for the utilization of smaller and more reliable components. 
One disadvantage of multilevel inverters is that they require more devices than 
traditional inverters. Hence, system cost may increase. The probability of system 
failure increases and control of the switches is also more complicated due to more 
devices.
There are four kinds of control methods for multilevel inverters. They are tradi-
tional PWM control method, selective harmonic elimination method, space vector 
control method, and SVPWM method. SVPWM is considered a better technique of 
PWM implementation owing to its associated advantages such as better fundamental 
output voltage, better harmonic performance, and easier implementation in digital 
signal processor and microcontrollers.
The main features of multilevel inverter are:
1.	
Ability to reduce the voltage stress on each power device due to the utilization of 
multiple levels on the dc bus.
2.	
Important when a high-dc side voltage is imposed by an application (e.g. traction 
systems).
3.	
Even at low switching frequencies, a small distortion in the multilevel inverter ac 
side waveform can be achieved (with stepped modulation technique).
3.1 Diode-clamped multilevel inverter
The diode-clamped multilevel inverter (dcMI) or NPC multilevel inverter is based on 
the concept of using diodes to limit power devices voltage stress. The structure and 
basic operating principle consists of series-connected capacitors that divide the dc 
bus voltage into a set of capacitor voltages.
i.	
A DCMI with n number of levels typically comprises (N − 1) capacitors on the dc 
bus.
ii.	 Voltage across each capacitor is Vdc/(N − 1).
iii.	 Output phase voltage can assume any voltage level by selecting any of the 
nodes.
iv.	 The DCMI is considered a type of multiplexer that attaches the output to one of 
the available nodes.
v.	
It consists of main power devices in series with their respective main diodes con-
nected in parallel and clamping diodes.
www.ebook3000.com


3.1 Diode-clamped multilevel inverter 
 25
vi.	 Main diodes conduct only when most upper or lower node is selected.
vii.	 Although the main diodes have the same voltage rating as main power devices, 
much lower current rating is allowable.
viii.	In each phase leg, the forward voltage across each main power device is 
clamped by the connection of diodes between the main power devices and the 
nodes.
ix.	 The number of power devices in the ON state for any selection of node is always 
equal to (N − 1).
The three-phase six-level diode-clamped inverter is shown in Fig. 3.1. Each of the three 
phases of the inverter shares a common dc bus, which has been subdivided by five 
capacitors into six levels. The voltage across each capacitor is Vdc and the voltage 
stress across each switching device is limited to Vdc through the clamping diodes. 
Table 3.1 lists the output voltage levels possible for one phase of the inverter with 
the negative dc rail voltage V0 as a reference. State condition 1 means the switch is 
ON, and 0 means the switch is OFF. Each phase has five complementary switch pairs, 
such that turning on one of the switches of the pair requires that the other comple-
mentary switch be turned off. The complementary switch pairs for phase leg ‘a’ are 
(Sa1, Sa′1), (Sa2, Sa′2), (Sa3, Sa′3), (Sa4, Sa′4), and (Sa5, Sa′5). Table 3.1 also shows that in a  
diode-clamped inverter, the switches that are ON for particular phase legs are always 
adjacent and in series. For a six-level inverter, a set of five switches is ON at any  
given time.

3.1.1 General features
i.	
For three-phase dcMI, the capacitors need to filter only the high-order harmonics of 
the clamping diodes currents, low-order components intrinsically cancel each other.
ii.	 For dcMI employing step modulation strategy, if n is sufficiently high, filters may 
not be required at all due to the significantly low harmonic content.
iii.	 If each clamping diode has same voltage rating as power devices, for n-level dcMI.
iv.	 Number of clamping diodes/phase = (N − 1) × (N − 2).
v.	
Each power device blocks only a capacitor voltage.
3.1.2 Advantages
i.	
All of the phases share a common dc bus, which minimizes the capacitance requi-
rements of the converter.
ii.	 The capacitors can be precharged as a group.
iii.	 Efficiency is high for fundamental frequency switching.
3.1.3 Disadvantages
i.	
Real power flow is difficult for a single inverter because the intermediate dc levels 
will tend to overcharge or discharge without precise monitoring and control.
ii.	 The number of clamping diodes required is quadratically related to the number of 
levels, which can be cumbersome for units with a high number of levels.

iii.	 N-level flying capacitor multilevel inverter has n-level output phase voltage and 
(2N − 1)-level output line voltage.
iv.	 The output voltage is produced by switching the right combinations of power 
devices to allow adding or subtracting of capacitor voltages.
For example, the three-phase six-level flying capacitor multilevel inverter is shown in 
Fig. 3.2. The structure of this inverter is similar to that of the diode-clamped inverter 
except that instead of using clamping diodes, the inverter uses capacitors in their 
place. This topology has a ladder structure of dc side capacitors, where the voltage on 
each capacitor differs from that of the next capacitor.

 3 Multilevel inverter topologies
3.2.1 General features
i.	
With step modulation strategy, with sufficiently high n, harmonic content can be 
low enough to avoid the need for filters.
ii.	 Advantage of inner voltage-level redundancies: allows preferential charging or 
discharging of individual capacitors and facilitates manipulation of capacitor 
voltages so that their proper values are maintained.
iii.	 Active and reactive power flow can be controlled.
iv.	 Additional circuit required for initial charging of capacitors.
3.2.2 Advantages
i.	
Phase redundancies are available for balancing the voltage levels of the capacitors.
ii.	 Real and reactive power flow can be controlled.
iii.	 The large number of capacitors enables the inverter to ride through short-duration 
outages and deep voltage sags.
3.2.3 Disadvantages
i.	
Control in tracking the voltage levels for all of the capacitors is complicated. Also, 
precharging all the capacitors to the same voltage level and startup are complex.
ii.	 Switching utilization and efficiency are poor for real power transmission. The 
large numbers of capacitors are both more expensive and bulky than clamping 
diodes in multilevel diode-clamped converters. Packaging is also more difficult 
in inverters with a high number of levels.
3.3 Cascade H-bridge multilevel inverter
This refers to modular structured multilevel inverter (MSMI) or series-connected 
H-bridge inverters. The structure and basic operating principle of cascade H-bridge 
multilevel inverter consists of (N − 1)/2 or h number of single-phase H-bridge inverters 
(MSMI modules). The MSMI output phase voltage is
V0 = Vm1 + Vm2 + . . . . . . + Vmh
Vm1 : output voltage of module 1
Vm2 : output voltage of module 2
Vmh : output voltage of module h
A single-phase structure of an m-level cascaded inverter is illustrated in Fig. 3.3. 
Each separate dc source (SdcS) is connected to a single-phase full-bridge or H-bridge

inverter. Each inverter level can generate three different voltage outputs +Vdc, 0, and 
–Vdc by connecting the dc source to the ac output by different combinations of the 
four switches S1, S2, S3, and S4. To obtain +Vdc, switches S1 and S4 are turned ON, 
whereas −Vdc can be obtained by turning ON switches S2 and S3. By turning ON S1 
and S2 or S3 and S4, the output voltage is 0. The ac outputs of each of the different 
full-bridge inverter levels are connected in series such that the synthesized voltage 
waveform is the sum of the inverter outputs. The number of output-phase voltage 
levels m in a cascade inverter is defined by m = 2s + 1, where s is the number of 
­separate dc sources.
3.3.1 Advantages
i.	
The number of possible output voltage levels is more than twice the number of dc 
sources (m = 2s + 1).
ii.	 The series of H-bridges makes for modularized layout and packaging. This will 
enable the manufacturing process to be done more quickly and cheaply.
3.3.2 Disadvantage
i.	
Separate dc sources are required for each of the H-bridges. This will limit its 
­application to products that already have multiple SdcSs readily available.
ii.	 As the level of the output voltage produced increases, the switch count will also 
increase.

 3 Multilevel inverter topologies
3.4 Conclusions
In this chapter, the state of the art of different multilevel inverters, which have poten-
tial applications in the area of medium-voltage and high-power applications, has been 
discussed. The fundamental multilevel inverter topology, principle of operation, and 
its features with advantages and disadvantages have been explained in detail for the 
three basic topologies. The limitations of the two-level inverters in terms of switching 
frequency, switching losses, and dv/dt issues have been resolved with multilevel  
inverters. A procedure for calculating the required ratings for the active switches, 
clamping diodes, and dc-link capacitors for N-level has been described. The main 
objective of this chapter was to provide a general idea to readers interested in multile-
vel inverters and the pros and cons of their real-time implementation.

4 Space vector pulse width modulation algorithm 
for the three-level inverter
Three-level inverter topology is widely used in high-voltage/high-power applications 
with currently available power devices because of its high-voltage handling and good 
harmonic rejection capabilities. In the previous chapters, the space vector pulse 
width modulation (SVPWM) scheme for the two-level inverter is described in detail. 
However, the three-level inverter roughly has four times better harmonic content com-
pared with two-level topology. The harmonic contents of the output voltage are fewer 
than those of the two-level inverter at the same switching frequency. In addition, the 
blocking voltage of each switching device is a half of the dc-link voltage and is thus an 
easy-to-realize high-voltage and large-capacity inverter system.
In this chapter, the SVPWM algorithm for a three-level inverter fed induction 
motor is presented and analyzed. This SVPWM algorithm provides high-safety volta-
ges with less harmonic components compared to two-level structures and reduces the 
switching losses by limiting the switching to two thirds of the pulse duty cycle. The 
voltage vector selection procedure, switching time calculation, and switching pattern 
generation for the three-level inverter are described in detail. This SVPWM algorithm 
contributed to the reduction of switching power losses and has the advantages of a 
three-level inverter that carry out voltage with contents of less harmonic injection 
than two-level inverter. The proposed method can be applied to multilevel inverters 
above the three-level inverters. However, as the level of inverter increases, the sector 
identification, switching vector determination, and dwelling time calculation become 
more complex. The computational complexity and the execution time increase.
The implementation of SVPWM involves:
i.	 Identification of the sector where the tip of the reference vector lies.
ii.	 Determination of the three nearest voltage space vectors.
iii.	 Determination of the duration of each of these switching voltage space vectors.
iv.	 Choosing an optimized switching sequence.
Sector identification can be done using coordinate transformation of the reference 
vector into a two-dimensional coordinate system. The sector can also be determined 
by resolving the reference phase vector along the a-, b-, and c-axes and by repea-
ted comparison with discrete phase voltages. After identifying the sector, the voltage 
vectors at the vertices of the sector are determined. Once the switching voltage space 
vectors are determined, the switching sequences can be obtained. The calculation of 
the duration of the voltage vectors can be simplified by mapping the identified sector 
to the sector corresponding to the two-level inverter. To obtain optimum switching, 
the voltage vectors are to be switched for their respective durations, in a sequence 
such that only one switching occurs as the inverter moves from one switching state

4.1 SVPWM for the three-level inverter
4.1.1 Three-level inverter topology and switching states
The schematic diagram of a three-level inverter is shown in Fig. 4.1. Each phase of the 
inverter consists of two clamping diodes, four IGBTs, and four freewheeling diodes. 
Since three kinds of switching states and terminal voltages exist in each phase, the 
three-level inverter has 27 (33) switching states. Figure 4.2 shows the representation 
of the space voltage vectors for output voltage and the space vector diagram of all 
switching states, where P, O, and N represent the terminal voltage, respectively, that is 
Vdc/2, 0, −Vdc/2 (Tab. 4.1). According to the magnitude of the voltage vectors, we divide 
them into four groups: zero-voltage vector (ZVV; V0), small-voltage vectors (SVVs; V1, 
V4, V7 , V10, V13, V16), middle-voltage vectors (MVVs; V3, V6, V9, V12, V15, V18), and large-
voltage vector (LVV; V2, V5, V8, V11, V14, V17). The ZVV has three switching states; SVV, 
two switching states; and the MVV and LVV have only one switching state.

4.1.2 Voltage vectors and calculation of switching times
Figure 4.3 shows the triangle formed by the voltage vectors V0, V2, and V5. This triangle 
is divided into four small triangles 1, 2, 3, and 4. In the space voltage vector PWM, 
generally, output voltage vector is formed by its nearest three vectors to minimize the 
harmonic components of the output voltage and the current. The duration of each 
vector can be calculated by vector calculation. For instance, if the reference voltage 
vector falls into triangle 3, the duration of each voltage vector can be calculated by the 
following equations:
	
V1Ta + V3Tb + V4Tc = V*TS

The torque, speed, and flux of the three-level inverter fed induction motor are shown 
in Fig. 4.17 for a load torque (TL) of 10.32 N-m. The harmonic spectrum of the inverter 
output voltage and the THD are shown in Fig. 4.18. Tables 4.4 and 4.5 show the com-
parison between two- and three-level inverter performances. The interpretation of all 
the results shows that in case of the three-level inverter, the output voltage, speed, 
and torque response considerably improves and that the torque ripples and the THD 
reduce.

From simulation results, the performance of the two- and three-level inverters has 
been analyzed. It shows that the three-level inverter is more effective than the two-
level inverter in terms of rotor speed of the induction motor and the THD (Tab. 4.4).

4.3 Conclusions
In the field of high-power, high-performance applications, multilevel inverters seem 
to be the most promising alternative. In this chapter, the application of SVPWM 
control strategy on three-level inverter has been proposed and analyzed. The propo-
sed SVPWM algorithm provides high-safety voltages with less harmonic components 
compared to two-level structures and reduces the switching losses by limiting the 
switching to two thirds of the pulse duty cycle. On the one hand, the latter aimed 
to prove the effectiveness of SVPWM in the contribution of switching power losses 
reduction and to show the advantage of the three-level inverter that carry out volta-
ges with contents of less harmonic injection than the two-level inverter. On the other 
hand, the simulation results show that as modulation index increases, the THD decre-
ases and the fundamental RMS value increases linearly. In the first proposed method, 
the obtained THD for the two- and three-level inverters are 54.02% and 28.60%,  
respectively.

5 Space vector pulse width modulation for 
multilevel inverters using fractal approach
In this chapter, the space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) for multilevel 
inverters using fractal approach has been proposed and implemented for three- 
and five-level inverters. This method is mainly based on the fact that the switching 
vector representation of any multilevel inverter has an inherent fractal structure, 
which is the basic unit of this structure, being a triangle made of the vertices of 
three adjacent inverter voltage space vectors. The proposed method uses simple 
arithmetic for determining the sector and does not require look-up tables; hence, 
the fractal approach is applied for multilevel inverters using SVPWM. The results 
have been presented and analyzed. The complexity and feasibility of this algorithm 
have been discussed.
The space vector representation of a higher-level inverter can be conceived as 
generated from the space vector representation of the two-level inverter, wherein the 
sectors of the two-level inverter get progressively divided and subdivided. The basic 
structure, a triangle (sector), is transformed by further dividing itself into smaller tri-
angles. A basic structure that evolves by dividing itself into structures similar to it has 
an associated fractal. The switching voltage space vector representation of multilevel 
inverters also has an associated fractal. In fractal theory, the basic triangle is divided 
into four smaller triangular regions, joined by the midpoints of the sides of the tri-
angle [101].
5.1 Inherent fractal structure of multilevel inverter
The voltage space vectors of the two-level inverter are shown in Fig. 5.1. The 
voltage space vector locations for a three-level inverter are shown in Fig. 5.2, where 
A00, A01, A02, A03, A04, A05, and A06 are same as the locations of the voltage space 
vectors of the two-level inverter. Consider the region marked 1 in the case of the 
two-level inverter, formed by the vectors located at A00, A01, and A02. In the case of 
the three-level inverter, this region has three additional voltage space vectors, as 
shown in Fig. 5.2.
It can be observed that the three additional voltage space vectors are located at 
the midpoints of each side of the sector of equivalent two-level inverter. The three 
additional switching voltage space vectors together with switching voltage space 
vectors located at A00, A01, and A02 results in four sectors within (sector 1) A00, A01, A02 of 
the three-level inverter. Considering the triangular region formed by the space vectors

be clearly observed that the nine additional vectors are located at the midpoints of 
the sides of sectors of the three-level inverter. The nine additional vectors together 
with the voltage space vectors of the three-level inverter results in 16 sectors within

(sector І) ΔA00A01A02 of the five-level inverter. In this manner each sector in the voltage 
space vector representation of an equivalent two-level inverter is divided into four 
smaller sectors, resulting in voltage space vector locations of the three-level inver-
ter. Each of the sectors of the three-level inverter is further divided into four smaller 
sectors resulting in switching space vectors of the five-level inverter. This process gets 
repeated for generation of space vectors of higher-level inverters.

This algorithm explains the procedure to adopt the SVPWM for multilevel inverters 
using the fractal approach.
i.	
Three-phase (a, b, c) to two-phase (d, q) transformation.
ii.	 Identify the sector where the tip of the reference vector is located.
iii.	 Determine the three nearest voltage vectors.
iv.	 Perform the triangularization algorithm.
v.

vi.	 For the higher-level implementation of the fractal approach, perform the triangula-
rization algorithm until the reference vector is nearer to the centroids of respective 
triangle where the triangularization is to be performed using Eqs. (5.12) to (5.14).

vii.	 Switching states are obtained using Eqs. (5.15) to (5.17).
viii.	Switching time durations are calculated, taking the basic two-level timings into 
consideration.
ix.	 Optimized switching sequence is calculated by (a) taking the virtual zero vectors, 
(b) eliminating the redundant switching states, and (c) considering optimum 
switching where only one switching is involved as the inverter changes from one 
state to another.
5.2.1 Three-phase (a, b, c) to two-phase (d, q) transformation
The three phase quantities can be transformed to their equivalent two phase quanti-
ties either in synchronously rotating frame or stationary frame. From this two-phase 
component the reference vector magnitude can be found and used for modulating the 
inverter output.
The three phase sinusoidal voltage components are
	
Va = Vm sin ωt
	
Vb = Vm sin ωt −2π
3 
	
Vc = Vm sin ωt + 2π
3 	
(5.10)
The magnitude and angle of the rotating vector can be found by means of Clark’s 
transformation. Then, the (d, q) coordinates of the corresponding space vector can 
be obtained as
	
Vd = 3
2 Va
Vq = 3
2 Vb −Vc .	
(5.11)
5.2.2 Location of the reference voltage vector
The identification of sector where the tip of the reference vector lies can be done 
using coordinate transformation of the reference vector into a two dimensional 
coordinate system. The sector can also be determined by resolving the reference 
phase vector along a, b and c axes and by repeated comparison with discrete phase 
voltages.


5.2 SVPWM algorithm using the fractal approach 
 51
After identifying the sector, the voltage vectors at the vertices of the sector are to be 
determined. This can be done by the comparison of reference angle with sector angle; 
Fig. 5.4 depicts SVPWM with six sectors in (d, q) reference frame with α as the refe-
rence angle.
If the reference angle
0° < α < 60°, reference vector is in sector 1
60° < α < 120°, reference vector is in sector 2
120° < α < 180° reference vector is in sector 3
180° < α < 240° reference vector is in sector 4
240° < α < 300° reference vector is in sector 5
300° < α < 360° reference vector is in sector 6
The location of tip of reference frame passing through different layers can be found 
in Fig. 5.5. If the reference vector is in layer 1, it represents the two-level inverter  
operation and the reference vector in layer 2 represents the three-level inverter, the 
reference vector in layer 3 represents the four-level inverter, and the reference vector 
in layer 4 represents the five-level inverter.
After identifying the sector, the voltage vectors at the vertices of the sector are to 
be determined. The nearest three voltage vectors of the reference vector are the verti-
ces of the sector.
5.2.3 Determination of nearest three voltage vectors
The space vector voltage is located in a hexagon surrounded by different states of the 
inverter that gives different voltage magnitudes of the output voltage. These inverter

states are nothing but the ON/OFF states of the devices. After identifying the sector 
where the tip of the reference vector is located, the voltage vectors of this sector are 
determined to find out the three nearest voltage vectors of space vector voltage Vsr . To 
obtain these three nearest voltage vectors, the region where the space vector voltage 
lies should be determined.
If the reference vector lies in sector 1, the three nearest vectors are determi-
ned by the comparison of the reference angle. If reference angle α < 60°, it lies 
in the first sector, and hence, three nearest voltage vectors are V0, V1, and V2. For  
example, if the reference angle lies in sector 4, the nearest three vectors are V0, V4, 
V5 or V4, V5, V7.
5.2.4 Triangularization algorithm
As explained earlier, due to the inherent fractal structure associated with multilevel 
inverter, the voltage space vector representation of the two-level inverter grows to that 
of higher-level inverters by repeated division of each sector. At every stage, the trian-
gular region is divided into four smaller triangular regions, due to the presence of the 
additional voltage vectors as shown in Fig. 5.6. The three additional voltage vectors

are located at the midpoint of each side of sector. The sectors of higher-level inverter 
can therefore be generated by such repeated triangularization.
The following steps are involved to perform the triangularization
i.	
Determine the sector where the triangularization is to be performed.
ii.	 Determine the midpoints of each side of the sector using Eqs. (5.12) to (5.14). These 
are the coordinates of the three new vectors that will divide the sector into four 
smaller, but similar, triangular regions.
iii.	 Determine the inverter states corresponding to these vectors using Eqs. (5.15) 
to (5.17).
For example, consider region I of the two-level inverter formed by vertices A00, A01, 
and A02. The coordinates of three vertices are (α00, β00), (α01, β01), and (α02, β02), res-
pectively. The coordinates of the three new voltage space vectors located at A1l, A12, 
and A13 as shown in Fig. 5.7 can be obtained from the coordinates of A00, A01, and A02.

Eqs. (5.12) to (5.14) represent the arithmetic procedure used in the proposed 
method for dividing a triangular region (sector) into four similar regions by gene-
rating three additional vectors situated at the midpoints of the sides forming the  
original triangular region. This is referred as the triangularization algorithm. To  
generate sectors of higher-level inverter by progressively dividing sectors of the two-
level inverter, the triangularization algorithm is repeatedly applied. In fractal theory, 
algorithms whose repeated iterations will result in the pattern to grow or evolve 
are referred as iterated function system, the repeated iteration of triangularization 
algorithm will grow the inherent fractal structure in space vector representation of 
multilevel inverters. Therefore, the triangularization algorithm can be viewed as the 
iterated function system for this fractal structure.
5.2.5 Comparison of the reference vector with the centroid
The location of the tip of the reference voltage space vector from among these four 
triangular regions is found by determining the region whose centroid is closest to 
the tip of the reference space vector. The coordinates of the centroid of an equilateral 
triangle can be determined as the average of coordinates of the three vertices. For an 
equilateral triangle with the coordinates of the vertices as (α1, β1), (α2, β2), (α3, β3), the 
coordinates of the centroid (αcent, βcent) is given by
	
αcent = 1
3(α1 + α2 + α3)
	
βcent = 1
3(β1 + β2 + β3).	
(5.18)
The triangle with the centroid closest to the tip of the reference space vector is ΔA11, A12 AI3. 
The triangularization algorithm has to be applied again in case of the five-level inverter. 
The application of Eqs. (5.12) to (5.14) to ΔA11A12A13 will generate further three new voltage 
space vectors A23, A25, A26 and also the inverter states corresponding to these new voltage 
vectors. Thus, the three-level inverter space vector diagram is further divided into four 
smaller triangles for a five-level inverter space vector diagram, as shown in Fig. 5.9.

 5 Space vector pulse width modulation for multilevel inverters using fractal approach
From these four triangles, one triangle enclosing the reference space vector is chosen 
such that its centroid is closest to the tip of the reference space vector. The sector is 
identified and the inverter states corresponding to the switching vectors located at the 
vertices of the identified sector are also generated simultaneously.
5.2.6 Calculation of switching times
The switching time durations are calculated, taking the basic two-level timings into 
consideration, as these can be extended to the N-level. The switching voltage vectors 
approximate the volt-second of the reference space vector by operating for specific 
durations. The determination of duration of operation of the switching voltage space 
vectors is simplified by mapping the sector that is identified to enclose the reference 
space vector to a sector of the two-level inverter.
The switching time durations of the vectors can be determined using the following 
formulae from Eqs. (5.19) to (5.22).

5.2.7 Concept of virtual zero
According to the magnitude of the voltage vectors, they are divided into four groups: 
zero-voltage vectors (ZVV), small-voltage vectors (SVVs), middle-voltage vectors 
(MVV), and large-voltage vectors (LVV). Both ZVVs and SVVs have redundant swit-
ching states. The mapping is done by choosing one of the three vectors of the iden-
tified sector to coincide with the actual zero vectors in the voltage space vector 
representation of the inverter. In the present work, the vector selected to coincide 
with the actual zero vector is referred to as the virtual zero vector. The vector with the 
minimum value for the sum of the magnitudes of the α and β coordinates is chosen to 
be the virtual zero vector for a particular sector. The sum of the magnitudes of the α 
and β coordinates represents the total offset of the vector from the actual zero vector. 
Therefore, in the present work, the virtual zero vectors chosen are at minimum offset 
from the zero vectors.
5.3 Algorithm implementation for the three-level inverter
This section explains the proposed method for generation of SVPWM for the three-
level inverter using the inherent fractal structure associated with the switching space 
vector representation of multilevel inverter.
5.3.1 Determination of switching vectors
The process of obtaining the reference space vector includes the transformation 
of (a, b, c) to (d, q) coordinates. Sector identification determines the triangle that 
encloses the tip of the reference space vector. The vertices of the triangle represent 
the locations of switching voltage space vectors used to synthesize the reference 
space vector.
The (d, q) components of the space vector of an N-level inverter can be norma-
lized through division by Vdc/N – 1, where Vdc is the dc-link voltage. In the case of a 
three-level inverter, the voltage Vdc, in the normalized space vector representation is 
therefore represented by a vector of length 2 as shown in Fig. 5.10.
For a three-level inverter, the switching vectors located at the six vertices of the 
hexagon forming the periphery are same as the vectors of equivalent two-level inver-
ter, but they have the switching states as (200), (220), (020), (022), (002), (202).
The position of the reference space vector A00P for a three-level inverter is as 
shown in Fig. 5.11. The first step in the proposed sector identification method is to 
determine the location of the tip of the reference space vector A00P from among the 
six regions of the equivalent two-level inverter. This step is implemented by the com-
parison of the instantaneous reference phase voltages. In this case, the reference

space vector A00P is located in region I of the equivalent two-level inverter. Region I is 
formed by the vertices A00, A01, and A02. The coordinates of the vertices are (0,0), (2,0), 
and (1,1.732), respectively. The switching states corresponding to the vectors located 
at A00, A01, and A02 are also shown in Fig. 5.11(a). The switching states of the vector 
located at A00, A01, and A02 are (000, 111, 222), (200), and (220), respectively. The next 
step is to divide region I into four smaller triangular regions by applying the triangu-
larization algorithm, which will generate the coordinates of the new voltage space 
vectors and the inverter states corresponding to these new switching vectors. The 
three new voltage space vectors divide region I into four smaller triangular regions 
marked R1, R2, R3, and R4 as shown in Fig. 5.11(b). Thus, by determining the switching 
states through triangularization algorithm for the three-level inverter, 27 switching 
states and sectors are represented in Fig. 5.12.

5.3.2 Determination of centroid
The location of the tip of the reference voltage space vector A00P among these four 
triangular regions is found by determining the region whose centroid is closest to 
the tip of the reference space vector. The coordinates of the centroid of an equilateral 
triangle can be determined as the average of coordinates of the three vertices. For an 
equilateral triangle with the coordinates of the vertices as (α1, β1), (α2, β2), (α3, β3), the 
coordinates of the centroid (αcent, βcent) can be obtained from Eq. (5.18).
The triangle with the centroid closest to the tip of the reference space vector is 
ΔA11A12A13. From among these four triangles, the triangle enclosing the reference 
space vector A00P is ΔA11A12A13, as its centroid is closest to the tip of the reference 
space vector. The ΔA11, A12, A13 corresponds to sector 8. The sector is identified and 
the inverter states corresponding to the switching vectors located at the vertices of the 
identified sector are also generated simultaneously.
5.3.3 Determination of switching times
The voltage reference vector A00P is identified in sector 8 as shown in Fig. 5.29(b). 
The voltage space vector with the tip located at A12 becomes the virtual zero 
vector for sector 8. Sector 8 thus gets mapped to sector 1 of the three-level inver-
ter. The determination of duration now reduces to that of a two-level inverter, 
since after mapping, one of the vectors of the identified sector coincides with the

zero vectors. The durations of the vectors can be determined as in the case of the 
two-level inverter.
5.3.4 Determination of optimized switching sequence
Once the switching vectors are determined and their respective durations are calcula-
ted, the vectors are to be switched in an optimum sequence such that only one swit-
ching occurs when the inverter changes its state. In the SVPWM technique, optimum 
switching is achieved using the redundant states of the zero vector for alternate swit-
ching cycles. In this chapter, optimum switching is achieved using two redundant 
switching states of the respective virtual zero vector in the alternate cycles. The tip of 
the reference vector A00P is located in sector 8. The switching states corresponding to 
the switching vectors at the vertices of sector 8 with redundancies are A11 (100,211), A12 
(110,221), and A13 (210). For sector 8, the virtual zero vector at A12 has two redundant 
switching states whereas the voltage vectors at A11 has two redundancies and A13 has 
one redundancy. If the redundancy of the virtual zero vector is greater than two, the 
last two redundant switching states are selected for the virtual zero vector. For the 
other two vectors, if redundant states are more than one, the last redundant state is 
selected. In case of the three-level inverter, as the zero vector at A12 has two redundant 
switching states, both of these are selected. As the space vector A11 has more than

one redundant state, the last switching state is selected. As A13 has only one redun-
dant state, it is selected. This strategy of choosing the last two redundant states for 
the virtual zero vector and the last redundant state for the other vectors will achieve 
optimum switching sequence. The selection will result in switching states 110-210-
211-221 for the virtual zero vector. With this switching sequence, only one switching 
occurs as the inverter changes its state.
By following the above procedure of the fractal approach for the three-level inver-
ter, the switching states and switching sequence of a reference vector is generated. 
Considering twelve samples of the reference vector in a single sector, as shown in Fig. 5.13, 
by rotating reference angle from 0° to 360°, a total of 72 samples are obtained. The 
optimized switching sequence for 72 samples is determined and presented in Tab. 5.1.

The dc bus voltage is split into five levels using four dc capacitors, C1, C2, C3, and 
C4. Each capacitor has Vdc/4 V each voltage stress will be limited to one capacitor 
level through clamping diodes. In the five-level inverter, clamping diodes clamped the 
bus voltage into three voltage levels, +Vdc/2, +Vdc/4, 0, –Vdc/4, –Vdc/2. These states are 
defined as 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0, respectively. There are N3 possible states, i.e. 125 states for 
the five-level inverter and it consists of (5 – 1) = 4 capacitors on the dc bus, 2(5 – 1) = 8 
switching devices per phase and 2(5 – 2) = 6 clamping diodes per phase.
5.4.1 Determination of switching vectors
In the case of the five-level inverter, voltage Vdc, in the normalized space vector represen-
tation, is represented by a vector of length 4. The switching vectors located at the six ver-
tices of the hexagon forming the periphery are the same as the vectors of the equivalent 
two-level inverter, but they have switching states (400), (440), (040), (044), (004), (404).

 5 Space vector pulse width modulation for multilevel inverters using fractal approach
The position of the reference space vector A00P for the five-level inverter is as shown 
in Fig. 5.15. The switching states of five-level inverter are shown in Fig. 5.16. The first 
step in the proposed sector identification of this method is to determine the location of 
the tip of the reference space vector A00P from among the six regions of the equivalent 
two-level inverter. Region I is formed by the vertices A00, A01, and A02. The coordinates 
of the vertices are (0,0), (4,0), and (2, 2√3), respectively, as shown in Fig. 5.17. The swit-
ching states of the vector located at A00, A01, and A02 are (000, 111, 222, 333, 444), (400), 
and (440), respectively. The next step is to divide region I into four smaller triangular 
regions by applying the triangularization algorithm and generates the coordinates of 
the new voltage space vectors and the inverter states corresponding to these new swit-
ching vectors. The three new voltage space vectors divide region I into four smaller 
triangular regions marked as R1, R2, R3, and R4 as shown in Fig. 5.17.

5.4.2 Determination of centroids
The location of the tip of the reference voltage space vector A00P among these four tri-
angular regions is found by determining the region whose centroid is closest to the tip 
of the reference space vector. The coordinates of the centroid of an equilateral triangle 
can be determined as the average of coordinates of the three vertices.
The triangle with the centroid closest to the tip of the reference space vector is

corresponding to these new voltage vectors, thus dividing it into four smaller trian-
gles, with ΔA23A25A26 as the triangle enclosing the reference space vector A00P, as its

centroid is closest to the tip of the reference space vector. The ΔA23A25A26 corresponds 
to sector 27 of the five-level inverter. The sector is identified and the inverter states 
corresponding to the switching vectors located at the vertices of the identified sector 
are also generated simultaneously.
5.4.3 Determination of switching times
For the voltage reference vector A00P, the sector identified is sector 27. The voltage 
space vector with tip located at A23 becomes the virtual zero vector for sector 27. Sector 
27 thus gets mapped to sector 1 of the five-level inverter. The determination of dura-
tion now reduces to that of a two-level inverter since after mapping one of the vectors 
of the identified sector coincides with the zero vectors. The durations of the vectors 
can be determined using the conventional two-level inverter.
5.4.4 Determination of optimized switching sequence
The tip of the reference vector A00P is located in sector 27, as shown in Fig. 5.17. The 
switching states corresponding to the switching vectors at the vertices of sector 27 with 
redundancies are A23 (210, 321, 432), A25 (310, 421) and A26 (320, 431). For sector 27, 
the virtual zero vector at A23 has three redundant switching states while the voltage 
vectors at A25 and A26 has two redundancies each. In the present work, if the redun-
dancy of the virtual zero vector is greater than two, the last two redundant switching

states are selected for the virtual zero vector. For the other two vectors, if redundant 
states are more than one, the last redundant state is selected. This strategy of choosing 
the last two redundant states for the virtual zero vector and the last redundant state for 
the other vectors will achieve optimum switching sequence. The selection will result 
in switching states 321–432 for the virtual zero vector. The other vectors have switching 
states 421 and 431. With these states, the switching sequence of inverter for sector 27 is 
321–421–431–432 during a sampling interval and 432–431–421–321 for the subsequent 
sampling interval. Note that only one switching occurs as the inverter changes state.
By following the above procedure of the fractal approach for the five-level inver-
ter, the switching states and switching sequence of a reference vector are generated. 
Considering twelve samples of the reference vector in a single sector, as shown in 
Fig. 5.18 by rotating the reference angle from 0° to 360°, 72 samples are obtained. The 
optimum switching pattern for these 72 samples obtained through implementation of 
fractal approach for the five-level inverter is shown in Tab. 5.2.

used in this method are given in Appendix II. Figures 5.19 and 5.20 show the simulation 
results for the three-level inverter. Figures 5.19 and 5.20 show the process of triangularization 
and rotation of the reference voltage vector of the three-level inverter, respectively. Figure 
5.19 shows the basic SVPWM where the first triangularization was done to locate the refe-
rence voltage vector. Figure 5.20 shows the rotation of the reference voltage vector through 
0° to 360° in the d-q reference frame. From Fig. 5.20, it is clear that the reference vector is 
rotated from 0° to 360°, and by the proposed technique, the sectors are clearly identified, 
when the tip of the reference vector moved from sector 7 to sector 24. As the reference vector 
is changing from one sector to another, the simultaneous switching sequence is given to the 
multilevel inverter.
Figs. 5.21 and 5.22 show the pole voltages and line voltages of the three-level inverter, 
respectively. Figures 5.23 and 5.24 show the phase voltages and gate currents, respectively. 
Figure 5.25 shows the stator currents of the three-level inverter fed induction motor. The 
rotor speed and torque of the three-level inverter fed induction motor are shown in Figs. 5.26

Figures 5.34 and 5.35 show the stator currents of the five-level inverter fed induction motor, 
respectively. The rotor speed and torque of the five-level inverter fed induction motor are 
shown in Figs. 5.36 and 5.37, respectively. The harmonic spectrum of the five-level inverter 
output voltage and the THD are shown in Fig. 5.38. The comparison between the three- and 
five-level inverters with the proposed algorithm is given in Tab. 5.3. These results show that 
the five-level inverter attains a steady-state response faster than the three-level inverter and 
that the torque ripple and the THD are reduced.

5.6 Conclusions
In the field of high-power, high-performance applications, multilevel inverters seem 
to be the most promising alternative. In this chapter, an algorithm for the generation 
of SVPWM for multilevel inverter based on fractals has been proposed and applied 
for three- and five-level inverters. In this method, the switching sequence is determi-
ned without using look-up tables, so the memory of the controller can be saved. The 
switching times of the voltage vectors are calculated at the same manner as two-level 
SVPWM. Thus, the proposed method reduces the execution time of the three- and five-
level SVPWM. The triangularization algorithm is easy to implement, as basic arith-
metic is used. It can also be applied to the SVPWM method for N-level. The obtained 
THDs for the three- and five-level inverters are 5.70% and 3.61%, respectively, which is 
much less, compared with the conventional SVPWM algorithm.

6 Qualitative space vector pulse width modulation 
algorithm for multilevel inverters
In this chapter, a qualitative space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) algorithm 
is proposed and implemented for neutral point-clamped (NPC) multilevel inverter. In 
this method, the duty cycles of the reference voltage vectors are corrected accordingly 
to identify the location of the reference voltage vector in each region. The appropriate 
switching sequence of the region and calculation of the switching ON times for each 
state are estimated. This scheme can be extended to high-level inverters as well. This 
algorithm has been discussed in detail, and results have been presented and analyzed 
for two, three, four, five, six and seven-level inverters. The total harmonic distortion 
(THD) has been calculated, and comparison with lower levels is also presented in this 
chapter.
The conventional SVPWM algorithm and a novel approach for the generation of 
SVPWM for multilevel inverters based on fractals are presented in the previous chap-
ters. However, as the number of level increases, the location of the reference voltage 
vector, optimum switching sequence and dwelling time calculations, and the control 
algorithm become increasingly complex. To improve the performance of multilevel 
inverters, a qualitative SVPWM algorithm is proposed and analyzed in this chapter.
6.1 A qualitative SVPWM algorithm for multilevel inverters
Sector identification can be done using coordinate transformation of the reference 
vector into a two-dimensional coordinate system. The sector can also be determined 
by resolving the reference phase vector along the a, b and c-axes and by repeated 
comparison with discrete phase voltages. After identifying the sector, the voltage 
vectors at the vertices of the sector are to be determined. Once the switching voltage 
space vectors are determined, the switching sequences can be identified using lookup 
tables. The calculations of the duration of the voltage vectors can be simplified by 
mapping the identified sector corresponding to a sector of the two-level inverter. To 
obtain optimum switching, the voltage vectors are to be switched for their respective 
durations, in a sequence such that only one switching occurs as the inverter moves 
from one switching state to another [126].
The duty cycles of the reference voltage vector will be m1, m2, and [1 − (m1 + m2)]. 
The values of m1 and m2 are useful in identifying the region where reference vector is 
located, which is the major problem in the case of multilevel inverters.
In this method, a correction to the duty cycles of the reference vector is applied to 
identify the location of the reference vector easily in each region of a multilevel inverter.  
Once the region is identified, the appropriate switching sequence of the region can

be identified. The ON time period for each state can be calculated with the obtained 
duty cycles.
6.2 Seven-level NPC inverter
The circuit diagram and space vector diagram of seven-level NPC inverter are as 
shown in Figs. 6.1 and 6.2, respectively. In case of the seven-level inverter, six swit-
ches from each phase leg will be ON at any time point to produce predetermined 
output at phases. The possible switching combinations will be 343, with 216 redun-
dant states. SVPWM is quite different from other PWM techniques. With other PWM 
techniques, the inverter can be thought of as three separate stages, which create 
each phase wave form separately. However, the SVPWM treats an inverter as a single 
unit, with each inverter in specific unique state. Modulation is achieved by swit-
ching the state of the inverter. The SVPWM is a digital modulating technique whose 
the objective is to generate PWM load line voltages that are, in average, equal to 
given (or reference) load line voltages. This is done in each sampling period by pro-
perly selecting the switching states of the inverter and calculating the appropriate 
time period for each state. The SVPWM is an advanced and computation-intensive 
PWM method.
The space vector (Vsr) constituted by the pole voltages of inverters Vao, Vbo, and 
Vco with 120° phase displacement can be defined as
	
Vsr = Vao + Vbo exp[j(2π/3)] + Vco exp[(−j(2π/3))].	
(6.1)
The dwelling time periods T1, T2, and T0 are
	
T1 = Vsr × Ts × sin(π/3 −α)
Vdc × sin(π/3)
.	
(6.2)
	
T2 = Vsr × Ts × sin α
Vdc × sin(π/3)
	
(6.3)
	
T0 = Ts −(T1 + T2)	
(6.4)
In multilevel inverters, the reference voltage vector can be reproduced in the average 
sense by switching among the inverter states situated at the vertices, which are in 
closest proximity to it. In the case of the two-level inverter, the identification of 
the reference vector location in a sector is straightforward. However, in a higher-
level inverter, the existence of more than one region in the sector will require addi-
tional mathematical computation to identify the region where the reference vector 
is located. The duty cycles (ON time for each state) will be found by equating the  
volt-seconds of the reference voltage with the nearest three states.

where d1, d2, and d3 are the duty cycles of the nearest voltage vectors V1, V2, and V3 
and m is the voltage reference vector.
6.2.1 Calculation of duty cycles
The vector states at the vertices of each region can be identified from space vector 
diagrams. Consider the space vector diagram of sector 1 of the seven-level inverter, 
shown in Fig. 6.3. The reference vector m3 is located in region 2 of the three-level inver-
ter. m6 and m7 are the reference vectors located in region 21 of the six-level inverter 
and region 29 of the seven-level inverter, respectively. mx1 and mx2 (x = 3 or 6 or 7) are 
projections of the reference vectors onto zero axis and 60° axis (angle θ is made by 
the reference vector from the zero axes, i.e. start sector 1; noted that m3, m6, and m7 
have different angle θ values). The reference vector can be synthesized by sequential 
switching operation of the three nearest switching states (vertices of the region where 
the reference vector is located).
The lengths of new vectors can be found using
	
m1 = m × cos θ −sin θ/3
m2 = 2 × m × sin θ/3

 6 Qualitative space vector pulse width modulation algorithm for multilevel inverters
The values of m1 and m2 for the reference vector in each region can be calculated using 
Eq. (6.6). The duty cycles of the vertices of the reference voltage will be m1, m2, and 
[1 − (m1 + m2)]. For example, with reference to m3 (reference vector in region 2), the  
reference vector can be synthesized by switching vectors V1, V2, and V3. It is impor-
tant to note that the duty cycle for switching state V1 shall be the length of the vector 
joining V3 and V1, whereas m1 is the projection of reference vector m3 from the origin. 
As such, the corrected duty cycle for switching state V1 in the present case would be 
(m1 − 0.167). The length of the vector joining V3 and V2 is m2. As such, the corrected 
duty cycles for the switching states V1, V2, and V3 would be (m1 − 0.167), m2, and  
(0.833 − m1 − m2), respectively.
The values of m1 and m2 are useful in identifying the region where the refe-
rence vector is located, which is the major problem in multilevel inverters. The 
conditions for identifying the reference vector location in each region and the 
corrected duty cycles for each of the level of inverter are shown in Tab 6.1. Once

6.3 Results and discussions
To validate the proposed qualitative SVPWM algorithm for multilevel inverters, 
the simulation studies have been carried out for two, three, four, five, six and 
seven-level inverters. The simulation parameters and specifications of the induc-
tion motor used in this method are given in Appendix III. The results for the  
two-level inverter are shown in Figs. 6.5 to 6.10. The phase voltages and line volta-
ges of the two-level inverter are shown in Figs. 6.5 and 6.6, respectively. The output 
voltage harmonic spectrum and the THD are shown in Fig. 6.7. The stator currents, 
rotor speed, and torque of the two-level inverter fed induction motor are shown 
in Figs. 6.8 to 6.10, respectively. The results for the three-level inverter are shown 
in Figs. 6.11 to 6.16. The phase and line voltages are shown in Figs. 6.11 and 6.12, 
respectively.
The harmonic spectrum of the output voltage and the THD are shown in  
Fig. 6.13. The stator currents, rotor speed, and torque of the three-level inverter 
fed induction motor are shown in Figs. 6.14 to 6.16, respectively. The results of the

four-level inverter are shown in Figs. 6.17 to 6.22. The phase voltages, line volta-
ges, output voltage harmonic spectrum, and THD are shown in Figs. 6.17 to 6.19, 
respectively. The stator currents, rotor speed, and torque of the four-level inverter 
fed induction motor are shown in Figs. 6.20 to 6.22, respectively. The results of the 
five-level inverter are shown in Figs. 6.23 to 6.28. The phase voltages, line volta-
ges, output voltage harmonic spectrum, and THD are shown in Figs. 6.23 to 6.25, 
respectively. The stator currents, rotor speed, and torque of the four-level inverter 
fed induction motor are shown in Figs. 6.26 to 6.28, respectively. The results of the 
six-level inverter are shown in Figs. 6.29 to 6.34. The phase voltages, line voltages, 
output voltage harmonic spectrum, and THD are shown in Figs. 6.29 to 6.31, res-
pectively.
The stator currents, rotor speed, and torque of the four-level inverter fed induc-
tion motor are shown in Figs. 6.32 to 6.34, respectively. The results of the seven-level 
inverter are shown in Figs. 6.35 to 6.40. The phase voltages, line voltages, output 
voltage harmonic spectrum, and THD are shown in Figs. 6.35 to 6.37, respectively. The 
stator currents, rotor speed, and torque of the four-level inverter fed induction motor 
are shown in Figs. 6.38 to 6.40, respectively. From these results, it is observed that as 
the level of the inverter is increased, the THD is decreased, as shown in Tab. 6.3. and 
torque ripples are also greatly reduced.

In this chapter, a qualitative SVPWM algorithm has been proposed and described for 
the three, four, five, six and seven-level inverters. In this proposed scheme, the duty 
cycles of the reference voltage vectors are corrected to identify the location of the ref-
erence voltage vector easily in each region. The appropriate switching sequence of the 
region and dwelling time calculation are also proposed. The results have been pre-
sented and analyzed, which show that the generated voltage spectrum is very much

improved with the increase in the level of inverter. The THD is highly reduced as the 
level of inverter increases. The input current drawn by the induction motor is less dis-
torted as the level of inverter increases. The output voltage THD for the three-, four-, 
five-, six-, and seven-level inverters is 42.48%, 24.99%, 17.05%, 11.57%, 6.71%, and 
4.67%, respectively, which is considerably lower than that of the same inverter using 
the other modulation techniques.

7 Space vector pulse width modulation for multilevel 
inverters using the decomposition method
In this chapter, the space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) algorithm for 
multilevel inverters using the decomposition method is presented. In this method, 
the space vector diagram of the multilevel inverter is decomposed into several 
space vector diagrams of the two-level inverters. The SVPWM algorithm using 
the decomposition method is applied for the seven-level inverter. In this method, 
the space vector diagram of the seven-level inverter is decomposed into six space 
vector diagrams of the four-level inverters. In turn, each of these six space vector 
diagrams of the four-level inverter is decomposed into six space vector diagrams of 
the three-level inverters, and each of these six space vector diagrams of the three-
level inverter is decomposed into six space vector diagrams of the two-level inver-
ters. To proceed with the switching state determination, first, one of these hexagons 
is selected based on the location of the target voltage vector. Second, the original 
voltage reference vector is decremented by the voltage vector that locates the origin 
of the selected two-level hexagon. This then allows the determination of switching 
sequence and calculation of the voltage vector duration to be done in the same 
manner as for a conventional two-level inverter. The proposed method reduces 
the algorithm complexity and execution time. It can be applied to the multilevel 
inverters above the seven-level inverter as well. This method has been explained in 
detail, and results have been presented and analyzed for the three-level, five-level, 
and seven-level inverters.
7.1 Seven-level inverter
Figure 7.1 shows the space vector diagram of the seven-level inverter. The seven-level 
diode clamping inverter diagram is shown in Fig. 7.2. Each leg is composed of six 
upper and lower switches with anti-parallel diodes. Six series dc-link capacitors split 
the dc bus voltage in half, and 36 clamping diodes confine the voltages across the 
switches within the voltages of the capacitors. The necessary conditions for the swit-
ching states for the seven-level inverter are that the dc-link capacitors should not be 
shorted, and the output current should be continuous [98].
The three dc voltages are labeled as Vdc1, Vdc2, and Vdc3 to distinguish them in the 
inverter output, although in most of the cases, Vdc1 = Vdc2 = Vdc3. The phase leg switch 
states required to achieve the seven output levels can be determined by connecting, 
for example, phase leg b to the negative dc bus by triggering all switches in the lower

7.2.1 Basic principle of the decomposition method
The space vector diagram of the multilevel inverter can be divided into different 
forms of subdiagrams in such a manner that the space vector modulation becomes 
simpler and easier to implement. The decomposition method is a simple and fast 
one that divides the space vector diagram of the seven-level inverter, within three 
steps, into several small hexagons, each hexagon being space vector diagram of

Second, the translation of the origin of the reference voltage vector has to be done 
toward the center of the selected hexagon.
7.2.2 First correction of the reference voltage vector
After finding the location of a given reference voltage vector, one hexagon has to be selec-
ted among the six small hexagons that contain the seven-level space vector diagram, as 
shown in Fig. 7.3. There exist some regions that are overlapped by two adjacent small 
hexagons. These regions will be divided equally between the two hexagons, as shown 
in Fig. 7.6. Each hexagon is identified by a number‘s’ defined as given in Tab. 7.2.

7.2.5 Determination of switching times
Once the corrected reference voltage V2* and the corresponding hexagon are deter-
mined, we can apply the conventional two-level SVPWM method to calculate the 
dwelling times; the only difference between the two-level SVPWM and the five-level 
SVPWM is factor 6 appearing at the first two equations, as shown in Eq. (7.1). The 
remaining procedure is implemented like the conventional two-level inverter SVPWM 
method and two level equivalent pulses are obtained.

7.2.6 Switching sequence
This process is implemented by first considering each four-level decomposed space 
vector diagram of seven-level space vector diagram based on the value of s. Second, 
each four-level space vector diagram is further decomposed into 6 three-level space 
vector diagrams. Finally, each three-level space vector diagram is further decomposed 

122 
 7 Space vector pulse width modulation for multilevel inverters using the decomposition method
into 6 two-level space vector diagrams, and the switching states of seven-level space 
vector diagram are changed into its equivalent two-level switching states. The 
optimum sequence of these three states is selected to minimize the total number 
of switching transitions and fully optimize the harmonic profile of the output 
voltage. Note that from the two-level space vector modulation theory, it is well 
known that these sequences should be reversed in the next switching interval for 
minimum harmonic impact.
7.3 Results and discussions
The SVPWM algorithm for multilevel inverters using the decomposition method 
is proposed. In this method, the space vector diagram of multilevel inverter is 
decomposed into several space vector diagrams of the two-level inverters. The 
validity of the proposed method is verified for the three-, five-, and seven-level 
inverters by simulation. The simulation parameters and specifications of induc-
tion motor used in this method are given in Appendix IV. The results of the  
three-level inverter are shown in Figs. 7.10 to 7.16. The pole voltages, phase vol-
tages, and line voltages are shown in Figs. 7.10 to 7.12, respectively. The stator 
currents, rotor speed, and torque of the three-level inverter fed induction motor 
are shown in Figs. 7.13 to 7.15, respectively. The output voltage harmonic spect-
rum and total harmonic distortion (THD) of the three-level inverter are shown 
in Fig. 7.16.
The results of the five-level inverter are shown in Figs. 7.17 to 7.23. The pole 
voltages, phase voltages, and line voltages are shown in Figs. 7.17 to 7.19, respec-
tively. The stator currents, rotor speed, and torque of the five-level inverter fed 
induction motor are shown in Figs. 7.20 to 7.22, respectively. The output voltage 
harmonic spectrum and the THD of the five-level inverter are shown in Fig. 7.23. 
The results of the seven-level inverter are shown in Figs. 7.24 to 7.30. The pole 
voltages, phase voltages, and line voltages are shown in Figs. 7.24 to 7.26, res-
pectively. The stator currents, rotor speed, and torque of the seven-level inverter  
fed induction motor are shown in Figs. 7.27 to 7.29, respectively. The output 
voltage harmonic spectrum and the THD of the five-level inverter are shown 
in Fig. 7.30. The obtained THD for the three-, five-, and seven-level inverters 
is 5.93%, 2.79%, and 1.51%, respectively, which is much less as compared with 
other conventional SVPWM techniques.

 7 Space vector pulse width modulation for multilevel inverters using the decomposition method
7.4 Conclusions
In this chapter, the SVPWM for the multilevel inverter using the decomposition method 
has been proposed and described for a seven-level inverter. In this method, the space 
vector diagram of the multilevel inverter is decomposed into several space vector 
diagrams of the two-level inverter. After decomposition, all the remaining necessary 
procedures for multilevel inverter are done like conventional two-level inverter. The 
dwelling times of the voltage vectors are calculated at the same manner as the two-
level inverter. Thus, the proposed method reduces the algorithm complexity and exe-
cution time. The results are obtained for the three-, five-, and seven-level inverters. 
The obtained THD with the proposed method for the three-, five-, and seven-level 
inverters is 5.93%, 2.79%, and 1.51%, respectively. The phase voltage, torque, speed, 
and current responses are greatly improved.

8 An analytical space vector pulse width modulation 
method for multilevel inverters
In this chapter, an analytical space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) method 
for multilevel voltage source inverter (VSI) is proposed based on the intrinsic rela-
tion between multilevel and two-level SVPWM. In this method, the dwelling time of 
vector calculation is derived from the two-level inverter. Using linear transformation, 
the dwell time of vectors for two-level VSI can be transformed into multilevel VSI.  
A novel classification of voltage vectors is proposed to determine switching pattern of 
PWM sequence and used up to the eleven-level inverter, which can be extended to the 
n-level inverter as well.
8.1 Relation between three- and two-level SVPWMs
The first step of the nearest three vector algorithm is to determine the subsection where the 
reference vector is located, and the second step is to calculate the dwelling times of each 
vector. As the number of inverter levels increases, the subsection becomes very small. In 
this section, an analytical SVPWM algorithm for multilevel inverters is explained.
8.1.1 SVPWM for the two-level inverter
The two-level inverter space vector diagram is shown in Fig. 8.1. The reference voltage 
vector is described as
	
V∗= VA + VB ej 2π
3 + VC ej 4π

(8.9)
The switching times of the three-level inverter can be obtained from the solution of 
Eq. (8.8). Thus, from a linear transformation between two- and three-level inverters, 
the switching times of the three-level inverters can be derived. This method simply 
can be extended to the N-level inverter.
8.2 Switching states and switching sequence
8.2.1 Three-level inverter
The switching states of the three-level inverter can be classified into four groups 
based on their magnitudes and represented by a space vector diagram, as shown in 
Fig. 8.2. They can be classified into zero, small (vertices of inner hexagon), medium 
(mid-points of sides of outer hexagon), and large vectors (vertices of outer hexagon). 
Both the zero and small vectors have redundant switching states.
The space vector diagram of the three-level inverter is divided into six sextants, 
and each sextant is divided into four triangular regions in order to show the vectors 
nearest to the reference. The three-level inverter consists of zero voltage vectors (ZVV), 
lower small voltage vectors (LSVV), upper small voltage vectors (USVV), middle 
voltage vectors (MVV), and large voltage vectors (LVV), as shown in Tab. 8.1.
A new method is proposed for the generation of voltage vector switching pattern. 
The voltage vectors are divided into X and Y groups as shown in Tab. 8.2. If one vector 
belongs to the X group, then the vector with only one level changing in one phase 
belongs to the Y group. Thus, all middle voltage vectors belongs to the X group and all 
large voltage vectors belong to the Y group. The lower small voltage vectors and upper 
small voltage vectors belong to the X and Y groups, respectively. Thus, the output vector 
always alternates between X and Y groups. After odd times varying, the vector reaches 
the other group, and after even times varying, the vector reaches the same group. The 
switching sequence of sections A2, A3 and A4 are shown in Tab. 8.3.

voltage is split into eleven levels using ten dc capacitors, C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, 
C9, and C10. Each capacitor has Vdc/10 V and each voltage stress will be limited to one 
capacitor level through clamping diodes.

8.3 Algorithm for the N-level inverter
The first step is to identify the triangle where the reference voltage vector is located. 
Then the reference voltage vector is synthesized from the vectors that present at the 
vertices of this triangle and the dwell times of these vectors can be calculated. The 
triangle can be defined as a three-dimensional array
	
λ1 = loor[t1,2 × (N −1)]
λ2 = loor[t2,2 × (N −1)]
λ0 = loor[t0,2 × (N −1)] .
	
(8.10)
The following conclusions are made from the space vector diagram of the eleven-level 
inverter shown in Fig. 8.5.
There is only one bit is changed between names of adjacent triangles.
The last bit in each row is the same.
If λ1 + λ2 + λ0 = N − 1, the reference vector is located on vertices of triangle.
If λ1 + λ2 + λ0 = N − 2, the voltage vectors are in the same direction with the voltage 
vectors of the two-level inverter triangle.
If λ1 + λ2 + λ0 = N − 3, the triangle has the opposite direction with the voltage 
vectors of the two-level inverter triangle.
After identifying the triangle where the reference vector is located, the nearest 
three voltage vectors are chosen as the compound reference vector. As shown in 
Fig. 8.6, according to the volt-second balancing principle, the relation of the synthesis 
of the voltage vector to the reference vector is

 8 An analytical space vector pulse width modulation method for multilevel inverters
In N-level inverters, there is a mapping relation between the three nearest vectors used 
to synthesize the vector and the two non-zero vector of the two-level inverter, which is
	
V1 = a1V1,2 + b1V2,2
V2 = a2V1,2 + b2V2,2
V3 = a3V1,2 + b3V2,2. 	
(8.13)
Changing Eq. (8.13) into the matrix and putting it into Eq. (8.12). In complex plane, we 
can obtain the following matrix.

From the solution of these above equations, the dwell time of each vector can be 
obtained. Thus, there is a simple linear mapping relation between the dwell time of 
the vectors of the N-level inverter and the two-level inverter. The positive and negative 
triangles of N-level inverter space vector diagram is as shown in Fig. 8.7

8.3 Algorithm for the N-level inverter

In a triangle, any voltage vector of the N-level inverter can be given as
	
V = ​ 1 
__ 
N ​ {α[100] + β[110] + γ[111]}
Then, the nearest three vectors of positive and negative triangles have the following 
relationship.
	
V1,N =
1
N−1{λ1[100] + λ2[110] + γ[111]}
V2,N =
1
N−1{(λ1 −1)[100] + (λ2 + 1)[110] + γ[111]}
V3,N =
1
N−1{λ1[100] + (λ2 + 1)[110] + γ[111]}
	
(8.18)
The direction and length of the voltage in the N-level inverter are represented by coef-
ficients λ1 and λ2. Parameter γ controls the redundancy vector. The matrix R is the 
voltage vector transform matrix, but the matrix R−1 is the time transition matrix from 
the two-level inverter to the N-level inverter, respectively. These positive triangle tran-
sition matrices are given by

 8 An analytical space vector pulse width modulation method for multilevel inverters
Set the modulation index (M)
Calculate t12, t22, t02 based on the two-level inverter
Determine the voltage parameters λ0, λ1, and λ2
Determine the voltage vectors V1N, V2N, and V3N for the reference voltage vector
Calculate the voltage vector dwell times t1N, t2N and t3N for reference voltage vector
Fig. 8.8: Flowchart of the N-level inverter.
Thus, the analytical SVPWM algorithm for the N-level inverter can be deduced from 
the two-level inverter as shown in Fig. 8.8.
8.4 Results and discussions
The proposed method is verified by designing a model for the N-level inverter and 
simulating for the three-, five-, seven-, nine-, and eleven-level inverters. The simula-
tion parameters and specifications of induction motor used in this method are given 
in Appendix V. Figures 8.9 to 8.14 show the results of the three-level inverter. The 
phase voltages, line voltages, and output voltage total harmonic distortion (THD) are 
shown in Figs. 8.9 to 8.11, respectively. The stator currents, rotor speed, and torque 
of the three-level inverter fed induction motor are shown in Figs. 8.12 to 8.14, res-
pectively. Figures 8.15 to 8.20 show the results of the five-level inverter. The phase 
voltages, line voltages, and output voltage THD are shown in Figs. 8.15 to 8.17, res-
pectively. The stator currents, rotor speed, and torque of the five-level inverter fed 
induction motor are shown in Figs. 8.18 to 8.20, respectively. The seven-level inver-
ter results are shown in Figs. 8.21 to 8.26. The phase voltages, line voltages, and 
output voltage THD are shown in Figs. 8.21 to 8.23, respectively. The stator currents, 
rotor speed, and torque of the seven-level inverter fed induction motor are shown 
in Figs. 8.24 to 8.26, respectively. The results of the nine-level inverter are shown in 
Figs. 8.27 to 8.32 shows the results of the seven-level inverter. The phase voltages, 
line voltages, and output voltage THD are shown in Figs. 8.27 to 8.29, respectively.

The stator currents, rotor speed, and torque of the nine-level inverter fed induction 
motor are shown in Figs. 8.30 to 8.32, respectively. The results of the eleven-level 
inverter are shown in Figs. 8.33 to 8.38. The phase voltages, line voltages, and output 
voltage THD are shown in Figs. 8.33 to 8.35, respectively. The stator currents, rotor 
speed, and torque of the eleven-level inverter fed induction motor are shown in  
Figs. 8.36 to 8.38, respectively.
The line-to-line voltages and harmonic spectra of three-, five-, seven-, nine-, 
and eleven-level inverters are entirely the same as traditional SVPWM algorithm, 
and it shows that as the level of inverter increases the line voltage in a nearly stan-
dard sine wave. The THD, RMS current, and torque ripples decrease as the level of 
inverter increases. A simulation analysis using a higher level showed that it merely 
modifies the level setting number N, indicating that the algorithm is flexible and 
transplantable.

8.5 Conclusions
An analytical SVPWM algorithm for multilevel inverter fed induction motor is based 
on two-level inverter is proposed and described in detail. An intrinsic relationship 
between multilevel and two-level inverters is developed, and using linear transforma-
tion, the switching time of vectors for the two-level inverter can be transformed for the 
multilevel inverter. A novel classification of voltage vectors is proposed to determine 
switching sequence. This method can be extended for the N-level inverter also. The 
results shows that the output voltage THD for the three-, five-, seven-, nine-, and ele-
ven-level inverters is 16.92%, 4.35%, 2.45%, 2.26%, and 2.13%, respectively as shown 
in Tab. 8.7. As the level of the inverter increases, the THD and the torque ripples are 
effectively decreased and the rotor speed is improved.
