PART ONE – Creating a simple dice game 
 
RANDOM NUMBERS/WHILE LOOPS — DICE GAME 
We are going to code a simple dice game and in that way be learning arithmetic 
operations, string operations, random numbers, if-else statements as well as while 
loops. 
INFORMATION 
Develop a game where you have $1000 from the start. You bet fake dollars, you 
throw the dice and either lose the bet or you win and triple your bet. The goal of the 
game is winning as much money as possible and then quit playing the game while on 
top. 
Code a couple of points of the instructions below, then compile and try out your 
program. Then continue on with more coding points. 
INSTRUCTIONS 
• Create a variable named balance and assign the value of 1000. 
• Ask the user to bet. 
• Read the bet into the variable bet. 
• Ask the user for a guess between one and six (and tell the user to guess zero in 
order to quit). Read the guess into the variable guess. 
• If the guess is zero, then quit the game. 
• Pause the game for two seconds. 
• Generate a random number between one and six; put the value in the variable 
dice. 
• Check if the guess matches the dice. 
• If they don’t: subtract the bet from the balance. 
• If they do match: multiply the bet by three and add that to the balance. 
• If the balance is zero, quit the game. 
• If the balance is positive, loop the game to be able to play more rounds. 
• Add some texts in order to better communicate with the user (e.g. ”throwing 
the dice…”, ”congratulations”, ”you lost”, “your balance is…”, etcetera). 
• Add comments to your code in order to better explain the different parts of it.
