About the Author
Greg Harvey has authored tons of computer books, the most recent being 
Excel Workbook For Dummies and Roxio Easy Media Creator 8 For Dummies, 
and the most popular being Excel 2003 For Dummies and Excel 2003 All-in-One 
Desk Reference For Dummies. He started out training business users on how 
to use IBM personal computers and their attendant computer software in the 
rough and tumble days of DOS, WordStar, and Lotus 1-2-3 in the mid-80s of 
the last century. After working for a number of independent training fi rms, 
Greg went on to teach semester-long courses in spreadsheet and database 
management software at Golden Gate University in San Francisco.
His love of teaching has translated into an equal love of writing. For Dummies 
books are, of course, his all-time favorites to write because they enable him 
to write to his favorite audience: the beginner. They also enable him to use 
humor (a key element to success in the training room) and, most delightful of 
all, to express an opinion or two about the subject matter at hand.
Greg received his doctorate degree in Humanities in Philosophy and Religion 
with a concentration in Asian Studies and Comparative Religion last May. 
Everyone is glad that Greg was fi nally able to get out of school before he 
retired.

Introduction
I
’m very proud to present you with Excel 2010 For Dummies, the latest ver-
sion of everybody’s favorite book on Microsoft Office Excel for readers 
with no intention whatsoever of becoming spreadsheet gurus.
Excel 2010 For Dummies covers all the fundamental techniques you need to know 
in order to create, edit, format, and print your own worksheets. In addition to 
showing you around the worksheet, this book also exposes you to the basics of 
charting, creating data lists, and performing data analysis. Keep in mind, though, 
that this book just touches on the easiest ways to get a few things done with 
these features — I don’t attempt to cover charting, data lists, or data analysis 
in the same definitive way as spreadsheets: This book concentrates on spread-
sheets because spreadsheets are what most regular folks create with Excel.
About This Book
This book isn’t meant to be read cover to cover. Although its chapters are 
loosely organized in a logical order (progressing as you might when study-
ing Excel in a classroom situation), each topic covered in a chapter is really 
meant to stand on its own.
Each discussion of a topic briefly addresses the question of what a particular 
feature is good for before launching into how to use it. In Excel, as with most 
other sophisticated programs, you usually have more than one way to do a 
task. For the sake of your sanity, I have purposely limited the choices by usu-
ally giving you only the most efficient ways to do a particular task. Later, if 
you’re so tempted, you can experiment with alternative ways of doing a task. 
For now, just concentrate on performing the task as I describe.
As much as possible, I’ve tried to make it unnecessary for you to remember 
anything covered in another section of the book. From time to time, however, 
you will come across a cross-reference to another section or chapter in the 
book. For the most part, such cross-references are meant to help you get 
more complete information on a subject, should you have the time and inter-
est. If you have neither, no problem. Just ignore the cross-references as if 
they never existed.

Excel 2010 For Dummies 
How to Use This Book
This book is similar to a reference book. You can start by looking up the 
topic you need information about (in either the Table of Contents or the 
index) and then refer directly to the section of interest. I explain most topics 
conversationally (as though you were sitting in the back of a classroom 
where you can safely nap). Sometimes, however, my regiment-commander 
mentality takes over, and I list the steps you need to take to accomplish a 
particular task in a particular section.
What You Can Safely Ignore
When you come across a section that contains the steps you take to get 
something done, you can safely ignore all text accompanying the steps (the 
text that isn’t in bold) if you have neither the time nor the inclination to wade 
through more material.
Whenever possible, I have also tried to separate background or footnote-
type information from the essential facts by exiling this kind of junk to a 
sidebar (look for blocks of text on a gray background). Often, these sections 
are flagged with icons that let you know what type of information you will 
encounter there. You can easily disregard text marked this way. (I’ll scoop 
you on the icons I use in this book a little later.)
Foolish Assumptions
I’m going to make only one assumption about you (let’s see how close I get): 
You have access to a PC (at least some of the time) that is running Windows 
7, Windows Vista, or Windows XP and on which Microsoft Office Excel 2010 
is installed. Having said that, I don’t assume that you’ve ever launched Excel 
2010, let alone done anything with it.
 
This book is intended for users of Microsoft Office Excel 2010. If you’re using 
Excel for Windows version Excel 97 through 2003, the information in this book 
will only confuse and confound you because only Excel 2007 works similar to 
the 2010 version that this book describes.
If you’re working with a version of Excel earlier than Excel 2007, please put 
this book down slowly and pick up a copy of Excel 2003 For Dummies instead.

 Introduction
How This Book Is Organized
This book is organized in six parts (which gives you a chance to see at least 
six of those great Rich Tennant cartoons!). Each part contains two or more 
chapters (to keep the editors happy) that more or less go together (to keep 
you happy). Each chapter is divided further into loosely related sections that 
cover the basics of the topic at hand. However, don’t get hung up on follow-
ing the structure of the book; ultimately, it doesn’t matter whether you find 
out how to edit the worksheet before you learn how to format it, or whether 
you figure out printing before you learn editing. The important thing is that 
you find the information — and understand it when you find it — when you 
need to perform a particular task.
In case you’re interested, a synopsis of what you find in each part follows.
Part I: Getting In on the Ground Floor
As the name implies, in this part I cover such fundamentals as how to start 
the program, identify the parts of the screen, enter information in the work-
sheet, save a document, and so on. If you’re starting with absolutely no 
background in using spreadsheets, you definitely want to glance at the infor-
mation in Chapter 1 to discover the secrets of the Ribbon interface before 
you move on to how to create new worksheets in Chapter 2.
Part II: Editing without Tears
In this part, I show you how to edit spreadsheets to make them look good, 
including how to make major editing changes without courting disaster. 
Peruse Chapter 3 when you need information on formatting the data to 
improve the way it appears in the worksheet. See Chapter 4 for rearranging, 
deleting, or inserting new information in the worksheet. Read Chapter 5 for 
the skinny on printing your finished product.
Part III: Getting Organized 
and Staying That Way
Here I give you all kinds of information on how to stay on top of the data that 
you’ve entered into your spreadsheets. Chapter 6 is full of good ideas on how 
to keep track of and organize the data in a single worksheet. Chapter 7 gives 

4
Excel 2010 For Dummies 
you the ins and outs of working with data in different worksheets in the same 
workbook and gives you information on transferring data between the sheets 
of different workbooks.
Part IV: Digging Data Analysis
This part consists of two chapters. Chapter 8 introduces performing various 
types of what-if analysis in Excel, including setting up data tables with one and 
two inputs, performing goal seeking, and creating different cases with Scenario 
Manager. Chapter 9 introduces Excel’s vastly improved pivot table and pivot 
chart capabilities that enable you to summarize and filter vast amounts of data 
in a worksheet table or data list in a compact tabular or chart format.
Part V: Life beyond the Spreadsheet
In Part V, I explore some of the other aspects of Excel besides the spread-
sheet. In Chapter 10, you find out just how ridiculously easy it is to create 
a chart using the data in a worksheet. In Chapter 11, you discover just how 
useful Excel’s data list capabilities can be when you have to track and orga-
nize a large amount of information. In Chapter 12, you find out about using 
add-in programs to enhance Excel’s basic features, adding hyperlinks to jump 
to new places in a worksheet, to new documents, and even to Web pages, as 
well as how to record macros to automate your work.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
As is the tradition in For Dummies books, the last part contains lists of the top 
ten most useful and useless facts, tips, and suggestions. In this part, you find 
three chapters. Chapter 13 provides my top ten list of the best new features 
in Excel 2010 (and boy was it hard keeping it to just ten). Chapter 14 gives you 
the top ten beginner basics you need to know as you start using this program. 
Chapter 15 gives you the King James Version of the Ten Commandments of 
Excel 2010. With this chapter under your belt, how canst thou goest astray?
Conventions Used in This Book
The following information gives you the lowdown on how things look in this 
book. Publishers call these items the book’s conventions (no campaigning, 
flag-waving, name-calling, or finger-pointing is involved, however).

5
 Introduction
Throughout the book, you’ll find Ribbon command sequences (the name on 
the tab on the Ribbon and the command button you select) separated by a 
command arrow, as in:
Home➪Copy
This shorthand is the Ribbon command that copies whatever cells or graph-
ics are currently selected to the Windows Clipboard. It means that you click 
the Home tab on the Ribbon (if it isn’t displayed already) and then click the 
Copy button (that sports the traditional side-by-side page icon).
Some of the Ribbon command sequences involve not only selecting a com-
mand button on a tab but then also selecting an item on a drop-down menu. 
In this case, the drop-down menu command follows the name of the tab and 
command button, all separated by command arrows, as in:
Formulas➪Calculation Options➪Manual
This shorthand is the Ribbon command sequence that turns on manual recal-
culation in Excel. It says that you click the Formulas tab (if it isn’t displayed 
already) and then click the Calculation Options button followed by the 
Manual drop-down menu option.
Although you use the mouse and keyboard shortcut keys to move your way 
in, out, and around the Excel worksheet, you do have to take some time to 
enter the data so that you can eventually mouse around with it. Therefore, 
this book occasionally encourages you to type something specific into a spe-
cific cell in the worksheet. Of course, you can always choose not to follow the 
instructions. When I tell you to enter a specific function, the part you should 
type generally appears in bold type. For example, =SUM(A2:B2) means 
that you should type exactly what you see: an equal sign, the word SUM, a 
left parenthesis, the text A2:B2 (complete with a colon between the letter-
number combos), and a right parenthesis. You then, of course, have to press 
Enter to make the entry stick.
Occasionally, I give you a hot key combination that you can press in order to 
choose a command from the keyboard rather than clicking buttons on the 
Ribbon with the mouse. Hot key combinations are written like this: Alt+FS or 
Ctrl+S (both of these hot key combos save workbook changes). 
With the Alt key combos, you press the Alt key until the hot key letters appear 
in little squares all along the Ribbon. At that point, you can release the Alt key 
and start typing the hot key letters (by the way, you type all lowercase hot key 
letters — I only put them in caps to make them stand out in the text).

6
Excel 2010 For Dummies 
Hot key combos that use the Ctrl key are of an older vintage and work a little 
bit differently. You have to hold down the Ctrl key while you type the hot key 
letter (though again, type only lowercase letters unless you see the Shift key 
in the sequence, as in Ctrl+Shift+C).
Excel 2010 uses only one pull-down menu (File) and one toolbar (the Quick 
Access toolbar). You open the File pull-down menu by clicking the File tab or 
pressing Alt+F. The Quick Access toolbar with its four buttons appears to the 
immediate right of the File tab.
Finally, if you’re really observant, you may notice a discrepancy in how the 
names of dialog box options (such as headings, option buttons, and check 
boxes) appear in the text and how they actually appear in Excel on your com-
puter screen. I intentionally use the convention of capitalizing the initial let-
ters of all the main words of a dialog box option to help you differentiate the 
name of the option from the rest of the text describing its use.
Icons Used in This Book
The following icons are placed in the margins to point out stuff you may or 
may not want to read.
 
This icon alerts you to nerdy discussions that you may well want to skip (or 
read when no one else is around).
 
This icon alerts you to shortcuts or other valuable hints related to the topic 
at hand.
 
This icon alerts you to information to keep in mind if you want to meet with a 
modicum of success.
 
This icon alerts you to information to keep in mind if you want to avert com-
plete disaster.
Where to Go from Here
If you’ve never worked with a computer spreadsheet, I suggest that, right 
after getting your chuckles with the cartoons, you first go to Chapter 1 and 
find out what you’re dealing with. If you’re someone with some experience 

7
 Introduction
with earlier versions of Excel, I want you to head directly to the section, 
“Migrating to Excel 2010 from Earlier Versions Using Pull-down Menus” in 
Chapter 1, where you find out how to stay calm as you become familiar and, 
yes, comfortable with the Ribbon user interface. 
Then, as specific needs arise (such as, “How do I copy a formula?” or “How 
do I print just a particular section of my worksheet?”), you can go to the 
Table of Contents or the index to find the appropriate section and go right to 
that section for answers.

Part I
Getting In on the 
Ground Floor

In this part . . .
I
n this part, I break down the Excel user interface and 
make sense of the tabs and command buttons you’re 
going to face day after day after day. Of course, it does 
you no good just to know what’s what onscreen; you need 
to be able to use all these bells and whistles (or buttons 
and boxes in this case). Therefore, I also show you how to 
use some of the more prominent buttons and boxes to 
enter your spreadsheet data. From this humble beginning, 
it’s a quick trip to total screen mastery.

Chapter 1
The Excel 2010 User Experience
In This Chapter
▶ Getting familiar with the Excel 2010 program window and Backstage View
▶ Selecting commands from the Ribbon
▶ Customizing the Quick Access toolbar 
▶ Methods for starting Excel 2010
▶ Surfing an Excel 2010 worksheet and workbook
▶ Getting some help with using this program
▶ Quick start for users migrating to Excel 2010 from earlier versions using pull-down menus
T
he Excel 2010 user interface, like Excel 2007, scraps its reliance on a 
series of pull-down menus, task panes, and multitudinous toolbars. 
Instead, it uses a single strip at the top of the worksheet called the Ribbon 
that puts the bulk of the Excel commands you use at your fingertips at all 
times.
Add to the Ribbon a File tab and a Quick Access toolbar — along with a few 
remaining task panes (Clipboard, Clip Art, and Research) — and you end up 
with the handiest way to crunch your numbers, produce and print polished 
financial reports, as well as organize and chart your data. In other words, to 
do all the wonderful things for which you rely on Excel.
Best of all, this new and improved Excel user interface includes all sorts of 
graphical improvements. Foremost is Live Preview that shows you how your 
actual worksheet data would appear in a particular font, table formatting, 
and so on before you actually select it. Additionally, Excel 2010 supports an 
honest to goodness Page Layout View that displays rulers and margins along 
with headers and footers for every worksheet and has a zoom slider at the 
bottom of the screen that enables you to zoom in and out on the spreadsheet 
data instantly. Finally, Excel 2010 is full of pop-up galleries that make spread-
sheet formatting and charting a real breeze, especially in tandem with Live 
Preview.

Part I: Getting In on the Ground Floor 
Excel’s Ribbon User Interface
When you launch Excel 2010, the program opens the first of three new work-
sheets (named Sheet1) in a new workbook file (named Book1) inside a pro-
gram window like the one shown in Figure 1-1.
 
Figure 1-1:

Quick Access toolbar
Worksheet area
Formula bar
Ribbon
Status bar
The Excel program window containing this worksheet of the workbook con-
tains the following components:
 
✓ File tab that when clicked opens the new Backstage View — a menu 
on the left that contains all the document- and file-related commands, 
including Info (selected by default), Save, Save As, Open, Close, Recent, 
New, Print, and Save & Send. Additionally, there’s a Help option with 
add-ins, an Options item that enables you to change many of Excel’s 
default settings, and an Exit option to quit the program.
 
✓ Customizable Quick Access toolbar that contains buttons you can click 
to perform common tasks, such as saving your work and undoing and 
redoing edits.

13
 Chapter 1: The Excel 2010 User Experience
 
✓ Ribbon that contains the bulk of the Excel commands arranged into a 
series of tabs ranging from Home through View.
 
✓ Formula bar that displays the address of the current cell along with the 
contents of that cell.
 
✓ Worksheet area that contains the cells of the worksheet identified by 
column headings using letters along the top and row headings using 
numbers along the left edge; tabs for selecting new worksheets; a hori-
zontal scroll bar to move left and right through the sheet; and a vertical 
scroll bar to move up and down through the sheet.
 
✓ Status bar that keeps you informed of the program’s current mode and 
any special keys you engage, and enables you to select a new worksheet 
view and to zoom in and out on the worksheet.
Going Backstage via File
To the immediate left of the Home tab on the Ribbon right below the Quick 
Access toolbar, you find the File tab.
When you click File, the new Backstage View opens. This view contains a 
menu similar to the one shown in Figure 1-2. When you open the Backstage 
View, the Info option displays at-a-glance stats about the Excel workbook file 
you have opened and active in the program.

options.
 

14
Part I: Getting In on the Ground Floor 
This information panel is divided into two panes. The pane on the left con-
tains large buttons that enable you to modify the workbook’s permissions, 
distribution, and versions. The pane on the right contains a thumbnail of 
the workbook followed by a list of fields detailing the workbook’s various 
Document Properties, some of which you can change (such as Title, Tags, 
Categories, and Author), and many of which you can’t (such as Size, Last 
Modified, Created, and so forth).
Above the Info option, you find the commands (Save, Save As, Open, and 
Close) you commonly need for working with Excel workbook files. Near the 
bottom, the File tab contains a Help option that, when selected, displays a 
Support panel in the Backstage View. This panel contains options for getting 
help on using Excel, customizing its default settings, as well as checking for 
updates to the Excel 2010 program. Below Help, you find options that you can 
select to change the program’s settings, along with an Exit option that you 
can select when you’re ready to close the program.
 
Click the Recent option to continue editing an Excel workbook you’ve worked 
on of late. When you click the Recent option, Excel displays a panel with a list 
of all the workbook files recently opened in the program. To re-open a particu-
lar file for editing, all you do is click its filename in this list.
 
To close the Backstage View and return to the normal worksheet view, you 
can click the File tab a second time or simply press the Escape key.
Bragging about the Ribbon
The Ribbon (shown in Figure 1-3) changes the way you work in Excel 2010. 
Instead of having to memorize (or guess) on which pull-down menu or tool-
bar Microsoft put the particular command you want to use, their designers 
and engineers came up with the Ribbon that shows you the most commonly 
used options needed to perform a particular Excel task.
 
Figure 1-3:

into differ-
ent groups.
 
Tabs
Dialog box launchers
Command buttons
Groups

15
 Chapter 1: The Excel 2010 User Experience
The Ribbon contains the following components:
 
✓ Tabs for each of Excel’s main tasks that bring together and display all 
the commands commonly needed to perform that core task.
 
✓ Groups that organize related command buttons into subtasks normally 
performed as part of the tab’s larger core task.
 
✓ Command buttons within each group that you select to perform a par-
ticular action or to open a gallery from which you can click a particular 
thumbnail. Note: Many command buttons on certain tabs of the Ribbon 
are organized into mini-toolbars with related settings.
 
✓ Dialog box launcher in the lower-right corner of certain groups that 
opens a dialog box containing a bunch of additional options you can 
select.
 
To display more of the Worksheet area in the program window, you can mini-
mize the Ribbon so that only its tabs display. Simply click the Minimize the 
Ribbon button, the first button with what looks like a greater than symbol 
pointing upward in the group of buttons for minimizing, maximizing, and clos-
ing the current worksheet window to the right of the Ribbon tabs and to the 
immediate left of the Help button. You can also double-click any one of the 
Ribbon’s tabs, or just press Ctrl+F1. To redisplay the entire Ribbon, and keep 
all the command buttons on its tabs displayed in the program window, click 
the Expand the Ribbon button, double-click one of the tabs, or press Ctrl+F1 a 
second time.
 
When you work in Excel with the Ribbon minimized, the Ribbon expands each 
time you click one of its tabs to show its command buttons, but that tab stays 
open only until you select one of the command buttons. The moment you 
select a command button, Excel immediately minimizes the Ribbon again and 
just displays its tabs.
Keeping tabs on the Excel Ribbon
The first time you launch Excel 2010, its Ribbon contains the following tabs 
from left to right:
 
✓ Home tab with the command buttons normally used when creating, for-
matting, and editing a spreadsheet, arranged into the Clipboard, Font, 
Alignment, Number, Styles, Cells, and Editing groups.
 
✓ Insert tab with the command buttons normally used when adding par-
ticular elements (including graphics, PivotTables, charts, hyperlinks, 
and headers and footers) to a spreadsheet, arranged into the Tables, 
Illustrations, Charts, Sparklines, Filter, Links, Text, and Symbols groups.
 
✓ Page Layout tab with the command buttons normally used when pre-
paring a spreadsheet for printing or re-ordering graphics on the sheet, 
arranged into the Themes, Page Setup, Scale to Fit, Sheet Options, and 
Arrange groups.

16
Part I: Getting In on the Ground Floor 
 
✓ Formulas tab with the command buttons normally used when 
adding formulas and functions to a spreadsheet or checking a worksheet 
for formula errors, arranged into the Function Library, Defined Names, 
Formula Auditing, and Calculation groups. Note: This tab also contains 
a Solutions group when you activate certain add-in programs, such as 
Analysis ToolPak and Euro Currency Tools. See Chapter 12 for more on 
using Excel add-in programs.
 
✓ Data tab with the command buttons normally used when importing, 
querying, outlining, and subtotaling the data placed into a worksheet’s 
data list, arranged into the Get External Data, Connections, Sort & Filter, 
Data Tools, and Outline groups. Note: This tab also contains an Analysis 
group when you activate add-ins, such as Analysis ToolPak and Solver. 
See Chapter 12 for more on Excel add-ins.
 
✓ Review tab with the command buttons normally used when proofing, 
protecting, and marking up a spreadsheet for review by others, arranged 
into the Proofing, Language, Comments, and Changes groups. Note: 
This tab also contains an Ink group with a sole Start Inking button when 
you’re running Office 2010 on a Tablet PC or a computer equipped with 
a digital ink tablet.
 
✓ View tab with the command buttons normally used when changing the 
display of the Worksheet area and the data it contains, arranged into the 
Workbook Views, Show, Zoom, Window, and Macros groups.
 
In addition to these standard seven tabs, Excel has an eighth, optional 
Developer tab that you can add to the Ribbon if you do a lot of work with 
macros and XML files. See Chapter 12 for more on the Developer tab.
Although these standard tabs are the ones you always see on the Ribbon 
when it displays in Excel, they aren’t the only things that can appear in this 
area. Excel can display contextual tools when you’re working with a particu-
lar object that you select in the worksheet, such as a graphic image you’ve 
added or a chart or PivotTable you’ve created. The name of the contextual 
tools for the selected object appears immediately above the tab or tabs asso-
ciated with the tools.
For example, Figure 1-4 shows a worksheet after you click the embedded 
chart to select it. As you can see, doing this adds the contextual tool called 
Chart Tools to the very end of the Ribbon. The Chart Tools contextual tool 
has its own three tabs: Design (selected), Layout, and Format. Note, too, that 
the command buttons on the Design tab are arranged into groups Type, Data, 
Chart Layouts, Chart Styles, Location, and Mode.
 
The moment you deselect the object (usually by clicking somewhere outside 
the object’s boundaries), the contextual tool for that object and all its tabs 
immediately disappear from the Ribbon, leaving only the regular tabs — 
Home, Insert, Page Layout, Formulas, Data, Review, and View — displayed.

Selecting commands from the Ribbon
The most direct method for selecting commands on the Ribbon is to click the 
tab that contains the command button you want and then click that button in 
its group. For example, to insert a piece of clip art into your spreadsheet, you 
click the Insert tab and then click the Clip Art button to open the Clip Art task 
pane in the Worksheet area.
The easiest method for selecting commands on the Ribbon — if you know 
your keyboard well — is to press the Alt key and then type the sequence of 
letters designated as the hot keys for the desired tab and associated com-
mand buttons.
When you press and release the Alt key, Excel displays the hot keys for all 
the tabs on the Ribbon. When you type one of the Ribbon tab hot keys to 
select it, all the command button hot keys appear along with the hot keys 
for the dialog box launchers (see Figure 1-5). To select a command button or 
dialog box launcher, simply type its hot key letter(s).

18

If you know the old Excel shortcut keys from versions Excel 97 through 2003, 
you can still use them. For example, instead of going through the rigmarole 
of pressing Alt+HC to copy a cell selection to the Office Clipboard and then 
Alt+HV to paste it elsewhere in the sheet, you can still press Ctrl+C to copy 
the selection and then press Ctrl+V when you’re ready to paste it. Note, how-
ever, that when using a hot key combination with the Alt key, you don’t need 
to keep the Alt key depressed while typing the remaining letter(s) as you do 
when using a shortcut key combo with the Ctrl key.
Customizing the Quick Access toolbar
When you start using Excel 2010, the Quick Access toolbar contains only the 
following few buttons:
 
✓ Save to save any changes made to the current workbook using the same 
filename, file format, and location
 
✓ Undo to undo the last editing, formatting, or layout change you made
 
✓ Redo to reapply the previous editing, formatting, or layout change that 
you just removed with the Undo button
The Quick Access toolbar is very customizable because Excel makes it easy 
to add any Ribbon command to it. Moreover, you’re not restricted to adding 
buttons for just the commands on the Ribbon; you can add any Excel com-
mand you want to the toolbar, even the obscure ones that don’t rate an 
appearance on any of its tabs.
 
By default, the Quick Access toolbar appears above the Ribbon tabs immedi-
ately to the right of the Excel program button (used to resize the workbook 
window or quit the program). To display the toolbar beneath the Ribbon 
immediately above the Formula bar, click the Customize Quick Access Toolbar 
button (the drop-down button to the right of the toolbar with a horizontal bar 

19
 Chapter 1: The Excel 2010 User Experience
above a down-pointing triangle) and then click Show Below the Ribbon on 
its drop-down menu. You will definitely want to make this change if you start 
adding more buttons to the toolbar so that the growing Quick Access toolbar 
doesn’t start crowding the name of the current workbook that appears to the 
toolbar’s right.
Adding command buttons on the Customize 
Quick Access Toolbar’s drop-down menu
When you click the Customize Quick Access Toolbar button, a drop-down 
menu appears containing the following commands:
 
✓ New to open a new workbook
 
✓ Open to display the Open dialog box for opening an existing workbook
 
✓ Save to save changes to your current workbook
 
✓ E-mail to open your mail
 
✓ Quick Print to send the current worksheet to your default printer
 
✓ Print Preview to open the Print settings in Backstage View with a pre-
view of the current worksheet in the right pane
 
✓ Spelling to check the current worksheet for spelling errors
 
✓ Undo to undo your latest worksheet edit
 
✓ Redo to reapply the last edit that you removed with Undo
 
✓ Sort Ascending to sort the current cell selection or column in A to 
Z alphabetical order, lowest to highest numerical order, or oldest to 
newest date order
 
✓ Sort Descending to sort the current cell selection or column in Z to 
A alphabetical order, highest to lowest numerical order, or newest to 
oldest date order
When you open this menu, only the Save, Undo, and Redo options are 
selected (indicated by the check marks); therefore, these buttons are the 
only buttons to appear on the Quick Access toolbar. To add any of the other 
commands on this menu to the toolbar, you simply click the option on the 
drop-down menu. Excel then adds a button for that command to the end of 
the Quick Access toolbar (and a check mark to its option on the drop-down 
menu).
To remove a command button that you add to the Quick Access toolbar in 
this manner, click the option a second time on the Customize Quick Access 
Toolbar button’s drop-down menu. Excel removes its command button from 
the toolbar and the check mark from its option on the drop-down menu.

20
Part I: Getting In on the Ground Floor 
Adding command buttons on the Ribbon
To add a Ribbon command to the Quick Access toolbar, simply right-click its 
command button on the Ribbon and then click Add to Quick Access Toolbar 
on its shortcut menu. Excel then immediately adds the command button 
to the very end of the Quick Access toolbar, immediately in front of the 
Customize Quick Access Toolbar button.
If you want to move the command button to a new location on the Quick 
Access toolbar or group it with other buttons on the toolbar, click the 
Customize Quick Access Toolbar button and then click the More Commands 
option near the bottom of its drop-down menu.
Excel then opens the Excel Options dialog box with the Quick Access Toolbar 
tab selected (similar to the one shown in Figure 1-6). On the right side of the 
dialog box, Excel shows all the buttons added to the Quick Access toolbar. 
The order in which they appear from left to right on the toolbar corresponds 
to the top-down order in the list box.
 
Figure 1-6: 
Use the 
buttons on 
the Quick 
Access 
Toolbar tab 
of the Excel 
Options 
dialog box 
to customize 
the appear-
ance of 
the Quick

toolbar.
 
To reposition a particular button on the toolbar, click it in the list box 
on the right and then click either the Move Up button (the one with the 
black triangle pointing upward) or the Move Down button (the one with 

21
 Chapter 1: The Excel 2010 User Experience
the black triangle pointing downward) until the button is promoted or 
demoted to the desired position on the toolbar.
 
You can add vertical separators to the toolbar to group related buttons. To do 
this, click the <Separator> option in the list box on the left and then click the 
Add button twice to add two. Then, click the Move Up or Move Down button 
to position one of the two separators at the beginning of the group and the 
other at the end.
To remove a button added from the Ribbon, right-click it on the Quick Access 
toolbar and then click the Remove from Quick Access Toolbar option on its 
shortcut menu.
Adding non-Ribbon commands to the Quick Access toolbar
You can also use the options on the Quick Access Toolbar tab of the Excel 
Options dialog box (refer to Figure 1-6) to add a button for any Excel com-
mand even if it isn’t one of those displayed on the tabs of the Ribbon:
 
1. Click the type of command you want to add to the Quick Access tool-
bar in the Choose Commands From drop-down list box.
 
 The types of commands include the Popular Commands pull-down menu 
(the default) as well as each of the tabs that appear on the Ribbon. To 
display only the commands that are not displayed on the Ribbon, click 
Commands Not in the Ribbon near the top of the drop-down list. To 
display a complete list of the Excel commands, click All Commands near 
the top of the drop-down list.
 
2. Click the command whose button you want to add to the Quick Access 
toolbar in the list box on the left.
 
3. Click the Add button to add the command button to the bottom of the 
list box on the right.
 
4. (Optional) To reposition the newly added command button so that it 
isn’t the last one on the toolbar, click the Move Up button until it’s in 
the desired position.
 
5. Click the OK button to close the Excel Options dialog box.
 
If you’ve created favorite macros (see Chapter 12) that you routinely use and

Having fun with the Formula bar
The Formula bar displays the cell address (determined by a column letter(s) 
followed by a row number) and the contents of the current cell. For example, 
cell A1 is the first cell of each worksheet at the intersection of column A and 
row 1; cell XFD1048576 is the last cell of each worksheet at the intersection 
of column XFD and row 1048576. The type of entry you make determines 
the contents of the current cell: text or numbers, for example, if you enter 
a heading or particular value, or the details of a formula if you enter a 
calculation.
The Formula bar has three sections:
 
✓ Name box: The left-most section that displays the address of the current 
cell address.
 
✓ Formula bar buttons: The second, middle section that appears as a 
rather nondescript button displaying only an indented circle on the left 
(used to narrow or widen the Name box) and the Insert Function button 
(labeled fx) on the right. When you start making or editing a cell entry, 
Cancel (an X) and Enter (a check mark) buttons appear between them.
 
✓ Cell contents: The third, right-most white area to the immediate right of 
the Insert Function button takes up the rest of the bar and expands as 
necessary to display really long cell entries that won’t fit in the normal 
area.
 
The cell contents section of the Formula bar is important because it always 
shows you the contents of the cell even when the worksheet does not. (When 
you’re dealing with a formula, Excel displays only the calculated result in the 
cell in the worksheet and not the formula by which that result is derived.) 
Additionally, you can edit the contents of the cell in this area at anytime. 
Similarly, when the cell contents area is blank, you know that the cell is empty 
as well.
How you assign 26 letters to 16,384 columns
When it comes to labeling the 16,384 columns 
of an Excel 2010 worksheet, our alphabet with 
its measly 26 letters is simply not up to the task. 
To make up the difference, Excel doubles the 
letters in the cell’s column reference so that 
column AA follows column Z (after which you 
find column AB, AC, and so on) and then triples 
them so that column AAA follows column ZZ 
(after which you get column AAB, AAC, and the 
like). At the end of this letter tripling, the 16,384th 
and last column of the worksheet ends up being 
XFD so that the last cell in the 1,048,576th row 
has the cell address XFD1048576!

23
 Chapter 1: The Excel 2010 User Experience
What to do in the Worksheet area
The Worksheet area is where most of the Excel spreadsheet action takes 
place because it’s the place that displays the cells in different sections of the 
current worksheet and it’s right inside the cells that you do all your spread-
sheet data entry and formatting, not to mention a great deal of your editing.
 
To enter or edit data in a cell, that cell must be current. Excel indicates that a 
cell is current in three ways:
 
✓ The cell cursor — the dark black border surrounding the cell’s entire 
perimeter — appears in the cell.
 
✓ The address of the cell appears in the Name box of the Formula bar.
 
✓ The cell’s column letter(s) and row number are shaded (in a kind of an 
orange-beige color on most monitors) in the column headings and row 
headings that appear at the top and left of the Worksheet area, respectively.
Moving around the worksheet
An Excel worksheet contains far too many columns and rows for all a work-
sheet’s cells to be displayed at one time regardless of how large your per-
sonal computer monitor screen is or how high the screen resolution. (After 
all, we’re talking 17,179,869,184 cells total!) Therefore, Excel offers many 
methods for moving the cell cursor around the worksheet to the cell where 
you want to enter new data or edit existing data:
 
✓ Click the desired cell — assuming that the cell is displayed within the 
section of the sheet visible in the Worksheet area.
 
 Click the Name box, type the address of the desired cell, and then press 
the Enter key.
 
✓ Press F5 to open the Go To dialog box, type the address of the desired 
cell into its Reference text box, and then click OK.
 
✓ Use the cursor keys, as shown in Table 1-1, to move the cell cursor to 
the desired cell.
 
✓ Use the horizontal and vertical scroll bars at the bottom and right edge 
of the Worksheet area to move the part of the worksheet that contains 
the desired cell and then click the cell to put the cell cursor in it.
Keystroke shortcuts for moving the cell cursor
Excel offers a wide variety of keystrokes for moving the cell cursor to a 
new cell. When you use one of these keystrokes, the program automatically 
scrolls a new part of the worksheet into view, if this is required to move the 
cell pointer. In Table 1-1, I summarize these keystrokes, including how far 
each one moves the cell pointer from its starting position.

24
Part I: Getting In on the Ground Floor 
Table 1-1 
Keystrokes for Moving the Cell Cursor
Keystroke
Where the Cell Cursor Moves
→ or Tab
Cell to the immediate right.
← or Shift+Tab
Cell to the immediate left.
↑
Cell up one row.
↓
Cell down one row.
Home
Cell in Column A of the current row.
Ctrl+Home
First cell (A1) of the worksheet.
Ctrl+End or End, Home
Cell in the worksheet at the intersection of the last 
column that has data in it and the last row that has 
data in it (that is, the last cell of the so-called active 
area of the worksheet).
Page Up
Cell one full screen up in the same column.
Page Down
Cell one full screen down in the same column.
Ctrl+→ or End, →
First occupied cell to the right in the same row that is 
either preceded or followed by a blank cell. If no cell 
is occupied, the pointer goes to the cell at the very 
end of the row.
Ctrl+← or End, ←
First occupied cell to the left in the same row that is 
either preceded or followed by a blank cell. If no cell 
is occupied, the pointer goes to the cell at the very 
beginning of the row.
Ctrl+↑ or End, ↑
First occupied cell above in the same column that is 
either preceded or followed by a blank cell. If no cell 
is occupied, the pointer goes to the cell at the very 
top of the column.
Ctrl+↓ or End, ↓
First occupied cell below in the same column that is 
either preceded or followed by a blank cell. If no cell 
is occupied, the pointer goes to the cell at the very 
bottom of the column.
Ctrl+Page Down
The cell pointer’s location in the next worksheet of 
that workbook.
Ctrl+Page Up
The cell pointer’s location in the previous worksheet 
of that workbook.
 
Note: In the case of those keystrokes that use arrow keys, you must either use the arrows on the cursor 
 
keypad or else have the Num Lock disengaged on the numeric keypad of your keyboard. 
 
The keystrokes that combine the Ctrl or End key with an arrow key listed in 
Table 1-1 are among the most helpful for moving quickly from one edge to the 
other in large tables of cell entries or for moving from table to table in a sec-
tion of a worksheet with many blocks of cells.

25
 Chapter 1: The Excel 2010 User Experience
When you use Ctrl and an arrow key to move from edge to edge in a table or 
between tables in a worksheet, you hold down Ctrl while you press one of the 
four arrow keys (indicated by the + symbol in keystrokes, such as Ctrl+→).
When you use End and an arrow-key alternative, you must press and then 
release the End key before you press the arrow key (indicated by the comma 
in keystrokes, such as End, →). Pressing and releasing the End key causes the 
End Mode indicator to appear on the status bar. This is your sign that Excel 
is ready for you to press one of the four arrow keys.
Because you can keep the Ctrl key depressed while you press the different 
arrow keys that you need to use, the Ctrl-plus-arrow-key method provides a 
more fluid method for navigating blocks of cells than the End-then-arrow-key 
method.
 
You can use the Scroll Lock key to “freeze” the position of the cell pointer in 
the worksheet so that you can scroll new areas of the worksheet in view with 
keystrokes, such as PgUp (Page Up) and PgDn (Page Down), without changing 
the cell pointer’s original position. (In essence, making these keystrokes work 
in the same manner as the scroll bars.)
After engaging Scroll Lock, when you scroll the worksheet with the keyboard, 
Excel does not select a new cell while it brings a new section of the work-
sheet into view. To “unfreeze” the cell pointer when scrolling the worksheet 
via the keyboard, you just press the Scroll Lock key again.
Tips on using the scroll bars
To understand how scrolling works in Excel, imagine its humongous work-
sheet as a papyrus scroll attached to rollers on the left and right. To bring 
into view a section of papyrus hidden on the right, you crank the left roller 
until the section with the cells that you want to see appears. Likewise, to 
scroll into view a worksheet section hidden on the left, you crank the right 
roller until the section of cells appears.
You can use the horizontal scroll bar at the bottom of the Worksheet area 
to scroll back and forth through the columns of a worksheet and the verti-
cal scroll bar to scroll up and down through its rows. To scroll a column or 
a row at a time in a particular direction, click the appropriate scroll arrow 
at the ends of the scroll bar. To jump immediately back to the originally dis-
played area of the worksheet after scrolling through single columns or rows 
in this fashion, simply click the area in the scroll bar that now appears in 
front of or after the scroll bar. 
 
You can resize the horizontal scroll bar making it wider or narrower by drag-
ging the button that appears to the immediate left of its left scroll arrow. Just 
keep in mind when working in a workbook that contains a whole bunch of 
worksheets that widening the horizontal scroll bar can hide the display of the 
workbook’s later sheet tabs.

26
Part I: Getting In on the Ground Floor 
 
To scroll very quickly through columns or rows of the worksheet, hold down 
the Shift key and then drag the scroll button in the appropriate direction 
within the scroll bar until the columns or rows that you want to see appear on 
the screen in the Worksheet area. When you hold down the Shift key while you 
scroll, the scroll button within the scroll bar becomes skinny and a ScreenTip 
appears next to the scroll bar, keeping you informed of the letter(s) of the col-
umns or the numbers of the rows that you’re whizzing through.
If your mouse has a wheel, you can use it to scroll directly through the 
columns and rows of the worksheet without using the horizontal or verti-
cal scroll bars. Simply position the white cross mouse pointer in the center 
of the Worksheet area and then hold down the wheel button of the mouse. 
When the mouse pointer changes to a four-pointed arrow with a black dot in 
its center, drag the mouse pointer in the appropriate direction (left and right 
to scroll through columns or up and down to scroll through rows) until the 
desired column or row comes into view in the Worksheet area.
 
The only disadvantage to using the scroll bars to move around is that the 
scroll bars bring only new sections of the worksheet into view — they don’t 
actually change the position of the cell cursor. If you want to start making 
entries in the cells in a new area of the worksheet, you still have to remember 
to select the cell (by clicking it) or the group of cells (by dragging through 
them) where you want the data to appear before you begin entering the data.
Surfing the sheets in a workbook
Each new workbook you open in Excel 2010 contains three blank worksheets, 
each with its own 16,384 columns and 1,048,576 rows (giving you a truly stag-
gering 51,539,607,552 blank cells!). But, that’s not all. If ever you need more 
worksheets in your workbook, you can add them simply by clicking the Insert 
Worksheet button that appears to the immediate right of the last sheet tab 
(see Figure 1-7) or by pressing Shift+F11.

 Chapter 1: The Excel 2010 User Experience
On the left side of the bottom of the Worksheet area, the Sheet Tab scroll but-
tons appear followed by the actual tabs for the worksheets in your workbook 
and the Insert Worksheet button. To activate a worksheet for editing, you 
select it by clicking its sheet tab. Excel lets you know what sheet is active by 
displaying the sheet name in boldface type and making its tab appear on top 
of the others.
 
Don’t forget the Ctrl+Page Down and Ctrl+Page Up shortcut keys for selecting 
the next and previous sheet, respectively, in your workbook.
If your workbook contains too many sheets for all the tabs to display at the 
bottom of the Worksheet area, use the Sheet Tab scroll buttons to bring new 
tabs into view (so that you can then click them to activate them). You click 
the Next Sheet button to scroll the next hidden sheet tab into view or the 
Last Sheet button to scroll the last group of completely or partially hidden 
tabs into view.
Showing off the Status bar
The Status bar is the last component at the very bottom of the Excel program 
window (see Figure 1-8). The Status bar contains the following:
 
✓ Mode indicator that shows the current state of the Excel program 
(Ready, Edit, and so on) as well as any special keys that are engaged 
(Caps Lock, Num Lock, and Scroll Lock).
 
✓ AutoCalculate indicator that displays the average and sum of all the 
numerical entries in the current cell selection along with the count of 
every cell in the selection.
One reason for adding extra sheets to a workbook
You may wonder why anyone would ever need 
more than three worksheets given just how 
many cells each individual sheet contains. 
The truth is that it’s all about how you choose 
to structure a particular spreadsheet rather 
than running out of places to put the data. For 
example, suppose that you need to create a 
workbook that contains budgets for all the 
various departments in your corporation, you 
may decide to devote an individual worksheet 
to each department (with the actual budget 
spreadsheet tables laid out in the same manner 
on each sheet) rather than placing all the tables 
in different sections of the same sheet. Using 
this kind of one-sheet-per-budget layout makes 
it much easier for you to find each budget, print 
each one as a separate page of a report, and, 
if ever necessary, to consolidate the data in a 
separate summary worksheet.

28
Part I: Getting In on the Ground Floor 
 
✓ Layout selector that enables you to select between three layouts for the 
Worksheet area: Normal, the default view that shows only the worksheet 
cells with the column and row headings; Page Layout View that adds 
rulers, page margins, and shows page breaks for the worksheet; and 
Page Break Preview that enables you to adjust the paging of a report. 
(See Chapter 5 for details.)
 
✓ Zoom slider that enables you to zoom in and out on the cells in the 
Worksheet area by dragging the slider to the right or left, respectively.

The Num Lock indicator tells you that you can use the numbers on the numeric 
keypad for entering values in the worksheet. This keypad will most often be 
separate from the regular keyboard (on the right side if you’re using a separate 
keyboard) and embedded in keys on the right side of the keyboard on almost all 
laptop computers where the keyboard is built in to the computer.
Launching and Quitting Excel
Excel 2010 runs under both the older Windows XP operating system and the 
newer Vista and Windows 7 operating systems. Because of changes made to 
the Start menu in Windows Vista and Windows 7, the procedure for starting 
Excel from these versions of Windows is a bit different from Windows XP.
Starting Excel from the Start menu
You can use the Start Search box at the bottom of the Windows Vista Start 
menu or the Search Programs and Files search box on the Windows 7 

29
 Chapter 1: The Excel 2010 User Experience
Start menu to locate Excel on your computer and launch the program in no 
time at all:
 
1. Click the Start button on the Windows taskbar to open the Windows 
Start menu.
 
2. Click the Start menu’s search text box and type the letters exc to have 
Windows locate Microsoft Office Excel 2010 on your computer.
 
3. Click the Microsoft Excel 2010 option that now appears in the left 
Programs column on the Start menu.
If you have more time on your hands, you can also launch Excel from the 
Windows Start menu by going through the rigmarole of clicking Start➪All 
Programs➪Microsoft Office➪Microsoft Excel 2010.
Starting Excel from the Windows 
XP Start menu
When starting Excel 2010 from the Windows XP Start menu, you follow these 
simple steps:
 
1. Click the Start button on the Windows taskbar to open the Windows 
Start menu.
 
2. With the mouse, highlight All Programs on the Start menu and then 
Microsoft Office on the Start continuation menu before clicking the 
Microsoft Excel 2010 option on the Microsoft Office continuation 
menu.
Pinning a Microsoft Excel 2010 option 
on your Windows Start menu
If you use Excel all the time, you may want to make its program option a 
permanent part of the Windows Start menu. To do this, you pin the pro-
gram option to the Start menu (and the steps for doing this are the same in 
Windows XP as they are in Windows Vista and Windows 7):
 
1. Click the Windows Start button and then highlight the All Programs 
option on the Start menu.
 
 Windows XP opens a continuation menu from its Start menu and 
Windows Vista and Windows 7 display a new menu of program options 
on their Start menus.

30
Part I: Getting In on the Ground Floor 
 
2. Highlight the Microsoft Office option on the Windows XP continua-
tion menu or click the Microsoft Office option on the Windows Vista/7 
Start menu.
 
 Windows XP displays a continuation menu with a list of all the Office 
2010 programs installed on your computer. Windows Vista and Windows 7 
display a submenu listing the Office 2010 programs.
 
3. Right-click Microsoft Excel 2010 on the Windows continuation or sub-
menu to open its shortcut menu.
 
4. Click Pin to Start Menu on the shortcut menu.
 
After pinning Excel in this manner, the Microsoft Excel 2010 option always 
appears in the upper section of the left-hand column of the Windows Start 
menu and you can then launch Excel simply by clicking the Windows Start 
button and then clicking this menu option.
 
After you pin the Microsoft Excel 2010 option on to the Windows 7 Start menu, 
whenever you highlight this menu item, Windows 7 automatically expands 
the Start menu to display a list of your recently opened Excel workbook files. 
You can then open one of these files for further editing at the same time you 
launch the Excel 2010 program by clicking its filename on the Start menu.
Adding a Microsoft Excel 2010 shortcut 
to your Windows desktop
Some people prefer having the Excel program icon appear on the Windows 
desktop so that they can launch the program from the desktop by double-
clicking this program icon. To create a Microsoft Excel 2010 program short-
cut for your Windows desktop, you follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Windows Start button and then highlight the All Programs 
option on the Start menu.
 
 Windows XP opens a continuation menu from its Start menu and 
Windows Vista and Windows 7 display a new menu of program options 
on their Start menus.
 
2. Highlight the Microsoft Office option on the Windows XP continua-
tion menu or click the Microsoft Office option on the Windows Vista/
Windows 7 Start menu.
 
 Windows XP displays a continuation menu with a list of all the Office 
2010 programs installed on your computer. Windows Vista and Windows 7 
display a submenu listing the Office 2010 programs.

31
 Chapter 1: The Excel 2010 User Experience
 
3. Right-click Microsoft Excel 2010 on the Windows continuation or sub-
menu to open its shortcut menu.
 
4. Highlight the Send To option on this menu and then click Desktop 
(Create Shortcut) on the continuation shortcut menu.
 
 Windows adds a Microsoft Excel 2010 shortcut icon to your Windows 
desktop that launches the program when you double-click it or right-
click it and then click the Open option.
Adding Excel to the Windows 
Quick Launch toolbar
If you want to be able to launch Excel 2010 by clicking a single button, drag 
the Excel icon for your Windows Vista or Windows XP desktop shortcut to 
the Quick Launch toolbar to the immediate right of the Start button at the 
beginning of the Windows taskbar. When you position the icon on this tool-
bar, Windows indicates where the new Excel button will appear by drawing 
a black, vertical I-beam in front of or between the existing buttons on this 
bar. As soon as you release the mouse button, Windows adds an Excel 2010 
button to the Quick Launch toolbar that enables you to launch the program 
by a single click of its icon.
Pinning an Excel icon to the 
Windows 7 taskbar
If your computer is running Windows 7, you can add a Microsoft Excel 2010 
icon to the taskbar in addition to the standard Internet Explorer, Windows 
Explorer, and Windows Media Player buttons.
All you do is drag and drop the Microsoft Excel 2010 icon that either you 
pinned to the Windows Start menu or you added as a shortcut to the 
Windows desktop into its desired position on the Windows 7 taskbar. (See 
“Pinning a Microsoft Excel 2010 option on your Windows Start menu” and 
“Adding a Microsoft Excel 2010 shortcut to your Windows desktop” earlier in 
this chapter for details.)
 
After pinning a Microsoft Excel 2010 icon to the Windows 7 taskbar, the button 
appears on the Windows taskbar each time you start your computer, and you 
can launch the Excel program simply by single clicking its icon.

32

Exiting Excel
When you’re ready to call it a day and quit Excel, you have several choices 
for shutting down the program:
 
✓ Choose File➪Exit.
 
✓ Press Alt+FX or Alt+F4.
 
✓ Click the Close button (the X) in the upper-right corner of the Excel pro-
gram window. 
If you try to exit Excel after working on a workbook and you haven’t saved 
your latest changes, the program displays an alert box querying whether 
you want to save your changes. To save your changes before exiting, click 
the Save command button. (For detailed information on saving documents, 
see Chapter 2.) If you’ve just been playing around in the worksheet and don’t 
want to save your changes, you can abandon the document by clicking the 
Don’t Save button.
Help Is on the Way
You can get online help with Excel 2010 anytime that you need it while using 
the program. Simply click the Help button (the button with the question mark 
icon to the immediate right of the Minimize the Ribbon button on the right 
side of the program window opposite the Ribbon’s tabs) or press F1 to open 
a separate Excel Help window. (See Figure 1-9.)
When the Excel Help window opens, Excel attempts to use your Internet con-
nection to update its topics. The opening Help window contains links that 
you can click to get information on what’s new in the program.
To get help with a particular command or function, use the Search text box 
at the top of the Excel Help window. Type keywords or a phrase describing 
your topic (such as “print preview” or “printing worksheets”) in this text box 
and then press Enter or click the Search button. The Excel Help window then 
presents a list of links to related help topics that you can click to display the 
information.
 
To print the help topic displayed in the Excel Help window, click the Print 
button (with the printer icon) on its toolbar. Excel then opens a Print dialog 
box where you can select the printer and options to use in printing the 
information.
To display a table of contents with all the main categories and subtopics 
arranged hierarchically, click the Show Table of Contents button (with the 
book icon) on the toolbar.

Migrating to Excel 2010 from Earlier 
Versions Using Pull-down Menus
If you’re a brand new Excel user or have had some experience with Excel 
2007, you’re going to take to Excel 2010’s Ribbon User Interface like a duck to 
water. However, if you’re coming to Excel 2010 as a dedicated user of earlier 
Excel versions (Excel 97 all the way through Excel 2003), the first time you 
launch Excel 2010 and take a gander at the Ribbon, you’re probably going to 
feel more like someone just threw you into the deep end of the pool without a 
life preserver.
 
Don’t panic! Simply use this section of the chapter as your Excel 2010 life 
preserver. It’s intended to get you oriented, keep your head above water, and 
have you swimming with the new interface in no time at all. Just give me five 
minutes of your precious time and I promise I’ll have you up and running with 
Excel 2010 and maybe even smiling again. Now, take a deep breath, and here 
we go. . . .

34
Part I: Getting In on the Ground Floor 
 
First, the bad news: There is no Classic mode in Excel 2010 that will magically 
turn that fat, screen real estate–stealing Ribbon back into those sleek, tried 
and true pull-down menus (thanks Microsoft, I needed that!). After the won-
derful designers and engineers at Microsoft got through dumping all the pull-
down menus and toolbars that you worked so diligently to master and on 
which you relied every Excel workday of your life, there was just nothing left 
for them to hang a Classic mode onto.
Now, for the good news: You really don’t need a Classic mode — you just 
need to find out where those scoundrel engineers went and put all the stuff 
you used to do so effortlessly in versions of Excel before the Ribbon User 
Interface. After all, you already know what most of those pull-down menu 
items and toolbar buttons do; all you have to do is locate them.
Cutting the Ribbon down to size
Want to get that busy Ribbon out of your face? At this point, it’s just taking 
up valuable space and probably making you crazy. So, please double-click 
any one of the tabs or press Ctrl+F1 right now to cut the Ribbon display down 
to only its tabs. Single-clicking a tab then temporarily redisplays the Ribbon 
until you select one of its command buttons, whereas pressing Ctrl+F1 a 
second time redisplays the Ribbon and keeps it open in all its glory.
When only the tabs — Home through View — are showing at the top of 
the Excel program window, you should feel a whole lot more comfortable 
with the screen. The Excel 2010 screen is then as clean and uncluttered, if 
not more, as the earlier version of Excel that you were using with only the 
Quick Access toolbar, Ribbon tabs, and Formula bar displayed above the 
Worksheet area.
Now, you’re probably wondering where those Microsoft engineers moved the 
most important and commonly used pull-down menu commands. Table 1-2 
shows the Excel 2010 equivalents for the menu commands you probably used 
most often in doing your work in the earlier version of Excel. 
 
When a particular command is assigned to one of the tabs on the Ribbon, 
Table 1-2 lists only the tab and command button name without naming the 
group because the group name plays no part in selecting the command. 
For example, the table lists the View➪Header and Footer command as 
Insert➪Header & Footer without regard to the fact that the Header & Footer 
button is part of the Text group on the Insert tab.

For the most part, the pull-down menu commands listed in Table 1-2 are logi-
cally located. The ones that take the most getting used to are the Header & 
Footer and PivotTable/Chart commands that are located on the Insert tab 
rather than the View tab and Data tab as might be expected given they inhab-
ited, respectively, the View and Data pull-down menus in earlier Excel ver-
sions. Additionally, the worksheet background command ended up all by its 
lonesome on the Page Layout tab rather than going to the Home tab with all 
its fellow formatting commands.
Finding the Standard toolbar 
buttons equivalents
If you’re like me, you came to rely heavily on the buttons of the Standard 
toolbar in doing all sorts of everyday tasks in earlier versions of Excel. Table 

40
Part I: Getting In on the Ground Floor 
1-3 shows you the Excel 2010 equivalents for the buttons on the Standard 
toolbar in Excel 2003. As you can see from this table, most of the Standard 
toolbar buttons are regulated to one of these places in Excel 2010:
 
✓ Backstage View activated by clicking the File tab or pressing Alt+F (New, 
Open, Save, Print)
 
✓ Quick Access toolbar (Save, Undo, and Redo)
 
✓ Home tab in the Clipboard group (Cut, Copy, Paste, and Format Painter) 
and Editing group (AutoSum, Sort Ascending, and Sort Descending)

Part I: Getting In on the Ground Floor 
 
Because Excel 2010 supports only a single toolbar (the Quick Access toolbar), 
the Drawing toolbar disappears completely from Excel 2010, thus the Drawing 
button on the Standard toolbar has no equivalent. Most of its main features, 
including clip art, inserting graphics files, and creating diagrams and WordArt 
are now on the Insert tab. Also, Excel 2010 doesn’t have an equivalent to the 
Chart Wizard button on the Standard toolbar because you can create a chart 
in a split-second by clicking the Column, Line, Pie, Bar, Area, Scatter, or Other 
Charts command buttons on the Insert tab (see Chapter 10).
Finding the Formatting toolbar 
buttons equivalents
Finding the Excel 2010 equivalents for the buttons on the Formatting toolbar 
in earlier versions of Excel couldn’t be easier: Every one of the buttons on the 
Formatting toolbar is displayed prominently on the Home tab of the Ribbon. 
They’re all easy to identify because they use the same icons as before and 
are located in the Font, Alignment, or Number group on the Home tab (refer 
to Figure 1-3).
In addition to the Font, Font Size, Bold, Italic, Underline, Borders, Fill Color, 
and Font Color buttons from the Formatting toolbar, the Font group also con-
tains the following two buttons:
 
✓ Increase Font Size button that bumps up the current font size a point
 
✓ Decrease Font Size button that reduces the current font size by a point
In addition to the Left Align, Center, Right Align, Decrease Indent, Increase 
Indent, and Merge & Center buttons, the Alignment group also contains the 
following buttons:
 
✓ Top Align button that vertically aligns the data entered into the current 
cell selection with the top edge of the cell
 
✓ Middle Align button that vertically centers the data entered into the 
current cell selection
 
✓ Bottom Align button that aligns the data entered in the current cell 
selection with the bottom edge of the cell
 
✓ Orientation button that opens a pop-menu of orientation options that 
enable you to change the direction of the text entered into the current 
cell selection (by angling it up or down, converting it to vertical text, or 
rotating it up or down) and open the Alignment tab of the Format Cells 
dialog box
 
✓ Wrap Text button that applies wrap text to the current cell selection so 
that Excel expands the row heights as needed to fit all its text within the 
current column widths

43
 Chapter 1: The Excel 2010 User Experience
In addition to the Percent Style, Comma Style, Increase Decimal, and 
Decrease Decimal buttons from the Formatting toolbar, the Numbers group 
contains the following buttons:
 
✓ Accounting Number Format button that enables you to select among 
several different currency formats from U.S. dollars to Swiss Francs, as 
well as to open the Number tab of the Format Cells dialog box with the 
Accounting number format selected
 
✓ Number Format button that opens a pop-up menu of different number 
options from General through Text, as well as opens the Number tab in the 
Format Cells dialog box when you select its More Number Formats option
Putting the Excel Quick Access toolbar 
to good use during the transition
Figure 1-10 shows you the Excel 2010 program window with the Ribbon mini-
mized and a completely customized Quick Access toolbar moved down so that 
it appears under the tabs and above the Formula bar. This completely custom 
version of the Quick Access toolbar should seem very familiar to you: It con-
tains every button from the Standard and Formatting toolbar in Excel 2003 
with the exception of the Permission, Drawing, Zoom, and Help buttons. The 
Permission button is so esoteric and seldom used that I didn’t bother to add 
it. The Drawing button has no equivalent in Excel 2010. And neither the Zoom 
button nor the Help button is really needed because the Zoom slider that 
enables you to quickly select a new screen magnification percentage always 
displays in the lower-right corner of the Excel 2010 Status bar and the Help 
button always displays on the right side of the bar containing the Ribbon tabs.

44
Part I: Getting In on the Ground Floor 
 
To customize your Quick Access toolbar so that it matches the one shown in 
Figure 1-10 with every button from the Standard and Formatting toolbars 
except the Permission, Drawing, Zoom, and Help buttons, follow these steps: 
 
1. Click the Customize Quick Access Toolbar button at the end of the 
Quick Access toolbar and then click the Show Below the Ribbon 
option.
 
 When filling the Quick Access toolbar with buttons, you need to place 
the bar beneath the Ribbon so that it won’t crowd the name of the cur-
rent workbook file.
 
2. Click the Customize Quick Access Toolbar button again and this time 
click the More Commands option.
 
 Excel opens the Excel Options dialog box with the Quick Access Toolbar 
tab selected. The Customize Quick Access Toolbar list box on the right 
side of this dialog box shows all three of the default buttons in the order 
in which they now appear on the toolbar.
 
3. Click the New option in the Popular Commands list followed by the 
Add button.
 
 Excel adds the New command button at the end of the toolbar indicated 
by the appearance of the New button at the bottom of the list in the 
Customize Quick Access Toolbar list box on the right.
 
4. Click the Move Up button (with the triangle pointing upward) three 
times to move the New button to the top of the Customize Quick 
Access Toolbar list box and the first position on the Quick Access 
toolbar.
 
 The New button is now in front of the Save button on the toolbar.
 
5. Click the Open option in the Popular Commands list box on the left 
and then click the Add button.
 
 Excel inserts the Open button in the Customize Quick Access Toolbar 
list box between the New and the Save buttons, which is exactly where it 
appears on the Standard toolbar.
 
6. Click the Save button in the Customize Quick Access Toolbar list box 
on the right to select this button. Then, click the Quick Print option in 
the Popular Commands list box on the left and click the Add button.
 
 Excel inserts the Quick Print button after the Save button.
 
7. Click the Print Preview button near the bottom of the Popular 
Commands list box and then click the Add button.
 
 Excel inserts the Print Preview button after the Quick Print button in the 
Customize Quick Access Toolbar list box.
 
 Now, you need to add the Spelling and Research buttons. They are 
located on the Review tab in Excel 2010. Before you can add the buttons 
to the Quick Access toolbar, you need to replace Popular Commands 

45
 Chapter 1: The Excel 2010 User Experience
with Review Tab by selecting this option on the Choose Commands 
From drop-down list.
 
8. Click the Choose Commands From drop-down button and then click 
Review Tab in the drop-down list.
 
 Excel now displays all the command buttons on the Review tab of the 
Ribbon in the list box below.
 
9. Add the Spelling and Research buttons from the Review Tab list box 
to the Customize Quick Access Toolbar list box and position them 
so that they appear one after the other following the Print Preview 
button.
 
 Next, you need to add the Cut, Copy, Paste, and Format Painter buttons 
to the Quick Access toolbar. These command buttons are on the 
Home tab.
 
10. Click the Home Tab option in the Choose Commands From drop-down 
list and then add the Cut, Copy, and Paste buttons to the Customize 
Quick Access Toolbar in this order in front of the Undo button.
 
 Note when adding the Paste button that Choose Commands From dis-
plays two Paste buttons. The first is the regular Paste button that was 
on the Standard toolbar. The second is a Paste button with a drop-down 
button that, when clicked, opens a drop-down menu with all the spe-
cial Paste options. You can add either one, although the second Paste 
button with the drop-down menu is much more versatile.
 
11. Click the Format Painter option in the Home Tab list box and then 
click the Add button.
 
 Excel adds the Format Painter button after the Paste button in the 
Customize Quick Access Toolbar list box on the right.
 
12. Click the Redo button in the Customize Quick Access Toolbar list box 
to select its icon, click Insert Tab on the Choose Commands From 
drop-down list, and then add the Insert Hyperlink button to the Quick 
Access toolbar.
 
13. Add the remaining Standard toolbar buttons — AutoSum, Sort 
Ascending, Sort Descending, and Create Chart — to the Quick Access 
toolbar.
 
 The AutoSum, Sort Ascending, and Sort Descending buttons are avail-
able in the Home Tab list box and the Create Chart button (the closest 
thing to the Chart Wizard in Excel 2010) is on the Insert Tab list box.
 
14. Add the buttons on the Formatting toolbar to the Quick Access toolbar 
in the order in which they appear.
 
 The Formatting toolbar contains these tools all found on the Home tab:
 
• Font
 
• Font Size

46
Part I: Getting In on the Ground Floor 
 
• Bold
 
• Italic
 
• Underline
 
• Align Text Left
 
• Center
 
• Align Text Right
 
• Merge & Center
 
• Accounting Number Format (corresponding to the Currency Style 
button)
 
• Percent Style
 
• Comma Style
 
• Increase Decimal
 
• Decrease Decimal
 
• Decrease Indent
 
• Increase Indent
 
• Borders
 
• Fill Color
 
• Font Color
 
15. Click the OK button to close the Excel Options dialog box and return 
to the Excel program window.
 
 Your Quick Access toolbar should now have the same buttons as the 
one shown in Figure 1-10.
 
After adding all the buttons on the Standard and the Formatting toolbars (save 
the Permission button that almost nobody uses, the Drawing button that has 
no equivalent in Excel 2010, and the Zoom and Help buttons that are always 
available in the program window), the Quick Access toolbar fills the entire 
width of the screen on many monitors. If you add extra buttons that can’t fit 
on the single row above the Formula bar, Excel automatically adds a More 
Controls button to the end of the Quick Access toolbar. You then click the 
More Controls button to display a pop-up menu containing the unseen buttons 
of the toolbar.
 
To add vertical separators to divide the buttons into groups, as in the original 
Standard and Formatting toolbars and shown in Figure 1-10, click the 
<Separator> option located at the top of each Choose Commands From list 
box followed by the Add button.

 Chapter 1: The Excel 2010 User Experience
Getting good to go with Excel 2010
The version of the Excel 2010 program window shown in Figure 1-10 with 
the Ribbon minimized to just tabs and the Quick Access toolbar displayed 
above the Formula bar with all but a few of the buttons from the Standard 
and Formatting toolbars is as close as I can get you to any sort of Excel 2003 
Classic mode.
Combine this simplified screen layout with the common shortcut keys (see 
Table 1-2) that you already know and you should be pretty much good to go 
with Excel 2010. Of course, the Ribbon can’t always stay reduced to just its 
tabs. As you find out while you explore the features covered in the remaining 
chapters, there’ll be times when you need the tools (especially in the form of 
those fantastic galleries) that a particular tab has to offer.
The only other issues that should be of any concern to you right now are 
the new Excel 2010 file formats and running all those Excel macros on which 
you’ve come to rely.
Dealing with the new Excel file formats
Yes, it’s true that Excel 2010 naturally saves its workbooks in the XLSX file 
format introduced in Excel 2007 (a format that Microsoft insists is a truly 
“open” XML file format and not at all proprietary as were all the previous 
Excel file formats).
Fortunately, Excel 2010 has no trouble opening any workbook files saved in 
the good old XLS file format used by versions 97 through 2003. More impor-
tantly, the program automatically saves all editing changes you make to 
these files in this original file format.
Therefore, you don’t have a worry in the world when it comes to making 
simple edits to existing spreadsheets with Excel 2010. Simply, open the work-
book file and then make all the necessary changes. When you finish, click the 
Save button on the Quick Access toolbar to save your changes in the good 
old XLS file format that everybody in the office who is still using a previous 
version of Excel can still open, edit, and print. Excel also warns you should 
you ever add a new 2007 or 2010 element to the existing workbook that isn’t 
supported by earlier versions.
The challenge comes when you need to use Excel 2010 to create a brand new 
spreadsheet. The program automatically wants to save all new workbooks 
in its fancy new XLSX file format (see Chapter 2 for a complete rundown on 
this new workbook file format and the pros and cons of using it). If you don’t 
want to save your workbook in this format, you need to remember to click 
the Save as Type drop-down button in the Save As dialog box and then click 
the Excel 97-2003 Workbook (*.xls) option on its drop-down menu before you 
click Save.

48
Part I: Getting In on the Ground Floor 
 
If you work in an office environment where all the workbooks you produce 
with Excel 2010 must be saved in the old Excel 97-2003 format for compatibil-
ity sake, you can change the program’s default Save setting so that the pro-
gram always saves all new workbooks in the old file format. To do this, open 
the Save tab of the Excel Options dialog box (File➪Options➪Save or Alt+FIS) 
and then click Excel 97-2003 Workbook in the Save Files in This Format drop-
down list box before you click OK.
Using your macros
The good news is that Excel 2010 supports the creating and running of 
macros, using the same Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications of earlier ver-
sions. It even enables you to edit these macros in a version of VBA Editor, if 
you’re sufficiently skilled to do so.
The biggest problem with macros comes about if you have a tendency, as I 
do, to map your global macros (the ones you save in the PERSONAL.XLSB 
workbook so that they’re available when working in any Excel workbook) 
onto custom pull-down menus and toolbars. Because Excel 2010 retains only 
the File tab and Quick Access toolbar, none of the custom menus and tool-
bars to which you’ve assigned macros comes over to Excel 2010. Although 
the macros are still a part of their respective workbooks and continue to run, 
you must now run all macros either using keyboard shortcuts you assigned 
to them or via the Macro dialog box (click View➪Macros➪View Macros or 
press Alt+WMV or Alt+F8).
 
You can assign macros to buttons on the Quick Access toolbar and then run 
them by clicking their buttons. The only problem is that all macros you assign 
to this toolbar use the same generic macro button icon so that the only way to 
differentiate the macros is through the ScreenTip that appears when you posi-
tion the mouse over the button.
 
To assign a macro to a generic macro on the Quick Access toolbar,open 
the Quick Access Toolbar tab of the Excel Options dialog box (File➪Options➪
Quick Access Toolbar or Alt+FIQ) and then select Macros in the Choose 
Commands From drop-down list box. Excel then displays the names of all 
the macros in the current workbook (including all global macros saved in 
the PERSONAL.XLSB workbook) in the Choose Commands From list box. To 
assign a macro to a macro button, click its name in this list box and then click 
the Add button. You can then move the macro button to the desired position 
on the Quick Access toolbar with the Move Up and Move Down buttons and, 
if you so desire, make it part of a separate section on the toolbar by adding a 
vertical separator with the <Separator> option before and after its button.

A
fter you know how to launch Excel 2010, it’s time to find out how not to 
get yourself into trouble when actually using it! In this chapter, you find 
out how to put all kinds of information into all those little, blank worksheet 
cells I describe in Chapter 1. Here you find out about the Excel AutoCorrect 
and AutoComplete features and how they can help cut down on errors and 
speed up your work. You also get some basic pointers on other smart ways 
to minimize the drudgery of data entry, such as filling out a series of entries 
with the AutoFill feature and entering the same thing in a bunch of cells all at 
the same time.
After discovering how to fill up a worksheet with all this raw data, you find 
out what has to be the most important lesson of all — how to save all that 
information on disk so that you don’t ever have to enter the stuff again!

Part I: Getting In on the Ground Floor 
So What Ya Gonna Put in That 
New Workbook of Yours?
When you start Excel without specifying a document to open — which is 
what happens when you start the program from the Windows 7, Windows 
Vista, or Windows XP Start menu (refer to Chapter 1) — you get a blank work-
book in a new workbook window. This workbook, temporarily named Book1, 
contains three blank worksheets (Sheet1, Sheet2, and Sheet3). To begin to 
work on a new spreadsheet, you simply start entering information in the first 
sheet of the Book1 workbook window.
The ins and outs of data entry
Here are a few simple guidelines (a kind of data-entry etiquette, if you will) to 
keep in mind when you create a spreadsheet in Sheet1 of your new workbook:
 
✓ Whenever you can, organize your information in tables of data that use 
adjacent (neighboring) columns and rows. Start the tables in the upper-
left corner of the worksheet and work your way down the sheet, rather 
than across the sheet, whenever possible. When it’s practical, separate 
each table by no more than a single column or row.
 
✓ When you set up these tables, don’t skip columns and rows just to 
“space out” the information. In Chapter 3, you see how to place as 
much white space as you want between information in adjacent 
columns and rows by widening columns, heightening rows, and 
changing the alignment.
 
✓ Reserve a single column at the left edge of the table for the table’s 
row headings.
 
✓ Reserve a single row at the top of the table for the table’s column 
headings.
 
✓ If your table requires a title, put the title in the row above the column 
headings. Put the title in the same column as the row headings. You can 
get information on how to center this title across the columns of the 
entire table in Chapter 3.
In Chapter 1, I make a big deal about how big each of the worksheets in a 
workbook is. You may wonder why I’m now on your case about not using 
that space to spread out the data that you enter into it. After all, given all the 
real estate that comes with each Excel worksheet, you’d think conserving 
space would be one of the last things you’d have to worry about.

51
 Chapter 2: Creating a Spreadsheet from Scratch
You’d be 100 percent correct . . . except for one little, itty-bitty thing: Space 
conservation in the worksheet equals memory conservation. You see, while 
a table of data grows and expands into columns and rows in new areas of the 
worksheet, Excel decides that it had better reserve a certain amount of com-
puter memory and hold it open just in case you go crazy and fill that area with 
cell entries. Therefore, if you skip columns and rows that you really don’t need 
to skip (just to cut down on all that cluttered data), you end up wasting com-
puter memory that could store more information in the worksheet.
You must remember this . . .
 
Now you know: The amount of computer memory available to Excel deter-
mines the ultimate size of the spreadsheet you can build, not the total number 
of cells in the worksheets of your workbook. When you run out of memory, 
you’ve effectively run out of space — no matter how many columns and rows 
are still available. To maximize the information you can get into a single work-
sheet, always adopt the “covered wagon” approach to worksheet design by 
keeping your data close together.
Doing the Data-Entry Thing
Begin by reciting (in unison) the basic rule of worksheet data entry. All 
together now:
To enter data in a worksheet, position the cell pointer in the cell where 
you want the data and then begin typing the entry.
Before you can position the cell pointer in the cell where you want the entry, 
Excel must be in Ready mode (look for Ready as the Mode indicator at the 
beginning of the Status bar). When you start typing the entry, however, Excel 
goes through a mode change from Ready to Enter mode (and Enter replaces 
Ready as the Mode indicator).
 
If you’re not in Ready mode, try pressing Esc.
As soon as you begin typing in Enter mode, the characters that you type in a 
cell in the worksheet area simultaneously appear on the Formula bar near the 
top of the screen. Typing something in the current cell also triggers a change 
to the Formula bar because two new buttons, Cancel and Enter, appear 
between the Name box drop-down button and the Insert Function button.

52
Part I: Getting In on the Ground Floor 
As you continue to type, Excel displays your progress on the Formula bar 
and in the active cell in the worksheet (see Figure 2-1). However, the inser-
tion point (the flashing vertical bar that acts as your cursor) displays only at 
the end of the characters displayed in the cell.
 
Figure 2-1: 
What 
you type 
appears 
both in the 
current cell 
and on the

Cancel

After you finish typing your cell entry, you still have to get it into the cell so 
that it stays put. When you do this, you also change the program from Enter 
mode back to Ready mode so that you can move the cell pointer to another 
cell and, perhaps, enter or edit the data there.
To complete your cell entry and, at the same time, get Excel out of Enter 
mode and back into Ready mode, you can click the Enter button on the 
Formula bar, press the Enter key, or press one of the arrow keys (↓, ↑, →, or 
←) to move to another cell. You can also press the Tab key or Shift+Tab keys 
to complete a cell entry.
Now, even though each of these alternatives gets your text into the cell, each 
does something a little different afterward, so please take note:
 
✓ If you click the Enter button (the one with the check mark) on the 
Formula bar, the text goes into the cell, and the cell pointer just stays in 
the cell containing the brand-new entry.
 
✓ If you press the Enter key on your keyboard, the text goes into the cell, 
and the cell pointer moves down to the cell below in the next row.
 
✓ If you press one of the arrow keys, the text goes into the cell, and the 
cell pointer moves to the next cell in the direction of the arrow. Press 
↓, and the cell pointer moves below in the next row just as it does when 
you finish off a cell entry with the Enter key. Press → to move the cell 
pointer right to the cell in the next column; press ← to move the cell 
pointer left to the cell in the previous column; and press ↑ to move the 
cell pointer up to the cell in the next row above.

53
 Chapter 2: Creating a Spreadsheet from Scratch
 
✓ If you press Tab, the text goes into the cell, and the cell pointer moves 
to the adjacent cell in the column on the immediate right (the same as 
pressing the → key). If you press Shift+Tab, the cell pointer moves to the 
adjacent cell in the column on the immediate left (the same as pressing 
the ← key) after putting in the text.
No matter which of the methods you choose when putting an entry in its 
place, as soon as you complete your entry in the current cell, Excel deacti-
vates the Formula bar by removing the Cancel and Enter buttons. Thereafter, 
the data you entered continues to appear in the cell in the worksheet (with 
certain exceptions that I discuss later in this chapter), and every time you 
put the cell pointer into that cell, the data will reappear on the Formula bar 
as well.
If, while still typing an entry or after finishing typing but prior to complet-
ing the entry, you realize that you’re just about to stick it in the wrong cell, 
you can clear and deactivate the Formula bar by clicking the Cancel button 
(the one with the X in it) or by pressing Esc. If, however, you don’t realize 
that you had the wrong cell until after you enter your data there, you have to 
either move the entry to the correct cell (something you find out how to do 
in Chapter 4) or delete the entry (see Chapter 4) and then reenter the data in 
the correct cell.
It Takes All Types
Unbeknownst to you while you go about happily entering data in your 
spreadsheet, Excel constantly analyzes the stuff you type and classifies it into 
one of three possible data types: a piece of text, a value, or a formula.
Getting the Enter key to put the cell 
pointer where you want it
Excel automatically advances the cell pointer 
to the next cell down in the column every time 
you press Enter to complete the cell entry. If 
you want to customize Excel so that pressing 
Enter doesn’t move the cell pointer when the 
program enters your data, or to have it move the 
cell pointer to the next cell up, left, or right, open 
the Advanced tab of the Excel Options dialog 
box (Alt+FIA).
To prevent the cell pointer from moving at all, 
select the After Pressing Enter, Move Selection 
check box to remove its check mark. To have 
the cell pointer move in another direction, click 
the Direction pop-up list box right below and 
then select the new direction you want to use 
(Right, Up, or Left). When you finish changing 
the settings, click OK or press Enter.

54
Part I: Getting In on the Ground Floor 
If Excel finds that the entry is a formula, the program automatically calculates 
the formula and displays the computed result in the worksheet cell (you con-
tinue to see the formula itself, however, on the Formula bar). If Excel is satis-
fied that the entry does not qualify as a formula (I give you the qualifications 
for an honest-to-goodness formula a little later in this chapter), the program 
then determines whether the entry should be classified as text or as a value.
Excel makes this distinction between text and values so that it knows how 
to align the entry in the worksheet. It aligns text entries with the left edge of 
the cell and values with the right edge. Because most formulas work prop-
erly only when they are fed values, by differentiating text from values, the 
program knows which will and will not work in the formulas that you build. 
Suffice to say that you can foul up your formulas but good if they refer to any 
cells containing text where Excel expects values to be.
The telltale signs of text
A text entry is simply an entry that Excel can’t pigeonhole as either a for-
mula or value. This makes text the catchall category of Excel data types. As a 
practical rule, most text entries (also known as labels) are a combination of 
letters and punctuation or letters and numbers. Text is used mostly for titles, 
headings, and notes in the worksheet.
You can tell right away whether Excel has accepted a cell entry as text 
because text entries automatically align at the left edge of their cells. If the 
text entry is wider than the cell can display, the data spills into the neigh-
boring cell or cells on the right, as long as those cells remain blank (see 
Figure 2-2).
 
Figure 2-2: 
Long text 
entries spill 
over into 
neighboring 
blank cells.
 

55
 Chapter 2: Creating a Spreadsheet from Scratch
If, sometime later, you enter information in a cell that contains spillover text 
from a cell to its left, Excel cuts off the spillover of the long text entry (see 
Figure 2-3). Not to worry: Excel doesn’t actually lop these characters off the 
cell entry — it simply shaves the display to make room for the new entry. To 
redisplay the seemingly missing portion of the long text entry, you have to 
widen the column that contains the cell where the text is entered. (To find 
out how to do this, skip ahead to Chapter 3.)

cells to the 
right cut off

How Excel evaluates its values
Values are the building blocks of most of the formulas that you create in 
Excel. As such, values come in two flavors: numbers that represent quantities 
(14 stores or $140,000 dollars) and numbers that represent dates (July 30, 
1995) or times (2 p.m.).
To Excel, text is nothing but a big zero
Use the AutoCalculate indicator to prove to 
yourself that Excel gives all text entries the value 
of 0 (zero). As an example, enter the number 10 
in one cell and then some stupid piece of text, 
such as Excel is like a box of chocolates, in 
the cell directly below. Then drag up so that 
both cells (the one with 10 and the one with 
the text) are highlighted. Take a gander at the 
AutoCalculate indicator on the Status bar, and 
you see that it reads Average: 10, Count: 2, and 
Sum: 10, proving that the text adds nothing to 
the total value of these two cells.

56
Part I: Getting In on the Ground Floor 
You can tell whether Excel has accepted your entry as a value because values 
automatically align at the right edge of their cells. If the value that you enter 
is wider than the column containing the cell can display, Excel automatically 
converts the value to (of all things) scientific notation. To restore a value 
that’s been converted into that weird scientific notation stuff to a regular 
number, simply widen the column for that cell. (Read how in Chapter 3.)
Making sure that Excel’s got your number
When building a new worksheet, you’ll probably spend a lot of your time 
entering numbers, representing all types of quantities from money that you 
made (or lost) to the percentage of the office budget that went to coffee and 
donuts. (You mean you don’t get donuts?)
To enter a numeric value that represents a positive quantity, like the amount 
of money you made last year, just select a cell, type the numbers — for 
example, 459600 — and complete the entry in the cell by clicking the Enter 
button, pressing the Enter key, and so on. To enter a numeric value that rep-
resents a negative quantity, such as the amount of money the office spent on 
coffee and donuts last year, begin the entry with the minus sign or hyphen 
(–) before typing the numbers and then complete the entry. For example, 
–175 (that’s not too much to spend on coffee and donuts when you just made 
$459,600).
If you’re trained in accounting, you can enclose the negative number (that’s 
expense to you) in parentheses. You’d enter it like this: (175). If you go to 
all the trouble to use parentheses for your negatives (expenses), Excel goes 
ahead and automatically converts the number so that it begins with a minus 
sign; if you enter (175) in the Coffee and Donut expense cell, Excel spits back 
–175. (Relax, you can find out how to get your beloved parentheses back for 
the expenses in your spreadsheet in Chapter 3.)
With numeric values that represent dollar amounts, like the amount of money 
you made last year, you can include dollar signs ($) and commas (,) just as 
they appear in the printed or handwritten numbers you’re working from. 
Just be aware that when you enter a number with commas, Excel assigns a 
number format to the value that matches your use of commas. (For more 
information on number formats and how they are used, see Chapter 3.) 
Likewise, when you preface a financial figure with a dollar sign, Excel assigns 
an appropriate dollar-number format to the value (one that automatically 
inserts commas between the thousands).
When entering numeric values with decimal places, use the period as the 
decimal point. When you enter decimal values, the program automatically 
adds a zero before the decimal point (Excel inserts 0.34 in a cell when you 
enter .34) and drops trailing zeros entered after the decimal point (Excel 
inserts 12.5 in a cell when you enter 12.50).

57
 Chapter 2: Creating a Spreadsheet from Scratch
If you don’t know the decimal equivalent for a value that contains a fraction, 
you can just go ahead and enter the value with its fraction. For example, if 
you don’t know that 2.1875 is the decimal equivalent for 23⁄16, just type 2 3/16 
(making sure to add a space between the 2 and 3) in the cell. After complet-
ing the entry, when you put the cell pointer in that cell, you see 23⁄16 in the 
cell of the worksheet, but 2.1875 appears on the Formula bar. As you see in 
Chapter 3, it’s then a simple trick to format the display of 23⁄16 in the cell so 
that it matches the 2.1875 on the Formula bar.
 
If you need to enter simple fractions, such as ¾   or 5⁄8, you must enter them as 
a mixed number preceded by zero; for example, enter 0 3/4 or 0 5/8 (be sure 
to include a space between the zero and the fraction). Otherwise, Excel thinks 
that you’re entering the dates March 4 (3/4) and May 8 (5/8).
When entering in a cell a numeric value that represents a percentage (so 
much out of a hundred), you have this choice:
 
✓ You can either divide the number by 100 and enter the decimal equiva-
lent (by moving the decimal point two places to the left like your teacher 
taught you; for example, enter .12 for 12 percent).
 
✓ You can enter the number with the percent sign (for example, enter 12%).
Either way, Excel stores the decimal value in the cell (0.12 in this example). 
If you use the percent sign, Excel assigns a percentage-number format to the 
value in the worksheet so that it appears as 12%.
How to fix your decimal places (when you 
don’t even know they’re broken)
If you find that you need to enter a whole slew of numbers that use the same 
number of decimal places, you can turn on Excel’s Fixed Decimal setting and 
have the program enter the decimals for you. This feature really comes in 
handy when you have to enter hundreds of financial figures that all use two 
decimal places (for example, for the number of cents).
To fix the number of decimal places in a numeric entry, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Options➪Advanced or press Alt+FIA.
 
 The Advanced tab of the Excel Options dialog box opens.
 
2. Click the Automatically Insert a Decimal Point check box in the 
Editing Options section to fill it with a check mark.
 
 By default, Excel fixes the decimal place two places to the left of the last 
number you type. To change the default Places setting, go to Step 3; oth-
erwise move to Step 4.

58
Part I: Getting In on the Ground Floor 
 
3. (Optional) Type a new number in the Places text box or use the spin-
ner buttons to change the value.
 
 For example, you could change the Places setting to 3 to enter numbers 
with the following decimal placement: 00.000.
 
4. Click OK or press Enter.
 
 Excel displays the Fixed Decimal status indicator on the Status bar to let 
you know that the Fixed Decimal feature is now active.
After fixing the decimal place in numeric values, Excel automatically adds a 
decimal point to any numeric value that you enter using the number of places 
you selected; all you do is type the digits and complete the entry in the cell. 
For example, to enter the numeric value 100.99 in a cell after fixing the deci-
mal point to two places, type the digits 10099 without adding any period 
for a decimal point. When you complete the cell entry, Excel automatically 
inserts a decimal point two places from the right in the number you typed, 
leaving 100.99 in the cell.
When you’re ready to return to normal data entry for numerical values 
(where you enter any decimal points yourself), open the Advanced tab of the 
Excel Options dialog box (Alt+FIA), click the Automatically Insert a Decimal 
Point check box again, this time to clear it, and then click OK or press Enter. 
Excel removes the Fixed Decimal indicator from the Status bar.
Tapping on the old ten-key
You can make the Fixed Decimal feature work even better by selecting the 
block of cells where you want to enter numbers (see “Entries all around the 
block,” later in this chapter) and then pressing Num Lock so that you can 
enter all the data for this cell selection from the numeric keypad (à la ten-key 
adding machine).
Don’t get in a fix over your decimal places!
When the Fixed Decimal setting is on, Excel 
adds a decimal point to all the numeric values 
that you enter. However, if you want to enter 
a number without a decimal point, or one with 
a decimal point in a position different from 
the one called for by this feature, you have to 
remember to type the decimal point (period) 
yourself. For example, to enter the number 1099 
instead of 10.99 when the decimal point is fixed 
at two places, type 1099 followed immediately 
by a period (.) in the cell.
And, for heaven’s sake, please don’t forget 
to turn off the Fixed Decimal feature before 
you work on another worksheet or exit Excel. 
Otherwise, when you intend to enter values, 
such as 20, you’ll end up with 0.2 instead, and 
you won’t have a clue what’s going on!

59
 Chapter 2: Creating a Spreadsheet from Scratch
Using this approach, all you have to do to enter the range of values in each 
cell is type the number’s digits and press Enter on the numeric keypad. Excel 
inserts the decimal point in the proper place while it moves the cell pointer 
down to the next cell. Even better, when you finish entering the last value in a 
column, pressing Enter automatically moves the cell pointer to the cell at the 
top of the next column in the selection.
Look at Figures 2-4 and 2-5 to see how you can make the ten-key method 
work for you. In Figure 2-4, the Fixed Decimal feature is turned on (using the 
default of two decimal places), and the block of cells from B3 through D9 
are selected. You also see that six entries have already been made in cells 
B3 through B8 and a seventh, 30834.63, is about to be completed in cell B9. 
To make this entry when the Fixed Decimal feature is on, you simply type 
3083463 from the numeric keypad.
 
Figure 2-4: 
To enter 
the value 
30834.63 in 
cell B9, type 
3083463 and 
press Enter.
 
In Figure 2-5, check out what happens when you press Enter (on either the 
regular keyboard or the numeric keypad). Not only does Excel automati-
cally add the decimal point to the value in cell B9, but it also moves the cell 
pointer up and over to cell C3 where you can continue entering the values for 
this column.
Entering dates with no debate
At first look, it may strike you a bit odd to enter dates and times as values 
in the cells of a worksheet rather than text. The reason for this is simple, 
really: Dates and times entered as values can be used in formula calculations, 
whereas dates and times entered as text cannot. For example, if you enter 
two dates as values, you can then set up a formula that subtracts the more 
recent date from the older date and returns the number of days between 
them. This kind of thing just couldn’t happen if you were to enter the two 
dates as text entries.

to complete 
the 30834.63 
entry in cell 
B9. Excel 
automati-
cally moves 
the cell 
pointer up 
and over to 
cell C3. 
Excel determines whether the date or time that you type is a value or text 
by the format that you follow. If you follow one of Excel’s built-in date and 
time formats, the program recognizes the date or time as a value. If you don’t 
follow one of the built-in formats, the program enters the date or time as a 
text entry — it’s as simple as that.
Excel recognizes the following time formats:
3 AM or 3 PM
3 A or 3 P (upper- or lowercase a or p — Excel inserts 3:00 AM or 
3:00 PM)
3:21 AM or 3:21 PM (upper- or lowercase am or pm)
3:21:04 AM or 3:21:04 PM (upper- or lowercase am or pm)
15:21
15:21:04
 
Excel isn’t fussy, so you can enter the AM or PM designation in the date in any 
manner — uppercase letters, lowercase letters, or even a mix of the two.
Excel knows the following date formats. (Month abbreviations always use the 
first three letters of the name of the month: Jan, Feb, Mar, and so forth.)
November 6, 2008 or November 6, 08 (appear in cell as 6-Nov-08)
11/6/08 or 11-6-08 (appear in cell as 11/6/2008)
6-Nov-08 or 6/Nov/08 or even 6Nov08 (all appear in cell as 6-Nov-08)
11/6 or 6-Nov or 6/Nov or 6Nov (all appear in cell as 6-Nov)
Nov-06 or Nov/06 or Nov06 (all appear in cell as 6-Nov)

61
 Chapter 2: Creating a Spreadsheet from Scratch
Make it a date in the 21st Century
Contrary to what you might think, when entering dates in the 21st Century, 
you need to enter only the last two digits of the year. For example, to enter 
the date January 6, 2008, in a worksheet, I enter 1/6/08 in the target cell. 
Likewise, to put the date February 15, 2010, in a worksheet, I enter 2/15/10 in 
the target cell.
This system of having to put in only the last two digits of dates in the 21st 
Century works only for dates in the first three decades of the new century 
(2000 through 2029). To enter dates for the years 2030 on, you need to input 
all four digits of the year.
This also means, however, that to put in dates in the first three decades 
of the 20th Century (1900 through 1929), you must enter all four digits of 
the year. For example, to put in the date July 21, 1925, you have to enter 
7/21/1925 in the target cell. Otherwise, if you enter just the last two digits 
(25) for the year part of the date, Excel enters a date for the year 2025 and 
not 1925!
Excel 2010 always displays all four digits of the year in the cell and on the 
Formula bar even when you only enter the last two. For example, if you enter 
11/06/08 in a cell, Excel automatically displays 11/6/2008 in the worksheet 
cell (and on the Formula bar when that cell is current).
Therefore, by looking at the Formula bar, you can always tell when you’ve 
entered a 20th rather than a 21st Century date in a cell even if you can’t keep 
straight the rules for when to enter just the last two digits rather than all 
four. (Read Chapter 3 for information on how to format your date entries so 
that only the last digits display in the worksheet.)
The dating game
Dates are stored as serial numbers that indi-
cate how many days have elapsed from a 
particular starting date; times are stored as 
decimal fractions indicating the elapsed part 
of the 24-hour period. Excel supports two date 
systems: the 1900 date system used by Excel in 
Windows, where January 1, 1900 is the starting 
date (serial number 1) and the 1904 system used 
by Excel for the Macintosh, where January 2, 
1904 is the starting date.
If you ever get a hold of a workbook created 
with Excel for the Macintosh that contains 
dates that seem all screwed up when you open 
the file, you can rectify this problem by opening 
the Advanced tab of the Excel Options dialog 
box (File➪Options➪Advanced or Alt+FIA) and 
then clicking the Use 1904 Date System check 
box in the When Calculating This Workbook 
section before you click OK.

For information on how to perform simple arithmetic operations between the 
dates and time you enter in a worksheet and have the results make sense, see 
the information about dates in Chapter 3.
Fabricating those fabulous formulas!
As entries go in Excel, formulas are the real workhorses of the worksheet. 
If you set up a formula properly, it computes the correct answer when you 
enter the formula into a cell. From then on, the formula stays up to date, 
recalculating the results whenever you change any of the values that the for-
mula uses.
You let Excel know that you’re about to enter a formula (rather than some 
text or a value), in the current cell by starting the formula with the equal sign 
(=). Most simple formulas follow the equal sign with a built-in function, such 
as SUM or AVERAGE. (See the section “Inserting a function into a formula with 
the Insert Function button,” later in this chapter, for more information on 
using functions in formulas.) Other simple formulas use a series of values or 
cell references that contain values separated by one or more of the following 
mathematical operators:
+ (plus sign) for addition
– (minus sign or hyphen) for subtraction
* (asterisk) for multiplication
/ (slash) for division
^ (caret) for raising a number to an exponential power
For example, to create a formula in cell C2 that multiplies a value entered in 
cell A2 by a value in cell B2, enter the following formula in cell C2: =A2*B2.
To enter this formula in cell C2, follow these steps:
 
1. Select cell C2.
 
2. Type the entire formula =A2*B2 in the cell.
 
3. Press Enter.
Or
 
1. Select cell C2.
 
2. Type = (equal sign).
 
3. Select cell A2 in the worksheet by using the mouse or the keyboard.
 
 This action places the cell reference A2 in the formula in the cell (as 
shown in Figure 2-6).

To start the 
formula,

then select

 The asterisk is used for multiplication rather than the × symbol you 
used in school.
 
5. Select cell B2 in the worksheet by using the mouse or the keyboard.
 
 This action places the cell reference B2 in the formula (as shown in 
Figure 2-7).

Part I: Getting In on the Ground Floor 
 
6. Click the Enter button to complete the formula entry while keeping 
the cell pointer in cell C2.
 
 Excel displays the calculated answer in cell C2 and the formula =A2*B2 
in the Formula bar (as shown in Figure 2-8).
 
Figure 2-8: 
Click the 
Enter but-
ton, and 
Excel dis-
plays the 
answer in 
cell C2 while 
the formula 
appears in 
the Formula 
bar above. 
When you finish entering the formula =A2*B2 in cell C2 of the worksheet, 
Excel displays the calculated result, depending on the values currently 
entered in cells A2 and B2. The major strength of the electronic spreadsheet 
is the capability of formulas to change their calculated results automatically 
to match changes in the cells referenced by the formulas.
Now comes the fun part: After creating a formula like the preceding one 
that refers to the values in certain cells (rather than containing those values 
itself), you can change the values in those cells, and Excel automatically 
recalculates the formula, using these new values and displaying the updated 
answer in the worksheet! Using the example shown in Figure 2-8, suppose 
that you change the value in cell B2 from 100 to 50. The moment that you 
complete this change in cell B2, Excel recalculates the formula and displays 
the new answer, 1000, in cell C2.
If you want it, just point it out
The method of selecting the cells you use in a formula, rather than typing 
their cell references, is pointing. Pointing is quicker than typing and reduces 
the risk that you might mistype a cell reference. When you type a cell refer-
ence, you can easily type the wrong column letter or row number and not 
realize your mistake by looking at the calculated result returned in the cell.

 Chapter 2: Creating a Spreadsheet from Scratch
 
If you select the cell that you want to use in a formula either by clicking it or 
moving the cell pointer to it, you have less chance of entering the wrong cell 
reference.
Altering the natural order of operations
Many formulas that you create perform more than one mathematical opera-
tion. Excel performs each operation, moving from left to right, according to 
a strict pecking order (the natural order of arithmetic operations). In this 
order, multiplication and division pull more weight than addition and sub-
traction and, therefore, perform first, even if these operations don’t come 
first in the formula (when reading from left to right).
Consider the series of operations in the following formula:
=A2+B2*C2
If cell A2 contains the number 5, B2 contains the number 10, and C2 contains 
the number 2, Excel evaluates the following formula:
=5+10*2
In this formula, Excel multiplies 10 times 2 to equal 20 and then adds this 
result to 5 to produce the result 25.
If you want Excel to perform the addition between the values in cells A2 and 
B2 before the program multiplies the result by the value in cell C2, enclose 
the addition operation in parentheses as follows:
=(A2+B2)*C2
The parentheses around the addition tell Excel that you want this operation 
performed before the multiplication. If cell A2 contains the number 5, B2 con-
tains the number 10, and C2 contains the number 2, Excel adds 5 and 10 to 
equal 15 and then multiplies this result by 2 to produce the result 30.
In fancier formulas, you may need to add more than one set of parentheses, 
one within another (like the wooden Russian dolls that nest within each 
other) to indicate the order in which you want the calculations to take place. 
When nesting parentheses, Excel first performs the calculation contained in 
the most inside pair of parentheses and then uses that result in further cal-
culations as the program works its way outward. For example, consider the 
following formula:
=(A4+(B4–C4))*D4

66
Part I: Getting In on the Ground Floor 
Excel first subtracts the value in cell C4 from the value in cell B4, adds the 
difference to the value in cell A4, and then finally multiplies that sum by the 
value in D4.
Without the additions of the two sets of nested parentheses, left to its own 
devices, Excel would first multiply the value in cell C4 by that in D4, add the 
value in A4 to that in B4, and then perform the subtraction.
 
Don’t worry too much when nesting parentheses in a formula if you don’t 
pair them properly so that you have a right parenthesis for every left paren-
thesis in the formula. If you do not include a right parenthesis for every left 
one, Excel displays an alert dialog box that suggests the correction needed to 
balance the pairs. If you agree with the program’s suggested correction, you 
simply click the Yes button. However, be sure that you only use parentheses: 
( ). Excel balks at the use of brackets — [ ] — or braces — { } — in a formula 
by giving you an Error alert box.
Formula flub-ups
Under certain circumstances, even the best formulas can appear to have 
freaked out after you get them in your worksheet. You can tell right away that 
a formula’s gone haywire because instead of the nice calculated value you 
expected to see in the cell, you get a strange, incomprehensible message in all 
uppercase letters beginning with the number sign (#) and ending with an excla-
mation point (!) or, in one case, a question mark (?). This weirdness, in the 
parlance of spreadsheets, is as an error value. Its purpose is to let you know 
that some element — either in the formula itself or in a cell referred to by the 
formula — is preventing Excel from returning the anticipated calculated value.
 
When one of your formulas returns one of these error values, an alert indica-
tor (in the form of an exclamation point in a diamond) appears to the left of 
the cell when it contains the cell pointer, and the upper-left corner of the cell 
contains a tiny green triangle. When you position the mouse pointer on this 
alert indicator, Excel displays a brief description of the formula error and adds 
a drop-down button to the immediate right of its box. When you click this 
button, a pop-up menu appears with a number of related options. To access 
online help on this formula error, including suggestions on how to get rid of 
the error, click the Help on This Error item on this pop-up menu.
The worst thing about error values is that they can contaminate other formu-
las in the worksheet. If a formula returns an error value to a cell and a second 
formula in another cell refers to the value calculated by the first formula, the 
second formula returns the same error value, and so on down the line.
After an error value shows up in a cell, you have to discover what caused 
the error and edit the formula in the worksheet. In Table 2-1, I list some error 
values that you might run into in a worksheet and then explain the most 
common causes.

67
 Chapter 2: Creating a Spreadsheet from Scratch
Table 2-1 
Error Values That You May Encounter 
from Faulty Formulas
What Shows Up 
in the Cell
What’s Going On Here?
#DIV/0!
Appears when the formula calls for division by a cell that 
either contains the value 0 or, as is more often the case, is 
empty. Division by zero is a no-no in mathematics.
#NAME?
Appears when the formula refers to a range name (see 
Chapter 6 for info on naming ranges) that doesn’t exist in the 
worksheet. This error value appears when you type the wrong 
range name or fail to enclose in quotation marks some text 
used in the formula, causing Excel to think that the text refers 
to a range name.
#NULL!
Appears most often when you insert a space (where you 
should have used a comma) to separate cell references used 
as arguments for functions.
#NUM!
Appears when Excel encounters a problem with a number in 
the formula, such as the wrong type of argument in an Excel 
function or a calculation that produces a number too large or 
too small to be represented in the worksheet.
#REF!
Appears when Excel encounters an invalid cell reference, 
such as when you delete a cell referred to in a formula or 
paste cells over the cells referred to in a formula.
#VALUE!
Appears when you use the wrong type of argument or opera-
tor in a function, or when you call for a mathematical opera-
tion that refers to cells that contain text entries.
Fixing Those Data Entry Flub-Ups
We all wish we were perfect, but alas, because so few of us are, we are best 
off preparing for those inevitable times when we mess up. When entering 
vast quantities of data, it’s easy for those nasty little typos to creep into your 
work. In your pursuit of the perfect spreadsheet, here are things you can do. 
First, get Excel to correct certain data entry typos automatically when they 
happen with its AutoCorrect feature. Second, manually correct any disgust-
ing little errors that get through, either while you’re still in the process of 
making the entry in the cell or after the entry has gone in.

68
Part I: Getting In on the Ground Floor 
You really AutoCorrect that for me
The AutoCorrect feature is a godsend for those of us who tend to make the 
same stupid typos over and over. With AutoCorrect, you can alert Excel 2010 
to your own particular typing gaffes and tell the program how it should auto-
matically fix them for you.
When you first install Excel, the AutoCorrect feature already knows to auto-
matically correct two initial capital letters in an entry (by lowercasing the 
second capital letter), to capitalize the name of the days of the week, and to 
replace a set number of text entries and typos with particular substitute text.
You can add to the list of text replacements at any time when using Excel. 
These text replacements can be of two types: typos that you routinely make 
along with the correct spelling, and abbreviations or acronyms that you type 
all the time along with their full forms.
To add to the replacements:
 
1. Choose File➪Options➪Proofing or press Alt+FIP and then click the 
AutoCorrect Options button or press Alt+A.
 
 Excel opens the AutoCorrect dialog box shown in Figure 2-9.
 
2. On the AutoCorrect tab in this dialog box, enter the typo or abbrevia-
tion in the Replace text box.
 
3. Enter the correction or full form in the With text box.
 
4. Click the Add button or press Enter to add the new typo or abbrevia-
tion to the AutoCorrect list.
 
5. Click the OK button to close the AutoCorrect dialog box.

Cell editing etiquette
Despite the help of AutoCorrect, some mistakes are bound to get you. How 
you correct them really depends upon whether you notice before or after 
completing the cell entry.
 
✓ If you catch the mistake before you complete an entry, you can delete 
it by pressing your Backspace key until you remove all the incorrect 
characters from the cell. Then you can retype the rest of the entry or the 
formula before you complete the entry in the cell.
 
✓ If you don’t discover the mistake until after you’ve completed the cell 
entry, you have a choice of replacing the whole thing or editing just the 
mistakes.
 
✓ When dealing with short entries, you’ll probably want to take the 
replacement route. To replace a cell entry, position the cell pointer in 
that cell, type your replacement entry, and then click the Enter button 
or press one of the arrow keys.
 
✓ When the error in an entry is relatively easy to fix and the entry is on the 
long side, you’ll probably want to edit the cell entry rather than replace 
it. To edit the entry in the cell, simply double-click the cell or select the 
cell and then press F2.
 
✓ Doing either one reactivates the Formula bar by displaying the Enter 
and Cancel buttons once again and placing the insertion point in the cell 
entry in the worksheet. (If you double-click, the insertion point positions 
itself wherever you click; press F2, and the insertion point positions 
itself after the last character in the entry.)
 
✓ Notice also that the mode indicator changes to Edit. While in this mode, 
you can use the mouse or the arrow keys to position the insertion point 
at the place in the cell entry that needs fixing.
In Table 2-2, I list the keystrokes that you can use to reposition the inser-
tion point in the cell entry and delete unwanted characters. If you want to 
insert new characters at the insertion point, simply start typing. If you want 
to delete existing characters at the insertion point while you type new ones, 
press the Insert key on your keyboard to switch from the normal insert mode 
to overtype mode. To return to normal insert mode, press Insert a second 
time. When you finish making corrections to the cell entry, you must com-
plete the edits by pressing Enter before Excel updates the contents of the 
cell.
 
While Excel is in Edit mode, you must reenter the edited cell contents by 
either clicking the Enter button or pressing Enter. You can use the arrow keys 
as a way to complete an entry only when the program is in Enter mode. When 
the program is in Edit mode, the arrow keys move the insertion point only 
through the entry that you’re editing, not to a new cell.

A tale of two edits: Cell versus Formula bar editing
Excel gives you a choice between editing 
a cell’s contents either in the cell or on the 
Formula bar. Whereas most of the time, editing 
right in the cell is just fine, when dealing with 
really long entries (like humongous formulas 
that go on forever or text entries that take up 
paragraphs), you may prefer to do your editing 
on the Formula bar. This is because Excel 2010 
automatically adds up and down scroll arrow 
buttons to the end of the Formula bar when a 
cell entry is too long to display completely on a 
single row. These scroll arrow buttons enable 
you to display each line of the cell’s long entry 
without expanding the Formula bar (as in earlier 
versions of Excel) and thereby obscuring the 
top part of the Worksheet area.
To edit the contents in the Formula bar rather 
than in the cell itself, click the appropriate 
scroll arrow button to display the line with the 
contents that needs editing and then click the 
I-beam mouse pointer at the place in the text 
or numbers that requires modification to set the 
insertion cursor.

Taking the Drudgery out of Data Entry
Before leaving the topic of data entry, I feel duty-bound to cover some of the 
shortcuts that really help to cut down on the drudgery of this task. These 
data-entry tips include AutoComplete and AutoFill features as well as doing 
data entry in a preselected block of cells and making the same entry in a 
bunch of cells all at the same time.
I’m just not complete without you
The AutoComplete feature in Excel 2010 is not something you can do any-
thing about, just something to be aware of while you enter your data. In an 
attempt to cut down on your typing load, our friendly software engineers at 
Microsoft came up with the AutoComplete feature.
AutoComplete is like a moronic mind reader who anticipates what you might 
want to enter next based on what you just entered. This feature comes into 
play only when you’re entering a column of text entries. (It does not come 
into play when entering values or formulas or when entering a row of text 
entries.) When entering a column of text entries, AutoComplete looks at the 
kinds of entries that you make in that column and automatically duplicates 
them in subsequent rows whenever you start a new entry that begins with 
the same letter as an existing entry.
For example, suppose that I enter Jack Sprat Diet Centers (one of the compa-
nies owned and operated by Mother Goose Enterprises) in cell A2 and then 
move the cell pointer down to cell A3 in the row below and press J (lower-
case or uppercase, it doesn’t matter). AutoComplete immediately inserts the 
remainder of the familiar entry — ack Sprat Diet Centers — in this cell after 
the J, as shown in Figure 2-10.
Now this is great if I happen to need Jack Sprat Diet Centers as the row 
heading in both cells A2 and A3. Anticipating that I might be typing a differ-
ent entry that just happens to start with the same letter as the one above, 
AutoComplete automatically selects everything after the first letter in the 
duplicated entry it inserted (from ack on, in this example). This enables me 
to replace the duplicate text supplied by AutoComplete just by continuing 
to type. For example, after capturing the Excel screen that you see in Figure 
2-10, I entered Jack and Jill Trauma Centers — another of Mother’s compa-
nies — in cell A3.

72
Part I: Getting In on the Ground Floor 
 
Figure 2-10: 
Auto
Complete 
duplicates 
a previous 
entry if you 
start a new 
entry in 
the same 
column that 
begins with 
the same 
letter.
 
If you override a duplicate supplied by AutoComplete in a column by typing 
one of your own (as in my example with changing Jack Sprat Diet Centers to 
Jack and Jill Trauma Centers in cell A3), you effectively shut down its abil-
ity to supply any more duplicates for that particular letter. For instance, in 
my example, after changing Jack Sprat Diet Centers to Jack and Jill Trauma 
Centers in cell A3, AutoComplete doesn’t do anything if I then type J in 
cell A4. In other words, you’re on your own if you don’t continue to accept 
AutoComplete’s typing suggestions.
 
If you find that the AutoComplete feature is really making it hard for you 
to enter a series of cell entries that all start with the same letter but are 
otherwise not alike, you can turn off the AutoComplete feature. Click 
File➪Options➪Advanced or press Alt+FIA to select the Advanced tab of the 
Excel Options dialog box. Then, select the Enable AutoComplete for Cell 
Values check box in the Editing Options section to remove its check mark 
before clicking OK.
Fill ’er up with AutoFill
Many of the worksheets that you create with Excel require the entry of 
a series of sequential dates or numbers. For example, a worksheet may 
require you to title the columns with the 12 months, from January through 
December, or to number the rows from 1 to 100.
Excel’s AutoFill feature makes short work of this kind of repetitive task. All 
you have to enter is the starting value for the series. In most cases, AutoFill 
is smart enough to figure out how to fill out the series for you when you drag 
the fill handle to the right (to take the series across columns to the right) or 
down (to extend the series to the rows below).

73
 Chapter 2: Creating a Spreadsheet from Scratch
 
The AutoFill handle looks like this — + — and appears only when you posi-
tion the mouse pointer on the lower-right corner of the active cell (or the last 
cell, when you’ve selected a block of cells). If you drag a cell selection with 
the white cross mouse pointer rather than the AutoFill handle, Excel simply 
extends the cell selection to those cells you drag through (see Chapter 3). 
If you drag a cell selection with the arrowhead pointer, Excel moves the cell 
selection (see Chapter 4).
When creating a series with the fill handle, you can drag in only one direction 
at a time. For example, you can fill the series or copy the entry to the range 
to the left or right of the cell that contains the initial values, or you can fill 
the series or copy to the range above or below the cell containing the initial 
values. You can’t, however, fill or copy the series to two directions at the same 
time (such as down and to the right by dragging the fill handle diagonally).
While you drag the mouse, the program keeps you informed of whatever 
entry will be entered into the last cell selected in the range by displaying that 
entry next to the mouse pointer (a kind of AutoFill tips, if you will). When 
you release the mouse button after extending the range with the fill handle, 
Excel either creates a series in all of the cells that you select or copies the 
entire range with the initial value. To the right of the last entry in the filled 
or copied series, Excel also displays a drop-down button that contains a 
shortcut menu of options. You can use this shortcut menu to override Excel’s 
default filling or copying. For example, when you use the fill handle, Excel 
copies an initial value into a range of cells. But, if you want a sequential 
series, you could do this by selecting the Fill Series command on the AutoFill 
Options shortcut menu.
In Figures 2-11 and 2-12, I illustrate how to use AutoFill to enter a row of 
months, starting with January in cell B2 and ending with June in cell G2. To 
do this, you simply enter January in cell B2 and then position the mouse 
pointer on the fill handle in the lower-right corner of this cell before you drag 
through to cell G2 on the right (as shown in Figure 2-11). When you release 
the mouse button, Excel fills in the names of the rest of the months (February 
through June) in the selected cells (as shown in Figure 2-12). Excel keeps the 
cells with the series of months selected, giving you another chance to modify 
the series. (If you went too far, you can drag the fill handle to the left to cut 
back on the list of months; if you didn’t go far enough, you can drag it to the 
right to extend the list of months further.)
Also, you can use the options on the AutoFill Options drop-down menu 
(opened by clicking the drop-down button that appears on the fill handle to 
the right of June) to override the series created by default. To have Excel 
copy January into each of the selected cells, choose Copy Cells on this menu. 
To have the program fill the selected cells with the formatting used in cell B2 
(in this case, the cell has had bold applied to it — see Chapter 3 for details on 
formatting cells), you select Fill Formatting Only on this menu. To have Excel 
fill in the series of months in the selected cells without copying the format-
ting used in cell B2, you select the Fill without Formatting command from this 
shortcut menu.

See Table 2-3 in the following section to see some of the different initial 
values that AutoFill can use and the types of series that Excel can create from 
them.
Working with a spaced series
AutoFill uses the initial value that you select (date, time, day, year, and so 
on) to design the series. All the sample series I show in Table 2-3 change by 
a factor of one (one day, one month, or one number). You can tell AutoFill to 
create a series that changes by some other value: Enter two sample values 
in neighboring cells that describe the amount of change you want between 
each value in the series. Make these two values the initial selection that you 
extend with the fill handle.

75
 Chapter 2: Creating a Spreadsheet from Scratch
For example, to start a series with Saturday and enter every other day across 
a row, enter Saturday in the first cell and Monday in the cell next door. After 
selecting both cells, drag the fill handle across the cells to the right as far 
as you need to fill out a series based on these two initial values. When you 
release the mouse button, Excel follows the example set in the first two cells 
by entering every other day (Wednesday to the right of Monday, Friday to the 
right of Wednesday, and so on).

Copying with AutoFill
You can use AutoFill to copy a text entry throughout a cell range (rather 
than fill in a series of related entries). To copy a text entry to a cell range, 
hold down the Ctrl key while you click and drag the Fill handle. When you 
hold down the Ctrl key while you click the fill handle, a plus sign appears to 
the right of the Fill handle — your sign that AutoFill will copy the entry in the 
active cell instead of creating a series using it. You can also tell because the 
entry that appears as the AutoFill tip next to the mouse pointer while you 
drag contains the same text as the original cell. If you decide after copying an 
initial label or value to a range that you should have used it to fill in a series, 
click the drop-down button that appears on the fill handle at the cell with 
the last copied entry and then select the Fill Series command on the AutoFill 
Options shortcut menu that appears.

76
Part I: Getting In on the Ground Floor 
 
Although holding down Ctrl while you drag the fill handle copies a text entry, 
just the opposite is true when it comes to values! Suppose that you enter the 
number 17 in a cell and then drag the fill handle across the row — Excel just 
copies the number 17 in all the cells that you select. If, however, you hold 
down Ctrl while you drag the fill handle, Excel then fills out the series (17, 18, 
19, and so on). If you forget and create a series of numbers when you only 
need the value copied, rectify this situation by selecting the Copy Cells com-
mand on the AutoFill Options shortcut menu.
Creating custom lists for AutoFill
In addition to varying the increment in a series created with AutoFill, you 
can also create your own custom series. For example, say your company has 
offices in the following locations and you get tired of typing the sequence in 
each new spreadsheet that requires them:
 
✓ New York
 
✓ Chicago
 
✓ Atlanta
 
✓ Seattle
 
✓ San Francisco
 
✓ San Diego
After creating a custom list with these locations, you can enter the entire 
sequence of cities simply by entering New York in the first cell and then drag-
ging the Fill handle to the blank cells where the rest of the companies should 
appear.
To create this kind of custom series, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Options➪Advanced or press Alt+FIA and then click the 
Edit Custom Lists button in the General section to open the Options 
dialog box (as shown in Figure 2-13).
 
 If you’ve already gone to the time and trouble of typing the custom list 
in a range of cells, go to Step 2. If you haven’t yet typed the series in an 
open worksheet, go to Step 5.
 
2. Click inside the Import List from Cells text box and then click the 
Collapse Dialog Box button (the one with the picture of the tiny grid 
to the right of the Import List from Cells text box) so that you can 
see your list and drag through the range of cells to select them (see 
Chapter 3 for details).

77
 Chapter 2: Creating a Spreadsheet from Scratch
 
3. After selecting the cells in the worksheet, click the Expand Dialog Box 
button.
 
 This button automatically replaces the Collapse Dialog Box button.
 
Figure 2-13:

location

range of 
existing cell 
entries.
 
 
4. Click the Import button to copy this list into the List Entries list box.
 
 Skip to Step 7.
 
5. Click inside the List Entries list box and then type each entry (in the 
desired order), being sure to press Enter after typing each one.
 
 When all the entries in the custom list appear in the List Entries list box 
in the order you want them, proceed to Step 6.
 
6. Click the Add button to add the list of entries to the Custom Lists 
list box.
 
 Finish creating all the custom lists you need, using the preceding steps. 
When you’re done, move to Step 7.
 
7. Click OK twice, the first time to close the Options dialog box and the 
second to close the Excel Options dialog box and return to the current 
worksheet in the active workbook.
After adding a custom list to Excel, from then on you need only enter the first 
entry in a cell and then use the fill handle to extend it to the cells below or to 
the right.
 
If you don’t even want to bother with typing the first entry, use the 
AutoCorrect feature — refer to the section “You really AutoCorrect that for 
me,” earlier in this chapter — to create an entry that will fill in as soon as you 
type your favorite acronym for it (such as ny for New York).

78

Inserting special symbols
Excel makes it easy to enter special symbols, such as foreign currency indica-
tors, and special characters, such as the trademark and copyright symbols, 
into your cell entries. To add a special symbol or character to a cell entry 
you’re making or editing, click Insert➪Symbol on the Ribbon or press Alt+NU 
to open the Symbol dialog box (similar to the one shown in Figure 2-14). 
 
Figure 2-14: 
Use the 
Symbol 
dialog box 
to insert 
special 
symbols and 
characters 
into your 
cell entries. 
The Symbol dialog box contains two tabs: Symbols and Special Characters. 
To insert a mathematical or foreign currency symbol on the Symbols tab, 
click its symbol in the list box and then click the Insert button. (You can also 
do this by double-clicking the symbol.) To insert characters, such as foreign 
language or accented characters from other character sets, click the Subset 
drop-down button, click the name of the set in the drop-down list, and then 
click the desired characters in the list box. You can also insert commonly 
used currency and mathematical symbols, such as the pound or plus-or-
minus symbol, by clicking them in the Recently Used Symbols section at the 
bottom of this tab.
To insert special characters, such as the registered trademark, paragraph 
symbol, and ellipsis, click the Special Characters tab of the Symbol dialog 
box, locate the symbol in the scrolling list, click it, and then click the Insert 
button. (You can insert one of these special characters by double-clicking it 
also.)
When you finish inserting special symbols and characters, close the Symbol 
dialog box by clicking its Close button in its upper-right corner.

Entries all around the block
When you want to enter a table of information in a new worksheet, you can 
simplify the job of entering the data if you select all the empty cells in which 
you want to make entries before you begin entering any information. Just 
position the cell pointer in the first cell of what is to become the data table 
and then select all the cells in the subsequent columns and rows. (For infor-
mation on the ways to select a range of cells, see Chapter 3.) After you select 
the block of cells, you can begin entering the first entry.
When you select a block of cells (also known as a range) before you enter 
information, Excel restricts data entry to that range as follows:
 
✓ The program automatically advances the cell pointer to the next cell in 
the range when you click the Enter button or press Enter to complete 
each cell entry.
 
✓ In a cell range that contains several different rows and columns, Excel 
advances the cell pointer down each row of the column while you make 
your entries. When the cell pointer reaches the cell in the last row of the 
column, the cell pointer advances to the first selected row in the next 
column to the right. If the cell range uses only one row, Excel advances 
the cell pointer from left to right across the row.
 
✓ When you finish entering information in the last cell in the selected range, 
Excel positions the cell pointer in the first cell of the now-completed data 
table. To deselect the cell range, click the mouse pointer on one of the 
cells in the worksheet (inside or outside the selected range — it doesn’t 
matter) or press one of the arrow keys.
 
Be sure that you don’t press one of the arrow keys to complete a cell entry 
within a preselected cell range instead of clicking the Enter button or pressing 
Enter. Pressing an arrow key deselects the range of cells when Excel moves 
the cell pointer. To move the cell pointer around a cell range without deselect-
ing the range, try these methods:
 
✓ Press Enter to advance to the next cell down each row and then across 
each column in the range. Press Shift+Enter to move up to the previous 
cell.
 
✓ Press Tab to advance to the next cell in the column on the right and 
then down each row of the range. Press Shift+Tab to move left to the 
previous cell.
 
✓ Press Ctrl+. (period) to move from one corner of the range to another.

Data entry express
You can save a lot of time and energy when you want the same entry (text, 
value, or formula) to appear in many cells of the worksheet; you can enter 
the information in all the cells in one operation. You first select the cell 
ranges to hold the information. (Excel lets you select more than one cell 
range for this kind of thing — see Chapter 3 for details.) Then you construct 
the entry on the formula bar and press Ctrl+Enter to put the entry into all the 
selected ranges.
 
The key to making this operation a success is to hold the Ctrl key while you 
press Enter so that Excel inserts the entry on the formula bar into all the 
selected cells. If you forget to hold Ctrl and you just press Enter, Excel places 
the entry in the first cell only of the selected cell range.
You can also speed up data entry in a list that includes formulas by making 
sure that the Extend Data Range Formats and Formulas check box is selected 
in the Editing Options section of the Advanced tab in the Excel Options dialog 
box. (Choose File➪Options➪Advanced or press Alt+FIA.) When this check 
box is selected, Excel automatically formats new data that you type in the 
last row of a list to match that of like data in earlier rows and copies down 
formulas that appear in the preceding rows. Note, however, that for this new 
feature to kick in, you must manually enter the formulas and format the data 
entries in at least three rows preceding the new row.
How to Make Your Formulas 
Function Even Better
Earlier in this chapter, I show you how to create formulas that perform a 
series of simple mathematical operations, such as addition, subtraction, mul-
tiplication, and division. (See the section “Fabricating those fabulous formu-
las!”) Instead of creating complex formulas from scratch out of an intricate 
combination of these operations, you can find an Excel function to get the job 
done.
A function is a predefined formula that performs a particular type of com-
putation. All you have to do to use a function is supply the values that the 
function uses when performing its calculations. (In the parlance of the 
Spreadsheet Guru, such values are the arguments of the function.) As with 
simple formulas, you can enter the arguments for most functions either as a 
numerical value (for example, 22 or –4.56) or, as is more common, as a cell 
reference (B10) or as a cell range (C3:F3).

81
 Chapter 2: Creating a Spreadsheet from Scratch
Just as with a formula you build yourself, each function you use must start 
with an equal sign (=) so that Excel knows to enter the function as a formula 
rather than as text. Following the equal sign, you enter the name of the func-
tion (in uppercase or lowercase — it doesn’t matter, as long as you spell the 
name correctly). Following the name of the function, you enter the arguments 
required to perform the calculations. All function arguments are enclosed in 
a pair of parentheses.
 
If you type the function directly in a cell, remember not to insert spaces 
between the equal sign, function name, and the arguments enclosed in paren-
theses. Some functions use more than one value when performing their des-
ignated calculations. When this is the case, you separate each function with a 
comma (not a space).
After you type the equal sign and begin typing the first few letters of the 
name of the function you want to use, a drop-down list showing all the func-
tions that begin with the letters you’ve typed appears immediately beneath 
the cell. When you see the name of the function you want to use on this list, 
double-click it and Excel will finish entering the function name in the cell and 
on the Formula bar as well as add the left parenthesis that marks the begin-
ning of the arguments for the function.
Excel then displays all the arguments that the function takes beneath the cell 
and you can indicate any cell or cell range that you want to use as the first 
argument by either pointing to it or typing its cell or range references. When 
the function uses more than one argument, you can point to the cells or cell 
ranges or enter the addresses for the second argument right after you enter a 
comma (,) to complete the first argument.
After you finish entering the last argument, you need to close off the func-
tion by typing a right parenthesis to mark the end of the argument list. The 
display of the function name along with its arguments that appeared beneath 
the cell when you first selected the function from the drop-down list then dis-
appears. Click the Enter button or press Enter (or the appropriate arrow key) 
to then insert the function into the cell and have Excel calculate the answer.
Inserting a function into a formula with 
the Insert Function button
Although you can enter a function by typing it directly in a cell, Excel pro-
vides an Insert Function button on the Formula bar you can use to select 
any of Excel’s functions. When you click this button, Excel opens the Insert 
Function dialog box (shown in Figure 2-15) where you can select the function 
you want to use. After you select your function, Excel opens the Function 
Arguments dialog box. In this dialog box, you can specify the function argu-
ments. The real boon comes when you’re fooling with an unfamiliar function 
or one that’s kind of complex (some of these puppies can be hairy). You 

82
Part I: Getting In on the Ground Floor 
can get loads of help in completing the argument text boxes in the Function 
Arguments dialog box by clicking the Help on This Function link in the lower-
left corner.
 
Figure 2-15: 
Select the 
function you 
want to use 
in the Insert 
Function 
dialog box.
 
The Insert Function dialog box contains three boxes: a Search for a Function 
text box, an Or Select a Category drop-down list box, and a Select a Function 
list box. When you open the Insert Function dialog box, Excel automatically 
selects Most Recently Used as the category in the Select a Category drop-
down list box and displays the functions you usually use in the Select a 
Function list box.
If your function isn’t among the most recently used, you must then select the 
appropriate category of your function in the Select a Category drop-down 
list box. If you don’t know the category, you must search for the function by 
typing a description of its purpose in the Search for a Function text box and 
then press Enter or click the Go button. For example, to locate all the Excel 
functions that total values, you enter total in the Search for Function list box 
and click the Go button. Excel then displays its list of recommended func-
tions for calculating totals in the Select a Function list box. You can peruse 
the recommended functions by selecting each one. While you select each 
function in this list, the Insert Function dialog box shows you the required 
arguments followed by a description, at the bottom of the dialog box, of what 
the function does.
After you locate and select the function that you want to use, click the OK 
button to insert the function into the current cell and open the Function 
Arguments dialog box. This dialog box displays the required arguments for 
the function along with any that are optional. For example, suppose that you 
select the SUM function (the crown jewel of the Most Recently Used function 
category) in the Select a Function list box and then click OK. As soon as you 
do, the program inserts
SUM()

83
 Chapter 2: Creating a Spreadsheet from Scratch
in the current cell and on the Formula bar (following the equal sign), and the 
Function Arguments dialog box showing the SUM arguments appears on the 
screen (as shown in Figure 2-16). This is where you add the arguments for the 
SUM function.
 
Figure 2-16: 
Specify the 
arguments 
to use in the 
selected 
function in 
the Function 
Arguments 
dialog box.
 
As shown in Figure 2-16, you can sum up to 255 numbers in the Function 
Arguments dialog box. What’s not obvious, however (there’s always some 
trick, huh?), is that these numbers don’t have to be in single cells. In fact, 
most of the time you’ll be selecting a whole slew of numbers in nearby cells 
(in a multiple cell selection — that range thing) that you want to total.
To select your first number argument in the dialog box, you click the cell (or 
drag through the block of cells) in the worksheet while the insertion point 
is in the Number1 text box. Excel then displays the cell address (or range 
address) in the Number1 text box while, at the same time, showing the value 
in the cell (or values, if you select a bunch of cells) in the box to the right. 
Excel displays the total near the bottom of the Function Arguments dialog 
box after the words Formula result=.
When selecting cells, you can minimize this arguments dialog box to just the 
contents of the Number1 text box by dragging the cell pointer through the 
cells to sum in the worksheet. After you minimize the arguments dialog box 
while selecting the cells for the first argument, you can then expand it again 
by releasing the mouse button.
You can also reduce the dialog box to the Number1 argument text box by 
clicking the Minimize Dialog Box button on the right of the text box, selecting 
the cells, and then clicking the Maximize Dialog Box button (the only button 
displayed on the far right) or by pressing the Esc key. Instead of minimizing 
the dialog box, you can also temporarily move it out of the way by clicking 
on any part and then dragging the dialog box to its new destination on the 
screen.

84
Part I: Getting In on the Ground Floor 
If you’re adding more than one cell (or bunch of cells) in a worksheet, press 
the Tab key or click the Number2 text box to move the insertion point to that 
text box. (Excel responds by extending the argument list with a Number3 text 
box.) Here is where you specify the second cell (or cell range) to add to the 
one now showing in the Number1 text box. After you click the cell or drag 
through the second cell range, the program displays the cell address(es), the 
numbers in the cell(s) to the right, and the running total near the bottom of 
the Function Arguments dialog box after Formula result= (as shown in Figure 
2-16). You can minimize the entire Function Arguments dialog box down to 
just the contents of the argument text box you’re dealing with (Number2, 
Number3, and so on) by clicking its particular Minimize Dialog Box button if 
the dialog box obscures the cells that you need to select.
When you finish pointing out the cells or bunch of cells to sum, click the OK 
button to close the Function Arguments dialog box and put the SUM function 
in the current cell.
Editing a function with the 
Insert Function button
You can also use the Insert Function button to edit formulas that contain 
functions right from the Formula bar. Select the cell with the formula and 
function to edit before you click the Insert Function button (the one sport-
ing the fx that appears immediately in front of the current cell entry on the 
Formula bar).
As soon as you click the Insert Function button, Excel opens the Function 
Arguments dialog box where you can edit its arguments. To edit just the 
arguments of a function, select the cell references in the appropriate argu-
ment’s text box (marked Number1, Number2, Number3, and so on) and then 
make whatever changes are required to the cell addresses or select a new 
range of cells. 
Excel automatically adds any cell or cell range that you highlight in the work-
sheet to the current argument. If you want to replace the current argument, 
you need to highlight it and remove its cell addresses by pressing the Delete 
key before you highlight the new cell or cell range to use as the argument. 
(Remember that you can always minimize this dialog box or move it to a new 
location if it obscures the cells you need to select.)
When you finish editing the function, press Enter or click the OK button in 
the Function Arguments dialog box to put it away and update the formula in 
the worksheet.

 Chapter 2: Creating a Spreadsheet from Scratch
I’d be totally lost without AutoSum
Before leaving this fascinating discussion on entering functions, I want you to 
get to the AutoSum tool in the Editing group on the Home tab of the Ribbon. 
Look for the Greek sigma (Σ) symbol. This little tool is worth its weight in 
gold. In addition to entering the SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, MAX, or MIN functions, 
it also selects the most likely range of cells in the current column or row that 
you want to use as the function’s argument and then automatically enters 
them as the function’s argument. Nine times out of ten, Excel selects (with 
the marquee or moving dotted line) the correct cell range to total, average, 
count, and so forth. For that tenth case, you can manually correct the range 
by simply dragging the cell pointer through the block of cells to sum.
Simply click the AutoSum button on the Home tab when you want to insert 
the SUM function into the current cell. If you want to use this button to insert 
another function, such as AVERAGE, COUNT, MAX, or MIN, you need to click its 
drop-down button and select the name of the desired function on its pop-up 
menu (click Count Numbers on the menu to insert the COUNT function). If you 
select the More Functions command on this menu, Excel opens the Insert 
Function dialog box as though you had clicked the fx button on the 
Formula bar.
In Figure 2-17, check out how to use the AutoSum tool to total the sales of 
Jack Sprat Diet Centers in row 3. Position the cell pointer in cell E3 where the 
first-quarter total is to appear and then click the AutoSum tool. Excel inserts 
SUM (equal sign and all) onto the Formula bar; places a marquee around the 
cells B3, C3, and D3; and uses the cell range B3:D3 as the argument of the 
SUM function.

Part I: Getting In on the Ground Floor 
Now look at the worksheet after you insert the function in cell E3 (see Figure 
2-18). The calculated total appears in cell E3 while the following SUM function 
formula appears in the Formula bar:
=SUM(B3:D3)
 
Figure 2-18:

After entering the function to total the sales of Jack Sprat Diet Centers, you 
can copy this formula to total sales for the rest of the companies by dragging 
the fill handle down column E until the cell range E3:E10 is highlighted.
Look at Figure 2-19 to see how you can use the AutoSum tool to total the 
January sales for all the Mother Goose Enterprises in column B. Position the 
cell pointer in cell B10 where you want the total to appear. Click the AutoSum 
tool, and Excel places the marquee around cells B3 through B9 and correctly 
enters the cell range B3:B9 as the argument of the SUM function.

Making Sure That the Data 
Is Safe and Sound
All the work you do in any of the worksheets in your workbook is at risk 
until you save the workbook as a disk file, normally on your computer’s hard 
drive. Should you lose power or should your computer crash for any reason 
before you save the workbook, you’re out of luck. You have to re-create each 
keystroke — a painful task, made all the worse because it’s so unnecessary. 
To avoid this unpleasantness altogether, adopt this motto: Save your work 
any time that you enter more information than you could possibly bear to 
lose.
 
To encourage frequent saving on your part, Excel even provides you with a 
Save button on the Quick Access toolbar (the one with the picture of a 3¼  ” 
floppy disk, the very first on the toolbar). You don’t even have to take the 
time and trouble to choose the Save command from the File pull-down menu 
(opened by choosing File) or even press Ctrl+S; you can simply click this tool 
whenever you want to save new work on disk.
When you click the Save button, press Ctrl+S, or choose File➪Save for the 
first time, Excel displays the Save As dialog box. Use this dialog box to 
replace the temporary document name (Book1, Book2, and so forth) with a 
more descriptive filename in the File Name text box, select a new file format 
in the Save As Type drop-down list box, and select a new drive and folder 
before you save the workbook as a disk file.

88
Part I: Getting In on the Ground Floor 
When you finish making changes in the Save As dialog box, click the Save 
button or press Enter to have Excel 2010 save your work. When Excel saves 
your workbook file, the program saves all the information in every worksheet 
in your workbook (including the last position of the cell cursor) in the desig-
nated folder and drive. 
 
You don’t have to fool with the Save As dialog box again unless you want to 
rename the workbook or save a copy of it in a different folder. If you want to 
do these things, you must choose File➪Save As or press Alt+FA to choose the 
Save As command rather than clicking the Save button on the Quick Access 
toolbar or pressing Ctrl+S.
The Save As dialog box in Windows 7 
and Windows Vista
Figure 2-21 shows you the Save As dialog box as it appears in Excel 2010 
when running the program under Windows 7. Here, you can replace the tem-
porary filename (Book1, Book2, and so on) with a more descriptive name by 
clicking the File Name text box and typing in the new name (up to 255 charac-
ters total, including spaces).
 
Figure 2-21: 
The Save As 
dialog box 
enables you 
to select the 
filename 
and folder 
for the new 
workbook 
file as well 
as add tags 
to it. 
To select a new folder in which to save the new workbook file, follow these 
steps:
 
1. In the Navigation Pane, click the name of the folder in the Favorites, 
Libraries, Computer, or Network section in which you want to save 
the workbook file.

89
 Chapter 2: Creating a Spreadsheet from Scratch
 
2. To save the workbook file within a subfolder of one of the folders now 
displayed in the main pane of the Save As dialog box, double-click its 
folder icon to open it up.
 
3. (Optional) If you want to save the workbook file inside a new sub-
folder within the folder currently open in the Save As dialog box, 
click the New Folder button on the toolbar, replace the suggested New 
Folder name by typing the actual name of the folder, and then press 
Enter.
 
4. Click the Save button to save the file in the selected folder.
 
When the Save As dialog box is expanded by clicking the Browse Folders 
button, you can modify the authors or add tags to the new workbook file by 
clicking the Add an Author or Add a Tag text boxes. You can then use this 
information later when searching for the workbook. (See Chapter 4 for details 
on searching.)
The Save As dialog box in Windows XP
The Windows XP version of the Save As dialog box contains a bunch of large 
buttons that appear on the left side of the dialog box: My Recent Documents, 
Desktop, My Documents, My Computer, and My Network Places. Use these but-
tons to select the following folders in which to save your new workbook file:
 
✓ Click the My Recent Documents button to save your workbook in the 
Recent folder. The Recent folder resides in this hierarchy: Windows 
folder (on your hard drive)\Application Data folder\Microsoft folder\
Office folder\Recent folder.
 
✓ Click the Desktop button to save your workbook on your computer’s 
desktop.
 
✓ Click the My Documents button to save your workbook in the My 
Documents folder.
 
✓ Click the My Computer button to save your workbook on one of the 
disks on your computer or in your own or a shared documents folder on 
your hard drive.
 
✓ Click the My Network Places button to save your workbook in one of the 
folders on your company’s network.
 
To save your workbook in a new subfolder within the folder open in the Save 
As dialog box, click the Create New Folder button on the toolbar (or press 
Alt+4) and then type the name for the folder in the New Folder dialog box 
before you click OK.

90
Part I: Getting In on the Ground Floor 
Changing the default file location
Whenever you open the Save As dialog box to save a new workbook file, 
Excel 2010 automatically selects the folder listed in the Default File Location 
text box on the Save tab of the Excel Options dialog box (File➪Options➪Save 
or Alt+FIS).
When you first start using Excel, the default folder is either the My 
Documents (Windows XP) or the Documents folder (Windows 7 and Windows 
Vista) under your user name on your hard drive. For example, the directory 
path of the default folder where Excel 2010 automatically saves new work-
book files on my computer running Windows XP is
C:\Documents and Settings\Greg\My Documents
However, the directory path of the default folder where Excel 2010 automati-
cally saves new workbook files on my other computer running Windows 7 is
C:\Users\Greg\Documents
The very generic My Documents or Documents folder may not be the places 
on your hard drive where you want all the new workbooks you create auto-
matically saved. To change the default file location to another folder on your 
computer, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Options➪Save or press Alt+FIS to open the Save tab of 
the Excel Options dialog box.
 
 The Default File Location text box displays the directory path to the cur-
rent default folder.
 
2. Click the Default File Location text box.
 
 To edit part of the path (such as the My Documents or Documents folder 
name after your user name), click the mouse pointer at that place in the 
path to set the insertion point.
 
3. Edit the existing path or replace it with the path to another folder in 
which you want all future workbooks to save to automatically.
 
4. Click OK to close the Excel Options dialog box.
The difference between the XLSX 
and XLS file format
Excel 2010 supports the use of the XML-based file format first introduced in 
Excel 2007 (which Microsoft officially calls the Microsoft Office Open XML 
format). This default file format is touted as being more efficient in saving 

91
 Chapter 2: Creating a Spreadsheet from Scratch
data resulting in smaller file size and offering superior integration with exter-
nal data sources (especially, when these resources are Web-based ones sup-
porting XML files). This XML-based file format carries the filename extension 
.xlsx and is the file format in which Excel automatically saves any new 
workbook you create.
 
The only problem with this newfangled XML-based file format is that it can’t 
be opened by earlier Excel versions (before Excel 2007). Therefore, if someone 
who needs to work with the workbook you’ve just created isn’t using Excel 
2007 or hasn’t yet upgraded to Excel 2010, you need to save the new workbook 
in the earlier file format used in Excel versions 97 through 2003 with the old 
.xls filename extension. 
To do this, click the Save As Type drop-down button in the Save As dialog 
box and then click Excel 97-2003 Workbook (*.xls) on the drop-down menu. 
(If you work in an office where all workbooks must be backwardly compatible 
with earlier versions, see “Dealing with the new Excel file formats” in Chapter 
1 for a tip on making the Excel 97-2003 workbook file format the default 
format for Excel 2010.)
 
Filename extensions, such as .xlsx and .xls, do not appear as part of the 
filename (even though they are appended) in the File Name text box in the 
Excel Save As dialog box unless you’ve specifically changed Windows’ folder 
options to show them. To make this change, open the Folder Options dialog 
box in Windows Explorer and then deselect the Hide Extensions for Known 
File Types check box on the View tab. To open the Folder Options dialog box, 
select Tools➪Options on the Explorer window’s pull-down menus in Windows 
XP or click the Organize button and then select Folder and Search Options on 
its drop-down menu in Windows 7 and Windows Vista.
 
Excel 2010 also supports a special binary file format called Excel Binary 
Workbook that carries the .xlsb filename extension. Select this binary format 
for huge spreadsheets that you create that have to be compatible with earlier 
versions of Excel.
Saving the Workbook as a PDF File
The PDF (Portable Document File) file format developed by Adobe Systems 
Incorporated enables people to open up and print documents without access 
to the original programs with which the documents were created. 
Excel 2010 enables you to save your workbook files directly in this special 
PDF file format. You can readily share your Excel 2010 workbooks with users 
who don’t have Excel installed on their computers by saving them as PDF 
files. All they need to open and print the PDF copy of the workbook file is the 
free Adobe Reader software (which they can download from the Adobe Web 
site at www.adobe.com).

92
Part I: Getting In on the Ground Floor 
To save your workbook as a PDF file, you simply select the PDF option on the 
Save as Type drop-down list in the Save As dialog box. Excel then adds PDF-
specific options to the bottom of the Save As dialog box, with the Standard 
(Publishing Online and Printing) button under the Optimize For heading and 
the Open File after Publishing check box selected.
If you want to make the resulting PDF file as small as possible (because your 
worksheet is so large), click the Minimum Size (Publishing Online) button 
under the Optimize For heading. If you want to change which parts of the 
workbook are saved in the resulting PDF (Excel automatically saves all ranges 
in the active worksheet of the workbook), click the Options button directly 
beneath the Minimum Size (Publishing Online) option and make the appropri-
ate changes in the Options dialog box before you click OK.
If you don’t need to edit the filename (Excel automatically appends .pdf to 
the current filename) or the folder location in the Save As dialog box, simply 
click the Save button. Excel then saves a copy of the workbook in a PDF file 
format and, provided you don’t deselect the Open File after Publishing check 
box, automatically opens the workbook for your inspection in Adobe Reader. 
After viewing the PDF version in Adobe Reader, you can then return to your 
worksheet in Excel by clicking Reader’s Close button (or pressing Alt+F4).
 
If you create an Excel 2010 workbook that incorporates new features not sup-
ported in earlier versions of Excel, instead of saving the workbook as an .xls 
file, thereby losing all of its 2010 enhancements, consider saving it as a PDF 
file. That way, co-workers still using pre-2010 Excel versions can still access 
the data in all its glory via Adobe Reader.
Document Recovery to the Rescue
Excel 2010 offers a document recovery feature that can help you in the event 
of a computer crash because of a power failure or some sort of operating 
system freeze or shutdown. The AutoRecover feature saves your work-
books at regular intervals. In the event of a computer crash, Excel displays a 
Document Recovery task pane the next time you start Excel after rebooting 
the computer.
 
When you first start using Excel 2010, the AutoRecover feature is set to 
automatically save changes to your workbook (provided that the file has 
already been saved) every ten minutes. You can shorten or lengthen this 
interval as you see fit. Choose File➪Options➪Save or press Alt+FIS to open 
the Excel Options dialog box with the Save tab selected. Use the spinner but-
tons or enter a new automatic save interval into the text box marked Save 
AutoRecover Information Every 10 Minutes before clicking OK.

93
 Chapter 2: Creating a Spreadsheet from Scratch
After re-launching Excel 2010 after a computer crash that prevents you from 
saving your workbook file, the program opens with the Document Recovery 
task pane on the left side of the screen. This Document Recovery task pane 
shows the available versions of the workbook files that were open at the time 
of the computer crash. The original version of the workbook file is identified, 
including when it was saved, as is the recovered version of the file (display-
ing an .xlsb file extension) and when it was saved.
To open the recovered version of a workbook (to see how much of the work 
it contains that was unsaved at the time of the crash), position the mouse 
pointer over the AutoRecover version, click its drop-down menu button, and 
then click Open. After you open the recovered version, you can then (if you 
choose) save its changes by clicking the Save button on the Quick Access 
toolbar or by choosing File➪Save.
To save the recovered version of a workbook without bothering to first open 
it, place your mouse over the recovered version in the task pane, click its 
drop-down button, and then choose Save As. To abandon the recovered ver-
sion permanently (leaving you with only the data in the original version), 
click the Close button at the bottom of the Document Recovery task pane. 
When you click the Close button, an alert dialog box appears, giving you the 
chance to retain the recovered versions of the file for later viewing. To retain 
the files for later viewing, select the Yes (I Want to View These Files Later) 
radio button before clicking OK. To retain only the original versions of the 
files shown in the task pane, select the No (Remove These Files. I Have Saved 
the Files I Need) radio button instead.
 
The AutoRecover features only work on Excel workbooks that you’ve saved 
at least one time (as explained in the earlier section “Making Sure That the 
Data Is Safe and Sound”). In other words, if you build a new workbook and 
don’t bother to save and rename it prior to experiencing a computer crash, 
the AutoRecover feature will not bring back any part of it. For this reason, it is 
very important that you get into the habit of saving new workbooks with the 
Save button on the Quick Access toolbar very shortly after beginning to work 
on its worksheets. Or use the trusty keyboard shortcut Ctrl+S.

Editing without

T
he business world wouldn’t be half-bad if it weren’t 
for the fact that right around the time you master 
your job, somebody goes and changes it on you. When 
your life must always be flexible, changing gears and 
“going with the flow” can really grate on a person! The sad 
truth is that a big part of the work you do with Excel 2010 
is changing the stuff you slaved so hard to enter into the 
spreadsheet in the first place.
In Part II, I break down this editing stuff into three phases: 
formatting the raw data; rearranging the formatted data or 
in some cases deleting it; and spitting out the final format-
ted and edited data in printed form. Take it from me, after 
you know your way around editing your spreadsheets (as 
presented in this part of the book), you’re more than half-
way home with Excel 2010.

n spreadsheet programs like Excel, you normally don’t worry about how 
the stuff looks until after you enter all the data in the worksheets of your 
workbook and save it all safe and sound (see Chapters 1 and 2). Only then do 
you pretty up the information so that it’s clearer and easy to read.
After you decide on the types of formatting that you want to apply to a por-
tion of the worksheet, you can select all the cells to beautify and then click 
the appropriate tool or choose the menu command to apply those formats to 
the cells. However, before you discover all the fabulous formatting features 
you can use to dress up cells, you need to know how to pick the group of 
cells that you want to apply the formatting to — that is, selecting the cells or, 
alternately, making a cell selection.
Be aware, also, that entering data into a cell and formatting that data are 
two completely different things in Excel. Because they’re separate, you can 
change the entry in a formatted cell, and new entries assume the cell’s for-
matting. This enables you to format blank cells in a worksheet, knowing that 
when you get around to making entries in those cells, those entries automati-
cally assume the formatting you assign to those cells.

98
Part II: Editing without Tears 
Choosing a Select Group of Cells
Given the monotonously rectangular nature of the worksheet and its compo-
nents, it shouldn’t come as a surprise to find that all the cell selections you 
make in the worksheet have the same kind of cubist feel to them. After all, 
worksheets are just blocks of cells of varying numbers of columns and rows.
A cell selection (or cell range) is whatever collection of neighboring cells you 
choose to format or edit. The smallest possible cell selection in a worksheet 
is just one cell: the so-called active cell. The cell with the cell cursor is really 
just a single cell selection. The largest possible cell selection in a worksheet 
is all the cells in that worksheet (the whole enchilada, so to speak). Most 
of the cell selections you need for formatting a worksheet will probably fall 
somewhere in between, consisting of cells in several adjacent columns and 
rows.
Excel shows a cell selection in the worksheet by highlighting in color the 
entire block of cells within the extended cell cursor except for the active cell 
that keeps its original color. (Figure 3-1 shows several cell selections of differ-
ent sizes and shapes.)
 
Figure 3-1: 
Several cell 
selections 
of various 
shapes and 
sizes.
 
In Excel, you can select more than one cell range at a time (a phenomenon 
somewhat ingloriously called a noncontiguous or nonadjacent selection). In 
fact, although Figure 3-1 appears to contain several cell selections, it’s really 
just one big, nonadjacent cell selection with cell D12 (the active one) as the 
cell that was selected last.

99
 Chapter 3: Making It All Look Pretty
Point-and-click cell selections
The mouse is a natural for selecting a range of cells. Just position the mouse 
pointer (in its thick, white cross form) on the first cell and then click and 
drag in the direction that you want to extend the selection.
 
✓ To extend the cell selection to columns to the right, drag your mouse to 
the right, highlighting neighboring cells as you go.
 
✓ To extend the selection to rows to the bottom, drag your mouse down.
 
✓ To extend the selection down and to the right at the same time, drag 
your mouse diagonally toward the cell in the lower-right corner of the 
block you’re highlighting.
Shifty cell selections
To speed up the old cell-selection procedure, you can use the Shift+click 
method, which goes as follows:
 
1. Click the first cell in the selection.
 
 This selects that cell.
 
2. Position the mouse pointer in the last cell in the selection.
 
 This is kitty-corner from the first cell in your selected rectangular block.
 
3. Press the Shift key and hold it down while you click the mouse button 
again.
 
 When you click the mouse button the second time, Excel selects all the 
cells in the columns and rows between the first cell and last cell.
The Shift key works with the mouse like an extend key to extend a selection 
from the first object you select through to, and including, the second object 
you select. See the section “Extend that cell selection,” later in this chapter. 
Using the Shift key enables you to select the first and last cells, as well as all 
the intervening cells in a worksheet or all the document names in a dialog list 
box.
If, when making a cell selection with the mouse, you notice that you include 
the wrong cells before you release the mouse button, you can deselect the 
cells and resize the selection by moving the pointer in the opposite direction. 
If you already released the mouse button, click the first cell in the highlighted 
range to select just that cell (and deselect all the others) and then start the 
whole selection process again.

100
Part II: Editing without Tears 
Nonadjacent cell selections
To select a nonadjacent cell selection made up of more than one non-touching 
block of cells, drag through the first cell range and release the mouse button. 
Then hold down the Ctrl key while you click the first cell of the second range 
and drag the pointer through the cells in this range. As long as you hold 
down Ctrl while you select the subsequent ranges, Excel doesn’t deselect any 
of the previously selected cell ranges.
The Ctrl key works with the mouse like an add key to include non-neighboring 
objects in Excel. See the section “Nonadjacent cell selections with the key-
board,” later in this chapter. By using the Ctrl key, you can add to the selec-
tion of cells in a worksheet or to the document names in a dialog list box 
without having to deselect those already selected.
Going for the “big” cell selections
You can select the cells in entire columns or rows or even all the cells in the 
worksheet by applying the following clicking-and-dragging techniques to the 
worksheet frame:
 
✓ To select every single cell in a particular column, click its column letter 
on the frame at the top of the worksheet document window.
 
✓ To select every cell in a particular row, click its row number on the 
frame at the left edge of the document window.
 
✓ To select a range of entire columns or rows, drag through the column 
letters or row numbers on the frame surrounding the workbook.
 
✓ To select more than entire columns or rows that are not right next to 
each other (that old noncontiguous stuff, again), press and hold down 
the Ctrl key while you click the column letters or row numbers of the 
columns and rows that you want to add to the selection.
 
✓ To select every cell in the worksheet, press Ctrl+A or click the Select All 
button, which is the button with the triangle pointing downward on the 
diagonal (reminding me of the corner of a dog-eared book page). It’s in the 
upper-left corner of the workbook frame, formed by the intersection of the 
row with the column letters and the column with the row numbers.
Selecting the cells in a table of data, courtesy of AutoSelect
Excel provides a quick way (called AutoSelect) to select all the cells in a table 
of data entered as a solid block. To use AutoSelect, simply follow these steps:
 
1. Click the first cell of the table to select it.
 
 This is the cell in the table’s upper-left corner.
 
2. Hold down the Shift key while you double-click the right or bottom 
edge of the selected cell with the arrowhead mouse pointer. (See 
Figure 3-2.)

101
 Chapter 3: Making It All Look Pretty
 
Figure 3-2: 
Position 
the mouse 
pointer on 
the first 
cell’s bot-
tom edge 
to select all 
cells of the 
table’s first 
column.
 
 
 Double-clicking the bottom edge of the cell causes the cell selection to 
expand to the cell in the last row of the first column (as shown in Figure 
3-3). If you double-click the right edge of the cell, the cell selection 
expands to the cell in the last column of the first row.
 
Figure 3-3: 
Hold down 
Shift while 
you double-
click the 
bottom 
edge of the 
first cell to 
extend the 
selection 
down the 
column.
 
 
3a. Double-click somewhere on the right edge of the cell selection (refer 
to Figure 3-3) if the cell selection now consists of the first column of 
the table.
 
 This selects all the remaining rows of the table of data (as shown in 
Figure 3-4).
 
3b. Double-click somewhere on the bottom edge of the current cell selec-
tion if the cell selection now consists of the first row of the table.
 
 This selects all the remaining rows in the table.

Hold down 
Shift as you 
double-click 
the right 
edge of 
the current 
selection 
to extend it 
across the 
rows of the 
table.
 
 
Although the preceding steps may lead you to believe that you have to select 
the first cell of the table when you use AutoSelect, you can actually select any 
of the cells in the four corners of the table. Then, when expanding the cell 
selection in the table with the Shift key depressed, you can choose whatever 
direction you like to either select the first or last row of the table or the first 
or last column. (Choose left, by clicking the left edge; right, by clicking the 
right edge; up, by clicking the top edge; or down, by clicking the bottom edge.) 
After expanding the cell selection to include either the first or last row or first 
or last column, you need to click whichever edge of that current cell selection 
that will expand it to include all the remaining table rows or columns.
Keyboard cell selections
If you’re not keen on using the mouse, you can use the keyboard to select the 
cells you want. Sticking with the Shift+click method of selecting cells, the easi-
est way to select cells with the keyboard is to combine the Shift key with other 
keystrokes that move the cell cursor. (I list these keystrokes in Chapter 1.)
Start by positioning the cell cursor in the first cell of the selection and then 
holding the Shift key while you press the appropriate cell-pointer movement 
keys. When you hold the Shift key while you press direction keys — such as 
the arrow keys (↑, →, ↓, ←), PgUp, or PgDn — Excel anchors the selection on 
the current cell, moves the cell cursor, and highlights cells as it goes.
 
When making a cell selection this way, you can continue to alter the size and 
shape of the cell range with the cell-pointer movement keys as long as you 
don’t release the Shift key. After you release the Shift key, pressing any of the 
cell-pointer movement keys immediately collapses the selection, reducing it to 
just the cell with the cell cursor.

103
 Chapter 3: Making It All Look Pretty
Extend that cell selection
If holding the Shift key while you move the cell cursor is too tiring, you can 
place Excel in Extend mode by pressing (and promptly releasing) F8 before 
you press any cell-pointer movement key. Excel displays the Extend Selection 
indicator on the left side of the Status bar — when you see this, the program 
will select all the cells that you move the cell cursor through (just as though 
you were holding down the Shift key).
After you highlight all the cells you want in the cell range, press F8 again (or 
Esc) to turn off Extend mode. The Extend Selection indicator disappears from 
the status bar, and then you can once again move the cell cursor with the 
keyboard without highlighting everything in your path. In fact, when you first 
move the pointer, all previously selected cells are deselected.
AutoSelect keyboard style
For the keyboard equivalent of AutoSelect with the mouse (see the “Selecting 
the cells in a table of data, courtesy of AutoSelect” section), you combine 
the use of the F8 key (Extend key) or the Shift key with the Ctrl+arrow keys 
or End+arrow keys to zip the cell cursor from one end of a block to the other 
and merrily select all the cells in that path.
To select an entire table of data with a keyboard version of AutoSelect, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Position the cell cursor in the first cell.
 
 That’s the cell in the upper-left corner of the table.
 
2. Press F8 (or hold the Shift key) and then press Ctrl+→ to extend the 
cell selection to the cells in the columns on the right.
 
3. Then press Ctrl+↓ to extend the selection to the cells in the rows 
below.
 
The directions in the preceding steps are somewhat arbitrary — you can just 
as well press Ctrl+↓ before you press Ctrl+→. Just be sure (if you’re using the 
Shift key instead of F8) that you don’t let up on the Shift key until after you 
finish performing these two directional maneuvers. Also, if you press F8 to get 
the program into Extend mode, don’t forget to press this key again to get out 
of Extend mode after the table cells are all selected, or you’ll end up selecting 
cells that you don’t want included when you next move the cell cursor.
Nonadjacent cell selections with the keyboard
Selecting more than one cell range is a little more complicated with the key-
board than it is with the mouse. When using the keyboard, you alternate 
between anchoring the cell cursor and moving it to select the cell range and 

104
Part II: Editing without Tears 
unanchoring the cell cursor and repositioning it at the beginning of the next 
range. To unanchor the cell cursor so that you can move it into position for 
selecting another range, press Shift+F8. This puts you in Add to Selection 
mode, in which you can move to the first cell of the next range without select-
ing any more cells. Excel lets you know that the cell cursor is unanchored by 
displaying the Add to Selection indicator on the left side of the Status bar.
To select more than one cell range by using the keyboard, follow these gen-
eral steps:
 
1. Move the cell cursor to the first cell of the first cell range that you 
want to select.
 
2. Press F8 to get into Extend Selection mode.
 
 Move the cell cursor to select all the cells in the first cell range. 
Alternatively, hold the Shift key while you move the cell cursor.
 
3. Press Shift+F8 to switch from Extend Selection mode to Add to 
Selection mode.
 
 The Add to Selection indicator appears in the Status bar.
 
4. Move the cell cursor to the first cell of the next nonadjacent range that 
you want to select.
 
5. Press F8 again to get back into Extend Selection mode and then move 
the cell cursor to select all the cells in this new range.
 
6. If you still have other nonadjacent ranges to select, repeat Steps 3, 4, 
and 5 until you select and add all the cell ranges that you want to use.
Cell selections à la Go To
If you want to select a large cell range that would take a long time to select by 
pressing various cell-pointer movement keys, use the Go To feature to extend 
the range to a far distant cell. All you gotta do is follow this pair of steps:
 
1. Position the cell cursor in the first cell of the range and then press F8 
to anchor the cell cursor and get Excel into Extend Selection mode.
 
2. Press F5 or Ctrl+G to open the Go To dialog box, type the address of 
the last cell in the range (the cell kitty-corner from the first cell), and 
then click OK or press Enter.
 
Because Excel is in Extend Selection mode at the time you use the Go To fea-
ture to jump to another cell, the program not only moves the cell cursor to 
the designated cell address but selects all the intervening cells as well. After 
selecting the range of cells with the Go To feature, don’t forget to press F8 
(the Extend Selection key) again to prevent the program from messing up your 
selection by adding more cells the next time you move the cell cursor.

105
 Chapter 3: Making It All Look Pretty
Having Fun with the Format 
as Table Gallery
Here’s a formatting technique that doesn’t require you to do any prior cell 
selecting. (Kinda figures, doesn’t it?) The Format as Table feature is so auto-
matic that the cell cursor just has to be within the table of data prior to you 
clicking the Format as Table command button in the Styles group on the 
Home tab. Clicking the Format as Table command button opens its rather 
extensive Table gallery with the formatting thumbnails divided into three sec-
tions — Light, Medium, and Dark — each of which describes the intensity of 
the colors used by its various formats.
As soon as you click one of the table formatting thumbnails in this Table gal-
lery, Excel makes its best guess as to the cell range of the data table to apply 
it to (indicated by the marquee around its perimeter) and the Format As 
Table dialog box, similar to the one shown in Figure 3-5, appears.
 
Figure 3-5: 
Selecting a 
format from 
the Table 
gallery and 
indicating 
its range in 
the Format 
As Table 
dialog box.
 
This dialog box contains a Where Is the Data for Your Table text box that 
shows the address of the cell range currently selected by the marquee and a 
My Table Has Headers check box.
If Excel does not correctly guess the range of the data table you want to 
format, drag through the cell range to adjust the marquee and the range 
address in the Where Is the Data for Your Table text box. If your data table 

106
Part II: Editing without Tears 
doesn’t use column headers or, if the table has them, but you still don’t want 
Excel to add Filter drop-down buttons to each column heading, deselect the 
My Table Has Headers check box before you click the OK button.
 
The table formats in the Table gallery are not available if you select multiple 
nonadjacent cells before you click the Format as Table command button on 
the Home tab.
After you click the OK button in the Format As Table dialog box, Excel 
applies the format of the thumbnail you clicked in the gallery to the data 
table. Additionally, the Design tab appears under the Table Tools contextual 
tab at the end of the Ribbon, as shown in Figure 3-6.
 
Figure 3-6: 
After you 
select a 
format from 
the Table 
gallery, the 
Design tab 
appears 
under the 
Table Tools 
contextual 
tab.
 
 
The Design tab enables you to use Live Preview to see how your table would 
appear. Simply position the mouse pointer over any of the format thumbnails 
in the Table Styles group to see the data in your table appear in that table 
format. Click the button with the triangle pointing downward to scroll up new 
rows of table formats in the Table Styles group and the button with the tri-
angle pointing upward to scroll down rows without opening the Table gallery 
and possibly obscuring the actual data table in the Worksheet area. Click the 
More button (the one with the horizontal bar above the downward pointing 
triangle) to redisplay the Table gallery and then mouse over the thumbnails in 
the Light, Medium, and Dark sections to have Live Preview apply them to the 
table. 

107
 Chapter 3: Making It All Look Pretty
In addition to enabling you to select a new format from the Table gallery in 
the Table Styles group, the Design tab contains a Table Style Options group 
containing a bunch of check boxes that enable you to customize the look of 
the selected table format even further:
 
✓ Header Row to add special formatting and Filter buttons to each of the 
column headings in the first row of the table.
 
✓ Total Row to have Excel add a Total Row to the bottom of the table 
that displays the sums of each column that contains values. To apply 
another Statistical function to the values in a particular column, click 
the cell in that column’s Total Row to display a drop-down list button 
and then select the function — Average, Count, Count Numbers, Max, 
Min, Sum, StdDev (Standard Deviation), or Var (Variance).
 
✓ First Column to have Excel display the row headings in the first column 
of the table in bold.
 
✓ Last Column to have Excel display the row headings in the last column 
of the table in bold.
 
✓ Banded Rows to have Excel apply shading to every other row in the 
table.
 
✓ Banded Columns to have Excel apply shading to every other column in 
the table.
 
Whenever you assign a format in the Table gallery to one of the data tables 
in your workbook, Excel automatically assigns that table a generic range 
name (Table1, Table2, and so on). You can use the Table Name text box in 
the Properties group on the Design tab to rename the data table by giving it a 
more descriptive range name. (See Chapter 6 for all you need to know about 
naming cell ranges.)
 
When you finish selecting and/or customizing the formatting of your data 
table, click a cell outside of the table to remove the Table Tools contextual 
tab (with its Design tab) from the Ribbon. If later, you decide that you want to 
further experiment with the table’s formatting, click any of the table’s cells to 
redisplay the Table Tools’ Design tab at the end of the Ribbon.
Cell Formatting from the Home Tab
Some spreadsheet tables or ranges within them require a lighter touch than 
the Format as Table command button offers. For example, you may have a 
data table where the only emphasis you want to add is to make the column 
headings bold at the top of the table and to underline the row of totals at the 
bottom (done by drawing a borderline along the bottom of the cells).

108
Part II: Editing without Tears 
The formatting buttons that appear in the Font, Alignment, and Number 
groups on the Home tab enable you to accomplish just this kind of targeted 
cell formatting. Figures 3-7, 3-8, and 3-9 identify all the formatting buttons in 
these three groups on the Home tab. See Table 3-1 for a complete rundown 
on how to use each of these formatting buttons.

Formatting Cells Close to the 
Source with the Mini-Toolbar
Excel 2010 makes it easy to apply common formatting changes to a cell selec-
tion right within the Worksheet area thanks to its new mini-toolbar feature, 
nicknamed the mini-bar (makes me thirsty just thinking about it!).

112
Part II: Editing without Tears 
To display the mini-bar, select the cells that need formatting and then right-
click somewhere in the cell selection. The mini-toolbar then appears immedi-
ately above the cell selection (see Figure 3-10).

As you can see in this figure, the mini-toolbar contains most of the buttons 
from the Font group of the Home tab (with the exception of the Underline 
button). It also contains the Center and Merge & Center buttons from the 
Alignment group (see “Altering the Alignment” later in this chapter) and the 
Accounting Number Format, Percent Style, Comma Style, Increase Decimal, 
and Decrease Decimal buttons from the Number group (see “Getting comfort-
able with the number formats” later in this chapter). Simply click these but-
tons to apply their formatting to the current cell selection.
Additionally, the mini-bar contains the Format Painter button from the 
Clipboard group of the Home tab that you can use to copy the formatting 
in the active cell to a cell selection you make (see “Fooling Around with the 
Format Painter” later in this chapter for details).
Using the Format Cells Dialog Box
Although the command buttons in the Font, Alignment, and Number groups 
on the Home tab give you immediate access to the most commonly used 

113
 Chapter 3: Making It All Look Pretty
formatting commands, they do not represent all of Excel’s formatting com-
mands by any stretch of the imagination.
To have access to all the formatting commands, you need to open the Format 
Cells dialog box by doing any of the following:
 
✓ Click the More Number Formats option at the very bottom of the drop-
down menu attached to the Number Format button
 
✓ Click the dialog box launcher in the lower right of the Number group
 
✓ Press Ctrl+1
The Format Cells dialog box that this command calls up contains six tabs: 
Number, Alignment, Font, Border, Fill, and Protection. In this chapter, I show 
you how to use them all except the Protection tab. For information on that 
tab, see Chapter 6.
 
The keystroke shortcut that opens the Format Cells dialog box — Ctrl+1 — is 
one worth knowing. Just press the Ctrl key plus the number 1 key, and not the 
function key F1.
Getting comfortable with 
the number formats
As I explain in Chapter 2, how you enter values into a worksheet determines 
the type of number format that they get. Here are some examples:
 
✓ If you enter a financial value complete with the dollar sign and two deci-
mal places, Excel assigns a Currency number format to the cell along 
with the entry.
 
✓ If you enter a value representing a percentage as a whole number fol-
lowed by the percent sign without any decimal places, Excel assigns the 
cell the Percentage number format that follows this pattern along with 
the entry.
 
✓ If you enter a date (dates are values, too) that follows one of the built-
in Excel number formats, such as 11/06/02 or 06-Nov-02, the program 
assigns a Date number format that follows the pattern of the date along 
with a special value representing the date.
Although you can format values in this manner as you go along (which is nec-
essary in the case of dates), you don’t have to do it this way. You can always 
assign a number format to a group of values before or after you enter them. 

114
Part II: Editing without Tears 
Formatting numbers after you enter them is often the most efficient way to go 
because it’s just a two-step procedure:
 
1. Select all the cells containing the values that need dressing up.
 
2. Select the number format that you want to use from the formatting 
command buttons on the Home tab or the options available on the 
Number tab in the Format Cells dialog box.
 
Even if you’re a really, really good typist and prefer to enter each value exactly 
as you want it to appear in the worksheet, you still have to resort to using 
number formats to make the values that are calculated by formulas match 
the others you enter. This is because Excel applies a General number format 
(which the Format Cells dialog box defines: “General format cells have no spe-
cific number format.”) to all the values it calculates as well as any you enter 
that don’t exactly follow one of the other Excel number formats. The biggest 
problem with the General format is that it has the nasty habit of dropping all 
leading and trailing zeros from the entries. This makes it very hard to line up 
numbers in a column on their decimal points.
You can view this sad state of affairs in Figure 3-11, which is a sample work-
sheet with the first-quarter 2010 sales figures for Mother Goose Enterprises 
before any of the values have been formatted. Notice how the numbers in the 
monthly sales figures columns zig and zag because they don’t align according 
to decimal place. This is the fault of Excel’s General number format; the only 
cure is to format the values with a uniform number format.

 Chapter 3: Making It All Look Pretty
Accenting your cells with the Accounting number format
Given the financial nature of most worksheets, you probably use the 
Accounting number format more than any other. Applying this format is 
easy because you can assign it to the cell selection simply by clicking the 
Accounting Number Format button on the Home tab.
 
The Accounting number format adds a dollar sign, commas between thou-
sands of dollars, and two decimal places to any values in a selected range. 
If any of the values in the cell selection are negative, this number format 
displays them in parentheses (the way accountants like them). If you want 
a minus sign in front of your negative financial values rather than enclosing 
them in parentheses, select the Currency format on the Number Format drop-
down menu or on the Number tab of the Format Cells dialog box.
You can see in Figure 3-12 only the cells containing totals are selected (cell 
ranges E3:E10 and B10:D10). This cell selection was then formatted with the 
Accounting number format by simply clicking its command button (the one 
with the $ icon, naturally) in the Number group on the Ribbon’s Home tab.
 
Although you could put all the figures in the table into the Accounting number 
format to line up the decimal points, this would result in a superabundance 
of dollar signs in a fairly small table. In this example, I only formatted the 
monthly and quarterly totals with the Accounting number format.

Part II: Editing without Tears 
“Look, Ma, no more format overflow!”
When I apply the Accounting number format to the selection in the cell 
ranges of E3:E10 and B10:D10 in the sales table shown in Figure 3-12, Excel 
adds dollar signs, commas between the thousands, a decimal point, and two 
decimal places to the highlighted values. At the same time, Excel automati-
cally widens columns B, C, D, and E just enough to display all this new for-
matting. In versions of Excel earlier than Excel 2003, you had to widen these 
columns yourself, and instead of the perfectly aligned numbers, you were 
confronted with columns of #######s in cell ranges E3:E10 and B10:D10. Such 
pound signs (where nicely formatted dollar totals should be) serve as over-
flow indicators, declaring that whatever formatting you added to the value in 
that cell has added so much to the value’s display that Excel can no longer 
display it within the current column width.
Fortunately, Excel eliminates the format overflow indicators when you’re for-
matting the values in your cells by automatically widening the columns. The 
only time you’ll ever run across these dreaded #######s in your cells is when 
you take it upon yourself to narrow a worksheet column manually (see the 
section “Calibrating Columns,” later in this chapter) to the extent that Excel 
can no longer display all the characters in its cells with formatted values.
Currying your cells with the Comma Style
The Comma Style format offers a good alternative to the Currency format. 
Like Currency, the Comma Style format inserts commas in larger numbers 
to separate thousands, hundred thousands, millions, and . . . well, you get 
the idea.
This format also displays two decimal places and puts negative values in 
parentheses. What it doesn’t display is dollar signs. This makes it perfect 
for formatting tables where it’s obvious that you’re dealing with dollars and 
cents or for larger values that have nothing to do with money.
The Comma Style format also works well for the bulk of the values in the sample 
first-quarter sales worksheet. Check out Figure 3-13 to see this table after I format 
the cells containing the monthly sales for all the Mother Goose Enterprises with 
the Comma Style format. To do this, select the cell range B3:D9 and click the 
Comma Style button — the one with the comma icon (,) — in the Number group 
on the Home tab.
Note how, in Figure 3-13, the Comma Style format takes care of the earlier 
decimal alignment problem in the quarterly sales figures. Moreover, Comma 
Style–formatted monthly sales figures align perfectly with the Currency 
format–styled monthly totals in row 10. If you look closely (you may need a 
magnifying glass for this one), you see that these formatted values no longer 
abut the right edges of their cells; they’ve moved slightly to the left. The gap 
on the right between the last digit and the cell border accommodates the 
right parenthesis in negative values, ensuring that they, too, align precisely 
on the decimal point.

Playing around with Percent Style
Many worksheets use percentages in the form of interest rates, growth 
rates, inflation rates, and so on. To insert a percentage in a cell, type the 
percent sign (%) after the number. To indicate an interest rate of 12 percent, 
for example, you enter 12% in the cell. When you do this, Excel assigns a 
Percentage number format and, at the same time, divides the value by 100 
(that’s what makes it a percentage) and places the result in the cell (0.12 in 
this example).
Not all percentages in a worksheet are entered by hand in this manner. Some 
may be calculated by a formula and returned to their cells as raw decimal 
values. In such cases, you should add a Percent format to convert the calcu-
lated decimal values to percentages (done by multiplying the decimal value 
by 100 and adding a percent sign).
The sample first-quarter-sales worksheet just happens to have some percent-
ages calculated by formulas in row 12 that need formatting (these formulas 
indicate what percentage each monthly total is of the first-quarter total in cell 
E10). In Figure 3-14, these values reflect Percent Style formatting. To accom-
plish this feat, you simply select the cells and click the Percent Style button 
in the Number group on the Home tab. (Need I point out that it’s the button 
with the % symbol?)

Deciding how many decimal places
You can increase or decrease the number of decimal places used in a number 
entered by using the Accounting Number Format, Comma Style, or Percent 
Style button in the Number group of the Home tab simply by clicking the 
Increase Decimal button or the Decrease Decimal button in this group.
Each time you click the Increase Decimal button (the one with the arrow 
pointing left), Excel adds another decimal place to the number format you 
apply. Percentages appear in the cell range B12:D12 (see Figure 3-15) after 
I increase the number of decimal places in the Percent format from none to 
two. (Percent Style doesn’t use any decimal places.) I accomplish this by 
clicking the Increase Decimal button twice. 
The values behind the formatting
Make no mistake about it — all that these fancy number formats do is spiff up 
the presentation of the values in the worksheet. Like a good illusionist, a par-
ticular number format sometimes appears to transform some entries, but in 
reality, the entries are the same old numbers you started with. For example, 
suppose that a formula returns the following value:
25.6456

119
 Chapter 3: Making It All Look Pretty
 
Figure 3-15: 
Monthly-
to-quarterly 
sales per-
centages 
after adding 
two deci-
mal places 
to the 
Percentage 
number 
format.
 
Now suppose that you format the cell containing this value with the 
Accounting Number Format button on the Home tab. The value now appears 
as follows:
$25.65
This change may lead you to believe that Excel rounded the value up to two 
decimal places. In fact, the program has rounded up only the display of the 
calculated value — the cell still contains the same old value of 25.6456. If you 
use this cell in another worksheet formula, Excel uses the behind-the-scenes 
value in its calculation, not the spiffed-up one shown in the cell.
 
If you want the values to match their formatted appearance in the worksheet, 
Excel can do that in a single step. Be forewarned, however, that this is a one-
way trip. You can convert all underlying values to the way they are displayed 
by selecting a single check box, but you can’t return them to their previous 
state by deselecting this check box.
Well, because you insist on knowing this little trick anyway, here goes (just 
don’t write and try to tell me that you weren’t warned):
 
1. Make sure that you format all the values in your worksheet with the 
right number of decimal places.
 
 You must do this step before you convert the precision of all values in 
the worksheet to their displayed form.

120
Part II: Editing without Tears 
 
2. Choose File➪Options➪Advanced or press Alt+FIA to open the 
Advanced tab of Excel Options dialog box.
 
3. In the When Calculating This Workbook section, click the Set 
Precision as Displayed check box (to fill it with a check mark).
 
 Excel displays the Data Will Permanently Lose Accuracy alert dialog box.
 
4. Go ahead (live dangerously) and click the OK button or press Enter to 
convert all values to match their display. Click OK again to close the 
Excel Options dialog box.
 
Save the workbook with the calculated values. After converting all the values 
in a worksheet by selecting the Set Precision as Displayed check box, open the 
Save As dialog box (File➪Save As or press Alt+FA). Edit the filename in the File 
Name text box (maybe by appending as Displayed to the current filename) 
before you click the Save button or press Enter. That way, you’ll have two 
copies: the original workbook file with the values as entered and calculated by 
Excel and the new as Displayed version.
Make it a date!
In Chapter 2, I mention that you can easily create formulas that calculate the 
differences between the dates and times that you enter in your worksheets. 
The only problem is that when Excel subtracts one date from another date 
or one time from another time, the program automatically formats the cal-
culated result in a corresponding date or time number format as well. For 
example, if you enter 8-15-10 in cell B4 and 4/15/10 in cell C4 and in cell D4 
enter the following formula for finding the number of elapsed days between 
the two dates:
=B4-C4
Excel correctly returns the result of 122 (days) using the General number 
format. However, when dealing with formulas that calculate the difference 
between two times in a worksheet, you have to reformat the result that 
appears in a corresponding time format into the General format. For example, 
suppose that you enter 8:00 AM in cell B5 and 4:00 PM in cell C5 and then 
create in cell D5 the following formula for calculating the difference in hours 
between the two times:
=C5-B5
You then have to convert the result in cell D5 — that automatically appears as 
8:00 AM — to the General format. When you do this, the fraction 0.333333 — 

121
 Chapter 3: Making It All Look Pretty
representing its fraction of the total 24-hour period — replaces 8:00 AM in cell 
D5. You can then convert this fraction of a total day into the corresponding 
number of hours by multiplying this cell by 24.
Ogling some of the other number formats
Excel supports more number formats than just the Accounting, Comma 
Style, and Percentage number formats. To use them, select the cell range (or 
ranges) you want to format and select Format Cells on the cell shortcut menu 
(right-click somewhere in the cell selection to activate this menu) or just 
press Ctrl+1 to open the Format Cells dialog box.
After the Format Cells dialog box opens with the Number tab displayed, 
you select the desired format from the Category list box. Some number 
formats — such as Date, Time, Fraction, and Special — give you further for-
matting choices in a Type list box. Other number formats, such as Number 
and Currency, have their own particular boxes that give you options for refin-
ing their formats. When you click the different formats in these list boxes, 
Excel shows what effect this would have on the first of the values in the cur-
rent cell selection in the Sample area above. When the sample has the format 
that you want to apply to the current cell selection, you just click OK or press 
Enter to apply the new number format.
Excel contains a nifty category of number formats called Special. The Special 
category contains the following four number formats that may interest you:
 
✓ Zip Code: Retains any leading zeros in the value (important for zip 
codes and of absolutely no importance in arithmetic computations). 
Example: 00123.
 
✓ Zip Code + 4: Automatically separates the last four digits from the first 
five digits and retains any leading zeros. Example: 00123-5555.
 
✓ Phone Number: Automatically encloses the first three digits of the 
number in parentheses and separates the last four digits from the previ-
ous three with a dash. Example: (999) 555-1111.
 
✓ Social Security Number: Automatically puts dashes in the value to sepa-
rate its digits into groups of three, two, and four. Example: 666-00-9999.
These Special number formats really come in handy when creating data lists 
in Excel that often deal with stuff like zip codes, telephone numbers, and 
sometimes even Social Security numbers (see Chapter 9 for more on creating 
and using data lists).

Part II: Editing without Tears 
Calibrating Columns
For those times when Excel 2010 doesn’t automatically adjust the width of 
your columns to your complete satisfaction, the program makes your chang-
ing the column widths a breeze. The easiest way to adjust a column is to do 
a best-fit, using the AutoFit feature. With this method, Excel automatically 
determines how much to widen or narrow the column to fit the longest entry 
currently in the column.
Here’s how to use AutoFit to get the best fit for a column:
 
1. Position the mouse pointer on the right border of the worksheet frame 
with the column letter at the top of the worksheet.
 
 The mouse pointer changes to a double-headed arrow pointing left and 
right.
 
2. Double-click the mouse button.
 
 Excel widens or narrows the column width to suit the longest entry.
You can apply a best-fit to more than one column at a time. Simply select all 
the columns that need adjusting (if the columns neighbor one another, drag 
through their column letters on the frame; if they don’t, hold down the Ctrl 
key while you click the individual column letters). After you select the col-
umns, double-click any of the right borders on the frame.
Best-fit à la AutoFit doesn’t always produce the expected results. A long title 
that spills into several columns to the right produces a very wide column 
when you use best-fit.
 
When AutoFit’s best-fit won’t do, drag the right border of the column (on the 
frame) until it’s the size you need instead of double-clicking it. This manual 
technique for calibrating the column width also works when more than one 
column is selected. Just be aware that all selected columns assume whatever 
size you make the one that you’re actually dragging.
You can also set the widths of columns from the Format button’s drop-down 
list in the Cells group on the Home tab. When you click this drop-down 
button, the Cell Size section of this drop-down menu contains the following 
width options:
 
✓ Column Width to open the Column Width dialog box where you enter 
the number of characters that you want for the column width before you 
click OK

123
 Chapter 3: Making It All Look Pretty
 
✓ AutoFit Column Width to have Excel apply best-fit to the columns based 
on the widest entries in the current cell selection
 
✓ Default Width to open the Standard Width dialog box containing the 
standard column width of 8.43 characters that you can apply to the col-
umns in the cell selection
Rambling rows
The story with adjusting the heights of rows is pretty much the same as that 
with adjusting columns except that you do a lot less row adjusting than you 
do column adjusting. That’s because Excel automatically changes the height 
of the rows to accommodate changes to their entries, such as selecting a 
larger font size or wrapping text in a cell. I discuss both of these techniques 
in the upcoming section “Altering the Alignment.” Most row-height adjust-
ments come about when you want to increase the amount of space between a 
table title and the table or between a row of column headings and the table of 
information without actually adding a blank row. (See the section “From top 
to bottom,” later in this chapter, for details.)
To increase the height of a row, drag the bottom border of the row frame 
down until the row is high enough and then release the mouse button. To 
shorten a row, reverse this process and drag the bottom row-frame border 
up. To use AutoFit to best-fit the entries in a row, you double-click the 
bottom row-frame border.
As with columns, you can also adjust the height of selected rows using row 
options in the Cell Size section on the Format button’s drop-down menu on 
the Home tab:
 
✓ Row Height to open the Row Height dialog box where you enter the 
number of points in the Row Height text box and then click OK
 
✓ AutoFit Row Height to return the height of selected rows to the best fit
Now you see it, now you don’t
A funny thing about narrowing columns and rows: You can get carried away 
and make a column so narrow or a row so short that it actually disappears 
from the worksheet! This can come in handy for those times when you 
don’t want part of the worksheet visible. For example, suppose you have a 

124
Part II: Editing without Tears 
worksheet that contains a column listing employee salaries — you need these 
figures to calculate the departmental budget figures, but you would prefer to 
leave sensitive info off most printed reports. Rather than waste time moving 
the column of salary figures outside the area to be printed, you can just hide 
the column until after you print the report.
Hiding worksheet columns
Although you can hide worksheet columns and rows by just adjusting them 
out of existence, Excel does offer an easier method of hiding them, via the 
Hide & Unhide option on the Format button’s drop-down menu (located in 
the Cells group of the Home tab). Suppose that you need to hide column B 
in the worksheet because it contains some irrelevant or sensitive informa-
tion that you don’t want printed. To hide this column, you could follow these 
steps:
 
1. Click anywhere in column B to select the column.
 
2. Click the drop-down button attached to the Format button in the Cells 
group on the Home tab.
 
 Excel opens the Format button’s drop-down menu.
 
3. Click Hide & Unhide➪Hide Columns on the drop-down menu.
That’s all there is to it — column B goes poof! All the information in the 
column disappears from the worksheet. When you hide column B, notice that 
the row of column letters in the frame now reads A, C, D, E, F, and so forth.
 
You could just as well have hidden column B by right-clicking its column letter 
on the frame and then choosing the Hide command on the column’s shortcut 
menu.
Now, suppose that you’ve printed the worksheet and need to make a change 
to one of the entries in column B. To unhide the column, follow these steps:
 
1. Position the mouse pointer on column letter A in the frame and drag 
the pointer right to select both columns A and C.
 
 You must drag from A to C to include hidden column B as part of the 
column selection — don’t click while holding down the Ctrl key or you 
won’t get B.
 
2. Click the drop-down button attached to the Format button in the Cells 
group on the Home tab.
 
3. Click Hide & Unhide➪Unhide Columns on the drop-down menu.
Excel brings back the hidden B column, and all three columns (A, B, and C) 
are selected. You can then click the mouse pointer on any cell in the work-
sheet to deselect the columns.

125
 Chapter 3: Making It All Look Pretty
 
You could also unhide column B by selecting columns A through C, right-click-
ing either one of them, and then choosing the Unhide command on the column 
shortcut menu.
Hiding worksheet rows
The procedure for hiding and unhiding rows of the worksheet is essentially 
the same as for hiding and unhiding columns. The only difference is that 
after selecting the rows to hide, you click Hide & Unhide➪Hide Rows on the 
Format button’s drop-down menu and Hide & Unhide➪Unhide Rows to bring 
them back.
 
Don’t forget that you can use the Hide and Unhide options on the rows’ 
shortcut menu to make selected rows disappear and then reappear in the 
worksheet.
Futzing with the Fonts
When you start a new worksheet, Excel 2010 assigns a uniform font and type 
size to all the cell entries you make. The default font varies according to the 
version of Windows under which you’re running Excel. When you run Excel 
on Windows 7 and Vista, Excel uses its new Calibri font (the so-called Body 
Font) in 11-point size, and when running Excel under Windows XP, it uses its 
standard Arial font in a 10-point size. Although these two fonts may be fine 
for normal entries, you may want to use something with a little more zing for 
titles and headings in the worksheet.
 
If you don’t especially care for the standard font that Excel uses on your 
version of Windows, modify it from the General tab of the Excel Options 
dialog box (choose File➪Options or press Alt+FI). Look for the Use This Font 
drop-down list box (containing Body Font as the default choice) in the When 
Creating New Workbooks section and then click the name of new font you 
want to make standard from this drop-down list. If you want a different type 
size, choose the Font Size drop-down list box and click a new point size on its 
drop-down menu or enter the new point size for the standard font directly into 
the Font Size text box.
Using the buttons in the Font group on the Home tab, you can make most 
font changes (including selecting a new font style or new font size) without 
having to resort to changing the settings on the Font tab in the Format Cells 
dialog box (Ctrl+1):
 
✓ To select a new font for a cell selection, click the drop-down button next 
to the Font combo box and then select the name of the font you want to 
use from the list box. Excel displays the name of each font that appears 

126
Part II: Editing without Tears 
in this list box in the actual font named (so that the font name becomes 
an example of what the font looks like — onscreen anyway).
 
✓ To change the font size, click the drop-down button next to the Font Size 
combo box, select the new font size or click the Font Size text box, type 
the new size, and then press Enter.
You can also add bold, italic, underlining, or strikethrough to the font you 
use. The Font group of the Home tab contains the Bold, Italic, and Underline 
buttons, which not only add these attributes to a cell selection but remove 
them as well. After you click any of these attribute tools, notice that the 
tool becomes shaded whenever you position the cell cursor in the cell or 
cells that contain that attribute. When you click a selected format button to 
remove an attribute, Excel no longer shades the attribute button when you 
select the cell.
Although you’ll probably make most font changes with the Home tab on the 
Ribbon, on rare occasions you may find it more convenient to make these 
changes from the Font tab in the Format Cells dialog box (Ctrl+1).
As you can see in Figure 3-16, this Font tab in the Format Cells dialog box 
brings together under one roof fonts, font styles (bold and italics), effects 
(strikethrough, superscript, and subscript), and color changes. When you 
want to make many font-related changes to a cell selection, working in the 
Font tab may be your best bet. One of the nice things about using this tab is 
that it contains a Preview box that shows you how your font changes appear 
(onscreen at least).

127
 Chapter 3: Making It All Look Pretty
To change the color of the entries in a cell selection, click the Font Color but-
ton’s drop-down menu in the Font group on the Home tab and then select the 
color you want the text to appear in the drop-down palette. You can use Live 
Preview to see what the entries in the cell selection look like in a particular 
font color by moving the mouse pointer over the color swatches in the pal-
ette before you select one by clicking it (assuming, of course, that the palette 
doesn’t cover the cells).
 
If you change font colors and then print the worksheet with a black-and-white 
printer, Excel renders the colors as shades of gray. The Automatic option 
at the top of the Font Color button’s drop-down menu picks up the color 
assigned in Windows as the window text color. This color is black unless you 
change it in your display properties. (For help on this subject, please refer to 
Microsoft Windows XP For Dummies, Microsoft Windows Vista For Dummies, or 
Microsoft Windows 7 For Dummies all by Andy Rathbone — and be sure to tell 
Andy that Greg sent ya!)
Altering the Alignment
The horizontal alignment assigned to cell entries when you first make them is 
simply a function of the type of entry it is: All text entries are left-aligned, and 
all values are right-aligned with the borders of their cells. However, you can 
alter this standard arrangement anytime it suits you.
The Alignment group of the Home tab contains three normal horizontal align-
ment tools: the Align Left, Center, and Align Right buttons. These buttons 
align the current cell selection exactly as you expect them to. On the right 
side of the Alignment group, you usually find the special alignment button 
called Merge & Center.
Despite its rather strange name, you’ll want to get to know this button. You 
can use it to center a worksheet title across the entire width of a table in sec-
onds (or faster, depending upon your machine). I show you in Figures 3-17 
and 3-18 how you can use this tool. In Figure 3-17, notice that the worksheet 
title Mother Goose Enterprises – 2010 Sales is in cell A1. To center this title 
over the table (which extends from column A through E), select the cell range 
A1:E1 (the width of the table) and then click the Merge & Center button in the 
Alignment group on the Ribbon’s Home tab.

Look at Figure 3-18 to see the result: The cells in row 1 of columns A through 
E are merged into one cell, and now the title is properly centered in this 
“super” cell and consequently over the entire table.
 
If you ever need to split up a supercell that you’ve merged with Merge & 
Center back into its original, individual cells, select the cell and then simply 
click the Merge & Center button in the Alignment group on the Home tab 
again. You can also do this by clicking the drop-down button attached to the 
Merge & Center button on the Home tab and then clicking Unmerge Cells on 
this drop-down menu (a few more steps, I’d say!).
Intent on indents
In Excel 2010, you can indent the entries in a cell selection by clicking the 
Increase Indent button. The Increase Indent button in the Alignment group 
of the Home tab sports a picture of an arrow pushing the lines of text to the 
right. Each time you click this button, Excel indents the entries in the current 
cell selection to the right by three character widths of the standard font. (See 
the section “Futzing with the Fonts,” earlier in this chapter, if you don’t know 
what a standard font is or how to change it.)
You can remove an indent by clicking the Decrease Indent button (to the 
immediate left of the Increase Indent button) on the Home tab with the 

129
 Chapter 3: Making It All Look Pretty
picture of the arrow pushing the lines of text to the left. Additionally, you 
can change how many characters an entry indents with the Increase Indent 
button (or outdents with the Decrease Indent button). Open the Format Cells 
dialog box (Ctrl+1). Select the Alignment tab, and then alter the value in the 
Indent text box (by typing a new value in this text box or by dialing up a new 
value with its spinner buttons).

From top to bottom
Left, right, and center alignment all refer to the horizontal positioning of a text 
entry in relation to the left and right cell borders (that is, horizontally). You 
can also align entries in relation to the top and bottom borders of their cells 
(that is, vertically). Normally, all entries align vertically with the bottom of 
the cells (as though they were resting on the very bottom of the cell). You 
can also vertically center an entry in its cell or align it with the top of its cell.
To change the vertical alignment of a cell range that you’ve selected, click 
the appropriate button (Top Align, Middle Align, or Bottom Align) in the 
Alignment group on the Home tab.

Tampering with how the text wraps
Traditionally, column headings in worksheet tables have been a problem — 
you had to keep them really short or abbreviate them if you wanted to avoid 
widening all the columns more than the data warranted. You can avoid this 
problem in Excel by using the Wrap Text button in the Alignment group on 
the Home tab (the one to the immediate right of the Orientation button). In 
Figure 3-20, I show a new worksheet in which the column headings containing 
the various companies within the vast Mother Goose Enterprises conglom-
erate use the Wrap Text feature to avoid widening the columns as much as 
these long company names would otherwise require.
To create the effect shown in Figure 3-20, select the cells with the column 
headings (the cell range B2:H2) and then click the Wrap Text button in the 
Alignment group on the Home tab.

131
 Chapter 3: Making It All Look Pretty
Selecting Wrap Text breaks up the long text entries (that either spill over or 
cut off) in the selection into separate lines. To accommodate more than one 
line in a cell, the program automatically expands the row height so that the 
entire wrapped-text entry is visible.
When you select Wrap Text, Excel continues to use the horizontal and 
vertical alignment you specify for the cell. You can use any of the Horizontal 
alignment options found on the Alignment tab of the Format Cells dialog 
box (Ctrl+1), including Left (Indent), Center, Right (Indent), Justify, or 
Center Across Selection. However, you can’t use the Fill option or Distrib-
uted (Indent) option. Select the Fill option on the Horizontal drop-down list 
box only when you want Excel to repeat the entry across the entire width 
of the cell.
If you want to wrap a text entry in its cell and have Excel justify the text 
with both the left and right borders of the cell, select the Justify option from 
the Horizontal drop-down list box in the Alignment tab in the Format Cells 
dialog box.

132
Part II: Editing without Tears 
 
You can break a long text entry into separate lines by positioning the insertion 
point in the cell entry (or on the Formula bar) at the place where you want the 
new line to start and pressing Alt+Enter. Excel expands the row containing the 
cell (and the Formula bar above) when it starts a new line. When you press 
Enter to complete the entry or edit, Excel automatically wraps the text in the 
cell, according to the cell’s column width and the position of the line break.
Reorienting cell entries
Instead of wrapping text entries in cells, you may find it more beneficial to 
change the orientation of the text by rotating the text up (in a counterclock-
wise direction) or down (in a clockwise direction). Peruse Figure 3-21 for a 
situation where changing the orientation of the wrapped column headings 
works much better than just wrapping them in their normal orientation in 
the cells.
This example shows the same column headings for the sample order form I 
introduced in Figure 3-20 after rotating them 90 degrees counterclockwise. To 
make this switch, first select the cell range B2:H2. Next, click the Orientation 
button in the Alignment group on the Home tab and then click the Rotate 
Text Up option on the drop-down menu.

133
 Chapter 3: Making It All Look Pretty
Figure 3-22 shows the same headings rotated up at a 45-degree angle. To 
create what you see in this figure, you click the Angle Counterclockwise 
option on the Orientation button’s drop-down menu after making the same 
cell selection, B2:H2.
If you need to set the rotation of the entries in a spreadsheet at angles 
other than 45 and 90 degrees (up or down), you need to click the Format 
Cell Alignment option on the Orientation button’s drop-down menu. Doing 
so opens the Alignment tab of the Format Cells dialog box (or press Ctrl+1 
and click the Alignment tab) where you can then use the controls in the 
Orientation section to set the angle and number of degrees.
To set a new angle, enter the number of degrees in the Degrees text box, click 
the appropriate place on the semicircular diagram, or drag the line extending 
from the word Text in the diagram to the desired angle. 
 
To angle text up using the Degrees text box, enter a positive number between 
1 and 45 in the text box. To angle the text down, enter a negative number 
between –1 and –45.

Part II: Editing without Tears 
 
To set the text vertically so that each letter is above the other in a single 
column, click the Vertical Text option on the Orientation button’s drop-down 
menu on the Home tab.
Shrink to fit
For those times when you need to prevent Excel from widening the column 
to fit its cell entries (as might be the case when you need to display an entire 
table of data on a single screen or printed page), use the Shrink to Fit text 
control.
Click the Alignment tab of the Format Cells dialog box (Ctrl+1) and then click 
the Shrink to Fit check box in the Text Control section. Excel reduces the font 
size of the entries to the selected cells so that they don’t require changing 
the current column width. Just be aware when using this Text Control option 
that, depending on the length of the entries and width of the column, you can 
end up with some text entries so small that they’re completely illegible!
Bring on the borders!
The gridlines you normally see in the worksheet to separate the columns 
and rows are just guidelines to help you keep your place as you build your 
spreadsheet. You can choose to print them with your data or not (by check-
ing or clearing the Print check box that appears in the Gridlines section of 
the Sheet Options group on the Page Layout tab). 
To emphasize sections of the worksheet or parts of a particular table, you 
can add borderlines or shading to certain cells. Don’t confuse the borderlines 
that you add to accent a particular cell selection with the gridlines used to 
define cell borders in the worksheet — borders that you add print regardless 
of whether you print the worksheet gridlines.
 
To see the borders that you add to the cells in a worksheet, remove the grid-
lines normally displayed in the worksheet by clearing the View check box in 
the Gridlines section of the Sheet Options group on the Page Layout tab.
To add borders to a cell selection, click the drop-down button attached to 
the Borders button in the Font group on the Home tab. This displays a drop-
down menu with all the border options you can apply to the cell selection 
(see Figure 3-23) where you click the type of line you want to apply to all 
its cells.

135
 Chapter 3: Making It All Look Pretty
 
Figure 3-23: 
Select 
borders for

tion with the 
Borders but-
ton on the 
Home tab.
 
When selecting options on this drop-down menu to determine where you 
want the borderlines drawn, keep these things in mind:
 
✓ To have Excel draw borders only around the outside edges of the entire 
cell selection (in other words, following the path of the expanded cell 
cursor), click the Outside Borders or the Thick Box Border options on 
this menu. To draw the outside borders yourself around an unselected 
cell range in the active worksheet, click the Draw Border option, drag 
the mouse (using the Pencil mouse pointer) through the range of cells, 
and then click the Borders button on the Home tab’s Font group.
 
✓ If you want borderlines to appear around all four edges of each cell in 
the cell selection (like a paned window), select the All Borders option 
on this drop-down menu. If you want to draw the inside and outside bor-
ders yourself around an unselected cell range in the active worksheet, 
click the Draw Border Grid option, drag the mouse (using the Pencil 
mouse pointer) through the range of cells, and then click the Borders 
button on the Home tab.
To change the type of line, line thickness, or color of the borders you apply 
to a cell selection, you must open the Format Cells dialog box and use the 
options on its Border tab (click More Borders at the bottom of the Borders 
button’s drop-down menu or press Ctrl+1 and then click the Border tab).

136
Part II: Editing without Tears 
To select a new line thickness or line style for a border you’re applying, click 
its example in the Style section. To change the color of the border you want 
to apply, click the color sample on the Color drop-down palette. After you 
select a new line style and/or color, apply the border to the cell selection by 
clicking the appropriate line in either the Presets or Border section of the 
Border tab before you click OK.
 
To get rid of existing borders in a worksheet, you must select the cell or cells 
that presently contain them and then click the No Border option at the top of 
the second section on the Borders button’s drop-down menu.
Applying fill colors, patterns, 
and gradient effects to cells
You can also add emphasis to particular sections of the worksheet or one of 
its tables by changing the fill color of the cell selection and/or applying a pat-
tern or gradient to it.
 
If you’re using a black-and-white printer, you want to restrict your color 
choices to light gray in the color palette. Additionally, you want to restrict 
your use of pattern styles to the very open ones with few dots when enhanc-
ing a cell selection that contains any kind of entries (otherwise, the entries will 
be almost impossible to read when printed).
To choose a new fill color for the background of a cell selection, you can 
click the Fill Color button’s drop-down menu in the Font group on the Home 
tab and then select the color you want to use in the drop-down palette. 
Remember that you can use Live Preview to see what the cell selection looks 
like in a particular fill color by moving the mouse pointer over the color 
swatches. Click one to select it.
To choose a new pattern for a cell selection, you must open the Format Cells 
dialog box (Ctrl+1), and then click the Fill tab. To change the pattern of the 
cell selection, click a pattern swatch from the Pattern Style button’s pattern 
palette. To add a fill color to the pattern you select, click its color swatch in 
the Background Color section of the Fill tab.
If you want to add a gradient effect to the cell selection that goes from one 
color to another in a certain direction, click the Fill Effects button on the 
Fill tab to open the Fill Effects dialog box (see Figure 3-24). This dialog box 
contains a Gradient tab with controls that enable you to determine the two 
colors to use as well as shading style and variant. 

137
 Chapter 3: Making It All Look Pretty
 
Figure 3-24: 
Select a 
new gradi-
ent for a cell

dialog box.
 
After you select the colors and styles of the gradient, check the Sample 
swatch in the Fill Effects dialog box. When you have it the way you want it, 
click OK to close the Fill Effects dialog box and return to the Format Cells 
dialog box. The selected gradient effect then appears in its Sample area on 
the Fill tab in the Format Cells dialog box. Unfortunately, this is one area 
where Live Preview doesn’t work, so you’re just going to have to click its OK 
button to apply the gradient to the cell selection to see how it actually looks 
in the worksheet.
 
Although you can’t select new patterns or gradients (only colors) with the Fill 
Color button on the Home tab, you can remove fill colors, patterns, and gradi-
ents assigned to a cell selection by clicking the No Fill option on the Fill Color 
button’s drop-down menu.
Do It in Styles
In Excel 2010, cell styles really come alive in the form of the new Cell Styles 
gallery that you open by clicking the Cell Styles button in the Styles group on 
the Home tab. The Cell Styles gallery contains loads of readymade styles you 
can immediately apply to the current cell selection. Simply click the desired 
style sample in the gallery after using the Live Preview feature to determine 
which style looks best on your data.

138
Part II: Editing without Tears 
Creating a new style for the gallery
To create a new style for the gallery by example, manually format a single 
cell with all the attributes you want (font, font size, font color, bold, italic, 
underlining, fill color, pattern, borders, orientation, and so on) and then click 
the Cell Styles button on the Home tab followed by the New Cell Style option 
at the bottom of the gallery. Excel then opens a Style dialog box where you 
replace the generic style name (Style 1, Style 2, and so on) with your own 
descriptive name before you click OK. 
Excel then adds a sample of your new style — the style name formatted, with 
the new style’s attributes — to a Custom section at the top of the Cell Styles 
gallery. To apply this custom style to a cell selection, you then only have to 
click its sample in the Custom section of the Cell Styles gallery.
 
The custom cell styles you create don’t become part of the current workbook 
until the next time you save the workbook. Therefore, you need to remember 
to click the Save button on the Quick Access toolbar or press Ctrl+S to save 
your changes after creating a new cell style if you want that style to remain 
part of the workbook’s Cell Styles gallery the next time you open the work-
book in Excel.
Copying custom styles from 
one workbook into another
Excel makes it easy to copy custom cell styles that you’ve saved as part 
of one workbook into the workbook you’re currently working on. To copy 
custom styles from one workbook to another, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the workbook that needs the custom styles added to it from 
another existing workbook.
 
 This can be a brand new workbook or one that you’ve opened for editing 
(see Chapter 4).
 
2. Open the workbook that has the custom styles you want to copy saved 
as part of it.
 
 See the previous section, “Creating a new style for the gallery” for tips 
on how to create and save cell styles.
 
3. Switch back to the workbook into which you want to copy the saved 
custom styles.
 
 You can do this by clicking the workbook’s button on the Windows 
taskbar or using the Flip feature by pressing Alt+Tab until you select the 
workbook’s thumbnail in the center of the display.

139
 Chapter 3: Making It All Look Pretty
 
4. Click the Cell Styles button on the Home tab followed by Merge Styles 
in the Cell Styles gallery or press Alt+HJM.
 
 Excel opens the Merge Styles dialog box.
 
5. Click the name of the open workbook file that contains the custom 
styles to copy in the Merge Styles From list box and then click OK.
After you close the Merge Styles dialog box, Excel adds all the custom styles 
from the designated workbook into the current workbook adding it to the 
Custom section of its Cell Styles gallery. To retain the custom styles you 
just imported, save the current workbook (Save button on the Quick Access 
toolbar or Ctrl+S). Then, you can switch back to the workbook containing the 
original custom styles you just copied and close its file (Alt+FC).
Fooling Around with the Format Painter
Using cell styles to format ranges of worksheet cells is certainly the way to 
go when you have to apply the same formatting repeatedly in the workbooks 
you create. However, there may be times when you simply want to reuse 
a particular cell format and apply it to particular groups of cells in a single 
workbook without ever bothering to open the Cell Styles gallery.
For those occasions when you feel the urge to format on the fly (so to speak), 
use the Format Painter button (the paintbrush icon) in the Clipboard group 
on the Home tab. This wonderful little tool enables you to take the formatting 
from a particular cell that you fancy up and apply its formatting to other cells 
in the worksheet simply by selecting those cells.
To use the Format Painter to copy a cell’s formatting to other worksheet 
cells, just follow these easy steps:
 
1. Format an example cell or cell range in your workbook, selecting 
whatever fonts, alignment, borders, patterns, and color you want it to 
have.
 
2. With the cell cursor in one of the cells you just fancied up, click the 
Format Painter button in the Clipboard group on the Home tab.
 
 The mouse pointer changes from the standard thick, white cross to a 
thick, white cross with an animated paintbrush by its side, and you see a 
marquee around the selected cell with the formatting to be used by the 
Format Painter.
 
3. Drag the white-cross-plus-animated-paintbrush pointer (the Format 
Painter pointer) through all the cells you want to format.
 
 As soon as you release the mouse button, Excel applies all the format-
ting used in the example cell to all the cells you just selected!

140
Part II: Editing without Tears 
To keep the Format Painter selected so that you can format a bunch of dif-
ferent cell ranges with the Format Painter pointer, double-click the Format 
Painter button on the Home tab after you select the sample cell with the 
desired formatting. To stop formatting cells with the Format Painter pointer, 
you simply click the Format Painter button on the Home tab again (it remains 
selected when you double-click it) to restore the button to its unselected 
state and return the mouse pointer to its normal thick, white cross shape.
 
You can use the Format Painter to restore a cell range that you gussied all up 
back to its boring default (General) cell format. To do this, click an empty, pre-
viously unformatted cell in the worksheet before you click the Format Painter 
button and then use the Format Painter pointer to drag through the cells you 
want returned to the default General format.
Conditional Formatting
Before leaving behind the scintillating subject of cell formatting, there’s one 
more formatting button in the Styles group of the Home tab of which you 
need to be aware. The Conditional Formatting button enables you to apply 
provisional formatting to a cell range based solely on the categories into 
which its current values fall. The cool thing about this kind of conditional 
formatting is that should you edit the numbers in the cell range so that their 
values fall into other categories, the program automatically changes their cell 
formatting to suit.
When you click the Conditional Formatting button in the Styles group of the 
Home tab, a drop-down menu appears with the following options:
 
✓ Highlight Cells Rules opens a continuation menu with various options 
for defining formatting rules that highlight the cells in the cell selection 
that contain certain values, text, or dates; that have values greater or 
less than a particular value; or that fall within a certain ranges of values.
 
✓ Top/Bottom Rules opens a continuation menu with various options for 
defining formatting rules that highlight the top and bottom values, per-
centages, and above and below average values in the cell selection.
 
✓ Data Bars opens a palette with different color data bars that you can 
apply to the cell selection to indicate their values relative to each other 
by clicking the data bar thumbnail.
 
✓ Color Scales opens a palette with different two- and three-colored scales 
that you can apply to the cell selection to indicate their values relative 
to each other by clicking the color scale thumbnail.

141
 Chapter 3: Making It All Look Pretty
 
✓ Icon Sets opens a palette with different sets of icons that you can apply 
to the cell selection to indicate their values relative to each other by 
clicking the icon set.
 
✓ New Rule opens the New Formatting Rule dialog box where you define a 
custom conditional formatting rule to apply to the cell selection.
 
✓ Clear Rules opens a continuation menu where you can remove condi-
tional formatting rules for the cell selection by clicking the Clear Rules 
from Selected Cells option, for the entire worksheet by clicking the Clear 
Rules from Entire Sheet option, or for just the current data table by 
clicking the Clear Rules from This Table option.
 
✓ Manage Rules opens the Conditional Formatting Rules Manager dialog 
box where you edit and delete particular rules as well as adjust their 
rule precedence by moving them up or down in the Rules list box.
Conditionally formatting values with sets 
of graphic scales and markers
The easiest conditional formatting that you can apply to a worksheet cell 
range is using the pop-up palettes of graphical scales and markers attached 
to the Data Bars, Color Scales, and Icon Sets options on the Conditional 
Formatting button’s drop-down menu:
 
✓ Data Bars represents the relative values in the cell selection by the 
length of the color bar in each cell and are great for helping you quickly 
spot the lower and higher values within a large range of data.
 
✓ Color Scales classify the relative values in a cell selection with a color 
gradation using a one-, two-, or three-color scale and are great for identi-
fying the distribution of values across a large range of data.
 
✓ Icon Sets classify the values in the cell selection into three to five cat-
egories and each icon within the set represents a range of values that go 
from high to low. Icon sets are great for quickly identifying the different 
ranges of values in a range of data.
Figure 3-25 shows you an example of cell ranges (containing identical values) 
using each of the three formatting types. The values in the first range 
(B2:B12) are conditionally formatted using blue Gradient Fill Data Bars. The 
values in the second range (D2:D12) are conditionally formatted using the 
Green, Yellow, Red Color Scale. The values in the third range (F2:F12) are 
conditionally formatted using the 3 Arrows Directional Icon set.

ted with 
Excel’s Data 
Bars, Color 
Scales, and

options.
 
In Figure 3-25, the particular conditional formatting types Excel assigned to 
each cell range can be interpreted as follows:
 
✓ Data bars added to the cells in the first cell range, B2:B12, represent the 
relative size of its values graphically, much like a standard bar chart.
 
✓ Color scale applied to the second range, D2:D12, represent the relative 
size of the values in the range by color and hue (red hues applied to 
the lower values, yellow to the middle values, and green to the higher 
values).
 
✓ Directional icons applied to the third cell range, F2:F12, represent the 
relative size of the values in the range with arrow icons pointing in dif-
ferent directions (arrows pointing straight down for the lower values, 
straight up for the higher values, and sideways for middling values).
Highlighting cells according to what 
ranges the values fall into
The Highlight Cells Rules and Top/Bottom Rules options on Excel’s 
Conditional Formatting drop-down menu enable you to quickly identify cell 
entries of particular interest in various cell ranges in your worksheet.

143
 Chapter 3: Making It All Look Pretty
The options on the Highlight Cells Rules continuation menu enable you to set 
formats that identify values that are greater than, less than, equal to, or even 
between particular values that you set. This menu also contains an option for 
setting special formats for identifying cells that contain particular text (such 
as Yes, No, or even Maybe answers in a data list) or certain dates (such as 
project milestones and deadlines).
 
Perhaps one of the most useful options on the Highlight Cells Rules continu-
ation menu is the Duplicate Values option that enables you to flag duplicate 
entries in a cell range by assigning them a special formatting. Doing this not 
only makes it easy to visually identify duplicate entries in a data list or table 
but also to find them electronically by searching for their particular formatting 
characteristics. (See Chapter 6 for details on searching your worksheets.)
The options on the Top/Bottom Rules continuation menu enable you to spe-
cially format and, therefore, easily identify values in data tables and lists that 
are either above or below the norm. These options not only include those 
for automatically formatting all values in a range that are among the top 10 
highest or lowest (either in value or percentage) but also above or below the 
average (as calculated by dividing the total by the number of values).
 
In addition to using the ready-made rules for conditional formatting located on 
the Highlight Cells Rules and Top/Bottom Rules continuation menus, you can 
also create your own custom rules. When you create a custom rule, you not 
only specify the rule type that identifies which values or text entries to format, 
but also you format the colors and other aspects included in the formatting. 
(For details on creating custom conditional formats, consult my Excel 2010 All-
in-One For Dummies.)

P
icture this: You just finished creating, formatting, and printing a major 
project with Excel — a workbook with your department’s budget for 
the next fiscal year. Because you finally understand a little bit about how the 
Excel thing works, you finish the job in crack time. You’re actually ahead of 
schedule.
You turn the workbook over to your boss so that she can check the num-
bers. With plenty of time for making those inevitable last-minute corrections, 
you’re feeling on top of this situation.
Then comes the reality check — your boss brings the document back, and 
she’s plainly agitated. “We forgot to include the estimates for the temps and 
our overtime hours. They go right here. While you’re adding them, can you 
move these rows of figures up and those columns over?”
As she continues to suggest improvements, your heart begins to sink. These 
modifications are in a different league than, “Let’s change these column head-
ings from bold to italic and add shading to that row of totals.” Clearly, you’re 
looking at a lot more work on this baby than you had contemplated. Even 
worse, you’re looking at making structural changes that threaten to unravel 
the very fabric of your beautiful worksheet.

146
Part II: Editing without Tears 
As the preceding fable points out, editing a worksheet in a workbook can 
occur on different levels:
 
✓ You can make changes that affect the contents of the cells, such as 
copying a row of column headings or moving a table to a new area in a 
particular worksheet.
 
✓ You can make changes that affect the structure of a worksheet itself, 
such as inserting new columns or rows (so that you can enter new data 
originally left out) or deleting unnecessary columns or rows from an 
existing table so that you don’t leave any gaps.
 
✓ You can even make changes to the number of worksheets in a workbook 
(by either adding or deleting sheets).
In this chapter, you discover how to make these types of changes safely to a 
workbook. As you see, the mechanics of copying and moving data or insert-
ing and deleting rows are simple to master. It’s the impact that such actions 
have on the worksheet that takes a little more effort to understand. Not to 
worry! You always have the Undo feature to fall back on for those (hopefully 
rare) times when you make a little tiny change that throws an entire work-
sheet into complete and utter chaos.
In the final section of this chapter (“Stamping Out Errors with Text to 
Speech”), find out how to use the Text to Speech feature to check out and 
confirm the accuracy of the data entries you make in your worksheets. 
With Text to Speech, you can listen to your computer read back a series of 
cell entries while you visually corroborate their accuracy from the original 
source document. Text to Speech can make this sort of routine and otherwise 
labor-intensive editing much easier and greatly increase the accuracy of your 
spreadsheets.
Opening the Darned Thing Up for Editing
Before you can do any damage — I mean, make any changes — in a work-
book, you have to open it up in Excel. To open a workbook, you can choose 
File➪Open, press Alt+FO, or use the old standby keyboard shortcuts Ctrl+O 
or Ctrl+F12.
Operating the Open dialog box
If you’re running Excel 2010 under Windows 7, an Open dialog box very much 
like the one in Figure 4-1 appears. This dialog box is divided into panes: the 
Navigation pane on the left where you can select a new folder to open and 

147
 Chapter 4: Going Through Changes
the main pane on the right showing the icons for all the subfolders in the cur-
rent folder as well as the documents that Excel can open.
 
Figure 4-1: 
Use the 
Open dialog 
box to find 
and open a 
workbook 
for editing.
 
Change your view
The folder with contents displayed in the Open dialog box is either the one 
designated as the Default File Location on the Save tab of the Excel Options 
dialog box or the folder you last opened during your current Excel work ses-
sion. If you haven’t changed the default folder location since installing Excel 
2010 on your computer, this default folder is the Documents Library (simply 
referred to as Documents in Windows Vista).
 
If you’re running Excel 2010 on Windows Vista, your Open dialog box is similar 
to the one shown in Figure 4-1 except that your Navigation pane contains a 
Folders item instead of Libraries under your list of Favorites. Additionally, the 
Views button appears between the Organize and New Folder buttons and not 
to their right above the Navigation and main panes.
To open a workbook in another folder, click its link in the Favorite Links sec-
tion of the Navigation pane or click the Expand Folders button (the one with 
the triangle pointing upward) and click its folder in this list.
If you open a new folder and it appears empty of all files (and you know that 
it’s not an empty folder), this just means the folder doesn’t contain any of 
the types of files that Excel can open directly (such as workbooks, template 

148
Part II: Editing without Tears 
files, and macro sheets). To display all the files whether or not Excel can 
open them directly (meaning without some sort of conversion), click the 
drop-down button that appears next to the drop-down list box that currently 
displays All Excel Files and then click All Files on its drop-down menu.
When the icon for the workbook file you want to work with appears in the 
Open dialog box, you can then open it either by clicking its file icon and then 
clicking the Open button or, if you’re handy with the mouse, by just double-
clicking the file icon.
 
You can use the slider attached to the Views drop-down list button in the 
Open dialog box to change the way folder and file icons appear in the dialog 
box. When you select Large Icons or Extra Large Icons on this slider (or any-
where in between), the Excel workbook icons actually show a preview of the 
data in the upper-left corner of the first worksheet when the file is saved with 
the preview picture option turned on:
 
✓ To enable the preview feature when saving workbooks in Excel 2010, 
select the Save Thumbnail check box in the Save As dialog box before 
saving the file for the first time.
 
✓ To enable the preview feature when saving workbooks in Excel 97 
through 2003, click the Save Preview Picture check box on the Summary 
tab of the workbook’s Properties dialog box (File➪Properties) before 
saving the file for the first time.
This preview of part of the first sheet can help you quickly identify the work-
book you want to open for editing or printing.
Opening more than one 
workbook at a time
If you know that you’re going to edit more than one of the workbook files 
shown in the list box of the Open dialog box, you can select multiple files in 
the list box and Excel will then open all of them (in the order they’re listed) 
when you click the Open button or press Enter.
 
Remember that in order to select multiple files that appear sequentially in the 
Open dialog box, you click the first filename and then hold down the Shift key 
while you click the last filename. To select files that aren’t listed sequentially, 
you need to hold down the Ctrl key while you click the various filenames.
After the workbook files are open in Excel, you can then switch documents 
by selecting their filename buttons on the Windows taskbar or by using the 
Flip feature (Alt+Tab) to select the workbook’s thumbnail. (See Chapter 7 for 
detailed information on working on more than one worksheet at a time.)

 Chapter 4: Going Through Changes
Opening recently edited workbooks 
If you know that the workbook you now need to edit is one of those that you 
opened recently, you don’t even have to fool around with the Open dialog 
box. Just choose File➪Recent to display a Recent Workbooks list to the right 
of the pull-down menu (or press Alt+FR) and then click the name of the work-
book to open for editing.
 
When you open the Recent Workbooks list by pressing Alt+FR, Excel displays 
the number hot keys to each of the recently opened spreadsheet files in 
the list and you then can open the one you need to edit simply by typing its 
number.
Excel 2010 automatically keeps a running list of the last 20 files you opened 
in the Recent Workbooks list on the File tab. If you want, you can have Excel 
display more or fewer files in this list on the File tab.
To change the number of recently opened files that appear, follow these 
simple steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Options➪Advanced or press Alt+FIA to open the 
Advanced tab of the Excel Options dialog box.
 
2. Type a new entry (between 1 and 50) in the Show This Number of 
Recent Documents text box or use the spinner buttons to increase or 
decrease this number.
 
3. Click OK or press Enter to close the Excel Options dialog box.
The Open dialog box in Excel 2010 
running on Windows XP
The Open dialog box for Windows XP is 
arranged a bit differently from the one in 
Windows 7 and Windows Vista. This Open 
dialog box is divided into two sections: a My 
Places panel on the left and a folder and file list 
box on the right. If the folder open in the list box 
is not the one that has the workbook file you 
need to use, use the Up One Level button in the 
Open dialog box to change levels until you see 
the folder you want to open. Use the buttons 
displayed in the My Places panel on the left side 
of the Open dialog box (My Recent Documents, 
Desktop, My Documents, My Computer, and My 
Network Places) to open any folders associated 
with these buttons that contain workbook files.
When you locate the file that you want to use 
in the list box in the Open dialog box, open it by 
clicking its file icon and then clicking the Open 
button or pressing Enter (or by double-clicking 
the file icon). 

150
Part II: Editing without Tears 
 
If you don’t want any files displayed in the Recent Workbooks list on the File 
tab, enter 0 in the Show This Number of Recent Documents text box or select 
it with the spinner buttons.
 
Select the Quickly Access This Number of Recent Workbooks check box on 
the Recent Workbooks panel in the Backstage View to have Excel display the 
four most recently opened workbooks as items on the File tab. That way, you 
can open any of them by clicking its button without having to open the Recent 
Workbooks panel. After selecting the Quickly Access This Number of Recent 
Workbooks check box, you change the number of recently opened workbooks 
added to the File tab by entering the new number in its text box or selecting 
the number with its spinner buttons.
When you don’t know where to find them
The only problem you can encounter in opening a document from the Open 
dialog box is locating the filename. Everything’s hunky-dory as long as you 
can see the workbook filename listed in the Open dialog box or know which 
folder to open in order to display it. But what about those times when a file 
seems to migrate mysteriously and can’t be found on your computer?
When you run Excel 2010 under Windows 7 or Vista, the operating system 
adds a Search Documents text box (simply called Search in Vista) to the 
Open dialog box (see Figure 4-2). You can use this text box to search for 
missing workbooks from within the Open dialog box.
 
Figure 4-2: 
Use the 
Search 
Documents 
text box in 
the Open 
dialog box 
to quickly 
search for 
any Excel 
workbook 
on your 
computer.
 

151
 Chapter 4: Going Through Changes
To find a missing workbook, click this search text box in the upper-right 
corner of the Open dialog box and then begin typing characters used in the 
workbook’s filename or contained in the workbook itself. 
As Windows finds any matches for the characters you type, the names of the 
workbook files (and other Excel files such as templates and macro sheets as 
well) appear in the Open dialog box. As soon as the workbook you want to 
open is listed, you can open it by clicking its icon and filename followed by 
the Open button or by double-clicking it.
 
The Open dialog box in Excel 2010 when running under Windows XP does not 
have a search feature built in to it. This means that to search for missing work-
books, you have to do it outside Excel by using Windows XP’s search feature 
available on its Start menu.
Opening files with a twist
The drop-down button attached to the Open command button at the bottom 
of the Open dialog box enables you to open the selected workbook file(s) in a 
special way, including:
 
✓ Open Read-Only: This command opens the files you select in the Open 
dialog box’s list box in a read-only state, which means that you can look 
but you can’t touch. (Actually, you can touch; you just can’t save your 
changes.) To save changes in a read-only file, you must use the Save As 
command (File➪Save As or Alt+FA) and give the workbook file a new file-
name. (Refer to Chapter 2.)
 
✓ Open as Copy: This command opens a copy of the files you select in the 
Open dialog box. Use this method of opening files as a safety net: If you 
mess up the copies, you always have the originals to fall back on.
 
✓ Open in Browser: This command opens workbook files you save as Web 
pages (which I describe in Chapter 12) in your favorite Web browser. 
This command isn’t available unless the program identifies that the 
selected file or files were saved as Web pages rather than plain old Excel 
workbook files.
 
✓ Open in Protected View: This command opens the workbook file in 
Protected View mode that keeps you from making any changes to the 
contents of its worksheets until you click the Enable Editing button that 
appears in the orange Protected View panel at the top of the screen.
 
✓ Open and Repair: This command attempts to repair corrupted work-
book files before opening them in Excel. When you select this command, 
a dialog box appears giving you a choice between attempting to repair 

152
Part II: Editing without Tears 
the corrupted file or opening the recovered version, extracting data 
from the corrupted file, and placing it in a new workbook (which you 
can save with the Save command). Click the Repair button to attempt 
to recover and open the file. Click the Extract Data button if you tried 
unsuccessfully to have Excel repair the file.
Much Ado about Undo
Before you start tearing into the workbook that you just opened, get to know 
the Undo feature, including how it can put right many of the things that 
you could inadvertently mess up. The Undo command button on the Quick 
Access toolbar is a regular chameleon button. When you delete the cell selec-
tion by pressing the Delete key, the Undo button’s ScreenTip reads Undo 
Clear (Ctrl+Z). If you move some entries to a new part of the worksheet by 
dragging it, the Undo command button ScreenTip changes to Undo Drag and 
Drop (Ctrl+Z).
In addition to clicking the Undo command button (in whatever guise it 
appears), you can also choose this command by pressing Ctrl+Z (perhaps for 
unZap).
 
The Undo command button on the Quick Access toolbar changes in response 
to whatever action you just took; that is, it changes after each action. If you 
forget to strike when the iron is hot, so to speak, and don’t use the Undo feature 
to restore the worksheet to its previous state before you choose another com-
mand, you then need to consult the drop-down menu on the Undo button. Click 
its drop-down button that appears to the right of the Undo icon (the curved 
arrow pointing to the left). After the Undo drop-down menu appears, click the 
action on this menu that you want undone. Excel will then undo this action and 
all actions that precede it in the list (which are selected automatically).
Undo is Redo the second time around
After using the Undo command button on the Quick Access toolbar, Excel 
2010 activates the Redo command button to its immediate right. If you delete 
an entry from a cell by pressing the Delete key and then click the Undo com-
mand button or press Ctrl+Z, the ScreenTip that appears when you position 
the mouse pointer over the Redo command button reads Redo Clear (Ctrl+Y).
When you click the Redo command button or press Ctrl+Y, Excel redoes the 
thing you just undid. Actually, this sounds more complicated than it is. It 
simply means that you use Undo to switch between the result of an action 
and the state of the worksheet just before that action until you decide how 
you want the worksheet (or until the cleaning crew turns off the lights and 
locks up the building).

153
 Chapter 4: Going Through Changes
What ya gonna do when you can’t Undo?
 
Just when you think it is safe to begin gutting the company’s most important 
workbook, I really feel that I have to tell you that (yikes!) Undo doesn’t work 
all the time! Although you can undo your latest erroneous cell deletion, bad 
move, or unwise copy, you can’t undo your latest rash save. (You know, like 
when you meant to choose Save As from the File tab to save the edited work-
sheet under a different document name but chose Save and ended up saving 
the changes as part of the current document.)
Unfortunately, Excel doesn’t let you know when you are about to take a step 
from which there is no return — until it’s too late. After you’ve gone and 
done the un-undoable and you click the Undo button where you expect its 
ScreenTip to say Undo blah, blah, it now reads Can’t Undo.
One exception to this rule is when the program gives you advance warning 
(which you should heed). When you choose a command that is normally pos-
sible but because you’re low on memory or the change will affect so much 
of the worksheet, or both, Excel knows that it can’t undo the change if it 
goes through with it, the program displays an alert box telling you that there 
isn’t enough memory to undo this action and asking whether you want to go 
ahead anyway. If you click the Yes button and complete the edit, just realize 
that you do so without any possibility of pardon. If you find out, too late, that 
you deleted a row of essential formulas (that you forgot about because you 
couldn’t see them), you can’t bring them back with Undo. In such a case, you 
would have to close the file (File➪Close) and NOT save your changes.
Doing the Old Drag-and-Drop Thing
The first editing technique you need to learn is drag and drop. As the name 
implies, you can use this mouse technique to pick up a cell selection and 
drop it into a new place on the worksheet. Although drag and drop is primar-
ily a technique for moving cell entries around a worksheet, you can adapt it 
to copy a cell selection, as well.
To use drag and drop to move a range of cell entries (one cell range at a 
time), follow these steps:
 
1. Select a cell range.
 
2. Position the mouse pointer on one edge of the extended cell cursor 
that now surrounds the entire cell range.
 
 Your signal that you can start dragging the cell range to its new position 
in the worksheet is when the pointer changes to the arrowhead.

154
Part II: Editing without Tears 
 
3. Drag your selection to its destination.
 
 Drag your selection by depressing and holding down the primary mouse 
button — usually the left one — while moving the mouse.
 
 While you drag your selection, you actually move only the outline of 
the cell range, and Excel keeps you informed of what the new cell range 
address would be (as a kind of drag-and-drop ScreenTip) if you were to 
release the mouse button at that location.
 
 Drag the outline until it’s positioned where you want the entries to 
appear (as evidenced by the cell range in the drag-and-drop ScreenTip).
 
4. Release the mouse button.
 
 The cell entries within that range reappear in the new location as soon 
as you release the mouse button.
In Figures 4-3 and 4-4, I show how you can drag and drop a cell range. In 
Figure 4-3, I select the cell range A10:E10 (containing the quarterly totals) 
to move it to row 12 to make room for sales figures for two new companies 
(Simple Simon Pie Shoppes and Jack Be Nimble Candlesticks, which hadn’t 
been acquired when this workbook was first created). In Figure 4-4, you see 
the Mother Goose Enterprises – 2010 Sales worksheet right after completing 
this move.
 
Figure 4-3: 
Dragging 
the cell 
selection 
to its new 
position in a 
worksheet.
 
 
The arguments for the SUM functions in cell range B13:E13 do not keep pace 
with the change — it continues to sum only the values in rows 3 through 
9 after the move. However, when you enter the sales figures for these new 
enterprises in columns B through C in rows 10, 11, and 12, Excel shows off 
its smarts and updates the formulas in row 13 to include the new entries. For 
example, the SUM(B3:B9) formula in B13 magically becomes SUM(B3:B12).

155
 Chapter 4: Going Through Changes

A worksheet

ping the cell 
selection

Copies, drag-and-drop style
What if you want to copy rather than drag and drop a cell range? Suppose 
that you need to start a new table in rows farther down the worksheet, and 
you want to copy the cell range with the formatted title and column headings 
for the new table. To copy the formatted title range in the sample worksheet, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Select the cell range.
 
 In the case of Figures 4-3 and 4-4, that’s cell range A1:E2.
 
2. Hold the Ctrl key down while you position the mouse pointer on an 
edge of the selection (that is, the expanded cell cursor).
 
 The pointer changes from a thick, shaded cross to an arrowhead with a 
+ (plus sign) to the right of it with the drag-and-drop ScreenTip beside 
it. The plus sign next to the pointer is your signal that drag and drop will 
copy the selection rather than move it.
 
3. Drag the cell-selection outline to the place where you want the copy to 
appear and release the mouse button.
 
If, when using drag and drop to move or copy cells, you position the outline of 
the selection so that it overlaps any part of cells that already contain entries, 
Excel displays an alert box that asks whether you want to replace the contents 
of the destination cells. To avoid replacing existing entries and to abort the 
entire drag-and-drop mission, click the Cancel button in this alert box. To go 
ahead and exterminate the little darlings, click OK or press Enter.

156
Part II: Editing without Tears 
Insertions courtesy of drag and drop
Like the Klingons of Star Trek fame, spreadsheets, such as Excel, never take 
prisoners. When you place or move a new entry into an occupied cell, the 
new entry completely replaces the old as though the old entry never existed 
in that cell.
To insert the cell range you’re moving or copying within a populated region 
of the worksheet without wiping out existing entries, hold down the Shift key 
while you drag the selection. (If you’re copying, you have to get ambitious 
and hold down both the Shift and Ctrl keys at the same time!)
With the Shift key depressed while you drag, instead of a rectangular outline 
of the cell range, you get an I-beam shape that shows where the selection will 
be inserted if you release the mouse button along with the address of the cell 
range (as a kind of Insertion ScreenTip). When you move the I-beam shape, 
notice that it wants to attach itself to the column and row borders while you 
move it. After you position the I-beam at the column or row border where 
you want to insert the cell range, release the mouse button. Excel inserts 
the cell range, moving the existing entries to neighboring blank cells (out of 
harm’s way).
 
When inserting cells with drag and drop, it may be helpful to think of the 
I-beam shape as a pry bar that pulls apart the columns or rows along the axis 
of the I. Also, sometimes after moving a range to a new place in the worksheet, 
instead of the data appearing, you see only #######s in the cells. (Excel 2010 
doesn’t automatically widen the new columns for the incoming data as it does 
when formatting the data.) Remember that the way to get rid of the #######s 
in the cells is by widening those troublesome columns enough to display all 
the data-plus-formatting; and the easiest way to do this kind of widening is by 
double-clicking the right border of the column.
I held down the Shift key just as you said . . .
Drag and drop in Insert mode is one of Excel’s 
most finicky features. Sometimes you can do 
everything just right and still get the alert box 
warning you that Excel is about to replace exist-
ing entries instead of pushing them aside. When 
you see this alert box, always click the Cancel 
button! Fortunately, you can insert things with 
the Insert commands without worrying about 
which way the I-beam selection goes (see the 
“Staying In Step with Insert” section, later in 
this chapter).

157
 Chapter 4: Going Through Changes
Formulas on AutoFill
Copying with drag and drop (by holding down the Ctrl key) is useful when 
you need to copy a bunch of neighboring cells to a new part of the work-
sheet. Frequently, however, you just need to copy a single formula that you 
just created to a bunch of neighboring cells that need to perform the same 
type of calculation (such as totaling columns of figures). This type of formula 
copy, although quite common, can’t be done with drag and drop. Instead, use 
the AutoFill feature (read about this in Chapter 2) or the Copy and Paste com-
mands. (See the section “Cut and paste, digital style” later in this chapter.)
Here’s how you can use AutoFill to copy one formula to a range of cells. In 
Figure 4-5, you can see the Mother Goose Enterprises – 2010 Sales worksheet 
with all the companies but this time with only one monthly total in row 12, 
which is in the process of being copied through cell E12. 
 
Figure 4-5: 
Copying 
a formula 
to a cell 
range with 
AutoFill.
 
Figure 4-6 shows the worksheet after dragging the fill handle in cell B12 to 
select the cell range C12:E12 (where this formula should be copied). 
Relatively speaking
Figure 4-6 shows the worksheet after the formula in a cell is copied to the cell 
range C12:E12 and cell B12 is active. Notice how Excel handles the copying of 
formulas. The original formula in cell B12 is as follows:
=SUM(B3:B11)

158
Part II: Editing without Tears 
 
Figure 4-6: 
The work-
sheet after 
copying 
the formula 
totaling the 
monthly 
(and quar-
terly) sales.
 
When the original formula is copied to cell C12, Excel changes the formula 
slightly so that it looks like this:
=SUM(C3:C11)
Excel adjusts the column reference, changing it from B to C, because I copied 
from left to right across the rows.
When you copy a formula to a cell range that extends down the rows, Excel 
adjusts the row numbers in the copied formulas rather than the column 
letters to suit the position of each copy. For example, cell E3 in the Mother 
Goose Enterprises – 2010 Sales worksheet contains the following formula:
=SUM(B3:D3)
When you copy this formula to cell E4, Excel changes the copy of the formula 
to the following:
=SUM(B4:D4)
Excel adjusts the row reference to keep current with the new row 4 position. 
Because Excel adjusts the cell references in copies of a formula relative to the 
direction of the copying, the cell references are known as relative cell references.
Some things are absolutes!
All new formulas you create naturally contain relative cell references unless 
you say otherwise. Because most copies you make of formulas require adjust-
ments of their cell references, you rarely have to give this arrangement a 
second thought. Then, every once in a while, you come across an exception 
that calls for limiting when and how cell references are adjusted in copies.

159
 Chapter 4: Going Through Changes
One of the most common of these exceptions is when you want to compare 
a range of different values with a single value. This happens most often when 
you want to compute what percentage each part is to the total. For example, in 
the Mother Goose Enterprises – 2010 Sales worksheet, you encounter this situ-
ation in creating and copying a formula that calculates what percentage each 
monthly total (in the cell range B14:D14) is of the quarterly total in cell E12.
Suppose that you want to enter these formulas in row 14 of the Mother Goose 
Enterprises – 2010 Sales worksheet, starting in cell B14. The formula in cell 
B14 for calculating the percentage of the January-sales-to-first-quarter-total is 
very straightforward:
=B12/E12
This formula divides the January sales total in cell B12 by the quarterly total 
in E12 (what could be easier?). Look, however, at what would happen if you 
dragged the fill handle one cell to the right to copy this formula to cell C14:
=C12/F12
The adjustment of the first cell reference from B12 to C12 is just what the 
doctor ordered. However, the adjustment of the second cell reference from 
E12 to F12 is a disaster. Not only do you not calculate what percentage the 
February sales in cell C12 are of the first quarter sales in E12, but you also 
end up with one of those horrible #DIV/0! error things in cell C14.
To stop Excel from adjusting a cell reference in a formula in any copies you 
make, convert the cell reference from relative to absolute. You do this by 
pressing the function key F4, after you put Excel in Edit mode (F2). Excel 
indicates that you make the cell reference absolute by placing dollar signs 
in front of the column letter and row number. For example, in Figure 4-7, cell 
B14 contains the correct formula to copy to the cell range C14:D14:
=B12/$E$12
 
Figure 4-7: 
Copying the 
formula for 
computing 
the ratio of 
monthly to 
quarterly 
sales with 
an absolute 
cell 
reference.
 

160
Part II: Editing without Tears 
Look at the worksheet after this formula is copied to the range C14:D14 
with the fill handle and cell C14 is selected (see Figure 4-8). Notice that the 
Formula bar shows that this cell contains the following formula:
=C12/$E$12
 
Figure 4-8: 
The work-
sheet after 
copying the 
formula 
with the 
absolute 
cell 
reference.
 
Because E12 was changed to $E$12 in the original formula, all the copies have 
this same absolute (non-changing) reference.
 
If you goof up and copy a formula where one or more of the cell references 
should have been absolute but you left them all relative, edit the original for-
mula as follows:
 
1. Double-click the cell with the formula or press F2 to edit it.
 
2. Position the insertion point somewhere on the reference you want to 
convert to absolute.
 
3. Press F4.
 
4. When you finish editing, click the Enter button on the Formula bar 
and then copy the formula to the messed-up cell range with the fill 
handle.
 
Be sure to press F4 only to change a cell reference to completely absolute as 
I describe earlier. If you press the F4 function key a second time, you end up 
with a so-called mixed reference, where only the row part is absolute and the 
column part is relative (as in E$12). If you then press F4 again, Excel comes up 
with another type of mixed reference, where the column part is absolute and 
the row part is relative (as in $E12). If you go on and press F4 yet again, Excel 
changes the cell reference back to completely relative (as in E12). After you’re 
back where you started, you can continue to use F4 to cycle through this same 
set of cell reference changes all over again.

161
 Chapter 4: Going Through Changes
Cut and paste, digital style
Instead of using drag and drop or AutoFill, you can use the old standby Cut, 
Copy, and Paste commands to move or copy information in a worksheet. 
These commands use the Office Clipboard as a kind of electronic halfway 
house where the information you cut or copy remains until you decide to 
paste it somewhere. Because of this Clipboard arrangement, you can use 
these commands to move or copy information to any other workbook open 
in Excel or even to other programs running in Windows (such as a Word 2010 
document).
To move a cell selection with Cut and Paste, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the cells you want to move.
 
2. Click the Cut command button in the Clipboard group on the Home 
tab (the button with the scissors icon).
 
 If you prefer, you can choose Cut by pressing Ctrl+X.
 
 Whenever you choose the Cut command in Excel, the program sur-
rounds the cell selection with a marquee (a dotted line that travels 
around the cells’ outline) and displays the following message on the 
Status bar:
Select destination and press ENTER or choose Paste
 
3. Move the cell cursor to the new range to which you want the informa-
tion moved, or click the cell in the upper-left corner of the new range.
 
4. Press Enter to complete the move operation.
 
 If you’re feeling ambitious, click the Paste command button in the 
Clipboard group on the Home tab or press Ctrl+V.
Notice that when you indicate the destination range, you don’t have to select 
a range of blank cells that matches the shape and size of the cell selection 
you’re moving. Excel needs to know only the location of the cell in the upper-
left corner of the destination range to figure out where to put the rest of the 
cells.
Copying a cell selection with the Copy and Paste commands follows an iden-
tical procedure to the one you use with the Cut and Paste commands. After 
selecting the range to copy, you can get the information into the Clipboard 
by clicking the Copy button on the Ribbon’s Home tab, choosing Copy from 
the cell’s shortcut menu, or pressing Ctrl+C.

Part II: Editing without Tears 
Paste it again, Sam . . .
An advantage to copying a selection with the Copy and Paste commands and 
the Clipboard is that you can paste the information multiple times. Just make 
sure that, instead of pressing Enter to complete the first copy operation, you 
click the Paste button on the Home tab of the Ribbon or press Ctrl+V.
When you use the Paste command to complete a copy operation, Excel 
copies the selection to the range you designate without removing the mar-
quee from the original selection. This is your signal that you can select 
another destination range (in either the same or a different document).
After you select the first cell of the next range where you want the selection 
copied, choose the Paste command again. You can continue in this manner, 
pasting the same selection to your heart’s content. When you make the last 
copy, press Enter instead of choosing the Paste command button or press-
ing Ctrl+V. If you forget and choose Paste, get rid of the marquee around the 
original cell range by pressing the Esc key.
Keeping pace with Paste Options
Right after you click the Paste button on the Home tab of the Ribbon or press 
Ctrl+V to paste cell entries that you copy (not cut) to the Clipboard, Excel 
displays a Paste Options button with the label, (Ctrl), to its immediate right 
at the end of the pasted range. When you click this drop-down button or 
press the Ctrl key, a palette similar to the one shown in Figure 4-9 appears 
with three groups of buttons (Paste, Paste Values, and Other Paste Options).

 Chapter 4: Going Through Changes
You can use these paste options to control or restrict the type of content and 
formatting that’s included in the pasted cell range. The paste options (com-
plete with the hot key sequences you can type to select them) on the Paste 
Options palette include:
 
✓ Paste (P): Excel pastes all the stuff in the cell selection (formulas, for-
matting, you name it).
 
✓ Formulas (F): Excel pastes all the text, numbers, and formulas in the cur-
rent cell selection without their formatting.
 
✓ Formulas & Number Formatting (O): Excel pastes the number formats 
assigned to the copied values along with their formulas.
 
✓ Keep Source Formatting (K): Excel copies the formatting from the origi-
nal cells and pastes this into the destination cells (along with the copied 
entries).
 
✓ No Borders (B): Excel pastes all the stuff in the cell selection without 
copying any borders applied to its cell range.
 
✓ Keep Source Column Widths (W): Excel makes the width of the columns 
in the destination range the same as those in the source range when it 
copies their cell entries.
 
✓ Transpose (T): Excel changes the orientation of the pasted entries. 
For example, if the original cells’ entries run down the rows of a single 
column of the worksheet, the transposed pasted entries will run across 
the columns of a single row.
 
✓ Values (V): Excel pastes only the calculated results of any formulas in 
the source cell range.
 
✓ Values & Number Formatting (A): Excel pastes the calculated results of 
any formulas along with all the formatting assigned to the labels, values, 
and formulas in the source cell range into the destination range. This 
means that all the labels and values in the destination range appear for-
matted just like the source range even though all the original formulas 
are lost and only the calculated values are retained.
 
✓ Values & Source Formatting (E): Excel pastes the calculated results of 
any formulas along with all formatting assigned to the source cell range.
 
✓ Formatting (R): Excel pastes only the formatting (and not the entries) 
copied from the source cell range to the destination range.
 
✓ Paste Link (N): Excel creates linking formulas in the destination range 
so that any changes that you make to the entries in cells in the source 
range are immediately brought forward and reflected in the correspond-
ing cells of the destination range.
 
✓ Picture (U): Excel pastes only the pictures in the copied cell selection.
 
✓ Linked Picture (I): Excel pastes a link to the pictures in the copied cell 
selection.

164
Part II: Editing without Tears 
 
The options that appear on the Paste Options palette are context sensitive. This 
means that the particular paste options available on the palette depend directly 
upon the type of cell entries previously copied to the Office Clipboard. 
Additionally, you can access this same palette of paste options by clicking the 
drop-down button that appears directly beneath the Paste button on the Ribbon 
instead of clicking the Paste Options button that appears at the end of the 
pasted range in the worksheet or pressing the Ctrl key on your keyboard.
Paste it from the Clipboard task pane
The Clipboard can store multiple cuts and copies from any program running 
under Windows not just Excel. In Excel, this means that you can continue to 
paste stuff from the Clipboard into a workbook even after finishing a move or 
copy operation (even when you do so by pressing the Enter key rather than 
using the Paste command). 
To open the Clipboard in its own task pane to the immediate left of the 
Worksheet area (see Figure 4-10), click the dialog box launcher in the lower-
right corner of the Clipboard group on the Ribbon’s Home tab.
To paste an item from the Office Clipboard into a worksheet other than the one 
with the data last cut or copied onto it, click the item in the Clipboard task pane 
to paste it into the worksheet starting at the current position of the cell cursor.
 
Figure 4-10:

Clipboard 
task pane 
appears on 
the left side 
of the Excel

area.
 

165
 Chapter 4: Going Through Changes
You can paste all the items stored in the Office Clipboard into the current 
worksheet by clicking the Paste All button at the top of the Clipboard task 
pane. To clear the Office Clipboard of all the current items, click the Clear All 
button. To delete only a particular item from the Office Clipboard, position 
the mouse pointer over the item in the Clipboard task pane until its drop-
down button appears. Click this drop-down button, and then choose Delete 
from the pop-up menu (refer to Figure 4-10).
 
To have the Clipboard task pane appear automatically after making two 
cuts or copies to the Clipboard in an Excel workbook, click the Show Office 
Clipboard Automatically option on the task pane’s Options button menu. 
To open the Clipboard task pane in the Excel program window by pressing 
Ctrl+CC, click Show Office Clipboard When Ctrl+C Pressed Twice on the task 
pane’s Options button. Pressing Ctrl+CC only opens the task pane. You still 
have to click the Close button on the Office Clipboard to close the task pane.
So what’s so special about Paste Special?
Normally, unless you fool around with the Paste Options (see the section 
“Keeping pace with Paste Options” earlier in this chapter), Excel copies all the 
information in the range of cells you selected: formatting, as well the formulas, 
text, and other values you enter. You can use the Paste Special command to 
specify which entries and formatting to use in the current paste operation. Many 
of the Paste Special options are also available on the Paste Options palette.
To paste particular parts of a cell selection while discarding others, click the 
drop-down button that appears at the bottom of the Paste command button 
on the Ribbon’s Home tab. Then, click Paste Special on its drop-down menu 
to open the Paste Special dialog box shown in Figure 4-11.

166
Part II: Editing without Tears 
The options in the Paste Special dialog box include:
 
✓ All to paste all the stuff in the cell selection (formulas, formatting, you 
name it).
 
✓ Formulas to paste all the text, numbers, and formulas in the current cell 
selection without their formatting.
 
✓ Values to convert formulas in the current cell selection to their calcu-
lated values.
 
✓ Formats to paste only the formatting from the current cell selection, 
leaving the cell entries in the dust.
 
✓ Comments to paste only the notes that you attach to their cells (kind of 
like electronic self-stick notes — see Chapter 6 for details).
 
✓ Validation to paste only the data validation rules into the cell range 
that you set up with the Data Validation command (which enables you 
to set what value or range of values is allowed in a particular cell or cell 
range).
 
✓ All Using Source Theme to paste all the information plus the cell styles 
applied to the cells.
 
✓ All Except Borders to paste all the stuff in the cell selection without 
copying any borders you use there.
 
✓ Column Widths to apply the column widths of the cells copied to the 
Clipboard to the columns where the cells are pasted.
 
✓ Formulas and Number Formats to include the number formats assigned 
to the pasted values and formulas.
 
✓ Values and Number Formats to convert formulas to their calculated 
values and include the number formats you assign to all the pasted 
values.
 
✓ All Merging Conditional Formats to paste Conditional Formatting into 
the cell range.
 
✓ None to have Excel perform no mathematical operation between the 
data entries you cut or copy to the Clipboard and the data entries in the 
cell range where you paste.
 
✓ Add to add the data you cut or copy to the Clipboard and the data 
entries in the cell range where you paste.
 
✓ Subtract to subtract the data you cut or copy to the Clipboard from the 
data entries in the cell range where you paste.
 
✓ Multiply to multiply the data you cut or copy to the Clipboard by the 
data entries in the cell range where you paste.
 
✓ Divide to divide the data you cut or copy to the Clipboard by the data 
entries in the cell range where you paste.

167
 Chapter 4: Going Through Changes
 
✓ Skip Blanks check box when you want Excel to paste everywhere except 
for any empty cells in the incoming range. In other words, a blank cell 
cannot overwrite your current cell entries.
 
✓ Transpose check box when you want Excel to change the orientation of 
the pasted entries. For example, if the original cells’ entries run down 
the rows of a single column of the worksheet, the transposed pasted 
entries will run across the columns of a single row.
 
✓ Paste Link button when you’re copying cell entries and you want to 
establish a link between copies you’re pasting and the original entries. 
That way, changes to the original cells automatically update in the 
pasted copies.
Let’s Be Clear about Deleting Stuff
No discussion about editing in Excel would be complete without a section on 
getting rid of the stuff you put into cells. You can perform two kinds of dele-
tions in a worksheet:
 
✓ Clearing a cell: Clearing just deletes or empties the cell’s contents with-
out removing the cell from the worksheet, which would alter the layout 
of the surrounding cells.
 
✓ Deleting a cell: Deleting gets rid of the whole kit and caboodle — cell 
structure along with all its contents and formatting. When you delete a 
cell, Excel has to shuffle the position of entries in the surrounding cells 
to plug up any gaps made by the action.
Sounding the all clear!
To get rid of just the contents of a cell selection rather than delete the cells 
and their contents, select the range of cells to clear and then simply press 
the Delete key.
If you want to get rid of more than just the contents of a cell selection, 
click the Clear button (the one with the eraser) in the Editing group on the 
Ribbon’s Home tab and then click one of the following options on its drop-
down menu:
 
✓ Clear All: Gets rid of all formatting and notes, as well as entries in the 
cell selection (Alt+HEA).
 
✓ Clear Formats: Deletes only the formatting from the cell selection with-
out touching anything else (Alt+HEF).

168
Part II: Editing without Tears 
 
✓ Clear Contents: Deletes only the entries in the cell selection just like 
pressing the Delete key (Alt+HEC).
 
✓ Clear Comments: Removes the notes in the cell selection but leaves 
everything else behind (Alt+HEM).
 
✓ Clear Hyperlinks: Removes the active hyperlinks (see Chapter 12) in the 
cell selection but leaves its descriptive text (Alt+HEL).
Get these cells outta here!
To delete the cell selection rather than just clear out its contents, select 
the cell range, click the drop-down button attached to the Delete command 
button in the Cells group of the Home tab, and then click Delete Cells on the 
drop-down menu (or press Alt+HDD). The Delete dialog box opens, showing 
options for filling in the gaps created when the cells currently selected are 
blotted out of existence:
 
✓ Shift Cells Left: This default option moves entries from neighboring col-
umns on the right to the left to fill in gaps created when you delete the 
cell selection by clicking OK or pressing Enter.
 
✓ Shift Cells Up: Select this to move entries up from neighboring rows 
below.
 
✓ Entire Row: Select this to remove all the rows in the current cell 
selection.
 
✓ Entire Columns: Select this to delete all the columns in the current cell 
selection.
 
If you know that you want to shift the remaining cells to the left after deleting 
the cells in the current selection, you can simply click the Delete command 
button on the Home tab of the Ribbon. (This is the same thing as opening the 
Delete dialog box and then clicking OK when the default Shift Cells Left button 
is selected.
To delete an entire column or row from the worksheet, you can select the 
column or row on the workbook window frame, right-click the selection, and 
then click Delete from the column’s or row’s shortcut menu.
 
You can also delete entire columns and rows selected in the worksheet by 
clicking the drop-down button attached to the Delete command button on 
the Ribbon’s Home tab and then clicking the Delete Sheet Columns (Alt+HDC) 
option or the Delete Sheet Rows option (Alt+HDR) on the drop-down menu.

169
 Chapter 4: Going Through Changes
 
Deleting entire columns and rows from a worksheet is risky business unless 
you are sure that the columns and rows in question contain nothing of value. 
Remember, when you delete an entire row from the worksheet, you delete all 
information from column A through XFD in that row (and you can see only a 
very few columns in this row). Likewise, when you delete an entire column 
from the worksheet, you delete all information from row 1 through 1,048,576 in 
that column.
Staying in Step with Insert
For those inevitable times when you need to squeeze new entries into an 
already populated region of the worksheet, you can insert new cells in the 
area rather than go through all the trouble of moving and rearranging sev-
eral individual cell ranges. To insert a new cell range, select the cells (many 
of which are already occupied) where you want the new cells to appear and 
then click the drop-down attached to the Insert command button in the Cells 
group of the Home tab and then click Insert Cells on the drop-down menu (or 
press Alt+HII). The Insert dialog box opens with the following option buttons:
 
✓ Shift Cells Right: Select this to shift existing cells to the right to make 
room for the ones you want to add before clicking OK or pressing Enter.
 
✓ Shift Cells Down: Use this default to instruct the program to shift exist-
ing entries down before clicking OK or pressing Enter.
 
✓ Entire Row or Entire Column: When you insert cells with the Insert 
dialog box, you can insert complete rows or columns in the cell range 
by selecting either of these radio buttons. You can also select the row 
number or column letter on the frame before you choose the Insert 
command.
 
If you know that you want to shift the existing cells to the right to make room 
for the newly inserted cells, you can simply click the Insert command button 
on the Ribbon’s Home tab (this is the same thing as opening the Insert dialog 
box and then clicking OK when the Shift Cells Right button is selected).
 
Remember that you can also insert entire columns and rows in a worksheet by 
right-clicking the selection and then clicking Insert on the column’s or row’s 
shortcut menu.
 
As when you delete whole columns and rows, inserting entire columns and 
rows affects the entire worksheet, not just the part you see. If you don’t know 
what’s out in the hinterlands of the worksheet, you can’t be sure how the 
insertion will affect — perhaps even sabotage — stuff (especially formulas) in 
the other unseen areas. I suggest that you scroll all the way out in both direc-
tions to make sure that nothing’s out there.

Stamping Out Your Spelling Errors
If you’re as good a speller as I am, you’ll be relieved to know that Excel 2010 
has a built-in spell checker that can catch and remove all those embarrass-
ing little spelling errors. With this in mind, you no longer have any excuse for 
putting out worksheets with typos in the titles or headings.
To check the spelling in a worksheet, you have the following options:
 
✓ Click the Spelling command button on the Ribbon’s Review tab
 
✓ Press Alt+RS
 
✓ Press F7
Any way you do it, Excel begins checking the spelling of all text entries in the 
worksheet. When the program comes across an unknown word, it displays 
the Spelling dialog box, similar to the one shown in Figure 4-12.
 
Figure 4-12: 
Check your 
spelling 
from the 
Spelling dia-
log box.
 
Excel suggests replacements for the unknown word shown in the Not in 
Dictionary text box with a likely replacement in the Suggestions list box 
of the Spelling dialog box. If that replacement is incorrect, you can scroll 
through the Suggestions list and click the correct replacement. Use the 
Spelling dialog box options as follows:
 
✓ Ignore Once and Ignore All: When Excel’s spell check comes across 
a word its dictionary finds suspicious but you know is viable, click the 
Ignore Once button. If you don’t want the spell checker to bother query-
ing you about this word again, click the Ignore All button.
 
✓ Add to Dictionary: Click this button to add the unknown (to Excel) 
word — such as your name — to a custom dictionary so that Excel 
won’t flag it again when you check the spelling in the worksheet later on.

171
 Chapter 4: Going Through Changes
 
✓ Change: Click this button to replace the word listed in the Not in 
Dictionary text box with the word Excel offers in the Suggestions list 
box.
 
✓ Change All: Click this button to change all occurrences of this mis-
spelled word in the worksheet to the word Excel displays in the 
Suggestions list box.
 
✓ AutoCorrect: Click this button to have Excel automatically correct this 
spelling error with the suggestion displayed in the Suggestions list box 
(by adding the misspelling and suggestion to the AutoCorrect dialog 
box; for more, read Chapter 2).
 
✓ Dictionary Language: To switch to another dictionary (such as a United 
Kingdom English dictionary, or a French dictionary when checking 
French terms in a multilingual worksheet), click this drop-down button 
and then select the name of the desired language in the list.
Notice that the Excel spell checker not only flags words not found in its built-
in or custom dictionary but also flags occurrences of double words in a cell 
entry (such as total total) and words with unusual capitalization (such as NEw 
York instead of New York). By default, the spell checker ignores all words 
with numbers and all Internet addresses. If you want it to ignore all words 
in uppercase letters as well, click the Options button at the bottom of the 
Spelling dialog box, and then select the Ignore Words in UPPERCASE check 
box before clicking OK.
You can check the spelling of just a particular group of entries by selecting 
the cells before you click the Spelling command button on the Review tab of 
the Ribbon or press F7.
Stamping Out Errors with Text to Speech
The good news is that Excel 2010 still supports the Text to Speech feature 
introduced in Excel 2003. This feature enables your computer to read aloud 
any series of cell entries in the worksheet. By using Text to Speech, you can 
check your printed source while the computer reads aloud the values and 
labels that you’ve actually entered — a real nifty way to catch and correct 
errors that may otherwise escape unnoticed.
 
The Text to Speech translation feature requires no prior training or special 
microphones: All that’s required is a pair of speakers or headphones con-
nected to your computer.

172
Part II: Editing without Tears 
Now for the bad news: Text to Speech is not available from any of the tabs 
on the Ribbon. The only way to access Text to Speech is by adding its Speak 
Cells command buttons as custom buttons on a custom tab on the Ribbon or 
as custom buttons on the Quick Access toolbar as follows:
 
1. Click the Customize Quick Access Toolbar button at the very end of 
the Quick Access toolbar and then click More Commands on its menu.
 
 The Quick Access Toolbar tab of the Excel Options dialog box opens.
 
2. Click Commands Not in the Ribbon on the Choose Commands From 
drop-down menu and scroll down until you see the Speak Cells com-
mands.
 
 The Text to Speech command buttons include Speak Cells, Speak Cells – 
Stop Speaking Cells, Speak Cells by Columns, Speak Cells by Rows, and 
Speak Cells on Enter.
 
3. Click the Speak Cells button in the Choose Commands From list box 
on the left and then click the Add button to add it to the bottom of the 
Customize Quick Access Toolbar list box on the right.
 
4. Repeat Step 3 until you’ve added the remaining Text to Speech but-
tons to the Quick Access toolbar: Speak Cells – Stop Speaking Cells, 
Speak Cells by Columns, Speak Cells by Rows, and Speak Cells on 
Enter.
 
 If you want to reposition the Text to Speech buttons on the Quick 
Access toolbar, select each button in the Customize Quick Access 
Toolbar list and then move it left on the bar by clicking the Move Up 
button or right by clicking Move Down. If you want to set off the Text to 
Speech buttons as a separate group on the Quick Access toolbar, add 
a vertical separator ahead of the Speak Cells command button (and fol-
lowing the Speak Cells on Enter button if you have buttons not related to 
the Text to Speech function that follow on the Quick Access toolbar).
 
5. Click the OK button to close the Excel Options dialog box.
Figure 4-13 shows the Quick Access toolbar in my Excel 2010 program 
window after I moved the toolbar down so that it appears below the Ribbon 
and added athe Speak Cells command buttons to it.
After adding the Text to Speech commands as custom Speak Cells buttons 
on the Quick Access toolbar, you can use them to corroborate spreadsheet 
entries and catch those hard-to-spot errors as follows:
 
1. Select the cells in the worksheet whose contents you want read aloud 
by Text to Speech.
 
2. Click the Speak Cells custom button on the Quick Access toolbar to 
have the computer read the entries in the selected cells.
 
 By default, the Text to Speech feature reads the contents of each cell 
in the cell selection by reading down each column and then across the 

173
 Chapter 4: Going Through Changes
rows. If you want Text to Speech to read across the rows and then down 
the columns, click the Speak Cells by Rows button on the Quick Access 
toolbar (the button with the two opposing horizontal arrows).
 
3. To have the Text to Speech feature read each cell entry while you 
press the Enter key (at which point the cell cursor moves down to 
the next cell in the selection), click the Speak Cells on Enter custom 
button (the button with the curved arrow Enter symbol) on the Quick 
Access toolbar.
 
 As soon as you click the Speak Cells on Enter button, the computer tells 
you, “Cells will now be spoken on Enter.” After selecting this option, you 
need to press Enter each time that you want to hear an entry read to you.
 
4. To pause the Text to Speech feature when you’re not using the Speak 
Cells on Enter option (Step 3) and you locate a discrepancy between 
what you’re reading and what you’re hearing, click the Stop Speaking 
button (the Speak Cells group button with the x).
 
Figure 4-13: 
After add-
ing the 
Speak Cells 
command 
buttons to 
the Quick 
Access tool-
bar, you can 
use them 
to check 
cell entries 
audibly.
 
 
After you click the Speak Cells on Enter button on the Quick Access toolbar, 
the computer speaks only each new cell entry that you complete by pressing 
the Enter key (which moves the cell cursor down one row) rather than some 
other method, such as clicking the Enter button on the Formula bar or press-
ing the ↓ key.
 
You can also add any or all the Text to Speech buttons to a custom group on a 
custom tab on the Ribbon (for example, the Speak Cells group on the custom 
Misc tab in Figure 4-13 contains the Speak Cells and Stop Speaking buttons).

F
or most people, getting data down on paper is what spreadsheets are 
all about (all the talk about a so-called paperless office to the contrary). 
Everything — all the data entry, all the formatting, all the formula checking, 
all the things you do to get a spreadsheet ready — is really just preparation 
for printing its information.
In this chapter, you find out just how easy it is to print reports with Excel 
2010. Thanks to the program’s new Print panel in Backstage View (Alt+FP), its 
Page Layout worksheet view, and its handy Page Layout tab on the Ribbon, 
you discover how to produce top-notch reports the first time you send 
the document to the printer (instead of the second or even the third time 
around).
The only trick to printing a worksheet is getting used to the paging scheme 
and learning how to control it. Many of the worksheets you create with Excel 
are not only longer than one printed page but also wider. Word processors, 
such as Word 2010, page the document only vertically; they won’t let you 

176
Part II: Editing without Tears 
create a document wider than the page size you’re using. Spreadsheet pro-
grams like Excel 2010, however, often have to break up pages both vertically 
and horizontally to print a worksheet document (a kind of tiling of the print 
job, if you will).
When breaking a worksheet into pages, Excel first pages the document verti-
cally down the rows in the first columns of the print area (just like a word 
processor). After paging the first columns, the program pages down the rows 
of the second set of columns in the print area. Excel pages down and then 
over until the entire document included in the current print area (which can 
include the entire worksheet or just sections) is paged.
When paging the worksheet, Excel doesn’t break up the information within 
a row or column. If not all the information in a row will fit at the bottom of 
the page, the program moves the entire row to the following page. If not all 
the information in a column will fit at the right edge of the page, the program 
moves the entire column to a new page. (Because Excel pages down and then 
over, the column may not appear on the next page of the report.)
You can deal with such paging problems in several ways, and in this chapter, 
you see all of them! After you have these page problems under control, print-
ing is a proverbial piece of cake.
Taking a Gander at the Pages 
in Page Layout View
Excel 2010’s Page Layout View gives you instant access to the paging of the 
current worksheet. Activate this feature by clicking the Page Layout View 
button (the center one) to the immediate left of the Zoom slider on the Status 
bar or by clicking the Page Layout View command button on the Ribbon’s 
View tab (Alt+WP). As you can see in Figure 5-1, when you switch to Page 
Layout View, Excel adds horizontal and vertical rulers to the column letter 
and row number headings. In the Worksheet area, this view shows the mar-
gins for each printed page, any headers and footers defined for the report, 
and the breaks between each page. (Often, you have to use the Zoom slider 
to reduce the screen magnification to display the page breaks on the screen.)
 
To see all the pages in the active worksheet, drag the slider button in the 
Zoom slider on the Status bar to the left until you decrease the screen magnifi-
cation sufficiently to display all the pages of data.

on a U.S. computer and centimeters on a European machine). To change 
the units, open the Advanced tab of the Excel Options dialog box 
(File➪Options➪Advanced or Alt+FIA) and then select the appropriate unit 
(Inches, Centimeters, or Millimeters) on the Ruler Units drop-down menu in 
the Display section.
The Ruler check box on the View tab acts as a toggle switch so that the first 
time you click this button, Excel removes the rulers from the Page Layout 
View, and the second time you click this button, the program adds them 
again.
Checking and Printing a Report 
from the Print Panel
To save wasted paper and your sanity, print your worksheet directly from 
the Print panel in Backstage View by clicking File➪Print (or simply pressing 
Ctrl+P or Ctrl+F2). As you see in Figure 5-2, the Print panel shows you at-a-
glance your current print settings along with a preview of the first page of the 
printout.

Figure 5-2: 
The Print 
panel in 
Backstage 
View shows 
your current 
print set-
tings plus a 
preview of 
the printout.
 
You can use the Print Preview feature in the Print panel before you print any 
worksheet, section of worksheet, or entire workbook. Because of the pecu-
liarities in paging worksheet data, you often need to check the page breaks 
for any report that requires more than one page. The print preview area in 
the Print panel shows you exactly how the worksheet data will page when 
printed. If necessary, you can return to the worksheet where you can make 
changes to the page settings from the Page Layout tab on the Ribbon before 
sending the report to the printer when everything looks okay.
When Excel displays a full page in the print preview area, you can barely read 
its contents. To increase the view to actual size to verify some of the data, click 
the Zoom to Page button in the lower-right corner of the Print panel. Check out 
the difference in Figure 5-3 — you can see what the first page of the four-page 
report looks like after I zoom in by clicking this Zoom to Page button.
After you enlarge a page to actual size, use the scroll bars to bring new parts 
of the page into view in the print preview area. To return to the full-page 
view, click the Zoom to Page button a second time to deselect it.
Excel indicates the number of pages in a report at the bottom of the print 
preview area. If your report has more than one page, you can view pages 
that follow by clicking the Next Page button to the right of the final page 
number. To review a page you’ve already seen, back up a page by clicking the 
Previous Page button to the left of the first page number. (The Previous Page 
button is gray if you’re on the first page.)

To display markers indicating the current left, right, top and bottom margins 
along with the column widths, select the Show Margins check box to the 
immediate left of the Zoom to Page button. You can then modify the column 
widths as well as the page margins by dragging the appropriate marker (see 
“Massaging the margins” later in this chapter for details).
When you finish previewing the report, the Print panel offers you the following 
options for changing certain print settings before you send it to the printer:
 
✓ Print button with the Number of Copies combo box: Use this button to 
print the spreadsheet report using the current print settings listed on 
the panel. Use the combo box to indicate the number of copies you want 
when you need multiple copies printed.
 
✓ Printer drop-down button: Use this button to select a new printer or 
fax to send the spreadsheet report to when more than one device is 
installed. (Excel automatically displays the name of the printer that’s 
installed as the default printer in Windows.)
 
✓ Settings drop-down buttons: These include a Print What drop-down button 
with attendant Pages combo boxes: Use the Print What drop-down button 
to choose between printing only the active (selected) worksheets in the 
workbook (the default), the entire workbook, the current cell selection in 
the current worksheet, and the currently selected table in the current work-
sheet. Use the combo boxes to restrict what’s printed to just the range of 
pages you enter in these boxes or select with their spinner buttons. 

180
Part II: Editing without Tears 
 
 Beneath the combo boxes, you find drop-down list buttons to print on 
both sides of each page in the report, collate the pages of the report, 
and switch the page orientation from Portrait (aligned with the short 
side) to Landscape (aligned with the long side). Additionally, you can 
select a paper size other than the standard 8.5" x 11" letter, and custom-
ize the size of the report’s margins (top, bottom, left, and right, as well 
as the margins for any header and footer on the page).
Printing Just the Current Worksheet
As long as you want to use Excel’s default print settings to print all the cells in 
the current worksheet, printing in Excel 2010 is a breeze. Simply add the Quick 
Print button to the Quick Access toolbar (by clicking the Customize Quick 
Access Toolbar button and then clicking Quick Print on its drop-down menu).
After adding the Quick Print button to the Quick Access toolbar, you can use 
this button to print a single copy of all the information in the current work-
sheet, including any charts and graphics — but not including comments you 
add to cells. (See Chapter 6 for details about adding comments to your work-
sheet and Chapter 10 for details about charts and graphics.)
Understanding and using the print area
Excel includes a special printing feature called 
Print Area. Click Print Area➪Set Print Area on 
the Ribbon’s Page Layout tab or press Alt+PRS 
to define any cell selection on a worksheet as 
the print area. After you define the print area, 
Excel then prints this cell selection anytime you 
print the worksheet (by using either the Quick 
Print button, if you’ve added it to the Quick 
Access toolbar or by using the File➪Print com-
mand or its Ctrl+P shortcut).
After you define the print area, its cell range 
is the only one you can print (regardless of 
what other Print What option you select in the 
Settings section of the Print panel). That is, 
unless you click the Ignore Print Area option at 
the very bottom of the Print What drop-down list 
or clear the print area. To clear the print area 
(and return to the printing defaults that Excel 
establishes in the Print dialog box), click Print 
Area➪Clear Print Area on the Page Layout tab 
or simply press Alt+PRC.
You can also define and clear the print area 
from the Sheet tab of the Page Setup dialog 
box by clicking the dialog box launcher in the 
Page Setup group on the Ribbon’s Page Layout 
tab. To define the print area from this dialog 
box, click the Print Area text box on the Sheet 
tab to insert the cursor and then select the cell 
range or ranges in the worksheet (remembering 
that you can reduce the Page Setup dialog box 
to just this text box by clicking the Print Area 
Collapse/Expand button). To clear the print area 
from this dialog box, select the cell addresses in 
the Print Area text box and press the Delete key.

181
 Chapter 5: Printing the Masterpiece
When you click the Quick Print button, Excel routes the print job to the 
Windows print queue, which acts like a middleman and sends the job to the 
printer. While Excel sends the print job to the print queue, Excel displays a 
Printing dialog box to inform you of its progress (displaying such updates as 
Printing Page 2 of 3). After this dialog box disappears, you are free to go back 
to work in Excel. To stop the printing while the job is still being sent to the 
print queue, click the Cancel button in the Printing dialog box.
If you don’t realize that you want to cancel the print job until after Excel 
finishes shipping it to the print queue (that is, while the Printing dialog box 
appears onscreen), you must:
 
1. Click the printer icon in the Notification area at the far right of the 
Windows taskbar (to the immediate left of the current time) with the 
secondary mouse button to open its shortcut menu.
 
 This printer icon displays the ScreenTip 1 document(s) pending 
for so-and-so. For example, when I’m printing, this message reads 1 
document(s) pending for Greg when I position the mouse pointer over the 
printer icon.
 
2. Right-click the printer icon and then select the Open All Active 
Printers command from its shortcut menu.
 
 This opens the dialog box for the printer with the Excel print job in its 
queue (as described under the Document Name heading in the list box).
 
3. Select the Excel print job that you want to cancel in the list box of 
your printer’s dialog box.
 
4. Choose Document➪Cancel from the menu bar and then click Yes to 
confirm you want to cancel the print job.
 
5. Wait for the print job to disappear from the queue in the printer’s 
dialog box and then click the Close button to return to Excel.
My Page Was Set Up!
About the only thing the slightest bit complex in printing a worksheet is figur-
ing out how to get the pages right. Fortunately, the command buttons in the 
Page Setup group on the Ribbon’s Page Layout tab give you a great deal of 
control over what goes on which page.
Three groups of buttons on the Page Layout tab help you get your page set-
tings exactly as you want them. The Page Setup group, the Scale to Fit group, 
and the Sheet Options group are described in the following sections.

182
Part II: Editing without Tears 
 
To see the effect of changes you make in the Worksheet area, put the work-
sheet into Page Layout View by clicking the Page Layout button on the Status 
bar while you work with the command buttons in the Page Setup, Scale to Fit, 
and Sheet Options groups on the Page Layout tab of the Ribbon.
Using the buttons in the Page Setup group
The Page Setup group of the Page Layout tab contains the following impor-
tant command buttons:
 
✓ Margins button to select one of three preset margins for the report or 
to set custom margins on the Margins tab of the Page Setup dialog box. 
(See “Massaging the margins” that follows in this chapter.)
 
✓ Orientation button to switch between Portrait and Landscape mode for 
printing. (See the “Getting the lay of the landscape” section, later in this 
chapter.)
 
✓ Size button to select one of the preset paper sizes, set a custom size, or 
change the printing resolution or page number on the Page tab of the 
Page Setup dialog box.
 
✓ Print Area button to set and clear the print area. (See the nearby 
“Understanding and using the print area” sidebar.)
 
✓ Breaks button to insert or remove page breaks. (See “Solving Page Break 
Problems” later in this chapter.)
 
✓ Background button to open the Sheet Background dialog box where you 
can select a new graphic image or photo to use as a background for the 
current worksheet. (This button changes to Delete Background as soon 
as you select a background image.)
 
✓ Print Titles button to open the Sheet tab of the Page Setup dialog box 
where you can define rows of the worksheet to repeat at the top and col-
umns of the worksheet to repeat at the left as print titles for the report. 
(See “Putting out the print titles” later in this chapter.)
Massaging the margins
The Normal margin settings that Excel applies to a new report uses standard 
top, bottom, left, and right margins of 3⁄4 inch with just over a 1⁄4 inch separat-
ing the header and footer from the top and bottom margin, respectively.
In addition to the Normal margin settings, the program enables you to select 
two other standard margins from the Margins button’s drop-down menu:
 
✓ Wide margins with 1-inch top, bottom, left, and right margins and 1⁄2 
inch separating the header and footer from the top and bottom margin, 
respectively.

183
 Chapter 5: Printing the Masterpiece
 
✓ Narrow margins with a top and bottom margin of 3⁄4 inch and a left and 
right margin of 1⁄4 inch with 0.3 inch separating the header and footer 
from the top and bottom margin, respectively.
Frequently, you find yourself with a report that takes up a full printed page 
and then just enough to spill over onto a second, mostly empty, page. To 
squeeze the last column or the last few rows of the worksheet data onto Page 
1, try selecting Narrow on the Margins button’s drop-down menu.
If that doesn’t do it, you can try manually adjusting the margins for the report 
from the Margins tab of the Page Setup dialog box or by dragging the margin 
markers in the preview area of the Print panel in the Backstage View (Press 
Ctrl+P and click the Show Margins button). To get more columns on a page, 
try reducing the left and right margins. To get more rows on a page, try 
reducing the top and bottom margins.
To open the Margins tab of the Page Setup dialog box (shown in Figure 5-4), 
click Custom Margins on the Margins button’s drop-down menu. There, enter 
the new settings in the Top, Bottom, Left, and Right text boxes — or select 
the new margin settings with their respective spinner buttons.
 
Figure 5-4: 
Adjust your 
report mar-
gins from 
the Margins 
tab in the

dialog box.
 
 
Select one or both Center on Page options in the Margins tab of the Page Setup 
dialog box (refer to Figure 5-4) to center a selection of data (that takes up less 
than a full page) between the current margin settings. In the Center on Page 
section, select the Horizontally check box to center the data between the left 
and right margins. Select the Vertically check box to center the data between 
the top and bottom margins.

184
Part II: Editing without Tears 
When you select the Show Margins button in the Print panel in the Backstage 
View (Ctrl+P) to modify the margin settings directly, you can also massage 
the column widths as well as the margins. (Refer to Figure 5-5.) To change 
one of the margins, position the mouse pointer on the desired margin marker 
(the pointer shape changes to a double-headed arrow) and drag the marker 
with your mouse in the appropriate direction. When you release the mouse 
button, Excel redraws the page, using the new margin setting. You may gain 
or lose columns or rows, depending on what kind of adjustment you make. 
Changing the column widths is the same story: Drag the column marker to 
the left or right to decrease or increase the width of a particular column.
Getting the lay of the landscape
The drop-down menu attached to the Orientation button in the Page Setup 
group of the Ribbon’s Page Layout tab contains two options:
 
✓ Portrait (the default) where the printing runs parallel to the short edge 
of the paper
 
✓ Landscape where the printing runs parallel to the long edge of the paper

185
 Chapter 5: Printing the Masterpiece
Because many worksheets are far wider than they are tall (such as budgets 
or sales tables that track expenditures over 12 months), you may find that 
wider worksheets page better if you switch the orientation from Portrait 
mode (which accommodates fewer columns on a page because the printing 
runs parallel to the short edge of the page) to Landscape mode.
In Figure 5-6, you can see the Print Preview window with the first page of a 
report in Landscape mode in the Page Layout View. For this report, Excel can 
fit three more columns of information on this page in Landscape mode than it 
can in Portrait mode. However, because this page orientation accommodates 
fewer rows, the total page count for this report increases from two pages in 
Portrait mode to four pages in Landscape mode.
Putting out the print titles
Excel’s Print Titles feature enables you to print particular row and column 
headings on each page of the report. Print titles are important in multipage 
reports where the columns and rows of related data spill over to other pages 
that no longer show the row and column headings on the first page.
 
Don’t confuse print titles with the header of a report (see “From Header to 
Footer” later in this chapter). Even though both are printed on each page, 
header information prints in the top margin of the report; print titles always 
appear in the body of the report — at the top, in the case of rows used as print 
titles, and on the left, in the case of columns.

Part II: Editing without Tears 
To designate rows and/or columns as the print titles for a report, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Click the Print Titles button on the Page Layout tab on the Ribbon or 
press Alt+PI.
 
 The Page Setup dialog box appears with Sheet tab selected (refer to 
Figure 5-7).
 
 To designate worksheet rows as print titles, go to Step 2a. To designate 
worksheet columns as print titles, go to Step 2b.
 
2a. Select the Rows to Repeat at Top text box and then drag through the 
rows with information you want to appear at the top of each page in 
the worksheet below. If necessary, reduce the Page Setup dialog box 
to just the Rows to Repeat at Top text box by clicking the text box’s 
Collapse/Expand button.
 
 For the example shown in Figure 5-7, I clicked the Collapse/Expand 
button associated with the Rows to Repeat at Top text box and then 
dragged through rows 1 and 2 in column A of the Little Bo Peep Pet 
Detectives – Client List worksheet. Excel entered the row range $1:$2 in 
the Rows to Repeat at Top text box.
 
 Excel indicates the print-title rows in the worksheet by placing a dotted 
line (that moves like a marquee) on the border between the titles and 
the information in the body of the report.
 
Figure 5-7: 
Specify the 
rows and 
columns to 
use as print 
titles on the

box.
 

187
 Chapter 5: Printing the Masterpiece
 
2b. Select the Columns to Repeat at Left text box and then drag through 
the range of columns with the information you want to appear at the 
left edge of each page of the printed report in the worksheet below. 
If necessary, reduce the Page Setup dialog box to just the Columns 
to Repeat at Left text box by clicking the text box’s Collapse/Expand 
button.
 
 Excel indicates the print-title columns in the worksheet by placing a 
dotted line (that moves like a marquee) on the border between the titles 
and the information in the body of the report.
 
3. Click OK or press Enter to close the Page Setup dialog box.
 
 The dotted line showing the border of the row and/or column titles dis-
appears from the worksheet.
In Figure 5-7, rows 1 and 2 containing the worksheet title and column head-
ings for the Little Bo Peep Pet Detectives client database are designated as 
the print titles for the report in the Page Setup dialog box. In Figure 5-8, you 
can see the Print Preview window with the second page of the report. Note 
how these print titles appear on all pages of the report.
 
To clear print titles from a report if you no longer need them, open the Sheet 
tab of the Page Setup dialog box and then delete the row and column ranges 
from the Rows to Repeat at Top and the Columns to Repeat at Left text boxes. 
Click OK or press Enter.

Part II: Editing without Tears 
Using the buttons in the Scale to Fit group
If your printer supports scaling options, you’re in luck. You can always get 
a worksheet to fit on a single page simply by selecting the 1 Page option on 
the Width and Height drop-down menus attached to their command buttons 
in the Scale to Fit group on the Ribbon’s Page Layout tab. When you select 
these options, Excel figures out how much to reduce the size of the informa-
tion you’re printing to fit it all on one page.
After clicking the Page Break Preview button on the Status bar, you might 
preview this page in the Print panel of the Backstage View (Ctrl+P) and find 
that the printing is just too small to read comfortably. Go back to the Normal 
worksheet view (Esc), select the Page Layout tab on the Ribbon, and try 
changing the number of pages in the Width and Height drop-down menus in 
the Scale to Fit group.
 
Instead of trying to stuff everything on one page, check out how your work-
sheet looks if you fit it on two pages across. Try this: Select 2 Pages on the 
Width button’s drop-down menu on the Page Layout tab and leave 1 Page 
selected in the Height drop-down list button. Alternatively, see how the work-
sheet looks on two pages down: Select 1 Page on the Width button’s drop-
down menu and 2 Pages on the Height button’s drop-down menu.
 
After using the Width and Height Scale to Fit options, you may find that you 
don’t want to scale the printing. Cancel scaling by selecting Automatic on both 
the Width and Height drop-down menus and then entering 100 in the Scale 
text box (or select 100% with its spinner buttons).
Using the Print buttons in the Sheet 
Options group
The Sheet Options group contains two very useful Print check boxes (neither 
of which is selected automatically). The first is in the Gridlines column and 
the second is in the Headings column:
 
✓ Select the Print check box in the Gridlines column to print the column 
and row gridlines on each page of the report.
 
✓ Select the Print check box in the Headings column to print the row head-
ings with the row numbers and the column headings with the column 
letters on each page of the report.

189
 Chapter 5: Printing the Masterpiece
 
Select both check boxes (by clicking them to put check marks in them) when 
you want the printed version of your spreadsheet data to closely match its 
onscreen appearance. This is useful when you need to use the cell references 
on the printout to help you later locate the cells in the actual worksheet that 
need editing.
From Header to Footer
Headers and footers are simply standard text that appears on every page of the 
report. A header prints in the top margin of the page, and a footer prints — you 
guessed it — in the bottom margin. Both are centered vertically in the margins. 
Unless you specify otherwise, Excel does not automatically add either a header 
or footer to a new workbook.
 
Use headers and footers in a report to identify the document used to produce 
the report and display the page numbers and the date and time of printing.
The place to add a header or footer to a report is in Page Layout View. You 
can switch to this view by clicking the Page Layout View button on the Status 
bar or by clicking the Page Layout View button on the Ribbon’s View tab, or 
by just pressing Alt+WP.
When the worksheet is in Page Layout View, position the mouse pointer over 
the section in the top margin of the first page marked Click to Add Header or 
in the bottom margin of the first page marked Click to Add Footer.
 
To create a centered header or footer, click the center section of this header/
footer area to set the insertion point in the middle of the section. To add a left-
aligned header or footer, click the left section to set the insertion point flush 
with the left edge. To add a right-aligned header or footer, click the right sec-
tion to set the insertion point flush with the right edge.
Immediately after setting the insertion point in the left, center, or right sec-
tion of the header/footer area, Excel adds a Header & Footer Tools contextual 
tab with its own Design tab (see Figure 5-9). The Design tab is divided into 
Header & Footer, Header & Footer Elements, Navigation, and Options groups.
Adding an Auto Header or Auto Footer
The Header and Footer command buttons on the Design tab of the Header 
& Footer Tools contextual tab enable you to add stock headers and footers 
in an instant. Simply click the appropriate command button and then click 

190
Part II: Editing without Tears 
the header or footer example you want to use on the Header or Footer drop-
down menu that appears.
To create the centered header and footer for the report shown in Figure 5-10, 
I selected Client List, Confidential, Page 1 on the Header command button’s 
drop-down menu. Client List is the name of the worksheet; Confidential is 
stock text; and Page 1 is, of course, the current page number).
To set up the footer, I chose Page 1 of ? in the Footer command button’s 
drop-down menu (which puts the current page number with the total number 
of pages, in the report). You can select this paging option on either the 
Header or Footer button’s drop-down menu.
 
Figure 5-9: 
Defining a 
new header 
using the 
buttons on 
the Design 
tab of the 
Header & 
Footer Tools 
contextual 
tab.
 
Check out the results in Figure 5-10, which is the first page of the report in 
Page Layout View. Here you can see the header and footer as they will print. 
You can also see how choosing Page 1 of ? works in the footer: On the first 
page, you see the centered footer Page 1 of 4; on the second page, the cen-
tered footer reads Page 2 of 4.
 
If, after selecting some stock header or footer info, you decide that you 
no longer need either the header or footer printed in your report, you can 
remove it. Simply click the (None) option at the top of the Header button’s 

191
 Chapter 5: Printing the Masterpiece
or Footer button’s drop-down menu. (Remember that the Design tab with 
the Header and Footer command buttons under the Header & Footer Tools 
contextual tab is selected on the Ribbon the moment you click the header or 
footer in Page Layout View.)

Creating a custom header or footer
Most of the time, the stock headers and footers available on the Header but-
ton’s and Footer button’s drop-down menus are sufficient for your report 
printing needs. Occasionally, however, you may want to insert information 
not available in these list boxes or in an arrangement that Excel doesn’t offer 
in the readymade headers and footers.
For those times, you need to use the command buttons that appear in the 
Header & Footer Elements group of the Design tab on the Header & Footer 
Tools contextual tab. These command buttons enable you to blend your own 
information with that generated by Excel into different sections of the custom 
header or footer you’re creating.

192
Part II: Editing without Tears 
The command buttons in the Header & Footer Elements group include:
 
✓ Page Number: Click this button to insert the &[Page] code that puts in 
the current page number.
 
✓ Number of Pages: Click this button to insert the &[Pages] code that 
puts in the total number of pages.
 
✓ Current Date: Click this button to insert the &[Date] code that puts in 
the current date.
 
✓ Current Time: Click this button to insert the &[Time] code that puts in 
the current time.
 
✓ File Path: Click this button to insert the &[Path]&[File] codes that 
put in the directory path along with the name of the workbook file.
 
✓ File Name: Click this button to insert the &[File] code that puts in the 
name of the workbook file.
 
✓ Sheet Name: Click this button to insert the &[Tab] code that puts in the 
name of the worksheet as shown on the sheet tab.
 
✓ Picture: Click this button to insert the &[Picture] code that inserts 
the image that you select from the Insert Picture dialog box that shows 
the contents of the My Pictures folder on your computer by default.
 
✓ Format Picture: Click this button to apply the formatting that you 
choose from the Format Picture dialog box to the &[Picture] code 
that you enter with the Insert Picture button without adding any code of 
its own.
To use these command buttons in the Header & Footer Elements group to 
create a custom header or footer, follow these steps:
 
1. Put your worksheet into Page Layout View by clicking the Page Layout 
View button on the Status bar or by clicking View➪Page Layout View 
on the Ribbon or pressing Alt+WP.
 
 In Page Layout View, the text, Click to Add Header, appears centered 
in the top margin of the first page and the text, Click to Add Footer, 
appears centered in the bottom margin.
 
2. Position the mouse pointer in the top margin to create a custom 
header or the bottom margin to create a custom footer and then click 
the pointer in the left, center, or right section of the header or footer 
to set the insertion point and left-align, center, or right-align the text.
 
 When Excel sets the insertion point, the text, Click to Add Header and 
Click to Add Footer, disappears and the Design tab on the Header & 
Footer Tools contextual tab becomes active on the Ribbon.

193
 Chapter 5: Printing the Masterpiece
 
3. To add program-generated information to your custom header or 
footer (such as the filename, worksheet name, current date, and so 
forth), click the information’s corresponding command button in the 
Header & Footer Elements group.
 
 Excel inserts the appropriate header/footer code preceded by an 
ampersand (&) into the header or footer. These codes are replaced by 
the actual information (filename, worksheet name, graphic image, and 
the like) as soon as you click another section of the header or footer or 
finish the header or footer by clicking the mouse pointer outside of it.
 
4. (Optional) To add your own text to the custom header or footer, type 
it at the insertion point.
 
 When joining program-generated information indicated by a header/
footer code with your own text, be sure to insert the appropriate spaces 
and punctuation. For example, to have Excel display Page 1 of 4 in a 
custom header or footer, you do the following:
 
a. Type the word Page and press the spacebar.
 
b. Click the Page Number command button and press the spacebar 
again.
 
c. Type the word of and press the spacebar a third time.
 
d. Click the Number of Pages command button.
 
 This inserts Page &[Page] of &[Pages] in the custom header (or footer).
 
5. (Optional) To modify the font, font size, or some other font attribute 
of your custom header or footer, drag through its codes and text, click 
the Home tab, and then click the appropriate command button in the 
Font group.
 
 In addition to selecting a new font and font size for the custom header or 
footer, you can add bold, italic, underlining, and a new font color to its 
text with the Bold, Italic, Underline, and Font Color command buttons on 
the Home tab.
 
 After you finish defining and formatting the codes and text for your 
custom header or footer, click a cell in the Worksheet area to deselect 
the header or footer area.
 
 Excel replaces the header/footer codes in the custom header or footer 
with the actual information, while at the same time removing the Header 
& Footer Tools contextual tab from the Ribbon.
Figure 5-11 shows you a custom footer I added to a spreadsheet in Page 
Layout View. This custom footer blends my own text, Preliminary, with pro-
gram-generated sheet name, date, and time information, and uses all three 
sections: left-aligned page information, centered Preliminary warning, and 
right-aligned current date and time.

Creating unique first-page headers and footers
Excel 2010 enables you to define a header or footer for the first page that’s 
different from all the rest of the pages. Simply, click the Different First Page 
check box to put a check mark in it. (This check box is part of the Options 
group of the Design tab on the Header & Footer Tools contextual tab that 
appears when you’re defining or editing a header or footer in Page Layout 
View.)
After selecting the Different First Page check box, go ahead and define the 
unique header and/or footer for just the first page (now marked First Page 
Header or First Page Footer). Then, on the second page of the report, define 
the header and/or footer (marked simply Header or Footer) for the remain-
ing pages of the report (see “Adding an Auto Header or Auto Footer” and 
“Creating a custom header or footer” earlier in the chapter for details).
 
Use this feature when your spreadsheet report has a cover page that needs 
no header or footer. For example, suppose that you have a report that needs 
the current page number and total pages centered at the bottom of all pages 
except the cover page. To do this, select the Different First Page check box 
on the Design tab of the Header & Footer Tools contextual tab on the Ribbon. 
Then define a centered Auto Footer that displays the current page number 
and total pages (Page 1 of ?) on the second page of the report, leaving the 
Click to Add Footer text intact on the first page.

195
 Chapter 5: Printing the Masterpiece
Excel will correctly number both the total number of pages in the report and 
the current page number without printing this information on the first page. 
For example, if your report has six pages (including the cover page), the 
second page footer will read Page 2 of 6; the third page, Page 3 of 6; and so 
on, even if the first printed page has no footer.
Creating even and odd page headers and footers
If you plan to do two-sided printing or copying of your spreadsheet report, 
you may want to define one header or footer for the even pages and another 
for the odd pages of the report. That way, the header or footer information 
(such as the report name or current page) alternates between being right-
aligned on the odd pages (printed on the front side of the page) and being 
left-aligned on the even pages (printed on the back of the page).
To create an alternating header or footer for a report, you click the Different 
Odd & Even Pages check box to put a check mark in it. (This check box is in 
the Options group of the Design tab on the Header & Footer Tools contextual 
tab that appears when you’re defining or editing a header or footer in Page 
Layout View.)
After that, create a header or footer on the first page of the report (now 
marked Odd Page Header or Odd Page Footer) in the third, right-aligned sec-
tion of the header or footer area and then re-create this header or footer on 
the second page (now marked Even Page Header or Even Page Footer), this 
time in the first, left-aligned section.
Solving Page Break Problems
The Page Break preview feature in Excel enables you to spot and fix page 
break problems in an instant, such as when the program wants to split infor-
mation across different pages that you know should always be on the same 
page.
Figure 5-12 shows a worksheet in Page Break Preview with an example of a 
bad vertical page break that you can remedy by adjusting the location of the 
page break on Page 1 and Page 3. Given the page size, orientation, and margin 
settings for this report, Excel breaks the page between columns K and L. 
This break separates the Paid column (L) from all the others in the client list, 
effectively putting this information on its own Page 3 and Page 4 (not shown 
in Figure 5-12).

196
Part II: Editing without Tears 
 
Figure 5-12: 
Preview 
page breaks 
in a report 
with Page 
Break 
Preview.
 
To prevent the data in the Paid column from printing on its own pages, you 
need to move the page break to a column on the left. In this case, I moved the 
page break to between columns G (with the zip code data) and H (contain-
ing the account status information) so that the name and address informa-
tion stays together on Page 1 and Page 2 and the other client data is printed 
together on Page 3 and Page 4. Figure 5-13 shows vertical page breaks in the 
Page Break Preview worksheet view, which you can accomplish by following 
these steps:
 
1. Click the Page Break Preview button (the third one in the cluster to 
the left of the Zoom slider) on the Status bar, or click View➪Page 
Break Preview on the Ribbon or press Alt+WI.
 
 This takes you into a Page Break Preview worksheet view that shows 
your worksheet data at a reduced magnification (60 percent of normal in 
Figure 5-13) with the page numbers displayed in large light type and the 
page breaks shown by heavy lines between the columns and rows of the 
worksheet.
 
 The first time you choose this command, Excel displays a Welcome to 
Page Break Preview dialog box (shown in Figure 5-13). To prevent this 
dialog box from reappearing each time you use Page Break Preview, 
click the Do Not Show This Dialog Again check box before you close the 
Welcome to Page Break Preview alert dialog box.

197
 Chapter 5: Printing the Masterpiece
 
2. Click OK or press Enter to get rid of the Welcome to Page Break 
Preview alert dialog box.
 
3. Position the mouse pointer somewhere on the page break indicator 
(one of the heavy lines surrounding the representation of the page) 
that you need to adjust; when the pointer changes to a double-headed 
arrow, drag the page indicator to the desired column or row and 
release the mouse button.
 
 For the example shown in Figure 5-13, I dragged the page break indica-
tor between Page 1 and Page 3 to the left so that it’s between columns G 
and H. Excel placed the page break at this point, which puts all the name 
and address information together on Page 1 and Page 2. This new page 
break then causes all the other columns of client data to print together 
on Page 3 and Page 4.
 
4. After you finish adjusting the page breaks in Page Break Preview 
(and, presumably, printing the report), click the Normal button (the 
first one in the cluster to the left of the Zoom slider) on the Status bar, 
or click View➪Normal on the Ribbon or press Alt+WL to return the 
worksheet to its regular view of the data.

You can also insert your own manual page breaks at the cell cursor’s position 
by clicking Insert Page Break on the Breaks button’s drop-down menu on the 
Page Layout tab (Alt+PBI) and remove them by clicking Remove Page Break on 
this menu (Alt+PBR). To remove all manual page breaks that you’ve inserted 
into a report, click Reset All Page Breaks on the Breaks button’s drop-down 
menu (Alt+PBA).
Letting Your Formulas All Hang Out
A basic printing technique that you may need occasionally is printing the 
formulas in a worksheet instead of printing the calculated results of the for-
mulas. You can check over a printout of the formulas in your worksheet to 
make sure that you haven’t done anything stupid (like replace a formula with 
a number or use the wrong cell references in a formula) before you distribute 
the worksheet companywide.
Before you can print a worksheet’s formulas, you have to display the for-
mulas, rather than their results, in the cells by clicking the Show Formulas 
button (the one with the icon that looks like a page of a calendar with a tiny 
15 above an fx) in the Formula Auditing group on the Ribbon’s Formulas tab 
(Alt+MH).
Excel then displays the contents of each cell in the worksheet the way they 
appear in the Formula bar or when you’re editing them in the cell. Notice 
that value entries lose their number formatting, formulas appear in their cells 
(Excel widens the columns with best-fit so that the formulas appear in their 
entirety), and long text entries no longer spill into neighboring blank cells.
 
Excel allows you to toggle between the normal cell display and the formula 
cell display by pressing Ctrl+`. (That is, press Ctrl and the key with the tilde 
on top.) This key — usually found in the upper-left corner of your keyboard — 
does double-duty as a tilde and a weird backward accent mark. (Don’t confuse 
that backward accent mark with the apostrophe that appears on a key below 
the quotation mark!)
After Excel displays the formulas in the worksheet, you are ready to print it 
as you would any other report. You can include the worksheet column letters 
and row numbers as headings in the printout so that if you do spot an error, 
you can pinpoint the cell reference right away. 
 
To include the row and column headings in the printout, put a check mark in 
the Print check box in the Headings column on the Sheet Options group of the 
Page Layout tab of the Ribbon before you send the report to the printer.
After you print the worksheet with the formulas, return the worksheet to 
normal by clicking the Show Formulas button on the Formulas tab of the 
Ribbon or by pressing Ctrl+`.

Part III
Getting Organized 
and Staying 
That Way

In this part . . .
I
n today’s business world, we all know how vital it is to 
stay organized — as well as how difficult that can be. 
Keeping straight the spreadsheets that you create in Excel 
2010 is no less important and, in some cases, no less 
arduous.
In this part, I help you tackle this conundrum by giving 
you the inside track on how to keep on top of all the stuff 
in every single worksheet that you create or edit. Not only 
do you discover how to keep track of the information in 
one worksheet, but you also find out how to juggle the 
information from one worksheet to another and even from 
one workbook to another.

Chapter 6
Maintaining the Worksheet
In This Chapter
▶ Zooming in and out on a worksheet
▶ Splitting the workbook window into two or four panes
▶ Freezing columns and rows onscreen for worksheet titles
▶ Attaching comments to cells
▶ Naming your cells
▶ Finding and replacing stuff in your worksheet
▶ Looking up stuff using online resources in the Research task pane
▶ Controlling when you recalculate a worksheet
▶ Protecting your worksheets
E
ach worksheet in Excel 2010 offers an immense place in which to store 
information (and each workbook you open offers you three of these 
babies). But because your computer monitor lets you see only a tiny bit of 
any of the worksheets in a workbook at a time, the issue of keeping on top of 
information is not a small one (pun intended).
Although the Excel worksheet employs a coherent cell-coordinate system 
that you can use to get anywhere in the great big worksheet, you have to 
admit that this A1, B2 stuff — although highly logical — remains fairly alien 
to human thinking. (I mean, saying, “Go to cell IV88,” just doesn’t have any-
where near the same impact as saying, “Go to the corner of Hollywood and 
Vine.”) Consider for a moment the difficulty of coming up with a meaningful 
association between the 2008 depreciation schedule and its location in the 
cell range AC50:AN75 so that you can remember where to find it.
In this chapter, I show you some of the more effective techniques for main-
taining and keeping on top of information. You find out how to change the 
perspective on a worksheet by zooming in and out on the information, how 
to split the document window into separate panes so that you can display dif-
ferent sections of the worksheet at the same time, and how to keep particular 
rows and columns on the screen at all times.

202
Part III: Getting Organized and Staying That Way 
And, as if that weren’t enough, you also see how to add comments to cells, 
assign descriptive, English-type names to cell ranges (like Hollywood_and_
Vine!), and use the Find and Replace commands to locate and, if necessary, 
replace entries anywhere in the worksheet. Finally, you see how to control 
when Excel recalculates the worksheet and how to limit where changes can 
be made.
Zeroing In with Zoom
So what are you going to do now that the boss won’t spring for that 21-inch 
monitor for your computer? All day long, it seems that you’re straining your 
eyes to read all the information in those little, tiny cells or you’re scrolling 
like mad trying to locate a table you can’t seem to find. Never fear, the Zoom 
feature is here in the form of the Zoom slider on the Status bar. You can use 
the Zoom slider to quickly increase the magnification of part of the work-
sheet or shrink it down to the tiniest size.
You can use the Zoom slider on the Status bar of the Excel window in either 
of two ways:
 
✓ Drag the Zoom slider button to the left or the right on the slider to 
decrease or increase the magnification percentage (with 10% magnifica-
tion the lowest percentage when you drag all the way to the left on the 
slider and 400% magnification the highest percentage when you drag all 
the way to the right).
 
✓ Click the Zoom Out (with the minus sign) or the Zoom In button (with 
the plus sign) at either end of the slider to decrease or increase the mag-
nification percentage by 10 percent.
In Figure 6-1, you can see a blowup of the worksheet after increasing it to 
200 percent magnification (twice the normal size). To blow up a worksheet 
like this, drag the Zoom slider button to the right until 200% appears on 
the Status bar to the left of the slider. (You can also do this by clicking 
View➪Zoom and then clicking the 200% button in the Zoom dialog box, if you 
really want to go to all that trouble.) One thing’s for sure: You don’t have 
to go after your glasses to read the names in those enlarged cells! The only 
problem with 200 percent magnification is that you can see only a few cells at 
one time.
In Figure 6-2, check out the same worksheet, this time at 40 percent magnifi-
cation. To reduce the display to this magnification, you drag the Zoom slider 
button to the left until 40% appears on the Status bar in front of the slider.

204
Part III: Getting Organized and Staying That Way 
Whew! At 40 percent of normal screen size, the only thing you can be sure of 
is that you can’t read a thing! However, notice that with this bird’s-eye view, 
you can see at a glance how far over and down the data in this worksheet 
extends and how much empty space there is in the worksheet.
The Zoom dialog box (View➪Zoom or Alt+WQ) offers five precise magnifica-
tion settings — 200%, 100% (normal screen magnification), 75%, 50%, and 
25%. To use other percentages besides those, you have the following options:
 
✓ If you want to use precise percentages other than the five preset per-
centages (such as 150% or 85%) or settings greater or less than the high-
est or lowest percentage (such as 400% or 10%), click within the Custom 
button’s text box in the Zoom dialog box, type the new percentage, and 
press Enter.
 
✓ If you don’t know what percentage to enter in order to display a par-
ticular cell range on the screen, select the range, click View➪Zoom to 
Selection on the Ribbon or press Alt+WG. Excel figures out the percent-
age necessary to fill your screen with just the selected cell range.
 
To quickly return to 100% (normal) magnification in the worksheet after 
selecting any another percentage, all you have to do is click the bar in the 
center of the Zoom slider on the Status bar or click the 100% button on the 
View tab of the Ribbon.
 
You can use the Zoom feature to locate and move to a new cell range in the 
worksheet. First, select a small magnification, such as 50%. Then locate the 
cell range you want to move to and select one of its cells. Finally, use the 
Zoom feature to return the screen magnification to 100%. When Excel returns 
the display to normal size, the cell you select and its surrounding range 
appear onscreen.
Splitting the Difference
Although zooming in and out on the worksheet can help you get your bear-
ings, it can’t bring together two separate sections so that you can compare 
their data on the screen (at least not at a normal size where you can actually 
read the information). To manage this kind of trick, split the Worksheet area 
into separate panes and then scroll the worksheet in each pane so that they 
display the parts you want to compare.
Splitting the window is easy. Look at Figure 6-3 to see an Income Analysis 
worksheet after splitting its worksheet window horizontally into two panes 
and scrolling up rows 38 through 44 in the lower pane. Each pane has its own 
vertical scroll bar, which enables you to scroll different parts of the work-
sheet into view.

205
 Chapter 6: Maintaining the Worksheet
 
Figure 6-3: 
The work-
sheet in

lower pane.
 
To split a worksheet into two (upper and lower) horizontal panes, you can 
drag the split bar, located right above the scroll arrow at the very top of the 
vertical scroll bar, down until the window divides as you want it. Use the fol-
lowing steps:
 
1. Click the vertical split bar and hold down the primary mouse button.
 
 The mouse pointer changes to a double-headed arrow with a split in its 
middle (like the one used to resize rows).
 
2. Drag downward until you reach the row at which you want the docu-
ment window divided.
 
 A gray dividing line appears in the workbook window while you drag 
down, indicating where the window will be split.
 
3. Release the mouse button.
 
 Excel divides the window into horizontal panes at the pointer’s location 
and adds a vertical scroll bar to the new pane.
You can also split the document window into two vertical (left and right) 
panes by following these steps:
 
1. Click the split bar located at the right edge of the horizontal scroll bar.
 
2. Drag to the left until you reach the column at which you want the 
document window divided.

206
Part III: Getting Organized and Staying That Way 
 
3. Release the mouse button.
 
 Excel splits the window at that column and adds a second horizontal 
scroll bar to the new pane.
Don’t confuse the tab split bar to the left of the horizontal scroll bar with 
the horizontal split bar at its right. You drag the tab split bar to increase or 
decrease the number of sheet tabs displayed at the bottom of the workbook 
window; you use the horizontal split bar to divide the workbook window into 
two vertical panes.
 
You can make the panes in a workbook window disappear by double-clicking 
anywhere on the split bar that divides the window rather than having to drag 
the split bar all the way to one of the edges of the window to get rid of it.
Instead of dragging split bars, you can divide a document window by clicking 
the Split button on the Ribbon’s View tab (Alt+WS). When you click this com-
mand button, Excel uses the position of the cell cursor to determine where to 
split the window into panes. The program splits the window vertically at the 
left edge of the pointer and horizontally along the top edge. 
 
If you want the workbook window split into two horizontal panes, position the 
cell cursor in column A of the row in the worksheet where you want it divided. 
(Excel then splits the sheet into panes using the top edge of the cell cursor 
when you click the Split button.) If you want the workbook window split into 
two vertical windows, position the cell cursor in row 1 of the column in the 
worksheet where you want it divided. (Excel then divides the sheet into panes 
using the left edge of the cell cursor when you click the Split button.)
If you position the cell cursor somewhere in the midst of the cells displayed 
onscreen when you click View➪Split or press Alt+WS, Excel splits the window 
into four panes along the top and left edge of the cell cursor. For example, 
if you position the cell cursor in cell B10 of the sample Income Analysis 
worksheet and then click View➪Split, the window splits into four panes: A 
horizontal split occurs between rows 9 and 10, and a vertical split occurs 
between columns A and B (as shown in Figure 6-4).
 
Excel divides whatever portion of the worksheet is displayed onscreen given 
its current magnification into four equal panes when the cell cursor is in cell 
A1 at the time you click View➪Split or press Alt+WS.
After you split the window into panes, you can move the cell cursor into a 
particular pane by clicking one of its cells. To remove the panes from a work-
sheet window, click View➪Split on the Ribbon or press Alt+WS another time.

Fixed Headings Courtesy of Freeze Panes
Panes are great for viewing different parts of the same worksheet that nor-
mally can’t be seen together. You can also use panes to freeze headings in 
the top rows and first columns so that the headings stay in view at all times, 
no matter how you scroll through the worksheet. Frozen headings are espe-
cially helpful when you work with a table that contains information that 
extends beyond the rows and columns shown onscreen.
In Figure 6-5, you can see just such a table. The Income Analysis worksheet 
contains more rows and columns than you can see at one time (unless you 
decrease the magnification to about 40% with Zoom, which makes the data 
too small to read). In fact, this worksheet continues down to row 52 and over 
to column P.
By dividing the worksheet into four panes between rows 2 and 3 and columns 
A and B and then freezing them on the screen, you can keep the column 
headings in row 2 that identify each column of information on the screen 
while you scroll the worksheet up and down to review information on income 
and expenses. Additionally, you can keep the row headings in column A on 
the screen while you scroll the worksheet to the right.

208
Part III: Getting Organized and Staying That Way 
 
Figure 6-5: 
Frozen 
panes keep 
the column 
headings 
and the row 
headings on

Refer to Figure 6-5 to see the worksheet right after splitting the window into 
four panes and freezing them. To create and freeze these panes, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Position the cell cursor in cell B3.
 
2. Click View➪Freeze Panes on the Ribbon and then click Freeze Panes 
on the drop-down menu or press Alt+WFF.
 
 In this example, Excel freezes the top and left pane above row 3 and left 
of column B.
When Excel sets up the frozen panes, the borders of frozen panes are repre-
sented by a single line rather than a thin bar, as is the case when simply split-
ting the worksheet into panes.
See what happens when you scroll the worksheet up after freezing the panes 
(shown in Figure 6-6). In this figure, I scrolled the worksheet up so that rows 
23 through 43 appear under rows 1 and 2. Because the vertical pane with 
the worksheet title and column headings is frozen, it remains onscreen. 
(Normally, rows 1 and 2 would have been the first to disappear when you 
scroll the worksheet up.)

Look to Figure 6-7 to see what happens when you scroll the worksheet to 
the right. In this figure, I scroll the worksheet so that the data in columns 
M through P appear after the data in column A. Because the first column is 
frozen, it remains onscreen, helping you identify the various categories of 
income and expenses for each month.
 
Click Freeze Top Row or Freeze First Column on the Freeze Panes button’s 
drop-down menu to freeze the column headings in the top row of the work-
sheet or the row headings in the first column of the worksheet regardless of 
where the cell cursor is located in the worksheet.
To unfreeze the panes in a worksheet, click View➪Freeze Panes on the 
Ribbon and then click Unfreeze Panes on the Freeze Panes button’s drop-
down menu or press Alt+WFF. Choosing this option removes the panes, indi-
cating that Excel has unfrozen them.
Electronic Sticky Notes
You can add text comments to particular cells in an Excel worksheet. 
Comments act kind of like electronic pop-up versions of sticky notes. For 
example, you can add a comment to yourself to verify a particular figure 

210
Part III: Getting Organized and Staying That Way 
before printing the worksheet or to remind yourself that a particular value is 
only an estimate (or even to remind yourself that it’s your anniversary and to 
pick up a little something special for your spouse on the way home!).
 
In addition to using notes to remind yourself of something you’ve done or that 
remains to be done, you can also use a comment to mark your current place 
in a large worksheet. You can then use the comment’s location to quickly find 
your starting place the next time you work with that worksheet.

Adding a comment to a cell
To add a comment to a cell, follow these steps:
 
1. Move the cell cursor to or click the cell to which you want to add the 
comment.
 
2. Click the New Comment command button on the Ribbon’s Review tab 
or press Alt+RC.
 
 A new text box appears (similar to the one shown in Figure 6-8). This 
text box contains the name of the user as it appears in the User Name 
text box on the General tab in the Excel Options dialog box (Alt+FI) and 

211
 Chapter 6: Maintaining the Worksheet
the insertion point located at the beginning of a new line right below the 
user name.
 
3. Type the text of your comment in the text box that appears.
 
4. When you finish entering the comment text, click somewhere on the 
worksheet outside of the text box.
 
 Excel marks the location of a comment in a cell by adding a tiny triangle 
in the upper-right corner of the cell. (This triangular indicator appears in 
red on a color monitor.)
 
5. To display the comment in a cell, position the thick white cross mouse 
pointer somewhere in the cell with the note indicator.

Comments in review
When you have a workbook with sheets that contain a bunch of comments, 
you probably won’t want to take the time to position the mouse pointer over 
each of its cells in order to read each one. For those times, you need to click 
the Show All Comments command button on the Ribbon’s Review tab (or 
press Alt+RA). When you click Show All Comments on the Review tab, Excels 
displays all the comments in the workbook (as shown in Figure 6-9).

212

Figure 6-9: 
Use the

worksheet.
 
With the Review tab selected in the Ribbon, you can then move back and 
forth from comment to comment by clicking its Next and Previous command 
buttons in the Comments group (Alt+RN and Alt+RV, respectively). When 
you reach the last comment in the workbook, you receive an alert box asking 
you whether you want to continue reviewing the comments from the begin-
ning (which you can do by simply clicking OK). After you finish reviewing the 
comments in your workbook, you can hide their display by clicking the Show 
All Comments command button on the Review tab of the Ribbon or pressing 
Alt+RA a second time.
Editing the comments in a worksheet
To edit the contents of a comment, select it by clicking the Next or Previous 
command button in the Comments group of the Review tab and then click the 
Edit Comment button (which replaces New Comment) or right-click the cell 
with the comment and select Edit Comment from the cell’s shortcut menu.
To change the placement of a comment in relation to its cell, you select the 
comment by clicking somewhere on it and then position the mouse pointer 
on one of the edges of its text box. When a four-headed arrow appears at 
the tip of the mouse pointer, you can drag the text box to a new place in the 

213
 Chapter 6: Maintaining the Worksheet
worksheet. When you release the mouse button, Excel redraws the arrow 
connecting the comment’s text box to the note indicator in the upper-right 
corner of the cell.
To change the size of a comment’s text box, you select the comment, posi-
tion the mouse pointer on one of its sizing handles, and then drag in the 
appropriate direction (away from the center of the box to increase its size or 
toward the center to decrease its size). When you release the mouse button, 
Excel redraws the comment’s text box with the new shape and size. When 
you change the size and shape of a comment’s text box, Excel automatically 
wraps the text to fit in the new shape and size.
To change the font of the comment text, select the text of the comment (by 
selecting the comment for editing and then dragging through the text), right-
click the text box, and then click Format Comment on its shortcut menu (or 
you can press Ctrl+1 as I do). On the Font tab of the Format Cells dialog box 
that appears, you can then use the options to change the font, font style, font 
size, or color of the text displayed in the selected comment.
 
To delete a comment, select the cell with the comment in the worksheet or 
click the Next or Previous command buttons on the Review tab of the Ribbon 
until the comment is selected and then click the Delete command button in 
the Comments group (Alt+RD). Excel removes the comment along with the 
note indicator from the selected cell.
 
You can also delete all comments in the selected range by clicking Clear 
Comments from the Clear button’s drop-down menu (the one with the eraser 
icon in the Editing group) on the Home tab of the Ribbon (Alt+HEM).
Getting your comments in print
When printing a worksheet, you can print comments along with worksheet 
data by selecting either At End of Sheet or As Displayed on Sheet on the 
Comments drop-down list on the Sheet tab of the Page Setup dialog box. 
Open this dialog box by clicking the dialog box launcher in the lower-right 
corner of the Page Setup group on the Ribbon’s Page Layout tab (Alt+PSP).
The Cell Name Game
By assigning descriptive names to cells and cell ranges, you can go a long 
way toward keeping on top of the location of important information in a 
worksheet. Rather than try to associate random cell coordinates with 

214
Part III: Getting Organized and Staying That Way 
specific information, you just have to remember a name. You can also use 
range names to designate the cell selection that you want to print or use in 
other Office 2010 programs, such as Microsoft Word or Access. Best of all, 
after you name a cell or cell range, you can use this name with the Go To 
feature.
If I only had a name . . .
When assigning range names to a cell or cell range, you need to follow a few 
guidelines:
 
✓ Range names must begin with a letter of the alphabet, not a number.
 
 For example, instead of 01Profit, use Profit01.
 
✓ Range names cannot contain spaces.
 
 Instead of a space, use the underscore (Shift+hyphen) to tie the parts of 
the name together. For example, instead of Profit 01, use Profit_01.
 
✓ Range names cannot correspond to cell coordinates in the worksheet.
 
 For example, you can’t name a cell Q1 because this is a valid cell coordi-
nate. Instead, use something like Q1_sales.
To name a cell or cell range in a worksheet, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the cell or cell range that you want to name.
 
2. Click the cell address for the current cell that appears in the Name 
Box on the far left of the Formula bar.
 
 Excel selects the cell address in the Name Box.
 
3. Type the name for the selected cell or cell range in the Name Box.
 
 When typing the range name, you must follow Excel’s naming conven-
tions: Refer to the bulleted list of cell-name do’s and don’ts earlier in this 
section for details.
 
4. Press Enter.
To select a named cell or range in a worksheet, click the range name on the 
Name Box drop-down list. To open this list, click the drop-down arrow button 
that appears to the right of the cell address on the Formula bar.
You can also accomplish the same thing by clicking Home➪Find & Select➪Go 
To or by pressing F5, Ctrl+G, or Alt+HFDG to open the Go To dialog box (see 
Figure 6-10). Double-click the desired range name in the Go To list box (alter-
natively, select the name and click OK or press Enter). Excel moves the cell 
cursor directly to the named cell. If you select a cell range, all the cells in that 
range are selected.

215
 Chapter 6: Maintaining the Worksheet
 
Figure 6-10: 
Select the 
named cell 
range to go 
to in a 
workbook.
 
Name that formula!
Cell names are not only a great way to identify and find cells and cell ranges 
in your spreadsheet, but they’re also a great way to make out the purpose of 
your formulas. For example, suppose that you have a simple formula in cell 
K3 that calculates the total due to you by multiplying the hours you work for 
a client (in cell I3) by the client’s hourly rate (in cell J3). Normally, you would 
enter this formula in cell K3 as
=I3*J3
However, if you assign the name Hours to cell I3 and the name Rate to cell J3, 
in cell K3 you could enter the formula
=Hours*Rate
I don’t think there’s anyone who would dispute that the formula 
=Hours*Rate is much easier to understand than =I3*J3.
To enter a formula using cell names rather than cell references, follow these 
steps (see Chapter 2 to brush up on how to create formulas):
 
1. Assign range names to the individual cells as I describe earlier in this 
section.
 
 For this example, give the name Hours to cell I3 and the name Rate to 
cell J3.
 
2. Place the cell cursor in the cell where the formula is to appear.
 
 For this example, put the cell cursor in cell K3.
 
3. Type = (equal sign) to start the formula.
 
4. Select the first cell referenced in the formula by selecting its cell 
(either by clicking the cell or moving the cell cursor into it).
 
 For this example, you select the Hours cell by selecting cell I3.

216
Part III: Getting Organized and Staying That Way 
 
5. Type the arithmetic operator to use in the formula.
 
 For this example, you would type * (asterisk) for multiplication. (Refer 
to Chapter 2 for a list of the other arithmetic operators.)
 
6. Select the second cell referenced in the formula by selecting its cell 
(either by clicking the cell or moving the cell cursor into it).
 
 For this example, you select the Rate cell by selecting cell J3.
 
7. Click the Enter button or press Enter to complete the formula.
 
 In this example, Excel enters the formula =Hours*Rate in cell K3.
 
You can’t use the fill handle to copy a formula that uses cell names, rather 
than cell addresses, to other cells in a column or row that perform the same 
function (see Chapter 4). When you copy an original formula that uses names 
rather than addresses, Excel copies the original formula without adjusting the 
cell references to the new rows and columns. See the upcoming “Naming con-
stants” section to find a way to use your column and row headings to identify 
the cell references in the copies, and include the original formula from which 
the copies are made.
Naming constants
Certain formulas use constant values, such as an 8.25% tax rate or a 10% dis-
count rate. If you don’t want to have to enter these constants into a cell of 
the worksheet in order to use the formulas, you create range names that hold 
their values and then use their range names in the formulas you create.
For example, to create a constant called tax_rate (of 8.25%), follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Define Name button on the Ribbon’s Formulas tab or press 
Alt+MMD to open the New Name dialog box.
 
2. In the New Name dialog box, type the range name (tax_rate in this 
example) into the Name text box.
 
 Be sure to adhere to the cell range naming conventions when entering 
this new name.
 
3. (Optional) To have the range name defined for just the active work-
sheet instead of the entire workbook, click the name of the sheet on 
the Scope drop-down list.
 
 Normally, you’re safer sticking with the default selection of Workbook 
as the Scope option so that you can use your constant in a formula on 
any of its sheets. Only change the scope to a particular worksheet when 
you’re sure that you’ll use it only in formulas on that worksheet.

217
 Chapter 6: Maintaining the Worksheet
 
4. Click in the Refers To text box after the equal to sign (=) and replace 
(enter) the current cell address with the constant value (8.25% in this 
example) or a formula that calculates the constant.
 
5. Click OK to close the New Name dialog box.
After you assign a constant to a range name by using this method, you can 
apply it to the formulas that you create in the worksheet in one of two ways:
 
✓ Type the range name to which you assign the constant at the place in 
the formula where its value is required.
 
✓ Click the Use in Formula command button on the Formulas tab (or press 
Alt+MS) and then click the constant’s range name on the drop-down 
menu that appears.
 
When you copy a formula that uses a range name containing a constant, its 
values remain unchanged in all copies of the formula that you create with the 
Fill handle. (In other words, range names in formulas act like absolute cell 
addresses in copied formulas — see Chapter 4 for more on copying formulas.)
Also, when you update the constant by changing its value in the Edit Name 
dialog box — opened by clicking the range name in the Name Manager dialog 
box (Alt+MN) and then clicking its Edit button — all the formulas that use 
that constant (by referring to the range name) are automatically updated 
(recalculated) to reflect this change.
Seek and Ye Shall Find . . .
When all else fails, you can use Excel’s Find feature to locate specific infor-
mation in the worksheet. Click Home➪Find & Select➪Find or press Ctrl+F, 
Shift+F5, or even Alt+HFDF to open the Find and Replace dialog box.
In the Find What drop-down box of this dialog box, enter the text or values 
you want to locate and then click the Find Next button or press Enter to start 
the search. Choose the Options button in the Find and Replace dialog box to 
expand the search options (as shown in Figure 6-11).
 
Figure 6-11: 
Use options 
in the Find 
and Replace 
dialog box 
to locate 
cell entries.
 

218
Part III: Getting Organized and Staying That Way 
When you search for a text entry with the Find and Replace feature, be mind-
ful of whether the text or number you enter in the Find What text box is sepa-
rate in its cell or occurs as part of another word or value. For example, if you 
enter the characters in in the Find What text box and you don’t select the 
Match Entire Cell Contents check box, Excel finds
 
✓ The In in Regional Income 2010 in cell A1
 
✓ The In in International in A8, A16, A24 and so on
 
✓ The in in Total Operating Expenses in cell A25
If you select the Match Entire Cell Contents check box in the Find and 
Replace dialog box before starting the search, Excel would not consider the 
anything in the sheet to be a match because all entries have other text sur-
rounding the text you’re searching for. If you had the state abbreviation for 
Indiana (IN) in a cell by itself and had chosen the Match Entire Cell Contents 
option, Excel would find that cell.
When you search for text, you can also specify whether you want Excel to 
match the case you use (uppercase or lowercase) when entering the search 
text in the Find What text box. By default, Excel ignores case differences 
between text in cells of your worksheet and the search text you enter in the 
Find What text box. To conduct a case-sensitive search, you need to select 
the Match Case check box (available when you click the Options button to 
expand the Find and Replace dialog box, shown in Figure 6-11).
If the text or values that you want to locate in the worksheet have special 
formatting, you can specify the formatting to match when conducting the 
search.
To have Excel match the formatting assigned to a particular cell in the work-
sheet, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the drop-down button on the right of the Format button in the 
Find and Replace dialog box and choose the Choose Format from Cell 
option on the pop-up menu.
 
 The Find and Replace dialog box temporarily disappears, and Excel adds 
an ink dropper icon to the normal white cross mouse pointer.
 
2. Click this mouse pointer in the cell in the worksheet that contains the 
formatting you want to match.
 
 The Find and Replace dialog box reappears, and the Find and Replace 
feature picks up the cell’s formatting.

219
 Chapter 6: Maintaining the Worksheet
To select the formatting to match in the search from the options on the Find 
Format dialog box (which are identical to those of the Format Cells dialog 
box), follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Format button or click its drop-down button and choose 
Format from its menu.
 
2. Then, select the formatting options to match from the various tabs 
(refer to Chapter 3 for help on selecting these options) and click OK.
When you use either of these methods to select the kinds of formatting to 
match in your search, the No Format Set button (located between the Find 
What text box and the Format button) changes to a Preview button. The 
word Preview in this button appears in whatever font and attributes Excel 
picks up from the sample cell or through your selections in the Find Format 
dialog box. To reset the Find and Replace to search across all formats again, 
click Format➪Clear Find Format, and No Form Set will appear again between 
the Find What and Format buttons.
When you search for values in the worksheet, be mindful of the difference 
between formulas and values. For example, say cell K24 of your worksheet 
contains the computed value $15,000 (from a formula that multiplies a value 
in cell I24 by that in cell J24). If you type 15000 in the Find What text box and 
press Enter to search for this value, instead of finding the value 15000 in cell 
K24, Excel displays an alert box with the following message:
Microsoft Excel cannot find the data you’re searching for
This is because the value in this cell is calculated by the formula
=I24*J24
The value 15000 doesn’t appear in that formula. To have Excel find any entry 
matching 15000 in the cells of the worksheet, you need to choose Values in 
the Look In drop-down menu of the Find and Replace dialog box in place of 
the normally used Formulas option.
 
To restrict the search to just the text or values in the text of the comments 
in the worksheet, choose the Comments option from the Look In drop-down 
menu.
If you don’t know the exact spelling of the word or name or the precise value 
or formula you’re searching for, you can use wildcards, which are symbols 
that stand for missing or unknown text. Use the question mark (?) to stand 

220
Part III: Getting Organized and Staying That Way 
for a single unknown character; use the asterisk (*) to stand for any number 
of missing characters. Suppose that you enter the following in the Find What 
text box and choose the Values option in the Look In drop-down menu:
7*4
Excel stops at cells that contain the values 74, 704, and 75,234. Excel even 
finds the text entry 782 4th Street!
If you actually want to search for an asterisk in the worksheet rather than use 
the asterisk as a wildcard, precede it with a tilde (~), as follows:
~*4
This arrangement enables you to search the formulas in the worksheet for 
one that multiplies by the number 4. (Remember that Excel uses the asterisk 
as the multiplication sign.)
The following entry in the Find What text box finds cells that contain Jan, 
January, June, Janet, and so on.
J?n*
 
Normally, Excel searches only the current worksheet for the search text you 
enter. If you want the program to search all the worksheets in the workbook, 
you must select the Workbook option from the Within drop-down menu.
When Excel locates a cell in the worksheet that contains the text or values 
you’re searching for, it selects that cell while leaving the Find and Replace 
dialog box open. (Remember that you can move the Find and Replace dialog 
box if it obscures your view of the cell.) To search for the next occurrence of 
the text or value, click the Find Next button or press Enter.
Excel normally searches down the worksheet by rows. To search across the 
columns first, choose the By Columns option in the Search drop-down menu. 
To reverse the search direction and revisit previous occurrences of match-
ing cell entries, press the Shift key while you click the Find Next button in the 
Find and Replace dialog box.
You Can Be Replaced!
If your purpose for finding a cell with a particular entry is so that you can 
change it, you can automate this process by using the Replace tab on the 
Find and Replace dialog box. If you click Home➪Find & Select➪Replace or 
press Ctrl+H or Alt+HFDR, Excel opens the Find and Replace dialog box with 

221
 Chapter 6: Maintaining the Worksheet
the Replace tab (rather than the Find tab) selected. On the Replace tab, enter 
the text or value you want to replace in the Find What text box, and then 
enter the replacement text or value in the Replace With text box.
When you enter replacement text, enter it exactly how you want it to appear 
in the cell. In other words, if you want to replace all occurrences of Jan in the 
worksheet with January, enter the following in the Replace With text box:
January
Make sure that you use a capital J in the Replace With text box, even though 
you can enter the following in the Find What text box (providing you don’t 
check the Match Case check box that appears only when you choose the 
Options button to expand the Find and Replace dialog box options):
jan
After specifying what to replace and what to replace it with (as shown in 
Figure 6-12), you can have Excel replace occurrences in the worksheet on a 
case-by-case basis or globally. To replace all occurrences in a single opera-
tion, click the Replace All button.
 
Figure 6-12: 
Use Replace 
options to 
change par-
ticular cell 
entries.
 
 
Be careful with global search-and-replace operations; they can really mess up 
a worksheet in a hurry if you inadvertently replace values, parts of formulas, 
or characters in titles and headings that you hadn’t intended to change. With 
this in mind, always follow one rule:
Never undertake a global search-and-replace operation on an unsaved 
worksheet.
Also, verify whether the Match Entire Cell Contents check box (displayed 
only when you click the Options>> button) is selected before you begin. You 
can end up with many unwanted replacements if you leave this check box 
unselected when you really only want to replace entire cell entries (rather 
than matching parts in cell entries).

222
Part III: Getting Organized and Staying That Way 
 
If you do make a mess, immediately click the Undo button on the Quick Access 
toolbar or press Ctrl+Z to restore the worksheet.
To see each occurrence before you replace it, click the Find Next button or 
press Enter. Excel selects the next cell with the text or value you enter in 
the Find What text box. To have the program replace the selected text, click 
the Replace button. To skip this occurrence, click the Find Next button to 
continue the search. When you finish replacing occurrences, click the Close 
button to close the Find and Replace dialog box.
Do Your Research
Excel 2010 includes the Research task pane that you can use to search for 
information using such online resources as Bing; Encarta Dictionary: English 
(North America); English, French, and Spanish Thesaurus; as well as MSN 
Money Stock Quotes. (Because these resources are online, to make use of the 
Research task pane, you must have Internet access available.)
To open the Research task pane (similar to the one shown in Figure 6-13), 
click the Research command button on the Ribbon’s Review tab or press 
Alt+RR.
 
Figure 6-13: 
Looking up 
the stock 
quotes for 
Microsoft 
Corp (MSFT) 
in the

task pane.
 

223
 Chapter 6: Maintaining the Worksheet
To look up something in the Research pane, enter the word or phrase you 
want to locate within the online resources using the Search For text box 
at the top of the Research pane. Then click the type of online reference to 
search on the Show Results From drop-down menu:
 
✓ All Reference Books to search for the word or phrase in any of the 
online reference books, such as the Encarta Dictionary: English (North 
America), Thesaurus: English (U.S.), and so on
 
✓ All Research Sites to look up the word or phrase in any online resource 
or any Web site such as Bing, Factiva iWorks, and HighBeam Research
 
✓ All Business and Financial Sites to look up the word or phrase in MSN 
Money Stock Quotes and Thomson Gale Company Profiles
To start the online search, click the Start Searching button to the immediate 
right of the Search For text box. Excel then connects you to the designated 
online resources and displays the search results in the list box below. Figure 
6-13, for example, shows the various stock quotes for Microsoft Corporation 
for the day and time I did the search using MSN Money Stock Quotes.
When you include Web sites in your search, you can visit particular sites by 
clicking their links in the Research task pane. When you do, Windows then 
launches your default Web browser (such as Internet Explorer 8) and con-
nects you to the linked page. To return to Excel after visiting a particular 
Web page, simply click the Close box in the upper-right corner of your Web 
browser’s window.
 
You can modify which online services are available for use in a search by 
clicking the Research Options link that appears at the very bottom of the 
Research task pane. When you click this link, Excel opens a Research Options 
dialog box that enables you to add or remove particular reference books and 
sites by selecting their check boxes.
You Can Be So Calculating
Although extremely important, locating information in a worksheet is only 
part of keeping on top of the information in a worksheet. In really large work-
books that contain many completed worksheets, you may want to switch to 
manual recalculation so that you can control when the formulas in the work-
sheet are calculated. You need this kind of control when you find that Excel’s 
recalculation of formulas each time you enter or change information in cells 
has slowed the program’s response to a crawl. By holding off recalculations 
until you are ready to save or print the workbook, you find that you can work 
with Excel’s worksheets without interminable delays.

224
Part III: Getting Organized and Staying That Way 
To put the workbook into manual recalculation mode, click the Calculation 
Options button in the Calculation group on the Ribbon’s Formulas tab 
and then click the Manual option on the drop-down menu or simply press 
Alt+MXM. After switching to manual recalculation, Excel displays Calculate 
on the status bar whenever you make a change to the worksheet that some-
how affects the current values of its formulas. Whenever you see Calculate on 
the Status bar, you need to bring the formulas up-to-date before saving the 
workbook (as you would before you print its worksheets).
To recalculate the formulas in a workbook when calculation is manual, press 
F9 or Ctrl+= (equal sign) or click the Calculate Now button (the one with a 
picture of a calculator in the upper-right corner of the Calculation group) on 
the Formulas tab (Alt+MB).
Excel then recalculates the formulas in all the worksheets of your workbook. 
If you made changes to only the current worksheet and you don’t want to 
wait around for Excel to recalculate every other worksheet in the workbook, 
you can restrict the recalculation to the current worksheet. Press Shift+F9 or 
click the Calculate Sheet button (the one with picture of a calculator under 
the worksheet in the lower-right corner of the Calculation group) on the 
Formulas tab (Alt+MJ).
 
If your worksheet contains data tables that perform different what-if scenarios 
(see Chapter 8 for details), you can have Excel automatically recalculate all 
parts of the worksheet except for those data tables by clicking Automatic 
Except Data Tables on the Calculation Options button’s drop-down menu on 
the Formulas tab (Alt+MXE).
 
To return a workbook to fully automatic recalculation mode, click the 
Automatic option on the Calculation Options button’s drop-down menu on the 
Formulas tab (Alt+MXA).
Putting on the Protection
After you more or less finalize a worksheet by checking out its formulas and 
proofing its text, you often want to guard against any unplanned changes by 
protecting the document.
Each cell in the worksheet can be locked or unlocked. By default, Excel locks 
all the cells in a worksheet so that, when you follow these steps, Excel locks 
the whole thing up tighter than a drum.
 
1. Click the Protect Sheet command button in the Changes group on the 
Ribbon’s Review tab or press Alt+RPS.

225
 Chapter 6: Maintaining the Worksheet
 
 Excel opens the Protect Sheet dialog box (see Figure 6-14) in which you 
select the check box options you want to be available when the protec-
tion is turned on in the worksheet. By default, Excel selects the Protect 
Worksheet and Contents of Locked Cells check box at the top of the 
Protect Sheet dialog box. Additionally, the program selects both the 
Select Locked Cells and Select Unlocked Cells check boxes in the Allow 
All Users of This Worksheet To list box below.
 
Figure 6-14:

options in 
the Protect 
Sheet dialog 
box.
 
 
2. (Optional) Click any of the check box options in the Allow All Users of 
This Worksheet To list box (such as Format Cells or Insert Columns) 
that you still want to be functional when the worksheet protection is 
operational.
 
3. If you want to assign a password that must be supplied before you can 
remove the protection from the worksheet, type the password in the 
Password to Unprotect Sheet text box.
 
4. Click OK or press Enter.
 
 If you type a password in the Password to Unprotect Sheet text box, 
Excel opens the Confirm Password dialog box. Re-enter the password in 
the Reenter Password to Proceed text box exactly as you typed it in the 
Password to Unprotect Sheet text box in the Protect Sheet dialog box 
and then click OK or press Enter.
If you want to go a step further and protect the layout of the worksheets in 
the workbook, you protect the entire workbook as follows:
 
1. Click the Protect Workbook command button in the Changes group on 
the Ribbon’s Review tab or press Alt+RPW.
 
 Excel opens the Protect Structure and Windows dialog box, where the 
Structure check box is selected and the Windows check box is not 
selected. With the Structure check box selected, Excel won’t let you 

226
Part III: Getting Organized and Staying That Way 
mess around with the sheets in the workbook (by deleting them or rear-
ranging them). If you want to protect any windows that you set up (as 
I describe in Chapter 7), you need to select the Windows check box as 
well.
 
2. To assign a password that must be supplied before you can remove 
the protection from the worksheet, type the password in the Password 
(Optional) text box.
 
3. Click OK or press Enter.
 
 If you type a password in the Password (Optional) text box, Excel opens 
the Confirm Password dialog box. Re-enter the password in the Reenter 
Password to Proceed text box exactly as you typed it into the Password 
(Optional) text box in the Protect Structure and Windows dialog box and 
then click OK or press Enter.
Selecting the Protect Sheet command makes it impossible to make further 
changes to the contents of any of the locked cells in that worksheet except 
for those options that you specifically exempt in the Allow All Users of This 
Worksheet To list box. (See Step 2 in the first set of steps in this section.) 
Selecting the Protect Workbook command makes it impossible to make fur-
ther changes to the layout of the worksheets in that workbook.
Excel displays an alert dialog box with the following message when you try to 
edit or replace an entry in a locked cell:
The cell or chart you are trying to change is protected
and therefore read-only.
To modify a protected cell or chart, first remove
protection using the Unprotect Sheet command (Review
tab, Changes group). You may be prompted for a 
password.
Usually, your intention in protecting a worksheet or an entire workbook is 
not to prevent all changes but to prevent changes in certain areas of the 
worksheet. For example, in a budget worksheet, you may want to protect all 
the cells that contain headings and formulas but allow changes in all the cells 
where you enter the budgeted amounts. That way, you can’t inadvertently 
wipe out a title or formula in the worksheet simply by entering a value in the 
wrong column or row (a common occurrence).
 
To leave certain cells unlocked so that you can still change them after protect-
ing the worksheet or workbook, select all the cells as the cell selection, open 
the Format Cells dialog box (Ctrl+1), and then click the Locked check box on 
the Protection tab to remove its check mark. Then, after unlocking the cells 
that you still want to be able to change, protect the worksheet as described 
earlier.

227
 Chapter 6: Maintaining the Worksheet
To remove protection from the current worksheet or workbook document so 
that you can again make changes to its cells (whether locked or unlocked), 
click the Unprotect Sheet or the Unprotect Workbook command button in the 
Changes group on the Ribbon’s Review tab (or press Alt+RPS and Alt+RPW, 
respectively). If you assign a password when protecting the worksheet or 
workbook, you must then reproduce the password exactly as you assigned 
it (including any case differences) in the Password text box of the Unprotect 
Sheet or Unprotect Workbook dialog box.
To protect and share . . .
If you create a workbook with contents updated 
by several users on your network, you can use 
the Protect and Share Workbook command 
button in the Changes group of the Ribbon’s 
Review tab (Alt+RO) to ensure that Excel tracks 
all the changes made and that no user can 
intentionally or inadvertently remove Excel’s 
tracking of the changes made. To do this, simply 
select the Sharing with Track Changes check 
box in the Protect Shared Workbook dialog box 
that appears after you choose the command 
button. After you select this check box, you can 
add a password in the Password (Optional) text 
box below that each user must supply before 
he or she can open the workbook to make any 
changes. Then click OK or press Enter.

take. However, after you get a little experience under your belt, you’ll find that 
working with more than one worksheet in a workbook is no more taxing than 
working with just a single worksheet.
 
Don’t confuse the term workbook with worksheet. The workbook forms the 
document (file) that you open and save while you work. Each workbook (file) 
normally contains three blank worksheets. These worksheets are like the 
loose-leaf pages in a notebook binder; you can delete or add what you need. 
To help you keep track of the worksheets in your workbook and navigate 
between them, Excel provides sheet tabs (Sheet1, Sheet 2, and Sheet3) that 
are like the tab dividers in a loose-leaf notebook.
Juggling Worksheets
You need to see how to work with more than one worksheet in a workbook, 
but it’s also important to know why you’d want to do such a crazy thing in 
the first place. The most common situation is, of course, when you have 

230
Part III: Getting Organized and Staying That Way 
a bunch of worksheets that are related to each other and, therefore, natu-
rally belong together in the same workbook. For example, consider the case 
of Mother Goose Enterprises with its different companies: Jack Sprat Diet 
Centers, Jack and Jill Trauma Centers, Mother Hubbard Dog Goodies; Rub-a-
Dub-Dub Hot Tubs and Spas; Georgie Porgie Pudding Pies; Hickory, Dickory, 
Dock Clock Repair; Little Bo Peep Pet Detectives; Simple Simon Pie Shoppes; 
and Jack Be Nimble Candlesticks. To keep track of the annual sales for all 
these companies, you could create a workbook containing a worksheet for 
each of the nine different companies.
By keeping the sales figures for each company in a different sheet of the same 
workbook, you gain all the following benefits:
 
✓ You can enter the stuff that’s needed in all the sales worksheets (if you 
select those sheet tabs) just by typing it once into the first worksheet 
(see the section “Editing en masse,” later in this chapter).
 
✓ In order to help you build the worksheet for the first company’s sales, 
you can attach macros to the current workbook so that they are readily 
available when you create the worksheets for the other companies. (A 
macro is a sequence of frequently performed, repetitive tasks and calcu-
lations that you record for easy playback — see Chapter 12 for details.)
 
✓ You can quickly compare the sales of one company with the sales of 
another (see the section “Opening Windows on Your Worksheets,” later 
in this chapter).
 
✓ You can print all the sales information for each company as a single 
report in one printing operation. (Read Chapter 5 for specifics on print-
ing an entire workbook or particular worksheets in a workbook.)
 
✓ You can easily create charts that compare certain sales data from differ-
ent worksheets (see Chapter 10 for details).
 
✓ You can easily set up a summary worksheet with formulas that total the 
quarterly and annual sales for all nine companies (see the upcoming “To 
Sum Up . . .” section).
Sliding between the sheets
Each workbook that you create contains three worksheets, rather predict-
ably named Sheet1, Sheet 2, and Sheet3. In typical Excel fashion, these names 
appear on tabs at the bottom of the workbook window. To go from one work-
sheet to another, you simply click the tab that contains the name of the sheet 
you want to see. Excel then brings that worksheet to the top of the stack, dis-
playing its information in the current workbook window. You can always tell 
which worksheet is current because its name is in bold type on the tab and 
its tab appears as an extension of the current worksheet without any dividing 
line.

231
 Chapter 7: Maintaining Multiple Worksheets
The only problem with moving to a new sheet by clicking its sheet tab occurs 
when you add so many worksheets to a workbook (as I describe in the 
upcoming section “Don’t Short-Sheet Me!”) that not all the sheet tabs are vis-
ible at any one time, and the sheet tab you want to click is not visible in the 
workbook. To deal with this problem, Excel provides Tab scrolling buttons 
(shown in the lower-left corner of Figure 7-1) that you can use to bring new 
sheet tabs into view.
 
✓ Click the Next tab scroll button (with the triangle pointing right) to bring 
the next unseen tab of the sheet on the right into view. Hold down the 
Shift key while you click this button to scroll several tabs at a time.
 
✓ Click the Previous tab scroll button (with the triangle pointing left) to 
bring the next unseen tab of the sheet on the left into view. Hold down 
the Shift key while you click this button to scroll several tabs at a time.
 
✓ Click the Last tab scroll button (with the triangle pointing right to the 
vertical bar) to bring the last group of sheet tabs, including the very last 
tab, into view.
 
✓ Click the First tab scroll button (with the triangle pointing left to the ver-
tical bar) to bring the first group of sheet tabs, including the very first 
tab, into view.

Going sheet to sheet via the keyboard
You can forget all about the darned Tab scroll-
ing buttons and sheet tabs and just go back 
and forth through the sheets in a workbook 
with your keyboard. To move to the next work-
sheet in a workbook, press Ctrl+PgDn. To move 
to the previous worksheet in a workbook, press 
Ctrl+PgUp. The nice thing about using the key-
board shortcuts Ctrl+PgDn and Ctrl+PgUp is 
that they work whether or not the next or pre-
vious sheet tab is displayed in the workbook 
window!
 
Just don’t forget that scrolling the sheet tab into view is not the same thing as 
selecting it: You still need to click the tab for the desired sheet to bring it to 
the front of the stack. You can also display a pop-up list of all the sheets in the 
current workbook and then select a particular sheet by right-clicking the Tab 
scroll buttons and then clicking the name of the sheet to select from the list.
 
To make it easier to find the sheet tab you want to select without having to do 
an inordinate amount of tab scrolling, drag the Tab split bar (see Figure 7-2) to 
the right to reveal more sheet tabs (consequently making the horizontal scroll 
bar shorter). If you don’t care at all about using the horizontal scroll bar, you 
can maximize the number of sheet tabs in view by actually getting rid of this 
scroll bar. To do this, drag the Tab split bar to the right until it’s smack up 
against the vertical split bar.
 
Figure 7-2: 
Drag the 
Tab split bar 
to the right 
to display 
more sheet 
tabs as you 
make the 
horizontal 
scroll bar 
shorter.
 

233
 Chapter 7: Maintaining Multiple Worksheets
When you want to restore the horizontal scroll bar to its normal length, you 
can either manually drag the Tab split bar to the left or simply double-click it.
Editing en masse
Each time you click a sheet tab, you select that worksheet and make it active, 
enabling you to make whatever changes are necessary to its cells. You may 
encounter times, however, when you want to select bunches of worksheets 
so that you can make the same editing changes to all of them simultaneously. 
When you select multiple worksheets, any editing change that you make to 
the current worksheet — such as entering information in cells or deleting 
stuff from them — affects the same cells in all the selected sheets in exactly 
the same way.
Suppose you need to set up a new workbook with three worksheets that 
contain the names of the months across row 3 beginning in column B. Prior 
to entering January in cell B3 and using the AutoFill handle (as described in 
Chapter 2) to fill in the 11 months across row 3, you select all three work-
sheets (Sheet1, Sheet2, and Sheet3, for argument’s sake). When you enter 
the names of the months in the third row of the first sheet, Excel will insert 
the names of the months in row 3 of all three selected worksheets. (Pretty 
slick, huh?)
Likewise, suppose you have another workbook in which you need 
to get rid of Sheet2 and Sheet3. Instead of clicking Sheet2, clicking 
Home➪Delete➪Delete Sheet on the Ribbon or pressing Alt+HDS, and then 
clicking Sheet3 and repeating the Delete Sheet command, select both work-
sheets and then zap them out of existence in one fell swoop by clicking 
Home➪Delete➪Delete Sheet on the Ribbon or pressing Alt+HDS.
To select a bunch of worksheets in a workbook, you have the following 
choices:
 
✓ To select a group of neighboring worksheets, click the first sheet tab 
and then scroll the sheet tabs until you see the tab of the last worksheet 
you want to select. Hold the Shift key while you click the last sheet tab 
to select all the tabs in between — the old Shift-click method applied to 
worksheet tabs.
 
✓ To select a group of non-neighboring worksheets, click the first sheet 
tab and then hold down the Ctrl key while you click the tabs of the other 
sheets you want to select.

234
Part III: Getting Organized and Staying That Way 
 
✓ To select all the sheets in the workbook, right-click the tab of the work-
sheet that you want active and choose Select All Sheets from its short-
cut menu that appears.
Excel shows you worksheets that you select by turning their sheet tabs 
white (although only the active sheet’s tab name appears in bold) and dis-
playing [Group] after the filename of the workbook on the Excel window’s 
title bar.
 
To deselect the group of worksheets when you finish your group editing, you 
simply click a nonselected (that is, grayed out) worksheet tab. You can also 
deselect all the selected worksheets other than the one you want active by 
right-clicking the tab of the sheet you want displayed in the workbook window 
and then clicking Ungroup Sheets on its shortcut menu.
Don’t Short-Sheet Me!
For some of you, the three worksheets automatically put into each new work-
book that you start are as many as you would ever, ever need (or want) to 
use. For others of you, a measly three worksheets might seldom, if ever, be 
sufficient for the workbooks you create (for example, suppose that your com-
pany operates in 10 locations, or you routinely create budgets for 20 different 
departments or track expenses for 40 account representatives).
 
Excel 2010 makes it a snap to insert additional worksheets in a workbook (up 
to 255 total) — simply click the Insert Worksheet button that appears to the 
immediate right of the last sheet tab.
To insert a bunch of new worksheets in a row in the workbook, select a group 
with the same number of tabs as the number of new worksheets you want to 
add, starting with the tab where you want to insert the new worksheets. Next, 
click Home➪Insert➪Insert Sheet on the Ribbon or press Alt+HIS.
To delete a worksheet from the workbook, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the tab of the worksheet that you want to delete.
 
2. Click Home➪Delete➪Delete Sheet on the Ribbon or press Alt+HDS or 
right-click the tab and choose Delete from its shortcut menu.
 
 If the sheet you’re deleting contains any data, Excel displays a scary 
message in an alert box about how you’re going to delete the selected 
sheets permanently.

235
 Chapter 7: Maintaining Multiple Worksheets
 
3. Go ahead and click the Delete button or press Enter if you’re sure that 
you won’t be losing any data you need when Excel zaps the entire 
sheet.
 
 This is one of those situations where Undo is powerless to put things 
right by restoring the deleted sheet to the workbook.
To delete a bunch of worksheets from the workbook, select all the work-
sheets you want to delete and then click Home➪Delete➪Delete Sheet, press 
Alt+HDS, or choose Delete from the tab’s shortcut menu. Then, when you’re 
sure that none of the worksheets will be missed, click the Delete button or 
press Enter when the alert dialog box appears.
 
If you find yourself constantly monkeying around with the number of work-
sheets in a workbook, either by adding a bunch of new worksheets or delet-
ing all but one, you may want to think about changing the default number of 
worksheets so that the next time you open a new workbook, you have a more 
realistic number of sheets on hand. To change the default number, choose 
File➪Options or press Alt+FI to open the General tab of the Excel Options 
dialog box. Enter a new number between 1 and 255 in the Include This Many 
Sheets text box in the When Creating New Workbooks section or select a new 
number with the spinner buttons before you click OK.
A worksheet by any other name . . .
The sheet names that Excel comes up with for the tabs in a workbook 
(Sheet1, Sheet2, Sheet3) are, to put it mildly, not very original — and are cer-
tainly not descriptive of their function in life! Luckily, you can easily rename 
a worksheet tab to whatever helps you remember what you put on the work-
sheet (provided this descriptive name is no longer than 31 characters).
To rename a worksheet tab, just follow these steps:
 
1. Double-click the sheet tab or right-click the sheet tab and then click 
Rename on its shortcut menu.
 
 The current name on the sheet tab appears selected.
 
2. Replace the current name on the sheet tab by typing the new sheet 
name.
 
3. Press Enter.
 
 Excel displays the new sheet name on its tab at the bottom of the work-
book window.

236
Part III: Getting Organized and Staying That Way 
A sheet tab by any other color . . .
In Excel 2010, you can assign colors to the different worksheet tabs. This fea-
ture enables you to color-code different worksheets. For example, you could 
assign red to the tabs of those worksheets that need immediate checking and 
blue to the tabs of those sheets that you’ve already checked.
To assign a color to a worksheet tab, right-click the tab and highlight Tab 
Color on its shortcut menu to open a submenu containing the Tab Color 
pop-up palette. Then, click the new color for the tab by clicking its color 
square on the color palette. After you select a new color for a sheet tab, 
the name of the active sheet tab appears underlined in the color you just 
selected. When you make another sheet tab active, the entire tab takes on the 
assigned color (and the text of the tab name changes to white if the selected 
color is sufficiently dark enough that black lettering is impossible to read).
 
To remove a color from a tab, right-click the sheet tab and highlight the Tab 
Color option to open the Tab Color pop-up palette. Then, click No Color at the 
bottom of the Tab Color palette.
Getting your sheets in order
Sometimes, you may find that you need to change the order in which the 
sheets appear in the workbook. Excel makes this possible by letting you drag 
Short and sweet (sheet names)
Although Excel allows up to 31 characters 
(including spaces) for a sheet name, you want 
to keep your sheet names much briefer for two 
reasons:
 ✓ The longer the name, the longer the sheet 
tab. The longer the sheet tab, the fewer 
the tabs that can display and the more tab 
scrolling you have to do to select the sheets 
you want to work with.
 ✓ Should you start creating formulas that 
use cells in different worksheets (see the 
upcoming section “To Sum Up . . .” for an 
example), Excel uses the sheet name as 
part of the cell reference in the formula. 
(How else could Excel keep straight the 
value in cell C1 on Sheet1 from the value in 
cell C1 on Sheet2?) Therefore, if your sheet 
names are long, you end up with unwieldy 
formulas in the cells and on the Formula bar 
even when you’re dealing with simple for-
mulas that only refer to cells in a couple of 
different worksheets.
Generally, the fewer characters in a sheet 
name, the better. Also, remember that each 
name must be unique — no duplicates allowed.

237
 Chapter 7: Maintaining Multiple Worksheets
the tab of the sheet you want to arrange in the workbook to the place where 
you want to insert it. While you drag the tab, the pointer changes to a sheet 
icon with an arrowhead on it, and the program marks your progress among 
the sheet tabs (see Figures 7-3 and 7-4 for examples). When you release the 
mouse button, Excel reorders the worksheets in the workbook by inserting 
the sheet at the place where you dropped the tab off.
 
If you hold down the Ctrl key while you drag the sheet tab icon, Excel inserts 
a copy of the worksheet at the place where you release the mouse button. 
You can tell that Excel is copying the sheet rather than just moving it in the 
workbook because the pointer shows a plus sign (+) on the sheet tab icon 
containing the arrowhead. When you release the mouse button, Excel inserts 
the copy in the workbook, which is designated by the addition of (2) after the 
tab name. 
For example, if you copy Sheet5 to another place in the workbook, the sheet 
tab of the copy is named Sheet5 (2). You can then rename the tab to some-
thing civilized (see the earlier section “A worksheet by any other name . . .” 
for details).

You can also move or copy worksheets from one part of a workbook to 
another by activating the sheet that you want to move or copy and then 
choosing Move or Copy on its shortcut menu. In the Before Sheet list box 
in the Move or Copy dialog box, click the name of the worksheet in front of 
which you want the active sheet moved or copied.
To move the active sheet immediately ahead of the sheet you select in the 
Before Sheet list box, simply click OK. To copy the active sheet, be sure to 
select the Create a Copy check box before you click OK. If you copy a work-
sheet instead of just moving it, Excel adds a number to the sheet name. For 
example, if you copy a sheet named Total Income, Excel automatically names 
the copy of the worksheet Total Income (2), which appears on its sheet tab.
Opening Windows on Your Worksheets
Just as you can split a single worksheet into panes so that you can view and 
compare different parts of that same sheet on the screen (see Chapter 6), 
you can split a single workbook into worksheet windows and then arrange 
the windows so that you can view different parts of each worksheet on the 
screen.

239
 Chapter 7: Maintaining Multiple Worksheets
To open the worksheets that you want to compare in different windows, you 
simply insert new workbook windows (in addition to the one that Excel auto-
matically opens when you open the workbook file itself) and then select the 
worksheet that you want to display in the new window. You can accomplish 
this with the following steps:
 
1. Click the New Window command button on the Ribbon’s View tab or 
press Alt+WN to create a second worksheet window; then click the tab 
of the worksheet that you want to display in this second window (indi-
cated by the :2 that Excel adds to the end of the filename in the title 
bar).
 
2. Click the New Window command button or press Alt+WN again to 
create a third worksheet window; then click the tab of the worksheet 
that you want to display in this third window (indicated by the :3 that 
Excel adds to the end of the filename in the title bar).
 
3. Continue clicking the New Window command button or pressing 
Alt+WN to create a new window and then selecting the tab of the 
worksheet you want to display in that window for each worksheet you 
want to compare.
 
4. Click the Arrange All command button on the View tab or press 
Alt+WA and select one of the Arrange options in the Arrange 
Windows dialog box (as I describe next); then click OK or press 
Enter.
When you open the Arrange Windows dialog box, you’re presented with the 
following options:
 
✓ Tiled: Select this button to have Excel arrange and size the windows so 
that they all fit side by side on the screen. (Check out Figure 7-5 to see 
the screen that appears after you choose the Tiled button to organize 
four worksheet windows.)
 
✓ Horizontal: Select this button to have Excel size the windows equally 
and place them one above the other. (In Figure 7-6, you can see the 
screen that appears after you choose the Horizontal button to organize 
four worksheet windows.)
 
✓ Vertical: Select this button to have Excel size the windows equally and 
place them next to each other. (Look at Figure 7-7 to see the screen that 
appears after you choose the Vertical option to arrange four worksheet 
windows.)

✓ Cascade: Select this button to have Excel arrange and size the windows 
so that they overlap one another with only their title bars showing. 
(See Figure 7-8 for the screen that appears after you select the Cascade 
option to arrange four worksheet windows.)
 
✓ Windows of Active Workbook: Select this check box to have Excel 
show only the windows that you have open in the current workbook. 
Otherwise, Excel also displays all the windows in any other workbooks 
you have open. Yes, it is possible to open more than one workbook — as 
well as more than one window within each open workbook — provided 
your computer has enough memory and you have enough stamina to 
keep track of all that information.
 
After you place windows in one arrangement or another, activate the one 
you want to use (if it isn’t selected already) by clicking it. In the case of the 
cascade arrangement, you need to click the worksheet window’s title bar, or 
you can click its button on the Windows Vista or XP taskbar. Use the button’s 
ScreenTip to determine the number of the window when the buttons are too 
short to display this information. In Windows 7, you can click the Excel button 
in the taskbar, and then click the pop-up thumbnail for the worksheet you 
want.

When you click a worksheet window that has been tiled or placed in the hori-
zontal or vertical arrangement, Excel indicates that the window is selected by 
highlighting its title bar and adding scroll bars to the window. When you click 
the title bar of a worksheet window you place in the cascade arrangement, 
the program displays the window on the top of the stack, highlights its title 
bar, and adds scroll bars.
You can temporarily zoom the window to full size by clicking the Maximize 
button on the window’s title bar. When you finish your work in the full-size 
worksheet window, return it to its previous arrangement by clicking the win-
dow’s Restore button.
 
To select the next tiled, horizontal, or vertical window on the screen or dis-
play the next window in a cascade arrangement with the keyboard, press 
Ctrl+F6. To select the previous tiled, horizontal, or vertical window or to 
display the previous window in a cascade arrangement, press Ctrl+Shift+F6. 
These keystrokes work to select the next and previous worksheet window 
even when the windows are maximized in the Excel program window.

243
 Chapter 7: Maintaining Multiple Worksheets
If you close one of the windows by clicking Close (the X in the upper-right 
corner) or by pressing Ctrl+W, Excel doesn’t automatically resize the other 
open windows to fill in the gap. Likewise, if you create another window by 
clicking the New Window command button on the View tab, Excel doesn’t 
automatically arrange it in with the others. (In fact, the new window just sits 
on top of the other open windows.)
To fill in the gap created by closing a window or to integrate a newly opened 
window into the current arrangement, click the Arrange command button 
to open the Arrange Windows dialog box and click OK or press Enter. (The 
button you selected last time is still selected; if you want to choose a new 
arrangement, select a new button before you click OK.)
 
Don’t try to close a particular worksheet window by choosing File➪Close or 
by pressing Alt+FC because you’ll only succeed in closing the entire workbook 
file, getting rid of all the worksheet windows you created.
When you save your workbook, Excel saves the current window arrangement 
as part of the file along with all the rest of the changes. If you don’t want to 
save the current window arrangement, close all but one of the windows (by 
clicking their Close buttons or selecting their windows and then pressing 
Ctrl+W). Then click that last window’s Maximize button and select the tab of 
the worksheet that you want to display the next time you open the workbook 
before saving the file.
Comparing Two Worksheets Side by Side
You can use the View Side by Side command button (the one with the picture 
of two sheets side by side like tiny tablets of the Ten Commandments) on 
the Ribbon’s View tab to quickly and easily do a side-by-side comparison of 
any two worksheet windows that you have open. When you click this button 
(or press Alt+WB after opening two windows), Excel automatically tiles 
them horizontally (as though you had selected the Horizontal option in the 
Arrange Windows dialog box), as shown in Figure 7-9.
If you have more than two windows open at the time you click the View Side 
by Side command button (Alt+WB), Excel opens the Compare Side by Side 
dialog box where you click the name of the window that you want to compare 
with the one that’s active at the time you choose the command. As soon as 

244
Part III: Getting Organized and Staying That Way 
you click OK in the Compare Side by Side dialog box, Excel horizontally tiles 
the active window above the one you just selected.
 
Figure 7-9: 
Comparing 
two work-
sheet 
windows 
side by side.
 
Immediately below the View Side by Side command button in the Window 
group of the View tab on the Ribbon, you find these following two command 
buttons useful when comparing windows side by side:
 
✓ Synchronous Scrolling: When this command button is selected (as it 
is by default), any scrolling that you do in the worksheet in the active 
window is mirrored and synchronized in the worksheet in the inactive 
window beneath it. To be able to scroll the worksheet in the active 
window independently of the inactive window, click the Synchronous 
Scrolling button to deselect it.
 
✓ Reset Window Position: Click this command button after you manu-
ally resize the active window (by dragging its size box or an edge of 
the window) to restore the two windows to their previous side-by-side 
arrangement.

245
 Chapter 7: Maintaining Multiple Worksheets
Moving and Copying Sheets 
to Other Workbooks
In some situations, you need to move a particular worksheet or copy it from 
one workbook to another. To move or copy worksheets between workbooks, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Open both the workbook with the worksheet(s) that you want to move 
or copy and the workbook that is to contain the moved or copied 
worksheet(s).
 
 Choose File➪Open or press Ctrl+O to open both the workbooks.
 
2. Select the workbook that contains the worksheet(s) that you want to 
move or copy.
 
 To select the workbook with the sheet(s) to move or copy, click its 
button on the Windows taskbar.
 
3. Select the worksheet(s) that you want to move or copy.
 
 To select a single worksheet, click its sheet tab. To select a group of 
neighboring sheets, click the first tab and then hold down Shift while 
you click the last tab. To select various nonadjacent sheets, click the 
first tab and then hold down Ctrl while you click each of the other sheet 
tabs.
 
4. Right-click its sheet tab and then click Move or Copy on its shortcut 
menu.
 
 Excel opens up the Move or Copy dialog box (similar to the one shown 
in Figure 7-10) in which you indicate whether you want to move or copy 
the selected sheet(s) and where to move or copy them.
 
5. In the To Book drop-down list box, select the name of the workbook to 
which you want to copy or move the worksheets.
 
 If you want to move or copy the selected worksheet(s) to a new work-
book rather than to an existing one that you have open, select the (new 
book) option that appears at the very top of the To Book drop-down list.
 
6. In the Before Sheet list box, select the name of the sheet that the 
worksheet(s) you’re about to move or copy should precede. If you 
want the sheet(s) that you’re moving or copying to appear at the end 
of the workbook, choose the (Move to End) option.

246
Part III: Getting Organized and Staying That Way 
 
7. Select the Create a Copy check box to copy the selected worksheet(s) 
to the designated workbook (rather than move them).
 
8. Click OK or press Enter to complete the move or copy operation.
If you prefer a more direct approach, you can move or copy sheets between 
open workbooks by dragging the sheet tabs from one workbook window to 
another. This method works with several sheets or a single sheet; just be 
sure that you select all the sheet tabs before you begin the drag-and-drop 
procedure.
 
To drag a worksheet from one workbook to another, you must open both 
workbooks. Click the Arrange All command button on the View tab or press 
Alt+WA and then select an arrangement (such as Horizontal or Vertical to put 
the workbook windows either on top of each other or side by side). Before 
you close the Arrange Windows dialog box, be sure that the Windows of 
Active Workbook check box is not selected; that is, does not contain a check 
mark.

247
 Chapter 7: Maintaining Multiple Worksheets
After arranging the workbook windows, drag the worksheet tab from one 
workbook to another. If you want to copy rather than move the worksheet, 
hold down the Ctrl key while you drag the sheet icon(s). To locate the work-
sheet in the new workbook, position the downward-pointing triangle that 
moves with the sheet icon in front of the worksheet tab where you want to 
insert it; then release the mouse button.
 
This drag-and-drop operation is one of those that you can’t reverse by using 
Excel’s Undo feature (see Chapter 4). This means that if you drop the sheet 
in the wrong workbook, you’ll have to go get the wayward sheet yourself and 
then drag and drop it into the place where it once belonged!
In Figures 7-11 and 7-12, I show how easy it is to move or copy a worksheet 
from one workbook to another using this drag-and-drop method.
In Figure 7-11, you see two workbook windows: the MGE 2010 Q1 Sales 
workbook (left pane) and the MGE – 2011 Projected Income workbook (right 
pane). I arranged these workbook windows with the View Side by Side com-
mand button on the View tab. To move the Sprat Diet Ctr sheet from the 
MGE – 2011 Projected Income workbook to the MGE 2010 Q1 Sales workbook, 
I simply select the Sprat Diet Ctr sheet tab and drag the sheet icon to its new 
position before Sheet2 of the MGE 2010 Q1 Sales workbook.

Now look at Figure 7-12 to see the workbooks after I release the mouse button. 
As you can see, Excel inserts the copy of the Sprat Diet Ctr worksheet into the 
MGE 2010 Q1 Sales workbook at the place indicated by the triangle that accom-
panies the sheet icon (between Sheet1 and Sheet2 in this example).

To Sum Up . . .
I’d be remiss if I didn’t introduce you to the fascinating subject of creating 
a summary worksheet that recaps or totals the values stored in a bunch of 
other worksheets in the workbook.
The best way that I can show you how to create a summary worksheet is 
to walk you through the procedure of making one (entitled Total Projected 
Income) for the MGE – 2011 Projected Income workbook. This summary 
worksheet totals the projected revenue and expenses for all the companies 
that Mother Goose Enterprises owns.
Because the MGE – 2011 Projected Income workbook already contains nine 
worksheets, each with the 2011 projected revenue and expenses for one of 

249
 Chapter 7: Maintaining Multiple Worksheets
these companies, and because these worksheets are all laid out in the same 
arrangement, creating this summary worksheet will be a breeze:
 
1. I insert a new worksheet in front of the other worksheets in the MGE – 
2011 Projected Income workbook and rename its sheet tab from Sheet1 
to Total Income.
 
 To find out how to insert a new worksheet, refer to this chapter’s “Don’t 
Short-Sheet Me!” section. To find out how to rename a sheet tab, read 
the earlier “A worksheet by any other name . . .” section.
 
2. Next, I enter the worksheet title Mother Goose Enterprises – Total 
Projected Income 2011 in cell A1.
 
 Do this by selecting cell A1 and then typing the text.
 
3. Finally, I copy the rest of the row headings for column A (containing the 
revenue and expense descriptions) from the Sprat Diet Ctr worksheet to 
the Total Income worksheet.
 
 To do this, select cell A3 in the Total Income sheet and then click the 
Sprat Diet Ctr tab. Select the cell range A3:A22 in this sheet; then press 
Ctrl+C, click the Total Income tab again, and press Enter.
I am now ready to create the master SUM formula that totals the revenues of 
all nine companies in cell B3 of the Total Income sheet:
 
1. I start by clicking cell B3 and then clicking the AutoSum button in the 
Editing group on the Ribbon’s Home tab.
 
 Excel then puts =SUM( ) in the cell with the insertion point placed 
between the two parentheses.
 
2. I click the Sprat Diet Ctr sheet tab, and then click its cell B3 to select the 
projected revenues for the Jack Sprat Diet Centers.
 
 The Formula bar reads =SUM(‘Sprat Diet Ctr’!B3) after selecting 
this cell.
 
3. Next, I type a comma (,) — the comma starts a new argument. I click the 
J&J Trauma Ctr sheet tab and then click its cell B3 to select projected 
revenues for the Jack and Jill Trauma Centers.
 
 The Formula bar now reads =SUM(‘Sprat Diet Ctr’!B3,‘J&J 
Trauma Ctr’!B3) after I select this cell.
 
4. I continue in this manner, typing a comma (to start a new argument) and 
then selecting cell B3 with the projected revenues for all the other com-
panies in the following seven sheets.
 
 At the end of this procedure, the Formula bar now appears with the 
whopping SUM formula shown on the Formula bar in Figure 7-13.

250
Part III: Getting Organized and Staying That Way 
 
5. To complete the SUM formula in cell B3 of the Total Income worksheet, 
I then click the Enter box in the Formula bar (I could press Enter on my 
keyboard, as well).
 
 In Figure 7-13, note the result in cell B3. As you can see in the Formula 
bar, the master SUM formula that returns 6,681,450.78 to cell B3 of the 
Total Income worksheet gets its result by summing the values in B3 in all 
nine of the supporting worksheets.
 
If you want to select the same cell across multiple worksheets, you can press 
and hold the Shift key, and then select the last worksheet. All worksheets in 
between the first and last will be included in the selection, or in the case 
above, the calculation.
All that’s left to do now is to use AutoFill to copy the master formula in cell 
B3 down to row 22 as follows:
 
1. With cell B3 still selected, I drag the AutoFill handle in the lower-right 
corner of cell B3 down to cell B22 to copy the formula for summing the 
values for the nine companies down this column.
 
2. Then I delete the SUM formulas from cells B4, B12, B14, B15, and B19 (all 
of which contain zeros because these cells have no income or expenses 
to total).

las from the cells that should be blank (all those that came up 0 in column B).

In this part . . .
I
n this part, you find out how to use basic what-if analy-
sis tools in your spreadsheets so that you can better 
predict the changes you must make to achieve desired 
goals and avoid unwanted results. You’re introduced to 
Excel’s most versatile summary tool — the pivot table and 
its associated pivot chart. You find out how to use these 
extraordinary tools to obtain varied perspectives on the 
data you work with — perspectives that can enable you to 
quickly uncover and easily spot trends with both poten-
tially disastrous consequences and golden opportunities.

Chapter 8
Doing What-If Analysis
In This Chapter
▶ Performing what-if analysis with one- and two-variable data tables
▶ Performing what-if analysis with goal seeking
▶ Looking at different cases with the Scenario Manager
I
t would be a big mistake to regard Excel 2010 merely as a fancy calculator 
that shines at performing static computations, for the program excels (if 
you don’t mind the pun) at performing various types of more dynamic what-if 
analysis as well. What-if analysis enables you to explore the possibilities in 
a worksheet by inputting a variety of promising or probable values into the 
same equation and letting you see the possible outcomes in black and white 
(or, at least, in the cells of the spreadsheet).
In Excel 2010, what-if analysis comes in a wide variety of flavors (some of 
which are more involved than others). In this chapter, I introduce you to 
these three simple and straightforward methods:
 
✓ Data tables enable you to see how changing one or two variables affect 
the bottom line (for example, you may want to know what happens to 
the net profit if you fall into a 25 percent tax bracket, a 35 percent tax 
bracket, and so on). 
 
✓ Goal seeking enables you to find out what it takes to reach a predeter-
mined objective, such as how much you have to sell to make a $15 mil-
lion profit this year. 
 
✓ Scenarios let you set up and test a wide variety of cases, all the way 
from the best-case scenario (profits grow by 8.5 percent) to the worst-
case scenario (you don’t make any profit and actually lose money).
Playing What-If with Data Tables
Data tables enable you to enter a series of possible values that Excel then 
plugs into a single formula. Excel supports two types of data tables: a one-

256
Part IV: Digging Data Analysis 
variable data table that substitutes a series of possible values for a single 
input value in a formula and a two-variable data table that substitutes series 
of possible values for two input values in a single formula.
Both types of data tables use the very same Data Table dialog box that you 
open by clicking Data➪What-If Analysis➪Data Table on the Ribbon or press-
ing Alt+AWT. The Data Table dialog box contains two text boxes: Row Input 
Cell and Column Input Cell.
When creating a one-variable data table, you designate one cell in the work-
sheet that serves either as the Row Input Cell (if you’ve entered the series 
of possible values across columns of a single row) or as the Column Input 
Cell (if you’ve entered the series of possible values down the rows of a single 
column).
When creating a two-variable data table, you designate two cells in the work-
sheet and, therefore, use both text boxes. One cell serves as the Row Input 
Cell that substitutes the series of possible values you’ve entered across col-
umns of a single row, and the other cell serves as the Column Input Cell that 
substitutes the series of possible values you’ve entered down the rows of a 
single column.
Creating a one-variable data table
Figure 8-1 shows a 2011 Sales Projections spreadsheet for which a one-
variable data table is to be created. In this worksheet, the projected sales 
amount in cell B5 is calculated by adding last year’s sales total in cell B2 to 
the amount that we expect it to grow in 2011 (calculated by multiplying last 
year’s total in cell B2 by the growth percentage in cell B3), giving you the 
formula:
=B2+(B2*B3)
Because I clicked the Create From Selection command button on the Ribbon’s 
Formulas tab after making A2:B5 the selection and accepted the Left Column 
check box default, the formula uses the row headings in column A and reads:
=Sales_2010+(Sales_2010*Growth_2011)
As you can see, I entered a column of possible growth rates ranging from 1% 
all the way to 5.5% down column B in the range B8:B17. To create the one-
variable data table shown in Figure 8-2 that plugs each of these values into 
the sales growth formula, I follow these simple steps:

257
 Chapter 8: Doing What-If Analysis
 
1. Copy the original formula entered in cell B5 into cell C7 by 
typing = (equal to) and then clicking cell B5 to create the formula 
=Projected_Sales_2011.
 
 The copy of the original formula (to substitute the series of different 
growth rates in B8:B17 into) is now the column heading for the one-vari-
able data table.
 
2. Select the cell range B7:C17.
 
 The range of the data table includes the formula along with the various 
growth rates.

258
Part IV: Digging Data Analysis 
 
3. Click Data➪What-If Analysis➪Data Table on the Ribbon.
 
 Excel opens the Data Table dialog box.
 
4. Click the Column Input Cell text box in the Data Table dialog box and 
then click cell B3, the Growth_2011 cell with the original percentage, 
in the worksheet.
 
 Excel inserts the absolute cell address, $B$3, into the Column Input Cell 
text box.
 
5. Click OK to close the Data Table dialog box.
 
 As soon as you click OK, Excel creates the data table in the range C8:C17 
by entering a formula using its TABLE function into this range. Each 
copy of this formula in the data table uses the growth rate percentage in 
the same row in column B to determine the possible outcome.
 
6. Click cell C7, then click the Format Painter command button in the 
Clipboard group on the Home tab and drag through the cell range 
C8:C17.
 
 Excel copies the Accounting number format to the range of possible out-
comes calculated by this data table.
 
A couple of important things to note about the one-variable data table created 
in this spreadsheet:
 
✓ If you modify any growth rate percentages in the cell range B8:B17, Excel 
immediately updates the associated projected sales result in the data 
table. To prevent Excel from updating the data table until you click the 
Calculate Now (F9) or Calculate Sheet command button (Shift+F9) on the 
Formulas Tab, click the Calculation Options button on the Formulas tab 
and then click the Automatic Except for Data Tables option (Alt+MXE).
 
✓ If you try to delete any single TABLE formula in the cell range C8:C17, 
Excel displays a Cannot Change Part of a Data Table alert. You must 
select the entire range of formulas (C8:C17 in this case) before you press 
Delete or click the Clear or Delete button on the Home tab.
Array formulas and the TABLE function in data tables
Excel’s Data Table feature works by creating a 
special kind of formula called an array formula 
in the blank cells of the table. An array formula 
(enclosed in a pair of curly brackets) is unique 
in that Excel creates copies of the formula into 
each blank cell of the selection at the time you 
enter the original formula. (You don’t make 
the formula copies yourself.) As a result, edit-
ing changes, such as moving or deleting, are 
restricted to the entire cell range containing the 
array formula — it’s always all or nothing when 
editing these babies!

259
 Chapter 8: Doing What-If Analysis
Creating a two-variable data table
To create a two-variable data table, you enter two ranges of possible input 
values for the same formula in the Data Table dialog box: a range of values 
for the Row Input Cell across the first row of the table and a range of values 
for the Column Input Cell down the first column of the table. You then enter 
the formula (or a copy of it) in the cell located at the intersection of this row 
and column of input values.
Figure 8-3 illustrates this type of situation. This version of the projected sales 
spreadsheet uses two variables to calculate the projected sales for year 2011: 
a growth rate as a percentage of increase over last year’s sales (in cell B3 
named Growth_2011) and expenses calculated as a percentage of last year’s 
sales (in cell B4 named Expenses_2011). In this example, the original formula 
created in cell B5 is a bit more complex:
=Sales_2010+(Sales_2010*Growth_2011) - 
(Sales_2010*Expenses_2011)
To set up the two-variable data table, I added a row of possible 
Expenses_2011 percentages in the range C7:F7 to a column of possible 
Growth_2011 percentages in the range B8:B17. I then copied the original 
formula named Projected_Sales_2011 from cell B5 to cell B7, the cell at 
the intersection of this row of Expenses_2011 percentages and column of 
Growth_2011 percentages with the formula:
=Projected_Sales_2011

260
Part IV: Digging Data Analysis 
With these few steps, I created the two-variable data table you see in 
Figure 8-4:
 
1. Select the cell range B7:F17.
 
 This cell incorporates the copy of the original formula along with the 
row of possible expenses and growth rate percentages.
 
2. Click Data➪What-If Analysis➪Data Table on the Ribbon.
 
 Excel opens the Data Table dialog box with the insertion point in the 
Row Input Cell text box.
 
3. Click cell B4 to enter the absolute cell address, $B$4, in the Row Input 
Cell text box.
 
4. Click the Column Input Cell text box and then click cell B3 to enter 
the absolute cell address, $B$3, in this text box.
 
5. Click OK to close the Data Table dialog box.
 
 Excel fills the blank cells of the data table with a TABLE formula using B4 
as the Row Input Cell and B3 as the Column Input Cell.
 
6. Click cell B7, then click the Format Painter command button in the 
Clipboard group on the Home tab and drag through the cell range 
C8:F17 to copy the Accounting number format with no decimal places 
to this range.
 
 This Accounting number format is too long to display given the current 
width of columns C through F — indicated by the ###### symbols. With 
the range C8:F17 still selected from using the Format Painter, Step 7 fixes 
this problem.

261
 Chapter 8: Doing What-If Analysis
 
7. Click the Format command button in the Cells group of the Home tab 
and then click AutoFit Column Width on its drop-down menu.
 
The array formula {=TABLE(B4,B3)} that Excel creates for the two-variable 
data table in this example specifies both a Row Input Cell argument (B4) and 
a Column Input Cell argument (B3). (See the nearby “Array formulas and the 
TABLE function in data tables” sidebar.) Because this single array formula 
is entered into the entire data table range of C8:F17, any editing (in terms of 
moving or deleting) is restricted to this range.
Playing What-If with Goal Seeking
Sometimes when doing what-if analysis, you have a particular outcome in 
mind, such as a target sales amount or growth percentage. When you need 
to do this type of analysis, you use Excel’s Goal Seek feature to find the input 
values needed to achieve the desired goal.
To use the Goal Seek feature located on the What-If Analysis button’s drop-
down menu, you need to select the cell containing the formula that will 
return the result you’re seeking (referred to as the set cell in the Goal Seek 
dialog box). Then indicate the target value you want the formula to return 
as well as the location of the input value that Excel can change to reach this 
target.
Figures 8-5 and 8-6 illustrate how you can use the Goal Seek feature to find 
out how much sales must increase to realize first quarter income of $300,000 
(given certain growth, cost of goods sold, and expense assumptions) in a 
Sales Forecast table.
 
Figure 8-5:

262
Part IV: Digging Data Analysis 
 
Figure 8-6: 
Forecast 
spreadsheet 
showing 
goal seeking 
solution.
 
To find out how much sales must increase to return a net income of $300,000 
in the first quarter, select cell C7, which contains the formula that calcu-
lates the forecast for the first quarter of 2011 before you click Data➪What-If 
Analysis➪Goal Seek on the Ribbon or press Alt+AWG.
This action opens the Goal Seek dialog box, similar to the one shown in 
Figure 8-5. Because cell C7 is the active cell when you open this dialog box, 
the Set Cell text box already contains the cell reference C7. You then select 
the To Value text box and enter 300000 as the goal. Then, you click the By 
Changing Cell text box and click cell C3 in the worksheet (the cell that con-
tains the first quarter sales) to enter the absolute cell address, $C$3, in this 
text box.
Figure 8-6 shows you the Goal Seek Status dialog box that appears when 
you click OK in the Goal Seek dialog box to have Excel go ahead and adjust 
the sales figure to reach your desired income figure. As this figure shows, 
Excel increases the sales in cell B3 from $250,000 to $545,455, which, in turn, 
returns $300,000 as the income in cell C7.
 
The Goal Seek Status dialog box informs you that goal seeking has found a 
solution and that the current value and target value are now the same. When 
this is not the case, the Step and Pause buttons in the dialog box become 
active, and you can have Excel perform further iterations to try to narrow and 
ultimately eliminate the gap between the target and current value.
If you want to keep the values entered in the worksheet as a result of goal 
seeking, click OK to close the Goal Seek Status dialog box. If you want to 
return to the original values, click the Cancel button instead. 
 
To flip between the “after” and “before” values when you’ve closed the Goal 
Seek Status dialog box, click the Undo button or press Ctrl+Z to display the 
original values before goal seeking and click the Redo button or press Ctrl+Y 
to display the values engendered by the goal seeking solution.

263
 Chapter 8: Doing What-If Analysis
Examining Different Cases 
with Scenario Manager
Excel’s Scenario Manager option on the What-If Analysis button’s drop-down 
menu on the Data tab of the Ribbon enables you to create and save sets of 
different input values that produce different calculated results, named sce-
narios (such as Best Case, Worst Case, and Most Likely Case). Because these 
scenarios are saved as part of the workbook, you can use their values to play 
what-if simply by opening the Scenario Manager and having Excel show the 
scenario in the worksheet.
After setting up the various scenarios for a spreadsheet, you can also have 
Excel create a summary report that shows both the input values used in each 
scenario as well as the results they produce in your formula.
Setting up the various scenarios
The key to creating the various scenarios for a table is to identify the vari-
ous cells in the data whose values can vary in each scenario. You then select 
these cells (known as changing cells) in the worksheet before you open the 
Scenario Manager dialog box by clicking Data➪What-If Analysis➪Scenario 
Manager on the Ribbon or by pressing Alt+AWS.
Figure 8-7 shows the Sales Forecast table for 2011 after selecting the three 
changing cells in the worksheet — H3 named Sales_Growth, H4 named COGS 
(Cost of Goods Sold), and H6 named Expenses — and then opening the 
Scenario Manager dialog box (Alt+AWS).
I want to create three scenarios using the following sets of values for the 
three changing cells:
 
✓ Most Likely Case where the Sales_Growth percentage is 5%, COGS is 
20%, and Expenses is 25%
 
✓ Best Case where the Sales_Growth percentage is 8%, COGS is 18%, and 
Expenses is 20%
 
✓ Worst Case where the Sales_Growth percentage is 2%, COGS is 25%, and 
Expenses is 35%
To create the first scenario, I click the Add button in the Scenario Manager 
dialog box to open the Add Scenario dialog box, enter Most Likely Case in 
the Scenario Name box, and then click OK. (Remember that the three cells 

264
Part IV: Digging Data Analysis 
currently selected in the worksheet, H3, H4, and H6, are already listed in the 
Changing Cells text box of this dialog box.)
 
Figure 8-7: 
Adding 
various 
scenarios 
to the Sales 
Forecast for 
2011 table.
 
Excel then displays the Scenario Values dialog box where I accept the fol-
lowing values already entered in each of the three text boxes (from the Sales 
Forecast for 2011 table), Sales_Growth, COGS, and Expenses, before clicking 
its Add button:
 
✓ 0.05 in the Sales_Growth text box
 
✓ 0.20 in COGS text box
 
✓ 0.25 in the Expenses text box
 
Always assign range names as described in Chapter 6 to your changing cells 
before you begin creating the various scenarios that use them. That way, 
Excel always displays the cell’s range names rather than their addresses in the 
Scenario Values dialog box.
After clicking the Add button, Excel redisplays the Add Scenario dialog box 
where I enter Best Case in the Scenario Name box and the following values in 
the Scenario Values dialog box:
 
✓ 0.08 in the Sales_Growth text box
 
✓ 0.18 in the COGS text box
 
✓ 0.20 in the Expenses text box

265
 Chapter 8: Doing What-If Analysis
After making these changes, I click the Add button again. Doing this opens 
the Add Scenario dialog box where I enter Worst Case as the scenario name 
and the following scenario values:
 
✓ 0.02 in the Sales_Growth text box
 
✓ 0.25 in the COGS text box
 
✓ 0.35 in the Expenses text box
Because this is the last scenario that I want to add, I then click the OK button 
instead of Add. Doing this opens the Scenario Manager dialog box again, this 
time displaying the names of all three scenarios, Most Likely Case, Best Case, 
and Worst Case in its Scenarios list box. To have Excel plug the changing 
values assigned to any of these three scenarios into the Sales Forecast table, I 
click the scenario name in this list box followed by the Show button.
 
After adding the various scenarios for a table in your spreadsheet, don’t forget 
to save the workbook after closing the Scenario Manager dialog box. That way, 
you’ll have access to the various scenarios each time you open the workbook 
in Excel simply by opening the Scenario Manager, selecting the scenario name, 
and clicking the Show button.
Producing a summary report
After adding your scenarios to a table in a spreadsheet, you can have Excel 
produce a summary report like the one shown in Figure 8-8. This report dis-
plays the changing and resulting values for not only all the scenarios you’ve 
defined but also the current values that are entered into the changing cells in 
the worksheet table at the time you generate the report.

showing 
the various

266
Part IV: Digging Data Analysis 
To produce a summary report, open the Scenario Manager dialog box 
(Data➪What-If Analysis➪Scenario Manager or Alt+AWS) and then click the 
Summary button to open the Scenario Summary dialog box.
This dialog box gives you a choice between creating a (static) Scenario 
Summary (the default) and a (dynamic) Scenario PivotTable Report (see 
Chapter 9). You can also modify the range of cells in the table that is included 
in the Result Cells section of the summary report by adjusting the cell range 
in the Result Cells text box before you click OK to generate the report.
After you click OK, Excel creates the summary report for the changing values 
in all the scenarios (and the current worksheet) along with the calculated 
values in the Result Cells on a new worksheet (named Scenario Summary). 
You can then rename and reposition the Scenario Summary worksheet before 
you save it as part of the workbook file.
Performing what-if analysis with the Solver add-in
In addition to the straightforward what-if analy-
sis offered by the Scenario Manager, Goal Seek, 
and Data Table options on the What-If Analysis 
button’s drop-down menu on the Data tab of 
the Ribbon, Excel 2010 supports a more com-
plex what-if analysis in the form of the Solver 
add-in program (see Chapter 12 for information 
on add-ins). With the Solver, you can create 
models that not only involve changes to multi-
ple input values but also impose constraints on 
these inputs or on the results themselves. For 
details on using the Solver in Excel 2010, see 
my Microsoft Office Excel 2010 All-in-One For 
Dummies.

P
ivot table is a name given to a special type of summary table that’s 
unique to Microsoft Excel. Pivot tables are great for summarizing par-
ticular values in a data list or database because they do their magic without 
making you create formulas to perform the calculations. They also enable 
you to quickly and easily examine and analyze relationships inherent in their 
data sources (either data lists you maintain in Excel or external database 
tables you maintain with a standalone program, such as Microsoft Office 
Access).
Pivot tables also let you play around with the arrangement of the summa-
rized data — even after you generate the table. This capability of changing 
the arrangement of the summarized data on the fly simply by rotating row 
and column headings gives the pivot table its name. And, if you’re the type 
who relates better to data represented in pictorial form, Excel enables you to 
summarize your data list graphically as a pivot chart using any of the many, 
many chart types now supported by the program.
Pivot Tables: The Ultimate Data Summary
Pivot tables are so very versatile because they enable you to summarize data 
by using a variety of summary functions (although totals created with the 
SUM function will probably remain your old standby). When setting up the 
original pivot table (as described in the following section) you make several 

268
Part IV: Digging Data Analysis 
decisions: what summary function to use, which columns (fields) the sum-
mary function is applied to, and which columns (fields) these computations 
are tabulated with.
 
Pivot tables are perfect for cross-tabulating one set of data in your data list 
with another. For example, you can create a pivot table from an employee 
database table that totals the salaries for each job category cross-tabulated 
(arranged) by department or job site.
Producing a Pivot Table
Creating a pivot table has never been as easy as it is in Excel 2010. You 
simply open the worksheet that contains the data list (see Chapter 11) you 
want to summarize with the pivot table, position the cell cursor somewhere 
in the cells of this list, and then click the PivotTable command button on the 
Ribbon’s Insert tab or press Alt+NVT.
Excel then opens the Create PivotTable dialog box and selects all the data 
in the list containing the cell cursor (indicated by a marquee around the cell 
range). You can then adjust the cell range in the Table/Range text box under 
the Select a Table or Range button if the marquee does not include all the 
data to summarize in the pivot table. By default, Excel builds the new pivot 
table on a new worksheet it adds to the workbook. If, however, you want the 
pivot table to appear on the same worksheet, click the Existing Worksheet 
button and then indicate the location of the first cell of the new table in the 
Location text box, as shown in Figure 9-1. (Just be sure that this new pivot 
table isn’t going to overlap any existing tables of data).
 
If the data source for your pivot table is an external database table created 
with a separate database management program, such as Access, you need to 
click the Use an External Data Source button, click the Choose Connection 
button, and then click the name of the connection in the Existing Connections 
dialog box. (See Chapter 11 for information on establishing a connection with 
an external file and importing its data through a query.)
After you indicate the source and location for the new pivot table in the 
Create PivotTable dialog box and click its OK button, the program adds a 
blank grid for the new table and displays a PivotTable Field List task pane 
on the right side of the Worksheet area (see Figure 9-2). The PivotTable 
Field List task pane is divided into two areas: the Choose Fields to Add to 
Report list box with the names of all the fields in the data list you can select 
as the source of the table preceded by empty check boxes and a Drag Fields 
between Areas Below section divided into four drop zones (Report Filter, 
Column Labels, Row Labels, and Values).

To complete the new pivot table, all you have to do is assign the fields in the 
PivotTable Field List task pane to the various parts of the table. You do this 
by dragging a field name from the Choose Fields to Add to Report list box and 
dropping it in one of the four areas below called drop zones:
 
✓ Report Filter: This area contains the fields that enable you to page 
through the data summaries shown in the actual pivot table by filtering 
out sets of data — they act as the filters for the report. For example, if 
you designate the Year field from a data list as a report filter, you can 
display data summaries in the pivot table for individual years or for all 
years represented in the data list.

270
Part IV: Digging Data Analysis 
 
✓ Column Labels: This area contains the fields that determine the arrange-
ment of data shown in the columns of the pivot table.
 
✓ Row Labels: This area contains the fields that determine the arrange-
ment of data shown in the rows of the pivot table.
 
✓ Values: This area contains the fields that determine which data are pre-
sented in the cells of the pivot table — they are the values that are sum-
marized in its last column (totaled by default).
To understand how these various zones relate to a pivot table, look at the 
completed pivot table in Figure 9-3.
 
Figure 9-3: 
Completed 
pivot table 
after adding 
the fields 
from the 
employee 
data list to 
the various 
drop zones.
 
For this pivot table, I assigned the Gender field from the data list (a field that 
contains F (for female) or M (for male) to indicate the employee’s gender in 
the Report Filter drop zone. I also assigned the Dept field (that contains the 
names of the various departments in the company) to the Column Labels 
drop zone, the Location field (that contains the names of the various cities 
with corporate offices) to the Row Labels drop zone, and the Salary field 
to the Values drop zone. As a result, this pivot table now displays the sum 
of the salaries for both the male and female employees in each department 
(across the columns) and then presents these sums by their corporate loca-
tion (in each row).
As soon as you create a new pivot table (or select the cell of an existing table 
in a worksheet), Excel selects the Options tab of the PivotTable Tools contex-
tual tab that automatically appears in the Ribbon. Among the many groups 

271
 Chapter 9: Playing with Pivot Tables
on this tab, you find the Show group that contains the following useful com-
mand buttons:
 
✓ Field List to hide and redisplay the PivotTable Field List task pane on 
the right side of the Worksheet area
 
✓ +/- Buttons to hide and redisplay the expand (+) and collapse (-) buttons 
in front of particular column fields or row fields that enable you to tem-
porarily remove and then redisplay their particular summarized values 
in the pivot table
 
✓ Field Headers to hide and redisplay the fields assigned to the Column 
Labels and Row Labels in the pivot table
Formatting a Pivot Table
Excel 2010 makes formatting a new pivot table you’ve added to a worksheet 
as quick and easy as formatting any other table of data or list of data. All you 
need to do is click a cell of the pivot table to add the PivotTable Tools con-
textual tab to the Ribbon and then click its Design tab to display its command 
buttons.
The Design tab on the PivotTable Tools contextual tab is divided into three 
groups:
 
✓ Layout group that enables you to add subtotals and grand totals to the 
pivot table and modify its basic layout
 
✓ PivotTable Style Options group that enables you to refine the pivot 
table style you select for the table using the PivotTable Styles gallery to 
the immediate right
 
✓ PivotTable Styles group that contains the gallery of styles you can apply 
to the active pivot table by clicking the desired style thumbnail
Figure 9-4 shows the pivot table created for the Employee Data List in Figure 
9-3 after applying Pivot Style Medium 10 in the PivotTable Styles gallery to 
it. This style applies a light version of the background color (rose) to the 
Gender Report Filter field and a darker version to the Values Label (Sum of 
Salary), Dept Column Labels, and Location Row Labels (so dark in fact, that 
Excel automatically reverses the label text to white).

Refining the Pivot Table style
After applying any style from the Light, Medium, or Dark group in the 
PivotTable Styles gallery, you can then use Live Preview to see how the pivot 
table would look in any style that you mouse over in the gallery.
After selecting a style from the gallery in the PivotTable Styles group on 
the Design tab, you can then refine the style using the check box command 
buttons in the PivotTable Style Options group. For example, you can add 
banding to the columns or rows of a style that doesn’t already use alternate 
shading to add more contrast to the table data by putting a check mark in the 
Banded Rows or Banded Columns check box or remove this banding by clear-
ing these check boxes of their check marks.
Formatting the values in the pivot table
To format the summed values entered as the data items of the pivot table 
with an Excel number format, you follow these steps:
 
1. Click the field in the table that contains the words “Sum of” and the 
name of the field whose values are summarized there, click the Active 
Field command button on the Options tab under the PivotTable Tools 
contextual tab, and then click the Fields Settings option on its pop-up 
menu.
 
 Excel opens the Value Field Settings dialog box.
 
2. Click the Number Format button in the Value Field Settings dialog box 
to open the Number tab of the Format Cells dialog box.

273
 Chapter 9: Playing with Pivot Tables
 
3. Click the type of number format you want to assign to the values in 
the pivot table on the Category list box of the Number tab.
 
4. (Optional) Modify any other options for the selected number format, 
such as Decimal Places, Symbol, and Negative Numbers that are avail-
able for that format.
 
5. Click OK twice, the first time to close the Format Cells dialog box and 
the second to close the Value Field Settings dialog box.
Sorting and Filtering the 
Pivot Table Data
When you create a new pivot table, you’ll notice that Excel automatically 
adds drop-down buttons to the Report Filter field as well as the labels for the 
column and row fields. These drop-down buttons, known officially as filter 
buttons (see Chapter 11 for details), enable you to filter all but certain entries 
in any of these fields, and in the case of the column and row fields, to sort 
their entries in the table.
If you’ve added more than one column or row field to your pivot table, Excel 
adds collapse buttons (-) that you can use to temporarily hide subtotal 
values for a particular secondary field. After clicking a collapse button in 
the table, it immediately becomes an expand button (+) that you can click to 
redisplay the subtotals for that one secondary field.
Filtering the report
Perhaps the most important filter buttons in a pivot table are the ones added 
to the Report Filter field(s). By selecting a particular option on the drop-
down lists attached to one of these filter buttons, only the summary data for 
that subset you select displays in the pivot table.
For example, in the example pivot table (refer to Figure 9-4) that uses the 
Gender field from the Employee Data list as the Report Filter field, you can 
display the sum of just the men’s or women’s salaries by department and 
location in the body of the pivot table doing either of the following:
 
✓ Click the Gender field’s filter button and then click M on the drop-down 
list before you click OK to see only the totals of the men’s salaries by 
department. 
 
✓ Click the Gender field’s filter button and then click F on the drop-down 
list before you click OK to see only the totals of the women’s salaries by 
department.

274
Part IV: Digging Data Analysis 
When you later want to redisplay the summary of the salaries for all the 
employees, you then re-select the (All) option on the Gender field’s drop-
down filter list before you click OK.
 
When you filter the Gender Report Filter field in this manner, Excel then dis-
plays M or F in the Gender Report Filter field instead of the default (All). The 
program also replaces the standard drop-down button with a cone-shaped 
filter icon, indicating that the field is filtered and showing only some of the 
values in the data source.
Filtering individual column and row fields
The filter buttons on the column and row fields attached to their labels 
enable you to filter out entries for particular groups and, in some cases, indi-
vidual entries in the data source. To filter the summary data in the columns 
or rows of a pivot table, click the column or row field’s filter button and start 
by clicking the check box for the (Select All) option at the top of the drop-
down list to clear this box of its check mark. Then, click the check boxes 
for all the groups or individual entries whose summed values you still want 
displayed in the pivot table to put back check marks in each of their check 
boxes. Then click OK. 
As with filtering a Report Filter field, Excel replaces the standard drop-down 
button for that column or row field with a cone-shaped filter icon, indicating 
that the field is filtered and displaying only some of its summary values in the 
pivot table. To redisplay all the values for a filtered column or row field, you 
need to click its filter button and then click (Select All) at the top of its drop-
down list. Then click OK.
Figure 9-5 shows the sample pivot table after filtering its Gender Report Filter 
field to women and its Dept Column field to Accounting, Administration, and 
Human Resources.
 
Notice in Figure 9-5 that after filtering the pivot table by selecting F in the 
Gender Report Filter field and selecting Accounting, Administration, and 
Human Resources departments as the only column fields, the filtered pivot 
table no longer displays salary summaries for all the company’s locations 
(Santa Rosa, Seattle, and Atlanta locations are missing). You can tell that the 
table is missing these locations because there are no women employees in 
the three selected departments. That isn’t a result of filtering the row field 
because the Location drop-down button still uses the standard icon and not 
the cone-shaped filter icon now shown on the right of the Gender Report Filter 
and Dept column fields.

Filtering with slicers
Slicers are a brand new graphic object in Excel 2010 that you can use to filter 
your pivot tables. Slicers are easy to create and to use, and they make it a 
snap to filter the contents of your pivot table on more than one field. (They 
even allow you to connect with fields of other pivot tables that you’ve cre-
ated in the workbook.)
To add slicers to your pivot table, you follow just two steps:
 
1. Click one of the cells in your pivot table to select it and then click the 
Insert Slicer option on the Insert Slicer button located in the Sort & 
Filter group of the PivotTable Options contextual tab.
 
 Excel opens the Insert Slicers dialog box with a list of all the fields in the 
active pivot table.
 
2. Select the check boxes for all the fields that you want to use in filter-
ing the pivot table and for which you want slicers created and then 
click OK.
 
 Excel then adds slicers (as graphic objects — see Chapter 10 for details) 
for each pivot table field you select.
After you create slicers for the pivot table, you can use them to filter its data 
simply by selecting the items you want displayed in each slicer. You select 
items in a slicer by clicking them just as you do cells in a worksheet — hold 
down Ctrl as you click nonconsecutive items and Shift to select a series of 
sequential items.

276
Part IV: Digging Data Analysis 
Figure 9-6 shows you the sample pivot table after using slicers created for 
the Gender, Dept, and Location fields to filter the data so that only salaries 
for the men in the Human Resources and Administration departments in the 
Boston, Chicago, and San Francisco offices display.
 
Figure 9-6:

Dept, and 
Location 
fields.
 
 
Because slicers are Excel graphic objects (albeit some pretty fancy ones), you 
can move, resize, and delete them just as you would any other Excel graphic; 
see Chapter 10 for details.
Sorting the pivot table
You can instantly reorder the summary values in a pivot table by sorting the 
table on one or more of its column or row fields. To re-sort a pivot table, click 
the filter button for the column or row field you want to use in the sorting 
and then click the Sort A to Z option or the Sort Z to A option at the top of the 
field’s drop-down list.
Click the Sort A to Z option when you want the table reordered by sorting the 
labels in the selected field alphabetically or, in the case of values, from the 
smallest to largest value or, in the case of dates, from the oldest to newest 
date. Click the Sort Z to A option when you want the table reordered by sort-
ing the labels in reverse alphabetical order, values from the highest to small-
est, and dates from the newest to oldest.

277
 Chapter 9: Playing with Pivot Tables
Modifying a Pivot Table
Pivot tables are much more dynamic than standard Excel data tables because 
they remain so easy to manipulate and modify. Excel makes it just as easy to 
change which fields from the original data source display in the table as it 
did adding them when the table was created. Additionally, you can instantly 
restructure the pivot table by dragging its existing fields to new positions 
on the table. Add the ability to select a new summary function using any of 
Excel’s basic Statistical functions, and you have yourself the very model of a 
flexible data table!
Modifying the pivot table fields
To modify the fields used in your pivot table, first you display the PivotTable 
Field List by following these steps:
 
1. Click any of the pivot table’s cells.
 
 Excel adds the PivotTable Tools contextual tab with the Options and 
Design tabs to the Ribbon.
 
2. Click the Options tab under the PivotTable Tools contextual tab to dis-
play its buttons on the Ribbon.
 
3. Click the Field List button in the Show group.
 
 Excel displays the PivotTable Field List task pane, showing the fields 
that are currently in the pivot table as well as to which areas they’re cur-
rently assigned. This task pane is usually displayed automatically when 
creating or selecting a Pivot Table, but if you do not see the task pane, 
click the Field List button.
After displaying the PivotTable Field List task pane, you can make any of the 
following modifications to the table’s fields:
 
✓ To remove a field, drag its field name out of any of its drop zones 
(Report Filter, Column Labels, Row Labels, and Values) and, when the 
mouse pointer changes to an x, release the mouse button or click its 
check box in the Choose Fields to Add to Report list to remove its check 
mark.
 
✓ To move an existing field to a new place in the table, drag its field name 
from its current drop zone to a new zone (Report Filter, Column Labels, 
Row Labels, or Values) at the bottom of the task pane.

278
Part IV: Digging Data Analysis 
 
✓ To add a field to the table, drag its field name from the Choose Fields to 
Add to Report list and drop the field in the desired drop zone (Report 
Filter, Column Labels, Row Labels, or Values). If all you want to do is 
add a field to the pivot table as an additional Row Labels field, you can 
do this by selecting the field’s check box in the Choose Fields to Add to 
Report list to add a check mark.
Pivoting the table’s fields
As pivot implies, the fun of pivot tables is being able to restructure the table 
simply by rotating the column and row fields. For example, suppose that after 
making the Dept field the column field and the Location field the row field in 
the example pivot table, I now decide I want to see what the table looks like 
with the Location field as the column field and the Dept field as the row field.
No problem at all: In the PivotTable Field List task pane, I simply drag the 
Dept field label from the Column Labels drop zone to the Row Labels drop 
zone and the Location field from the Row Labels drop zone to the Column 
Labels drop zone.
Voilà — Excel rearranges the totaled salaries so that the rows of the pivot 
table show the departmental grand totals and the columns now show the 
location grand totals.
 
You can switch column and row fields by dragging their labels to their new 
locations directly in the pivot table itself. Before you can do that, however, 
you must select the Classic PivotTable Layout (Enables Dragging of Fields 
in the Grid) check box on the Display tab of the PivotTable Options dialog 
box (opened by clicking the Options button on the Options tab beneath the 
PivotTable Tools contextual tab).
Modifying the table’s summary function
By default, Excel uses the good old SUM function to create subtotals and 
grand totals for the numeric field(s) that you assign as the Data Items in the 
pivot table. 
Some pivot tables, however, require the use of another summary function, 
such as AVERAGE or COUNT. To change the summary function that Excel 
uses, simply click the Sum Of field label that’s located at the cell intersection 
of the first column field and row field in a pivot table. Next, click the Active 
Field command button on the Options tab followed by Field Settings. Doing 
this opens the Value Field Settings dialog box for that field, similar to the one 
shown in Figure 9-7.

279
 Chapter 9: Playing with Pivot Tables

After you open the Value Field Settings dialog box, you can change its sum-
mary function from the default Sum to any of the following functions by 
selecting it in the Summarize Value Field By list box:
 
✓ Count to show the count of the records for a particular category (Count 
is the default setting for any text fields that you use as Data Items in a 
pivot table)
 
✓ Average to calculate the average (that is, the arithmetic mean) for the 
values in the field for the current category and page filter
 
✓ Max to display the largest numeric value in that field for the current cat-
egory and page filter
 
✓ Min to display the smallest numeric value in that field for the current 
category and page filter
 
✓ Product to display the product of the numeric values in that field for the 
current category and page filter (all non-numeric entries are ignored)
 
✓ Count Numbers to display the number of numeric values in that field 
for the current category and page filter (all non-numeric entries are 
ignored)
 
✓ StdDev to display the standard deviation for the sample in that field for 
the current category and page filter
 
✓ StdDevp to display the standard deviation for the population in that 
field for the current category and page filter
 
✓ Var to display the variance for the sample in that field for the current 
category and page filter
 
✓ Varp to display the variance for the population in that field for the cur-
rent category and page filter

280
Part IV: Digging Data Analysis 
After you select the new summary function to use in the Summarize Value 
Field By list box on the Summarize Values By tab of the Value Field Settings 
dialog box, click the OK button to have Excel apply the new function to the 
data present in the body of the pivot table.
Get Smart with a Pivot Chart
After creating a pivot table, you can create a pivot chart to display its sum-
mary values graphically in two simple steps:
 
1. Click the PivotChart command button in the Tools group on the 
Options tab under the PivotTable Tools contextual tab to open the 
Insert Chart dialog box.
 
 Remember that the PivotTable Tools contextual tab with its two tabs — 
Options and Design — automatically appears whenever you click any 
cell in an existing pivot table.
 
2. Click the thumbnail of the type of chart you want to create in the 
Insert Chart dialog box and then click OK.
As soon you click OK after selecting the chart type, Excel displays two things 
in the same worksheet as the pivot table:
 
✓ Pivot chart using the type of chart you selected that you can move and 
resize as needed (officially known as an embedded chart — see Chapter 
10 for details)
 
✓ PivotChart Tools contextual tab divided into four tabs — Design, 
Layout, Format, and Analyze — each with its own set of buttons for cus-
tomizing and refining the pivot chart
Moving a pivot chart to its own sheet
Although Excel automatically creates all new pivot charts on the same work-
sheet as the pivot table, you may find it easier to customize and work with it 
if you move the chart to its own chart sheet in the workbook. To move a new 
pivot chart to its own chart sheet in the workbook, you follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Design tab under the PivotChart Tools contextual tab to 
bring its tools to the Ribbon.
 
 If the PivotChart Tools contextual tab doesn’t appear at the end of your 
Ribbon, click anywhere on the new pivot chart to make this tab reappear.

281
 Chapter 9: Playing with Pivot Tables
 
2. Click the Move Chart button, the sole selection in the Location group 
at the far right of the Design tab.
 
 Excel opens a Move Chart dialog box.
 
3. Click the New Sheet button in the Move Chart dialog box.
 
4. (Optional) Rename the generic Chart1 sheet name in the accompany-
ing text box by entering a more descriptive name there.
 
5. Click OK to close the Move Chart dialog box and open the new chart 
sheet with your pivot chart.
Figure 9-8 shows a clustered column pivot chart after moving the chart to its 
own chart sheet in the workbook.

Filtering a pivot chart
When you graph the data in a pivot table using a typical chart type, such as 
column, bar, or line, that uses both an x- and y-axis, the Row Labels in the 
pivot table appear along the x- (or category) axis at the bottom of the chart 

282
Part IV: Digging Data Analysis 
and the Column Labels in the pivot table become the data series that are 
delineated in the chart’s legend. The numbers in the Values field are repre-
sented on the y- (or value) axis that goes up the left side of the chart.
You can use the drop-down buttons that appear after the Report Filter, 
Legend fields, Axis fields, and Values field in the PivotChart to filter the 
charted data represented in this fashion like you do the values in the pivot 
table. As with the pivot table, remove the check mark from the (Select All) 
or (All) option and then add a check mark to each of the fields you still want 
represented in the filtered pivot chart.
Click the following drop-down buttons to filter a different part of the pivot 
chart:
 
✓ Axis Fields (Categories) to filter the categories that are charted along 
the x-axis at the bottom of the chart
 
✓ Legend Fields (Series) to filter the data series shown in columns, bars, 
or lines in the chart body and identified by the chart legend
 
✓ Report Filter to filter the data charted along the y-axis on the left side of 
the chart
 
✓ Values to filter the values represented in the PivotChart
Formatting a pivot chart
The command buttons on the Design, Layout, and Format tabs attached to 
the PivotChart Tools contextual tab make it easy to further format and cus-
tomize your pivot chart. Use the Design tab buttons to select a new chart 
style for your pivot chart or even a brand new chart type. Use the Layout tab 
buttons to refine your pivot chart by adding chart titles, text boxes, and grid-
lines. Use the Format tab buttons to refine the look of any graphics you’ve 
added to the chart as well as select a new background color for your chart.
 
To get specific information on using the buttons on these tabs, see Chapter 10, 
which covers creating charts from regular worksheet data. The Chart Tools 
contextual tab that appears when you select a chart you’ve created contains the 
same Design, Layout, and Format tabs with comparable command buttons.

A
s Confucius was reported to have once said, “A picture is worth a 
thousand words” (or, in our case, numbers). By adding charts to work-
sheets, you not only heighten interest in the otherwise boring numbers but 
also illustrate trends and anomalies that may not be apparent from just look-
ing at the values alone. Because Excel 2010 makes it so easy to chart the num-
bers in a worksheet, you can also experiment with different types of charts 
until you find the one that best represents the data — in other words, the 
picture that best tells the particular story.
Making Professional-Looking Charts
I just want to say a few words about charts in general before taking you 
through the steps for making them in Excel 2010. Remember your high-school 
algebra teacher valiantly trying to teach you how to graph equations by plot-
ting different values on an x-axis and a y-axis on graph paper? Of course, you 
were probably too busy with more important things like cool cars and rock 
’n’ roll to pay too much attention to an old algebra teacher. Besides, you 
probably told yourself, “I’ll never need this junk when I’m out on my own and 
get a job!”

286
Part V: Life beyond the Spreadsheet 
Well, see, you just never know. It turns out that even though Excel automates 
almost the entire process of charting worksheet data, you may need to be 
able to tell the x-axis from the y-axis, just in case Excel doesn’t draw the chart 
the way you had in mind. To refresh your memory and make your algebra 
teacher proud, the x-axis is the horizontal axis, usually located along the 
bottom of the chart; the y-axis is the vertical one, usually located on the left 
side of the chart.
In most charts that use these two axes, Excel plots the categories along the 
x-axis at the bottom and their relative values along the y-axis on the left. The 
x-axis is referred to as the Category axis, while the y-axis is referred to as the 
Value axis. Often the x-axis can be thought of as the time axis because the 
chart often depicts values along this axis in time periods, such as months, 
quarters, years, and so on.
 
Worksheet values represented graphically in the chart remain dynamically 
linked to the chart so that, should you make a change to one or more of the 
charted values in the worksheet, Excel automatically updates the affected part 
of the chart to suit.
Creating a new chart
Excel makes the process of creating a new chart in a worksheet as painless as 
possible:
 
1. Click a cell in the table of data you want graphed, or, when you 
only want to graph a part of the data in a table, select the cell range, 
including headings and data.
 
 If you find that Excel selects too much or too little table data complet-
ing these steps and creating the new chart, click the Select Data button 
on the Design tab (see “Customizing the chart type and style from the 
Design tab” later in this chapter) and correct the Chart Data Range in 
the Edit Source Data dialog box.
 
2. On the Insert tab of the Ribbon, click the button in the Charts group 
for the type of chart you want to create: Column, Line, Pie, Bar, Area, 
Scatter, or Other Charts.
 
 Excel then displays a drop-down gallery with thumbnails showing all the 
different styles you can choose for the type of chart you select.
 
3. Click the thumbnail with the style of chart you want to create.
 
 Style options within a chart type include 2-D, 3-D, Cylinder, Cone, 
Pyramid, Surface, Doughnut, Bubble, or Radar style to name a few.
As soon as you click one of the styles in the drop-down gallery, Excel imme-
diately creates a free-floating chart (called an embedded chart) on the same 
worksheet as the table of data the chart represents graphically.

Instant charts
If you just don’t have time to fool with the Chart 
buttons on the Insert tab of the Ribbon, position 
the cell cursor in the table of data or select the 
portion to chart and then just press F11. Excel 
then creates a clustered column chart using 
the table’s data or cell selection on its own 
chart sheet (Chart1) that precedes all the other 
sheets in the workbook, which you can then 
customize as described later in this chapter.
Figure 10-1 shows an embedded two-dimensional clustered column chart 
created immediately after clicking the Clustered Column chart style thumb-
nail, the first one on the Column chart style gallery. Because this chart 
graphs only the first quarter sales in 2010 (without the totals), I selected the 
range A2:D11 in the table, clicked the Column button on the Insert tab and 
then clicked the Clustered Column chart style thumbnail on the drop-down 
Column gallery.

Moving and resizing an embedded 
chart in a worksheet
Right after you create a new chart in a worksheet, you can easily move or 
resize the embedded chart because the chart is still selected. (You can 
always tell when a graphic object, such as a chart, is selected because you 
see selection handles — those tiny dots — around the edges of the object.) 
Whenever an embedded chart is selected (as it is automatically immediately 
after creating it or after clicking any part of it), the Chart Tools contextual tab 
with its Design, Layout, and Format tabs appears on the Ribbon, and Excel 
outlines each group of cells represented in the selected chart in a different 
color in the worksheet.
When an embedded chart is selected in a worksheet, you can move or resize 
it as follows:
 
✓ To move the chart, position the mouse pointer in a blank area inside the 
chart and drag the chart to a new location.
 
✓ To resize the chart (you may want to make it bigger if it seems distorted 
in any way), position the mouse pointer on one of the selection handles. 
When the pointer changes from the arrowhead to a double-headed 
arrow, drag the side or corner (depending on which handle you select) 
to enlarge or reduce the chart.
When the chart is properly sized and positioned in the worksheet, set the 
chart in place by deselecting it (simply click the mouse pointer in any cell 
outside the chart). As soon as you deselect the chart, the selection handles 
disappear, as does the Chart Tools contextual tab from the Ribbon. 
 
To re-select the chart later to edit, size, or move it again, just click anywhere 
on the chart with the mouse pointer. The moment you do, the sizing handles 
return to the embedded chart and the Chart Tools contextual tab appears on 
the Ribbon.
Moving an embedded chart 
onto its own chart sheet
Although Excel automatically embeds all new charts on the same worksheet 
as the data they graph (unless you create the chart by using the F11 trick), 
you may find it easier to customize and work with it if you move the chart to 

289
 Chapter 10: Charming Charts and Gorgeous Graphics
its own chart sheet in the workbook. To move an embedded chart to its own 
chart sheet in the workbook, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Move Chart button on the Design tab under the Chart Tools 
contextual tab to open the Move Chart dialog box.
 
 If the Chart Tools contextual tab doesn’t appear at the end of your 
Ribbon, click anywhere on the new chart to select the chart and make 
this tab appear.
 
2. Click the New Sheet button in the Move Chart dialog box.
 
3. (Optional) Rename the generic Chart1 sheet name in the accompany-
ing text box by entering a more descriptive name.
 
4. Click OK to close the Move Chart dialog box and open the new chart 
sheet with your chart.
 
If, after customizing the chart on its own sheet, you decide you want the fin-
ished chart to appear on the same worksheet as the data it represents, click 
the Move Chart button on the Design tab again. This time, click the Object In 
button and then select the name of the worksheet in its associated drop-down 
list box before you click OK.
Customizing the chart type and 
style from the Design tab
You can use the command buttons on the Design tab of the Chart Tools con-
textual tab to make all kinds of changes to your new chart. The Design tab 
contains the following groups of buttons to use:
 
✓ Type: Click the Change Chart Type button to change the type of chart 
and then click the thumbnail of the new chart type in the Change Chart 
Type dialog box that shows all the kinds of charts in Excel. Click the 
Save As Template button to open the Save Chart Template dialog box 
where you save the current chart’s formatting and layout (usually after 
thoroughly customizing) as a template to use in creating future charts.
 
✓ Data: Click the Switch Row/Column button to interchange the worksheet 
data used for the Legend Entries (series) with that used for the Axis 
Labels (Categories) in the selected chart. Click the Select Data button 
to open the Select Data Source dialog box where you can not only inter-
change the Legend Entries (series) with the Axis Labels (Categories) but 
also edit out or add particular entries to either category.

290
Part V: Life beyond the Spreadsheet 
 
✓ Chart Layouts: Click the More button (the last one with the horizontal 
bar and triangle pointing downward) to display all the thumbnails on 
the Chart Layouts drop-down gallery and then click the thumbnail of the 
new layout style you want applied to the selected chart.
 
✓ Chart Styles: Click the More button (the last one with the horizontal bar 
and triangle pointing downward) to display all the thumbnails on the 
Chart Styles drop-down gallery and then click the thumbnail of the new 
chart style you want applied to the selected chart.
 
✓ Location: Click the Move Chart button to move the chart to a new chart 
sheet or another worksheet.
 
✓ Mode: Click the button to select Draft or Normal mode for the chart to 
control how the chart looks onscreen and when you print it. 
 
The Chart Layout and the Chart Styles galleries do not utilize the Live Preview 
feature. You have to click a thumbnail in the gallery and actually apply it to 
the selected chart in order to see how its style looks.
Figure 10-2 shows the original clustered column chart (created in Figure 10-1) 
after clicking the Layout 9 thumbnail on the Chart Layouts drop-down gallery 
and the Style 42 thumbnail on the Chart Styles drop-down gallery. Selecting 
Style 42 gives the clustered column chart its high contrast, whereas selecting 
Layout 9 adds the generic chart titles and positions.

 Chapter 10: Charming Charts and Gorgeous Graphics
Customizing chart elements 
from the Layout tab
The command buttons on the Layout tab under the Chart Tools contextual 
tab make it easy to customize particular parts of your chart. This customiza-
tion can include:
 
✓ Repositioning discrete chart elements, including the legend and x- and 
y-axis as well as the display of data labels and data tables in the chart
 
✓ Adding, removing, and repositioning the titles in the chart, including the 
chart and x- and y-axis titles
 
✓ Modifying the display of the chart’s background, including the plot area 
for 2-D charts and the chart wall, floor, and view for 3-D charts
To make a change to a particular chart element from the Layout tab, click its 
command button and then click the option you want to use from the drop-
down menu (some options have continuation drop-down menus attached to 
them). If none of the preset options fits your needs, click the More option at 
the bottom of the drop-down list to open a format dialog box for the selected 
chart element normally containing Fill, Border Color, Border Styles, Shadow, 
Glow and Soft Edges, 3-D Format, and Alignment tabs with oodles of options 
that you can use to customize the chart element.
For example, to add a title to a chart (when you’ve selected a chart style that 
doesn’t automatically add one) and reposition or customize an existing title, 
you click the Chart Title button on the Layout tab to display the following 
options on its drop-down list:
 
✓ None to remove an existing chart title from the chart
 
✓ Centered Overlay Title to add or reposition the chart title so that it 
appears centered at the top of the plot area
 
✓ Above Chart to add or reposition the chart title so that it appears cen-
tered above the plot area
 
✓ More Title Options to open the Format Chart Title dialog box where 
you can use the options on its Fill, Border Color, Border Styles, Shadow, 
Glow and Soft Edges, 3-D Format, and Alignment tabs to customize the 
appearance of the chart title
 
The Properties group at the end of the Layout tab contains a sole Chart Name 
text box that you can use to modify the generic chart name (Chart 1, Chart 2, 
and so forth) to something more descriptive. If your worksheet contains more 
than one chart, you may find it advantageous to give it a more descriptive 
name so that it’s easy to identify in the Selection Pane.

292
Part V: Life beyond the Spreadsheet 
Adding data labels to the series in a chart
Data labels display values from the worksheet represented in the chart at 
each of its data points. To add data labels to your selected chart and position 
them, click the Data Labels button on the Layout tab and then click one of the 
following options on its drop-down menu:
 
✓ Center to position the data labels in the middle of each data point
 
✓ Inside End to position the data labels inside each data point near the 
end
 
✓ Inside Base to position the data labels at the base of each data point
 
✓ Outside End to position the data labels outside of the end of each data 
point
 
✓ More Data Label Options to open the Format Data Labels dialog box 
where you can use the options on Label Options, Number, Fill, Border 
Color, Border Styles, Shadow, Glow and Soft Edges, 3-D Format, and 
Alignment tabs to custom the appearance and position of the data labels
 
To remove all data labels from the data points in a selected chart, click the 
None option at the top of the Data Labels button’s drop-down menu on the 
Layout tab of the Chart Tools contextual tab.
Adding a data table to a chart
Sometimes, instead of data labels that can easily obscure the data points in 
the chart, you’ll want Excel to draw a data table beneath the chart showing 
the worksheet data it represents in graphic form. To add the worksheet data 
to your selected chart, click the Data Table button on the Layout tab and 
then click one of these options:
 
✓ Show Data Table to have Excel draw the table at the bottom of the chart
 
✓ Show Data Table with Legend Keys to have Excel draw the table at the 
bottom of the chart, including the color keys used in the legend to differ-
entiate the data series in the first column
 
✓ More Data Table Options to open the Format Data Table dialog box 
where you can use the options on the Data Table Options, Fill, Border 
Color, Border Styles, Shadow, Glow and Soft Edges, and 3-D Format tabs 
to customize the appearance and position of the data table
Figure 10-3 illustrates how the sample clustered column chart looks with a 
data table added to it. This data table includes the legend keys as its first 
column.

293
 Chapter 10: Charming Charts and Gorgeous Graphics

If you decide that displaying the worksheet data in a table at the bottom of the 
chart is no longer necessary, simply click the None option on the Data Table 
button’s drop-down menu on the Layout tab of the Chart Tools contextual tab.
Editing the titles in a chart
When Excel first adds titles to a new chart, it gives them generic names, such 
as Chart Title and Axis Title (for both the x- and y-axis title). To replace these 
generic titles with the actual chart titles, click the title in the chart or click 
the name of the title on the Chart Elements drop-down list. (Chart Elements 
is the first drop-down button in the Current Selection group on the Layout or 
Format tab under Chart Tools. Its text box displays the name of the element 
currently selected in the chart). Excel lets you know that a particular chart 
title is selected by placing selection handles around its perimeter.
After you select a title, you can click the insertion point in the text and then 
edit as you would any worksheet text or you can click to select the title, type 
the new title, and press Enter to completely replace it with the text you type. 
To force part of the title onto a new line, click the insertion point at the place 

294
Part V: Life beyond the Spreadsheet 
in the text where the line break is to occur. After the insertion point is posi-
tioned in the title, press Enter to start a new line.
 
After you finish editing the title, click somewhere else on the chart area to 
deselect it (or a worksheet cell if you’ve finished formatting and editing the 
chart).
Formatting chart elements 
from the Format tab
The Format tab under the Chart Tools contextual tab contains command but-
tons that make it easy to format particular chart elements after you select 
them.
Excel gives you a choice of methods for selecting individual chart elements:
 
✓ Click the element directly in the chart to select it — use the ScreenTip 
that appears at the mouse pointer to identify the chart object before you 
click to select it.
 
✓ Click the name of the chart element on the Chart Elements drop-down 
list in the Current Selection group on the Format tab — Excel shows you 
which element is currently selected by displaying its name inside the 
Chart Elements combo box. 
 
After you select an element in the chart by clicking it, you can cycle through 
and select the other elements in succession by pressing the ↑ and ↓ keys. 
Pressing the → key selects the next object; pressing the ← key selects the pre-
vious object.
 
You can tell when an element is selected in the chart because selection han-
dles appear around it and its name appears in the Chart Elements combo box 
on the Format tab.
After you select a chart element, you can then make any of the following 
changes to it:
 
✓ Format the element by selecting the appropriate command button in 
the Shape Styles group or by clicking the Format Selection button in the 
Current Selection group to open the Format dialog box for that element 
and use its options to make the desired changes.
 
✓ Move the element within the chart by positioning the arrowhead pointer 
in their midst and then dragging their boundary — with some elements, 
you can use the selection handles to resize or reorient the object.
 
✓ Remove the element from the chart by pressing the Delete key.

295
 Chapter 10: Charming Charts and Gorgeous Graphics
 
All chart elements have shortcut menus attached to them. If you know that you 
want to choose a command from the shortcut menu while you select a part 
of the chart, you can select the object and open the shortcut menu by right-
clicking the chart object. (You don’t have to click the object with the left button 
to select it and then click again with the right button to open the menu.)
Formatting the chart titles
When you add titles to your chart, Excel uses the Calibri (Body) font for the 
chart title (in 18-point size) and the x- and y-axis (in 10-point size). To change 
the font used in a title or any of its attributes, select the title and then use the 
appropriate command buttons in the Font group on the Home tab.
 
Use Live Preview to see how a particular font or font size for the selected 
chart title looks in the chart before you select it. Simply click the Font or Font 
Size drop-down buttons and then highlight different font names or sizes to 
have the selected chart title appear in them.
If you need to change other formatting options for the titles in the chart, you 
can do so using the command buttons on the Format tab of the Chart Tools 
contextual tab. To format the entire text box that contains the title, click one 
of the following buttons in the Shape Styles group:
 
✓ Shape Styles thumbnail in its drop-down gallery to format both the text 
and text box for the selected chart title
 
✓ Shape Fill button to select a new color for the text box containing the 
selected chart title from its drop-down palette
 
✓ Shape Outline button to select a new color for the outline of the text 
box for the selected chart text from its drop-down palette
 
✓ Shape Effects button to apply a new effect (Shadow, Reflection, Glow, 
Soft Edges, and so on) to the text box containing the selected chart title 
from its drop-down list
To format just the text in chart titles, click one of the buttons in the WordArt 
Styles group:
 
✓ WordArt Styles thumbnail in its drop-down gallery to apply a new 
WordArt style to the text of the selected chart title
 
✓ Text Fill button to select a new fill color for the text in the selected chart 
title from its gallery
 
✓ Text Outline button (immediately below the Text Fill button) to select 
a new outline color for the text in the selected chart title from its drop-
down palette
 
✓ Text Effects button (immediately below the Text Outline button) to 
apply a text effect (Shadow, Reflection, Glow, Bevel, and so on) to the 
text of the selected chart title from its drop-down list

296
Part V: Life beyond the Spreadsheet 
Figure 10-4 shows the example clustered column chart after formatting the 
chart titles using the Black, Text 1, Lighter 15% option on the Shape Fill but-
ton’s gallery.
Formatting the Category x-axis and Value y-axis
When charting a bunch of values, Excel isn’t too careful how it formats the 
values that appear on the y-axis (or the x-axis when using some chart types, 
such as the 3-D Column chart or an XY Scatter chart).
If you’re not happy with the way the values appear on either the x-axis or 
y-axis, you can easily change the formatting as follows:
 
1. Click the x-axis or y-axis directly in the chart or click the Chart 
Elements button (the first button in the Current Selection group of the 
Layout or Format tab) and then click Horizontal (Category) Axis (for 
the x-axis) or Vertical (Value) Axis (for the y-axis) on its drop-down 
list.
 
 Excel surrounds the axis you select with selection handles.
 
2. Click the Format Selection button in the Current Selection group of 
the Layout or Format tab or press Ctrl+1.
 
 Excel opens the Format Axis dialog box containing the following tabs: 
Axis Options, Number, Fill, Line Color, Line Style, Shadow, Glow and Soft 
Edges, 3-D Format, and Alignment.

297
 Chapter 10: Charming Charts and Gorgeous Graphics
 
3. To change the scale of the axis, the appearance of its tick marks, and 
where it crosses the other axis, change the appropriate options on 
the Axis Options tab (automatically selected when you first open the 
Format Axis dialog box) as needed.
 
 These options include those that fix the maximum and minimum amount 
for the first and last tick mark on the axis, display the values in reverse 
order (highest to lowest), and apply a logarithmic scale. You can dis-
play units on the axis (hundreds, thousands, millions, and so forth) and 
divide the values by those units, reposition the tick marks on the axis, 
and modify the value at which the other axis (y-axis when modifying the 
x-axis and x-axis when modifying the y-axis) crosses.
 
4. To change the number formatting for all values on the selected axis, 
click the Number tab and then click the number format you want to 
apply in the Category list box followed by the appropriate options 
associated with that format.
 
 For example, to select the number format with the comma as the 
thousands separator and no decimal places, you select Number in 
the Category list box; then leave the Use 1000 Separator (,) check box 
selected and enter 0 in the Decimal Places text box.
 
5. To change the alignment and orientation of the labels on the selected 
axis, click the Alignment tab and then indicate the new orientation by 
clicking the desired vertical alignment in the Vertical Alignment drop-
down list box and desired text direction in the Text Direction drop-
down list.
 
6. Click Close to close the Format Axis dialog box.
 
As you choose new options for the selected axis, Excel 2010 shows you the 
change in the chart. However, these changes are set in the chart only when 
you click Close in the Format Axis dialog box.
 
To change the default font, font size, or other text attributes for entries along 
the selected x- or y-axis, click the appropriate command buttons in the Font 
group on the Home tab (see Chapter 3 for details).
Adding Great Looking Graphics
Charts are not the only kind of graphic objects you can add to a worksheet. 
Indeed, Excel lets you spruce up a worksheet with a whole bevy of graphics, 
including sparklines (new tiny charts that fit right inside worksheet cells), 

298
Part V: Life beyond the Spreadsheet 
text boxes, clip art drawings supplied by Microsoft, as well as graphic images 
imported from other sources, such as digital photos, scanned images, and 
pictures downloaded from the Internet.
In addition to these graphics, Excel 2010 supports the creation of fancy 
graphic text called WordArt as well as a whole bevy of organizational and 
process diagrams known collectively as SmartArt graphics.
Sparking up the data with sparklines
Excel 2010 introduces a new type of information graphic called a sparkline 
that represents trends or variations in collected data. Sparklines are tiny 
graphs generally about the size of the text that surrounds them. In Excel 
2010, sparklines are the height of the worksheet cells whose data they repre-
sent and can be any of the following chart types:
 
✓ Line that represents the relative value of the selected worksheet data
 
✓ Column where the selected worksheet data is represented by tiny 
columns
 
✓ Win/Loss where the selected worksheet data appears as a win/loss 
chart; wins are represented by blue squares that appear above red 
squares (representing the losses)
To add sparklines to the cells of your worksheet:
 
1. Select the cells in the worksheet with the data you want to represent 
with a sparkline.
 
2. Click the chart type you want for your sparkline (Line, Column, or 
Win/Loss) in the Sparklines group of the Insert tab or press Alt+NSL 
for Line, Alt+NSO for Column, or Alt+NSW for Win/Loss.
 
 Excel opens the Create Sparklines dialog box containing two text boxes: 
 
• Data Range: Shows the cells you select with the data you want to 
graph.
 
• Location Range: Lets you designate the cell or cell range where you 
want the sparkline to appear.
 
3. Select the cell or cell range where you want your sparkline to appear 
in the Location Range text box and then click OK.
 
 When creating a sparkline that spans more than a single cell, the amount 
of rows and columns in the location range must match the amount of 
rows and columns in the data range. (That is, the arrays need to be of 
equal size and shape.)

299
 Chapter 10: Charming Charts and Gorgeous Graphics
 
Because sparklines are so small, you can easily add them to the cells in the 
final column of a table. That way, the sparklines (shown in this figure) can 
depict the data visually and enhance meaning while being an integral part of 
the table.
  
After you add sparklines to your worksheet, Excel 2010 adds a Sparkline 
Tools Design tab to the Ribbon that appears when the cell or range with 
the sparkline is selected. This Design tab contains buttons that you can use 
to edit the type, style, and format of the sparklines. The final group (called 
Group) on this Design tab enables you to band a range of sparklines into 
a single group that can share the same axis and/or minimum or maximum 
values (selected using the options on the Axis drop-down button). This is 
very useful when you want a collection of sparklines to share the same chart-
ing parameters so that they represent the trends in the data equally.
Telling all with a text box
Text boxes, as their name implies, are boxes in which you can add commen-
tary or explanatory text to the charts you create in Excel. They’re like Excel 
comments (see Chapter 6) that you add to worksheet cells except that you 
have to add the arrow if you want the text box to point to something in the 
chart.
In Figure 10-5, you see a clustered column chart for the MGE (Mother Goose 
Enterprises) 2010 First Quarter Sales. I added a text box with an arrow that 
points out how extraordinary the sales were for the Hickory, Dickory, Doc 
Clock Repair shops in this quarter and formatted the values on the y-axis 
with the Currency number format with zero decimal places.

Adding and formatting a text box
To add a text box like the one shown in Figure 10-5 to the chart when a chart 
is selected, click the Text Box command button in the Insert group on the 
Layout tab under the Chart Tools contextual tab. If the chart is not selected, 
you can click the Text Box command button on the Ribbon’s Insert tab.
Excel then changes the mouse pointer to a narrow vertical line with a short 
cross near the bottom. Click the location where you want to draw the text 
box and then draw the box by dragging its outline. When you release the 
mouse button after dragging this mouse pointer, Excel draws a text box in 
the shape and size of the outline.
After creating a horizontal text box, the program positions the insertion point 
at the top left, and you can then type the text you want to appear within it. 
The text you type appears in the text box and will wrap to a new line should 
you reach the right edge of the text box. You can press Enter when you want 
to force text to appear on a new line. When you finish entering the message 
for your text box, click anywhere outside the box to deselect it.

301
 Chapter 10: Charming Charts and Gorgeous Graphics
After adding a text box to a chart or worksheet while it’s still selected, you 
can edit it as follows:
 
✓ Move the text box to a new location in the chart by dragging it.
 
✓ Resize the text box by dragging the appropriate selection handle.
 
✓ Rotate the text box by dragging its rotation handle (the green circle at 
the top) in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction.
 
✓ Modify the formatting and appearance of the text box using the various 
command buttons in the Shape Styles group on the Format tab under 
the Drawing Tools contextual tab.
 
✓ Delete the text box by clicking its perimeter so that the dotted lines 
connecting the selection handles become solid and then pressing the 
Delete key.
Adding an arrow to a text box
When creating a text box, you may want to add an arrow to point directly to 
the object or part of the chart you’re referencing. To add an arrow, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Click the text box to which you want to attach the arrow in the chart 
or worksheet.
 
 Selection handles appear around the text box and the Format tab under 
the Drawing Tools contextual tab is selected on the Ribbon.
 
2. Click the Arrow command button in the Insert Shapes drop-down 
gallery on the Format tab.
 
 The Arrow command button is the third from the left in the first row 
of shapes (with the picture of an arrow). When you click this button, 
it’s selected in the palette (indicated by the new color) and the mouse 
pointer assumes the crosshair shape.
 
3. Drag the crosshair mouse pointer from the place on the text box 
where the end of the arrow (the one without the arrowhead) is to 
appear to the place where the arrow starts (and the arrowhead will 
appear) and release the mouse button.
 
 As soon as you release the mouse button, Excel draws two points, one 
at the base of the arrow (attached to the text box) and another at the 
arrowhead. At the same time, the contents of the Shape Styles drop-
down gallery changes to line styles.
 
4. Click the More button in the lower-right corner of the Shape Styles 
drop-down gallery to display the thumbnails of all its line styles and 
then mouse over the thumbnails to see how the arrow would look in 
each.

302
Part V: Life beyond the Spreadsheet 
 
 As you mouse through the different line styles in this gallery, Excel 
draws the arrow between the two selected points in the text box using 
the highlighted style.
 
5. Click the thumbnail of the line style you want the new arrow to use in 
the Shape Styles gallery.
Excel then draws a new arrow using the selected shape style, which remains 
selected (with selection handles at the beginning and end of the arrow). You 
can then edit the arrow as follows:
 
✓ Move the arrow by dragging its outline into position.
 
✓ Change the length of the arrow by dragging the selection handle at the 
arrowhead.
 
✓ Change the direction of the arrow by pivoting the mouse pointer around 
a stationary selection handle.
 
✓ Change the shape of the arrowhead or the thickness of the arrow’s 
shaft by clicking a thumbnail on the Shape Styles drop-down gallery. 
Click a new option on the Shape Outline and Shape Effects buttons on 
the Format tab of the Drawing Tools contextual tab or open the Format 
Shape dialog box (Ctrl+1) and then select the appropriate options on 
its Line Color, Line Style, Shadow, Reflection, Glow and Soft Edges, 3-D 
Format, 3-D Rotation, Size, and Text Box tabs.
 
✓ Delete the arrow by pressing the Delete key.
The wonderful world of clip art
Clip art is the name given to the over 150,000 ready-made illustrations offered 
by Microsoft for use in its various Microsoft Office programs, including Excel 
2010. Clip art drawings are now so numerous that the images are classified 
into a bunch of different categories ranging from Abstract to Web Elements.
To bring in a piece of clip art included with Office 2010, you click the Clip 
Art button on the Ribbon’s Insert tab or press Alt+NF. When you do this, 
Excel 2010 displays the Clip Art task pane (similar to the one shown in Figure 
10-6) from which you search for the type of art you want to use. To locate 
the clip(s) you want to insert into the current worksheet in the Clip Art task 
pane, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Search For text box at the top, and then enter the keyword(s) 
for the type of clip art you want to find.
 
 When you enter keywords for finding particular types of clip art, try gen-
eral, descriptive terms such as trees, flowers, people, flying, and the like.

 Chapter 10: Charming Charts and Gorgeous Graphics
 
2. (Optional) Click the Results Should Be drop-down button and remove 
(deselect) check marks from any clip art collections that you don’t 
want to search.
 
 By default, Excel searches all the collections of clip art (including the 
Office.com collection on the Web). To limit your search, you need to 
make sure that only the clip art collections you want to include in the 
search have check marks before their names, and if you don’t want 
to search the online content, uncheck the Include Office.com Content 
option below the drop-down button. 
 
3. (Optional) To limit the search to clip art only, click the Results Should 
Be drop-down button and remove check marks from the All Media 
Types, Photographs, Videos, and Audio categories.
 
4. Click the Go button to the immediate right of the Search For text box 
to initiate the search.
To insert one of the thumbnails displayed in the Clip Art task pane into the 
current worksheet (see Figure 10-7), click the thumbnail. You can also insert 
an image by positioning the mouse over it to display its drop-down button, 
clicking the drop-down button, and then choosing Insert at the top of its 
drop-down menu.

Click the Find More at Office.com link at the bottom of the Clip Art pane if 
you want to include thousands of additional clip art images and photos from 
Microsoft Office in your search. When you click this link, Windows launches 
your Web browser and displays the Images tab of the Office.com Web site. 
There, you can search for, select, and download clip art images for use in 
Excel.
 
When you insert a clip art image into the worksheet, it’s selected automati-
cally (indicated by the selection handles around its perimeter and its rotation 
handle at the top). To deselect the clip art image and set it in the worksheet, 
click anywhere in the worksheet outside of the image.
Inserting pictures from graphics files
If you want to bring in an image such as a digital photo or a scanned image 
saved in its own graphics file, click the Picture button on the Insert tab of 
the Ribbon or press Alt+NP. This opens the Insert Picture dialog box (which 
works just like opening an Excel workbook file in the Open dialog box) where 
you select the graphics file and then import it into the worksheet by clicking 
the Insert button.

305
 Chapter 10: Charming Charts and Gorgeous Graphics
 
If you want to bring in a graphic image created in another graphics program 
that isn’t saved in its own file, select the graphic in that program and then 
copy it to the Clipboard (press Ctrl+C). When you get back to your worksheet, 
place the cursor where you want the picture to appear and then paste the 
image (press Ctrl+V or click the Paste command button at the beginning of the 
Home tab).
 
When you insert a picture from a graphics file into the worksheet, it’s selected 
automatically (indicated by the selection handles around its perimeter and 
its rotation handle at the top). To deselect the graphic image and set it in the 
worksheet, click anywhere in the worksheet outside of the image.
Editing clip art and imported pictures
While a clip art image or a picture that you’ve inserted into your worksheet 
is selected (indicated by the appearance of the selection handles around its 
perimeter and a rotation handle at the top), you can make any of the follow-
ing changes:
 
✓ Move the clip art image or imported picture to a new location in the 
chart by dragging it.
 
✓ Resize the clip art image or imported picture by dragging the appropri-
ate selection handle.
 
✓ Rotate the clip art image or imported picture by dragging its rotation 
handle (the green circle at the top) in a clockwise or counterclockwise 
direction.
 
✓ Delete the clip art image or imported picture by pressing the Delete key.
Formatting clip art and imported pictures
Additionally, when a clip art image or imported picture is selected, Excel 
adds the Picture Tools Contextual tab to the Ribbon and automatically 
selects the sole Format tab under it.
The Format tab is divided into four groups: Adjust, Picture Styles, Arrange, and 
Size. The Adjust group contains the following important command buttons:
 
✓ Remove Background opens the Background Removal tab and makes 
a best guess about what parts of the picture to remove. You have the 
option to mark areas of the picture to keep or further remove, and the 
shaded areas automatically update as you isolate what areas of the 
picture you want to keep. Click Keep Changes when you are finished or 
Discard All Changes to revert back to the original picture.

306
Part V: Life beyond the Spreadsheet 
 
✓ Corrections to open a drop-down menu with a palette of presets you 
can choose for sharpening or softening the image and/or increasing or 
decreasing its brightness. Or select the Picture Corrections Options 
item to open the Format Picture dialog box with the Picture Corrections 
tab selected. There you can sharpen or soften the image or modify 
its brightness or contrast by selecting a new preset thumbnail on the 
appropriate Presets palette or by entering a new positive percentage (to 
increase) or negative percentage (to decrease) where 0% is normal in 
the appropriate combo box or dragging its slider.
 
✓ Color to open a drop-down menu with a palette of Color Saturation, 
Color Tone, or Recolor presets you can apply to the image, set a trans-
parent color (usually the background color you want to remove from 
the image), or select the Picture Color Options item to open the Picture 
Color tab of the Format Picture dialog box. There you can adjust the 
image’s colors using Color Saturation, Color Tone, or Recolor presets or 
by setting a new saturation level or color tone temperature by entering 
a new percentage in the appropriate combo box or selecting it with a 
slider.
 
✓ Artistic Effects to open a drop-down menu with special effect presets 
you can apply to the image or select the Artistic Effects Options item to 
open the Artistic Effects tab of the Format Picture dialog box where you 
can apply a special effect by selecting its preset thumbnail from the pal-
ette that appears when you click the Artistic Effect drop-down button.
 
✓ Compress Pictures to open the Compress Pictures dialog box to com-
press all images in the worksheet or just the selected graphic image to 
make them more compact and thus make the Excel workbook somewhat 
smaller when you save the images as part of its file.
 
✓ Change Picture to open the Insert Picture dialog box where you can 
select an image in a new graphics file to replace the picture.
 
✓ Reset Picture button to remove all formatting changes made and return 
the picture to the state it was in when you originally inserted it into the 
worksheet.
 
You can also format a selected clip art image or imported picture by opening 
the Format Shape dialog box (Ctrl+1) and then selecting the appropriate tab. 
Options include Fill, Line Color, Line Style, Shadow, Reflection, Glow and Soft 
Edges, 3-D Format, 3-D Rotation, Picture Corrections, Picture Color, Artistic 
Effects, Crop, Size, Properties, and Alt Text.
In addition to the command buttons in the Picture Tools group, you can use 
the command buttons in the Picture Styles group. Click a thumbnail on the 
Picture Styles drop-down gallery to select a new orientation and style for the 
selected picture. You can also modify any of the following:

307
 Chapter 10: Charming Charts and Gorgeous Graphics
 
✓ Border shape and color on the Picture Border button’s drop-down palette 
 
✓ Shadow or 3-D rotation effect on the Picture Effects button’s drop-down 
menus
 
✓ Layout on the Picture Layout button’s drop-down palette to format a pic-
ture with SmartArt-styles.
Figure 10-8 shows the imported clip art image formatted in Live Preview with 
the Relaxed Perspective, White style selected on the Picture Styles drop-
down gallery. In this style, Excel applies perspective to the image so that it 
appears to be laying on the worksheet and adds a thick white border to it.

Adding preset graphic shapes
In addition to clip art images and pictures imported from graphics files, you 
can insert preset graphic shapes in your chart or worksheet by selecting 
their thumbnails on the Shapes drop-down gallery on the Insert tab of the 
Ribbon (see Figure 10-9).

When you open the Shapes gallery by clicking the Shapes button in the 
Illustrations group on the Insert tab of the Ribbon, you see that it’s divided 
into nine sections: Recently Used Shapes, Lines, Rectangles, Basic Shapes, 
Block Arrows, Equation Shapes, Flowchart, Stars and Banners, and Callouts.
After you click the thumbnail of a preset shape in this drop-down gallery, the 
mouse pointer becomes a crosshair you use to draw the graphic by dragging 
it to the size you want.
 
After you release the mouse button, the shape you’ve drawn in the worksheet 
is still selected. This is indicated by the selection handles around its perimeter 
and the rotation handle at the top, which you can use to reposition, resize, 
and rotate the shape, if need be. Additionally, the program activates the 
Format tab on the Drawing Tools contextual tab and you can use the Shape 
Styles gallery or other command buttons to further format the shape to the 
way you want it. To set the shape and remove the selection and rotation han-
dles, click anywhere in the worksheet outside of the shape.
Working with WordArt
If selecting gazillions of preset shapes available from the Shapes gallery 
doesn’t provide enough variety for jazzing up your worksheet, you may want 
to try adding some fancy text using the WordArt gallery, opened by clicking 
the WordArt command button in the Text group of the Insert tab. 

309
 Chapter 10: Charming Charts and Gorgeous Graphics
You can add this type of “graphic” text to your worksheet by following these 
steps:
 
1. Click the WordArt command button on the Ribbon’s Insert tab or 
press Alt+NW.
 
 Excel displays the WordArt drop-down gallery, as shown in Figure 10-10.
 
Figure 10-10:

2. Click the A thumbnail in the WordArt style you want to use in the 
WordArt drop-down gallery.
 
 Excel inserts a selected text box containing Your Text Here in the center 
of the worksheet in the WordArt style you selected in the gallery.
 
3. Type the text you want to display in the worksheet in the Your Text 
Here text box.
 
 As soon as you start typing, Excel replaces Your Text Here with the 
characters you enter.
 
4. (Optional) To format the background of the text box, use Live Preview 
in the Shape Styles drop-down gallery on the Format tab to find the 
style to use and then set it by clicking its thumbnail.
 
 The Format tab under the Drawing Tools contextual tab is added and 
activated automatically when WordArt text is selected in the worksheet.
 
5. After making any final adjustments to the size, shape, or orientation of 
the WordArt text with the selection and rotation handles, click a cell 
somewhere outside of the text to deselect the graphic.
When you click outside of the WordArt text, Excel deselects the graphic, 
and the Drawing Tools contextual tab disappears from the Ribbon. (If you 
ever want this tab to reappear, all you have to do is click somewhere on the 
WordArt text to select the graphic.)

Make mine SmartArt
Excel 2010 SmartArt is a special type of graphic object that gives you the abil-
ity to construct fancy graphical lists and diagrams in your worksheet quickly 
and easily. SmartArt lists and diagrams come in a wide array of configura-
tions (including a bunch of organizational charts and various process and 
flow diagrams) that enable you to combine your own text with the predefined 
graphic shapes.
To insert a SmartArt list or diagram into the worksheet, click the SmartArt 
button on the Insert tab or press Alt+NM to open the Choose a SmartArt 
Graphic dialog box (shown in Figure 10-12). Then click a category in the navi-
gation pane on the left followed by the list’s or diagram’s thumbnail in the 
center section before you click OK.

Filling in the text for a new SmartArt graphic
To fill in the text for the first section of the new list or diagram in the outline 
text box that already contains the insertion point, simply type the text. Then 
press the ↓ key or click the next list or diagram section to set the insertion 
point there.
 
Don’t press the Tab key or the Enter key to complete a text entry in the list 
or diagram as you naturally do in the regular worksheet. In a SmartArt list or 
diagram, pressing the Enter key inserts a new section of the list or diagram 
(at the same level in hierarchical diagrams, such as an org chart). Pressing 
Tab indents the level of the current section on the outline (in hierarchical dia-
grams) or does nothing.
When you finish entering the text for your new diagram, click the Close 
button (with an X) on the text pane in the upper-right corner opposite the 
title, Type Your Text Here. (You can always reopen this box if you need to 
edit any of the text by clicking the button that appears in the middle of the 
left side of the selected list or diagram after you close the text pane.)
 
If the style of the SmartArt list or diagram you select comes with more sec-
tions than you need, you can delete the unused graphics by clicking them to 
select them (indicated by the selection and rotation handles around it) and 
then pressing the Delete key.
Formatting a SmartArt graphic
After you close the text pane attached to your SmartArt list or diagram, you 
can still format its text and graphics. To format the text, select all the graphic 
objects in the SmartArt list or diagram that need the same type of text for-
matting. (Remember you can select several objects in the list or diagram by 
holding down Ctrl as you click them.) Then click the appropriate command 
buttons in the Font group on the Home tab of the Ribbon.
To refine or change the default formatting of the graphics in a SmartArt list 
or diagram, you can use the Layouts, Change Colors, and SmartArt Styles 
drop-down galleries available on the Design tab of the SmartArt Tools 
contextual tab:
 
✓ Click the More button in the Layouts group and then click a thumbnail 
on the Layouts drop-down gallery to select an entirely new layout for 
your SmartArt list or diagram.
 
✓ Click the Change Colors button in the SmartArt Styles group and then 
click a thumbnail in the drop-down gallery to change the colors for the 
current layout.
 
✓ Click the More button in the SmartArt Styles group and then click a 
thumbnail on the SmartArt Styles drop-down gallery to select a new 
style for the current layout using the selected colors.

Screenshots anyone?
For the first time ever, Excel 2010 supports the creation of screenshot graph-
ics of objects on your Windows desktop that you can automatically insert 
into your worksheet. To take a picture of a window open on the desktop 
or any other object on it, click the Screenshot drop-down button in the 
Illustrations group of the Ribbon’s Insert tab (Alt+NSC).
Excel then opens a drop-down menu that displays a thumbnail of available 
screen shots (ones currently available) followed by the Screen Clipping item. 
To take a picture of any portion of your Windows desktop, click the Screen 
Clipping option. Excel then automatically minimizes the Excel program 
window on the Windows taskbar and then brightens the screen and changes 
the mouse pointer to a thick black cross. You can then use this pointer to 
drag an outline around the objects on the Windows desktop you want to 
include in the screenshot graphic.

314
Part V: Life beyond the Spreadsheet 
The moment you release the mouse button, Excel 2010 then automatically 
reopens the program window to its previous size displaying the selected 
graphic containing the Windows screenshot. You can then resize, move, and 
adjust this screenshot graphic as you would any other that you add to the 
worksheet.
 
Excel automatically saves the screenshot graphic that you add to a worksheet 
when you save its workbook. However, the program does not provide you 
with a means by which to save the screenshot graphic in a separate graphics 
file for use in other programs. If you need to do this, you should select the 
screenshot graphic in the Excel worksheet, copy it to the Windows Clipboard, 
and then paste it into another open graphics program where you can use its 
Save command to store it in a favorite graphics file format for use in other 
documents.
Theme for a day
Through its themes, Excel 2010 supports a way to format uniformly all the 
text and graphics you add to a worksheet. You can do this by simply clicking 
the thumbnail of the new theme you want to use in the Themes drop-down 
gallery opened by clicking the Themes button on the Page Layout tab of the 
Ribbon or by pressing Alt+PTH.
 
Use Live Preview to see how the text and graphics you’ve added to your work-
sheet appear in the new theme before you click its thumbnail.
Excel Themes combine three default elements: the color scheme applied to 
the graphics, the font (body and heading) used in the text and graphics, and 
the graphic effects applied. If you prefer, you can change any or all of these 
elements in the worksheet by clicking their command buttons in the Themes 
group at the start of the Page Layout tab:
 
✓ Colors to select a new color scheme by clicking its thumbnail on the 
drop-down palette. Click Create New Theme Colors at the bottom of 
this palette to open the Create New Theme Colors dialog box where you 
can customize each element of the color scheme and save it with a new 
descriptive name.
 
✓ Fonts to select a new font by clicking its thumbnail on the drop-down 
list. Click Create New Theme Fonts at the bottom of this list to open the 
Create New Theme Fonts dialog box where you can customize the body 
and heading fonts and save it with a new descriptive name.
 
✓ Effects to select a new set of graphic effects by clicking its thumbnail in 
the drop-down gallery.

315
 Chapter 10: Charming Charts and Gorgeous Graphics
 
To save your newly selected color scheme, font, and graphic effects as a 
custom theme that you can reuse in other workbooks, click the Themes com-
mand button and then click Save Current Theme at the bottom of the gallery 
to open the Save Current Theme dialog box. Edit the generic Theme1 filename 
in the File Name text box (without deleting the .thmx filename extension) and 
then click the Save button. Excel then adds the custom theme to a Custom 
Themes section in the Themes drop-down gallery and you can apply it to any 
active worksheet simply by clicking its thumbnail.
Controlling How Graphic Objects Overlap
In case you haven’t noticed, graphic objects float on top of the cells of the 
worksheet. Most of the objects (including charts) are opaque, meaning that 
they hide (without replacing) information in the cells beneath. If you move 
one opaque graphic so that it overlaps part of another, the one on top hides 
the one below, just as putting one sheet of paper partially on top of another 
hides some of the information on the one below. Most of the time, you should 
make sure that graphic objects don’t overlap one another or overlap cells 
with worksheet information that you want to display.
Reordering the layering of graphic objects
When graphic objects (including charts, text boxes, clip art, imported pic-
tures, drawn shapes, and SmartArt graphics) overlap each other, you can 
change how they overlay each other by sending the objects back or forward 
so that they reside on different (invisible) layers.
Excel 2010 enables you to move a selected graphic object to a new layer in 
one of two ways:
 
✓ For a clip art image, picture, SmartArt diagram, or graphic shape, click 
the Bring Forward button’s arrow and select Bring to Front or click the 
Send Backward button’s arrow and select Send to Back on the Format 
tab under the Drawing Tools, Picture Tools, or SmartArt tools contextual 
tab to bring the selected object to the topmost or bottommost layer of 
the stack, respectively.
 
✓ Click the Selection Pane command button in the Arrange group on the 
Format tab under the Drawing Tools, Picture Tools, or SmartArt Tools 
contextual tab to display the Selection and Visibility task pane. Then, 
click the Bring Forward or Send Backward buttons at the bottom of 
this task pane in the Re-order section until the selected graphic object 
appears on the desired layer.

316
Part V: Life beyond the Spreadsheet 
Grouping graphic objects
Sometimes you may find that you need to group several graphic objects so 
that they act as one unit (like a text box with its arrow). That way, you can 
move these objects or size them in one operation.
To group objects, Ctrl+click each object you want to group to select them all. 
Next, click the Group button (the second in the right column of the Arrange 
group with the picture of two entwined squares) on the Format tab under the 
Drawing Tools or Picture Tools contextual tab and then click Group on its 
drop-down menu.
After grouping several graphic objects, whenever you click any part of the 
mega-object, every part is selected (and selection handles appear only 
around the perimeter of the combined object).
 
If you need to independently move or size grouped objects, you can ungroup 
them by right-clicking an object and then choosing Group➪Ungroup on the 
object’s shortcut menu or by clicking Group➪Ungroup on the Format tab 
under the Drawing Tools or Picture Tools contextual tabs.
Hiding graphic objects
The Selection and Visibility task pane enables you not only to change the lay-
ering of various graphic objects in the worksheet but also to control whether 
they are hidden or displayed.
The way you open the Selection and Visibility task pane depends on the type 
of graphic object you’ve selected in the worksheet:
 
✓ Charts: Click the Selection Pane button on the Format tab of the Chart 
Tools contextual tab or press Alt+JOAP.
 
✓ Text boxes and shapes: Click the Selection Pane button on the Format 
tab under the Drawing Tools contextual tab or press Alt+JDAP.
 
✓ Clip art and pictures: Click the Selection Pane button on the Format tab 
under the Picture Tools contextual tab or press Alt+JPAP.
 
✓ SmartArt: Click the Selection Pane on the Arrange button’s drop-down 
palette on the Format tab of the SmartArt Tools contextual tab or press 
Alt+JOAP.
After you open the Selection and Visibility task pane, you can temporar-
ily hide any of the graphic objects listed by clicking its eye check box (to 
remove the eye icon). To remove the display of all the charts and graphics 
in the worksheet, click the Hide All button at the bottom of the Selection and 
Visibility task pane instead.

317
 Chapter 10: Charming Charts and Gorgeous Graphics
To redisplay a hidden graphic object, simply click its empty eye check box 
to put the eye icon back into it. To redisplay all graphic objects after hiding 
them all, click the Show All button at the bottom of the task pane.
 
If you hide all the charts and graphics in a worksheet by clicking the Hide All 
button and then close the Selection and Visibility task pane by clicking its 
Close button, you’ll have no way of redisplaying this task pane so that you can 
bring back their display by clicking the Show All button. That’s because you 
have no graphic objects left to select in the worksheet and, therefore, no way 
to get the contextual tabs with their Selection Pane buttons to appear on the 
Ribbon. 
 
In this dire case, the only way I know to get the Selection and Visibility task 
pane to appear so that you can click the Show All button is to create a dummy 
(pardon my French) graphic object in the worksheet (such as an arrow or 
oval in the Illustrations group on the Insert tab). Then click the Selection 
Pane button on the Format tab of its Drawing Tools contextual tab. With the 
Selection and Visibility task pane open, click the Show All button to bring back 
the display of all the charts and graphics you want to keep. Get rid of the still-
selected dummy graphic object by pressing the Delete key. (Whew, that was a 
close one!)
Printing Just the Charts
Sometimes, you may want to print only a particular chart embedded in the 
worksheet (independent of the worksheet data it represents or any of the 
other stuff you’ve added). To do this, open the Selection and Visibility task 
pane (as described in the preceding section) and make sure that any hidden 
charts are displayed in the worksheet by putting the eye icon back in their 
check boxes.
Next, click the chart to select it in the worksheet and then choose File➪Print 
or press Ctrl+P to open the Print Settings panel in Backstage View, where you 
see the chart now displayed in the print preview area.
If you need to change the printed chart size or the orientation of the printing 
(or both), click the File tab and then click the Page Setup dialog box launcher 
on the Page Layout tab of the Ribbon to open the Page Setup dialog box. To 
change the orientation of the printing (or the paper size), change the appro-
priate options on the Page tab in the Page Setup dialog box. To change the 
print quality or print a color chart in black and white, click the Chart tab and 
change these options. You can then return to the print preview area in the 
Print Settings panel in Backstage View by clicking the Print Preview button at 
the bottom of the Page Setup dialog box. If everything looks good in the print 
preview area, start printing the chart by clicking the Print button.

Getting on the Data List
In This Chapter
▶ Setting up a data list in Excel
▶ Entering and editing records in the data list
▶ Sorting records in the data list
▶ Filtering records in the data list
▶ Importing external data into the worksheet
T
he purpose of all the worksheet tables that I discuss elsewhere in this 
book has been to perform essential calculations (such as to sum monthly 
or quarterly sales figures) and then present the information in an under-
standable form. However, you can create another kind of worksheet table in 
Excel: a data list (less accurately and more colloquially known as a database). 
The purpose of a data list is not so much to calculate new values but rather 
to store lots and lots of information in a consistent manner. For example, 
you can create a data list that contains the names and addresses of all your 
clients, or you can create a list that contains all the essential facts about your 
employees.
Creating a Data List
Creating a new data list in a worksheet is much like creating a worksheet 
table except that it has only column headings and no row headings. To set up 
a new data list, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the blank cell where you want to start the new data list and then 
enter the column headings (technically known as field names in data-
base parlance) that identify the different kinds of items you need to 
keep track of (such as First Name, Last Name, Street, City, State, and so 
on) in the columns to the right.
 
 After creating the fields of the data list by entering their headings, you’re 
ready to enter the first row of data.

2. Make the first entries in the appropriate columns of the row immedi-
ately following the one containing the field names.
 
 These entries in the first row beneath the one with the field names con-
stitute the first record of the data list.
 
3. Click the Format as Table button in the Styles group of the Ribbon’s 
Home tab and then click a thumbnail of one of the table styles in the 
drop-down gallery.
 
 Excel puts a marquee around all the cells in the new data list, including 
the top row of field names. As soon as you click a table style in the drop-
down gallery, the Format As Table dialog box appears listing the address 
of the cell range enclosed in the marquee in the Where Is the Data for 
Your Table text box.
 
4. Click the My Table Has Headers check box to select it, if necessary.
 
5. Click the OK button to close the Format As Table dialog box.
Excel formats your new data list in the selected table format and adds 
filters (drop-down buttons) to each of the field names in the top row (see 
Figure 11-1).

 Chapter 11: Getting on the Data List
Adding records to a data list
After creating the field names and one record of the data list and formatting 
them as a table, you’re ready to start entering the rest of its data as records 
in subsequent rows of the list. The most direct way to do this is to press the 
Tab key when the cell cursor is in the last cell of the first record. Doing this 
causes Excel to add an extra row to the data list where you can enter the 
appropriate information for the next record.
 
When doing data entry directly in a data list table, press the Tab key to pro-
ceed to the next field in the new record rather than the ← key. That way, when 
you complete the entry in the last field of the record, you automatically extend 
the data list, add a new record, and position the cell cursor in the first field of 
that record. If you press ← to complete the entry, Excel simply moves the cell 
cursor to the next cell outside the data list table.
Adding the Form button to the Quick Access toolbar
Instead of entering the records of a data list directly in the table, you can use 
Excel’s data form to make the entries. The only problem with using the data 
form is that the command to display the form in a worksheet with a data list 
is not part of the Ribbon commands. You can access the data form only by 
adding its command button to the Quick Access toolbar. To do this, you must 
follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Customize Quick Access Toolbar button at the end of the 
Quick Access toolbar and then click the More Commands item at the 
bottom of its drop-down menu.
 
 Excel opens the Excel Options dialog box with the Quick Access Toolbar 
tab selected.
 
 The Form command button you want to add to the Quick Access toolbar 
is only available when you click the Commands Not in the Ribbon option 
on the Choose Commands From drop-down list.
Calculated field entries
When you want Excel to calculate the entries 
for a particular field by formula, you need 
to enter that formula in the correct field in 
the first record of the data list. In the sample 
Employee Data list, for example, the Years 
of Service field in cell I2 of the first record 
shown in Figure 11-1 is calculated by the 
formula =YEAR(TODAY())-YEAR(H2). 
Cell H2 contains the date of hire that this for-
mula uses to compute the number of years that 
an employee has worked at the company. Excel 
then inserts the result of this calculation into 
the cell as the field entry.

322
Part V: Life beyond the Spreadsheet 
 
2. Click the Commands Not in the Ribbon option near the top of the 
Choose Commands From drop-down list.
 
3. Click Form in the Choose Commands From list box and then click the 
Add button.
 
 Excel adds the Form button to the very end of the Quick Access toolbar. 
If you so desire, you can click the Move Up and Move Down buttons to 
reposition the Form button on this toolbar.
 
4. Click OK to close the Excel Options dialog box and return to the work-
sheet with the data list.
 
You can also add the Form button to a custom group on a custom tab. For 
example, in Figure 11-2, you see that I’ve added the Form button to a Data List 
group on a custom Misc tab on the Ribbon as well as to the Quick Access tool-
bar (shown below the Ribbon).
Adding records to a data list using the data form
The first time you click the custom Form button you added to the Quick 
Access toolbar, Excel analyzes the row of field names and entries for the first 
record and creates a data form. This data form lists the field names down the 
left side of the form with the entries for the first record in the appropriate 
text boxes next to them. In Figure 11-2, you can see the data form for the new 
Employee Data database; it looks kind of like a customized dialog box.
The data form Excel creates includes the entries you made in the first record. 
The data form also contains a series of buttons (on the right side) that you 
use to add, delete, or find specific records in the database. Right above the 
first button (New), the data form lists the number of the record you’re look-
ing at followed by the total number of records (1 of 1 when you first create 
the data form). When creating new entries it will display New Record above 
this button instead of the record number.
 
All the formatting that you assign to the particular entries in the first record is 
applied automatically to those fields in subsequent records you enter and is 
used in the data form. For example, if your data list contains a telephone field, 
you need to enter only the ten digits of the phone number in the Telephone 
field of the data form if the initial telephone number entry is formatted in 
the first record with the Special Phone Number format. (See Chapter 3 for 
details on sorting number formats.) That way, Excel takes a new entry in the 
Telephone file, such as 3075550045, for example, and automatically formats it 
so that it appears as (307) 555-0045 in the appropriate cell of the data list.
The process for adding records to a data list with the data form is simple. 
When you click the New button, Excel displays a blank data form (marked 
New Record at the right side of the data form), which you get to fill in.

Form buttons
After you enter the information for the first field, press the Tab key to 
advance to the next field in the record.
 
Whoa! Don’t press the Enter key to advance to the next field in a record. If you 
do, you’ll insert the new, incomplete record into the database.
Continue entering information for each field and pressing Tab to go to the 
next field in the database.
 
✓ If you notice that you’ve made an error and want to edit an entry in a 
field you already passed, press Shift+Tab to return to that field.
 
✓ To replace the entry, just start typing.
 
✓ To edit some of the characters in the field, press → or click the I-beam 
pointer in the entry to locate the insertion point; then edit the entry 
from there.
When entering information in a particular field, you can copy the entry made 
in that field from the previous record by pressing Ctrl+’ (apostrophe). Press 
Ctrl+’, for example, to carry forward the same entry in the State field of each 
new record when entering a series of records for people who all live in the 
same state.

324
Part V: Life beyond the Spreadsheet 
When entering dates in a date field, use a consistent date format that Excel 
knows. (For example, enter something like 7/21/98.) When entering zip codes 
that sometimes use leading zeros that you don’t want to disappear from the 
entry (such as zip code 00102), format the first field entry with the Special 
Zip Code number format (refer to Chapter 3 for details on sorting number for-
mats). In the case of other numbers that use leading zeros, you can format it 
by using the Text format or put an ’ (apostrophe) before the first 0. The apos-
trophe tells Excel to treat the number like a text label but doesn’t show up 
in the database itself. (The only place you can see the apostrophe is on the 
Formula bar when the cell cursor is in the cell with the numeric entry.)
Press the ↓ key when you’ve entered all the information for the new record. 
Or, instead of the ↓ key, you can press Enter or click the New button (refer to 
Figure 11-2). Excel inserts the new record as the last record in the database 
in the worksheet and displays a new blank data form in which you can enter 
the next record (see Figure 11-3).
 
Figure 11-3: 
When you 
advance 
to a new 
record in

as the last 
row of the 
list.
 
When you finish adding records to the database, press the Esc key or click 
the Close button at the bottom of the dialog box to close the data form.
Editing records with the data form
After the database is under way and you’re caught up with entering new 
records, you can start using the data form to perform routine maintenance 
on the database. For example, you can use the data form to locate a record 

325
 Chapter 11: Getting on the Data List
you want to change and then make the edits to the particular fields. You can 
also use the data form to find a specific record you want to remove and then 
delete it from the database.
 
✓ Locate the record you want to edit in the database by bringing up its 
data form. See the following two sections (“Moving through the records 
in the data form” and “Finding records with the data form”) and Table 
11-1 for hints on locating records.
 
✓ To edit the fields of the current record, move to that field by pressing 
Tab or Shift+Tab and replace the entry by typing a new one.
 
 Alternatively, press ← or → or click the I-beam cursor to reposition the 
insertion point, and then make your edits.
 
✓ To clear a field entirely, select it and then press the Delete key.
To delete the entire record from the database, click the Delete button in the 
data form. Excel displays an alert box with the following dire warning:
Displayed record will be permanently deleted
To delete the record displayed in the data form, click OK. To play it safe and 
keep the record intact, click the Cancel button.
 
You cannot use the Undo feature to bring back a record you removed with 
the Delete button! Excel is definitely not kidding when it warns permanently 
deleted. As a precaution, always save a back-up version of the worksheet with 
the database before you start removing old records.
Moving through the records in the data form
In the data form, you can use the scroll bar to the right of the list of field 
names or various keystrokes (both summarized in Table 11-1) to move 
through the records in the database until you find the one you want to edit or 
delete.
 
✓ To move to the data form for the next record in the data list: Press ↓, 
press Enter, or click the down scroll arrow at the bottom of the scroll 
bar.
 
✓ To move to the data form for the previous record in the data list: Press 
↑, press Shift+Enter, or click the up scroll arrow at the top of the scroll 
bar.
 
✓ To move to the data form for the first record in the data list: Press 
Ctrl+↑, press Ctrl+PgUp, or drag the scroll box to the very top of the 
scroll bar.
 
✓ To move to a new data form immediately following the last record in 
the database: Press Ctrl+↓, press Ctrl+PgDn, or drag the scroll box to 
the very bottom of the scroll bar.

Finding records with the data form
In a large data list, trying to find a particular record by moving from record to 
record — or even moving ten records at a time with the scroll bar — can take 
all day. Rather than waste time trying to manually search for a record, you 
can use the Criteria button in the data form to look it up.
When you click the Criteria button, Excel clears all the field entries in the 
data form (and replaces the record number with the word Criteria) so that 
you can enter the criteria to search for in the blank text boxes.
For example, suppose that you need to edit Sherry Caulfield’s profit sharing 
status. Unfortunately, her paperwork doesn’t include her ID number. All you 
know is that she works in the Boston office and spells her last name with a C 
instead of a K.
To find her record, you can use the information you have to narrow the 
search to all the records where the last name begins with the letter C and 
the Location field contains Boston. To limit your search in this way, open the 
data form for the Employee Data database, click the Criteria button, and then 
type C* in the text box for the Last Name field. Also enter Boston in the text 
box for the Location field (see Figure 11-4).

327
 Chapter 11: Getting on the Data List
When you enter search criteria for records in the blank text boxes of the data 
form, you can use the ? (for single) and * (for multiple) wildcard characters.
 
Figure 11-4: 
Use the

Now click the Find Next button. Excel displays in the data form the first 
record in the database where the last name begins with the letter C and the 
Location field contains Boston. As shown in Figure 11-5, the first record in 
this database that meets these criteria is for William Cobb. To find Sherry’s 
record, click the Find Next button again. Sherry Caulfield’s record shows up 
in Figure 11-6. Having located Caulfield’s record, you can then edit her profit 
sharing status from No to Yes in the text box for the Profit Sharing field. 
When you click the Close button, Excel records her new profit sharing status 
in the data list.

When you use the Criteria button in the data form to find records, you can 
include the following operators in the search criteria you enter to locate a 
specific record in the database:
Operator

>
Greater than
>=
Greater than or equal to
<
Less than
<=

For example, to display only those records where an employee’s salary is 
greater than or equal to $50,000, enter >=50000 in the text box for the Salary 
field and then click the Find Next button.
When specifying search criteria that fit a number of records, you may have to 
click the Find Next or Find Prev button several times to locate the record you 
want. If no record fits the search criteria you enter, the computer beeps at 
you when you click these buttons.
To change the search criteria, first clear the data form by clicking the Criteria 
button again and then clicking the Clear button.

329
 Chapter 11: Getting on the Data List
To switch back to the current record without using the search criteria you 
enter, click the Form button. (This button replaces the Criteria button as 
soon as you click the Criteria button.)
Sorting Records in a Data List
Every data list you put together in Excel will have some kind of preferred 
order for maintaining and viewing the records. Depending on the list, you 
may want to see the records in alphabetical order by last name. In the case 
of a database of clients, you may want to see the records arranged alphabeti-
cally by company name. In the case of the Employee Data list, the preferred 
order is in numerical order by the ID number assigned to each employee 
when he or she is hired.
When you initially enter records for a new data list, you no doubt enter them 
in either the preferred order or the order in which you retrieve their records. 
However you start out, as you will soon discover, you don’t have the option 
of adding subsequent records in that preferred order. Whenever you add 
a new record, Excel tacks that record onto the bottom of the database by 
adding a new row.
Suppose you originally enter all the records in a Client data list in alpha-
betical order by company (from Acme Pet Supplies to Zastrow and Sons), 
and then you add the record for a new client: Pammy’s Pasta Palace. Excel 
puts the new record at the bottom of the barrel — in the last row right after 
Zastrow and Sons — instead of inserting it in its proper position, which is 
somewhere after Acme Pet Supplies but definitely well ahead of Zastrow and 
his wonderful boys!
This isn’t the only problem you can have with the original record order. Even 
if the records in the data list remain stable, the preferred order merely repre-
sents the order you use most of the time. What about those times when you 
need to see the records in another, special order?
For example, if you usually work with a client data list in numerical order 
by case number, you might instead need to see the records in alphabetical 
order by the client’s last name to quickly locate a client and look up his or 
her balance due in a printout. When using records to generate mailing labels 
for a mass mailing, you want the records in zip code order. When generating 
a report for your account representatives showing which clients are in whose 
territory, you need the records in alphabetical order by state and maybe 
even by city.

330
Part V: Life beyond the Spreadsheet 
To have Excel correctly sort the records in a data list, you must specify 
which field’s values determine the new order of the records. (Such fields are 
technically known as the sorting keys in the parlance of the database enthu-
siast.) Further, you must specify what type of order you want to create using 
the information in these fields. Choose from two possible orders:
 
✓ Ascending order: Text entries are placed in alphabetical order from A 
to Z, values are placed in numerical order from smallest to largest, and 
dates are placed in order from oldest to newest.
 
✓ Descending order: This is the reverse of alphabetical order from Z to 
A, numerical order from largest to smallest, and dates from newest to 
oldest.
Sorting records on a single field
When you need to sort the data list on only one particular field (such as the 
Record Number, Last Name, or Company field), you simply click that field’s 
AutoFilter button and then click the appropriate sort option on its drop-down 
list:
 
✓ Sort A to Z or Sort Z to A in a text field
 
✓ Sort Smallest to Largest or Sort Largest to Smallest in a number field
 
✓ Sort Oldest to Newest or Sort Newest to Oldest in a date field
Excel then reorders all the records in the data list in accordance with the 
new ascending or descending order in the selected field. If you find that 
you’ve sorted the list in error, simply click the Undo button on the Quick 
Up and down the ascending 
and descending sort orders
When you use the ascending sort order on a 
field in the data list that contains many differ-
ent kinds of entries, Excel places numbers (from 
smallest to largest) before text entries (in alpha-
betical order), followed by any logical values 
(FALSE and TRUE), error values, and finally, 
blank cells. When you use the descending sort 
order, Excel arranges the different entries in 
reverse: numbers are still first, arranged from 
largest to smallest; text entries go from Z to A; 
and the TRUE logical value precedes the FALSE 
logical value.

331
 Chapter 11: Getting on the Data List
Access toolbar or press Ctrl+Z right away to return the list to its order before 
you selected one of these sort options.
 
Excel shows when a field has been used to sort the data list by adding an up 
or down arrow to its AutoFilter button. An arrow pointing up indicates that 
the ascending sort order was used and an arrow pointing down indicates that 
the descending sort order was used.
Sorting records on multiple fields
You need to use more than one field in sorting when the first field you use 
contains duplicate values and you want a say in how the records with dupli-
cates are arranged. (If you don’t specify another field to sort on, Excel just 
puts the records in the order in which you entered them.)
The best and most common example of when you need more than one field 
is when sorting a large database alphabetically by last name. Suppose that 
you have a database that contains several people with the last name Smith, 
Jones, or Zastrow (as is the case when you work at Zastrow and Sons). If 
you specify the Last Name field as the only field to sort on (using the default 
ascending order), all the duplicate Smiths, Joneses, and Zastrows are placed 
in the order in which their records were originally entered. To better sort 
these duplicates, you can specify the First Name field as the second field to 
sort on (again using the default ascending order), making the second field 
the tie-breaker, so that Ian Smith’s record precedes that of Sandra Smith, and 
Vladimir Zastrow’s record comes after that of Mikhail Zastrow.
To sort records in a data list on multiple fields, follow these steps:
 
1. Position the cell cursor in one of the cells in the data list table.
 
2. If the Home tab on the Ribbon is selected, click Custom Sort on the 
Sort & Filter button’s drop-down list (Alt+HSU). If the Data tab is 
selected, click the Sort command button.
 
 Excel selects all the records of the database (without including the first 
row of field names) and opens the Sort dialog box, shown in Figure 11-7.
 
3. Click the name of the field you first want the records sorted by in the 
Sort By drop-down list.
 
 If you want the records arranged in descending order, remember also to 
click the descending sort option (Z to A, Largest to Smallest, or Newest 
to Oldest) Order drop-down list to the right.

4. (Optional) If the first field contains duplicates and you want to specify 
how the records in this field are sorted, click the Add Level button 
to insert another sort level. Select a second field to sort on in the 
Then By drop-down list and select either the ascending or descending 
option in its Order drop-down list to its right.
 
5. (Optional) If necessary, repeat Step 4, adding as many additional sort 
levels as required.
 
6. Click OK or press Enter.
 
 Excel closes the Sort dialog box and sorts the records in the data list 
using the sorting fields in the order of their levels in this dialog box. If 
you see that you sorted the database on the wrong fields or in the wrong 
order, click the Undo button on the Quick Access toolbar or press Ctrl+Z 
to restore the database records to their previous order.
Check out how I set up my search in the Sort dialog box in Figure 11-7. In the 
Employee Data List, I chose the Last Name field as the first field to sort on 
(Sort By) and the First Name field as the second field (Then By) — the second 
field sorts records with duplicate entries in the first field. I also chose to sort 
the records in the Employee Data List in alphabetical (A to Z) order by last 
name and then first name. See the Employee Data List right after sorting (in 
Figure 11-8). Note how the Edwards — Cindy and Jack — are now arranged in 
the proper first name/last name alphabetical order.
Sorting something besides a data list
The Sort command is not just for sorting records 
in the data list. You can use it to sort financial 
data or text headings in the spreadsheet tables 
you build as well. When sorting regular work-
sheet tables, just be sure to select all the cells 
with the data to be sorted (and only those with 
the data to be sorted) before you open the Sort 
dialog box by clicking Custom Sort on the Sort 
& Filter button’s drop-down list on the Ribbon’s 
Home tab or the Sort button on the Data tab.

Filtering the Records in a Data List
Excel’s Filter feature makes it a breeze to hide everything in a data list except 
the records you want to see. To filter the data list to just those records that 
contain a particular value, you then click the appropriate field’s AutoFilter 
button to display a drop-down list containing all the entries made in that field 
and select the one you want to use as a filter. Excel then displays only those 
records that contain the value you selected in that field. (All other records 
are hidden temporarily.)
Excel automatically excludes the first row of the 
cell selection from the sort (on the assumption 
that this row is a header row containing field 
names that shouldn’t be included). To include 
the first row of the cell selection in the sort, 
be sure to deselect the My Data Has Headers 
check box before you click OK to begin sorting.
If you want to sort worksheet data by columns, 
click the Options button in the Sort dialog box. 
Click the Sort Left to Right button in the Sort 
Options dialog box and then click OK. Now you 
can designate the number of the row (or rows) 
to sort the data on in the Sort dialog box.

334
Part V: Life beyond the Spreadsheet 
 
If for any reason, the column headings of your data list table don’t have filter 
drop-down buttons displayed in their cells after the field names, you can get 
them back simply by clicking Home➪Sort & Filter➪Filter or pressing Alt+HSF.
For example, in Figure 11-9, I filtered the Employee Data List to display only 
those records in which the Location is either Boston or San Francisco by 
clicking the Location field’s AutoFilter button and then clicking the (Select 
All) check box to remove its check mark. I then clicked the Boston and San 
Francisco check boxes to add check marks to them before clicking OK. (It’s 
as simple as that.)

The 
Employee 
Data List

ing out all 
records 
except 
those with 
Boston 
or San 
Francisco in

field. 
 
After you filter a data list so that only the records you want to work with are 
displayed, you can copy those records to another part of the worksheet to 
the right of the database (or better yet, another worksheet in the workbook). 
Simply select the cells, then click the Copy button on the Home tab or press 
Ctrl+C, move the cell cursor to the first cell where the copied records are to 
appear, and then press Enter. After copying the filtered records, you can then 
redisplay all the records in the database or apply a slightly different filter.
If you find that filtering the data list by selecting a single value in a field drop-
down list box gives you more records than you really want to contend with, 
you can further filter the database by selecting another value in a second 
field’s drop-down list. For example, suppose that you select Boston as the 
filter value in the Location field’s drop-down list and end up with hundreds of 
Boston records displayed in the worksheet. To reduce the number of Boston 
records to a more manageable number, you could then select a value (such 
as Human Resources) in the Dept field’s drop-down list to further filter the 
database and reduce the records you have to work with onscreen. When you 

335
 Chapter 11: Getting on the Data List
finish working with the Boston Human Resources employee records, you can 
display another set by displaying the Dept field’s drop-down list again and 
changing the filter value from Human Resources to some other department, 
such as Accounting.
When you’re ready to display all the records in the database again, click 
the filtered field’s AutoFilter button (indicated by the appearance of a cone 
filter on its drop-down button) and then click the (Select All) option near the 
middle of the drop-down list before you click OK. 
 
You can temporarily remove the AutoFilter buttons from the cells in the top 
row of the data list containing the field names and later redisplay them by 
clicking the Filter button on the Data tab or by pressing Alt+AT.
Using ready-made number filters
Excel contains a number filter option called Top 10. You can use this option 
on a number field to show only a certain number of records (like the ones 
with the ten highest or lowest values in that field or those in the ten highest 
or lowest percent in that field). To use the Top 10 option to filter a database, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Click the AutoFilter button on the numeric field you want to filter with 
the Top 10 option. Then highlight Number Filters in the drop-down list 
and click Top 10 on its submenu.
 
 Excel opens the Top 10 AutoFilter dialog box. By default, the Top 10 
AutoFilter chooses to show the top ten items in the selected field. 
However, you can change these default settings before filtering the 
database.
 
2. To show only the bottom ten records, change Top to Bottom in the 
leftmost drop-down list box.
 
3. To show more or fewer than the top or bottom ten records, enter the 
new value in the middle text box (that currently holds 10) or select a 
new value by using the spinner buttons.
 
4. To show those records that fall into the Top 10 or Bottom 10 (or what-
ever) percent, change Items to Percent in the rightmost drop-down 
list box.
 
5. Click OK or press Enter to filter the database by using your Top 10 
settings.

In Figure 11-10, you can see the Employee Data List after using the Top 10 
option (with all its default settings) to show only those records with salaries 
that are in the top ten. David Letterman would be proud!

Using ready-made date filters
When filtering a data list by the entries in a date field, Excel makes available a 
variety of date filters that you can apply to the list. These ready-made filters 
include Tomorrow, Today, Yesterday, as well as Next, This, and Last for the 
Week, Month, Quarter, and Year. Additionally, Excel offers Year to Date and 
All Dates in the Period filters. When you select the All Dates in the Period 
filter, Excel enables you to choose between Quarter 1 through 4 or any of the 
twelve months, January through December, as the period to use in filtering 
the records.
To select any of these date filters, you click the date field’s AutoFilter button, 
then highlight Date Filters on the drop-down list and click the appropriate 
date filter option on the continuation menu(s).
Getting creative with custom filtering
In addition to filtering a data list to records that contain a particular field 
entry (such as Newark as the City or CA as the State), you can create custom 
AutoFilters that enable you to filter the list to records that meet less-exacting 
criteria (such as last names starting with the letter M) or ranges of values 
(such as salaries between $25,000 and $75,000 a year).
To create a custom filter for a field, you click the field’s AutoFilter button and 
then highlight Text Filters, Number Filters, or Date Filters (depending on the 

337
 Chapter 11: Getting on the Data List
type of field) on the drop-down list and then click the Custom Filter option at 
the bottom of the continuation list. When you select the Custom Filter option, 
Excel displays a Custom AutoFilter dialog box, similar to the one shown in 
Figure 11-11.
 
You can also open the Custom AutoFilter dialog box by clicking the initial 
operator (Equals, Does Not Equal, Greater Than, and so on) on the field’s Text 
Filters, Number Filters, or Date Filters submenus.

In this dialog box, you select the operator that you want to use in the 
first drop-down list box. (See Table 11-2 for operator names and what 
they locate.) Then enter the value (text or numbers) that should be met, 
exceeded, fallen below, or not found in the records of the database in the text

If you want to filter records in which only a particular field entry matches, 
exceeds, falls below, or simply is not the same as the one you enter in the 
text box, you then click OK or press Enter to apply this filter to the database. 
However, you can use the Custom AutoFilter dialog box to filter the database 
to records with field entries that fall within a range of values or meet either 
one of two criteria.

339
 Chapter 11: Getting on the Data List
To set up a range of values, you select the “is greater than” or “is greater than 
or equal to” operator for the top operator and then enter or select the lowest 
(or first) value in the range. Then, make sure that the And option is selected, 
select “is less than” or “is less than or equal to” as the bottom operator, and 
enter the highest (or last) value in the range.
Check out Figures 11-11 and 11-12 to see how I filter the records in the 
Employee Data List so that only those records where Salary amounts are 
between $25,000 and $75,000 are displayed. As shown in Figure 11-11, you 
set up this range of values as the filter by selecting “is greater than or equal 
to” as the operator and 25,000 as the lower value of the range. Then, with the 
And option selected, you select “is less than or equal to” as the operator and 
75,000 as the upper value of the range. The results of applying this filter to 
the Employee Data List are shown in Figure 11-12.
 
Figure 11-12:

To set up an either/or condition in the Custom AutoFilter dialog box, you nor-
mally choose between the “equals” and “does not equal” operators (which-
ever is appropriate) and then enter or select the first value that must be met 

340
Part V: Life beyond the Spreadsheet 
or must not be equaled. Then you select the Or option and select whichever 
operator is appropriate and enter or select the second value that must be 
met or must not be equaled.
For example, if you want to filter the data list so that only records for the 
Accounting or Human Resources departments in the Employee Data List 
appear, you select “equals” as the first operator and then select or enter 
Accounting as the first entry. Next, you click the Or option, select “equals” 
as the second operator, and then select or enter Human Resources as the 
second entry. When you then filter the database by clicking OK or pressing 
Enter, Excel displays only those records with either Accounting or Human 
Resources as the entry in the Dept field.
Importing External Data
Excel 2010 makes it easy to import data into a worksheet from other data-
base tables created with standalone database management systems (such as 
Microsoft Office Access), a process known as making an external data query. 
You can also use Web queries to import data directly from various Web 
pages containing financial and other types of statistical data that you need to 
work with in the Excel worksheet.
Querying an Access database table
To make an external data query to an Access database table, you click the 
From Access command button on the Ribbon’s Data tab or press Alt+AFA. 
Excel opens the Select Data Source dialog box where you select the name of 
the Access database (using an *.accb file extension) and then click Open. 
The Select Table dialog box appears from which you can select the data table 
that you want to import into the worksheet. After you select the data table 
and click OK in this dialog box, the Import Data dialog box appears. 
The Import Data dialog box contains the following options:
 
✓ Table to have the data in the Access data table imported into an Excel 
table in either the current or new worksheet — see Existing Worksheet 
and New Worksheet entries that follow
 
✓ PivotTable Report to have the data in the Access data table imported 
into a new pivot table (see Chapter 9) that you can construct with the 
Access data

341
 Chapter 11: Getting on the Data List
 
✓ PivotChart and PivotTable Report to have the data in the Access data 
table imported into a new pivot table (see Chapter 9) with an embedded 
pivot chart that you can construct with the Access data
 
✓ Only Create Connection to link to the data in the selected Access data 
table without bringing its data into the Excel worksheet
 
✓ Existing Worksheet (default) to have the data in the Access data table 
imported into the current worksheet starting at the current cell address 
listed in the text box below
 
✓ New Worksheet to have the data in the Access data table imported into 
a new sheet that’s added to the beginning of the workbook
Figure 11-13 shows you an Excel worksheet after importing the Invoices 
data table from the sample Northwind Access database as a new data table 
in Excel. After importing the data, you can then use the AutoFilter buttons 
attached to the various fields to sort and filter the data (as described earlier 
in this chapter).

342
Part V: Life beyond the Spreadsheet 
 
Excel keeps a list of all the external data queries you make so that you can 
reuse them to import updated data from another database or Web page. To 
reuse a query, click the Existing Connections button on the Data tab (Alt+AX) 
to open the Existing Connections dialog box to access this list and then click 
the name of the query to repeat.
 
Databases created and maintained with Microsoft Office Access are not, of 
course, the only external data sources on which you can perform external 
data queries. To import data from other sources, you click the From Other 
Sources button on the Data tab or press Alt+AFO to open a drop-down menu 
with the following options:
 
✓ From SQL Server to import data from an SQL Server table
 
✓ From Analysis Services to import data from an SQL Server Analysis 
cube
 
✓ From XML Data Import to import data from an XML file that you open 
and map
 
✓ From Data Connection Wizard to import data from a database table 
using the Data Connection Wizard and OLEDB (Object Linking and 
Embedding Database)
 
✓ From Microsoft Query to import data from a database table using 
Microsoft Query and ODBC (Open Database Connectivity)
 
For specific help with importing data using these various sources, see my 
Excel 2010 All-In-One Desk Reference For Dummies.
Performing a New Web query
To make a Web page query, you click the From Web command button on 
the Data tab of the Ribbon or press Alt+AFW. Excel then opens the New Web 
Query dialog box containing the Home page for your computer’s default Web 
browser (Internet Explorer 8 in most cases). To select the Web page contain-
ing the data you want to import into Excel, you can:
 
✓ Type the URL Web address in the Address text box at the top of the 
Home page in the New Web Query dialog box.
 
✓ Use the Search feature offered on the Home page or its links to find the 
Web page containing the data you wish to import.
When you have the Web page containing the data you want to import dis-
played in the New Web Query dialog box, Excel indicates which tables of 

343
 Chapter 11: Getting on the Data List
information you can import from the Web page into the worksheet by adding 
a yellow box with an arrowhead pointing right. To import these tables, you 
simply click this box to add a check mark to it (see Figure 11-14).
After you finish checking all the tables you want to import on the page, click 
the Import button to close the New Web Query dialog box. Excel then opens 
a version of the Import Data dialog box with only the Table option available 
where you can indicate where the table data is to be imported by selecting 
one of these options:
 
✓ Existing Worksheet (default) to have the data in the Access data table 
imported into the current worksheet starting at the current cell address 
listed in the text box
 
✓ New Worksheet to have the data in the Access data table imported into 
a new sheet that’s added to the beginning of the workbook
After you click OK in the Import Data dialog box, Excel closes the dialog box 
and then imports all the tables of data you selected on the Web page into a 
new worksheet starting at cell A1 or in the existing worksheet starting at the 
cell whose address was entered in the text box in the Import Data dialog box.
Figure 11-15 shows the results of the Web query initiated in the New Web 
Query dialog box shown in Figure 11-14.

Excel brings this data from the Volume Leaders table on the Yahoo! Finance 
Web page into the worksheet as cell ranges rather than as an Excel Table. 
If you then want to be able to sort or filter this imported financial data, you 
need to select one of its cells and then select the Format as Table button on 
the Home tab to format them and add the requisite AutoFilter buttons (see 
Chapter 3 for details). When formatting data as a table, you remove all exter-
nal connections to the data on the Web site.
 
You can make Web queries only when your computer has Internet access. 
Therefore, if you’re using Excel on a laptop computer and can’t connect to the 
Web, you won’t be able to perform a new Web query until you’re in a place 
where you can connect.

Web pages, or e-mail
▶ Creating and using macros to automate common spreadsheet tasks
▶ Sharing your worksheets on the Web

A
t your first reading of the chapter title, you might have the impression 
that this is just a catch-all, potpourri chapter, containing the last bits of 
program information that don’t fit anywhere else in the book. Actually, how-
ever, this is not the case as this chapter has a very definite theme, and that 
theme is how you go about extending the power of Excel.
It just so happens that add-ins, hyperlinks, and macros are three major ways 
to make Excel more vigorous and versatile: add-ins through the extra features 
they give Excel 2010; hyperlinks through links to other worksheets and Office 
documents; and Web pages and macros through complex automated com-
mand sequences that you can play back whenever needed. And sharing your 
worksheets by attaching them to e-mail messages or publishing them to the 
Web as well as being able to edit them anywhere in the world using the new 
online Excel Web application are all part of the new collaboration features that 
enable you to both communicate and collaborate more quickly and effectively.

346
Part V: Life beyond the Spreadsheet 
Using Add-Ins in Excel 2010
Add-in programs are small modules that extend the power of Excel by giving 
you access to a wide array of features and calculating functions not other-
wise offered in the program. There are three types of add-ins: 
 
✓ Built-in add-ins available when you install Excel 2010
 
✓ Add-ins that you can download for Excel 2010 from Microsoft’s Office 
Online Web site (http://www.office.microsoft.com)
 
✓ Add-ins developed by third-party vendors for Excel 2010 that often must 
be purchased
When you first install Excel 2010, the built-in add-in programs included with 
Excel are not loaded and therefore are not yet ready to use. To load any or all 
of these built-in add-in programs, you follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Options or press Alt+FI to open the Excel Options dialog 
box and then click the Add-Ins tab.
 
 The Add-Ins tab lists the name, location, and type of add-ins you have 
access to.
 
2. Click the Go button while Excel Add-Ins is selected in the Manage 
drop-down list box.
 
 Excel opens the Add-Ins dialog box (similar to the one shown in Figure 
12-1) showing all the names of the built-in add-in programs you can load.
 
3. Click the check boxes for each add-in program that you want loaded 
in the Add-Ins Available list box.
 
 Click the name of the add-in in the Add-Ins Available list box to display a 
brief description of its function at the bottom of this dialog box.
 
Figure 12-1: 
Activating 
built-in 
add-ins in 
the Add-Ins 
dialog box.
 

347
 Chapter 12: Linking, Automating, and Sharing Spreadsheets
 
4. Click the OK button to close the Add-Ins dialog box.
 
 An alert dialog box may appear, asking whether you want to install each 
selected add-in. 
 
5. Click the OK button in each alert dialog box to install its add-in.
After activating add-ins in this manner, Excel automatically places command 
buttons for the add-ins in either an Analysis group on the Ribbon’s Data tab 
or in a Solutions group on the Formulas tab, depending upon the type of add-
in. For example, when you activate the Analysis ToolPak or Solver add-in, 
Excel places their command buttons in the Analysis group on the Data tab. 
When you activate the Euro Currency Tools, Excel places its command but-
tons in the Solutions group on the Formulas tab.
 
If you end up never using a particular add-in you’ve loaded, you can unload 
it (and thereby free up some computer memory) by following the previously 
outlined procedure to open the Add-Ins dialog box and then clicking the name 
of the add-in to remove the check mark from its check box. Then click OK.
Adding Hyperlinks to a Worksheet
Hyperlinks automate Excel worksheets by making the opening of other Office 
documents and Excel workbooks and worksheets just a mouse click away. It 
doesn’t matter whether these documents are located on your hard drive, a 
server on your LAN (Local Area Network), or Web pages on the Internet or a 
company’s intranet. You can also set up e-mail hyperlinks that automatically 
address messages to co-workers with whom you routinely correspond, and you 
can attach Excel workbooks or other types of Office files to these messages.
The hyperlinks that you add to your Excel worksheets can be of the following 
types:
 
✓ Text entries in cells (known as hypertext, normally formatted as under-
lined blue text)
 
✓ Clip art and imported graphics from files you’ve inserted into the work-
sheet (see Chapter 10)
 
✓ Graphics you’ve created from the Shapes drop-down gallery on the 
Insert tab (see also Chapter 10) — in effect, turning the graphic images 
into buttons
When creating a text or graphic hyperlink, you can make a link to another 
Excel workbook or other type of Office file, a Web site address (using the URL 
address — you know, that monstrosity that begins with http://), a named 
location in the same workbook, or even a person’s e-mail address. The named 
location can be a cell reference or named cell range (see Chapter 6 for details 
on naming cell ranges) in a particular worksheet.

348
Part V: Life beyond the Spreadsheet 
To add the hyperlink to the text entry made in the current cell or a selected 
graphic object (see Chapter 10) in your worksheet, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Hyperlink button on the Ribbon’s Insert tab or press Alt+NI, 
or simply press Ctrl+K.
 
 Excel opens the Insert Hyperlink dialog box (similar to the one shown in 
Figure 12-2) in which you indicate the file, the Web address (URL), or the 
named location in the workbook.
 
Figure 12-2: 
Linking to a 
Web page 
in the Insert 
Hyperlink 
dialog box.
 
 
2a. To have the hyperlink open another document, a Web page on a com-
pany’s intranet, or a Web site on the Internet, click the Existing File 
or Web Page button if it isn’t already selected and then enter the file’s 
directory path or Web page’s URL in the Address text box.
 
 If the document you want to link to is located on your hard drive or a 
hard drive that is mapped on your computer, click the Look In drop-
down button, select the folder, and then select the file in the list box. If 
you’ve recently opened the document you want to link to, you can click 
the Recent Files button and then select it from the list box.
 
 If the document you want to link to is located on a Web site and you 
know its Web address (the www.dummies.com–like thing), you can type 
it into the Address text box. If you recently browsed the Web page you 
want to link to, you can click the Browsed Pages button and then select 
the address of the page from the list box.
 
2b. To have the hyperlink move the cell cursor to another cell or cell 
range in the same workbook, click the Place in This Document button. 
Next, type the address of the cell or cell range in the Type the Cell 
Reference text box or select the desired sheet name or range name 
from the Or Select a Place in This Document list box (shown in 
Figure 12-3).

2c. To open a new e-mail message addressed to a particular recipient, 
click the E-mail Address button and then enter the recipient’s e-mail 
address in the E-mail Address text box (as shown in Figure 12-4).
 
Figure 12-4:

 In most cases, your e-mail program is Windows Live Mail on Windows 7, 
Windows Mail on Vista, or Outlook Express on Windows XP or Microsoft 
Outlook 2010 if you purchased a version of Microsoft Office 2010 that 
includes this personal information manager plus e-mail program.
 
 As soon as you begin typing the e-mail address in the E-mail Address 
text box, Excel inserts the text mailto: in front of whatever you’ve 
typed. (mailto: is the HTML tag that tells Excel to open your e-mail 
program when you click the hyperlink.)
 
 If you want the hyperlink to add the subject of the e-mail message when 
it opens a new message in your e-mail program, enter this text in the 
Subject text box.

350
Part V: Life beyond the Spreadsheet 
 
 If the recipient’s address is displayed in the Recently Used E-mail 
Addresses list box, you can enter it into the E-mail Address text box 
simply by clicking the address.
 
3. (Optional) To change the hyperlink text that appears in the cell of the 
worksheet (underlined and in blue) or add text if the cell is blank, 
type the desired label in the Text to Display text box.
 
4. (Optional) To add a ScreenTip to the hyperlink that appears when you 
position the mouse pointer over the hyperlink, click the ScreenTip 
button, type the text that you want to appear next to the mouse 
pointer in the ScreenTip box, and then click OK.
 
5. Click OK to close the Insert Hyperlink dialog box.
After you create a hyperlink in a worksheet, you can follow it to whatever 
destination you associated with the hyperlink. To follow a hyperlink, position 
the mouse pointer over the underlined blue text (if you assigned the hyper-
link to text in a cell) or over the graphic image (if you assigned the hyperlink 
to a graphic inserted in the worksheet). When the mouse pointer changes to 
a hand with the index finger pointing upward, click the hypertext or graphic 
image, and Excel makes the jump to the designated external document, Web 
page, cell within the workbook, or e-mail message. 
 
After you follow a hypertext link to its destination, the color of its text changes 
from the traditional blue to a dark shade of purple (without affecting its under-
lining). This color change indicates that the hyperlink has been used. (Note, 
however, that graphic hyperlinks do not show any change in color after you 
follow them.) Additionally, Excel restores this underlined text to its original 
(unfollowed) blue color the next time that you open the workbook file.
 
If you need to edit a hyperlink attached to a worksheet cell or graphic object, 
you must be careful that, when getting Excel into Edit mode so that you can 
change the text, you don’t inadvertently follow the link. When dealing with 
hypertext in a cell, you need to click and hold down the mouse button a few 
seconds to select the cell (if you click and release immediately, you follow the 
link) or click Hyperlink on the Insert tab. When dealing with a graphic object 
you’re best off right-clicking the image and then clicking the appropriate edit-
ing command (Edit Hyperlink or Remove Hyperlink) on its shortcut menu.
Automating Commands with Macros
Macros automate the Excel worksheet by enabling you to record complex 
command sequences. By using macros that perform routine tasks, you not 
only speed up the procedure considerably (because Excel can play back your 

351
 Chapter 12: Linking, Automating, and Sharing Spreadsheets
keystrokes and mouse actions much faster than you can perform them manu-
ally), but you are also assured that each step in the task is carried out the 
same way every time you perform the task.
 
Excel 2010’s macro recorder records all the commands and keystrokes that 
you make in a language called Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), which is a 
special version of the BASIC programming language developed and refined by 
the good folks at Microsoft for use with all their Office application programs. 
You can then later learn how to use Excel’s Visual Basic Editor to display and 
make changes to the macro’s VBA code.
Recording new macros
Excel 2010 enables you to add an optional Developer tab to the Ribbon that 
contains its own Record Macro command button (among other command 
buttons that are very useful when doing more advanced work with macros). 
To add the Developer tab to the Excel 2010 Ribbon, follow these two steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Options or press Alt+FI to open the Excel Options 
dialog box.
 
2. Click the Customize Ribbon tab, select the Developer check box under 
Main Tabs in the Customize the Ribbon list box on the right side of 
the dialog box, and then click OK.
Even if you don’t add the Developer tab to the Ribbon, the Excel Status bar 
at the bottom of the Excel 2010 program window contains a Record Macro 
button (the button with the worksheet with a red dot to the immediate right 
of the Ready status indicator). You click this button to turn on the macro 
recorder. Also, the View tab contains a Macros command button with a drop-
down menu containing a Record Macro option.
When you turn on the macro recorder either by clicking the Record Macro 
button on the Status bar, clicking the Record Macro option on the Macros 
button’s drop-down menu (Alt+WMR), or clicking the Record Macro button 
on the Developer tab (Alt+LR), the macro recorder records all your actions in 
the active worksheet or chart sheet when you make them.
 
The macro recorder doesn’t record the keystrokes or mouse actions that you 
take to accomplish an action — only the VBA code required to perform the 
action itself. This means that mistakes that you make while taking an action 
that you rectify won’t be recorded as part of the macro; for example, if you 
make a typing error and then edit it while the macro recorder is on, only the 
corrected entry shows up in the macro without the original mistakes and 
steps taken to remedy them. 

352
Part V: Life beyond the Spreadsheet 
The macros that you create with the macro recorder can be stored as part 
of the current workbook, in a new workbook, or in a special, globally avail-
able Personal Macro Workbook named PERSONAL.XLSB that’s stored in a 
folder called XLSTART on your hard drive. When you record a macro as part 
of your Personal Macro Workbook, you can run that macro from any work-
book that you have open. (This is because the PERSONAL.XLSB workbook is 
secretly opened whenever you launch Excel, and although it remains hidden, 
its macros are always available.) When you record macros as part of the cur-
rent workbook or a new workbook, you can run those macros only when the 
workbook in which they were recorded is open in Excel.
When you create a macro with the macro recorder, you decide not only the 
workbook in which to store the macro but also what name and shortcut 
keystrokes to assign to the macro that you are creating. When assigning a 
name for your macro, use the same guidelines that you use when you assign 
a standard range name to a cell range in your worksheet. When assigning a 
shortcut keystroke to run the macro, you can assign 
 
✓ The Ctrl key plus a letter from A to Z, as in Ctrl+Q
 
✓ Ctrl+Shift and a letter from A to Z, as in Ctrl+Shift+Q
You can’t, however, assign the Ctrl key plus a punctuation or number key 
(such as Ctrl+1 or Ctrl+/ ) to your macro.
To see how easy it is to create a macro with the macro recorder, follow these 
steps for creating a macro that enters the Company Name in 12-point, bold 
type and centers the company name across rows A through E with the Merge 
and Center feature:
 
1. Open the Excel workbook that contains the worksheet data or chart 
you want your macro to work with.
 
 If you’re building a macro that adds new data to a worksheet (as in this 
example), open a worksheet with plenty of blank cells in which to add 
the data. If you’re building a macro that needs to be in a particular cell 
when its steps are played back, put the cell pointer in that cell.
 
2. Click the Record Macro button on the Status bar.
 
 The Record Macro dialog box opens, similar to the one shown in Figure 
12-5, where you enter the macro name, define any keystroke shortcut, 
select the workbook in which to store the macro, and enter a descrip-
tion of the macro’s function.
 
3. Replace the Macro1 temporary macro name by entering your name 
for the macro in the Macro Name text box.
 
 Remember that when naming a macro, you must not use spaces in the 
macro name and it must begin with a letter and not some number or 
punctuation symbol. For this example macro, you replace Macro1 in the 
Macro Name text box with the name Company_Name.

 Chapter 12: Linking, Automating, and Sharing Spreadsheets
 
 Next, you can enter a letter between A and Z that acts like a shortcut key 
for running the macro when you press Ctrl followed by that letter key. 
Just remember that Excel has already assigned a number of Ctrl+letter 
keystroke shortcuts for doing common tasks, such as Ctrl+C for copying 
an item to the Clipboard and Ctrl+V for pasting an item from the 
Clipboard into the worksheet (see the Cheat Sheet online at www.
dummies.com/cheatsheet/excel2010 for a complete list). If you 
assign the same keystrokes to the macro you’re building, your macro’s 
shortcut keys override and, therefore, disable Excel’s ready-made short-
cut keystrokes. 
 
Figure 12-5: 
Defining the 
new macro 
to record in 
the Record 
Macro 
dialog box.
 
 
4. (Optional) Click the Shortcut key text box and then enter the letter of 
the alphabet that you want to assign to the macro.
 
 For this example macro, press Shift+C to assign Ctrl+Shift+C as the short-
cut keystroke (so as not to disable the ready-made Ctrl+C shortcut).
 
 Next, you need to decide where to save the new macro that you’re 
building. Select Personal Macro Workbook on the Store Macro In drop-
down list box to be able to run the macro anytime you like. Select This 
Workbook (the default) when you need to run the macro only when the 
current workbook is open. Select New Workbook if you want to open a 
new workbook in which to record and save the new macro.
 
5. Click the Personal Macro Workbook, New Workbook, or This 
Workbook option on the Store Macro In drop-down list to indicate 
where to store the new macro.
 
 For this example macro, select the Personal Macro Workbook so that 
you can use it to enter the company name in any Excel workbook that 
you create or edit.
 
 Next, you should document the purpose and function of your macro 
in the Description list box. Although this step is purely optional, it is a 
good idea to get in the habit of recording this information every time 
you build a new macro so that you and your co-workers can always 
know what to expect from the macro it’s run.

354
Part V: Life beyond the Spreadsheet 
 
6. (Optional) Click the Description list box and then insert a brief 
description of the macro’s purpose in front of the information indicat-
ing the date and who recorded the macro.
 
 Now you’re ready to close the Record Macro dialog box and start 
recording your macro.
 
7. Click OK to close the Record Macro dialog box.
 
 The Record Macro dialog box closes and the circular red Record Macro 
button on the Status bar and the Developer tab becomes a square blue 
Stop Recording button. 
 
 On the Macros button’s drop-down menu on the Ribbon’s View tab and 
Code group on the Developer tab, you find a Use Relative References 
option. You click this drop-down menu item or command button when 
you want the macro recorder to record the macro relative to the posi-
tion of the current cell. For this example macro, which enters the 
company name and formats it in the worksheet, you definitely need to 
click the Use Relative References button before you start recording com-
mands. Otherwise, you can use the macro only to enter the company 
name starting in cell A1 of a worksheet.
 
8. (Optional) Click the Use Relative References option on the Macros 
button’s drop-down menu on the View tab or click the Use Relative 
References button on the Developer tab if you want to be able to play 
back the macro anywhere in the worksheet.
 
9. Select the cells, enter the data, and choose the Excel commands 
required to perform the tasks that you want recorded just as you nor-
mally would in creating or editing the current worksheet, using the 
keyboard, the mouse, or a combination of the two.
 
 For the example macro, you type the company name and click the Enter 
button on the Formula bar to complete the entry in the current cell. 
Next, click the Bold button and then click 12 on the Font Size drop-down 
list in the Font group on the Home tab. Finally, drag through cells A1:E1 
to select this range and then click the Merge and Center command 
button, again on the Home tab.
 
 After you finish taking all the actions in Excel that you want recorded, 
you’re ready to shut off the macro recorder.
 
10. Click the Stop Recording button on the Status bar or Developer tab on 
the Ribbon.
 
 The square blue Stop Recording button on the Status bar and the 
Developer tab change back into circular red Record Macro buttons, let-
ting you know that the macro recorder is now turned off and no further 
actions will be recorded.

355
 Chapter 12: Linking, Automating, and Sharing Spreadsheets
Running macros
After you record a macro, you can run it by clicking the View Macros option 
on the Macros button’s drop-down menu on the View tab, the Macros button 
on the Developer tab of the Ribbon, or by pressing Alt+F8 to open the Macro 
dialog box (see Figure 12-6). As this figure shows, Excel lists the names of all 
the macros in the current workbook and in your Personal Macro Workbook 
(provided you’ve created one) in the Macro Name list box. Simply click the 
name of the macro that you want to run and then click the Run button or 
press Enter to play back all its commands.
 
Figure 12-6: 
Selecting 
a macro to 
playback in 
the Macro 
dialog box.
 
 
If you assigned a shortcut keystroke to the macro, you don’t have to bother 
opening the Macro dialog box to run the macro: Simply press Ctrl plus the 
letter key or Ctrl+Shift plus the letter key that you assigned and Excel immedi-
ately plays back all the commands that you recorded.
 
The reason that macros you record in the Personal Macro Workbook are 
always available in any Excel workbook is because the PERSONAL.XLSB work-
book is also open — you just don’t know it because Excel hides this workbook 
immediately after opening it each time you launch the program. As a result, if 
you try to edit or delete a macro in the Macro dialog box saved in the Personal 
Macro Workbook, Excel displays an alert dialog box telling you that you can’t 
edit a hidden workbook.
To unhide the Personal Macro Workbook, first clear the alert dialog box and 
close the Macro dialog box; then click the Unhide button on the View tab 
(Alt+WU) and click the OK button in the Unhide dialog box while PERSONAL.

356
Part V: Life beyond the Spreadsheet 
XLSB is selected. Excel then makes the Personal Macro Workbook active, 
and you can open the Macro dialog box and edit or delete any macros you’ve 
saved in it. After you finish, close the Macro dialog box and then click the 
Hide button on the View tab (or press Alt+WH) to hide the Personal Macro 
Workbook once more.
Assigning macros to the Ribbon 
and the Quick Access toolbar
If you prefer, instead of running a macro by selecting it in the Macro dialog 
box or by pressing shortcut keys you assign to it, you can assign it to a 
custom tab on the Ribbon or a custom button on the Quick Access toolbar 
and then run it by clicking that custom button.
To assign a macro to a custom group on a custom Ribbon tab, you follow 
these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Options and then click the Customize Ribbon tab in the 
Excel Options dialog box (or press Alt+FIC).
 
 Excel displays the Customize Ribbon pane in the Excel Options 
dialog box.
 
2. Click Macros in the Choose Commands From drop-down list box on 
the left.
 
 Excel lists the names of all the macros created in the current workbook 
and saved in the PERSONAL.XLSB workbook in the Choose Commands 
From list box.
 
3. Click the name of the custom group on the custom tab to which you 
want to add the macro in the Main Tabs list box on the right.
 
 If you haven’t already created a custom tab and group for the macro or 
need to create a new one, follow these steps:
 
a. Click the New Tab button at the bottom of the Main Tabs list.
 
 Excel adds both a New Tab (Custom) and New Group (Custom) 
item to the Main Tabs list while at the same time selecting the New 
Group (Custom) item.
 
b. Click the New Tab (Custom) item you just added to the Main Tabs.
 
c. Click the Rename button at the bottom of the Main Tabs list box and 
then type a display name for the new custom tab before you click OK.
 
d. Click the New Group (Custom) item right below the custom tab you 
just renamed.
 
e. Click the Rename button and then type a display name for the new 
custom group before you click OK.

357
 Chapter 12: Linking, Automating, and Sharing Spreadsheets
 
4. In the Choose Commands From list box on the left, click the name of 
the macro you want to add to the custom group now selected in the 
Main Tabs list box on the right.
 
5. Click the Add button to add the selected macro to the selected custom 
group on your custom tab and then click the OK button to close the 
Excel Options dialog box.
After you add a macro to the custom group of a custom tab, the name of the 
macro appears on a button sporting a generic icon (a programming diagram 
chart) on the custom tab of the Ribbon. Then, all you have to do to run the 
macro is click this command button.
To assign a macro to a custom button on the Quick Access toolbar, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Click the Customize Quick Access Toolbar button at the end of the 
Quick Access toolbar and then click More Commands on its drop-
down menu.
 
 Excel opens the Excel Options dialog box with the Quick Access Toolbar 
tab selected.
 
2. Click Macros in the Choose Commands From drop-down list box.
 
 Excel lists the names of all the macros created in the current workbook 
and saved in the PERSONAL.XLSB workbook in the Choose Commands 
From list box.
 
3. Click the name of the macro to add to a custom button on the Quick 
Access toolbar in the Choose Commands From list box and then click 
the Add button.
 
4. Click OK to close the Excel Options dialog box.
After you close the Excel Options dialog box, a custom button sporting a 
generic macro icon (picturing a standard command flowchart) appears on 
the Quick Access toolbar. You can choose a different icon by clicking the 
Rename button below the Customize the Ribbon box. To see the name of the 
macro assigned to this custom macro button as a ScreenTip, position the 
mouse pointer over the button. To run the macro, click the button.
Figure 12-7 shows the Quick Access toolbar and Excel Ribbon after adding a 
custom button that runs the Company_Name macro described earlier in this 
chapter. I added the custom button that runs this macro to the end of the 
Quick Access toolbar and to a custom group named Simple Macros, which I 
added to a custom Ribbon tab named Macros.

Sharing Worksheets
Excel 2010 makes it easy to share your spreadsheets with trusted clients 
and co-workers. You can use the Save & Send panel in Backstage View to 
e-mail workbooks to others who have access to Excel on their computers. 
If you have access to a collaborative online Web site, such as a Microsoft 
SharePoint Web site or use Excel Services, you can save your workbooks to 
these Web resources from this panel. 
If you maintain a Windows Live SkyDrive storage site, you can share and 
access your spreadsheets online by logging on to this site and then uploading 
copies of your workbook files to this Internet location. Additionally, you can 
review or edit the workbooks you save on your SkyDrive when you’re away 
from your office and the computer to which you have access doesn’t have a 
compatible version of Excel installed on it. You simply use that computer’s 
Internet access to log on to the My Documents folder of your SkyDrive con-
taining uploaded copies of your spreadsheets, and then use the brand new 
Excel Web App (that runs on most modern Web browsers) to open and then 
review and edit them.
Sending a workbook via e-mail
To e-mail one of your workbooks to a client or co-worker, choose 
File➪Share➪Send Using E-Mail (Alt+FHE). When you do this, a Send Using 
E-Mail panel appears with the following five options:
 
✓ Send as Attachment to create a new e-mail message using your default 
e-mail program with a copy of the workbook file as its attachment file.
 
✓ Send a Link to create a new e-mail message using your default e-mail 
program that contains a hyperlink to the workbook file. (This option is 
available only when the workbook file is saved on your company’s or 
ISP’s Web server.)

359
 Chapter 12: Linking, Automating, and Sharing Spreadsheets
 
✓ Send as PDF to convert the Excel workbook to the Adobe PDF (Portable 
Document File) format and make this new PDF the attachment file in 
a new e-mail message. (Your e-mail recipient must have a copy of the 
Adobe Reader installed on his or her computer in order to open the 
attachment.)
 
✓ Send as XPS to convert the Excel workbook to a Microsoft XPS (XML 
Paper Specification) file and make this new XPS file the attachment in 
a new e-mail message. (Your e-mail recipient must have an XPS Reader 
installed on his or her computer in order to open the attachment; this 
reader is installed automatically on computers running Windows 7 or 
Windows Vista.)
 
✓ Send as Internet Fax to send the workbook as a fax through an online 
fax service provider. You will need an account with a service provider as 
well as the Windows Fax and Scan Windows feature installed. 
After selecting the e-mail option you want to use, Windows opens a new 
e-mail message in your e-mail program with a link to the workbook file or the 
file attached to it. To send the link or file, fill in the recipient’s e-mail address 
in the To text box and any comments you want to make about the spread-
sheet in the body of the message before you click the Send button.
Sharing a workbook on a 
SharePoint Web site
If your company maintains a SharePoint site to facilitate different kinds of 
online team collaboration, you can save the workbooks to which various 
teams need access directly on this special Web site. When saving a workbook 
to a SharePoint site, you can save a static copy so that the teams can simply 
review and refer to its data or you can save a more dynamic copy (using 
Microsoft’s Excel Services server technology) that enables teams to make 
changes and do certain types of online analysis in their Web browsers.
To save a static copy of your workbook, choose File➪Share➪Save to 
SharePoint and then click the Save to SharePoint button. To save a more 
dynamic and calculable copy of the workbook, choose File➪Share➪Publish 
to Excel Services and then click the Publish to Excel Services command 
button. In either case, Excel opens the Save As dialog box where you replace 
the suggested filename in the File Name text box with the URL of your 
SharePoint site before you click the Save button.

360
Part V: Life beyond the Spreadsheet 
Excel then connects to your SharePoint site (on some systems, after prompt-
ing you for your User Name and password, if the site is hosted) and dis-
plays the Site Content page in the Save As dialog box. You then select the 
SharePoint document library, sub-site, or workspace in which to save the 
workbook by double-clicking its icon or clicking the item and then clicking 
the Open button. When you click the Save button after selecting the location, 
Excel saves a copy of the workbook directly on the SharePoint server.
Uploading workbooks to your SkyDrive 
and editing them with the Excel Web App
Microsoft offers several free online apps and services as part of its Windows 
Live Essentials suite. And if you maintain a SkyDrive (the file storage and 
sharing component of Windows Live; the first 25 GB of storage is free), you 
can easily upload copies of your Excel workbooks to this drive for sharing.
 
1. Choose File➪Share➪Save to SkyDrive (Alt+FHE). 
 
 The Save to SkyDrive panel displays. Your options are to browse 
to SkyDrive, sign-in with a Windows Live ID, or to sign up for a new 
account.
 
2. Click the Sign In button to sign in with your Windows Live ID.
 
 After you sign in, you can choose to create a new folder or select an 
existing folder.
 
3. Select a shared folder, and then click the Save As button.
 
 Excel contacts the SkyDrive service and then displays the Save As 
dialog.
 
4. Type a name for the workbook and then click Save.
 
 Excel saves the workbook to SkyDrive.
If you maintain copies of your spreadsheets on your SkyDrive, you can give 
other clients and co-workers access to them (using their Windows Live IDs). 
Additionally, you can edit these worksheets in your Web browser using the 
brand new Excel Web App (part of the Office Web Apps, which also include a 
Word and PowerPoint Web App, all of which are available free to users with 
Windows Live IDs).
 
The great part about using the Excel Web App to edit a copy of your online 
workbook is that this Web App runs successfully under Microsoft’s Internet 
Explorer 8 and under the latest versions of other popular Web browsers, 
including Mozilla Firefox for Windows, Mac, and Linux as well as Macintosh’s 
Safari Web browser.

361
 Chapter 12: Linking, Automating, and Sharing Spreadsheets
To edit a workbook you’ve uploaded to the My Documents folder of your 
SkyDrive, you follow these simple steps:
 
1. Open the My Documents page of your SkyDrive and then click the file 
icon of the workbook you want to edit.
 
 A Web page showing information about the Excel file you selected 
appears.
 
2. Click the Edit link to the immediate right of the View link on the 
command line.
 
 Windows Live then opens the selected workbook in Excel Web App in 
your Web browser (see Figure 12-8 for an example).
 
3. Edit the contents of the cells in the worksheets of the open workbook 
and the workbook’s formatting if necessary (using the tools on the 
Home tab of the Excel Web App Ribbon).
 
 To change the text or number in a cell or to edit its formula on the 
Formula bar, click the cell to make it current and then click in the 
Formula bar. To edit the cell contents within the worksheet, make the 
cell current and press F2.
 
 To modify the layout or formatting of a cell selection, click the appropri-
ate command button in the Font, Alignment, Number, or Cells group on 
the Home tab of the Ribbon.

4. When you finish editing the workbook, save your changes by choos-
ing File➪Save As and then editing the filename that appears in the 
text box of the Save As dialog box before you click Save. (Or click the 
Overwrite Existing Files check box if you want to save the changes 
under the same filename).
 
The Excel Web App is pretty handy when it comes to making simple editing, 
formatting, and layout changes to your spreadsheet data. However, the Web 
App is completely incapable of dealing with any type of changes to charts and 
other types of graphics that you’ve added (even though they do appear in the 
worksheet online). To make these types of modifications to your worksheet, 
you have two choices: Open the workbook in a local copy of Excel (assuming 
that the computer you’re using has Excel 2007 or later installed on it) by click-
ing the Open in Excel button at the end of the Home tab on the Ribbon. Or, 
download a copy of the workbook to your local office computer (where you do 
have Excel 2010 installed) by choosing File➪Download a Copy and make the 
more advanced edits to this downloaded copy of the file once you get back to 
the office.

Part VI
The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
F
inally, you come to the fun part of this book where 
the chapters all consist of lists with the top ten Excel 
2010 tips on this, that, and everything in between. In hom-
age to David Letterman (Indiana’s favorite son), you’ll find 
lists of the top ten features in Excel 2010 and the top ten 
beginner basics. And, in homage to Cecil B. DeMille, 
Moses, and a much higher power, I’ve included a chapter 
with the Ten Commandments of Excel 2010 that, although 
not written in stone, when followed faithfully, are guaran-
teed to give you heavenly results.

Chapter 13
Top Ten Features in Excel 2010
I
f you’re looking for a quick rundown on what’s cool in Excel 2010, look 
no further! Here it is — my official Top Ten Features list. Just a cursory 
glance down the list tells you that the thrust of the features is graphics, 
graphics, graphics!
In case you’re interested in more than just a brief feature description, I’ve 
included a cross-reference to any place in this book where I cover the feature 
in more detail.
 
10. Conditional Formatting & Sparklines: Conditional formatting in Excel 
2010 gives you the ability to define formatting when the values in cells 
meet certain conditions. You can now instantly apply one of many differ-
ent Data Bars, Color Scales, and Icon Sets to the cell selection merely by 
clicking the set’s thumbnail in the respective pop-up palettes. When you 
apply a set of Data Bars to a cell range, the length of each bar in the cell 
represents its value relative to the others. When you apply a set of Color 
Scales, each shade of color in the cell represents its value relative to 
the others. Additionally, when you apply one of the Icon Sets, each icon 
in the cell represents its value relative to the others. See Chapter 3 for 
more on using different types of conditional formatting to add dynamic 
formats to specific sets of worksheet data.
 
 Sparklines are the newest graphic addition to Excel. They are tiny charts 
(so small they fit within the current height of a worksheet cell) that visu-
ally represent changes in ranges of associated data. You can use spar-
klines to call attention to trends in the data as well as to help your users 
quickly spot high and low values. See Chapter 10 for more on how to 
add these exciting new charts to your worksheets.
 
9. Cell Styles: Comparing the six measly and bland cell styles offered in 
versions of Excel prior to 2007 to the more than 40 colorful ready-made 
styles offered in Excel 2010, I’m here to tell you that in Excel 2010 you 
finally have cell styles. Moreover, these are styles you can preview in 
the worksheet with Live Preview (see Number 1 that follows) to see how 
they look on the data before you apply them. You apply a cell style to 
the cell selection by quickly and easily clicking its thumbnail in the Cells 
Styles gallery (see Number 4 in the list). Take a gander at Chapter 3 for 
info on applying ready-made styles and creating some of your own.

366
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
8. Formatting and Editing from the Home tab: The Home tab of the Excel 
Ribbon (see Number 2 that follows) literally brings home all the com-
monly used formatting and editing features. Gone are the days when you 
have to fish for the right button on some long, drawn-out toolbar or on 
some partially deployed pull-down menu. Now all you have to do is find 
the group that holds the command button you need and click it — what 
could be easier! See Chapter 3 for more on using the formatting com-
mand buttons in the Font, Alignment, Number, and Styles groups on the 
Home tab. See Chapter 4 for more on using the editing commands in the 
Clipboard, Cells, and Editing groups on this tab.
 
7. Charts from the Insert tab: Charts have been a part of Excel since I first 
wrote this book for Excel 4 back in 1993. Nonetheless, it feels like charts 
have finally come into their own in Excel 2007/2010. Excel 2010, like its 
immediate predecessor, retires the Chart Wizard and offers you direct 
access to all the major types of charts on the Ribbon’s Insert tab. Simply 
select the data to chart, click the command button for the chart type on 
the Insert tab and then select the style you want for that chart type. And 
with a little help from the many command buttons and galleries on the 
Design, Layout, and Format tabs on its Chart Tools contextual tab, you 
have a really professional-looking chart ready for printing! See Chapter 
10 for details on creating charts in Excel 2010.
 
6. Format As Table: This feature is a real keeper. By formatting a table 
of data with one of the many table styles available on the Table Styles 
drop-down gallery, you’re assured that all new entries made to the table 
are going to be formatted in the same manner as others in similar posi-
tions in the table. Better yet, all new entries to the table are considered 
part of the table automatically when it comes to formatting, sorting, and 
filtering. By the way, filtering the table’s data is easy with the addition of 
filter buttons to the top row of column headings. See Chapter 3 for more 
on formatting a range as a table. See Chapter 11 for more on sorting and 
filtering data.
 
5. Page Layout View: Page Layout View in the Excel worksheet is just what 
the doctor ordered when it comes to visualizing the paging of printed 
reports. When you turn on this view by clicking the Page Layout View 
button on the Status bar, Excel doesn’t just show the page breaks as 
measly dotted lines as in earlier versions but as actual separations. 
Additionally, the program shows the margins for each page, including 
headers and footers defined for the report (which you can both define 
and edit directly in the margin areas while the program is in this view). 
As an extra nice touch, Excel throws in a pair of horizontal and vertical 
rulers to accompany the standard column and row headers. Couple this 
great feature with the Zoom slider and the Page Break Preview feature 
and you’re going to enjoy getting the spreadsheet ready to print. See 
Chapter 5 for details on using Page Layout View and defining headers 
and footers for your printed reports.

367
 Chapter 13: Top Ten Features in Excel 2010
 
4. Style Galleries: Excel 2010 is jammed full of style galleries that make 
it a snap to apply new sophisticated (and, in many cases, very color-
ful) formatting to the charts, tables and lists of data, and various and 
sundry graphics that you add to your worksheets. Coupled with the Live 
Preview feature (see Number 1 in the list), Excel’s style galleries go a 
long way toward encouraging you to create better looking, more color-
ful, and interesting spreadsheets. See Chapter 3 for ideas on how to use 
styles to add real style to your worksheet.
 
3. Document Information and Printing in Backstage View: The brand new 
Backstage View in Excel enables you to get all the properties and stats 
(technically known as metadata) about the workbook file you’re editing 
(including a thumbnail of its contents) on one pane simply by choosing 
File➪Info (Alt+F). This new Backstage View also makes it a breeze to 
preview, change settings, and print your worksheet using its new Print 
panel by choosing File➪Print (Ctrl+P or Alt+FP). See Chapter 1 for more 
on getting at-a-glance information about your document in the Backstage 
View. See Chapter 5 for details on printing the worksheet using the new 
Print panel.
 
2. The Ribbon: The Ribbon is the heart of the new Excel 2010 user inter-
face. Based on a core of standard tabs to which various so-called con-
textual tabs are added as needed in formatting and editing of specific 
elements (such as data tables, charts, pivot tables, and graphic objects), 
the Ribbon brings together most every command you’re going to need 
when performing particular tasks in Excel. Check out Chapter 1 for the 
lowdown on using the Ribbon. 
 
1. Live Preview: You simply can’t say enough about Live Preview, includ-
ing how much easier it makes formatting the worksheet. Live Preview 
works with all the style galleries (see Number 4 in the list) as well as 
Font and Font Size drop-down menus in the Font group on the Home tab. 
It enables you to see how the data in the current cell selection would 
look with a particular formatting, font, or font size before you actually 
apply the formatting to the range. All you have to do is mouse over the 
thumbnails in the drop-down menu or gallery to see how each of its 
styles will look on your actual data. As an extra nice feature, many of 
the larger style galleries sport spinner buttons that enable you to bring 
new rows of thumbnails in the gallery into view so that you can preview 
their styles without obscuring any part of the cell selection (as would be 
the case if you actually open the gallery by clicking its More drop-down 
button). When you finally do see the formatting that fits your data to a 
tee, all you have to do is click its thumbnail to apply it to the selected 
cell range.

of the competition. When all is said and done, this top ten list lays out all 
the fundamental skills required to use Excel 2010 successfully.
 
10. To start Excel 2010 from the Windows 7 or Vista taskbar, click the Start 
button, type exc in the Search Programs and Files text box and then with 
Microsoft Excel 2010 selected in the Programs section, press Enter. To 
start the program from the Windows XP or 2000 taskbar, click the Start 
button, highlight All Programs on the Start menu, and then highlight 
Microsoft Office on the All Programs continuation menu. Finally, click 
Microsoft Office Excel on the Microsoft Office continuation menu.
 
9. To launch Excel 2010 automatically when you open an Excel work-
book that needs editing (in the Documents window in Windows 7 and 
Vista or My Documents window in Windows XP), simply locate the 
folder containing the Excel workbook you want to edit and double-click 
its file icon.
 
8. To locate a part of a worksheet that you cannot see onscreen, click 
the scroll bars at the right and bottom of the workbook window to bring 
new parts of the worksheet into view.
 
7. To start a new workbook (containing three blank worksheets) using 
the Excel default template, simply press Ctrl+N. To open a new work-
book based on another template, choose File➪New or press Alt+FN 
and then select the template to use in the New section of the Backstage 
View, where you can select a template or download one from Office.
com. To add a new worksheet to a workbook (should you need more 
than three), click the Insert Worksheet button to the immediate right of 
the last tab at the bottom of the Worksheet area.
 
6. To activate an open workbook and display it onscreen (in front of 
any others you have open), click the Ribbon’s View tab, then click the 
window to activate in the Switch Windows button’s drop-down menu (or 
press Alt+WW followed by the window’s number). To locate a particular 
worksheet in the active workbook, click that worksheet’s sheet tab at 
the bottom of the workbook document window. To display more sheet 
tabs, click the sheet scrolling arrows on the left side of the bottom of the 
workbook window.

5. To enter stuff in a worksheet, select the cell where the information 
should appear; then begin typing. When you finish, click the Enter 
button on the Formula bar (the one with the check mark) or press Tab, 
Enter, or one of the arrow keys.
 
4. To edit the stuff you entered into a cell already, double-click the cell or 
position the cell pointer in the cell and press F2. Excel then positions the 
insertion point at the end of the cell entry and goes into Edit mode (see 
Chapter 2 for details). When you finish correcting the entry, click the 
Enter button on the Formula bar or press Tab or Enter.
 
3. To choose one of the many Excel commands on the Ribbon, click the 
Ribbon tab, locate the group containing the command button, and then 
click the button. (Or, press the Alt key to display the hot keys on the 
Ribbon and then type the letter of the tab you want to select followed 
by the letter(s) of the command button to use.) To choose a command 
in Backstage View, choose File and then click its menu option or press 
Alt+F followed by the option’s hot key letter. To choose a command on 
the Quick Access toolbar, click its command button.
 
2. To save a copy of your workbook on disk the first time around, click 
the Save button on the Quick Access toolbar or press Ctrl+S. Next, des-
ignate the drive and folder directory where the file should be located, 
replace the temporary Book1.xlsx filename in the File Name text box 
with your own filename (up to 255 characters long, including spaces), 
and then click the Save button. To save a workbook so that older ver-
sions of Excel can open it, click the Save As option on the File tab, then 
click the Excel 97-2003 Workbook (*.xls) option in the Save as Type 
drop-down menu.
 
1. To exit Excel when you’re done working with the program, choose 
File➪Exit or press Alt+F4 or Alt+FX. If the workbook you have open con-
tains unsaved changes, Excel 2010 asks whether you want to save the 
workbook before closing Excel and returning to Windows. Before you 
shut off your computer, be sure to use the Shut Down command on the 
Start menu to shut down the Windows operating system.

Chapter 15
The Ten Commandments 
of Excel 2010
W
hen working with Excel 2010, you discover certain do’s and don’ts 
that, if followed religiously, can make using this program just heav-
enly. Lo and behold, the following Excel Ten Commandments contain just 
such precepts for eternal Excel bliss.
 
10. Thou shalt commit thy work to disk by saving thy changes often (click-
eth the Save button on the Quick Access toolbar or presseth Ctrl+S). If 
thou findest that thou tendeth to be lax in the saving of thy work, thou 
shalt maketh sure that thy AutoRecover feature is engaged. Chooseth 
File➪Options➪Save or presseth Alt+FIS and then maketh sure that the 
Save AutoRecover Information check box hath a check mark and that its 
text box is set to no more than 10 minutes.
 
9. Thou shalt nameth thy workbooks when saving them the first time with 
filenames of no more than twelve score and fifteen characters (255), 
including spaces and all manner of weird signs and symbols. So, too, 
thou shalt mark well into which folder thou savest thy file lest thou 
thinkest in error that thy workbook be lost when next thou hast need 
of it.
 
8. Thou shalt not spread wide the data in thy worksheet, but rather thou 
shalt gather together thy tables and avoideth skipping columns and 
rows unless this is necessary to make thy data intelligible. All this thou 
shalt do in order that thou may conserve the memory of thy computer.
 
7. Thou shalt begin all thy Excel 2010 formulas with = (equal) as the sign 
of computation. If, however, ye be formerly of the Lotus 1-2-3 tribe, thou 
shalt haveth special dispensation and can commence thy formulas with 
the + sign and thy functions with the @ sign.
 
6. Thou shalt select thy cells before thou bringeth any Excel command to 
bear upon them, just as surely as thou doth sow before thou reapeth.

372
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
5. Thou shalt useth the Undo feature (clicketh the Undo button on the 
Quick Access toolbar or presseth Ctrl+Z) immediately upon commit-
ting any transgression in thy worksheet so that thou mayest clean up 
thy mess. Should thou forgeteth to useth thy Undo feature straightaway, 
thou must select the action that thou wouldst undo from the pop-up 
menu attached to the Undo command button on the Quick Access tool-
bar. Note well that any action that thou selectest from this drop-down 
list will undo not only that action but also the actions that precedeth it 
on this menu.
 
4. Thou shalt not delete, nor insert, columns and rows in a worksheet 
lest thou hath first verified that no part yet undisplayed of thy work-
sheet will thereby be wiped out or otherwise displaced.
 
3. Thou shalt not print thy spreadsheet report lest thou hath first pre-
viewed its pages by clicking the Page Layout View button (the middle 
button of the three to the immediate left of the Zoom Slider on the 
Status bar) and art satisfied that all thy pages are upright in the sight of 
the printer. If thou art still unsure of how thy pages break, clicketh the 
Page Break Preview button to its immediate right on the Status bar to 
seeth how Excel doth divide thy pages.
 
2. Thou shalt changeth the manner of recalculation of thy work-
books from automatic to manual (clicketh Formulas➪Calculation 
Options➪Manual or presseth Alt+MXM) when thy workbook groweth so 
great in size that Excel sloweth down to a camel crawl whenever thou 
doeth anything in any one of its worksheets. Woe to thee, should thou 
then ignoreth the Calculate message on the Status bar and not presseth 
the Calculate Now key (F9) or clicketh Formulas➪Calculate Now before 
such time as thou mayest print any of thy workbook data.
 
1. Thou shalt protecteth thy completed workbook and all its work-
sheets from corruption and iniquities at the hands of others (clicketh 
Review➪Protect Sheet or Protect Workbook). And if thou be brazen 
enough to addeth a password to thy workbook protection, beware lest 
thou forgeteth thy password in any part. For verily I say unto thee, on 
the day that thou knowest not thy password, that day shalt be the last 
upon which thou lookest upon thy workbook in any guise.
