Preface
Let our advance worrying become advance thinking and planning.
—Winston Churchill
Many of the most successful organizations worldwide have specific program man­
agement templates that they treat as carefully guarded trade secrets and consider 
critical to their consistent success. At this writing, it is difficult to find examples of 
many of the documents referenced in the Project Management Institute’s (PMI•) The 
Standard for Program Management—Third Edition (2013), released December 31, 
2012. When we do find roughly comparable documents here and there, they over­
lap or are intended for specific situations or even atypical definitions of project or 
program management. What is a practitioner supposed to do? What is supposed 
to be in the various documents? How do they complement rather than overlap 
each other?
We first wrote a comparable book in 2010, after the Second Edition of the 
Standard was released. In December 2008. Since there were only a few program 
management books available at that time, our goal was for it to be an attempt to 
lift the shroud of obscurity surrounding such documents. This goal remains today.
While there are more program management books available in 2013, the Third 
Edition of the PMI Standard provides less detail and a different focus than that of 
the Second Edition. We have updated templates and forms in this book to comple­
ment what is included in the Third Edition as well as to include others that we feel 
are best practices to use in managing programs. 
The templates and forms herein are examples to consider for making your next 
programmatic adventure a little less reminiscent of a sequel to Raiders of the Lost 
Ark. We want this book to be a liberating breath of fresh air that breaks the writer’s 
block so commonly encountered in the program management process. We feel it 
will also be extremely valuable to students of program management, who forever 
request “go-by” templates for their work, and rightfully so.

xiv  ◾  Preface
The professions (and we dare say arts) of project and program management are 
moving toward maturity and standards. PMI’s A Guide to the Project Management 
Body of Knowledge—Fifth Edition (2013) and The Standard for Program Management—
Third Edition (2013) are already standards of the American National Standards 
Institute (ANSI). Further, the International Organization for Standardization 
(ISO) effort has been completed as a global standard for project management 
knowledge and processes. PMI had an active role in that effort. Various organiza­
tions worldwide will likely position themselves as consistent with the ISO standard. 
Program and portfolio management are not currently on the ISO radar screen, but 
their standardization would seem a natural next step. 
In this book the best practices we have included must be adapted in multiple 
ways when used on any specific program:
	
1.	For the given industry and industry segment
	
2.	For the culture and practices of a given organization
	
3.	For the preferences of the program manager and program team
	
4.	For the target program and its environment, considering its purpose and scale
That is a lot of adaptation! Program documents are a little like a covered dish 
supper at Grandma’s house in that each planner has unique tastes. 
As just one illustration, consider the Defense Acquisition Guidebook published 
by the U.S. Department of Defense. Accommodating multi-billion-dollar pro­
grams and having complex stakeholder relationships, many consider that program 
management discipline to be completely different. In fact, it has much in common 
with The Standard for Program Management—Third Edition (2013) at its core, and 
several plans herein are valuable elaborations of its prescribed documents.
Many program practitioners may already have commercial off-the-shelf or 
homegrown systems in place that implement some of the concepts we illustrate 
here. We hope this book spurs ideas for improvement of those systems as well.
So it is that your documents will likely look quite different. Bravo!

Introduction
Discipline is the bridge between goals and accomplishment.
—Jim Rohn
This book is a workbook for successful program management. Success in program 
management requires discipline—the kind of discipline that results in repeatability 
of success. It requires appropriately complete plans, well-run meetings with mean­
ingful agendas, accurate record keeping, and general adherence to global best prac­
tices. Toward those ends, this book is a compendium of plans, forms, agendas, 
registers, and procedures.
This work is specifically designed to be compatible with and in a supplemen­
tary to the Project Management Institute’s (PMI•) The Standard for Program 
Management—Third Edition (2013). Starting out to produce artifact prototypes 
for all the documents mentioned therein, we found that the task proved a bit more 
elusive than expected. Some documents are explicitly enumerated in The Standard 
for Program Management—Third Edition (2013), and others are more implicit—so 
we have made judgments as to what to include. We have included almost all of 
the identifiable documents referenced in The Standard for Program Management—
Third Edition (2013). We have also kept some useful ones from prior editions that 
are now omitted. We also added some of our own. In a couple of instances, The 
Standard for Program Management—Third Edition (2013) defers to PMI’s A Guide 
to the Project Management Body of Knowledge—Fifth Edition (PMBOK•), and so 
do we.
This work is not intended to be a complete guide to program management. Nor 
will it be entirely useful as a supplementary study for PMI’s Program Management 
Professional (PgMP•) credential examination. You will need The Standard for 
Program Management—Third Edition (2013), the Examination Content Outline 
or ECO (2011), and some of the other available texts and articles on program man­
agement. We make no assumptions about your level of experience in program man­
agement but accept the fact that you may or may not be new to the discipline.

xx  ◾  Introduction
Our focus is on three heretofore neglected agendas: (1) helping you apply The 
Standard for Program Management—Third Edition (2013) and the other best prac­
tice guidelines included in this book in the successful execution of your program 
on a daily basis, (2) meeting the needs of undergraduate and graduate students at 
the university level and those in short courses in program management who may 
require guidance in their initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and control­
ling, and closing exercises, and (3) serving as a reference book for PgMP aspirants 
with its organization according to the program management domains as specified 
in the ECO.
About Program Management
Although projects have been under way since the time of the pyramids, and project 
management emerged as a profession in the late 1950s and early 1960s, we now 
work in a project-oriented society. However, rather than having only one or two 
large projects under way, organizations have hundreds of projects of various sizes 
and complexities. Organizations began to view projects as assets and started prac­
ticing management by projects.
The emphasis, though, now has shifted to program management.
If projects, and other ongoing work, can be grouped into a program because 
they share common attributes, the organization can then realize more benefits than 
if the projects were managed in a stand-alone fashion, resources can be coordinated 
across projects, customer relationship management is improved, as well as supply 
chain management, and greater effectiveness and efficiencies can result.
Recognizing the increasing use of programs, in 2006, PMI issued a standard on 
program management, which was updated at the end of 2008, and again updated 
at the end of 2012, and published in 2013. This standard describes best practices in 
program management and contains a common set of terms to best communicate 
globally among the various program stakeholders. These best practices are of enor­
mous value, as they show the importance of key documents to initiate a program, 
plan it, execute and monitor and control it, and close it. We now are working in a 
society in which program management is the norm and not the exception and in 
which programs and projects are considered organizational assets. We are manag­
ing by both programs and projects.
Let’s get to work!

Chapter 2
Getting Started
In preparing for battle I have always found that plans are useless, but 
planning is indispensable.
—Dwight D. Eisenhower
Planning is woefully implemented in some programs. On the other hand, in cer­
tain cultures, planning is almost an (endless) end in itself—sort of like the infa­
mous “paralysis by analysis.” Your world needs to be somewhere in between.
An important ­take-­home message here is that, given natural and often tur­
bulent change in a program’s environment, planning in too much detail can be a 
counterproductive drain on your time. Planning in too little detail, however, can 
cause you to overlook things that need to be at least thought through in advance. 
One of the most important program manager skills is the ability to do just the right 
amount of all the right things and at the right time.
If the documents we describe are new to your organization, almost certainly the 
first application will be the most difficult. Major parts of your work will become 
what the Project Management Institute (PMI•) refers to as organizational process 
assets. So if you are in that situation, you will be a pioneer. As they say about pio­
neers, they are the ones with the arrows in their back. That is sort of like us perhaps, 
in even daring such a work as this book.
Why So Many Plans?
The seeming paradox that leads off this chapter actually makes sense! How?
During the often furious pace of a program’s life time, indeed things do change. 
And unmanaged change is your enemy, while considered and managed change is 

4  ◾  Implementing Program Management
your friend. When it occurs, your prior planning work has provided you with an 
understanding of the program and proves invaluable in defining and implementing 
the necessary changes.
In numerous templates that follow, in each phase of the Program Life Cycle 
domain, we begin in each one with a brief statement of its value, followed by a 
detailed description of its contents, and then a template, ready to tailor and use.
Since we have organized this book based on the five domains in the Examination 
Content Outline (ECO), we have included plans that we recommend in benefits, 
stakeholders, and governance in their specific chapters and other templates in this 
book so there are even more templates to consider!
First Steps
As in all endeavors, it is best to take advantage of preexisting assets. As pointed 
out in the preface, your organization is unique. In some cases, you will need only 
to reference existing standard documents for your organization. In other cases, 
you may need to prepare extensive documents using ours as a starting point. And 
in yet other cases, you might only need to include a paragraph as part of another 
document, indicating how due consideration has been given to the matter at hand.
First, consult with your program management office, if available, or senior 
management to get electronic access to any templates, forms, and standards for 
program, quality, financial management, etc., and other plans that you can adapt

of your organization, these items may be fairly easily obtained. If all else fails,

Strategic Program 
Management/­Alignment
Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.
—Seneca
In this phase there is as yet no program—that is, a program charter does not yet 
exist. In fact, the purpose of this phase is to justify the program, usually through 
an approved the business case. A description of the benefits to be achieved, a list 
of preliminary identified stakeholders, and the program’s mission statement are 
produced as well in order to convince the organization’s program selection process 
to accept the effort and to select it as a program rather than as a series of projects.
Our goal is to ensure that our programs not only provide more benefits than 
if the projects and other work within them were managed separately, but also to 
ensure that our programs align to our organization’s strategic objectives. In many 
cases, this alignment sounds easy but in actuality is quite difficult.
While each organization does have a portfolio representing all of the work that 
is under way, one may not know the contents of the portfolio, or how strategic deci­
sions are made to determine whether or not to add a new program or project to the 
portfolio, unless it is a mature organization with a ­well-­defined portfolio manage­
ment process in place. Limited resources make portfolio management an impera­
tive to ensure that the programs and projects that are selected to be part of the 
portfolio are the “right” ones to pursue given the organization’s strategic goals and 
objectives. Later, portfolio management ensures that chosen portfolio programs, 
projects, and ongoing activities are ones that should continue to be pursued.

6  ◾  Implementing Program Management
According to the Examination Content Outline (PMI, 2011), a ­high-­level view 
of the key tasks in Strategic Program Management is as follows:
◾
◾Performing an initial assessment to ensure the program is aligned to the stra­
tegic plan, its objectives, priorities, and vision or “to be” state, and conforms 
to its mission or reason for importance
◾
◾Preparing a ­high-­level roadmap with milestones
◾
◾Using this roadmap as a way to set a baseline to define the program and sup­
port its planning and execution
◾
◾Evaluating the capability of the organizational leaders to assess the program’s 
objectives, ensure their priority, feasibility, readiness, and alignment to stra­
tegic goals
◾
◾Identifying with a variety of techniques the benefits to the organization from 
the program
◾
◾Estimating these benefits both in financial and ­non-­financial ways
◾
◾Evaluating program objectives according to regulatory and legal constraints, 
social impacts, sustainability, and other concerns
◾
◾Obtaining approval from organizational leaders to approve the program
◾
◾Identifying and evaluating opportunities for integration of the program’s 
activities to further align and integrate the program’s benefits within and 
across the organization
◾
◾Evaluating strategic opportunities for change to maximize benefits for the 
organization flowing from the program
The Standard for Program Management—Third Edition (2013) refers to this 
domain as Program Strategy Alignment, focusing as well on organizational strat­
egy and the alignment of the program to it along with environmental assessments. 
The program, therefore, emphasizes identifying both opportunities and benefits 
to accomplish the organization’s strategic objectives once the program is imple­
mented. It notes the importance of determining on the need for the program and 
in doing so to validate the proposed outcomes through preparation of its business 
case. A program roadmap is another best practice to prepare with a strategic plan 
for the program.
We next will take a look at the artifacts produced in the Strategic Program 
Management or Program Strategic Alignment domain.
Program Benefits Statement
The benefits statement for the program is a key document. Without a practical and 
useful statement, there is no reason to have a program or to bother preparing a

business case for it. In Strategic Program Management, the ­high-­level benefits are 
set forth for the program, including both financial and ­non-­financial benefits, thus 
assisting the obtainment of approval for the program and helping to determine its 
priority in the organization’s portfolio. The benefits identified then are included in 
the program’s business case.
Program Benefits Statement Instructions
The program benefits statement includes the following:
Purpose: A brief introductory statement defining the purpose of the benefits 
statement, such as:
The program benefits statement defines the benefits for pursuing a 
program by documenting exactly what will be accomplished.
	
	
Its purpose is to address the value and organizational impact of the pro­
gram. It is an iterative document prepared before the program is authorized 
to be part of the program and moves to the initiating phase or program defi­
nition phase of the life cycle. It also is used to define benefits that later will be 
expanded as the benefits realization plan is prepared. It assists in developing 
the business case, program charter, and the program management plan and 
supports overall program monitoring and controlling.
Objectives and success criteria: This section formalizes the benefits to be real­
ized by the program, both tangible and intangible.
Assumptions: This section lists and describes the specific program assumptions 
associated with the program benefits and the potential impact of the assump­
tions should they prove to be false.
Constraints: This section lists and describes the specific program constraints 
associated with the program benefits that will limit the team’s options.
Interdependencies between projects in the program: This section identifies 
interdependencies between the benefits in the various proposed and existing 
projects that will comprise the program, as one project may produce benefits 
that then are used by another project later in the program.
Changes: This section identifies the potential impact of program changes on 
benefit outcomes.
Approvals: This section contains the written approval of the program ben­
efits statement by the program sponsor, the program management office, 
members of the Portfolio Review Board or comparable group, and other 
stakeholders.

Initial Stakeholder Identification
To be successful, you must identify in a timely fashion all those people who can 
help, hurt, or perhaps even kill your program before or after its birth. You must 
ultimately deal with each one appropriately. Skip this step at your peril.
This document is an initial list of program stakeholders. It is actually referenced 
later in this book in the Stakeholder Domain and developed more completely as 
the stakeholder register, but we include it here because it is so important before the 
program is approved officially.
Initial Stakeholder Identification Instructions
The initial stakeholder identification document includes the following:
Purpose: A brief introductory statement defining the purpose of the initial 
stakeholder identification, such as:
Stakeholder engagement is a key theme in program management. It is 
necessary to identify the stakeholders who will have an interest in or 
involvement with the program as early as possible to build support for 
the program and to show with whom communication is required.
	
	
Different stakeholders will have an interest in or influence over the pro­
gram at different times. When the program is proposed for consideration, 
stakeholder identification begins. It then is used to support the business case, 
as it helps to build support for the program and assists in the development 
of the program stakeholder engagement plan and the program communi­
cations management plan. It also assists in the development of the overall 
program management plan. Further, as the program’s mission statement 
describing why the program is important is prepared, stakeholder concerns 
and expectations require consideration to best address the overall direction 
of the program.

10  ◾  Implementing Program Management
	
	
At times, programs are established because a number of the organization’s 
projects involve the same stakeholders. Stakeholder involvement is a prereq­
uisite for program success.
Stakeholder definition: Different organizations will define stakeholders in dif­
ferent ways; a standard definition may be provided by a program manage­
ment office. This section states what is meant by a stakeholder, as a clear 
definition is required to determine whether the relevant stakeholders are 
identified. Note that the definition may be a person or group with an interest 
in the program, involvement (passive or active) in the program, influence over 
the program, provides information to the program, or is otherwise affected 
by the program. Stakeholders may be internal or external to the program.
Stakeholder roles: This section defines the various roles of program stakeholders, 
noting the importance of involving those stakeholders who are expected to be 
more active than others throughout the program life cycle. Roles can be based 
on functions to be performed, such as making program decisions, having 
responsibility for a program package, providing funding, providing resources, 
providing expert advice and consultation as appropriate, defining benefits and 
outcomes, ensuring that customer or user requirements are met, or contribut­
ing to the outcomes. This section states the names or groups involved in each 
identified role, and it provides contact information as appropriate.
Phases of the program life cycle: This section shows the roles, specific stake­
holders, and their expected levels of involvement in the various phases of the 
program life cycle. A classification system such as high, medium, or low; 
active versus passive; or positive versus negative may be used.
Stakeholder communication methods: This section provides initial informa­
tion as to methods to communicate with each of the identified stakeholders to 
obtain their support for the program. It will be further elaborated in the pro­
gram stakeholder engagement plan and the communications management plan. 
It is included to engage those key stakeholders in initial support for the program.
Approvals: This section contains the written approval of the initial stakeholder 
identification by the program sponsor and others as appropriate.

Program Business Case
The program business case is used as the key document to obtain organiza­
tional approval for the program. It describes, among other things, the program’s 
­cost-­benefit justification. Quite naturally, this information is used and updated 
throughout the overall life cycle of the program. It is described in The Standard for 
Program Management—Third Edition (2013) as the key document to be used to 
charter and authorize programs. Updates to the business case are made as required 
and approved if the program is authorized. Further, it is reviewed regularly espe­
cially as part of the reviews by the Portfolio Review Board or comparable group to 
determine whether or not the program should continue to be part of the portfolio 
to ensure it still is contributing to the program’s goals and objectives. When the 
program is ready to close, the business case is reviewed to assess the benefits stated 
in it with those that actually were realized.
In the Standard for Program Management—Third Edition (2013), the business 
case is part of organizational strategy and program alignment. It is used in:
◾
◾Program mandate preparation (3.1.1)
◾
◾Benefit identification and in preparing the benefits register (4.1.2)
◾
◾Stakeholder engagement planning (5.2)
◾
◾Program approval, endorsement, and initiation (6.2.2)

Program Business Case Instructions
Purpose: A brief introductory statement defining the purpose of the program 
business case, such as:
The program business case describes the need, feasibility, and justi­
fication for the program.
	
	
Typically, this document is prepared by the program sponsor with input 
from other key stakeholders. In some organizations, the program manager 
may have been identified, and he or she also participates in its development. 
It may be provided by the client or the funding organization. It is prepared 
before the program is approved, as it is the key document used in selecting the 
program for approval by the organization’s Portfolio Review Board or other 
­decision-­making body. Once approved, the program initiation or program 
definition phase begins. It then provides direction for the program and shows 
the value the program should deliver.
	
	
Although the business case is prepared to initiate the program, it 
should be revisited and updated as required on a regular basis to ensure 
that the program continues to meet its objectives and is delivering its 
expected benefits.
Program strategic objectives: This section describes the expected results from 
the program. It shows how these expected results complement the organiza­
tion’s strategic objectives. It states the vision or end state of the program, the 
mission or why the program is important, and the values to be used in mak­
ing decisions concerning program activities. The program’s objectives must 
be aligned with the organization’s strategic plan and goals.
Program benefits: A benefit is an improvement to the running of an organi­
zation that provides utility to the organization and/­or customers or other 
groups. Benefits may be financial or nonfinancial, intrinsic or extrinsic, tan­
gible or intangible. This section describes the expected benefits to be delivered 
through the program, such as to enhance existing capabilities or develop new 
capabilities. It explains why it is more appropriate to manage this initiative as 
a program rather than as separate projects, and describes the types of projects 
that probably will be part of the program and the collective benefits to be 
realized through a program management structure. It identifies the level of 
investment and support required to realize the proposed benefits.

14  ◾  Implementing Program Management
Required resources: This section provides a ­high-­level estimate of the resources 
required for the program. It includes all resources, not just human resources, 
and shows why they are needed and when they will need to be available. It 
highlights the value of the program against the resources that are required for 
its successful implementation.
Financial analysis: This section contains the financial analysis of the program 
in terms of financial indices, such as the return on investment, net present 
value, and the payback period. It shows the costs to execute the program com­
pared to the benefits to be realized by the program. These indicators should be 
tracked throughout the program. This section describes sources of program 
funding, trends in labor and material costs, and contract costs as appropriate.
Assumptions and constraints: Programs are based on a series of assumptions 
or facts that are considered to be true, real, or certain. They also include 
constraints or those factors that may be imposed on a program such as avail­
able funding, legislative actions, or a ­time-­­to-­market deadline. This section 
lists assumptions and constraints applicable to the program.
Internal and external influences: Programs may be initiated for a number of 
reasons, and there are a wide range of internal and external influences that 
can affect the program or show the reason it should be undertaken. This 
section describes these influences and explains the program’s business and 
operation impact. If it is an external program, this section states the mar­
ket demand for the program, environmental impacts, social needs, and any 
barriers to entry. ­Time-­to-­market data are included in this section. In addi­
tion, these influences may affect the execution of the program. This section 
describes these influences and why they are significant to the program, as 
they often become program constraints.
Alternative analysis: Because of resource limitations and other constraints, it is 
necessary to recognize that competing initiatives exist in the organization as 
all possible projects and programs cannot be approved. This section describes 
the results of alternative analyses, or “what if” analyses, to show different 
approaches that could be considered in order to meet the program’s intended 
objectives. Feasibility studies may be included as well in this section. It is used 
to show that initiating this program is the most effective way to meet these 
objectives and deliver the expected benefits. Strength, weakness, opportunity, 
and threat (SWOT) analysis may be included.
Program complexity: Programs are initiated because of the need for some type 
of change to implement new capabilities to be used within the organization 
or by customers or to enhance existing capabilities. This section describes 
the complexity of this change initiative to best determine whether or not it 
should be managed as a program and undertaken by the organization.

Approvals: This section contains the written approval of the program business 
case by the members of the Portfolio Review Board or similar group and 
any other key stakeholders as appropriate. These approvals justify the use of 
resources required for the program and project the value the program is to 
deliver to the organization.

Program Mandate
The program mandate, along with the business case, typically is the major document 
that will be used to gain approval to proceed to program initiation. It is a key input 
for the Portfolio Review Board or comparable group use to determine whether to 
charter and authorize programs. As The Standard for Program Management—Third 
Edition (2013) notes, it is used to confirm commitment of organizational resources 
to the program in that it defines the program’s expected strategic objectives and 

18  ◾  Implementing Program Management
benefits. It is used in the benefits identification process (4.1). In some organizations, 
the term Program Brief is used. It is issued by the Portfolio Review Board or a 
comparable group.
Program Mandate Instructions
The program mandate includes the following:
Purpose: A brief introductory statement defining the purpose of the program 
mandate, such as:
The program mandate describes the importance for this program to 
be part of the organization’s portfolio.
	
	
The program mandate is typically prepared after the business case has 
been made for the program and before the program is initiated. The program 
sponsor usually prepares the program mandate, since he or she is the person 
who will provide funding for the program, with input from other key stake­
holders. A client may suggest that the program be undertaken and may pro­
vide supporting details concerning its importance. It serves as the document 
that is provided to members of the organization’s Portfolio Review Board or 
comparable group to approve the program as it defines the strategic objectives 
and benefits and then leads to the formal initiation process.
	
	
This template provides guidance for the generic factors that should be 
included as part of the program mandate, recognizing that it will be tailored, 
since each organization will have different criteria that it uses to select and 
prioritize programs, projects, and ongoing operations. The program mandate 
should address these specific criteria used by the organization.
Program importance: This section sets the stage for the remainder of the docu­
ment, as it shows the importance of the program to the organization. It pro­
vides a description of what the program is intended to achieve and why this 
initiative should be managed as a program rather than as a project.
Program vision: This section contains the vision for the program or its end 
state, providing more details as to what the program will achieve.
Program strategic objectives: This section states the strategic objectives of the 
program and shows how each objective relates to the organization’s strategic 
objectives and strategic plan. It shows how these objectives then will achieve 
the program’s vision. This section also shows how this program will interface 
with other programs and projects in the organization that are under way and 
are part of the overall strategic initiatives.
Program benefits: A benefit is an outcome of the program, such as an improve­
ment to the overall operations of the organization or a desired product, 

Strategic Program Management/­Alignment  ◾  19
service, or result for clients. This section describes the benefits of the program 
to the organization and how they will be realized through the various com­
ponents of the program—projects and ­non-­project work.
Program scope and components: This section states the scope of the program 
in terms of the products, services, and results that will be delivered in order to 
realize the benefits. It describes the identified components that will comprise 
the program and how they will relate to one another; often these components 
already are under way as individual projects. If this is the case, this section 
shows how these components, if managed as a program, will achieve more 
benefits than if they were continued as individual projects. This section also 
describes what is considered to be outside of the scope of the program.
Assumptions and constraints: This section states the assumptions and con­
straints that are expected to affect the proposed program. Assumptions are 
those items that are considered to be true, real, or certain without any backup 
documentation, while constraints represent any milestones to be imposed on 
the program or limits in terms of schedule, costs, and resources.
Program schedule: This section presents a ­high-­level schedule of the program’s 
deliverables and key milestones.
Resource requirements: This section states the resource requirements for the 
program and includes all resources, not just people. It also notes when specific 
resources will be required according to the ­high-­level schedule.
Risks and issues: Various risks and issues will affect the program. This section 
presents those risks and issues that may affect the program, positively or nega­
tively, and that have been identified at the time the program is proposed in 
order that the organization can determine whether the level of risk is accept­
able before proceeding further.
Stakeholder considerations: Stakeholders play a key role in any program. This 
section presents a list of those stakeholders that are expected to influence the 
program, positively or negatively, and others who will have an interest in the 
program at certain phases in the life cycle.
Governance requirements: This section states the governance requirements 
for the program as it specifies the use of a Governance Board or similar 
group and suggests key members for this Board. It states whether it is 
necessary to modify existing governance procedures used in the organiza­
tion for the program and shows how the Board will meet to oversee the 
program according to the schedule. This section also states the governance 
processes at the program level that are proposed for oversight of the vari­
ous components. It describes reporting requirements to the Governance 
Board from the program manager and to the program manager from com­
ponent managers.
Approvals: This section contains the written approval of the program mandate 
by the members of the Portfolio Review Board or similar group and any other 
key stakeholders as appropriate.

Program Roadmap
Timing of major milestones is important in the selling and execution of a program. 
The program roadmap provides a guide or “map” through time of the program’s 
scope and execution. There is considerable similarity of the program roadmap to the 
concept of the integrated master plan in the United States Department of Defense 
(2005). At this time the roadmap is high level in nature. It is greatly refined later in 
the program, especially as the program management plan is prepared.
The terms roadmap and timeline are sometimes confused. Indeed, a roadmap 
document should include a (usually) single graphic depiction of its essence. That 
depiction is a timeline, but in the roadmap there is far more strategic information. 
The program roadmap graphic not only conveys the essence of the program in a 
single diagram, but it also must convey that information completely enough in 
a manner readily assimilated by ­higher-­level executives in the organization.
Program Roadmap Instructions
The program roadmap includes the following:
Purpose: A brief introductory statement defining the purpose of the program 
roadmap, such as:
The program roadmap shows, in a chronological way, the program’s 
intended direction as it describes major milestones, key dependen­
cies, the link between the planned and prioritized work, and key 
decision points.
	
	
The program roadmap helps in program execution and management, 
as it is used to assess progress in delivering benefits. It shows the program’s 
­high-­level, overall scope and execution. It is prepared based on the program’s 
business case and the organization’s strategic objectives.
	
	
Although the program roadmap is prepared as the program is initiated, it 
is an iterative document, developed in a ­rolling-­wave format, and it should 
be reviewed periodically by the program management team, other key stake­
holders, and the members of the Governance Board, as the work of the 

24  ◾  Implementing Program Management
program continues throughout the various phases in its life cycle, especially 
when there are schedule, financial, benefit, and other program changes.
	
	
The program roadmap is a subsidiary document to the program man­
agement plan and evolves with it. It is referenced often in the Standard for 
Program Management—Third Edition (2013). Please see section 3.2, which 
points out its usefulness in showing milestones details, deliverables, assump­
tions, and benefits, pointing out it is essential in executing the program and 
positioning it for success. Section 4.2.2 describes its importance in benefit 
management in showing objectives, challenges, and risks. It also is described, 
along with the program charter, in Section 8.3.1.6, with a focus on commu­
nicating the link between the business strategy and the planned and priori­
tized work.
Endpoint objectives: This section describes the overall objectives of the pro­
gram, especially in terms of benefits realization and ultimate benefits sustain­
ment. It describes the link between the business strategy and the planned 
and prioritized work to be done in the program. It may include any needed 
resources or competencies required for program success.
Key challenges and risks: This section describes the key challenges associated 
with the program and the identified risks to the program. By noting these 
challenges and risks as part of the roadmap, deviations from them then may 
indicate other threats to the program or potential opportunities.
Key milestones and decision points: This section describes the key milestones 
and decision points in the program. As part of the roadmap, the ­high-­level, 
overall scope and execution of the program are shown. These milestones and 
key decision points will increase as the program ensues, as components are 
completed, and others are initiated as part of the program. As decisions are 
made, and as change requests from other areas cause milestones to change, 
the roadmap may require updates. This section may include a graphic road­
map fashioned after the simple example at the end of this section. The con­
figuration of that depiction is highly dependent on the individual program 
and must be tailored as such to convey in a single glance the overview of the 
roadmap document.
Program organization: This section describes the dependencies between the 
program components, such as releases in a software program or stages in a 
construction program. It describes when components are to be implemented 
and how requests to initiate components are processed.
Supporting infrastructure: This section describes the support structure 
and needed capabilities for the program, such as use of a program man­
agement office; guidelines, procedures, and templates; facilities; and tools 
and techniques.
Approvals: This section contains the written approval of the program roadmap by 
the program sponsor, program manager, program management office, mem­
bers of the Governance Board, and any other key stakeholders as appropriate.

Program Roadmap Diagramming
The graphical program roadmap can be (and not unusually is) implemented with 
a variety of tools such as spreadsheets, diagramming tools, scheduling tools, and 
presentation tools. Each mode has advantages and disadvantages.
It is always convenient when the graphic can be data driven, owing to the fact 
that many updates can be sometimes made by changing underlying data without as 
many tedious drawing requirements. Such is the allure of the spreadsheet approach. 
Spreadsheets at this writing, however, generally do not provide the “­plug-­in” power 
to translate into great diagrams, even though spreadsheets can drive presentation 
tools and diagramming tools.
In terms of design approach, the example program roadmap of section 3.2 of 
the Standard for Program Management—Third Edition (2013) exhibits several good 
design characteristics:
	
1.	It provides a ­long-­term view of the program’s milestones.
	
2.	It gives more detail about ­near-­term milestones.
	
3.	It gives much more condensed information on ­longer-­term milestones.
	
3.	Multiple swim lanes provide a coordinated overview of program areas.
	
4.	Milestones illustrate benefit achievement among other aspects.
See the graphic, which follows, as an approach to consider.

Program Benefits 
Management
Write injuries in dust, benefits in marble.
—Benjamin Franklin
The benefits of our problem are the reason we are working on it, and we want 
them to be not just identified, but realized and sustained so they can be written 
‘in marble’. Establishing a program indicates that by doing so greater benefits will 
result than if the projects and other work of the program were managed separately.
On a program, benefits are of many different types. Some may be realized 
immediately or at various program milestones; others may not be realized until the 
program is completed or may not even be recognized as benefits until years after 
the program ends. Some benefits are tangible or easily quantifiable, while others are 
intangible, difficult to quantify but equally or in some cases even more important. 
Benefits may be ones of value only to the performing organization or intrinsic, 
while on other programs they are extrinsic and may be ones used by clients or the 
society at large.
Within a program, each project or other work has some benefits associated 
within it that are realized at various times, and they are consolidated as the pro­
gram ends.
According to the Examination Content Outline (PMI, 2011), a ­high-­level view 
of the key tasks in Benefits Management is as follows:
◾
◾Developing a benefits realization plan
◾
◾Updating and communicating the plan to stakeholders

30  ◾  Implementing Program Management
◾
◾Developing a benefits sustainment plan
◾
◾Monitoring established metrics to maintain and hopefully improve ben­
efit realization
◾
◾Identifying that as projects close the program meets or exceeds its benefit 
realization criteria
◾
◾Maintaining a benefits register
◾
◾Analyzing and updating the benefits realization and sustainment plans
◾
◾Developing a transition plan to operations to further sustain the pro­
gram’s benefits
The Standard for Program Management—Third Edition (2013) refers to this 
domain as Program Benefits Management and sets forth a program benefit delivery 
process, which follows program definition, and ensures that the projects and other 
work of the program, or its components, are planned, realized, and managed in 
order that the benefits stated in the initial business case are delivered and possibly 
exceeded. It entails not only defining the benefits but also creating, realizing, maxi­
mizing, and sustaining them. It is therefore a constant theme in program manage­
ment with a ­five-­stage process of:
◾
◾Benefits Identification
◾
◾Benefits Analysis and Planning
◾
◾Benefits Delivery
◾
◾Benefits Transition
◾
◾Benefits Sustainment
Key artifacts in Program Benefits Management follow, building on the Initial 
Program Benefits Statement prepared in Strategic Program Management/­Alignment.
Benefits Breakdown Structure
While a Program Work Breakdown Structure is a recognized best practice in pro­
gram management, a Benefits Breakdown Structure also is useful. Thiry (2004) 
described a functional diagramming method, which in use of programs he called it 
a Benefit Breakdown Structure.
Its purpose is to show how the program’s vision or desired end state is realized 
through strategic objectives that are implemented through benefits until each project’s 
or ­non-­project work in the program produce capabilities, which then contribute to 
business benefits, the strategic objectives, and the overall vision (Thiry, 2010).
Benefit Breakdown Structure Instructions
The benefits breakdown structure builds on the initial benefits statement described 
in the previous chapter, and the benefits listed in the business case. It is useful in 

Program Benefits Management  ◾  31
benefits Identification to ensure the program manager and team members have 
not overlooked any benefits expected from the program. It is essential to define the 
benefits to qualify their business value and then to determine how best to measure 
their achievement.
To develop the benefits breakdown structure, a similar approach to developing 
a program work breakdown structure (PWBS) can be used following the decom­
position process.
Start with the overall program and its strategic objectives from the business 
case. Then follow these steps:
	
1.	List the projects and other work to be performed by the program.
	
2.	Identify the specific benefits that each project or operational activity is to realize.
	
3.	Identify ­program-­level benefits that are not associated with any of these 
components.
	
4.	Each identified benefit then is a benefit package.
	
5.	Link the benefit package to the appropriate PWBS element.
	
6.	Assign the responsibility for benefit package to an individual or organiza­
tional unit.
Figure 4.1 shows a graphical representation of the benefit breakdown structure.
Benefits Register
As the benefits are identified, a benefits register becomes a critical program 
­decision-­making tool that is updated throughout the program. It is first prepared as 
part of benefits identification according to The Standard for Program Management—
Third Edition (2013). As more detail is known about the program’s benefits, espe­
cially in reviews with stakeholders and members of the program’s Governance 
Board or comparable group, additional details are added to it to describe how each 
benefit will be measured, evaluated to assess its achievement, the date the benefit is 
to be realized, and the responsible person, organizational unit, or group. It is used 
by the Governance Board to assist in evaluating the status of the program’s benefits 
and as a way to communicate their achievement to program stakeholders.
Therefore, as noted in The Standard for Program Management—Third Edition 
(2013), it assists in developing the benefits realization plan and is updated after

the benefits analysis and planning activities are completed when key performance 
indicators are defined as program benefits are mapped to the components as shown 
in the roadmap. It also is maintained in benefits delivery as the program’s progress 
is recorded and is reviewed as the benefits are transitioned. To develop it, the orga­
nization’s strategic plan, the business case, and the roadmap are reviewed.
Benefits Register Instructions
The benefits register is prepared as a table and a description of its contents follows:
	
1.	Benefits identification number: Assign an identification number to the benefit.
	
2.	PWBS number: Link the benefit to the corresponding program package in 
the program work breakdown structure.
	
3.	Benefits breakdown structure number: Link the benefit to the correspond­
ing benefit package in the benefit breakdown structure.
	
4.	Benefit description: Describe the benefit and its significance to the program.
	
5.	Benefit type: Describe the type of benefit such as:
−
−Financial or ­non-­financial
−
−Tangible or intangible
−
−Extrinsic or intrinsic
	
6.	Benefit owner: List the person, organizational unit, or department respon­
sible for realization of the benefit with contact information.
	
7.	Program contribution: Determine the estimated contribution of the benefit 
to the program in terms of the strategic objectives.
	
8.	Benefit realization: State how the benefit is to be realized.
	
9.	Resources required: List the resources required to realize the benefit.
	 10.	Planned realization date: State the date the benefit is to be realized.
	 11.	Actual realization date: State the date the benefit was realized; provide 
information as needed if the dates are different and describe any corrective 
actions taken.
	 12.	Measurement criteria: Consider the type of benefit and describe how the 
benefit will be measured such as:
−
−Financial analysis

−
−Reduction in the strength of competitors
	 13.	Measurement method: List how often measurements will be taken and the 
estimated effort involved.
	 14.	Risks: List any possible risks that may affect benefit realization.

Benefits Realization Plan
The benefits realization plan is the “­one-­stop shop” for benefits identification, mon­
itoring, and implementation of benefits achievement, and defining them in terms 
of measurable program outcomes.
In the Project Management Institute’s Standard for Program Management—
Third Edition (2013), the benefits realization plan is noted in the benefits manage­
ment life cycle under phase two, benefits analysis and planning. During Strategic 
Program Management, the importance of benefits is noted as part of the business 
case used to justify the program (3.1.1) and to determine whether or not it should 
be part of the organization’s portfolio. Benefits also are described in the business 
case for each of the projects in the program. The program roadmap (3.1.2) shows 
the linkage between program activities and expected benefits.
The benefits realization plan is noted in Section 4.2 and serves to guide the 
work done in the program. It is a significant document as it serves as a baseline. 
After it is prepared, the benefit register should be updated (4.2.3). The plan is used 
in benefits delivery (4.3) and its ­sub-­sections, program benefits and program com­
ponents (4.3.1), program benefits and program governance (4.3.2), and may need 
modifications. It is also used in program management plan development (8.3.2) 
and in scope definition in program scope management (8.9). If the benefits realiza­
tion plan is modified, the roadmap requires updating (4.3.2).
Benefits Realization Plan Instructions
The benefits realization plan includes the following:
Purpose: A brief introductory statement defining the purpose of the benefits 
realization plan, such as:
The benefits realization plan assesses the value and organizational 
impact of the program. It identifies the benefits to be realized from 
the projects and other work of the program and ensures the benefits 
are specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and time based.
	
	
It also analyzes the impact of changes on the overall outcome of the pro­
gram and assigns roles and responsibilities to ensure the identified benefits are 

34  ◾  Implementing Program Management
attained. Although the plan is drafted early in the program, it is an iterative 
document that should be further refined as the program progresses through 
the life cycle. This plan is included in the program management plan as it 
helps to determine how benefits will be realized and provides a baseline for 
tracking progress and reporting variances. It also focuses on an effective tran­
sition to an operation state once the program ends.
Definition of each program benefit: This section defines each benefit in the 
program—tangible and intangible, financial and ­non-­financial, or extrinsic or 
intrinsic. It also shows how the benefit is to be realized. The benefits described 
in this section should be in line with those in the program’s business case and 
the organization’s overall strategy. Benefits are identified through interviews, 
brainstorming sessions, and review sessions. It builds on the benefits already 
identified in the benefit register.
Assumptions: This section lists any assumptions for the benefits that have been 
identified and defines them further in this plan. Assumptions are facts that 
the team considers during planning to be true, real, or certain. In terms of 
benefits, examples include: availability of required resources in terms of the 
schedule to realize each benefit, measuring the status of each benefit defined 
in the plan, and identifying opportunities to realize even more benefits than 
those initially defined.
Each benefit’s impact to the program’s outcomes: This section shows how 
each benefit relates to the outcomes of the program. It further shows the value 
of the program in terms of the benefits to be realized, and it describes the 
interdependencies between the program’s benefits.
Metrics and procedures to measure benefits: In order to ensure that the pro­
gram is realizing its intended benefits, this section describes the key metrics 
that will be collected, and the processes that will be used to measure the 
program benefits. Suggested metrics include scheduled time for benefits real­
ization versus actual time, extent of the benefits realized versus those planned 
in the business case, impact of the realized benefit on other components of 
the program, the need to change the benefits as the program progresses versus 
those in the plan, the value of the benefits that were realized, the extent of the 
sustainment of benefits after the program ends, and other benefits realized 
that were not planned. As well, this section includes a process to determine 
the extent to which each benefit has been achieved before the program is 
closed. The metrics can be used if the benefits are not realized as planned in 
order that corrective actions can be implemented.
Roles and responsibilities for benefits realization and management: Benefits 
realization and management is a team effort. This section describes specific 
roles and responsibilities of the program team members to deliver final and 
intermediate benefits in the program. These roles and responsibilities can be 
displayed in a Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM) or in a Responsible, 
Accountable, Consult, Inform (RACI) chart to show whether the team 

Program Benefits Management  ◾  35
member is responsible for the benefit, should be involved in its realization in 
terms of monitoring and control, should be performing an ongoing analysis 
of the program for incremental benefits to make adjustments to the benefits 
delivery schedule, should be consulted as the benefit is realized, or should 
sign off once the benefit has been realized.
Benefits management communications plan: Program stakeholders require 
information concerning how the proposed program benefits are being real­
ized. This section describes the communications methods to be used to ensure 
each stakeholder has the information he or she requires regarding benefits 
management. It also describes how benefits will be reviewed with stakehold­
ers. It discusses the preparation on a regular basis of the benefits realization 
report, since this report is an output of the report performance process, and 
describes the benefits realization plan versus the actual benefits delivered and 
serves to monitor overall benefits delivery. The benefits management commu­
nications plan can be an appendix or section in the program’s communica­
tions management plan.
Benefits delivery schedule: For many programs benefits will not be realized at 
the same time; however, in others they will be realized incrementally. Also, 
some projects in the program will need to integrate the benefits from their 
projects with other projects or ongoing work of the program. This section 
presents a schedule, typically in a Gantt or network chart format, to show the 
planned and actual dates for each of the identified benefits in the program. 
The schedule should show the interdependencies between benefits from the 
various projects in the program and the other work that is part of the pro­
gram. This schedule should be part of the program’s master schedule. It also 
is included as part of the program roadmap.
­Benefits-­related risks: Each benefit will have some type of risks associated with its 
realization. This section describes the risks and stresses the risks that may occur 
based on the component risks on benefits delivery so they can be evaluated.
Required changes to processes and systems: This section discusses new pro­
cesses and systems and those already in existence, which must be changed in 
order to track and monitor benefits as they are being realized in the program.
Transition of the program’s benefits into ongoing operations and benefits 
sustainment: When the program is officially closed, the program is transi­
tioned into ongoing operations. This section describes how the program will 
transition and how the program’s benefits will be sustained. It is important to 
ensure that the transition activities provide for continued management of the 
benefits within the framework of the customer organization as appropriate. 
Recognize that benefits management transcends the program’s life cycle and 
continues into transfer and sustainment of the benefits of the program.
Approvals: This section contains the written approval of the benefits realization 
plan by the program sponsor, program manager, program management office 
director, members of the Governance Board, and other stakeholders.

Benefits Realization Report
This report specifies progress toward achieving benefits and correlates related 
expenditures. While this report is not mentioned in Standard for Program 
Management—Third Edition (2013), we have retained it from the Standard for 
Program Management—Second Edition (2008) and have modified it slightly 
because of the importance of benefits to program management.
Benefits Realization Report Instructions
The benefits realization report includes the following:
Purpose: A brief introductory statement defining the purpose of the benefits 
realization report, such as:
The benefits realization report describes the benefits realized to date 
to ensure that they are aligned with the program’s business case and 
benefits realization plan.
	
	
Programs are established to achieve benefits that may not be realized if 
its components were managed individually. Benefits realization and effective 
benefits transition and sustainment are keys to a successful program. Benefits 
have value when they are used by the customer, by an operations or support 
group, or by another program in the organization. Programs are interested 
in the progress of the program in terms of its realization of benefits.

40  ◾  Implementing Program Management
	
	
Since the program components will deliver benefits at different times, the 
benefits realization report needs to be prepared and issued on a regular basis 
so stakeholders are informed of progress and to see whether any corrective or 
preventive actions are required. The benefits realization report should track to 
the benefits realization plan.
	
	
The following are the recommended contents for the benefits realiza­
tion report:
Background information:
Program overview: This section presents a brief overview of the program 
in terms of the benefits that are expected to be realized based on 
the benefits realization plan and to ensure that the benefits remain 
aligned with the business case.
Reporting period: This section states the reporting period for the report. 
A monthly report is recommended, with ad hoc communications as 
required when benefits are achieved before the report is formally issued.

management team member who prepared the report.
Benefits realized during the reporting period:
Quantitative benefits: This section states the quantitative benefits that 
were realized during the reporting period in conjunction with the 
program’s business case and its objectives. It describes when the ben­
efits realization starts in terms of transfer to ongoing operations, the 
customer, or another program. It also states quantifiable measures of 
success, such as an increase in productivity, market share, or prof­
its; improvements over those of the competition; net present value; 
shareholder value added, return on investment; ­benefit-­cost; extent of 
rework required; product conformance with requirements; and cus­
tomer acceptance of deliverables.
Qualitative benefits: This section states qualitative benefits such as cus­
tomer satisfaction, team satisfaction, use of processes and procedures, 
value of program management tools used, strategic importance, 
impact of the deliverables on the organization, improvements in 
morale, validity of the program vision, effect of technology in terms 
of benefit achievement, the involvement of team members in perfor­
mance improvement initiatives, or a societal benefit such as reduced 
exposure to a foodborne health hazard. It is necessary to then describe 
these qualitative benefits in quantitative terms.
Benefits not realized during the reporting period: This section states those 
benefits that were expected to be realized during the reporting period but 
were not completed according to the benefits delivery schedule in the ben­
efits realization plan. It describes any corrective actions that are required in 
order to meet the delivery schedule so that actions can be taken for successful

benefits delivery. Corrective action may lead to the need to add new com­
ponents, make revisions to existing components, or terminate a component.
New benefits: This section states any new benefits from existing components 
that now have led to a need to revise the benefits realization plan and the pro­
gram roadmap. It describes any interdependencies between these new ben­
efits and those already identified in the plan. This section also states who is 
responsible to ensure that these benefits are realized and delivered as planned.
Approvals: This section contains the written approval of the benefits realiza­
tion report by the program manager, program sponsor, program manage­
ment office director, members of the Governance Board, and any other key 
stakeholders as appropriate.

Program Benefits Transition Plan
Without transition, program benefits are, in most cases, simply forgotten or ter­
minated. Without proper transition management for both the components and 
the program, the program lacks value. As noted in the Standard for Program 
Management—Third Edition (2013), value from the program is only possible if the 
beneficiaries can use its benefits.
The scope of the benefits transition must be defined, and a best practice to 
follow is to involve the key stakeholders who will be responsible for the transition 
in preparing this plan. The delivered program benefits are measured and consoli­
dated, and the benefits register (4.1.2) is updated. The realized benefits should be 
compared to those in the business case (4.1.1). It is recognized that other activities 
are part of the program transition process. The importance of benefit transition and 
sustainment also is discussed as part of the closing processes (8.3.6).

Program Benefits Transition Plan Instructions
The program benefits transition plan will include the following:
Purpose: A brief introductory statement defining the purpose of the program 
benefits transition plan, such as:
The program benefits transition plan describes the process that will 
be followed to facilitate the ongoing realization of the program’s ben­
efits when the benefits are delivered to the customer; to another unit 
in the performing organization, such as a product support, customer 
support, or service management group; or to another program that is 
under way or about to start to ensure the benefits can be sustained.
	
	
This plan serves to provide a smooth transition process. The objective is to 
ensure that the benefits from the program continue to be realized as long as 
possible. Once the transition activities are complete, program resources then 
are reallocated, and all program records are closed. It is an iterative document 
that may be refined as various program components are closed and transi­
tioned to ongoing operational status or to the customer.
	
	
In the Project Management Institute’s Standard for Program Management—
Third Edition (2013), the benefits transition plan is the fourth phase in the 
benefits life cycle. It also notes that programs may be terminated without a 
transition to operations especially if the program charter has been fulfilled or 
if the program no longer is valuable to the organization.
Transition process: This section describes the benefits transition process to be 
followed. It states the key stakeholders involved in preparing the plan, ways 
to ensure resulting benefits are measured, the benefits register is updated, 
acceptance criteria from the results or outputs from program components are 
met, and approval requirements. The receivers need to be ready to accept the 
benefits, which may require training, workshops, meetings, job aids, support 
systems, complete documentation, etc. A schedule for the benefit transition 
activities should be part of the overall program master schedule and included 
in the program roadmap.
Component transition requests: Throughout the program, different compo­
nents (projects and ­non-­project work) will finish before others. Each time 
a component is officially closed, a transition request should be prepared to 
transition the benefits from the component into ongoing operational status, 
to the customer, or to another program. This section describes the process to 
prepare these requests, the format to be used, and the approval requirements. 
Typically, these activities are part of the last gate review for the component.

44  ◾  Implementing Program Management
Documentation requirements: This section describes documentation to be 
prepared as part of the benefit transition process. It also includes a description 
of any training to be provided or materials that may be needed. Often, tran­
sitions are formal ­contract-­type activities; in other situations, a more infor­
mal process may be appropriate. Meetings and conferences may be required. 
While the receivers will vary based on the component and type of program, 
a clear understanding of the specific benefits to be transitioned is required so 
there are no misunderstandings later in the process.
Roles and responsibilities: This section describes the roles and responsibilities 
of the program management team as well as the receiving organization in the 
transition process. The receiving organization ideally should be a participant 
in preparing the transition plan so there is a clear understanding of what will 
be handed to this unit, and the process that will be followed.
Transition critical success factors: This section describes the critical success 
factors that are considered essential to ongoing benefits transition and sus­
tainment. It may include items such as continuing to meet product demands, 
adding value to the ongoing process that will be followed, having a customer 
or product support representative available, providing an assessment later to 
determine if the resulting changes have been implemented successfully, pro­
viding support if changes are required, disposing and reallocating required 
resources, and training support staff as needed.
Approvals: This section contains the written approval of the program benefits 
transition plan by the program sponsor, program manager, program manage­
ment office, members of the Governance Board, and other stakeholders.

Program Benefits Sustainment Plan
Having gone through transition, benefits should be ready for continuing accrual. 
While the benefits transition plan is intended to provide necessary forethought 
and preparation for ongoing benefits accrual, in and of itself it does not provide 
all of the detailed mechanisms, processes, and changes necessary for indefinite

success as the transitioned benefits continue in a changing world. According to the 
Standard for Program Management—Third Edition (2013, the plan should address 
the risks, processes, measures, metrics, and tools that will be needed.
Benefits Sustainment Plan Instructions
The benefits sustainment plan includes the following and must be a living docu­
ment continually adapting to its environment:
Purpose: A brief introductory statement defining the purpose of the benefits 
sustainment plan, such as:
The benefits sustainment plan provides the mechanisms necessary 
to assure that benefits continue to accrue in an ever changing envi­
ronment. It draws extensively on the contents of the benefits transi­
tion plan.
Definition of each program benefit: Taken from program documentation and 
specifically the benefits register, this section defines for reference the program 
benefits to be sustained.
Sustainment critical success factors: This section describes the critical success 
factors that are considered essential to ongoing benefits sustainment. It may 
include items such as continuing to meet product demands, adding value to 
the ongoing process that will be followed, having a customer or product sup­
port representative available, providing an assessment later to determine if 
the resulting changes have been implemented successfully, providing support 
if changes are required, disposing and reallocating required resources, and 
training support staff as needed.
Assumptions: This section lists any assumptions for the benefits that have 
been identified previously or are further identified defined in this plan. 
Assumptions are facts that the team considers during planning to be true, 
real, or certain.
Metrics and procedures to measure benefits: In order to ensure that the pro­
gram is realizing its intended benefits, this section describes the key metrics 
that will be collected, and the processes that will be used, to measure the pro­
gram benefits. Suggested metrics include scheduled time for benefits sustain­
ment versus actual time, extent of the benefits realized versus those planned 
in the business case, impact of the realized benefits on other components of 
the program, the need to change the benefits as the transitioned program 
progresses versus those in the plan, the value of the benefits that were real­
ized, the extent of the sustainment of benefits after the program ends, and 
other benefits realized that were not planned. These metrics can be used if 
the benefits are not realized as planned in order that corrective actions can 
be implemented.

48  ◾  Implementing Program Management
Roles and responsibilities for benefits sustainment: Benefits sustainment and 
management is a team effort and must address all critical success factors. This 
section describes specific roles and responsibilities of the transitioned team 
members to deliver final and intermediate benefits in the program. These roles 
and responsibilities can be displayed in a responsibility assignment matrix 
(RAM) or in a Responsible, Accountable, Consult, Inform (RACI) chart 
to show whether the team member who is responsible for the benefit should 
be involved in its sustainment in terms of monitoring and control, should be 
performing an ongoing analysis of the program for incremental benefits to 
make adjustments to the benefits delivery schedule, should be consulted as 
the benefit is realized, or should sign off once the benefit has been sustained.
Benefits sustainment communications plan: Program stakeholders require 
information concerning how the proposed program benefits are being sus­
tained. This section describes the communications methods to be used to 
ensure each stakeholder has the information he or she requires regarding ben­
efits sustainment and identifies the interested stakeholders.
Benefits ­sustainment-­related risks: Each benefit will have some type of risks 
associated with its ongoing successful sustainment. This section describes the 
risks and stresses the risks that may occur.
Required changes to processes and systems: This section discusses new pro­
cesses and systems and those already in existence, which must be changed in 
order to track and monitor benefits as they are being realized in the program.
Approvals: This section contains the written approval of the benefits sustain­
ment plan by the program sponsor, program manager, program management 
office director, members of the Governance Board, and other stakeholders.

Chapter 5
Program Stakeholder 
Engagement
The greatest ability in business is to get along with others and to influ­
ence their actions.
—John Hancock
Program managers must be outstanding communicators as they deal with numer­
ous stakeholders at all levels of the organization and with external stakeholders as 
well. Research has shown for years that project managers spend about 90% of their 
time communicating. Given the complexity of programs and the larger number of 
stakeholders, it is evident that the program manager spends even more time com­
municating with stakeholders on most programs.
The proactive program manager is one who strives to identify stakeholders who 
have an interest in or can influence his or her program as early as possible and 
then to set forth to engage them effectively. The objective is for all stakeholders 
to be positive and supportive of the program’s goals and to work collaboratively to 
achieve them. While it may not be possible for everyone to be totally supportive, 
through effective identification and ongoing communications, hopefully the pro­
gram manager and his or her team can work with any stakeholders who are nega­
tive, determine why they are not supportive, and address their concerns as much 
as possible so that, at a minimum, they become neutral toward the program. One 
negative and outspoken stakeholder can have the potential to ensure the program 
does not meet its goals and achieve its benefits. Ongoing and proactive stakeholder 
engagement is critical.

54  ◾  Implementing Program Management
According to the Examination Content Outline (PMI, 2011) a ­high-­level view of 
the key tasks in Stakeholder Management is as follows:
◾
◾Identifying stakeholders
◾
◾Performing stakeholder analysis
◾
◾Negotiating for stakeholder support
◾
◾Generating and maintaining program visibility for stakeholder support to 
achieve the program’s strategic objectives
◾
◾Defining and maintaining communications adapted to the needs of different 
stakeholders to ensure their support
◾
◾Evaluating any risks stakeholders identify and incorporating them into the 
program’s risk management plan
◾
◾Developing and fostering stakeholder relationships thereby improving com­
munications and enhancing their support
The Standard for Program Management—Third Edition (2013) refers to this domain 
as Program Stakeholder Engagement since management of stakeholders is diffi­
cult at best. Stakeholder engagement emphasizes capturing stakeholder’s needs, 
desires, and expectations, analyzing the program’s impact on its stakeholders, 
obtaining and maintaining stakeholder support, managing communications, and 
mitigating resistance. Since programs result in change, stakeholder commitment 
and involvement in the program are essential, especially since some stakeholders 
are the beneficiaries of the program’s benefits. It is a continual theme in program 
management consisting of:
◾
◾Program Stakeholder Identification
◾
◾Program Stakeholder Engagement Planning
◾
◾Program Stakeholder Engagement
Key artifacts in Program Stakeholder Engagement follow.
Stakeholder Register
As stakeholders are identified, listing them in a stakeholder register and maintain­
ing this register is a best practice to follow. It can be done in the stakeholder reg­
ister whether in a spreadsheet or database form. As it may contain some sensitive 
information, the program manager should determine the people who have access 
to it and may decide to omit certain information from widespread distribution. 
This register is prepared in program stakeholder identification in the Standard for 
Program Management—Third Edition (2013).

Program Stakeholder Engagement  ◾  55
Stakeholder Register Instructions
Purpose: The stakeholder register is one of the first documents prepared in the 
program. An initial list of stakeholders is in the business case for the program, 
is refined during the planning process as the stakeholders are identified, and 
then is updated as the program planning continues and during program exe­
cution. Parts of it can be an appendix to the stakeholder engagement plan and 
also to the program communications management plan. It is designed as a 
table, and a description of its contents follows.
	
1.	 Name: List the name of the stakeholder.
	
2.	 Position: It is important to note that some stakeholders may not be aware 
of the program nor may be supportive of it. List the stakeholder’s position 
in the program. Typical examples are:
	
a.	 Program director
	
b.	 Program manager
	
c.	 Project managers
	
d.	 Program sponsor
	
e.	 Customers
	
f.	 Potential customers
	
g.	 Program team members
	
h.	 Project team members
	
i.	 Functional/­department managers
	
j.	 Funding organization
	
k.	 Program management office director
	
l.	 Portfolio manager
	
m.	 Members of the Program Governance Board
	
n.	 Suppliers
	
o.	 Government regulatory agencies
	
p.	 Competitors
	
q.	 Groups (environmental, consumer, or other types of groups affected 
by the program)
	
r.	 Others (people in other programs or other organizational units that 
may require similar resources or may have goals that conflict with or 
complement those of the program; they may benefit from the pro­
gram or be at a disadvantage because of it)
	
3.	 Contact information: List contact information for each stakeholder: 
phone numbers (office and cell), location, and email. For government 
agencies, competitors, and groups, list the name and contact details of the 
principal representatives with an interest in the program.
	
4.	 Areas of influence: State whether the stakeholder has a high level of influ­
ence concerning the program. It typically is based on the stakeholder’s level 
of power and authority. Consider a ranking scale such as the following:

56  ◾  Implementing Program Management
	
a.	 5 = Major influence throughout the program life cycle; should be 
consulted regularly and should meet regularly with the program 
management team.
	
b.	 4 = Involved at certain phases during the program; should be informed 
of progress regularly.
	
c.	 3 = Involved at only one phase of the program’s life cycle; should be 
informed of progress regularly in the area of interest but infrequently 
at other times.
	
d.	 2 = Somewhat interested in the program; should be kept informed of 
the progress of the program from time to time.
	
e.	 1 = Requires limited notification as to the progress of the program.
	
5.	 Program opinion: List whether the stakeholder is considered to be a 
strong supporter of the program, a neutral party, or someone who does 
not believe the program should be pursued. Consider a ranking scale such 
as the following:
	
5 = Strong program advocate
	
4 = Supporter
	
3 = Neutral
	
2 = Limited interest in the program
	
1 = Does not believe the program should be pursued
	
6.	 Program impact: State whether the stakeholder will be directly or indi­
rectly impacted by the outcome of the program. Consider a ranking scale 
such as the following:
	
5 = Direct impact
	
4 = Somewhat impacted
	
3 = Neutral
	
2 = Limited impact
	
1 = No impact
	
7.	 Management strategy: State the approach the program management 
team plans to use to work with this stakeholder. Consider a RACI chart 
such as the following:
	
A	 =	Approves all key documents and decisions as required
	
C	 = Consulted before a decision is made and receives a preliminary 
draft of documents before they are in final form
	
I	 = Informed of progress and can receive documents upon request
	
R	 = Responsible for a critical area in the program
	
8.	 Information requirements: State the stakeholder’s information require­
ments. Consider an approach such as the following:
	
5 = Receives all issued reports and requests others as needed
	
4 = Receives all issued reports
	
3 = Receives monthly reports
	
2 = Receives quarterly reports
	
1 = Receives press releases or general program information

Program Stakeholder Engagement  ◾  57
	
9.	 Responsible team member: State the name and contact information of 
the program team member who will be the principal point of contact for 
work with this stakeholder.
	
10.	 Issues identified: List any issues this stakeholder identifies during the 
course of the program and the date.
	
11.	 Resolution and date: List how these issues were resolved and the date.
	
12.	 Notes: Use this field for any additional notes about the stakeholder.
	
	
In developing the stakeholder register, consider using some of the follow­
ing approaches:
◾
◾Consult your organization’s knowledge repository or lessons learned data 
base for historical Information about stakeholders on other programs in 
the organization
◾
◾Brainstorm potential stakeholders with your team to not only identify 
stakeholders but also to determine their roles and areas of interest
◾
◾Interview your sponsor for suggestions of other stakeholders in addition 
to those in the business case
◾
◾Conduct some interviews using ­open-­ended questions with the key stake­
holders identified to get their ideas as to other stakeholders that may have 
an interest in the program
◾
◾Hold a focus group of different types of stakeholders to help identify others
◾
◾Consult with other program managers in your organization for suggestions
◾
◾Since customers are key stakeholders and many stakeholders can legiti­
mately be viewed as “customers,” use customer relationship management 
(CRM) as an approach to further identify stakeholders and to show their 
relationship to the program. CRM is widely used to manage interactions 
with customers, including capture of comprehensive information about 
them and interaction with and support of them. It could be viewed as 
“contact management on steroids.”
◾
◾Send out questionnaires and surveys to additional people and to stake­
holders that have been identified to make sure no one is overlooked; 
through this approach, more people will feel they are involved in the 
program and will be more committed to it.
	
	
A stakeholder analysis also is recommended. Steps to follow in its devel­
opment are included in the Standard for Program Management—Second 
Edition (2008, p. 230); it is also mentioned in the Third Edition (see 8.1 
and 8.2):
	
1.	 Obtain an understanding of the organization’s culture by using inter­
views, focus groups, and questionnaires and surveys to help determine 
stakeholder attitudes and program communication requirements.

58  ◾  Implementing Program Management
	
2.	 Determine the stakeholder’s degree of opposition or support toward the 
program’s objectives.
	
3.	 Evaluate the extent the stakeholder can influence the program’s outcomes 
by evaluating the stakeholder’s interest level and ability to impact the 
program’s outcomes.
	
4.	 Prioritize stakeholders based on the extent to which they can influence 
the program’s outcomes, positively or negatively.
	
5.	 Develop a stakeholder communication’s strategy and define methods 
to best communicate with stakeholders and how often the stakeholders 
require program information.
	
6.	 Develop the stakeholder register.
	
7.	 Update the stakeholder engagement plan (to be discussed).
	
8.	 Evaluate how receptive the stakeholder is to receiving communications 
about the program.
Stakeholder Inventory
Since there can be such a large number of stakeholders on programs, the stakeholder 
inventory can be a useful approach to group these stakeholders into categories 
and to assist in prioritizing them in terms of their overall impact on the program. 
While it is not mentioned in the Standard for Program Management—Third Edition 
(2013), it was included in the Second Edition, and we believe it is a useful docu­
ment for program managers. Similar to the stakeholder register, it also includes 
sensitive information, and the program manager needs to determine people who 
can access it. We have modified it slightly for compliance with the Third Edition.
Stakeholder Inventory Instructions
The stakeholder inventory will include the following:
Purpose: A brief introductory statement defining the purpose of the stakeholder 
inventory, such as:
The stakeholder inventory is part of the program’s commitment 
to effective stakeholder engagement. It provides a summary of 
each stakeholder’s involvement in the program, his or her possible 
responses, any identified issues, and possible mitigation or enhance­
ment strategies.
	
	
Different stakeholders will have an interest in or influence over the pro­
gram at different times. As the business case is prepared, stakeholder identifi­
cation begins.

Program Stakeholder Engagement  ◾  59
	
	
Then, after the stakeholder register has been prepared, the stakeholder 
inventory can follow. It should complement the program stakeholder engage­
ment plan and support the program communications plan. It is an itera­
tive document that should be reviewed periodically during meetings of the 
program management team and the Governance Board and updated as new 
stakeholders are identified throughout the program.
Stakeholder categories: To set up the inventory, use categories for the pro­
gram’s stakeholders based on the stakeholders in the register. This section lists 
the categories that will be part of the inventory, and it also should consider 
the various roles of the stakeholders, both internal and external.
Stakeholder influence: For each category, determine the stakeholder’s level of 
influence on the program. This section should describe how the stakeholder 
will be impacted by the program and how the stakeholder will influence it. A 
matrix can be prepared. A possible example follows the template.
Possible stakeholder responses: Using the categories and the level of stake­
holder influence in the program, this section lists possible responses to vari­
ous changes that may affect the program or specific areas of interest to the 
stakeholders. For example, some stakeholders may be more concerned about 
different areas than others, such as:
◾
◾Program benefits
◾
◾Program deliverables
◾
◾Program funding/­financial management
◾

Program Stakeholder Engagement Plan
Having identified a list of stakeholders during stakeholder identification and set up 
a stakeholder register and a stakeholder inventory, it is now time to devote some 
thought to how you are going to deal with them. Do not forget that some stake­
holders could be less than friendly just because you ignored or did not involve 
them. A plan to engage these diverse stakeholders is essential and is done in the 
program stakeholder engagement plan (5.2) section in the stakeholder domain in 
the Standard for Program Management—Third Edition (2013).
Program Stakeholder Engagement Plan Instructions
The program stakeholder engagement plan includes the following:
Purpose: A brief introductory statement defining the purpose of the plan, such as:
The program stakeholder engagement plan defines the program’s 
strategy for effective stakeholder engagement throughout the pro­
gram. Also, it ensures their commitment and support of the program. 
It is essential to understand and address the stakeholders’ expecta­
tions and concerns to leverage them to support the program’s busi­
ness case and its continuation throughout its life cycle.
	
	
The program stakeholder engagement plan builds on the organization’s 
strategic plan, the business case, and the program charter. The stakeholder 
register is analyzed in consideration of these documents. This plan serves to 
ensure that stakeholder commitment to the program remains strong.
	
	
This plan should identify guidelines for effective stakeholder engagement, 
provide insight as to how to best engage stakeholders especially to address 
any negative attitudes that any stakeholders may have about the program, 
and include metrics to show the effectiveness of the stakeholder engagement 
process. It considers the program’s effect on the organization’s culture and 
current major issues, and its likelihood to meet resistance and barriers to 
change. It assesses attitudes about the program, expectations about benefit 
delivery, the degree of support or opposition regarding benefits delivery, and 
the stakeholder’s ability to influence the program’s outcome. This plan is 
needed because of the complexities of many programs, the changes to be 
realized by them, and the interdependencies among program components 
and possibly other programs and projects under way in the organization. The 
plan supports the program’s communications management plan and ongoing 
alignment of the program to the organization’s strategic objectives.
	
	
Since this plan relates to the program communications management plan, 
collectively these plans facilitate a clear understanding of issues, explain 

Program Stakeholder Engagement  ◾  63
program goals and objectives, and target the delivery of key messages and 
the engagement of key stakeholders when required. It is used to engage stake­
holders (5.3).
	
	
It is an iterative document that should be reviewed regularly by the pro­
gram management team and the Governance Board as new stakeholders 
become involved in the program at different phases of the life cycle or as other 
stakeholders have new interests in the program.
Stakeholder engagement importance: Stakeholder engagement is a key to suc­
cessful program management. The program management team must work 
to ensure all stakeholders are engaged in the program and are supportive of 
it. This section describes how the program management team will ensure 
stakeholders are actively supporting the program so that any possible negative 
impacts can be easily resolved.
Stakeholder mitigation strategies: When stakeholders do have issues con­
cerning the program, strategies are required to mitigate these negative 
impacts. This section describes the strategies the program management team 
will use to work with these stakeholders. For example, since programs repre­
sent organizational change, it may be appropriate for the program manage­
ment team to conduct training so affected stakeholders understand why the 
program is being conducted so they can best adjust to the resulting changes 
from it. It also may be appropriate to prepare job aids for use once the pro­
gram is transferred to ongoing operations to best handle the impact of the 
program on stakeholders. These job aids could include specific descriptions 
of processes to follow, guidelines to consider, and quick reference guides that 
are readily available.
Stakeholder commitment: This section describes the approaches the program 
management team will use to ensure that the stakeholders remain committed 
to the program. It includes metrics to gauge the level of stakeholder participa­
tion, the positive contributions stakeholders make to the attainment of the 
program’s benefits, and the frequency of communications with the program 
manager and the team as well as metrics to assess the effectiveness of overall 
stakeholder engagement by the program manager and the team.
Stakeholder feedback: The program management team also must ensure that 
stakeholders have embraced the changes and that the mitigation strategies 
that have been prepared are effective. This section describes how the program 
management team will obtain feedback from stakeholders concerning these 
mitigation strategies to see if changes are required. It also will state the need 
for change orders as appropriate, whether the changes will result in the need 
to update any other program documents, and specific responsibility to imple­
ment the changes as necessary.
Approvals: This section contains the written approval of the stakeholder 
engagement plan by the program sponsor, program manager, members of the 
Governance Board, and others as appropriate.

Component Stakeholder Engagement Guidelines
Since programs consist of projects and ­non-­project work, these components also 
have stakehold­ers and interface with them. They also will likely interface with 
stakeholders at the program level. The program can help the components by sug­
gesting sources of information such as the Guide to the Project Management Body 
of Knowledge (PMBOK Guide)—Fifth Edition (2013), providing ­program-­unique 
guidance, and defining appropriate contact boundaries. These guidelines are noted 
in 5.2, Stakeholder Engagement Plan, in the Standard for Program Management—
Third Edi­tion (2013).
Component Stakeholder Engagement Guidelines Instructions
Purpose: Stakeholder engagement is equally as important at the component 
(project and ­non-­project work) level as it is at the program level.
	
	
Each component will have stakeholders who will impact and influence 
the component. One recommended practice is for the program management 
team to issue stakeholder engagement guidelines to its components.
	
	
This document presents some guidelines for consideration as to how each 
component should effectively engage its stakeholders for component and pro­
gram success. These guidelines should be reviewed periodically and updated 
as required:
	
1.	 As each component begins, the component manager and his or her team 
should identify relevant stakeholders and determine their level of inter­
est in the component and influence over it. They may wish to interview 
stakeholders or to survey them as part of the identification process. They 
should document the results of their stakeholder identification in a regis­
ter, similar to that at the program level.
	
2.	 The component managers should maintain this register of these stakeholders 
and should meet with them periodically to address their issues and concerns.
	
3.	 The component manager should ensure that the stakeholders receive 
the information they need regarding the status of the component, as 
stated in the component’s program communications management plan. 
Information should be distributed according to the information distribu­
tion process.
	
4.	 The component managers should ensure that the information provided 
to the stakeholders meets their needs and should request feedback from 
them. Stakeholders, for example, may request other information about 
project performance, and this request may show a need to more actively 
engage the stakeholder and to update the information that is provided.
	
5.	 Component managers should work with the program management team 
to prepare the program stakeholder engagement plan. A joint planning 
session also is recommended as stakeholders involved with one component 

Program Stakeholder Engagement  ◾  67
may also be involved with other components, and these stakeholders then 
should receive higher priority at the program level in the program stake­
holder engagement plan and the stakeholder inventory.
	
6.	 Component managers should inform the program manager about any 
issues they have with their stakeholders, as these issues may affect other 
components or the entire program.
	
7.	 If the component manager cannot resolve the stakeholder issues, he or she 
should ask the program manager for assistance and resolve the issues in a 
timely way.
	
8.	 Periodically, component managers should meet as a group to review these 
guidelines with the program manager and his or her team.
	
9.	 The guidelines also should be reviewed when the work of the component 
is complete and is transitioned to an operational unit or to the customer, 
or if the work of the component is terminated for any reason.
	
10.	 When new components are added to the program, the program manage­
ment team should meet with the component manager to review these guide­
lines, explain their purpose, and solicit any suggestions for improvement.
	
11.	 Based on these feedback sessions, it may be necessary to revise these 
guidelines. If so, a member of the program management team should be 
assigned to implement these changes and inform the component manag­
ers of the updated guidelines.
	
12.	 The guidelines should be accessible by any member of the team.
Program Stakeholder Inquiry Register
In (5.3) the Standard for Program Management—Third Edition (2013) introduces 
an interesting type of program management detail, mentioning the natural curios­
ity of stakeholders and resultant questions. These questions generally would not be 
classified as issues, so they must be handled in some way. The manner in which they 
are subsequently addressed (and not forgotten) could be in the form of an issue or 
even a risk, and the result could have an impact on various plans, including but not 
limited to, the communications management plan.
While these inquiries could be placed into an issue register, one way to capture 
them would be in a stakeholder inquiry register. In any event, the description of 
such a registry below illustrates how these requests may be handled.
Program Stakeholder Inquiry Register Instructions
The program stakeholder inquiry register includes the following:
Purpose: A brief introductory statement defining the purpose of the program 
stakeholder inquiry register, such as:

68  ◾  Implementing Program Management
This register captures gaps in the understanding of stakeholders for 
resolution. These gaps are determined when stakeholders ask ques­
tions through any communication channel and can be addressed 
through updates to the communications plan or the contents of the 
communications it prescribes. Register entries may result in genera­
tion any combination of issues, risks, or change requests.
	
1.	Inquiry identification number: Assign a number to the customer inquiry.
	
2.	Date: State the date on which the inquiry was entered.
	
3.	Originator: Enter the name and contact information of the person entering 
the item into the registry. If this is not the person who received the request, 
include that person’s name and contact information as well.
	
4.	Inquirer: Enter the name and contact information of the stakeholder or 
other entity posing the inquiry.
	
5.	Owner: Record the name and contact information for the program person 
designated to handle the inquiry to resolution.
	
6.	Status: Record the status as either: Open, Owner Assigned, or Closed.
	
7.	Inquiry description: Describe the inquiry, including, if appropriate, the rea­
son why this additional communication was necessary.
	
8.	Impact: Briefly describe the impact of the inquiry on cost, schedule, scope, 
benefits, documentation, quality, and any other significant aspects of this and 
other programs.
	
9.	Proposed resolution: Enter the actions proposed to address the inquiry and, 
where appropriate, address the root cause of the inquiry.
	 10.	Resolution action notes: Record notes documenting the final resolution of 
the inquiry, such as issue number generated, specific report modified, etc.
	 11.	Notes: Use this field for any additional notes about the inquiry.
Stakeholder Impact and Issue Tracking Prioritization
Throughout the program with the numerous stakeholders involved Section 5.3 of 
The Standard for Program Management—Third Edition (2013) notes that an impact 
and issue tracking and prioritization tool is useful as there will be issues, which 
the program team will need to track to closure. We have prepared a template that 
you can use and tailor as appropriate as a Program Issue Register described in 
Chapter 7C in this book.
Program Communications Management Plan
Lots of internal and external stakeholders will be interested in what you are doing 
and how the program is progressing. Communications management and stakeholder 

Program Stakeholder Engagement  ◾  69
engagement are closely related and are ongoing throughout the program as noted 
in The Standard for Program Management—Third Edition (2013). The Standard 
points out the importance of communications planning in Section 8.1.1 and is 
not kidding when it says communications planning is vital to program success. 
You need to decide how much of which information is sent to whom, how, and 
how often. For example, if you give just a little more information than a particular 
stakeholder needs—airing issues that you know will ultimately be resolved—you 
could wind up spending too much of your time answering questions about matters 
some stakeholders do not need to worry about yet. On the other hand, transparency 
demands that bad news gets to the right people in a timely manner. A balance is 
in order, and it is part of the art of program management. For example, failure to 
have a publishing schedule will mean missed deadlines for reports. Your program 
communications management plan addresses these issues and more.
Program Communications Management Plan Instructions
The program communications management plan includes the following:
Purpose: A brief introductory statement defining the purpose of the program 
communications management plan, such as:
The program communications management plan describes the pro­
cess of determining the information and communications needs of 
the program stakeholders and states which stakeholders need what 
information, to what granularity, when they need it, how it will be 
given to them, and by whom.
	
	
This plan builds on the stakeholder engagement plan, which is developed 
earlier in the program. In fact, once the program communications manage­
ment plan is approved, the stakeholder engagement plan can become an 
appendix to it, and the stakeholder register can be reviewed for needed updates 
(5.1). Effective communications are essential for program success. Program 
communications create a bridge between the various stakeholders in the pro­
gram, connecting various cultural and organizational backgrounds, different 
levels of expertise, and various perspectives and interest in program execution. 
Although the plan is drafted early in the program, it is an iterative document 
that should be further refined as the program moves through the phases of the 
life cycle, especially since its development may entail the need to create addi­
tional deliverables. If the latter is the case, then the program work breakdown 
structure, program schedule, and program budget also will require updates.
Stakeholder communications requirements: This section builds on the stake­
holder engagement plan as it describes the communications requirements 
of the program stakeholders. These requirements are defined by combining 

70  ◾  Implementing Program Management
the type and format of the information needed with an assessment of the 
value of the information. It is important to ensure that program resources are 
expended only on communications that lead to program success, or where a 
lack of information may lead to program failure.
Information to be communicated: This section describes the information to be 
communicated, including language, format, content, and level of detail. As with 
many plan elements, this information will not be completely known at the out­
set. While all stakeholders require information about the program, the informa­
tion needs of stakeholders vary greatly and may change during various program 
phases in the life cycle. To be effective, the information must be communicated 
in the right format, at the right time, and with the right impact. Efficiency also 
is important, as it focuses on providing only the information that is needed.
Program team member responsibilities: This section states which program 
team member is primarily responsible for the communications requirements 
of each of the program stakeholders.
People to receive the information: This section describes the specific people 
or organizational units that will receive each type of information that will be 
communicated. This section may change based on the stage of the process in 
the program life cycle, as different groups will have different levels of interest. 
Not everyone needs to communicate with everyone else; however, people do 
require information based on their roles and responsibilities in the program 
and their specific areas of interest.
Methods or technologies to use to convey the information: This section 
describes the methods to use to transfer information to the program stake­
holders. Methods range from brief conversations to extended meetings or 
from ­one-­page reports of progress to detailed status reports. To prepare this 
section consider factors such as the urgency of the need for the information, 
the available technology, the expected program staffing, the program dura­
tion, and the program environment.
Frequency of information to be provided: This section describes the frequency 
of information to be provided to each of the program stakeholders. Some 
stakeholders will require information on a daily basis, while others may only 
need program information before a stage gate review of the Governance Board.
Escalation process for communications issues: This section describes how 
communications issues will be escalated from project managers or program 
team members to the program manager or from the program manager to the 
sponsor or to the Governance Board. It should include time frames to resolve 
any issues at each level.
Methods to update the program communications management plan: This 
section describes the specific methods to use to update the program com­
munications management plan as the program ensues. It is important to 

Program Stakeholder Engagement  ◾  71
ensure that stakeholders receive the required information. If a number of 
issues surface that require escalation, this can serve as a trigger to update the 
plan. Similarly, if new stakeholders have an interest in the program, it may be 
appropriate to update the plan.
Glossary of common terminology: Each program has certain terms that are used 
by the various program stakeholders. Similarly, standard program manage­
ment terms also are used. The same acronym may have vastly different mean­
ings in different organizations. This section contains a glossary of common 
terms that stakeholders can use who are interested in the program to ensure 
there are no misunderstandings that can lead to communications breakdowns.
Guidelines for meetings and ­e-­mail: Meetings and ­e-­mail are common methods 
to distribute program information. This section describes how meetings are to 
be held: whether they are formal or informal, or collocated or ­e-­meetings. It 
states the need for an agenda for each meeting, for minutes to be taken and 
distributed, and for action items or issues to be recorded and reviewed at sub­
sequent meetings. This section also describes guidelines for the use of ­e-­mail. 
It is important to ensure that guidelines are set as to how to identify critical 
program information, a specific timetable as to when a response is required, 
when an ­e-­mail should be sent to the entire program team or to only key team 
members, manual or automated archiving processes, and the need for confi­
dentiality and security requirements for certain information in ­e-­mails.
Approvals: This section contains the written approval of the program com­
munications management plan by the program sponsor, program manager, 
program management office director, members of Governance Board, and 
other stakeholders.

Communications Log/­Stakeholder Engagement Log
Your program cannot be sure of consistent and uniform information without a 
communications log or a stakeholder engagement log. It consists of meeting min­
utes, ­e-­mails, reports and memos, presentations, etc. It is usually implemented in a 
Web portal or perhaps a database.
Communications Log/­Stakeholder Engagement Log Instructions
Purpose: The communications log or stakeholder engagement log is used through­
out the program to document program communications to the various pro­
gram stakeholders. It also is used to show other communication items that were 
not in the program communications management plan but were requested by 
stakeholders, and how the stakeholders received the needed information. These 
data then are used to determine whether changes to the program communica­
tions management plan and/­or the stakeholder engagement plan are warranted. 
This log is prepared by a program team member or the program manager.
	
	
This communications log complements the program communications 
management plan.
	
	
The communications log is designed as a table, and a description of its 
contents follows:
	
1.	 Communications requirement: List the stakeholder communications 
requirement as described in the program communications management plan.
	
2.	 Type of communication: State the type of communication. Examples 
include upcoming meetings, meeting agendas, status reports, memos, 
press releases, risk register, benefit register, program schedule, financial 
reports, meeting minutes, formal reports, lessons learned, newsletters, etc.
	
3.	 Frequency: State how often the specific type of communication is to be 
prepared. Examples include daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, at the end 
of a phase gate or program review, at the end of an audit, according to 

76  ◾  Implementing Program Management
schedule milestones, when deliverables are completed, at the end of the 
program, etc.
	
4.	 Prepared by: List the person who prepared the communications item 
and his or her contact information.
	
5.	 Delivered to: List the people who received the communications item and 
their contact information.
	
6.	 Delivery method: State how the communication was delivered, e.g., 
­e-­mail, posted in a discussion forum or in a blog, hard copy, newsletter, 
demonstrations, brochures, etc.
	
7.	 Date: State the date the communications item was delivered.
	
8.	 Feedback measures: State the approach used by the program manage­
ment team to determine if the communications item was considered 
effective by the recipients, such as an interview, phone call, ­e-­mail, or 
survey. Use this column to determine whether the communications item 
was considered effective and addressed the stakeholder’s requirements to

Communications Strategy
According to the Standard for Program Management—Third Edition (2013), in sec­
tion 8.1.2.1, being an effective communicator is a core competency for program 
managers. Since the program manager is the key communicator, the Standard sug­
gests that he or she develop a communications strategy, which is used throughout 
the program. It notes it may be only a ‘quick reference’ for the program manager in 
order that each stakeholder receives the information he or she needs about the pro­
gram. This strategy builds on the stakeholder register, the stakeholder engagement 
log or communications log, and the program communications management plan. 
It is updated regularly as stakeholders and messages change

Communications Strategy Instructions
The communications strategy includes the following:
Purpose: A brief introductory statement defining the purpose of the communi­
cations strategy, such as:
The communications strategy ensures that stakeholders receive the 
information they need about the program.
	
	
Communications are especially important on programs given the numer­
ous stakeholders involved, the high level of interest in the outcomes of the 
program in terms of achieving benefits, and the link between the program’s 
objectives and the organization’s strategic objectives.
	
	
It is suggested in section 8.1.2.1 as a reference guide for the program man­
ager in program communications considerations in the Standard for Program 
Management—Third Edition (2013), but it is an iterative document and 
should be reviewed on a periodic basis to ensure that stakeholders receive the 
information they need in a timely way and that the information provided is 
relevant and accurate.
Organization’s communications strategy: If the organization has a commu­
nications strategy, it should be noted in this section. The section also should 
state whether this strategy is to be used without change or whether tailoring 
is needed to meet the specific program requirements. If this strategy is to be 
used without any changes, there is no need to complete the rest of this tem­
plate except for the approvals section.
Constraints: This section documents those items that may limit the program 
team’s communications options. Examples are stakeholders who are located 
in different geographic areas to ensure they are not affected adversely when 
virtual meetings are held; the need to use a common language for commu­
nications, such the standard English vocabulary of 4,000 words; an inability 
to access common systems because of the lack of software compatibility; and 
the use of different technical capabilities.
Assumptions: This section describes those items that are considered to be true, 
real, or certain concerning the communications strategy but for which ade­
quate validation is not available. Examples may be regulatory requirements, 
changes in technology, the need to consult with advisory boards, media 
involvement at certain phases of the program, involvement of consumer 
groups, terms and conditions and other confidential clauses in contracts, and 
organizational requirements.
Information transfer from components to the program: This section states the 
format and process the components will use to transfer information from the 

78  ◾  Implementing Program Management
component to the program and how often information will be transferred. It 
also describes the mechanisms to ensure that the information that is transferred 
is timely and accurate. To ensure stakeholders receive needed information, major 
component milestones should be addressed as part of the program’s master 
schedule, and information should be provided when these milestones are met.
Assessment of potential communications channels: This section states the 
potential communications channels in the program given the number of 
stakeholders. The program manager then can determine who needs to com­
municate with whom and how often communications should occur in order 
that there is an optimal exchange of information with stakeholders.
Resolution of stakeholder issues and concerns: This section describes the 
methods to be used to resolve any stakeholder issues and concerns. It describes 
how component managers will escalate issues to the program manager. It 
states the items the program manager can resolve on his or her own and the 
process to use to escalate items to the Governance Board for resolution.
Approvals: This section contains the written approval of the communications 
strategy by the program sponsor, program manager, program management 
office, members of the Governance Board, and others as appropriate.

Chapter 6
Governance
Effort and courage are not enough without purpose and direction.
—John F. Kennedy
Since the 1980s, there has been increased attention in organizations of various types 
as to the importance of programs and projects as strategic assets. Increasingly, the 
management by projects/­programs is a reality,
In programs because of their longer duration and the projects and ­non-­project 
work that comprise them, a Governance Board (or a Steering Committee or 
Program Board) typically is used to ensure the program continues to support the 
organization’s strategic objectives and to approve the program to move to a new 
stage gate when appropriate. The Governance Board also can conduct periodic per­
formance reviews and serve as a forum for the program manager to raise issues and 
risks for resolution when he or she feels that they require additional attention or if 
they may affect other program or project work elsewhere in the organization.
As the program is approved based on its business case, a Governance Board, 
often a Portfolio Review Board, makes the decision that it should be part of the 
portfolio. In most organizations, a different Governance Board then works with 
the program as it moves throughout the life cycle. Some programs may have mul­
tiple Governance Boards for complex programs, ones that are part of a consortium, 
or ones that may have government and private sector organizations. On some pro­
grams, the program manager and his or her team serve as a Governance Board for 
the projects and ­non-­project work of the program; however, the best practice is for 
the program to have a single Governance Board as recommended in the Standard 
for Program Management—Third Edition (2013).

82  ◾  Implementing Program Management
A ­high-­level description of the tasks in the Examination Content Outline (PMI, 
2011) for the Governance domain follows:
◾
◾Develop program and project management standards and structure using 
best practices to promote efficiency and consistency among projects and pro­
gram objectives
◾
◾Select a governance model to deliver program objectives in alignment with 
organizational governance requirements
◾
◾Obtain authorization and approvals through stage gate reviews
◾◾Evaluate key performance indicators to monitor benefits throughout the life cycle
◾◾Develop and use the program management information system and integrate pro­
cesses to manage program information and communicate status to stakeholders
◾
◾Evaluate new and existing risks that impact strategic objectives
◾◾Establish escalation processes to ensure risks are handled at the appropriate level
◾
◾Develop and contribute to an information repository with lessons learned 
from programs
◾
◾Identify and apply lessons learned to foster future program or organiza­
tional improvement
◾
◾Monitor the business environment to ensure the program remains aligned 
with the organization’s strategic objectives
◾
◾Develop and support the program integration management plan to further 
support program strategic objectives
This list shows the importance of governance as a major theme in program management.
The Standard for Program Management—Third Edition (2013) focuses as well 
on the importance of governance as a domain emphasizing the importance of a 
governance structure to best achieve the program’s planned benefits. It shows the 
relationship of governance to benefit management and the interaction as well with 
stakeholder engagement, since members of the Governance Board are key stake­
holders. It further states that in terms of program management success by incorpo­
rating it into business processes requires a strong emphasis on governance among 
other items. Therefore, processes and procedures for program management over­
sight and decision making are required.
Suggested artifacts for this domain follow.
Program Governance Plan
As discussed, while this topic may seem to be somewhat mundane, at first glance, it 
is a prominent area of current interest to ensure programs remain in alignment with 
the organization’s strategic objectives. Entire books are devoted to various aspects 
of governance.

Governance  ◾  83
When some aspect of the program threatens to get out of control, action is 
required. Resulting ­inter-­organizational and ­intra-­organizational struggles can be 
divisive and counterproductive. Who has the authority to make such decisions, 
and how will they keep tabs on things? Of course, at times, the program manager 
may be too close to the situation to know what should be done. The governance 
process is the answer. Thus, the importance of preparing governance plan (6.2.4) 
and establishing a program governance structure process (6.2.4.2) in the Standard 
for Program Management—Third Edition (2013) is clear.
Program Governance Plan Instructions
The program governance plan includes the following:
Purpose: A brief introductory statement defining the purpose of the program 
governance plan, such as:
The governance plan describes the process that will be followed to 
execute the program’s governance activities. Its focus is on goals, 
structure, roles and responsibilities, and overall logistics for the 
Governance Board. It serves to ensure the program’s goals remain 
in alignment with the strategic goals of the organization and that its 
proposed benefits will be met.
	
	
The program governance plan is a subsidiary plan to the program man­
agement plan. Effective program governance is key to successful program 
management. The program Governance Board is a major stakeholder in every 
program, to focus on benefits realization, stage gate reviews, and effective 
decision making. The Governance Board, also known as a steering commit­
tee, oversight committee, or the Board of Directors, in many organizations, 
emphasizes proactive actions rather than the need for corrective actions. The 
Governance Board, as noted through this plan, serves to identify, analyze, 
and respond to internal and external events in the program and to change, 
initiate, terminate, or transition components as required. The governance 
plan states the process to ensure that decisions are made in a timely manner 
to not impede program progress.
	
	
This plan is an iterative document and should be reviewed periodically by 
the program management team and the members of the Governance Board, 
as the work of the program continues throughout the various phases in its 
life cycle.
	
	
In the Project Management Institute’s Standard for Program Management—
Third Edition (2013), the Governance Board may be the approval authority 
for the business case (3.1.1) and the program charter (8.3.1.6).

84  ◾  Implementing Program Management
Goals: This section describes the goals for program governance, such as the 
importance of ensuring that the program remains in alignment with the orga­
nization’s strategic goals and objectives. It lists the goals for each of the pro­
gram’s components as well as the goals for the overall program and how the 
benefits will be delivered. It describes how progress toward these goals will be 
communicated. Additionally, it ensures that interfaces between the program 
with other programs, projects, and ongoing operations within the organiza­
tion are managed effectively to minimize conflicts and maximize opportu­
nities. Furthermore, this section discusses the role of risk management in 
governance activities. Recognizing that often programs involve alliances with 
other organizations, this section describes the adherence to key policies, pro­
cedures, and standards as applicable.
Organizational structure: This section describes the structure of the 
Governance Board. Existing organizational charts are used since they show 
accountabilities and authority levels within the organization. Also, different 
programs in the organization will use different structures, meaning that the 
emphasis in this section is to determine a structure that will facilitate effective 
program governance.
Roles and responsibilities: This section lists the members of the Governance 
Board and the Board’s specific responsibilities. It should be noted that while 
consensus is desired among the Board members, it is not a prerequisite. An 
executive director or a program sponsor typically chairs the Board and is the 
ultimate decision maker. This individual generally is a senior manager and 
provides organizational resources to the program. He or she has overall respon­
sibility for program success. If partner organizations are part of the program, 
they should be represented on the Governance Board. On certain programs, 
the customer may be represented. This section states the involvement of the 
portfolio manager, business change manager, functional managers, program 
sponsor, program manager, director of the program management office, proj­
ect managers, and program team members as appropriate in terms of serv­
ing as Board members or in interactions with the Board. This section also 
describes specific accountabilities for benefits realization, communication 
with stakeholders, and oversight of the program and its components.
Governance decisions: This section describes the ­decision-­making approach 
the Board will follow. It states how decisions will be documented and com­
municated to program stakeholders, perhaps through the use of a governance 
decision register. It also describes an escalation process to follow if the Board 
does not feel it is empowered to make certain types of decisions. Since deci­
sions of the Board impact the overall benefits delivery of the program and 
strategic alignment, each member of the Board should be aware of the orga­
nization’s strategic plan, vision, mission, and values.
Meeting schedule: This section presents an overview of the frequency of the 
Governance Board’s meetings. Regularly scheduled meetings should be 

Governance  ◾  85
shown on the program’s schedule. It also notes that meetings may be called 
as needed and criteria to consider as to when to call an ad hoc meeting. It 
describes the process to be used to conduct each meeting, including respon­
sibilities for handling logistics, preparing and distributing the agenda, tak­
ing and distributing meetings, escalating issues as required and documenting 
decisions that are made. It describes others who can attend various meetings. 
It lists phase gate meetings and program ‘health’ checks or periodic progress 
review meetings.
Gate review requirements: Since programs typically span a longer duration 
than projects and are more complex, phase-gate reviews are a recommended 
best practice, especially when programs have completed a phase in the life 
cycle. This section states the requirements for these reviews. They serve as 
go/­no-­go decisions. These gate reviews assist in overall program monitoring 
and control to ensure that not only is the program being managed effectively 
but also program components are being managed as planned. These reviews 
also provide a way to assess the strategic and quality criteria, such as ensuring 
that the program remains aligned with the organization’s overall strategic 
direction; that program benefits are being realized as planned; that the level 
of risk to the program is one that fits the organization’s overall tolerance for 
risks; that variances in scope, schedule, and cost are consistent with the orga­
nization’s practices; and that best practices in program management continue 
to be followed. This section discusses what will occur at these reviews, when 
they will be scheduled, the items to be covered, roles and responsibilities, and 
measurement criteria.
Program performance review requirements: In addition to gate reviews, the 
Governance Board typically reviews the program at various times. These 
reviews concentrate on overall program performance and management and 
to ensure planned benefits will be realized and ultimately sustained. They 
evaluate existing plans to see if they are effective or require changes; the pro­
gram tools and techniques that are being used, such as the program manage­
ment information system; overall performance against desired outcomes and 
benefits realization; alternatives to contribute to overall program success; and 
whether the existing processes and procedures remain helpful or need change.
Process to initiate, terminate, and transition components: The Governance 
Board approves the initiation of new components to be part of the program 
and determines whether a component should be terminated because it has 
completed its deliverables and delivered its expected benefits or should be ter­
minated because it no longer is supportive of the program’s goals and objec­
tives. It also approves when a component should be transitioned to ongoing 
operations, such as to a product or customer support group, or to the cus­
tomer when it has completed its goals and objectives and its benefits have 
been realized. This section describes the process the Board follows for initia­
tion, termination, and transition, and the criteria it uses.

86  ◾  Implementing Program Management
Process to close the program: Additionally the Governance Board makes the 
recommendation regarding program closure. This section describes the pro­
cess that is followed to ensure the recommendations for closure support the 
organization’s strategic goals and objectives.
Issue escalation process: On programs, project and operations managers may 
escalate issues to the program manager for resolution, and the program man­
ager in turn may escalate them the Governance Board. This section descries 
the issue escalation process to be followed at all levels and notes when key 
stakeholders need to be part of it.
Program success criteria: Different success criteria are appropriate for each 
program. This section states the minimum success criteria for the program 
and the metrics to be used to assess progress.
Program approach and plans: The Governance Board is responsible for approv­
ing the overall program approach and also for approving the approach each 
component will use. This section states the process to be followed and also 
the approach to be used to manage and control the program’s components.
Assessment of effectiveness: On a periodic basis, it is incumbent to ensure 
that the program governance plan is effective and to determine whether any 
changes are required to it. It also is necessary to see whether or not the prin­
ciples set forth in this plan are being followed. This section describes how 
effectiveness is determined and who is responsible for this evaluation.
Approvals: This section contains the written approval of the governance man­
agement plan by its members and any other key stakeholders as appropriate.

Change Management Plan
According to the Standard for Program Management—Third Edition (2013), program 
managers accept and embrace change—more so than project managers. Change 
is inevitable. Success requires control of change and, where that is not possible or 
desirable, adaptation to it. While this plan possibly could be included in any of 
the domains according to the Standard for Program Management—Third Edition 
(2013), we have elected to include it here since section 6.2.10 focuses on the impor­
tance of monitoring progress and the need for change. As noted, the Governance 
Board determines the types of changes a program manager should be able to decide 
alone and the types that should be escalated to the Board. The objective is to enable 
the Governance Board to provide support when changes are required. The goal is to 
position the program to best respond to any changes that occur at the organizational 
level so it can continue to support the organization’s strategic goals and deliver its 
benefits. A change management plan is a guidebook to make this happen.
Change Management Plan Instructions
The change management plan will include the following:
Purpose: A brief introductory statement defining the purpose of the change 
management plan, such as:
The change management plan describes the processes and proce­
dures to influence and manage program changes. It outlines the 
approaches to follow when there is a program change and assesses its 
impact on the overall program.

Governance  ◾  91
	
	
It also analyzes the impact of changes on the overall outcome of the pro­
gram and assigns roles and responsibilities to ensure the impact of the change 
is assessed appropriately, especially since other programs may be affected. It 
focuses on factors that may influence program change to maximize them for 
the benefits of the program. It helps to coordinate changes across the program.
	
	
Although the plan is drafted early in the program, it is an iterative doc­
ument that should be further refined as the work of the program continues 
throughout the various phases in its life cycle. It involves redirecting or modify­
ing the program as required based on changes that do in fact occur. It identifies 
standard change process information used within the organization as well as 
­program-­specific information. It should be provided to all program stakeholders.
Definition of the change process: This section describes the change pro­
cess to be followed in the program. It differentiates between program 
changes and product/­services/­results changes accordingly but integrates the 
product/­services/­results changes into the overall plan. It notes that changes 
may be either internal to the program or external to it. It identifies the key 
stakeholders who may be involved and the communication process to follow. 
It describes how the program manager must communicate the importance of 
changes to affected stakeholders. The program manager must plan for change, 
provide resources and support for changes, monitor and track changes, pro­
vide feedback on changes to stakeholders, and manage any issues stakeholders 
may have with each change. It states that changes may be approved, deferred, 
or rejected; the types of changes to be escalated to the Governance Board; the 
priority of the change; and its severity in terms of the program. It describes 
the specific roles and responsibilities of the program stakeholders, including 
Governance Board members, regarding change management.
Change type: This section shows the types of changes that may occur in the 
program. Some changes may be mandatory, while others are ones that may 
benefit the program or may clarify an existing requirement. The emphasis is 
on consideration of the implications of each change in terms of its impact 
on the program’s goals or the organization’s strategic goals. Regardless, dif­
ferent types of changes will then require different levels of detail to be pro­
vided concerning the change and will require different approval conditions. 
Some changes will involve more risks than others. The type of change also 
may impact other program documents that may require modification if the 
change is approved and implemented.
Identification of controlled/­configuration items: This section describes the 
controlled items in the program, sometimes referred to as configuration items. 
The emphasis of the identification of the items to be controlled should focus 
on physical items, documents, forms, and records. They are items that may 
be legal and regulatory requirements, health and safety guidelines, ones that 
are sent to contractors, ones that have an impact on the process or deliverables 
that are outside of the current program, and ones that involve the program’s 

92  ◾  Implementing Program Management
deliverables. For example, certain program artifacts, such as the ­program 
charter, program work breakdown structure, program management plan, pro­
gram governance plan, benefits realization plan, stakeholder engagement plan, 
approved schedule, approved budget, risk register, metrics, and contracts, are 
examples of possible controlled items or configuration items that require con­
trol. Each configuration item should be uniquely identified for control, pro­
cessing, and tracking. Ideally, the configuration item should be linked to the 
program work breakdown structure program package identification number.
Change evaluation and approval processes and procedures: This section 
describes how a change request is to be used, how the change request will be 
analyzed, how decisions will be made based on the change impact analysis, 
and metrics to be reported as to the impact of the change. It notes the impor­
tance of documenting all change requests. It also describes how notifications 
to stakeholders regarding the disposition of the change will be made, states 
the process to implement the approved changes, and verifies that the imple­
mentation has occurred.
Change control: This section describes the process to be followed for change 
control. It explains how the change management process is integrated with 
the program management information system. It notes the importance of a 
full audit trail and reporting of the status of change requests. It describes how 
specific change control systems, such as those for contracts or cost, are part of 
an integrated change control system across the program.
Change status accounting and metrics: This section describes how informa­
tion about the changes is communicated, and actions are validated. It serves 
as a feedback mechanism for the overall program change management pro­
cess. It describes the process to follow to acquire and enter information about 
the change into the appropriate repository. It also provides the data through 
established metrics to validate if the approved changes have been consistent 
with the program’s objectives and can be tracked to its scope and evolution. 
The status of approved changes is tracked to inform the program manager 
and other stakeholders about the results of an approved change. Metrics are 
part of the change management plan and include items such as what was 
changed, when it was changed, what impact it has on the previously captured 
data and potential effects of new data, and the impact on other related pro­
grams and projects. The purpose is to assist the program manager in identify­
ing trends in the productivity of implementing various changes, determine 
if estimating techniques are still valid, track customer satisfaction, and track 
rework. The metrics should be ones that are analyzed and used to facilitate 
communication across the program. Ad hoc and periodic reports to be pre­
pared for stakeholders are included in this section.
Change verification and audits: This verification process of this section ensures 
that the program change management goals are achieved through a system­
atic comparison of requirements with the initial, interim, and final results. 

Governance  ◾  93
The audit process of this section ensures that program configuration items 
have been handled according to their defined documentation. The actual pro­
cess used is compared to the documented process to uncover any deficiencies 
or areas for improvement. This section also describes how results from the 
audits will be communicated to program stakeholders.
Updates to other documents: This section describes the type of changes that 
may require the need to update program documents such as the governance 
decision register, the program plan, or the governance plan. It also notes 
changes that may have an impact on the program’s budget and finances, orga­
nizational structure, or roles and responsibilities.
Approvals: This section contains the written approval of the change manage­
ment plan by the program sponsor, program manager, program management 
office director, members of the Governance Board, and other stakeholders.

Change Request Form
Change requests are inevitable, and there are a variety of possible change forms. 
The key here is that this form should be focused at the program level. Change 
requests are discussed in section 6.2.10 in the Governance domain in the Standard 
for Program Management—Third Edition (2013) and while mentioned in other 
parts of the document are included in this part of the book. As noted in the 
Standard for Program Management—Third Edition (2013), many change requests 
at the program level involve modifying the program’s overall strategy, plan, or use 
of resources.
Change Request Form Instructions
Purpose: The change request form is used throughout the program. It is inevi­
table that programs will have changes throughout the program life cycle. The 
component projects also will have changes. Each project should manage its 
changes and use a change request form as well once a change is identified.
	
	
This change request form complements the program’s change manage­
ment plan and change request log.
	
	
The change request form is designed as a table, and a description of its 
contents follows:

Governance  ◾  97
	
1.	 Change identification number: Assign a change number to the change 
request.
	
2.	 Date: The date on which the change request was entered.
	
3.	 Requested by: List the person who requested the change and provide 
contact information.
	
4.	 Change type: Describe the type of change. Use the types in the 
change management plan, such as one involving technical aspects or 
the program’s scope, schedule, cost, benefits, requirements or con­
tracts. List changes such as ones involving a change to the program’s 
strategy, plan, or use of resources.
	
5.	 PWBS number(s): Link the change to the corresponding program pack­
age in the program work breakdown structure.
	
6.	 Change description: Describe the change and why it is significant to the 
program.
	
7.	 Impact: Briefly describe the impact of the change on cost, schedule, 
scope, documentation, quality and any other significant aspects of this 
and other programs. If this is an involved subject, consider using the 
impact analysis format shown in Chapter 7D in this book.
	
8.	 Notes: Use this field for any additional notes about the change such as 
whether the changes are feasible, can be supported operationally, and 
their level of risk.
Change Request Log
A detailed list of all changes, whether approved, rejected, deferred, or modified, 
must be maintained. This log complements the change management plan and 
change request form and is included in this domain as it is stated in section 6.2.10 
in the Standard for Program Management—Third Edition (2013).
Change Request Log Instructions
Purpose: The change request log is used throughout the program to record 
changes as they are identified, and to describe the status of the request.
	
	
It is inevitable that programs will have changes throughout the program 
life cycle. The component projects also will have changes. Each project should 
manage its changes and report them to the program management team, espe­
cially if it seems as if the project change will affect the program. Changes 
should be tracked until they are approved, deferred, or rejected. Once a 
decision is made concerning the change, then the person who requested the 
change should be notified. If the change is implemented, its status should 
continue to be tracked through this log until the implementation is complete. 

98  ◾  Implementing Program Management
It is important to ensure that the benefits to be realized through the program 
are not compromised by the change.
	
	
This change request log complements the program’s change management 
plan. In the Project Management Institute’s Standard for Program Management—
Third Edition (2013), the change request log is noted in section 6.2.10. The 
change request log is designed as a table, and a description of its contents follows:
	
1.	 Change identification number: Assign a change number to the 
change request.
	
2.	 PWBS number: Link the change to the corresponding program package 
in the program work breakdown structure.
	
3.	 Change description: Describe the change and why it is significant to 
the program.
	
4.	 Requested by: List the person who requested the change and provide 
contact information.
	
5.	 Date: State the date the change was requested and added to the log.
	
6.	 Change type: Describe the type of change. Use the types identified in 
the change management plan.
	
7.	 Priority/­severity: Describe the priority of the change request, such as 
emergency, urgent, high, medium, or low. Note the severity, such as cata­
strophic, major, minor, or an enhancement.
	
8.	 Change impact: State the impact of this change to the program. Note 
the configuration items identified in the change management plan that 
are affected.
	
9.	 Cost: Describe the expected cost of the change.
	
10.	 Level of effort: State the level of effort required to implement the change 
if it is approved. Note whether the program’s schedule will require revi­
sion, the other program management processes that will require revision, 
and whether any new program components will be needed or existing 
components terminated.
	
11.	 Feasibility: Describe the feasibility of implementing the change, such as 
technical, environmental, economic, or ethical.
	
12.	 Risk/­opportunity: Describe the risks associated with implementing the 
change to the program or the opportunity associated with implementing 
the change.
	
13.	 Change owner: Identify a member of the program management team to 
be responsible for ensuring that the change request is reviewed, that its 
impact on the program is analyzed, that it is submitted to the appropriate 
person for resolution, that once a decision is made on the change the deci­
sion is communicated to the requestor, and, if the change is approved, 
that this team member continues to track the change until its implemen­
tation is complete.

Governance  ◾  99
	
14.	 Proposed resolution: State the proposed resolution of the change after 
the change impact analysis has been conducted, such as approved, 
deferred, or rejected.
	
15.	 Decision: State whether the proposed resolution was finally approved, 
deferred, or rejected.
	
16.	 Decision maker and actual resolution: State who made the decision 
concerning the change request. Examples include:
	
a.	 Change owner
	
b.	 Program manager
	
c.	 Change control board
	
d.	 Governance Board
	
	
Note if the change is approved, whether the proposed implementation 
of it is to be followed or whether a different implementation process is to 
be used. If the decision was to defer the change, continue to keep it on the 
log until it is either approved or rejected.
	
17.	 Date: State the date the change request was approved, deferred, or rejected.
	
18.	 Subsequent impacts: State any subsequent impacts on other controlled 
or configuration items (see the change management plan) as a result of 
implementation of this change request.
	
19.	 Date closed: State the date the change was implemented.
	
20.	 Notes: Use this field for any additional notes about the change.
­Phase-­Gate Review Agenda
One of the reasons programs continue beyond their usefulness is the lack of a sys­
tematic ­decision-­making process. Phase gates occur at the end of each of the five 
phases described in the Examination Content Outline. In the Standard for Program 
Management—Third Edition (2013) they are discussed in section 6.2.4.5 with the 
explicit purpose of enabling the Governance Board to approve or “gate” from one 
phase to the next. As with any meeting, it is important to have an agenda that 
ensures an orderly and thorough meeting.
­Phase-­Gate Review Agenda Instructions
At different points in the program life cycle, ­phase-­gate reviews will be held as 
described in the program’s governance management plan. They enable the 
Governance Board to assess the program’s progress in meeting its planned ben­
efits according to the benefits realization plan. These reviews also are used to 
approve initiation of program components and to authorize closing or transitioning 
components, according to Project Management Institute’s Standard for Program 
Management—Third Edition (2013). These meetings are used for decisions to move 

100  ◾  Implementing Program Management
from one gate in the program management life cycle to another and to assess prog­
ress against specific criteria. They serve as go/­no-­go decisions to move to the next 
phase in the life cycle and to confirm that generally accepted best practices have 
been followed.
An agenda for these reviews is as follows:
PARTICIPANTS (NAMES/­ORGANIZATION)
Date:

Program overview: The program manager presents a brief overview of the program 
as to why the program was undertaken and where it stands in the program man­
agement life cycle. The purpose is to enable participants to ask questions to see 
that objectives of the program and its components are still in alignment with the 
organization’s strategic objectives.
Deliverables completed: The program manager describes the status of any completed 
deliverables. This section describes the program management processes that are 
being followed so participants can ask questions to ensure that best practices 
are being used.
Benefits realized: The program manager describes the status of the program ben­
efits that have been realized to date. The purpose is to enable participants to 
determine if the benefits are being realized as stated in the benefits realization 
plan and are ones that support the program’s business case.
Exit criteria satisfaction: The program manager describes the exit criteria for the 
previous phase and how it has been satisfied.
Risks: The program manager presents an overview of the risks that have affected the 
program since the last meeting or are expected to affect the program during the 
next phase in the life cycle. The purpose is to enable participants to ask questions 
to determine if the level of tolerance for risks is acceptable to the members of the 
Governance Board and the organization.
Expected date of the next meeting: The program manager states when he or she 
expects the next meeting will be held for planning purposes.
Decisions: This section documents the decisions made during this review.

Program Review Agenda
In addition to the phase gate reviews, it is also useful to hold program reviews. The 
Standard for Program Management—Third Edition (2013) refers to these meetings 
as “periodic health checks,” and they are also in the governance plan. Clearly, these 
review meetings need to be conducted during longer phases on longer programs but 
are less formal and are held between ­phase-­gate reviews. These reviews also need an 
agenda for an orderly and thorough meeting.
Program Review Agenda Instructions
At different points in the program life cycle, program reviews will be held as 
described in the program’s governance management plan. These meetings are used 
in addition to ­phase-­gate reviews to assess overall program performance against 
outcomes and expected benefits and to determine if any preventive or corrective 
actions are needed. Also, since the phases in the life cycle may be long for many 
programs, these reviews provide a way to assess progress on a more frequent basis 
and keep the members of the Governance Board involved in the program to evalu­
ate performance and to see if best practices are being followed. The program man­
ager uses these reviews to focus on areas in the program rather than specifics and 
to describe overall status, concerns, and issues. The program manager also can use 
these reviews to discuss any alternatives with the Governance Board to improve 
opportunities for overall program success. Since these reviews are not go/­no-­go 
decisions, they generally are viewed in a more positive way and are conducted in a 
more informal manner.
An agenda for these reviews is as follows:
PARTICIPANTS (NAMES/ORGANIZATION)

Program overview: The program manager presents a brief ­high-­level overview as to 
why the program was undertaken and where it stands in the program management 
life cycle. He or she should remind participants when the last ­phase-­gate review 
and program review was held. Participants can ask questions to see that objectives 
of the program and its components are still in alignment with the organization’s 
strategic objectives and to see whether the business case requires revision.
Status of milestones and deliverables: The program manager describes the status 
of completed deliverables and those that are expected to be completed in the near 
future as well as the status of key milestones. Participants can ask questions about 

102  ◾  Implementing Program Management
the status of upcoming milestones and deliverables to see whether the schedule 
management plan is being followed and whether the schedule requires updating. 
They also can address customer satisfaction concerns, if any, and can see if the 
scope management plan is being followed.
Benefits status: The program manager describes the status of the program benefits 
that have been realized to date and are coming in the near future. Participants can 
ask questions to determine if the benefits are being realized as stated in the benefits 
realization plan and are ones that support the program’s business case. They also 
can assess whether the benefits are ones that can be sustained.
Resource status: The program manager describes resource use in the program and 
whether additional resources are required or if any dedicated resources can be 
released. The program manager describes whether there are any problems in 
obtaining resources as agreed upon to support the program. Participants can ask 
questions to see that the program resource plan is being followed and to determine 
whether changes are required to the program manager’s charter.
Component status: The program manager states whether any components have been 
transitioned to the customer or to ongoing operations and whether any new com­
ponents are being added to the program. Participants can ask questions to see that 
closeout has occurred according to plans and that benefits are being sustained 
or, if components are being added, whether the program documentation is being 
updated. They can see if the program roadmap remains valid.
Budget status: The program manager provides an overview of the budget and discusses 
key earned value performance metrics, if earned value management is being used. 
Participants can ask questions to see that the financial plan is being followed. The 
Governance Board is responsible for ensuring programs are funded as descried in 
the program plan, and the Governance Board may be responsible for obtaining 
funding if it is provided by external sources.
Change request status: The program manager states the number of change requests 
that have been received and analyzed and explains whether those that have been 
approved have been implemented. The purpose is not only to describe the number 
of change requests to date but to enable participants to see that the change request 
process is being followed and to identify any items of concern that may affect 
future program performance.
Issue status: The program manager provides an overview of the status of issues on 
the program issue log. Participants then can ensure that the program issues log is 
being used and can ask questions about outstanding issues affecting the program. 
Also, the issue resolution process can be discussed to assess its effectiveness.
Stakeholder communications: The program manager uses the communications log 
and discusses communications with stakeholders to show the frequency of com­
munication and to discuss any issues. He or she also describes other requests for 
information from stakeholders and whether these requests have led to the need 
to issue any other formal reports. Participants can ask questions to see that the 
program communications management plan and the program stakeholder engage­
ment plan are being followed and can address any outstanding issues regarding 
program stakeholder engagement.
Risks: The program manager presents an overview of the risks that have affected the 
program since the last meeting or are expected to affect the program in the near 
future using the risk register. Participants can ask questions to determine if the 

Governance  ◾  103
level of tolerance for risks is acceptable and to see that the risk management plan, 
and the proposed risk responses are being followed. They can check on possible 
opportunities that have been identified and how they are being maximized.
Contract status: The program manager provides an overview of the ­contractor/­supplier 
status. He or she describes completed deliverables, any issues, whether agreements 
and contract terms and conditions are being followed, and the need for additional 
contracts in other areas. Participants can ask questions to see that the procurement 
management plan and contracts management plan are being followed.
Lessons learned: The program manager discusses lessons learned in the program to 
date using the lessons learned log. Participants can ask questions to see if program 
management processes and procedures require change, are being used as intended, 
and are adding value to the program. They also may see opportunities to leverage 
these lessons learned to other programs and projects under way in the organization 
or to transfer knowledge assets from other areas to this program. The emphasis 
during this part of the review is to review these lessons learned to improve overall 
program success.
Additional comments: The program manager provides additional comments about the 
program, and participants ask questions in other areas as appropriate.
Expected date of the next meeting: The Governance Board members state when 
they expect to hold the next meeting for planning purposes.
Decisions: This section documents any decisions made during this review.

Issue Escalation Process
Questions surrounding unplanned occurrences must be referred to the program 
from its components (projects and other work), and from the program to orga­
nizational executive management. Seasoned program managers know when it is 
and when it is not important to make those referrals and how to do them properly. 
This is the purview of the issue escalation process noted in the governance plan 
and in section 6.2.4.9 in the Standard for Program Management—Third Edition 
(2013). The issue escalation process is used as the program is executed and moni­
tored and controlled.

104  ◾  Implementing Program Management
Issue Escalation Process Instructions
Purpose: Each program will have issues, or unplanned events, actions, or dis­
putes that may impact program areas and that will need resolution, following 
the program’s governance plan and using the program issues register or log. 
One of the program manager’s responsibilities is to resolve these issues that 
are escalated from program components through a synergistic approach to 
enable the program’s benefits to be realized. It is also a key part of the pro­
gram charter and program management plan to describe the identified risks 
and issues at the beginning of the program so they do not turn into problems 
later during execution. The program manager proactively strives to anticipate 
issues and manage them effectively.
	
	
An issue resolution process can facilitate the steps to follow when there are 
issues that cannot be resolved by a component manager, a team member, or 
the program manager. It is important to recognize that issues may affect any 
aspect of the program or other programs.
	
	
In the Standard for Program Management—Third Edition (2013), this 
issue escalation process part of the Governance domain in 6.2.4.9.
	
	
This document describes an issue escalation process to follow:
	
1.	 Set up the program issues log or register at the beginning of the pro­
gram to identify the issue and to track it throughout the process. Assign 
a number to the issue and link it to the program work breakdown struc­
ture (PWBS) number. Any issues noted in the business case, program 
mandate, and the program charter should be added to the program issues 
register once the program is officially initiated.
	
2.	 Determine if a change request is required for the issue, and if so, have 
someone on the program management team prepare it. Ideally, the change 
request should be prepared by the person who first identified the issue.
	
3.	 Determine the issue’s priority and identify someone on the program 
management team who will be responsible for tracking the progress of 
the issue through its resolution and subsequent implementation. Often, 
the program management office handles the issue log for the program.
	
4.	 Determine whether a feasibility study may be required to help analyze 
the issue and determine the most appropriate way to resolve it, and if so, 
identify a program management team member to conduct this study and 
prepare a plan for it so it can be completed in a timely manner. Use this 
feasibility study as part of the overall issue analysis process to determine if 
additional funding is required for the issue resolution process or to imple­
ment corrective action.
	
5.	 Inform the Governance Board that an issue has been identified through 
a regularly scheduled status report or by other means if it is an issue 
that has been identified to have a major impact on the program or the 

Governance  ◾  105
organization, in case it cannot be resolved by the program manager. The 
Governance Board should be informed as soon as possible in case a spe­
cial meeting may need to be held to resolve the issue.
	
6.	 Review the program manager’s charter to see if he or she has the authority 
to resolve the issue. Typical resolution methods are to accept the issue and 
not require other changes or to change the program management plan 
and other associated documents because of the issue. The issue escalation 
process and the people to be involved typically are covered in the pro­
gram communications management plan and in the Governance plan.
	
7.	 Determine the stakeholders that will be affected by the issue and engage 
them as appropriate in the issue resolution process. Identify possible 
stakeholders who may be affected by reviewing the type of issue as noted 
in the program issues log. Update the stakeholder register accordingly to 
ensure all stakeholder concerns have been addressed.
	
8.	 If the program manager cannot resolve the issue effectively, escalate it 
to the Governance Board for resolution. Even if the program manager 
has the authority to resolve the issue, it may be one that affects other 
programs or projects or the entire organization, so the program manager 
may decide to involve the Governance Board because of the issue’s scope 
and impact.
	
9.	 If the issue is escalated to the Governance Board, the program manager 
should describe the importance of the issue. It may be appropriate to 
have a member of the program management team, or someone from the 
program management office, to facilitate the meeting so a decision con­
cerning the issue can be made quickly and to see that the Governance 
Board members’ questions are answered during the meeting. The pro­
gram manager then should communicate the resolution of the issue after 
the meeting to affected stakeholders, and the team member responsible 
for the program issues log should note the decision in the log.
	
10.	 Ensure that once a resolution for the issue has been determined that cor­
rective actions are taken. Also determine whether preventive actions are 
required so the issue does not surface in the future.
	
11.	 Document the issue and its resolution as part of the lessons learned register.
	
12.	 In the next meeting with the Governance Board, state that the issue has 
been resolved and the corrective actions that have been taken. Note that 
it is part of the lessons learned register in case there are other projects or 
programs under way that could benefit from learning about this issue and 
its resolution.
	
13.	 In a status report that is distributed to stakeholders and members of the 
Governance Board, state that the issue was resolved and describe its resolution.
	
14.	 Ensure that as part of the transition plan after the program is officially 
closed, there is customer support in case a comparable issue arises later 
after the program deliverables are completed.

106  ◾  Implementing Program Management
Component Initiation Request
Programs consist of projects as well as management effort and infrastructure—
known generically as components and ­non-­project work. Can just anyone at any 
time declare a new project to begin using up limited resources? Let’s hope not! 
Business partners can even disagree on whether they agreed to start a project. 
Decisions regarding new components are best handled through a component initia­
tion form so there is no uncertainty. This form is prepared in advance because the 
Governance Board must approve the initiation requests as noted in section 6.2.12 
in the Standard for Program Management—Third Edition (2013).
Component Initiation Request Instructions
The component initiation request includes the following:
Purpose: A brief introductory statement defining the purpose of the component 
initiation request, such as:
The component initiation request describes the need, feasibility, and 
justification for the component to be part of the program.
	
	
Components include both projects and ­non-­project or operations work 
that is part of the program. In most cases, the program manager prepares the 
component initiation request with input from other key stakeholders and 
the program sponsor. It may be provided by the client or the funding orga­
nization. Approval by the Governance Board typically is required especially 
if new governance structures are required or if organizational resources are 
required. This approval serves as the mandate for the component to be part of 
the program.
	
	
While some components already are under way when the program is initi­
ated, other components will become part of the program at different phases 
in the life cycle, except during the closing phase. They are generally included 
in the program roadmap and the program management plan, with explicit 
criteria to show when components are to be initiated. As the work on the 
program ensues, other components that were not previously identified may 
be needed. The component initiation request is a document to secure formal 
approval for program components. Components to be part of the program 
must meet the organization’s approved selection criteria. These criteria typi­
cally are stated in the program’s governance plan. Once approved, a charter 
for the component is prepared and approved, a project manager or operations 
manager is assigned, and the work begins. The actual work to be done then 
follows the guidelines in PMI’s PMBOK® Guide, unless this component is 
a ­sub-­program. Then it would follow guidelines in the Standard for Program 
Management—Third Edition (2013).

In the Project Management Institute’s Standard for Program Management—​
Third Edition (2013), component initiation requests are described in the gov­
ernance plan in section 6.2.12.
Component business case: Each component requires a business case to show 
how its expected benefits will be more significant if it is part of the program 
rather than managed as a ­stand-­alone project or operational activity. This sec­
tion describes the business case for the component. The component’s expected 
results should complement those of the program and should be aligned with 
the organization’s strategic plan and goals. The component also may be inter­
related in various ways to other components in the program. Its financial 
indices must be detailed along with internal and external interfaces. It may 
require compliance with the program’s quality plan. If feasibility studies or 
alternative analyses were conducted, they should be noted in this section.
Project manager or operations manager: This section identifies the project man­
ager or operations manager for the component and provides contact information.
Component sponsor: This section identifies the sponsor for the component and 
provides his or her contact information. In most cases the sponsor is the pro­
gram manager.
Stakeholder communications: Once a component is approved to be part of 
the program, stakeholders will need to be notified. This section states those 
stakeholders who will have an active role with the component, will influence 
the outcome of the component, or will be interested in certain aspects of the 
component, and describes how these stakeholders will be notified of compo­
nent approval.
Component governance structure: While the program has a governance man­
agement plan and uses a Governance Board, components also require a gov­
ernance structure at the program level. This section states the processes and 
procedures to be used to monitor and track component progress. It describes 
gate reviews and performance reviews to be held and specifies status reports 
to be prepared at the component level. It also notes that audits may be con­
ducted at scheduled and nonscheduled times.
Resource requirements: This section provides a ­high-­level estimate of the 
resources required for the component. It may be necessary to transfer 
resources from existing components already under way in the program to 
the proposed component, especially if it has a higher priority than that of the 
existing work. This section states why the various resources are needed and 
when resources need to be available.
Change requests: Once a component is approved, change requests will be 
required. This section states the various change requests that will be needed 
for the specific component when it is approved.
Program documentation changes: Each time a new component is approved, 
program documents will require updates as noted by change requests. This 
section describes each of the program documents that will be updated and 

108  ◾  Implementing Program Management
states the program team member who is responsible and when the updates are 
scheduled to be completed.
Approvals: This section contains the written approval of the component initia­
tion request by the program manager, program sponsor, program manage­
ment office, members of the program’s Governance Board, or any other key 
stakeholders as appropriate.

Component Transition Request
As noted, various components will be initiated during a program. These com­
ponents will transition to ongoing operations, such as to a product or customer 
support group, to customers, or to users at different times during the course of 
the program. The Governance Board will approve the requests to transition these 
components. In the Standard for Program Management—Third Edition (2013), a 

Governance  ◾  111
decision from the Governance Board to transition the component is required as 
stated in section in section 6.2.12.
Component Transition Request Instructions
The component transition request includes the following:
Purpose: A brief introductory statement defining the purpose of the component 
transition request, such as:
The component transition request shows that the component’s ben­
efits have been realized, its business case has been sufficiently satisfied, 
and the component should be transitioned to ongoing operations.
	
	
Components include both projects and ­non-­project or operations work 
that is part of the program. Different components will finish ahead of others 
as noted by completion of project deliverables, completion of ­program-­level 
milestones, and achievement of benefits.
	
	
In most cases, the project manager or operations manager prepares the 
component transition request with input from other key stakeholders and 
the program manager. It may be provided by the client or the funding orga­
nization. The Governance Board typically approves this request. It serves as 
the mandate to ensure the knowledge assets, responsibilities, and benefits are 
ready to be handed over to ongoing operations.
	
	
It is noted that components also will transition from one phase in their life 
cycle to another. This form, though, is used for formal approval for compo­
nent closure, rather than for approval to transition to the next phase in the 
life cycle, as that is covered as part of the program’s governance procedures. 
This transition is the last phase in the component’s life cycle.
	
	
This form is not used to terminate a component when it is apparent that the 
component does not support the program’s objectives and does not contribute 
to the program’s benefits; termination is handled by a termination request.
	
	
In the Project Management Institute’s Standard for Program Management—
Third Edition (2013), the component transition request is described in section 
6.2.12, and in reviewing the recommendation for transition, the Governance 
Board evaluates the component’s business case, ensures stakeholders involved 
with this component have received communications relative to its transition, 
ensures compliance with the program’s quality plan if applicable, assesses 
organization or program lessons learned, and confirms practices for official 
closure have been followed.
Reasons for request: This section describes the reasons for the transition 
request. For example, the component has achieved its specific benefits, has 
met its requirements as stated in the business case, has completed all of its 
deliverables, and/­or has met all ­program-­level milestones.

112  ◾  Implementing Program Management
Resources released: Once the component transition request is approved, resources 
can be reallocated to other parts of the program or to the performing organiza­
tion. This section states the available resources for planning purposes by the 
program manager, program sponsor, and portfolio manager, as appropriate.
Closure requirements: In order for the component to transition to ongoing 
operations, the program’s closing policies and procedures must be met. This 
section states that all closure activities are complete, such as archiving records, 
returning customer property, and documenting lessons learned, as defined by 
the program management plan and governance plan.
Stakeholder communications: Each component will have its own stakehold­
ers, in addition to stakeholders at the program level. This section describes 
how the affected or interested stakeholders will learn that the component is 
formally closed.
Change requests: Once a component is approved for transition, change requests 
will be required. This section states the various change requests that will be 
needed as a result of approval of the transition request.
Program documentation changes: This section states the requirements to 
update ­program-­level documentation because of a component transition 
request, such as the program management plan, program resource plan, deci­
sion log, and program roadmap. It describes the program management team 
member who is responsible for updating the artifacts, and the planned date 
the updates will be completed.
Project completion closure certificate: This section describes who will prepare 
the certificate noting that project completion has occurred and who must 
sign off on it once the transition request is approved.
Approvals: This section contains the written approval of the component tran­
sition request by the program manager, program sponsor, members of the 
program’s Governance Board, or any other key stakeholders as appropriate.

Program Closure Recommendation
Program closure is clearly a major governance issue. Certain issues must be settled 
in the process, such as, for example, whether continuing benefits are transitioned 
to ongoing operations or become a part of another program. In the Standard for 
Program Management—Third Edition (2013), this recommendation is discussed in 
section 6.2.13, Program Governance, in the Governance Domain.
Program Closure Recommendation Instructions
The program closure recommendation includes the following:
Purpose: A brief introductory statement defining the purpose of the program 
closure recommendation, such as:
The program closure recommendation states that all program ben­
efits have been realized, and all deliverables have been completed, so 
the program can be officially closed.
	
	
The program manager prepares this recommendation and presents it to 
the Governance Board as the program then is in the program closure phase in 
its life cycle. Before the recommendation is prepared, the program manager 
should meet with each of the key stakeholders to ensure they support this 
recommendation. The Governance Board documents its recommendation 
to close the program. This decision should be included in the governance 
decision register. This decision then is given to the program sponsor, who 
officially closes the program.
	
	
At this point, the program manager states that all components have been 
completed and have been closed according to the program’s closure policies, 

116  ◾  Implementing Program Management
all lessons learned have been documented, all documents have been archived, 
all resources have been reassigned, and any property provided by others has 
been returned.
	
	
The program manager provides metrics as part of the recommendation 
to show that expected program benefits have been realized, deliverables have 
been completed, and the program’s goals have been met.
	
	
Any work that may need to be done to transition the program to ongoing 
operations is described as part of the recommendation.
Reasons for request: This section describes the reasons for the program closure 
recommendation. For example, it describes that the program’s benefits have 
been realized, deliverables have been completed, and objectives have been 
met. The program manager may note any forecasts that have been prepared 
concerning the ongoing value of the benefits from the program. This request 
also is prepared if the program must be closed prematurely and states why it 
is to be closed.
Resources released: Once the program closure recommendation is approved, 
any remaining resources can be reallocated to other parts of the performing 
organization. This section states the available resources for planning purposes 
by the program sponsor and portfolio manager, as appropriate.
Disposition of property: This section states that any customer or performing 
organization property provided to the program has been returned.
Recommended changes: At the time the program officially is closed, during 
the lessons learned review session, the program management team may have 
noted some changes that could be beneficial to other programs and projects 
under way in the organization. This section describes any of these recommen­
dations for consideration.
Continued benefits realization: This section describes requirements for any 
continued benefits realization once the program is closed, and the benefits 
are transitioned to the customer, users, a product or customer support group 
in the organization, or another program under way in the organization. This 
section describes any ongoing activities that may be required to ensure the 
benefits continue to be sustained and recommends any tracking or monitor­
ing of these benefits as required.
Stakeholder communications: This section describes how the affected or inter­
ested stakeholders will learn that the program is formally closed.
Program completion closure certificate: This section describes who will pre­
pare the certificate noting that program completion has occurred and who 
must sign off on it once the closure recommendation is approved.
Approvals: This section contains the written approval of the program clo­
sure recommendation by the program manager, program sponsor, mem­
bers of the program’s Governance Board, and any other key stakeholders 
as appropriate.

Audit Plan
Audits can be conducted by elements internal to the program or external to it. In 
contrast to meetings where progress and status are reported, audits focus more 
on the supporting data and record keeping. The objectives and timing of audits 
are in the audit plan described in the Governance Domain in section 6.6.4 in the 
Standard for Program Management—Third Edition (2013). The Standard notes 
the Governance Board may assume responsibility for ensuring that the program 
manager and his or her team are prepared for audits. To help best prepare for these 
audits, a plan is helpful.
Audit Plan Instructions
The audit plan includes the following:
Purpose: A brief introductory statement defining the purpose of the audit plan, 
such as:
The audit plan describes the process that will be followed to periodi­
cally review the overall performance of the program at all levels to 
enhance effectiveness and ensure that the program benefits are being 
delivered as set forth in the benefits realization plan and that the pro­
gram is being executed as stated in the program management plan.

120  ◾  Implementing Program Management
	
	
Audits are common in programs. They are necessary for a number of rea­
sons, such as on finances, quality, management processes and practices, and 
they should be viewed in a positive manner rather than as necessary for com­
pliance or for pinpointing specific problems and associating them to specific 
individuals.
	
	
Audits may be internal or external. Ideally, the program manager should 
request internal audits at various times in the program and should establish a 
process so that everyone on the team views the auditors in a positive way, with 
the audit results then used to improve the program’s overall effectiveness.
	
	
This plan is an iterative document and should be reviewed periodically by 
the program management team and other key stakeholders, especially the 
members of the Governance Board, as the work of the program continues 
throughout the various phases in its life cycle. It also should be reviewed after 
each audit is conducted.
	
	
In the Project Management Institute’s Standard for Program Management—
Third Edition (2013), the audit plan is noted in section 6.6.4. The audit plan 
is a subsidiary plan to the overall program management plan.
Goals: This section states the goals for program audits. Examples are to examine the 
financial status of the program; to review the effectiveness of the program man­
agement processes, procedures, and guidelines that are being used; to determine 
whether or not there is compliance with specific standards and regulations; and to 
assess whether there may be evidence of fraud or mismanagement. The specifics 
of each program dictate the various types of audits that may be required; however, 
each program on a periodic basis should conduct audits to assess overall program 
management effectiveness and to determine whether changes in procedures, pro­
cesses, and guidelines are needed to help ensure overall program success.
Roles and responsibilities: This section describes the roles and responsibilities 
of the program management team and other key stakeholders in preparing 
for an audit and during an audit. While the auditors, whether internal or 
external, will prepare a plan for the audit, the program manager and other 
members of the program management team will also need to plan for the 
audit and must participate in it. A number of people on the team and other 
stakeholders may need to be interviewed, and the program manager will need 
to ensure that the auditors have access to program documentation. The pro­
gram manager should set the stage for the audit with the team to promote 
an atmosphere of cooperation. Everyone on the team should view the results 
of the audit as ones that can improve overall program effectiveness. The pro­
gram manager must serve as the facilitator for the auditors.
Schedule: This section presents the schedule for program audits. Although some 
audits will occur on a random basis and cannot be scheduled, others can be part 
of the program master schedule. The program manager ideally should request 
audits at certain times for a ­self ­assessment during the program’s life cycle, 
such as at key milestones in the program, at the end of a ­phase-­gate review, 

Governance  ◾  121
or before a scheduled program review to help prepare for such reviews and 
to have other suggestions to note to the Board during these review meetings.
Audit results: The auditors, whether internal or external, will present a report that 
documents the results and provides recommendations. This section describes 
how these audit results will be documented and made available to key stakehold­
ers. Ideally, a practice of “no secrets” will be followed. This means that the results 
should be available in an easily accessible format so stakeholders, especially those 
on the program management team, can review the suggested recommendations. 
This section also describes how the program management team will implement 
the suggested recommendations. Some recommendations may be mandatory, 
especially if the audit is conducted to determine compliance with regulations 
or standards. If the program management team believes it cannot implement 
a mandatory recommendation, this section describes the process to request a 
waiver. It also states the process to follow if the program management team 
wants to implement a recommendation at a different time than specified in the 
audit report. The program manager may need to escalate these requests to the 
Governance Board for approval. Additionally, this section describes the process 
to update other plans and documents as needed based on the findings and rec­
ommendations in the audit report. Each recommendation will require a change 
request and should be handled through the program’s change control system.
Monitoring and tracking: This section describes the approach the program 
management team will use to monitor and track the implementation of the 
recommendations from each audit. It describes the use of an information 
repository and/­or a log or register to assist in this process. In subsequent 
audits, this log then can be provided to the auditors.
Approvals: This section contains the written approval of the audit plan by the 
program sponsor, program manager, program management office, members 
of the Governance Board, and any other key stakeholders as appropriate.

Audit Report
Audits provide important and more ­in-­depth verification of actual program execu­
tion and performance. This report format can ensure completeness and consistency 
of the reports. It supports the audit plan noted in section 6.6.4 in the Standard for 
Program Management—Third Edition (2013).

124  ◾  Implementing Program Management
Audit Report Instructions
The Audit Report includes the following:
Purpose: A brief introductory statement defining the purpose of the Audit 
Report such as:
The Audit Report presents an objective assessment of the perfor­
mance of the program. The report’s findings and recommendations 
serve to enhance program effectiveness and ensure that the program 
benefits are being delivered as set forth in the benefit realization plan 
and that the program is being executed as stated in the program 
management plan.
	
	
Audits are common on programs. They are necessary for a number of rea­
sons and should be viewed in a positive manner rather than considering them as 
necessary for compliance or for pinpointing specific problems and associating 
them to specific individuals. The Audit Report is an objective report of findings 
and provides recommended preventive or corrective actions to follow. It also is 
used to ensure program management processes are being followed and can be a 
way for checks and balances based on other views for governance decisions.
	
	
According to the In the Project Management Institute’s Standard for 
Program Management—Third Edition (2008), the audit plan is described in 
section 6.6.4 as part of the Governance domain. The Audit Plan sets the stage 
for the report.
Background Information:
Time Period of the Audit: This section states the time the audit began and 
when the final report was prepared.
Place: This section states where the audit was conducted.
Audit Participants: This section states the names of the people on the audit 
team and provides their contact information for possible questions.
Type of Audit: This section states the type of audit that was conducted: 
internal or external. Note whether the audit was conducted according to 
a schedule in the program’s master schedule based on the Audit Plan or 
whether it was random.
Reason for the Audit: This section describes why the audit was conducted 
such as to concentrate on a component that may be in trouble or because 
the overall program may be in trouble, to look at specific processes and 
procedures to see whether or not they are being followed, for compliance 
purposes with specific regulations or procedures, to examine the overall 
financial status of the program, to see if benefits are being realized as 
stated in the benefits realization plan, or for other reasons.
Program Areas Affected: This section describes the various areas of the pro­
gram that were involved in the audit: e.g., the entire program or only 
certain components of it.

were used, focus groups were used, and/­or other methods.
Findings: This section presents the findings from the audit. The findings 
should be presented in an objective way as they are the basis for the rec­
ommendations from the audit. They are the synthesis of all of the data 
that were reviewed. Findings should be carefully worded to reflect the audit 
team’s observation, and they should be phrased as constructively presented 
problem statements. Appropriate background information that is needed to 
understand the findings should be included. Causes are observations that 
support the findings, and their identification is helpful in making construc­
tive recommendations. Consequences list the problem results of a finding. 
Findings should represent issues for the entire program or for the compo­
nents being audited and should have the broadest possible application.
	
	
Here is an example:
Finding (problem statement): Each status report that is prepared 
involves development of completely new material.
Probable cause: Reusable materials are not available.
Business consequence: Reports that are prepared may not be com­
pleted on schedule or may not contain the information of interest 
to the program’s stakeholders.
Recommendation: Prepare a Communications Management Plan that 
describes the types of reports to prepare and provide them to vari­
ous program stakeholders, and the data each report should include. 
Ask the Program Management Office to take the lead in provid­
ing a sample report template to use throughout the program.
	
	
In preparing findings, keep the specific audit goals and appraisal scope in 
mind. Avoid the following:
◾
◾Moot issues
◾
◾Findings based on hearsay alone
◾
◾Broad generalizations
Recommendations: This section states the recommendations based on the audit 
findings. Use categories if possible to group the recommendations and pres­
ent them in priority order. If the audit is for compliance purposes, note if 
some of the recommendations are mandatory.
Appendices: Include appendices such as the following:
Persons Interviewed: List the people who were interviewed during the 
audit and the date of each interview
Documents Reviewed: List the documents that were reviewed during 
the audit
Approvals: This section contains the written approval of the Audit Report by 
the lead Auditor.

Quality Management Plan
Program quality planning and standards are discussed in the Governance Domain in 
section 6.2.9 in the Standard for Program Management—Third Edition (2013) since 
quality planning is essential to the program’s components and any ­sub-­programs, 
noting also the importance of quality planning at the program level. A quality 

128  ◾  Implementing Program Management
management plan is a best practice to establish minimum standards for quality 
planning, quality control, and quality assurance for the program’s components.
Quality Management Plan Instructions
The quality management plan will include the following:
Purpose: A brief introductory statement defining the purpose of the quality 
management plan, such as:
The quality management plan establishes mechanisms for program 
quality and describes the program’s quality requirements that cross 
the various components of the program. It also provides require­
ments to assist the program components as project managers in the 
program prepare their quality management plans.
	
	
It should be noted that the program’s quality management plan does not 
replace the quality management plans to be prepared by each of the project 
managers working in the program. Instead, its purpose is to state specific 
quality standards and policies, as well as oversights, designed to ensure that 
the program realizes the benefits it is to achieve. This plan also serves to 
ensure that there is consistent application of specific quality requirements 
across the various components (projects and other work) in the program.
Organizational quality standards: This section states the performing organiza­
tion’s quality standards and policies. It also should note quality standards and 
policies of the program’s customers. If the program is a consortium, partner­
ship, or joint venture, the program management team will need to set specific 
standards and policies to be followed in the program. Note that standards are 
established norms, methods, policies, and practices. The quality policy sets 
forth the intended direction of the organization with regard to quality.
Overview of the program’s benefits: This section presents an overview of the 
benefits the program is designed to achieve. It can show a link to the pro­
gram’s benefits realization plan. With a complete understanding of the scope 
and nature of the benefits from the program, the program manager then can 
more effectively design appropriate quality standards and measures.
Program quality planning tools and techniques: This section describes the 
tools and techniques the program management team will use as they prepare 
the program’s quality management plan. Examples of tools and techniques 
that may be used include ­cost-­benefit analysis, benchmarking, checklists, and 
determination of the total cost of program quality.
Program quality assurance and quality control tools and techniques: This 
section states the quality assurance and quality control techniques the pro­
gram team will use for ­program-­level quality activities.

Governance  ◾  129
Requirements for quality planning, quality assurance, and quality control 
for the program’s components: This section describes the minimal require­
ments each of the program’s components must follow concerning quality 
planning, quality assurance, and quality control. It specifies the minimal 
quality standards and testing standards for the components. The purpose is 
to ensure that the quality management activities of the program components 
support the overall quality policy and standards at the program level.
­Program-­level roles and responsibilities: This section describes the program 
manager’s roles and responsibilities for maintaining quality standards as well 
as for quality assurance and quality control. Quality assurance responsibilities 
may include audits of the program’s overall commitment to quality manage­
ment or an audit of a specific component’s quality management activities to 
ensure appropriate standards are used, and there is compliance as required 
with regulations. These responsibilities also focus on continuous process 
improvement for the program. Quality control responsibilities may include 
methods to monitor and record results of executing activities to assess per­
formance and to recommend preventive or corrective actions. Note that both 
quality assurance and quality control are performed throughout the program.
Quality metrics: This section describes quality metrics that will be used in 
quality assurance and quality control. These metrics assist in comparing 
actual practices to planned practices to ensure program requirements are met 
successfully, and rework is not required. These metrics show compliance as 
well with the program’s standards and any applicable regulations.
Approvals: This section contains the written approval of the quality manage­
ment plan by the program sponsor, program manager, program management 
office, members of the Governance Board, and other stakeholders.

Knowledge Management Plan
One of the most important assets of any organization is its corporate knowledge. 
This asset does not happen or grow accidentally. A knowledge management (KM) 
plan is therefore a key to success.
Knowledge Management Plan Instructions
The knowledge management (KM) plan includes the following:
Purpose: A brief introductory statement defining the purpose of the knowledge 
management plan, such as:
The knowledge management plan shows how knowledge manage­
ment can improve the effectiveness and efficiency of overall program 
management, as it describes how people will be connected to one 
another in the program and to information generated throughout 
the course of the program.
	
	
This plan should be prepared early in the program because through a 
commitment to KM by the program management team, greater efficiencies 
should result. People on the program team will be able to access information 

Governance  ◾  133
prepared by others with whom they may not have direct contact or even 
know. People also will be able to locate subject matter expertise that could 
help with key program issues. The emphasis is on use of KM to avoid reinven­
tion, promote reuse, use less experienced staff on issues and problems for 
which solutions are available and staff members with greater expertise on 
areas in which innovative solutions are required, and provide the opportunity 
to eliminate redundancy in the program work environment.
	
	
The Project Management Institute’s Standard for Program Management—
Third Edition (2013) discusses KM in section 6.3.3 but does not describe the 
importance of the KM plan. It notes the importance of organizing program 
knowledge for use as a reference and making it available to those who need it. 
The standard mentions three key elements of KM: collecting knowledge and 
sharing it across the program, using subject matter experts during the pro­
gram, and using a program management information system for collecting 
program knowledge assets and artifacts. It further recognizes the importance 
of identifying, storing, and delivering key knowledge assets to stakeholders 
especially to support decision making.
	
	
Although the plan is prepared early in the program, it is an iterative docu­
ment that should be reviewed and updated on a periodic basis.
Goals and objectives: This section lists the goals and objectives for KM in 
the program and describes how KM can contribute to the objectives of the 
program and the benefits to be realized. It may be that the program manager 
recognizes a need to quickly share information with his or her team, wishes to 
reduce the time required to locate information in documents and files, wants 
to reduce the time required to locate people with different areas of expertise 
on the team, or wants to avoid redundancy in the work that is done.
Roles and responsibilities: This section describes the key roles and responsibili­
ties for KM in the program. A member of the program management team 
should have responsibility for KM activities, which would include preparing 
and updating the KM plan, ensuring that KM is a program package in the 
program work breakdown structure, determining the type of metadata tags 
to include on program artifacts, setting up a process so people can contribute 
knowledge assets or content to the knowledge repositor, approving knowl­
edge assets or content for publication, publishing the content, prioritizing 
the content that is contributed, communicating the availability of content to 
stakeholders and members of the program management team, determining 
access rights to the content that is published, reviewing blogs and discussion 
forums for examples of content to share, establishing and using debriefing 
tools as team members and contractors leave the program, and sharing con­
tent within the team and the organization.
	
	
Examples of approaches to consider as metadata tags include: authored 
by or prepared by, date, document type (form, presentation, plan, report, 
register, meeting minutes, lessons learned sessions, program reviews, and 

134  ◾  Implementing Program Management
stage gate reviews), modified by, description, key topic (if not evident by the 
type of document), component involved, stakeholders involved, benefits, 
and metrics.
	
	
This member of the program management team with principal responsi­
bility for KM may work with someone in the program management office. 
He or she also should set up a process to work with at least one other person 
on the team to ensure that the content that is contributed is of high quality 
and should be published. This KM team member also can determine whether 
the content requires updates or should be deleted and should be responsible 
for knowledge transition to the program during the close program process.
	
	
Each member of the program management team, as well as customers 
and contractors, should identify knowledge assets or content and be able to 
contribute them.
	
	
Methods to communicate content availability within the program and 
within the organization include distribution lists, webinars, training sessions, 
discussion forums, blogs, podcasts, newsletters, white papers, collaboration 
rooms, document libraries, subscription notifications, and announcements.
Tools and techniques: This section describes the various tools and techniques 
to be used within the program team to share content that has been contrib­
uted. Examples of approaches include a program Web site, a shared drive, a 
knowledge repositor, a collaboration room, a document library, and discus­
sion forums.
Training and orientation sessions: This section describes whether any training 
and orientation sessions may be needed if people working on the program 
are not accustomed to active involvement in KM. Examples of items to be 
included in these sessions are ways to share information, approaches to con­
tribute knowledge assets or content, ownership of content and intellectual 
property issues, the need for nondisclosure issues, and security.
Metrics: This section states how the effectiveness of the KM process in the pro­
gram will be evaluated. Examples of items to consider include the contribu­
tion on a regular basis of useful content, the “hit” rates per knowledge asset 
or content, the actual use of contributed content, and the ability to locate key 
content quickly or key subject matter experts easily.
Rewards and recognition: If the organization does not actively practice KM, 
this section may be required to state how best to recognize and reward those 
members of the program team who are active in the KM process. Incentives 
may be needed so people regularly contribute knowledge assets and content 
and apply them to their work on the program as appropriate.
Approvals: This section contains the written approval of the knowledge man­
agement plan by the program sponsor, program manager, program manage­
ment office director, members of the Governance Board, and any other key 
stakeholders as appropriate.

Governance Decision Register
The Standard for Program Management—Third Edition (2013) does not specify 
the format for recording governance decisions, but given the Governance Board is 
making key decisions throughout the program’s life cycle, a decision register is a 
best practice to follow. Also, since many programs are complex and log, maintain­
ing this register is useful as Board members may change during the program as well 
as possibly the program manager and members of his or her core team. Here, we 
present one proposed format.
Governance Decision Register Instructions
Purpose: The governance decision register is used throughout the program by 
the Governance Board to document the program decisions made at each 
meeting of the Board. It should be included with the minutes of the Board 
and distributed to stakeholders as described in the governance management 
plan and the program communications management plan. This register then 
is reviewed at subsequent meetings of the Governance Board. It is also use­
ful to show progress in terms of meeting the program’s objectives and to 
ensure they remain aligned with the organization’s strategic objectives. Each 
decision documented in the register is used to help improve overall program 
results. Change requests may be required based on the type of decision and its 
impact on the program. These decisions, for example, may lead to a need to 
revise the governance management plan and the program management plan.
	
	
The governance decision register is helpful should members of the 
Governance Board change during the life of the program. The decision regis­
ter should be part of the program’s final records, as it can serve as an excellent 
source of lessons learned for future programs.
	
	
This governance decision register is designed as a table, and a description 
of its contents follows:

138  ◾  Implementing Program Management
	
1.	 Decision number: Provide a number for the decision for tracking purposes.
	
2.	 PWBS number: Link the decision to a PWBS program package.
	
3.	 Board meeting date: State the date of the Governance Board meeting.
	
4.	 Purpose of the Board meeting: Describe the purpose of the Board meet­

effectiveness of the governance management plan, or a request to close 
the program.

done. Provide sufficient detail for future use.
	
6.	 Background information: Provide background information as to why 
the decision was needed. Examples include escalated risk, issue, or audit 
recommendation by the program manager to the Governance Board; a 
requirement for approval to move to the next phase in the program’s life 
cycle; to determine changes to ensure expected benefits are being real­
ized; to determine whether new components should be added to the pro­
gram or existing components terminated; to determine whether changes 
are required in program management so that best practices are followed; 
to ensure that the program’s strategic objectives remain in alignment with 
the organization’s strategic objectives; or to request a recommendation to 
close the program.

Chapter 7
Program Life Cycle 
Management
Our days are so crowded and our hours are so few. And there’s so little 
time and so much to do.
—Helen Steiner Rice
A program management life cycle can help program professionals in their quest 
to minimize their busy world, and it is during this life cycle in which the pro­
gram’s benefits are realized and sustained. However, the Standard for Program 
Management—Third Edition (2013) explains the program life cycle is not sequen­
tial as program components start and end at different times, and during the life 
cycle, the program produces ‘a stream of deliverables’ (p. 11). The life cycle spans 
the program’s duration.
In the Standard for Program Management—Third Edition (2013), there is a 
Program Life Cycle Management Domain. It is divided into:
◾
◾Program Definition—program formulation and program preparation
◾
◾Program Benefits Delivery—component planning and authorization, com­
ponent oversight and integration, and component transition and closure
◾
◾Program Closure—program transition and program closure
As noted, this life cycle serves to manage program activities as they are defined, as 
benefits are delivered, and as the program closes.

140  ◾  Implementing Program Management
In PMI’s Examination Content Outline (2011), the Program Life Cycle Domain 
is divided into:
◾
◾Initiating the Program
◾
◾Planning the Program
◾
◾Executing the Program
◾
◾Controlling the Program
◾
◾Closing the Program
Both approaches are similar as Initiating the Program relates to the Program 
Definition phase as it elaborates the program’s strategic objectives and works toward 
program approval. Planning, Executing, and Controlling the Program relate to the 
Program Benefits Delivery phase, and Closing the Program relates to the Program 
Closure phase.
Because of the numerous possible plans, registers, and other templates, we have 
organized this chapter into five ­sub-­chapters following the more familiar terms 
used in the Examination Content Outline.

Program Life Cycle Management  ◾  141
Section 7A: Initiating the Program
Without a charter, program execution is like flying without visual flight 
ranging in a cloud. Almost certainly in the heat of the moment you’ll 
veer seriously toward somewhere you had no intention of going.
—Anonymous
In his children’s book, Oh, the Places You’ll Go!, Dr. Seuss (1993) coined program 
management wisdom for the ages, warning eloquently of the scary proposition of 
making quick decisions “where the streets are not marked” and winding up in 
“weirdish wild space” and “useless places.”
Having no use for useless places or weirdish wild space, in program initiation 
we produce a program charter for the program—building on the business case, 
program mandate, and the roadmap to guide us on the path to success. This pro­
gram charter then links the program to the organization and its strategic goals and 
objectives. During this phase, we also may need to update the business case and 
the roadmap, in Chapter 3 in this book, as the program’s financial framework is 
established, and the program charter is issued.
In the Standard for Program Management—Third Edition (2013), initiating 
involves defining the program, obtaining funding, and determining how the pro­
gram will deliver its intended benefits. Other initiating activities include obtaining 
a sponsor; assigning a program manager; preparing estimates of scope, resources, 
and costs; performing an initial risk assessment; preparing the charter, and updat­
ing the business case and initial roadmap. It also suggests preparing the program 
management plan, which will be discussed in 7B.
A ­high-­level overview of the initiating tasks from the Examination Content 
Outline (PMI, 2011) is as follows:
◾
◾Developing a program charter
◾◾Translating ­high-­level objectives into a scope statement (to be discussed in 7B)
◾
◾Developing a ­high-­level milestone plan
◾
◾Developing a responsibility matrix
◾
◾Defining measurement criteria for project success in the program
◾
◾Conducting a ­kick-­off meeting
Program Charter
Without a charter, the program manager has no authority to use resources and 
execute the program, and in fact, the program has no right to exist. The pro­
gram charter is a major part of program initiation in the Standard for Program 
Management—Third Edition (2013) in section 8.3.1.6.

142  ◾  Implementing Program Management
Program Charter Instructions
The program charter is a key program document. At the time the program is 
approved, it states the program vision, key objectives, expected benefits, constraints, 
and assumptions. It serves to link the program to the ongoing work of the organiza­
tion. It also states the authority level of the program manager. When the program 
charter is approved, the program is officially authorized. A suggested format is:
Purpose: A brief introductory statement defining the purpose of the charter, 
such as:
The program charter states the vision statement that defines the 
organization’s end state for the program—a vital concept for suc­
cessful program completion. It also states the program manager’s 
authority and responsibility and formally authorizes the program.
Program vision: The program vision is the desired end state for the program. It 
describes why it will benefit the organization. It also describes the outcomes 
required to achieve the vision.
Justification: Each program has a key set of objectives to be accomplished. 
Objectives may involve the organization’s business need for the program, a 
customer request, market demand, a regulation, etc. The program’s objectives 
support the organization’s business plan and strategic goals. The objectives 
should be measureable and state success criteria.
Strategic fit: The program’s objectives are established in order to support those 
of the organization. This section lists the key strategic drivers for the program 
to show the link to the organization’s strategic objectives and other ongoing 
strategic work in the organization.
Benefits: Programs are established in order to deliver benefits that may not be 
realized if projects and other work within the program were managed on an 
individual basis. Benefits enhance current capabilities or enable development 
of new capabilities. A benefit is an outcome of actions or behaviors to provide 
utility to the program’s stakeholders. It is an improvement to the running of 
the organization, such as increased sales, reduced costs, or decreased waste. 
Benefits may be tangible (such as financial objectives) or intangible (such 
as customer satisfaction or improved employee morale). Benefits should be 
specific, measureable, actual, realistic, and time based. This section describes 
the benefits and how they are to be realized building on the initial list in 
Chapter 3, Program Strategic Management/­Alignment.
Program constraints: Constraints are factors that limit the options of the pro­
gram team. For example, a constraint may involve a regulatory requirement 
that must be met by a certain date. Constraints typically fall into catego­
ries such as time, cost, resources, or deliverables. Constraints are expected to 
change throughout the life of the program.

Program Life Cycle Management  ◾  143
Program assumptions: This section describes the assumptions or any factors 
that are considered to be true, real, or certain in planning the program. 
Assumptions generally involve some degree of risk. They are expected to 
change throughout the life of the program.

Program Financial Framework
The program financial framework is developed early in the program definition 
phase to set the stage for program financial matters. According the Standard for 
Program Management—Third Edition (2013), section 8.2.2, the framework defines 
available funding and outflows as well as financial constraints on income, spend­
ing and management. The information discovered in development of the program 
financial framework may have impact on the program business case. The financial 
framework then serves as a key document when the program’s financial manage­
ment plan is prepared, as discussed in Chapter 8B in this book.
Program Financial Framework Instructions
A suggested format is as follows:
Purpose: A brief introductory statement defining the purpose of the financial 
framework, such as:
The program financial framework delineates the available funding 
sources and expected outlays as a basis for present and future bud­
geting to ensure adequate understanding of the special consider­
ations involved in each funding source and expenditure destination. 
Additionally, it describes funding flows to ensure money is spent in 
the most efficient way.
Funding sources: While some programs only have a single funding source, 
others have multiple sources of funding. This section describes the various 
sources of funding for the program. Funding sources typically depend on 
the size, complexity, and type of program. Other factors include whether it is 
international or within a single country. The program may be funded inter­
nally and/­or it may require external sources for funding.
Financial framework constraints: Each program has certain financial con­
straints. Examples of constraints that may be ones to consider include: how 
payment is to be made if on an international program; will a percent of con­
tracts be held in retainage; since it is rare that a program, especially a long 
one, will receive all its funding at the beginning; when will funds be made 
available; whether government bonds will be used for funding that need to 
be created or sold; if funds are to be provided at ­pre-­determined milestones; 

148  ◾  Implementing Program Management
whether compulsory employment will need to be included or if there is a 
requirement for compulsory use of a certain percent of indigenously pro­
duced products; and if there are any buy back arrangements that are required.
Financial framework assumptions: The program team will make assumptions 
concerning funding sources and funding goals for the program. As these 
assumptions may affect the program’s deliverables, benefits, and objectives, 
they should be documented in this section and updated as changes occur 
during the program’s life cycle.
Known risks and issues: Financial management, beginning with cost esti­
mates and the financial framework, will have risks and issues to state. For 
example, a key risk could be if a contractor is subject to retainage, it may 
affect the contractor’s ability to complete its portion of the program within 
budget. Another possible concern is if funding is to be provided at certain 
time period, and there is a budget cut that may occur. Such risks and issues 
are listed in this section.
Financial schedule: Given the length of programs, cash inflows tend to occur 
far more quickly than the program’s benefits. A financial schedule is help­
ful to show both the inflows and outflows of funds for consideration by the 
Portfolio Review Board and other key stakeholders. As the schedule is pre­
pared, if the program will be comprised of some existing components, review 
their schedules and infrastructure operational costs to date.
Resource requirements: This section describes key resource requirements from 
the program as the program manager will need to have a close working rela­
tionship with the financial organization and may need a core team mem­
ber with a background in finance or support from the Enterprise Program 
Management Office.
Financial metrics: This section describes financial metrics to ensure that money 
is spent on the program in the most efficient way. These metrics should track 
to the business case, and as they are described in this document, it may be 
necessary to update the business case as a result.
Stakeholder and funding source considerations: This section states the key 
stakeholders with an influence over or an interest in the financial aspects 
of the program. It specifically lists those stakeholders that are expected to 
provide funding to the program and how best to engage them to ensure their 
support. It will serve as data to consider as the stakeholder engagement plan 
is prepared.
Approvals: This section contains the approval of the program financial frame­
work by the members of the Portfolio Review Board and other key stakehold­
ers as required.
The contents of this document can be refactored into a tabular format with accom­
panying discussion. A suggested document format is as follows.

152  ◾  Implementing Program Management
Section 7B: Planning the Program
When you don’t invest in infrastructure, you are going to pay sooner 
or later.
—Mike Parker
In planning the program, selection of the projects and ­non-­project work to be part 
of the program occurs. The ­high-­level program road map is morphed into a detailed 
program road map. Here, the program charter is progressively elaborated to include 
much more detailed information, such as budget, schedule, and indeed a complete 
program management plan that describes the program’s management infrastruc­
ture as prepared. That plan, by design, includes the tools and techniques that will 
eventually allow these “living documents” to evolve with developing realities.
As stated in the Standard for Program Management—Third Edition (2013), 
planning at the organizational level affects planning at the program level as the 
organization’s strategic objectives continually evolve. Planning at the program level 
focuses on the program’s deliverables and its benefits to ensure the benefits are 
realized, transitioned, and sustained. While a number of key plans (benefits real­
ization, stakeholder engagement, communications management, change manage­
ment, quality management, audit, knowledge management and governance) have 
been discussed in previous chapters, this chapter focuses on the program manage­
ment plan and other subsidiary plans to best guide the program into executing, 
monitoring and controlling, closing, transitioning, and sustainment. Before the 
program can be closed officially, members of the Governance Board and the pro­
gram sponsor will review the program management plan to ensure its contents 
have been fulfilled. Plans at the program level, however, do not replace plans at 
the project level but provide guidance to the project managers. In the Standard for 
Program Management—Third Edition (2013), the program management plan is 
part of program definition, see section 7.1.1.2 in the program definition phase. It is 
developed after the charter has been approved, and its approval by the Governance 
Board enables the program to move to the benefits delivery phase.

Examination Content Outline follows:
◾

Program Scope Management Plan
Just as the program scope statement defines the extents and boundaries within 
which to manage the program, the program scope management plan defines how to 
prepare the scope statement and the program work breakdown structure (PWBS) 
and how to manage, document, and communicate scope changes. It is noted the 
Standard for Program Management—Third Edition (2013) in section 8.9.1.
Program Scope Management Plan Instructions
The scope management plan will include the following:
Purpose: A brief introductory statement defining the purpose of the scope man­
agement plan, such as:
The scope management plan describes the process of managing 
scope throughout the program.
	
	
This plan describes the process to follow to develop a detailed program 
scope statement, the PWBS, and the approach to follow to manage, docu­
ment, and communicate scope changes. It also sets forth the relationship 
between product scope and program scope as it serves to identify the process 
and activities to produce deliverables and benefits to achieve program goals. 
This plan aligns the program’s scope with the program’s goals and objectives.
Product scope and program scope: This section states the difference between 
product scope and program scope. It recognizes that product scope involves 
the features and functions that characterize the products, services, and results 
of the program, while program scope describes the work required to deliver a 
major product, service, or benefit. Program scope also may be expressed as user 
stories or scenarios for some programs as described in the Program Management 
Standard—Third Edition (2013). Separate processes may be needed for prod­
uct scope and program scope, which would be stated in this section. This 
section notes that completion of product scope is measured against program 
requirements, while completion of program scope is measured according to 
the program management plan and the benefits realization plan.
Expected stability of the scope of the program: This section describes the 
expected stability of the scope of the program based on information from 
program stakeholders. The stakeholder register, and its accompanying analy­
sis, is reviewed and analyzed, and stakeholders are contacted to define and 
prioritize their requirements and to obtain inputs concerning program scope 
expectations. Program deliverable acceptance criteria are defined in this sec­
tion for use in determining the overall stability of the scope of the program.
Scope statement development process: This section describes the process to 
follow to develop the scope statement for the program. A detailed program 

154  ◾  Implementing Program Management
scope statement is critical to program success. The scope statement addresses 
the vision, range, capacity, and extent of the program endeavor. It serves to 
provide a common understanding of the program’s scope by the stakeholders, 
as it establishes the direction to be taken and the essential aspects of the pro­
gram to be accomplished. The process notes appropriate policies, procedures, 
and templates, which may be helpful in the development of the scope state­
ment. It also describes tools and techniques to be used in the development of 
the scope statement, such as expert judgment, interviews, focus groups, and 
customer acceptance reviews.
Program work breakdown structure development process: This section 
describes the process to follow to develop the PWBS. The PWBS provides 
the framework for organizing and managing the work in the program. The 
objective is to structure the work in order that future activities and scope are 
easily managed. This section notes specific PWBS templates that may be con­
sidered, the use of expert judgment, lessons learned from previous programs, 
the various options to consider in program management in order that there is 
a balance between program deliverables and business objectives, the roles and 
level of involvement of specific individuals in the ownership of key activities, 
and methods to verify that the level of decomposition desired is necessary 
and sufficient.
Program scope change control process: This section describes the methods 
to use to identify program scope changes. The classification of these changes 
also is included in this section to determine the types of changes that the pro­
gram manager can approve and others that need escalation to the program 
Governance Board. It also describes the process to follow to manage scope 
so scope creep does not occur, and states how program scope changes will 
be integrated into the overall program. Specific configuration management 
tools to be used are stated in this section to be able to monitor change control 
while enhancing organizational control so there is consistent documentation 
and product versions throughout the program. It also describes how to best 
communicate scope changes to program stakeholders.
Approvals: This section contains the written approval of the scope management 
plan by the program sponsor, program manager, program management office 
directors, members of the Governance Board, and other stakeholders.

Program Scope Statement
Programs often fail because they do too many things in the heat of the battle that 
are being done by another team or organization, were not even part of the contract, 
or were not really needed for success. Ignoring this step can result in unnecessary 
requirements and serious cost overruns. The program scope statement is a living 
document for avoiding this type of failure and is used throughout the program life 
cycle. It is prepared in the program scope planning section (8.9.1) in the Standard 
for Program Management—Third Edition (2013).
Program Scope Statement Instructions
The program scope statement includes the following:
Purpose: A brief introductory statement defining the purpose of the scope state­
ment, such as:
The program scope statement defines the benefits, intent, and reason 
for pursuing a program by documenting what will be accomplished 
by the program.
	
	
It serves as the basis for future program decisions and describes the scope 
boundaries of the program. It ensures the context and framework of the pro­
gram are defined, assessed, and documented. It defines the direction to be 
taken in the program and the specific aspects to be accomplished. It is an iter­
ative document that can be further refined as the program progresses through 
the life cycle.
Objectives and success criteria: This section includes the measurable success 
criteria of the program, including cost, schedule, technical, and quality objec­
tives. Cost, schedule, and quality targets can be included. Benefits to be real­
ized by the program should be mentioned with a reference to the benefits 
realization plan.
Program scope (inclusions and exclusions): This statement describes the char­
acteristics of the product, service, or result that the program is undertaken to 

158  ◾  Implementing Program Management
create. It is expected that these characteristics will be progressively elaborated 
as the project ensues.
Assumptions: This section lists and describes the specific program assumptions 
associated with the program scope, and the potential impact of the assump­
tions should they prove to be false.
Constraints: This section lists and describes the specific program constraints 
associated with the program scope that limit the team’s options.
Deliverables and milestones: This section lists the deliverables, including both 
the outputs that comprise the product, service, or result, and the ancillary 
results, such as the program management reports and documentation. The 
milestones, proposed dates for those activities, and the deliverables are identi­
fied here, or a reference to the master program schedule may be used.
Acceptance criteria: This section identifies approval requirements that can be 
applied to items such as program objectives, deliverables (such as the manu­
als), documents (such as the component project plans and the performance 
tracking reports), and work products.
Risks: This section identifies the known scope risks to the program. It will be 
progressively elaborated during the course of the program.
Approvals: This section contains the written approval of the program scope 
statement by the program sponsor, program manager, program management 
office director, members of the Governance Board, and other stakeholders.

Program WBS
An abundance of references address the topic of work breakdown structure (WBS) 
generation, so we do not discuss this topic here. A salient point, however, is that the 
program WBS typically includes only one or two levels of each project’s WBS—
only enough to enable project tracking, monitoring, and control at the program 
level. The program WBS is discussed in section 8.9.1 in the Standard for Program 
Management—Third Edition (2013).
Program Resource Plan
While most resources and cost are probably at the component (project and 
­non-­project work) level and are thus managed there, the program level employs 
most or all of some resources for program management and governance. Necessary 
plans for efficiency and timeliness are in the program resource plan. In the Standard 
for Program Management—Third Edition (2013), its importance is stated in section 
8.3.3.2, Program Infrastructure Development, noting that programs need people, 
tools, facilities, and finances specifically to manage the program, and it is described 
in more detail in section 8.6.1, Resource Planning.
Program Resource Plan Instructions
The program resource plan includes the following:
Purpose: A brief introductory statement defining the purpose of the program 
resource plan, such as:
The program resource plan describes the resources required to manage 
the program. It includes methods to monitor and track resource use.
	
	
These program resources include more than human resources and con­
sist of materials, tools, equipment, facilities, and finances that will be used 
in the program. It also is important to recognize that this plan addresses 
resource use at the program level, not at the individual component level. 
Although the plan is drafted early in the program, it is an iterative document 
that should be further refined, especially since the preliminary requirements 
regarding the resources probably will change as the program progresses.

162  ◾  Implementing Program Management
	
	
In the Project Management Institute’s Standard for Program Management—
Third Edition (2013), the program resource plan is discussed in section 8.6.1, 
Resource Planning in Program Resource Management. Required resources 
need to be available to program managers in a timely way to focus on ben­
efit realization.
Internal and external required resources: This section describes specific inter­
nal and external, when appropriate, resources required for program success. It 
presents costs for each of these needed resources to assist in overall financial 
management and in determining the program’s financial framework and finan­
cial management plan. It describes how some resources, such as office supplies 
are consumed by the program and managed as an expense, and emphasizes 
the need to account for all resources as well as those allocated appropriately at 
the component level. If external resources are required, the program manager 
prepares a statement of work to initiate the procurement process.
Organizational influences: This section defines various organizational influ­
ences that can impact the program team. It describes key procurement and 
personnel policies that may affect the acquisition of needed resources for the 
program. Also, it notes guidance on the appropriate use of program resources, 
such as depreciation or release of purchased equipment, sharing resources 
with other parts of the organization, or recurring costs of resources that are 
leased. It also states involvement with people from the quality department to 
ensure appropriate program quality assurance and quality controls are con­
sidered, including by contactors and components.
Methods to meet resource requirements: This section describes when and 
how resource requirements will be met in the program. It describes whether 
resources will be obtained internally or through procurements. It also 
describes the need to follow the issue escalation process should the program 
manager have difficulty acquiring needed resources to support the program.
Resource calendars: This section describes the necessary time frames for use 
of the program resources. These calendars can assist in development of the 
overall program schedule.
Tracking and monitoring: This section describes the methods to be used to 
track and monitor resource use throughout the program’s life cycle. Since 
change is inevitable in all programs, the need for certain resources may 
change, especially as new components become part of the program, and other 
components are transitioned or terminated.
Resource prioritization: This focuses on scarce resources and the priority for 
use at the program and component level of these scarce resources. It describes 
the approaches the program manager will use in resource prioritization.
Approvals: This section contains the written approval of the program resource 
plan by the program sponsor, program manager, program management office 
director, members of the Governance Board, and other stakeholders.

Staffing Management Plan
Although this plan is not part of the Standard for Program Management—Second 
Edition (2008) or its Third Edition (2013), we believe it is an essential document 
for program management given the importance of acquiring, retaining, and releas­
ing staff from the program.
Staffing Management Plan Instructions
The staffing management plan includes the following:
Purpose: A brief introductory statement defining the purpose of the staffing 
management plan, such as:
The staffing management plan describes the timetable for staff 
acquisition and release from the program. It also includes identifica­
tion of roles and responsibilities, plans for recognition and rewards, 
compliance considerations, and safety issues.
	
	
It addresses availability of and competition for scarce human resources 
needed for the program. It designates roles and responsibilities required for 
program success. Although the plan is drafted early in the program, it is an 
iterative document that should be further refined, especially since the pre­
liminary requirements regarding the people and competencies needed for the 
program are progressively elaborated as the program progresses.
Internal and external required resources: This section describes specific inter­
nal and external, when appropriate, human resources required for program 
success. Specific competencies are listed in this section. Competency refers to 
the skills and abilities required to complete program activities. The section 

166  ◾  Implementing Program Management
lists the individuals and groups that may be part of the program organization 
and whether they are internal to the organization or external to it.
Organizational influences: This section defines various organizational influences 
that can impact the program team. It describes key personnel administration 
policies and procedures, standardized position descriptions, standardized 
performance plans, and the ability to acquire resources from groups external 
to the organization. It also specifically describes the assistance available to the 
program manager from the human resource department.
Program team roles and responsibilities: This section documents program 
team member roles and responsibilities so there is clarity of who is responsible 
for each program package in the program work breakdown structure. The 
objective is to ensure that the program team is aware of who is responsible for 
each of these program packages to ensure each one has an assigned owner, 
and duplicative work does not result. A role is defined as the portion of the 
program for which an individual is held accountable. Responsibility refers 
to the work the person is expected to perform in the program. A program 
organizational chart should be prepared and attached to the plan as a separate 
document. A resource assignment matrix also should be prepared.
Methods to meet human resource requirements: This section describes 
when and how human resource requirements will be met in the program. It 
describes how staff members will be acquired and whether or not the team 
will be virtual or collocated.
Resource calendars: This section describes the necessary time frames for mem­
bers of the program team to join the program and begin their work, as well 
as when recruiting or acquisition activities will begin. A histogram of human 
resource requirements may be attached to this plan.
Staffing release: This section describes the method and timing of releasing staff 
members from the program team. Its purpose is to provide a smooth transi­
tion as staff members are released. Methods for identifying lessons learned for 
future program improvements can be part of this section of the plan as indi­
viduals move on to other assignments. Such a smooth transition can improve 
overall team morale.
Rewards and recognition: This section presents clear criteria for rewards and 
a planned system for their use on the program. Various types of available 
rewards are included in this section. The purpose of this section is to ensure 
there is a set timetable so recognition is not forgotten as program activities 
are completed.
Compliance requirements: This section describes strategies for compliance with 
various regulations, organizational policies, and human resource policies to be 
followed in the program. It also includes any safety policies and procedures.
Approvals: This section contains the written approval of the staffing manage­
ment plan by the program sponsor, program manager, program management 
office director, members of the Governance Board, and other stakeholders.

Program Requirements Document
Requirements documents have been around for many years. We chose not to cover 
this document in detail, except to emphasize the fact that both program require­
ments and component requirements must be included, where program require­
ments are much higher in level. Component requirements, on the other hand, are 
written only to such a level that the component can begin work. A requirements 
document is not discussed separately in the Standard for Program Management—
Third Edition (2013); however, the importance of requirements in a variety of areas 
in program management is mentioned frequently.
Program Requirements Document Instructions
The program requirements document includes the following:
Purpose: A brief introductory statement defining the purpose of the program 
requirements document, such as:
The program requirements document describes the ­high-­level require­
ments to ensure that the program delivers its expected benefits.
	
	
The program requirements document serves as the basis for the component 
requirements document, which is used to develop the technical requirements for 
each of the component’s deliverables. It identifies and details program specifica­
tions and specific outcomes to be achieved by the program during implementation.
	
	
The program requirements document should be prepared once program 
goals and objectives are defined. It builds on the requirements listed in the 
business case, the scope statement, and the program roadmap. Programs 
must ensure that a detailed process is followed as this document is developed, 
since it is imperative for successful program implementation.
Requirements management process: This section describes how the project 
manager and his or her team will develop the program requirements in suffi­
cient detail to ensure they address all program components. It describes roles 
and responsibilities of program management team members and states the 
level of detail to be provided in the program requirements.
Requirements gathering tools: This section describes the specific requirements 
gathering tools the program management team will use as it develops the pro­
gram requirements. Examples include the use of brainstorming, interviews, 
focus groups, questionnaires, and surveys as the program management team 
actively engages its stakeholders in this process.
Requirements analysis process: This section then describes the approach the 
program management team will follow to ensure that the requirements it 

Program Life Cycle Management  ◾  171
has identified are complete. It describes the decomposition process the team 
will follow to take the ­high-­level requirements into ones that can be further 
detailed by each component.
Requirements review process: This section states how the program manage­
ment team will review the requirements that have been developed to ensure 
they are consistent, accurate, and complete. It describes specific approaches 
that may be used, such as various reviews, both informal and formal. It 
notes how the team will verify that best practices were followed and describes 
whether subject matter experts will be used in the reviews. It also states 
the level of customer involvement and that of the senior managers in the 
organization.
Requirements validation and verification: This section describes methods to 
be used to validate and verify the requirements that have been developed 
in order to ensure that they support the program’s business case and have 
been decomposed to the level required for implementation. It then describes 
how the products of the program will be verified against the requirements 
and the acceptance process that will be followed both at a detailed and at a 
system level. It states the extent of any testing to be used, inspections to be 
conducted, or other approaches that will be followed.
Approvals: This section contains the written approval of the requirements doc­
ument by the program sponsor, program manager, program management 
office director, members of the Governance Board, and any other key stake­
holders as appropriate.

Risk Management Planning Meeting Agenda
Documents such as the risk management plan and more are generated at risk man­
agement planning meetings. This agenda should be of significant help in assuring 
success in this critical endeavor. This meeting is not discussed as a way to prepare 
the risk management plan for the program in section 8.7.1 in the Standard for 
Program Management—Third Edition (2013); however to encourage stakeholder 
engagement in the risk planning process, we feel it is a best practice to hold this 
meeting to gather perspectives as the plan is prepared.

174  ◾  Implementing Program Management
Risk Management Planning Meeting Agenda Instructions
All programs will have risks, and risk management planning is an important com­
ponent to continually assess the program for risks that are opportunities to pursue 
as well as possible threats to the program. Holding a risk management planning 
meeting with a variety of program stakeholders can facilitate their engagement in 
the program’s risk management activities especially as the plan is prepared.
Typical participants include the program manager, members of the program 
management team, a risk management specialist in the organization, the direc­
tor of the program management office, and the portfolio manager. The program 
manager should review the stakeholders that have been identified to date and the 
stakeholder engagement plan and decide whether or not to invite other stakeholders 
to the meeting.
Prior to the meeting, participants should receive copies of the program mandate, 
business case, stakeholder engagement plan, program charter, program roadmap, 
scope statement, program work breakdown structure, governance plan, and 
resource plan. The program manager should consult the organization’s knowledge 
management repository for any lessons learned from previous or ongoing projects 
or programs that may be helpful to this program concerning risk management. If 
component projects have been under way before inclusion in the program and have 
prepared a risk management plan, the program manager should provide them to 
attendees. If there are existing templates in the organization for use in risk manage­
ment, participants should receive them prior to the planning meeting.
An agenda for the meetings is as follows:

program as to why the program was undertaken and where it stands in the pro­
gram management life cycle. If other meetings are held at a later time to refine or 
update the plan, he or she should provide a short summary of the last meeting held 
and should provide participants with the latest program risk register.
Program risk management activities: The risk management planning meeting 
defines the risk management activities to be followed in the program. During this 
meeting, participants determine the following:
Specific risk categories that are expected to affect the program
A risk breakdown structure

Program Risk Management Plan
Programs must have a disciplined way to deal with risks. This plan, while a liv­
ing document throughout the program, would normally remain somewhat static, 
defining the processes that populate and manage the risk register, generate risk 
response plans, contingency plans, etc. It is discussed in section 8.7.1, Program 
Risk Management Planning, in the Standard for Program Management—Third 
Edition (2013).
Program Risk Management Plan Instructions
The program risk management plan includes the following:
Purpose: A brief introductory statement defining the purpose of the risk man­
agement plan, such as:
The risk management plan describes the process of determining how 
to approach, plan, and execute the program risk activities.

176  ◾  Implementing Program Management
	
	
This plan recognizes that risks are a series of events that, if they occur, may 
have a positive or a negative impact on the program. At the program level, 
risks tend to occur from external factors or from individual components. If 
they are due to risks at the component level, the program management team 
must assess them for impact to other components or to the entire program. 
The program management team must ensure that the level, type, and vis­
ibility of risks are appropriate to the specific program since some programs 
may require greater attention to risk management than others, especially pro­
grams that are new in numerous aspects to the organization, are considered 
complex, and involve new technologies and systems.
Risk management approach: This section describes how the program man­
agement team will handle risk management in the program. The organiza­
tion’s culture risk profiles, and thresholds, and market factors affecting the 
program are described as appropriate. It states the methodology to be fol­
lowed, tools and techniques to be used, and any other data sources, such as a 
knowledge repository or lessons learned database, that may be helpful. If an 
­organization-­wide risk management approach, such as ­pre-­defined risk cat­
egories, roles and responsibilities, common terms to use, templates, risk state­
ment formats, and authority levels for decisions, is in place, it notes whether 
or not it will be followed or whether changes to it are warranted. It also 
describes how proposed changes will be identified and managed in order that 
they do not pose additional risks to the program. It notes the process for the 
program manager to learn of changes at the project level that may affect other 
projects in the program or the overall program in order that the program 
management team can then review these changes for possible new risks.
Program risk categories: This section describes specific categories of risks that may 
affect the program. Typically these categories may include external environmen­
tal risks, such as new regulations or standards or strategic issues; ­program-­level 
risks, such as ones involving program stakeholders, the Governance Board, and 
how the program components are organized; ­project-­level risks, while managed 
by the project manager, that may affect other components in the program; 
­operational-­level risks, such as ones that involve transition of the program 
benefits into the overall operations of the organization or to the customer or 
possible new systems in the organization that may affect program benefits; 
­portfolio-­related risks, since the portfolio level defines the organization’s strate­
gic intent, which then may affect the overall priority of the program in terms of 
resources; and ­benefit-­related risks, which involve the impact of risks from the 
component level to the overall delivery of program benefits. If a risk breakdown 
structure is prepared, it should be attached to this plan.
Roles and responsibilities: This section describes the roles and responsibilities 
of the program management team regarding risk management planning, 
identification, analysis, response planning, monitoring, and control. It may 
be appropriate on certain projects to designate a member of the core team to 

Program Life Cycle Management  ◾  177
focus on risk management at the program level and to work with the various 
project managers to review risks at the project level and to conduct project 
risk audits. This section describes how risks will be escalated from compo­
nent managers to the program manager, and from the program manager, 
as appropriate, to the Governance Board, and to describe specific roles and 
responsibilities at each level. It also addresses roles and responsibilities for 
risk management of ­inter-­component risks and for analysis of root causes of 
these risks in order that an appropriate risk response can be provided.
Probability and impact matrix: This section describes definitions of probabil­
ity and impact for use on the program. These definitions can be related to the 
program’s objectives or to the program’s expected benefits. Numeric and non­
numeric approaches can be used. This matrix then serves as a table in which 
to show specific combinations of risk probability and risk impact that are 
then considered to be high, medium, or low in terms of importance to help 
plan appropriate risk responses. This matrix serves to help prioritize those 
risks that require the greatest attention from the program management team.
Risk analysis considerations: In order to support an environment that is con­
ducive to risk management, this section states how the program team assists 
in risk analysis. To do so, this section describes available information, avail­
able resources, time and cost, the quality of the available information, and 
ways to be apprised of activities that are outside of the direct control of the 
project teams such as establishing different communication channels between 
program components and with other programs.
Risk management budget: This section describes the budget or contingency 
that will be set aside to focus on risk management throughout the program 
life cycle. It therefore provides a cost estimate for risk management at the pro­
gram level to be used to determine the funding and resources required. It also 
describes the process to follow when it is necessary to allocate contingency 
reserve in order to respond to ­program-­level risks.
Risk management schedule: Although risk management is a continual activity 
throughout the program, this section describes the specific risk management 
activities that should be included in the program’s schedule. Items such as 
when a program risk management planning meeting, program risk reviews 
or audits, and analysis of lessons learned from risk management initiatives in 
the program are planned are examples of activities to be part of the schedule.
Stakeholder tolerances for risk: This section describes the tolerance level of 
the key program stakeholders in terms of risk. The stakeholder register and 
the stakeholder engagement plan can be used as this section is prepared, 
and interviews can be conducted with key stakeholders. The purpose is 
to show those stakeholders in terms of their influence on the program in 
generating and responding to program risk based on their tolerance for 
risk. It considers the culture of the organization in terms of its approach 
to risk management.

178  ◾  Implementing Program Management
Risk reporting: This section describes the content and format for the program’s 
risk register, which will be used throughout the program for risk reporting 
and to assist in risk identification, analysis, response planning, and risk moni­
toring and control. It also describes communication approaches to be used in 
the program with the various stakeholders and the Governance Board mem­
bers concerning risks.
Risk tracking: This section describes the process to track identified risks and 
to recognize any new risks that may affect the program. It also describes how 
the program’s risk management process will be audited and the frequency of 
the audits to be conducted. It describes the process for documenting lessons 
learned based on the program’s risk management activities.
Approvals: This section contains the written approval of the risk management 
plan by the program sponsor, program manager, program management office 
director, members of the Governance Board, and other stakeholders.

Program Risk Register
The risk register is a critical program ­decision-­making tool. It combines in one place 
the needed decision criteria such as the likelihood, status, and impact of program 
risks. It is first discussed in section 8.7.2 in the Standard for Program Management—
Third Edition (2013).
Program Risk Register Instructions
Purpose: The risk register is used throughout the program. Its use begins when 
a risk is identified and continues until all risks have been closed or are no 
longer considered a threat or opportunity to the program. It complements the 
program risk management plan but does not replace it.

182  ◾  Implementing Program Management
	
	
With continuous use of the risk register throughout the program, and 
monitoring the impact and probability of occurrence of a program risk, the 
program management team can monitor possible risks and use proactive 
actions to prevent their occurrence. Such an approach can be effective in 
ensuring the risk responses have the desired effect.
	
	
Resolution of certain risks may be handled by the risk owner; others may 
need to be escalated to the program manager or to the Governance Board. 
The decision as to which risk response to use and when to close a risk may 
require involvement from other stakeholders. Change requests to various 
items in the program may lead to a need to revise the risk register or to add 
newly identified risks to it. Even though the program has an issue register, it 
does not replace the need for a risk register.
	
	
In the Project Management Institute’s Standard for Program Management—
Third Edition (2013), the risk register updated as described in section 
8.7.3, Program Risk Analysis; 8.7.4 Program Risk Response Planning; and 
8.7.4, Program Risk Monitoring and Control.
	
	
The risk register is designed as a table, and a description of its contents 
follows:
	
1.	 Risk identification number: Assign an identification number to the 
risk.
	
2.	 PWBS number: Link the risk to the corresponding program package in 
the program work breakdown structure.
	
3.	 Risk description: Describe the risk and why it is significant to the 
program.
	
4.	 Identified by: List the person who identified the risk and provide contact 
information.
	
5.	 Date: State the date the risk was identified and added to the register.
	
6.	 Risk type: Describe the type of risk. Follow the categories established in 
the risk management plan.
	
7.	 Root cause: Describe the ­program-­level root cause of the risk in order to 
determine potential responses. Doing so can also help group risks into 
causes for analysis and review and avoid potential future program risks.
	
8.	 Probability/­impact: State the probability/­impact of the risk to the pro­
gram. Use a probability/­impact matrix.
	
9.	 Risk owner: Identify a member of the program management team to 
be responsible for the risk and to track it until it is resolved and closed. 
Provide contact information for the owner.
	
10.	 Symptoms/­warning signs: Identify various triggers or warning symp­
toms to alert the program management team that the risk might occur. 
For example, poor morale on the program management team might indi­
cate that the program’s resources may be affected as people may choose to 
leave the program for other opportunities.

Program Life Cycle Management  ◾  183
	
11.	 Proposed response: State the proposed risk response. Examples include:
◾
◾Negative risks or threats:
−
−Avoid
−
−Transfer
−
−Mitigate
−
−Accept
◾
◾Positive risks or opportunities:
−
−Enhance
−
−Exploit
−
−Share
−
−Accept
	
	
Note that if a risk is accepted, a contingency plan will be required. 
Follow the process outlined in the risk management plan in the risk man­
agement budget section in allocating contingency reserve to respond to 
­program-­level risks. Describe the budget and schedule activities needed 
to implement the response. Follow the template for the contingency plan.
	
12.	 Actual response: If the risk does in fact occur, indicate which response 
strategy was selected. If it was not the planned response, describe why for 
purposes of lessons learned.
	
13.	 Approved by: State who approved the risk response. Examples include:
	
a.	 Risk owner
	
b.	 Program manager
	
c.	 Governance Board
	
14.	 Date: State the date the risk response was approved.
	
15.	 Subsequent impacts: State any subsequent impacts as a result of the risk 
response. Examples include the need to use a fallback plan if the response 
was not effective, residual risks that remain and may affect the program 
at a later time after the response was implemented, and the identification 
of subsidiary risks as a result of implementing the response. Use the risk 
register to state any residual or secondary risks as appropriate.
	
16.	 Date closed: State the date the risk was closed.
	
17.	 Notes: Use this field for any additional notes about the risk.
Probability/­Impact Matrix
The probability/­impact matrix is used to determine the overall priority of each risk 
in the risk register to the program. It also serves as way to communicate the impor­
tance of the risk to program stakeholders, as a red, yellow, green approach may be 
helpful as part of this matrix.
Risk probability describes the degree of uncertainty, while risk impact states the 
magnitude of the effect the risk will have on program objectives. The example in 
the table presents one approach to consider. It also relates to the variances based on 
stakeholder tolerances for risks as described in the risk management plan.

In preparing the matrix, consider items such as:
The time the risk is expected to occur
Whether the risk is expected to occur at a certain phase in the program’s life cycle
Whether the probability or the impact is expected to change over time
Whether there is a date after which the risk is expected not to affect the program
The ease of managing and controlling the risk
The completeness of the description of the risk in the risk register
The level of vulnerability to the project should the risk occur
Whether the cause of the risk is due to the program or to other events
Update and review the probability/­impact matrix as risk responses are imple­
mented, risks are closed, and new risks are added to the register. Note the results of 
the probability/­impact matrix in the risk register.
Contingency Plan
The most serious program risks need at least a preliminary plan that can be imple­
mented should they occur. Not having a contingency plan for an occurring risk 
is serious and possibly a threat to overall program success. The contingency plan 
is discussed in section 8.7.4, Program Risk Response Planning the Standard for 
Program Management—Third Edition (2013). This section also mentions contin­
gency budgets and contingency reserves, pointing out contingency reserves are for 
use at the program level as each project also should have a contingency reserve. Cost 
and schedule contingency reserves are also mentioned in section 8.7.5, Program 
Risk Monitoring and Control.
Contingency Plan Instructions
The contingency plan will include the following:
Purpose: A brief introductory statement defining the purpose of the contin­
gency plan, such as:

Program Life Cycle Management  ◾  185
The contingency plan describes the impact on the program for those 
risks in the risk register that require such a plan.
	
	
This plan complements the program risk management plan and the risk 
register. It is prepared only for those risks in which a contingency plan is 
warranted. It is used for unknown risks that cannot be managed proac­
tively and also for those identified risks in which the response strategy is to 
actively accept the risk. Time, money, and resources then will be required if 
this is the case, regardless if the risk is a threat to the program or an oppor­
tunity. The program management team uses the contingency plans to assess 
impacts across the program and to see if any of them are interrelated to miti­
gate risk activities that could affect the program components.
	
	
When a contingency plan is implemented, it will require a change request and 
should be handled as part of the program’s integrated change control system.
Trigger conditions: Each risk should have certain triggers or warning signs 
associated with it. This section lists these triggers, which then will result in 
executing the contingency plan, such as missing a key milestone.
Cost impact: Each contingency plan requires a cost estimate. This section states the 
needed budget to implement the contingency plan and considers the associated 
impacts on the schedule, resources, and deliverables as the estimate is prepared.
Schedule impact: If there is a need to implement a contingency plan, it will 
affect the program’s schedule. This section describes this impact and shows 
the need to update or change duration estimates of key activities or to change 
or add milestones as appropriate.
Required resources: If a contingency plan is executed, resources will be 
required. This section states these necessary resources.
Responsibilities: This section describes the responsibilities associated with 
implementing the contingency plan. It describes the various stakeholders and 
their level of involvement. It states the primary point of contact on the pro­
gram management team.
Approvals: This section contains the written approval of the contingency plan 
by the program manager and other stakeholders as required.

Schedule Management Plan
The program must have discipline and control in maintenance of its official sched­
ule. The schedule management plan describes how this discipline will be achieved 
and is prepared as noted in section 8.8.1 Program Schedule Planning in the 
Standard for Program Management—Third Edition (2013).
Schedule Management Plan Instructions
The schedule management plan will include the following:
Purpose: A brief introductory statement defining the purpose of the schedule 
management plan, such as:
The schedule management plan identifies an ­agreed-­upon sequence 
of component deliveries (projects and ­non-­project work) to enable 

188  ◾  Implementing Program Management
them to be planned and managed. It sets forth a scheduling meth­
odology, states the scheduling tool to be used, and sets the format 
and criteria for monitoring and controlling the program schedule.
	
	
This plan provides the program management team and stakeholders with 
an approach to how the schedule will be managed throughout the program. It 
enables the program manager to identify any risks associated with the sched­
ule and any component issues that may need to be escalated for resolution. A 
common understanding among program stakeholders is required as to how 
to clearly define the program’s schedule status. Although the plan is drafted 
early in the program with a ­high-­level master schedule to show the benefits 
and outputs from each of the components, it is an iterative document that 
should be further refined in each phase of your program.
	
	
In the Project Management Institute’s Standard for Program Management—
Third Edition (2013), the schedule management plan is discussed in section 
8.8.1, Program Schedule Planning. The emphasis is on the order and timing 
of the program’s components to ensure the program’s benefits are realized 
as planned. It builds on the road map, the scope management plan, and the 
PWBS. As it is developed, it then may require updates to the roadmap and 
inputs to the risk register.
Program schedule constraints: This section describes constraints, both inter­
nal and external, that may affect the program schedule. Examples include 
funding, resource availability, technical considerations, contracts, predeter­
mined milestones, environmental issues, other external dependencies, and 
other factors in the program environment.
Program schedule standards: Each organization has its own schedule standards. 
This section describes the standards applicable to the program such as data 
formatting, versioning, the methodology to use, performance thresholds, and 
the content of presentations and reports. This section also notes any processes 
in place for schedule updates, the need for training for the program team, and 
considerations concerning contractors and their access to the schedule.
Delivery of incremental benefits: Since the purpose of a program is to deliver 
benefits that might not be realized if the projects in the program were man­
aged individually, this section of the plan provides a description of the order 
in which the incremental benefits should be delivered. It also contains com­
ponent milestones to show when program benefits are expected to be realized.
Schedule management software: This section states the schedule management 
software to be used in the program, as it helps to manage and control the 
schedule throughout the program life cycle. The software tool to be used 
should be appropriate to the scope and complexity of the program.
Program funding schedule: This section describes the funding schedule for the 
program’s revenue and expenses. Money payable to contractors or for other 
program expenses, for example, cannot be paid unless it is available to the 

Program Life Cycle Management  ◾  189
program. Schedule activities may need to occur at the latest possible start in 
order to defer expenses until as close as possible to when the funding will 
be available.
Schedule tracking and monitoring methods: This section describes the meth­
ods to use to track and monitor schedule performance according to the master 
program schedule. Methods to track and monitor all ­high-­level component 
and program activities and milestones against planned timelines should be 
stated. If earned value is to be used, it should be stated in this section, includ­
ing the method to use to report progress.
Schedule metrics: This section describes how schedule progress is to be mea­
sured in the program. For example, if the schedule is behind by 10%, does this 
mean the overall schedule is red, yellow, or green? This section describes what 
will be measured and how status will be reported against these metrics.
Approvals: This section contains the written approval of the schedule manage­
ment plan by the program sponsor, program manager, program management 
office director, members of the Governance Board, and other stakeholders.

Program Financial Plan
The program financial plan helps deal with the myriad of challenges that arise in 
the financial management arena, some of which can be fatal if not properly man­
aged. It is noted in section 8.2.3, Program Financial Plan Development, in the 
Standard for Program Management—Third Edition (2013).
Program Financial Plan Instructions
The program financial plan will include the following:
Purpose: A brief introductory statement defining the purpose of the financial 
plan for the program, such as:
The financial plan documents all the program’s financial aspects, as 
it describes the funding schedules and milestones, baseline budget, 
contact payments and schedules, financial reporting processes and 
mechanisms, and financial metrics.
	
	
This plan takes into account items such as risk reserves, potential cash 
flow problems, international currency rate fluctuations, future interest rate 
increases or decreases, local laws as appropriate, trends in the cost of materi­
als and supplies, and contract incentives and penalty clauses. It also describes 
any funds to be retained in contracts as invoices are submitted for payment in 
those situations in which the contract terms and conditions contain a clause 
that specifies that a certain percent of the price will be retained and paid 
once the contract has been completed. It is necessary to recognize that pro­
grams may have multiple sources of funding, tend to be long in duration, 
may have multiple contractors, and may involve international work. Many of 
the environmental factors that affect this plan may be outside of the program 
manager’s direct control. Further, although the plan is drafted early in the 
program, it is an iterative document that should be further refined as the 
program progresses through the life cycle.
	
	
In the Project Management Institute’s Standard for Program Management—
Third Edition (2013), the program financial plan is discussed in section 8.2.3 
and builds on the financial framework. It is used as described in section 8.2.4, 
Component Cost Estimation; 8.2.5, Program Cost Budgeting; and section 
8.2.6, Program Financial Monitoring and Control.
Financial framework and goals: This section identifies the overall financial 
environment for the program, as it pinpoints funds to be expended at key 
milestones and helps to ensure that money is spent efficiently with the least 
waste possible.
Funding constraints: This section describes methods to receive program fund­
ing since it is rare that 100% of the required funding is provided when the 

Program Life Cycle Management  ◾  193
program is initiated. It describes release of funds at specific milestones or 
on an annual or fiscal year basis. Other examples of constraints are if it is a 
global program, whether payment is to be made in local currencies; future 
changes in material prices; or, for contracts, the percent of payment that is to 
be retained until the contractor’s work is complete.
Program operational costs: This section describes the specific costs associated 
with the operation of the program. It includes infrastructure costs, such as 
required facilities and systems, or the costs associated with the program man­
agement office, including human resources.
Format and criteria for cost estimating: This section describes the various 
tools and techniques to be used to estimate the costs associated with the 
program in order that an overall cost estimate for the program can be pre­
pared. Typically, the cost estimate will be prepared in stages given the dura­
tion and complexity of the program. Once the cost estimate is approved, it 
then becomes the basis for the program budget, as the budget baseline is the 
target for measuring overall financial progress.
Program payment schedule: This section identifies the schedule and milestones 
where funding for the program is received from the funding organization. 
This section is needed because program funds typically are spent in advance 
of receipt of revenues or benefits realization.
Program financial metrics: This section describes the specific financial met­
rics for the program by which the program’s benefits are measured. These 
metrics are necessary because as changes to schedules and costs occur to the 
program, these metrics are used against those set at the time the program was 
approved to help determine whether or not it should be continued. Examples 
of metrics for consideration are funds expended against total funds avail­
able, earned value measurements, the use of contingency and management 
reserves, return on investment versus that stated in the business case, and the 
payback period versus that stated in the business case.
Methods for financial monitoring and control: This section describes the 
approach to be used to identify factors that may create changes to the finan­
cial baseline, methods to monitor the environment for changes that may 
affect the financial plan, ways to monitor the disbursement of funds to con­
tractors, methods to identify impacts to program components from overruns 
or ­under-­runs, methods to manage the program’s infrastructure, and meth­
ods to communicate the financial situation to the program stakeholders.
Remaining budget allocations: This section describes the process to return 
any remaining budget allocations to the overall program budget. It is a con­
sideration during the close program procurement process when all approved 
payment requests have been processed.
Approvals: This section contains the written approval of the financial plan by 
the program sponsor, program manager, program management office direc­
tor, members of the Governance Board, and other stakeholders.

the means of arriving at a contract. It defers to the contracts management plan, as 
noted in section 8.4.2, Program Procurement, for the purpose of contracts admin­
istration and execution.
Procurement Management Plan Instructions
The procurement management plan includes the following:
Purpose: A brief introductory statement defining the purpose of the procure­
ment management plan, such as:
The procurement management plan describes the process used to 
determine what to acquire, such as facilities, goods, materials, and 
external resources, based on product requirements and describes the 
contractual methods that will be used.
	
	
This plan should be prepared early in the planning process, as the procure­
ment process is critical to program success and benefits realization. Careful plan­
ning and analysis are required and cannot be understated in order that funding 
is used in the most effective way. Although the plan is drafted early in the pro­
gram, it is an iterative document that should be further refined as the program 
moves through the phases of the life cycle, as it may require updates, especially 
during monitoring and controlling. It also may require updates because of 
changes in organizational strategy or because of risk responses, which may lead 
to ­make-­or-­buy decisions. This plan also does not replace the procurement man­
agement plans to be prepared by the project managers in the program for their 
specific projects.
	
	
In the Project Management Institute’s Standard for Program Management—
Third Edition (2013), the procurement management plan is described in sec­
tion 8.4.1 and is in then used as the contracts management plan is developed 
and may be updated as a result of the contract administration. It uses the 
PWBS and ­make-­or-­buy decision criteria.
Procurement planning approach: This section describes how the program man­
agement team will determine which items—facilities, goods, materials, and 
external resources—should be handled through the procurement process. It 
describes the ­make-­or-­buy process to follow and the various items that should be 
considered. These include external factors, market conditions, regulations, bud­
get, and available suppliers. It also states the organization’s capability to evaluate, 
procure, and then manage all items that are handled through procurements.
Required and available resources and sourcing decisions: This section describes 
the specific resources required for the program and whether or not they are 
available within the organization or need to be procured from external sources.

198  ◾  Implementing Program Management
Required procurements: This section identifies the required procurements for 
the program. In preparing this section, planning is needed to ensure that 
there is an emphasis on shared resources across the program so that additional 
costs are not required later in the program life cycle.
Statements of work for each item to be procured: This section describes state­
ments of work for each item to be procured. It is based on review of the 
program scope statement and the program work breakdown structure. It is 
noted that the statements of work are for items at the program level. It may 
be possible, and desirable, to group items to be procured as one procurement 
item in a single statement of work. These statements of work then guide the 
procurement process, as it may be different for the various items that will be 
procured. They serve to describe in specific detail the procurement item in 
order that prospective sellers can determine whether or not they can provide 
the required items. Information in the statement of work may include speci­
fications, quantities required, quality levels, performance requirements, the 
period of performance, and other requirements as appropriate. This section 
also states how work will be managed for each item that is procured and 
whether the work will be done internally or externally.
Procurement documents: This section states the specific procurement docu­
ments that will be used for each item to be procured, such as request for pro­
posal, request for quotation, or invitation to bid. The purpose is to structure 
these documents in a way that prospective sellers can prepare an accurate and 
complete response, and the program management team can then evaluate the 
responses easily. The documents should be ones that enable the prospective 
supplier to propose an alternative means of meeting the requirement if pos­
sible to provide greater flexibility.
Contract types: This section defines and documents the specific contract types 
that will be used. They will vary based on the nature of the procurement. While 
­fixed-­price, ­cost-­plus, and time and materials contracts are typical, other vehi­
cles such as basic ordering agreements, other ­umbrella-­type contracts, leasing, 
and integrated volume discounts should be considered as appropriate.
Qualified seller lists: In order to expedite the procurement process, qualified 
seller lists may be appropriate. This section describes how these lists will be 
developed—by others in the organization, such as members of the procure­
ment department or by the program management team. It also states how 
information about qualified sellers will be obtained. A variety of tools and 
techniques can be used, such as requests for information, the Internet, adver­
tising, directories, associations, and catalogs. This section also states whether 
­on-­site visits will be made as part of the process to develop these lists. It may 
be useful as well for the program management team to contact seller refer­
ences to obtain information on past performance.
Proposals: This section describes the processes, procedures, and evaluation cri­
teria that will be used to review proposals from potential sellers. It states 

Program Life Cycle Management  ◾  199
who will be involved in evaluating the proposals that are received so that 
there is no bias in the process. The evaluation criteria may be limited to price 
for certain items or may be more complex for other items. If the latter, it is 
appropriate to consider whether prospective sellers understand the require­
ments, the management approach to be followed, the overall cost, the techni­
cal approach to be used, the people who will support the procurement, the 
schedule for deliverable items, the risk involved, past performance and refer­
ences, intellectual property and proprietary rights, financial considerations, 
and warranties.
Approvals: This section contains the written approval of the procurement manage­
ment plan by the program sponsor, program manager, program management 
office director, members of the Governance Board, and other stakeholders.

Contracts Management Plan
The contracts management plan builds on the procurement management plan, 
elaborating on contracts administration to ensure appropriate cost, quality, and 
schedule. It also is noted in section 8.4.2, Program Procurement in the Standard for 
Program Management—Third Edition (2013).
Contracts Management Plan Instructions
The contracts management plan will include the following:
Purpose: A brief introductory statement defining the purpose of the contracts 
management plan, such as:
The contracts management plan describes the process that will be 
followed to administer each of the ­program-­level contracts to ensure 
that deliverables meet requirements concerning cost, schedule, 
and quality.
	
	
This plan builds on the procurement management plan, which is devel­
oped earlier in the program. In fact, once the contracts management plan is 
approved, it can become an appendix to the procurement management plan. 
It is an iterative document and should be reviewed periodically by the pro­
gram management team, especially as contracts are closed, and new contracts 
are awarded to see if changes are warranted. This plan covers the contract 
administration activities throughout the life of the contract.
	
	
In the Project Management Institute’s Standard for Program Management—
Third Edition (2013), the contracts management plan is noted in section 
8.4.2. Updates to this plan may result from as the contracts are under way.
Roles and responsibilities: This section describes the roles and responsibili­
ties of the program management team, the component managers, the pro­
curement department, the legal department, and others in the organization 
concerning contract administration. It states the actions the program man­
agement team can take on its own without involvement from the procurement 

Program Life Cycle Management  ◾  203
or legal departments. It also describes how the program management team 
will interface with the people on various projects in the program respon­
sible for contract administration. Experts may also be needed, especially for 
global programs in which specific knowledge about contract laws in other 
countries will apply where the procurement will be awarded. Actions to be 
taken by whom if conditions outlined in the contract are not met are stated 
in this section.
­Buyer-­seller performance requirements: For overall program success, a part­
nership is needed between the buyer and the sellers. This section states the 
specific performance requirements each party should meet. For example, it 
describes the process to review each deliverable. While the deliverable due 
date is specified in the contract, the buyer should review it according to a 
predetermined schedule. The seller then should have a certain schedule in 
order to respond to needed changes if rework is required. Nontechnical 
factors, such as establishment of trust and excellent working relationships 
between the parties, also are critical to program success. The buyer enables the 
seller to complete the contract, pays the ­agreed-­upon price, formally accepts 
the deliverable, and closes the contract. The seller completes the deliverable 
according to the contractual terms and conditions.
Monitoring and control: This section describes specific monitoring and controlling 
processes to be followed. It identifies the circumstances to consider if the contrac­
tual agreement is violated, to ensure that the deliverables meet requirements, to 
determine that the relationship between the buyer and seller ends as stipulated, 
and to ensure that any ­post-­program communications occur as specified.
Subcontract selection process criteria: Since many prime contractors in a 
program issue subcontracts, this section states the selection criteria for these 
subcontracts to ensure consistency in meeting overall program objectives and 
benefit expectations. If the subcontract involves an initiative in another coun­
try, consideration of local laws is necessary. Contractual terms and conditions 
should be specified for the subcontractors as appropriate.
Schedules: This section describes the process the program management team 
will use to coordinate the various schedules prepared by the program con­
tractors and to ensure that these schedules are part of the program’s master 
schedule. This section is required because the lack of delivery or performance 
of one contractor may affect the overall performance of the program and 
the delivery of the expected program benefits. It states how often revised 
schedules will be provided by the contractors, and the process to learn of any 
problems so corrective action can be taken as quickly as possible. It describes 
the tools and techniques to be used, as it may be beneficial for all the program 
contractors to use the same scheduling software for technical compatibility.
Meetings to be held with contractors: In many large programs, much of the 
work may be done by contractors. If this is the case in the program, this sec­
tion would describe whether any meetings are planned to be held with the 

204  ◾  Implementing Program Management
various contractors to better coordinate the work to be done and to resolve 
any conflicts that could occur during the process. The program management 
team then can use these meetings to coordinate and resolve any scheduling 
or other constraints.
Status reporting: This section describes the status reports to be provided by 
the various program contractors to describe progress in terms of achieving 
contractual objectives, and how the individual reports then will be merged 
into an overall program status report. It states the frequency in which the 
reports will be prepared and the format to be used. Ideally, each contractor 
should follow a standard format, which should include as a minimum sched­
ule, budget, scope, risk, benefits, and quality metrics and approval status of 
program deliverables.
Contract performance review meetings: The section describes the items to be 
covered in contractor performance reviews and how often these meetings will be 
held. These meetings are useful not only to assess performance to date but also 
to determine if product pricing has changed significantly and requires revisions.
Change control: Change requests may be needed because of numerous factors, 
such as a change in overall strategy, a change in requirements, performance 
issues, etc. This section describes the process to follow when a change is 
needed to a contract in the program. It describes the contract change control 
system, as it states when change requests are required, the format to use to 
submit a change request, who must analyze requests for their impact on other 
aspects of the program, documentation requirements, and who is authorized 
to approve change requests. It also describes the process to use to notify the 
contractors when a change request has been approved or rejected.
Payment control: This section describes the payment control system that will 
be used to ensure that all invoices are processed in a timely fashion, that 
contract terms are followed, and that duplicate payments are not made. It 
describes the necessary approvals before a payment can be made.
Contract closure: This section describes the specific process the program team 
will use to close contracts and to determine that all contractual obligations 
have been met. It describes the specific documents to be reviewed, documents 
that will be archived, how lessons learned will be conducted, any performance 
reviews that may be held, contract closure audits that may be conducted, stake­
holders to be notified, and any required ­follow-­up work or warranties. This sec­
tion also describes the process to follow if contracts are terminated early, such 
as documenting why the contract was terminated, determining the extent of 
the actual work that was performed, and updating contractual records.
Approvals: This section contains the written approval of the contracts manage­
ment plan by the program sponsor, program manager, program management 
office director, members of the Governance Board, and other stakeholders.

Interface Management Plan
The interface management plan is not in either the Second or Third Editions of 
the Standard for Program Management. However, throughout the Third Edition 
(2013), the need for the program manager to focus on the interfaces between 
the program components and also the interfaces at the portfolio level to ensure the 
program remains in alignment with organizational strategies is emphasized. We 
feel it is useful for those programs that have complex interfaces and as a stimulus for 
consideration of the matters it addresses on smaller programs.

Program Life Cycle Management  ◾  209
If multiple individuals are taking care of relationships with a given external 
organization on the same matters, conflicts could result. Neglected interfaces with 
known stakeholders are almost always problematic. The interface management plan 
addresses these issues and more.
Interface Management Plan Instructions
The interface management plan includes the following:
Purpose: A brief introductory statement defining the purpose of the interface 
management plan, such as:
The interface management plan identifies and maps interrelationships 
within the program, with other programs in the portfolio, and with fac­
tors outside of the program. It identifies interfaces in terms of ones that 
are organizational, technical, interpersonal, logistical, and political.
	
	
It addresses internal and external interfaces as well as interdependencies 
and interrelationships. It then assists in identifying risks with these inter­
relationships throughout the management of the program. It describes roles 
and responsibilities for program interface management. Although the plan is 
drafted early in the program, it is an iterative document that should be fur­
ther refined as the program moves through the life cycle.
Identification of organizational interfaces: This section defines each organi­
zational interface in the program, such as the various departments or units 
within the organization to be involved in the program, the current relation­
ships among them, and the informal and formal relationships among them. 
It also describes the relationship with the portfolio manager and the program 
management office.
Identification of technical interfaces: This section states the different disci­
plines and specialties that are needed to complete the program. It includes 
items such as software, subsystems, testing, and equipment that may need 
to be coordinated. It also should describe whether there are any transitions 
within the program management life cycle that may present challenges.
Identification of interpersonal interfaces: This section describes the formal 
and informal reporting relationships among members of the program team. 
It includes any cultural or language differences that may affect these working 
relationships and describes whether any levels of trust and respect already 
exist among team members. It also states ­customer-­supplier relationships.
Identification of logistical interfaces: This section describes logistical inter­
faces, such as the use of virtual teams in the program and whether stakehold­
ers are in different locations, time zones, or countries.

210  ◾  Implementing Program Management
Identification of political interfaces: This section describes the individual 
goals and objectives of program stakeholders, to especially note whether peo­
ple have informal power in areas of importance to the program. It lists any 
informal alliances that may exist.
Management approach for component interfaces: This section describes 
how interfaces between the various program components will be managed. 
Changes often can occur because of interfaces with various program compo­
nents (projects and ­non-­project work), and a change to one component may 
affect another component in the program.
Management approach for interfaces with the program’s Governance 
Board: This section describes the approach to follow to manage interfaces 
with other enterprises, such as customers, suppliers, and other parts of the 
organization, which are typically handled through work with the program’s 
Governance Board.
Management approach for interfaces with other aspects of the program: 
This section describes how interface planning will be coordinated with other 
aspects of the program, such as with schedule development, human resource 
planning, communications planning, the program work breakdown struc­
ture, and risk management planning and analysis.
Roles and responsibilities for interface management: This section states the 
various roles and responsibilities for interface management in the program.
Approvals: This section contains the written approval of the interface manage­
ment plan by the program sponsor, program manager, program management 
office director, members of the Governance Board, and other stakeholders.

Program Management Plan
According to the Standard for Program Management—Third Edition (2013), the 
program management plan is described in section 7.1.1.2, Program Preparation, 
and it includes candidate program components and the management plans that are 
needed to achieve the program’s objectives. It does not list all of these management 
plans per se, and each organization can then decide which plans should be included 
considering the plans described in this chapter.
The subsidiary plans the Standard for Program Management—Third Edition 
(2013) does mention in section 8.3.2, Program Management Plan Development 
are the:

214  ◾  Implementing Program Management
◾
◾Program financial management plan
◾
◾Benefits realization plan
◾
◾Stakeholder engagement plan
◾
◾Governance plan
◾
◾Communications management plan

◾Scope management plan
◾
◾Schedule management plan
◾
◾Resource management plan
◾
◾Procurement management plan
◾
◾Program documentation archive plan [discussed as part of the knowledge 
management plan in governance chapter]
Integrating these subsidiary plans provides the basis to set the overall framework 
for managerial controls and determines how best to manage and control the pro­
gram’s components. It also notes that updates to the program management plan 
may be required:
◾
◾When baseline are established
◾
◾When certain types of change requests are approved
The Standard for Program Management—Third Edition describes that this plan 
is developed based on the organization’s strategic plan, the business case, and the 
program charter. It also mentions “other outputs” (section 7.1.1.2) but does not 
specify them. We would suggest the: program roadmap, scope statement, pro­
gram work breakdown structure, schedule, and metrics. Once the program plan 
is approved, since it is the primary outcome of the program definition phase, the 
program then moves according to the Standard to the program benefit delivery 
phase. The program management plan then is a reference document that is used 
to measure overall program success. Its objective is to ensure the program remains 
aligned with the organization’s strategy in order to deliver its proposed benefits.
The items in the program management plan may be separate documents or 
some or all of them could be placed in a single volume, if desired, for smaller pro­
grams. In some cases, one of these plans could simply point to a standard organiza­
tion plan. Regardless, the program management plan establishes the approach the 
program team will follow to contribute toward achievement of the organization’s 
strategic goals and objectives.
Program Management Plan Instructions
The program management plan includes the following:
Purpose: A brief introductory statement defining the purpose of the program 
management plan, such as:

Program Life Cycle Management  ◾  215
The program management plan provides direction as to how the 
program will be managed, monitored and controlled, and closed; 
guides the allocation and use of program resources; and defines the 
program’s deliverables and benefits.
	
	
Once the program management plan is approved, program execution or 
delivery of the program’s benefits begins. This plan contains the various sub­
sidiary plans, and they can be set up as attachments to the program manage­
ment plan, or they can be consolidated into a single document. Although this 
plan is prepared early in the program’s life cycle, it is an iterative document 
that is expected to change throughout the program as the program progresses. 
It also is a starting point for project managers working on the program as they 
develop the plans for their specific projects, as it provides overall guidance. If 
the program begins after several components have been under way, the exist­
ing project plans should be reviewed as this plan is developed.
	
	
The Standard for Program Management—Third Edition (2013) suggests 
that some long programs may lead to an increase in opportunities through­
out the program’s duration, and in these cases, it may be appropriate to state 
an innovation strategy as a component to the plan. For example, at the time 
the program was initiated, certain components were approved to be part of 
the program as shown in the roadmap. But, as the program continues, other 
projects may need to be added or replaced with ones that would lead to more 
benefits. This innovation strategy helps to compensate for the changing envi­
ronment in which the program will be executed and may require a sepa­
rate budget to compensate for any possible threats to the program or even a 
decrease in efficiency.
Program end result and schedule: This section describes the key program deliv­
erables and their schedule for completion. It also describes the major program 
benefits. It provides background information, including why the program was 
initiated, and how it aligns with the organization’s mission, vision, and values.
Program budget and cash flow requirements: This section contains infor­
mation on the budget that is needed in order to complete the program. It 
describes cash flow requirements, referring to the financial management plan 
for details.
Program risks and issues: This section presents an overview of the key program 
risks, opportunities, and issues. It notes that details are included in the pro­
gram risk management plan and risk register.
Program dependencies: This section describes the key dependencies between 
this program and other programs and projects under way by the organization.
Program assumptions: This section lists the assumptions or factors that the 
program management team considers to be true, real, or certain that are part 
of this plan. Subsidiary plans will describe some assumptions in greater detail 
as appropriate.

216  ◾  Implementing Program Management
Program constraints: This section describes constraints, or restrictions or limits, 
that may affect overall program performance. These constraints are described 
in greater detail in some of the subsidiary program plans as appropriate.
Program management approach: This section describes the approach the pro­
gram management team plans to follow as it executes the program and the 
methodology, tools, and techniques to be used. It describes how performance 
will be measured. If the organization has an existing program manage­
ment methodology, it states whether or not it will be used as is or whether it 
requires tailoring. It also describes how the program management team will 
work with component managers on the program, functional managers in 
the organization, the program’s Governance Board, other stakeholders, and 
customers. It describes the metrics that will be used to help track and monitor 
the program to ensure deliverables are completed as planned, and expected 
benefits are realized. It shows how the various plans are integrated and coor­
dinated at the program level. It also states how the program management 
team will document and use lessons learned throughout the program. Any 
supporting feasibility studies (technical, economic, ethical, social, environ­
mental, etc.) should be attached to this section.
Program organization: This section states how the program will be organized. 
It describes the composition of the program management core team, the use 
of a program management office, and the interaction with the program’s 
Governance Board.
Program management information system: This section describes the 
approach the program management team will use to collect and manage all 
­program-­related information. It shows the various tools and processes that 
will be used, such as software, documentation management, configuration 
management, knowledge repositories, earned value management, risk data 
base and analysis, financial management systems, requirements management 
activities and tools, and the use of a program management office. It describes 
roles and responsibilities for use of this system and access privileges to it. This 
system is used for overall program performance monitoring and control, so 
this section also describes the specific reports that will be prepared and how 
they will be distributed, following the program communications manage­
ment plan.
Schedule milestones and budget goals for program components: This sec­
tion describes the ­high-­level schedule milestones for each of the program’s 
components (projects and ­non-­project work) and also includes the allocated 
budget for each component.
Tolerance ranges and decision making: Each organization has different levels 
of tolerance for variances in cost, scope, schedule, and risks and in how they 
will be handled. This section describes the level of tolerances for the pro­
gram based on expectations of stakeholders and members of the program’s 

Program Life Cycle Management  ◾  217
Governance Board. It also states approvals required if the tolerance levels 
are exceeded. It discusses the various types of program decisions that are 
expected to be made by the program manager based on items in the program 
charter and the program manager’s level of authority and accountability, 
and those that require escalation to the Governance Board. It states how the 
results of the decisions will be presented, recorded, communicated and man­
aged, using the program communications management plan as a framework.
Updates to the program management plan: This section states when updates 
to the program management plan are required, such as when there are changes 
in the overall strategic direction of the organization, in the program’s require­
ments, in organizational processes and procedures, or to the program’s scope, 
schedule, cost, or quality baselines; unplanned circumstances; or risks that 
turn into issues that then require updates to the plan. It describes the docu­
mentation management process to follow to update the plan and how key 
stakeholders will be notified that the plan has been updated. A formal change 
request should be prepared and approved before the plan is updated.
Approvals: This section contains the written approval of the program manage­
ment plan by the program sponsor, program manager, program management 
office director, members of the Governance Board, and other stakeholders.

222  ◾  Implementing Program Management
Section 7C: Program Benefits Delivery: 
Executing the Program
Good fortune is when opportunity meets with planning.
—Thomas Alva Edison
Having said that plans are useless, but also that planning is tremendously impor­
tant, now we talk about them coming together. But then we remember that as liv­
ing documents, our plans and processes are designed to systematically evolve into 
desired reality.
It is useful to consider the program benefits delivery phase, albeit just one 
phase, in two pieces—the executing part and the monitoring and controlling part. 
The bulk of program work is in the execution, the subject of this chapter. In the 
Standard for Program Management—Third Edition (2013), this phase consists of 
three ­sub-­phases:
◾
◾Component planning and authorization (discussed in this book in Chapter 6 
on Governance)
◾
◾Component oversight and integration (discussed in Chapter  6 and in 
Section 7D on Monitoring and Controlling the Program)
◾
◾Component transition and closure (discussed in Chapter 6 and in Section 7E 
on Closing the Program)
In PMI’s Examination Content Outline (PMI, 2011), a ­high-­level view of the 
tasks involved in Executing the Program follows:
◾
◾Charter and initiate projects
◾
◾Establish consistency with uniform standards, resources, tools, and processes 
for informed decisions
◾
◾Establish a communications feedback mechanism to capture lessons learned 
during the program
◾
◾Lead human resources to improve team engagement and achieve commit­
ment to the program’s goals
◾
◾Review the performance of project managers in executing their projects
◾
◾Execute the appropriate program management plans
◾
◾Consolidate project and program data to monitor and control performance 
and communicate to stakeholders
◾
◾Evaluate the program’s status
◾
◾Approve closure of projects once deliverables are complete

Team Charter
A successful and motivated team is essential to success. A team can benefit greatly 
from a team charter, although it is not included in the Standard for Program 
Management—Third Edition (2013). This is true as it provides an ­agreed-­upon 
model and standards for ­intra-­team interactions not covered by other plans.
Team Charter Instructions
The team charter formalizes the program team members’ roles and responsibilities. 
It provides guidelines for the team’s operations. It describes the processes that the 
team will use to complete the program. It states the expectations to be met by 
the team members, such as the specific responsibilities regarding the program sched­
ule and the realization of program benefits. It includes procedures to resolve conflicts 
and describes how the team will plan the work, participate in making decisions, and 
communicate throughout the program. The team charter includes the following:
Purpose: A brief introductory statement defining the purpose of the team char­
ter, such as:
The team charter states the team members’ roles and responsibilities 
and provides guidelines for the team’s operation throughout the life 
of the program. It describes actions and decisions the team can take 
on its own and escalation processes to follow as required.
	
	
The team charter formalizes the program team members’ roles and 
responsibilities. It provides guidelines for the team’s operations. It describes 
the processes that the team will use to complete the program. It states the 
expectations to be met by the team members, such as the specific expecta­
tions regarding the program schedule and benefits realization. It includes 
procedures to resolve conflicts and describes how the team will plan the 
work, participate in making decisions, and communicate throughout 
the program.
Program commitment statement: This section describes the team’s commit­
ment to the program in terms of the team’s desire to achieve the program’s 
objectives and to be able to deliver the expected benefits of the program.
Program manager’s role: The charter lists the program manager’s name and 
describes how the team will interact with the program manager during the 
program. It contains specific roles and responsibilities of the various team 
members in terms of interaction with the program manager, recognizing that 
some team members will have more interaction than others.

224  ◾  Implementing Program Management
Program sponsor’s role: The charter lists the program sponsor’s name and 
describes how the team will interact with the sponsor during the program.
Client’s role: This section names the client and states how the program manage­
ment team will interact with the client during the program.
Other stakeholders involved in the program: As described in the stakeholder 
engagement plan, a variety of stakeholders will be involved in the program at 
different times during the program’s life cycle. This section describes the level 
of interaction of the program team members with the stakeholders during the 
program. A responsibility assignment matrix may be attached to this section.
Team performance objectives: This section describes specific performance 
objectives of the program team members during the program’s life cycle. It 
links the performance objectives to the program’s objectives.
Success measures: While there are overall success measures in terms of on time, 
within budget, and within specification delivery of the program’s product, 
service, and result as well as delivery of the program’s benefits, this section 
describes specific success measures in terms of overall team performance.
Scope/­boundaries of the team’s work: This section builds on the scope man­
agement plan and the scope statement to describe any boundaries that may 
affect the work of the program team. It lists specific constraints and assump­
tions to be considered.
Deliverables: This section uses the program work breakdown structure and lists 
the various program packages. A responsibility assignment matrix may be 
attached to this section to show the roles and responsibilities of the program 
team members for the various deliverables.
Conflict management process: Recognizing that programs inevitably will 
have conflicts, this section describes a process to resolve conflicts that may 
exist among the team members. It notes how the team can resolve conflicts 
without the need to involve the program manager and states the process to 
follow if involvement from the program manager is required. It also describes 
how team members will learn of the conflict resolution. For example, if the 
conflict only involves a few team members, this section states whether the 
entire team should be included in the resolution method that is used.
­Decision-­making process: This section describes the process the team will fol­
low to make program decisions. It states the types of decisions the team can 
make on its own without the need to involve the program manager and how 
these decisions will be communicated throughout the program and to rel­
evant stakeholders according to the communications management plan. It 
also states when the program manager needs to be consulted before a decision 
is made and the circumstances when the team needs to escalate a decision to 
the program manager.
Administrative activities: Each program has a variety of administrative 
activities that must be performed for overall program success. This section 
states the roles and responsibilities of the team members in terms of these 

Program Life Cycle Management  ◾  225
administrative activities. For example, it describes responsibilities in areas 
such as preparing agendas for various meetings, taking minutes, distribut­
ing action items, maintaining various logs and registers, updating plans and 
other documents, updating the knowledge management repository, and per­
forming closeout tasks. A responsibility assignment matrix for these admin­
istrative activities may be attached to this section.
Issue escalation process: Issues are common in programs. In addition to use of 
the issue register to identify, track, monitor, and resolve issues, this section of 
the charter states the process the team will use to resolve issues on its own. It 
also states when issues should be raised to the program manager for consulta­
tion or for actual resolution.
Updates to the charter: This section states how often the charter will be reviewed 
to determine whether updates to it are required and who will be responsible 
for these updates. For example, if the conflict resolution process is not being 
followed or is not effective, the charter will require updates. As new mem­
bers join the team, they may have ideas for changes to the charter, and as 
members leave the team, they should comment as to whether or not they feel 
changes to the charter are warranted.
Approvals: This section lists the approval of the team charter by the program 
sponsor, program manager, and each team member. When new team mem­
bers join the team, they should sign the charter to indicate their commitment 
to it.

Lessons Learned Review Agenda
Agendas assure orderly and complete coverage of essential matters. We have 
included a suggested agenda for your lessons learned reviews, assisting in the popu­
lation of the lessons learned database, and used in throughout the program. A final 
lessons learned session is mentioned in section 7.1.3.1 in the Standard for Program 
Management—Third Edition (2013).
Lessons Learned Review Agenda Instructions
Lessons learned are collected throughout the program for use on future program 
activities and in other programs and projects under way in the organization. 
They are documented in the lessons learned data base and should be accessible to 
members of the program management team and others given appropriate access 
rights. Ideally, they should be part of a knowledge management system in the orga­
nization. These reviews should be conducted periodically as programs tend to be 
long, and many team members and other key stakeholders will leave and join the 
program at different phases of the program’s life cycle.
Typical participants in a lessons learned review include the program manager, 
members of the program management team, a knowledge management specialist in 
the organization, the director of the program management office, and the portfolio 

230  ◾  Implementing Program Management
manager. The program manager should review the stakeholder register, stakeholder, 
and the stakeholder engagement plan and decide whether or not to invite other 
stakeholders to the meeting.
Prior to the meeting, participants should receive copies of the lessons learned 
register.
An agenda for these meetings is as follows:
PARTICIPANTS (NAMES/ORGANIZATION)

Program overview: The program manager presents a brief ­high-­level overview of 
the program as to why the program was undertaken and where it stands in the 
program management life cycle. After the first meeting, he or she should provide 
a short summary of the last meeting held and should ensure each participant has 
the latest updates to the lessons learned data base.
Discussion of the types of lessons learned: The program manager should lead a 
discussion concerning the types of lessons learned during the meeting using the 
classification system defined in the knowledge management plan. The purpose is 
to see whether the classification system is helpful or whether categories should be 
added or deleted.
Use of lessons learned: The program manager next leads a discussion as to the useful­
ness of lessons learned in terms of exploiting possible opportunities. The discussion 
also concentrates on responses to any negative items so preventive action can be 
taken so they do not occur in the future.
Risk management processes: The program manager also asks the group about the 
usefulness of these reviews in terms of the various risk management processes 
where lesson learned reviews often are used.
Suggestions and recommendations: The program manager asks the group for any 
suggestions or recommendations concerning the lessons learned process so it is 
more useful to the program and other initiatives in the organization. These sug­
gestions are documented in the program’s decision log.
Decisions: This section documents the decisions made during this meeting.

Lessons Learned Data Base
The Standard for Program Management—Third Edition (2013) discusses the lessons 
learned data base in several sections: 8.1.2.4, Lessons Learned Data Base; 8.3.1.6, 
Program Roadmap and Charter Development; 8.3.7.2, Knowledge Transition; 
8.4.4, Program Procurement Closure; and 8.7.1, Program Risk Management 
Planning. The lessons learned records are referred to as a data base. Here is a sug­
gested format, no matter the storage medium.
Lessons Learned Data Base Instructions
Purpose: Lessons learned are collected throughout the program. This data base 
is used to document lessons learned in the program and may be used to sup­
port a best practices library or a knowledge repository.
	
	
Lessons learned include both weaknesses to correct and be aware of for 
future programs and projects, and opportunities to be pursued in this pro­
gram and in other programs and projects in the organization. The program 
management team should review them regularly, and the program manager 
should discuss lessons learned with the Governance Board at program review 
meetings for applicability to other programs and projects under way in the 
organization. At the end of the program, the lessons learned data base should 
be part of the program’s archives. It should also become part of the organiza­
tion’s knowledge management repository, as these lessons learned are part of 
the organization’s assets and are a compilation of knowledge gained for use 
on future programs and projects.
	
	
The lessons learned data base is designed as a table, and a description of its 
contents follows.
	
1.	 Lesson learned number: Assign an identification number to the les­
son learned.
	
2.	 PWBS number: Link the lesson learned to the corresponding program 
package in the program work breakdown structure.
	
3.	 Description: Provide a description of the lesson learned. Set up a clas­
sification system such as:

Decision Log
Significant decisions should be recorded. Decisions and the “whys” of those deci­
sions are sometimes forgotten, often leading to disastrous decision reversals, neglect 
of important reversals, or ­do-­loop iterations of the same “new” decision. In some 
cases, your customer may force you to implement a poor decision, and this log is 
your chance to document that fact and your reservations.
While a governance decision register is noted in the Standard for Program 
Management—Third Edition, other decisions also will be made during the pro­
gram by people other than the members of the Governance Board; this log then is 
used for those decisions. Please refer to Chapter 6 for a template for the governance 
decision register.
Decision Log Instructions
Purpose: The decision log is used throughout the program by the program 
manager to document the major program decisions. In some organizations, 
it may be called a memorandum for record. The program manager should 
decide the level of detail to include in this log. The log is especially useful on 
large programs in which information about a particular decision made early 
in the program requires later review or where decisions are forced upon the 
program managers, for example, by the customer. The log also is helpful if 
someone else is assigned later as the program manager. The log should be part 
of the program’s final records, as it can serve as an excellent source of lessons 
learned for future programs.
	
	
This decision log is designed as a table, and a description of its contents follows.
	
1.	 Decision number: Provide a number for the decision for tracking purposes.
	
2.	 PWBS number: Link the decision to a PWBS program package.
	
3.	 Decision description: Describe the actual decision and what is to be 
done. Provide sufficient detail for future use.
	
4.	 Background information: Provide background information as to why 
the decision was needed. Examples include an escalated risk by a com­
ponent manager to the program manager, an issue to be resolved, a 
customer request for additional work to be done, lack of realization of 

234  ◾  Implementing Program Management
benefits as described in the benefits realization plan, a capacity problem, 
or a missed deliverable.
	
5.	 Decision maker: List the decision maker and his or her contact information.
	
6.	 Implementation date: State the date the decision is to be implemented.
	
7.	 Assigned to: State the person who is responsible for implementing the 
decision and his or her contact information.
	
8.	 Actual implementation date: State the actual date the decision was 
implemented. Provide information if there is a variance between the 
actual date and the planned date.
	
9.	 Notes: Use this field for any additional notes about the decision.
Program Issues Register
Issues of various types are common on programs and are discussed throughout the 
Standard for Program Management—Third Edition (2013). An issue log is men­
tioned in Section 5.3, Stakeholder Engagement, and an escalation process for issues 
to be handled by the Governance Board is described in Chapter 6 of this book. 
This register, though, provides a format for recording and reporting on the variety 
of program issues that may occur throughout the program’s life cycle. Further, in 
the Standard for Program Management—Third Edition (2013), Appendix X.4.2, 
Successful Program Managers, notes the importance of the program manager’s 
ability to manage issues throughout the program.
Program Issues Register Instructions
Purpose: The program issues register is used to track issues on programs, includ­
ing those to be resolved by members of the Governance Board. Issues involve 
a variety of areas—legislation, customer requests, benefit realization, sched­
ule, finances, scope, stakeholder concerns, and unresolved risks to list a few.
	
	
The program issues register, also known as an issue log, identifies each 
issue and then shows how it was resolved, and the people who were involved 
in the process. Issues may be identified by any program stakeholder. Issues at 
the program level may be ones that are escalated to the program ­manager for 
resolution by project managers. At the program level, the issues register shows 
whether an issue identified by a project manager affects other projects or 
­non-­project work in the program. Regardless of the person who identified the 
issue, the issues register also shows whether the issue impacts other programs, 
projects, or work under way in the organization. Note that the issues register 
does not replace the need for a risk register.
	
	
Certain issues can be handled by the program manager; others require 
involvement by other stakeholders or may need resolution by the Governance 
Board. Often, the decisions regarding program issues lead to the need to 
revise other planning documents or to take corrective actions. If this is the 

Program Life Cycle Management  ◾  235
case, a change request should be used. Issue reviews should be conducted on a 
periodic basis, and the issues register is a key document when these reviews are 
held to show the status of identified issues and their resolution. The program 
issues register is designed as a table, and a description of its contents follows.
	
1.	 Issue identification number: Assign an identification number to the issue.
	
2.	 PWBS number: Link the issue to the corresponding program package in 
the program work breakdown structure.
	
3.	 Issue description: Describe the issue and why it is significant to the program.
	
4.	 Identified by: List the person who identified the issue and provide con­
tact information.
	
5.	 Date: State the date the issue was identified and added to the register.
	
6.	 Issue type: Describe the type of issue. Examples include:
	
a.	 Internal: Resources, schedule, scope, cost, quality, contracts
	
b.	 External: Environmental, political, ethical
	
7.	 Root cause: Describe the root cause of the issue in order to determine 
needed preventive action for the future and corrective action for this issue.
	
8.	 Issue impact: State the impact of the issue to the program. Examples include:
	
a.	 Impacts other projects in the program
	
b.	 Impacts other projects or programs under way in the organization
	
c.	 Impacts the organization’s strategic plan
	
d.	 Impacts areas outside of the organization
	
9.	 Issue owner: Identify a member of the program management team to 
be responsible for the issue and to track it until it is resolved and closed. 
Provide contact information for the owner.
	
10.	 Proposed resolution: State the proposed resolution of the issue, such 
as the corrective action that is required. Recognize that the issue owner 
may need to work with the person who identified the issue and other 
stakeholders to determine an appropriate way to resolve the issue so it has 
minimal impacts to the program and other areas.
	
11.	 Decision: State whether the proposed resolution was approved, deferred, 
or rejected.
	
12.	 Resolved by: State who resolved the issue. Examples include:
	
a.	 Issue owner
	
b.	 Program manager
	
c.	 Governance Board
	
	
Note whether the issue was resolved as proposed or whether a differ­
ent approach was approved; if the latter, state the approach to resolve the 
issue. Recognize that a change request will need to be used to implement 
the resolution.
	
13.	 Date: State the date the issue was resolved.
	
14.	 Subsequent impacts: State any subsequent impacts as a result of resolving 
the issue. Examples include the need to modify the scope of the program, 

236  ◾  Implementing Program Management
change processes and procedures used by the program, add resources, mod­
ify plans, modify program benefits, or change stakeholder expectations.
	
15.	 Date closed: State the date the resolution to the issue was implemented 
to close the issue.
	
16.	 Notes: Use this field for any additional notes about the issue.
Component Charter
A component charter is recommended since programs contain more than just 
projects.
Component Charter Instructions
Purpose: A brief introductory statement defining the purpose of the charter, 
such as:
The component charter states the purpose of the component and 
shows how the component fits into the overall program. It also states 
the component manager’s authority and responsibility and formally 
authorizes the component.
	
	
Components may be projects, ­non-­project work, or a set of ­sub-­programs, 
projects and ­sub-­projects. Each component requires a charter before it begins 
work. It is prepared once the component is officially initiated. This charter 
then guides the work of the component and supports the overall program 
charter. Although it is prepared when the component is approved, it may 
need updates as work progresses during the life cycle, when other compo­
nents are added to the program or are completed or terminated.
	
	
If the component was under way before the program began and then 
became part of the program, its existing charter should be reviewed to see 
whether changes are required to support the program’s vision, objectives, and 
benefits. During the program, status reports on the progress of each compo­
nent are prepared.
Component objectives: Each component will have certain objectives. This section 
describes how the component’s objectives support the overall program objectives.
Component expected benefits: Components provide benefits, and as they are 
managed in a program structure, the incremental benefits from all of the 
components typically are greater than if the component was managed indi­
vidually as a project or as ­non-­project work. This section describes the benefits 
to be realized by the component and how the component’s benefits fit within 
the program’s benefits realization plan.
Component deliverables: This section lists specific deliverables in terms of prod­
ucts, services, and results to be provided by the component. The component 

Program Life Cycle Management  ◾  237
requirements documents are used to develop the PWBS. Scope statements 
for each component are considered as procurements are planned along with 
cost estimates. Component milestones are part of the program’s schedule. 
Any risks associated with completing these deliverables should be identified 
for inclusion in the program’s risk identification process, with component risk 
responses considered in the program’s risk responses that may be used.
Component stakeholders: Since stakeholder engagement is essential for effec­
tive program management, this section lists the key stakeholders who may be 
involved in, have an interest in, or have an influence concerning the specific 
component. Component stakeholder engagement guidelines are an input to 
the manage component interfaces process, and they are developed along with 
the program’s stakeholder engagement plan.
Component constraints: Constraints are factors that limit the options of the 
project team. This section lists constraints that may affect the component.
Related program assumptions: Assumptions are factors that the project team 
considers to be true, real, or certain in planning the program. This section 
lists the assumptions that may affect the component.
Component manager’s authority: The charter should name the component 
manager and describe his or her authority and responsibilities, especially in 
terms of being able to apply resources to the component.
Approvals: This section lists the approvals of the component charter by the 
component manager, program manager, program sponsor, members of the 
Governance Board, and other stakeholders as required.

Quality Assurance
Quality planning, assurance, and control are continual on programs as explained 
in the Standard for Program Management—Third Edition (2013). At the program 
level, the emphasis on quality assurance is on ­cross-­program, ­inter-­project relation­
ships. The program manager and his or her team, often working in conjunction 
with the Quality Department, focuses on a project’s quality specifications that may 
impact another project or the entire program. At the program level, quality assur­
ance emphasizes analysis of the quality control results, see Section 7D, of the vari­
ous projects and ­non-­project work to foster overall program quality.
Quality Assurance Audits
Quality assurance audits are recommended in section 8.5.2 in the Standard for 
Program Management—Third Edition (2013). While the Governance chapter in 
this book (Chapter 6) discusses the Quality Management Plan, an Audit Plan, 
and a format for an Audit Report for overall program audits (6.6.4), a format for a 
quality assurance audit is presented in this chapter. These quality assurance audits 
should be included in the Audit Plan, and if they are known in advance, they should 
be in the program’s master schedule. The program manager should convey to his or 
her team the necessity for these audits and promote their use in a positive way. The 
recommendations from the quality assurance audit may lead to change requests to 
improve overall program quality management.
Quality Assurance Audit Report Instructions
The Quality Assurance Audit Report includes the following:
Purpose: A brief introductory statement defining the purpose of the Quality 
Assurance Audit Report such as:
The Quality Assurance Audit Report presents an objective assessment 
of the overall program quality to ensure the program is in compli­
ance with quality policies and standards. Its focus is to ensure qual­
ity is a continuous process using the audits to promote best practices 

Program Life Cycle Management  ◾  241
and proper updates. They also are useful because over the length 
of the program, new laws and regulations may lead to new quality 
standards, which the program must meet. The report’s findings and 
recommendations serve to enhance program effectiveness and foster 
process improvement taking into account that every program com­
ponent contributes to overall program quality, and overall program 
quality standards must be monitored and controlled. The Quality 
Assurance Audit Report is an objective report of findings and pro­
vides recommended preventive or corrective actions to follow.
Background Information
Time Period of the Audit: This section states the time the audit began and 
when the final report was prepared.
Place: This section states where the audit was conducted.
Audit Participants: This section states the names of the people on the audit 
team and provides their contact information for possible questions.
Type of Audit: This section states the type of audit that was conducted: 
internal or external. Note whether the audit was conducted according to 
a schedule in the program’s master schedule based on the Audit Plan or 
whether it was random. It describes if the quality assurance audit focus is 
on the entire program or only on certain components. If it is for certain 
components, the reason these components were selected is stated.
Reason for the Audit: This section describes why the audit was conducted 
such as to concentrate on whether a new regulation or standard has been 
implemented, to determine the extent to which the quality management 
plan is being followed, or to evaluate the usefulness of the quality control 
techniques to promote adequate benefit realization. The audit also may 
evaluate the extent that quality management is an ongoing process on the 
program and the resources allocated to it.
Methodology: This section describes how the audit was conducted. For exam­
ple, it notes whether documents were reviewed, interviews were held, surveys 
were used, focus groups were used, and/­or other methods.
Findings: This section presents the findings from the audit. The findings should 
be presented in an objective way as they are the basis for the recommendations 
from the audit. They are the synthesis of all of the data that were reviewed. 
Findings should be carefully worded to reflect the audit team’s observation, 
and they should be phrased as constructively presented problem statements. 
Appropriate background information that is needed to understand the find­
ings should be included. Causes are observations that support the findings, 
and their identification is helpful in making constructive recommendations. 
Consequences list the problem results of a finding. Findings should represent 

242  ◾  Implementing Program Management
issues for the entire program or for the components being audited and should 
have the broadest possible application.
	
	
Here is an example:
Finding (problem statement): Each status report that is prepared 
omits mention of quality management activities under way 
on the program.
Probable cause: Program participants lack knowledge of their spe­
cific roles and responsibilities for quality management.
Business consequence: Deliverables from program components 
may not meet specific standards set by local authorities and 
cannot be accepted by the customer.
Recommendation: Prepare a Quality Management Plan that 
describes the importance of quality on the program, sets forth 
a quality policy, states quality specifications that are to be 
met, describes quality assurance and control requirements, 
and states the responsibilities of the program team in quality 
management. Provide an overview of the Quality Management 
Plan to each team member via a webinar and make it available 
in the knowledge repository. Review the plan on a periodic 
basis to ascertain its usefulness and determine whether changes 
are warranted. Ask the Quality Department to review the Plan 
to determine if it conforms to the organization’s quality policy.
	
	
In preparing findings, keep the specific quality assurance audit goals and 
appraisal scope in mind. Avoid the following:
Moot issues
Findings based on hearsay alone
Broad generalizations
Recommendations: This section states the recommendations based on the audit 
findings. Use categories if possible to group the recommendations and pres­
ent them in priority order. If the audit is for compliance purposes, note if 
some of the recommendations are mandatory.
Appendices: Include appendices such as the following:
Persons Interviewed: List the people who were interviewed during the audit 
and the date of each interview
Documents Reviewed: List the documents that were reviewed during the audit
Approvals: This section contains the written approval of the Audit Report by 
the lead Auditor.

Section 7D: Program Benefits Delivery: 
Monitoring and Controlling the Program
Drive thy business, let not that drive thee.
—Benjamin Franklin
We now turn to another important part of this process—the business of monitor­
ing and controlling. As stated in the Standard for Program Management—Third 
Edition (2013), it is a responsibility of program managers to monitor the progress of 
the program and its components to ensure the goals, benefits, budget, and schedule 
are met (p. 7). Monitoring and controlling the program are discussed throughout 
the Standard in benefits management, stakeholder engagement, and governance as 
well as in sections 7.1.2.2, Component Oversight and Integration; 8.1.3, Program 
Performance Reporting; 8.2.6, Program Financial Monitoring and Control; 8.3.5, 
Program Performance Monitoring and Control; 8.4.3, Program Procurement 
Administration; 8.5.3, Program Quality Control; 8.6.3, Resource Interdependency 
Management; 8.7.5, Program Risk Monitoring and Control; 8.8.2, Program 
Schedule Control; and 8.9.2, Program Scope Control.
A ­high-­level view of the tasks in Controlling the Program from PMI’s 
Examination Content Outline (PMI, 2011) is as follows:
◾
◾Analyzing variances and trends to identify corrective actions or opportunities
◾
◾Updating program plans to incorporate corrective actions
◾
◾Managing program level issues (covered in Section 7C)
◾
◾Managing changes according to the change management plan (covered in 
Section 7C)
◾
◾Conducting impact assessments for changes and to recommend decisions
◾
◾Managing risk by following the risk management plan
Strongly motivated to run our program rather than having it run us, we can put the 
following items to work.
Impact Analysis
This analysis tool is helpful in the overall process of monitoring and controlling 
the program as it facilitates the complete analysis and documentation of proposed 
changes. Impact analysis is noted in the Standard for Program Management—Third 
Edition (2013) in terms of evaluating the urgency and probability of stakeholder 
issues. Appearing quite useful, however, in other circumstances, we include it here.
Impact Analysis Instructions
The impact analysis includes the following:

246  ◾  Implementing Program Management
Purpose: A brief introductory statement defining the purpose of the impact 
analysis, such as:
The impact analysis describes the factors involved in a program change 
and is used to explain the decision regarding the change request.
	
	
The impact analysis provides information regarding the change decision, 
and it considers the program benefits associated with each change. It also is 
important to recognize that changes may be accepted, deferred, modified, or 
rejected. The impact analysis, therefore, supports the program’s change man­
agement plan and change log. Decisions are communicated to stakeholders 
following the program communications management plan.
	
	
The impact analysis is used in other aspects of the program and by various 
program components.
Type of change: This section lists the type of change in order that its decision 
then can be communicated to the stakeholders who are interested. In com­
pleting this part of the template, the program management team should refer 
to the types of changes listed in the change management plan.
Factors involved in the change: This section lists the factors involved in the 
change. For example, a change initially may be viewed as one that affects only 
one component in the program. When the change request form is prepared 
and it is analyzed, however, this change may be one that affects multiple 
components, deliverables, and program benefits. It also may affect other pro­
grams or projects under way in the organization. Additionally, it may affect 
some of the key processes and procedures used in program management in 
the organization.
Effect on common objectives: This section lists the effect on common objec­
tives at the program level because of the impact analysis. It considers both 
managerial and technical objectives. This section further considers the inter­
dependencies between program components as well as the impact on the 
overall strategic objectives.
Change decision: Based on the information provided, changes may be 
approved, deferred until a later date, modified, or rejected. The person or 
persons responsible for making the decision concerning the change also may 
request additional information. This section states the change decision.
Approving authority: This section lists the person or persons who made the 
decision regarding the change. The program manager may make this decision 
on his or her own, it may be referred to the Governance Board, or it may be 
referred to a configuration management board or change control board.
Communication of the change decision: Based on the program communica­
tions management plan and the stakeholder engagement plan, certain stake­
holders will have an interest in the impact analysis. This section describes 
those stakeholders who should be notified based on the topic of the change.

Program Life Cycle Management  ◾  247
Change requests: As part of the impact analysis, change requests will need 
to be issued. Many of these changes, for example, will require updating the 
program management plan and perhaps the change management plan. They 
may require an update to the program work breakdown structure, schedule, 
financial plan, and others.
Management: This section contains the written approval of the impact analy­
sis by the program manager, program sponsor, members of the Governance 
Board, and any other key stakeholders as appropriate.

Program Performance Report
The Standard for Program Management—Third Edition (2013) talks about program 
performance reporting in section 8.1.3, noting the necessity of consolidating data 
across the program and making it available as appropriate to stakeholders to pro­
vide assurance to them that resources are being used effectively to deliver program 
benefits. The sponsor or the contract, if the program is being done under contract, 
may require specific formats for these reports. Customers also may request periodic 
feedback. Section 8.3.5, in its discussion of program performance monitoring and 
control, notes the importance of program performance reports and forecasts to 
assess trends and determine whether preventive or corrective actions are required. It 
also uses the status report to describe the program’s progress of its components and 
toward benefit realization and identifies resource use concerning benefit realization 
and meeting the program’s goals. Often, these reports contain earned value data, 
work that is complete according to milestones and dates, work yet to complete, and 
any risks, issues, and changes that are being considered. Since performance and 
status reports are used interchangeably, we use the term performance report.
Program Performance Report Instructions
Purpose: The program performance report provides a ­high-­level status of program 
accomplishments and is distributed to various stakeholders in accordance with 
the program communications management plan. Stakeholders use this report 
for program monitoring and control and for general information as appropri­
ate, given the stakeholder’s level of interest and involvement in the program.

Risk Audit Report
The objectives and timing of risk audits can be specified in the Audit Plan. This is 
a suggested format for covering all the relevant points in a risk audit report. Risk 
audits are a recommended best practice in addition to overall program audits.
Risk Audit Report Instructions
The risk audit report includes the following:
Purpose: A brief introductory statement defining the purpose of the risk audit 
report, such as:
The risk audit report presents an objective assessment of the program’s 
risk responses according to the overall risk management process 
used on the program according to the risk management plan. The 
report’s findings and recommendations serve to enhance risk man­
agement effectiveness and ensure that the program is following the 
risk management plan.
	
	
Although program audits are conducted on a regular and ad hoc basis through­
out the life cycle, risk audits also are recommended to ensure that risk processes 
and procedures are effective ones and to see if changes are needed so that risks do 
not turn into problems that impact overall benefits delivery. Risk audits comple­
ment the program audits and also any risk reviews that are held. They should 
be viewed in a positive manner rather than as necessary for compliance or for 
pinpointing specific problems and associating them to specific individuals.
	
	
These audits are planned and noted in the program’s master schedule, 
although the program manager may feel a need to conduct them on an ad hoc 
basis. They focus on risks at the program level, as project managers may con­
duct them at the component level. A recommended best practice is for the 
audit team to review the risk management plan, the risk register, and any 
minutes from risk reviews prior to the audit. The risk audit report is an objec­
tive report of findings and provides recommended preventive or corrective 
actions to follow. It also is used to ensure that program risk management and 
risk response processes are being followed.
	
	
The following are recommended contents for the risk audit report.
Background information:
Time period of the audit: This section states the time the audit began and 
when the final report was prepared.
Place: This section states where the audit was conducted.
Audit participants: This section states the names of the people on the audit 
team and provides their contact information for possible questions.

Program Life Cycle Management  ◾  255
Type of audit: This section states the type of audit that was conducted—
internal or external. Note whether the audit was conducted according 
to the program’s master schedule, as part of a program quality review, or 
whether it was random.
Reason for the audit: This section describes why the audit was conducted, 
such as to concentrate on a risk that occurred that was not part of the 
risk response plan and affected numerous program components; to evalu­
ate the number of workarounds that were needed to address root causes; 
to determine whether the risk management planning process is effec­
tive or requires change; to determine whether new risk categories may 
be needed, especially as new components become part of the program 
and other components end; to assess whether the program stakeholders’ 
tolerance for risks has changed; to determine whether the risk budget 
is adequate; to see whether the risk monitoring and tracking process is 
effective; and to determine whether stakeholders have requested any addi­
tional information other than that regularly reported on risks.
Program areas affected: This section describes the various areas of the pro­
gram that were involved in the audit, e.g., the entire program or only 
certain components of it.
Methodology: This section describes how the audit was conducted. For exam­
ple, it notes whether documents were reviewed, interviews were held, surveys 
were used, focus groups were used, or other methods were used.
Findings: This section presents the findings from the audit. The findings should 
be presented in an objective way, as they are the basis for the recommendations 
from the audit. They are the synthesis of all of the data that were reviewed. 
Findings should be carefully worded to reflect the audit team’s observation, 
and they should be phrased as problem statements. Appropriate background 
information that is needed to understand the findings should be included. 
Causes are observations that support the findings, and their identification 
is helpful in making constructive recommendations. Consequences list the 
problem results of a finding. Findings should represent issues for the entire 
program, or components, according to the scope of the audit, and should 
have the broadest possible application.
	
	
Here is an example:
Finding (problem statement): Each risk review involves different partici­
pants, and many participants are not empowered to make decisions 
at the review.
Probable cause: Designated risk review attendees have not delegated the 
authority to others to make decisions when they cannot attend the 
review.
Business consequence: The risk reviews are not considered useful meetings, 
as decisions are not made as a result of the review.

256  ◾  Implementing Program Management
Recommendation: Prepare and follow a risk review agenda. Have the 
Governance Board appoint members to attend each review that is 
held, and if the designated attendee is unable to attend a review, 
ensure that his or her replacement is empowered to make decisions 
at the meeting.
	
	
In preparing findings, keep the specific risk audit goals and appraisal scope 
in mind. Avoid the following:
Moot issues
Findings based on hearsay alone
Broad generalizations
Recommendations: This section states the recommendations based on the 
audit findings. Use categories if possible to group the recommendations and 
present them in priority order. If the audit is for compliance purposes, note 
whether some of the recommendations are mandatory.
Appendices: Include appendices such as the following:
Persons interviewed: List the people who were interviewed during the audit 
and the date of each interview.
Documents reviewed: List the documents that were reviewed during the audit.
Approvals: This section contains the written approval of the risk audit report 
by the lead auditor.

Program Quality Checklist
Although quality matters, such as checklists are specified in component plans, the 
program also must conduct similar activities to evaluate its products, services, and 
results deliverables, management results, and cost and schedule performance. The 
objectives and timing of checklist usage can be specified throughout the duration of 
the program in the program quality management plan. Here we present a suggested 
format for covering the relevant points in such a checklist. This checklist can serve 
to create a quality review meeting agenda or serve as one input to development of 
a customer satisfaction survey. Involving stakeholders such as customers, sponsors, 
and benefits benefactors in the checklist completion are an essential best practice.
Program Quality Checklist Instructions
Purpose: A brief introductory statement defining the purpose of the program 
quality checklist, such as:
This checklist can be used for agenda development for a program 
review meeting or serve as an input to a customer, ­sponsor, or ­end 
user satisfaction survey instrument. The resulting information pro­
vides essential information of quality results.
	
  The specific areas and the listed item types are those described 
in the Standard for Program Management—Third Edition (2013). 
The checklist verification questions should be phrased for Yes/­No 
answers, with elaboration in the comments section. For example, “Was 
deliverable X delivered on time?” Note that multiple questions can 
be included for a single deliverable, such as “Was deliverable X of 
suitable quality?”

Section 7E: Program Closure: Closing the Program
While we often obsess over planning to start and run a program, 
we so often completely ignore its closure, and pay dearly for it in 
ongoing costs and lost lessons learned waiting to be learned again 
and again.­
—Anonymous
Like Primo in the movie Analyze This, if they hit us with “that closure thing,” we 
need to be ready.
In the exhaustion after the heat of battle and with pressures to move on to the 
next frontier, closure too often gets slighted. Hundreds or thousands of dormant 
yet unclosed programs may lie around forever. In a vicious cycle, precious few les­
sons learned may be available to assist in starting up the next new frontier. Worse, 
expenses may continue to accrue because of unclosed contract matters.
The Standard for Program Management—Third Edition (2013) discusses this 
phase in its life cycle consisting of program transition and program closeout in 
section 7.1.3. Also in this Standard, section 8.2.7 discusses Program Financial 
Closure, 8.3.6 discusses Benefits Transition and Benefits Sustainment [in this 
book in Chapter 4]; 8.3.7 discusses Program Closure; and 8.4.4 discusses Program 
Procurement Closure.
A ­high-­level description of the tasks in Closing the Program from PMI’s 
Examination Content Outline (2011) follows:
◾
◾Completing a program performance analysis report
◾
◾Obtaining stakeholder approval for program closure
◾
◾Executing the transition and closeout of all program and component plans
◾
◾Conducting a ­post-­review meeting
◾
◾Reporting lessons learned and best practices
Contract Closure Procedure
Focusing of course on ­program-­level contracts, our format for this procedure gives 
form to the contract closure considerations mentioned in section 8.4.4, Program 
Procurement Closure in the Standard for Program Management—Third Edition 
(2013) in order that each contract is formally closed, payments are made to contrac­
tors, and no issues are outstanding.
Contract Closure Procedure Instructions
Purpose: Programs typically will use a variety of contractors or suppliers. This 
document describes a procedure to follow to close contracts that have been 
awarded. The purpose of this procedure is to close the contract according to 

Program Life Cycle Management  ◾  261
the contract’s terms and conditions and also according to the overall program 
management methodology.
	
	
This procedure should be reviewed periodically and updated as required.
	
1.	 As the contract closure process begins, first review the contracts manage­
ment plan for any items that apply to closing contracts.
	
2.	 Next review the program management plan and the procurement man­
agement plan to see if they reference any other items not covered in the 
contracts management plan.
	
3.	 Review the specific terms and conditions for closing contracts as outlined in 
the contract’s terms and conditions. Note each one to ensure it is completed.
	
4.	 Review all other contract documentation, such as the following:
	
a.	 Supporting schedules
	
b.	 Unapproved contract changes
	
c.	 Technical documentation prepared by the contractor
	
d.	 Performance and status reports
	
e.	 Invoices
	
f.	 Payment records
	
g.	 Warranties
	
h.	 Results of inspections
	
i.	 Results of audits
	
j.	 Results of reviews
	
5.	 Conduct a procurement audit to review the entire procurement process 
for this contractor.
	
6.	 See if there are any outstanding issues or change requests and resolve them.
	
7.	 Review the program’s budget to see if sufficient funds remain that may be 
needed to pay the contractor’s final invoice. If other funds are required, 
prepare a change request to obtain the needed funding.
	
8.	 Conduct a final performance review with the contractor/­supplier for les­
sons learned.
	
9.	 Determine whether there are any ­follow-­up activities because of any vari­
ations in the deliverables that were completed and provide a list of these 
activities to the contractor.
	
10.	 Agree upon a mutual date in which any ­follow-­up activities will be completed.
	
11.	 Document any warranties or guarantees that are to be provided by the 
contractor.
	
12.	 Assess the contract’s terms and conditions to determine whether there 
are any outstanding intellectual property issues that require resolution; if 
there are outstanding issues, agree upon a plan and a date by which they 
will be resolved.
	
13.	 Pay the contractor’s final invoice.
	
14.	 Prepare a written document that is signed by the appropriate people in 
the organization that states the contract is closed, and all deliverables 

262  ◾  Implementing Program Management
have been accepted or rejected. Ensure this document is consistent with 
the contract’s terms and conditions. Provide this document to the con­
tractor. Include any required ­follow-­up activities or warranties.
	
15.	 Inform stakeholders that the contract has been closed.
	
16.	 Review and document lessons learned regarding this contract, the con­
tractor’s performance, and the processes and procedures that are used.
	
17.	 Determine whether any updates are recommended to various processes 
that are used in the organization, such as to the:
	
a.	 Procurement management plan
	
b.	 Contracts management plan
	
c.	 Evaluation criteria
	
d.	 Performance and status report templates
	
e.	 Contract terms and conditions
	
f.	 Contract change control system
	
g.	 Issue resolution process
	
h.	 Claims resolution process
	
i.	 Contract payment system
	
18.	 Prepare and submit a recommendation to the contracts/­procurement 
department to retain this contractor on the qualified supplier list, drop 
this contractor from the list, or add the contractor if it is new to the orga­
nization and is not on the list.
	
19.	 Prepare a complete set of all the relevant documents about this contract, 
including the following:
	
a.	 Contracts management plan
	
b.	 Contract
	
c.	 Status and performance reports
	
d.	 Minutes from performance reviews
	
e.	 Invoices and payment records
	
f.	 Technical documents prepared
	
g.	 Audit results
	
h.	 Inspection results
	
i.	 Lessons learned document
	
j.	 Final closeout document
	
20.	 Index these documents with appropriate metadata tags so they can 
be easily retrieved for use on other projects in this program, by other 
programs and projects under way in the organization, or for future pro­
grams and projects.
Supplier Performance Review
When finalizing a program contract, care must be taken to ensure that everything 
the program needs has been satisfactorily obtained or at least resolved as an issue. 
For future purposes, we also need to understand how well the supplier performed 

Program Life Cycle Management  ◾  263
during this engagement. Here we present a format to help ensure a successful review 
of supplier performance.
Supplier Performance Review Agenda Instructions
As part of the procurement closure process, the member of the program manage­
ment team who is serving as the contract administrator for each supplier should 
conduct a final review of the supplier’s overall performance. These reviews provide 
a number of advantages, both for the performing organization and for the supplier.
The program management team discusses overall performance in terms of 
objectives that were met, benefits that were achieved, and progress according to 
plans. This review may be the last time to formally discuss any deficiencies with 
the supplier. The program management team member then summarizes the results 
of the review and makes recommendations to the organization’s procurement or 
contracts department concerning adding this supplier to the qualified supplier list 
if it was a new supplier or continuing to keep the supplier on the list if the supplier 
has worked for the organization in the past.
The supplier can use the review to discuss any problems that occurred that 
affected overall performance and any opportunities should the supplier be selected 
to work on a similar type of contract in the future. This review does not substitute 
for other reviews that may be held as described in the contracts management plan.
An agenda for these reviews is as follows:
PARTICIPANTS (NAMES/ORGANIZATION)
Date:	
_________________________________________
Time:	
_________________________________________
Place:	
_________________________________________
Contract overview: A member of the program management team, ideally the per­
son who prepared the contracts management plan and who worked with the sup­
plier throughout the contract as the program’s contract administrator, presents a 
brief overview of the contract. He or she describes why it was needed, its deliver­
ables, and impact to the program. He or she also describes why the contract now 
is complete.
Specific performance requirements: The next part of the review discusses the spe­
cific performance requirements to be met by the contract. The program man­
agement team reviews each deliverable and describes whether it was completed 
according to plan. If the planned delivery date was missed, the supplier representa­
tives can explain needed preventive actions. The program management team can 
discuss the impact of a missed delivery date on the overall success of the program, 
especially if a missed delivery date affected other parts of the program adversely. 
Lessons learned can be shared by both parties to improve future performance on 
similar contracts.

264  ◾  Implementing Program Management
Monitoring and control processes used: During this part of the review, the pro­
gram management team discusses the various monitoring and control processes 
used on this contract, such as meetings and status reports. The format for the 
reports and the frequency in which they were submitted can be discussed. The 
supplier representatives discuss whether they found these meetings and reports to 
be useful and present any ideas for change. The program management team can 
discuss whether change requests were required because of the status reports that 
were submitted or the meetings that were held. Both groups can discuss whether 
there was an atmosphere of trust between the two parties and ways in which trust 
could be enhanced in the future.
Change control: Although changes may be needed as a result of the reports and 
reviews, suppliers often submit change requests. During this part of the review, 
the change control system can be discussed to see if there are any recommended 
changes to improve its effectiveness. The supplier representatives can discuss why 
they needed to submit change requests, if this was done during the program. They 
can comment on items such as the length of time it took to submit a request and 
how they were notified whether the request was approved, deferred, or rejected, 
and also whether they needed to submit additional information to the program 
management team to analyze the impact of the change request on the program.
Claims process: If there were a number of contract claims, the claims process should 
be reviewed to see why many claims were submitted. Both groups can discuss the 
effectiveness of this process to see if any changes would have facilitated the resolu­
tion of claims that were submitted.
Invoicing and payment process: The invoicing and payment processes also can be 
discussed. Both groups can determine whether any changes could have led to a 
smoother process.
Additional comments: The program management team provides any additional 
comments about the supplier performance, and the supplier representatives also 
provide comments as appropriate.

Contract Closeout Report
During your program, you inevitably learn lessons about your program procurement 
processes and about your suppliers. This report structure helps you record those 
­procurement-­specific lessons learned. They will be useful in future procurements, 
and this report can be prepared as noted in section 8.4.4, Program Procurement 
Closure, in the Standard for Program Management—Third Edition (2013).

throughout the life of the contract according to the contractual terms and 
conditions. The program management team also outlines status reporting 
requirements in the contracts management plan. The team and other stake­
holders use these reports for contract monitoring and control, to ensure that 
any issues that are raised are resolved in a timely way, and for general infor­
mation as appropriate. The procurement performance reports are used by the 
program management team to ensure that all issues raised in these reports 
are resolved in a satisfactory way before the contract is closed, and the team 
prepares the closeout report.
	
	
In the Standard for Program Management—Third Edition (2013), a con­
tract closeout report also is an output from program procurement closure to 
show the results of the supplier performance review and to record any issues 
as needed in the program issues register. Additionally, any lessons learned are 
included in this report.

Program Final Report
At the end of any program, a final report should be prepared to document the 
work of the program and to be part of the program’s archives. The need for a final 
report to document critical program information is described in section 8.3.7.1, 
Final Reports, in the Standard for Program Management—Third Edition (2013).
Program Final Report Instructions
The program final report includes the following:
Purpose: A brief introductory statement defining the purpose of the program 
final report, such as:
The program final report contains the key information about the 
program, which will be useful to other programs and projects under 
way in the organization and for future programs and projects.
	
	
In the Project Management Institute’s Standard for Program Management—
Third Edition (2013), the program final report is also used to provide data for 
corporate governance.
	
	
Although it is finalized during the closing process, it should be prepared 
throughout the program so key information is not forgotten. One best prac­
tice to follow is to work on this report at the end of each of the lessons learned 
reviews and governance reviews that are held. Information from the gover­
nance decision register, program decision log, risk register, program issues reg­
ister, and lessons learned register is reviewed as the report is prepared. Audit, 
benefit, status, and performance reports also should be reviewed. Reasons for 
terminating a contract or a component early should be analyzed. Often, pro­
gram managers will hold a knowledge transition meeting with team members 
before the program is officially closed; if this type of information is held, it 
may provide other data to include in the final report.
	
	
Suggested items to include in the report are the following:
Program strategic objectives: The program’s strategic objectives were described 
initially in the business case and program mandate. This section states 
whether or not these objectives were met. If the objectives changed or were 
not met, this section describes the circumstances for future use by other pro­
grams and projects.
Program benefits delivered: Using the benefits realization plan and the bene­
fits reports, prepared throughout the program, this section states whether the 
intended benefits were met. If they were not, or if other benefits were added as 
the program ensued, it describes the specific circumstances involved.

Program Life Cycle Management  ◾  269
Program participants: Since programs often are long, this section lists the 
people who performed key roles in the program, and the times they held the 
various positions: program manager, program sponsor, component managers, 
members of the program management office, as applicable, and members of 
the Governance Board.
Stakeholder management: This section describes the stakeholders who were 
involved in, had an interest in, or influenced the program. It uses the stake­
holder inventory, stakeholder engagement plan, stakeholder register, and 
communications log/­stakeholder log to summarize how stakeholders were 
identified, how involved they were in the program, and their importance to 
the program. It also describes the approaches used by the program manage­
ment team to work with the key stakeholders in the program.
Summary of program metrics: Throughout the program, a variety of metrics 
were collected to see whether preventive or corrective actions were required. 
This section provides a summary of these metrics.
Earned value: Recognizing that the schedule performance index will be 1, 
this section lists the other EV metrics, such as cost performance index, 
budget at completion, estimate to complete, estimate at completion, 
earned schedule, and total cost performance index.
Financial management: This section lists the various financial management 
metrics collected in the program, such as return on investment, share­
holder value added, net present value, payback period, time to break even, 
internal rate of return, and ­benefit-­cost ratio.
Resources: This section provides information on the planned versus actual 
resources used in the program, noting that resources are more than only 
people using the program resource plan as a reference.
Team management: As team members leave the program, an excellent 
approach to follow is to survey them on areas for improvement. Other 
surveys can be used periodically to assess the needed competencies for 
people to the program, the managerial style used, the use of collaborative 
leadership on the team, and overall team maturity. This section describes 
the type of team management metrics that were used and makes recom­
mendations for improvement as appropriate. It also describes whether a 
­team-­based reward and recognition system was used and its effectiveness.
Charters: This section discusses the effectiveness of the program, component, 
and team charters and contains recommendations for their improvement.
Organizational: This section discusses any ­organizational-­type metrics that 
were used in the program, such as the probability of success of the pro­
gram deliverables, the strategic importance of the program and whether it 
changed over the course of the program, and the duration of the program 
as compared to the urgency of the need for its deliverables and benefits.
Program risks: This section describes program risks that were identified and 
the appropriateness of the risk response that was selected. It includes both 

270  ◾  Implementing Program Management
opportunities and threats to the program. This section also includes any risks 
that were not identified but occurred and affected the program. It states the 
contingency plans that were used. It uses the risk man­agement plan, the risk 
register, risk reviews, and audits as references.
Program issues: This section describes the key issues that affected the program, 
using the program issues register as a reference.
Escalated risks and issues: This section lists those risks and issues that the 
program manager escalated to the Governance Board for resolution and 
describes the decisions that were made and approaches that were used.
Baseline changes: This section describes the changes over the life of the pro­
gram to the scope, schedule, cost, benefit, and quality baselines.
Interfaces: This section summarizes the interfaces in terms of interrelationships 
within the program, with other projects and programs under way in the orga­
nization, and organizational, technical, interpersonal, logistical, and political 
interfaces that occurred.
Communications: This section describes the communications methods used in 
the program to keep stakeholders informed. It notes any approaches that were 
added that were not in the program communications management plan. It 
uses the communications log as a reference. It describes the appropriateness 
of the meetings that were held and notes whether changes were needed to the 
agendas for meetings of the Governance Board for phase gate and program 
reviews as well as the agendas for the risk management planning process and 
risk reviews. It lists the people who will receive copies of this final report.
Supplier performance: This section summarizes the performance of the vari­
ous program suppliers and presents recommendations in terms of updating 
or changing the qualified supplier list as appropriate. It uses the contracts 
management plan as a reference.
Program decisions: This section describes the key decisions made during the 
program’s life cycle using the decision log and the governance decision regis­
ter as references.
Terminations: This section summarizes any terminations that occurred during 
the program.
Contract: This section summarizes any contracts that were terminated pre­
maturely, to focus on why they were terminated using the procurement 
program reports as a reference.
Component: This section summarizes any components that were terminated 
prematurely, to focus on why they were terminated using the component 
termination requests as a reference.
Program acceptance: This section lists the formal acceptance of the program’s 
scope to show that each deliverable was completed satisfactorily by the cus­
tomers and the program sponsor.

Program Life Cycle Management  ◾  271
Benefits transitioned: This section describes specific benefits that were tran­
sitioned to the customer, users, or to a functional unit in the organization, 
such as a product support group or customer support group, and describes 
how they will be sustained. It uses the component transition decisions, the 
transition management plan, and the benefits sustainment plan as references.
Lessons learned: This section summarizes the lessons learned in the program, 
focusing on successes, failures, and areas of improvement using the lessons 
learned register as a reference.
Program: This section summarizes technical lessons learned. It uses the pro­
gram requirements document as a reference.
Program management process: This section summarizes the lessons learned 
in terms of the processes, procedures, and guidelines that were used in the 
program. It uses the program roadmap and the Program Management 
Plan as a reference.
Knowledge repository: To best contribute to the organization’s knowledge 
management system and repository, this section contains the metadata tags 
to locate information about this program in an ­easy-­to-­use way as its archives 
become part of the organization’s knowledge repository.
Approvals: This section contains the written approval of the program final 
report by the program sponsor, program manager, program management 
office director, members of the Governance Board, and any other key stake­
holders as appropriate.

Knowledge Transition
Knowledge management is especially important in program management. As part 
of program closure in the Standard for Program Management—Third Edition (2013), 
knowledge transition is discussed in section 8.3.7.2. We suggest a knowledge tran­
sition report be prepared as another way to evaluate overall program performance.
Knowledge Transition Report Instructions
The knowledge transition report includes the following:
Purpose: A brief introductory statement defining the purpose of the knowledge 
transition report, such as:
The knowledge transition report is an assessment of the program’s 
performance and is used so the program manager can share lessons 
learned with the team and others in the organization.
	
	
In the Project Management Institute’s Standard for Program Management—
Third Edition (2013), a knowledge transition report is noted as a meeting the 
program manager holds to share lessons learned with the program team. Any 
additional lessons learned then are included in the program’s final report.
	
	
We suggest a separate report that is prepared early in the program and 
enhanced each time the program manager holds a lessons learned review 

Program Life Cycle Management  ◾  277
session as well as at the end of the program. In preparing it, the program 
manager should review the knowledge management plan, the component 
transition decisions, the lessons learned data base, and the results of lessons 
learned reviews. When this report is complete, it may lead to the need to 
update some of the organization’s existing policies, procedures, and processes 
in program management. The program manager may wish to prepare this 
report in a meeting with the program management team to formally discuss 
lessons learned.
Knowledge management goals and objectives: This section lists the goals and 
objectives for knowledge management based on the knowledge management 
plan and assesses whether or not they were met. Recommendations for changes 
are noted. It notes whether people in the program contributed content that 
was useful to others. The emphasis is to focus on continuous improvement 
and learning for future programs and projects in the organization.
Program management plans: This section discusses the various plans that the 
program management team prepared to evaluate their usefulness. It also 
reviews whether changes were required to these plans and the improvements 
as a result of these changes. It evaluates the format of the plans, and the people 
who were involved in the preparation of each plan for future improvements. 
It assesses the transition plan in terms of knowledge transfer activities to sup­
port ongoing benefits in order that the support organizations have required 
documentation, training, or materials.
Meetings and reviews: This section discusses the effectiveness of the pro­
gram management team meetings that were held and the performance 
reviews that were conducted by the team, by the Governance Board, and 
by auditors. It notes whether the recommendations from the reviews were 
implemented. The program’s decision log and governance decision register 
are reviewed.
Monitoring and controlling processes: This section describes the various 
monitoring and controlling processes the program team used to evaluate 
overall program performance and that of the various program components. It 
reviews the risk register, program issues register, metrics that were collected, 
status reports, and the lessons learned data base.
Team performance: A motivated team is essential to program success. This sec­
tion reviews team performance to determine whether other approaches could 
have enhanced overall team motivation. It evaluates the usefulness of the team 
charter, exit interviews with members of the team when they left the program, 
and rewards and recognition systems in place for program team members.
Contractors and suppliers: Since most programs use a variety of contractors/­
suppliers, this section discusses the performance of the various contractors 
and suppliers with a focus on the effectiveness of the procurement manage­
ment plan, the contracts management plan, the procurement performance 
reports, and the contract closure procedure.

278  ◾  Implementing Program Management
Stakeholder engagement: Effective stakeholder engagement is a key to overall 
program success and benefits realization. This section assesses the stakeholder 
engagement plan that was prepared. It reviews the stakeholder register and 
the communications management plan. It notes changes in the various stake­
holders throughout the life of the program and reviews the communications 
log to see the usefulness of the regular reports that stakeholders received, 
especially if additional reports were required.
Governance reviews: The importance of an effective Governance Board to 
overall program success cannot be overstated. This section describes the 
interaction between the program management team and the members of 
the Governance Board. It evaluates the usefulness of the meetings of the 
Governance Board both at stage gates and for overall program performance 
reviews. It also assesses the governance management plan and reviews the 
governance decision register.
Customer involvement: Customers are active participants in many programs. 
This section discusses customer involvement apart from stakeholder engage­
ment to see how the program management team interacted with the custom­
ers. It also assesses how benefits were transitioned to the customers and how 
customer satisfaction was measured.
Approvals: This section contains the written approval of the knowledge transi­
tion report by the program sponsor, program manager, program management 
office director, members of the Governance Board, and any other key stake­
holders as appropriate.

Based on PMI’s The Standard for Program Management—Third Edition (2013) 
and other best practices, the updated edition of this bestselling reference provides 
a program management methodology consisting of reports, forms, templates, and 
documents. It includes identifiable documents referenced in the latest The Standard 
for Program Management as well as other helpful ones omitted from prior editions.
The book deals with the full program management life cycle—program definition, 
program benefits delivery, and program closure—to support the documentation 
requirements for your programs. The authors have updated the templates and forms 
in this book to complement what is included in the Third Edition and to include what 
they feel are best practices for managing programs. 
All the templates included in the book can be accessed online and can be easily 
customized to meet the unique requirements of your organization.
