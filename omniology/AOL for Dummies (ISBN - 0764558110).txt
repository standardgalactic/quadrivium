About the Author
John Kaufeld got hooked on computers a long time ago. Somewhere along
the way, he discovered that he enjoyed helping people understand how com-
puters worked (a trait that his computer science friends generally considered
a character flaw but that everyone else seemed to appreciate). John finally
graduated with a B.S. degree in management information systems from Ball
State University and became the first PC support technician for what was
then Westinghouse, outside Cincinnati, Ohio. He learned about online ser-
vices in the Dark Ages of Telecommunication (the 1980s) by guessing, failing,
and often doing unmentionable things to his modem.
John spent the last 15 years working with normal people who, for one reason
or another, were stuck using a “friendly” personal computer. Today, he runs
ShipperTools.com (www.shippertools.com), More Than Games (www.
morethangames.com), and the ClixCon game convention (www.clixcon.
com). Amongst all of that, he designs and develops board and card games,
and (to the infinite amusement of his accountant) fights endlessly with
QuickBooks. He writes articles and game reviews for Scrye Magazine and var-
ious other publications in his copious free moments. Depending on how hard
you look, you can also find him playing Mage Knight, HeroClix, and Crimson
Skies (from WizKids, www.wizkidsgames.com) or any of the many German
board games in his collection at game conventions around the country.
John’s other Wiley titles include Access 2003 For Dummies, Access 2002 For
Dummies, and too many other database books to still qualify him as a normal
human. He regularly uses America Online (where he’s known as JKaufeld). He
loves getting e-mail and valiantly attempts to answer every message arriving
in his mailbox. You can also find an ongoing collection of his thoughts in his
AOL Journal (journals.aol.com/jkaufeld/AnUncommon-tary).
John lives with his wife, two children, and (most delightfully) no American
Eskimo dog, among the rolling hills of Indiana.


Dedication
To Jenny, because you held onto the truth and helped set me free. I love you!
To J.B. and the Pooz, for reminding me that play makes work go faster.
To my friends and compatriots at John Wiley & Sons (or whatever they call
themselves these days), for the opportunity of a lifetime.
Thank you, one and all.


Author’s Acknowledgments
I think I finally figured out why book acknowledgments are always kind of
philosophical. It’s because the author has just spent most of the past two
weeks (and particularly the preceding 72 hours) on a constant caffeine high
and is now devoting a large portion of his time to preventing his brain from
floating off into space.
Luckily, that’s not going to happen to me. I put on a hat — and I added a chin
strap this year.
First, I want to thank my project editor, Leah Cameron, for a deft touch and the
gentle, prodding patience to keep me rolling even on days when my stress level
registered on FAA radar. You earned your way into the elite corps of editors I
want to work with again. May it happen soon! I also want to thank my copy
editor, Rebecca Senninger. You utterly blew me away with your near-perfect
work. (There’s still that matter of the sentence structure in Chapter 5, but I’m
willing to let that go.) Thank you so much for your help. You’re amazing.
Extraordinary thanks also go to my technical reviewer, Rhonda Jacobs, who
made sure that vast swaths of the book actually bear some resemblance to
reality. Without Rhonda’s help, goodness only knows where half the stuff in
this book might lead you.
Way out at the other end of the known world, thanks to Steve Hayes (my
beloved acquisitions editor) and Andy Cummings (who runs the Acquisitions
Department ward, plus several other important — and happy — areas of the
Wiley Asylum). Perpetual thanks also go to Diane Steele, who took a chance on
me 10 years ago and completely changed my world ever since. 
At America Online, extra-special “You’re the greatest” thanks to Debbie, who
made the mistake of answering my voice mail one day and accidentally
turned into my unerring guide through the mazes of AOL. The entire AOL
Beta Team, and particularly the intrepid Melissa, who received the bulk of my
e-mails, gets super kudos as well. Similarly heart-felt thanks go to the follow-
ing AOL folks (in alphabetical order) Brad, Cathy, Chris, David, Erin, Jim,
Kathy, Laura, Michael, Natalie, Nicholas (congrats on the baby!), Tom, and
everybody else whose name I missed. You all collectively rank just below Ben
& Jerry’s Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Ice Cream in my world (and that’s
pretty high, believe me).
Finally, a boatload of sincere appreciation to my friends and fellow gamers
Tim and Sara, Jon Adam, and Bob and Michelle. You all remind me a little
more every day of what community really means. I love you guys! Another
round of Chez Geek, Puerto Rico, or Formula De, anyone? ::grins::

more accessible, more convenient, more useful, and more fun for people
from all walks of life. That formula has worked well; AOL is now the world’s
leading interactive online service.
That success has been driven in large part by remaining faithful to our origi-
nal goal: making online services easy and convenient. In designing the service,
we wanted to make it as intuitive as possible, meaning everybody from Fortune
500 executives to elementary school students could visit our many Channels,
use our exciting tools and features, and become part of the unique AOL com-
munity. We wanted to make the software easy to install and use. As a result,
new America Online customers are usually up and running in a matter of min-
utes. Try doing this with your digital camera!
We’ve also worked hard to constantly add new services to ensure that we
continue to offer our members unparalleled value. Our new AOL 9.0
Optimized is designed to help members get the most from being online by
creating a customized online experience every time you sign-on.  
New and exciting features include safety and security protections like built-in
spam filters that get smarter as you use them and a spam folder where sus-
pected spam is automatically routed for review and deletion, enhanced
Parental Controls, and Web pop-up controls. AOL Top SpeedTechnology
can help you get to your favorite Web sites faster — saving you time and
helping you get the content and information you want.
We’ve just added new ways to enjoy the online experience, like new 3D ani-
mated SuperBuddyand new instant messaging personalized expression
features that make it more fun to be online and communicate with friends
and family through voice, video clips, digital photos, and file sharing.
AOL 9.0 Optimized also has new communications options, such as a new
Manage Mail tab for active and advanced mail users and the ability to store
up to 20 megabytes of mail on AOL’s servers for each of the seven screen
names that come with an AOL account, providing up to 140 megabytes of
storage.

To maximize your broadband experience, we offer AOL for Broadband, the
best source for entertainment and information on the Internet — such as
CD-quality radio, and video clips including movie trailers, sports highlights,
and live news reports.  You’ll also find programming and features that are
exclusive only to AOL for Broadband members. You can simply add the AOL
for Broadband service to any high-speed DSL or cable Internet connection. 
AOL offers a wide range of premium services to bring even more power and
flexibility to our members’ online experience. For example, AOL Call Alert
lets members know who is calling while they are online and allows them to
handle calls using several message response options. If you are a music
fanatic, MusicNet on AOL is designed to give members the best way to find,
download, listen to, and burn digital music safely and legally.  
For an even safer online experience, we offer McAfee VirusScan Online, which
scans your PC system for viruses and repairs and/or removes infected files.
For members on the go, AOL by Phone allows them to check their e-mail and
access other popular AOL features conveniently through simple, spoken com-
mands, toll-free from any telephone.
In addition, our AOL family of popular Web brands such as Netscape,
Moviefone, Mapquest, CompuServe, ICQ, and AOL Instant Messenger (AIM),
offers unmatched convenience, choice, and world-class content.
What does all this add up to for you?  Incomparable value.  And so as we con-
tinue to make new improvements to tools, features, and products, AOL will
retain our focus on our most important asset — our members. We rely and
depend on your feedback, with over 8,000 customer service representatives
standing by 24/7/365 to listen to you and learn from your input. 
But as hard as we’ve worked to make the service simple to use, the sheer
volume of information available has made the online world akin to trying to
tour the Library of Congress in one day. That’s where this book, AOL For
Dummies, 2nd Edition, comes in. Although we think America Online is already
“dummy-proof,” John’s book makes AOL just that much easier to enjoy and
navigate.
As you’ll discover, America Online is a vibrant and exciting virtual commu-
nity that bridges the lives of all our members in an engaging, interactive
format. Every day, hundreds of thousands of AOL subscribers go online and
e-mail, instant message, chat, post messages on message boards, enjoy live
music, make travel reservations, and read their favorite magazines and news-
papers. We provide the framework; beyond that, AOL is shaped by the collec-
tive imagination and innovation of our members.

As the Internet evolves, AOL will continue to lead the way, helping consumers
make the most of the online medium by connecting, informing, and entertain-
ing them online as never before.  From the beginning, AOL has believed the
best way to build the online medium has been to give our members what
they want, and that will remain our hallmark as we move into this next excit-
ing chapter of the Internet.

Introduction
W
elcome! You’ve got mail!
Those four little words changed the face of the Internet. Those four little
words echo through houses, dormitories, and apartments millions of times
every day. Those four little words live in the world’s collective psyche.
And those words communicate the essence of America Online. It’s about
neighbors and family — about wanting to learn, wanting to share, and want-
ing to get away for a while. It’s about living in a world-sized community,
where your newest best friend lives in the next time zone to the west. It’s
about exploring things you love, and having lots of fun along the way.
Every neighborhood needs a guide to help the residents find their way
around, meet the folks, and generally settle themselves in for a fun stay.
That’s where AOL For Dummies, 2nd Edition, fits into your life: Read on . . .
and let this book show you around the neighborhood that is AOL.
About This Book
AOL For Dummies, 2nd Edition, acts as your friendly tour guide and road map
to an amazing and intriguing digital world. It offers everything you need to
get started with (and get the most from) the biggest and friendliest online
service in the United States: America Online. Best of all, you don’t need to be
some normalcy-challenged computer technoid to make sense of the stuff in
here. AOL For Dummies, 2nd Edition, delivers all of this information in plain
language — the way we talked back when computers interfaced and people
had conversations. 
Don’t just take my word for it — jump on in and discover what’s here for you.
A world of pleasant surprises awaits!

Conventions Used in This Book
Communication doesn’t happen until two people agree on a number of
things, such as when to talk, how loud to speak, and who cleans up the
broken dishes after the conversation ends. Of course, if they both speak the
same language helps (otherwise the broken-dish quotient goes sky-high).
In the name of better communication, a few things in this book look a little
odd. (Depending on the day, I might be one of them.) The following items all
received special formatting attention to make them stand out from the ave-
rage, run-of-the-mill information. If you run across something with some
strange formatting, look here for the explanation:
 Web addresses look like this. It’s funky and stylish, making a very
retro ’50s I live for my typewriter sort of statement. Examples include 
www.aol.com
www.morethangames.com
www.probabilitytheory.info
 On extremely rare occasions (perhaps once in the whole book), screen
names look like this, too. During an intense attempt to make
sense of chat-room anarchy, the text refers to screen names shown in a
figure. To make the screen names more obvious in the explanation, they
all appear in the wacky monofont. Examples include ImTheFamilyDog
and JKaufeld.
 Keywords leap from the page in bold. Why bold, you ask? Because key-
words live for boldly sweeping you away to the best of AOL’s content —
and because bold was pretty much the only formatting option I had left.
Examples include keywords New, Games, People, and Explore.
 Instructions that involve clicking Menu Items➪Look➪Like➪This. Every
menu requires a few steps of navigation between the beginning and the
end. This book leads you through the process with these funky little
command arrows (➪). Underlined letters in a menu show the shortcut
keys (for the keyboard addicts out there). Examples include Mail➪
Saved on My PC, Community➪Chat, and Keyword➪AOL 9.0 Optimized
Features.
If you find any other really strange or weird-looking text in the book, call the
guys with the black suits and the anti-alien guns. It might be serious. 
What You’re Not to Read
The true beauty of a For Dummies book — apart from the friendly yellow
cover and the cute little Dummies guy — rests in how it presents information.
Unlike many books on the market, you don’t have to read AOL For Dummies,
2
AOL For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

2nd Edition, in chapter-by-chapter order. Sure, you can do it that way (after
all, it’s your book), but the book’s information comes out just as easily
whether you march sequentially through the chapters or bound and romp
from topic to topic. The choice — driven by your quest for knowledge — is
yours.
By the same token, the book works hard to make sense of all the weird com-
puter stuff that happens inside AOL. Almost everywhere you turn, technical
things appear with simple descriptions. Unfortunately, a few things contained
in these pages still came out in their native language: geek. To give you fair
warning, the book marks those areas with the Technical Stuff icon (displayed
for your pleasure next to this paragraph). When you see the Technical Stuff
icon, you can decide whether to slog through the material or simply gloss
over it.
Because of the strange currents and eddies in software development sched-
ules (and the overwhelming number of Windows-based computers in the
world), America Online always releases the Windows version of its newest
software long before the Macintosh version. That’s why this book views
America Online from a distinctly Windows-based perspective. (After all,
writing about software that doesn’t exist yet is tough.) But don’t despair,
Macintosh users! You still benefit from all the online content information 
in Parts III, IV, V, and VI. When the America Online 9.0 software for the
Macintosh finally arrives, the instructions in Parts I and II should help, too.
Foolish Assumptions
To know you is to understand you, and goodness knows, if I can’t understand
you, I can’t help you. With that statement in mind (a challenge in itself),
here’s what I know about you:
 You’re either interested in joining America Online or currently use it
(and already feel the effects).
 You wonder precisely what you can do through the online world — and
with America Online in particular.
 You use a Windows-based or Macintosh computer.
 You have a modem attached to your computer or connect to the Internet
through a cable modem or other high-speed access.
 You care more about dinner appetizers than about modems and compu-
ters combined.
 Terms like AIM, DSL, chat room, and Internet nip at your heels like a pack
of disturbed Chihuahuas.
If these statements sound familiar, this book is for you.

Introduction

How This Book Is Organized
To make finding information a little bit easier, I split the book into six distinct
parts. To whet your appetite, here’s a peek at each of the upcoming sections. 
Part I: Driver’s Ed for the Digital Traveler
This section answers stirring questions like “Just what the heck is America
Online?”, “Why do I care?”, and “Does Bill Gates really want to send me
$5,000?” (Yes, hard to believe as it seems, it really answers that question.
Trust me.) Part I gives you a broad overview of what the whole online world
is about. It explains what you generally need to know about America Online,
explains how to connect your computer to the larger online world, walks you
through some cool ways to plug America Online into your day, and walks
through the features and highlights of the America Online access software. In
short, it’s kinda like digital driver’s education.
Part II: Settling Into Your Online Home
After moving into a new domicile (whether it’s a house, apartment dorm
room, or something else), some time passes before the place starts feeling
like home. Gradually, you unpack your stuff, hang pictures on the wall, and
learn your way around. Slowly and surely, that homey feeling grows on you. 
Joining the online world works a lot like moving into a new place — and Part
II helps you make that new place into your own unique online home. The
chapter starts with a look through the myriad preferences in your AOL soft-
ware. From there, it addresses the important topic of creating screen names
(online personas) for yourself and your kids, and the little tricks to setting
the Parental Controls that keep your kiddos on the safe side of the Net. It
covers a lot more ground after that, including navigating around AOL and the
Internet, working with the Buddy List, and how to use the Companion, AOL’s
nifty little addition to your regular software.
Part III: Connecting and Communicating
America Online — and really the whole Internet itself — exists for one main
reason: to enhance communication between people. Sure, a lot of technical
mumbo-jumbo goes on behind the scenes, but at its heart, the big central idea
involves connecting you to the other computer-using humanoids on the planet.
4
AOL For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

Part III drills down a bit further into your AOL software, focusing exclusively
on the various communications tools at your disposal. It covers the art of
expressing yourself through the basic online tools, such as e-mail, chat
rooms, instant messages, message boards, and even Groups@AOL. It even
examines the newest communication tool in the system, the fascinating AOL
Journals.
Part IV: Diving Into the Fun Stuff
I hear a few fundamental questions over and over from America Online mem-
bers: Where’s the way-cool online information? How do I find the best chats?
I’m getting hungry — where’s the kitchen? 
The chapters in Part IV deliver the goods by focusing on the what’s-out-there
side of online life. They uncover the lively, topical, and up-to-date America
Online content areas, help you take a trip on the Internet, and even find
music to enjoy and burn onto CDs (legally, of course). As its name promises,
this part definitely covers the fun stuff on America Online.
Part V: Secret Tricks of the AOL Gurus
Shhh. I don’t want everyone to hear about this part. Well, at least I don’t want
them to hear about it just yet (you know how spurned techno-weenies behave
sometimes). Part V contains the collected wisdom of many America Online
experts. It’s filled with tips and goodies for making your America Online con-
nection truly come alive. Customize your member profile with new cate-
gories, make hotkeys for your favorite online destinations, and add your own
buttons to the toolbar with the cool techno-tricks documented in this part.
Want to do more? Use the AOL Anywhere tools to keep in touch from wher-
ever you wander — even from your mobile phone or hand-held personal
organizer. Enjoy!
Part VI: The Part of Tens
It just wouldn’t be a For Dummies book without The Part of Tens. In this sec-
tion, you find places to visit when the urge to explore takes hold of your mind
as well as ways to find help when your connection doesn’t work. It’s a pot-
pourri of things to brighten your digital day.

Introduction

Icons Used in This Book
To make finding the important stuff in the book a little easier (and to help
you steer clear of the technical hogwash), this book has a bunch of icons
scattered throughout. Each icon marks something in the text that’s particu-
larly vital to your online existence. Here’s a brief guide to what these little
road signs mean:
If you see a Remember icon, get out your mental highlighter because the text
is definitely worth bearing in mind, both now and in the future.
You can benefit from my experience (both good and bad) whenever you spy a
Tip icon. Whether it marks a trap to avoid or a trick to make your life easier,
you can’t go wrong heeding a Tip.
Like it or not, I have to include some truly technical twaddle. To shield you
from it as much as possible, I mark the techie stuff with this icon. If you see
this turkey, flip — don’t lazily turn — to the next page. Really, it’s better for
everyone this way.
If you need to do something that’s just the tiniest bit dangerous (such as walk
the trail into the Grand Canyon while blindfolded and on laughing gas), this
icon tells you to proceed with caution. Pay close attention to these warnings;
they mark the most dire of pitfalls. (Don’t worry; they aren’t too frequent on
America Online.)
Those folks lucky enough to enjoy high-speed Internet connections can also
enjoy a lot of special content inside America Online. This icon points out where
I highlight the nifty extras that come along with high-speed connections.
Where to Go from Here
Where should you start this amazing journey into the world of America
Online? It depends on your experience level:
 Brand-new members should start with Chapter 2, and then mess around
with the AOL software for a while. Eventually, work your way through all
of Part II and Part III as well.
 Been on America Online a while? In that case, start with the all-new AOL
Journal in Chapter 15.

AOL For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

 Looking to extend your voluminous knowledge of AOL? Part V has your
name on it. Build a Web site, create an amazing member profile, and cus-
tomize your AOL software, all with the info in this part. For bonus
points, visit Chapter 24 and start sending instant messages from your
mobile phone!
Whichever way you choose, go on out there and have some fun — and keep
this book handy just in case you need a little help now and then.

Part I
Driver’s Ed for the
Digital Traveler

In this part . . .
D
river’s education class is the only thing holding this
country together. It’s a massively shared experience.
Everyone, at one time or another, learns how to drive. And
we all do it with white knuckles the ﬁrst time, thinking
that 20 miles per hour is kinda fast and that maybe we
ought to ease it down to a nice, pedestrian 10 miles per
hour for a while.
The ﬁrst time you face the vast plains of the online world,
that old memory may rise up. Gripping the disks with white
knuckles, you wonder whether 56,000 bps is just a little
fast — perhaps you should run the modem at 14,400 bps
until you get the hang of it.
Hey — it’s going to be okay. The truth is that you can surf
the Internet, hold an interactive conversation with people
all over the country, and receive ﬁles from a computer
that’s 7,000 miles away without knowing (or caring to
know) the details of how it all works.
This part gives you an overview of what this crazy
America Online thing is all about and what it can do. It
also offers some tips for getting comfortable in your digi-
tal habitat and a note or two about working and playing
well with others online.
Get ready for the ride of your life. Now, where did I put
those car keys?

Chapter 1
What You Got Yourself Into (And
What You Need to Enjoy the Trip)
In This Chapter
 Discovering what this online thing is all about
 Scoping out the stuff you need to make AOL work
 Turning up the speed meter with DSL and cable 
P
erhaps you just bought a new computer and happened across a stray
icon labeled America Online. Or maybe your parent, child, grandchild,
or significant other decided that you should join the online revolution and
endowed you with all the goodies this revolution requires. Or perhaps you
don’t quite know what to make of all this talk about the information super-
highway and worry that you’re getting left behind at a rest stop.
For a good understanding of what the term online means and where America
Online fits into the equation, start here. This chapter explains the introduc-
tory stuff and prepares you for that first trip into the online world. It also
includes a quick introduction to the realm of high-speed connections, such as
DSL and cable. In a lot of areas, getting a high-speed Internet hookup is
almost as easy as adding a phone line — and costs about the same, too.
For now, kick back and get ready to understand what your parent, child, or
significant other has been talking about all this time. (Feels good to finally
know, doesn’t it?)
What Online Really Means
What is this “Internet” and “online service” stuff, anyway? Does it have some-
thing to do with the information superhighway? Do you even care? Why or
why not? Please write a detailed answer on the inside cover of a matchbook
and then set the whole thing on fire, watching with pleasure as it burns to a
crisp. Don’t you feel better now?

If you do, you’re not alone. Many people feel apprehensive about this myster-
ious electronic world you’re entering. But take heart — online services and the
Internet used to be much more mysterious than they are today. Don’t worry if
the concept seems more than a little bizarre to you right now. That reaction
proves mainly that you’re not a nerd. Congratulations on passing the test!
Back to the question at hand: What is an online service? Conceptually, it’s
much like cable TV. With cable TV, you buy a subscription from your local
cable company and hook your television into its network with a funny-looking
box that freaks out sometimes. From there, a special wire connects the box to
a wall socket.
If the technology does what it should, you turn on the TV and choose from
among a wide variety of programming, depending on your interests. When it
doesn’t work, the problem may be in your TV, in the brain-dead little box, or
somewhere between your wall socket and the cable company itself. At the end
of the month, you get a bill that you grudgingly pay, all the while wondering
whether cable TV is really worth all the time and money you spend on it.
With a few clever substitutions, the cable company example describes
America Online (and other Internet Service Providers, or ISPs). You hook up
your computer to an odd little device called a modem (which, like its cable-TV
counterpart, sometimes freaks out) and plug in a plain phone cord from the
modem to the phone jack on the wall. If you use a special high-speed connec-
tion (with an appropriately high-tech name such as DSL, satellite, or cable
modem), you get an even more esoteric device with its own cool cables. (Flip
to the end of this chapter for more about high-speed access.) Somewhere along
the line, you purchase an AOL membership and pony up the monthly fee.
The top part of Figure 1-1 shows how the process works with a dialup con-
nection, at least when the technology behaves. Your computer runs the spe-
cial America Online software, and then either dials a local phone number or
zooms out through your high-speed Internet connection. From there, your
computer contacts the America Online computers in Virginia. (Incidentally,
don’t worry about long-distance calls to Virginia — you pay for the local part
of the call, and the America Online communications system does the rest.)
After connecting (or, in computer parlance, going online — more about that
shortly), you choose from among a wide variety of services, depending on
your interests. When things don’t work, the problem may be with your com-
puter, the America Online software, the modem (stupid modems), your high-
speed connection, or something between the wall jack and America Online
itself. At the end of the month, you get a bill that you gleefully pay, flush with
the happy memory of everything you did online.
12
Part I: Driver’s Ed for the Digital Traveler 

By the way, the term online means connected. If you’re online with America
Online, a link is set up through the phone between your computer and the
America Online computers. When you get right down to it, the computers are
having this swell digital conversation behind the scenes while you’re busy
reading the news, sending electronic mail, or doing whatever else you do on
America Online.
If you use DSL, a cable modem, or some other high-speed connection, con-
necting to AOL takes even less work, as the lower part of Figure 1-1 shows.
Because your computer already has a permanent high-speed Internet connec-
tion, the America Online software just hops onto the Net through that con-
nection and rides the communication lines straight to the main computers
in Virginia. Quick as a computer price drop, your software connects with
America Online and you’re ready to go.
Now for the great part: That’s all you need to know about the technology
behind America Online. Really — I wouldn’t kid you about something like
this. All the cool things you can do, all the fun tricks, and all the stuff that
makes America Online a really wild and woolly place require a great deal of
technology, but it doesn’t matter to you. You don’t have to know any of this
stuff to use America Online!

Chapter 1: What You Got Yourself Into . . .

All It Takes Is a Bunch of Stuff
Now that you have a conceptual picture of how all this online business hap-
pens, you’re ready to dig a little deeper and get into some specifics. You need
four parts to make the online thing a reality: the America Online software, a
computer, a modem, and a phone line. The following sections explore each
element with just enough detail to give you a good understanding of what
you need without turning you into a computer nerd (ewww — the very
thought gives me the shivers).
For those of you lucky enough to use a high-speed connection to the world of
America Online, that connection (whether through the cable TV system, a
satellite, or a DSL line) replaces the modem and phone line. Better still, the
high-speed connection also replaces the nasty disconnections and painfully
slow downloading speed that a modem can inflict on you.
If this high-speed connection piques your interest, flip to the end of this
chapter for more details about it.
You need the right software
America Online is a pretty special place, not only because of its content and
services but also for the look and feel of its interface (the buttons, menus,
and windows on-screen). The America Online programmers decided to do
things the right way from the start. This decision meant a break with tradi-
tion because people would need special software to join America Online.
Granted, the software was free (and still is today — but more about that in a
moment), but the idea itself was risky for the time. Luckily, the risk paid off
handsomely in better features, ease of use, and consistency.
The America Online software probably came preloaded on your computer,
but that copy definitely isn’t the new America Online version 9.0 program, so
use it only if your computer doesn’t meet the requirements for the newest
AOL software.
To simplify the programmer’s lives and offer you better service, America
Online 9.0 doesn’t work with Windows 95. Such is life in the high-tech lane. 
If your computer still loves Windows 95, stick with America Online 7.0. In the
meantime, seriously consider picking up a new computer. Computers age like
sickly mayflies, so any machine more than five years old really needs a break
anyway.
If you already use America Online, check which version you have. To do that,
start the America Online software, and choose Help➪About America Online
14
Part I: Driver’s Ed for the Digital Traveler 

from the menu bar. The version number is near the top of the screen, as
shown in Figure 1-2. You don’t have to (and, in fact, shouldn’t) sign on to
America Online to find out the software version number.
Although knowing your program’s version number seems like nerd trivia at
its best, it actually makes a big difference. This book covers the newest
America Online software, version 9.0. If you use an older version of the pro-
gram, the book’s instructions could confuse you quickly (and that’s definitely
not my goal). Every time new America Online software comes out, the pro-
grammers move buttons, shift menu items, and generally remodel the whole
thing as they try to make the system easier to use. The programmers tell me
that it’s the price we pay for progress, but sometimes I think it has more to
do with ongoing programmer job security than anything else.
A computer is a must
You can’t get around this one: To use America Online, you must have a
computer of some kind. Sorry, but that’s the way these things go. Having
settled that point, the next logical question is, “Okay, smart guy, what kind
of computer?” “Well,” I reply, “that’s up to you.”
Because the America Online special access software comes in both
Macintosh and Windows versions, you get some leeway in choosing your
computer. Choose the type of machine that makes you most comfortable.
Don’t worry if you use Windows at work but prefer a Macintosh for home
(or vice versa). You can still share documents, spreadsheets, and many other
files between your computers without any (well, without many) problems.

Chapter 1: What You Got Yourself Into . . .

If you buy a new computer for your online adventures, make sure that it has
 A fast processor: For Windows, choose an AMD Athlon or Duron series
or an Intel Celeron or Pentium 4. For the Macintosh crowd, a G4 proces-
sor provides plenty of performance power.
 Plenty of random-access memory (RAM): 256MB is a good minimum for
either a Macintosh or Windows machine.
 A high-quality color monitor: A good minimum size is 17 inches, but 19
inches provides a world of difference. For a flat-panel LCD screen, go
with either 15 or 17 inches, because a panel bigger than that usually
involves mortgaging part of your house.
 Plenty of hard drive space: 30GB or more (why go small?).
If all this computer jargon sounds foreign to you, pick up a copy of PCs For
Dummies, 9th Edition, by Dan Gookin, or Macs For Dummies, 8th Edition, by
David Pogue (both published by Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
A modem enters the picture
The next piece of the puzzle is a modem, the device that converts your com-
puter’s electronic impulses into whistles, beeps, and various digital moose
calls. The modem then yells these noises through the phone line to an
equally disturbed modem attached to another computer.
The term modem is actually an acronym (and you thought you were safe,
didn’t you?). It stands for modulator/demodulator, which is a computer
nerd’s way of saying that it both talks and listens.
Many computers include a built-in modem as part of the deal these days. 
If you aren’t sure whether your PC includes one, glance at the back of the
machine and look for a place to plug in a phone cord. (Check your documen-
tation to make sure that the port isn’t for a built-in Ethernet network adapter;
network jacks and modem jacks look a lot alike!) Congrats — there’s your
modem!
If your computer didn’t come with a modem, or if it’s time to replace the
poor, old, wheezing thing, take the time to shop around for a good, solid
model. You want two things from a new modem: a well-known manufacturer
and some blazing speed. Here’s what to look for when buying either a new or
used modem:

 Get a modem made by U.S. Robotics or Creative Labs. Lots of compa-
nies make modems, but these manufacturers stand behind their prod-
ucts better than all the rest. Although the price of a cheap no-name
modem may look interesting, resist the temptation. Nothing frustrates
your online life more than a cheap modem. The modem connects you to
the whole online world. Don’t hobble your connection with questionable
equipment from a fly-by-night manufacturer.
 If you buy a new modem, make sure it’s fast. Modems that run at
56,000 bits per second (bps) are the de facto standard these days. Most
manufacturers call them 56K modems because K means roughly 1000 in
the computer world. See the “A few words about connections and costs”
sidebar in this chapter for a little more information about these extraor-
dinarily fleet animals.
 Watch those standards when you pick up a new modem. If you buy a
56K modem, be sure that it supports the V.92 standard. V.92 is the
newest international screeching and whistling specification for 56K
modems. When picking America Online access phone numbers, make
sure you look for ones that support V.92. (They’re clearly marked on the
access phone number lists.)
 Watch the standards even closer when buying a used modem. If you
shop around for a used 56K modem in the name of saving money, look
for units that support the V.90 standard, the predecessor to V.92. Avoid
older units using the K56 Flex protocol — a failed competitor to the real
V.90 standard. Although they work, buying into a failed technology
makes no sense.
If you have a high-speed access line, you don’t use a traditional phone-line
modem at all. Instead, the special connections through a cable-TV system, 
a satellite dish, or the phone company require some matching special 
equipment. 
What about a phone line?
All this other stuff doesn’t do you a whit of good if you don’t have a phone line
to connect it to. The phone is your link with beautiful, metropolitan Dulles,
Virginia, the home of America Online. Luckily, you don’t need a special phone
line — just about any phone line works.
The key words in that last sentence are just about because not all phone lines
are created equal. Many phone lines have been endowed by their subscribers
with certain very alien services — such as call waiting — that interfere with a
computer’s basic rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of a connection with
America Online.
17
Chapter 1: What You Got Yourself Into . . .

As you probably guessed, high-speed connections don’t use a phone line like
low-speed modems do. If they did, everyone could zip through America
Online in a collectively quick blaze of glory.
To successfully use a modem, you need an analog phone line. If your home
has a single phone line (or two plain, old-fashioned phone lines), you have an
analog phone line. Because fax machines need the same kind of phone line, in
times of emergency you can unplug the fax and use its phone line to reach
America Online.
At work, the story is a little different. Many office telephone systems use
digital phone lines. You shouldn’t plug a normal modem directly into one of
these lines. Please, for the sake of your modem, don’t try. At best, the modem
won’t work this time. At worst, the modem won’t work ever again because it’s
fried. If you’re planning to use America Online from the office, contact your
telephone folks and tell them that you have a modem and need something to
connect it to. Remember to ask nicely, or else they may not give you the
answer you’re looking for.
Enjoying a High-Speed AOL Experience
As you start looking at high-speed connections, the term bandwidth pops 
up over and over. (After the nerds find a word they like, they use it a lot.)
Bandwidth describes how much data moves through an online connection
over a given period of time.
Modems, for instance, create a low-bandwidth connection. That’s a very tech-
nological way of saying that modems move data slowly. Modems measure
their connection speed in bits per second, or bps.
18
Part I: Driver’s Ed for the Digital Traveler 
A few words about connections and costs
If you use a modem for your America Online
connection, pay a little extra and get the fastest,
highest-quality modem possible. The money you
spend now pays you back tomorrow and many
days thereafter with a solid, smooth-running
Internet connection. On the software side of
things, make sure your America Online connec-
tion dials the local access phone number that
best matches your modem’s capabilities, particu-
larly if you bought a V.92 modem. Check keyword
Access for the latest phone number list.

DSL and cable connections give you a high-bandwidth connection to the
Internet. They measure speed in Kbps, or thousand bits per second, cleverly
recycling the popular nerd convention of substituting K for thousand whenever
possible. As you guessed, the more bits that move through your connection
per second, the more information the computer shoves through your wire in a
given period of time. 
All that techno-speak translates to this: The faster your Internet connection,
the more fun you have during those precious moments spent with America
Online. Like so many other things in life, faster is better.
Digging into the details
High-bandwidth connections come in several shapes, sizes, costs, and
acronyms. The specific connections available where you live depend quite
heavily on exactly where you live in your city, state, and area of the country.
Even though one of the high-speed services may be available in your city, you
may discover that it isn’t in your neighborhood yet. Cost and ease of installa-
tion also vary wildly around the country. (Just because companies sell the
technology doesn’t mean that they know how to put it in yet.)
Don’t automatically assume that no high-bandwidth connections exist in 
your neck of the woods just because you live far away from a booming metro-
politan area. Some of the coolest high-speed projects take place in smaller
cities or more rural communities because those areas understand the eco-
nomic importance of the online world better than their big-city brethren.
DSL and cable represent your two main high-bandwidth options. They cost
about the same, but offer differing levels of speed and reliability. To use
either one, your computer needs a network card that supports either
10baseT or 100baseT Ethernet connections. Lots of new machines include a
network card as part of the standard configuration, but if yours doesn’t, it’s
not a big deal. Every computer store (and many home electronics places,
such as Best Buy and The Good Guys) carries the cards. For a small fee, they
even install the card for you, too.
The whole baseT thing just means “twisted-pair network wire that looks like
overgrown phone cord.” But could the computer people just say that?
Nooooo . . .
Cable: Great when it works, but don’t tell your friends
The first time I heard about “Internet access via cable-TV systems” a few
years ago, I thought that the person was joking. After thinking about it more
(and doing some research on my own), the idea made a lot more sense.
Moving television signals around a community is a lot like moving data
19
Chapter 1: What You Got Yourself Into . . .

around a network — heck, even some of the wire is the same. Today, cable
companies all over the country provide high-speed Internet access over the
same cable lines that deliver Brady Bunch reruns to your living room.
(There’s some kind of irony there, but I can’t quite nail it down.)
When the line works like it should, cable access really screams. It’s quite 
an experience watching a 100MB file pour into your computer in a minute or
two instead of an hour or more. The unfortunate downside of cable Internet
access (which the cable companies rarely bother mentioning) is its shared-
resource concept. Due to the cable system’s design, the subscribers in a given
area share their Internet access (just like you share the neighborhood roads,
particularly during rush hour). When everyone uses the system at once (in
the evening, after work), response time plummets because each person gets
only his or her own increasingly small slice of the total bandwidth. On the
other hand, if you work at home, then your access flies all day because you
aren’t sharing bandwidth with anyone (everybody else is at work, so the
roads are clear).
DSL: Not the fastest, but darned consistent
DSL stands for Digital Subscriber Line, a cool technology that runs through
your existing phone lines. (Considering their huge investment in copper wire,
it’s no wonder that phone companies looked far and wide for a high-speed
solution that turns plain old phone lines into a competitive advantage.)
Your phone company can add a DSL connection to your existing phone 
line. Even though it goes out over the same wire, DSL uses a different kind 
of signal that doesn’t interfere with the voice part of the phone system. 
(It works much like those whistles that we can’t hear, but that drive dogs
absolutely nuts.)
Blazing, consistent speed gives DSL a slight advantage in the market. Cable
systems claim to run at 10 to 20 times the speed of a standard 56K modem,
but they suffer greatly during high-traffic times (particularly on weekday
afternoons and evenings). DSL delivers a slightly slower speed, but without
the shared-resource problems that the cable folks calmly describe as a
“feature” of their system.
Doesn’t this stuff cost a lot of money?
Although high-speed connections cost more than plain modem connections,
the difference isn’t exorbitant. In fact, it’s probably less expensive than you
think.
20
Part I: Driver’s Ed for the Digital Traveler 

For instance, if you have an extra phone line for your computer (those com-
puters tie up the phone like a caffeinated teenager), you pay about $25 per
month. A cable modem connection, which runs 10 to 20 times faster than a
regular dialup modem, costs around $30 per month. Add another $10 to $15
per month to rent the cable modem, and you get a total monthly cost of
about $40 to $45 for cable modem service. (DSL lines cost about the same,
and they still let you drop the spare phone line.) The net cost — because you
don’t need the extra phone line now — drops to $15 to $20.
But the calculation doesn’t stop there. Because high-speed connections link
you straight to the Internet without going through one of America Online’s
local access numbers, your monthly AOL service fee is reduced dramatically.
Instead of paying $23.90 per month for America Online, the cost drops to
$14.95 per month using the Bring Your Own Access plan, at keyword BYOA.
Now the high-bandwidth connection costs only $6 to $11 extra. Hmm . . .
sounds more enticing, doesn’t it?
21
Chapter 1: What You Got Yourself Into . . .
Buying high-speed connection 
straight from America Online
America Online jumped on the high-speed
bandwagon itself with both DSL and cable pro-
duct offerings. Availability depends on where
you live, so for the latest about America Online’s
homegrown high-speed solutions, go to key-
word DSL or keyword Cable (they both take you
to the same place). Type your home phone
number and zip code into the dialog box. After
just a moment, America Online lists its locally
available high-speed plans.
Costwise, America Online’s plans usually look
about the same as the ones from your local
phone and cable companies. You should get
similar service and support as well, although I
figure that the local phone company has a little
more at stake when it comes to keeping me
happy.

Ah, good morning! Nice to see that you’re up (and looking as bright-
eyed and bushy-tailed as ever, I might add). A full chapter lies ahead, so I’m
glad that you slept well.
This chapter offers a whirlwind tour through the cool stuff America Online
offers. Think of this tour as a visual sampler, a platter of digital appetizers,
each one delicious in itself but also tempting in the knowledge that still more
awaits discovery. This chapter gives you a broad idea of what you can do
with America Online — and what it can do for you.
For now, kick back and read on. If something piques your interest, take a
break and try it online. Each section of the chapter includes the keywords
and menu instructions you need.

Signing On
Every online experience starts somewhere, and signing on to the service is as
good a place as any. Just follow these steps to sign on to America Online:
1. Turn on your computer, monitor, modem, stereo, food processor, and
that cool cordless toothbrush/answering machine in the bathroom.
Marvel at what modern technology accomplished in your life (and
how loud it all sounds), and then turn off the unimportant stuff.
No, you need to leave the computer on for now.
Your computer starts blissfully and leaves you with a ready-to-go
desktop screen.
2. Find the triangular America Online icon lurking among all your other
software icons and double-click it to start the program.
In Windows, look on the Start button menu or on the Windows desktop.
After the program finishes loading, it displays the Sign On dialog box.
3. Choose the screen name you want to use by clicking the down arrow
next to the Screen Name box and then clicking the name of your choice.
If this is the first time you chose this particular screen name with the
America Online 9.0 software, the program accosts you with another
dialog box (called the Password Store Information Box) that demands to
know whether you want to store your password. For now, click Cancel
and ignore the dialog box. If your curiosity feels piqued by this option,
flip to Chapter 5 and un-pique it with the details awaiting you there.
Don’t panic if the Password text box disappears after you choose a
screen name. It means that the password for that name is already stored
in the access software.
4. Press Tab to move down to the Password box and then type your
password.
Your password appears as asterisks — not as letters and numbers.
That’s a protection feature to keep that guy who’s looking over your
shoulder from breaking into your account. What guy? Why, that one
right there. (Yipe!)
5. Click Sign On or press Enter to open the connection to America
Online.

The software goes through all kinds of cool visual gymnastics while con-
necting. Granted, the visuals aren’t a Hollywood masterpiece, but at
least they’re marginally entertaining.
If the connection process doesn’t work, make a note of the last step the
software accomplished (initialized the modem, dialed, connected, or
requested network attention, for example) and then try connecting
again. If it still doesn’t work, close the America Online software, restart
your computer, and give your software one last chance to get things
right. (Aren’t you glad that your car doesn’t work this way?)
If your software still doesn’t connect to America Online, breeze through
Chapter 25 for a list of the top ten problems and how to solve them.
6. After a moment, the Welcome window appears.
Congratulations — you’re online and ready to do some stuff.
Although the Welcome window takes over the screen, both the Quick Start
and Buddy List windows nab some real estate, too.

Upgrading to AOL 9.0? Find out what’s new here!
Every time the America Online software shifts
into a new version, a bunch of new features and
options appear, but the programmers really
outdid themselves this time. Compared to its
lower-numbered brethren, America Online 9.0
looks, feels, and acts like a whole different
breed of application.
A huge new emphasis on customization leads
the feature list. Once upon a time, America
Online viewed customization the same way that
Henry Ford did with his Model T: Members could
customize the software any way they wanted,
as long as they didn’t change a thing. America
Online 9.0 completely turns that around, putting
the members in control of everything from the
program’s visual appeal to the contents of the
new QuickView window, which lives behind a
new tab right off the Welcome window.
Deeper within the software, you find a new, more
powerful e-mailbox, with a message preview
pane, spam controls that learn your preferences
over time, and new search and save features.
Instant messages now offer voice, video, and file
transfer options, along with SuperBuddy Icons
that animate according to what you type (smiling
when you type a :), for instance). 
For a great quick-reference guide to America
Online 9.0 features, sign on with your new
software and then, on the main menu, select
Keyword➪AOL 9.0 Optimized Features. The
guide window appears in short order. You can
even download or print the guide to peruse at
your leisure by clicking the appropriate links
near the bottom of the window.

Checking the E-Mailbox
Electronic mail (or e-mail) is one of the most popular America Online services.
That’s why the e-mail button takes a position of pride and power on the left
side of the Welcome window. If the flag is up and a letter sticks out of the 
mailbox, you have mail waiting (an everyday occurrence in my world and
soon to be a regular feature of yours, too). The number next to the mailbox
shows the number of messages currently stuffed into your box. If you don’t
have any mail waiting, the graphic shows a closed mailbox labeled Mail Center.
For a quick peek at what’s in there, position your mouse pointer over 
the mailbox icon. When you do that, the mailbox icon runs through a little
animation (isn’t it cute?), and then the Mail QuickView window appears. This
window lists the sender and subject (at least the first 20 characters or so)
from the 10 most recent e-mail messages in your box. If you move the pointer
over one of the entries (as Figure 2-1 shows), the box shows more of the
subject line, plus the time (or day, if it’s not from today) that the message
arrived. Clicking one of the entries in the QuickView window brings the mes-
sage up in its own Read Mail window.
To read your mail, click the You’ve Got Mail button on the Welcome window
or click the mailbox button on the toolbar. After the New Mail window pops
up, start looking through your mail. In your copious communication time,
give these tips a try as well: 
 Find messages from your friends fast with the new Show Me Mail
From tool on your mailbox window. Click the drop-down menu next to
Show Me Mail From, and then choose what kind of mail you want to see:
notes from people you know (from addresses in your Address Book),
junk from bulk mailers, still more junk from unknown senders, or every-
thing from everybody. This feature makes sifting your mail a breeze.
Figure 2-1:

window lets

 Train your software to sift away junk e-mail automatically. When a
piece of junk e-mail wanders into your box, click once on the message,
and then click the Report Spam button. Your software shifts the message
into the Spam Folder and makes a mental note about what to do with
future messages that look like this one.
 To see the junk e-mail messages that your software filtered away, click
the Spam Folder link near the bottom-left side of the mailbox window.
If you find something in there that isn’t junk e-mail, click the message
once, and then click the This Is Not Spam button. Your America Online
software promptly remembers to let future messages like that one into
your box. 
As you probably figured out by now, Chapter 11 covers most everything you
need to know about addressing, sending, receiving, and generally dealing
with e-mail.
Reading the Latest News
There’s nothing like disappearing behind the morning newspaper while
waiting for that first cup of coffee to turn you into a human being. But why
wait for the paper? With America Online, you have your choice of not one,
not two, but — heck — a slew of the best news sources on the planet.
Start with a trip to the main America Online news area, at keyword News.
Thanks to a sleek new redesign, the news area packs a lot of information into
a very small space. Just a few clicks sweep you between the headlines, sports
news, and the world of entertainment.
27
Chapter 2: I Didn’t Know You Could Do That Online!
Say the magic keyword and get there fast
Keywords are the America Online answer to the
Star Trek transporter. A keyword is a word or
phrase that immediately takes you to a partic-
ular forum or service on the system. Chapter 8
explains all the details of keywords, but here’s
a quick intro to get you started.
To use a keyword, type it in the white box in the
middle of the navigation bar across the top of
the screen and then press Enter. Was that fast
or what?
For keyboard-centric folks (that’s me), press
Ctrl+K to open the Keyword dialog box, type
your keyword, and press Enter.
Either way, America Online takes you straight to
your destination.

If you prefer magazines to newspapers, America Online still keeps you cov-
ered. Check out Better Homes and Gardens (keyword BHG), Business Week
(keyword BW), Entertainment Weekly (keyword EW), Sports Illustrated (key-
word SI), or Teen People (keyword Teen People).
For a moving perspective on the news (or at least a moving picture of the
news), visit the news and sports areas inside keyword Video. This high-speed
perk provides video feeds from ABC News, CBS Marketwatch, CNN NewsPass,
College Sports TV, NASCAR.COM, SI.COM, and the Weather Channel, plus lots
of other fascinating options.
Eyeing the Markets
Managing your stock portfolio has never been easier. The Quotes service
(keyword Quotes, or click the Finance icon on the toolbar) tracks the stocks
closest to your heart and pocketbook.
To satisfy a brief curiosity, you can look up a single stock by its symbol. Figure
2-2, for example, uses the AOL symbol to display America Online stock activity.
If looking at the big picture is more to your liking, the Portfolio feature (key-
word Portfolio) follows all the stocks you choose, tracking the current market
price and how that translates into a gain or loss for your invested dollars.

Columbus, Eriksson, Magellan, and you
New services appear in America Online faster
than facial aberrations on a junk-food-loving
teenager. How do you explore them all? Leave
it to those clever America Online programmers
to think of a way: the Member Welcome Center
(keyword Welcome Center) and What’s New on
AOL (keyword New).
The Welcome Center includes an overview of
what’s in the new AOL 9.0 software, an intro-
duction to the myriad features of the system,
and the requisite syrupy public-relations stuff
reminding you how much you love the service.
Don’t let the fluff put you off, though — the
Welcome Center includes some genuinely
useful goodies.
Check the What’s New on AOL section for the
top five new and cool things to do with America
Online, plus a fun collection of the latest system
additions. New stuff is added all the time, so
check this page frequently (every week or two
should do it). 
Take a few minutes and check out both the
Welcome Center and What’s New on AOL.
They’re definitely worth the trip.

Like all widely available stock quote systems, the information in Quotes &
News gets delayed about 20 minutes. I guess that means you can’t call it up-
to-the-minute information. Hmm — how about up-until-just-a-little-while-ago
information?
America Online charges no extra fee to use the Quotes & News service — it’s
part of the service. Flip to Chapter 19 to find out more about America Online
financial offerings.
Internet On Ramp, Next Right
At this point in your online life, you’ve probably heard, read, or otherwise
discovered something about the Internet. If Internet mania somehow passed
you by, don’t worry; it’s about to hit.
The Internet is the worldwide network of networks that’s all the rage these
days. You can’t get your hair done, shop for tires, or even play cricket without
somehow bumping into the Internet. “Oh, is that a new cricket bat?” you ask.
“Aye, a player in the rec.sport.cricket Internet newsgroup recommended
it.” See what I mean?
The America Online 9.0 software integrates the Web, Internet newsgroups,
and everything else the Internet offers into a single simple connection. Go
straight to any Web site by typing its address into the big white address 
box at the top of the main window. For the newsgroups, go to keyword
Newsgroups. Either way, you find the information you want in no time at all.

There’s far too much to say about the Internet to cover it here, so cruise to
Chapter 17 and get ready for the ride of your life.
Let the Fun and Games Begin!
Because all work and no play makes me grumpy (and probably does the same
thing to you), take a break from the Internet and indulge in some fun. The
online world offers games to suit every age, style, and taste.
Whether your idea of action includes Backgammon, Bingo, Cribbage, Spades,
or Slots (for points, not money), head for the America Online Games (keyword
Games). Cosponsored by computer game giant Electronic Arts, the Games
area offers everything your heart desires from classic board and card games
to high-tech action. For a more sedate and erudite alternative, try your hand
at The New York Times crossword puzzle (keyword New York Times, and then
click the Crosswords/Games link). You can try its free puzzles or pony up $35
for a one-year subscription to the ultimate New York Times crossword and
word-game experience. 
Multiplayer computer games live all over America Online and the Internet as
well. Inside AOL, spin over to keyword Game Talk to try the online fantasy
and space role-playing games. Venturing out to the Net, visit Yahoo! Games
(games.yahoo.com) for card games such as Canasta, Hearts, and Spades;
strategy games such as Backgammon and Go; and a cool collection of fantasy
sports games. Best of all, the games are free, so play as long as you want (or
until your better half casually suggests that you stop).
Following the Ball, Puck, and Sinker
Go ahead. Yell at the top of your voice. Scream at the stats till you’re blue —
with no one around to cast a sideways glance. Let’s face it: You and your com-
puter have been through a lot together. It’s about time you let it know how
you really feel about sports.
Delve into America Online’s sports offerings for the current thrills, the off-
season victories, and the esoteric agonies of defeat. Whether you thrill to the
high-stress challenge of crowd motivation (keyword Sports Chat, and then
double-click the Cheerleading entry), love the Special Olympics (keyword
Special Olympics), or keep warm all winter with snow sports (keyword Snow
Sports), use the Sports Channel to keep current and locate others who share
your interests. If you’re the only person you know who follows cricket, for
example, you can get your fill from the AOL World Sports Cricket area (key-
word World Sports, and then click the Cricket tab).

Take a stroll through the main AOL Sports window (keyword Sports) and
click a sport that interests you. The window provides tabs for the season’s
current events, including auto racing, baseball, and football. Click the Index
link if your favorite doesn’t appear in the main window lineup. For folks with
high-speed connections, the AOL Sports window also displays current-season
video highlights in a handy thumbnail window.
Nailing Down the Details
Oh no! The deadline for your Chemical Composition of Peeps report looms in
less than two days, and you haven’t even started the research. Worse than
that, the car’s in the shop, a wave of snow blocks the front door, and the
library’s closed due to blizzard conditions.
Before giving up in despair and heading for consolation from that huge box of
hot-chocolate mix in the kitchen, try researching your topic through America
Online and the Internet. A Web site or Internet newsgroup exists for almost
anything. Heck, even Peeps reside on the Net — try the Peep Research Web
site (www.peepresearch.org) or the alt.food.peeps newsgroup (keyword
Newsgroups, and then visit alt.food.peeps).
Start your search in the Internet address box, which you find nestled next to
the Go button on the browser bar. Type your search term (algebra, Polish his-
tory, marshmallow peeps, or whatever) and press Enter, and then browse
through the Recommended Sites, Sponsored Links, and Matching Sites lists
that appear. Because searches usually return hundreds (or thousands) of
matches, remember to click through all the results pages with the links in the
lower-right corner of the page. If you don’t see anything that looks promising,
try one of the links in the Narrow Your Search text box (also at the bottom of
each search page).
While you’re at it, a News and Photo search (keyword News Search) provides
all relevant news articles and photographs for your topic within the past 
30 days. And keyword Research takes you to a trove of sources for more
information about your topic, including a dictionary, a thesaurus, an almanac
(behind the More Resources link), the World Book Encyclopedia, and map
libraries.

Enjoying a Little Chat
The People Connection (click the People button on the toolbar or use keyword
Chat) is the home of the America Online chat areas. Interactively talk (well,
type) with other America Online subscribers at all hours of the day or night.
All this chat happens in what the technology jockeys call real time, which is 
a fancy way of saying that right after you type a message, the other people 
in that chat area see it on their screens, wherever they are in the world.
The chat areas usually hold a maximum of 36 people.
When Problems Come Up
Compared to other online services, America Online offers an awesome array
of support options. You can find online chat areas, interactive tutorials, step-
by-step walkthroughs, discussion boards, and even an old-fashioned, pick-up-
the-phone-and-call-a-human line. Whew — it really has you covered.
Precisely where you look for answers depends on the problem afflicting you
at the moment. Here’s a quick guide to help you find assistance fast:
 If anyone asks for your password or account information through e-mail
or an instant message, do not give him or her any information — the
person lies. Instead, flip to Chapter 4 immediately. It unmasks these per-
ilous hoaxes and tells you how to handle them through AOL’s built-in
security tools, like keyword Notify.
 If you can’t sign on, call the America Online Technical Guru Department
at 800-827-3338. Wade through the menu prompts, cross your fingers,
and get ready to work through your problem with one of the helpful
America Online technical-support folks. If you call at one of the system’s
peak times (such as early in the evening), keep some reading material
handy because you may be on hold for a while. 
 If you can sign on but don’t know how to do something (for example,
send an e-mail or read your Internet newsgroups), look in this book first
because the information is probably in here somewhere. If I left it out,
you have my apologies (goodness knows, I tried to cover everything).
For more help, try the AOL Help center (keyword Help) and click the
topic that’s causing you grief. Want assistance from a real human? Visit
the Live Help area (keyword Live Help) for an online chat with a helpful
AOL staffer. If you prefer an automated tour approach to learning, go
over to the Show Me area at keyword Show Me. For a more in-depth
approach, spend some time in the People Connection’s Help Exchange
discussion area (keyword Help Exchange). Pose your question there so
that fellow AOL members can offer their best solutions.

For general assistance with online conduct, viruses, scams, and account
security, take a look at AOL Safety, Security, and Privacy (keyword Safety &
Security). It covers all that and more.
Handling the Rude, the Crude, 
and the Socially Maladjusted
Few things spoil a perfectly wonderful online evening quite like an annoying
oddball in your favorite chat room, a persistently pestering instant message,
or an obnoxious e-mail. When problems arise, you need to take action, and
this section points you in the right direction.
The following list explains how to handle the various (and unfortunately
common) annoyances of online life. If something comes up that’s not on the
list, check keywords Help, Safety & Security, Notify AOL, or TOS (AOL’s
Terms of Service area) for suggestions.
 Disrupting a chat room: Click the Notify AOL button at the bottom-right
side of the chat window to report the problem and summon help. Fill out
the brief form and then click the Send button.
 Someone just asked for your password in an instant message: Click 
the Notify AOL button in the Instant Message window to open the I Need
Help dialog box, and then follow the instructions from there. If you’re 
in a chat room, be sure to warn everyone else that someone is fishing 
for passwords! If you accidentally did give out your password, go imme-
diately (and I mean right-now-don’t-wait-to-think) to keyword Password
and change your account password.
 Annoying instant messages: Don’t close the Instant Message window
just yet. Instead, click the Notify AOL button in the Instant Message
window to open the Notify AOL dialog box, and then follow the on-
screen instructions carefully to complete your report.
 Questionable e-mail messages: To report e-mail problems, click the
Forward button in the bothersome e-mail message and send it to screen
name TOSReports. If someone you don’t know sends you an e-mail mes-
sage with an attached file, do not download the file! Instead, forward the
message directly to the same screen name, TOSReports. The odds are
very good that the file could mess up your computer or set up some-
thing to steal your America Online password, both of which fall under
the not a good thing heading.
For help reporting other problems, such as raunchy screen names, vulgar
member profiles, or tasteless America Online member Web sites, go to key-
word Notify AOL and click the appropriate button to display the correct
reporting window.

When It’s Time to Say Goodbye
All good things must come to an end, and so it is with America Online. But
signing off from the system is quick and painless. Here’s a quick list of good-
bye (and goodbye-related) options in the America Online 9.0 software:
 To sign off from the system, choose Sign Off➪Sign Off from the menu bar.
This action closes your online connection and leaves you sitting quietly
in front of the main America Online window.
 To switch to another screen name, choose Sign Off➪Switch Screen Name
from the menu bar. In the Switch Screen Name dialog box (shown in
Figure 2-3), double-click the name you want to use, and follow the on-
screen instructions for typing your new password. In just a moment,
America Online signs your other screen name on to the system — and
you don’t even have to redial the phone! For more about creating new
screen names, see Chapter 6.
 To shut down the America Online software, choose File➪Exit. You’re
finished!
Finally, save some power by shutting down your computer and monitor.
Years ago, the computer tech folks recommended leaving your computer
turned on all the time as a way of keeping the machine healthy. While this
advice made some small degree of sense back then, it also wasted a lot of
electricity in the process. Today’s machines don’t suffer from regular starting
and stopping.

Chapter 3
Peering through AOL’s Windows
In This Chapter
 Browsing the menus 
 Camping on the toolbar
 Cruising with the navigation bar
 Touring the main windows
O
nly one thing stands between you and the online world. It’s . . . it’s . . .
the America Online user interface! (Insert scary organ music here.)
No, it’s not something else you need to buy. The term user interface is just a
fancy way of describing the menus, buttons, and goodies you use to interact
with a program. It’s like an automobile engineer looking at the layout of a
dashboard and thinking, “Golly, that’s a clever user interface.” (Yes, despite
the various specialties, most engineers respond to the simplest thing in a pre-
dictably unintelligible way — they’re just that way.)
This chapter covers the main parts of the America Online 9.0 user interface:
the windows, the toolbar, the navigation bar, and the main menu. Whether
you use these tools together or separately doesn’t matter, because they make
your life a little easier either way (and that’s more than you can say for most
software on the market).
Starting at the Top with the Menu,
Toolbar, and Navigation Bar
Sometimes, the best way to get something done involves going straight to the
top. In the America Online software, that means raising your eyes upwards to
the heavens — or at least to the top of your screen. There, you find the three
key pieces of the America Online interface: the main menu, the toolbar, and
the navigation bar.

The main menu
Unlike the last few versions of the America Online software, 9.0 finally returns
the main menu (shown in Figure 3-1) to its rightful position as the focal point of
online activity. Better still, the programmers reorganized things so the menu
structure follows the generally accepted layout used by pretty much every
other Windows application in the world. That means you won’t need to guess
where the Print command, for instance, might live in the new software. It’s
exactly where every other Windows program puts it, in the File menu. Thank
goodness for small consistencies!
In addition to helping you with mundane things, such as printing and finding
a window that’s lost in the visual shuffle, the main menu also gives you quick
access to e-mail features, community areas, and all kinds of AOL services.
The following list gives a quick description of each menu so you know where
to look for what:
 File: The File menu governs everything dealing with text (such as news
articles, bulletin-board postings, and forum announcements), files,
digital photos, downloads, and other trivialities, such as exiting the
America Online access program (but who’d ever want to do that?). The
CD/Media Player also lives in here, as does the Filing Cabinet (now
known by the Mail Saved on My PC menu item), the Log Manager, and
the Print command.
 Edit: Just about every Windows program has an Edit menu, and thank-
fully the America Online software isn’t an exception to the rule. The Edit
menu contains basic text-editing tools, such as Cut, Copy, and Paste, the
built-in spell checker, links to the online dictionary and thesaurus, and
the clever little Capture Picture menu item, which lets you make a pho-
tograph with your Web camera.
 Mail: The many e-mail functions moved back to the main menu in this
edition of the America Online software. Dive into the Mail menu for
everything from checking your new mail to reading the mail saved on
your computer (to the same Filing Cabinet area you found in the File
Figure 3-1:
America
Online’s
main menu
stands
ready to
assist you.
38
Part I: Driver’s Ed for the Digital Traveler 

menu). This menu also includes the new Set Away Message feature,
which tells AOL to send one of those nifty “I’m away from my computer
and am actively ignoring you” messages to everybody who drops an
e-mail into your box.
 Community: A new addition to the software, the Community window
covers the fun things that help you link up with other America Online
members. It includes chat rooms, the Match Chat feature, your Buddy
List, member profiles, the Member Directory, and the searchable online
white pages. To promote communications within the community, it also
contains links to Hometown, the AOL Journals, the Groups system, the
message boards, and the Internet newsgroups.
 Services: Frankly, I don’t really grasp what the programmers wanted to
accomplish with the Services menu. It’s a rather weird mix of unrelated
items, much like the junk drawer in my kitchen. Entries for the Calendar
and You’ve Got Pictures sit next to Car Buying, Classified Ads, and the
Yellow Pages. Sports Scores, TV Listings, Recipe Finder, and Homework
Help round out the menu. It’s kinda different.
 Window: This menu is a whoa-I-have-too-many-windows-open naviga-
tional lifesaver. If you misplace an Instant Message window or lose track
of your Web browser, head to the Window menu and find it right away in
the ever-changing open windows list at the bottom of this menu.
 Keyword: Zoom around America Online at lightning speed with the
Keyword menu. This tiny little menu helps you prowl through all of the
keywords on the system and quickly brings up the Keyword dialog box.
Strangely, it also contains a link to the downloadable AOL 9.0 quick refer-
ence manual. (I guess they ran out of room on the Services menu.)
 Sign Off: When it’s time to hit the trail and mosey off to other matters,
head to the Sign Off menu. As the name implies, this menu signs you off
of America Online. It also lets you switch between your screen names
without signing off, which makes life a whole lot easier for people who
use a modem.
 Help: If you have trouble getting on America Online, check the Help
menu for assistance. This menu isn’t particularly good at helping you
with problems after signing on to the system (you can get help faster by
just pressing the F1 key), but it does a great job with the before sign-on
problems, such as when your computer refuses to connect with AOL.
Most of the menu options stay available all of the time, but some (particu-
larly the ones in the Edit menu) appear gray every now and then. When a
menu item looks a little sickly and doesn’t work, it means that software
thinks the menu item isn’t relevant to whatever you’re doing right then. For
instance, you can’t copy something with Edit➪Copy until you highlight your
selection by clicking and dragging the mouse over it. Grayed-out menu items
don’t mean that your software is broken, only that it’s bored.
39
Chapter 3: Peering through AOL’s Windows

The toolbar
Immediately below the main menu you find the big, friendly, graphical toolbar,
displayed in Figure 3-2. This clever piece of navigational assistance provides
single-click access to the most-requested online tools and areas. It also offers
an easy-to-customize personal button area, with plenty of room for links to all
of your favorite areas.
The mixture and position of toolbar buttons change depending on the
Parental Controls for the current screen name and the amount of customiza-
tion you did inside your software. If the left side of your toolbar doesn’t look
like the one in Figure 3-2, then your screen name probably has a Parental
Controls age restriction on it, like Mature Teen or Young Teen. If the right side
of the toolbar looks different, that’s perfectly normal. That side contains
user-created customizable buttons. Although AOL populates the area with a
few entries just to get you started, most everybody replaces them with their
own choices.
Unlike earlier versions, the AOL 9.0 toolbar contains buttons — pretty,
graphical buttons to be sure, but simple buttons nonetheless. In other recent
versions of the America Online software, the programmers experimented with
a truly groundbreaking and completely misguided interface design where
some buttons acted like buttons, while others revealed drop-down menus.
After several years of wondering why nobody seemed to understand how the
buttons worked, someone thankfully pulled the plug on the experiment and
put back the old-fashioned buttons that simply do what they should.
Here’s a quick look at what each of the permanent buttons (the ones on the
left side of the toolbar) do for you:
 Read: Opens the mailbox window and displays your new mail. This button
works just like selecting Mail➪Read Mail from the main menu. Hover the
mouse pointer over this button to display the Mail QuickView window,
showing information about your ten most recent e-mail messages.

Part I: Driver’s Ed for the Digital Traveler 

 Write: Create a new e-mail message from scratch. Either click this button
or select Mail➪Write Mail on the main menu.
 IM: Send a new instant message to someone. Click this button to get a
blank Instant Message window, just waiting for your attention.
 People: Brings up the People Connection window (keyword People
Connection) for chatting, connecting, and more.
 Safety: This area explains security issues such as virus protection,
Parental Controls, and safe communication with others you meet online.
You can also get here with keyword Safety & Security.
 Settings: Takes you into the rather voluminous AOL Settings window
(the same as keyword Settings). See Chapter 5 for more about the many
options in here.
 Music: Click here to visit AOL’s awesome music portal at keyword Music.
Songs, videos, stories and more — if it’s music, it’s here.
 Finance: Delivers the AOL Personal Finance window (keyword Personal
Finance). If you hover the mouse pointer over this button, you get the
Finance QuickView window, with a quick snapshot of the markets and
links to your online portfolios.
The whole right side of the toolbar (framed with a shaded color) contains the
customizable buttons. For the lowdown on turning this part of the toolbar
into your personal collection of favorite destinations, turn to Chapter 21.
When you can’t remember the details about a particular button, click it and
see what happens! You can’t hurt your computer or your AOL software by
clicking a button. Get adventurous and do some exploring!
The navigation bar
Just below the toolbar is a thin little group of controls known as the navigation
bar. Even though the navigation bar is small, it plays a vital role in your time
on America Online by acting as both your native guide and skillful scribe.
The navigation bar includes only a few controls, but what these controls lack
in number, they make up for in power. Here’s a quick breakdown, from left to
right, of the cool things awaiting you (for a complete multimedia experience,
follow along with Figure 3-3 as you read the following out loud — but don’t let
anybody see you do it, okay?):
41
Chapter 3: Peering through AOL’s Windows

 Quick Start button: This little guy makes the floating Quick Start window
reappear if you closed it at some point in time. (Really — that’s it. The
button doesn’t do anything else. Kind of a boring existence, isn’t it?)
 Browser buttons: The four buttons on the left side of the navigation bar
provide the basic features you need to steer through the Web. (The but-
tons work with America Online–based information areas, too, although it
takes some practice before you get the hang of it.) The right- and left-
pointing triangle buttons are Back and Forward. The Back button takes
you to the Web site or information area you last saw, and the Forward
button returns you to the page you were on when you clicked Back. The
X button is Stop, which whacks your America Online software over the
head, making it lose its concentration for a moment and stop whatever
it’s doing. The curly arrow is the Reload button, which tells your Web
browser to reload the current page. (It doesn’t work with America
Online areas.)
 Address box: This handy box saves you time and energy by accepting
both America Online keywords and Web addresses. This always-present
box does mostly the same thing as the Keyword dialog box (the one that
appears when you click the AOL Keyword button or press Ctrl+K). Just
type a keyword or Web address in the box and then press Enter or click
Go. If it’s a Web address, then America Online immediately whisks you
away to the appointed online destination. If it’s a keyword, the system
takes you to a search page, listing the keyword at the top of the page,
along with lots of related Web sites. (It’s a strange behavior, but helpful
in its own odd way.)
 Go button: Click this button to visit the keyword or Web address in the
Address box. (If you prefer a keyboard-oriented approach, just press the
Enter key instead of messing with the Go button.)
 Search button: One click opens the Search window, just like keyword
Search. The Search window offers links to the main AOL Search system,
the Image Search system, and the Website Directory.
 Favorites button: Displays the Favorites window, with all of your care-
fully saved Favorite Places in it. If you click the down-arrow part of the
Favorites button, the software displays a drop-down menu with your
Favorite Places, plus menu items for your personalized Hotkeys, Toolbar
menu additions, and an option that adds the top window to your
Favorites.

The navigation bar always appears below the toolbar, no matter how you
configure your America Online software. So there.
Meeting Your Windows on the World
Everywhere you go on America Online, you find windows. Welcome windows,
information area windows, search windows — sheesh, spring cleaning
around here must be a total nightmare.
Although a bunch of stacked-up windows seem a little confusing at first, they
make America Online the special place that it is. Ever since the early days of
the service, the developers built America Online with the Microsoft Windows
graphical way of life in mind — and it shows.
This section introduces the windows that appear every time America Online
springs into action. Details about the content areas (the stuff you get to by
clicking links in these windows) come later in this book. For now, sit back,
grab a bottle of spray cleaner, and head for the windows of your digital world.
Getting to know the twins: 
Welcome and QuickView 
Looking for the right place to start your online expedition? Try the Welcome
and QuickView windows, shown respectively in Figures 3-4 and 3-5. From
here, the news, weather, e-mail, and pretty much everything else inside
America Online is only a quick jump away. You can even pick some of what
you see and how you see it!
Every time you sign on to America Online, this helpful pair of windows leaps
into action. Figure 3-4 shows the dynamic window duo on an average day.
The Welcome window offers a great big “Hi there — welcome to the system!”
It’s like an electronic version of the Wal-Mart door greeter, only better. This
greeter doesn’t just wish you well; it says hi, tells you the top news headlines,
keeps tabs on your e-mail box, and never hits you with a shopping cart. 
Several key areas make up the Welcome window, although the details of what
appears in each section depend greatly on which Welcome window layout
you selected at keyword Change My Welcome Screen. The options range
from a focus on business, news, and sports to details about movies, music,
and online fun. Whichever one you select, you always get a big center section
that displays the top news stories and your key interest areas, your local
weather forecast, and plenty of buttons leading to online tools (e-mail,
Radio@AOL, and such) and areas relating to your interests.
43
Chapter 3: Peering through AOL’s Windows

The fascinating new QuickView window lives behind the Welcome window.
To see it, click the QuickView tab in the upper-left corner of the Welcome
window. Things immediately shift on-screen, leaving you with a large six-
paned window that’s yours to customize almost as much as you want, as
shown in Figure 3-5.

Figure 3-4:

44
Part I: Driver’s Ed for the Digital Traveler 

Almost as much as you want!? Yes, almost. By clicking the Customize button on
the upper-right side of the QuickView window, you get to select which items
appear in here. That’s the customizable part. The almost as much as you want
part enters the picture because you only get to choose from the options 
your AOL software offers. So, if you want an area about DVDs and videos, for
instance, everything’s great — that’s one of the options in the list. If you 
want the top game headlines from the More Than Games Web site (www.
morethangames.com), you’re sunk. The moral of the story: QuickView works
really well, but only with its pre-set selection of choices. Express yourself by
customizing your QuickView window, but do it with the same options that
everybody else gets. It’s individual conformity, raised to a whole new level.
Incidentally, whatever you choose for the QuickView window also appears in
your Web-based My AOL window (keyword My AOL). That’s why some of the
QuickView options let you select far more things than could possibly fit into
the little window.
45
Chapter 3: Peering through AOL’s Windows
A tale of three icons
Once upon a time, three little icons — a heart, a
guy, and a pad of paper — left their homes to
seek fame and fortune in the world. At some
point in the journey, they wandered into the
office of a sad programmer at America Online.
The programmer needed three stylish icons to
appear atop every window in his software, but
he couldn’t find any icons that fit the part. When
the icons and the programmer saw each other
for the first time, brilliant sunlight streamed
through the window, an orchestral interlude
swelled in the background, and everybody
looked around trying to figure out where the
light and the music were coming from.
Okay, so it probably didn’t happen that way, but
that’s one explanation for the three buttons that
appear in the upper-right title bar of the win-
dows inside America Online. Each button helps
you either save or share a link to the current
window.
 Heart icon: Click the Heart icon (the one of
the far left) to display a little Favorites dialog
box, which lets you add the current window
to your Favorite Places, make a toolbar
button for it, or insert a link for the area into
an instant message or an e-mail.
 AOL man icon: When you see the little guy
(the middle icon), think speed! Think action!
Think insert a link for the current window in
an instant message! Granted, it’s a long
thought, but that’s what the little fellow
does. And yes, this does exactly the same
thing as clicking the Heart icon and then
selecting the Insert in Instant Message
option — this just works faster.
 Paper icon: Clicking this button (the one on
the far right) creates a new e-mail message
that includes a link to the current window.
It even inserts a catchy subject line based
on the window’s title bar.
Older versions of the AOL software show only
one button instead of three in the upper-right
corner of the window. The solitary button looks
like a heart on a piece of paper. It works just 
like the happy Heart icon does in the new 9.0
software.

Watching your friends with the Buddy List
Ah, the Buddy List. It’s America Online’s answer to the musical question,
“Who can I talk to right now?” By adding all of your friends, acquaintances,
business associates, family members, neighbors, and package delivery
people to your Buddy List, you get an easy way to say hi, carry on a conver-
sation, and generally see when they’re using America Online, CompuServe,
Wal-Mart Connect, or AIM (the AOL Instant Messenger).
I can tell you a lot more about the Buddy List — so much that this book con-
tains a whole chapter devoted to the subject. Check out Chapter 9 to uncover
the secrets, the value, and the clever options that drive this extremely useful
part of your America Online toolkit.
Going anywhere with Quick Start
The third item in this jaunt through the windows also makes its first appear-
ance in the America Online 9.0 software. The Quick Start window replaced the
long-lived Channels window (still available at keyword Channels if you feel nos-
talgic) with a more compact, yet more feature-filled navigational experience.
In its top section, the long, tall Quick Start window offers buttons for fun
things, such as AOL Search, online shopping, maps, movie times, and the
yellow pages. If you click one of the five section headings filling out the rest
of the window, a little swing-out menu appears, just like Figure 3-6 shows.
These swing-out menus offer lots of links to related information areas all over
AOL and the Internet.
Figure 3-6:
Click one

Quick Start
headings for

goodies.
46
Part I: Driver’s Ed for the Digital Traveler 

Several specific options appear beneath each section heading. These entries
work like simple buttons — click one, and a new window appears. Some of
the windows bring up old Channel areas (such as News and Living), while
others just lead to popular areas.
Unlike the QuickView window that I discussed previously, everything on the
Quick Start window is pre-set. You can’t move or change anything. Sorry, but
that’s just how it goes.

Just when you thought visiting your e-mail box was safe, out come the spams,
scams, hoaxes, and other annoyances of online life. Like their snail mail coun-
terparts, junk e-mail comes in all shapes and sizes, with varying degrees of
apparent officiality and believability. Worse yet, some of the messages mask
outright scams designed to steal your account password, cost you money, or
generally mess up your tidy online world.
Protect yourself from these mailbox perils with the tips and information in
this chapter. The following pages cover the seamy realms of junk e-mail,
online hoaxes, common password scams, and virus-infection schemes.
Forewarned is forearmed (as opposed to being four-footed or something),
so read these pages carefully. Do your part to make the online world safe!

Spam, Spam Everywhere 
and None of It to Eat
When it comes to bulk e-mail, I feel sorry for the Hormel company. Granted, I
feel sorry for everyone who deals with junk e-mail, but Hormel gets particular
sympathy. Somewhere in the Internet’s past, unsolicited commercial e-mail
(or UCE, as it’s officially known these days) earned the nickname spam. Thus,
Hormel’s unstoppable juggernaut of canned cuisine innocently became the
mascot of e-mail frustration.
No matter what you call it — spam, bulk e-mail, UCE, or digital trash — the
stuff pops unbidden into your mailbox. The advertisements run the gamut
from questionable penny-stock tips to discount long-distance phone cards,
plus everything you can imagine in between.
You can’t completely stop junk e-mail without blocking your mailbox from
most of the digital world (although some days, that option certainly sounds
tempting), but you can slow the deluge down to a mere trickle. By combining
the following tips with the powerful spam-fighting tools built into America
Online 9.0 (covered later in this chapter), precious few spam messages can
evade detection and — best of all — deletion. Here’s what to do:
 If the message includes removal instructions, ignore them. Being the
ever-idealistic Midwesterner, I originally suggested at least trying the
removal instructions. Thousands of junk mails later, I changed my mind.
Spammers are notorious for ignoring removal requests or (worse) using
your reply as the basis for a new round of spamming.
 Register your e-mail address with the Direct Marketing Association’s 
E-mail Preference Service. This service represents at least a step in the
right direction. Sure, it works only for companies that belong to the
Direct Marketing Association, but at least it’s a beginning. To register,
just go to www.dmaconsumers.org/consumerassistance.html, and
then click the How to get your name off e-mail lists link. The system
accepts up to three e-mail addresses at a time. When the E-mail
Preference Service sends you a follow-up notice through e-mail, use 
the link in the message to activate your removal listing.
 Although we can’t stop bulk e-mail altogether (the Internet is, after all, an
international thing), we can outlaw its use by United States–based com-
panies. Contact your representatives in Washington and let them know
how you feel. The My Government area (keyword My Government) helps
you find your congressional representatives, send e-mail to them, and
track their voting records.
50
Part I: Driver’s Ed for the Digital Traveler 

 Congress responds best when besieged by large numbers of people, so
the folks at the Spam Recycling Center (www.spamrecycle.com) collect
unsolicited commercial e-mail and forward it all to your elected officials
in Washington. Check the Web site for the Spam Recycling Center’s for-
warding address and other special instructions. (By the way, its service
costs nothing — the people who run it just hate spam.)
 If you receive junk e-mail that advertises a pyramid scheme, an illegal
product, a lottery, or other such things and uses a good, old-fashioned
postal address for replies, forward the message to the United States
Postal Inspection Service (www.usps.com/postalinspectors), the law
enforcement branch of the United States Postal Service.
 Living in Canada already has its plusses (it’s one heckuva beautiful coun-
try, eh?), but when dealing with spam, the Canadians are really ahead of
the game. Spam is illegal in Canada, so if you live on the northern end of
the continent, send your spam complaints to the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police (www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca). 
Despite the fact that spammers want you to think that their activities are
legal and aboveboard, as I write this book, no national laws regulate bulk
e-mail. Although Congress took a few tentative steps toward those controls,
in the end, members just talked a lot and stopped far short of any real action
(a typical Washington maneuver). Numerous individual states already passed
anti-spam laws, so check with your State Attorney General’s office to find out
how things work where you live.
Canning Spam with AOL 9.0
Great news! After our many years of sighing, grumbling, and grousing, the
America Online developers finally heard our collective cries. AOL 9.0 gives
members their first real weapons to fight junk e-mail. The America Online 9.0
anti-spam arsenal pairs up some old friends (the Address Book, Buddy List,
and Mailbox window) with a hefty new recruit — namely the Mail and Spam
Controls (keyword Spam Controls) that puts you in charge of your mailbox.
The Address Book, Buddy List, 
and Show Me Mail From tool 
The junk-mail counterattack begins in your Address Book and Buddy List. If
you never used the AOL Address Book before, start now! Store e-mail
addresses for everybody you know and regularly correspond with in the
Address Book. Why? Because the new sorting tools treat the Address Book
(and your Buddy List) as a master list of people you want to get mail from.
51
Chapter 4: Dealing with Spams, Scams, Viruses, and Hoaxes

With your Address Book armed and ready, turn your attention to your e-mail
inbox. There, AOL 9.0’s Show Me Mail From tool organizes your messages
based on who sent them, and all with a single click. On the Online Mailbox
window, click the Show Me Mail From drop-down list. The software offers five
display options, outlined in Table 4-1. 
Table 4-1

Everybody — every message the mailbox contains

Unknown senders
Messages without any sender information — 99.9% spam
All related mail
All e-mails sent on the same date, with the same subject, or 
from the same person as the message highlighted in the 
mailbox
Each message also gets marked with a distinct icon, making scanning mes-
sages easy. Mail from people you know earns a plain white envelope icon,
bulk mail looks like a package wrapped in brown paper, and messages from
everybody else show up as a manila-colored envelope.
To make the most of the mail-sorting tools, keep your Address Book entries
up to date! Otherwise, you might miss messages that you really want to see
when the software accidentally sorts them into the wrong stack. Oops.
The spam controls
Now that the old tools are in place and operating smoothly, turn your atten-
tion to the AOL Advanced Spam Filter and the other Mail and Spam Controls
behind keyword Spam Controls. With this group of goodies, America Online
9.0 definitely kicks the anti-spam battle up a notch. Now, it’s all-out war.
The biggest anti-spam tool works automatically, behind the scenes. Your per-
sonalized Advanced Spam Filter scrutinizes every single message that comes
into your mailbox. If something looks like junk e-mail, the Advanced Spam
Filter puts the message into the Spam Folder. Best of all, the filter doesn’t just
rely on other people’s judgment — it actually learns what you consider junk
e-mail. That’s where the filter’s partner, the Report Spam button (near the
bottom of the mailbox window), comes into play.
52
Part I: Driver’s Ed for the Digital Traveler 

If some junk e-mail finds its way into your mailbox despite all of your precau-
tions, use the message to train America Online 9.0’s custom spam filter.
Highlight the message by clicking it once in the mailbox list and then click the
happy little Report Spam button. The message immediately disappears from
your mailbox, and the Advanced Spam Filter makes some notes about it
(including the subject, sender, and other highly technical tidbits). The next
time a message like this one arrives, your personalized filter automatically
shoves it into the Spam Folder instead of dropping it into your mailbox.
To see the messages that the filter didn’t like, click the Spam Folder link in the
lower-left corner of the mailbox window. That shifts the mailbox view around
a bit, taking you to the Manage Mail tab and the Spam folder therein. Most of
the time, you can use the Delete All button to dump all the dead junk mail out
of your world. If the filter accidentally sends a good e-mail message here, give
the filter another lesson by highlighting the message and clicking the This Is
Not Spam button. That moves the message back into your regular mailbox and
clears the incorrect filter settings that caused the problem in the first place.
You can tighten up things even more with the settings in the Mail and Spam
Controls window, shown in Figure 4-1 (keyword Spam Controls). The settings
in here include controls on who you accept mail from, what your spam filter
does with blocked mail (send it to the Spam folder or just delete it), and
whether or not you want to use the Advanced Spam Filter. You also can
banish all messages containing clickable hyperlinks and any messages con-
taining certain words that you list.

Chapter 4: Dealing with Spams, Scams, Viruses, and Hoaxes

Focus your spam-fighting efforts on teaching the Advanced Spam Filter its
job. The more messages that you kill with the Report Spam button (and save
with the This Is Not Spam button), the sharper your filters get. Unless you
really, really, really hate junk e-mail and don’t mind deleting a few valid mes-
sages as the cost of your crusade, don’t go overboard on the blocking set-
tings in the dialog box. Instead, let the Advanced Spam Filter do its thing.
Fooling the Bulk Mail Behemoth
Unless you move into the online equivalent of a cave in the hills, you can’t
completely stop bulk e-mail from dumping into your mailbox. But you can cut
the flow from a torrent to a trickle.
The following sections provide two hands-on ways to protect your mailbox.
Because they protect different parts of your online experience, feel free to
apply both ideas to your America Online screen names.
Make a screen name especially 
for chatting
Chatting adds community to the often cold online world. Unfortunately, chat-
ting also leads to a jam-packed e-mail inbox because spammers spend a lot of
time gathering screen names from chat-room lists (even though it’s against
America Online’s rules). Protect yourself with a simple technique — make a
chat room screen name.
Now that America Online gives you seven screen names per account (and 16
characters in each screen name), you have plenty of space for an extra iden-
tity or two. Granted, you need to tell your friends about the new you, but it’s
a small price to pay for less junk mail in your mailbox. Here’s what to do:
1. First, choose a new name for your chat identity and create the screen
name.
If people already know you in the chat rooms, use a variation of your
current name with chat, chats, or something like that attached to the
end (such as JKaufeldChats).
For help creating a new screen name, flip ahead to Chapter 6.
2. Set the mail controls for the new screen name to block all e-mail.
This step holds the big key for mailbox protection because it kills the
spammer’s main tool. Your chat screen name isn’t any good to them,
54
Part I: Driver’s Ed for the Digital Traveler 

because all the incoming mail bounces off the closed mailbox door.
(Don’t worry — both your friends and folks you meet in chat rooms can
still send you mail. Read on to find the secret!)
To dive straight into the controls, visit keyword Mail Controls. For more
detail, visit Chapter 7. It offers the lowdown on the mail controls, plus
lots more.
3. Build a member profile for the chat screen name. In the profile, tell
people to send e-mail to your regular screen name.
Because the spammer’s name-gathering software doesn’t intelligently read
profiles, your other screen name is protected while you chat the night
away. For more information on member profiles, check out Chapter 6.
Protect your e-mail address in 
Internet newsgroup postings
Use the newsgroup preferences to add some extra text to the end of your
e-mail address, turning it from an innocent address such as jkaufeld@
aol.com into jkaufeld@aol.comkillallspam (which is both an incorrect
e-mail address and a heartfelt personal expression concerning unsolicited
commercial e-mail). Putting this protection in place takes only a moment:
1. Open the Newsgroups window with keyword Newsgroups.
If all is well with the online world, the Newsgroups window appears. 
(If not, America Online’s computers don’t feel well right now.)
2. Click the Set Preferences button near the bottom of the window.
This displays the Global Newsgroup Preferences, a somewhat imposing
window with three tabbed pages.
3. Click the Posting tab.
A new set of preferences hops onto the screen, including the one you
want.
4. Click in the text area next to the Junk Block heading, and then type
something like nospam or nojunk. After you finish, click the Save
button.
With that setting in place, every time you create an Internet newsgroup
message, America Online automatically adds whatever text you typed
(the nospam or nojunk thing) to the end of your e-mail address (because
every message includes your address automatically).
55
Chapter 4: Dealing with Spams, Scams, Viruses, and Hoaxes

What If You Just Gave Your 
Password to Someone?
If you just gave someone your password, don’t panic — these things happen.
Go to keyword Password and then change your password to something new
and different. It takes only a moment.
The best passwords include a combination of letters and numbers, so try
things like blue17hat or trainfun47. Don’t make your password obvious
(even if it’s easy to remember). Never use things such as your name, your
phone number, the word password, or a simple sequence such as 123456,
ASDFJKL, or 000000.
America Online never handles password problems through e-mail or instant
messages. The real America Online customer service folks don’t know your
password (it’s encrypted and stored in the big computers at AOL-land), they
won’t ask for your password (especially not for personal identification), and
they don’t want to know your password if you change it. For that matter, they
don’t want your credit card number, either (well, they may want it, but that’s
another issue).
If Someone Asks for Your 
Password, Just Say “No”
Someone asking for your password ranks as one of the oldest scams in the
online world, but it catches people every day. The password scam comes in a
variety of flavors, but the bottom line remains the same: The scammer wants
your account password and will lie, cheat, and use any trick he can to get it.
Regardless of the particular scam’s details, some basics always stay the
same. For instance, they always ask for your password (granted, some vari-
ants ask for your credit card number, but the thought remains the same).
Regardless of the approach, your reply never changes! If you get an instant
message or e-mail asking for your password, credit card number, or other
personal information, do not fall for the trap — don’t give out your information.
The message is a scam.
Defeating instant message scams
Instant message scams are the easiest to recognize and avoid. No company in
the world — not America Online, American Express, AT&T, MasterCard, Visa,
56
Part I: Driver’s Ed for the Digital Traveler 

or anyone else — will send you an instant message asking for account informa-
tion, credit card numbers, or passwords. They just don’t do business that way.
Ever. (That kinda simplifies sorting out the real messages from the scams.)
If you get an instant message that asks for your America Online password,
credit card number, or any other personal information, click the Notify AOL
button in the message window. When the Notify AOL window pops up, briefly
explain that you think the attached message is a scam and click the Send
Report button. Congratulations — you just turned in the scammer!
When a scam appears on your screen while you’re in a chat room, take 
a moment to warn the chat room that a scammer is trying to get passwords.
After spreading the warning, use the Notify AOL button to ruin the 
scammer’s day.
Unmasking e-mail scams
Although some e-mail scams look pretty authentic, they’re still just a varia-
tion on the give me your password or I want your credit card number themes. If
you stick with the basic knowledge that no legitimate company in the world
asks for personal information unless you start the transaction, you’re on
pretty safe ground.
Some scammers try the high-tech approach to getting your password by
building imposter Web sites that borrow America Online’s own Web graphics
or service names (such as InstaKiss, AOL Mail, or Shop@AOL). Because they
still have to trick you into coughing up your screen name and password, the
scammers often create fake sites mimicking America Online’s actual pages at
americangreetings.com or aol.com (addresses that the scammers can’t
fake). Other scam messages promote fictional contests allegedly sponsored
by America Online or another well-known business, which “require” a screen
name and password for the contest entry.
A new e-mail scam — arriving just in time for the busy holiday shopping
season — involves fake online shopping invoices. Figure 4-2 shows a live
sample that recently arrived in my mailbox. Here’s the scam: You receive an
e-mail message recounting a recent online order that you allegedly placed,
usually for something around $100. In addition to the fake order information,
the message also includes a cancel this order link. Clicking the cancellation
link whisks you away to the scammer’s Web site, which (in the name of
ending the imaginary order) collects a full set of information about you,
including your America Online screen name and password, plus a credit card
number and street address. Whoops.
57
Chapter 4: Dealing with Spams, Scams, Viruses, and Hoaxes

No matter how genuine something looks, remember the basics: America
Online won’t ask for your password, street address, credit card number, or
any other information through e-mail or an instant message. And if they do
throw a contest, you never have to give your account password or credit card
number to submit an entry.

How did they find my screen name?
You can run, but you can’t hide — no matter how
hard you try, they seem to always find your
screen name. The next thing you know, the
e-mailbox bulges from all the junk. But how did
they get your address in the first place?
This happens in two ways. The lazy spammers
(which sounds somewhat redundant now that I
think about it) just blast out millions of messages.
They don’t even try to find your address — they
simply start with a@aol.com and keep going until
they get to zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz@aol.com. 
Other spammers actively harvest addresses
from chat rooms, message boards, Internet
newsgroups, and even online classified ads!
With the names in hand, they start the box-filling
flow of messages that you and I struggle with
today. For tips about beating these spammers at
their own game, flip ahead to the end of the
chapter.

Here’s how to tell the real thing from the wrong thing every time:
 To visit a real America Online–based area, you use a keyword such as
Shop@AOL or a Web site attached to the aol.com domain. You can’t
accidentally visit a fake online area through an America Online keyword,
because scammers can’t fake a keyword. They also can’t fake the
aol.com domain because America Online guards it closely. On the other
hand, anyone can put a fake link in an e-mail message. The moral of the
story: If you don’t know who sent a message, don’t click any links in it.
 If you visit a suspicious Web site, look carefully at the address displayed
in the navigation bar. Genuine America Online services never display a
computer’s numeric address (such as 65.61.162.226). They also never
use free Web-hosting services such as 50Megs (www.50megs.com),
Fortune City (www.fortunecity.com), Freeservers.com (www.free
servers.com), HyperMart (www.hypermart.com), or Tripod (www.
tripod.com) for its information areas. Instead, it uses the aol.com
servers, or servers belonging to its partners, such as CNET (www.cnet.
com), J.C. Penney (www.jcpenney.com), The New York Times (www.ny
times.com), and the Time Warner companies (www.pathfinder.com).
When you receive an e-mail scam, forward the message to screen name
TOSEmail1 (that’s TOSEMAIL with the number 1 attached to the end). The
friendly folks at America Online’s Community Action Team love getting e-mail
like that.
Viruses Come in the Darnedest Packages
Despite their best efforts, healthy people sometimes come down with a
common cold. They drink the right fluids, eat the best foods, and get plenty
of sleep, but the cold still sneaks up and bites them. I guess it’s just life’s way
of saying it’s time to read those new For Dummies books that you bought last
month.
Computer viruses behave the same way, but taking the right precautions dra-
matically improves the odds of keeping your computer healthy. And what
precautions might those be? I’m glad you asked:
 Don’t download files attached to e-mails from people you don’t know.
This is Cardinal Rule #1 of safe computing. Hackers often distribute
password-stealing programs in e-mails with a friendly message like Had
fun chatting with you in the room last night. Here are the
59
Chapter 4: Dealing with Spams, Scams, Viruses, and Hoaxes

pictures I promised! This message seems innocent on the surface
(except to your significant other), but it hides a nefarious plot. If you
don’t readily recognize the screen name sending the file to you, don’t
download the file.
 Don’t trust filenames. Anyone can name a destructive file fungame.exe,
screensav.exe, or coolpic.exe to camouflage its purpose. (After all,
no hacker names something infectyoursystem.exe.) If you receive a
file like that attached to an e-mail message, refer to the preceding para-
graph. Do you know the sender? If not, don’t download the file.
 Watch out for suspicious file extensions. The file extension is the last
part of a filename (the part after the period). Never, never, never down-
load a file with the .shs, .scr, or .pif extension (especially if the name
looks like kittenpix.jpg.shs). Ninety-nine times out of fifty, it’s a
virus. Unless you know what you’re doing and why you’re doing it, don’t
download files ending in .reg. Those files tweak a very important part
of Windows known as the Registry, which you don’t adjust too often.
Normal files have extensions such as .exe, .com, .zip, .jpg, and .bmp
(although program files — the .exe and .com files — often harbor
viruses, too). If you get a file that you don’t recognize, go back to the
first item in this section: If you don’t know the sender, it’s probably a
virus or hacker program.
What if you think the computer already caught a virus? In that case, you need
some digital medicine. Visit keyword Virus for virus-killing steps and antivirus
software. If you don’t want to tangle with the virus by yourself, coax one of
your local computer-savvy friends into helping you (free food makes a great
bribe, by the way).
Recognizing Hoaxes: No, Bill Gates
Won’t Give You $5,000
The Internet hosts more hoaxes than the Candid Camera show crossed with
the National Enquirer. Free money. Stolen kidneys. Expensive cookie recipes.
Modem taxes. Worldwide Internet cleanup day. Free beer. Dying children
longing to perch atop mountains of greeting cards. They all sound soooooo
good, but despite a tiny grounding in reality (or simply a plausible concept),
they’re all classic Internet hoaxes.
When it comes to hoaxes, P.T. Barnum probably said it best: “Get that mule
cart off my foot!” (Oh, drat — wrong quote.) Mr. Barnum’s correct quote has
to do with the way that a good story encourages people to suspend their dis-
belief and join in the fun, which is precisely what happens when an Internet
hoax wanders into your mailbox. (Ol’ P.T. phrased it a bit differently, but the
concept remains the same.)
60
Part I: Driver’s Ed for the Digital Traveler 

Rather than getting blindly sucked into a hoax, take a moment to mentally
challenge the information in the message for yourself. Like the various scams
discussed earlier in the chapter, Internet hoaxes follow a distinct pattern.
After you know the pattern, picking out the hoaxes is easy. Here goes:
 Free money or products thanks to an e-mail tracking system. This one
shows up quite a lot, promising thousands of dollars or free goodies to
everyone who forwards the message to their friends. The message guar-
antees the reward thanks to an e-mail tracking system, which monitors
every move the message makes. Reality check: There’s no such thing as
an e-mail tracking system, and if there was one, the privacy advocates
would have collective heart failure over it. Besides, neither Bill Gates
nor Walt Disney, Jr. really wants to give you $5,000.
 Strong statements from vague sources. Many popular hoaxes rely on
official-sounding statements attributed to police (“The Denver police
report that . . .”) or highly placed government officials. Unfortunately,
you can’t check on the details of the message because, well, it’s not
detailed enough. Reality check: Look at the Web sites of any groups men-
tioned in the message. Sometimes, the groups in question offer pages of
information debunking various hoaxes.
 Send this to all of your friends. Whether the hoaxes are spooky or sane,
timely or timeless, they all request the same Pavlovian behavior: Send
the message immediately to everyone you know. The message’s accu-
racy isn’t the point — quick movement of this “important information”
obviously outweighs little trivialities such as whether the whole thing is
correct. Reality check: Little if any information really needs immediate
delivery. Hoaxes count on immediacy because it interferes with
research. When hoaxes hit your mailbox, sit on them for a few days
before shooting a message back (er, replying to the sender).
For some great hoax-debunking resources, visit the CIAC Hoaxbusters page,
at hoaxbusters.ciac.org. This great collection of Internet hoax resources
covers just about every e-mail hoax that ever crossed the Net. (In case you
wondered, the CIAC is part of the U.S. Department of Energy. The CIAC origi-
nally created the Hoaxbusters page for its own, internal use, but over time,
people all over the Internet grew to use it.)
When debunking a hoax, be kind. Reply to both the person who sent the
message to you and everyone who received it from your friend. Give a quick
explanation that the hoax is, in fact, false, and that they shouldn’t bother for-
warding it to anyone else. Use the Favorite Places tool to put clickable links
into your e-mail message so that people can read the truth for themselves.

Making Your Preferences Known
In This Chapter
 Discovering what the preferences do
 Finding the elusive little things
 A romp through the essential settings
A
new America Online account looks like a college dorm room on the first
day of school: completely bare — devoid of anything beyond the institu-
tional necessities of lime-green cinder blocks and gray linoleum. As the new
residents move in, they put a distinct face on the nondescript space and
make it uniquely their own.
Making yourself at home on America Online means setting things up just the
way you want them — and that’s what this chapter is all about. It covers the
extensive America Online Settings area, exploring useful, helpful, and valuable
preference settings, while steering you clear of odd, esoteric, and nerdy ones.
If you’re completely new to America Online, spend some time messing
around with the service before digging deeply into this chapter. Several pref-
erences (particularly the ones for mail and Web access) make a lot more
sense after using America Online for a while.
This chapter concentrates on the settings that AOL deems essential (as evi-
denced by their presence on the Essentials tab of the Settings window). If you
want details about creating screen names and online profiles, see Chapter 6.
If you need guidance setting the Parental Controls, flip ahead to Chapter 7.
What Preferences Do, Where They Live,
and Why You Care
The preference settings tweak the special America Online software so that it
behaves exactly the way you want. (No, you can’t install preference settings
in your kids — I tried, but it didn’t work.) The options cover every aspect of

your time with America Online, from sign-on to sign-off, plus a bunch of stuff
in between. Best of all, America Online remembers your preference settings
from session to session, but you can change them whenever you want. 
Bring up the new preferences window with keyword Settings. The Settings
window (shown in Figure 5-1) immediately hops into action, displaying all of
the options inside the window’s Essentials tab. 
Displaying the what tab? The Settings window comes with tabs? Yes, you heard
it here first. Instead of deluging you with every setting in a single whopping
list, the new Settings window splits up things among three tabs: Essentials, By
Category, and A-Z. All of the settings appear alphabetically under each tab.
Why the change? Frankly, because a lot of customization options were scat-
tered around the system, and they needed a nice, simple, single home.
Managing Your Personal Info 
and Online Personality
Maintaining your America Online account means more than regularly sweep-
ing around your computer and dusting your modem. Perhaps you need to
update your billing information or perhaps add some new information to
your online profile. When it comes to your personal AOL settings and billing
information, these settings take care of you.
Figure 5-1:
The Settings
window, in
its option-
filled glory.

Part II: Settling Into Your Online Home 

About Me (keyword About Me)
Tired of letting the America Online programmers choose the color scheme 
of your instant messages and your AOL Desktop? Want to put some visual
kick into your member profile? Ever consider starting a Web home page of
your own? You can do all of that with a visit to the settings inside About Me,
the first item under the Essentials tab. It’s like a one-stop shop for online
personalization!
The About Me settings window (displayed in Figure 5-2) cover four specific
areas: Member Profile, Home Page, Expressions, and the very broad Text and
Formatting. The first three lead to specific keyword areas, namely My Profile,
Homepage, and My Expressions. These help you customize the information
others see about you in both your profile and your Web home page. The
Expressions settings adjust the way you interact with your AOL software and
the way it interacts with other people through instant messages.
The last option, Text and Formatting, covers a lot more ground than the others.
It changes how your screen name appears in other people’s Buddy Lists, lets
you pick a new font for chatting and instant messages, and points you to the
personalization options for signatures on both e-mail and discussion boards. 
Billing Center (keyword Billing)
Nobody really likes to think about bills (except, of course, the people who
sent them to you). Still, keeping abreast of your account settings and
payment options makes a lot of sense. That’s why America Online created 
its online Billing Center and added a link for it to the Settings window.

Chapter 5: Making Your Preferences Known

Regardless of what you want to know about the financial side of your
America Online account, the Billing Center puts it at your fingertips. Through
the options in here, you can change your billing method, pricing plan, con-
tact information, and even your super-secret account security question. The
window also includes several buttons dedicated to viewing your current and
past bills, and for getting help with any billing questions.
In addition to a searchable help screen packed with lots of ready-to-read help
options, the Billing Center window also includes a Free Live Billing Help link
near the bottom. This option works wonderfully for those odd questions or any
time you just need a human’s opinion about your account. To use the option,
just click the link near the bottom of the window. After a moment, the software
brings up the Live Billing Support system. From there, follow the on-screen
instructions, and you’ll have an answer to your question in just a few moments.
Controlling How AOL Looks to You 
There’s nothing like remodeling (and I do mean nothing). A dab of paint here,
some wallpaper there, a new deck out back, and pretty soon your house falls
down and your marriage hits the rocks. Luckily, doing a little touch-up work
on your America Online software won’t imperil your home or loved ones.
Start-up Settings (keyword 
Start-up Settings)
This option joins your software for the first time in America Online 9.0. It’s
such a simple and powerful window that you may wonder why the program-
mers didn’t think of it earlier. (Goodness knows the thought crossed my
mind.)
The little Start-up Settings window doesn’t include a lot of options. In fact, it
only offers two. The first set of radio buttons asks whether you want to see
the Welcome window or the customizable My AOL QuickView window when
you sign on to the system. 
The second set of buttons offers to open one additional window automati-
cally when you sign on. In a real departure from AOL’s traditional benevolent
dictator approach to user-customizable options, the Start-up Settings window
actually lets you enter any AOL keyword or Internet URL into the Additional
Windows setting. Thus, if you always start the day with a rousing game of
Cribbage in the AOL Games area (or pretty much anywhere on the Net), you
can enter the keyword or URL of your Cribbage game right here. After that,
every time you sign on to America Online, your game awaits you automati-
cally. (If this negatively impacts your productivity, don’t blame me.)

Toolbar Settings
When it comes to the toolbar across the top of your America Online 9.0 soft-
ware, there’s more there than meets the mouse. Sure, you can drag and drop
those little Favorite Place hearts into the highlighted area of the toolbar to
create your own buttons, but I’m talking about even more than that. There’s a
whole new level of customization and tweaks that you only discover by going
deep into the Toolbar Settings window.
The Toolbar Settings window leads with one of its most useful features — 
the ability to show only text labels on the toolbar. By getting rid of the pretty
little pictures, you recapture quite a swath of on-screen real estate without
making the software harder to use at all. If that interests you, click the Text
Only radio button in the General Toolbar section.
Those other settings in the General Toolbar section govern how the naviga-
tion arrows (the right and left arrows on the navigation bar) work and how
your AOL software uses the big History Trail (also in the navigation bar).
Most of the time, I leave the other settings off, although sometimes the Auto-
Complete AOL Keywords and Web Addresses setting saves me a little typing.
Lots of people want to know about the big Clear History Trail Now button.
This useful tool does exactly what it says — it wipes out the entries in the
History Trail, that drop-down text box that takes up almost all of the naviga-
tion bar. If you ever want to clean up the mess in the History Trail, just come
to this window and click that button!
The final options in the window include a pair of links for customizing your
toolbar color scheme (which the programmers call the Toolbar Theme) and
customizing the Toolbar Menus (which doesn’t really mean that at all — it
lets you customize areas contained in the main menu, not the toolbar). For
information about customizing these menus, turn to Chapter 21. The Toolbar
QuickView section allows you to adjust how fast the QuickView pop-ups do
their little appearing/disappearing trick. Unless you really, really feel the need
to change that, just ignore the settings and go on with more fun things.
Welcome Screen Settings (keyword
Change My Welcome Screen)
The final option, alphabetically condemned to the dismal lower reaches of
the Settings menu, helps you put a new face onto the Welcome window.
Because all the faces look basically the same, the exercise feels a little like
putting a new face on mime — something changed, but you can’t quite tell
what, and the subject of the change isn’t talking.
69
Chapter 5: Making Your Preferences Known

Changing your Welcome window only requires a couple of clicks. After going
into this window, click the radio button next to one of the eight options. None
of these windows cost anything extra, so feel free to switch and swap as you
wish. After making your selection, click the big Next Step button.
The next window offers you a selection of stories and features to fill in the
main section of your window. All of the options include the top headlines
(you just can’t escape the news), but they each mix something a little diff-
erent in as well. Like the options on the first window, just pick something the
first time and then go back and change it later. You may as well indulge your-
self! When you finish, click the Next Step button one more time.
This final screen recaps your choices, reminds you how to get back here in
the future, and (strangely) offers to let you tell the software what to call you.
(I’m not sure that I want my software to know me on a first-name basis. After
all, we just met.) To lock in your changes, click Finish.
Communicating and Exploring Online
If you use America Online the way I do, then neither of us has a tan — but
that’s beside the point. You probably spend a lot of time sending and recei-
ving e-mail, cruising the Web, and interacting with your online friends and
acquaintances. Behind all of those tools, you find a plethora of settings, and
they’re all described below for your convenience.
Mail Settings
From a simple what it does for you perspective, e-mail rates as one of the
most useful features of America Online. After adding a few well-chosen set-
tings in the Mail Preferences window, the useful feature turns into a friendly
giant — the high-energy superpower of your online world!
The Mail Settings window includes two tabbed pages: General and Advanced.
The General page covers basic settings, including warnings when opening
mail with pictures, whether your AOL software automatically stores copies of
your incoming and outgoing messages, and the always-annoying Confirm
That Mail Has Been Sent option. The newest option, Hide Images and Disable
Links in Mail From Unknown Senders, lives at the bottom of the General tab.
By default, this setting is on. If this protective behavior drives you nuts, turn
it off by clearing the check box.
70
Part II: Settling Into Your Online Home 

The other tab, Advanced, really should be called the Settings You Don’t
Really Care About Changing tab. This page involves stuff like whether your
AOL software automatically displays the geeky mail header information when
you read messages from the Internet, and if the software offers a bunch of
picture quality options when you add an image to an e-mail message. Still,
take a spin through the items on this tab to see if any of them catch your
fancy. You never know!
Buddy List (keyword Buddy List Setup)
Every day, I find another friend, business associate, or even family member
who uses America Online. Thank goodness the programmers developed the
Buddy List to help keep track of everybody! Of course, any useful tool
requires some kind of set up and control system, and that’s where the Buddy
List setting enters the fray.
When you click the Buddy List item in the Settings window, America Online
serves up the same window that you get from the Setup button at the bottom
of the Buddy List itself. The Buddy List Setup window mainly exists to
manage your Buddy List groups, as well as the screen name entries in those
groups, but it offers a few other amenities, too.
As an extra added service, the window offers one-click links to the Instant
Message Expressions area, the Member Directory (in case you can’t remem-
ber how your friend spells her screen name), the Mobile IM settings that for-
ward instant messages to your SMS-capable mobile phone, and the Instant
Message settings tab inside the bigger Buddy List Settings window (at key-
word Buddy List Settings). 
For more about the whole Buddy List thing, flip over to Chapter 9.
Internet (Web) Properties 
Although most of the stuff in the Internet Properties area looks like techno-
weenie gobbledygook that fits between advanced carburetor settings and
amazing tricks you can do at home with expensive lab equipment, three useful
settings stand out from the rest: the Delete Files button on the General Tab,
the Web Graphics section on the AOL Browser tab, and the Shopping
Assistant tab, in its questionable glory.
71
Chapter 5: Making Your Preferences Known

Although the Delete Files button isn’t really a preference setting, you should
click this button every month or so if you enjoy surfing the Web. Every time
you view a Web page, the America Online Web browser keeps a local copy of
what you see in a cache — a temporary storage area used by the program —
in a particular folder on your computer.
Storing information in a cache isn’t a nefarious plot to use up your hard drive
space — all the popular Web browsers do it. On the plus side, the cache
makes your Web browser respond faster when you’re bouncing back and forth
between a few Web pages. The downside, though, is that the cache fills up
after a while. Unfortunately, a full cache slows down your Web browser a bit
(which is precisely the kind of help the World Wide Wait doesn’t exactly need).
Don’t use the Delete Files button unless your schedule calls for nothing more
pressing than a bathroom break during the coming few minutes. Depending on
when you last cleaned up everything, deleting the temporary files on your com-
puter may take two to ten minutes or even more. During that time, the AOL
software goes on a little hiatus and won’t respond to you. Just be patient — as
long as the hard drive activity light keeps blinking and you hear the drive work-
ing away in there, your computer is just fine. When the cleanup is finished,
your AOL software pops right into normal (if not faster) operation once more.
Graphics make the Web work, but thanks to their size they also slow things
down significantly. To make things work as quickly as possible, the America
Online software automatically compresses graphics files whenever it can.
Unfortunately, compression gives Web graphics a somewhat fuzzy look, as if
your monitor needs some serious adjustment or your eyeglasses suddenly
went out of whack.
Although members connecting to America Online through low-speed systems
(such as a standard phone line) need all the speed help they can get, people
using high-speed systems want their graphics looking swell. As a compromise,
the in-house software developers included the Web Graphics section of the
AOL Browser tab, which lets you tell America Online whether you want it to
smoosh your Web graphics files. 
By default, the software uses the Compress Graphics Only When I Do Not Have
a Broadband Connection to AOL setting (which sounds a bit like some geeky
country song). Because this option keeps things moving while also watching
for those slow-connection moments, I suggest leaving the setting alone.
The last important item in here is the Shopping Assistant tab. Shopping
Assistant itself is not what’s important here (in terms of usefulness, the
Shopping Assistant ranks with the Gosh you’ve been online a long time,
wouldn’t you like to leave? dialog box that plagued America Online users for
years). Instead, the important feature is the little check box that turns off the
Shopping Assistant forever. Just click the Shopping Assistant tab, click the
72
Part II: Settling Into Your Online Home 

View the Shopping Assistant check box to remove the check mark, and then
smile really big because the nasty Shopping Assistant won’t darken your Web
browser again. Now there’s a reason to sing! (But I’ll spare you my rendition
of Born Free.)
Guarding Your Safety and Privacy
For all of the good it does connecting us to each other, sometimes you feel
just a little too connected for your own good. Maybe you wonder who your
children spend their time chatting with, or why someone with a screen name
you never saw before just sent you an instant message suggesting that cer-
tain aspects of your life would be better (or at least bigger) with the right
medication.
Unlike the vanilla Internet Service Providers of the world, America Online
puts some serious teeth into its privacy and safety options. The following set-
tings help protect both you and your children from the odd, the strange, and
many other online peculiarities.
IM Privacy (keyword Privacy Settings)
Sometimes, you want to talk to the world. Other times, you just want the world
to curl up in a little ball and throw itself off a very tall building into a very deep
hole. Whatever your current feeling, the IM Privacy settings offer you some
very definite ways to either welcome everyone or send them all packing.
However, there’s a disappointing twist to this happy tale. The IM Privacy link
actually doesn’t immediately lead to the IM Privacy settings. Instead, it goes
to the General IM tab of the Buddy List Settings window at keyword IM
Settings. The items on this tab don’t help or hinder your privacy at all.
Granted, they do all kinds of useful things relating to your instant message
experience, but privacy isn’t among them. Although I fully expect the AOL
programmers to remedy this misdirection at some point, it’s worth mention-
ing in case the repair paperwork gets lost under something on their desks.
In any case, I highly recommend spending some time on the General IM tab
anyway, particularly if you spend a lot of time sending and receiving instant
messages. Now, going back to the thought that launched this crazy excursion,
if you want to get to the IM privacy settings (as the IM Privacy link promised
originally), click the Privacy and Security tab, which you find across the top
of this same Buddy List Settings window. Figure 5-3 shows off the target. You
can also go straight to the right place through keyword Privacy Settings.
73
Chapter 5: Making Your Preferences Known

This rather imposing-looking window of options helps you dictate exactly
who can interact with you through both instant messages and the Buddy List
system. Your options in here cover both instant message privacy and instant
message security. 
On the privacy side of the fence, you can tell AOL who you want to interact
with online. The default is the Show All setting, which, as you may expect,
means everybody who uses AOL, CompuServe, Wal-Mart Connect, or AIM —
and that’s a lot of people. To trim down the allowable list a bit, choose one of
the other privacy options such as the Allow Only People on my Buddy List 
or Block Only These Users setting. The security options govern what hap-
pens when you interact with people using AIM (AOL Instant Messenger) via
the Internet and when you create a direct connection through the IM system
(trading photos and files, talking, or sending video streams).
For the complete story about putting the privacy options to work for you, see
the privacy section in Chapter 9.

Hitting the highlights in one easy step
When you’re new to America Online, the
options get a bit overwhelming. You have so
many things to choose from — where should
you begin? What should you change first?
In an effort to reduce your stress and make the
settling-in process slightly simpler, America
Online collected the most-used goodies
together in the cool Preferences Help area (key-
word Preferences Help). With an exhaustive
topic list and lots of descriptive instructions, this
window leads you through the most popular
account changes. You can adjust all of the
important settings, change your screen names,
fiddle with your member profile, and assemble
the Parental Controls (see Chapter 7 for details
about all of those things), as well as mess with
Buddy Lists (more about that in Chapter 9), per-
sonalize your instant message settings, and
much more.

Parental Controls (keyword 
Parental Controls)
Who needs to join the Navy to find adventure? Just have a couple of kids, and
the adventure finds you — in fact, it moves in with you and demands food,
entertainment, and shelter on a daily basis! Seriously, the task of protecting
your kids online truly takes parenting into a brave new world. The America
Online programmers understand the challenge, and they created an amazing
basket of tools to help parents build a good defense against the odd, bizarre,
and just plain demented junk that lurks in the dim recesses of the online world.
Through the AOL Parental Controls, you can limit the amount of time your
child spends online, and set specific access hours when the online world is
open to him or her (or, more to the point, closed). The new AOL Guardian
takes notes on the Web sites they go to and the people they trade messages
with, and then securely reports that information straight back to your AOL
screen name. And that’s just the beginning! The mail controls, Web controls,
newsgroup controls, and many other controls truly let you customize your
child’s online experience in a way no other service provides.
Because the Parental Controls offer so many options in the new 9.0 software,
this book contains a whole chapter devoted to fiddling with them. Head over
to Chapter 7 for a complete introduction to launching, guiding, and protect-
ing your kids as they venture into the Great Digital Unknown.
Pop-ups (keyword Pop-up Controls) 
Do you hate those annoying pop-up windows as much as I do? First, you have
the ones that appear when you sign on to AOL. Those drive me nuts. And
then you get the ones that appear like dandelions in the digital yard as you
innocently visit some random Web site! You probably just wanted to read the
news or something equally simple, but then {pop!} {pop!} {pop!} — your
screen fills with stupid banners, silly animations, and far too many if-this-box-
flashes-then-you’re-a-winner offers. Eeesh.
The AOL Pop-ups control puts a quick and easy stop to all of that pop-up
madness. To engage the pop-up shields, click the Pop-ups link in the Settings
window, and then click the Suppress Pop-ups from Web Sites I Visit Using
AOL Software check box. In one single click, you eliminate the vast majority
of the annoying Web pop-ups plaguing the world today.
After doing that, click once more in the Suppress AOL Member-Only Special
Offers check box near the bottom of the window. Yes, that rids your system of
the ads that appear just as you sign onto the system. It’s awfully sporting of
AOL to offer that option, so make sure you use it on your account.
75
Chapter 5: Making Your Preferences Known

Spam Controls (keyword Spam Controls)
Welcome. You have tons of junk mail! Aaaarrgh!! Although AOL’s behind-the-
scenes controls block (literally) millions of messages each day, millions more
slip through the cracks and land in your mailbox. (Or at least it feels that way
some days.)
America Online 9.0 introduced the new window full of spam-fighting good-
ness that appears when you click the Spam Controls link in the Settings list.
The options in here let you loosen or tighten the controls on your mailbox as
much as you like. Want to grant mailbox admission to only a few select
people? Select the Allow Mail Only from People I Know option. Would you
rather pick and choose, yet still receive things from the outside world? Apply
a Customer Sender List to your mailbox. Whatever level of protection you
want, you can probably get it with the Spam Controls. 
For a more in-depth explanation of the Spam Controls, visit Chapter 4. That
chapter explores how to combine your Address Book with the Spam Controls
to put a severe dent into your junk mail influx.

Chapter 6
Doing the Screen Name Tango
In This Chapter
 Figuring out the whole screen name thing
 Managing screen names
 Filling out your profile
O
ne of my favorite Internet-related cartoons shows a dog camped happily
in front of a computer, talking to another dog that just wandered into
the room. (I always thought it would be funnier with ocelots, but it probably
loses something in foreign translations.) The cartoon caption plays on the
anonymous nature of the online world through its pithy caption, “On the
Internet, nobody knows you’re a dog.”
The same idea carries directly into America Online. (The anonymity, that is,
not the dog/ocelot thing.) Everyone on America Online knows you by the
screen name you create and the information you put into your profile. That’s
why choosing the right screen name and filling out your online profile are
such big parts of your online experience.
But screen names represent more than your online identity. They also play
directly into the America Online Parental Controls system (covered in the
next chapter), which helps concerned and involved parents take charge of
their children’s online activities. Without the right screen-name setup, the
Parental Controls don’t do a bit of good.
This chapter guides you through the ins and outs of the whole who you are
and what you can do online thing. It starts with screen names, and then carries
on through the very cool (and newly updated) member profile system. It’s a
must-see chapter for your online world. (Heck, tell your friends about it, too!)

What’s in a (Screen) Name?
When you joined an online service in the Days of Online Past, you received an
account name mechanically generated by a computer. And this computer was
quite proud of itself for calling you 71303,3713. After all, the computer had
no problem remembering such a splendid name — why should you?
America Online was created by humans and designed for humans. As a direct
result, you (a human) get to choose the name you use on America Online. You
can be yourself if you want: Annie, Paul, Svengali. You can also be a little
more daring and become Homeschooler, Mungojerrie, or perhaps a strapping
Norseman such as Thar Drekskin. Within the bounds of good taste, the
choice is up to you (but more about that later).
Each America Online account includes space for seven screen names: one
primary name plus six others. The primary name is the one you chose when
you first joined America Online. This name is special — kind of like your per-
manent file in school (the mysterious record always spoken of in dark, terrify-
ing phrases such as “You realize, of course, that this incident will go into your
permanent file.”). Like that legendary file, the primary name is permanent —
you can’t change it, no matter how much you want to. The other six names,
however, can come and go as you please.
America Online places only a few limits on screen names. Screen names must
be between 3 and 16 characters long and must start with a letter. After the
required first letter, you can use letters, numbers, and spaces to create your
online identity. Also, the assembled numbers and letters can’t cross the line
into what Miss Manners might call “poor taste.” (For more about that, see the
“Now be nice!” sidebar in this chapter.)
78
Part II: Settling Into Your Online Home 
Now be nice!
A creative screen name is your tool for carving
out a unique identity in the world of America
Online. You’re supposed to be creative — that’s
the whole point. However, a subtle line sepa-
rates creative and obnoxious.
Here’s a simple guideline for creating a good
screen name: Make the name as creative as
you want, but if you blush at the idea of explain-
ing it to your children, parents, spouse, or sig-
nificant other, your screen name is probably
beyond the bounds of good taste.
One final thought about choosing a screen
name: Make it appropriate. A screen name for
official business e-mail looks a lot different than
one for a character in the Free Form Role
Playing (keyword RPG) area. If you want to 
be BoogerDggr in the chat rooms, that’s 
your choice, but your new e-mail address
(boogerdggr@aol.com) may look a little
funny on a business card.

Here’s a quick overview of the technical rules governing America Online
screen names:
 You can have seven screen names in your account — one primary
screen name and six others.
 The primary screen name is permanent; you can’t ever change it. You
can, however, create and delete the other six screen names at your
whim.
 By default, only the primary screen name can make new screen names
and adjust Parental Controls. If you want to give that ability to other
screen names in your account, you can do so by making the new name a
master screen name. See the “Creating a screen name” section, later in
this chapter, to find out how to create a master screen name.
 Choose your primary name carefully; it’s yours forever. Really.
 Screen names are 3 to 16 characters long, start with a letter, and contain
any combination of letters, numbers, and spaces that imagination can
dream up (within the bounds of good taste, that is).
Dealing with Screen Names
Managing the screen names in your account isn’t just a job — it’s a creative
adventure. This section goes through everything you need to know to keep
your screen names in order.
These instructions don’t apply to your account’s primary name. Short of quit-
ting AOL and signing up again, you can’t change that. Never. So there.
Creating a screen name
I think the people who started America Online read too much Shakespeare,
because the play Romeo and Juliet perfectly outlines the steps for making a
screen name. In the play, Romeo can’t decide on a screen name. Juliet tries to
calm him with the observation, “What’s in a name? That which we call a rose
by any other name would smell as sweet.” His confidence thus buoyed by
this botanic observation, he sets off to create a new screen name.
Kids — don’t try this at home alone. Romeo and Juliet did, and look what hap-
pened to them. (If you don’t know what happened to Romeo and Juliet, you
can find out on the Internet. For a stroll through the classics, visit the
Shakespeare area at keyword Shakespeare, or the Literature & Literary
Figures area inside keyword Reading.)
79
Chapter 6: Doing the Screen Name Tango

Making a new screen name only takes a few moments. Just follow these steps:
1. Sign on to America Online with your account’s primary name or any
master screen name.
The primary name can create new screen names, as can any other
screen name that has master screen name status (more about that later
in this chapter).
2. After safely connecting to the service, go to keyword Screen Names).
The AOL Screen Names dialog box appears. (If you haven’t read the
screen names sidebar “Now be nice!” earlier in this chapter, now is an
excellent time to take a look at it.)
3. Click the Create a Screen Name option. 
America Online displays a small dialog box asking whether the new
screen name is for a child.
If America Online instead protests that Your account already has
the maximum of 7 screen names, kiss one of your current screen
names goodbye. For more about that, see the “Deleting an old screen
name” section, later in this chapter.
4. If this screen name is for a child and you want some quick tips about
online safety, click the Yes button in the little dialog box. Otherwise,
click the No button.
If you click Yes, America Online delivers a public-service-announcement-
style message about keeping children safe online. If you’re new to the
online world, please read the material. It takes only two or three minutes
and is well worth the time. Click Continue when you finish reading.
If you click No in the dialog box (or click Continue after having clicked
Yes), America Online continues onward toward making a new screen
name. It spits out a nice overview window that reminds you of the steps
toward making a screen name.
5. Click the Create Screen Name button to get on with the process.
Finally, when all hope lies exhausted on the floor, you get to make your
screen name. To reinforce this point, the Step 1 of 4 window appears.
6. In the text box, type the new screen name, and then click the
Continue button.
If the screen name you typed is available, America Online creates it and
asks for a password. In that case, skip ahead to Step 8. If someone else
thought of the screen name before you, the system suggests that you
choose something else, as shown in Figure 6-1.
7. If America Online tells you that the screen name you want is not avail-
able, click OK to make the information dialog box leave you alone,
and go back to Step 6 and try again.
80
Part II: Settling Into Your Online Home 

If your second attempt at picking a screen name doesn’t work, then the
big computers at America Online leap into the fray and attempt to help
you create a valid screen name. The outcome looks much like having your
3-year-old “help” you make a cake from scratch: messy, but with occasion-
ally delightful outcomes. Figure 6-2 shows America Online’s the please
lemme help you pick a name window. You can type three words and let the
computer randomly assemble them into a valid name, or you just click the
Try Another Screen Name button to do it yourself. If you reach this point,
heed Juliet’s wise and earnest advice: “O, be some other name!” 
If all else fails, add a number like 777, 1234, or 2 to your previously
scheduled name choice. That usually works.
After you and America Online agree on a screen name (which may take
several tries), the Choose a Password dialog box appears, asking you to
set a password for the new screen name.

8. Type the password twice and then click the Continue button.
America Online passwords have to be between six and eight characters
long. As you type a password, little stars (asterisks) appear on-screen.
Yes, it’s supposed to happen that way — it’s a security thing.
Because you can’t see what you’re typing, America Online makes you
enter the password twice so that you’re sure you didn’t make a typing
mistake. Type the password in the box on the left and again in the box
on the right. If the two entries don’t agree, the software warns you and
makes you try again.
After the password is accepted, the Parental Controls dialog box
appears. See the “Psst — what’s the password?” sidebar, later in this
chapter, for some important thoughts and warnings about passwords.
9. Select an access level for your new screen name by clicking the appro-
priate option in the Parental Controls dialog box. Click OK to lock in
the selection.
If you choose the General 18+ setting, America Online then asks whether
you want this screen name to be a master screen name. (Three of your
seven screen names can be master screen names, but no more than
that.) For more about that, continue with the next step. For all other
types of screen names, skip ahead to Step 12.
Although the Parental Controls dialog box offers some guidelines for
choosing the right access level, the decision is up to you as a parent.
America Online doesn’t require kids to have a particular access level —
it’s not AOL’s job. You, the parent, have the full and final say in the
matter.
You can always change the access level for a screen name if you find
that it’s too restrictive or too loose. For more information about the
other Parental Controls, see the next chapter.
10. To designate the new screen name as a master screen name, click the
Yes radio button. Otherwise, click No. Click Continue to, well, con-
tinue. After America Online reviews everything your screen name
can do, click the Accept Settings button to save your work.
Master screen names can create and delete screen names in your
account, change Parental Controls, and generally do anything the pri-
mary screen name can. You may make your significant other’s screen
name a master screen name, but don’t give that ability to the kids.
Just to belabor the point a bit, do not give your child access to a master
screen name unless you want to give little Timmy or Samantha access to
the entire online world, complete with warts, porn, and everything else
we know and love.
82
Part II: Settling Into Your Online Home 

With everything completed, America Online congratulates you on a
screen name well created. It also outlines what the screen name can do
with the access you selected back in Step 9 and gives you the opportu-
nity to make some last-moment tweaks to the screen name’s Parental
Controls settings.
11. Click Accept Settings if the Parental Controls settings match your
wishes, or click Customize Settings to make changes to the Parental
Controls. 
(For more about the Parental Controls, flip ahead to Chapter 7.)
12. To use the new screen name, sign off from America Online by cho-
osing Sign Off➪Sign Off from the main menu and clicking Yes in the
dialog box that appears.
The Sign On screen clears, and the Goodbye dialog box bids you a fond
farewell.
13. Click the down arrow next to the Screen Name box and choose your
new screen name from the list.
14. Press Tab to move to the Password box and type the new password
you created.
15. Click Sign On.
Poof — it’s the new you!
America Online automatically sends a “welcome aboard” e-mail message to
the new screen name, offering some thoughts about good online citizenship,
tips for changing your password, and a few other topics as well. The system
also sends a reminder e-mail to your primary screen name and all master
screen names saying that a new screen name just joined your account. To
make sure that the message stands out among the other items in your mail-
box, it arrives as Official AOL Mail, complete with a blue icon next to the mes-
sage subject. Impressive, eh?
If you ever find one of those “Thanks for making a new screen name” mes-
sages in your mailbox when you haven’t made a new screen name, immedi-
ately call the America Online Customer Service department, at 800-827-6364.
Although it may be nothing more than a computer glitch, it also may mean
that someone broke into your account. Either way, calling America Online to
find out what’s going on makes a lot of sense.
Deleting an old screen name
Even screen names reach the end of their usefulness. When that time comes
for the screen names in your account, delete them and go on about your busi-
ness. Just follow these steps to delete a screen name:

Chapter 6: Doing the Screen Name Tango

1. Sign on to America Online with your primary screen name or a master
screen name.
If you aren’t familiar with master screen names, see the brief description
in Step 10 of the preceding section. If you don’t really care about master
screen names, that’s fine, too — just barrel ahead with your primary
screen name.
2. After connecting, go to keyword Screen Names).
The AOL Screen Names dialog box appears.
3. Click the Delete a Screen Name option in the dialog box.
The aptly named Are You Sure? dialog box pops up.
4. Take a deep breath and click the Continue button.
The Delete a Screen Name dialog box appears, looking just the tiniest bit
somber in its fateful duties.
5. Click the screen name you want to delete, and then click Delete.
Be darn sure that you want to delete this screen name before clicking the
Delete button. Although you can theoretically restore deleted screen
names up to six months after you whacked them, it’s an inexact science.
Translated into English, restoring a deleted screen name is up to the
impish whims of the America Online computers. Maybe they’ll let you
restore the name, and then again, maybe they won’t. Who knows how
these machines think?
6. After doing the dirty deed, America Online issues the brief, generic
obituary, shown in Figure 6-3.
You can’t delete the primary screen name. Also, any master screen name on
your account can delete (and create) other screen names.

Changing a screen name
What if you have a screen name and decide that you want to change it a little?
Well, you’re out of luck. To paraphrase the wisdom of Yoda, the Jedi master
from Star Wars, “There is no change, only delete. Delete, then create again.”
Your only option is to delete the existing screen name and then create a new
one from scratch. Sorry to break the news to you like this, but that’s just life
in the online service world.
Restoring a deleted screen name
Having second thoughts about deleting your favorite screen name, eh? Who
can blame you? (After all, that really was a great screen name!) Thank good-
ness America Online offers the Restore a Screen Name option. If all goes well,
after a couple of quick clicks, your old screen name (complete with its online
profile) is back, as good as new.
Notice that I said, “If all goes well.” As you may suspect, things can go wrong
with the restoration process — like the simple problem of the America Online
computers saying “No, you can’t have that name back.” Precisely why they
do this, I don’t understand. It probably has something to do with zebra migra-
tions, cat hairballs, and the number of lawyers worldwide telling the truth at
any given moment (not like that’s ever a big number).
Now that you suffered through fair warning that the process may not work,
follow these steps to restore a deleted screen name:

Chapter 6: Doing the Screen Name Tango
Psst — what’s the password?
Just like music and cooking, making a good
password is an art. Here, in two sentences, is
my accumulated knowledge on the subject:
The best passwords string together two
common but unrelated words (such as GRAIN-
FUN) or add a number to the end of a word
(TRAIN577, for example). Your password should
not be your name, birth date, spouse’s name,
dog’s breed, shoe size, or anything else that
someone can find out about you.
By the way, if you’re setting up a screen name
for a child or a password-phobic adult, you can
configure the America Online software to auto-
matically enter that screen name’s password.

1. Sign on to America Online with your primary screen name.
2. After you connect, go to keyword Screen Names).
The AOL Screen Names dialog box appears.
3. Click the Restore a Screen Name option in the dialog box.
The Restore a Screen Name dialog box pops up.
4. Look through the listed screen names, click the one you want to
restore, and then click the Recover button.
Assuming that the America Online computers feel cooperative, the
system restores your screen name and gleefully pats you on the back to
celebrate.
If the name you want isn’t on the list or if the America Online computers
decide that you can’t recover it, you have my condolences. (I lost a few
screen names this way myself.) See the “Creating a screen name” section,
earlier in this chapter, because that’s your next stop.
Turn a Bit and Let Me See Your Profile
When you see people on the street or in the office, the first thing you notice
about them is how they look. Beyond that, they’re mysteries until you meet
them, talk with them, and invest some time getting to know them.
In the world of America Online, your screen name determines how you “look”
to the outside world. But America Online has something else, too — some-
thing really neat that I personally wish existed in real life: the member profile.
A member profile is a collection of tidbits and trivia about the owner of a par-
ticular screen name. For example, my member profile appears in Figure 6-4.
Despite what you may think, I’m an average, all-American game player, com-
puter jockey, musician, husband, and father of two. (I also write books, but
you already know that.) If I’m chatting with someone online and the other
person wants to know a little more about me, all he or she has to do is
choose Community➪Get Member Profile from the toolbar (or press Ctrl+G),
type my screen name in the Get a Member’s Profile dialog box, and click OK.
Presto! My member profile appears on-screen.
So where does all this profile information come from? From you (mine came
from Cleveland, but that’s another story). It’s up to you to create a member
profile for your screen name. If you don’t create a profile, other members
can’t find out about your likes, interests, and hobbies. In short, you barely
exist on Planet AOL.
86
Part II: Settling Into Your Online Home 

Here are a few additional thoughts about member profiles:
 Please, oh please, fill out your member profile. Leaving it blank is like
moving into a new neighborhood because you heard that it had lots of
fun people and then acting like a hermit.
 There’s another reason to fill out your member profile: People who share
your hobbies and interests can find you by searching the People
Directory. Chapter 16 explains the details.
 Although this falls under the heading of plain old common sense, I want
to drive home a point. Do not put your phone number, address, or other
truly personal information in your profile. On a scale of good to bad, this
is reeeeaaaaaally bad. Parents, check your kids’ profiles every now and
then just to make sure that they didn’t put anything too personal or too
weird in there.
 If you use more than one screen name, you need to fill out a member
profile for each one. Every screen name has its own member profile.
 Some parts of the service (such as the member-created game clubs at
keyword Game Clubs) rely on information in your member profile as
part of the game.
To create (or update) your member profile, follow these steps:
1. Make sure that you’re signed on to America Online with the correct
screen name.
Because every screen name has its own member profile, pairing the right
name and profile is important. (Imagine the fascinating possibilities of
confusing the profiles of Howard the Bank President and his role-playing
alter ego, Thar Drekskin, barbarian hunter and drinker of fine ale.)

Now you

87
Chapter 6: Doing the Screen Name Tango

2. Choose Community➪Member Directory from the main menu. When
the Member Directory window appears, click the My Profile link.
At long last, the Edit Your Online Profile dialog box appears, along with
a brief reminder about not sharing your personal information. If you’re
creating a member profile, the dialog box is blank. If you’re changing the
member profile, your current information appears in the spaces.
3. Fill out the member profile form.
The Member Profile window includes a bunch of tabs stacked along the
left side of the window, next to the typing area. To fill out your profile,
click a tab (such as Name, Location, or Favorite Gadgets), and then type
in some text. Some of the tabs (notably the Gender and Marital Status
lines) let you enter only a few characters or words, but most of them
give you plenty of space to write. Use the formatting buttons along the
top of the text area to add some spice and color to your entries.
To see how the profile looks as you work on it, click the Preview button
at the bottom of the window. You can always change your profile any
time you want, so experiment a bit and see what you come up with.
4. Click the Save button to save your work.
After clicking the Save button, America Online replies with a little dialog
box telling you that your profile is being updated. Although the update
process usually happens immediately, it occasionally takes a little while
(about ten minutes or much longer if the system is busy).
The new member profile system gives you a lot of cool tools for customizing
and visually tweaking your profile page with color, fonts, Web page links, and
even pictures. Chapter 20 goes into all of the details.

Chapter 7
Taking Away the Online Car Keys
with Parental Controls
In This Chapter
 Keeping your kids safe online — it’s your job
 Using the basic Parental Controls
 Putting boundaries exactly where you want them
L
ike any major city or tourist destination, America Online offers much for
you to see and do. Unfortunately, the similarities don’t end there. Every
big city also has a section that the tourist guide suggests avoiding, as well 
as a small, eerie population of less-than-moral people. If I said that America
Online was immune to this concept, I’d be a fool (no editorial comments from
readers who know me personally, please).
Whether you like the thought or not, the online world contains some places
(and some people) that your kids really don’t need to visit. That’s what the
Parental Controls are all about. They offer you, the parents, control over
what your kids can and can’t do with America Online.
This chapter gives you the tools you need to monitor and restrict your child’s
online activity. Best of all, America Online’s Parental Controls are divided by
age group, so as long as your children have individual America Online screen
names (a highly suggested option), you can set individual controls for each
child based on age and maturity level. While America Online gives you blan-
ket Parental Controls for various age groups, you don’t have to stop there.
You can customize each child’s screen name with the individual controls —
for e-mail, newsgroups, downloads, Web access, and time online — that offer
the best fit. Then, as your child changes and matures, you can adjust the con-
trols accordingly.
Just as your child is one-of-a-kind, with America Online’s Parental Controls
settings, you don’t have to settle for cookie-cutter controls. You can make
them as individual as your young explorer.

Reviewing the Basics of Online Safety
Online safety floats into many a conversation these days like an amorphous
cloud hanging over the atmosphere. Even the government got into the child
protection biz not too long ago with COPPA (the Children’s Online Privacy
Protection Act). With all the buzz about online safety, what’s really impor-
tant? And why do you, as a parent, care?
Most people you know probably agree that luring children qualifies as unsafe
for the children. Aside from that point, however, a lot of leeway exists along
the continuum between safe and unsafe. The goal of America Online’s
Parental Controls is to match your idea of safe with your child’s America
Online screen name. Before going into the details, here are a few thoughts to
set the stage:
 Different people have different views about what kids should and
shouldn’t do (just look around your neighborhood for proof). Please
understand that I’m not hopping onto a moral high horse and proclaim-
ing what’s right and wrong for your kids, and that I’m not passing judg-
ment about what’s available out there (although the thought is tempting
sometimes). I’m just explaining the tools available and giving some very
general advice for parents whose kids know the Internet better than
they do.
 To make the Parental Controls really work, only you, the parent, should
know the password to the primary screen name (the screen name you
created when you first signed up for America Online) and any master
screen names (new screen names that you gave master screen name
privileges).
 Create a screen name specifically for your child to use. Remember that
each America Online account can have up to seven screen names at no
extra charge — one primary name plus six others. To give each child in
the family a different level of access to America Online and the Internet,
create separate screen names for everyone.
 If you’re curious why I’m making such a big cloak-and-dagger deal out of
who’s using which screen name, here’s the reason: Master screen names
are special. Only a master screen name can set Parental Controls and
create screen names for your account. If your child uses a master screen
name for online access, he or she can simply turn off whatever Parental
Controls you turn on. (Whoops!) Instead, create a screen name espe-
cially for your child, place the controls on it, and keep the master screen
name for yourself.

Part II: Settling Into Your Online Home 

Starting the Controls — and Backing
Safely Down Your Digital Driveway
Display the Parental Controls window by clicking the Settings button on the
toolbar and then choosing Parental Controls from the Essentials list that
appears or by using keyword Parental Controls. Either way, the Parental
Controls information window appears. It offers general thoughts about the
Parental Controls thing, plus tosses out some cool tips and suggestions con-
cerning online safety and the America Online premium services (the ones
that cost extra to use). When you’re ready to do the Parental Controls thing,
click the Set Parental Controls Now button at the bottom of the screen.
America Online provides two levels of parental control, depending on how
much you want to tweak the digital knobs and levers. The basic level offers
four general options (Kids Only, Young Teen, Mature Teen, and General).
When you choose one of these options, America Online sets a bunch of
default restrictions governing what that screen name can access both within
America Online and outside on the Internet (when accessing the Internet with
the America Online built-in Web browser and other Internet tools).
The more advanced level is Custom Controls. This à la carte approach to the
Parental Controls helps you choose specific limitations for chatting, instant
messages, downloading, Web use, e-mail, and Internet newsgroups. Although
these settings take a bit more knowledge of America Online and the Net, you
end up with an online experience tuned exactly to your wishes and your
child’s needs.
How do you choose the right controls for your kid? It depends. Consider the
age and maturity of your child. Granted, our kids are all above average, but
for this one moment, try to be especially objective. How responsible is your
child? How naive? How trustworthy? Yes, these are tough questions, but this
decision is very important. Here are a few general guidelines to help you
along the way:
 For children ages 10 or younger, I recommend using the Kids Only
default option. This option lets them get into Kids Only, the area within
America Online that’s designed for that age group, plus kid-friendly Web
and Internet sites. You can feel comfortable that your little one won’t run
across anything incredibly weird (except, of course, other kids).
 The preteen and teen years are more challenging. (Stating the obvious is
one of my strengths.) If you use any controls at all, start with the appro-
priate teen-access setting. If your online child finds that setting too
restrictive, try relaxing things by using some specific Custom Controls
91
Chapter 7:  Taking Away the Online Car Keys with Parental Controls

options discussed in the following section. If you use the Custom
Controls feature, I recommend blocking member rooms in the Chat
control, FTP in the Download control, and any Internet newsgroup con-
taining the magic word sex or erotic in the Newsgroup control. That
combination maximizes the widely acceptable stuff while blocking off
the Internet’s most (ahem) colorful content.
 If you feel comfortable giving your kids free run of the world, that’s cool.
In that case, use the General option, which gives them full access to
both America Online and the Internet. Nothing says that you must use
the controls — they’re just available tools.
As you poke around Parental Controls, look for the Internet Access Controls
button in the main window. Possibly one of the neatest things to come out of
the America Online development burrows in a long time (at least, from a
parent’s perspective), Internet Access Controls allow you to limit your child’s
access to any additional Internet browser that may be loaded onto your com-
puter outside of America Online.
If you connect to America Online with a DSL line or through your cable
provider, installing Internet Access Controls on your computer means that
your child can no longer bypass the parentally controlled America Online
screen name you carefully set up. With Internet Access Controls installed,
everyone needs to enter his or her America Online screen name and pass-
word before they can use any Web browser on your computer, as Figure 7-1
demonstrates. The computer then screens that name and password for
parental controls. If it matches your child’s screen name and password with
any of the Parental Controls settings outside of General (and it does, if you
set the controls), a window appears telling your child that she can access the
Internet only through America Online. Then the America Online software
helpfully appears, ready for sign on.
If you worry about unrestricted preteen Internet access as much as I do
(because I now have two preteens at my house), setting one or more of these
controls might just replace the hair you lost through concern for your little
loved ones. And if you decide to install Parental Controls on your child’s
screen name and you find that America Online automatically blocks one or
more of your personally parentally approved favorite sites, you can unlock
specific sites so your child can visit them without restriction. The Web
Controls portion of the next section explains how to unlock Web sites.
You can change all of the Parental Control settings at any time, so don’t
worry about ruining your children forever by making the wrong choice.
Choose the settings, talk to your children, and see how everything works. If
you need to make adjustments, do so. Most of all, work with your children
and let them know that you’re interested in their online world. That makes a
bigger impact than any control ever can.

Chapter 7:  Taking Away the Online Car Keys with Parental Controls
Tracking their time online
What do these kids do while sitting in front of the
AOL software for hours at a time? If you ask,
you’ll likely hear the common teen or preteen
responses: “What? Oh. Chattin’.” “Playin’.”
Chatting with whom? Who in the world has hours
to talk online? Playing what? What game could
possibly interest them that long? (Not to be nosy
here, but sooner or later the children’s rapt atten-
tion arouses the parental curiosity in most of us.)
America Online designed a tracker just for us
parents who want to ensure that their children
don’t spend their time in unsavory online places,
or with possible unsavory online residents.
Known as the AOL Guardian (keyword AOL
Guardian), this Parental Control tracks where
your darling wanders during Internet time. It
tracks Web sites your child visits (or attempts to
visit), number of instant messages sent, and
number of e-mail messages sent while online. It
also keeps track of any activity in your child’s
Buddy List or online Address Book. 
You can set up AOL Guardian on any screen
name that carries Kid’s Only, Young Teen, or
Mature Teen Parental Controls. Once you set it
up, AOL Guardian sends you an e-mail each time
your child signs on with his screen name. The
e-mail tells you when the child was on as well as
a summary of your child’s online activity —
which can be really helpful. A little forewarned,
you’re ready for “Daaaaad, I tried to get on this
specific site and AOL wouldn’t let me. Will you
mark it as an okay site, please?” With the AOL
Guardian e-mail, you already know which sites
the child attempted to visit, and you can check
them out to approve (or disapprove) before the
request even comes your way.

Tailoring Online Life 
with Custom Controls
Sometimes (well, frequently, in my case) the one-size-fits-all solutions just
don’t fit. If your child needs more access here and less access there than 
the Kids Only or teen access controls allow, try customizing the Parental
Controls. In the main Parental Controls window (keyword Parental Controls),
click the child’s screen name in the Edit Parental Controls section of the
window. This leads you to the do-it-yourself side of the Parental Controls
(shown in Figure 7-2), where you, the parent, take complete control over
what your kids can and can’t do online.
The options in this window govern the most important interactive parts of
America Online. Each option is described in this section.
None of these controls protect a child who has access to a master screen
name on your America Online account. (Master screen names always have
permission to change the Parental Controls for any screen name in your
account.) To take advantage of the Parental Controls, you must create a sepa-
rate, nonmaster screen name for your child.
AOL Guardian control
When they play outside for hours at a time, you find yourself peeking out the
door every now and then. If they’re at a friend’s house, you often give them a
specific time to be home and then check the clock to ensure that they’re
home when they said they’d be home. While you don’t want to peek into

every aspect of your child’s life, some times you feel better if you know what
they’re up to. If you need a little reassurance now and then when it comes to
your child’s online life, AOL Guardian may provide it for you.
AOL Guardian helpfully sends an e-mail to the master screen name detailing
your child’s online activity. E-mails and instant messages sent, time online,
Web sites visited, and Web sites your child attempted to visit all appear in
the AOL Guardian e-mail you receive after each time your child signs on to
the service. 
To set up the AOL Guardian control:
1. Sign on to America Online with a master screen name and then go to
keyword Parental Controls. 
The Parental Controls window appears, ready for your tweaking.
2. In the Edit Parental Controls box, click your child’s screen name in
the list.
The Parental Controls window changes to show the controls set for that
specific screen name.
3. Click the Edit AOL Guardian button near the bottom of the Parental
Controls window.
The AOL Guardian Controls window appears, awaiting your instructions.
It sports one lonely option, but it’s a good one.
4. Check the Send Me AOL Guardian Reports option.
Checking the option activates the system that tracks your child’s online
activity and sends you an e-mail report. AOL Guardian also helpfully
throws a dialog box to the screen when your child signs on to remind
him that his activity is logged through AOL Guardian. 
5. When you’re satisfied with the change, click Save.
A dialog box appears telling you that your AOL Guardian changes are
saved.
6. Click OK to make the dialog box go away, and then close any open
Parental Controls windows.
There. You’re done. To cancel AOL Guardian, simply repeat the steps
and uncheck the Send Me AOL Guardian Reports option.
Online Timer control
First it was baseball cards. Then video games took over. Now your children
spend every free moment of their day glued to the home computer, wander-
ing the world of America Online. You hoped they’d enjoy the online world, but
95
Chapter 7:  Taking Away the Online Car Keys with Parental Controls

spending all evening every evening online (plus many hours on the week-
ends) is a little more enjoyment than you had in mind. Luckily, the America
Online Parental Controls include precisely the option you need: an online
timer.
The Online Timer control helps you build digital fences in your child’s online
schedule. You can control both the amount of time your child spends online
and when the time is available. These settings work no matter how your child
signs on to America Online. Whether sitting at your home machine or over at
a friend’s house using the Guest option, the Online Timer control keeps your
child within your limits every time.
To set the Online Timer control, follow these steps:
1. Sign on to America Online with a master screen name. After you’re
online, click the Settings icon from the toolbar and then click the
Parental Controls link (or use keyword Parental Controls). 
The detailed Parental Controls window soundlessly enters the room.
2. In the Edit Parental Controls box, select the child’s screen name.
The window shifts and shimmies a bit, and then displays the current
Parental Controls settings for the screen name you chose.
3. In the Current Controls area at the bottom of the dialog box, click the
Edit Time Online button.
The Online Timer window pops onto the screen.
Change your mind? Don’t feel like building a timer after all? Not to worry,
because the America Online programmers offer a quick way out. Just
click Cancel at this point to keep things just the way they are right now.
4. Select the type of time limit you want, and then click Next.
For most kids, either the Allow Access for x Hours Per Day or the Allow
Online Access on Saturday and Sunday Limits settings work the best.
After you make your choice, America Online displays the duration and
timeframe settings that match your time limit choice. To customize your
child’s online limits day by day throughout the week, use the Custom
Daily Access option. The Change These Settings link allows you to set
specific time limits within any time range you choose for each and every
day of the week.
5. If you opt for Custom Daily Access, click the Change These Settings
link. 
A window appears with each time limit and timeframe option equipped
with a down arrow.
6. For Custom Daily Access, set your child’s number of online hours and
available time frame by clicking the down arrows next to each entry
and then clicking your choice. (If you opted for one of the quicker
options, simply skip this step and move on.)
96
Part II: Settling Into Your Online Home 

While individually selecting 21 time options may look daunting, it goes
quite quickly once you start. After all, you already have in mind when
you want your child online. Remember that you’re choosing how many
hours per day your child can use America Online, as well as the time
frame when those hours are available. Click Save when you finish, and
the now-set dialog box whisks away.
7. Choose your time zone from the pull-down list.
If you live in one of those esoteric parts of the country that doesn’t use
daylight saving time (like I do), then you probably need to reset your
time zone every six months when you spring forward and fall back — 
or whatever you do in your part of the country.
8. Double-check your work. If everything looks fine, click Save. To adjust
something, make your changes, and click Save.
And with that, your work is finished. The Online Timer settings are in
place, ready to corral your wandering child.
Web controls
Few things in the world change faster than the Web (although the flux-filled
policy statements of many career politicians do come close). The Web is
filled with thousands of clever and informative sites, but it’s also the home of
many pages best left unseen by little eyes. To keep curious youngsters
pointed toward the truly educational things rather than the woo-hoo-hubba-
hubba educational ones, try applying some Web controls.
These controls limit the sites that the America Online built-in Web browser
can connect to. Sites get rated by the Powers That Be (whoever they are)
according to the type of content they contain. The Web controls include Kids
Only (a limited list of sites for ages 6 to 12), Young Teen (another limited list
for ages 13 to 15), and the Mature Teen block list (which allows full Web
access but blocks specific inappropriate sites). The system’s other option
grants full access to the Web.
For younger kids, stick with the Kids Only–approved site listing. After your
children blossom into the terrible teens, give them the appropriate teen set-
ting or full access (as long as they can handle the responsibility). Because so
much of the America Online content is Web-based, I can’t recommend com-
pletely shutting down Web access for any account.
To apply the Web controls, follow these steps:
1. Sign on to America Online with a master screen name, and then click
the Settings icon on the toolbar and click the Parental Controls link
from the list that appears. 
The detailed Parental Controls window soundlessly enters the room.
97
Chapter 7:  Taking Away the Online Car Keys with Parental Controls

2. In the Edit Parental Controls box that fills the window, click the
child’s screen name.
The window updates itself and displays the current Parental Controls
settings for the screen name you chose.
3. In the Current Controls area in the middle of the dialog box, click the
Edit Web Control button.
The Web Controls window pops onto the screen.
4. Select the level of Web control you want.
You can choose only one setting per screen name.
5. Click Save to store the settings; then close the Parental Controls
window.
The Web controls are ready to serve and protect.
If you find that your child cannot access a site that you deem suitable for
him, or if you think that the preset America Online controls allow too much
freedom for the range you chose, use the Web Unlock feature to block or
allow specific Web sites for your child.
Here’s how to use the Web Unlock feature:
1. Go to the Parental Controls window by using keyword Parental
Controls (or click the Settings icon in the toolbar and then click 
the Parental Controls link from the list).
The detailed Parental Controls window soundlessly enters the room. If
your child attempts to visit a Web site and is denied, she can request that
the master screen name approve the site. In that case, you see a Web link
next to your child’s screen name in the Parental Controls window.
Clicking the Web link takes you directly to the Web Unlock List window.
In that case, proceed directly to Step 4. Otherwise, continue with Step 2. 
2. In the Edit Parental Controls box that fills the window, click the
child’s screen name.
The window displays the current Parental Controls settings for the
screen name you chose. 
3. In the Current Controls area in the middle of the dialog box, click the
Edit Web Control button.
The Web Controls window pops onto the screen.
4. Click the Web Unlock button in the box at the bottom of the Web
Browsing Controls window.

The Web Unlock List window opens, showing you three options:
• The Pending Request tab shows a list of sites your child wants to
view but is blocked by the software. Check the box next to the site,
and click either the Approve Request button to allow your child
access to that site, or the Deny Request button to say no.
• The Allowed Sites tab lets you type in any Web address that you
want your child to see. It also shows the list of sites you allowed in
the past through this window, and gives you the option to remove
any of them. If you have several children set up under several
screen names, you need to go through this process for each screen
name if you want all of them to view the site. Use the Show Lists
drop-down menu to switch between screen names that carry
Parental Controls.
• The Blocked Sites tab blocks any specific Web site that you want to
be sure America Online catches. Or block a Web site that you find
inappropriate that America Online may allow. For example, if you
have a personal or family aversion to cartoons, you may want to
block www.cartoonnetwork.com. 
5. When all looks as you want it to, click the window’s Close button to
send it back to Parental Controls haven. 
The window disappears with all your instructions intact.
Instant message controls
Instant messages are the immediate communication windows that appear out
of nowhere (sometimes scaring the living daylights out of you, depending on
the hour of the day and how hard you are concentrating at that moment).
Instant messages let you carry on a private, one-on-one chat with someone
else on America Online or on the Internet (through the America Online
Instant Messenger software — see keyword Instant Messenger for the scoop
about that).
Depending on the age and maturity of your children, you may or may not
want them using instant messages. (I turned the whole instant-message thing
off on my kids’ accounts, but my kids are also in the under-13 age bracket.)
To limit your child’s access to the instant message system, follow these
steps:
1. Sign on to America Online with your master screen name, click the
Settings icon on the toolbar, and then click the Parental Controls link
that appears in the Setting window.
The Parental Controls settings window appears, eager to help.

2. In the Edit Parental Controls box near the top of the window, click the
child’s screen name.
The window displays the current Parental Controls settings for the
screen name you selected.
3. In the Current Controls area in the middle of the dialog box, click the
Edit IM Control button.
The Instant Messaging Control window hops to the screen, just like the
one shown in Figure 7-3.
4. If you want to keep instant messages from your youngster, select the
Block Instant Messaging option for this screen name.
The choice is clear: Let your child use instant messages or not. This isn’t
a shades-of-gray kind of decision.
5. After you’re satisfied with the control settings, click Save to save
them. Close the Custom Controls window (click the X button in the
upper-right corner of the window or click the Close button at the
bottom of the window) when you’re finished.
The instant message controls are in place (and you can breathe a little
easier).
E-mail control
E-mail is a powerful communications tool, although it can also be powerfully
annoying. With the new America Online Mail controls, however, you can take
command of your e-mail box and, more importantly, protect your kids from
mail they shouldn’t get.

Part II: Settling Into Your Online Home 

The Mail controls fall into three distinct groups: general limitations on all
mail, specific restrictions based on a set of e-mail addresses, and whether a
screen name can receive messages with pictures and files. Here’s a look at
your options by group:
 Control Who I Get Mail From: These options establish simple, 
wide-ranging limits on all mail sent to a particular screen name. The 
options are
• Allow Mail from All Senders: Anyone on AOL or the Internet can
send e-mail to this screen name.
• Allow Mail Only from AOL Members: If your friend isn’t on AOL,
you won’t be getting any e-mail from her.
• Allow Mail Only from People I Know: Anyone lucky enough to
make this person’s Buddy List or Address Book can send e-mail to
the screen name.
• Block Mail from All Senders: So much for the e-mail thing — it
was nice while it lasted.
• Use a Custom Sender List: Define special instructions about how
this screen name receives mail. Click the Custom Sender List link
to open the Custom Sender List box. This allows you to either
block specific e-mail addresses or allow specific e-mail addresses.
• Block Mail Containing Pictures or Files: If you check this box, all
messages containing either images (pictures inserted directly into
an e-mail message) or attached files are blocked, no matter who it’s
from.
• Blocked Mail Should Be: This final selection lets you determine
what America Online does with all blocked mail. Either perma-
nently delete it so the offending e-mail is gone without a trace, or
deliver it to the Spam Folder and let America Online take it from
there. 
 Control What Is in the Mail I Get: These controls deal with spam, which
is the e-mail you don’t want your kids to get anyway. Who wants to sort
through junk mail before they get their first apartment address? 
• Mail Filtered by AOL’s Advanced Spam Filter: Automatically
places junk e-mail into the Spam Folder as the America Online
Spam Filter detects it. Check this option to turn it on.
• Mail with Clickable Hyperlinks (URLs): Checking this box sends
e-mail that contains underlined links directly to the Spam Folder,
no questions asked. 
• Mail Containing Words on my Custom Word List: Create a Custom
Word List of terms that you don’t want to see in your e-mailbox,
and then check this box. Those messages are history.
101
Chapter 7:  Taking Away the Online Car Keys with Parental Controls

• Allow This Screen Name to View Contents of Spam Folder: This
check box, near the top of the window, allows your child to see
what was blocked from her e-mail account and tossed into the
Spam Folder if you check it. If you go to all the trouble to select the
Spam Filter on a child’s account, you probably don’t want them
digging around in the folder that contains the junk mail. But maybe
that’s just me.
These controls offer a great deal of flexibility — enough for everyone I hope.
My favorites on the list are the Allow Mail Only from AOL Members (great for
easily blocking Internet junk mail) and Use a Custom Sender List (because it’s
a slightly looser version of the preceding option) options. Although at certain
moments the hermitlike Block All Mail option is interesting, I think defining
who is acceptable is more powerful than blocking those who aren’t.
To put up some e-mail controls, follow these steps:
1. Sign on with your master screen name, click the Settings icon on the
toolbar, and then click the Parental Controls link in the window that
appears.
The Parental Controls window opens.
2. In the Edit Controls box at the top of the screen, choose your child’s
screen name from the list.
The window resets itself to display the current Parental Controls set-
tings for the selected screen name.
3. In the Current Controls area at the bottom of the dialog box, click the
Edit E-Mail Control check box.
The Mail and Spam Controls window appears, ready to help protect your
kids, as shown in Figure 7-4. 
4. In the Mail and Spam Controls window, click the option for the proper
level of basic mail control.
If you choose the Use a Custom Sender List option, be sure to click the
Custom Sender link so you can include those e-mail addresses to include
(or block).
5. Decide whether the screen name can receive messages containing pic-
tures or attached files. Check or uncheck the box to match your
choice.
If you check the box, all messages with pictures or files attached are
blocked.
6. Determine the fate of all blocked mail, and click the button next to
your choice.
Either file it away in the Spam Folder or destroy it. The choice is yours.
102
Part II: Settling Into Your Online Home 

7. Check what mail (if any) you want delivered to the Spam Folder. Your
choices are: 
• Mail filtered by AOL’s Spam Filter
• Mail with clickable hyperlinks (URLs)
• Mail containing words on my Custom Word List.
8. Check the box next to the screen name in the drop-down menu if you
want to allow this screen name to view contents of Spam Folder.
Decide whether to allow perusal or not.
9. Click Save, and the Mail and Spam Controls window closes on its own.
Close the Parental Controls window as well if that ends your work here.
Your mail controls are now in place and running. If you like these e-mail
controls, and want to apply them to another screen name as well, click
Save & Copy instead of Save, and America Online lists your screen
names so that you can choose the next E-mail Control recipient.
Chat controls
The People Connection chat rooms are a popular attraction on America
Online. Unfortunately, the word popular often translates into time-consuming,
because you can easily lose track of time while chatting the night away.
To keep your kids (or even yourself) out of the chat rooms, follow these
instructions:

Additional master screen names
In the world of screen names, only a few are masters — the rest, simply sub-
ordinates. That’s a good way to keep things if you’re a parent with online
kids. By default, only your primary screen name (the one you created when
you first signed on to America Online) is a master screen name. If adding
another master screen name would simplify your life, open the Additional
Master Parental Controls and get to work.
The Additional Master window accomplishes only one thing: It turns normal
screen names into master screen names. It doesn’t create screen names (for
that, use keyword Screen Names), change screen names, or even smirk at
screen names. This is one seriously focused window.
Do not give your child a master screen name! That’s the digital equivalent of
loaning your beloved teenager the keys to your 1966 Corvette, signing over
the vehicle’s title, handing him or her your gold credit card, and casually
mentioning that you’re on the way out the door for a two-year-long world
105
Chapter 7:  Taking Away the Online Car Keys with Parental Controls

cruise. In short, having a master screen is free rein for the child to do what-
ever he or she wants in the online world. Because master screen names can
set Parental Controls and create screen names, only parents should use the
master screen names.
With that warning ringing in your ears, here’s a run-through of the process of
changing the master screen name settings:
1. Sign on with the master screen name and then click the Settings icon
on the toolbar and click the Parental Controls link in the AOL Settings
window. 
The Parental Controls settings window finally appears, ready to work.
2. In the Edit Parental Controls box at the top of the window, select the
child’s screen name.
The window updates itself and displays the current Parental Controls
settings for the screen name you chose.
3. Click the More Options button at the top of the Parental Controls
window, scroll down to the Additional Master setting and click the
entry.
After that little romp, you land in the Additional Master Screen Names
Controls window.
4. Select the option at the bottom of the window that bestows master-
screen-name status on this lowly screen name.
Only three of your seven screen names can be master screen names.
Your primary screen name automatically has master status, so you can
assign as many as two more masters on your account.
5. After you finish setting the Master option, click Save.
America Online stores your preferences and updates the online records
for your screen names. As a security precaution, America Online auto-
matically sends to the primary screen name a notification e-mail that
gives the time and date each screen name received master status.
If you open your e-mail box one day and find a letter saying that one of your
screen names recently received master status but you didn’t do it, immedi-
ately call the America Online Customer Service department at 800-827-6364
and enlist its help to find out what’s happening with your account.
Download controls
Of all the Parental Controls, the Download controls are probably the least
important. Granted, some things in the world I don’t want my kids download-
ing from America Online or the Internet, but that’s hardly my biggest concern
about online life.
106
Part II: Settling Into Your Online Home 

If it’s a bigger worry in your life than in mine, follow these steps to limit your
child’s access to downloadable files:
1. Sign on to America Online with your master screen name and then
click the Settings icon on the toolbar. After the window appears, click
the Parental Controls option.
If everything works just right, the Parental Controls settings window
appears.
2. In the Edit Parental Controls box at the top of the window, select the
screen name for your child.
The window updates itself and displays the current Parental Controls
settings for the screen name you chose.
3. Click the More Options button at the top of the Parental Controls
window, and scroll until the Download control item appears, and then
click its entry.
The vaguely impressive Downloading Control dialog box leaps into view.
4. To turn on the Download controls, select one or both options in the
dialog box. 
I wouldn’t bother with the Block AOL Software Library Downloads
option, but turning on the Block FTP Software Downloads option makes
a lot of sense. FTP (File Transfer Protocol) copies files through the
Internet, and there’s no telling what your inquisitive kiddo may find out
there.
5. Click Save.
An energetic dialog box pops up, letting you know that your changes are
saved.
6. Click OK, and then close the Parental Controls windows.
Download controls are now in place!
As you may have guessed by now, to undo the Download controls, you simply
repeat the steps to create them. The big difference is that this time you click
the option off rather than turn it on.
Newsgroup controls
Of all the custom Parental Controls, the Newsgroup control is the most valu-
able. Internet newsgroups are an incredible resource, filled with discussions
about almost every topic imaginable. However, not all the conversations out
there are designed for eyes under age 18.
To block out the most exotic (I’m being kind here) material that newsgroups
offer, follow these steps:
107
Chapter 7:  Taking Away the Online Car Keys with Parental Controls

1. Sign on with the master screen name and then click the Settings icon
on the toolbar. Finish your trip by clicking the Parental Controls link
in the AOL Settings window.
The Parental Controls settings window appears.
2. In the Edit Parental Controls box in the middle of the screen, click the
child’s screen name in the list.
The window resets itself so you can see the current Parental Controls
settings for the selected screen name.
3. Click the More Options button at the top of the window, find the
Newsgroup controls entry, and click it.
The Newsgroup control window pops into view.
4. For most kids, I recommend setting the controls as shown in Figure 7-6. 
The example setting blocks your child from any Internet newsgroup
with, shall we say, stimulating words in its name. This one setting
quickly blocks off most of the content that many parents are concerned
about.
This setting just takes care of the newsgroups (which really need taken
care of, by the way); it does nothing to keep your kids out of the more
explicit areas of the Web. For that, see the “Web controls” section, ear-
lier in this chapter.
5. When you finish the settings, click Save.
6. Close all the various open windows and continue with your regularly
scheduled day.
Your child is now mostly safe from the Internet newsgroups.
Figure 7-6:

108
Part II: Settling Into Your Online Home 

To undo these restrictions, work back through the preceding steps. In Step 4,
delete the entries in the Block Newsgroups text area. Remember to click Save
when you’re finished!
Premium services
Your monthly America Online fee covers a lot of ground. It provides e-mail
access, Internet access, chat rooms, message boards, and lots of other goodies.
Even so, some areas of the service (notably, some of the cool multiplayer
games) bring an extra hourly fee. If your kids enjoy computer games as much
as my kids do, keeping junior (or juniorette) out of the for-pay games could
spell the difference between fiscal responsibility and financial disaster.
Some parents must be at America Online, because all the generic age restric-
tion settings (Kids Only, Young Teen, and Mature Teen) automatically block
access to premium service areas.
If you want to give your children access to the pay-by-the-hour games and
other premium fee areas, follow these steps:
1. Sign on with the master screen name and then click the Settings icon
on the toolbar. Complete the journey by clicking the Parental Controls
link in the Settings window.
The Parental Controls settings window appears.
2. In the Edit Parental Controls box at the top of the screen, click your
child’s screen name in the list.
The window resets itself so you can see the current Parental Controls
settings for the screen name you clicked.
3. Click the More Options button at the top of the window and click the
Premium Services option. 
The Premium Services window hops into view.
4. Select the Block Premium Services option to choose your premium
services settings.
To block your child’s access to premium service areas, select the option.
To allow your child into the pay-by-the-hour areas, deselect the option
(click in the box until the check mark disappears).
5. With your setting in place, click Save to . . . well . . . save your settings.
Close the various Parental Controls windows and then carry on with
your regularly scheduled online time.
That’s it — the settings are good to go!

I
t doesn’t take much traveling before you start compiling a mental list of
roads you enjoy driving, locales that don’t match your temperament, and
restaurants that you never found despite splendid directions from the hotel
concierge. It’s human nature — we know what we like, and when in doubt, we
usually choose the known rather than the unknown (particularly because we
go there without getting lost).
During your first forays around the online world, you probably discovered
several (and perhaps many) likable haunts across both America Online and
the Internet — and you probably got lost once or twice along the way, too. To
help remember the interesting places, you likely turned to that tried-and-true
friend of office workers everywhere, the sticky note. Unfortunately, after a few
weeks of online exploring, your monitor (and possibly the wall space around
it) looks like the ancient burial ground where sticky notes go to die.
With so many places to visit out there, the sticky note solution to remembering
your favorite spots usually causes mild memory trauma and frequent office-
supply raids, neither of which make life very fun. That’s where this chapter
fits into your world.
The following pages explore the gentle art of navigating America Online
through its keyword system, which moves you instantly from here to there
and everywhere. It also explains how to rid your monitor of those remember
this area’s keyword sticky notes with the built-in Favorite Places and QuickView
features. 

If you’re tired of stumbling across something cool and then losing the note
that can get you back there, kick back, put your feet up, and flip through this
chapter. It’s here to help.
Unlocking the Keys to Keywords
Almost every information area, window, and fascinating destination in
America Online has a special word or phrase that identifies it. The America
Online software refers to those words and phrases as keywords. Keywords
work like little magic carpets that whisk you wherever you want to go around
the system. Using keywords saves you lots of time, and makes the service all
the easier to navigate, too.
Most America Online areas display their keyword along the bottom-right side
of their window, just like the Homework Help window in Figure 8-1. Some 
windows use a single word, such as the AOL Sports area at keyword Sports.
Others use a simple phrase such as Job Hunting 101, an area devoted to
helping you land a new gig. Capitalization never counts with keywords, so
don’t worry about that at all.
Type a keyword and go to the corresponding AOL area.
Figure 8-1:
Almost
every area
inside AOL
has a
keyword 
for easy
navigation.
112
Part II: Settling Into Your Online Home 

To make keywords easier to use and generally more intuitive, the vast majority
of online areas respond to several alternate keywords, both with and without
punctuation. For instance, you can get to the popular Fatherhood area with
keywords Dad, Dads, Father, and Fatherhood. Likewise, the Parent-To-Parent
area pops into view by typing either Parent-to-Parent or Parent to Parent
(without the dashes).
To use a keyword, press Ctrl+K. The Keyword dialog box comes up, as shown
on the left in Figure 8-2. Type the keyword and click the Go button (or just
press Enter). If everything works as it should, America Online immediately
displays that keyword’s window. If the keyword system doesn’t recognize what
you typed, you get an Internet Search window instead, filled with results that
match (or at least sort of match) the word or phrase you put into the keyword
dialog box.
You can also type keywords into the big white text box on the navigation bar,
but you may end up somewhere you don’t expect. Unlike the Keyword dialog
box, the programming for the navigation bar assumes that you want to search
for information rather than go to a keyword. As Figure 8-2 shows, the first
choice offered by the navigation bar involved searching the Internet for items
matching homework help. As an afterthought, it also suggested going to the
Homework Help keyword, but only if you click on the Go To AOL Keyword
option.

113
Chapter 8: Navigating the System and Marking Your Favorite Destinations

Remember your favorite keywords by noting them on the Cheat Sheet in the
front of this book. Use that list as a memory jogger or to plan your online ses-
sions. As your list of beloved keywords grows (and it will, don’t worry), store
and organize them in your Favorite Places list, described in the section
“Organizing the Places of Your Heart,” later in this chapter.
Getting There Fast with QuickView
As part of their ongoing effort to help you find the coolest online places 
(and to herd everyone in roughly the same direction — toward the ads), the
America Online folks added a new tool to your navigational arsenal: the quasi-
customizable QuickView window (shown in Figure 8-3). The QuickView tab
lives at the top of the Welcome window, next to the Welcome tab. When you
click the QuickView tab, the Welcome window steps off-stage, and the rather
massive QuickView window replaces it, filled with whatever — well, mostly
whatever — you want to see.
“Wait a minute,” I hear you cry in navigational confusion. “What do you mean
quasi-customizable? And what’s with the mostly whatever crack?”
114
Part II: Settling Into Your Online Home 
Where do you find keywords? 
At keyword Keyword!
Granted, the name sounds kinda silly, but 
the ultimate keyword lists found at keyword
Keyword make the redundancy worthwhile.
This window serves up every single keyword
available on America Online (plus, unfortu-
nately, a few that aren’t found on the system
anymore — apparently the janitorial staff
doesn’t scrub the list too often).
This handy window displays three tabs across
the middle, each one leading to a different orga-
nization of the keyword list. The first tab, A-Z,
gives you a nice, simple alphabetical listing of
keywords. Given the number of keywords on
America Online (well over 13,000 the last time I
checked), wading through the straight alpha-
betical list takes a while.
The second tab, By Subject, corresponds to the
old Channels listing from AOL 8.0. Search this
list when you want to dive into the keywords
relating to a particular category. When you click
an entry in this list, the window refreshes itself
and presents you with a detailed list of key-
words related to the topic.
The By AOL Feature tab rounds out the
window’s options. All of the keywords in here
relate to America Online itself, not the service’s
content areas (such as sports, news, and quilt-
ing). Look in here when you seek keywords for
areas like Billing, Buddy Icons, Marketing
Preferences, Themes, and so on.

Unfortunately, I meant just what I said. The QuickView window, unlike the
whatever-you-want-to-put-there Favorite Places system and the My Shortcuts
do-it-yourself menu, is quasi-customizable. Yes, you select what kind of informa-
tion appears in there, but you only get to choose from a preset list of options
that America Online (in its infinite wisdom) provides. If you love the online
game shows, the AOL.COM customizable news page, or the online Yellow
Pages, then QuickView completes your life. If your tastes run toward more
unique things (like the Web-graphics or home-schooling forums), you’re out
of luck with QuickView. Instead, use either Favorite Places or My Shortcuts
for quick access to those areas.
The America Online programmers (secreted away in those massive Dulles,
Virginia, offices) assure me that they included the “most popular” online areas
in the QuickView options. Still, I wish they included an “other” entry to add
your favorite keyword or Web site. But alas, it doesn’t (at least not yet).
The first time you sign on with new America Online 9.0 software and click 
the QuickView tab, you see the default QuickView area, filled with destina-
tions probably known and loved by America Online’s Marketing department.
Replacing those with destinations that you know and love takes only a moment:
1. With your computer signed on to America Online, click the Customize
button along the top right side of the QuickView window. 
The aptly named Customize QuickView for My AOL window appears,
looking similar to Figure 8-4.
The settings for QuickView are unique to each screen name, so you need
to repeat the setup process for each screen name in your stable.
Figure 8-3:

2. Click the down-arrow next to any of the six content areas.
A drop-down menu slides into view.
3. Run your mouse through the drop-down menu until you find an area
that interests you. When you find the right topic area, click it once.
The topic takes its position in the chosen slot.
4. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 until you fill the six QuickView slots.
When each slot shows an online area that you love, it’s time to save 
your work.
If you really like the QuickView window, you can tell your America Online
software to display it instead of the Welcome window when you sign on
to the service. To do that, click the link down by Startup, in the lower-left
side of the dialog box. 
5. Click the Save button at the bottom of the window.
America Online saves the QuickView for this screen name (not for all
screen names in your account).
After the customizing dialog box disappears, QuickView displays all the con-
tent areas you selected. Depending on what you chose, you may need to click
the Refresh button (near the top of the QuickView window) before all of the
information shows correctly. 
Figure 8-4:

116
Part II: Settling Into Your Online Home 

In addition to the master customization button at the top of the QuickView
window, every individual content area has its own Edit button. Those little
buttons let you add yet another level of customization to your window by
either selecting specific stuff you like (such as types of news or specific
games) or by filling in some demographic information so the system can
make educated recommendations (in the DVD/Video and Music areas, for
instance). Spend some time playing with the options in each section to get
the most from your QuickView experience.
Organizing the Places of Your Heart
A new button is in town — and it’s appearing on a toolbar near you. Say hello
to Favorites and its sidekick, the Favorite Places window — both ride hard to
organize the online areas you know and love.
The Favorite Places system doesn’t bring any law into your digital life 
(and I hope Congress won’t either), but it promises a lot of order. Rather 
than limit yourself to just 10 destinations socked away on the My Shortcuts
menu (see Chapter 21 for the details about that) or six QuickView areas
selected from whatever America Online feels like offering, Favorite Places
stores as many locales as you want. And you get to choose them all! Is that
just too cool or what? (I know, I know — no one should get this excited about
software.)
Figure 8-5 shows a hard-working Favorite Places window in action. The heart
entries link to areas inside America Online or to Web pages on the Internet.
For example, the item highlighted in Figure 8-5 is the Senate Simulation forum
on America Online. Folders (such as Help & Safety or Gaming and Fun) apply
some order to the impending chaos.
Figure 8-5 also shows another cool feature of the America Online software:
The Favorites menu, beneath the Favorites tab. When you add an online area
to your Favorite Places, the area automatically appears in both the Favorite
Places window and the Favorites menu under the Favorites button. Because
items in both places work the same way, you end up in the same place
whether you double-click its heart entry in the Favorite Places window or
just choose the same item from the Favorites menu.

Chapter 8: Navigating the System and Marking Your Favorite Destinations

A few other random musings about the Favorite Places system wandered out
of my brain at the last moment:
 To use the Favorite Places system, you must have version 4.0 or later of
the America Online access software for Windows. Any older America
Online software just isn’t this cool.
 Even though all the items in your Favorite Places window also appear on
the Favorites menu, you can changes entries only in the Favorite Places
window. The Favorites menu notices the changes on its own, so don’t
worry about that.
 You’re not limited to the folders shown in Figure 8-5. I created those to
meet my exceedingly peculiar needs. You have the freedom — yes, even
the right and responsibility — to create equally peculiar folders for your-
self. Flip ahead to the “Adding a folder” section for more about making
your own folders.

Using folders in the Favorite 
Places window
I almost forgot to mention this, but two of my brain cells, spurred into action
by the caloric heat of a half-digested Oreo, reminded me that double-clicking
is the key to using the Favorite Places window:
 To open a folder, double-click it.
 To close the folder after you’re finished with it, double-click the folder
again.
 To visit a favorite place, double-click it.
Flip back into single-clicking mode when you’re using the Favorites menu on
the toolbar. Because it’s a menu and not a list of items in a window, you click
once to choose destinations there.
Adding a favorite place
Including a new favorite place is a cinch. You can do so in two ways: the Easy
Way and the Other Way. This section tells you how to handle them both.
The Easy Way is for areas inside America Online or Internet-based Web pages
and gophers you browsed your way into:
1. Display an area you’re fond of, either inside America Online or on 
the Internet.
2. Click the big heart icon in the window’s upper-right corner.
A little dialog box appears, demanding to know what you intend to do
with the link to this online area.
Not every window in America Online has one of those cute little heart
icons. It’s unfortunate but true. If the window you’re looking at doesn’t
have one, you can’t add it to the Favorite Places list.
3. Click the Add to Favorites button to include an entry for this online
area on your Favorite Places list.
A list of folders in your Favorite Places list appears next to the dialog
box, as shown in Figure 8-6.
119
Chapter 8: Navigating the System and Marking Your Favorite Destinations

4. To store this item in a certain folder, click the folder name in the pop-
up list. To simply throw the item into the Favorite Places list, click the
Favorite Places entry (the first one on the list).
Wherever you choose to store the item, your new entry takes up resi-
dence in both the Favorite Places window and the Favorites menu.
If you click the Insert in Instant Message button, a new Instant Message
window appears, complete with a ready-to-use link to this favorite place.
Clicking Insert in Mail does much the same thing, except that a blank
e-mail message pops up, with the link in the body and a friendly Check
This Out notice on the Subject line.
Use the Other Way when someone dashes up and says, “I just found the neat-
est Web page — you gotta check it out!” The Other Way assumes that you
have the address of a Web page and want to include it manually in your list 
of favorite places:
1. Click the My Favorites button on the toolbar.
The Favorite Places window appears.
2. Click the folder in which you want to store the new item.
If you don’t know where to put the item, click the Favorite Places folder
at the top of the window. That’s as good a place as any — and you can
always move the entry somewhere else later.

3. At the bottom of the Favorite Places window, click New.
The Add New Folder/Favorite Place dialog box appears, with the New
Favorite Place option already selected. (Isn’t it nice when the software
does something useful for you?)
4. In the Enter the Place’s Description box, type a name for this entry
and press Tab. 
5. In the Enter the Internet Address box, type the entry’s address.
Figure 8-7 displays a finished entry, ready to be saved for posterity.
6. Click OK to add the entry to your Favorite Places window.
Adding a folder
Adding all kinds of favorite places to your system is great, but you need some
organization to keep everything in order. That’s why those clever America
Online programmers included folders.
Folders can live in the Favorite Places area or inside other folders (see 
Figure 8-8). Either way, creating a folder is easy.

Chapter 8: Navigating the System and Marking Your Favorite Destinations

Here’s how:
1. Click the My Favorites button on the toolbar.
The Favorite Places window pops to attention.
2. At the top of the window, click the Favorite Places folder.
The Favorite Places folder is highlighted (this is a good sign).
3. Click New.
The Add New Folder/Favorite Place dialog box appears on your screen
(another good sign).
4. Click the New Folder option.
The dialog box suddenly shrinks to half its previous size, shedding those
unwanted pounds and inches in no time at all.
5. Click in the Enter the New Folder’s Name text box, and then type the
name of your new folder. Click OK when you’re finished.
Your new folder appears at the bottom of the Favorite Places list.
6. Move the folder to wherever you want it in the list.
If you’re not sure how to move the folder, look in the next section.
Moving folders and favorite places
Creating folders and favorite places is one thing, but organizing them is
another. The little buggers tend to land wherever the America Online software
feels like putting them. However, moving them around is easy after you get
the hang of it.
The technique is the same for both folders and favorite places. After you
open the Favorite Places window, follow these steps:
1. Decide which item you want to move and where it’s headed.
2. Put the mouse pointer on the chosen item and press and hold the
mouse button.
3. While holding down the mouse button, move the item to its destination
and then release the mouse button.
The item settles down, safe and sound in its new home.

Modifying folders and favorite places
In every life, there comes a point when it’s time to make some changes. 
When that time in the life of your Favorite Places window arrives, have no
fear. Although change is never fun, at least it’s easy in the Favorite Places
window. 
Open the Favorite Places window and then follow these steps:
1. Click the folder or favorite place and then click the Edit button.
For a folder, the Rename dialog box appears. For a favorite place, the
description and Internet address dialog box appear.
2. Make your changes (usually to the name of the item).
If you change your mind and don’t want to make any changes, double-
click the upper-left corner of the box.
3. Click OK.
Deleting folders and favorite places
Favorite Places entries, like other impetuous flashes in the dark sky of fading
youth, have a limited life span. When the time to delete an entry comes, just
do the deed and go on as best as you can. Solemnly open the Favorite Places
window, and then morosely proceed through the following steps:
1. Click the item you want to delete.
2. Click the Delete button.
3. In the pop-up dialog box, click OK. 
The entry is no more. Remember, ask not for whom the Delete button clicks —
it clicks for thy once-favorite place.

G
athering your buddies for a quick chat always adds fun to the day. After
all, what would your life have been like these past few years without
your best friends? When you meet new friends on America Online, you can
keep track of their screen names with the AOL Buddy List feature and avoid
the frustrating experience of meeting a new best friend one day and losing
him or her the next — all because you forgot your friend’s name!
This chapter explores the world of digital friend tracking, including creating,
adding to, and deleting from your America Online Buddy List. In case you find
yourself in a talkative mood, you also find out how to send instant messages
to your buddies and gather them for a cozy private chat.
Who’s Your Buddy?
At a glance, the Buddy List tells you which of your friends are online. It even
organizes your buddies into groups, making the task of discerning the office
crowd from the gang at last week’s online Jell-O diving competition an easy
one. (After all, the difference may be important, even if a few names overlap.)
By default, every time you sign on to America Online, your Buddy List jumps
into action, hanging out in the upper-right corner of the screen. (If you don’t
want the list to always come up, you can adjust the Buddy List’s behavior with
the Buddy List preferences, covered later in this chapter.) As your buddies sign
on and off the system, the list updates automatically. Table 9-1 shows how the
Buddy List marks screen names as they arrive, depart, and generally hang
around America Online.

If the Buddy List shows a tiny picture next to your friend’s screen name, shows
the screen name in a strange font, or fancies up the letters in delightful color,
that means your friend personalized his or her instant messages with a Buddy
icon. You can snazz up your name the same way in a couple of easy steps. Start
at keyword My Expressions, to customize your Buddy icon, buddy wallpaper,
buddy sound, and smiley set. To change how your screen name appears in the
Buddy List, try keyword Format Screen Name. This window offers several
fonts, plus a wild variety of color combinations (including my favorites, Ocean
Waves and Rainbow).
Because of all the new instant message features added in the 9.0 software
(such as talk, file transfer, instant images, and video), the programmers also
bestowed a new trick to the Buddy List. By moving your mouse pointer over
any name on your Buddy List, the 9.0 software displays a little dialog box
about that person. The box shows the buddy’s icon, offers single-click e-mail
writing, e-mail searching, and instant messaging. Better still, the bottom of
the little dialog box shows your buddy’s software capabilities — what your
friend’s copy of America Online (or AIM, for the non-AOL members out there)
lets them do. This feature simply and easily resolves the whole problem of
your trying to do something cool — like a Video Messenger session — with a
friend, but everybody getting frustrated because the friend’s software couldn’t
make the cool thing happen. Now you know exactly what your friend can do
right from the start. What a deal!
The following sections cover all the important stuff you need to know 
about building, using, and changing Buddy Lists on America Online. For 
information about privacy preferences and Buddy List preferences, see the
“Privacy Preferences: Please, I Vahnt to Be Alone” and “Tweaking Your Buddy
List Preferences” sections, later in this chapter.
What if some of your friends don’t use America Online? Are they lost forever?
Goodness no! Tell your Internet-based friends about the cool AOL Instant
Messenger program (better known as AIM), which lets them send and receive
instant messages, create a Buddy List, and do many other nifty tricks. Find
out all the details at keyword AIM (or www.aim.com for your Net-dot-friends).

Adding someone to a Buddy List
Including people on the Buddy List is a snap. Here’s how to do it:
1. In the Buddy List window, click the Setup button.
The Buddy List Setup window appears, just like the one shown in 
Figure 9-1.
If your Buddy List window isn’t already on-screen, choose Community➪
Buddy List from the menu or use keyword Buddy to summon it. From
there, click the Setup button and keep going through the steps.
2. Scroll through the list of names, click once on the name of the Buddy
List group you want to bulk up with a new member, and then click the
Add Buddy button.
The Add New Buddy window hops on the screen, looking as bright and
chipper as ever. If you accidentally click twice on a Buddy List group,
don’t worry. That just tells America Online to temporarily hide the screen
names in that group. Double-click the group name again, and — poof! —
the screen names appear once more.
To create a new section in your Buddy List, see the “Creating a Buddy
List group” section later in this chapter.
3. In the Enter New Buddy’s Screen Name box, type the screen name of
your buddy and then press Enter.
Figure 9-1:

127
Chapter 9: Where’s Your Buddy? Where’s Your Pal?

The little dialog box disappears as your buddy’s screen name takes its
place in the Buddies in Group area.
If your buddy’s mobile phone uses the Short Message Service (or SMS)
feature, you can also send an instant message straight to the phone. To
do that, choose the Cell Phone Number option in this box and then type
the phone number (with area code — just like you normally enter phone
numbers) into the dialog box. After pressing Enter, a second dialog box
appears, asking you to enter a name (or some other identifying text) to
use for this item’s entry in your Buddy List. Type something clever like
Hanks mobile, and then click the OK button. Once in your Buddy List,
this item appears with quotation marks around the name and a little cell
phone icon to the side. (How cute!)
4. Repeat Step 3 until all your buddies land in there. 
5. After finishing the list, close the Buddy List Setup window.
The Buddy List Setup dialog box poofs away, leaving you ready to
wander America Online as you want.
Adding a buddy from an instant message
The easiest way to add buddies to your list is to include them while you chat
using IM. This is so simple to do that it’s almost worth sending instant mes-
sages to your friends just so you can add them to your Buddy List. Here’s the
lowdown:
1. Connect with your buddy through the instant message system.
It’s not important who sends the first message. You simply need an Instant
Message window with IM To: (your friend’s screen name) open
and active.
2. Click the Buddy Info button at the bottom of the Instant Message
window.
The Buddy Info window appears, displaying a bunch of available options.
3. Click the Add to My Buddy List button.
The Add to Buddy List window appears, showing you the Buddy List
groups you already created. At this point, you can drop your buddy into
an existing group, or select the Create a New Buddy List Group option
and fill in the new group name into the accompanying box.
4. Select an existing Buddy List group, or click the Create a New Buddy
List Group button and name the group. Then click Save.
128
Part II: Settling Into Your Online Home 

Whichever option you choose, AOL drops your buddy into that list and
presents a helpful dialog box informing you that your buddy is now part
of your Buddy List. 
5. Click OK to make the dialog box go away. 
That’s it! Trust me — this takes a whole lot longer to explain than it does to
do. After you work through the steps once or twice, adding a friend to your
Buddy List through the IM window becomes almost second nature. 
Creating a Buddy List group
What if you recently met a whole slew of new people in a particular chat room,
on a message board, or through an e-mail mailing list? You can keep track of
your entourage the easy way by creating a unique Buddy List just for them:
1. In the Buddy List window, click the Setup button.
The Buddy List Setup window appears, eagerly awaiting your new 
creation.
2. Click the Add Group button to make a new Buddy List and add 
people to it.
The Add New Group dialog box hops onto the screen, ready to accept
your creative effort.
3. In the Add New Group box, type a name (16 letters or fewer works
great, but you can go up to 48 letters) for the new list and then press
Enter.
Your new Buddy List group appears in the Buddy List Setup window
(and in your Buddy List window as well). Because the group is new, it
contains no buddies. This kind of thing depresses the Buddy List soft-
ware, so take a moment and add your friends’ screen names to the list.
(When in doubt, never upset your software. Be kind and gentle with it,
and it may consider doing the same for you.)
4. Click the Add Buddy button, type your friend’s screen name in the
dialog box, and then press Enter.
Your buddy’s screen name takes its place in the Buddies in Group area.
5. Repeat Step 4 until all your buddies are in there.
6. When you finish, close the Buddy List Setup window.
The Buddy List dialog box proudly displays an entry for your new list
(see Figure 9-2).
129
Chapter 9: Where’s Your Buddy? Where’s Your Pal?

Make sure you spell your friends’ screen names correctly when you drop them
in your Buddy List. The software doesn’t check to ensure that the screen
names are correctly spelled and active. So, if you create a list with a bunch of
buddies who never seem to show up online, you may want to double-check
the spellings. 
Deleting someone from a Buddy List group
Sad to say, but sometimes buddies become ex-buddies. Your interests change,
their interests change, and suddenly you no longer correspond. Or maybe a
friend simply changed screen names, which means that you need to add his
or her new screen name and delete the old one. Whether deleting a buddy
from a Buddy List group is traumatic or transitional, AOL provides you with 
a way to do the job:
1. In the Buddy List window, click the Setup button.
The Buddy List Setup window appears.
If your Buddy List window doesn’t appear, keyword Buddy brings the
Buddy List window to attention.
2. Scroll through the list of Buddy groups and screen names to find the
passé or absent friend, and click once on the friend’s screen name.
Figure 9-2:
The Quilters

130
Part II: Settling Into Your Online Home 

The screen name is highlighted, as if it knows something bad may
happen to it soon.
3. Delete your buddy’s screen name from the list by clicking the Delete
button. Reassure the software that you know what you’re doing by
clicking Yes when the Are You Really Sure About This dialog box 
pops into view.
The buddy’s screen name disappears from sight and from the Buddy
group, as well. If for some reason you decide that deleting this buddy
was all a hasty mistake, click No to keep your friend in the Buddy group.
4. Click the X button in the upper-right corner of the window to make
the dialog box go away.
The Buddy List Setup window departs the scene. You’re now ready to
continue life with America Online.
Deleting an entire Buddy List group
Once a year or so, you probably get the urge to clean house (at least that’s
the way it works here). When the cleaning bug hits, take a look at your Buddy
List groups and see whether the window needs a bit of tidying. If you’re hang-
ing on to Buddy List groups that contain no members, groups that track 
outdated interests, or lists of e-mail business addresses for the job you left 
18 months ago, a little window cleaning may be in order. Here’s what to do:
1. In your Buddy List window, click the Setup button to display the
Buddy List Setup window.
If your Buddy List window isn’t handily on-screen, use keyword Buddy
to bring the Buddy List Setup window to life.
2. To highlight the Buddy List group that you want to discard forever,
click its entry in the list. Then seal the list’s fate by clicking the Delete
button.
A small dialog box worriedly rushes to your screen, asking whether you
truly want to delete the Buddy List group.
To set Buddy List groups apart from screen names, the groups appear in
the list in a bold font with a tiny plus sign next to them.
3. Click Yes in the Are You Sure dialog box, and then close the Buddy
List Setup window to finish the process.
The Buddy List control window adjusts to the change, displaying one less
Buddy List group in its collection.
131
Chapter 9: Where’s Your Buddy? Where’s Your Pal?

Be very sure that you want to delete a Buddy List group before you click Yes
to delete the list. If you mistakenly delete the wrong list, you have to re-create
that Buddy List group from scratch. Did this already happen to you? (If so,
I’m very sorry.) See the “Creating a Buddy List group” section, earlier in this
chapter.
Renaming a Buddy List group
Suppose that you woke up this morning and realized that last night’s dream
gave you the perfect name for one of your existing Buddy List groups. Never
fear — changing that Buddy List name is a snap:
1. In the Buddy List window, click the Setup button to display the Buddy
List Setup window.
If your Buddy List window is hiding from you, keyword Buddy calls the
Buddy List Setup window to your screen.
2. Right-click the Buddy List group that you want to rename, and then
pick Rename from the pop-up menu.
A Rename box jumps to attention, looking like it does everywhere else
inside Windows. (These programs lack even the most basic creativity
sometimes!)
132
Part II: Settling Into Your Online Home 
Watch carefully — it even does tricks!
Now that you have these cool, new Buddy List
groups, what do you do with them? Well, plenty!
Want to know where your friend is hanging out
online? Find your buddy fast by right-clicking his
or her screen name, and then picking Locate
Buddy from the menu that appears. This option
works just like the regular Locate Member
Online option (the same one you get with the
Ctrl+L key combination). Locate Buddy tells you
whether your buddy is signed on to America
Online and whether he or she is in a chat room.
If your buddy is in a publicly available chat
room, the Locate dialog box also offers a handy
Go button that whisks you away to join your
buddy’s chat.
Quickly send your friend an instant message by
double-clicking his or her screen name. An
Instant Message window opens on-screen with
your friend’s screen name already filled in.
If you had a more face-to-face discussion in
mind, use the Buddy Chat feature to invite your
buddy to a private chat room with the two of you
(and whomever else you want to invite). See the
“Building an Online Treehouse with Buddy Chat”
section, later in this chapter, for all the details.

3. Type the new name for your Buddy List group.
Choose a name that’s representative of the entire group or one that helps
you remember why you placed these screen names together, such as the
license number of your first car (after all, it’s your list).
4. Press Enter to make your changes a reality. Finish the process by 
closing the Buddy List Setup window.
If you glance at your Buddy List window, you see an updated window
that proudly displays your new Buddy List group name.
Privacy Preferences: Please, 
I Vahnt to Be Alone
You don’t have to be a movie star to want privacy every now and then. Some-
times, you just want to get away from it all and enjoy a little peace and quiet.
That’s why the Buddy List system includes a collection of privacy preferences.
If you don’t want people to track your screen name with a Buddy List, that’s
easy to set up. Here’s what to do:
1. In the Buddy List window, click Setup.
The Buddy List Setup window appears on-screen. If your Buddy List
window isn’t visible, use keyword Buddy to bring it on the screen.
2. Click the IM Settings check box.
The Buddy List Settings window ambles onto the scene, ready to assist.
3. Click the Privacy and Security tab.
The Privacy and Security portion of the window jumps to the screen,
looking very similar to the one shown in Figure 9-3.
Although it looks rather daunting, this window makes a lot more sense
when you break it into parts. The left side of the window shows two long-
winded section names: Choose the Your Privacy Settings options and
the People I’ve Blocked in the Above Preferences options. Each section
contains several options, which let you choose a feature from a list of
possibilities; clicking one option turns off the others. On the right side,
you find the instant message security settings, a new feature in the 
9.0 software.
133
Chapter 9: Where’s Your Buddy? Where’s Your Pal?

4. Select the privacy level you prefer:
• To completely block yourself from Buddy Lists all over America
Online (including AOL Instant Messenger users on the Internet),
select the Block All option.
• To either allow or prevent a few members from tracking you on
their Buddy Lists, first select one these options: Allow Only People
on My Buddy List, Allow Only These Users, or Block Only These
Users. To type the acceptable (or unacceptable, depending on
your setting) screen name list, click the link next to the appropri-
ate option. A Create a Custom list dialog box appears. At this point,
enter either the Enter Screen Name or IM Address box, and type
the specific screen names you want to block or allow. Finally, click
Add. Add as many screen names as you want to block (or allow).
Click Save when you finish the project.
• To block only AOL Instant Messenger users from communicating
with you from the Internet, select the Block Internet Users option.
5. Decide whether to apply these preferences for Buddy Lists only or for
Buddy Lists, instant messages, and AOL Instant Greetings.
I recommend using the Buddy List setting rather than the bigger Buddy
Lists, AOL Greeting Instant Messages option. The latter option is best if
you want to strictly limit who can see you with a Buddy List or send you
instant messages.
6. Turn your attention to the right side of the window, and pick your
Security Settings. 
The two settings in the middle of the list (displaying the names of people
sending Internet IMs and automatic reminders about direct connection
IM features like file transfer and talk) both enhance your online security,
so I recommend leaving them turned on. If you share a lot of files with
people via IM, make sure you turn on the virus scanning software option
at the bottom of the list.

7. After finishing the various settings, click Save.
The Buddy List Preferences dialog box silently departs the scene, without
so much as a whimper about saving your work. Don’t worry — if you
clicked Save, America Online really did catch your settings.
8. Click the X button in the upper-right corner of the Buddy List
Preferences window to close it.
Continue with your regularly scheduled online experience, free from
unwanted interruptions.
Tweaking Your Buddy List Settings
Some days, you want sound in your world; other days, the mere thought of
extra noise makes your head pound. Alter your general Buddy List Settings to
match your mood. Opt for or against sounds when your buddies come and go,
and tell the system whether you want to see your Buddy List every time you
sign on.
To fiddle with your Buddy List settings, follow these steps:
1. Go to keyword Buddy List Settings.
The Buddy List Settings window appears, with the General Buddy tab
already selected. Isn’t software helpful when it wants to be?
2. Look through the settings in the window and make changes according
to your mood.
Each of the settings pretty much explains itself. In a flush of helpfulness,
the America Online developers added explanatory links next to most of
the items, so if something doesn’t make sense, click the What Is link next
to it for a decent description.
Most of the time, you want to leave all the options in here turned on
(with check marks in the boxes). The second one in the list, Add People
I Send IMs To, gets a little annoying after a while, because it just keeps
packing more and more screen names onto your Buddy List. Of all the
options in here, I suggest turning that one off.
3. After making all the changes to your Buddy List settings, click Save.
America Online returns you to wherever you were.
To add a buddy icon and custom buddy sound to your own instant messages,
go into the My Expressions area at keyword My Expressions. The four options
in that window cover your buddy icon, IM Wallpaper, Smiley theme, and IM
sounds.

Chapter 9: Where’s Your Buddy? Where’s Your Pal?

Building an Online Treehouse 
with Buddy Chat
Instant message conversations have their place, but for extended chatter,
using the AOL chat rooms is better. Chat rooms offer a larger text area for
scrolling messages and the ability to talk to more than one person at a time.
With the America Online Buddy Chat feature, the system quickly creates a
private chat room and invites the members you choose as well as any other
friends you decide to include manually at the last moment. This feature works
only when your friends are signed on, so don’t try chatting with people who
aren’t there. If you do, someone may offer you a nice, padded computer, com-
plete with a very special room of your own!
Extra! Extra! This news just in!! Buddy Chats now work with both America
Online members and AIM users! Yep, that’s right — draw your friends from 
all over the online world into a Buddy Chat room near you. (In case you 
wondered, AIM users still can’t do regular America Online People Connection
rooms. Such is life.)
Here’s how you create a Buddy Chat of your own:
1. In your Buddy List, select the name of a buddy you want to chat with.
Then in the Buddy List window, click the Buddy Chat button. (To invite
more than one person, click the next name and then click the Buddy
Chat button. Continue until you feel tired or overwhelmed by the
number of people you know.)
The Buddy Chat window appears. AOL fills in the screen name of your
selected buddy, and the name appears in the Screen Names to Invite box.
To invite a whole group full of buddies, click a Buddy Group entry (such
as Family or Friends) instead of clicking a single buddy’s screen name.
Everybody in the group automatically gets an invitation.
2. Alter the listed screen names as much as you like by erasing names
and filling in others.
Invite as few as one person or as many as you can reasonably fit into a
chat room and still have a good time. (Remember, only 23 people, includ-
ing you, fit into a chat room.) You’re free to add any America Online or
AIM screen name to your Buddy Chat List, even if that name isn’t in your
Buddy List.
136
Part II: Settling Into Your Online Home 

3. In the Message to Send box, type a reason for getting together.
AOL helpfully starts your message with You are invited to: —
either complete it or replace it with a phrase of your own.
Some invitations, such as You are invited to clean the pool, tend
to turn people off. Spend a few seconds on your invitation to make it
sound appealing if you want your friends to attend your chat.
4. Change any (or all) of the chat room names to make them friendlier.
The Location text box suggests rather arcane chat room names; usually
Chat with about 20 numbers tacked on the end. For a good start to your
chatting experience, change the name to something a little more note-
worthy and interesting.
AOL chooses these chat room names to minimize the chance of having
someone you don’t know drop in to your private chat room. If you change
the chat room name to something more generic, such as I love dogs
or Jane, you may receive a surprise visitor every now and then as some-
one else thinks up your chat room name. If this happens, simply tell the
person that you’re sorry, but that chat room name is already taken. Most
of the time, the person leaves as quickly as he or she came. If the person
doesn’t leave, click his or her screen name in the People Here list and then
click the Eject Member button. That solves the problem rather elegantly.
5. After adding, altering, and amending your invitation to your heart’s
content, click Send.
Your Buddy Chat invitation wings its way to your friends.
To ensure that you’re not forgotten, AOL drops you right into your new
chat room. After hopping into the room, you find that it works much like
a normal private chat — mostly because it is a type of private chat room.
(For a quick refresher on private chat rooms, flip to Chapter 12.) The
invitation also features an IM button for sending a quick instant message
back to the person who sent the Buddy Chat (namely you, in this case).
You may receive an instant message from a buddy in a teasing mood or
from someone who had a momentary brain lapse on your screen name’s
identity.
6. Greet your buddies as they drop in to the room and have a great 
conversation!
If any friends use an AIM-based messaging system, you can Buddy Chat with
them as well. Treat their screen names just like regular AOL names, and every-
thing works just the way it should. Ain’t technology grand?

In This Chapter
 Getting to know AOL’s newest desktop tool
 Taking the Companion for a spin
 Choosing the parts that you like best
E
verybody wants somebody, some time — or at least that’s how the old
crooner tune goes. The sentiment particularly holds true in today’s online
world. Despite the many places to go, things to do, and ways to utterly lose
an afternoon on the trip, wandering the Net remains a lonely business. If only
you had a traveling partner to share the ride. Nothing fancy, mind you — just
a friendly piece of software that helps you find neat stuff, keeps tabs on the
latest news, checks your e-mail box, and even watches for incoming instant
messages.
As if delivered to your desktop by the fated winds of chance — or, more to the
point, by the technical prowess of a few folks on the AOL development team —
America Online’s new 9.0 software includes just such a cohort for your jour-
ney. Ladies and gentlemen, meet your new counterpart: the AOL Companion.
Covering everything from e-mail to the local weather forecast, the AOL
Companion supplies tools galore for simplifying your online excursions. (And
it’s blue, too — blue looks cool.) This chapter digs through the Companion’s
many features and services, ensuring that you get the most from this incredi-
ble little tool. Starting with the Companion’s three size settings and working
onward through its content and customization choices, the chapter covers
your new software accessory from top to bottom.

Although everybody gets a copy of the AOL Companion automatically with
the America Online 9.0 software, the folks who use a high-speed, always-on
Internet connection really get the most from Companion’s features. If you
access AOL through a modem, don’t despair — take a look at this chapter’s
sidebar for some ideas about putting the Companion to work in your world.
Meeting the Companion
There it sits on the desktop, looking small, cute, and blue. The first time you
saw it, you probably wondered if some part of the America Online software
simply escaped and set up shop at the edge of your screen. But it’s not an
escapee — the folks at AOL actually put the little fellow there. That’s the AOL
Companion, the newest tool in America Online’s continuing quest to sit at the
center of your online world.
For the ultimate in flexibility (and possibly as a programmer’s silent nod to his
love of superhero comics), the Companion appears in three different forms,
each with its own superb powers. Figure 10-1 shows the little fellow in his
three poses:
 Small layout: Think of the Small layout as the minimized Companion.
The Companion displays only basic information — namely, the number
of e-mail inbox messages awaiting your attention, the number of instant
message sessions currently happening in your software — and a search
box to find stuff on the Web. You can make the layout even smaller by
right-clicking anywhere on the Companion, selecting Minimized Options
from the pop-up menu, and turning off your choice of Mail Count, Instant
Message Count, and Search Field. (If you shut them all down, the
Companion gets really small.) Windows 2000 and Windows XP get an extra
treat from the Companion’s programmers: When minimized, the compan-
ion turns translucent so you can park it on top of a program and still see
both the Companion and your application. How’s that for a cool feature?
 Large layout: In this form, the Companion displays your current (or most
recent) screen name signed on to AOL. Along the top, it tells you the date
(a handy detail under many circumstances), and at the bottom, it offers
Settings and Help options. In addition to these options, the Companion
shows off its scrolling bar of handy-dandy information tools. For all of the
details about each tool, see the next section. Switch between the Large
and Small layouts by clicking in the little Maximize button at the top of
the Companion window.
 Expanded layout: After clicking one of the Companion tools, the soft-
ware flips into its expanded form, complete with a little whssipp sound
to celebrate the change. Companion uses the extra space for displaying
whatever information you selected — the weather, your Buddy List, the
140
Part II: Settling Into Your Online Home 

top headlines, and such. To manually expand the Companion, click the
tiny triangle button on the left side of the tool area. Click the same
button (now a tiny triangle pointing in the opposite direction) to col-
lapse the Companion back to its large layout form.
The Companion performs its other big trick when an instant message hits
your AOL software. The moment the message arrives, the Companion pops a
small dialog box into the lower corner of your screen (as shown in Figure 10-2)
telling you who sent the message and previewing the first part of its text.

Chapter 10: AOL Companion: Something Small, Blue, and Useful

Companion works best when you use its Always on Top feature to let it share
screen real estate with your other open applications. To do that, switch the
companion to its large layout (click the Companion’s Maximize button), and
then click the Settings button. On the drop-down Settings menu, make sure a
check mark appears next to Always On Top. If that option isn’t checked, click
it. The menu disappears, but AOL caught your choice — really. To make sure,
click the Settings button again and look for the check mark.
Covering the Basics
The AOL Companion doesn’t just sit there on the desktop and look cute all day.
(Well, it does look cute, but it accomplishes things, too.) Working with your
America Online software, the Companion lets you sign on to AOL and then
switch away to other tasks, safe in the knowledge that whether new e-mail
arrives or someone pops an instant message at you, the whole America Online
world rests only a click away — regardless of what other program you’re using.
Here’s how the Companion puts your favorite AOL features at your fingertips
while you’re signed on to AOL:
 Check your mail (small or large layout): Click the mailbox icon in the
companion, and the America Online software automatically appears. A
moment after that, your mailbox magically opens, displaying your current
incoming e-mail.
 Converse through instant messages (small or large layout): When
someone sends you an instant message, the Companion does several
things at the same time. First, it displays the message in a little pop-up
window (the window shown in Figure 10-2). After that, it increments the
IM counter and adds a talk bubble next to the Instant Message button on
the Companion (see Figure 10-3). If you hover the mouse over the bubble,
the Companion tells you who sent your most recent IM and repeats the
first few words of the message. Click the bubble to list everybody you’re
currently chatting with through instant messages. 
 Switch screen names with a quick click (large layout only): Click 
the down-arrow next to your screen name, select Switch SN from the
drop-down menu, and then click the Go button. The AOL software hops
to the screen, offering the Switch Screen Names window — just as if you
chose Sign Off➪Switch Screen Name from the AOL main menu. 
 Configure the Companion: For such a small thing, the Companion
includes a lot of settings. Right-click anywhere on the Companion to pop
up its settings menu. From there, you can add or remove content, turn
its sound on or off, and adjust whether or not it sits atop everything else
on your screen. Clicking the Settings button with the Companion in its
large layout leads to the same menu. 
142
Part II: Settling Into Your Online Home 

The Companion counts your e-mail and accesses your instant messages only
when you’re currently signed onto AOL. When you sign off the system, you
sign off the system, just like you always did — Companion doesn’t change
that behavior. At that point, the Companion stops counting your e-mail,
neglects your instant messages, and forgets your Favorite Places. But the
moment you sign back on, the Companion immediately leaps into action.
If the Companion shows zeros for both e-mail and instant message counters,
either you didn’t sign on to your AOL software yet or you joined the Witness
Relocation Program and nobody knows how to find you. After signing onto
AOL, the Companion updates the counters automatically as new messages
arrive.

Chapter 10: AOL Companion: Something Small, Blue, and Useful
Do dialup members really care 
about the Companion?
Like an emotionally scarred mouse lovingly
dropped at your feet as a love gift from the
family cat, AOL 9.0 plopped the Companion onto
the desktop of your modem-bound computer.
You cast a wary eye toward the bequest, trying
hard to say something nice, but all the while
wondering what on earth drove your software
(or your cat) to do this.
Although the Companion works just fine through
a dialup account, do you care? After all, you
probably don’t leave your America Online
account signed on for hours at a time, tying up
your phone line as you plow through all kinds of
non-Internet computer tasks.
Like so many things in life, the answer to this
burning question is it depends. Maybe you do
stay on the system for hours upon hours, listen-
ing to AOL Radio as you whack away at the
Great American Novel. If that’s you, then yes,
the Companion might just change your life. If
you rarely venture outside the AOL software
from the moment you sign on until you sign back
off, the Companion probably won’t affect your
world one bit. 
But look on the bright side — the Companion
doesn’t hurt, either.

Flipping Through the Tools
Whether or not you fell in love with the Companion’s e-mail and IM tricks,
there’s plenty to like among its 11 tools. By delivering quick information fixes
with a single click, the Companion starts shoehorning its way into your online
life from the first time you use it.
Following is a list of the Companion’s current tools. My contacts in 
America Online’s development team say that they plan plenty of additions
to Companion’s paraphernalia, so don’t be surprised if your tool strip shows
a few more icons. In that case, just move the mouse pointer over the unknown
icon and let the Companion pop up a tiny window telling what that item does.
If a particular tool works only when you’re signed on with AOL, I noted that
in the description. All other tools work both inside and outside the America
Online software.
Without further ado, here’s your tool rundown, in the order they appear
inside the Companion:
Also on AOL
Must sign on. I think the marketing department
added this one at the last moment. It randomly adver-
tises various AOL features. Unfortunately, only the
marketing folks care.
Address Book
Must sign on. Peruse your AOL Address Book, look
up anything and everything you stored in there, and
then compose an e-mail message with a single click.
Dictionary
Look up unknown words and phrases, check the the-
saurus, or see the word of the day.
Favorite Places 
Must sign on. See your Favorite Places without
opening the Favorite Places menu in your America
Online software. Visit any site on the list by double-
clicking it.
Movie Listings
See when and where your favorite movie currently
appears in your hometown (or any hometown for that
matter).
Top News
Pick up the hottest headlines, straight from the wires.
The Companion lists the headlines whether or not
you’re currently signed onto America Online, but you
can read the stories only while signed on.
144
Part II: Settling Into Your Online Home 

Weather
View the five-day extended forecast for your neigh-
borhood.
Yellow Pages
Need to find a plumber or veterinarian fast? (Hmm . . .
sounds like the cat flushed itself down the loo again.)
Click the Yellow Pages tool, type the business you
want, and let the AOL Companion do the rest.
Search
Scour the Net for stuff that amuses, amazes, and
augments your existence.
Map
Looking for directions? Type the address in here 
and — poof! — a perfect map appears. And you
don’t even need to fold it when you’re finished.
Horoscopes
Peer toward the stars and see airplanes pass over-
head — er, get silly observations from a person who
obviously had someone else in mind.
Buddy List
Must sign on. See who’s online right now. Double-
click a name to switch back to the AOL software and
send the person an instant message.
As long as you stay signed on to AOL, the Companion flips you back to the
America Online software every time you click one of the tools. After signing
off AOL, the AOL-specific tools go away (either disappearing entirely or turn-
ing gray). Clicking the remaining tools opens your default Web browser, prob-
ably Microsoft Internet Explorer or AOL’s Netscape.

I
n my humble opinion, e-mail is the communications medium of the millen-
nium. It seems as if everybody has an e-mail account at the office, at home,
or both. Messages travel quickly, arrive safely, and rarely get delayed by any
of the obscure national holidays that shut down the post office so frequently.
Through America Online, you can send e-mail to virtually anyone on the planet.
(No, I’m not kidding — I’m not even exaggerating.) One way or another, your
e-mail message flies on the wings of technology from your online mailbox to
its destination, whether the message is headed to another America Online
e-mail box or to an Internet e-mail address.
This chapter tells you how to join in the fun, from sending Internet mail to
organizing your incoming messages. No matter what you want to know about
e-mail and America Online, this chapter is the place to look.

Sending E-Mail to an America 
Online Subscriber
You’re surrounded by other America Online subscribers every time you sign
on. So, the odds are good that you’ll send at least a few messages to some of
these people. That’s what the e-mail system was designed for in the first place,
so trading messages with other members is pretty easy. The mail system also
has some special features, such as unsend, that work only when you’re writ-
ing to another America Online person. (If unsending a message sounds inter-
esting, check out the “Stupid mail tricks” sidebar, later in this chapter.)
Before sending e-mail to someone, you must know the person’s screen name.
Upper- and lowercase don’t matter, but spelling does. For example, you could
enter my screen name as JKaufeld or jkaufeld, and the mail still goes through.
But if you try JKaufield, don’t expect a reply — at least not from me —
because the name is misspelled.
150
Part III: Connecting and Communicating 
Stupid mail tricks
As though allowing you to send e-mail to anyone
on America Online wasn’t enough, those zany
programmers threw in some extra features
designed to make your mind do loops. Look for
these options along the bottom of the Mailbox
window or in the pop-up menu. (Right-click a
mail message’s entry in the online mailbox to
see the menu.)
 Status (button): Want to see whether your
buddies have read their mail lately or are
just ignoring you? Click the Sent Mail tab.
Then click the mail message you sent and
click the Status button. America Online
returns a dialog box with the screen name
of the person who read the letter and the
time and date it was read. If the message is
still in unread limbo, the time and date are
replaced with (not yet read). Status
works for messages sent only to America
Online members. 
 Unsend (button): If you send a message that
you quickly regret, America Online lets you
reach through the system and pretend that
the message never happened — as long as
the other person hasn’t read it yet. To unsend
a message, open your mailbox and click the
Sent Mail tab. Find the message you’re
embarrassed about, click it, and then click
the Unsend button. A dialog box appears,
asking if you really want to unsend the mes-
sage. Click Yes. If the message hasn’t been
read yet, America Online yanks it from the
other person’s e-mail basket and throws the
message away. If the person has read the
message, it’s truly too late — Unsend won’t
work now. Unsend also doesn’t work for mail
sent to Internet addresses.

Before sending your first few messages, take a second to look through these
tips and suggestions for making your e-mail stand head and shoulders above
the crowd:
 Crafting good e-mail messages takes a little different writing style than
other kinds of communication. Awesome e-mail requires a bit of care,
the right words, and a willingness to type until the message is clear. If
you’re new to e-mail, don’t panic — I was new once, too (and look what
happened to me!).
 Make your message easier on the eyes by splitting it into paragraphs of
two or three sentences each. For the sake of your poor recipient, don’t
compress an entire message into a single huge paragraph. (That makes
the message really hard to read.) Press Enter (or Return) a couple of times
every now and then to break the behemoth into smaller, more digestible
chunks.
151
Chapter 11: E-Mailing the World, One Mailbox at a Time
 Save (button): When a message is too
important to risk losing, store a copy away
in one of the America Online software’s two
mail storage areas: on your PC or on AOL
itself. Saved messages effectively live for-
ever in there (at least until the drive fails or
AOL’s main computers die, neither of which
should be any time soon). This trick works
for New Mail, Old Mail, Sent Mail, and Mail
You Wish You Had Read Before Sending.
(Sorry about that — I got carried away.) To
save a message on your computer, click the
message’s entry in your mailbox, click the
Save button, and then click the On My PC
option. A menu pops up, listing all the fold-
ers in your Filing Cabinet. Finish the job by
clicking the folder where you want to store
this message, or click the Create Folder
option to tuck the message away into its
own special place. America Online responds
with a notice that it squirreled the message
away as requested. To save a message on
AOL, click the message’s entry in your mail-
box, click the Save button, and then click
the On AOL option. You don’t get any folder
options when saving things to AOL, so the
software simply replies that the message
was successfully saved. To find your saved
mail, open your mailbox and click the
Manage Mail tab; then look in the Saved on
AOL folder or the Saved on My PC folder,
depending on where you tucked away the
messages.
 Ignore (pop-up menu): When junk mail (or
any other mail you don’t want to see) fills up
your box, this option makes a great antidote.
As its name implies, the Ignore option disre-
gards the current message, automatically
consigning it to the Old Mail page of the
online mailbox without actually opening it. If
you get a great deal of junk e-mail, the Ignore
option promises to warm your heart. To
ignore a message, right-click the message’s
entry in the online mailbox and choose Ignore
from the pop-up menu.
 Delete (button): Then again, why simply
ignore an annoying message when you can
delete it from your world completely? Trash
those trying messages by clicking once on
the message title (to highlight the message)
and then click Delete. Good-bye message,
hello online trashcan!

 According to the America Online official Terms of Service agreement (so-
called by lawyers and other people who create official-sounding language
because they enjoy it; keyword TOS), you can’t send unsolicited adver-
tisements through the e-mail system. If someone specifically asks to
receive information from you, that’s perfectly okay, but blanketing every-
one in a chat room with e-mail about your company’s new Web site 
falls on the Not Okay side of the chart.
Enough of this talk — time to hit the keyboard and start e-mailing! To send an
e-mail message, follow these steps:
1. If you use either the Light Usage or Limited pricing plans and you
signed on to America Online to compose an e-mail message, sign 
off now.
Unless you’re an excellent typist, need to send a very short message, or
just don’t care how high your America Online bill goes this month, don’t
compose messages online if you pay for access by the minute. Instead,
write your message offline (without connecting to America Online) by
continuing with Step 2. (Your credit card bill will thank me next month.)
2. Create a new mail message by clicking the Write button on the toolbar
or by pressing Ctrl+M.
A blank e-mail window mystically appears.
3. In the Send To box, type the recipient’s America Online screen name.
To send the same message to more than one screen name, keep typing
screen names in the To box, separating each name with a comma.
If the screen name is in your Address Book, click the Address Book button
and then double-click the entry for that person or group. After choosing
all your addresses, click OK to make the Address Book go away. (Flip 
farther into this chapter for more about the Address Book.)
As you begin typing your friend’s screen name in the Send To box, the
America Online software might helpfully finish filling in the name. Don’t
worry — it can’t read your mind. To do its auto-complete trick, the AOL
software just thumbs through your Address Book as you type, looking
for possible matches. When it finds one (or more), it pops up the little
Suggestions box, listing the addresses it found. To change this behavior
(and set many other fascinating things in your e-mail), go through the 
E-mail Preferences section in Chapter 5.
You can freely mix America Online screen names and Internet e-mail
addresses when sending a message. Just separate each entry with a
comma, and the America Online e-mail system makes sure that the 
message goes to the right place. When you include a group of recipients
from the Address Book window, the America Online software automati-
cally adds commas for you. Isn’t that helpful?
152
Part III: Connecting and Communicating 

4. Press the Tab key to move the blinking cursor into the Copy To box.
Enter the screen names of people who should get a copy of the message
but should not be listed as main recipients.
Odds are, you won’t ever use the Copy To feature, but I had to mention 
it anyway. It’s just the kind of guy I am.
Don’t bother putting your own screen name in the Copy To area. You
automatically get a copy of every message you send behind the Sent
Mail tab of your online mailbox. 
5. Press Tab again to put the cursor in the Subject box. Type a brief 
(50 letters or fewer) description of the message.
Write your message subject so that the other person can tell right away
what it’s about. If the message is really important, write something like
URGENT at the beginning of the subject and be sure to include some
details after that. Because your readers may have 35 other messages to
look at, making the subject descriptive helps them figure out which mes-
sage to check first.
The preceding “50 letters or fewer” note isn’t a limitation of America
Online’s software — it’s just a suggestion for making your subjects more
informative. The America Online software lets you enter up to 80 letters
in an e-mail subject, which makes a pretty sizeable subject. 
6. Press Tab once more to get to the message area at the bottom of the
screen. Type your message text there.
Enter the text as though you’re using a word processor; for example,
don’t press the Enter (or Return) key at the end of every line. But do
press Enter (or Return) a couple times every now and then to break the
message into easy-to-read paragraphs, as shown in Figure 11-1.

some gorgeous graphics, or include live links to your favorite Web sites.
For all the jazzy details, flip ahead to the “E-Mailing with Panache” section,
later in this chapter.
7. To send a file with the message, do the following:
a. Click the Attach File button. 
b. In the Attach File dialog box, find the file you want to send and
double-click it (or highlight it and click the oddly named Open
button).
After selecting the file (whichever way you do it), the Attach File
dialog box vanishes. The name of the attached file appears in the
bottom of the Write Mail window. 
To attach another file to the same message, click the Attach File button
again. In fact, you can attach just about as many files as you want, and
the America Online software automatically compresses them into a Zip
file for you. Isn’t technology wonderful (at least when it works)?
If you change your mind about attaching the file, click the Detach File
button (it’s right next to Attach File in the Write Mail window — what a
strange coincidence).
8. To mail the message:
a. If you already signed on to America Online, click Send.
b. If you aren’t signed on right now (an important difference if you
pay by the hour!), minimize the mail window and then sign on.
After you’re on, double-click the mail message window’s title 
bar (look for it in the lower-left corner of the screen) and then
click Send.
America Online automatically reassures you with a little message, Your
mail has been sent, but that reassurance gets old if you send a great
deal of mail. To stop the annoying little dialog box from popping up, turn
off the Confirm That Mail Has Been Sent option in the Mail Preferences
window. (See Chapter 5 for everything you never — er, ever — wanted to
know about preference settings.)
America Online automatically keeps copies of all your outgoing mail for about
25 to 30 days. To review these old messages, choose Mail➪Sent Mail from the
main menu. If you’re truly attached to your correspondence, tell your America
Online software to squirrel away copies of all outbound messages in your
Saved On My PC area (which we previously called the Filing Cabinet — isn’t
progress wonderful?). To find out more about this setting, along with the many
other fascinating and tweakable items that control your America Online expe-
rience, flip back to Chapter 5.

Using America Online as your e-mail link to the Internet is easy. In fact, you
can pretend that you’re just sending mail to another America Online user,
except that the person has a very weird screen name.
To send mail from your America Online account out through the Internet, you
go through exactly the same steps as you do to send e-mail to another America
Online user. The only difference with Internet e-mail is how you address the
message.
The key to sending Internet e-mail is getting the address right. Most Internet
mail addresses look a little bizarre to uninitiated eyes, but that’s no problem —
read on and enjoy your initiation.
Rather than simple, straightforward things like JKaufeld, Internet mail
addresses look like this: chiefelf@@morethangames.com. The part to the
left of the @ is the person’s ID (the general Internet term for screen name).
The other half is the name of the computer that the person uses for e-mail.
When you put the whole thing together, you get an Internet e-mail address.
These addresses get complicated sometimes (the one for a friend of mine in
France contains about 50 letters, numbers, and various punctuation symbols).
An easy way to get the address exactly right is to ask your friend to send you
a message first. When the message arrives, carefully copy the address into
your America Online Address Book with the Add Address button (on the right
side of the mail window, as you read the friend’s message). Now you don’t
have to worry about the gory, technical address stuff anymore — just select
the entry from your Address Book, and you’re finished. (Address Book, paging
the Address Book — look just a few pages ahead for more about this useful
online tool.)
Because you use America Online, you have an Internet e-mail address, too;
it’s your screen name with @aol.com glued to the end. If your screen name is
Mungojerrie, your Internet e-mail address is mungojerrie@aol.com (and
you probably like the musical Cats, too). The Internet address ignores any
spaces or capital letters in the screen name, so don’t worry about them when
giving your e-mail address to a friend.
By the way, remember to use the person’s screen name or Internet address
rather than the person’s real name when you’re sending an e-mail message.
Although both America Online and the Internet use advanced technology,
computers still don’t know people by their given names (and I, for one, hope
that they never get to that point!).

E-Mailing with Panache
In these image-conscious times, looking good is almost as important as sound-
ing good. Thanks to advances in the America Online software, e-mail messages
are more powerful and flexible than ever. The formatting buttons put you in
charge of your e-mail’s text size, style, alignment, and even color.
Most of these formatting tips work with instant messages, too. Don’t let your
e-mail have all the fun. See Chapter 13 for the lowdown on instant messages.
The buttons just above the message area control the formatting magic. They’re
grouped into sets by what they do. Here’s a quick rundown of the sets, from
left to right:
 Font and text size: Choose one of the installed TrueType fonts and the
size that meets your purpose. If the people receiving the message have
that same font installed and use the America Online 4.0 software or a
newer version, they see your message in the font you chose. If a recipient
doesn’t have the exact font you used, his or her computer valiantly looks
for a similar font and goes with the best thing it finds (which sometimes
looks mighty heinous).
 Text formatting: These are the bold, italic, and underline buttons, as
their labels demonstrate.
 Text color: Change the color of the text with the first button. Use the
second button to change the background color of the entire message
(not just a small portion of it). Remember that blue text on a blue back-
ground doesn’t show up very well!
 Text alignment: Like any good word processor, the America Online e-mail
system understands left, center, and right justification. The drop-down
menu also includes options for numbering, bullets, and increasing or
decreasing indents.
 Insert Smiley: Sometimes only a smiley face will do. Or perhaps you’re
looking for a frown. This button gives you a wide range of emotions in
graphic form. Smiles, frowns, kisses — they’re here for the using.
 Favorite Places: You loved them as a toolbar button, and now they’re
back in the e-mail window. The heart button lists your Favorite Places,
which makes clicking Favorite Places links so that they drop into your
e-mail messages easy (see the next section for more about that).
 Extras: This drop-down menu lists all your favorite mail goodies: sta-
tionery styles, mail art, and sounds. When you locate one of these e-mail
decorations that you really like, add it to your list, and it appears under
your Extras button. Slick, eh?
156
Part III: Connecting and Communicating 

 Stationery: The lined-paper button lets you select from a group of pre-
determined stationery styles, such as clouds, notebook lines, and rain-
bow. Better yet, you can add stationery styles to your Extras list by
clicking a selection and then clicking the Add to List option at the
bottom of the pop-up menu. Add some pizzazz to your next e-mail by
using a sport or floral background, or select one of the standard plain
background colors such as blue or yellow.
 Art: Mail art dresses up a message with icons of just about anything you
might want. Watch a butterfly flutter, send congratulations, or commem-
orate a favorite holiday in your e-mail messages. Use the Art button to
scroll through the options, and then click the Add to List button at the
bottom of the Art Mail pop-up menu to add a piece of art to the Extras
menu for later. If you find a piece of art too wonderful to leave for later,
the Insert button places the selected graphic into the current Write Mail
message. 
 Sounds: As if graphics and backgrounds were not enough, now you can
even enhance your e-mail messages with sound. Click the Add to List
button to add that irrepressible sound to your Extras list so it’s always
available when you need it. Now your messages can beep, buzz, and chirp.
 Insert a picture: The camera button inserts a graphic image into your
e-mail, so you can tell Aunt Sarah about the holiday party and show off
the digital pictures. You can even use the image as the background to
your message if you like. To insert a graphic, click the camera button
and then, select either the Insert a Picture or Insert Background option.
Then select an image file. Poof! The graphic appears in your message.
 Spell check: Clicking the Spell Check button at the bottom of the Write
Mail window checks your spelling (yes!) to prevent embarrassing speeling
misteaks.
 Signatures: Look for this button along the bottom of the Write Mail
window as well. In e-mail terms, a signature is a little bit of text, usually
no more than four lines, that your e-mail software adds to the end of all
your e-mail messages. It usually includes your name, e-mail address, and
some pithy quote or brief advertising message. Click the Signatures
button to build a new signature, set your default signature, or use an
existing signature in your current message.
The new 9.0 software lets you include a graphic or a Favorite Place in your
signature file along with the formatted text you already know and love. In
the Create Signature window, use the camera button to drop your favorite
photo or graphic into your signature file. Use the heart button to insert a
Favorite Place. The America Online software scales it down so that it fits
under your name (or whatever you use as a signature in e-mail messages).
Very cool.
157
Chapter 11: E-Mailing the World, One Mailbox at a Time

The font, formatting, color, and alignment buttons all work the same way. To
use them with new text, click the buttons for your choices and start typing.
The software applies the fonts, formatting, and whatever else you choose to
the text as you type. To format text that’s already in the message, click and
drag across the text you want to change and then click the various formatting
buttons. Presto — the old text looks new! To remove some formatting, high-
light the text in question and click off the format options you don’t want.
Linking with Ease
Almost every time I wander America Online or surf the Web for a while, I run
across something that’s really neat and worth sharing with my friends. In the
past, I laboriously copied the Internet address or America Online keyword
into a mail message — and sometimes messed it up in the process. Today,
though, I never miss an address because I let the America Online software
insert the link for me.
Before trying this trick, you need to understand how the Favorite Places area
works and what it does for you. If you’re not familiar with Favorite Places, flip
back to Chapter 8 and find out more about them before attempting this link
thing.
When you want to include a link to an America Online keyword or an Internet
site in an e-mail message, follow these steps:
1. Go to the keyword area or Internet site so that it’s in a window on
your screen.
If the keyword area doesn’t have a Favorite Places icon in its window,
you can’t send a link to it. Sorry — it’s just how life goes sometimes.
2. Click the Favorite Places paper-and-pen button in the upper-right
corner of the window.
A fresh e-mail window appears with your link ready and waiting in the
message body.
3. Address the message, type a subject and body, and then send the 
message just as you normally would.
The America Online software makes this mail-the-link thing easy, 
doesn’t it?
158
Part III: Connecting and Communicating 

Flash! America Online 9.0 now recognizes Web site addresses when you type
them in an e-mail message! It’s true — and you heard it here first. Forget the
painful click-drag-drop routine of days gone by; the 9.0 software handles
everything for you. Just type the Web address into your mail message like
normal text. America Online notices the address (provided it starts with the
standard www) and converts it to a clickable link automatically. If the address
looks a little different (such as games.yahoo.com), type http:// in front of
the address so that the software can recognize it. 
Incoming Missive, Sir!
Sending mail is only half the fun. After you send something, you get a reply
(at least sometimes)! If you think that a mailbox full of junk mail is a lift, just
wait until you sign on to America Online and find a message or two in your
e-mail box. Someone out there cares!
To check your online mailbox, click the mailbox button on the toolbar or the
You’ve Got Mail button on the Welcome Screen. Either way, America Online
whisks you away to the Online Mailbox window’s New Mail area.
America Online 9.0 adds a fast and clever way to see what’s in your mailbox:
the Mail QuickView window. To bring up the Mail QuickView window, move
your mouse pointer over the Read button on the toolbar. After just a moment,
the Mail QuickView window unrolls, giving you a brief introduction to the
first ten messages in your e-mail box. The window shows the sender’s e-mail
address and the first 15 or so letters in the message’s subject. When you move
the mouse across a message’s entry in the list, the entry expands a bit, adding
the date you received the message and the next few words in the subject. To
read any of the messages, just click on its entry in the list. The window also
offers an Open Mailbox button at the bottom that works just like the Read
button on the toolbar.
The first few times you look at the new Online Mailbox window, you might feel
slightly off balance (goodness knows I did). The listing shows some messages
in bold print, others in regular type, a few with an envelope and a magnifying
glass, and still others with a spiffy blue envelope icon. Although it may not look
this way right now, the America Online programmers created this scheme to
159
Chapter 11: E-Mailing the World, One Mailbox at a Time

help you — really. Here’s a brief explanation of all the strange colors and text,
as well as a tip or two for managing the chaos . . . er, comprehending the new
organization system: 
 Messages with a vanilla-colored envelope come from known senders. If
the sender’s screen name or e-mail address appears in your Address Book
or Buddy List, America Online assumes that you know the person well
enough to want mail from him or her. The software also sorts these mes-
sages to the top of the mailbox, leaving a slushy pile of orange envelopes
at the bottom. (More about those next.)
 Orange envelopes with a magnifying glass over them represent mail from
unknown senders. They might be bulk e-mailers who helpfully sent you a
mailbox full of spam today, messages from new business associates who
haven’t found their way into your Address Book entries yet, or friendly
notes from other America Online members wanting to establish a pen-
palship. Whatever the source, America Online determines that you don’t
know these people and cautions you to be careful with the magnifying
glass and brightly colored envelope. 
 Orange tied packages with stamps indicate that this message comes
from a Bulk Sender, someone who sends bulk e-mail to many different
addresses. The package icon doesn’t necessarily mean that the message
is junk mail to you; if you receive e-mail newsletters or press releases,
those messages may very well carry the bulk e-mail icon.
 Blue envelopes with the AOL icon designate an Official AOL e-mail mes-
sage. These messages come to you from America Online’s Official Office
of Corporate Messages and Stuff. They announce new screen names in
your account, tell you of interesting new services, or provide some other
vital — and official — communication from AOL. 
 When the message sender and subject appear in bold type, you haven’t
read that message yet. 
 If you read a message and then click the Keep As New button, the mes-
sage stays in the New Mail window, but the sender and subject appear in
normal type. The message automatically keeps its icon (a vanilla envelope
for a known sender or an orange envelope for an unknown sender) for
sorting. 
Now that you have the lowdown on why everything looks the way it does,
what can you do about it? Well, several things, actually. If the varying colored
envelopes annoy you, click the Type button to group the envelopes by color
so that your buddies who send you cream-colored envelopes appear at either
the top or bottom of the list. (Your choice; click the button a few times until
you like the look.) 
160
Part III: Connecting and Communicating 

If you prefer to see all e-mail messages by date or by sender, no matter when
they arrived, use the Date button. In much the same way, E-Mail Address sorts
by sender above all other criteria, and Subject sorts by the message’s subject
line — a handy little feature if you follow a group of messages about one par-
ticular topic or you attempt to keep your business correspondence sorted by
subject. 
For more drastic sorting solutions, take a look at the Show Me Mail From drop-
down menu. By default, the window is set to Everyone. If you’re feeling less
than social today, a click of the drop-down list changes the option to People I
Know, Unknown Senders, or even Bulk Senders — those people who send the
junk mail that fills up your mailbox. (Setting the option to Bulk Senders makes
deleting all those unwanted e-mail messages easier.)
Delving Into Your Mailbox
After you get beyond the haphazard look of the New Mail window and finish
organizing it to look more like home, it’s time to get down to the nitty-gritty,
who-sent-me-what-today stuff. To read a message, double-click the message
in the New Mail window or click it once and then click the Read button. Your
message hops up into its own window. After reading the message, America
Online gives you a lot of options for what to do next:
 If the sender uses America Online, the software gives you a host of cool
options for working with the sender’s e-mail address. Click the sender’s
e-mail address in the message (the America Online software treats the
address as a clickable link). An Info dialog box appears, offering to send
this person a mail message or an instant message or to add the person
to your Address Book or Buddy List. You can also block all mail from
this person. 
 To reply only to the person who sent the message, click the Reply button.
Clicking this button displays a new message window, already addressed
and ready to go. If you highlight some of the sender’s message before
clicking the Reply button, the America Online software automatically
copies whatever you selected into the new message. 
 To share your comments with the sender and everyone else who received
the message, click the Reply All button. A freshly addressed message
window hops onto the screen. To automatically include some of the orig-
inal message in your reply, highlight the text before clicking the Reply All
button.
 To send a copy of the message to someone else, click the Forward button.
161
Chapter 11: E-Mailing the World, One Mailbox at a Time

After finishing your enjoyable time with the message, close the message
window by clicking the X button in the upper-left corner of the window.
As part of the never-ending fight against people who send junk e-mail, America
Online added a feature to its e-mail system software that identifies e-mail
coming from outside the service. When you open a message sent from some-
one outside America Online, the line right above the message body contains
a clickable Sent from the Internet link that says (Details). If you see that link
on the message, the message didn’t come from an America Online member or
from America Online itself. No matter what the sender address says (especially
if it’s something like the one in Figure 11-2), the message came from someone
out on the Internet.
So what does the link do? If you click the Details link, a little dialog box hops
onto the screen, displaying the e-mail header information. This technical stuff
describes where the message went on its way to your mailbox. Most of the
time, you don’t care about this stuff, but at certain moments (when trouble-
shooting e-mail problems with the Technical Support folks, for instance) you
need to dig through the headers. 
Figure 11-2:
Despite its
@aol.com

address, the

link tells you
that this

It’s a scam!

Part III: Connecting and Communicating 

Here are few more tips for handling your online mailbox:
 To keep a message in your inbox after you read it: Click the message
once in the New Mail window and then click the Keep As New button. 
Unread messages live in your America Online inbox for about 30 days
after arriving. After that, they turn into very small pumpkins and are
shipped to your local grocery store, never to be seen or heard from
again.
 To save an important message: Either print it or save it in the America
Online software’s built-in storage spot.
To print a message, press Ctrl+P or select File➪Print. To store the mes-
sage, open the e-mail message (as if you’re reading it) and then click the
Save button. In the pop-up menu, decide whether you want to save the
message to AOL or to your local PC. If you save it to AOL, then you’re
done — end of process. If you save it to the local PC, a new menu pops
up, listing your storage folders. Select the folder where you want the
message stored. The America Online software copies the message with-
out delay. For more about saving your messages, see the “Organizing
Your E-Mail Mess(ages)” section in this chapter.
 To read a message in the Old Mail folder: After reading a message, it
hangs out in the Old Mail area for anywhere from a few days to a couple
of weeks after you first look at it. (In the Mail Preferences setting, you
can tell the America Online computers to store incoming e-mail for at
least seven days — see Chapter 5 for more about that.) To reread an old
message, choose Mail➪Old Mail from the menu. Doing so displays the
Old Mail window. Double-click the message you want to read.
 To read a deleted message: In these days of rampant unsolicited e-mail
(commonly known by its greasy nickname spam), the Delete key often gets
quite a workout as you browse through your incoming mail. Sometimes
the key gets a little carried away, and you accidentally delete an e-mail
that you actually wanted to read. America Online, hearing the plaintive
howls of its membership, finally developed a solution: the Recently
Deleted Mail area.
To read (and even retrieve) a message you accidentally deleted, choose
Mail➪Recently Deleted Mail from the menu. This action displays a dialog
box containing mail that you deleted within the last 24 hours. Double-
click a message to read it, click the Keep As New button to put the mes-
sage back into your mailbox, or click the Permanently Delete button to
truly consign the little sucker to oblivion.

Chapter 11: E-Mailing the World, One Mailbox at a Time

Organizing Your E-Mail Mess(ages)
I absolutely live on e-mail. Maybe it’s my job or the peculiar people I work with
(or perhaps it’s my nerdy side showing again — I hate it when that happens),
but I spend a great deal of time each day fielding incoming messages and
unleashing my own outbound correspondence flood. Thankfully, my faithful
digital assistant, the Manage Mail window, keeps all my e-stuff organized.
The Manage Mail window tracks incoming and outgoing e-mail, spam messages
that were automatically distilled from your account, and e-mail messages you
recently deleted. You can even save e-mail messages on the America Online
servers so that you can access them from anywhere. Best of all, it’s built right
into the America Online software, so you have nothing to download and noth-
ing to buy.
To open the Manage Mail window, choose File➪Mail Saved on My PC (Filing
Cabinet) from the menu bar. The window hops on the screen, looking much
like Figure 11-3. The file folders along the left side of the window represent
different storage areas. The buttons along the bottom help you organize the
stuff in your Manage Mail folders.
Doing the basic mail-management tasks
You have much to work with here, and this area is easiest to understand
when you play with it. Before turning you loose, here are some basic ideas
about how the Manage Mail window works:
Figure 11-3:

Mail window

mation in

folders.
164
Part III: Connecting and Communicating 

 To view a folder’s contents, double-click it. The messages inside appear
in the large window to the right. When you open a folder, the software
displays all the items the folder contains (which can be a lengthy list).
Don’t be surprised if you have to scroll up and down to see everything in
a folder.
 To view an e-mail inside a folder, double-click the item in the large list
window. The list window also offers the same organizational buttons as
the Read and Sent Mail windows, so you can organize any folder’s mes-
sages by type, date, e-mail address, or subject.
 To create a new folder, click the Setup Folders drop-down menu at the
bottom of the My Mail Folders window and then select Create Folder. Type
a name for the new folder and then click OK. The new folder appears at
the bottom of the Saved on My PC folders. Isn’t automated organization
amazing?
Note: Folders can be inside other folders, just like in the real world. For
example, you can create additional folders to nest inside the Mail You’ve
Sent folder to further organize your mail stack.
 To move items from one folder to another (which is easy), move your
cursor over the item you want to move, click and hold down the mouse
button, and drag the item to its new home. When the mouse highlights
the destination folder, release the mouse button. Manage Mail gently
puts the item in place and then notifies you that it moved the message.
 To find a misplaced e-mail message, type words from the subject or
sender’s e-mail address into the Quick Find text box to have the Manage
Mail search engine ferret it out. To search the full text of messages, click
the Search Mail tab and do your search there. Make sure that the Search
Content setting behind the Search Options link is turned on; otherwise,
this tool searches only the e-mail address and subject, too.
Backing up and cleaning out
Few things hurt more than losing all your important files and such when your
hard drive crashes. Protect the things you love by occasionally copying your
Manage Mail items to a floppy disk, Zip disk, or whatever other kind of remov-
able computer disk is lying around nearby. America Online automatically backs
up your now-organized Manage Mail contents once every four weeks or so, if
you tell it to as follows:
1. Click the Settings icon on the toolbar.
The AOL Settings window appears, with the Essentials tab showing.
2. Click the By Category tab and scroll through the list until you see the
Organization link. Click it.
A new set of links appear, ready for your attention.
165
Chapter 11: E-Mailing the World, One Mailbox at a Time

3. Click the Personal Storage Settings link.
4. Make sure a check mark appears in the Automatically Backup My
Personal Storage Every X Weeks check box. (If it doesn’t, click in the
check box.)
Your choices range from once a week to once a month.
Now you can copy them to a floppy disk to keep them safer than a hard
drive backup (you find the backup in the Backup folder of the America
Online software on your hard drive). 
5. Click the Save button to make your changes permanent, and then
close the Settings window.
If you store business e-mail or other important messages in your Manage Mail
folders, change the Personal Storage preference from 4 weeks to 1 week, and
make backup copies of the Manage Mail information at least once per week.
(Yes, it’s really that important.)
America Online automatically stores copies of all your mail (both sent and
received) in the Saved on My PC folder of the Manage Mail window. The idea
is cool, but it eats up disk space pretty quickly. Leave this feature on to see
whether you like it (but regularly delete the old messages that you really
don’t need to keep).
If you decide that you don’t want America Online saving all your e-mail for you,
click the Settings icon on the toolbar and then click the Mail Settings link in
the Settings window that appears. The Mail Settings dialog box jumps to the
screen, listing all sorts of useful and arcane mail settings. To turn off America
Online’s automatic organizational help, uncheck the Retain All Mail I Read in
My Saved Mail Folder and Retain All Mail I Send in My Mail I’ve Sent Folder
options.
Catching People with Your Address Book
You start meeting people right away in America Online. Join a discussion, drop
in for a chat, or attend a live presentation, and suddenly you have online
friends. You also have a problem: How do you keep track of the members of
your newfound social club?
It’s time to invoke the familiar refrain, “Luckily, the America Online program-
mers thought of that.” Yup, those clever folks from Virginia did it again. Step
right this way, and meet the America Online Address Book.
166
Part III: Connecting and Communicating 

As address books go, this one’s simple. It handles entries for single screen
names or big, honking mailing lists (assuming that you’re into large, noisy
name collections).
 For an individual, the Address Book holds the person’s real name, screen
name, or Internet e-mail address, Web site address, phone numbers,
postal mailing address, and various notes describing the entry. 
 For a mailing group, the entry consists of a descriptive title and a list 
of the assembled crowd’s e-mail addresses.
The Address Book lists both individual entries and groups in one master alpha-
betized list. Better still, America Online now stores a copy of your Address
Book in a safe, secure corner of its big computers out in Virginia. Now your
Address Book is available every time you sign on to America Online — even
when you use someone else’s computer to sign on with the Guest option! 
(I probably shouldn’t be this excited about the Address Book, but it’s the
nerdy side of me showing through — down, nerd, down!)
Adding Address Book entries
Before you can use the Address Book to send messages, you have to put some
addresses in it. With that marginally deep thought in mind, here’s how to add
new items to your Address Book:
1. Open the Address Book by choosing Mail➪Address Book on the main
menu or by clicking the Address Book button in a New Mail message
window.
The Address Book window pops up, all bright and cheery.
2. To add an entry for a person, click the Add button. To build a group
entry, click the Add Group button.
A blank Contact Details or Manage Group dialog box appears.
3. Fill in the appropriate spaces in the dialog box and then check your
work carefully, especially the e-mail address entry (or entries, as the
case may be).
When making a Group entry, choose e-mail addresses that you have
already included in your Address Book or carefully type any other
America Online screen names and Internet e-mail addresses that you
want. Type the new addresses one after another, with commas separat-
ing them, as shown in Figure 11-4.
167
Chapter 11: E-Mailing the World, One Mailbox at a Time

Although capitalization doesn’t count here, spelling definitely does! For
example, you can enter my screen name any way you want (JKaufeld,
Jkaufeld, jkaufeld, or jKaUfElD all count), and America Online figures out
that you mean me. If you put in jkaufield (with an i), however, the system
gets all confused and doesn’t send the mail to me.
To turn your about-to-be-created Address Book group into a full-blown
online clubhouse through America Online’s new Groups@AOL system,
click the Yes option next to the fateful question “Do you want to share
this group” and then follow the other instructions that appear. For more
about Groups@AOL, flip ahead to Chapter 14.
4. After you finish, click OK.
The new entry pops into the Address Book window, in alphabetical order.
If you made a new shared group item, America Online automatically
whisks you away to the Make a Group window inside Groups@AOL. Just
follow the instructions, make no sudden moves, and hope that no tele-
marketers call right then.
Repeat the process until your Address Book overflows with friends, acquain-
tances, business associates, and other online contacts.
If you want to make an Address Book entry for someone who just sent you an
e-mail message, just click his or her e-mail address in the message the person
sent. That displays a special Info dialog box with a simple button for adding
the person to your Address Book. If the person uses AOL, you also get buttons
to put him or her on your Buddy List and to see the person’s online profile.

Deleting Address Book entries
So now you may have an Address Book full of stuff, and it’s getting unwieldy —
plus you can’t remember who half these people are. No problem — that’s what
the Delete button is for. Deleting is a quick and painless process. Here’s how
to do it:
1. Open the Address Book (if you haven’t already) by choosing Mail➪
Address Book on the main menu.
Of course, you can also click the Address Book button in the e-mail mes-
sage window if that’s where you happen to be when the inspiration hits.
2. Scroll through the Address Book list until you find the entry you want
to dispose of.
3. Click the description once to highlight it, and then click the Delete
button.

Changing Address Book entries
Because things change at a ridiculous pace, particularly in the online world,
keeping your Address Book up-to-date is a never-ending task. That’s why your
Address Book has an Edit button.
Here’s the scoop on changing an existing Address Book entry:
1. Open the Address Book (if it’s closed) by choosing Mail➪Address Book
on the main menu or by clicking the Address Book button in a brand-
new mail message.
2. Click once on the entry you need to change.
This step highlights the entry.
3. Click the Edit button.
The Contact Details or Manage Group window comes back. It’s the same
window you used to create the entry.

Chapter 11: E-Mailing the World, One Mailbox at a Time

4. Make your changes as necessary.
Everything is open for change, so make whatever modifications you must.
If you’re working with a list, you can freely add and delete screen names.
All standard Windows text-editing tricks work here: highlight, delete,
insert, and the rest. Edit (and play) as much as you want.
5. After you finish with the changes and are pleased as punch with them,
click Save to save your work.
Click Cancel if you want to abandon your carefully wrought editing and
keep the record the way it was. Whichever button you click, the Address
Details or Manage Group dialog box vanishes, and you’re back to the
Address Book window.
Emergency! Saving and replacing 
your Address Book
The Address Book makes your e-mail life so much easier that many people
rely heavily on it as part of their everyday online existence. After using com-
puters for a while, though, you quickly find out that even the best technology
(yes, even the America Online software) occasionally fails. With the Address
Book, the little word fails translates to toasts your painstakingly assembled and
utterly irreplaceable list of e-mail addresses. In other words, in case of failure,
kiss the Address Book goodbye.
America Online 6.0 through 9.0 take Address Book protection to a new level
by storing your Address Book online, in the vast digital vaults of America
Online’s main computers. Every time you sign on, America Online automati-
cally checks the Address Book stored on your computer. If the system detects
an empty Address Book (which is what your Address Book looks like after a
computer crash), America Online automatically copies its saved version down
to your computer. Voila — your Address Book is safe and sound again!
If you feel safer with paper copies in your home filing cabinet, you can always
print your Address Book contents. Although it might generate a lot of printed
paper, you’ll rest at night knowing that your Address Book entries sit securely
in your safe deposit box at the bank (okay, that might be going a little far). To
print your Address Book entries:
1. Choose Mail➪Address Book on the main menu or click the Address
Book button in a New Mail message window.
The Address Book window quickly responds to your summons.

2. In the Address Book window, click the Print button. 
A helpful Print dialog box appears, asking whether you want to print one
of the following:
• All the contacts in your Address Book. To narrow or define the con-
tacts so you don’t print 235 people each time you need the informa-
tion for 15, assign each entry to a category. Look on the Category
tab in the Contact Details window. 
• Selected contacts (this prints any entry you clicked to bring its
contents into view in the lower text box).
• Complete contents, including the dog’s birth date if you remem-
bered to put it in someone’s Address Book entry.
• Summary contents, which includes only key information, such as
name and Internet address or screen name.
• Mailing labels.
3. Make your selections and click the OK button to start the parade . . . er,
output.
Your printer begins churning out Address Book information.

nteracting with your fellow members sits at the very heart of America
Online. I never saw an online service that’s as into the idea of community
as America Online — and darn it, people in a community should talk to each
other. The People Connection exists so that you can chat informally with
others, make friends from all over the world, connect with people who share
your interests, and generally redeem yourself in the eyes of your mother, who
still thinks that you shouldn’t spend so much time alone with your computer.
This chapter introduces the People Connection communities and chat rooms
and goes into detail about how the whole place works. It also explores the AOL
Live theaters and the Computing Center’s Online Classrooms, home to some
of the finest online presentations ever shown, um, online. Turn off the TV, let
the newspapers stack up by the door, and get ready to boldly go where a whole
lot of people eagerly await your arrival.

They Don’t Call It Community 
for Nothing
After looking far and wide for the perfect metaphor to describe the social
wonders of the People Connection, the answer hit me the other night at a
party. Duh — it’s a big, fun, wild online party! Like all good parties, the People
Connection (keyword People Connection) gives you several different ways to
socially link with people in the online world.
At most every party, some people come to just hang out, flit from group to
group, and talk until they’re out of words. For that group, there’s the realm of
online chatting that made the People Connection famous. With hundreds (and
usually thousands) of live chat rooms running 24 hours a day, 7 days a week,
the People Connection certainly earned its legendary reputation as the premier
home of social exchange, general conversation, and the occasional pointless
argument.
Ready to take a dip into the warm chat-room waters? Flip ahead a few pages
for most everything you ever want or need to know about chatting.
A good party also gives folks with similar interests some space to really con-
nect for in-depth discussions. (Parties held in most homes call this space the
“kitchen.”) When you want to join a discussion on a particular interest that you
hold dear, use the America Online Match Chat feature (keyword Match Chat.)
Match Chat takes the interests from your profile — or enter some new ones
into the search field if you like — and it ferrets out a whole list of active chat
rooms that match your stated interest. Take a peek at the selection that Match
Chat offers you and then pop into a chat room or two to see how they fit.
Ambling into a Chat Room
Getting into a People Connection chat room is easy. In fact, you probably fell
into one more than once by just wandering around the system and clicking a
few random links.
To formally set sail for the Wonderful World of Chatting, use keyword People
Connection or click the People button on the toolbar. Either method drops
you into the People Connection main window. To find a particular chat room
of interest, click the Chat Room Listings button in the upper-left side of the
window, and then click your way through the chat category and room listings.
When you find an interesting room, click its name and click the Go Chat button!

Part III: Connecting and Communicating 

Feel like trying your luck a bit? Let your America Online software throw you
into a random chat room. You never know who (and sometimes what) awaits!
For a taste of on-the-edge living, select Community➪Chat Now on the main
menu. After a moment of intense thought, the America Online software spins
some big digital wheel, chooses a room name, and sends you there. It’s truly
an online wheeeee experience if ever there is one.
Regardless of how you arrived in the chat room, your screen resembles
Figure 12-1. Because the People Connection rooms are, after all, for chatting,
the chat text area fills most of the window. Opposite the chat text is the people
list, a roster of the members sharing the chat room with you. Along the bottom
of the window is the message box, where you compose your witty comments
before pressing Enter (Return) or clicking Send to share them with the room.
At the top of the window sits an innocuous-looking Chat Options button. Its
drop-down list works like a transporter beam to various chats:
 People Connection Main: Sends you back to the main People
Connection window.
 Chat Room Listings: Takes you to the window that lists most of the
available chat rooms online. 
 Private Chat: Leads you to the quiet world of invitation-only chat rooms.
 Match Chat: Opens the Match Chat window so that you can request chat
rooms that equate to your own interests.

Chapter 12: Chatting the Day (And Night) Away
Why you simply must fill out your profile
Before getting too far into the fun and frolic of
the People Connection, you need to know about
member profiles. Your member profile is a little
online dossier you write. It contains whatever
you want other America Online subscribers to
know about you, such as your real name, your
birthday, and the computer you use. You don’t
have to fill out every line — leaving some parts
blank is perfectly okay.
Why fill out your profile? Well, if someone meets
you in a chat room or reads a message you
posted and wants to find out more about you, he
or she checks your member profile. People
often search the member profiles looking for
other America Online members with the same
interests. My wife scored an interview in a
national magazine because the writer read her
profile and liked what she found there.
Making a profile isn’t hard. Flip to Chapter 6 for
all the details. To make a truly amazing profile,
check out Chapter 20 for tricks of the profile
masters.

 Chat Search: Opens a nifty little search window that lets you search for
a specific chat room.
 Member Directory: Sends you straight to the Member Directory window,
just like choosing Community➪Member Directory from the main menu.
 Chat Preferences: Displays a dialog box containing the various chat set-
tings (just like clicking the Settings icon on the toolbar, selecting the A-Z
tab, and then clicking the Chat Preferences link from the list).
A standard chat room holds 23 people at a time. If you try to get into a chat
room that’s full, America Online either sends you to another chat room with
the same name plus a number (such as Lobby 34, New Member Lounge 15, or
Beach Party 63) or digitally shrugs you off, saying that the room is full (which
usually happens if you try to enter an overflowing member-created chat room).
If America Online shrugs, all you can do is wait a few moments and try again.
If your kids use America Online, you definitely need to know about the
Parental Controls for chat rooms. Check out Chapter 7 for the details.
Finding Conversations among 
the Keystrokes
It’s only fair, both to you and to noncomputer portions of your life, to say this
right up front: Chatting in the People Connection is almost too much fun for
words. If you like people, thrive on conversation, and enjoy typing, you may
as well put a pillow and blanket next to the computer because you found a
new home.
Figure 12-1:
Welcome 
to the chat
room —
dive in and
enjoy!
176
Part III: Connecting and Communicating 

The People Connection chat rooms are America Online’s answer to club-
houses, meeting halls, corner pubs, and your living room (except that chat
rooms are a little tidier). Put simply, chat rooms are digital gathering spots
where you and up to 22 other folks type about life, the universe, and what’s
for dinner.
When you first arrive in a room, the chat text area is blank except for a brief
note from a computer named OnlineHost announcing which room you’re in.
After a few moments, the chat text area comes alive with messages. (Don’t
try to talk with the OnlineHost — it never listens.)
What’s the key to a successful chat room conversation? Knowing how to read
your screen. Flip back to Figure 12-1. The chat text area is a mess, isn’t it?
That’s because whenever anyone types a message in a chat room, everyone
can read it. It’s like a conference call where everyone talks at the same time
all the time.
To follow the flow of a chat room, you have to skip around. The chat text in
Figure 12-1 shows at least three different conversations. Here’s a breakdown
of the action.
At the top of the window, Im The Family Dog compliments another room
member, Homeschooler, on his Web site. Homeschooler is deep in conversa-
tion with someone else at the moment, but he replies to Im The Family Dog

Stop chat room junk mail in its tracks
Although chatting makes the online world come
alive with friends (both old and new), it also
makes your mailbox strain at the sides with junk
mail. Unfortunately, junk e-mailers scan the
screen name lists in chat rooms and send out
hundreds, if not thousands, of useless, and
often downright lurid advertising messages. Left
undefended, your mailbox may get 30 to 100 junk
e-mails or more during a single chatting session!
So what can a dedicated chatter do to stem the
tide? Create a dedicated chatting screen name,
that’s what! It’s your simplest, yet most power-
ful, weapon against junk e-mail.
The idea is straightforward and — thanks to the
fact that all America Online accounts get up to
seven screen names — easy to use. Create a
new screen name for your chatting experience
and then use the Mail Controls (keyword Mail
Controls) to block all e-mail to the account. In the
member profile for your chatting name, include
a note directing people to your e-mailable screen
name. That way, the chat room bulk e-mailers
won’t bother you, but your friends can still drop
you a line.
For more about screen names and member pro-
files, see Chapter 6. To find out more about junk
e-mail (and how to fight it), flip back to Chapter 4.

near the bottom of the window. Meanwhile, I wandered into the room, and
Mungojerrie welcomed me. Near the middle of the window, Im The Family
Dog and Mungojerrie carry on a little conversation about food. Around the
same spot, Homeschooler and JSKaufeld chat about typing. At the bottom
of the window, Mungojerrie tosses out a half-hearted joke (at least it came
out that way) based on Homeschooler’s last comment.
Tossing your own thoughts into the chat room maelstrom is easy. Basically,
start typing. Whatever you type appears in that long, thin box along the
bottom of the chat room window. When you finish typing, press Enter (or
Return) or click Send. In a moment or two, your words of wisdom appear in
the chat text area for all to see. A single chat room comment holds only so
much text, so choose your letters, numbers, and punctuation marks carefully
(or split your thought into two lines).
If you type a comment but your text doesn’t appear in the box at the bottom
of the chat room window, click the mouse anywhere in the text box along the
bottom of the chat room window. When you see the blinking toothpick cursor
way over on the left side of the box, go ahead and start typing again.
There’s much to tell about chat rooms, but little of it follows any kind of orga-
nization. With that bit of rationalizing out of the way, here are some randomly
assembled thoughts and tips about the wild world of chatting:
 To get someone’s attention in a chat room, start your comment with the
person’s screen name. If the person doesn’t respond in a minute or two,
try it again. If all else fails, send the person an instant message asking
whether he or she saw what you typed. Check out Chapter 13 for the
details about instant messages.
 To quickly read a fellow chatter’s member profile or send the person an
instant message, scroll through the People Here list until you find the
person’s screen name and double-click it. A dialog box fills the left-hand
side of your screen. At the top of the box are several buttons destined to
make your life easier: 
• The Send IM button sends an instant message to the selected
person. 
• The Send Mail button opens the Write Mail window with the name
filled in, ready to go.
• If you find the person’s overtures annoying, the Block IM and
Block E-mail buttons await your attention.
On the other hand, when you meet a new friend you can use the
Add to Buddy List or Add to Address Book buttons so you don’t
lose track of your new buddy once the chat room window closes. 
178
Part III: Connecting and Communicating 

The dialog box automatically displays the person’s member profile if
one exists. To get back to the chat room after playing in the window,
close the little dialog box. Before making another comment in the chat
room, click the mouse anywhere in the long box at the bottom of the
window and then start typing. (Otherwise, what you type doesn’t appear
on the screen.)
 If a person is getting out of hand or you just don’t like listening to him or
her, find the person’s screen name in the People Here list, click it, and
click the Ignore button. Look for it directly under the People Here list.
From then on, nothing the person types appears on your screen. (Isn’t
technology wonderful?)
 If you wander into a game chat, someone may ask you to “roll dice” in
the room. For wonderful yet mysterious reasons, all America Online chat
rooms understand the special command //roll. This command tells
the America Online computer to pretend to roll some dice and print the
results in the chat room. By default, it “rolls” two six-sided dice (just like
you do in Monopoly and other board games). You can also specify the
number of sides and number of rolls by typing //roll-dice xx-sides
yy (replace xx with the number of dice and yy with the number of sides
on each die). So, to roll four eight-sided dice, type //roll-dice 
4-sides 8.
 If you see people writing comments like afk, bak, LOL, and ROFL!, don’t
worry — they’re not making fun of you. That’s standard chat room short-
hand for things like “away from the keyboard,” “laughing out loud,” and
other ever-necessary observations. For more about these, use keyword
LOL Online. The LOL Online window offers definitions, online shorthand
notation, and lots of useful tips for communicating with shorter “words.”
Chat rooms get noisier than usual in the AOL 9.0 software, thanks to the addi-
tion of the Buddy Sounds (keyword Expressions, and then click Buddy Sound).
If you set a Buddy Sound, then everybody in the chat room hears that sound
when you enter the room and when they double-click your screen name in the
chat room member list to see your profile. For more about all of the expres-
sions available in the 9.0 software, check out Chapter 20.
Seeking Out a Chat Room
The People Connection ranks as one of the top America Online destinations.
Finding the room that’s right for you may take some time, particularly because
the area contains hundreds, if not thousands, of active chats all the time.
179
Chapter 12: Chatting the Day (And Night) Away

To simplify your chatting life (and find interesting chats quickly), use Search
All AOL Chats, the People Connection search feature:
1. Use keyword Chat Search to display the Search All AOL Chats window.
(If that doesn’t work, click the People toolbar button and then use the
Search By Topic text window at the top of the People Connection
window.)
2. Type a few words to describe the room you’re looking for and then
click Search.
America Online lists both People Connection–sponsored rooms and
member-created chats matching your description. If a member created
the chat, the system lets you know and warns you that the chat room
might contain conversation not meant for young ears — er, eyes.
3. Scroll through the list until you find a likely candidate, and then 
click the chat room’s name.
America Online displays a brief description of the chat.
4. To hop into the chat room, click the big Go Chat button in the descrip-
tion window (or save a step and use the Go Chat button next to each
individual entry).
If a chat room has space for you (remember that each chat room holds
23 people), you immediately pop into the room. If the room is full, the
software lets you know.
This set of steps searches all of America Online, looking for interesting chats
sponsored by various online areas. It doesn’t search the general People
Connection chats, though. The only way to find a chat in the People Connec-
tion is by old-fashioned browsing in the Find a Chat window (click the People
toolbar button and then choose Find a Chat from the drop-down menu).
After getting into the room, add it to your Favorite Places list by clicking the
little heart icon in the chat room’s upper-right corner. For more about Favorite
Places, see Chapter 8.
Beware the Password Scammers
I wish that I didn’t have to include this section, but I must. Password scamming
is alive and well on America Online. The good news is that America Online
actively fights the jerks who do it; the bad news is that more jerks are always
available to replace the ones who get caught.
180
Part III: Connecting and Communicating 

Don’t ever give your password or credit card information to anyone —
anyone — who asks for it, whether it happens online or some other way.
Nobody from America Online will ever ask for your password. Period. Never.
It won’t happen. No matter what the person says, who the person claims to
be, or what the person threatens to do, ignore and report anyone who asks
for your password.
Figure 12-2 shows actual samples of password scammers I bumped into on
America Online. I want to emphasize that: I did not make these figures up —
they are real.
If you get an instant message that looks like the ones in Figure 12-2, don’t
bother to reply or say anything catty (leave that to people like me); just get
ready to ruin the scammer’s day. Here’s how to report a password scammer
to America Online:
1. If you’re in a chat room when a password-scamming message appears,
type a note in the room that says someone is fishing for passwords.
Be sure to give the screen name of the person who sent you the instant
message. It never hurts to remind everyone to never give out their 
passwords — think of it as your good deed for the day.
Figure 12-2:
They
promise
anything to

Chapter 12: Chatting the Day (And Night) Away

2. Click the Notify AOL button in the Instant Message window.
The Notify AOL window appears. Thanks to the wonders of modern soft-
ware, the system automatically prepares a report for the Community
Action Team (the America Online version of community police), including
the screen name of the person who sent you the message, the message
text, and several other items.
3. If you want to add any comments with your report, type them in the
text area at the bottom of the Notify AOL dialog box.
You don’t need to include any extra comments, but this dialog box offers
the opportunity anyway. If you do type some notes, they’re automatically
appended to the report.
4. After filling out the report to your satisfaction, click Send Report.
The window closes automatically. Bye-bye, scammer!
If you gave out your password before realizing that the person requesting it
was a scammer, all is not lost. Immediately (and I mean right now) go to key-
word Password and change your account password. After that, go through
the preceding steps and report the scammer.
Enjoying a Little Private (Room) Time
Whether you’re talking business or catching up with a friend, the People
Connection’s private room feature gives you all the benefits of a chat room
without the inconvenience of filling it with strange people. Private rooms are
great for reunions, parties, brainstorming sessions, and regional meetings.
Private rooms are just that — private. No one can get in without knowing the
name of the room (a name you make up, by the way). America Online doesn’t
keep a master list of active private rooms. People outside the room can’t
monitor the discussion in a private room.
Private chat rooms still have some limitations, though. For example, a private
room holds only 23 people (so you can’t have a really whopping party). And
you get unexpected guests every now and then. Someone thinks up the same
name you used and — poof! — that person appears in your private room. Don’t
worry, though — that doesn’t happen very often. Also, private chat rooms,
unlike their public counterparts, don’t include a Notify AOL button in the chat
window. To report a problem, use keyword Notify AOL.
182
Part III: Connecting and Communicating 

To create or join the discussion in a private chat room, follow these steps:
1. Click the People icon on the toolbar and then click the Create a Chat
button on the People Connection window that appears.
The Start Your Own Chat dialog box appears.
2. Click the Private Chat button.
The Enter or Start a Private Chat dialog box hops nimbly to the screen.
3. Carefully type the name of the private room you want to either join 
or create, and then click the Go Chat button.
The chat room window appears, with the name of the private room
emblazoned across the top.
If you’re creating a new private chat room, make up any name for it you
want. If you’re joining someone else’s room, type the name exactly as the
person gave it to you (assuming that the person sent you the room name
when he or she invited you in).
If you are heading into a private chat with some friends but find yourself
alone in an empty private room instead, make sure that you typed the
name right (capitalization doesn’t count, but spelling does). If you unex-
pectedly waltz into someone else’s private room, blush profusely, type a
brief apology, close the window, and start over at Step 1.
If you spend a great deal of time chatting with folks on your Buddy List, the
new Buddy Chat feature promises to make your life a little easier. Flip to
Chapter 13 for the details.
Attending Classes — and Enjoying Them
Remember when we attended classes because we wanted to? No? Oh . . . er,
that must have been someone else. If you never experienced the thrill of
learning for fun, now you can with America Online’s free online classes. Every
now and then knowing the ins and outs of a specific topic is nice, especially if
that topic happens to concern your computer. Spending an hour or so in an
online class that covers your chosen subject might not only answer the current
question at hand, but it may also arm you with a few cool tricks along the way. 
Drop into a class on online safety. Or perhaps brush up on a specific applica-
tion, such as Microsoft Word or Paint Shop Pro. If e-mail or the ins and outs 
of Favorite Places stump you, check out one of the scheduled online classes.
These classes, brought to you by the America Online Community Education
Center, feature real live instructors who teach short courses on everything
from keyboarding basics to Macromedia Flash. Each individual class takes
place in an Online Classroom. 
183
Chapter 12: Chatting the Day (And Night) Away

The Online Classrooms live at keyword Classes. These rooms look and act dif-
ferently than the ones you find elsewhere on America Online, although they
behave fundamentally like chat rooms. These classrooms contain two large
windows, a normal thin chat window along the bottom where you type your
comments, and a People Here list. Everything typed by the course presenter
appears in the text window at the top of the screen. The bottom of the screen
resembles the standard free-for-all environment of a classic chat window.
Everybody attending the class sits in the same group, and all their comments
appear in the window’s large text area. Usually, classes include a few modera-
tors (one on “stage” with the presenter and the other in the audience) who
track audience questions and generally keep the peace.
In case someone asks (I can’t imagine why anyone would, but it’s a strange
world), the developers inside America Online call the rooms in the Online
Classroom area enhanced conference rooms (or ECRs). Some other areas of
the service use ECRs for small meetings and courses.
As with chat rooms, you need to know many other things about classrooms
to make your enjoyment complete:
 Did you miss a presentation you wanted to attend? No problem — just
look for a transcript. Use keyword Classes, and then look for the tran-
script link in the window that describes each individual class. First 
click the Daily Class Schedule link in the New Member and AOL Classes
window, and then click any specific class title in the schedule. Because
all transcripts are plain-text files, you can read them with any word
processor.
 Online Classroom events put everyone in a single window, so you can’t
actually change seating rows as you can in a large theater if you find that
you’re allergic to the person next to you. That’s not a big problem, though,
because a staffer always watches over the room and keeps everyone 
in line. 
 For a list of approaching Online Classroom events, use keyword Classes.
The Daily Class Schedule link lists all current classes for the week. Events
are organized by date. Scroll through the list and double-click whatever
event looks interesting to get the details. 
Recording Your Conversations
For whatever reason (whether it’s simple paranoia or something more com-
plex), you may want a record of what went on during a chat. Perhaps you’re
attending a forum conference center presentation and need to review the
chat for ideas. Or maybe you’re just feeling a little cloak-and-dagger today
and want to spy on your chat room friends. Whatever the reason, keeping a
copy of your chats is easy.

To record the chat room you’re in, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Log Manager from the main menu.
This selection displays the Logging dialog box with the name of your
chat room in the Room box. 
2. In the Chat Log area of the Logging dialog box (near the top of the

In the Open Log dialog box, the chat room name automatically appears
as your log name. (You can change it, if you want, by typing a new name
for the file.)
3. Click Save or press Enter to open the log file.
From that point on, any new chat text appears on-screen and gets saved
on your hard drive. Text already on-screen before you started the log
isn’t in the file.
4. Close the chat window to save the log file.
When you close the chat window, the log file automatically closes and
saves with the chat room name that you gave it to begin with.

Years ago, when the world was young and we called brick-size desktop
calculators and LED watches high tech, saying “Hi” to your friends meant
calling them on the phone, yelling to them over the backyard fence, or sending
them a quick note through the (gasp!) postal mail. As time went by, immediate
gratification won over genteel manners; thus phone calls became the norm.
The online world took immediate gratification to a whole new level by deliver-
ing messages anywhere in the world within moments. It also introduced new
problems because the friends who used to live next door now live in the next
time zone (or, worse, the second continent on the left just past that ocean over
there). E-mail still flies through the wires with the greatest of speed, but it’s
not interactive — you can’t enjoy the back-and-forth exchange of ideas that a
good, old-fashioned phone call provided.
Because programmers abhor missing features, the clever developers at
America Online came up with the Instant Message system. Instant messages
blend the immediacy of e-mail with the interactivity of a phone call by letting
you type back and forth with someone else on the system. It all happens right
now — or, as the computer people say, in real time (as opposed to fake time,
I suppose) — like a private, one-on-one chat room.

This chapter explores the Instant Message system and details how to send
and receive instant messages (or IMs, for short), plus how to shut the little
buggers off when you want to concentrate for a while.
Online Telepathy with Instant Messages
Sometimes, you just want to drop a quick “Hi!” to someone you happen to
bump into online. That’s what the America Online instant message feature is
for. It’s an easy way to have a quick conversation with someone regardless of
whatever else either of you is doing at the time (see Figure 13-1). Instant mes-
sages are private, too — only you and your correspondent see what passes
between you. Because instant messages happen, well, instantly, both you and
your intended recipient need to be signed on to America Online; otherwise,
the whole thing fails miserably.

Part III: Connecting and Communicating 
Messages from an Internet user — 
the mystery of AIM
Once upon a time, only America Online members
enjoyed the wonder and merriment of instant
messages. Everyone else — specifically all those
non-AOL users wandering forlornly through the
Internet — pined away, hoping that one day
they too might send instant messages to their
friends on America Online.
Several instant-message-like programs sprouted
on the Internet, but then America Online deliv-
ered its own solution: AOL Instant Messenger
(fondly known as AIM to most of the world).
Thanks to the wonders of modern technology,
AIM lets non-AOL members send and receive
instant messages, chatting away with both the
America Online member population and every-
one else who signs up for the AIM service.
When you (an America Online subscriber)
receive an instant message from someone
using AIM (but with a screen name not on your
Buddy List), the message doesn’t simply pop up.
Instead, the new IM Catcher dialog box (keyword
IM Catcher) appears, saying that an Internet
user sent you a message. For more about the IM
Catcher, see the section “Intercepting Messages
with the IM Catcher” also in this chapter.
In general, if you don’t recognize the screen
name sending the message, click either the Block
or Ignore button on the IM Catcher window.
(That’s a good, general online safety rule.)
America Online’s Terms of Service don’t apply
to AIM members, so nothing stops them from
sending whatever they want. (Drat the luck!)

The top of the Instant Message window tells you the screen name of the person
who just “dinged” you. Just below that is the incoming message area, where
your friend’s half of the online conversation takes place. The bottom half of
the window forms your writing desk, where you compose witty thoughts and
decorate them with the formatting buttons. Although it’s small, the IM window
packs in everything from formatting to file sharing, with voice and video, too.
That’s a lot of zing for such a limited space. Here’s a closer look at the IM
window’s array of communication tools:
 Adjust Font: Nothing spices up a mundane IM conversation like wild for-
matting, so the programmers put the various text formatting options
within easy reach. Click the first button in the IM window for everything
text related, including font, point size, bold, italic, and underline, plus a
rainbow of foreground and background colors.
 Insert Smiley: A happy face adorns the Insert Smiley button. Click it to
reveal a drop-down list with 16 faces. Whether you feel angelic, blue, or
beyond cool, you find a smiley to add pizzazz to your text. The Change
Smileys button at the bottom of the Insert Smiley list takes you to the
My Expressions window, where you can pick your ultimate smiley collec-
tion from a bewildering array of options.
 Insert Favorite Place: When the conversation turns to your favorite
America Online areas and Web sites, click the Insert Favorite Place button
to throw a link straight from your Favorites Places list into the instant
message. Just find the link in the window that appears, and then click it.
The AOL software automatically copies the link into your half of the IM
window, ready for sending.
Figure 13-1:
An instant

appears.

Chapter 13: Dropping a Quick “Hello” with Instant Messages

 Send Instant Greeting: It’s a penguin — well, actually it’s a penguin
button. (Real penguins need more than mere software to survive.) This
dapper little guy marks the IM window’s new Send Instant Greeting
button. Click this button to deliver a fun multimedia wish to your IM
partner. Unlike the cards in the American Greetings area (keyword
American Greetings), Instant Greetings cost nothing except the time 
to make, send, and receive them.
 Spell Check: This tool catches those miz-spelt words that creep into
everyone’s writing. When you finish writing an IM, click the Spell Check
button and then follow along carefully as the America Online software
puts your spelling to the test.
 Share Music: Click the musical notes button to turn up the music in your
Instant Message window. This button brings up the Music Share dialog
box, offering several musical selections that you can listen to and share
with a friend through IM. (Of course, you can always share them without
listening first, but you both might be in for a surprise.) The Music Share
dialog box usually includes a mixture of audio and video, along with an
AOL Radio channel. To share music, just click the Share button in the
Music Share dialog box.
 Start AOL Talk Session and Start AOL Video Messenger Session: No
matter how hard it tries, sometimes plain text (and even formatted text)
just doesn’t convey the shades of emotion contained in IM notes like
“Oh crud-on-a-stick! I just got punted again.” Moments like this don’t
fully communicate the raw emotion without the agitated sound of a live
voice or the image of the perturbed human on the other end of the line.
Thanks to some dandy AOL 9.0 innovations, the Instant Message system
now includes two multimedia communication tools that solve that exact
problem.
• The AOL Talk tool (the phone button) lets you speak directly to
the other member, provided both your computer and your friend’s
include a microphone and speakers.
• The AOL Video Messenger service (behind the video camera
button) sends your friend either a video from your handy Web
camera or a funny clip provided by either AOL or yourself.
Even with the hassle and expense (minimal on both counts) of the 
extra techno-gear to make these things work, both AOL Talk and AOL
Video Messenger are very fun and cool features. Try these with a friend
sometime!
190
Part III: Connecting and Communicating 

 Send Picture and Send File: With all of this advanced communication
going on in your IM windows, words barely take up enough space. To
make the most of these tools, try sharing pictures or trading files back
and forth between your computer and your friend’s machine with the
Send Picture and Send File options. The Send Picture button builds a
mini-photo collection right there in the IM window for you and your
friend to flip through. The Send File button handles a quick transfer of
data files between the two machines.
Along the bottom of the Instant Message window sits a bunch of action 
buttons:
 Send ships your message away to the recipient.
 Close makes the message go away, never to be seen or heard from again.
 Add Buddy does just what it says — it puts the sender’s screen name
from the instant message into your Buddy List. After clicking the Add
Buddy button, the AOL software asks which group you want to put the
person into. It also helps you create a new group for this buddy if you
prefer that option.
 Buddy Info opens the sender’s whopping Member Directory dialog box.
You can send the person an e-mail, add your friend to your Address Book
or Buddy List, block e-mail or instant messages from this person (this
would be for ex-pals, I suppose), view the person’s Member Profile, and
see if he or she is in a public chat room — all from this one place.
 Buddy Chat works just like the Buddy Chat button on your Buddy List —
it creates a special chat room for you and your online friends. Both
America Online members and AOL Instant Messenger users can join
your Buddy Chats.
 My Expressions opens the My Expressions window, where you can cus-
tomize practically everything worth customizing in your IMs. Chapter 21
gives you the lowdown on the Expressions window and all its neat 
gadgetry. 
 If a fellow America Online member sent you an instant message, the last
button on the window says Notify AOL. This button reports password
scammers (more about that later in the chapter), abusive messages, or
anything that makes you feel uncomfortable. 
 If the instant message came from an AOL Instant Messenger user, nothing
appears in the final button slot — it’s empty.
191
Chapter 13: Dropping a Quick “Hello” with Instant Messages

Using these little instant message text bombs is easy — here’s how they work:
1. To see whether someone is online, check your Buddy List or use the
Locate command (Ctrl+L).
The Buddy List system is a great tool for tracking your friends online. 
To find out more about it, see Chapter 9.
You can only send instant messages to someone who’s signed on and has
the Instant Messaging option turned on in the America Online Parental
Controls area (keyword Parental Controls), or who is using AOL Instant
Messenger (AIM).
2. If you found your target with the Locate command, click the Send IM
button in the Locate dialog box. If you used the Buddy List, click the
person’s name and then click the Send IM button.
Either way, the Send Instant Message dialog box pops up.
3. If the person’s screen name is not in the To box already, type it there.
Then press Tab to move the blinking cursor to the text area and type
your message.
Keep instant messages short — 10 to 12 words. If you have something
long to say, use e-mail.
For some extra fun, click the Smiley button and include a cute little face
with your words. (After all, if you can’t have fun with instant messages,
what’s the point?)
4. After you finish typing the message, click Send.
If the message’s recipient is signed on and accepting instant messages, the
Instant Message window briefly disappears from your screen and then
reappears in the upper-left corner.
If something goes wrong along the way (perhaps the person isn’t online
right now, or you misspelled the person’s screen name), the America
Online software displays an error message to keep you informed.
When your friend gets the message, he or she can reply by clicking the
Respond button. Your friend’s message then appears on your screen, and you
can start a running dialogue. (That’s assuming, of course, that your buddy
feels like talking today.)
192
Part III: Connecting and Communicating 

Intercepting Messages 
with the IM Catcher
Over the last few years, AOL members discovered a deep love for instant mes-
sages. Unfortunately, the spammers did, too. Today, so many fake IMs appear
on the average member’s screen that the industry even coined a new term for
them — Spim, short for IM spam. To turn this tide back, the AOL programmers
added the new IM Catcher feature (keyword IM Catcher) to the 9.0 software.
The IM Catcher automatically sits behind the scenes, watching for instant
messages coming from people who aren’t on your Buddy List, because that
means the messages probably fall into the spim category. (That’s one more
reason why you should populate your Buddy List with entries for everybody
you know.) When a suspect message arrives, the IM Catcher window appears,
listing the message sender’s screen name, number of IMs the sender fired at
you, and the time of the person’s last message.
From there, you can open the IM, get the Buddy Info about this member, per-
manently block the member from sending IMs to you, or simply ignore the
current message. If a bunch of messages from different AIM members appear,
you can ignore all of them in a single step with the Ignore All button.
If you see the old-fashioned “knock-knock” message window when an unknown
IM arrives instead of the IM Catcher window, you might need to jumpstart
your IM Catcher. For step-by-step instructions on doing that, see Chapter 25.
Turning Off Instant Messages Because
Sometimes You Just Want to Be Alone
Life on America Online sometimes resembles a huge commune. The moment
you sign on, one (or sometimes several) of your friends immediately sends you
an instant message and wants to chat. For hours. Or days.
To check your e-mail in peace and quiet or perhaps do a little online research,
hang America Online’s cool Do Not Disturb sign by turning on the Away
Message. The setting is temporary, so the next time you sign on to the system,
instant messages are automatically turned on again.
193
Chapter 13: Dropping a Quick “Hello” with Instant Messages

To temporarily hang your little I’m somewhere else sign, follow these steps:
1. After signing on to America Online, click the Away Message button at
the bottom of the Buddy List window.
A swing-out menu appears. (Don’t ask why the Instant Message Away
Notice button lives at the bottom of the Buddy List window. I don’t
know, either.)
2. Click the Away Message that you want to use.
This selects the Away Message of your choice and turns it on immediately.
A little line of text also appears at the top of the Buddy List, reminding
you that an Away Message is on.
The America Online software comes configured with four standard I’m
Away messages. You can add your own by clicking the Setup Away
Message option in the swing-out menu, and then clicking the New button
in the Away Message dialog box. Follow the on-screen instructions from
there.
Your Away Message stays on until you turn it off by clicking the Away Message
button again or by sending an instant message. Either way, when you turn off
the Away Message, America Online immediately displays a little dialog box
that tells how long your Away Message was on, how many messages it inter-
cepted, the screen name of the last person to send you a message, and the
time that the person sent it. As an extra benefit, all the instant messages you
ignored immediately appear on your screen. (What a deal!)
To set up an Away Message, just click the Away Message button and then
choose the Set Up Away Messages option. A little dialog box appears for
making new away messages with the New button, changing your current 
messages with the Edit button, or killing a current message with the Delete
button. Let your creativity run amok here and see what sort of fun messages
you can write!
Catching Password Scammers
Whenever you collect millions of people in one place (even if it’s a virtual
place), somewhere in the mix you’re bound to find a few undesirable charac-
ters. At home, it’s the telemarketers. At work, it’s the slightly unhinged
coworker who lines his cubicle with aluminum foil to block CIA thought-
control transmissions. In the online world, it’s the password scammers.
194
Part III: Connecting and Communicating 

These bottom-feeders want only one thing: your account password. Nobody —
and I mean nobody — from America Online or any other company will ever ask
for your password. It won’t happen! No matter what they say in their message,
no matter who they claim to be, they are lying. Pay no attention to their drivel.
Instead, get ready to report them to America Online.
If someone sends you an instant message asking for your password, credit
card number, or anything else like that, report the person immediately with
the Notify AOL button at the bottom of the Instant Message window. Whether
the person claims to be from the America Online Billing department, a credit
card company, or Mars (which is where he or she should be), it’s all a lie. In
Chapter 4, you can find out more about this subject, including a few sample
scams and detailed instructions for nailing — er, reporting — these lowlifes.
Taking Instant Messaging Anywhere
with AIM Express
Try as it might, your computer simply can’t follow you everywhere. (After all,
even the most technologically affluent folks out there need some quiet time
away from their digital consigliere.) But the need to send instant messages
knows no such limitations — it strikes regardless of where you are or how
much technology sits next to you at the moment.
When the instant message bug bites during one of those computer-less
moments, don’t despair! If you can find anything (computer, online kiosk, 
or whatever) with a Java-enabled Web browser and an Internet connection,
America Online’s new AIM Express system puts you back into the messaging
action.
AIM Express combines the power of instant messaging with the go-anywhere
flexibility of the Net to ensure that the capability to carry on a text-based con-
versation follows you everywhere, just like one of those creepy black-suited
guys from your father’s favorite conspiracy theory. The system works with
any America Online screen name, as well as any AIM screen name. It doesn’t
take any special software or setup, either. Just register your America Online
screen name for use with AIM (that takes only a moment, and you can do it
from AIM Express with the big Register button), type your screen name and
password, and you’re ready to communicate.
195
Chapter 13: Dropping a Quick “Hello” with Instant Messages

The AIM Express system displays your screen name’s Buddy List, supports
Buddy Chats, and covers most of AIM’s other basic features. Not bad for
something that pops up wherever you need it!
Fire up AIM Express by pointing your browser to the rather ugly URL www.aim.
com/get_aim/express/aim_expr.adp. From there, click the little Start
button on the screen. Depending on the speed of your connection, it takes a
few moments to a few minutes before AIM Express revs into gear. After it
appears, just type in your screen name and password. When the system rec-
ognizes you, your Buddy List appears, and you’re ready to start sending IMs!

and Joining the Groups
In This Chapter
 Frolicking in the message board folders
 Peeking at the subjects and messages (and adding some of both) 
 Exploring your free group communications toolkit
 Setting up a group of your own
You can’t turn around on America Online without running into a discus-
sion. Whether you want to talk about music, mayhem, or something in
between (such as Branson, Missouri), America Online has a place for you
somewhere.
After finding your online home, it’s time to join the fray by diving into an
online discussion. Of course, you need to know a few tricks to make sense of
the whole discussion thing. This chapter guides you through the some times
obscure path toward joining a discussion group and posting your opinions in
the message boards for all to see.
Winding Your Way through 
the Message Folders
Before joining a discussion, you have to find one. To do that, cruise around in
your favorite online areas and look for an item labeled something like Chat and
Messages, Message Boards, Discussion Boards, Rant and Rave, or perhaps just
Boards. Any of these labels is a strong clue that you found a discussion area
with message boards awaiting your thoughts.

For the motherload of message boards, go to Message Board Central at key-
word Message Boards. This area contains links to just about every message
board across the whole of America Online. Start with the broad topics listed
in the first window, and then drill your way down to specific boards that cover
the topic you seek.
Because details always make more sense if you know the terminology involved,
here’s a quick romp through the top message-board terms. Ready? Here goes:
 Message boards usually contain a bunch of individual topics, each of
which works like a miniature bulletin board. Some boards — particularly
the movie and TV discussions in the Entertainment Community (keyword
Entertainment Community) — focus on a single theme, so they contain
only subjects, not multiple topics.
 Topics, in turn, list the member-created discussion subjects.
 Subjects contain one or more member-written messages.
 Messages hold your thoughts, carefully arranged and presented for 
maximum effect among your fellow discussees.
With all that firmly in mind, press onward for a more detailed explanation 
of the whole menagerie.

Part III: Connecting and Communicating 
Organize your favorite message boards
Like interactive chat rooms, lots of people find
message boards very engaging (which is a nice
way of saying woefully addictive). You get
hooked in the discussions on one message
board, and then find references to another, and
pretty soon postings, replies, and message
threads fill your entire online world.
Flipping from message board to message board
takes time, energy, and effort, even for the most
ardent fan. To simplify your whole message
board existence, America Online created the
My Boards window, which sits behind keyword
My Boards.
This window works like a customized Favorite
Places area devoted to various message
boards. It lists all your favorite boards in one
place, gives you search and message listing
tools like the regular message board areas do.
For hard-core message board fans and folks,
the system also helps you read the messages
offline, saving you online time (and freeing up
your phone for the teens in your life).
To add boards to your My Boards area, click the
Add to My Boards button on the right side of any
message board window. America Online auto-
matically adds that board to your personalized
message board list. When you want to check the
board’s messages, just go to keyword My Boards
instead of wandering through the message
board area, eventually digging down to it. Using
My Boards seriously saves your valuable time!

After finding a likely looking message board, you encounter a window like the
one shown in Figure 14-1. This window gives you an overview of every topic
and folder in a particular discussion area. The board shown in Figure 14-1
lists a mixture of topics (marked by the little card with a pushpin in the top)
and folders (with virtual manila folders, to show that each one holds a number
of topics or maybe even other folders). Because the online staffers in charge
of each discussion area organize the boards however they see fit, the organi-
zational details of each area vary widely (or wildly) among online forums.
Beside the topic descriptions sit the message board feature buttons. You usu-
ally see six buttons there, although the last one (List More) appears only if
the need arises. Table 14-1 lists the buttons, along with brief descriptions of
what each one does. These buttons filter the postings on a particular mes-
sage board, helping you see only the messages you want to see. Use them
well to make short work of keeping up with your favorite boards.

for a single word, for a phrase, or for subjects that appeared during a particu-
lar time frame. The search system looks at only the currently highlighted
message board, so make sure that you click a message board name before
starting your search.

Chapter 14: Posting On the Message Boards and Joining the Groups

Keep these tips and tricks in mind when wrestling with friends and fascinating
fellow posters on the message boards:
 Don’t fret if you double-click a message item and America Online replies
with a terse message saying This message is no longer available.
It just means that the message was posted so long ago that it was erased
to make room for new ones.
 Use the Signature option in the Message Board Setup window to auto-
matically add a few words about yourself to the bottom of each posting.
Remember that it’s automatic — don’t accidentally embarrass yourself.
Display the Message Board Setup window by clicking the small, but useful,
Setup button lurking along the top of any message board window; then
click the Signature tab to make your mark.
 Whenever you post a message, America Online automatically inserts your
Buddy Icon next to your name in the top of the message. To change the
picture used as your Buddy Icon, visit the My Expressions area at key-
word My Expressions.
 If you actively participate in a message board, save yourself a lot of time
by adding that board to your My Boards area. See the sidebar, “Organize
your favorite message boards,” in this chapter for more about that.

Reading, Replying to, and Generally
Browsing the Messages
When you find an interesting topic, double-click its entry to display a window
like the one shown in Figure 14-2. These topics are discussion subjects
themselves — the real meat of a message board.
In the middle of the screen is the Subjects list, displaying the first 15 or so
subjects open for debate. The Subjects list shows the title of the subjects, the
date and time of the latest posting, and the current number of responses. 
The Subjects list and individual Message windows use the same basic set of
feature buttons along the side of the window. Although each window adds
one or two unique buttons to the list, the majority of them appear in both
places. Table 14-2 lists the buttons on both windows in alphabetical order,
and offers brief descriptions of what they do. If a button lives in only the
Subjects list or the Message window, the explanation notes that, too. Some of
these buttons may look familiar because they also appear (or work very simi-
larly to) buttons you can find on the message folders window.

or click it once and then click the Read Post button. The message appears in
a window like the one shown in Figure 14-3.
After all the effort it takes to get here, the window works with surprising ease.
The message text dominates the windows (as it should — after all, that’s why
you came). Every America Online message begins with a brief header giving
the message’s vital statistics: subject, posting date, author, and a grim-looking
message ID that makes you wonder whether it’s harboring some secret code.
The message follows.
Along the side of the window sits a whole raft of feature buttons described
earlier in Table 14-2. Pay close attention to the difference between buttons
that talk about subjects versus the ones that speak of messages. Subject but-
tons affect a whole subject area, while message buttons only do things with
the messages within a particular subject.

cost to send them, receive them, or reply to them.
After your guests reply, they can swap messages
with attendees, get maps to the event, and gen-

photo library. Upload your own digital images or pull them directly from
You’ve Got Pictures (keyword YGP). Every group gets plenty of storage
space for several photo albums.
 Events Directory: Keep your group informed of special dates with the
shared events directory. Everyone in the group can add new items to the
list and look at what’s there. Members who also use America Online’s My
Calendar feature can copy group events to their online calendars with the
click of a button. (Isn’t it nice when software works together for a change?)
 Message Board: Debate and discuss the topics of the day in your group’s
private message board. Read and reply to posts from other members, or
send your thoughts out to all members by using the group’s master e-mail
address. Public and Private groups handle message board postings and
e-mail messages differently.
 Chat Room: If your group loves to talk, Groups@AOL offers exactly the
feature you need: a private chat room, available only to group members. 
 Automatic Buddy List and Address Book entries (Private groups only):
The Groups@AOL system automatically creates a Buddy List group with
entries for each member of your Groups@AOL team. In addition, Groups@
AOL also adds the group members to your online Address Book. (It’s that
“working together” thing again — I’m starting to like this program more
and more.)
So who can create and use these cool groups? Anyone. Yep, anyone at all on
the whole Internet can join or create a group hosted through Groups@AOL.
All they need to do is sign up for an AOL Instant Messenger name, which reg-
isters them in America Online’s Official Database of Known People. 
If you delete a screen name that you used to make a group or if you cancel your
America Online account, any and all groups you created suddenly implode.
Poof! No more group. To keep that from happening, create groups with your
master screen name and then invite your other screen names to “join” the
group. After these other screen names become official members, go back into
the group’s Manage Members controls with your master screen name and
designate the other screen names as owners. That way, if you delete one of
the other screen names, your group feels no pain. (If you completely kill your
America Online account by deleting your master screen name, your group gets
toasted anyway.)

Chapter 14: Posting On the Message Boards and Joining the Groups

Picking the right kind of group
To meet the broadest range of needs, Groups@AOL knows about two very dif-
ferent kinds of groups: Public groups and Private groups. The type of setup
you choose depends greatly on your goals for the online communication
system. The type of group also dictates how the group works — whether
people can join at will or if someone needs to hold the door and admit them.
Public groups look much like the community areas in the People Connection,
but they behave more like a glorified mailing list. Public groups get listed in a
searchable Groups directory, and anyone can join by asking or by just diving
in, depending on how you set up group membership. Because you created
the group, you maintain a lot of control over how things work. Every message
posted in the group’s bulletin board automatically gets copied to all members
by e-mail. Likewise, the system archives all messages sent to the group’s e-mail
address into the discussion board.
Private groups, on the other hand, are completely private — people can’t just
wander into your group accidentally. To join your group, the group owner
must invite that person to join, and the person must accept the invitation.
Unlike private chat rooms, where people can still barge in if they happen to
guess the room name, Groups@AOL keeps your group stuff safely away from
nonmembers. To get the most out of a Private group, members must visit the
group page regularly. Although a Private group gets a master e-mail address
just like a Public group, the e-mail features ignore the group’s discussion
board — they have nothing to do with each other. Private groups also get some
customizing features that let you spice up the group’s online look. (Don’t get
too excited, though — you can’t customize things too awfully much.)
Making a group for you and yours
Creating your group’s new online home takes only a few minutes. Before start-
ing, you need to make a few decisions about your soon-to-be-group. Get out a
piece of paper and your choice of writing utensil, and then jot down ideas that
answer the following bullets:
 Decide whether this is a Public group or a Private group. Public groups
get listed in the searchable Groups directory, but Private groups stay
hidden behind the digital veil, through which only invited members 
may pass.
206
Part III: Connecting and Communicating 

 Pick a name for your group. Come up with a few acceptable alternate
names in case someone else snagged the name you want. Public group
names can contain between 4 and 32 letters or numbers, including spaces.
Private groups name, for no apparent reason, can only contain between
4 and 16 letters or numbers but nothing else — just letters or numbers.
 For a public group, choose a short, spaceless version of the name, too.
This name becomes the group’s e-mail address. Keep it short, in the 
4- to 16-character range. Private groups automatically use their name 
as their e-mail address.
 Along with the name and address, come up with a brief (two-line)
description of your group. After all, the potential members need to
know something about your new group!
 Finally, develop a list of America Online screen names or e-mail
addresses for the initial members you want to invite to join the 
group, if you feel like inviting anyone at all.
You can change the group description anytime you want, so don’t worry if
you get writer’s block on the first try. It happens to the best of writers (and
occasionally to me, too). Likewise, adding new members whenever you want
is easy, so feel free to start with a short list of new members and pick up the
rest later.
With all of your notes handy, go over to keyword Groups. The Groups@AOL
main window opens. Click the Make Groups button on the left side of the
window to begin the group-making process. From there, AOL steps you through
everything, from picking between a Public and Private group, to figuring out
where your group fits in the all-encompassing Groups@AOL directory. It’s a
well-developed, step-by-step process that looks absolutely exhausting if I try
to explain it here. That’s why I’m letting you do this one on your own. (Well,
that and the fact that the Groups@AOL system is just so darned helpful.)
If you really, really want some exhaustive help about making a group, go to key-
word Help, and then type groups@aol help into the Help search box. When
the search results window appears, click the Groups@AOL Help link. A window
appears that tells you infinitely more than anyone really wants to know about
building AOL groups.

 Writing new entries
 Adding entries through instant messages
 Putting photos into your journal
 Making your journal talk
A
few years ago, a rash of online journals broke out all over the Net. People
started pouring their thoughts and observations onto simple Web pages.
(Granted, those first folks came from the geekier side of life, but just ignore
that for now and work with me on this.) Every day, and sometimes several
times each day, these folks added something new to their online journals. They
e-mailed links to their friends, who read the pages and then passed along the
links to others. Then the process repeated itself.
Over a short period of time, these Web logs mushroomed in popularity. More
and more people joined the trend, which soon exploded into a full-bore
Internet event, complete with its own term: blogging, a shortened version 
of Web log. Special blogging software even showed up on the market, along
with special sites dedicated to the blogsphere, the interlinked world of blogs.
(Personally, I think they need a new term for that one. Something about blog-
sphere gives me weird mental images.)
The new AOL Journals area brings blogging straight to your AOL account. It
offers a fun and easy way to share your words with the world, without becom-
ing a techno-geek in the process. The Journals system takes care of the techni-
cal stuff (like fitting your words into a column on a Web page) behind the
scenes, leaving you free to focus on what you want to say to the world. Your
journal entries can hold photographs, too, letting you show and tell your tale.
And it’s free — just another cool bonus as an America Online member.

This chapter introduces you to the Journals system, helps you find your way
around, and walks you through the steps to making a journal of your very
own. It also explores adding pictures to your journal entries, and gives you
tips for adding entries on the go through instant messages and the popular
AOLbyPhone service. A world of communication awaits you — and it’s all at
keyword Journals!
The Journals system lives inside AOL’s popular Hometown area (keyword
Hometown). That’s the same place AOL keeps all of the Web pages you
create with 1-2-3 Publish or Easy Designer. As you get into the whole journal
thing, don’t be surprised if AOL keeps mentioning member Web pages as
well. Because it thinks of both your journal and your Web pages as communi-
cations tools, it constantly talks about them both in the Hometown and
Journals areas.
Browsing the Virtual Journal Shelves
I’m a sucker for wandering the aisles at the library or my favorite bookstore.
The habit started accidentally when I was a kid. I couldn’t read the signs on
the library shelves (they were too high for me to see), so I just went up and
down the aisles looking for titles that caught my attention. I do the same thing
today, except now that I can read the signs, I start in an interesting section and
explore from there — plus I don’t get lost in the store as often.
Like the bookstore, the AOL Journals system organizes all journals in the
Hometown Community under headings, such as Careers & Money, Entertain-
ment & Games, Personal Interests, and Business Park. To find interesting jour-
nals (or homepages), just browse through the headings. Here’s how you do it:
1. Select Community➪Hometown from the main menu, or go to keyword
Hometown.
• If you already made an AOL Journal or Hometown Web page,
then your personal AOL Hometown page appears. It’s a rather
strange collection of information and links. At the top of the page,
it lists all the Web pages and AOL Journals in your personal storage
area (keyword My FTP Place). In the middle, the AOL Hometown
page highlights the world of AOL Journals, with links to tips and
journal-enhancing techniques. Way down at the bottom of the
page, you get a search link for AOL Journals and Homepages.
• If your screen name doesn’t have an AOL Journal or Hometown
Web page, then you see some encouraging text suggesting that your
life might be more complete if you made either a journal or a Web
page. (Don’t believe it — making them both is kinda fun, but neither
one qualifies as a life-changing experience.)
210
Part III: Connecting and Communicating 

2. Scroll to the bottom of the AOL Hometown page. In the Search &
Explore AOL Journals and Homepages area, click the All
Communities link.
The window rebuilds itself and now displays a master list of the
Hometown areas under the clever View All Communities heading.
If you feel like searching for a particular topic (games, photography, 
or jazz, for instance) instead of digging through headings, type your
term into the search box and click the Search button. When the search
results window appears, scroll through it and click anything that looks
interesting.
3. Find a heading that looks interesting and then click it.
If the heading contains some subheadings, then you get a list of those
(shown in Figure 15-1). If you drilled down far enough to hit some journals
and Web pages, then the system lists those.
The system mixes journals and Web pages in the listings, but at least it
marks them with icons so you can tell the little fellows apart. Journals
get a little book image next to them, while home pages earn a tiny house.
It’s awfully cute.
To see only journals or Web pages, click the Journals Only or Home
Pages Only link on the results page, in a section marked Explore. That
simplifies your searching a bit.

Chapter 15: Reading, Keeping, and Sharing Thoughts with an AOL Journal

4. Repeat Step 3 until you find an interesting journal or Web page.
You can always hit the Back button on the navigation bar a few times to
work your way back to the mast headings list.
For a quicker journey through just the Journals area, go to keyword Journals,
and then use the Search AOL Journals box on that window. Going this route
automatically limits your results to journals, saving you a bit of time, energy,
and clicking.
Sharing Comments with Others
Nothing brings out your own opinions quite like reading someone else’s opin-
ions. Because the whole journaling thing centers around communication, the
AOL Journals system includes an option that lets you post comments on the
journal writer’s entries.
Although the Journals system turns the commenting setting on by default,
some folks turn it off for their journals. Maybe they just want a safe place to
vent, or perhaps they simply don’t care for any feedback. Whatever the
reason, their journals don’t include any Comments links — and that’s just 
the way it goes.
If you feel like adding a comment to an entry in someone’s journal, look for a
This entry has X comments link, at the bottom of each journal entry (the X is
a number, usually zero, showing the current number of comments for each
entry). Sitting next to the total, click the Add Your Own link to add your com-
ment. The AOL Journals system responds by sending you to a comment page
similar to Figure 15-2. Type your comment into the window, check your work,
and then click Save.
You can’t edit or delete a comment you leave in someone else’s journal, so
check your work very carefully. Make darned sure you really want to say what-
ever you typed, and remember that the Journals system automatically tags
the entry with your screen name. Whenever anyone (including the journal
owner) reads your comment, he or she knows immediately who said it. 
As a journal owner, you always have control over other people’s comments
on your work. View the comments by clicking the Show Recent link (right
next to the Add Your Own link). If you don’t like a particular comment, delete
it by clicking the Delete Comment button. To prevent someone from adding
comments to your journal, click the Block This User button.

Part III: Connecting and Communicating 

Creating a Journal of Your Own
You — yes, you — have a story to tell. It might paint a picture of sunny days
and laundry flapping in the breeze, or twilight hours haunted with shadows,
uncertainties, and peril. It could define your daily life, or life as you wish it
were. Whatever direction your story takes, it’s still your story, it’s still worth
telling, and it really wants to get out (even though it went into hiding every
time you had to do a writing assignment in your high school English class),
so make a home for your story inside an AOL Journal. 
Before starting your journal, do a bit of planning. Your journal needs a few
things to get off the ground:
 Title: Keep this short, simple, descriptive, and creative. Your journal’s title
appears atop every page of your work, so both you and your visitors see a
lot of it. The AOL Journals system also uses your journal’s title as part of
its Web address, so shorter works better than longer. You might want a
journal called My Thoughts About Life, the Universe, and Peanut Butter, but
when the software turns that into an address, do you really think people
will type mythoughtsaboutlifetheuniverseandpeanutbutter? If you
rename your journal later, it still keeps its original Web address. (Sorry,
that’s just part of life, the universe, and peanut butter.)

213
Chapter 15: Reading, Keeping, and Sharing Thoughts with an AOL Journal

 Brief description: The AOL Journals software puts the description right
under your journal’s title when displaying your work. Because it also
feeds the description to the AOL Journals search system, make sure
your description includes terms that help people find your work. If your
journal covers a hobby, name the hobby. If you’re famous and it’s about
you, put your name in there. (Heck, if you’re famous, call me — I’ll help
you write your entries!)
 Community: Think about which Hometown community best fits your
journal’s topic. Is it business-oriented or for fun? When creating your jour-
nal, the system makes you pick one of several journal-specific community
areas, but later you can list it in as many other categories as you want.
(You add it to other community categories in keyword Hometown, with
the Select Community button.)
 E-mail addresses for your friends: When you finish making the journal,
the AOL Journals system gives you a chance to e-mail an announcement
message to your friends, family, and anybody else you think would care.
Having a list of your friends’ e-mail addresses and screen names makes
this step easy. (You can send more announcements in the future, so don’t
fret if you overlook someone. Just remember them the next time around!)
You can make as many journals as you want for each screen name in your
account — there’s no maximum limit. Many people keep a business journal
and a personal journal, plus another one for a hobby. (I don’t know how they
possibly make time to keep all of those journals updated and still do anything
in their lives, but I digress.)
Check your work carefully as you create the journal — particularly the journal
title. Although you can change anything you want after making your journal,
you can’t ever change your journal’s Web address. It’s permanent.
With the planning out of the way, it’s time to make your journal. The whole
process only takes a few minutes. Here’s what to do:
1. Open the AOL Journals window by selecting Community➪Journals
from the main menu or with keyword Journals.
On cue, the AOL Journals window appears.
2. Click the Create A Journal Now link.
The much larger Create a Journal window hops into action. Grab the
notes you made about your journal title, description, and such, because
that’s next.
3. Carefully type the name of your journal.
Whatever you type becomes the permanent name of your journal, so
make double sure that you spell everything right. You get one chance to
change the journal’s address later in Step 8, but after that, it’s a done deal.
214
Part III: Connecting and Communicating 

4. Press Tab to move the cursor to the Description field, and then type
the description of your journal.
Keep it brief — just a sentence or a few words works fine.
5. Press Tab to move the cursor down to the Community area, and then
select your journal’s organizational home.
You can change this later in the Hometown window (keyword Hometown)
if you decide that you don’t like it or if you want to include your journal
in more communities.
6. Leave the Simple Journal radio button selected. Click Next to 
continue.
As with the other items, you can customize your journal to the extreme
after you finish creating it. For now, just go with the basics.
7. If you want to announce your new journal’s creation to a bunch of
friends right now, click the radio button for that.
I suggest leaving this set to “No”. As you probably guessed, you can
always send out the invitations later, directly from the journal itself.
8. The window displays the Web address (known as the URL) for your
journal. To change the address, click the Change Address button and
follow the instructions.
If you change the journal’s address, only put letters, numbers, or dashes
into the name. Sorry, but that’s one of the Internet rules.
9. Write down the address for your journal, and then click Finish to 
complete the process. 
After a few moments, your new journal appears on-screen, stunning in
its blankness.
If you forget to write down your journal’s Web address, go to keyword
Hometown and double-click on your journal’s entry in the Sites list at the 
top of the window. Your journal opens in a new window.
Keep a link to your journal handy by adding it as an icon on your toolbar. Just
open your journal like normal, and then drag the little heart icon from the top
of the journal window into the customizable section (the right side) of the
toolbar. Pick an icon to use (I like the little red book — it seems appropriate),
and then type a brief label, such as Journal, for your entry. Click Save to finish
the process. After that, just click your new button to nip straight into your
journal. For several other shortcut-making options (including how to add
custom items to some of the menus), skip ahead to Chapter 21.
215
Chapter 15: Reading, Keeping, and Sharing Thoughts with an AOL Journal

Adding Entries to Your Journal
New entries form the lifeblood of your journal. Journals get more interesting
as you add more entries. A constant stream of new items draws people back
to your journal regularly to find out what’s new. Whether you drop a few lines
about a random thought or carefully compose a full-blown treatise about your
deepest philosophy, consistently adding new stuff keeps your journal alive.
Please update your journal regularly. Pretty please, with sugar (or sugar substi-
tute, if you prefer) on top.
To add a new entry to your journal, fire up your America Online software and
then go through these steps:
1. Open your journal.
Your journal appears in a window. (If you don’t know the address for your
journal, go to keyword Hometown and double-click your journal in the
list of your sites at the top of the page.)
2. Click the Add Entry button.
A new screen appears, with spaces for the parts of your journal entry.
3. Fill out whichever sections of the Add an Entry page that you want to
include in your item (as shown in Figure 15-3).
The AOL Journals system lets you include as much or as little stuff in
each entry as your heart wishes. If you only want to express your mood,
select a mood — or tell the world what you’re listening to right now, but
leave them guessing about everything else.
Generally speaking, you want to fill in everything on the form. It makes
your journal look complete, consistent, and cool (and that is, of course,
the ultimate goal).
4. When you finish the entry, click Save.
The system inserts your new entry at the beginning of your journal.
Each entry tops out at 2,200 characters, which seems like a lot of space until
you get rolling about your favorite topic. If you run out of space in an entry,
use the Copy and Paste commands to split the text into two entries.

Part III: Connecting and Communicating 

Tossing In a Quick Entry with IMs
The programmers at AOL must know how busy we all are, because they cre-
ated a very fast and clever way to pop a few lines of text into your journal
with an instant message. This trick works great for those moments you feel
like sharing a quick rant or perhaps a brief celebration.
To add an entry via an instant message, send a message to screen name
AOLJournals with at least four words in the message body. Whatever you
type goes straight into your journal as a new entry. You can send the instant
message from the full America Online software, AOL Instant Messenger, or even
AIM Express (www.aim.com, then click the AIM Express link), but you have to
sign on with the screen name that owns the journal. If you started more than
one journal with that screen name, the AOL Journals system instant messages
you back, asking which journal gets the new item.
Because the instant message only delivers text for the body of the entry, the
new entry contains no subject, mood, or music information. Although you
can add that stuff through instant messages, I suggest putting it in later by
opening your journal, finding the entry, and clicking the Edit Entry button.
Figure 15-3:
My journal
begins 
with its 
first simple
entry.
217
Chapter 15: Reading, Keeping, and Sharing Thoughts with an AOL Journal

If the thought of nerdily crafting a journal entry through multiple IMs sets
some technological corner of your heart to fluttering, send the message HELP
to screen name AOLJournals. The AOL Journals system replies with a list of
commands you can send via IM to fill out the other parts (Subject, Mood, and
even Music) of the journal entry.
Adding a Picture (Instead 
of 1,000 Words) 
Thanks to America Online’s amazing You’ve Got Pictures system (keyword
YGP), including a picture in your journal entry only takes a couple of clicks.
In fact, the AOL programmers automated just about everything in the process. 
You can include any digital picture stored on your computer (even on a CD)
or images that you already uploaded to You’ve Got Pictures. If the picture
currently lives on your computer, then the You’ve Got Pictures system auto-
matically uploads and stores it online for you. 
218
Part III: Connecting and Communicating 
Personalizing things to match your tastes
After making a few entries and generally getting
comfy with everything, invest some time with
the visual look of your journal. Play around a bit
with the journal settings and text formatting
options to make your journal truly as unique as
the story it tells.
Within each journal entry, you get all the clas-
sic formatting tools you know and love. The but-
tons above the text area handle font choice, font
size, bold, italic, underline, and text color (but
don’t mess with the colors unless you know
your way around a color wheel, because “ugly”
appears in many simple color combinations).
You can also add links to your favorite sites by
clicking the little world button and typing a site
address.
Try mixing and matching the text effects to create
something that’s uniquely yours. In my journal,
for instance, I start most of the entries with a big
capital letter (what the production folks call a
drop cap). To do that, I highlight the first letter of
the first word in my entry, and then make it Arial
Black, size 24. Poof — instant drop cap! 
The master settings for your journal live behind
the Edit Journal button at the top of your main
journal page. Click that button for instant access
to the settings for your journal’s on-screen layout
(number of columns and position of the feature
boxes), entry layout, color scheme, comments
(accepting or ignoring comments), name, and
description. This area also includes links for
telling other people about your journal and ban-
ning certain screen names from reading what
you write.

To add a picture to one of your journal entries, follow these steps: 
1. Open the entry by clicking the Edit Entry button (or simply add a 
new entry), and then click the Add Pictures button. 
The You’ve Got Pictures window launches. The tabs across the top of the
window let you switch between pictures on your computer, images you
already sent to You’ve Got Pictures, and items sent to you by other
people. 
2. Click the check box next to the photo you want to include.
You can include up to eight photos.
3. Click the Add Pictures button. 
You’ve Got Pictures takes care of the rest automatically, by uploading,
copying, and generally reorganizing things until your journal entry
photo gallery is done.
You can add up to eight photos to a single journal entry, so don’t go hog wild
with the photos. Adding pictures also slows down the journal loading time
for people using a dialup connection, so take that into consideration before
stuffing tons of full-color images into your journal.
In case you wondered, there is another way to add photos to your entries. Next
to the Add Pictures button sits an unassuming Add Pictures from Hometown
link. To use this option, you need to manually transfer your photos from the
computer to your file storage area on AOL. To do that, you use the strange
and ornery FTP system at keyword My FTP Space. I mention this option in
passing because, frankly, it’s nerd territory. America Online’s FTP windows
look like relics from the mid 1990s because that’s what they are. To make FTP
work, you really need more information than I can give you here. I recommend
heading to the FTP area in the Message Boards. To get there, start at keyword
Message Boards, and then click Computer Center Boards➪Building Web
Pages➪FTP Issues. (On a side note, if you think that was hard, just wait until
you tangle with FTP.)
Speaking Your Thoughts 
So Others Can Hear
At one time or another, you probably misread the tone of something in an
e-mail or instant message. C’mon — fess up. It happens to all of us. When you
talk to someone on the phone, you hear his or her voice speaking words, but
you also hear the tiny inflections, hearty laughs, and all the other inflections
people use to shade meaning into what they say.
219
Chapter 15: Reading, Keeping, and Sharing Thoughts with an AOL Journal

If you subscribe to AOLbyPhone, you can capture all those vocal inflections in
your journal by literally calling in your new entries. Just dial the AOLbyPhone
number, sign into your account, and choose the Journal Entry option. The
system instructs you to start speaking at the tone and to press the # sign
when finished. (Don’t you just love the computer voice? She’s so forceful . . .)
Follow the instructions and, in just a few moments, the system adds the new
voice item straight into your journal.
The next time you check your journal through the AOL software, the audio
entry sits at the top (unless you added another entry later). The system dis-
plays a little speaker button and a link to play the audio entry. It also shows
exactly how long the audio item is, so that people know what they’re getting
into. Anyone clicking the link hears your dulcet tones delivering your words
exactly the way you wanted to.
Of course, you can manually edit the audio journal entry later to add a title,
mood, music, and even written words (in case the voice thing was just a little
too unambiguous for your message).

is (ahem) challenging — or at least it was challenging before those clever pro-
grammer types invented the supercool search systems.
Whether you want something specific or feel like browsing aimlessly for a
while, start your hunt here, with the various search systems available through
America Online. This chapter reveals the search oracle’s mystic secrets, start-
ing with the Search button and continuing with a romp through all your search-
related tools. Whether you seek an online area, Web page, favorite quotation,
obscure fact, e-mail address, or business phone number, the America Online
search tools make quick work of the job.
Finding People: Sniffing Out Friends,
Acquaintances, and Other Novel Folks
Although the world of America Online is full of information covering every
topic under the sun, its people are what make life fun — people who populate
the chat rooms, fill the message boards, and pack the audiences at online
events. No matter what brings you to America Online, the community is what
keeps you there.

The tools in this section help you find people, wherever they may reside.
Each tool takes a slightly different spin on the problem, from locating friends
signed on to the system to discovering friends-to-be among the millions of
other America Online members.
Locating folks
The America Online Locate command gives you a quick way of finding your
friends. If you know your pal’s screen name, the Locate command tells you
whether your compatriot’s signed on at the moment and also reports whether
he or she is in a chat room. If your friend’s chatting the light fantastic in a
public chat room, auditorium, or conference room, the Locate system auto-
matically offers to take you right to that chat. (Ahh . . . definitely one of those
“Isn’t technology wonderful?” moments.)
Speaking of technology, America Online also includes a way for you to prevent
people from finding you with the Locate command (and through Buddy Lists).
To find out more about the built-in privacy options, see Chapter 9.
To quickly find someone online with Locate, follow these steps:
1. Choose Community➪Locate Member Online or press Ctrl+L.
The Locate Member Online dialog box appears on the screen, ready and
willing to do its thing.
2. Type the screen name in the dialog box, and then press Enter or 
click OK.
The system searches hither, thither, and even Yonkers to see whether
the person you seek is signed on to America Online, the European AOL
services, or the AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) system.
If the person is signed on right now (and didn’t block you through the
Buddy List system’s privacy preferences), America Online displays the
AOL Buddy Info dialog box, as shown in Figure 16-1. The system giddily
announces that it found the person and tells you whether he or she is 
in a public chat room or private chat room or just skulking around the
system waiting for you. If your pal is in a public chat room, the dialog
box also gives you the linked room name. Click the link to join your
friend there. The dialog box also offers buttons to send the person an
instant message or an e-mail message.
If the person you seek isn’t online at the moment, the same AOL Buddy
Info dialog box appears, but this time it says that your friend is offline. 
In that case, make sure that you check your spelling, because America
Online doesn’t say, “Whoops, you misspelled the screen name” — instead,
it looks for a person with the screen name you type, whether or not it’s a
valid America Online screen name.

Part IV: Diving Into the Fun Stuff 

Searching the Member Directory
Whether you like to fly kites during rainstorms while dressed as Ben Franklin
or meditate in front of the TV considering Zen and its effects on game show
hosts doesn’t matter. With a veritable world of America Online members at
hand, you’re very likely to come across people just like (or significantly simi-
lar to) you somewhere on the system. The trick is finding them — and being
found yourself.
To make yourself as findable as possible, fill out your online profile. Sign on
to America Online, choose Community➪Member Directory from the main
menu, click the My Profile button in the dialog box that appears, mark your
place in this book, and fill out the profile dialog box. After you finish, click
Save to save your profile information and then come back to the book. (Yes,
I’ll wait for you.) Now that you completed your profile, you’re part of the
Member Directory. Congratulations.
If you want an incredibly fancy profile that’s sure to make people stop and
say, “Hey, that’s an incredibly fancy profile,” flip to Chapter 20.
Now that your information is in the system, try searching the Member
Directory for friends-to-be. To do so, follow these steps:
1. Choose Community➪Member Directory or use keyword Members.
The Member Directory Search dialog box appears.
2. In the big box, type something that describes the people you want to
find: a hobby that you enjoy, the city you’re from, your occupation, or
whatever else you can think of.
Figure 16-1:
Hey — I’m
signed on!
225
Chapter 16: Finding People, Places, Things, and Information

Short descriptions work best. Check your spelling — you don’t want 
a typo standing between you and your friends-to-be! In addition, the
more specific you make your descriptive terms, the more useful your
results are.
3. Click Search to see whom you can see.
If America Online reports that it can’t find anyone, check your spelling
again (never hurts) or search for some other unique characteristic. If
everything works, the dialog box overflows with possible new friends.
(Okay — it doesn’t really overflow, but that’s poetic license for “you get
so many entries that a scroll bar appears next to the list.”)
No matter how many entries the search system finds, it shows you only
the first hundred, which is another reason to make your terms as descrip-
tive as possible. Searching under cars, for instance, could return thou-
sands of entries — so many, in fact, that AOL doesn’t even bother to give
you the results. (In this case, you see a dialog box telling you that your
search was too broad and that the software refuses to complete it. But
you knew that.) Using a more specific term, such as Chevy Cavalier or
Mercury Comet, gives you a list you can work with.
4. Double-click the screen name of anyone who looks interesting, click
the Send Mail button in the Member Profile window, and write a 
“Hi, how ya doing?” e-mail message.
You made contact — or at least started. Now sit back and see where
things go from here.
As you reach this last step, remember that you get only one chance to make a
good first impression. Make your introductory e-mail message witty, genteel,
interesting, and most of all, polite. If the person in question never writes back
to you, don’t take it personally — just search the Member Directory again and
look for someone else to correspond with instead. Likewise, if some people
reply that they’re not accepting new friendship applications right now, respect
their request for peace and quiet.
Finding friends with the Match Chat
Once in a while you’d like to have someone to talk with about your growing
tatting shuttle collection. Or perhaps you read sixteenth century French poetry
for fun, and you can’t seem to find anyone who shares your passion. (After
all, most of the sixteenth century French aren’t around anymore.) Thanks 
to a new feature called Match Chat (keyword Match Chat), America Online
searches for chat rooms that line up with your interests. When you fill out a
member profile (keyword Profile) for your screen name and list your hobbies
and interests, Match Chat automatically searches for those terms when you
first open the Match Chat window. 
226
Part IV: Diving Into the Fun Stuff 

If you don’t have a member profile, or you want to search with another inter-
est, the Match Chat window supplies a text box for that very purpose. (These
programmers think of everything!) After Match Chat finishes grinding through
chat room names and descriptions, looking for a set of chat rooms that match
your query, it displays a list of what it thinks are promising-looking chat rooms. 
If you know you’re going to be online at a particular time, schedule a Match
Chat for that time frame in advance. Keyword Schedule Match Chat takes
you to the Match Chat dialog box you need. You can schedule a chat for your
particular hobby or interest, or select from the AOL Top Ten list. Fill in the
date and time of the chat you want, tell the system when you want it to remind
you of an upcoming chat, and click Save. If you find you really like this sched-
uled Match Chat thing, you can even set the system to repeat the Match Chat
at particular intervals.
Searching the Match Chat system takes only a few steps. Here’s what to do:
1. Choose Community➪Match Chat from the menu or use keyword
Match Chat to open the Match Chat system.
The Match Chat dialog box opens. If you have interests and hobbies listed
in your member profile, it begins to search on the first word it finds in that
section of your profile. Otherwise, the dialog box sits and awaits your
instructions.
2. Fill in the topic of your current interest, and then click Search.
The Match Chat system chews on your information for a while and then
displays its search results (this may take a while). After the system finds
a plausible set of chat room titles, it lists them in a new, expanded Match
Chat window. If you see more than one screen of chat options, scroll
through the list using the Next link until you find the specific chat that
you want.
227
Chapter 16: Finding People, Places, Things, and Information
Getting there on the first try with online maps
Traveling the online world makes for some inter-
esting trips, particularly when you get side-
tracked along the way. You never know what
you’ll find on your way to some far-flung digital
destination. On the Internet, getting lost is half
the fun!
Although I love adventure as much as the next
geek, getting lost in the real world (you know —
the one with sunshine, construction crews, and
bird droppings) isn’t a particularly fun thing.
That’s why I always hit America Online’s home
for driving directions and maps, the popular
MapQuest site (keyword Maps).
This area includes browsable, printable maps of
the known universe (well, at least the terrestrial
parts), plus step-by-step driving directions and
a complete trip planner. And it’s free — did I
mention that?

If you have a profile entry already keeping Match Chat busy, a dialog box
appears stating that you have a search in progress, thank you, but if you
want to end the current search and start your own, click Yes. Go ahead
and click the Yes button, and when the dialog box disappears you find
Match Chat already busily searching out your new term.
Finding Places: Tracking Interests and
Meeting Informational Needs
Do you ever sit in front of your computer, staring at the America Online screen,
knowing that what you want to know must be in there somewhere? If only you
knew where to look . . . (insert wistful sigh here).
The next time that feeling strikes, fire up one of the America Online topical
search systems. These routines search not only the content areas in America
Online but also the wealth of stuff on the Web to match you with precisely
the place you want.
If you’re looking for a particular topic, start with the People Connection Search
feature (keyword People Connection, and then use the Search box), which
covers America Online’s world of discussion boards, online chats, and even
member home pages and relevant Groups@AOL. For more Web-based infor-
mation, try AOL Search (keyword Search) or one of the other Web search
engines discussed in the “Searching the Web” section, later in this chapter.
Find it on AOL
To track down an online community for your favorite topic, try the handy
AOL Search system. AOL Search takes any word you type (such as homework,
finances, or photography) and looks for that subject among the America Online
forums and services as well as a voluminous database of interesting Internet
sites. The system lists everything it finds relating to your subject.
To start searching, sign on to America Online and follow these steps:
1. In the white box on the navigation bar, type the word you’re looking
for, and then press Enter.
After a moment, the Web browser pops up, displaying the results of your
search, as shown in Figure 16-2. The system splits your results into sec-
tions: AOL Keywords (areas within America Online), Recommended
Sites (featuring Web sites and America Online areas), Sponsored Links
(folks who paid to put their site links in front of you), and Matching Sites
(other individual Web sites and America Online areas that match your
search term).
228
Part IV: Diving Into the Fun Stuff 

You can tell the America Online–based links from the Web links because
areas on America Online include the area’s keyword in the listing.
If the system displays a window apologizing that it couldn’t find any
matches for the topic you entered, don’t worry — you didn’t do anything
wrong. Instead, close the gee-I’m-sorry-I-failed-you window and search
with a different word. If you run out of terms, take your search out to the
Web through one of the other Web-based search systems, covered in the
aptly named “Searching the Web” section, later in this chapter.
2. Browse through the search results to see what America Online found
for you. To view something on the list, click its entry. To see more
matching sites, click one of the Next links.
After you click an item in the results list, the information pops into view,
either in the Web browser window (where the search information was
just a moment ago) or in an entirely new window (if the area lives inside
America Online itself). Pretty cool, eh?
3. If you find a site that you really like, click the heart icon along the
window’s top bar and then click Add to Favorites in the dialog box
that appears. 
The site’s address nestles itself among your other Favorite Places so
that you can find the site again. (For the ins and outs of Favorite Place
navigation, turn to Chapter 8.)
4. After finishing with that particular area, go back to the Search Results
window to look for other items of interest.
Figure 16-2:
Whether
your topic 
is generally
general 
or a little
esoteric, 
the odds 
are good
that it’s
somewhere
on AOL or
the Internet.
229
Chapter 16: Finding People, Places, Things, and Information

If the stuff you looked at replaced the Search Results window, use the
Back button on the navigation bar to flip back to the search information.
(Or, if all else fails, just start your search over again.)
5. To start another search, close the various windows and start over at
Step 1.
If you don’t feel like looking for anything else right now, feel free to close
all the search-related windows. (No penalty for tidiness.)
Digging a little deeper
The Search system has more than one button and a cool window. In fact, lots
of searching resources are all over America Online. The trick, as usual, is
knowing where to look.
The following list points out the other search-thingies lurking on the America
Online toolbar menus and skulking around the system:
 Search All AOL Chats (keyword Chat Search): Scour the service’s content
areas for interesting scheduled chats. Just type your topic of interest and
click the Search button to find a chat covering your Subject of the Day!
 General America Online Help (keyword Help): Cruise through the
Member Services area for tips and information about life in the online
world.
Searching the Web
Seemingly, almost everybody (including the local plumber) offers information
through the Web these days. That diversity makes the Web an incredible
repository of information — like a library filled with the collected knowledge,
opinions, and ramblings of a measurable percentage of the world’s populace.
Sounds almost too good to be true, doesn’t it?
Well, you’re right — there is a catch. Although the Web world is filled to the
brim with cool stuff, organizationally speaking it’s a mess. Imagine a library
organized by a tornado, with assistance provided by every kindergartner in
your hometown. Not a pretty picture, is it?
Shortly after the Web came to be, many clever people built indexes and search
systems to tame this wild digital frontier. Some of these systems exhaustively
scour Web sites, cataloging everything there so that you can find information
through keyword searches. Others take a slightly different approach by build-
ing a topic index that you browse by clicking menus. Both systems have their
advantages, depending on what you want to find and how you want to look
for it.
230
Part IV: Diving Into the Fun Stuff 

The America Online foray into the world of Web searching is AOL Search
(keyword Search). AOL Search gives you the best of both worlds by offering
both a searchable database and a browsable Website Directory — although
the list of subjects is somewhat limited right now — as the following list
describes:
 Go topic hopping through AOL Search: Just click one of the links in the
category list that appears in the Website Directory window — you get
there by clicking the Website Directory link in the main AOL Search
browser window. Each of these links leads to more-detailed lists. Just
keep clicking until you dig your way down to a particular site that meets
your needs. If you click your way to the bottom of the barrel without
finding a good match, try a keyword search instead.
 Use the AOL Search fill-in-the-blank search option: Type a word or two
describing your topic in the box at the top of the AOL Search window
and then click the ever-exuberant Search button. After chewing on your
request for a few moments, AOL Search returns with a list of matching
sites. To view any of the matches, just click the site’s entry. Sometimes,
AOL Search uncovers so many possible matches that they don’t fit 
on one screen. In that case, AOL Search presents a Next button at the
bottom of the window. Click that button to view the next page of match-
ing entries.
If AOL Search can’t come up with anything that matches your topic, it quietly
tells you of its failure and often implies that the problem is somehow your fault.
Don’t believe it — it lies. If this problem crops up during your search, take
your topic to another of the Web’s search engines, which I list in Table 16-1.
Some engines, notably Yahoo!, provide automatic links to other popular search
systems when they display your search results (just in case you want to try
your luck elsewhere). To use one of the other search systems, type the address
from Table 16-1 into the big box on the navigation bar.

Chapter 16: Finding People, Places, Things, and Information

Browsing through some great resources
Sometimes nailing down precisely what you want to find isn’t easy. Instead of
being a simple, cut-and-dried topic, your goal is more vague — sort of an I’ll-
know-it-when-I-see-it feeling. Even so, you still need some places to start look-
ing. The general areas listed in the preceding section may meet your needs,
but sometimes a more narrowly focused source sparks your imagination in a
way that a more general one can’t.
The following list identifies a selection of searchable resources from all corners
of America Online. Some areas offer news, and others come bearing general
introductory notes. All these resources are free, which make them my friends
by default:
 The king of general references has to be the Research & Learn Channel’s
More References window (keyword More References). Just look at the
list in that window — topics ranging from etiquette to personal finance,
plus even more that scroll off-screen! No matter what kind of information
you seek, the More References list makes a great starting point.
 Every schoolchild in the United States knows that stumping the encyclo-
pedias is hard (keyword Encyclopedias). Putting these general reference
guides online makes browsing and searching their content even easier.
 In addition to the encyclopedias, America Online offers many other classic
references, such as a dictionary (keyword Dictionary) and a thesaurus
(keyword Thesaurus). AOL goes a step further by offering specialized
word references, too, such as word histories (keyword Word Histories),
other dictionaries (keyword Dictionaries), and the beginning connois-
seur’s friend, the Wine Dictionary (keyword Dictionaries and then double-
click Wine Dictionary in the list).
 Writers need accurate and extensive sources to find facts for their stories,
but sometimes they also need information that’s a little off the beaten
path. For days when you want a good laugh or feel like adding to your
storehouse of the odd and mystifying, check out Straight Dope (one of
my favorite Web sites, at www.straightdope.com), Strange But True
(keyword Strange but True), and the ever popular Fun Facts forum 
(keyword Fun Facts).
 What report, theme, or presentation can’t use a good quote to spice it
up? Choose the best sound bites from several volumes of quotations
behind the Research & Learn Channel’s Poetry and Quotations folder
(keyword Quotations).
 If your research sends you looking for ethnic information, try areas such
as the AOL International (keyword International), Africana.com (key-
word Africana), or the Latino community (keyword Tu Gente). Each one
includes resources, discussions, and chats that may lead you to still
other resources in the Great Out There.
232
Part IV: Diving Into the Fun Stuff 

 Digging into the world of business? Check out Research a Company (key-
word Research a Company) for general corporate information, employee
thoughts, and a searchable library of press releases; Investment Research
(keyword Company Research) for financial reports; and the news by com-
pany ticker system (keyword Quotes) for the latest news-wire tidbits
about your favorite firms.
 The thought’s frightening, but the federal government is the single largest
publisher in the United States. It also generates more statistics than 
the law should allow. To dip into the wellspring of numbers that your 
tax dollars bought, check out the Federal Statistics Web site, at www.
fedstats.gov. If you’re looking for general information on any of a
great number of government agencies, see the Government Guide 
(keyword Government Guide).
If you need to collect information about a topic on an ongoing basis, check
out the News Profiles system, at keyword My News. You define what kind of
stories you want to see, and the News Profiles system scours the news wires,
automatically forwarding any matching stories directly to your mailbox. Setting
up a profile takes only a moment, but it keeps going and going, just like an
electronic news version of that annoying pink bunny. For more about News
Profiles, turn to Chapter 19.
Finding Cool Programs and Nifty Files
After working through the initial euphoria (and the first credit-card bill) of
owning your computer, the next thought that usually goes through your mind
is something such as “I wish that the computer could do X,” where X is some
incredibly important task that none of your current software and hardware
setup comes even close to performing. Worse, if you’re like most people
(myself included), X is quickly followed by Y, Z, and a whole horde of functions
starting with peculiar math symbols that you barely remember from school.
Sounds as though you need software — and lots of it at that! Purchasing com-
mercial programs to accomplish everything is a great idea, but your credit
card is still on life support from your computer purchase. Copying your
buddy’s program is out of the question (the software makers frown on that 
in a big, ugly, nasty way). What’s a computer owner to do? Search the file
libraries of America Online, that’s what!
The thousands of file libraries on America Online contain programs that
process words, mangle (sorry, manage) data, implode unfriendly aliens — the
list goes on. And these programs keep your budget happy because they’re
either freeware (free programs donated to the world by proud developers) or
shareware (try-before-you-buy programs that require only a small payment 
to the author). You may even find demonstration versions of commercial
applications.
233
Chapter 16: Finding People, Places, Things, and Information

To help you find the software needle in the online haystack, America Online
created the Software Search system. This system quickly puts the software
you need right into your hands — or, more precisely, right on your hard drive,
which is an infinitely better place for a program (software stains wickedly if
you get it on your clothes).
Get into the File Search system by using keyword Download Center. The AOL
Download Center window appears, with a lonely-looking search box near the
top. Fill in your search term to give the box something to do, and click Go. 
Here are the details on how to use the software search system:
1. Open the AOL Download Center window with keyword Download
Center.
The Download Center window opens, ready for your instructions.
2. Decide what you’re looking for, and type it into the Search box at the
top of the Download Center window (shown in Figure 16-3).
Next to the Search box you see a text box containing the kind of computer
AOL thinks you have. If you want to download something for a different
system, use the arrow to select from the drop-down list that appears.
Figure 16-3:
Tell AOL
what you
want to

in the

234
Part IV: Diving Into the Fun Stuff 

3. When you’re ready, click Go.
The AOL software search system does its thing, and it presents you with
a list of possible options that match your search criteria.
4. Browse through the list for something that looks promising. 
The list could contain electronic text (when’s the last time you lounged
at your computer reading a copy of The Odyssey?), photos, graphics,
screen savers, chat logs, software demos, freeware, or shareware. 
5. When you find something that looks interesting, click the Download
Now button.
A warning dialog box appears, asking if you really want to download this
file. Depending on your version of Windows, click Yes or Save to assure
your computer that you think this is perfectly safe. To change your mind
about the whole thing, click No at the dialog box.
The Save As dialog box then appears, with the name of your new file
already filled in. Determine where you want the new file to land, and
then click Save.
6. America Online downloads the file and then asks if you want to open
it. Click Open to see your new jewel immediately, Open Folder to see
where the file landed, or Close to continue with your AOL session.
If you downloaded a ZIP file (a set of files compressed together using a
zipping program), America Online automatically unzips the files and
places them together in a folder. 
7. The file is now yours. To grab another file in the same list, repeat
Steps 5 and 6. To start the whole process over and search for another
topic, jump back to Step 2.
Before you know it, your hard drive overflows with new files.
In the unlikely event that you can’t find what you want in the voluminous
America Online digital catacombs, point your Web browser to either
Download.com (at www.download.com) or Shareware.com (at www.share
ware.com). These two sites (both part of the huge CNET Web presence) carry
software for almost any use and occasion, including business applications,
utilities, and games. You incur no cost to use these areas (and no salesman
calls).

urn on the TV news and what do you hear being discussed? The Internet.
Go to lunch with some friends and what’s bound to either come up at
your table or is loudly debated at the one next to you? The Internet. Attend a
cocktail party and what’s on everyone’s mind? Well, if the party is boring,
they may be thinking about how much better the last party was; but to pass
the time until they can make a polite departure, they’re talking about the
Internet. (What’s wrong with these people? Don’t they have real lives?)
Rising from technoid obscurity to media-star status in just a few short years,
the Internet is still a mystery to most people. (Heck, it’s still a mystery to me
sometimes, and I’m paid to understand it!) In the hope of sparing you addi-
tional moments of fear and anxiety, this chapter explains a little about the
Internet (just enough to get you going) and a lot about America Online’s power-
ful Internet connections. It also unmasks the odd language of the Internet,
introducing and explaining terms such as World Wide Web, FTP, and newsgroup.
A big electronic world is out there, just waiting for you to visit. Grab your
modem and get ready to go Internet surfing!
AOL.com Basics
The AOL.com Web page (keyword Internet — go figure about that one) offers
a little bit of everything for the Web adventurer. The window sports a place to
enter the address of a Web site you want to visit as well as a fill-in-the-blank
link to America Online’s massive search system (also available at keyword

Search). The rest of the window offers information links covering everything
from basic Web-page building to online shopping, plus quite a few stops in
between.
Because it’s such a popular destination, the America Online software
includes a built-in hot key for the AOL.com window in the My Hot Keys area
(click the Favorites button, then select My Hot Keys from the pop-up menu).
Press Ctrl+5 to head out to AOL.com anytime you want!
So Just What Is This Internet Thing?
Hang on to your seat — I’m about to explain the Internet in four (yes, just
four) paragraphs. This may get a little hairy at times, but you have nothing to
worry about because I’m a trained professional. Kids, don’t let your parents
try this stuff at home.
The Internet started as a big Department of Defense project somewhere back
in the 1960s, slowly expanding through the ’70s and ’80s and coming into its
own in the ’90s. It was originally supposed to help university researchers
exchange information about super-secret defense projects, thus decreasing
the amount of time necessary to find new and ever more fascinating ways to
end life on the planet. The government linked computers at colleges, univer-
sities, research labs, and large defense contractors. The Internet was born.
At the same time, the seeds of today’s organized disorder were sown. This
research network connected lots of bright, intelligent people, and those
people started coming up with bright, intelligent ideas about fun, new things
to do on the research network. “I wish we could send messages to each
other.” Poof! The Internet’s e-mail system began. “How about a discussion
system where we can swap notes — kinda like an electronic bulletin board?”
Poof! The network newsgroups were born.
Then anarchy took over. Discussion areas originally intended for deep
conversations about megaton yields and armor deflection/implosion ratios
carried witty repartee about Buddha, the Rolling Stones, and kite flying.
Everyone with an opinion to share was welcome, as long as they could get
there in the first place.
Although the Internet slowly bubbled and fermented throughout the 1980s,
things suddenly changed when the mid-1990s arrived. In the span of a few
years, the Internet simply exploded in size and activity. Thousands of com-
puters and networks around the world joined the fun. Newspaper articles 
and TV news stories appeared, introducing this electronic colossus to the
238
Part IV: Diving Into the Fun Stuff

normal world. Non-computer companies linked up to the network as business
e-mail use blossomed. Millions of average people began poking around on the
Internet through online services such as America Online.
With that brief bit of background under your belt, ponder these important
tidbits before venturing into the online world:
 No single computer or place is called the Internet. The Internet is a col-
lection of millions of computers all over the world.
 No one is really in charge of it all. No one. Some committees and groups
keep everything headed in the same general direction, but no one actu-
ally leads the parade.
 No one knows how big the Internet is. Suffice it to say that it’s really,
really big — and still growing.
 The Internet is not free (even though you and I don’t pay extra for it
through America Online). It kinda looks like it’s free because you just
pay for your America Online account — you’re not charged for the
telecommunications time between the America Online computers in
Dulles, Virginia, and the rest of the Internet world. I bring this up only so
that you remember that someone out there is paying the bill; it’s good
netiquette to use Internet resources wisely, particularly FTP (covered
later in this chapter).
 Believe it or not, all this anarchy works if everyone’s nice about it.
Free speech is the rule on the Internet, not the exception. If you see a Web
page or read a newsgroup posting that’s offensive to you, you have my per-
sonal apology. But that’s all the sympathy anyone’s going to give you. The
communications code of the Internet is simple: If something offends you,
either ignore it or disagree with it, but don’t post a message suggesting that
“somebody ought to shut those people up.” An action such as that is sure 
to fill your mailbox with angry e-mail questioning your parentage and sug-
gesting that you do some biologically impossible things in the corner.
E-Mail the Internet Way
Perhaps you joined America Online solely to use Internet e-mail. (It wouldn’t
surprise me at all.) An Internet e-mail account is an absolute must these days,
particularly in the business world.
The America Online e-mail system makes Internet e-mail a snap. You don’t
have to remember any special commands or visit any obscure corner of the
service to send an e-mail message through the Internet. Just create the
239
Chapter 17: Cruising the Internet

message as you normally do, type the person’s Internet mail address, and
click Send. If you need a quick review of the how-tos of America Online e-mail,
flip to Chapter 11 or choose Mail➪Mail Center from the menu and poke
through the information there.
Here are a few notes about Internet e-mail that just didn’t fit anywhere else:
 An e-mail message takes anywhere from a few seconds to a few hours to
make its way through the Internet and find its destination. If you send a
message and it doesn’t arrive by the next business day or two, consider
the message lost.
 Yes, Internet mail messages sometimes get lost. No, it’s not the Postal
Service’s fault.
 Your Internet e-mail address is your screen name — minus any spaces in
it — with @aol.com appended to the end. For example, my Internet mail
address on America Online is jkaufeld@aol.com (my screen name first,
and then the extra Internet stuff tacked on to the end). If my screen
name included a space (making it J Kaufeld), the Internet e-mail version
would still be jkaufeld@aol.com, because the Internet doesn’t like
spaces in e-mail addresses.
 America Online’s very cool unsend e-mail feature works only on mail
sent from an America Online subscriber to either an America Online
member, a CompuServe subscriber (addresses ending in @cs.com), 
or someone with a Wal-Mart Connect account (addresses ending in
@wmconnect.com). Unsend doesn’t work on any mail sent through the
Internet (so think twice before clicking Send). Why can you unsend mail
to CompuServe and Wal-Mart Connect, but not to the rest of the Internet?
Because America Online owns CompuServe, and CompuServe provides
the software and behind-the-scenes connections for Wal-Mart Connect.
And there you have it.
Look through Chapter 11 for all the particulars about using e-mail both
through the Internet and within America Online.
240
Part IV: Diving Into the Fun Stuff
Consider getting an Internet book
If one of the main reasons you joined America
Online was for its Internet services, I highly rec-
ommend getting a good book about the Internet.
I personally suggest The Internet For Dummies,
9th Edition, by John R. Levine, Carol Baroudi,
and Margaret Levine Young (published by Wiley
Publishing, Inc.). No, it’s not because I have to
suggest it — I really have the book myself.

Topic Hopping on the Web
It’s huge. It’s interconnected. It has a funny name. It’s the most exciting, promi-
sing part of the Internet. It’s also a very cool part of the America Online suite of
Internet services. It’s (electronic drum roll, please!) the World Wide Web.
The Web is a most amazing place. Where else can you find newspapers, tech-
nical information, company product catalogs, a library of folk song lyrics, far
too many personal biographies, and a clock that displays the current time
with fish sponges? (Not at the local mall, that’s for sure.)
So just what is the Web? Like the Internet, it’s not a single, unique place out
there somewhere. Instead, the Web is a collection of interlinked sites conta-
ining millions of interlinked pages. The links between the various sites and
pages are what make the Web a truly cool place. Because anybody can add
pages and link to pretty much any other page, the Web keeps growing, chan-
ging, shifting, and generally getting better every day. It’s an information
browser’s dream come true!
A quick stop at the terminology shop
The Web just wouldn’t be a computer thing if it didn’t have a whole slew of
new terms and acronyms to baffle and amaze you. Here are the terms you
need to make sense of the Web:
 You use a Web browser to travel hither and thither through the Web.
The America Online software includes a built-in Web browser for your
convenience.
 A Web page is the smallest building block of the Web. It’s an electronic
page with information and links to other places on the Web.
 A Web site is a collection of Web pages. A site may have just a few
pages or more than a hundred. It depends on the site’s purpose and how
much time, energy, and effort the site’s builder puts into it.
 Every Web site has a home page. It’s usually the first page you see
when you visit that site. The term also refers to your own personal Web
page (if you created one) or the page that appears when you start your
Web browser (the software you use to browse the Web — see the next
section for more info about the America Online browser).
 To find something on the Web, you need to know its URL (short for
Uniform Resource Locator). This special code tells the browser software
what kind of site you’re visiting. World Wide Web URLs start with http://
(or https:// for high-security sites such as online banks). Instead of
241
Chapter 17: Cruising the Internet

http://, file download sites (known as File Transfer Protocol servers to
the geeks in the audience) use ftp:// in front of their addresses. Thanks
to advances in Web software, you normally don’t need to start Web
addresses with the weird looking http:// thing anymore. Instead, just
jump straight in with the www part (for example, www.aol.com).
 HTTP is half the magic that makes the Web work. The abbreviation
stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. All you need to know about it is
that Web site addresses start with http://.
 The other half of the Web’s magical underpinnings is HTML, the
HyperText Markup Language. HTML is the fundamental programming
language of the Web. If something has .html (or sometimes .htm)
appended to its name, the odds are that it’s a Web page. In everyday
conversation, HTML is a spelled abbreviation (such as “I’m working with
H-T-M-L”). 
 Don’t worry if you notice page names ending in weird things like .php,
.asp, or .shtml. Those pages work just like regular .html Web pages for
you, but they use different software behind the scenes to simplify their
developers’ lives.
 Links connect Web pages. When you follow a link, you click a button or
a highlighted word and go careering off to another destination in the
online world.
 Because having only one term for things often fosters understanding
and comprehension, the World Wide Web goes by several monikers.
It’s also referred to as the Web, WWW, or W3 (but only by the true geeks).
For more information about how the Web works, see The Internet For Dummies,
9th Edition, by John R. Levine, Carol Baroudi, and Margaret Levine Young (pub-
lished by Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
A few thoughts about Microsoft Internet
Explorer versus Netscape Navigator
The software industry rarely sees a war like the ongoing Explorer versus
Navigator Conflict. Microsoft, the reigning titan of software, stands toe-to-toe
with Netscape, rogue challenger and Internet upstart, while their respective
Web browsers duke it out in head-to-head battle, feature by bloody feature.
Suddenly, a new face appears outside the ring — egad, it’s America Online!
Yes, in a surprise move, America Online leapt into the Microsoft/Netscape
fray by purchasing Netscape lock, stock, and browser code. The pundits
fretted, the stock market roared, and the crowd collectively said “Hmmm.” 
It was a glorious day.
242
Part IV: Diving Into the Fun Stuff

What does all this corporate activity mean to you? That’s an excellent ques-
tion. I wish that I had an excellent answer. Here’s my insight, for what it’s
worth:
 The America Online 9.0 software relies on Internet Explorer, the Microsoft
product, for all your Web-browsing needs. The America Online software
and Internet Explorer are so tightly integrated, in fact, that nothing short
of high explosives (or a 12-year-old hacker with a free afternoon) could
pull them apart.
The odds are good that, even though it owns the competition, America
Online will keep Internet Explorer as its primary Web browser. (It’s part
of the deal to keep America Online prominently displayed in every copy
of Windows that Microsoft sells — arguably an important benefit to the
America Online folks.)
 Expect America Online to announce sometime in 2004 that you, the
member, can replace Internet Explorer with Netscape Navigator if 
you so desire. Even though the default (Internet Explorer) remains the
same, the challenger (Netscape Navigator) can sneak in through the
back door.
As with any look into the future, these predictions represent only one nerd’s
opinion. Other computer people probably harbor different anticipations, but
the odds are just as high that they’re wrong, too.
Taking the Web browser for a spin
America Online did a great deal of work to integrate the Web as seamlessly as
possible. It was quite a trick, too, because you need special software (called a
browser) to look at Web pages.
The Web browser, shown in Figure 17-1, is built right into the America Online
access software. The navigation bar, just underneath the toolbar at the top of
the screen, contains all the buttons and controls you need to traverse the
Web. Flip to Chapter 3 for all the details about the navigation bar.
To go directly to a particular page, press Ctrl+W or click in the address area
(the big, white box) of the navigation bar, and then type the address of the
page you want to see. You don’t need to include the http:// part in front of
the address, but it doesn’t hurt if you feel like doing it anyway. When the
address is in there, press Enter or click Go. Shortly, the built-in Web browser
comes to life, displaying your page in glorious color.
243
Chapter 17: Cruising the Internet

A few more details about the Web are worth mentioning here:
 In addition to Web sites, your Web browser understands FTP sites, too.
However, some pages have links to Internet newsgroups (more about
those later in this chapter), which, unfortunately, your browser can’t
understand. If you click a link and the browser displays a window that
says something like Cannot interpret link, it’s a clue that you just
clicked something beyond the browser’s comprehension. I hope this
difficulty gets fixed, but as long as I’m wishing, I’d like a pony and a milk-
shake, too.
 The most common Web-oriented error you see is something to the effect
of Sorry, I can’t contact that site (although the computers
don’t say it that nicely — they intone more ominous things, such as
Error 404 Requested URL not found). Double-check the address
and try it again. If it still doesn’t work, either America Online is too busy
to be bothered with the Web right now or the Web page you’re looking
for isn’t available at the moment. Either way, try again later.
 Want to take your Web browser for a quick test-drive? Try visiting the
foam-bath-fish clock at www.savetz.com/fishtime/fishtime.cgi.
Just type its address into the big, white box in the middle of the naviga-
tion bar; then hit Enter. The clock o’ fishies should pop up right away!

Newsgroups Talk about 
the Craziest Things
The Internet newsgroups are a collection of, oh, about 90,000 discussion
topics, from artificial intelligence applications (the comp.ai newsgroup) to
the latest Kennedy assassination theories (try alt.conspiracy.jfk or
alt.assassination.jfk). Newsgroup discussions get pretty wild some-
times, with ideas flying through the network. The language is often fairly
(ahem) to the point, so if you’re easily offended, you may not want to venture
too far into the newsgroups.
I want to be very clear on this point. When you venture into the Internet
newsgroups, you leave the friendly, trusting, carefully manicured community
of America Online and venture into the wild, uncontrolled reality of the
Internet. It’s the difference between the lawns of suburban Tulsa and the pot-
holed pavement of lower Manhattan. The Internet has no Terms of Service
agreement — anything goes (and usually does). That’s not to say that the
Internet has no rules, because there definitely are some. They’re simple and
unwritten, and they apply to almost every newsgroup:
 You’re welcome to join the discussion, as long as you take the time to
understand the newsgroup before contributing anything. Read a news-
group for at least a week or two before posting something of your own.
Also, read the newsgroup’s Frequently Asked Questions document
(known as the FAQ). If you can’t find the FAQ anywhere in the current
newsgroup postings, post a message asking someone to point you
toward it.
 Stick to the topic of the newsgroup. Posting get-rich-quick schemes and
business advertisements to the newsgroups is in very poor taste. People
do it, but everybody just ignores the messages.
 You may agree or disagree with anything that’s said. You may agree or
disagree as loudly as you want. If you disagree, focus on the point —
don’t degenerate into personal attacks. “I find your choice of facts
biased” makes a good reply to someone. Asking someone “Does your
mother always dress you funny” might spark a conflagration.
 You may not question a person’s right to say whatever comes to mind.
Yes, some points of view are, shall we say, distasteful, but some people
feel that way about what you and I think, too.
 If someone disagrees with you rather abusively (known on the Internet
as flaming), the best thing you can do is ignore the message. If you can
reply in a levelheaded tone, that’s fine, but it probably won’t change
what the other person thinks. It’s best to let the flames die down and
just go on with other conversations.
245
Chapter 17: Cruising the Internet

By now, I hope that I scared you a little about the Internet newsgroups. Well,
scared really isn’t the right term. How about educated instead? The news-
groups really aren’t as wild and vicious a place as I’m making them out to be,
but you need to understand that they also aren’t part of America Online —
they’re completely outside the mores of the America Online world. If you
visualize yourself stepping from your neighborhood into a completely foreign
environment every time you use the newsgroups, you start with the right
frame of mind. 
Functionally, the newsgroups work much like the America Online message
boards. Like the message boards, you go to the newsgroups — the news-
groups don’t come to you. 
Finding and subscribing to a newsgroup
As I said, literally thousands of newsgroups await you — and America Online
carries them all. To keep things from getting too out of hand, the newsgroups
are organized into categories by topic. Table 17-1 briefly explains the main
categories. Other categories (lots of other categories, in fact) exist out there,
but you can explore those on your own. Each category contains a bunch of
related newsgroups (or, in the case of the alt and misc categories, a bunch
of newsgroups related only because someone said so).
Table 17-1
Newsgroup Category Names
Name
Description
alt
Alternative — home of freewheeling discussions on 
just about any topic
aol
America Online — articles of interest to America 
Online members
biz
Business — topics generally relating to business on 
the Internet
comp
Computers and computer science — where the nerds 
hang out
misc
Miscellaneous — all the stuff that doesn’t fit under 
one of the other hierarchies
news
Network news and information — discussion and 
information-only groups about the Internet itself
rec
Hobbies and recreation — think sports and hobbies, 
and you have this one figured out
246
Part IV: Diving Into the Fun Stuff

Name
Description
sci
Science and research — if you thought that nerds 
were in the comp group, just wait until you look in here
soc
Society and social commentary — focused mainly 
toward both of the sociologists in the audience
talk
Talk — talk, talk, talk, talk (get the idea?)
Your search for an interesting newsgroup starts by guessing which hierarchy
the topic belongs in and then browsing through that hierarchy’s available
newsgroups. Simple enough, right? Here’s how to do it step by step:
1. Start your trip by choosing Community➪Newsgroups from the main
menu, or by using keyword Newsgroups.
The Newsgroups window pops up.
2. Click the Add Newsgroups icon.
The Add Newsgroups Categories window appears.
3. Choose a category.
Scroll through the list of available categories until you find one that
looks interesting. Double-click a category to see which newsgroups it
contains. A window listing all the category’s newsgroups elbows its way
to the screen.
4. Scroll through all the listed newsgroups, find one that looks inter-
esting, and double-click its entry in the list.
Yet another window, which may or may not tell you anything helpful
about the newsgroup, appears. 
Often, this step leads you to another window containing a browsable list
of newsgroups. In that case, keep browsing — the madness ends soon,
trust me.
5. Sample some messages and subscribe to the group if you like what 
you see.
For a look at the messages in this newsgroup, click Read Messages. 
6. If you’re sold, close the sample messages window and click the
Subscribe button to include the newsgroup on your subscription list. 
To pretend that you never saw the newsgroup in the first place, just
close the windows and go about your business.
Subscribing to a newsgroup may take a minute or two to allow the
America Online computer to think, ponder, and snicker at its capability
to make a human wait for something.
247
Chapter 17: Cruising the Internet

For more about reading messages in a newsgroup, see the next section.
7. When the Group Preferences dialog box appears, click Save to make it
go away, too.
After a great deal of digital consternation, America Online displays a
brief dialog box saying that the newsgroup is now on your list. 
8. Click OK to make the confirmation dialog box go away and leave you
alone.
Likewise, the Group Preferences dialog offers some advanced tools for
simplifying your newsgroup experience. (In one of those odd paradoxes
of technology, the tool for making newsgroups easier is itself almost too
complex to use.)
For now, don’t worry about the Group Preferences settings. You can
always get back to the window by clicking the newsgroup name in the
Read My Newsgroups window and then clicking the Preferences button.
9. Subscribe to more newsgroups if you want.
To subscribe to more newsgroups, just close the last few windows (click
the upper-right corner of the window) until you work your way back to
the Add Newsgroups window.
Congratulations — you did it!
If someone describes a marvelous newsgroup and gives you the Internet
name of it (which looks like alt.folklore.urban), you can use the Expert
Add button in the Add Newsgroups window and skip this whole menu-driven
process. However, you must know the exact name, complete with all the
required (and occasionally odd) punctuation marks.
Reading messages
Subscribing is, of course, only the first step. Your next task is finding time to
read all the stuff you subscribe to. Unlike mailing lists, newsgroup messages
don’t stack up in your e-mail box — they collect in some mysterious place
deep within America Online. To read what’s new, you have to pay another
visit to the Newsgroups window. Here’s what to do:
1. Choose Community➪Newsgroups from the main menu or use keyword
Newsgroups.
The Newsgroups window pops up.
2. Click Read My Newsgroups.
After a few pensive moments of waiting, the Read My Newsgroups window
pops into view. It shows the name of the newsgroup, the number of mes-
sages you haven’t read, and the total number of messages in that
newsgroup.
248
Part IV: Diving Into the Fun Stuff

Even if you subscribe to only one or two newsgroups, your newsgroups
list comes preset with some suggested reading, courtesy of America
Online.
3. Double-click a newsgroup to see what’s new.
A window that’s more a scrolling list than anything else (see Figure 17-2)
appears. The window shows the article title and the number of
responses in the thread (that’s the newsgroup term for discussion).
To see all the articles in the newsgroup (whether you read them or not),
click the newsgroup name and then click List All Subjects.
4. To read a message, double-click its title.
A window containing the message text opens. Read to your heart’s con-
tent and then close the window after you’re finished.
5. Read messages or reply to them.
To reply to a message, click Reply to Group. If you have a specific ques-
tion for the person who wrote the article, click E-Mail to Author rather
than post a reply to the newsgroup. To see the next message in the
thread, click the Message -> button. For the preceding message, click 
the <- Message button. If you’re thirsty, get something to drink.
6. When nothing else looks interesting enough to read, click Mark All
Read.
7. Click OK in the dialog box that wonders whether you really want to
do that.
This last step tells America Online to pretend that you read all the mes-
sages in the newsgroup. That way, you can quickly tell which messages
are new the next time you wander through.
Figure 17-2:
So many
articles, so
little time.
249
Chapter 17: Cruising the Internet

Contributing something
Reading a newsgroup is fun, but soon enough, you decide that it’s time to
post a few messages of your own. Adding a message to a newsgroup isn’t
hard, but it does take a few more steps than your average e-mail message.
Here’s what to do:
1. Pretend that you plan to read the messages in a newsgroup, and
follow Steps 1 through 3 in the preceding section.
At this point, the window for whatever newsgroup you want to post an
article to appears on the screen.
2. Click the New Message button.
A Post New Message dialog box appears.
3. Type a descriptive subject in the Subject area, press Tab to move
down to the Message block, and type your message.
A Use Signature check box sits below the Message block. If you want to
sign all your newsgroups postings in a standard way, such as John Doe —
Ace Contractor, Incorporated, or Sven, Lover of Adventure!, you can write
your signature once and then check the box to sign your name the same
way with each posting you send.
Oh — by the way — although the window says that the signature is set
in “Preferences,” it doesn’t mean the master Settings dialog box at key-
word Settings. Instead, you find it behind the Set Preferences button in
the main Newsgroups window.
4. When the message looks groovy, click Send.
When writing for a newsgroup, be brief and to the point. Say what you
want to say and then stop. Don’t go on and on and on. Whatever you do,
don’t ramble. I used to ramble, but I don’t anymore. And it’s a good thing,
too, what with all the newsgroup postings I write these days. Really.
5. Click OK when the system asks whether you’re serious about posting
the article. Click Cancel if you suddenly decide that the world is a
better place without your message in the newsgroup.
Unsubscribing from a newsgroup
Getting out of a newsgroup takes a whole lot less time and effort than getting
into one. In fact, it’s so quick that you’ll hardly believe it:
1. Open the Newsgroups window with keyword Newsgroups or by
choosing Community➪Newsgroups from the menu.
250
Part IV: Diving Into the Fun Stuff

The Newsgroups window reports for duty.
2. Click the Read My Newsgroups button.
The now familiar Read My Newsgroups window appears, which you
shouldn’t confuse with the George Bush “Read My Lips” window or the
William Shatner “Read My Books” window.
3. Click the name of the newsgroup that you want to kick off your sub-
scription list and then click Remove.
With only a moment of digital concentration, America Online unsub-
scribes you from the selected newsgroup and announces the fact in a
little dialog box.
4. Click OK to make the box go away. 
Although the group still appears in your newsgroup list temporarily, it
won’t show its face the next time you open the window.
A brief word about Parental Controls
The newsgroups offer a wild array of useful and interesting information, but
some of the stuff could send a shipload of sailors into a collective blush.
Thanks to the Parental Controls section, you can prevent such a thing from
happening at your house (assuming you have a shipload of sailors huddled
around your America Online account).
The Parental Controls for newsgroups are available under the cleverly
labeled Parental Controls button in the Newsgroups window. These controls
let you do the following:
 Block the Expert Add feature, which limits a screen name to only the
newsgroups that America Online chooses to list under the Add
Newsgroups button
 Block access to the newsgroups entirely
 Prevent program and file downloads from the newsgroups
 Block specific newsgroups you choose
 Block newsgroups with “adult” content
 Block any newsgroup that contains certain words in its name
 Grant a screen name access to the complete list of available newsgroups
If you have a child using America Online, I highly recommend blocking the
Expert Add feature for that child’s screen name. You may want to go further,
but you can worry about that later.
251
Chapter 17: Cruising the Internet

Because little eyes and fingers often get into the darnedest places, America
Online offers a strong, flexible group of Parental Controls. For all the details

FTP Downloading for the Nerd at Heart
If you think that the file libraries in America Online are a hoot, you haven’t
seen anything yet. Welcome to File Transfer Protocol, more commonly known
as FTP. FTP is the Internet’s answer to the Copy command. And let me tell
you, it’s certainly one answer.
You’re about to enter (bring up geeky music in the background) the Technoid
Zone, so keep a pocket protector handy. With FTP, you’re interacting directly
with computers all over the world without the benefit of software to protect
you. It’s you against the computer. If using Macintosh Finder or Windows File
Manager to track down an errant file on your hard drive makes you queasy,
you don’t want to try FTP.
You can use the America Online FTP service in two ways: by going to the
built-in FTP sites or by typing an address on your own. I suggest using the
built-in options at first because you can be relatively sure that they work.
 If you’re absolutely dying to discover FTP, check out the Using FTP
option in the main FTP window (keyword FTP) or the FTP help section
of Member Services (keyword Help).
 Trust nothing you download from the Internet through FTP. Assume from
the start that it’s completely virus-infested, like a little digital epidemic
just waiting to break loose on your computer. Virus-check absolutely
everything that comes to roost in your computer from the Internet.
 Yes, I’m serious about the virus checks. I do them myself.
All it takes to use FTP is a strong stomach for the technical side of life and
these instructions:
1. Dive into the FTP system with keyword My FTP.
The big, friendly, and nontechnical My FTP Place window opens.
2. Click the Anonymous FTP button. 
The Anonymous FTP window opens. Unlike the first FTP window (the
one from the previous step), this window actually accomplishes things.
252
Part IV: Diving Into the Fun Stuff

3. Scroll through the Favorite Sites list and double-click one that sounds
interesting. When the detailed site window appears, click OK to make
it leave you alone.
After a moment or two (or perhaps three, if the Internet is having a busy
night), the FTP site’s directory listing fills the screen.
To visit an FTP site that doesn’t appear on the list, click the Other Site
button at the bottom of the window. When the Other Site window appears,
type the site address in the box, and then click the Connect button.
4. If a file or directory on the system looks interesting, double-click it.
Different things happen depending on the icon that’s next to the item. If
the icon is a file folder icon, that entry is a directory; double-clicking it
displays a new window showing you what’s in there. If the icon is a
document, a dialog box pops up and offers you a View File Now button.
To view the document without downloading it, click the button. If the
icon is a bunch of disks, you’re looking at a program or a compressed file
that’s available for downloading. Sometimes you see the funny-looking
handshake icon; it stands for a pointer to a particular subdirectory.
5. Keep poking around and have a good time.
If you found the preceding steps a little vague, there’s a reason: I deliberately
made them that way. FTP really is more advanced than the Web or the news-
groups. You need to understand a lot of nerdy stuff, such as subdirectories
and types of file compression (including ZIP, TAR, and many, many other
kinds), before FTP makes much sense, and even more to get useful things
from FTP sites. Still, it’s worth learning about, particularly if you want to learn
the more in-depth techo-stuff. Good luck, brave technological explorer, and
remember to virus-check your files!

With their growing popularity and broad selection, online media chan-
nels need some kind of catchphrase, but at this rate, it probably won’t come
from me. Even though I can’t name it, I can still feed my growing addiction to
online music and video through Radio@AOL and the Internet’s many other
cool online music and video tools.
Audio and video quality jumped significantly from when they first arrived 
on the scene. In the late 1990s, online music sounded like a rasping cat in a
drainpipe, while postage-stamp-sized video presentations appeared so jerky
that they made walking pigeons look positively graceful. 
Online broadcasting really took off in the last few years. Thanks to the newest
software and faster connections, those issues largely faded into the past. Now,
silky stereo and smooth-as-movies images rule the day. As quality increased,
content options grew and multiplied as well. Even commercial radio and TV
stations joined the online world with streaming broadcasts of their original
programming.
If you never sampled online music and video before (or if, like me, you became
disillusioned during the early days when it just wasn’t worth the trouble), give
it a try today. This chapter forms your guide to the online media experience.
Starting with some quick background to frame the online music world, the
chapter covers Radio@AOL (America Online’s in-house music offering), plus a
whole Net’s worth of online music video channels. It also dabbles in the world
of MP3, explores putting you on the air as the keeper of your own online radio
station, and introduces AOL’s new online music system, MusicNet. Crank up
the volume and spin to some tunes!

Pushing Guitars Through the Internet
Takes More Than Strong Biceps
Moving music over the Internet requires a lot more technical prowess than
mortal humans realize — or at least that’s what the computer people told us
as they thrilled to the first hissing, half-broken notes that emerged from their
computer speakers through the Internet. It was an imagine the possibilities
but don’t look too hard at what we have now moment. In the end, the technolo-
gists delivered on their promise. Today’s Internet music sounds a whole lot
closer to radio or CDs than it did even two or three years ago.
Bringing the musical magic home to your machine requires a media player
program of some kind. Because lots of companies want you listening to their
music, the basic players cost nothing more than the time it takes to download
them from the Net. Of course, the expanded, extended, gold-plated versions of
the players cost some bucks (either all at once or through a subscription), but
you needn’t upgrade to that level unless you really want to do it. It depends on
what you want to see or hear, and how attached you feel to the whole online
media experience.
Above the cloud of music and video start-ups, two companies vie for the 
love and affection of the online media community: RealNetworks (www.real
networks.com) and Microsoft (www.microsoft.com).
RealNetworks created the granddaddy of online music software, RealPlayer.
RealPlayer (www.real.com) handles both music and video programming and
includes links and preset buttons leading to a rather surprising selection of
content. Its free Basic player provides all the functions and content that most
people need. If you truly love online media or want to enjoy better video
reproduction (larger images and higher quality), purchase its upgraded
player with the monthly SuperPass subscription. This gives you both the cool
player plus a ton of stuff from SuperPass, including sports programming,
music from the Smithsonian archives, NASA TV, movie previews, and more.
Real also offers its own subscription music service, Rhapsody. For more
about that, flip ahead to the end of this chapter.
Thanks to a deep, abiding love (and a far-reaching marketing agreement),
America Online named RealPlayer as its music software of choice. When you
install the America Online 9.0 software, you automatically get RealPlayer in
the process. Everything happens on its own — you just sit back and watch.
Both Radio@AOL (America Online’s new music service) and Spinner (an AOL-
owned company) use RealPlayer for delivering their tunes.
After observing (and enduring) the growing popularity of RealPlayer, Microsoft
tossed its own ball into the media game with the release of Windows Media
256
Part IV: Diving Into the Fun Stuff 

Player (www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia). Building on its multi-
media experience (and the fact that it is Microsoft), Media Player promptly
grew to a major competitor against RealPlayer. Although both companies claim
victory in the how many people use us online music contest, Media Player prob-
ably holds an edge, thanks to its bountiful free content and well-connected 
corporate parent.
RealPlayer and Windows Media Player work (and play) well together, so the
best of all solutions involves installing both of them on your system. That way,
you never worry about bumping into a media source that supports only the
player you didn’t install. (Whoops.) Because neither one costs anything, you
lose nothing but disk space by sitting on the fence and choosing them both.
RealPlayer arrives on its own with the new America Online software, so just
visit the Microsoft Windows Media Player site to add it to your collection.
Tuning the Online Radio
To reflect how proud the programmers feel about their accomplishments,
Radio@AOL sits front and center (well, a little right of center) on the America
Online 9.0 software’s toolbar. Open the player by clicking the button. After a
moment or two of whirring thought, the Radio@AOL player window pops up,
looking a bit like Figure 18-1. 
The stations list displays the various types of music Radio@AOL offers. A
catchall category called Soundtracks & More includes really unique stuff,
such as audio books, an all-comedy channel, and the ever-popular 1-Hit
Wonders channel.

Chapter 18: There’s Music in the Wires

Radio@AOL comes as part of your basic America Online membership, so you
pay nothing extra to enjoy the tunes. Of course, you still pay long-distance
costs if your local access number sits outside your range, but otherwise the
music is free.
258
Part IV: Diving Into the Fun Stuff 
Building a station of your own
During my stints at radio stations in high school
and college, the love of broadcasting got into my
blood. (I’m sure that some obscure homeopathic
treatment might get it back out, but I kinda like it
in there.) I still miss radio — mixing the music,
confusing the song titles, and laughing inappro-
priately during somber news stories — but
never gave up hope of hitting the airwaves again
someday.
Thanks to the Internet, my return to broadcast-
ing could happen at any time. (Frightening
thought, isn’t it?) Several pieces of software and
at least one site on the Net go beyond just offer-
ing channels by giving you the tools to make
your own online radio shows, live from your per-
sonal computer. Even more amazing, most
charge very little for the service — and some let
you try everything for free. You need a computer
with a sound card, special software from your
broadcasting service (free for the download-
ing), and the desire to come up with something
cooler than yet another collection of easy lis-
tening tunes from the mid ’80s.
Live365 offers the real online radio experience.
It focuses on musical programming instead of
chatter and gives you several options, depend-
ing on how technically involved you want to get.
The simplest option, its Basic Broadcast model,
gives you more than 100MB of space on the
Live365 servers for storing MP3 files to play on
your new music channel. The Live365 software
helps you convert your favorite songs into MP3
format and upload them through the Internet to
the system’s computers. You can choose an
order for the songs, or just let Live365 play them
in whatever order the computers choose. From
there, tell your friends about your new music
channel, and enjoy the fame!
Want to do the live DJ thing instead? Live365
handles that too with its Live Broadcast feature.
Whether you just want to insert a few voice-
over announcements or perform the whole
thing live on the air, Live365 walks you through
the steps of using its software or an assembly
of packages you gathered from the Net. Either
way, Live365 brings the fun of broadcasting to
everybody with an Internet connection.
If you feel a bit more adventurous, try do-it-
yourself online broadcasting with ShoutCast
from Nullsoft (the corner of AOL that brings you
WinAmp). ShoutCast gives you a whole box of
tools for building an online radio station, but it
takes a little more effort than the nicely pack-
aged Live365 option. Still, it’s very popular and
very much worth the time to look into it. For all of
the details, read the broadcaster documenta-
tion at www.shoutcast.com. To find a
ShoutCast-capable hosting service, type shout-
cast server into the search bar at the top of the
AOL software, and then hit Enter. The AOL
Search system delivers a whole slew of infor-
mation, resources, and hosting options. Enjoy!

Jamming to the Music Videos
Which came first, the music video or MTV? Darned if I know, but perhaps
future generations might care enough to find out. For now, just give me an
unending selection of online music videos, and let me sit back and watch!
A few companies tried offering music videos online back in the mid-’90s, but
the experiment didn’t quite work. The video looked like animated postage
stamps, images often didn’t synchronize with the music, and communication
speeds couldn’t deal with that mass of information, so the whole experience
jerked, squawked, and generally failed to entertain.
Luckily, six years of software and hardware upgrades changed the video land-
scape in wonderful ways. Internet connections — and even the Net itself —
move data a lot faster, and a constant stream of multimedia software upgrades
enhanced video playback to the point that it looks almost as slick as the real
thing. It’s a wonderful new multimedia Internet out there — and this is a great
time to try it for yourself.
Unfortunately, modems still bottleneck the process. Because playing video
and music at the same time requires a lot more information than just playing
music alone, music videos don’t work terribly well when you connect to the
Internet with a modem. (I wish I had better news, but that’s just how these
things happen.) Although music videos might work through your modem con-
nection, don’t expect miracles. Well, honestly, don’t even expect FM-radio
quality. The video player shrinks the image to a few inches or less, and some-
times blurs parts of the picture in a valiant attempt to keep the music going
when the Internet connection slows even further. 
All that changes on a high-speed Internet connection. Music videos look a lot
more like videos (and a lot less like convulsive slideshows). The faster your
connection, the bigger the video image grows. The video’s sound gets better
too, because faster speeds mean more information, which translates into
sweet stereo flowing freely from your computer. Without a doubt, DSL and
cable connections deliver the best online music experience.
Regardless of your connection speed, watching music videos requires some
player software, but if you already listen to online music, you probably have
everything you need. Both Windows Media Player and RealPlayer play videos
and music without any extra downloads. (At last — software that makes your
life easier by doing two things at once!)
259
Chapter 18: There’s Music in the Wires

Just to complicate matters, some sites use the Apple QuickTime player
instead of the normal software supported by the rest of the world. If your
favorite videos work only in QuickTime, download the free player at
www.quicktime.com (or www.apple.com/quicktime if the other address
doesn’t work for some reason). Why do some sites prefer QuickTime over the
more popular programs out there? It beats me. I tried all three players head-
to-head over high-speed and low-speed connections with a variety of media
types. QuickTime Player performed so pathetically in every test that I’m
amazed Apple bothers offering it as a product. Fuzzy video and choppy
sound quickly condemned QuickTime Player to the uninstall it now list. The
moral of today’s story: For music videos, stick with either RealPlayer or
Media Player unless you have no other choice.
With the software thing out of your way, move on to the bigger (and more
fun) question of the day: Where do the music videos live? With standard
online frustration, the answer is all over the Net. Lots of sites offer music
videos, but few central repositories exist out there to help you find them. For
a great start visit AOL’s very own Music Videos area at keyword Music
Videos. It includes a constant selection of new music offerings in all genres,
plus a link to AOL’s Music Video Archive (keyword Music Video Archive,
shown in Figure 18-2). The area definitely earns a two-thumbs-up rating!
Turning outside of AOL, the following sites serve up a good selection of
music videos, as well as music news, movie trailers, and other sundry goo-
dies. Launch remains my favorite of the group, thanks to its extraordinary
video library and support for both new and classic musicians, plus its great
library. And now, for the promised list:
 Clipland (www.clipland.com): This site gives you the broadest selec-
tion of multimedia stuff, including music videos, movie trailers, and TV
commercials. Unfortunately, many of its music videos rely on QuickTime
Viewer, so expect a lot of problems and poor viewing quality.
 Launch (launch.yahoo.com): Launch delivers the largest selection of
music videos at various streaming speeds to match how you connect to
the Net. Launch includes videos from brand-name groups you recognize,
plus a wealth of material from bands still working their way toward one-
hit-wonder status. 
 Video Music Network (www.videomusicnetwork.com): Courtesy of the
friendly folks at Sony Music, Video Music Network puts a variety of music
videos and musician interviews in your hands. Like Clipland, Video Music
Network relies on the questionable skills of QuickTime Viewer for its
video content, although it recently added Real Player support (probably
to quell the complaints about QuickTime).
260
Part IV: Diving Into the Fun Stuff 

Looking for a little more online video fun after the music videos? (No, not that
kind of fun.) Check out the previews for upcoming movies at Hollywood.com
(www.hollywood.com) or Moviefone (www.moviefone.com). Both sites make
great diversions for those times when you really should work on something
else — er, when you need more entertainment options. Yeah, that’s it.
Turning Your Computer into 
a Jukebox with MP3s
Nobody ever thought that two little letters and a number — assembled into
the innocent-sounding computer term MP3 — could single-handedly turn a
whole market on its head, create a new industry out of thin air, and start one
of the most ground-shaking moves seen in the music world since the debut of
the compact-disc format 20 years ago. Nope, I don’t think anybody saw this
one coming.
If you missed the tidal wave, don’t worry — MP3 files only started changing
the music world in the last few years. The truly wild changes are still to
come, and you’ll be there for everything.

Chapter 18: There’s Music in the Wires

What is MP3? Technically, it stands for MPEG Layer 3, which in turn stands for
Motion Picture Experts Group Layer 3. So what do a bunch of motion picture
experts have to do with music? Surprisingly, a lot more than you might think.
The folks at MPEG create the international multimedia standards used by
companies when developing all kinds of technology relating to images and
audio. Specifically, MP3 describes a way of squashing audio file sizes without
losing sound quality. 
Thanks to the combination of tiny file size, huge sound, software that lets you
create your own MP3 files from CDs and tapes, and the connectivity of the
Internet, the MP3 format took off like a rocket and never looked back. People
started recording their favorite albums and swapping them with other friends
through the Net. As that grew in popularity, online swapping sites like the
now pay-for-play Napster (leave your credit card at www.napster.com) burst
onto the scene.
At about the same time, some musicians and music companies started worry-
ing about file swapping, because nobody got paid from a swapped file. The
whole thing blew up into a seriously large court battle, where the record
companies currently came out on top, although the battle continues.
Why do I bring this stuff up now? Understanding a bit of history helps you
comprehend why some people go absolutely ballistic when you mention 
MP3 files. Whatever way they lean in the debate, everybody has a heart-felt
opinion, usually worn on the sleeve for quick and easy access. 
For you, all the controversy means that MP3 won’t go away any time soon, so
you should learn more about it. The best place for that is the aptly named
MP3.com site, at www.mp3.com. In addition to its amazing library of down-
loadable MP3 files, the site gives you a good introduction to the entire MP3
world. Get the software you need to join the revolution, learn more about
making your own MP3 files, and stay abreast of the hottest music trends — 
it all happens at this one site.
Start dabbling in the MP3 world by downloading one of the player programs
out there. Although lots of programs handle MP3 files, two applications stand
out above the rest. The first, WinAmp (www.winamp.com), holds the lead as
the best MP3 player. It’s free for the downloading, and it handles everything
you need for exploring and enjoying the world of MP3 music. (Also, America
Online owns WinAmp, so there’s some kind of appropriateness to using
WinAmp on top of your America Online connection.) 
For a spin at recording (or ripping, as the techno-geeks say), turn your atten-
tion to MusicMatch Jukebox (www.musicmatch.com). It plays MP3 files like a
trooper, but it also includes a full-featured recording system for turning CDs,
tapes, and even LPs into high-quality MP3 files. I even used it on a laptop to
record live seminars! 
262
Part IV: Diving Into the Fun Stuff 

MusicMatch Jukebox comes in a free version, as well as a feature-laden Plus
version that costs $19.95. Go ahead and try the free version, but come back
and get Plus later. It makes a huge difference.
Buying and Burning Your Favorite Songs
After a lot of hesitation, many arguments, and a few well-placed lawsuits, the
music industry seems to finally understand that people want access to their
music online, and that they might actually pay for the privilege if some way
existed for them to do that. Granted, this thought went through a long gesta-
tion period, but at least the industry finally birthed it. If human babies took
this long to emerge, women would never get pregnant.
This great online birthing brought many new music services into the world,
including everything from a new, improved, and payment-oriented Napster
(www.napster.com) to the impressive-looking Real One Rhapsody system
(www.listen.com) from the Real Audio folks. 
Not to be outdone, America Online introduced its own pay-for-play music
system, integrated directly into the AOL service. AOL dubbed the service
MusicNet (keyword MusicNet), presumably in honor of the system’s mixture
of music and the Internet, or maybe because they thought the clever name
might simply sell better. (Who knows what goes on in the minds of marketing
people?) 
MusicNet’s broad selection sets it apart from the other online music systems.
Drawing from all corners of the music world, MusicNet puts a little over
400,000 songs at your beck and call. Like all of the services, MusicNet offers
CD-quality sound for a great listening experience.
You sign up for this premium service separately from your regular AOL mem-
bership fee, just like all of the other online music services. Rather than leave
you with just a couple of subscription options, MusicNet puts four tasty musi-
cal platters on the table, letting you pick and choose exactly what you want:
 The Basic subscription sets you back a paltry $3.95 per month, but it
only gives you access to 20 songs a month. 
 With the Standard level, the price goes up to $8.95 per month, but now
you get to enjoy as many songs as you want, either online or by down-
loading them to your computer. 
 The service’s two top-priced options, Deluxe at $13.95 and Premium at
$17.95, let you burn music onto CDs.
263
Chapter 18: There’s Music in the Wires

Like so many other subscriptions in the world, remember that MusicNet’s
goal involves hooking you into the service and getting you to pony up some
money each month. The free limited-time offer automatically morphs into an
$8.95 per month Standard level membership after the trial period ends. If you
decide that you love MusicNet, then all’s the better. However, if you tried
MusicNet but you didn’t love it, call AOL’s famous Customer Service depart-
ment at 866-278-6582 and cancel your subscription.
What could make a music-loving AOL member’s heart even happier than
MusicNet? How about a direct connection to Apple’s popular iTunes system
(www.itunes.com, and probably keyword iTunes by the time you read this)
as well? Yes, as I write this, America Online and Apple just announced a part-
nership that promises to roll out iTunes to the many millions of America
Online subscribers. Look for delightful goodies such as a single-click registra-
tion system to join iTunes, plus direct song links throughout the whole AOL
Music area (keyword Music). This service looks really promising (and that’s
from someone who’s barely on speaking terms with his Mac laptop).
But here’s the big question: Why would AOL promote iTunes when it directly
competes with MusicNet? At first, my inside sources offered the official com-
pany line about “offering increased choice for the members in the midst of an
uncertain time in music technology.” Translated, that means nobody knows
where the whole online music business will go in the future. Rather than stake
a claim to what might be a tiny slice of the market, AOL decided to broaden its
offerings in hopes of landing a winning technology. Very clever work, AOL —
that’s good thinking.

N
ews plays a big role in our lives. It’s our link to the community, the
country, and the world. (I can almost hear the national anthem playing!)
From the looks of the News channel lineup, America Online values news
pretty highly as well because it offers so many kinds of news — international,
business, technology, feature; the list goes on — and costs you nothing extra
because it’s part of the regular America Online service.
Thankfully, America Online gives you lots of tools for dealing with the influx
of news, weather, sports scores, and stock prices. This chapter looks at your
options for getting the news, ranging from a casual romp through the News
Channel to a detailed analysis of the markets.
Look back at this chapter two or three times over the coming months. Your
information needs change over time, and a quick peek here may open up
precisely the news source that you need.
Getting the News
Most of the online news lives (no surprises here) on the News Channel (key-
word News), as shown in Figure 19-1. It displays top headlines from business,
politics, entertainment, and the world in general. The News Channel also pro-
vides links to in-depth coverage in the various news departments. Each
department, in turn, narrows the focus, giving you an ever more carefully
winnowed collection of stories.

266
Part IV: Diving Into the Fun Stuff 
Some of the most interesting news areas sit deep inside the News Channel.
Reading a two-paragraph news-wire story about massive changes in how
investors view online businesses, for example, is one thing, but reviewing

Filling your mailbox with the news you want
A little-known feature of the America Online
news system can save you a bunch of time if
you like to watch for stories about particular
topics or companies. Considering all the
resources on the News Channel, you often don’t
have time to sift through tons of stories to find
that all-important informational nugget. The
America Online News Profiles service (keyword
My News) solves this problem for you by deliv-
ering directly to your mailbox the latest stories
about the topics you choose.
To build a news profile, go to keyword My News
and follow the instructions. Start with something
simple, such as a single topic (I tried espionage)
or a company name. Let the profile do its thing
for a couple of days so that you can judge how
many new e-mail messages it adds to your box.
Adjust the items in your profile or the story-limit
setting to manage the incoming story flow.
The News Profiles service comes at no extra
charge with your America Online account, so
it’s definitely worth a look. One word of caution:
If you track an active topic (such as Microsoft or
unemployed corporate auditors), your mailbox
fills up in no time!

267
Chapter 19: Tracking News, Weather, Markets, and More
Chapter 19: Tracking News, Weather, Markets, and More
(www.wsj.com) or the Financial Times (www.ft.com) is another thing
entirely. America Online gives you quick access to plenty of other sources 
as well — such as Time (keyword Time), ABC News (keyword ABC News),
Business Week (keyword Business Week), the Nightly Business Report (www.
nbr.com), and National Public Radio (keyword NPR) — offering equally deep
and unique perspectives on the news beyond what the wire services have the
time and capacity to provide.
Looking for something specific or perhaps for a cool news photograph? Try
the News Search system at keyword News Search. Describe the topic you
want to find and tell the system where to look (business news, entertainment
news, photos only, or everything). After that, just click the Search button.
Getting the most from the system — or, more specifically, the best results
from the system — takes some practice. These tips increase your odds of
finding the most useful goodies:
 If the system can’t find any stories that match your search, try searching
for something more general (music rather than new rock groups, for
example).
 Likewise, if you’re suddenly the proud owner of hundreds of matches,
narrow your search terms (such as small business rather than business)
to cull the reports you really don’t want. Searching for a phrase always
brings better results than plugging in a single word.
 For a really detailed search, try using the advanced searching tools AND,
OR, and NOT. Table 19-1 shows you how they work and what they do.

The Weather Outside — Is It Frightful?
How much you care about the weather seems to depend directly on where you
live (I wonder whether anyone in Hawaii, for example, really checks the fore-
casts, except during storm season) and which generation you belong to. My
parents, for example, were denied weather forecasts as children, so they watch
the cable-TV Weather Channel radar for fun. I, on the other hand, took off on a
trip to Canada without stopping to realize that late-fall-leaning-toward-winter
means a much different thing if you’re 700 miles farther north. (Although my
cotton jacket froze solid on that trip, I managed to survive by wrapping my
head in socks.)
To avoid problems such as this one in your life, check out the America Online
Weather area, at keyword Weather. It’s one-stop shopping for every kind of
weather information imaginable (plus some you just don’t want to imagine).
You even find the Weather Channel store, where, presumably, you can pur-
chase your very own cumulonimbus cloud and whip up a storm in the pri-
vacy of your own home.
Among other things, the Weather area (see Figure 19-2) offers a quick forecast
for anywhere in the United States, plus detailed forecasts for both the United
States and the world. It even includes satellite and radar images for you to
look at and download. (They’re great for school projects or as practice maps
for budding meteorologists.)

Watching the Markets
Considering the amount of work and worry some people put into fretting
over their stock market investments, stuffing all your cash into a mattress
suddenly looks like a marginally attractive idea. At least you don’t spend all
your time wondering whether your funds are safe, because what kind of thief
is going to walk off with a big . . . um . . . did you happen to see where my bed
went? Hmm — perhaps something’s to be said for putting your money in
stocks, after all.
If you parked some money in stock investments, you probably want to see
how your investments are performing. America Online offers two unique
tools for tracking your stock market money. The first is the Quotes system,
which pulls up the almost current (delayed by 15 to 20 minutes, depending
on the market) price for whatever you want. The other system is Portfolios,
which makes short work of watching a group of stocks. This section looks at
each of these tools individually.
Quotes (keyword Quotes)
The only way that checking stock prices could be easier than the America
Online Quotes system is if the system could read your mind — but if it did
that, who knows what it may discover? Perhaps the world is a better place if
we just keep the Quotes system the way it is and not let computers peer into
our thought processes.
Getting a stock quote takes only a moment. Here’s what to do:
1. Open the Quotes window by using keyword Quotes.
The boring and sedate Quotes window hops into action.
2. In the Quotes box, type the company’s stock-ticker symbol, and then
click Get Quote.
After a moment or two, the stock’s information appears in the lower
section of the Investment Snapshot window (see Figure 19-3).
If the window mechanically mutters that no quote information is avail-
able, double-check the spelling of the ticker symbol you entered. If
worse comes to worst, click the Lookup Symbol link to find the symbol
that you need.
Repeat the process for however many stocks you want to see. To track a
number of stocks, using the Portfolios system is easier, as I discuss in the
next section. That system gives you some perks by offering more information
about your particular investments.

of newsy goodies of interest to both serious investors and part-time plunkers.
Here’s a quick rundown of what’s waiting there:
 The Market News Center (keyword MNC Stocks) offers quick graphs for
everything from the Dow Jones Industrials to the Japanese Nikkei 225,
plus selected news headlines.
 The Quotes window automatically includes a search of news articles
relating to particular ticker symbols. To see the headlines, pull up a
price quote for your favorite stock. The Quotes window delivers recent
articles from Reuters, the Associated Press, the PR Newswire, and the
Business Wire for any company you choose.
 AOL MarketDay (keyword MarketDay) wraps the day’s financial news in
one easy-to-use window. It includes a blow-by-blow description of the
day’s stock-price moves and links to several other AOL-based financial
information areas.
 AOL Business News (keyword Business News) takes you to the Business
window of the News Channel, for the latest in wire stories of business
deals and the companies that make them.
 Historical Quotes (keyword Historical Quotes) doesn’t tell you what
Patrick Henry said (although that’s how I accidentally found the area).
Instead, it sends you to the Charts tab on the Quotes page, where you
can thumb through previous years of pricing to clearly show how a
stock performed in the past. (Remember, as the gurus say, that previous
performance is no guarantee that you’re not going to all lose your socks
on this sucker the next time around.) Just plug a ticker symbol into the
Enter Symbol box, and then pick a timeframe for your historical chart.
Figure 19-3:
Things are
looking
good for 
the stock of
the day!

 Stock Research (keyword Stock Research) delivers stock reports, finan-
cial statements, earnings reports, and the EDGAR 10K and 10Q reports
directly to your hot little hands — for free.
 For moments when you want another opinion or want to buy something
now, the Stock Center (keyword Stocks) and the Mutual Fund Center
(keyword Mutual Funds) supply everything that you need, from final
analysis information to links to online brokers.
Invest carefully, and don’t believe everything that you hear on the Personal
Finance discussion boards. (Really: Do not believe all the chatter on discus-
sion boards anywhere on America Online or the Internet itself. For mounds of
support for that warning, check out the latest edition of Eric Tyson’s Personal
Finance For Dummies, yet another Wiley publication.)
Portfolios (keyword Portfolios)
The other side of the America Online built-in stock-tracking tool is the
Portfolios system, at keyword Portfolios. Unlike its little brother the Quotes
window, Portfolios easily handles a whole, well, portfolio of stock invest-
ments. Your portfolio shows, at a glance, your positions for all stocks, includ-
ing the number of shares, the stock’s current price, the price you paid for it,
and your total gain (or, horrors, loss).
All the tools that you need for creating and managing a portfolio live in the
Portfolios window. Your first portfolio, cleverly named Portfolio #1, is auto-
matically created after you tell America Online that you want to add a stock
to your portfolio. Open your portfolio by either double-clicking it or clicking
once to highlight it and then clicking Display.
With your portfolio open on-screen, you can do any of the following:
 Add another stock to the portfolio: Use the Add Item button. You need
to know the stock ticker symbol, the number of shares, and the price
you paid for the stock.
 Remove a stock: Click the stock you want to get rid of and then click
Delete Item. When America Online asks whether you’re sure, click OK.
 Transfer a stock to a different portfolio: Click the stock and then 
click Transfer Item. America Online displays a nice dialog box asking to 
which portfolio you want to move the stock. (Of course, you need at
least two portfolios before trying this little trick. For more about 
making a new portfolio, see the text following this list.)
 Edit an entry: Click the entry you want to change and then click Edit
Item. You can adjust the number of shares and the purchase price, but
you can’t change the ticker symbol. To do that, you need to delete the
entry entirely and then create a new one.
271
Chapter 19: Tracking News, Weather, Markets, and More

 Check the details: Double-click the stock entry that you want detailed
information about. After a moment or two of serious consideration, the
system displays a window filled to the brim with expanded price infor-
mation, links to recent news stories, and buttons to create historical
charts.
 Look up a ticker symbol: Stock ticker symbols leave me scratching my
head (I have trouble linking AT&T to the mono-consonant symbol T, or
AOL to its new TWX symbol). If you suffer from the same problem, click
the Lookup Symbol link to bring forth the Symbol Lookup page. Use this
little tool to find ticker symbols by company name or market or to
uncover the company behind some obscure symbol. 
 Download: Copy your portfolio information into a file for use with finan-
cial programs such as Quicken and Metastock or with any other pro-
gram that understands comma-delimited or tab-delimited files. (Check
your spreadsheet or database documentation to see which format your
program prefers.)
 Refresh the display: Click Refresh to get the latest prices for all stocks
in your portfolio.
You can create and manage multiple portfolios through the system, as well.
To do so, go to the main Portfolios window at keyword Portfolios and then
choose your task from the following items:
 Create a new portfolio: Click Create. When AOL asks for a portfolio
name, type it and then click OK. The new portfolio appears in the
Portfolios window.
 Delete a portfolio: Click the portfolio you don’t want anymore and then
wave solemnly at it while clicking Delete. After the system asks whether
you really, really want to delete the portfolio, click OK.
 Rename a portfolio: Click the portfolio with the weird name and then
click Rename. After America Online asks you for a new name, type it and
click OK.
Be careful when you’re deleting a portfolio. Make doubly sure that you click
the correct portfolio: After you click that fateful OK button, that portfolio is
gone forever. You have no Oops key, so don’t let mistakes happen to you.

Secret Tricks of
the AOL Gurus

In this part . . .
I
n addition to its great content areas, strong Internet
links, and dandy little triangular logo, America Online
harbors secret powers known only to a select few. In the
past, only the Acolytes of the Great Circle–Triangle–
Thingie knew the twists and turns of the system’s hidden
paths — only they gained entry to the powerful inner
sanctum of America Online, where customized proﬁles,
Internet software tricks, and personalized menus are part
of everyday life.
The chapters in this part tear away this veil of secrecy,
exposing the steps that bring these extraordinarily cool
extras into your online life, too. From using America Online
through your PDA to building your own Web site, these
chapters explain stuff that you probably wondered about
but never knew how to ﬁnd. With these powerful tech-
niques in hand, you, too, are ready to join the ranks of the
initiated — the ranks of the AOL Gurus.

Chapter 20
Customizing Your Online Persona
In This Chapter
 Unlocking the secrets of the custom profile
 Personalizing your profile
T
he basic America Online account looks so, well, basic. Your Instant
Message window looks plain and sounds boring. Your profile reads like a
tax form: Please state your name, birthday, occupation, marital status, blah,
blah, blah. The whole thing feels like a green-tinted walk down a sterile tile
hallway.
To avoid that disinfected institutional feeling, spice up your online world with
some custom color, neat sounds, and a look that’s all your own. Put some
jazz into your profile with extra categories and simple formatting. Or get
really wild by throwing in some pictures and a clickable link or two. Make
your IMs sing a tune and emote as you type. With the customization tools
built into AOL 9.0, you can make things as cool (or as simple) as you want.
Thanks to careful research and lengthy undercover investigation (okay, so 
I accidentally bumped into someone in a chat room, and he willingly shared
the secrets), this chapter reveals the details of making a cool profile and a
unique instant message layout. Best of all, thanks to updates in the new
America Online 9.0 software, all of this customization works very easily. You
don’t need to type arcane codes, copy and paste geeky formatting charac-
ters, or do anything strangely technical like that. It’s all driven by menus and
dialog boxes now, so you can freely change things anytime you want without
driving yourself nuts in the process.
Designing the Profile of Your Dreams
After joining the digital world of America Online, one of your first meet-the-
neighbors tasks is filling out your member profile with the My Profile button at

keyword Profile. Depending on how you fill it out, your online profile may
describe who you are and what you do when you’re not online (you know — in
that other world), offer a little peek into your cyber-psyche, or paint a picture
of your character in a role-playing game. The space is yours, so use it well!
A house needs blueprints, coffee cake needs a recipe (at least if you expect
anyone except the dog to eat it), and you need a plan before diving headfirst
into a massive profile-customization project. Before signing on to the system
and starting profile rebuilding, take a few minutes to jot down your profile
ideas on a handy piece of paper. Good plans keep any project on track, so
knowing precisely what headings and information you want to put in the new
profile makes creating the profile much easier. 
Need some idea of what you can do in your way-cool customized profile? 
Take a look at the profiles for screen names JKaufeld and my friend
ImTheFamilyDog. Press Ctrl+G to display the Get a Member’s Profile window.
Type one of the screen names and press Enter. Both profiles feature new head-
ings on the left side of the window, extra information lines on the right side,
and blank space to keep everything nice and neat. The ImTheFamilyDog pro-
file goes one step further by including live links that send e-mail, pop off an
instant message, find out whether the screen name is signed on to America
Online right now, and go to AOL areas. Both profiles include a picture or two
(although you might not want to look at my picture right before mealtime,
unless you plan to diet a bit).
You can add any or all of those things to your online profile. The only limita-
tion you face (apart from keeping things in good taste — remember, this is a
family show) is the amount of space available in each of the profile categories. 
When the America Online programmers built the profile system, they gave
each category a certain storage size that is measured in how many charac-
ters it holds. Table 20-1 lists the eight profile categories and how many char-
acters each one holds. Keep these limits in mind when figuring out what goes
where in your new profile. Lengthy dissertations work best in the Location,
Hobbies, and Personal Quote sections, while smaller additions fit into Name,
Favorite Gadgets, and Occupation. Any links that you include count against
the total number of characters, too, so you get less text on the page if you
add a bunch of clickable links.

Everything you type on the Hobbies & Interests page of your profile gets
automatically fed to the Buddy Match system, so be careful what you type.
Buddy Match looks for action words (fly, run, write, read, draw, and such) and
assumes that they describe specific activities (flying, running, writing, reading,
drawing, in this example). Buddy Match can lead to some interesting misun-
derstandings. For instance, if you type I run a retail store into your Hobbies
& Interests page, the Buddy Match system looks for people who like running.
Oops. To see what Buddy Match inferred about you from your entries, open
your profile by pressing Ctrl+G, typing your screen name into the dialog box,
and then pressing Enter. When your profile appears, look at the Buddy Match
Shared Interests section in the lower-left side of the window. You might be
surprised by what you find there!
Doing the dirty deed
With your paper-based plan in hand, get ready to join the ranks of Those
With Cool Profiles. At this point, you can follow the next set of steps to create
your new ultracool profile.
The process may look a little long with its step-by-step format, but it isn’t bad
after you work through the procedure once or twice. (Of course, you can say
the same thing about space flight and gene splicing, but I digress.) 
Here’s how to build your nifty profile:
1. Sign on to America Online.
Because the profiles live on the big America Online computers out in
Dulles, Virginia, you can’t do a thing with the profile before signing on.
(Alas!)
2. Select Community➪Member Directory from the main menu, or go to
keyword Profile.
Whichever way you go, the Member Directory window jumps onto the
screen.
277
Chapter 20: Customizing Your Online Persona

3. Click the My Profile link to bring up your profile editing window.
The profile editing window appears, with the Name tab (on the left side
of the window) highlighted.
If this is your first trip into the profile creation system, a privacy and
security dialog box also appears, duly reminding you that everyone on
AOL can see whatever you post in your profile, so you shouldn’t post
personal information in there. Nod sagely, take the advice to heart, click
the Please Do Not Show This to Me Again check box, and then click the
OK button to make the little dialog box go away. There — now every-
body feels better.
Never post detailed personal information such as your home address or
telephone number. (It’s worth saying again.)
4. Type whatever information you want to appear on this page of your
profile. Use the formatting buttons along the top of the profile window
to pretty everything up a bit with various font, format, alignment, and
color settings (like Figure 20-1 demonstrates).
Like the other text editing windows in America Online, the profile
system gives you all of the rudimentary formatting options. Change the
font and font size, add bold, italic, or underlines to your text, line it up
on the left, center, or right, and change the color of the text, the text
background, and the whole profile page background.
To add a link, a new category, or just some blank space to your profile
entry, refer to Table 20-2. Remember to replace the SCREENNAME place-
holder with your screen name, and the KEYWORD placeholder with an
AOL keyword. If your keyword includes a space (like African American
Figure 20-1:
A little
formatting
goes a long
way toward
a beautiful
profile.
278
Part V: Secret Tricks of the AOL Gurus 

Poetry), just type it with the spaces. The AOL software automatically fig-
ures out how to handle that. For the description in your link, type any
text you want. Figure 20-2 shows a finished instant message link, ready
to go into a profile.
5. After finishing each entry, add a blank line by pressing Return.
That puts extra space between the lines in your finished profile, which
makes the finished profile a whole lot more readable.
6. To add text for a different category, click the category tab on the left
side of the profile creation window, and then go back to Step 4.
The main text area displays the contents of the new category.
7. See how your profile looks at any time by clicking the Preview button.
The profile system displays your current work, complete with links, text
formatting, and the works. To exit the preview pane, click the Back
button on the window.
8. Save your work by clicking the Save button at the bottom of the pro-
file editing window.
After a moment, America Online announces that your profile has been
updated. (And there was great rejoicing.)
If you left any tabs blank, the profile system displays a rather snippy mes-
sage asking if you really want to save your work. If you’re truly done, click
Yes. To keep adding more information, click No and return to Step 4.

As one final check, take a look at your completed profile from everybody
else’s perspective. To do that, press Ctrl+G (the shortcut key for the Get
Member Profile dialog box), and then type your screen name into the dialog
box and press Enter. Your new profile appears on-screen. If it looks perfect,
then you did a great job! If it needs a little bit of tweaking, don’t worry — just
dive back into it and change what needs changing.

I really meant that bit about putting blank lines into your profile. Breaking up
the text with plenty of white space gives your readers a nice break and makes
things look more appealing. See the difference for yourself in Figure 20-3. The
text in the middle of the profile almost leaps off the screen at you, but the
run-together section at the bottom looks muddled and unfriendly. Blank
space is the key.

Get one-stop personalization 
at keyword About Me
Do you feel frustrated because you can’t find
the obscure setting that customizes part of your
America Online software? Don’t worry — I feel
that way a lot, too. In the name of making our
lives easier, the designers added the very clever
About Me window (keyword About Me) to the
America Online software. About Me collects all
kinds of customization features from all over the
system into a single stop. It’s truly a miracle of
usefulness.
From this one window, you can build your online
profile, adjust your Hometown Web site, change
your instant message expressions, make your
screen name look cool in people’s Buddy Lists,
and customize both your e-mail and message
board signatures. In short, it’s amazing!
Poke around in this area to see what you 
can find. You might surprise yourself with the
possibilities!

Expressing Yourself in IMs, 
Desktops, and Toolbars
For a long time, your America Online software looked like everybody else’s
America Online software. Your instant messages looked the same, and your
toolbars looked the same. It was a vast reservoir of sameness. Then, one of
the AOL programmers decided to let us, the customers, add our own buttons
to the toolbar. That crack of individuality spread through the dam of software
sameness, letting personalization explode in the new AOL 9.0 software.
Customizations abound in here, and always under the software’s helpful
guidance (and sometimes, a bit of its over-protective paternalism).
AOL 9.0 lets you mess around with the color schemes for the interface (the
desktop and toolbar). It also gives you lots of leeway in what your Instant
Message windows look and sound like. Many of these customizations carry
over to other areas of the online experience, too. For instance, the back-
ground image for your instant messages also decorates the window when
someone looks at your member profile.
In a bold stroke of usability, all of this customizable goodness lives in one
area of your software: keyword My Expressions, shown in Figure 20-4. A pair
of tabs at the top of the window let you switch between the Personality side
(which governs your instant messages) and the Environment (including the
desktop, toolbar, and the three main AOL sounds — Welcome, You’ve Got
Mail, and Goodbye). The window always starts on the Personality page, but
you can switch to Environment at any time by clicking its tab.
Figure 20-4:
Want to

282
Part V: Secret Tricks of the AOL Gurus 

On the Personality side of the window, you can put your unique fingerprints
on any of these areas:
 Buddy Icons: Your Buddy Icon appears on instant messages, in your
member profile, and next to your name in the Buddy List. You can select
standard icons (just a picture), animate icons, or the new SuperBuddy
Icons, which go through little animated tricks depending on what you
type in your messages. 
 Buddy Wallpaper: This image backs up your instant messages and also
appears behind your member profile and as a border around any chat
rooms you create.
 Buddy Sound: Pick something to replace the standard duh-di-ling instant
message chime. Your Buddy Sound also plays automatically when you
enter a chat room.
 Smileys: Want something a little different than the standard yellow smi-
leys? This setting puts a whole army of smileys at your command. Pick
some dice-shaped smileys, music note smileys, snowman smileys, or
even baby-face smileys. Many of the smileys go through little animations
in the new America Online software, too. (Isn’t that cute?)
To change one of the options, click the appropriate Change link (such as
Change Buddy Icon, for instance). A new window appears, offering a smor-
gasbord of options, and the requisite Save, Apply, and Close buttons. Save
remembers your changes, Apply saves your change, but leaves the window
open so you can continue looking for other nifty options. Each area also
includes a Reset link that takes everything back to the standard default values
Clicking the Environment tab takes you to the Desktop and AOL Sounds
options. Here, you can:
 Put a different graphic on your AOL Desktop, and choose a color scheme
for your software’s toolbar. The toolbar color options live behind the
Choose My Own Toolbar link inside the Desktops page, as Figure 20-5
shows. (For some reason, toolbars don’t quality for their own separate
entry in the Environment. Go figure.)
 Tired of the same person speaking every time you begin and end your
America Online sessions? Substitute your favorite celebrity’s voice
instead! Click the Change AOL Sounds link, and then pick from the rather
amazing collection of celebrity voices, including Cher, David Letterman,
and even Dr. Evil. Preview each celebrity’s vocalizations by clicking his
or her link, and then clicking the Listen buttons next to each of the three
sounds. When you find one that you like, click the Download button for
that sound. Reset your sounds to the default guy with the Reset link in
the AOL Sounds section on the My Expressions page.
283
Chapter 20: Customizing Your Online Persona

For a quick and complete collection of matching expression settings, try one
of the 1-Click Themes at keyword 1-Click Themes. Each of these includes a
Buddy Icon, Buddy Wallpaper, a Buddy Sound, Smileys, and an appropriate
Desktop color. Tell the world you’re happy or sad, that you love movies or
marine life, or whatever else you want to convey. The 1-Click Themes make a
nice solution to those moments when you want something different, but
don’t feel like going item-by-item to make it happen.

C
ustomizing means extraordinarily different things to different people. To
one person, it means adding a pinstriped dash of color to the exterior of
a car; to another, it involves some lighthearted reorganization of the vehicle’s
body parts with the help of a handy acetylene torch. (Okay, maybe that’s art
rather than customization, but you get the point.)
In the world of software, customer-customizable features started out small
(“You want to change the color of your screen? You got it!”) and gradually
grew to the point where we are today. With many applications on the market,
you can adjust almost anything — including the menus and the toolbars.
The America Online software rides this trend by including those two big
customization features. You, the non-programming America Online member,
can add new buttons to the toolbar and create your own navigational menu
system (complete with hot keys). This chapter explores the ins and outs of
these two great customizing features, first tackling the toolbar and then illu-
minating the My Hot Keys menu.
Although building your own toolbar buttons and menus isn’t hard, the task is
easier if you know about the Favorite Places heart icon and understand how
keywords work in America Online. To find out about them both in one easy
step, flip to Chapter 8.

Dancing the Toolbar Tango (Or Is 
That the New Button Bop?)
When it first arrived on the scene, the toolbar just sorta hung out at the top
of the screen and stared at you. Granted, it was useful (and colorful), but it
wasn’t terribly interactive. The America Online programmers put a great deal
of thought into precisely which buttons should appear on the toolbar, and
they put them there carefully. So, if you didn’t like one or another of them
(my personal nemesis was the Quotes button — the stock market and I just
don’t mix), you couldn’t do anything about it.
In the latest America Online software, the programmers embraced customiza-
tion, turning the toolbar (or at least a little corner of it) into your personal
navigation playground. Although they still lock most of the toolbar in place,
the scrollable area on the right end of the toolbar (see Figure 21-1) belongs to
you. Fill it with buttons pointing to your favorite America Online areas, chat
rooms, or Web sites.
Exactly how many buttons can you put there? With America Online 9.0, the
answer is 18. When you reach the magical limit, you have to delete one or
two of your favorites before you can replace them with new toolbar buttons. 
Making a toolbar button takes only a moment, but the exact process depends
on one tiny little thing — a Favorite Places icon:
 If the online area for your prospective toolbar button has a Favorite
Places heart icon at the top of its window, you’re only a few moments
away from adding that area to your toolbar. Just cruise through the fol-
lowing steps for all the details. 
 If the window doesn’t have a Favorite Places heart icon, you can’t create a
toolbar button for the area. Sorry, but that’s how it goes. (Even flexibility
has limits.)

286
Part V: Secret Tricks of the AOL Gurus 

To put a button of your own on the toolbar (or to replace an existing button
with a new one), follow these steps:
1. If the customizable area of the toolbar is full, decide which of the cus-
tomizable buttons you don’t need anymore.
If you have an open space in the toolbar’s customizable section, skip
ahead to Step 4.
Granted, losing a button to gain one doesn’t seem fair, but unless you
have open space in the customizable section of your toolbar, that’s how
things go.
2. Right-click the button that’s going bye-bye and then click the Remove
from Toolbar option (it’s the only one, as you can see in Figure 21-2).
The Are You Sure dialog box appears.
3. Click Yes.
Quick as a wink, the toolbar button vanishes, leaving an open space on
the right side of the screen for your button.
4. Using whatever method you usually use (keyword, Favorite Place
entry, or menu browsing, for example), view the online area destined
for its own toolbar button.
The online area of your heart hops on the screen.
5. Drag and drop the little heart icon into the customizable toolbar area
(see Figure 21-3).
After releasing the mouse button, the Icon Selector dialog box hops on
the screen.
Drop the heart icon wherever you want it to appear in the toolbar. The
America Online software adds it right there — your new button can fall at
the beginning of the list, somewhere near the middle, or way at the end.
If you drop the little heart icon on top of the Favorite Places entry in the
navigation bar, the AOL software assumes that you want to add this
online area to your Favorite Place list, not that you want to make a tool-
bar button out of it.
Figure 21-2:
Just one
click, and
the button 
is history.

Chapter 21: Dressing Up Your Software with Fresh Buttons and a New Menu

6. Scroll through the collection of pictures until you find one that looks
vaguely like what you want, and then click it.
The icon you click highlights with pride.
You can’t add your own pictures to the icon list. For now, you simply
enjoy the opportunity to use the artwork graciously provided by the
America Online developers.
7. Click in the Label box and then type a one- to eight-letter label for
your new toolbar button. Then click OK.
The button proudly takes its place on the toolbar, looking something like
Figure 21-4.
Each screen name gets its own custom toolbar buttons, so don’t be surprised
when your new button vanishes the moment you switch to a different screen
name. When you change back to the original screen name, the custom button
comes back.
To use the button with other screen names on your account, sign on with
each of the other names and go through the make-a-button process for each
one. If you have multiple copies of the America Online software (one on your
home computer and one at work, for example), you need to add the buttons
in both places. Custom toolbar buttons aren’t stored in the America Online
computers; they’re stored on your computer.
Also, you can’t create custom toolbar buttons if you signed on with the Guest
option — it works only on your very own copy of America Online.

Building a Welcome That 
Matches Your Mood
I never imagined that this book would include a section about customizing
the AOL Welcome window. Never. Never ever. Never ever, ever. (Well, you get
the idea.) The Welcome window sits like a jewel, central in AOL’s crown of
online content. And now members get to choose a screen of their very own to
put there. Amazing.
Because the developers gave you the opportunity to make a change, run with
it! As Figure 21-5 shows, you can choose from six Welcome window layouts.
All six layouts bring you news, weather, e-mail, and such, but they do it with
individual twists. For instance, screen #2 features entertainment news and
nightlife information, and screen #4 includes extra shopping content (that
one’s bad for my credit card!).
To choose a new Welcome window, follow these steps:
1. After signing on to AOL, click the tiny Change This Screen link in the
lower-left corner of the Welcome window. 
The Change Your Navigation & Tools window (which you met in 
Figure 21-5) appears.
For keyword lovers in the audience, try keyword Change My Welcome
Screen. It should display the window as well, provided the developers
didn’t change the keyword on me after the book went to press.
2. Look through the available screens until you find one that tweaks
your fancy, select that screen, and click the Next Step button.

layouts may

window.

Chapter 21: Dressing Up Your Software with Fresh Buttons and a New Menu

The system accepts your choice, and the window disappears, replaced
by a new dialog box asking about your Stories and Features selection.
3. Click the radio button next to the type of stories you want to see on
the Welcome window, and then click the Next Step button.
A congratulatory window appears, reminding you of your choices for the
Welcome window and your news and features lineup. If you want
America Online to welcome you with a name other than your screen
name, fill it into the text box. Otherwise, leave it blank.
4. Click Finish to accept your screen choice.
The selection screen goes away, leaving room for your newly chosen
Welcome window’s debut in the middle of your AOL desktop.
Change your Welcome window as much or as little (and as often) as you like.
I suggest trying all the options to see which one really suits you best. 
For a truly custom look to your AOL experience, combine your new Welcome
window with a colorful change to the entire AOL desktop and toolbar at key-
word Themes. Set your inner artist free (and then put the little bugger to
work) with these new tools!
A Menu to Call Your Own
My Hot Keys is your very own customizable menu space. Load it with as
many as ten of your favorite online destinations. This menu comes preloaded
with entries for ten popular parts of America Online (or at least parts
America Online wants to be popular, such as Member Rewards), but you can
easily change those entries to things you’re interested in:
 Why go to the trouble of putting something in My Hot Keys when adding
things to your Favorite Places list is easy? I’m glad you asked. In addition
to appearing in My Hot Keys, every item in this special menu is assigned
a hot key — something that Favorite Places can’t have. Rather than work
your way through the menu or manually type the area’s keyword, you
can press a Ctrl-key combination (Ctrl+0 through Ctrl+9, depending on
which position the item holds in My Hot Keys) and go there immediately.
 You need to keep just one rule in mind: Only America Online areas with a
keyword or Web sites can be on the special My Hot Keys menu. If you
can’t get there with a keyword or through a Web address, you can’t get
there with the My Hot Keys menu, either.
290
Part V: Secret Tricks of the AOL Gurus 

 Some of my picks for a starter My Shortcuts menu include Business
Week magazine (keyword BW), the very fun Moviefone area (keyword
Moviefone), the multiplayer game shows from BoxerJam games
(www.boxerjam.com), and the ever helpful ShipperTools.com site
(www.shippertools.com), which continually simplifies my life as an
eBay seller and small-business shipper.
Here’s how to customize the My Hot Keys menu with your Favorite Places:
1. Find something you want to add to the menu and get its keyword or
Web address and name.
Make sure that the keyword or address is correct; otherwise, the menu
option doesn’t work (and the programmers of the world don’t need any
help developing software that doesn’t work).
2. Click the down-arrow attached to the Favorites button and choose My
Hot Keys➪Edit My Hot Keys from the menu that appears.
The Edit My Hot Keys dialog box displays.
3. Decide which key you want to use for the new item and click in the
Shortcut Title box for that key.
If the box already has an entry, press Backspace or Delete to remove it
(see Figure 21-6).
4. In the Shortcut Title box, type the name of the item.
Whatever you type appears in the My Shortcuts menu, so keep it kinda
short — one to four words, at most.
5. Press Tab to move to the Keyword/Internet Address box.
Figure 21-6:
Take out 
the current
entry to
make room
for your 
new one.
291
Chapter 21: Dressing Up Your Software with Fresh Buttons and a New Menu

If you’re replacing an existing entry, press Backspace or Delete to
remove it.
6. In the Keyword/Internet Address box, type the keyword or Internet
address for your new menu item (see Figure 21-7).
Double-check your typing to make sure that the keyword is correct. If
you entered a Web site address, just type the address itself, such as
www.shippertools.com — don’t worry about including the obnoxious
http:// thing at the beginning of the address. It still works if you
include it, but why bother?
7. Click the Save Changes button to make the new entry part of your
My Hot Keys menu.
Your new menu item is ready to test! 
If you have a sudden desire to forget that you ever considered changing
the menu, click Cancel.
8. Click the Favorites arrow button again, and then choose your new
item from the My Hot Keys drop-down menu.
If a browser window full of the AOL Search system pops up after trying
your new menu item, go back to Step 6 and check the entry in the
Keyword/Internet Address area. The odds are high that it’s a little
spelling challenged.
Dressing Up Your Menus with Favorites
Your toolbar reached its limit, you filled all the My Hot Keys spots, your
Favorite Places list becomes more unmanageable every day, and you still
have a few really-really favorite spots that you hit each time you travel the
Figure 21-7:
Watch your

nobody else
will).
292
Part V: Secret Tricks of the AOL Gurus 

online highway. Well, you have a couple options. You can either whittle down
the fore mentioned spaces so you can squeeze one or two new keywords or
Hot Keys or whatever, or you can investigate the other almost-super-secret
favorites lists.
You guessed it. America Online gives you three more places to squirrel away
those places of your heart. They’re called AOL Menu Favorites sections, and
they hang out at the bottom of the Mail, Community, and Services menus on
the menu bar. Fill these menu sections with your favorites, and they’re a
simple click-and-scroll away — much easier than wading through all the fold-
ers and items you stuffed into your Favorite Places menu.
Handy as they are, getting your favorite places to cling to the bottom of these
menus isn’t a transparent process. Here’s how to do it:
1. Click the Favorite Places button on the navigation bar. 
The Favorite Places window opens, with the AOL Toolbar Menu
Favorites folder open near the top of the window (see Figure 21-8).
Figure 21-8:
Yee-haw!
Three new

293
Chapter 21: Dressing Up Your Software with Fresh Buttons and a New Menu

2. Scroll through your Favorite Places list, and then click the one 
destined for your favorite menu.
The Favorite Place appears highlighted in your list.
3. Drag the item to one of the three open folders: Mail Menu, Community
Menu, or Services Menu.
As you drop it into one of the folders, your favorite item settles into its
new home. 
Now when you want that item, you find it nestled at the bottom of
whichever menu folder you dropped it into. 
While you can stuff the Mail Menu, Community Menu, and Services Menu fold-
ers as full of items as you like, each menu shows varying numbers of items,
depending on which version of Windows your computer uses. Don’t be sur-
prised if, after adding more than two items, you suddenly see a More Favorites
option on the menu that opens the very same Favorite Places window you are
trying to avoid in the first place. Unless you really want three new ways to get
into the Favorite Places window, selectivity is a very good thing.

A
lthough some technologists might niggle over the details, I credit
Johannes Gutenberg (of Gutenberg Bible fame) with inventing the World
Wide Web. Granted, the only web he recognized came from hungry spiders,
but the Internet’s Web unmistakably bears the stamp of his creativity, his
ingenuity, his self-expression, and his simple desire to make money — lots of
money. (And, come to think of it, hungry, carnivorous spiders bear a certain
resemblance to the venture capitalists behind many Web-based projects —
but I digress.)
In Gutenberg’s day, few people read books, and even fewer physically 
owned some titles. Self-expression existed for those rich enough to afford it.
Gutenberg’s printing press planted the seeds for change by making books
easier and less expensive to produce. Over many years, new ideas flourished
and grew, thanks in part to the technology of movable type pioneered by
Gutenberg.
It almost makes me want to run out and hug a printing press. Almost.
The Web picks up where Gutenberg’s press left off and takes self-expression
to dizzying new heights. Instead of scrawling cryptic philosophy on bath-
room walls, the Internet lets people neatly type cryptic philosophy in
electronic form and present it to the entire world.
Whether your heart beats for enigmatic philosophy or you feel like telling
everybody about your hamster, America Online gives you the online storage
space and flexible tools to create your digital version of Gutenberg’s press.
This chapter starts with a few thoughts about making a Web site and then
dives straight into design, creation, and hosting. 

Why You Might (Or Might Not) 
Want Your Own Web Site
What about you? Why would you build a Web site? The reasons vary, depen-
ding on personalities, goals, beliefs, and total amount of free time. Some sites
speak of personal beliefs, family life, or unusual hobbies. Others exist for no
particular reason beyond making the Web the rather odd place that it is.
Whatever your motivation, the Web offers the perfect palette for expressing
yourself, and America Online provides the tools and space to bring your
dream into reality. 
So, what does your heart need to communicate? Anything come to mind?
That’s okay — I still haven’t figured out what I want to put on a site, either.
Maybe you just need some priming to get the ol’ mental pump running. Check
out the following list for some great starting points, and then grow something
that’s uniquely your own:
 Talk about your hobby. Whether you love model airplanes, radio-
controlled boats, or stamp collecting, hobby-oriented sites make great
starting points in your Web adventure. Try including articles about the
hobby in general, photos of the items in your collection, stories about
events you attended, and links to related hobby sites around the Net.
This makes a great way to virtually meet like-minded folks elsewhere in
the world. 
 Learn something new. When was the last time you threw yourself into a
project just for the joy of learning something new? Create a site that fol-
lows your journey behind the high-tech curtain and into the world of
Web development. Start with simple pages describing your background
and goals for this project, and then see where the project goes. This
works particularly well if you do it while going through a tutorial book of
some sort.
 Help a community group. More and more people look for things on the
Web every day. Six years ago, nobody blinked twice if a company or
organization didn’t put up a Web page (although they probably blinked
once or twice at you for asking the question in the first place). Today,
people demand an online presence. Unfortunately, many small nonprofit
and social groups lack the time and skill to create even a basic site. Why
not polish your budding skills and do some good at the same time?
 Support a cause. Everybody believes in something. Whether it’s ecol-
ogy, economics, or elves, sites that explore beliefs make great reading
material. Add your voice to a worldwide chorus with a Web site pro-
claiming your beliefs for all to see!
296
Part V: Secret Tricks of the AOL Gurus 

 Announce something special. Web sites also make great gifts for cele-
brating a special occasion. A friend of mine put together a site about his
grandparents’ 60th anniversary, including scanned pictures of their lives
together and lots of memories from the family. New babies, a first car, an
engagement, or a class reunion all make cool Web site content.
 Share fun with far-flung friends and family. Nothing says you can’t
make a Web site for just a few people — the Net cops won’t arrest you
for obstructing the Web-ways or anything. Family get-togethers, school
plays, holiday gift ideas, and even family contact lists work well online.
 Do it because you can. Yes, it’s the digital version of climbing the moun-
tain because it’s there, but compared to scaling Mt. Everest, the height
of accomplishment on the Web costs significantly less money and puts a
lot less strain on your body. And your zany Uncle Herm always said that
nobody asked for his opinion about anything — use the Web to tell
people what you think!
All this talk about cool Web sites sounds well and good, but keep track of
how much time you spend working on your Web site. Ongoing Web sites eat
time like crazy, thanks to updates, changes, additions, and more. You needn’t
change things every day or two, but your regular readers do expect new con-
tent every two to three weeks. Fun sites and for the in-laws sites don’t require
that kind of support, but they threaten a bit of time peril, too. Doing things
on the Web is so much fun that getting lost in fiddling with the details is easy.
(Of course, that never happens to me . . . goodness no . . . well, sometimes . . .
just don’t ask my wife about it.)
Stuff to Do Before You Build
Deciding what goes into your Web site gets you over the initial creative
hump, but don’t fire up your Web browser just yet. Before heading straight to
the Web development tools and slapping something together, invest a few
minutes into developing the design of your site. Fear not — I don’t mean
assembling a huge formal site plan, filled with figures, click-through projec-
tions, and more footnotes than a football team dancing on note pads. I do
mean giving thought to what goes where in your site and how to organize
everything so people can find it.
If this marks your first foray into the world of Web development, consider pick-
ing up a good reference book covering HTML, the language of the Web. Even
though the America Online development tools do a spiffy job of laying out
pages and generally hiding the confusing techno-speak, you never know when
something in the process might go ping. Understanding a bit of HTML never
hurt anybody (at least not seriously). I recommend HTML 4 For Dummies, 4th
Edition, by Ed Tittel and Natanya Pitts and Creating Cool HTML 4 Web Pages,
by Dave Taylor (both published by Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
297
Chapter 22: Spinning a Web (Site) of Your Own

Here’s my step-by-step method for designing a Web site from the ground up.
It’s not guaranteed to cure the common cold or ensure a refund on tax day,
but it does simplify the site-birthing process. 
1. Turn the computer off, and get out some paper and a writing
instrument.
Too many folks try designing in a word processor or straight into their
development software. Those things just get in the way, particularly if
you’re designing your first site. I avoid frustration whenever possible,
and sketching site ideas the old-fashioned way definitely helps my quest.
2. At the top of the page, describe your Web site in a few sentences.
Keep refining the description until it fits your vision.
A goal statement helps you stay on track. In the next few steps, your cre-
ative process starts moving along at a rapid pace. Unless you rein it in
with a goal statement, who knows what havoc it might wreak?
3. Brainstorm through ideas for the content available in your site,
writing down everything as you go.
During brainstorming, no idea is bad. Turn off the judgmental corner of
your mind, and let those ideas flow. Put down everything you think of,
regardless of whether you know how to build it or not. If you want a chat
room, write it down. Private message board for family discussions? Onto
the paper it goes. Custom online photo gallery featuring the Class of ’82?
Jot it on the sheet. 
4. Look over your list with a critical eye, and choose the best three or
four ideas as a starting point for your site.
Don’t throw away the rest of the list! Keep it for the future, because at
some point those other thoughts may come in handy as well.
5. With your best ideas in hand, sketch a simple organization, showing
what stuff appears on which page, and how they all link together.
Links form the backbone of the Web, so they take on great importance
during the design process. Make sure your visitors can move forward
into new pages, as well as backwards away from their choices. Also
include a home link on every page; then if all else fails, visitors can pop
back to the first page in the site.
Above all else, don’t start your site with a fancy graphic page that simply
says “Click here to enter the site.” When visitors type your Web address,
they’re standing at the front door of your shop or in the visiting parlor of
your ’60s retro Beverly Hills mansion. Don’t erect a new door for them to go
through — just let them into the darn Web site. (As you might suspect, Click
Here to Enter pages truly gall me.)
298
Part V: Secret Tricks of the AOL Gurus 

Building a Place to Call Homepage
With your design ideas in hand (and on paper), it’s time to focus your atten-
tion on the technology side of the site-creation process. Converting your
visions of Web-based wonder into a fully functioning online site takes two
things: a tool for creating your pages and a place to store the finished prod-
uct. America Online covers both bases, but like so many things with the
system, it does it in its own unique way.
299
Chapter 22: Spinning a Web (Site) of Your Own
Should your site settle in Hometown?
Everything and everybody needs a place to 
call home and a community to join. Children,
ferns, ferrets, and programmers all need a roof
over their heads, a floor beneath their feet, and
friends to enjoy. (Some need electricity, board
games, and satellite TV as well, but I digress.)
Even Web pages need space on a friendly
server to really feel settled. 
But how does a single Web site find friendship
and happiness in the vastness of today’s
Internet? Don’t let your site risk the impersonal
rejection of a big search system (you know how
sensitive Web sites are). Instead, introduce it to
the world through America Online’s Hometown
system (keyword Hometown). In Hometown,
your site joins thousands of other America Online
member sites, forming a community that spans
the world. By listing your site in the system by its
subject and a few keywords, anyone on the Net
can view your pages, which gives your site that
warm, loved feeling. Hometown is digital Nirvana
for your HTML code.
Registering your site in Hometown costs noth-
ing, and only takes a few minutes. As an added
incentive (okay, it’s an outright bribe), America
Online doubles your Web storage space from
2MB to 4MB when you add a page to Hometown.
If you put all your Web pages into Hometown,
your Web space grows to 12MB! 
What’s the catch to all of this free space good-
ness? Every page you register in Hometown
automatically inherits a “Hometown” banner
across the top, complete with search links and a
few advertisements. In addition, the Hometown
servers don’t exactly burn online rubber with
their speed. They’ve improved, but during peak
times (such as in the evening), Hometown Web
sites spend more time crawling than walking. 
Still, Hometown makes a good starting place to
sample the world of Web design. Try creating a
page in Hometown with 1-2-3 Publish or Easy
Designer, and see how you like the outcome. If
the banner doesn’t bother you, take the storage
space and run with it. Otherwise, stick with your
basic 2MB of space and build a page on your
own with one of the HTML tools discussed at
the end of this chapter. If you fall in love with
building Web pages, look for something bigger
and better than Hometown in the “Doing It
Yourself in the Great Out There” section later in
this chapter.

300
Part V: Secret Tricks of the AOL Gurus 
First on the agenda is a place to put your site. Your America Online screen
names get 2MB of Web storage space each, which gives you plenty of room for
a good-sized personal or business Web site under any of them. Contrary to
what the artsy-fartsy Web designers preach, there’s no reason for a Web site
to take tons of space — you can say a lot in just 2MB, believe me. For a great
example from a fellow America Online member, check out Jeff Miller’s wonder-
ful broadcasting history pages at members.aol.com/jeff560/jeff.html.
For creating your Web pages, America Online offers a pair of Web-building
tools, but they both come with a possibly unpleasant catch. Its basic tool,
1-2-3 Publish (keyword 123 Publish), helps you create a simple single-page
site. For a fancier site, turn your attention to the more advanced tool, Easy
Designer (keyword Easy Designer). This system builds Web sites with several
pages, images, and plenty of links.
Okay, so what’s the catch? Both tools live inside America Online’s Hometown
area (keyword Hometown), so any pages you build with them automatically
get registered as part of Hometown. That gives you some cool benefits, such
as extra Web storage space but also carries a price. Every page that lives here
also gets a big banner across the top with links to Hometown’s main page and
search system, plus a few advertisements for goodness only knows what.
Unfortunately, you can’t use its Web-design tools without putting your site
into Hometown. (I know — it frustrated me, too.) If you hate the idea of some-
one else’s banner running on your page, flip ahead to the do-it-yourself Web
tools section at the end of this chapter and find a good design program there.
1-2-3 Publish reduces the site-building process to a fill-in-the-blank exercise.
You choose one of its 90-plus basic templates, type the text where the system
tells you to (like Figure 22-1 shows), and let 1-2-3 Publish worry about the
details. Granted, you can’t churn out a wildly beautiful site with this tool, but it
is a fast, simple, and painless way to get your feet wet in the Web-site process.
If you crave a cooler-looking site, take a spin with America Online’s other Web-
site-making tool, Easy Designer (keyword Easy Designer). Where 1-2-3 Publish
boxes you into a simple layout, Easy Designer puts the whole world of HTML
power at your command, as you can see in Figure 22-2. You can start with a
template or a blank page, and then add whatever text, links, and pictures you
can imagine. On top of that, Easy Designer helps you add a chat room link,
guest register, and other top-notch Web doohickeys with just a few clicks. 
Because both tools run inside your browser, they work only while you’re
signed on to America Online. That makes the time you spend designing your
site all the more important, because your design work makes the actual site-
building steps go all that much faster.

Chapter 22: Spinning a Web (Site) of Your Own

Doing It Yourself in the Great Out There
If you need more space, features, flexibility, or freedom than what America
Online offers with its development tools or free hosting service, strike out on
your own with some specialized site-building software or one of the Net’s free
hosting services. Literally hundreds of programs out there help you create
cool pages, and almost as many companies offer free Web space (up to 50MB
or more) to store the results. As a bonus, many hosting companies put the
entire thing together for you with a great collection of site-building and
enhancing tools, such as ready-to-use templates and scripts. 
Nothing, including free Web services, comes for free in this world. To pay the
bills and keep the servers running, these hosting companies place a banner
ad across your Web site. If the idea of advertising for goodness-only-knows-
who leaves you a little concerned, either stick with America Online’s free
hosting services or just bite the bullet and pay for hosting somewhere. After
all, many places offer full-featured hosting for $9.95 or less per month, which
doesn’t take much of a bite out of anyone’s budget.
Although the Net seems awash in free hosting systems, a few stand out from
the rest. (At the rate the dot-bombs keep falling, anything still standing
stands out.) These companies give you lots of space, great tools, and plenty
of help. They include the following:
 ProHosting (free.prohosting.com) makes a great home for serious
Web hobbyists. Every account includes plenty of space (50MB), plus full
CGI-scripting services. (In case you wondered, CGI scripts help you do
extraordinarily cool things with your Web site, but hosting services
often charge extra to use them.)
 Both 50megs (www.50megs.com) and 20megs Free (www.20megsfree.
com) give you plenty of space — you probably figured out how much
they respectively offer by now — and sweeten the deal with a slew of
extras, such as site builders, ready-to-use templates, guest books, and
hit counters.
 Planning an online business? If so, try HyperMart (www.hypermart.
net). It focuses on small-business hosting, with great tools such as CGI
scripting, Microsoft FrontPage support, and even autoresponders for
answering e-mail queries. Its basic package costs a mere $99 per year,
while the Advanced Hosting and Professional Hosting options pour on
the extras without sending the price sky-high.
 Angelfire (angelfire.lycos.com), one of the longest running free
hosting sites on the Net, shows its maturity with an incredible set of ser-
vices for beginning, intermediate, and advanced Web-site creators. Start
with its library of prebuilt site templates, and then move on to its collec-
tion of scripts and other site add-ons. Want to use the cool features of
Microsoft FrontPage 2000? Angelfire supports that, too. Considering that
the whole thing still costs you nothing, it’s an amazing service.
302
Part V: Secret Tricks of the AOL Gurus 

You can build a decent site with the built-in tools offered by most of these
hosting companies, but to spin up something truly wonderful, you need a real
Web-development tool of some kind. These programs include tutorials to get
you started and help files to keep you rolling, plus clip art, backgrounds, and
a ton of features that go well beyond the best free tools available from your
favorite hosting service. Some of the top choices include:
 CoffeeCup HTML Editor (www.coffeecup.com, $49) 
 Microsoft FrontPage (www.microsoft.com/frontpage, about $190)
 HotDog Pagewiz (www.sausagetools.com, $69.95) 
 Cool Page (www.coolpage.com, free to $79.95 depending on the version)
Each of these programs works with most any hosting service on the Net,
including the America Online space. The details of moving your site to the
Web storage space depend greatly on your hosting service, so expect some
trial-and-error efforts before your pages land successfully. Each piece of soft-
ware includes documentation designed to help you through the all-important
publishing step of your Web project, but if all else fails, e-mail the company’s
technical support group and ask for guidance.
Possibly the best thing about these programs is that they live on your hard
drive — not on your host’s Web site — so you needn’t sign on to America
Online if you feel like working a bit on your Web site. These programs work
more like your word processor or other standard office application. You start
the program, open your Web site file, and start whacking away at it. After fin-
ishing your work, you sign on to America Online and send the finished file off
to your host. Working without being signed on to AOL saves you lots of time
(and keeps the phone line open as well).
Some hosting services support the special features of these packages. For
instance, Angelfire lets Microsoft FrontPage users enjoy all the special tricks
that the program allows for Web sites. Services occasionally charge extra for
things like that, but it’s a nice benefit if you truly fall in love with a particular
program’s capabilities.
All of these programs give you room to grow as your needs (and knowledge)
increase. Best of all, you can try every one of them before you buy! Just visit
the program’s Web site for more information about its demonstration offers. 
I also included the approximate street price for the programs so you know
how much each one will set you back.
Don’t let price alone guide you in the purchase decision. Cool Page, which
even comes in a free version, might work better for you than FrontPage (but
don’t tell Microsoft that). On the other hand, you might bond with the more
expensive FrontPage instead. Either way, the choice remains yours.

ometimes, you just want to get away from it all. You need peace, quiet,
and the gentle warmth of the sun on your face. But thanks to our world
of endless activity and constant corporate back watching, heading into the
deep mountain woods for a few well-deserved months of rest isn’t as easy as
it used to be. If your mental state demands some breathing space but your
boss can’t survive his or her next lunch break without your insight, try apply-
ing one of America Online’s mobile tools to keep yourself in touch (but bliss-
fully out of range).
The My Mobile window (Keyword My Mobile) puts a collection of high-tech
communication products at your disposal. Check your e-mail from any tele-
phone, trade instant messages through your mobile phone, or zip off a quick
e-mail through your Palm or Pocket PC — AOL’s My Mobile toolbox handles it
all. If you have the right equipment at hand, these systems deliver all the
information you need (or that your boss thinks you need) to wherever you
find yourself.
Journey through this chapter for a good overview of everything AOL
Anywhere has to offer. The chapter covers AOLbyPhone, AOL on your hand-
held computer, AOL in your mobile phone, AOL through an odd-looking com-
bination PDA and mobile phone, AOL through the Web, and even AOL on
your desk at home but without your computer — truly, AOL Darned Near
Anywhere. I hope you won’t need all these options, but maybe the right appli-
cation of one or two could spring you from Cubicle Jail and send you toward
a glorious (and restful) sunset.

Incidentally, if your boss suggested that you explore the AOL Anywhere 
products — and perhaps even test some — for your next vacation, take heart.
Even though the AOL Anywhere tools work just wonderfully, they all still
depend on batteries in your sundry high-tech devices . . . and we all know
how easily little things like that get (ahem) misplaced during the frazzled rush
of packing for a looooong vacation. (Just remember to misplace them some-
where handy so it only takes a moment to “find” them when you return.)
Taming Your E-Mail with Communicator
Not too terribly long ago, merely getting an e-mail sometimes made your whole
day. During those first few months of using America Online, your e-mail box
probably looked pretty darned lonely (except for the occasional junk e-mail
message, of course). All of that changed as you got to know more people and
passed your e-mail address out to your new-found friends. Messages started
trickling in, and then flowing in — and then one day you wondered where this
overwhelming daily torrent of mail could possibly come from and how on
Earth you might deal with it.
After sifting through millions of their own messages, the programmers at
America Online apparently felt the same mail control frustration that you
experience, so they solved the problem by creating the AOL Communicator
(keyword AOL Communicator). This stand-alone program helps you handle,
reply, track, organize, sort, and search your AOL e-mail, as well as messages
from pretty much any other e-mail system on the planet.
Although the Communicator works best and easiest when handling messages
from your various AOL screen names, it also understands the peculiar techni-
cal lingo of Internet e-mail systems. If you use an e-mail address on a system
that supports either the IMAP or POP e-mail protocol, then you can configure
Communicator to manage mail heading to that address. Granted, this feels a
little technical, but with the AOL Communicator documentation and the
system’s handy video-based tutorial system, you’re definitely up to the chal-
lenge. And if all else fails, you can always rent a few minutes of time from
your favorite computer techie for a warm plate of brownies.
In addition to its e-mail features, the AOL Communicator also brings along
some very useful add-on tools:
 You get a stand-alone version of Radio@AOL, so you can tune into your
favorite AOL music channel without running the whole darned America
Online program just to do it. (Given the amount of time I spend listening
to Radio@AOL, this tool is my single favorite part of the AOL
Communicator package.)
306
Part V: Secret Tricks of the AOL Gurus 

 Communicator also delivers an Instant Messaging tool that works just
like AOL Instant Messenger (also known as AIM).
 Plus you get a news ticker system and a slick screen saver that displays
the current news as well.
These parts of AOL Communicator add up to a very nice package that
promises enhancements to just about anybody’s online life.
To get your own copy, go to the AOL Communicator window at keyword AOL
Communicator and click the big Click to Download Now button, shown in
Figure 23-1. The system asks if you want to register your current screen name
with the AOL Communicator (which you probably want to do), and then
inquires where you want to store the software when it finishes downloading.
After a few minutes of downloading (or many minutes if you use a modem
connection), the AOL Communicator lands on your system. You still need to
install the program, though — this first round of activity only copies the soft-
ware from AOL to your computer’s hard drive. Just find the program and
double-click it to start the installation process. Communicator walks you
through the whole thing, and automatically starts itself at the end.
Start your exploration of Communicator by setting it to work with one of your
lesser-used, backup screen names. That way, you don’t risk misplacing any
important e-mail messages as you learn your way around the program. After
you feel confident with the buttons and window panes, add your other screen
names to Communicator’s list and start using the program to manage all your
in-bound mail.

Putting AOL in Your Palm 
(And Your Pocket PC)
Gather the children around, and I shall spin a tale of days gone by, when giant
computers roamed the campuses of major universities. These gentle beasts
commanded so much love and admiration (and demanded such excessive
quantities of uninterrupted power and consistent air conditioning) that their
caretakers often built giant enclosed paddocks for the creatures’ comfort 
and security. Although these machines had the computing power of a solar-
powered pocket calculator, nobody knew any better back then, so all was
well and good with the world.
Today, the average entry-level Palm device, Pocket PC, or Internet-ready
mobile phone packs more power and memory than any of those huge

Relying on your trusty Sidekick
If you simply must use e-mail and instant mes-
sages on the run, consider getting (or, better yet,
having your employer buy for you) a T-Mobile
Sidekick. The device looks like a combination
PDA and pager on steroids. A small but complete
keyboard sits across the front of the Sidekick,
underneath the swivel screen. It doesn’t look
much like its science-fiction namesake, but it
sure works like it’s from the future!
The device combines phone and PDA functions,
so you can use it pretty much wherever, when-
ever, and however you want. With its larger
screen and full keyboard, the Sidekick makes
on-the-run online computing an honest joy.
Feature-wise, the Sidekick lets you read and
send e-mail, hold instant message conversa-
tions, and browse the Web. It handles work-
sized messages with ease, both coming in and
going out. America Online updates the unit’s
software on a regular basis, adding new capa-
bilities and faster service. 
Now for the bad part — how much does all this
goodness cost? The Sidekick itself runs $299.95,
which isn’t terribly bad considering everything
it does. AOL sometimes offers discounts on the
device itself to tempt the fence-riders into giving
it a try. The service requires an account with
mobile phone provider T-Mobile, but it’s price-
competitive with other companies. 
Is it worth the cost? Frankly, it depends. I know
some people who simply couldn’t give up their
Sidekicks, but I know other people who can’t
imagine parting with their moss and mold col-
lections. If you really need instant messages
anytime, anywhere, and anyhow, you can’t beat
the Sidekick, despite the hefty price tag. If your
need doesn’t live up to the price, try using your
mobile phone’s instant messaging capability as
a (rather inadequate) substitute. For more about
that, flip ahead to the mobile phone section later
in the chapter.

university machines — plus it fits in your pocket, runs on batteries, and
reminds you of impending anniversaries. To harness all that capacity,
America Online developed a group of AOL Anywhere tools specifically for all
kinds of handheld devices.
Using AOL with a Palm, Handspring, 
or Pocket PC device
The designer’s first efforts centered on America Online software for Personal
Digital Assistants (PDAs) using the Palm, Windows CE, and Windows for
Pocket PC–operating systems. Because of the smaller screens on these little
guys, the engineers didn’t attempt to bring the whole America Online experi-
ence to them. Instead, they focused on the Big Kahuna applications that
everybody loved. In no time at all, e-mail, Buddy Lists, and instant messaging
appeared for all kinds of PDAs.
To check out what’s available and download a copy for yourself, visit keyword
My Mobile, and then click the PDA Center tab on the left side of the screen.
This brings up the area that looks a lot like Figure 23-2. It offers software for
both Palm systems and the newer Windows for Pocket PC gadgets. Strangely,
AOL recently started charging for the mobile software. (No, I don’t know why.)
It only costs $19.95 — and if you travel a lot, it’s definitely money well spent.

Chapter 23: Sampling AOL’s Advanced Tools

Overall, the programs work great — they really saved my bacon during some
business conferences — but you need some extra equipment to make them
really sing. First, get a modem for your device. You need that to make the
communications link between your PDA and America Online. Check your PDA
manufacturer’s Web site for details on the modems available for your device.
Expect to spend around $100 to $150 for a modem. (But it’s worth every
penny to a serious on-the-road professional.)
Thanks to some extra hardware in Windows CE and Windows for Pocket PC
devices, these fellows can use the America Online software with either a
modem or a network card. If you work in a large office environment, you
might plug your handheld into the network instead of slapping in a modem
and dialing the old-fashioned way. If you travel outside the office, definitely
get a modem. 
Next on your shopping list is a good text entry system for your PDA. It
sounds odd given the portable nature of a PDA, but if you want to do any-
thing serious (such as writing memos, taking notes in a meeting, or compiling
your thoughts about a project), a keyboard of some kind greatly speeds up
the process. 
The single best PDA keyboard on the market comes from a little company
called Think Outside (www.thinkoutside.com). Its Stowaway folding key-
board looks incredible, feels even better than it looks, and takes up less
space in your travel bag than a paperback book. You never spent a better
$99 than this. It makes keyboards for all Palm and Handspring PDA, as well
as selected Compaq, Hewlett Packard, and Sony models. Visit its Web site
for the details.
Although I thought that nothing would ever tempt my fingers to wander from
my beloved Stowaway keyboard, the Fitaly Stamp system (www.fitaly.com,
and then click the Fitaly Stamp link) completely won my heart for typing while
on the go. Fitaly draws its name from the strange-looking letter layout shown
in Figure 23-3. The researchers at Fitaly designed this keyboard for single-
finger typing, which is precisely what you do with a stylus and your PDA.
After getting used to the layout, the Fitaly keyboard really amazes you. In no
time at all, you’re entering text much faster than you could with the standard
handwriting methods, and with significantly greater accuracy. This little pro-
gram is worth its weight in gold.
Try it by downloading the on-screen version of the keyboard. Thanks to
Fitaly’s try-before-you-buy approach to selling software, you can give the
Fitaly software a solid test without risking any money at all. After falling in
love with it (and you will, trust me), I highly recommend upgrading to the
Fitaly Stamp version, provided it makes one that works with your PDA. As 
I write this, Fitaly Stamp offers a Palm version, but its Pocket PC version
isn’t quite finished yet.

Toodling around with your mobile phone
Always a restless group, the designers built on their PDA success by testing
the mobile phone market. By working with the folks at Sprint PCS and AT&T
Wireless, America Online served up the first serious online access available to
mobile phone users. In fact, America Online is even built right into the menus
of Internet-capable phones for those two systems — just get into the phone’s
microbrowser, and choose AOL from the menu. From there, you can sign in,
check your e-mail, and even exchange instant messages with your friends. 
Before getting too awfully excited about this, remember that a mobile
phone’s tiny screen makes a Personal Digital Assistant look like a widescreen
TV. On top of that, the microbrowser software — the main ingredient of navi-
gating the online world through your phone — forces you to do everything
with laborious menus. If you ever uttered words such as “#*&@!$” while using
one of those “Press 1 for an obscure department nobody ever talks to; press
2 for . . .” phone systems, prepare for the worst. Web browsing, e-mailing, and
instant messaging on your mobile phone might just send you over the edge.
(And you didn’t even try typing on it yet . . . ewwww!)

Chapter 23: Sampling AOL’s Advanced Tools

If your patience rivals that of the saints, give your mobile phone Internet ser-
vice a try. Among other things, it gives you wireless access to the news head-
lines, stock quotes, and sports scores of the MyAOL area (keyword My AOL),
the wild shopping safari of eBay auctions (www.ebay.com), plus restaurant
reviews, driving directions, traffic reports, movie show times, and flight infor-
mation. Unfortunately, it gives you all that on a tiny screen accessed through
a particularly painful interface.
Although I think mobile-phone access might eventually turn into the coolest
thing since e-mail itself, right now it definitely wears the badge of Painfully
New Technology. For a significantly better solution that uses your mobile
phone, consider AOLbyPhone, covered in the next section. 
Connecting through the Web
Like it or loathe it, the Internet seems determined to infiltrate every nook and
cranny of the physical world. It started with computers at colleges and univer-
sities and then spread to homes. Internet-connected workstations appeared in
airport gate lounges. Internet kiosks popped up at the local mall. Perfectly
good delis turned into Net-dot-cafes (which, I hasten to add, suddenly forgot
everything they knew about the deli business, including how to make a good
turkey and Swiss on whole wheat, with just a touch of mayo and brown mus-
tard to really bring out the flavor).
With all this Internet connectivity at your fingertips, you’re never far from
America Online. As part of the AOL Anywhere initiative, the engineers in Dulles
completely revamped the main America Online Web site (www.aol.com),
turning it from a somewhat average news site to a true information portal. By
signing on to the Web site with your regular America Online screen name and
password, you get full access to your e-mail box, a wonderfully customizable
news system called MyAOL (keyword My AOL, or my.aol.com through a
browser). 
In addition to the e-mail and chat tools in the main AOL.com site, you can also
hop into the Instant Messaging system while on the road without installing any
special software. Figure 23-4 shows the Web-based AIM Express (www.aim.com,
click the AIM Express option). You get full instant message capability — even
your Buddy List comes along for the ride!
The most amazing thing about the Web-based side of AOL Anywhere is the
price: It’s completely, totally free. (I know — I barely believed it myself.) The
next time you find yourself without your America Online software (like on
your computer at work), visit www.aol.com and give the system a try.

Reach Out and Touch Your E-Mail
Cracking open your e-mail box with a Web browser, handheld computer, or
even a souped-up mobile phone might represent the next iteration of the
portable online experience, but it still depends on some kind of special 
technology — and special in that sentence translates into wazoo-related
costs. To truly transcend the technological barriers and become one with
the online world, do away with the high-tech stuff completely and reach for
a simple, old-fashioned telephone.
With nothing more than a regular telephone and some relatively quiet sur-
roundings, AOLbyPhone (keyword AOLbyPhone) serves up your e-mail box,
plus lots of interactive information and the latest news. Thanks to a surpris-
ingly good voice recognition system, you simply talk your way through the
offerings instead of constantly punching away at keypad buttons. This makes
AOLbyPhone particularly useful on a mobile phone (pressing the buttons as
they snuggle against your cheek is tough).

Chapter 23: Sampling AOL’s Advanced Tools

Here’s a look at what AOLbyPhone provides through its “speak your com-
mands” interface:
 E-mail: Check your messages for the latest arrivals. Thankfully, the system
starts with the newest messages and works backward from there. Unlike
the other AOL Anywhere e-mail options, AOLbyPhone only reads your
messages — it can’t send a reply. (Even extremely cool technology bumps
up against limits every now and then.)
 Journal: Make your next journal entry a voice recording! Wherever you
find yourself in the world, call AOLbyPhone and say “Journals.” The
system records what you say and automatically inserts it as a new item
in your online journal. When you get home, pop into the Journal editing
system to add a title and any extra text you want.
 Headline News: Keep track of the top stories in the political, sports,
business, health, and entertainment world, read to you by a particularly
energetic group of CNN Radio broadcasters.
 Sports: Sift through stories and scores by team or by sport, including
both professional and college teams. 
 Restaurants and Bars and Clubs: Browse through restaurant, bar, and
club listings provided by America Online’s Digital City system. This
works best in larger cities such as Chicago, Las Vegas, and Seattle.
Beyond that, you might get a mangy little list; if you’re on the road,
you’d do better by simply asking a friendly hotel clerk for suggestions.
 Weather: Pick up the current conditions and forecast for any city around
the world.
 Movies: Check the local movie listings with America Online’s Moviefone.
Find movies by title, theater, or the Top 10 list of most-requested
information. 
You can customize the offerings in Finance, Sports, Weather, and some other
areas by setting the appropriate sections of MyAOL (keyword My AOL).
If you ever get stuck in the system (it happens more than I anticipate, but I
also get distracted easily), you can always say “Help” for guidance. For those
times when you really lose your train of thought, rely on the ever-helpful
main menu command, which whisks you back to the top-level menu (and
feeds you a quick advertisement along the way).
Like so many good things, AOLbyPhone costs money. Your first month is free
(just long enough to try the service and get hooked), and after that it sets
you back $3.95 per month. If you travel extensively or spend your days out of
the office, you quickly get that much use out of the service.

epending on who you ask, the online world and the Internet are either
chock-full of the latest information about every topic under the sun, or
they’re factual mirages that look promising from a distance but disappear as
soon as you arrive. Why do people hold such radically different views on the
subject? Because the first person found what he or she was looking for, and
the second didn’t.
The key to finding stuff, of course, is knowing where to look. In the online
world, that’s quite a challenge because you have so many places to look. This
chapter provides some starting locations as you search for fun people, nifty
places, and various online features.
Always watch for new resources — you never know when you may find one.
Feel free to jot down an area’s keyword or address here in this book, too, so
that you don’t accidentally lose the address in the shuffle. (After all, it is your
book, so you can write whatever you want.)

Decoding Digital Terminology
The computer industry turns out new technology quicker than you can say,
“I just bought a new computer.” (I suppose the lesson here involves announc-
ing our PC purchases with shorter sentences, but I digress.) But computers
are the industry’s second most prolific products. More than anything else,
computer nerds make amazing new names for things.
To keep a handle (or at least get a grip) on the wild world of computerese,
visit Webopedia at webopedia.internet.com. Decipher specific terms by
typing them in the Webopedia search box or browse a list of related terms by
choosing a category. The site also features a Term of the Day, for those days
when you need a cool new techno-term to impress the computer folks.
Strolling through the 
Children’s Art Archive
When children create art, there’s just something about it that makes even the
most jaded adult crack a grin (except, of course, if the young artist selected a
medium like “Mom’s new white sheets” or the ever-popular “living room wall”).
To expand the reach of youthful art, the folks at PapaInk (www.papaink.org)
created a full-time, online art gallery dedicated exclusively to works by young
artists. And it’s quite a place to see.
The site features works from all over the world — and, very possibly, from
around the corner. Check out the collections area for some truly amazing and
moving images. The international collections on the Historical Art page almost
leave you breathless with a child’s eye view of things no child should need to
experience. The When They Were Children area piques a lot of interest as well,
with its look back at the childhood works of current adult artists.
Any young artist can submit works for display on the site. For more about
adding images of your budding Rembrandt’s painting, sculpture, or whatever,
click the Exhibit link on the site’s home page. It needs volunteer curators,
too, so consider giving some of your time. What’s better than helping nurture
a child?

Ferreting Out Long-Lost Friends and
Businesses, Wherever They May Be
Want to find your old flame from high school? Interested in seeing your col-
lege roommates again? (Maybe they finally have the rent money they owe
you!) You already searched the People Directory but found nothing. Is there
anywhere else to turn? Yes!
Finding a person’s e-mail address, street address, and phone number can’t
get much easier than the AOL White Pages (keyword White Pages) or the
white pages area of The Ultimates (www.theultimates.com/white). To find
a business, use the AOL Yellow Pages (keyword Yellow Pages), the yellow
pages section of The Ultimates (www.theultimates.com/yellow), or simply
look for the company in your favorite online search engine.
Tripping through the 
Coolest Online Areas
After spending some time on America Online, falling into a rut is easy. You
find a few areas that match your interests, visit them regularly, and get to
know the members there. After a while, however, you may long for something
new — a change of pace and scenery, perhaps.
When the urge strikes, answer it with a quick trip to the Search system (key-
word Search), the What’s New list (keyword New), or the delightfully enter-
taining wheel of fortune at keyword Explore. Each of these resources
presents links to both new and popular online areas. Presto — you have 
a never-ending supply of great places to go.
Sending Online Cards, Flowers, 
and Other Things That Smell
The online world brings people closer in amazing ways. Distance makes no
difference on the Internet, so your circle of online friends quickly includes
people from everywhere around the globe. Unfortunately, distance does
make a difference when you want to send greeting cards and other gifts to
your buddies. Popping an e-mail over to Guam is one thing, but shipping a
batch of Chicago-style pizzas is quite another.
319
Chapter 24: Ten Fun Things to Do Online

The good news is that programmers love these types of problems, and they
quickly developed a solution. If your friends exist in the digital world, why
shouldn’t your cards and gifts live there, too? Thanks to these clever pro-
grammers, the Internet is chock-full of digital postcard, greeting-card, and
flower-delivery services. With a few quick clicks, you can e-mail your senti-
ments to friends and family. Best of all, most of these services are free!
Table 24-1 includes a variety of greeting cards, postcards, and flower bou-
quets (well, at least pictures of flower bouquets — but at least they don’t
need any water). I couldn’t resist including one off-the-wall delivery service,
but I think that you can find it in the list without further explanation.

Although it doesn’t look long or complicated, writing this section took me
about an hour. I didn’t wrestle with writer’s block or get constantly inter-

inventionatplay.org. Do not visit this site unless you want to invest (yes,
invest, not spend) a solid half-hour or more in stimulating your brain through
clever puzzles, imaginative exercises, and, well, play! It’s absolutely delightful.
Invention At Play comes to you from the fertile minds at the Lemelson Center
for the Study of Invention and Innovation, a unique part of the Smithsonian
Institution’s National Museum of American History. The site features all kinds
of nifty gadgets to start those innovative juices flowing. Look in the Invention
Playhouse for shape puzzles, a cloud maker, a ball-in-the-cup challenge, and
other clever things. The Inventors’ Stories area tells true tales of how current
inventors got their start as clever children. And if you still don’t think playing
unleashes the power of the mind, visit the Does Play Matter section.
Just don’t say that I didn’t warn you about the whole time investment thing,
okay?
Downloading the Best Software
You can’t beat a huge, free collection of programs for bringing out the com-
puter geek in anyone (free programs always work for me, but then again, I
may not be the best sample population). Let your inner nerd run free in the
AOL software libraries. Download some business programs, home-management
tools, or even a few games — everything is yours for the taking.
To search the libraries’ software, use keyword Download Center. By default,
the system searches for Windows software, but you can find Macintosh or PDA
goodies by changing the computer type setting right next to the search box.
For more about the perils and pleasures of downloading, see Chapter 17.
Tracking Packages All Over the World
Depending on what you do for a living, following the progress of little boxes
as they wing around the world may (or may not) be of particular importance
to you. If you ship a number of packages, though, or if you work from home,
knowing the current location of a much-needed carton or document envelope
often makes or breaks your whole day.

bar (right next to the Go button, near the top of your screen), and then type
the appropriate shipping company address from the following list:
 Airborne Express: www.airborne.com
 DHL Worldwide Express: www.dhl-usa.com
 Federal Express: www.fedex.com
 United Parcel Service: www.ups.com
 United States Postal Service: www.usps.gov
America Online automatically launches your Web browser and opens the
page. Carefully follow the on-screen instructions to find your package.
For a quick, all-in-one shipping destination, head over to ShipperTools.com
(www.shippertools.com). It brings together all the popular package-
tracking systems, plus offers some great services. (I love these guys!)
Practicing a Foreign Language
Whether you dialogue in Spanish, discuss in French, or even deliberate in
Swedish, the online world offers plenty of places for you to practice your
skills. If you want multilingual chatter, drop into the AOL Bistro (keyword
Bistro) to talk with others in Arabic, Chinese, German, Russian, and a host of
other languages. 
To visit the world of AOL sites, which feature each country’s primary native
language, use keyword International to display the main AOL International
window. Then scroll through the AOL in Other Countries drop-down list at
the bottom of the menu to find the country (and language) of your choice. 
While you’re on a roll, you might want to also peruse one of the thousands of
online newspapers available through America Online. Keyword International
displays the International window; from there click the World Newspapers
link. The small, unassuming AOL International Newspapers window opens.
Browse through the many folders until you find a part of the world and 
language you like, and then keep clicking to fly away to that paper’s Web site.

I
often think that computers and software were invented by a cabal of psy-
chiatrists and psychologists as a long-term project to ensure that Western
civilization would have trouble coping in the twenty-first century (and there-
fore would need their services for many years to come). With that meaningful
observation off my chest, it’s time to consider the problem at hand —
namely, the one you’re having right now. Look for your problem in the 
following sections. If you find it (or one much like it), read the information 
in that section and try the solution I suggest.
Before doing anything else, try Doctor Tapedbridge’s Miracle Cure for Most
Everything That Ails Your Computer: When things fail for no apparent reason,
log off AOL, restart your computer, and try again. Believe it or not, this one
simple process fixes computer problems about four times out of five. (And
for this I went through computer troubleshooting school . . . )

If the universal cure doesn’t solve things, check out the various solutions in
this chapter, or try keyword Help for more detailed suggestions. You can also
contact America Online’s Tech Support folks in several different ways, which
the next section explains. (Sadly, sending Morse code signals by beating your
computer with a sledgehammer won’t help you contact the tech support
folks, but it might make you feel better anyway. Go ahead and try it if you feel
that desperate.)
Yodeling to AOL Tech Support
America Online offers a pretty broad range of technical support for you. If
you can sign on to the system, try the interactive help experience at keyword
Live Help (appearing in Figure 25-1). This area connects you in a live, one-on-
one chat with a helpful techie at the secret AOL Tech Support offices, located
in some windowless basement far from civilization. 
Figure 25-1:
No matter
the time 
of day (or
rain, sleet,
or hail, 
I suppose),
AOL Live
Help stands
ready to
answer
your cry.

Part VI: The Part of Tens

The Live Help keyword opens a big window offering your choice of technical
help or billing assistance. Click the button for the type of help you want, 
and then follow the on-screen instructions. In just a few moments, an AOL
support professional (or at least someone who plays an AOL support profes-
sional on TV) lands in the chat area to assist you. Believe it or not, they keep
those poor people available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, so someone
is always available no matter when you run into trouble.
If you can’t get back online at all and you live in the United States, call the
friendly America Online Technical Support folks at 800-827-6364 and share
your pain with them. Folks living outside of the United States should call their
respective country’s technical support number. 
The IM Catcher Doesn’t Catch Anything
One of the cleverest tricks in the America Online 9.0 software involves a
handy new feature called the IM Catcher. This little fellow intercepts instant
messages from people who aren’t on your Buddy List, and prevents them
from interrupting your day.
For some inexplicable reason, the IM Catcher doesn’t always start working the
way it should — you might need to prod it a little before it works just right. If
you find that incoming instant messages from people you don’t know (particu-
larly messages sent through AOL Instant Messenger) still appear with the old-
fashioned knock-knock window, it means that the IM Catcher took the day off,
and needs a couple clicks of motivation before it starts working again.
To kick-start the IM Catcher, follow these steps:
1. Open the IM Catcher window with keyword IM Catcher. 
The IM Catcher window that you know, love, and aren’t seeing regularly
comes to the front.
2. In the lower-left corner of the window, click the Automatically Use the
IM Catcher check box. The check mark disappears from the box.
Yes, this seems counterintuitive, but work with me.
3. Click the same check box again to make the check mark reappear, and
then close the IM Catcher window by clicking the X button in the
upper-right corner.
Usually, if you want something to work, you turn it on. In this case, you
need to turn it off and then turn it back on before it realizes that it’s on.
Go figure.
327
Chapter 25: Ten Things That Can Go Wrong (And How to Fix Them)

4. Restart your America Online software and sign on again.
At this point, the IM Catcher should work just like you hoped. 
If your IM Catcher still doesn’t do anything, try reinstalling the America
Online software or call AOL Technical Support.
The Computer Almost Signs On
Your password is in, the modem is singing, and all is well with the world. At
least it was until you couldn’t complete the connection to America Online.
Usually, this failure to connect happens at Step 5 or 6 of the connection
process — the ones labeled Preparing Network Connection and
Connecting to America Online. This problem isn’t your fault; the fault
belongs to America Online. For some reason, the America Online computers
didn’t acknowledge your existence. Perhaps the computers have so much
going on that they can’t spare a moment from their busy schedule for you.
Perhaps the computers aren’t running. Whatever the reason, wait a while
(15–20 minutes) and then try to sign on again. If this behavior keeps up for
more than an hour or two, call the America Online support number
(800-827-6364) and find out what’s happening.
The Host Isn’t Responding to You
This “Host isn’t responding” message is nerd lingo for “The computer didn’t
answer your request,” usually expressed in human terms as “Huh? What?
Were you talking to me?” You wanted to do something simple (such as dis-
play the News window), but the big computers at America Online weren’t
paying attention, so your America Online software got into a huff and dis-
played the “Host isn’t responding” message on your computer screen. Isn’t
that just like computers? Give them a little power, and they walk all over you.
Stuff like this happens when a large number of people are using America
Online at the same time. Don’t be surprised if you get these errors in the
evening, because that’s when everybody is usually signed on. When this mes-
sage appears (and if it hasn’t yet, don’t feel left out; it will eventually), the
first thing to do is try again. This time, it should work. If you’re still having
problems, sign off, sign on, and try yet again. Beyond that, throw up your
hands in defeat and go have some ice cream. (Sometimes, that’s the only
thing that helps.)

The System Rudely Kicks You Off
You’re minding your own business, wandering online through this and that,
when WHAM! — Dorothy, you’re not in Virginia anymore. The technical term
for this occurrence is being punted, as in the phrase, “Oh, crud-on-a-stick! I
got punted.”
It happens for no particular reason. It could be noise in the phone line, your
call-waiting feature kicking in, a hiccup in your DSL line, or possibly the digi-
tal gremlins at work. Whatever the cause, try signing on again to continue
your pleasurable online labors. If you get punted frequently (more than about
three times a week), call the folks at the phone company, tell them in a confi-
dent voice that you recently lost numerous connections with your online
provider (which is a fancy way of saying that you get punted a lot), and ask
them to check your line for interference.
There’s usually no charge for checking your phone line, but the phone com-
pany tests your line only to the point where it comes into your home or
apartment. If the technician finds a problem in the Great Out There, the
phone company fixes it for free. If the problem is inside your walls, someone
else (probably you) pays for the repair.
This same advice holds true if you use a high-speed DSL Internet connection,
as I discovered earlier in the year. My DSL line worked great most of the time,
but the connection consistently reset itself every day around 2 p.m. for a
week or more. I called the phone company support people, but they couldn’t
figure out what was going wrong, and suggested that it was my equipment.
Thanks to some further investigation by them (brought on by continued
prodding by me), they discovered a bizarre problem in their nearby switch-
ing office involving an air conditioner, a circuit breaker, and a backup power
supply. They fixed the air conditioner, which, in turn, fixed my connectivity
problem. The moral of the story: It pays to keep reporting your problem,
even when it seems a little weird to the outside world.
America Online Doesn’t Say a Word
Your friends said that America Online would talk to you. They even demon-
strated it to really sell you on the point. So you went to the local computer
store and spent big bucks on a sound card and speaker system. For that
much money, America Online should say, “Welcome” or, “You’ve got mail”
once in a while, if not perform Wagner’s four-opera Ring cycle. Instead, the
service is mute — nothing changed. This situation quietly bothers you (as
well it should).
329
Chapter 25: Ten Things That Can Go Wrong (And How to Fix Them)

First, make sure that your speakers are turned on and that the computer’s
sound system works with other programs. If your favorite game or multi-
media program brings forth glorious melodies, the sound card works just
fine. If those other programs don’t make a peep either, double-check your
new sound card to make sure that it’s working. (Look for troubleshooting
information in the sound card’s documentation.)
If, after troubleshooting, you’re sure that the sound card is okay, make sure
that the America Online access software knows that it’s supposed to use
sounds:
1. Sign on and go to keyword Settings. 
2. To enable general event sounds:
a. Click the By Category tab in the Settings window, and then click
the Multimedia option in the list. You see a second list of options.
Click the Multimedia entry again. 
b. Click the Enable AOL Sounds option (last one at the bottom of
the window) to turn on the various AOL sounds.
c. Click Save to record your changes.
3. To enable chat room sounds:
a. Click the A-Z tab in the Settings window, and then scroll down
and click the Chat Preferences item in the list.
b. Click the check boxes next to the Enable Chat Room Sounds and
Play Member’s Buddy Sound When They Arrive options. 
c. Click Save to keep your changes.
4. Close the Settings window and sign off America Online.
When you sign back on, the software should greet you with a friendly
“Welcome” just before the Welcome window appears. If the sound still isn’t
working, try completely exiting and restarting the AOL software.
If all else fails, try resetting your AOL sound files. To do that, go to keyword
My Expressions and then click the Environment tab. In the AOL Sounds sec-
tion on the right side of the window, click the Reset link. After a moment, AOL
responds with the simple statement “Your default AOL sounds have been
restored.” Close and restart your AOL software to give it a try. If the AOL
sounds still don’t work after that, call AOL Tech Support.

File Downloads Take Too Long
When you look at a file description, it displays a statistic labeled DL time,
which is the approximate time the file takes to download in a perfect world
with whatever speed of modem you’re using right now. The most important
phrases in that sentence are “approximate time” and “in a perfect world.” You
see, approximations are rarely correct, and the world is most certainly not
perfect. Don’t computers make stupid assumptions about real life?
Here’s the reality of this download-time thing: The actual time to download
something depends on how busy America Online is, how noisy the phone 
line is, and sometimes the current phase of the moon (or at least it feels that
way). If the file you’re downloading is really big (like multiple megabytes in
size), the AOL software may not even try to make an estimate, but instead
present you with an approximate download time it chose out of thin air. (No,
I’m not making this up.)
If a download seems to take forever, your first course of action is to be
patient. Beyond that, go for a walk or spend some time tidying up the desk.
Like fine wine and a 12-year-old cleaning his room, some things in life just
can’t be rushed.
A MIME File Starts Motioning 
from the Mailbox
You never know where a mime may show up next. At the amusement park, in
the local shopping mall, or perhaps as a wandering entertainer during dinner,
you can’t beat a mime for hilarious hijinks (although sometimes you want to).
But a mime in your online mailbox? Now that’s another matter.
I’m not talking about a real mime, of course (although this book may prompt
some adventuresome soul to create a routine called You’ve Got Mime). Instead,
I mean a MIME file — a file that ends with a .MIM extension — attached to an
e-mail message in your box.
The MIME tools (short for Multi-Purpose Internet Mail Extensions) work behind
the scenes to send programs, documents, spreadsheets, and other kinds of
files through Internet e-mail systems. When a friend outside America Online
sends software, a document, or another type of file to you, his or her e-mail
program translates the file with the special MIME tools, giving the file that
funky .MIM extension in the process. Your friend’s e-mail program then
attaches the translated file to the e-mail message and ships the whole thing
off to you.
331
Chapter 25: Ten Things That Can Go Wrong (And How to Fix Them)

When the message (and its attached MIME file) arrives at America Online, the
e-mail system automatically converts the MIME file back to its original format
(.EXE, .DOC, or .JPG, for example). At least that’s how it should work.
Unfortunately, America Online’s e-mail system sometimes gets confused and
can’t translate the MIME file back to its original form. Instead, the e-mail
system shrugs and simply drops the MIME file into your mailbox without a
single word of condolence, apology, or (worst of all) instruction about what
to do next. This happens most often with older versions of the AOL software
(such as 6.0 and 7.0) rather than the newer ones, but the problem still afflicts
8.0 and 9.0 on occasion.
When that happens to you, just download the file as you normally do, and
then use WinZIP to translate the file back to normalcy. Yes, in addition to all
the tricks that it does with ZIP files, WinZIP also knows the secrets of unlock-
ing MIME files.
If you don’t already own a copy of the handy WinZIP program, go to the AOL
Download Center (keyword Download Center) and search for WINZIP. It’s
one of those must-own utilities for computer users everywhere.
Your Internet Mail Comes 
Back Undeliverable
The America Online Internet mail gateway is great if you have friends or busi-
ness associates on the Internet. Unfortunately, the Internet is a technologi-
cally wild place. Mail messages misaddressed in even the smallest way come
screaming back into your mailbox, sent by angry computers with names such
as MAILER-DAEMON@mail02.mail.aol.com (which sounds like a character
from I Know Who You E-Mailed Last Summer). The nice thing — if you can
really say nice things about returned mail — is that these computers usually
tell you what’s wrong with the message.
If you have a friend whose e-mail address is minstrel@linguaplay.com,
minstrel is the user part of the address (the person’s screen name on that
system), and linguaplay.com is the name of the computer (called a host by
the computer people), just as aol.com is the system name for America
Online. Such technical drivel is necessary for understanding the two most
common mail errors, both of which mean that the address you entered has a
slight problem:
 User Unknown: The problem is with something to the left of the @
symbol in the address.
 Host Unknown: The problem is to the right of the @ symbol. An error
code appears in the subject area of the returned e-mail message.
332

333
Chapter 25: Ten Things That Can Go Wrong (And How to Fix Them)
Whatever is wrong, check and double-check the address to which you’re
sending mail. Be particularly alert for host names ending in something other
than .com (such as .org or .net), because more and more of these sites
appear on the Internet each year. Also, watch the difference between the
number one (1) and the lowercase letter l, as well as the number zero (0) and
the uppercase letter O. Computers get all hung up about this stuff.
If the address seems okay but the message still doesn’t go through, try
having the other person send a message to you. After you get that message,
double-click it so that you can read what the person said (and see his or her
e-mail address). Copy the address into your Address Book by clicking the
address once and then selecting Add to My Address Book from the pop-up
menu. Now you know that the address is correct.
An Extra Window Appears 
Every Time You Sign On
It’s a nice day and you feel relaxed, so you sit down at the computer and sign
on to check your messages, engage in a quick round of Cribbage, and gener-
ally catch up on the news. As your AOL software finishes connecting you to
the system, you see the Welcome window, your Buddy List, the Quick Start
window . . . and that window. Maybe a Web site, or perhaps an AOL keyword
area. Whatever it is, it’s driving you nuts. Your friends don’t see this stupid
window when they sign on to America Online. Why do you? Is it some kind 
of cosmic punishment for “adjusting” your golf score last week? (I know, I
know . . . you really just took three swings on that hole.) 
No, it’s nothing so dramatic. This problem falls under the heading of even
helpful features drive you nuts sometimes. In this case, you need to check the
Start-up Settings.
The America Online 9.0 software includes a very cool, very new feature called
AOL Start-up Settings (keyword Settings, and then click the Start-up Settings
link on the Essentials tab). This helpful option’s main purpose is to let you pick
whether you want to see the Welcome window or the AOL QuickView window
as you sign on. But at the bottom of the Start-up Settings window, you find a
second option that allows you to specify another window that you want to
automatically open. The choices include your mailbox, the AOL Search system,
and a text box that accepts any AOL keyword or Internet Web address.
If the Radio@AOL window (keyword Radio) automatically hops into action
and you want that to stop, you need to change the Radio@AOL Preferences.
Curiously, you can’t do change the preferences directly from the Radio@AOL
window — you must go through the regular Settings window instead. Go to
keyword Settings, and then click the A-Z tab. Click the N-S link. Near the top

of the list, click the Radio Presets and Preferences link. When the Radio@AOL
window appears, click the Auto-Launch Preferences tab, and then uncheck
the Play Radio@AOL Automatically When I Sign On to AOL option. Save your
changes by clicking the Save button.
The New Item on Your Go To Menu 
Goes to the Wrong Place
In Chapter 23, you skirt the frightening realm of nerd-dom by creating your
own items with the My Hot Keys menu (click the Favorites button to find the
My Hot Keys menu), as well as the customizable areas inside the Mail,
Community, and Services menus. Now your new item appears in the menu,
but it doesn’t quite work. Don’t let this little setback worry you. It usually
takes a professional to make a menu item that doesn’t work; you managed to
do it with little or no training!
This glitch is relatively easy to correct. The problem is probably the keyword
you entered to make the new menu item — the odds are high that it suffers
from a slight spelling problem. Follow the instructions back in Chapter 23 to
edit the menu item, and you’ll probably discover that the keyword is just the
tiniest bit misspelled. Correct the spelling error, and you fixed the problem!
